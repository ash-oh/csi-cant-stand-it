Hi, Catherine. Somebody wanted to see you.
Main room at the Orpheus.
How, by taking out daughter to dinner?
Oh, come on now! What?!
What?! What?!
Watch it, Cath.
The only thing I ever robbed you of was good s*x.
Oh, they're whores? When I met you, you were taking your clothes off in a strip club.
Yeah? And who paid to close up your nose?
What?! 
I'll let go of you when I'm damn good and ...
I always knew you two had a thing.
Sure.
Thank god you're here.
I didn't rape that girl.
We had s*x, okay? But she was there with me one hundred percent. 
Well, some women like the outdoors.
Mel and I split up a while ago.
You're not going to help me?  Cath, I am in a jam here!
What about Lindsey?
You want her spending sunday afternoons with me at Nevada State Prison ... or the mall?
Catherine.  I'll take a root beer.
I knew you'd be here. You got a routine: Turkey club, no bacon.
I got you and The Truth. Who needs a lawyer? 
I came to tell you how great you are. It always comes out wrong. When I married you, I married up. I know that.
Morning.
You weren't home. I figured you'd be here. Lindsey loves this park. So, I thought I'd take you out to breakfast. Say thank you.
Cath, when are we going to talk about what happened between us?
Cath ... 
Come on. Why do you fight the one thing we're good at?
Hey! There's my little girl.
I figured that's probably what it was. 
When they couldn't reach you, they called me.
Cath, Cath, Cath ... she's my kid too, okay? All right?
So, the case is bad? I saw it on the news.
Hey.
Are you hungry? I made pancakes.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
How is your boyfriend?
She's going to ask where you are.

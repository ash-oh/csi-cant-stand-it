My eggs are runny. I couldn't have been more specific with the waitress.  You gonna eat those?
Thank you.
We could try something I did in Philly. It's, um, a little unorthodox.
Philly, yes. Baltimore, no.
It's called 'reverse forensics.'
Basically.
Well, it's not entrapment if you're not enticing anyone to commit a crime. The goal is to make Simon think he's off the hook.
Whole thing's a catch. The hardest part is stopping leaks. You've got to be willing to deceive the people you work with.
At least.
The first thing we need is a victim, somebody we own. You need a fall guy to play the role of 'killer,' somebody who's jake with having his mug shot everywhere. In Baltimore, we used a snitch. So you're going to have to bring the DA into this.
You ever notice how it's the, uh, guys with all the money that never pay?
No, I got it. New guy.
You know, Catherine, if we do our job right and catch the bad guy, nobody's going to remember the rest.
Hey. Do you guys, uh, organize your files by case number?
So what do you think? Does the dyslexic atheist not believe in dog?
Drugs were planted.
That's in our favor.
Our 'victim' was kind enough to donate a pint of his blood.
Brass recruited him from Narco, undercover cop. Opted to keep his brains intact.
No, can't be. We're going to need a third person processing the scene to make it look kosher -- someone who's not in on it.
Keep them away from the car.
When's the last time you had to?
Firing one.
Is there a problem?
Interesting, especially if he planned it that way.
Smart cops.
Stealing cars gets old fast. I like more of a challenge.
Okay, you can drop that cup now.
Casual.
Simon. His soda. He wasn't expecting trouble.
Get out of my car ... walk over to Zamesca. 
Didn't come here to kill him ... came to talk. 
Hand him the photo.
Then something doesn't go as planned.
I drop the drink ... 
-- grab my gun.
Murder was Plan B.
Looks like he underestimated Zamesca.
And why he had to disappear. And why we have to do this.
I'm going to call it in.
Yes, someone's been shot. I'm a quarter mile west of Mountain's Edge and Durango. There's a man bleeding from the head in his car. Looks like a gunshot wound, but I didn't see a gun. He's dead for sure.
Show time.
Ezekiel Holstein. Local. Brass is running him now.
Or it's a copycat.
Hi, Mike Keppler. Sorry, didn't get a chance to introduce myself before I, uh, invaded your lab.
Yeah, I'm looking for the ballistics on Holstein.
Great. Mind if I sit in?
Thanks, Bobby. See you later.
Well, I'll get Brass to bring him in, huh? Nice work.
What's the connection?
We talked about the risk going in. It's not like we can quit now.
You know that Dawson guy gets kind of uptight when people touch his stuff.
Done deal.
Hmm. The DNA sample yet, might have been cleaned already.
I see your point. Maybe autopsy will show something.
It's called reverse forensics.
He was a fugitive. The only way to get him to show his face was to make him think he was off the hook.
So I dig up a ghost. I know he has a son who was killed by drug dealers, she's being killed by drugs. He's got a savior complex, so I use her to lure him out into the desert. It's why I drive her car. So he'll recognize it, feel safe.
That's the point, isn't it? Clouds my judgment to identify with the victims. Our job is to catch killers.  Guess it helps me to think like one.

Hey, just mind your own business.
Sir, we can just cut the crap. I saw him kill Kristy. I saw everything.
Well, Kristy and I, we had words. I was just swinging by her place to tell her I was sorry, but, uh ...
Well, I saw him get violent, and I took off.
He's one of you guys. He carries a gun. I'm no hero. So, could I go?
There's one thing you didn't explain in there. As soon as you dug Laura up, why didn't she turn Chip in?
Garage fire a few houses down. Deemed intentional.
The smoke detectors' batteries are all dead. 
Sabrina's was the only bedroom that sustained any fire damage at all.
Not in her bed.
But it doesn't explain what she was doing down there.
Adhesive they use to put this stuff down is highly flammable. Crack in the linoleum, the fire will just seek it out and go for it.
The firemen said they only used one point of entry and exit: The front door.
Let's check out the living room.
A few cheap, wood panel walls. Polyester curtains, couple of fake plants. All highly flammable.
Coffee table.
At some point, I think this was a couch.
I think this is the area of heaviest damage. The fire spread up and out towards the kitchen.
Jack Malone, FBI.
I'm based in New York, but I was testifying in a case in San Francisco. When I heard about the ViCAP hit, I got here as fast as I could.
You get a positive ID on the boy?
Thank you. 
You're up. 
You -- you get enough photos?
Roll the body over.
Jack Malone, FBI, New York City. 
This boy was kidnapped from his babysitter's apartment six years ago. Babysitter was killed. The only evidence at the crime scene was a bloody palm print.
Mm-hmm.
Or somebody slammed it against the table.
Let me know when you're ready to transport the body.
Including everything you just told me? Everything you just told me. Six years ago, the killer took the murder weapon with him. It was a baseball bat that he found in the apartment.
Just that they were both bludgeoned to death. The babysitter was a lot older, and she wasn't covered.
So you think he felt remorseful about this victim and not the one from six years ago?
Okay.
We can't process the evidence from every case we're involved in. We have a massive overload already. This will be joint jurisdiction. You do your thing, I'll do mine.
Our missing boy didn't have any, either.
I've had the original DNA report electronically sent to your lab.
His name was Jason Taylor.
He was at his babysitter's apartment.
He'd been home sick from school.
That's when it happened.
An unidentified male entered, most likely through an open window on the fire escape, murdered the babysitter and took Jason with him.
Uh, we never got a decent description of the perp.
Cash was still in the babysitter's purse; the only thing missing was a baseball bat.
Mm-hmm.
No.
Yes. Way too many.
Jason was adopted as an infant. Uh, there was no way we could track his records.
There was no motive. I couldn't even give the parents a reason.
Most children are abducted by somebody who's associated with the family. Random kidnappings are extraordinarily rare.
Have you ever tried telling that to the parents of a child who's been kidnapped?
And how'd that work out for you?
If you don't mind, I'd like to talk to him first.
I don't know. I usually just make it up as I go along.
Thank you.  You can leave, too.
Mr. Michaels. Jack Malone, FBI.
Mm-hmm. Why'd you run back there?
Of what?
Right. So it's probably a good idea not to do anything that would embarrass you.
Yeah, but you did. You want to talk about it? I got nowhere I have to be. And you got nowhere to go.
Sure. It's natural.
'It'? Like it's property?
Brother Willard? You want to talk to me about Brother Willard?
Hmm. Right.
And what is that little voice inside your head telling you right now?
'Just take it.' This is not the first time that you've taken something that doesn't belong to you, is it?
Six years ago, in New York City.
Six years ago, in New York City, you took something that didn't belong to you.
Is that what you call it?! You abducted and murdered a four-year-old boy!
Just bad luck?!
Guy's not the murderer.
He's a Mormon from Utah. Stole $10,000 from the church, entry money into a poker game. Figured he'd win the money, replace it before they noticed.
Single parent. Carmen Davis is an ex-girlfriend. Dropped the kid off with her.
Excuse me.
Two years ago in Wyoming, 11 months ago in Idaho. Okay, one victim was
Breaks the pattern.
There's a big gap between Vegas and New York. Now, this guy has been involved in four murders in the last two years. There's got to be more.
Doesn't mean there's not a pattern. Just means we haven't found it yet.
Great, so the killer could be from any farm in the United States.
Thank you.
You want my honest opinion?
There's a lot less competition in Vegas for a guy like you. The FBI has enough ass-kissers already.
I'm looking for Tom Michaels.
Yes. I have two daughters.
Um, Mr. Michaels ... I wanted to apologize for my behavior earlier.
The same man who murdered your son kidnapped another boy six years ago. He's here in Vegas, right now. And this is closest that I've ever been to him.
I promise you ... that I will do everything in my power to catch this man.
We need a shot of his face.
Just ... hold on. Zoom in on the ball cap. There's a logo.
He had commercial fertilizer on his hands when he killed Evan Michaels. He's a migrant worker, perhaps.
Okay, great.
All right.
Yeah, well, I like to go faster by going fast. Waiting around is not exactly my best thing. 
Is this your office? Really? By choice? It's not some kind of ... uh ... surplus overflow issue?
Oh, I don't know. Uh ... why don't you tell me?
For what?
Hi.
Uh ... yeah.
Hmm.
Is Hank your kid?
Oh, yeah, that's how it starts. Oh, I have some experience dating in the workplace.
Undetermined.
You at the Boulder City house?
You taking a trip?
So?
Right, so he gets off the train, finds his victim, kills them, rapes them if he feels like it, then just takes off.
Well, I'm not gonna do that unless I got a face.
We checked her house; she's not there. When was the last time you saw her?
What about this guy, seen him?
What do you think?
And when did he leave?
Oh. That's how we stay in business.
It's got name, address, social ... The whole thing has got to be bogus.
You can see the whole thing on video if you want.
He was waving at somebody in the passenger seat when he got shot. According to the time code on the dash cam, it was about 33 minutes ago.
Yeah. I don't want to lose this guy.
Did you see who drove this car here?
Where's that train going?
You starting to miss the lab?
Right. Stay behind me.
Freeze!  Put your hands where I can see 'em! You Wicker?
Why? 
She had a son?
That's right.
... and his son.

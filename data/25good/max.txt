Lady ... the best day I ever had is worse than the worst day you've ever imagined.
Never saw that woman before in my life.
You want to know what happened?
Figure it out yourself. 
Tingles.
What is it?
Do you do feet? I got a bunion that could use some soaking.
What's this do?
Mmm.
Good luck with that.
Hey, Jim. Cathy and I are just getting reacquainted. Will Gilbert be stopping by?
You're on.
Don't eat that.
Hello, Jim.
Hello ... who?
Interesting. Do you have the time, Jim?
'Cause it looks like it's half-past. You owe me ten bucks.
Anybody want anything from the vending machines? Come on. It's on me. Actually, it's on Jimbo.  Look at me, generating income my first day in the joint. Yeah, Mom would be so proud. Not hungry? Soda, maybe? Anybody? 
Hi, Suzy.
Yeah, I killed my wife, but it was an accident.
That's right. Believe me or don't believe me. I don't care. It's the truth.
Oh!
If I wanted to kill her, do you think I would've dropped a bowl of Jell-O and stabbed her with a piece of broken glass? 
Because I killed my granny. Okay?
It was a long time ago, and it was an accident.
She stroked out. It wasn't my fault. 
They never should've put the oxygen line there. They let me off for that, but I didn't think anyone would believe me this time.
No.
You would've found out eventually and held it against me.
I just wanted to talk to her.
You know, I thought I could make it be okay.
Mrs. Ivanovna? Hello.
Good morning. Uh, I was wondering if I might borrow some sugar.
Sure.
Yeah.
I can't have my coffee without my sugar.
The last thing I wanted to do was hurt that lady.
Mrs. Ivanovna, it's not what you think!
No, Mrs. Ivanovna, it's not what you think.
You don't understand. It was an accident.
Oh, God. Mrs. Ivanovna?
She was dead. So, you know, I thought ... 
... maybe I'd make it look like a suicide.
It was not ... a good start to the day.
Don't eat that!
After Suzy went back to her mother, I decided to, you know ...
Something like that. 
But along the way, I had a bit of car trouble.
Few hours later, some punk wanders over and swiped my wallet. That's my life. That's who I am. 
I'm the guy who buys his daughter a puppy for her eighth birthday, and the next day, he backs out of the driveway and ...
No. I ran over my daughter.
Twenty years later, she still walks funny.

Lockdown is in effect. All guards remain at your posts.
You're going to like my room. You can see the entire strip from my balcony ... and the bed.
Yeah? Well, I could tell that just by looking at you.
Come on, don't worry, all right? You can trust me. Okay?
I never lie.
Yeah, I am.
I'm telling you, the seven comes up every six rolls. I've got a system.
You know what the casinos say about guys with systems?
What?
Welcome.
Jane, you there? Pick up. Okay ... I'll call back later.

Hey, Brown, you going to find the guy who did this?
You're right. I deserve to be punished.
I'm sorry.

Number one, please step forward. 
Turn to the left. Step back. 
Number two, step forward. Turn to your left.

Get back! Get back!

I said ... say it.
You have to say it. Say it.
Excuse me.
Mr. Sanders, you've been served.
Get up. Get out. Get out! Hyah!

I can't believe you called. I actually got you outside of work.
I don't normally date women from work but there was ... something about you. And it definitely wasn't your perfume.
Isn't that one of your coworkers?
Is that a finger?
Only long enough to see one gnarly looking hand. Well, skeleton of a hand.
With that smell?
Hey, I'm plenty tough.
Sure.
Are you supposed to do that already?
Sara?
They told me out front I could find you ... here.
I wanted to see if you'd like to have dinner.
Now. I'm on break. 
No ... well ... not that bad.
I need to get some air.
Uh, no, you-you stay. Uh, you've got that John Doe to worry about and, uh ... well, I can always stop by another time.
You guys are fast.
7:20. Coroner will be able to tell you more. Looks like she bled out. Her left wrist is transected.
She was propped up when we got here. I checked for vitals.
Hey, man, like I said, I checked for vitals.
The victim had no response. I had no reason to move her.
I'm going to hit the road ...  ... baby.
I've got a GCS of three. I need to intubate.
Hey, Sara. Typical Thursday.
Larry, take over, will you?
I was sitting at the table. Next thing I knew ...
Excuse me.
Yeah. I didn't think I'd see you tonight. 
Thanks.
Listen, I got to head over to the hospital, and I'm sure you got to get back to work.
Hey.
Not me. Death toll's now three. Could climb to four. Elaine-
Eight years in the rig, first time I've actually been a part of the scene. I can't stop it going through my head.
Listen, I ... I got to get out of here.
No, I drove.
Thanks.
I called the lab. They said you were here.  I heard you met Elaine.
I'm really sorry, Sara.
I don't know what else to say.

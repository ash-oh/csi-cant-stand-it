No way you were never married. Oh, let me guess. You were young, he seemed more mature than he really was, he swept you off your feet, and, uh, he let you fall.
So you're divorced?
Yeah. She seemed more mature than she really was; swept me off my feet. 
Kids?
If she's got her mother's looks, you're in trouble.
If you're blowing me off, no worries.
But if you're not ...  ... give me a call.
Wait a second. Let me walk you to your car.
What the hell is your problem?
You're not worth the trouble.
Give me a call.
Was it necessary to show up at my office? Try the phone. I'm an officer of the court.
That's my work number.
I may have. What's this about?
This the only evidence linking me to the victim?
Oh, yeah? Easier for whom?
This is getting tedious. At bars, I give out my work number to weed out the crazies.
I bought her a drink last night.
I was deposing a witness. Left the office late. Stopped at the Peppermill for a burger. Medium rare. No onions. Got to the Highball around
You want to know what happened next? Ask the redhead.
At a bar that time of night, we're all after the same thing, aren't we? I came onto her. She was into me.
I know when a woman is going to give way and believe me, she was there.
I walked her out.
I put my arm around her waist. She moved in. One minute she's got her tongue down my throat. The next, she puts the brakes. She's a bitch and a tease. She told me to get lost ... 
Look, I'm innocent, but it's in my best interest to retain counsel. We're done here.
I see that beauty runs in the family.
I was talking to your mother about the case we're working.
It was a pleasure meeting you.
I want to know why you're setting me up, manipulating evidence to make me look guilty. All because I came on too strong?
I didn't get my signals crossed. You changed the play, and you're screaming foul. That's some power trip, babe. Who's the guilty one here?
You think I killed her?
You going to shoot me?
You bitch.
I know how this looks.
I advise some of the stupidest guys that come through this room. And it's my job is to keep their mouths shut. And I know what you're thinking -
I already admitted that I picked her up at a bar the other night. What I didn't mention, and you didn't ask was that I gave her a ride home.
It got hot and heavy. We both got what we needed.
Then she said good night and got out of the car. I drove off.
I can explain that.
Her taxi never showed up.
I was drunk. Out of line. Bad couple of days, thanks to you guys.
I was looking for a little release and I chose the wrong girl.
Her taxi finally showed up.
No. I have no idea where she lived.
Every attorney in the Public Defender's office is issued one card. Mine has never left my car. I keep it in the center console. You don't need a warrant. You have my permission to check. It should be there.

We were waiting for you. Meet Ronnie Connors.
I understand you fine. So, you're the part-time cook here?  How many days a week do you work at the temple?
You have a key?
Too trusting. In this neighborhood, yeah. They ever have any problems with gangs?
Why not?
'Monks are too trusting.'
Dylan Buckley-- 14 years old.
Guys ... 
Passing motorist heard gunshots. First officer did a drive up. Found the scene. Called in the world. I hope you brought extra supplies.
You're gonna be here awhile.
No cash, no I.D., just a driver's permit. 
Fifteen-and-a-half. Timmy McCallum. Coroner's on his way.
Evidence says you were there. You want to go down for suspicion of murder?
Or you want to stop digging your own grave?
We get a warrant, and we're going to strip you down to nothing, then ask you to bend over-- choose.
You take off your shirt, please?
I'm not. A kid's dead. Back to the question. How'd you get the shiner?
Who was the shooter?
You can tell us and save yourself, or you can let the tape tell us. It's your call.
Why didn't you call an ambulance?
So, you just left him for dead?
You sure about that?
Soup's on.
Roommates last saw him Thursday night. Took off for the weekend. Came home to this.
Roommate said only the hot water faucet was on.
Still is.
Wayne, you want to tell us about the game Friday night?
We have a witness that said you guys had a beef. Specifically, you and number seven.
I suppose your buddies will testify to that?
You're not under arrest. You're free to go.
Like shooting fish in a barrel. Almost guaranteed to run into one of his skips or some lowlife who knows ere they are.
Drive and dump.

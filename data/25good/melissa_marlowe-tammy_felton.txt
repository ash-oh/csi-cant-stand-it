What's she got to do with this?
Mara, my mother ... died a few years ago.
They loved each other.
Only child.
Look, I don't see how these questions are going to help you. May I go?
Excuse me?
Lady ... I'm not your daughter.
A warrant for what?
No. They belonged to my mother.
You're making a mistake. I didn't kill my father. We weren't alone.
I tried to stop her, I swear.
Melissa Marlowe. But that bitch wouldn't listen.
Lady, I'm sorry, but I don't know who you are. I'm not Melissa; I'm Tammy. Tammy Felton.
Thanks for coming.
Melissa. I know who I am now ... after spending time with my real parents.
What are my chances ... in court?
If I plead insanity ... ?
You wanted to help me. When I I.D.'d Joe, you were kind. I need you to testify that I was not sane at the time that I killed Joe. My lawyer says that would go a really long way with a jury.
But it doesn't matter. You spent time with me. You could answer questions the right way. I can't explain what happened in that room today but it's like ... the only memories I have are of being a little kid. The last 21 years are blank -- like they never happened. 
Get the hell out of here.
Don't go! 
Don't leave me here with her. 
Just practicing for court. Not bad, huh?
Oh, you're worth waiting for. 
You owe me one, Darin.
And you knew exactly what I'd do about it.
Does it matter?

I served my time. What do you want with me now?
Pepper spray. That stuff really stings.
Who?
Sorry.
Holy mother ... 
You said the last name was Sidley?
Well, I worked a Sidley place out near Lake Mead, right?
That's what I do -- Chad's Chimney Sweeps. I clean fireplaces and chimneys. I was out at that Sidley place about a month ago. You can call Chad. I remember that place. Man, that guy had one big-ass chimney.
Look, I may be an ex-con, but even I would've dialed 9-1-1.

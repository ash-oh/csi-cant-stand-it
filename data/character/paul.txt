What the hell is going on here?
Roy, put your clothes back on. Don't say another word to these people.  I'm taking my complaint directly to the District Attorney. You had no grounds to detain Mr. Logan let alone disrobe him.
It's not a crime to be rich.
It's right up front. My secretary drove it here. 
You're going to be hearing from us.
Could have been a wrong number.
Is it your intention to charge my client with Miss Freeman's kidnapping?
Diane?
That's enough, Diane.
Okay ... if you don't have anything else?
We don't have time for these games. Okay, you satisfied?
Look, I can explain.
Look, I put on a mask I made some phone calls I took the money but I did not break any laws.
Oh, no. I didn't kill anybody. I didn't even know she was dead. I'm a lawyer. I work for my client. I did what he asked me to do.
Roy Logan.
That was my idea.
Yes. It started with a phone call. I just did what my client asked. I just played a part.
That's right. Now you got it.
I don't get paid to ask. I get paid to do. 
Well, Roy was having marital problems so I figured he was just hiding his assets.
In a locker. 
At his Country Club.

Margaret Finn, Public Defender. Cease and desist any conversation with my client. I've been assigned to you. Guess the PD was thinking of all the lawsuits Richard Jewell brought when he was wrongfully accused.
I'm sure they have.
You're going to be sorry, talking to my client.
Dominic, don't speak.
We want to thank the crime lab for discovering that Mrs. Bennett's husband was dead when she disassembled him.
After he was dead, yes. As you know, in Nevada, there's no law against cutting up a dead body.
Well, she has no idea. She came home from the grocer's went into the bathroom and there he was in the tub, deceased.
Briefly, Mrs. Bennett.
What are you talking about?
You want to alert the government about some forged social security checks, be my guest. But there's no murder here. We're done. Mrs. Bennett.
Don't answer that question.
Mrs. Bennett, don't ...
Yes, anything to clear my client.
He was facing my client. End of story.
Well, that's the coroner's problem. And I after I tell any jury how your side managed to lose a piece of evidence as important as the screwdriver ...  really, how much weight will the coroner's findings have?

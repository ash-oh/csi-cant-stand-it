The cow says, moo.
Lola, if you exhale, you'll burst the bloody seams.
The fitting was two days ago. Are you telling me you couldn't keep your face out of the trough for 48 hours? You want me to be your agent you better start doing your part, all right?
You're here about Ashleigh, right?
Sorry about what happened but she wasn't a client anymore. I dropped her a couple of months ago.
She was a screwed up kid looking for a father figure. 
One minute booking a photo shoot. The next minute, she's screaming for daddy.
He's a psycho!
If you're suggesting I was sleeping with her, I wasn't.
I was protecting my asset.
You can't drive a mile in this town without seeing her face on a billboard on the side of a bus. Up in lights. The mantra in this business is you protect what's bankable in this business.
Yeah. She needed constant attention, supervision. Leave her alone for a minute, fill in the blank.
I admit I gave up on Cassie. Washed my hands. Ashleigh was the only one who still gave a damn. Get together with her every couple of weeks. Make sure she had a decent meal, shower, clothes on her back.
Let me tell you something. For every piece of meat, there has to be a butcher.
Free will.
Recognize this one?
Three years. See, Cassie got deep into freebase. No shortage of sleazebags around to keep her supplied. I knew she had this sister in Wichita falls.
One look ... that was it. Camera ate her up.
Angry was five flights up. Cassie was an obsessed basehead. Cocaine already had her paranoid. Once Ashleigh started modeling, everything became this big conspiracy. Naturally, yours truly was Satan.
Hey, fat girl. I got what you need. I got it.
One more.
Good girl.

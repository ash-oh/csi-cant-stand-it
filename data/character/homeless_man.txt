I was taking a nap.
I'm real tired, okay? I just want to get some sleep.
No.
No, someone comes down here that don't belong, I mean, bad stuff can happen, okay? I-I-I just want to go home, okay? A-a-and you can't make me leave my house.
Well, yeah, as long as it's a decaf, one sugar, two cream, no skim, and hot -- your lawsuit hot.
Get away from my house.

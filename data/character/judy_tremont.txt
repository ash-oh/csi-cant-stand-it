Just like Chuckie Cheese. Whack-a-mole.
Crime Lab, how can I help you?
PD just called. Apparently, the Humvee from your hit-and-run was carjacked earlier tonight.
Crime Lab. How can we help you?
Mr. Grissom. PD just called. ... 
Crime Lab. How can we help you?
Excuse me, Mr. Grissom ...  An officer brought this in off a call from Flora Nevada Nursery. They thought it might have something to do with the Walter Gordon case.
Miss, excuse me. You're not allowed back there!
Dr. Grissom, you requested a custody file from the court.
I'm assuming it's for your investigation into the Miniature Killer. Everybody in the lab believes you're gonna get him.
No one. Just some girl from Janitorial. She went in, vacuumed, emptied out the trash. That's all.
She left a few minutes ago, sir, but she did leave something for you.

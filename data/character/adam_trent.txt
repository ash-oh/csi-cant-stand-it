So let's say you find out who did it, and maybe it's me. 
What are you going to do? Are you going to convict me of murder and put me in a bad place?
Check the files, sir. I'm a rapist, not a murderer.
Did I kill him? Yes.
He was queer.
No. He had s*x with me. He was the punk.
I don't know.
I don't know.
I took his head and I smashed it into the floor.
What? You don't believe me?
Yes. I'm saying this and this is true. And if you don't believe me, just look in the bucket in the latrine.
Okay ...  Do you really want to know why I killed him?
It's because I'm crazy.
Hey. 
Are you a spiritual person?
Do you believe that everything happens for a reason? That bad things are there to teach us a karmic lesson?
You know, maybe all our problems can be cured by tuning in to a higher frequency.
There's this one guy I read, he believes that illness, anxiety and fear all occur when people are vibrating at ten thousand cycles a second.
If they could just get up to a hundred thousand cycles per second they'd be in the realm of sound, light and spirit, and everything would be just fine. Right?
You know what I think? 
I think I'm just vibrating at the wrong frequency.
Don't --
Do you think I'm smart?
Do you think I'm right?
You do?
Don't you move a muscle. I will grind you, you bitch. You hear me?
Do not look at them!
Keep your eyes on the floor!
You! You, go away! 
You! You, go away!
Stop what?
Don't tell me what to do.

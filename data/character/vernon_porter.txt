I come on at 6:00 when Oakley's closes. The first thing I do is lock the gate.
Make my rounds every two hours. 
8:00, 10:00, 12:00 -- everything was Code 4.
Found the main gate unlocked at 0214. Went to check out the street, heard that music. Found her on the floor, called it in.
Hey, Heather, Vernon. Looks like you got yourself into something. If you need anything, call me. Call me anyway. Let me know you're okay.
You got 24 hours, then I turn you in!

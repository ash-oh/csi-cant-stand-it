What happened? You get bumped from first class?
Walk-through. In plain sight. Risky move.
You like to work solo. Take a look for yourself. 
Any thoughts?
Canary days?

It's almost like the guy wants to get caught.
The killer cut you off at the knees. What are you going to do?
You're going to print the entire elevator?

Coming?
Guy's story checks out. He was robbed.
Isn't that the truth.

Tonight's for Mike. We pay our respects by ringing the register. Now, I don't mind if you're talking, just as long as they're drinking. Watch the doubles ...
Uh ... Watch the doubles. Be smart. You do that, we're gonna take this party through till 6:00 in the morning. And most importantly, have fun.
Go make some money. See you later.
You here about Mike?
Let's go somewhere private.
Sorry for the inconvenience, everybody. When you come back, next bottle's on me.
Go ahead.
Thanks, chief. We're going to shut her down for about half an hour.
It was, um ... it was a real shock, you know? Mike and Laurel getting killed like that. But I got to say, if they had a choice how to go out, it would have been together. For him, the sun rose and set with her.
No. You kidding? No. He got her off the VHS covers, and she made a home for him.
Have a seat.
I run his clubs. Ever since he got out of the partner business with Kyle Goode.
He shows his face every once in a while. I just try to keep him away from Mike, you know? As much as humanly possible.
Drake?  Drake the Snake. I, uh ... I hired him. He's harmless. He saw one Ron Jeremy movie. Now the guy just sees dollar signs.
Why don't you go ask him?
Mm.
You, uh ... you never gave me your name.
Catherine.
Chris Bezich.
Come on. 
Drake's telling the truth, you know? He smokes one a day. Not on the floor, right here, my rule.
You verify everything?
Can you blame Drake, you know? He's trying to give up cigarettes. That's like me trying to give up ...
Everybody needs to indulge in a vice at least once a day, right?
That's work. I prefer women. Speaking of work, do you, um ... ever get a day off?
Yes.
What?
You started it.
Yeah. You sounded hungry. I was thinking ... dinner at the Bellagio.
What are you in the mood for?
So you just got the day off? Just ... just like that?
No. You just seem a little pissed off about it.  I like it.
Depends on what you're gonna do with it. 
Pretty expensive taste for a public servant.
Mr. Braun. Chris Bezich. It's a pleasure to meet you. Your hosts, they-they send a lot of your whales to my club, Acid Drop.
Okay.
Cath ...
So. You and Sam Braun ...
Hey.
You should've told me you were coming down.  What's going on?
Yeah, he was, uh, belligerent, drunk -- he was groping every waitress in the place. We sent him over to the strip joint next-door. It was more his speed.
You're busy. Am I gonna see you tonight?
Me, too.

I hate dry chicken and small talk. And more than anything, I hate dancing. So, I went home, and I passed out on the couch. Next thing I know, you guys are banging on my front door. Where's Liz? 
Liz is out every night at some charitable function, saving the world. We have a deal. If I make an appearance, I get to duck out early.
You know what? I've done my time. I think I'm going home.
Mmm.
Look, if you don't tell me what's going on, I'll need to talk to my lawyer.
What?
What?
I want to see my wife. 
I didn't kill her. I loved my wife.
So I'm offering a $100,000 reward for any information leading to the arrest and conviction of my wife's killer.
I will not rest until the murderer is caught and brought to justice.
Detective Vega, Mr. Stokes. Did you catch the man who killed my wife?
Tommy said if I didn't speak to my wife that night, he would ... 
The dog fighting. He showed me the tapes.
I didn't.
Violence begets violence. Is that all?

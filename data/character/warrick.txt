Sir, I'm on your side. I just want to clear you.
I understand that. But the evidence is telling us something different. So I'm going to ask you again, just one more time -- before you shot the deceased did a struggle ensue?
Okay, go inside. Dust for prints. Make sure you take plenty of photographs ...
All right.
Cath, you want some coffee?
Summerlin ... rich folks.
Yeah, the DA asked me to testify on chain of custody.
I could do that in my sleep.
Yeah.
See you.
Yeah. I got a call earlier today from Child Services asking about you and Lindsey.
They told me they'd notified you -- some investigation -- that Eddie had made a charge or something.
Well, I ...
Thanks.
What's he know about the forensic analysis of a friction ridge?
Mr. Ziegler, one more thing. What about the security alarm?
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Disaster? What do you mean?
Yeah, but you think I'd say that?
Hey, Catherine. Check this out. 
You see that?
I think the thief must have pressed his head against the wall to check if the painting was wired.
Hey, a jury convicted a first-degree murderer based on a print just like this two years ago in Washington.
Well, we can get a warrant.
I'm just going to press this against your ear. See?
Jason?
The earprint talking.
Sir, are you going to want to press charges?
Hey.
What's up?
At least we solved our case.
Give me an evidence tag for this painting.
I know, every time you say that, I'm looking at more overtime.
You know what? I got to be somewhere.
Yeah, right. Can you handle this from here?
Cool. I'll see you later.
What?
Oh, I told them as far as mothers are concerned, you're the bomb.
Yeah. And I also told them your ex is pretty screwed up.  No worries.
This painting's a forgery? Where does it say that?
It's not our job to authenticate art. Case is closed.
So, the kid stole the original painting from his pop and gave us back a forgery.  No wonder he copped to it so easy.
Nice campus you got there, Jason.
We were by your dorm earlier with the police here.
That's not all, sir.
No, sir. The police recovered your originals from Jason's dorm room today.
What, did you have an art major do your fakes for you, Jason?
Your son stole all your originals replacing them with forgeries.
He didn't have time to make the switch.
If the hook hadn't dislodged from your Sorenson you would have spent the rest of your life admiring fakes.
You know what, I got to be somewhere. Can you handle this from here?
Hey. I missed assignments; I know. I'm running late. What did I pull?
I handed it off to Michovitch, from days. Uh, I told Sara.
Yeah. 
What's that?
What? I don't believe this. Now you're pulling up film on me?
We do.
I was at the casino. But I wasn't gambling.
Damn! Taking the whole window.
And you have a problem with that.
Hey! This has nothing to do with you. So are we going to work together ... or not?
You know what that means?
It means the glass on your pants and the glass from your living room window have equal densities.
The glass didn't come from any car window. That's science.
You're free to go.
We're not cops; we can't hold him.
Showed him all your cards. Sucker play.
Oh, you just don't let up, do you?
Yeah, passed up a chance to play semipro ball. Went to college instead.
That's the glass you sawzalled.
Oh, now I'm worthy?
Maybe you did, maybe you didn't, but we think you murdered him.
The evidence.
When a window is broken from the outside which is what a burglar would do ...
... Haeckel marks form right angles to the inside of the window. 
But when a window is broken from the inside which is what a Peckerwood like you would do
... Haeckel marks form right angles to the outside of the window.
Well, we know he did it.
He needed the money.
We're back to how do we prove it?
And his computer is ... ?
Still at the house. Well, we got probable cause.
Why don't you go get a new warrant?
Well, we got a warrant so that should give us the room for the night.
Computers turn on. When they don't, it's for a reason. Did you plug it in?
Really?
Let me check it out.
Well, he's a sneaky S.O.B. I'll give him that.
All right.
Let me see that flashlight. There's scratches all over it.
And the hotshot takes another strike. Check it out. Not enough to cause even a small scratch on your finger, but more than enough to use as a basis of comparison.
One, two, three.
Left one is from the broken window the other one is from the gun both dropping at an identical rate. Glass is from the same source.
My theory ... the brother was the executor of the parents' estate. He controlled the family money.
I called the county clerk. With the brother out of the way, Kenny is the sole beneficiary.
Slam that jail door.  Makes you reconsider, doesn't it?
Hey, Jas, how you doing?
Gets you more attention than you want.
You still working on those moves I showed you?
How about that? How about that right there? Good.
Hey, come here.
Apologize to your mom, all right? Let her know she can trust you.
All right?
See you next week, jaws.
He needed my help. I didn't win anything, Sara. You're a CSI. You saw me enter a casino. Did you see me place a bet?
I don't have to tell you anything.  We're supposed to be working together. Next time, just try talking to me instead of going around behind my back.
I'll take a piece of that.
Can a CSI take over another CSIi's case?
Hey, what happened to that, uh, meeting the other day?
Yeah, the department heads were voting on an extra vacation day or something?
What do you think? The kid might have started it?
We don't rule anything out.
Well, fires take the path of least resistance. I mean, they feed off of oxygen and combustibles.
Firemen wear rubber gloves.
According to Ecklie's report, which was filed in record time, the point of origin for the fire was the closet. Gris, there's nothing left here.
Well, that confirms Ecklie's findings about the use of an accelerant.
Damon doused the closet floor with gasoline, lit it and got the hell out of dodge.
Who cares? The guy torched his wife and kid.
Runners, huh? I know a little something about that world.
It breaks down like this. There's about a half a dozen runners in town -- they're mostly kids -- and they make about two g's a week. And they all work for the same guy.
I used to be a runner in college. It paid the bills. I had route five. Worked Boulder, Sunset, Vacation, and the bay -- all of that.
The Voice.
I knew it. That's Grissom. I got to bail.
You don't. He's not who you're looking for anyway. If you want to know who capped this kid? Then you should talk to another runner. I mean, they'll kill each other for a good route.
What's going on?
Same conditions in Damon's bedroom, night of the fire.
Flashover. So, that confirms the first part of Damon's story.
Alligatoring.
But that piece was a doorframe outside of the bedroom -- which was a contained site.
So what happens now?
You got me.
Sifting through this debris.
You mind?
Give me a hand with this mattress.
Or it was. I figure it must have burned up in the bedroom and the firemen threw it out here with the rest of this overhaul.
Or overload a house. 
Breaker box. 
Circuit overload. Master bedroom.
Yeah.
Yeah. Under the right conditions, any hydrocarbon can be an accelerant.
You ever worry about professional suicide?
Where do we start?
Uh, I know -- looky-loos.
Grissom was right: You do know a lot about bombs.
Dominic, I think you should go with your attorney. Thanks for your help, though.
Gris, can I get clear on something here?
Catherine gave me this FP which was part of the Hansen bomb and I'm supposed to figure out what tool the bomber used to engrave it.
Yeah, but he could've used any number of things to initial it. I mean, screwdriver, a drill bit, a box cutter.
What are you guys doing?
Oh, I definitely got the wrong end of this investigation.
Yeah. I finally matched this FP. To this electric etcher. Now, I made an exemplar. Boom! Identical type of striations. The manufacturer says that this etcher is only used for training purposes. And it's only sold in bulk. It was not sold to Norman Stirling.
Las Vegas School District. I called the district, and we traced it down to one high school -- summit high. 
Stirling's son goes there.
All you guys got to go on is a bone?
Maid found dead male body in a hotel room.
Guy's 23. No. Sounds like a live one. 
Let's go.
Looks like somebody had a par-tay.
Darren Pyne. Dead at 23.
Looks like he was whacked over the head with this lamp.
Unless each hit was to a different part on his dome. Who's the room registered to?
Hey, O'Riley, you think ... 
Lynn Henry?
I'm Warrick Brown, and this is Sara Sidle.
We're with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
Darren Pyne was found dead in your motel room at the Lucky Seven. Did you know him?
He didn't leave when you did?
All right. We'll probably have more questions after the coroner completes his autopsy. If we need to talk to you can we reach you here?
Multiple blows to the head?
No. Just lap dances-- nothing more.
Looks like fried eggs.
What's the estimated time of death?
What?! These ladies said he was alive when they left him at 3:00 A.M.
We have forensic proof that Darren Pyne had s*x with a woman just before he died.
Hey, tell us or tell the D.A. 
So he raped you.
Was Darren alive when you left?
It's just standard procedure for sexual assault.
What do you mean, it doesn't add up?
For now, yeah.
Yeah, but maybe the materials didn't adhere. Doesn't mean he wasn't hit in the head with the lamp. 
What are you looking for?
Well, if you don't know, I can't help you.
What is this?
Something-something.
Right there.
Oh, you think so, huh? 
No. Diamonds cut glass. This is some cheap-ass cubic zirconia.
Let's go ask her.
They talk faster at the sports book.
In the old days.
Yeah. Not my wedding.
What?
She lied to us.
All right, let's call homicide and tell them to meet us there. Let's put this to bed before the honeymoon.
So you only hit him once?
Does your fianc√© have a zirconia ring?
May we see it?
You were in that motel room that night, weren't you, Luke?
What happened? You got wind of the party?
Bruised up Lynn's wrists.
You did what any guy in your position would do.
But you didn't stop with one hit.
And you didn't know that you had lost a piece of your ring.
Laws don't end when you come to Vegas.
Guess I'm going deep.
Polo.
Yeah, please.
Looks like a cuff link. Initials C.M.
I'm going to be wet all night.
Hi.
This is a big case. I'm in a groove here.
Whatever happened to you cross the tape, you go the distance?
Great.
Detective Conroy.
No. I do my best work solo.  On the clock, that is. What you got?
All around the ten-ring, once between the eyes. Entry wound give you anything? Small caliber?
Professional hit.
Times have changed since the canary days, huh?
Yeah. Brass used to tell me, back in the day when the mob would make a hit they'd leave a canary, 'cause the guy sang.
Call someone who cares.
When you leave a gun, you know it's clean. The gun just traces back to itself.
All I can do -- follow protocol.
It's like the circle bar on a friday night ... three million people on top of each other.
Cool. You got an I.D. for me?
Too bad he wasn't driving that elevator. 
Ooh! Chicago bankroll.
No, that's just a term. Old school. 
Shrimp cocktail appetizer. Surf &amp; turf dinner. Two glasses of wine. All comped.
It ain't free, believe me.
Yeah. Yeah. 
Been a long time since I seen these.
Cool.
Yeah. Will you log these for me?
Mandy, you got any prints off of that quarter I found on the vic?
It's a good idea that, when your house is robbed you report that your registered gun was stolen.
We're going to keep your name on ice for a while. Thanks for your time.
Nobody kills anybody with their registered gun anymore.
I been spinning my wheels. I'm never going to solve this case. It was over before it began.
I got a dead man in a glass elevator with a bazillion prints and a .22 caliber bullet.
And he left the gun at the scene. You know what that means.
But I got two things left, right?
You got to be kidding me.
Want to share?
I was just thinking what old man Binion told Steve Wynn when he hit town: Always give a gambler an excuse to gamble and he'll thank you for it.
A bunch of cash receipts in his pocket. Markers all over town. Once you get to that place there's no getting out.
These belong to Tyson Green. Just came to let you know he won't be paying up.
Yeah.
I won't let you down again.
Where's McCall now? He's being held?
Great.
Hey, are you just going to ignore my question?
All right, here's what we know from the arresting officer: 
Two 25-year-old guys Chuckie Hastings and Roy McCall, lifelong neighbors one step up from a trailer park got into a beef over a motorcycle in the owner's backyard.
All right, now, Hastings' wife said that McCall shot Hastings in the back. 
And the coroner's report substantiates that.
Well, we would need the screwdriver with McCall's blood on it to prove that, now, wouldn't we?
I have been through all these boxes twice. It's not there.
The gun is here, but there's no screwdriver. They even have crime scene photos of it. But no tests were run on it before it was misplaced.
Right.
Yeah, the same people homicide'll blame.
Ma'am, we're not cops. We're crime scene investigators. We've come to ask you a few questions about the day that your husband was killed. Maybe acquaint ourselves with the actual crime scene.
Out back here?
What's up?
Heard the first shot and then came running out here.
McCall had a semiautomatic. I mean, you could pull off a shot in two-tenths of a second.
So she just filled in what she thought happened -- that McCall shot her husband in cold blood.
Typical eyewitness.
Well, if we had the screwdriver that someone lost 
We'd be able to check for blood.
Mr. McCall, according to your statement you went over to your neighbor Hastings' house to return his motorcycle. You got into a dispute over a wrecked fender and he attacked you with a screwdriver.
So you're saying that if he'd inflicted the wound on himself he would have stabbed his left arm.
Mr. McCall, which direction was Hastings facing when you shot him?
Defense attorneys have made a whole career off that human error.
Doc, are you sure McCall shot Hastings in the back?
This guy McCall swears that he shot him straight ahead in self-defense.
Right. 
All right, look, I'm not doubting your findings. But when guys go at it they're not like gingerbread men, you know? They're, like, bobbing and weaving. It's like W.W.F. Smackdown. You know? All of these things could have changed what went down when Hastings and McCall tangled.
No doubt. When Catherine gets here can you tell her I went over to evidence to check out the victim's t-shirt?
Yeah, but look at that gunpowder. Unburned gunpowder.
Right.
In direct contradiction to our evidence.
Yeah, right.
Hey ... when's the last time you took target practice?
Okay, so we're doing this reconstruction and the best way is to measure the distance between the victim and the assailant during the time of the altercation, right?
Right.
Circumference of the gunpowder is the same. 
Looks like two feet for shot number one ...
...and one foot for shot number two.
It can't. It's not possible.
We just disproved their statement.
The truth is somewhere in the middle. How long do we have till the prelim?
What kind of thing?
This dummy cost over $500?
Why?
He's self-healing?
Cool. Um, the wound track is off. Do it two centimeters higher.
Good.
Now, the second shot was fired like so. Now, the coroner says that Hastings was shot just like this, from back to front and Hastings' wife says the same thing -- that her husband was running away.
Just like I said before, guys don't go at it and fight like gingerbread men, you know?
Check it out.
What if, um ... he was lunged ...
...just kind of like this?
Oh, you are wrong!
Yeah. I'm calling the DA.
Hey, Lindsey, I got some games on my computer. You want to see?
Let's play one. 
All right. I'm McCall. I have a gun.
I push him back off.
I shoot.
And the bullet enters through the back even though we are facing each other and exits ... out the front.
Boom.
Chalk it up to adrenaline or revenge, but Hastings was already going down. There was no reason to shoot him a second time.
That's our job.
Hey, how's Linds?
Right.
Catherine, you've got to get that divorce finalized, huh?
Oh, come on, now. Don't tell me you believe in that bs.
Come on, Sara. 
Spontaneous human combustion is science fiction.
There's no such thing as a human torch.
Sara, this is a crime scene. Stay with me here, okay? Don't lose it.
What's that?
Wow. Check that out.
It's as if the fire created a chimney for itself.
Yeah, right.
Good question.
Another good question.
So do you still think it's spontaneous combustion?
Yeah.
Okay, tell me everything you can about this foot.
How do you know about Sara's theory?
No. You're just siding with Sara 'cause you got a crush on her.
So your official observation is spontaneous combustion?
No, no. We're a team. The only place we're going is back down to that crime scene.
What about the husband -- is he still a suspect?
What about, uh ... life insurance policies?
I'm not the one who's reaching here. 
That would be cool, but you've been jumping to conclusions from minute one.
Well, I brought the ion detector. This will pick up even the smallest traces of hydrocarbon fumes.
I don't care what the lab says. This puppy will reveal exactly what accelerant was used to start the fire.
Nothing.
What's that?
Really? It was actually for my girlfriend here - 
Miss Piggy.
Yeah.
Well, I tried for human volunteers, but no takers.
What are we going to do? We're disproving the existence of spontaneous human combustion.
Well, we're recreating the death of Nadine Winston, right? She was wearing a cotton nightgown -- thank you -- and she had a half a pack of smokes on her end table, which means she was probably smoking a cigarette.
Best part: Toxicology sample came back. Nadine had a high concentration of seconal in her blood.
Enough to knock out a horse.
All right.
We wait.
Yeah, we're disproving spontaneous human combustion. We dressed the pig up in a cotton dress and torched it with a cigarette.
The pig's been reduced to ash. The fat acted like candle wax; burned hot, slow and intense. 
Nothing spontaneous about it.
Of course.
The what?
Well, you can show your appreciation by, uh, cleaning up.
Two victims. She's on the sidewalk, a foot from the curb and he's in the middle of the street.
No car.
Well, rain screwed up all our chances of a good DNA profile.
You see him?
Well, that's why you got the badge and I got the syringe. 
I'm casting the stab wounds. From the molds, we can identify the murder weapons.
Did you want me to give Gris a message?
Forget Shepherd's wife. I can't match the slash marks. It's all about these stab wounds. So I concentrated on Kevin Shepherd.
Cool.
Well, I measured all the sharp points of entry on Kevin's body.
They're all identical. They're all made from the same murder weapon.
Identified murder weapon number one. Now we just need that second murder weapon.
Yeah, who stabs someone with a blunt instrument?
Yeah.
So he started with Kevin and then he went after Jessica and then the tip broke off.
Oh, yeah. I got three prints on this gearshift and they are beauties.
The images are printing.
So Jessica Hall was the last person to drive the shepherds' suv.
Lucky for us the rain missed that.
Who else had a flowing wound?
Man, why are you always trying to put me down?
All right, I'm bleeding from my abdomen.
Why would she do that?
By the positioning of her wound, I'd say it looked like her stabbing was an accident.
No. 
He just said check his clothes. Drying room. Six years in the job and it still freaks me out in here.
Yeah.
Here we go. Here we go. Justin Green. The eyewitness.
Here's another thing the rain ruined -- the blood pattern on Justin's jacket.
That looks like a handprint.
Right hand. Justin's?
So, it's not Justin's.
Holding down Kevin's feet.
So, whose handprint is that?
Yeah, but Kevin grabbed Justin's shirt so that means he was still breathing.
Whew. Curveball.
From?
Yes, that's affirmative. I can trump that. Wednesday, 3:00 P.M. Justin called Amy Shepherd.
I'm all over it like a cheap suit.
You see this spiderweb?
I'm sorry. Your ticker okay?
Right here.
Kind of hard to get a baby out of a window climb onto a ladder without messing up this web, don't you think?
What you got?
Ah. The plot thickens.
I smell these dirty diapers over here.
Probably used to clean that diaper pail.
Baby was killed before it even left the house. Guy tried to cover his tracks.
Yeah, this mold I made of that shoe print matches the gardener's boot that I found in the shed over there.
And a gardener's boot in a garden is not out of place. Well, the Andersons did say the guy's been out of town on vacation for the last three days.
Get those dogs back. Get them back!
Hey.
I got the hair samples from the baby's crib ready for comparison.
Well, DNA's jammed. Sanders says he'll get to the blood comparisons ...
... as soon as ...
I thought I'd deliver this in person. DNA came back on the entire family.
Okay, this is the 911 call from the Anderson house at 4:30 A.M.
You wouldn't think so but I went ahead and separated out any underlying voices.
She was standing, like, two meters from the phone.
I know, so I checked to see if she was, like, faking her concern. This program measures the stress level of the speakers.
The stress is real.
A little.
Well, I did backtrack and there were no other calls that night from the Anderson house-- from the land line, or from the cell phone.
Yeah. All right, I'll get into it.
I was just coming to meet you guys. I thought you were at the Andersons.
What?
Guys, the mother didn't do it.
Listen.
People walk every day because of you.
Yeah.
No. I'm having a block party. I marked it where I found it -- over on the sidewalk over there.
So, Brian takes a walk crosses the street, doesn't hear the car, gets creamed.
You know what that means -- smackdown -- the kid was in a fight.
Was he having any difficulties?
Dr. Gilbert, we're just following protocol. We need to speak with Brian's friends; his roommates. 
But we're here now, and evidence is time-sensitive.
Hey.
Yeah, we didn't have a warrant, so she kicked us out.
She was kind of hostile.
The roommate's here.
Do you know what Grissom drinks when he goes out at night?
Exactly. Who knows anything about that guy? Hey, check that out. 
Brain printing. They call it a visual polygraph.
Yeah, back in '97 Grissom and I used one to interview this rapist. The guy was mute but his brain waves spoke loud and clear.
... then the oscillator will give him away.
Those the tire treads from the crime scene?
Any hits?
Yeah.
Checking out the dead guy's clothes.
Whoa. What are these?
They look like lice.
Wasn't our dead guy clean?
Well, he was in a fight, right? Maybe his attacker had lice and they crawled off on his sweater and they got comfy and the stray hair blew away.
You know anything about lice?
Little problem no one talks about, huh?
Yeah. Right behind you.
Why? What did you do? Let me guess. You ran a DNA profile on the blood from the dead guy's knuckles and you got a match.
You made it out of bed and you dressed yourself?
So what does that give us?
So the guy's a glow-stick. How does that help us track him down?
A suspect?
Hmm.
Creepy critters in the driver's seat.
You just don't like other women in his life.
Affirmative on the head lice.
Adam Walkey doesn't have lice?
Same as the blood we found on Brian's knuckle.
It's just like Dr. Gilbert said ... the killer came from out here.
That's the muffler. And this is the back of the car.
There's no way this car was moving forward when it ran over Brian Clemonds' body.
All right, Guy?
Look at those wounds.
Yeah. From what I hear they carved out a piece of this valley when they made the park. 
Some mountain lion probably didn't like getting relocated. Mountain lions are brutal.
So, Doc, how big of a cat are we actually dealing with here?
Yeah, but I bet Grissom did.
This sucks! 
But it's evidence, right?
Yeah, it's somebody's doody.
How do you figure that?
Seminar?
Julie. Oh ... a CSI should not be that fine.
What is that?
Yeah, well, I'm taking it into evidence.
Yeah, well ... we'll see.
Only thirty more jars to go. 
This is rough, man. We should be pulling better cases by now. Millionaire murders, casino heists.
Uh, we're supposed to like scat patrol?
Yeah. 
Just coming to see you. You remember that ice we found at the crime scene?
It didn't melt. It evaporated.
The jogger was missing some organs.
It just so happens the dog's owner is a doctor.
Yeah.
Gris, can I show you something?
Surgery equipment. Emory Medical Supplies, Boston, Mass., 1875. 
Antiques.
Exactly. What I find interesting is that she keeps them near the door, not in the office. In case she needs to break out and go do some work.
She gives me the willies.
Yeah, well, maybe we can link these to the crime. Her dog may have eaten that jogger but he can't harvest the organs.
Yeah. You want to hand me those filter papers right there?
So we got the right dog. Well, let's see if the owner cut the vic up. 
Reactive agents. One part leuko-malachite. 
One part hydrogen peroxide -- used by blondes everywhere. 
Blue.
What's that?
... turns the swab blue.
If the jogger's blood is in any of this stuff, we need to find it now.
I'm ready, Nick. You want to hit the lights?
Why would she do that?
I'd place a bet on it.
Mr. Moore.
I think James called me tonight because he thought I could help him.
James is all right but, uh, there was a big brawl at the detention center. James was at the wrong place at the wrong time.
If he talks, he'll be dead inside a month. Now, if he keeps quiet, the D.A. will put the squeeze on him. He'll probably end up in the big house you could lose your boy forever then.
He probably knew what your advice would be. To do the honorable thing.
Not without a price. Look, a crime occurred. CSI's got full jurisdiction. I got myself assigned to the case. I'll see if I can take James out of the middle.
Why don't you tell me?
That's a lot of education in a short time, huh?
James, why don't you take a deep breath and tell me what happened here.
Whose side I'm on? Who reached out to you, man?
James, I'm trying to help you.
So it's your life versus time.
Nothing surprises me anymore.
Step back for Warrick.
Whew!
Whew!
Impressive.
Yeah. Son of a bitch was crafty -- I'll give him that. Melted the end of the toothbrush to insert the razor blade.
Concealment.
Yeah. Now all I got to do is put this shank in someone's hand.
Where's his attorney?
Where's your lawyer?
How's your plaque?
Your teeth. I mean, how many toothbrushes does a guy need? 
Apparently, for you it's as many as it takes to make the perfect shank.
Yeah.
The evidence will testify for you. Ronnie Connors ... bought a toothbrush and some rubber bands at the commissary. He didn't know it but that's the last shank he'll ever make.
Before he made the shank he shaved with the same razor. His DNA was all over the blade.
It's not me you have to thank.
I thought you said we were grabbing a beer.
Grissom, you know, this is your thing. 
Cleanses me? 
Whatever happened to my evaluation?
Oh, yes!
Peeping toms to murderers?
Nobody move. 
Mr. Clean needs a maid. I'm going to take this back to the lab.
What's up?
And you got a match microscopically but it doesn't mean a damn thing
Whoa, whoa, whoa. A girl defending herself against a guy is going to pull that hair out by the roots. 
I mean, you get scalp skin filled with DNA.
... shed?
Mine.
Shedding. He's trying to throw us off. What he doesn't realize, we got no DNA on the hairs so we can't chase down his other suspect.
Is there's no one you can appeal to?
Come on, this guy's on the loose and there's nothing you can do?
I got Audrey Hayes, but those fibers we found in the Snow lady's throat aren't going to give us anything. White cotton fibers are like oxygen -- they're everywhere ...
If you can't prove uniqueness, prove abundance.
Yeah.
Well, I went back Audrey Hayes' apartment and I paid particular attention to the point of entry. I found a small persistence of white cotton fibers.
Well, I remember what you said about signature guys and how they have low self-esteem. They're always going to the gym to work out so I'm thinking gym towels.
So ... I went back to see if any of them had tried out introductory offers.
But you do have to sign in. 
All three women went to Strong's Gym once in the last three months. So, I'm going back there, grab some towels bring them back to the lab see if I can get a match from the crime scene fibers.
Will do.
Aw, that's cool. We don't need props. At the end of the day, we know what time it is. 
Right behind you.
Yeah. Picture that.
I know.
Too many. One thing I can't stand is a punk coward.
You want me to take this case alone?
Oh, I'm fine. I'm ... I'm looking after you. 
It's made me think of who I am to my partners, you know?
You keep on busting on me, you won't see any kind of leaf.
Vehicle's humming down Rochester. The vic was on her scooter, heading eastbound. Car brakes here ...
... impact here. The vic was thrown -- what-- twenty meters?
Yeah.
Looks like a four and a J.
Not like he left us any evidence.
I'll get them to cross-check this partial within a five-mile radius see how many hits they come up with. You'll have those pictures for me?
All right.
We believe it may have been involved in a traffic collision earlier this evening.
You're going to be charged with manslaughter, Mr. Moore. Felony hit-and-run. Do you have a lawyer?
Catherine, I just got off the phone with the traffic guys. They've impounded Moore's car. Should be here any minute.
Old guy was scared.
Our car's here.
How tall you do you think Mr. Moore is?
Old people must love hugging that steering wheel 'cause this seat is pushed all the way forward.
Oh!
Oh ... well, I'm six feet and this mirror isn't helping me at all.
Why?
Whoo!
This?
It's good stuff.
Yeah.
Does anybody else drive your car, Mr. Moore?
So, James you like Mos Def?
James you want to add anything to that?
Will you please escort Mr. Moore back to his cell?
Like I know my middle name. Well, let's go back to the car and find the proof.
What?
And what-- forget about little Renda Harris?
Hey, you don't think I'm feeling this? But we got to follow the evidence even if we don't like where it takes us.  It's the job.
Hey, we start making deals with the devil and you don't get to walk away. You understand what I'm saying?
What you got?
My Aunt Bertha could tell, and she's legally blind.
A forensic investigation, sir.
James ... you have a chipped tooth? Must be an incisor, or we would have noticed.
Hey... why don't you run on home? I'll handle this.
Your daughter gets out of school in a half hour, right?  Why do you want to pick a fight with me now?
Don't think I won't collect.
Hold on. James ... the first couple days are going to be the toughest. Here. 
Here's my cell number. You run into any problems you call me. I'll be right there. All right? Keep your head up.
My day.  Reminds me of my grandmother. Yeah, I gave her a lot of rough nights, too. She used to call me her work in progress.
Maybe.
I got a court date ... straight off of graveyard. It sucks.
Well, evidence vault opens in five. 
Hey, Judge. What's going on? I'm due in your court.
Well, nobody told me.
Judge, I thought we were even. How much longer am I under your thumb?
Damn. I knew you were in tight.
Just like that? 
We got a slam dunk on a three-time rapist and he's just going to walk?
I'm already on probation.
Yeah, I feel you back there, believe me.
I need to see the Henderson Rape case 4217.
Thanks, Mike.
Uh, damn case was continued. Clerk never called.
Nature of the beast.
Party?
More money, more problems.
Thanks.
I appreciate it.
Hey, Grissom.  You got a second? Uh, I'm in purgatory. Need some guidance.
Judge ... Warrick. Listen, uh, I got a little problem. No, I can't talk about it over the phone. We got to meet in person. There's something in the evidence I think you should see. Good.
Let me guess. Radiohead or Rage against the machine.
Right.
Oh, he's working that Wendy Barger case -- you know, the floater?
Only clue he's got is a missing boat which sucks, 'cause ... it's missing.
It's a simulation tank. He's re-creating the conditions the night she died. Body was dumped, like, a half mile from Calville Bay. They think the boat must have drifted with the currents.
Well, you know Grissom. Shortest distance between two points is science. And for Catherine, it's pounding the pavement.
Yeah. Something came up. See you.
I need some assurances.
I checked out the evidence, yeah. But I'm not sure about the rest.
Why don't you let me do that?
I told you ... nobody owns me.
Hey. 
Hey, Cath.
Yeah. Fine. Thanks for letting Brass handle it.
Yeah. That's what I'm afraid of.
Yeah, I know.
It's a long way out in the sticks just to drop dead.
He was looking over his shoulder when he was running. Think there was somebody else here?
Can I get this taped off here?
So you want to call it? How do you think he died?
Cool.
Can't make a ruling? Look at the bruise marks on John Doe here. I call that suffocation.
I'm going to take a mouth swab.
What the maggots?
Entomology is our friend.
Sorry, little buddy. 
Scalpel.
Talk about pulp fiction. 
It's all yours, doc. 
Fire up that gas chromatograph mass spectrometer thing, will you?
Cool.
No, I'm off that. 
I haven't made a bet in a month. I can't say I don't have that itch, though.
Hey, boss, I got something for you. 
I did the whole tox-the-maggots thing like you said. Found jimsonweed in their blood.
Jimsonweed in Eric's blood.
Really? Cite your sources.
I thought Brass just said that they weren't doing any drugs.
Yeah.
Fruit juice, half ice.
Or legal, for that matter.
Did you take the drug, too?
Did you get a stamp when you got in?
Well, mostly they use water-resistant pads so you don't sweat it off. Could you hit the lights, Gris?
Where did they stamp you? 
Yeah, that's DJ Masterband's stamp. He is the spinner in Vegas right now. Must have been playing at the rave these two were at.
The free papers, yeah. They have ads for all sorts of raves.
Gris, I got the prelims back on that swab I took off of our desert guy. Products trapped in nasal hairs.
Products found in mouth and nose: Mentholated nose spray, patchouli and aluminum.
Patchouli -- they burn it at music stores.
Yeah. I got trace putting together a list of products made with the stuff. Something tells me that's not lemonade.
Doesn't look like tea, either.
What's that?
Does that apply to our case?
Cheers.
Who?
It's ecstasy. It makes everyone fall in love. 
Don't take it personally, miss. He's kind of married to his job.
Come on. Let's go.
Now we just tie that to the dealer.
That's not what you were saying out at that rave all up in that guy's face.
The chemical compositions break down exactly the same.
Square one.
Thought I'd find you here.
Evidence ... a double-edged sword. 
How do you feel about this?
You don't really believe that, do you?
Dead.
I'll catch you later.
Hey, guys. This came back for the test on aluminum products from our kid in the desert.  Fireworks.
But you guys have never taken j-weed before so you weren't aware of the side effects of photophobia.
Photophobia. It's just a big word for lights freaking you out. You guys were hallucinating and whatever Eric was seeing was scaring him, big-time.
The coroner states that Eric's dose shot his temperature through the roof. He was boiling in his own skin. So he stripped which is why we found him naked.
We found traces of aluminum trapped in Eric's nostrils that are consistent with what we found in your client's hands and arms earlier today from his job at the fireworks plant.
Where you going?
I'll take a piece of that.
Will do. 
Picture that.
Officer Tyner.
Want to tell us what happened here tonight?
Why don't you tell us what happened here.
Officer, we're going to need your weapon, as well.
It's just standard procedure.
Were there any witnesses?
We're going to need to seal off this lot.
The officer told me a fleeing suspect committed suicide. I'm just verifying his account. You know how this works, Brass. Can we clear the jeep so I can do my job?
Can we get back to work?
Why would a guy speed it all the way down the strip just to pull over and cap himself?
Officer's weapon: Smith and Wesson 5906.
One bullet missing. Nothing standard about that.
I don't give a damn what Brass likes.
Yeah, it's war.
Can anyone confirm your story?
Do you? 
We're just having a talk with Officer Tyner here.
Five civilian complaints -- three for excessive force. Two I.A. investigations.
I'm sure you were.
I guess it's a good thing I sealed off that crime scene.
Bullets just don't disappear.
Have you talked to the police?
We're Crime Scene Investigators. We need to know what you saw.
And, just like that, the officer fired?
What thing?
Oh, good. Um ... we just put some stuff through the lab.
I was just about to.
If you want me to suave anyone, I got to know the shot.
She's trying to tell you Eddie likes it rough.
That's how you think I work?
What's he doing here?
Oh, you mean dealing with punk-ass cops who hide behind their union reps?
You're just a psycho! You don't deserve a badge!
It's not in the body. It's not at the crime scene. I like our odds.
Yeah. We've searched every piece of metal. 
Spare tire.
The tire sucked up the bullet and the treads covered its tracks.
There's a match.
We got Tyner. One bad cop going down.
So, check it out ... the laser is the path of the bullet. If you were Officer Tyner and you approached the suspect from the driver's side of the vehicle ... 
The laws of physics trump the eye witness. There's only one way this could've gone down.
Officer Tyner was telling the truth.
We work. We get paid. You don't owe me anything.
Media have it right? Four dead?
You got it.
I checked the sprinkler system. It goes off every night at zero-two hundred .
So somebody came out of the house and got on what looks to be a step down from a motorcycle and drove it across the lawn.
How's that hand?
I saw you beating up the door a little while ago. You all right?
Damn!
You need to tell somebody when you're cutting the lights.
Grissom, you remember those tire treads ... I found on the front lawn?
Well, I ran them through the FBI register and they belong to a '93
I DMV'd it. A kid four blocks away from the scene owns the same make.
I might have just blown open the case and all you give me is a that's very good?
Yeah.
Lady Macbeth?
The tire treads from the scooter place you at the scene of the murders.
Tina's parents? So you know Tina Collins?
You mean sexually?
Where's your scooter now?
We got about four just on the tire prints alone. Homicide's grabbing them up.
Let me take a look.
I see.
Well, if you believe what you hear in the halls - Ecklie.
I'm with you there.
Just taking a little coffee break.
Same guy?
Oh, me and him, working together? Oh, it's on.
Everyone still breathing in that car?
Where's the driver? He get thrown?
You calling it?
How you know it's from the car?
After you ...
More like 80.
Who?
So your drunk driver just got out and ran away?
Where to?
Then how do you explain car number two?
Not if we have these. 
They're kind of out of place. A walking stride up to the edge.
No. This is a crime, not an accident.
How much?
I don't get out of bed for less than a bill.
Tan lines, no watch and no ring.
Must have been one hell of a fall to knock his watch and his ring off ... 
... and take his money. 
So what do you say? Do you want to up the stakes another hundred? 
Say my foul play against your phantom driver?
Supergluing the entire car? It's a little excessive, don't you think?
You know, I checked with six different medical centers, and no phantom driver at any of them.
Las Vegas cell phone. PD's putting a name to it.
What's all this?
To ... ?
Makes sense.
You find his watch and ring?
my pockets are getting fat!
God, you see all that money in there?
Yeah.
What's the mysterious news?
What do you think?
So ... who's your phantom driver?
Man, it's a rental. Those prints are probably older than you are.
You giving up?
You want to take it to three?
Tan lines where his ring and watch used to be. On vacation in Vegas, but no money in his wallet. His face all bruised up before he took that cliffside tumble. Damn right, I think he was robbed.
I don't think the robber expected Banglor to get drunk and go crash his car. He probably freaked and put him in the back seat trying to fool me into thinking someone else was driving. But he only fooled you.
What about it?
Maybe. There's other questions to answer first.
Footprints and tire tracks.
You love me. Who you kidding?
Finally.
Size 11.
I needed to be sure.
You want me to clack that jaw, make you go nigh-nigh?
Pirelli low profile p-zeros. High performance.
Any reported stolen?
Check this. One-to-one says that's the car.
You got his clothes?
What are you doing? His laundry?
Ah.
What's that?
Banglor shooting stick -- I'll give you that. Burping bourbons --
... Bentley thief flags him down ... 
... spooks him into a skid ... boom, crash! 
He's robbed ... forced into the back ... pushed over the edge. 
With Banglor out of the way, the thief gets in his stolen Bentley ... hightails it out of there. No watch ... no rings, no cash ... stolen Bentley tire treads, converse all-star size 11 ... all bases covered. Victim, suspect, crime scene. Like a canary ... it sings.
I was sitting here thinking the same thing about your phantom driver.
Yeah. 
I'm Warrick ... NICK: I'm Nick ...
Actually, sir, I-I don't think it was an accident. I think you were robbed and any information that you remember about your attacker would be very helpful.
You mean you got hustled?
So buckling up ... really did save your life. You know that?
You get well, okay?
And the Bentley thief, size 11-- he could've been at that crime scene anytime last week. So we push on the bet? No winner?
You're talking to the wrong guy.
What do we know about the dead guy?
All this damage by one guy? Had to be on drugs.
Yeah.
Nice snow job.
What guy?
Well, alcohol does different things to different people ... at different altitudes.
And where was your husband?
Right. Where were you?
This is incredible. Ten people and no one's talking. My theory: The killer is in the group and the rest of them are afraid.
It all comes down to shoeprints.
Mr. Cash.
So, what did you see?
Sitting ringside, how do you not see what happened?
That's Lou.
Max.
That's Nate.
We need you to tell us everything you heard from the time the deceased banged on the cockpit door to the time he died.
Mile high club.
The stewardess.
Yeah, whatever. You're henpecked anyway.
Now, Lou, in 4B, said he was the peacemaker.
A CD swipe across the chops.
Yeah, go ahead, honey. Save my life.
Saved Nick's butt, as usual.
And, according to Preston, Max and Lou they got to Candlewell first.
He's messing with my man, so I get my licks in.
But they didn't let him.
Let it go, guys.
It's out of our hands. Our field ruling was overturned by the good old Sheriff and the Feds.
Oh, you think this is about justice?
I'm not discounting it. I mean, think about it -- is there anyplace more vulnerable than being at thirty thousand feet in a tin can?
Because their lives were threatened.
Human nature again. I mean, adrenaline doesn't come with an off switch.
If it was between him or me, I could. Nick?
See? We have four people here, all with different opinions. Think of how the passengers must have felt.
Well, if that's your stance how could it have been prevented?
A heroin addict's confetti. Nothing like going on a binge.
Black tar heroin. This is the difference between a Cadillac and a Pinto.
It's my job.  I count at least six balloons, and that's just in the bedroom. The dealer must have come down the chimney. It's like Christmas in July here.
Not that Braun even needed any more drugs.
I can get a print off the air.
Have you seen Brass?
Oh. Print off air. Orange balloon. Cyanoacrylate. Dead bang, drug dealer.
You're Braun's grocery store.
Xanax?
Okay, three rolls of tape found in the truck owned by Curt Ritten.
No match!
'Cause he was smart. In the past 20 years the value of silver's gone to nothing and a commodity broker's going to charge you a storage fee per troy ounce and there's only one thing worse than losing seven to eight percent on silver a year and that's losing nine to ten percent because of some stupid storage fee.
Depends on who's doing the clipping.
Oh, we got a positive association. Roll to tape. Curt to Tony.
How can this be, Mandy? We found the duct tape in the guy's truck.
This thing must have a virus.
Well, that's easy for you to say. All you do is scan prints all day and hit enter.
See what I mean?
Bet Walt wasn't too happy about that. It's 50-50 going 75-25 the wrong way.
A slash? Acting supervisor? What about Nick? He's got seniority. Or Sara -- she'd jump at the chance.
And if I ask why?
Hang on! Have you told NICK and SARA about this?
Hey.
Yeah, I'm sorry, I got detained. I guess you did a one-to-one on these treads already?
Put together an evidence list?
You've got to do it.
Ah, I don't think so. I got to go back with the body. Sara, can you get back to the lab and put a rush on this analysis?
He's not exactly dead.
Anything you want to say?
Side roads. So ... this is our con artist?
Did it tell you anything?
Well. Probably when he was getting into the car.
He knew the driver.
You got any pictures of that?
Whoa.
Can you fish that out for me?
Wait a minute. 
There's something in his stomach.
How many more are there?
He's a mule. Why is a guy trafficking in big-pay drugs wasting his time on some nickel-and-dime chip scam?
It's great if you're a mule transporting drugs into the states.
We found balloons of cocaine in his stomach cavity.
Then he went out and got shot.
What?
No, what's strange is going into the evidence locker after post and not finding anything left.
If it was your job, you couldn't feel bad.
It's my case. Tonight, I'm the primary. I have to process it. If you have a problem with that, you can clock out now. Am I clear?
It couldn't be.
Hey.
You have a daughter?
Her prints came up on airline stubs relating to tonight's homicide.
Ellie Rebecca Brass. DOB 9/24/82. Essex County, New Jersey. Last known address 554 Applegate Way.
Well, I've got to bring her in. You know that.
You're hands off.
Just go right in here.
Excuse me?
Yeah.
It's a dummy chip. No casino logo.
So, you two fly down to Baja, pose as a married couple brought back home a stomach load of blow and then you run chip scams? Who's taking your drug profits?
Yeah, she was passing pellets of cocaine.
With your permission, we need to take some x-rays.
And what is his name?
His name.
You were behind the glass. This evidence against your daughter doesn't look good.
She mules drugs for a guy who ends up dead ten hours later? A BS chip scam, a lousy alibi?
Brass. It's a big city. Boyfriend could disappear. But, hey, it's your kid.
So you gave up your drugs to your boss, huh?
Do you realize every time you ingest one of those pellets that you risk dying from an overdose?
So you can just not eat?
I don't think I can handle this. I got to call Grissom.
But?
I heard it, bro -- a but in there.
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
Sack up.
Treasury department?
Counterfeit?
What money?
On a federal case?
Hold up. I'm dealing with something.
Well, I'm not Grissom!
Sara, brief Special Agent Beckman on the funny money. Nick, the garage.
Proves one thing. This was the getaway car used in the murder.
We printed the vehicle your client was found driving. It puts the car at the scene of Vincent Avery's murder less than twelve hours ago.
Bought tickets for Victor Avery as well.
Vega?
We got bad news from the garage.
The tire evidence puts Ellie's car at the murder scene. We'll be pressing charges, murder of Vincent Avery.
Maybe so, but we don't have Driscoll.
Vega had to turn him loose after your gun episode.
That's what you cops think.
Grissom's office. CSI ... Warrick speaking.
Officer-involved shooting? Who?
Excuse me?
Ecklie, you're day shift. And you're here because ... 
Yeah, picture that.
What the hell happened?
There's one round missing.
Fifteen bullets left in brass's gun. There should be sixteen.
Hey. Look where I just located this blood? Back of the grip.
Slide bite. Man, Brass didn't shoot this guy.
I need you to show me your hands.
Your hands, Captain.
I'm going to need to take your badge.
Detective Vega.
They're nothing alike.
What, is she adopted?
What about the blood on Brass's gun?
Not Ellie's? 
With a pinch on his hand. All right. Where's that manifest?
Vincent Avery ...
Two-zero-three-four ... two-zero-three-four...
Marty Gillmore.
Game's over, Marty.
You know this guy?
You conned the captain. I got to shake your hand.
No, on the real.
You shot Driscoll ... ...with his firearm.
So you off'ed Driscoll to take over his drug op. What about Ellie?
You eat something?
Oh, god, he's going to OD. Can we get a medic?
Can we get a medic?
Brass?!
Brass. Hang on. 
I only took it to get Ellie's DNA off of it. That's it. 
We were checking out the blood from your gun. We compared your DNA to her DNA.
You never said anything about her being adopted.
Hey, Sara.
Hey ... I'm a little short on cash. Can you loan me a hundred?
Hey, Griss. How'd it go?
Well, the job is fine. It's the other stuff -- the personalities. 
Is that Einstein?
Charlie Brown. Figures. Is that why you put me in charge?
Yeah, you said A Ghost. 
From the top?
I don't know where to start. It was wild.
Hey, Cath... are you on this Fairmont case?
You know the Fairmont house was one of my first calls three years ago?
Shots fired. He shot himself while he was cleaning his gun.
Yeah. And after hearing about tonight I'm wondering if that's what really happened. I'm going to pull his file and check it out.
I will.
In this reinactment, Fairmont shot himself while cleaning his gun? In this reenactment the story just doesn't add up. I think I fell for it because I was new and I wasn't too eager to talk to another guy about him almost shooting off his manhood. 
This is the room as it was then based off of my crime scene photos. This is crime scene reconstruction, new school. Works backward, reverse time. 
The bullet hit here.
The only logical place for that bullet to have been shot from is four meters away, one meter high. He didn't actually shoot himself. Someone shot him.
I'm presenting this case to the D.A., even if it is three years old.
I already did. 28 years old, blonde, blue eyes, 125 pounds, five-six ... sound familiar? 
Uniform's talking to a neighbor. Donna is Joan's older sister.
Genetics. House belonged to their mother. Donna's lived here alone since their mother died. Joan lived in Henderson. The real action's around back.
If the highway was the dump site, this is the primary.
No doubt. I'm going to collect the glass. And then I'll start with the doorframe.
You're the puzzle guy.
So the side that kissed up to the tin will fluoresce under UV.
I got some imprints on these blood spots here. 
Looks like the killer may have stepped in Donna's blood.
Hmm. That would place Joan at the house.
Hey.
Still putting it together. I'm just doing a trace on Donna Marks' clothing and I came across this fiber. Look at this cross section.
Yeah, short and coarse. Car upholstery?
Well, it's from black upholstery. What color was the boyfriend's missing thunderbird?
Really? What about the blood from Joan Marks' shoe?
Hey. Point of impact. It's, uh ...  ... sixty-... five inches from the base.
Well, Donna was five-six. If she was thrown through that glass, the point of impact would've been lower closer to the ground.
Are you saying it was an accident?
Thanks.
Hey. Is it true? Millander?
Yeah, what's up with that?
Well, I got some mud prints. Check these out.
He must've taken off his boots before he stepped in. 
Check out the depth of the impression compared to mine.
Shoot it.
Who flagged it?
Yeah, but how would Millander know that the guy who'd pick him up had a birthday August 17, 1957?
I found some G.S.R.
That's why Grissom didn't find a bullet.
It went out the window.
I'm going to call Nick, tell him we found out what that unidentified whir sound was -- the window going down.
We were thinking Millander posed as a hitchhiker overpowered Walker, and then faked a gunshot in the car.
No, he carried him into the warehouse.
Drives the same route all the time?
Maybe he wanted to confess. Take her to the body.
So what do we do now?
So, who's worth one mil?
State troopers just spotted Logan's car on the 582. Drove past him earlier this morning. Five minutes later, drove past him again other direction.
Looks like some kind of glow paint stick. I think Catherine dragged her heels a little bit here.
You mean like helium for balloons? You can also use it to change the pitch in your voice.
Then why hasn't Catherine contacted us yet?
She ate, but she didn't fall asleep till way late. We had her helping Greggo out in the lab.
Yeah.
Watch your step.
All right.
Looks more like a slice. Could've happened when he cut through her finger.
Does this look like blood to you?
Yeah.
With what?
Great.
Hey, Nick?
Have you been eating peanut butter in the layout room?
Well, we found it on the back of that shower curtain.
I need to take my car to this detailer. Not bad.
Two problems. His wife is going to leave him, take half his money and he was going to jail.
He knew he'd get hauled in to the cops.
So, he left these wine glasses for you to find.
A million dollars. Pretty tempting.
He didn't. He probably thought the bank marked it.
I hear Grissom goes there all the time. Like even on his nights off.
Oh, that's so not cool. That's a community fridge.
Way to go, Nick. You really told him.
Yeah.
That's it.
You think? Neighbor called it in. She smelled the smoke. Thought he was barbecuing in his living room.
Over there talking to Brass.
What up, doc? Oh, there you are.
Oh, it's all good. I'm just starting my walk-through.
There's a burn pattern for you. Fire burns upward. This is moving downward.
Check out the upstairs?
How do you know it's a guy? Why are you jumping the gun?
Yeah, that sounds like Sara.
It's the point of origin.
I don't smell any accelerant.
I don't know. It doesn't make any sense. A fire burning downward?
Furniture polish.
Oh, man. Something bad happened here.
Yeah?
A thousand points of light and I only need one to clear up this picture. The blur equals the length of the light. 
If I can compress this light back into a point then the rest of the picture gets clear. That's how they got Hinkley's image when he was shooting the prez.
Yeah, I think so.
Maybe his good hand was otherwise engaged. I'm going to work on that for a while and see if I can get some ridge detail. Maybe even a fat print.
There you are. I got something for you from trace.
Sara?
They isolated the accelerant used in the fire. It's alcohol based. 
Guess that's the six percent no one talks about. Female fire starters.
Greg, this is an abuse case involving a minor.
I'm still trying to enhance it. It's kind of frustrating, that, uh this picture puts us at the very moment of the crime but we can't see what she's seeing.
Yeah, my grandma used to say that all the time.
Well, maybe ... if I enhanced the reflection in her eye with the right combination of algorithms ...
Hey.
Back burner. I've been working on this reflection in her eye. You see what I'm seeing?
Come on, man. I've been working on this enhancement all night. Look closer.
Yeah. These pictures were taken on a boat.
Miss Bradley.
Warrick Brown. Your fianc√©, Mike, did he own a boat?
No? Did he borrow one or rent one?
Your ex-husband owned a boat?
Okay. Thank you.
Catherine.
Found it on the boat. DNA just ran it. She's under 14, right?
Whoo! There's a winner.
Yeah, after somebody wiped them down. Paramedics?
Just pronounced? 
He tied himself off.
All the signs of an O.D ... without any of the paraphernalia.
Coltrane, huh?
See if I can get this back to Gregor at the lab. He could tell us what we're dealing with. Two coasters, one glass?
Forgot this on the way out.
Whoa, whoa ... miss, you can't come in here.
I'm sorry, he's dead.
Miss ... why don't we step outside for a minute?
Potential killer?
Don't tell us you're wearing our evidence.
Mannitol-- that's that baby laxative used to cut heroin with.
91%? No wonder the guy O.D.'D. That's a death sentence.
Unless you're looking to kill someone.
Yeah, that victim was out of L.A. and I don't think the singer, Lillie met him before last night, so she may be in the clear.
: Right ... like you're going to take dumpster duty alone.
Man, I don't even know if I'm going there the odds haven't gone my way in a long time.
Same difference.
We're just doing our jobs here.
We won't know till we print you.
Well, that's fine. That's not the issue. You tampered with the evidence.
Could have lost your job.
So, you cleaned him up, threw away his works ... why Lillie's scarf?
Lillie's scarf was there?
Really? You mind rolling up your sleeves for us?
Thanks.
I don't like playing in front of an audience.
No, I just came by to ask you a few questions and I got a little carried away.
So, um, how well do you know these people you play with?
I thought I was the one asking questions here.
Warrick Brown.
So, that's what you're all about?
Then run.
Sounds like you're pretty dependent on him.
Great.
I don't know about all that.
I already do make a difference.
You do.
So ... knock 'em dead.
You're here.
New lead. The bartender. Purple.
Test for opiates.
Purple. You know what that means.
He sandwiched the drugs between the coasters. That's how he hid it. He was dealing from behind the bar.
When we found those two coasters in Stan Grevey's dressing room, we assumed that there was two people -- either a user or supplier. There weren't. Just our guy -- the victim.
What's wrong? 
What do you mean?
Yeah?
So what? There could be a hundred reasons why she ...
We got the dealer -- the bartender. Let's just take him out.
: What about her? Why don't you ... Why don't you just let me handle my business.
We know he's not the only guy you dealt it to.
Bad batch?
No.
I'm going to meet Lillie. I'll see you back at the lab. Okay? You don't know me.
You hiding from me?
Yeah.  I wanted to talk to you.
Yeah, you're right.
I'm sorry, Lillie. Life's too short. Good-bye.
What are you doing here?
Relax. They said it'd be here.
Well, that's why we have computer tracking. Fourteen ... it was fifteen, right?
Stephanie Watson, right?
Yeah? We all have a past, huh?
What exactly are we looking for?
Well, I'd start with this.
Hey.
Here's the good news. Look at his hands. The cut on his left index finger -- it's just like the evidence log says.
Kelso's glove is not in any of the crime scene photos, any of the sketches, anywhere.
You see who logged it in?
Want me to tag along?
Kelso's glove -- embedded in the fabric-- dog hair. I isolated motor oil on the thumb and the rest of the stains were bloodstains. Kelso's, just like in the report.
You'd think, but you kind of put me on a wild snipe hunt so I tested for all biologicals, and I ran amylase and I found saliva.
Yeah.
Also amylase.
Results on Jimmy Tadero's sample. I just got it back from DNA.
Not going to take a look at it?
You want me to open it?
We're not running the show.
All right.
Cadets?
Let's roll.
There's no doubt that this bus body-checked this k-rail.
You've got that Sara look.
I got a theory. Grissom said the suspension gave on the bus, right? Broken rod arm.
Well, I'm thinking when that rod arm hit the pavement it made this great first impression here.
Crosses the highway slams into the k-rail.
Bus bounces off this k-rail ... 
... heads back towards us.
Yeah. Someone upstairs was looking out big-time.
Check this out.
Well, this one's sheared.
Three-quarter inch bolt. It matches the bolt on the specs for this suspension system. The hex head says it's a grade eight.
No, the bolts snapped midway through the skid after the bus hit the k-rail.
And the Camaro's skid marks place it behind the bus.
Until last night.
We have more questions about the accident but one thing we know: the suspension didn't hold.
We only care about the bolts.
The consequences of saving a buck.
Oh, that's original. What happened to slashing tires?
Right.
You know we need to document this for the journal of forensic science, right?
Yeah, this is the rear trailing tire of the crash bus. It has the same maintenance record as the tire that blew.
Gravity, huh?
Yeah. You used your left hand to prop yourself up. The perp may have done the same.
Warrick. Okay.  I'll be there.
Sara. She's at the print lab.  She needs me.
Checkmate.
So, why are you paging me?
Oh ... so he can drive a vehicle with over ten passengers.
Mm-hmm?
Well, I guess I'll grab a uniform and pay Mr. Maddox another visit.
Well, we're still going to need those maintenance records.
Thank you.
Sean Nolan was fired two months ago. Maddox says he's working in Barstow and since then three of Maddox's buses had blowouts. They all went through Barstow.
Yeah, only last night's bus had been serviced since Maddox changed suppliers.
Yeah, you do. See you.
Who wrote this?
Nick Stokes, Crime Stopper.
You went Hollywood on me, man.
Greg.
I do love a blond.
Hey, I wasn't done reading that.
How's that platinum blond coming?
Come on, Greg I'm not getting anything out of trace. I was hoping you could help me out here.
Not hair? Not human? What are you reading?
Bet I know someone who's hotter and I'm not talking about looks.
Yeah.
Watch your back.
Grissom, you got a second? I got a mystery.
Yeah.
Well, it's not a hair. It's a synthetic fiber. Glass-- what do you think, fiberglass?
This could be a lot of things.
What did your prom date say when you called her?
You think she's a suspect?
Stranger things have happened.
No.
No. You're tripping.
Change your password.
Warrick.
Fiberglass insulation -- comes in pink and yellow. But you already knew that. Is that why you're calling?
Yeah.
Hello. Hello? I-I can't hear you. H-hold on.
I can hardly hear you. We're at the, uh, satellite guy's house that installed Jane's cable.
Nick!
Patrol. Request immediate backup. Immediate backup. Officer down. I need emergency medical assistance! Eight-two-six ...
Nick! Nick.
But 's going to be all right?
Damn it. Grissom, this guy was right there. I could have had him.
Doesn't feel like the right thing.
I'm going with you.
Catherine thinks he might have got away with them. But, uh, Grissom did find some wacky video collection.
Yeah, relax, Ironside.
Gotten any clues as to where this guy might be?
He may know him well enough to read his e-mail.
Lunar Cable- a hundred and fifty channels.
They got this multiplex system -- there's eyes all over the place. There's eight floors, and four cameras per floor.
With all the stuff me and my boys got away with, it's probably why they have them now.
Well, hide and seek. Let's go.
How's this strap right here, is this tight enough?
How about this one? 
Well, you know, you can get cadets to do this, Cath. I mean, they're used to obstacle courses.
Yeah, well, it looks like a kill-and-dump to me. I mean, the guy waited for the coast to clear door to door, it's only ten meters ...
Yeah? Well, all right, after we find Paige.
Find anything interesting down there?
How's the smell, good?
What you got?
What floor are you on? 
Well, if the body was dumped it would've been moving pretty fast by then.
Oh, so as long as the students participate voluntarily we can use their DNA as we e fit.
The ole' Smart and Legal.
Hey, mouth boy, she's not going to kiss you. She just wants your DNA, okay?
Yeah, I know, I talked to the coach. Road trip.
I don't know. I just got here myself. Some homeless guy searching for hidden treasure finds a body. P.D.'S here on the scene. We got first looks.
Yeah.
I found some blood.
Driver tossed her in the dumpster to hide his crime.
Where you been?
I just left Sanders. The blood from the dumpster matches Paige.
We have sprayed, U.V.'D -- no hair, no fibers, no blood anywhere.
Oh, we've got tons of motives. Not a stitch of evidence.
Physics meets philosophy. 
Where are we going with this?
Nice try, Nostradamus.
Oh, yeah, I had to prop that open when Catherine rappelled down.
And there's no easy access here.
Whoo, man! It reeks in here. Who lives like this?
You think? So, what do we know?
Well, I can see why somebody would want to rob this place. I'll start in the bedroom.
We might want to reconsider burglary gone bad. I found a busted safe in the bedroom. Empty. I lifted prints.
Phew. Eau de cat.
Hey, guys.
Talked with O'Riley. The neighbor's alibi does check out. She was at her sister's in L.A. During the time of the murder.
Not so fast. I got another one. We have a match on that print that we found on the wall safe.
Yeah. He has a non-gaming work card. He's 45 years old. He was an electrician at the Tangiers from '97 to '99. His name is Tyler Elliot.
Victim's son. Only child.
The one day I'm due in court and you pull a drowning in the desert.
Oh, it went great. The judge recessed right before my testimony. I'm on call. Catherine's on call.
Well, you're making progress. The blood from the poolside matches the female victim.
Yeah.
Are you able to prove that he drowned her in their swimming pool?
What else did you collect from the scene?
Goose feather? This looks like basalt rock. Didn't it say somewhere in here that she found her at 1,500 feet?
Well, you can only find this rock at high altitudes like 4,000 feet.
Yeah.
Yeah. I went on this field trip up at table mountain in my senior year -- rocks for jocks. Don't ask me why I remember any of this.
Yeah.
I'll take the downstairs.
Brown.
Does she know about her father?
Well, I'd like to get started processing. Can you show me who you found?
Well, whoever this guy is, he's a lousy shot.
No, just evidence.
I got a pill. 
Looks like sedative.
Diazapam. Benzos..
Seems like a great place to ice someone.
Brown. 
I don't see this burgundy car. Where are you looking?
How did you find the disturbance? Drive up and down the canals all day?
Hey.
$500 for five dollars worth of honey? I don't think it's worth it.
I got a blood trail here. Leading to the garage.
He dragged the body to here ... 
... put her in that car.
This strike here. That one's all business.
Red. Is that our suspect?
Mm-hmm.
Looks like ginkwork. It's the kind of thing speed freaks do when they've been up for ten days straight and they've already taken apart the radio.
Shorthand?
You're not a control freak or anything?
Sara ... what's a homeless woman doing with a day planner and a $300 handbag?
Yeah.
I bought one for an ex-girlfriend once.
Just a couple of homeless guys.
Hey.
Yeah. Dangerous being a pretty girl in this town.
Hmmm.
What? You don't like cupcakes and candy bars?
Hey, Gris! Grissom!
I don't know.
Somewhere.
Maybe he wrote her a letter and left town. It's trash day.
It's on the street. It's fair game.
Photographic paper.
Is that why you tore up her photograph and tossed it in the trash?
Yeah, McBride clipped Rod Darling's right hand during his little hissy fit. Blood's his. And McBride's knife does not match these wounds.
Yeah. If other people inflicted as much torture as women inflict upon themselves, there would be lawsuits.
Greg-o, find any time between meals to check out Grissom's scrapings?
Yeah.
To Cassie, her sister.
Or your skin, or your hair or that zit on your forehead.
So you're saying she knew she was slipping.
So, really we're not talking about being beautiful at all.
Fourteen gram ... wait a minute. You're telling me that she weighed her bowels?
Well, that makes sense why the blood and skin under Ashleigh James's fingernails is a perfect match to Ashleigh James.
Also why Frank was so angry at Rod.
What happened to these girls?
Hey.
Good. I'm running it through AFIS right now. The good thing is that the jailhouse is a union gig and all the union guys are already in the database. What I did for the print was I lined up a ridge detail from the partial that I found on each handle.
So ... you think that guy fried before he fell?
Bobby Dawson's taking odds. Two to one, Grissom's wrong. Five to one, he gets suspended for shutting down that jailhouse. And ten to one ... 
Hey, Griss. How long you been standing there?
Robert Harris. Does that name mean anything?
Well, we heard the sheriff put the brakes on the investigation.
What? Do you want us to pay to see them?
Yeah, that's rough. And the significance of this evidence?
Trace amounts are odorless, tasteless.
So, where does this get us?
You want his blood?
Hey.
Cool.
Whatever happened with those metal cutters?
Roger Valenti's blood. Grissom wants it packaged in plastic. I don't know. Don't ask.
Later.
Hey, Gris. Valenti's blood. Packaged, ready to go.
You want to fill me in here? I mean, this wasn't covered in any science class I took.
That's far out.
That would explain that smell.
Just like Valenti's body. No evidence of electrocution.
And sodium is conductive, just like iron.
Roger Valenti's body offered up no resistance because of the excess iron in his blood.
Making his body one big wire -- path to ground.
So, you've just proved murder.
Twin moons of Venus.
Striations match.
Seems like a lot of work to kill a guy.
Hey, Griss. I think I can speak for both of us when I say I'm sorry that we let you down.
Bet you were like that in high school.
Oh, you were the girl I ran away from.
Construction on Flamingo. I'm sorry. 
Yeah.
A .38? 
Kind of weird being in a high school. 
What were you? A jock or a brain?
Reconstruction guys can give us a more precise angle measurement, but I'm thinking ... five-four ... maybe three. We got ourselves a shorty.
Cyranose 320. Company sent it to me, gratis for a week. They figure if it helps, CSI will buy one.
Yeah, well ... what if the shooter chews a certain kind of tobacco or has a unique halitosis and the e-nose picks up on it?
I thought it was our job to speak for the victim no matter what it took ... and to hell with the budgets.
Air pump. Cost about ten bucks.
Absorption agent?
It's been downsized.
Well, it's the same difference, really. 
Air is drawn into the last tube the chalk absorbs the chemicals from the air. And mass spec will break it down at the lab.
'Cause it was cool.
All right.
I saw her in action.
Yeah, she was.
I was just telling Nick how you were a big bully in high school.
No.
What Nick's trying to say he was unpopular.
What was wrong with those Members Only jackets? They were kind of cool back in the day.
Hey, Sara. What were you in high school?
Oh, I was short, I had big feet, thick glasses.
Yeah. I got pushed around by all the guys and never got any play from the girls ...
No, they used to tease me about my eyes. Called me names.
I didn't have a best feature in high school. Looking back on it now I can say I could see both sides of it thinking about this guy Barry Schickel, and how he was shot and whichever kid did it. I'm not saying it was right, but I kind understand, you know?
What's the matter, you don't trust me?
I got a boatload of chemical components here. Marijuana, bubble gum, cigars. It's like every guy's bathroom in America.
This... does not belong in a guy's bathroom. Can we prove this? I mean there's got to be a thousand different brands of this stuff out there.
Oh. Now you want my tricked-out toy.
That's all from one perfume?
We can narrow it down to one brand?
Well, aromas have fingerprints. They're like a unique combination of vapor molecules that linger in the air, long after the source has gone.
Paperwork. Later.
All right. Show time.
Check out these voids. That's the real evidence.
Guys ... 
Looks like it could be an electric saw.
You check nosebleed's tools yet?
That's because he probably ditched them after using them on the victim. Now we've just got to figure out which one.
Twenty-four hours, then we've got to get them back. Clean.
Same short v pattern, too.
This is on the real. You actually saw him do this?
Female blood.
We already know this beetle feeds only off of human blood, so why are we extracting its stomach contents?
Well, I hope he got his grub before you grabbed him up.
Let's go knock down some walls.
One wall down ... 15 to go.
Uh ... yeah.
I got a hollow section.
Damn. Are we in the wrong apartment again?
Miss?
We're from the Crime Lab. You found the deceased?
Makes us doubt the circumstances surrounding the victim's death.
Shelley Danvers -- appointment 8:00.
Well, you lied to us before.
Well, if she did, the coroner would find water in her lungs but it'd be worse hearing it from him than from you.
Oh, it's on.
Uh, yeah. Tina ... Tina Kolas. Best friends from Terre Haute, Indiana. Flew here in a package. Why?
Cath. Whose shirt is this?
When?
We're going to take this shirt, if you don't mind.
We're going to take this as well.
Well, that's okay. We do magic.
Sometimes a simple flashlight will do the trick.
She died of a heat stroke. The coroner just called in with the results of his final post. Your sauna's kept in the optimal condition for heat stroke -- 182 degrees. 
That could kill a person if you left them longer than two straight hours.
Football-- wide-screen.
She died of heat stroke.
We missed it until Captain Brass brought your room service records to our attention.
As her best friend, you would know that.
You killed her over a guy you two met at a bar?
Her pressure got so low her blood quit running through her organs. They shut down.
Cash business, huh?
He's either stupid or suicidal.
All right, I'll take the lot.
You run this car already?
Right here?
We're dealing with some criminal genius here. 
You forgot the leave the evidence on the ground.
So, our victim breaks out of the store with a bag full of dough ...
Guess somebody was casing the joint, huh?
Ms. Delgado, how long have you been here?
You have insurance?
Thank you.
Well, I might bet my own paycheck on that one.
Check it out. What's the first thing you do when you see one of these on your windshield?
Exactly. But the only guy to chuck his was the victim. I found one on the ground next to his car.
I know, I know, it sucks. You couldn't get anything off of it, huh?
Wow.
So, that confirms what Sara's eyewitness said. What else you got?
Thanks.
Can you tell us anything about the tool that may have been used?
Like the insulation in my attic.
Hey.
Hey. 
Small world, huh?
Hey, that's ironic, Hector. We're investigating your brother-in-law's shooting and look where we end up.
We also have a tire print.
We're looking for a Honda, Hector.
You know it don't look good when you run, man. You want to tell us who that Honda belongs to?
I guess that makes everything okay.
You got that right.
These guys packed enough .45 caliber ammo for a small army.
Less than a year ago security couldn't even carry guns.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ski masks are played out. Red and blue teamed up together and took out the guards and their rolling cage.
Black shot down that chandelier.
No amount of makeup in the world could cover up that chunk of adam's apple. 
No honor among thieves.
No stubble ... no adam's apple.
Well, the manager's not in?
I got a key.
Yeah.
Anything that links Brower to his co-conspirators.
I'm thinking trace elements in the clothes could tell us where he was before the heist. I'm going to take it all back to the lab.
I found similar dust on Adam Brower's dirty clothes. Check it out.
What's the composition?
Yeah, um... what do you know about silica?
Shouldn't smell at all, if this place is abandoned.
Shot with a .45. Execution style.
I just got off the phone with the Laughlin CSI assigned to last month's cottage casino case. He told me the casino's cameras captured four assailants, not three.
Actually, it didn't. We did.
Tower casino surveillance. The screen on your left the camera's trained over where Tammy, Darin and Adam entered. The screen on your right is trained on the gaming tables. Okay, check it out.
What, you missed him? All right. I'll play it again ... slower, just for you.  Now, keep your eye trained on the pit boss and the chandelier.
Yeah. Pit boss' name is Max Duncan. Started working there about three weeks ago. Before that ... 
You lost?
For what?
Yeah, except when you're losing. Then you don't hear anything.
Hey, Hank.
She's over there.
Will do.
That's a big pot. Casino's not satisfied with a heart attack?
Suspicious circs.
Nah. Poker's not gambling. It's playing against percentages. It's a skill. I like to play for the thrill.
Ace of spades.
What color is it?
Is that what I think it is?
How is it that you know so much about poker?
You're kidding. Wow. I'm impressed. I mean, the fact that you sat at a table with actual living beings.
What I don't get is it's not like we've never talked about gambling before. How come you never mention it?
He doesn't want to be exposed.
She killed him with eyedrops?
I can buy that: You ingest eyedrops it constricts the blood vessels throughout your body maybe even spike your blood pressure perhaps even cause a stroke.
What's that?
Let's back up here. Victim had chronic lead poisoning from a bullet that was left in his leg.
But what you're thinking is the lead from the bullet made his brain swell up with ... uncal herniation?
Except that someone put tetrahydrozoline in his drink which made his blood pressure spike and now we got his brain in a bowl.
Nasty.
Well, you didn't seem too worried about money the other night. We watched the surveillance tape. Doyle Pfeiffer didn't even pass you a nickel yet you were all over him.
Is that why you were giving eyes to the California kid?
He did, but he had help. Someone put something in his drink.
You mind if I take a look in your purse?
Whiskey.
Sour.
Suck. 
His drink in her eyedrops; her eyedrops in his drinks. 
Well, we got a bonded bartender, eye in the sky, other waitresses. How the hell did she get that into his drink without anyone seeing?
Yes.
Got that tox report back.
Yeah, and according to the tox report the bullet in his leg wasn't degraded enough to account for the amount of lead in his body.
Let's not forget the eyedrops are already in the drink; maybe she's giving him a signal.
Yeah, in a casino? Picture that. 
What's up, Griss?
Really?
Whatever's in the atmosphere gets into the soil, gets into the cocoa plants. Capillary action. 
Well, if he had those chocolates with him in '86 he's had them every night since. His lucky charm.
Wow. That would explain all the lead in him.
You don't recognize that guy, do you? It's Tom Haviland, movie star.
It's blood. I guess you forgot to scrub the back of your hands, huh?
Well, I'm going to get this blood evidence to DNA. I'll catch up with you guys later.
Great. What is this?
Oh, great. Here we go.  This is CSI Brown. I got a T&amp;A, at Ogden and Main. Please send EMS, Emergency Medical Assistance as soon as you can. Hey ... 
You all right?
Okay. Okay, all right...
Okay. Hey, stay with me. Stay with me. Let me look at you...
Hey, no, no, no ...
Okay. All right. All right, keep your head back. All right, I got to get a towel for your head.
Okay, I'll be here with you for the ambulance, okay? Take a deep breath. 
Can someone give me a towel?!
I got held up behind a traffic accident. I put it in with Greg. I'm not sure if he's done with it yet.
We got our guy then.
That blood was not contaminated. I recovered it from the back of Tom Haviland's hand sealed it, delivered it to sanders in DNA.
I was out of my car two, three minutes tops.
They day I do that is the day I turn in my badge.
Good defense attorney always does the last thing you expect.
I just got served. 
Movie star's lawyer wants the shirt that I wore to the crime scene.
I had to throw it out.
It was covered in the blood from the accident victim.
Oh, CSI's on trial now?
I've been through every dumpster on these premises.
It would only prove that I got blood on my shirt from an accident victim. That blood never came in contact with the blood evidence that I was transporting.
I don't see what that has to do with this case.
Damn! Why didn't I see that coming? Gambling?
Legal doesn't matter in there. You know the judge is going to throw out our blood evidence, right?
The blood is fine. It's their methods that are dirty.
I am.
It's a low blow. Low blow.
Yeah, somebody man-handled her pretty good before they killed her.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Tastes like sugar.
You've been watching way too much Discovery Channel.  This guy needs a girl. 
I'm going to check out the cabana.
Hey, fellas. Looks like the husband pulled a Clark Kent and left all his clothes behind. Couldn't have gone far. I got his wallet, credit card and keys.
You hear that? What is that?
Sounds like it's clogged.
You still harping on the solo thing? You know every time you work with me you learn something.
Yes.
You must get a lot of ass on a job like this, huh?
Yeah, I get it. The last time you were there did you happen to see anything out of the ordinary?
Maybe.
You mind if I take a look in your cab?
Well, that's a coincidence.
Newman's anti-vortex filter was missing three screws.
Oh, you mean, like, a leave-behind?
The more she'd want you.
Well, the lab wants more of you, too. We're going to need your fingerprints and a DNA sample.
How's it coming?
Sometime this year.
All right, where do I stand?
Big steps? Little steps?
I go any further, I'll be in the closet.
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
How's this?
These slime will do anything to sell a house, huh?
Hey, John McEnroe, where's the game?
Prints came back to the pool boy.
All right, now, don't get your panties in a bunch.  Uh, so we got the blond hair, the tooth filling ... that's it, huh?
White neoprene.
Like in a wet suit neoprene? 
Was the vic a diver?
Let's think about that. Who wears a white wet suit in a pool?
A professional.
Yeah.
Catherine, are you all right?
He must have gotten out the back window.
You the First Officer on the scene? 
When you clear a place you clear it, do you understand?
We lost a CSI two years ago because of the same mistake!
Use your radio and call for backup.
Hey ... 
Are you okay?
You know I could do this for you. CATHERINE: Not going to hurt any less.
That cut is deep.
Huh?
You decent? 
Looks like we're up.
Yeah, I didn't get any prints either but I did get a partial shoe tread from the back gate. And I don't think our dead guy lived here.
These pictures. Got Detective Wolf looking for the homeowner's name from the real estate records.
From what, do you think? A hammer, butt of a gun? DAVID PHILLIPS: I was just going to see if I could figure that out. 
The neighbors heard shouting. Two guys break and enter and get into some kind of an alternation.
Cath? You all right? 
Don't let him get to you like that.

Yes. What's going on?
What?
What's this about?
A-a bomb? Are you kidding? I've never even been near a bomb my entire life.
I used to wear those to go to work.
I want to call my lawyer.
Call your mom.
Is there something that we should be talking about? You know, in private?
I used to yell that around the house -- that I was owed fair play.
And you sent them bombs?!
How did you even know how to do this?
Tyler ... if you did this for me ... please tell them where they are.

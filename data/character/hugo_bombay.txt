I don't know anything about a murder.
What ... what's going on?
I loaned my car to a woman I work with last night. She sings at my club. Charlotte Danville. Is she all right?
Yeah, that's her.  Who did ... who did this to her?
She had to ... she had to do another set and needed to change her clothes.
She had a Toyota Solara. Totally tricked out.
I don't know. I didn't get the whole story. She seemed upset. She was talking to this guy.
I had to send a waitress over to remind her that she was getting paid to sing.
Yeah, it's that guy that sells cars on television.
Uh ... Cody White. I mean, but a lot of guys came in to see Charlotte. I mean, it's not like she slept around or anything. I tried. Can I go now?
I allowed myself to succumb to the pleasures of Donna. And she kept me up to the wee hours of the morning gratifying her abnormal lust.
She sleeps with her eyes open.

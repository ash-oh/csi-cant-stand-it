How you doing? Can I help you?
Yeah. Must be here about that accident. Terrible thing. Like I said to the wife, the way these 18-wheelers fly down here ballin' the Jack, I ain't surprised. I'm surprised there ain't more accidents.
Ah, well, I had dinner with the missus. Uh, fed the scraps to the dogs. Watched Jeopardy. Could hardly hear it, the dogs were, uh, so stirred up. Went outside to take a look, spotted a coyote. This is my business. Purebreds. Wouldn't want to lose one. So, I, uh, took care of it. Came back inside in time for Final Jeopardy.
I was making my 16:45 scan when I saw the body. I confirmed he was deceased. Then I called you guys.
Yeah.
Yeah, that would be the other body. Um -- Follow me.
It's a Kodiak. It's nonnative to the continental US. Shot twice in the head. The stomach's been cut open.
And there's no way a person can come this close to a live bear.

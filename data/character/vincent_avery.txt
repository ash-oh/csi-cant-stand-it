I'm barred. I've got, like, ten thousand dollars in chips and I cannot cash it. Look, if I kept my eye on you two, could you please just go in there and claim my money?
I'm sure you are, but ... come on. If I'm going to be giving you ten grand in chips, I've just got to know that you're coming back.
Two thousand dollars ... would give me peace of mind. Tell you what, you two come back and I will give you back your deposit plus another thousand?
All right, go, go, go!

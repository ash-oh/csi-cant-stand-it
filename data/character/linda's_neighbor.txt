Hey, hey! What are you doing? That's my car.
Cute picture. I'm late for work.
You get what you pay for. So the car shop was having a half-off deal. I'm in no position to go to the big guys.
Linda?  Yeah. She did it. I'd send her the bill if I thought she'd pay. She hasn't paid for anything else she trashed in this complex.
Oh, well, that would depend on her mood. Um, when she's up, she breaks the mailboxes. 
When she's down she throws the patio furniture into the pool.
She broke my windshield yesterday because she said she 'heard' me talking on my cell about her.
We just call her the whack job in 325.
Yeah? I'm surprised someone didn't kill her.
Look, unless you want to call my pit boss and tell him I'm under arrest, I'm going to work.

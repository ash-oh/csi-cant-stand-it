Six right nine-millimeter. Beretta, amongst others. Consistent with an officer's duty weapon. 
No match. That includes backups.
Soda silencer.
Whatcha got for me?
Huh. Sweet piece.
.32 beretta tomcat. Titanium frame, stainless steel barrel and slide. Super lightweight.
Ouch.
Good. 
.32 caliber. Not many of these in circulation.
Potentially.
Okay. Here we go.
Two shots!
There's showing up for work and there's doing your job. Warrick brought in a .32 auto coroner's bullet last week. D.B. in Maslow Park. You just found the murder weapon.
Your wood sample from the freezer.
Yeah. He bounced it back to me.
It's from a shotgun stock. Probably a momossberg 500. 
Well, if you find it, I can match it.
That's up to Hodges.

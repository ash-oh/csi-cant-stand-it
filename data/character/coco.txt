I was trying to put the nine ball in the corner pocket.
That's Tiffany. She got married last night. Lucky bitch.
Troy? Troy something?
No. She just met him. Sweet kid. He ... uh ... took her side when that cowgirl trash got all up in her face.
She came back last night and said that she was going to marry the guy.
Hey, cop, somebody says they want to marry you, take care of you, pay all your bills, give you a nice place to live, why would you even wait?

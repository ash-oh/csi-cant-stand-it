I hate bees.
I never get used to this part, you know when the bugs get going.
Beetles. No alkali fluids in the dirt so she wasn't killed here. Whoever dumped her must have been in a hurry. Didn't take the time to bury her. What do you think?
You can eat?
Hey, don't look at me.
Stellate pattern and beveled wound confirms the proximity of barrel to scalp. No question this was an intimate killing.
Let's see what we have. Fracture to the nasal bone, orbital bone, mandibular ... all facial fractures.
These aren't fresh, are they?
Any idea how long she's been dead?
Shakespeare again?
Okay, bear with me. 
I mean, you're one of ten guys in the country that understands this stuff.
Insects arrive at a corpse in a specific order, right?
And you can pinpoint time of death based on the type and age of insects present on the body?
Linear regression.
Which will tell us when the woman died.
It's a muscid fly. Only breeds in urban areas but Grissom found one on our girl which means she was probably killed downtown and then carried into the mountains.
What was her name?
Every face and neck fracture your wife has sustained over the last six years is highlighted.
How about a gun?
We're going to investigate your apartment. Do we need a warrant or are you going to play nice?
We'll be the judge of that.
No, thanks.
Not a lot of room for Kaye.
This back door lead to your car?
You smell that, Grissom?
I got news for you, Scott. Bleach doesn't make blood disappear. You just can't see it with the naked eye.
It got there when you shot your wife in the head before you wrapped her in a blanket and you dumped her in the mountains!
You touch me again, you draw back a stump!
You don't know a handful!
I am a woman, and I have a gun. And look how he treated me. I can only imagine how he treated his wife.
What do we need to nail him at trial?
The bullets from Scott's gun are unusual. 
Since we didn't find the spent bullet I sent one from the box over to trace. Everything else stacks up. He killed her. 
What did you get?
Are you positive? Not five?
Okay, forget time of death. How does your client explain Kaye's blood all over his apartment wall?
Altercations ... upgraded from wrestling?
Fine. Yeah.
I was working till 4:00 A.M. I combed every demo Scott's driven. Zilch. What's up?
Oh. Warrick -- your favorite CSI.
What do you want to know?
Hey.
Um ... I'm-I'm here about something else. You ... you know how you say, We're the victim's last voice?
I thought it was our job to speak for Kaye Shelton.
What if you hear the victim's screams? In the car, at the store.
You want to sleep with me?
That way, when I wake up in a cold sweat under the blanket, hearing Kaye's screams ... you can tell me it's nothing.  It's just empathy.
Thanks.
Which places the victim with her husband who's already guilty as sin.
I heard you were going into an autopsy.  How can you just move on to another case? They're laughing at us. You know that, right? They think we're a couple of 'science nerds'. They threw out our findings.
First witness to a crime.
...and forensic science was born. Sung T'su, 1235 A.D. You call 800 years ago recent?
And again by Bergeret D'Arbois in the 1800s.
We're part of the cycle.
Except somebody had to push for prints. And you're standing there saying
Yes.
Kaye Shelton ...
Gave her a bath, huh?
Why didn't we see this at the autopsy?
Yeah.
Lead, copper, zinc ... teflon.  Teflon?
Strand of hair from our lady in the mountains. 
The blue dust from around her entrance wound -- that's from the bullet's impact. It's made of teflon. Now look at the next specimen.
The bullet is from Scott's personal ammo supply which I test-fired. See, the teflon disintegrated into blue powder at the moment of impact.
But we can bury him under evidence. You're the one who's always saying it's better to have one piece of forensic evidence than ten eyewitnesses.
Less Latin.
Hi.
I checked out Warrick. His story about missing court was, uh ... lame. I got this surveillance tape from the Monaco. He was in the casino. 
I'm sorry.
Warrick? Your favorite CSI.
I got this surveillance tape. He was in the casino. I'm sorry.
Dead body-- bonus.
You tell us -- you like leather or lace?
I filed my report.
Get me a picture of the body ... the items on the bedsheet ... the window ... the drafting table.
Everything on the floor.
Sara Sidle, crime scene investigation. And you are ... ?
Sorry for your loss.  You want to tell me what happened here?
Nothing benign about two $20s screaming, take me on the bar.
Yeah, well, it's hard to miss all that high-tech computer equipment. There's got to be five, ten grand there. First thing I'd take.
Before or after he used a bedsheet to transport the silverware? Pillowcases are the norm, you know that. Something's not right.
Using your arms -- how big's a whale?
Now freeze, don't move.  Up.
Checking for blood spatter.
This is what I do. This is how I eliminate you as a suspect.
Well, that's good news; no blood, bud.
I am going to need you to strip, though.
Don't be shy on my account. But if you are, this nice detective will accompany you to the bedroom.
Oh, and, uh, I'm going to need to take your window with me, too. 
It's all in the warrant.
Grissom reinstated you.
Let me guess. Grissom gets you to dime yourself off and now you both feel better? You're supposed to be in court. Instead, you're placing bets for a cheap thrill to satisfy nothing.
I'm already working.
You weren't in your office.
Warrick has a problem. Ignoring it isn't going to make it go away. You asked me for a report and then you disregard my recommendation.
So you feel comfortable jeopardizing a unit to placate an addict?
Then at least take him off my case.
Glass. Any idea how it got there?
Did you file a police report?
I already checked with my lab. They do this test, and guess what? The glass -- it floated.
Anything else you'd like to tell us?
No, he's not.
Just one more question. What do you do for a living?
You make a lot of money doing that?
Feel free to answer it anyway.
But you don't, right?
I was playing him. Cops ran Kenny's financials. He lost a pot in the market. Had a ton of margin calls. I'm surprised you didn't tag him as a fellow gambler.
It's a flaw.
Not bad. I'm impressed.
I meant the Haeckel marks. Should tell us what we need to know.
This is the glass you line-drived.
Right angles face the same direction. Take a look.
Just take a damn look.
You ever heard of Haeckel marks?
What did you use to break the window, Kenny?
We can't prove it, but we got a motive.
Okay, let's say killing his brother would get it for him.
He's a day trader -- spends all day on his computer. If we want to know more about him that's where we should be looking.
Still at the house.
Why don't we go get a ... ?
There's something wrong with it.
The power light's on.
Oh, no one is going to believe this.
Nothing really special about them.
We match this to the broken window, we got him.
So, Kenny broke the window from the inside using the butt of the gun.
Sounds like more than a theory.
I never said you weren't a good CSI.
You look lost.
Yeah. You want me to tell him you're here?
Okay. Will he know what for?
So you went to the casino to win bail money.
You want to tell me you didn't?
What else you got?
How did he find you? 1-800-GRISSOM ... ?
... The firemen have.
Funny place for a mattress.
Looks like the kid was going camping.
Waterproof matches.
It's a weird place for such a thorough burn especially since the door isn't scorched.
Look at this. Rubber?
That's why you can always count on seeing a pattern.
Bag a sample. I'll put it through the lab.
So that's why the concrete's discolored? From the heat?
Why would there be glass in the middle of the hot spot?
He still did the job.
Danger, Will Robinson.
As a matter of fact, here is your doorframe. I had Collins analyze the burn depth. You see these rolling blisters?
Based on the depth of the allir... allo...
This wood burned very hot and very fast.
Negative.
Counting matches?
I got a theory. You want to hear it?
You know the melted shards of glass we found on the closet floor? They prove that the fire burned at over a thousand degrees, right? But that temp, combined with the water used to douse the flames would have destroyed most of the accelerant.
So, Ecklie's conclusion of gasoline wasn't based on any physical evidence. It was based on Damon's credit card receipts.
But, hydrocarbons are found in all kinds of things: Oils ... kerosene, polyethylene-based compounds like laxatives-- even the foam used in push-up bras.
Crime scene cleanup.
And then what?
Can you fill in the blanks?
So all this stuff is from a five-meter radius of the point of origin?
How could the victim possibly have been in one piece?
Calm, huh?
Did you figure out what this FP stands for?
So our bomber's a newbie. Does he fit Grissom's wack job from the bomb site?
What is it?
What about the orange stuff?
Mmm?
I would have to investigate that.
This is a good choice. According to the bomb data center which has a record of every component used in any bomb -- from Ted Kaczynski to teenage boys playing with fireworks -- the most recent timing device of choice is made by TimeTell SnoozeWell, $10.99 at any local drugstore.
We're going to go blow up some bombs.
Aluminum briefcase.
Snoozewell.
Black gunpowder.
Identify the pipe containing the powder.
You ready?
Let's do it, Dan.
Fragments from the galvanized steel traveled the farthest.
That's the outer limit of visible metal detritus at the Hansen building.
Polyethylene? Terephtalete?
Anybody report hearing any noise? Ticking?
Oh. It's not the firemen -- it's the rain. This crime scene is trashed.
What do you have?
That orange stuff again.
Which sets off the bomb.
Be right back.
Excuse me. Hi. I'm with the crime lab. I'm sorry, but I have to take your jacket.
Thanks. 
Polyethylene-terephtalete.
Orange stuff.
I have a new favorite color.
The orange polyester from the bomb is a match to the thrift-right jacket. Guess where their regional headquarters is located. 
You bet. I ran a Lexis search looking for disgruntled employees, irate customers anyone with a grievance against thrift-right.
Norman Stirling -- former manager.
Let go last year. Caused a commotion at HQ. Filed lawsuits against the company. Guy's been out of work ever since.
FP.
You don't recognize those initials?
Well, those orange jackets over there appear to match the materials the bombs were wrapped in.
Is that the place with that weird pool?
Any chance it's old age?
Only in Vegas.
Sign of struggle. I'll dust for prints.
Yeah. One hit or there would be blood.
Well, you know, that would be Celine Dion.
But, uh, the bill was charged to the credit card of a Lynn Henry, Eau Claire, Wisconsin.
Hi.
Sort of?
So Darren was the dancer?
Lynn, how did you get those bruises on your wrists?
Thanks. Our card.
Dinner's going to have to wait.
And, as far as we can tell you were the last three women with him. So, who's lying?
About what? Lynn, does this have anything to do with the bruises on your wrists?
Yeah, you can go.
But, Lynn, uh ... a car's going to take you to the hospital for an exam.
Well, we're assuming that a couple of lamp hits to the head killed Darren, right?
You read the coroner's final report. There's no traces of that lamp on his head at points of impact.
I don't know. I'll let you know when I find it.
What? What do you got?
Where?
Nice. 
Tiniest diamond in the world.
The bride-to-be's ring, maybe? She was here.
Every time we go to find these women they're somewhere else. You sure you got that address? That desk clerk was talking very quickly.
What?
Oh. You think we're dressed for a wedding?
Lynn Henry's SART exam's in.
At this point, I think all those girls are lying to us.
The clock's going to explain it all, believe me.
So, ladies of the wedding party, you get a free course in the forensics of sexual intercourse. Secrets of our trade. Lynn, when you had your exam for sexual assault a SART nurse makes a clock like this. 
This is the v*g1n*. 
And it does tell a monologue. Some bruising is normal when s*x occurs. Injuries at 11:00 ... 12:00 or 1:00 indicate consensual s*x or what we would call avid. Injuries around the dinner hour ... five, six, or seven, indicate forced entry. The woman hasn't done anything to help her partner thus sustaining serious bruising.
Okay, O'Riley. Lynn ... your exam showed no evidence of s*x in the last
Look, we can run the clock exam on each of you. And the clock is going to tell us what happened. So who wants to go first?
Meg, your engagement ring ... is that cubic zirconia? 
Meg, you did have s*x with Darren the dancer. Maybe you even tried to stop in the middle of it. But something got your attention.
Luke, you threw the lamp -- probably on the floor. Understandable rage.
Except we found it.
What am I? ... working food and beverage at one of the hotels? I haven't had a day off in three weeks. I mean, if they're going to call me in, throw me a bone. Give me the 419 on the elevator.
I'm tired.
You're awake. I hate you.
Thanks, Greg.
Everything has to be in CODIS ASAP.
Suck it up, Greg. You're well-rested.
I heard that.
No, I can't drink any more coffee. My body clock is so screwed up. I just want a steak and a shot.
Food? Good idea. You're on.
So much for the steak. I'll take the coffee.
Okay, I'm up.
Bingo. Well, that only took 45 minutes.
A hit off Patrick Haynes' social security number. There's only one problem. He's an eight-month-old infant that died ten years ago.
Something good?
She's dead.
Really? How would you know?
It's an honest question.
Well, not this girl.
What does that mean?
Okay.
Well, that's scary. All you need is one signature to break somebody.
Yeah, dispatch left a message.
This Chilean Sea Bass is wonderful.
Okay, you got your missing widow. Her bloody tooth found in her own bedroom which is currently occupied by two moes.
No, you're not, and stay out of my sea bass.
Who was sleeping with six men rolled into one -- Patrick Haynes.
Risk versus reward. You sleep with someone, you kill 'em, the heat's on. You flee, or, you roll the dice and maybe you get your cookie.
So why kill Lacey Duvall?
You want to go Dutch, Nick?
Vegas, NFL football, a guy like you. Come on, you trying to tell me that you didn't make a little pit stop?
Warrick has a problem. Ignoring it isn't going to make it go away.
Hey.
Right now? I thought I would help you two with the scene.
Walk in the park, guys.
Hey.
You get any I.D. On her?
All right. 
Hi.
Thanks.
Make a note she's married. Or recently divorced. 
She's warm.
Uh, Evans ... we're going to need a little privacy here.
I never really liked this part of my yearly exam. These things are always freezing.
Okay.
Saint Catherine. She studied science. 
She was touch and very outspoken. Went against the Emperor himself. Chewed him out for persecuting Christians. Took him two or three tries to execute her. 
She never gave up. She was brave.
You hold on to this.
This shouldn't have happened to you. But, I promise I will find out who did this. I promise.
Hey. 
Sexual assault kit's ready to process.
We'll see. She's, um ...  ... breathing.
Yeah?
Here you go.
Somebody wore this hat a lot.
This sweatband might give us DNA and I could compare it to the samples I collected off of Jane at the hospital.
Our ... Jane Doe. My death imminent.
I'll be in DNA.
Any luck on 23rd street?
The DNA from the ball cap is a match to the semen we found on our Jane Doe. But ... CODIS hasn't kicked out a name.
We're not having any luck finding the shooter from his DNA with a belt loop so I thought I would at least try and identify the poor woman before she dies.
Do I what?
Yeah.
I chase rabbits. And ... I read crime books. And I listen to the scanner.
Nothing.
I don't like anything.
She's special ... to me. I can't help it.
Okay. I'm almost done. I just got to log off.
You were shopping.
Pamela ...  ... Pamela Adler.
Grissom told you to keep me out, didn't he?
/ one day, maybe next week / I'm going to meet you, meet you / I will ... 
If you like chalk on a board.
It's a-a habit. I don't even realize I'm doing it. Did you get that belt loop from the crime scene lined up yet?
Fits like a glove.
You go. I have something to do first.
Excuse me?
It's something else. Promise.
We caught him. If you hadn't pulled that belt loop we might never have found him, but ... you did good.
Hi.
Sure. Oh, I wanted to give you this. I've been keeping it ... for Jane -- Pam, uh, until I found her family.
How are you doing?
That's great. That's-that's great. She's a real fighter, huh?
Yeah, I do ... know people who've gone there. They'll take real good care of her.
I got to go.
Definitely. Haven View. I'll be there.  Good luck.
The husband doesn't get it. 
He's so happy she's going to live. He doesn't realize she's going to be in a vegetative state for the rest of her life.  It's not fair.
What kind of system rewards the suspect when the victim is too tough to die?
I wish I was like you, Grissom. I wish I didn't feel anything.
Nadine Winston falls asleep in that chair and incinerates. We can make history.
No. Of course not. I'm a scientist. I just ... 
She has been reduced to ashes.
I know.
What if it is real, and we've uncovered it?
I'm not. I'm just open to all theories.
Looks like cotton fiber ... possibly from a nightgown. It's barely scorched. Weird. It's like the body burned, but ... the clothing was fire retardant.
Fire practically burned a hole in the roof but it's isolated in one spot.
The victim -- she live alone?
A human torch.
Theories give way to conclusions once all the evidence is in. I am merely thinking about the next piece of evidence.
Incinerated. Lab results from the ashes came back negative for accelerant. Nothing flammable but sebaceous glutamate.
I'm going to go talk to Grissom -- see what he thinks.
I checked with homicide again. They found no evidence of foul play.
No motive. O'Riley spoke with friends and relatives. They were a loving couple.
No, and you're reaching.
We're scientists, right? We want answers, the satisfaction of certainty. I'm not ignoring scientific method. I'm just keeping an open mind. If we eliminate all the alternatives we're left with spontaneous combustion. That's exciting!
She's a pile of ash.
Great.
Well?
Interesting voice mail you left me.
Meet me behind CSI and bring a cotton nightgown. I'd wear it for you but, uh, I prefer pajamas.
We're experimenting on a pig again?
You know, I-I-I haven't eaten meat since Grissom used one to estimate postmortem insect growth.
What are you going to do, exactly?
You do not give up.
If she burned herself with the cigarette, she would've woken up, not burned up.
Sleeping pills.
Care for a light?
Now what?
We're just working the case.
The wick?
We found the same thing at the crime scene.
You knew about the ashes? Why didn't you say something when you gave us the case?
Well, I would've looked like an idiot. Thanks for covering.
Done.
What's missing here?
Can we get another gurney? GRISSOM: I need another gurney.
Come on, come on! Hurry up! NICK: Let's go, hurry up! Get the plastic on!
We're losing everything!
What did you do exactly?
Justin ... we're going to need to take your clothes.
Because there's blood all over them.
Hey, Gris. Kevin Shepherd, chiropractor. Amy Shepherd, Dentist. House in the lakes. Married eight years. Perfect credit. You know, I'm lost. There's nothing jumping off the page, here.
Justin Green. First witness, first suspect but he hung around, waiting for us.
But his story jibes. Several eyewitness saw him performing CPR on Kevin Shepherd. But if-if-if it is a carjacking, I don't get it. Why fight to the death? It's four wheels and a chassis.
So, you are thinking the Shepherds lost their lives for their SUV?
Hey, Doc. What's with the fluoroscope?
What about a pin or a plate -- something metallic on the inside?
Exsanguination.
What is that?
A tip ... of a knife.
Yeah ... but I cleaned it for you.
Acid in the lemon juice should react to carbon steel, but not stainless steel.
He's the cop. I'm the scientist.
Carbon steel. What's next?
And while the artist was at work, Brass and I identified Jessica Hall's murder weapon from the tip we found lodged in her ribs. It's a dagger. Fugasi model 502.
So, if this dagger matches your mold ...
Okay. We just put the sharp wounds to bed.
Points of impact on these two are blunt, right?
Yeah.
And then he went back to Kevin to finish the job.
Sweaty palms make the best prints.
If we find what we're looking for the answer is yes. 
Can I see those prints?
Thanks. 
No need for AFIS. We got a visual match. All three prints belong to victim number three.
What does that give us? We know she was stabbed at the crime scene, but then what? Was she driving herself to the hospital? Was she under duress?
Preserving the blood pattern.
The victim was lying on the ground, wounds above the waist. It's not Kevin's blood.
Okay.
Standing here, I'm not going to get that much blood on Warrick.
Well, I can't without ... stepping on him.
Stabbing's are messy and inexact. So victim number three becomes suspect number two.
Grissom didn't say what he was looking for, huh?
I think it's peaceful.
He's a suspect? When did that happen?
Not the t-shirt. 
Warrick ... what does that look like to you?
Wrist doesn't bend that way.
We know where Jessica's hands were. 
And Amy Shepherd died instantly.
Justin's story was that he performed CPR on Kevin Shepherd.
Damn it. Justin sold me a lie and I bought it.
Wednesday. 10:02 ... Kevin transferred $35,000 to his mistress, Jessica. Wednesday 2:16 p.m. ...
Yes. Deposit for $35,000. 
I can trump that. Sorry, Nick. Thursday, 11:09 A.M. $70,000 was transferred to Justin Green's account.
Not Jessica. Not Kevin.
Amy Shepherd does the unthinkable. She doubles it.
Yeah?
Typewritten ransom note? Kidnapper was organized.
I'll get it to questioned documents check for origination prints, the works.
You think the suspect printed the ransom note from inside the house while they were sleeping?
What do you mean you haven't checked for prints? It's a ransom letter.
You got anything for me?
I could have told you that.
What? Where?
A drum goes around three times to print one page. 
So if the Andersons' printer was used ... 
No vertical dots.
Ransom note's not from the Anderson's printer or paper supply.
The Andersons are clear. Whoever wrote the letter did it from a different location and brought it with them.
You want me to check ballistics?
Are those our dogs? Grissom? Grissom!
Yeah. There's like 200 of them in that place. I'm going to test them against the ransom note, one by one.
Not yet. They're still working on it.
Grissom?
You told me a few weeks ago that nothing is personal. No victim should be special.
Everyone follows your lead.
They're not unknown.
I ran them against the employees of Steve Anderson's computer company disgruntled and otherwise. They belong to a Needra Fenway.
Steve's secretary.
So, of course, I checked out her printer. As I'm sure you know, all printers have their own unique signature.
These three ... tiny vertical dots from Needra's printer match the ransom note perfectly.
Hi.
Grissom? 
The coroner's been trying to reach you.
9:00 P.M., But, uh, there's something else. He isolated the fiber found in Zachary Anderson's throat. It's a flame-retardant material -- generic name's metaramid.
Fire-retardant infant's clothes are made out of vinyon. The fiber found in Zack's throat is a stronger chemical treatment. It's found in things that are made to be near fire and flames. 
Hey, can I go with you?
Same color as the fiber in Zack's throat.
Taillight?
Given the extensive bruising from the wide tread mark, victim was killed by a larger vehicle. Not that compact.
What's up?
You can tell he's deaf by his fingerprints?
The vehicle -- probably a truck or an SUV, based on the width of the tire tread-- takes off. Later, along comes a compact - thump -- runs over his dead body.
That ended in murder.
Dr. Gilbert ...
We need your help. Brian Clemonds was murdered.
Anyone have a grudge against him? 
We understand you don't want a homicide investigation upsetting your students.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you.
We'll also need access to his records.
I'm not accusing anybody of anything.
They're not cooperating.
What did we do? We met with the president, asked a few questions.
Like it's our fault we can hear.
So, you going to tell us how you learned to sign?
Well, the president of the college is a real whack job.
You know, I think you might be siding with her.
What was that all about? Grissom signs.
He goes out?
Oh, I've read about this machine. Very Frankenstein.
You've used one of these before?
So, you show the suspect slides of the crime scene and if he's our guy ...
I photo'ed the victim's torso and imaged the tread mark-- scanned it -- got it running through a tread assistance CD ROM.
Not yet. CD database-- 11,033 patterns.
Could take a while.
What are you doing?
What?
Lice?
Yeah, he was. Lice adhere to hair follicles. I didn't find any stray hairs on him.
Computer's still processing but Warrick found something pretty interesting.
A few more numbers and this could have been cake.
We have a lead -- I found a partial serial number on the broken taillight.
Maybe on its own but the tire tread database kicked out a match. The tire belongs to a ford explorer. A p235-75, manufactured specifically for their SUVs. Only one with the same partial serial number is registered in Vegas.
Lice?
So ... that's why Grissom's late.
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.
Taillights match.
Check this out. 
This fabric matches the victim's sweater.
And the taillight was smashed.
Who drives backwards on a downtown street?
Thanks.
They get washed every time, right?
You okay?
Okay.
Mandatory drug testing?
Cocaine bugs. 
Hey, I just got off the phone with OSHA. Our carnival has violations in eight states.
But that's not all. More than half these guys have records. And Pickens, the boss? His real name is Roger Peet. He's a convicted s*x offender on parole.
You tell us.
You worried you tipped your hand in there?
Look, don't bite my head off, but any chance you're going after this guy because you're a mother?
Yeah.
Maybe.
You have anything to support that? 
Hey.  We aren't going to lunch, are we?
Maybe she had a minor concussion, or was stunned. That could explain why she couldn't get out.
Perimortem?
So someone did yank her out of that car in the dark.
Wait. Pickens yanks her out just so he can drown her?
Not without someone seeing him.
None.
Drowned the little girl.
I'm going to go call Brass. 
Nothing. This is fun.
As compared to a more scientific approach.
Okay, based on our theory a loose seat belt enabled Pickens to yank the little girl out of her seat.
Just like little Sandy.
The only person who could have done it, then is the person that was in the car with her-- the mother.
I'm sorry. What?
And by creating, you mean fabricating. Neurolinguistics programming -- human behavioral science.
Mrs. Dantini.
We may have a lead.
So, you jumped in the water.
You never went in the water.
And when she managed to grab onto you, you broke her arm.
Hey ... 
... you all right?
Since we skipped lunch, you want to get something to eat? Walk it off?
Mm-hmm.
Yes! Road trip.
I'm gonna go switch boots.
Who found the body?
Where is it?
There's no head. Think it's DaSilva?
Uh... hands and feet have been amputated.
Yeah?
I'm not sure you should be doing this.
Snooping for trace on Grissom and Catherine's stolen BMW?
What has gotten into you?
You're nuts. You know that.
That's one of those funny clues. Could mean nothing or could mean everything.
Working the case.
The skinned gorilla torso forty miles outside of Baker. Remember?
Well, it was at the start of shift. A crime has been committed.
And ...
I can't believe you. You, with your pet tarantula your maggot farms, that komodo dragon on back order ... you should be more sympathetic to the senseless murder of an innocent gorilla.
Bummer.
Wait. Is he missing a head?
So, uh, Tricky Nick. What did you get on your evaluation?
Yeah, but how many outstandings did Grissom give you?
What did he tell you to look for?
Yeah.
Spur's Corral. I know that place. They give you peanuts for starters instead of bread or chips and salsa.
Look, you obviously don't need my help. I-I got go put something to rest. See you later?
I heard you were disassembling the gorilla.
Well, I've been trying to find out who did this to her and, um, I have some questions.
Why did they amputate the gorilla's head?
The hands and feet?
Here Nick and I were thinking it was to avoid I.D. Why skin it?
It's hard to tell where the human ends and the animal begins.
I checked out a couple of websites ... bushmeatorg. I think she was killed probably in Cameroon or Congo transported to the port of Los Angeles. Dismembered, packaged ... loaded onto a small plane ... where they dumped what they couldn't sell but, uh, I just have to find the plane.
There has to be something I can do.
For every one that parts, one stands aboveground.
Damn it.
Damn that guy.
He's escalating, Grissom.
Guess he wants to get caught.
I have tape-lifted, roll-lifted -- I'm not finding one hair.
He vacuumed this place before he left. We've established that he utilizes materials from the victim's domicile.
Hey, guys. He took the bag.
Thanks.
Hey, Warrick you got a second?
I got this hair that you guys found this morning and I'm trying to compare it to the one hair we recovered from the murder last week - the Hayes girl?
No. I can't even tell if we have a DNA match. There's no skin tag on either one.
No scalp, no skin. It's almost like this hair was ...
Mine.
Hey, Warrick and I just got a break. The guy's been planting hairs.
Grissom ... are you hearing us?
I'm going to do it, Grissom. 
I want to.
I'm trained in weaponless defense.
Grissom ... 
Think he knows his next victim?
Look, this is my idea. I want to do something before another girl gets killed and ...
You've been saying that for weeks. It's taking too long. Someone else is going to die and you're still going to be figuring it out.
Wish me luck.
Uh ... yeah, actually.
Me, too. This is my last pack ... but, uh, I say that every week, so ... 
Guess it depends on the woman.
Sure. Yeah.
Maybe. 
I don't usually give out that kind of information.
Thanks.
Hey!
He met the profile.
Tracy Berg.
I didn't really find anything instructive but Warrick hit pay dirt.
The frequented locations report said none of the women belong to a gym where he could have spotted them.
Which I do all the time. It's a free workout, and you don't have to sign up.
And, of course, get a list of the club's male gym members.
Do we have a breakfast budget, Grissom?
Good, cause our plates are up, and nobody has any money.
Whole wheat and fruit? Who ordered that?
I know who I am. I think you're a little confused.
Get a picture of the security pad. Someone touches it before it's dusted, I break their fingers. 
Shoot the mirror, point of disturbance the lamp, point of disturbance ... 
... you're standing in my crime scene.
You're doing audio? I wanted that.
Technicality. Who did Grissom handpick to work here?
Get the lights, will you?
Cursory call -- looks like a professional job. 
Our guy bypasses the security system, surprises the wife in the back hall. Drags her in here. She grabs onto the doorway -- sign of struggle. No sign of sexual assault. He's in, they're out. 
Probably ... egress through those doors. Excuse me, is my evaluation interrupting you?
Glad I have a healthy ego. You find something interesting there?
You're ... so ... technical ... I can hardly keep up, but ...
Did you just slap on bad cologne?
It's almost sweet.
Can't be chloroform.
We'll confirm it in GC mass spec.
I keep trying to be your star pupil.
No dirt. Context-- there is dirt on the carpeting inside.
You're saying kidnapper tracked the dirt in.
Cyanide? He poisoned her?
And how does a bug specialist know so much about dirt?
Gruesome, Grissom.
So when you said, Follow the dirt...?
Great. There's got to be 100 gold mines in Nevada.
Freaky. Is that what I think it is?
Last mine. We've circled it twice.
Where?
Okay, let's land! Take her down! Down!
Mrs. Garris! GRISSOM: Mrs. Garris! Can you hear us? SARA: Mrs. Garris! GRISSOM: We're with the Las Vegas Police Department!
Got something here.
Come on! GRISSOM: Get that end! SARA: Yeah, come over!
Oh, my god.
Never ceases to amaze me what people do to each other. 
Transport the box to the lab for latents. Hair fibers, get soil exemplars.
What's the rule? How long do I have to be here before I start kicking in for gifts?
You keep that; might learn something.
The burial box is in. 
Thanks, guys.
Garris Winery.
Grissom, can you look at something out back? Could be big.
Hey, Grissom ... could you come tape me up?
Right. Not in the back. Which made me ask, what kind of a kidnapper puts a woman bound and unconscious in the front seat? The back of my arm isn't touching the sheepskin, see?
But, there is sheepskin fiber on the back of Laura's sleeve. That tells us Laura sat back like a normal person would.
Cut me, Mack.
Like this.
Correct. But, would a kidnapper risk putting an unconscious woman in the front seat of his car, even unbound? Answer is usually in the question -- you taught me that. So, was she unconscious? We found halothane on the patio. Halothane knocks you out ... if you take it.
Proof would be in her blood. Halothane stays in the system up to 48 hours.
Damn it, I wanted to carry the ball over the line.
Grateful dead CD?
No halothane in Laura Garris' blood which proves she was never knocked out. She went willingly. She and Chip faked her kidnapping -- which, of course, makes no sense at all.
With a black eye. Any theories?
You and Chip made a plan to run away together with your hard-earned millions, Jack. Divorce is just too long and messy. Anyway, the plan was surprisingly well thought-out.
We're getting to that. You and Chip drove out of town. She sat in the front seat, unbound, fully conscious. They stopped at a roadside phone. Chipper called in the ransom message and I think you were still in the truck then, right, Laura?
Pay attention. It's about to become yours.
Guess he figured why split $2 million when he can dump you and have it all.
Fine suit. 
And well, just fine.
Hey, we have one locker room and it's my job to be observant.
Easy. So, you and me, 419 Western LVU.
I know, we don't have all day ... are, are you going to wear ... that?
It's that hideous ...
And here I had all this respect for you.
Hey.
You see a suicide note?
Don't release anyone downstairs. We want to talk to them. All of them.
Could you say that? I mean, the kid's 18 years old, he's got his whole life in front of him and why would he want to hang himself?
Get in ... ?
Apparently not.
Big job? How'd he take it?
No teeth marks.
So, the question is, how did he get there?
Huh. Is that a tattoo?
Nick? You want to take a look at this?
Okay.
We found ink on James's pen1s. Are you trying to tell us he was just practicing his penmanship?
Your Johnson?
Don't stop now.
You humiliate him in front of all the other actives. Poor kid was so scared, he had to sign himself. You give him a beer shower? And you don't call that hazing?
I don't buy it.
The coroner's prelim on the frat hanging.
What's that smell?
Mmm, junk food and radiation-- good combo. 
A strip of raw calf's liver was found lodged inside the cleft of victim's throat. Cause of death: Choking.
Microscopic threads of fabric were found embedded in the liver.
Did you stuff him? Suffocate him? Shove towels down his throat?
How does a kid choke to death and end up hanging from a rafter?
You do realize you just admitted to killing him?
It was an accident. But now it's beginning to look like Christmas.
Manslaughter -- are you kidding? Are you willing to settle for that? Come on, Nick, you know as well as I do there is more to this.
Okay.
Yeah. I don't believe them.
Yes, there would.
What about abdominal or thoracic bruising?
They lied. When this kid was choking, no one tried to help him.
JILL W. Two triangles.
Freaks.
Where do you think?
Of course you do.
So, looking for fibers.
What the heck is that?
He didn't think it was funny enough to share it with us. You know, I never met a guy who could just laugh that off.
You and Kyle both get charged with murder. And the House goes dark.
No, but when he gets here, you can tell him. New charge: First degree murder.
One thing about the fraternity upstate, the brotherhood's fantastic.
Oh, I'll dress down.
Glad you could make it.
I'm outta here. Good luck tonight, you guys.
Do you have a name?
Oh ...  okay, let's take her out. 
Thanks.
That's strange.
Glazed like a doughnut.
Formaldehyde, right?
So I was right. This woman's been embalmed.
Are you hitting on me, David?
Let me give you some friendly advice. If you want to pull chicks, you've got to get aggressive. You've gotta drop the glasses, lose the coat grow some scruff. 
You do get a C for cute, though.
Stephanie Reyes was laid to rest at Desert Haven Funeral Home. Her funeral was last week.
Are you telling me that someone dug up Stephanie Reyes and stole her body?
Did you report the robbery of Mrs. Reyes' remains to the police?
Profits over people, is that it?
Eight feet. How deep do you bury these caskets?
There's nothing else in there. I thought you said grave robbers only stole bodies.
You sell caskets, right? As part of your mortuary service? I want to see some.
Bonus.
There is no way I'm going to end up in a dumpster wrapped in plastic. I'm going to be cremated -- dust in the wind, you know. I don't want any part of these things.
Are you serious?
How much did it run you?
So when you buy one of these for $10,000, it's yours, right?
No one else gets to use it.
Then how did all these people get in here?
What are you selling-- time-share coffins?
Sure, there is. Once the funeral is over, you dump the body and use the same casket over and over.
Yes, I can. This is a set of prints on the inside of the plastic sheeting we found in the dumpster. What are the odds they belong to you? 
All you had to do was put the bodies back in the grave and no one would have been the wiser.
Yeah, I know. You see dead people. So do I. And when they turn up in dumpsters, I like to see they get back to where they belong.
Minimum. Then, you're going to pay for Stephanie Reyes' family to have a real burial.
Then, we're going to let the D.A. run the table.
I hear it's just bones? What a rush.
Officer-involved shooting.
I drive.
Hi.
Where's his gun?
I'm going to go bag it.
At that proximity G.S.R.'S invalid. They'd both be covered, no matter who fired.
Hey.
What are you getting at, Warrick?
Standard issue. 
Both gun's are nine millimeter automatics. Brass isn't going to like this.
Like I do? If Tyner's dirty, he goes down. I just know what happens when you piss off the P.D.
Officer Tyner, your gun -- there's a bullet missing from the magazine.
Whoa.
Then you should know. Tyner's magazine -- one bullet shy.
Yeah. It's not in the body, bullet's a round point wound was a through-and-through.
And, with a record like yours we're supposed to just take you at your word?
It's not here.
Excuse me. No one's allowed inside the tape.
Missing bullet, eyewitness ... we better tell Grissom we got a war.
Brass, this has nothing to do with anything.
Eyewitness is a bonus: Your cop's magazine was one bullet shy.
Wow, wow guys. Get off him. BRASS: Hey! Hey! Joe!
Yeah. Come on, Warrick. Come on. Let's go.
You think the bullet's somewhere in the jeep.
Let's do it. 
We have searched every single piece of metal. I think hide-and-seek is over.
You've got to be kidding me.
No way.
Vic was shot in the frontal lobe through the windshield. There's no way I could shoot the guy from here and mimic that trajectory.
I got it. Go get some fresh air. 
I heard on the scanner. Quadruple. Figured you might need a hand.
No. 
Blood swirl on the wall. Are you thinking cult? Manson?
Her soul's still in the room.
Yes, sir.
You want me inside?
You're kidding me, right? I'm a taxi service on the biggest case of the year?
Look, brass, I don't see why I got to take her. I'm a scientist. Catherine's the mom. Ask her.
What about Family Services? Can't they take her?
I am not good with kids.
That's very pretty. 
Or not. 
Want to go for another ride? 
I'll take that as a yes.
Hey, Brenda.
What ... what's the head exam for?
Look, if there's any forensic evidence found during this exam, I need to be there.
It's okay, Brenda. 
I'm not leaving you.
Hey, heard you have a suspect.
Hello. How does she explain that?
So a non-family member was out there.
Kids smoke them. They think there's less carbon monoxide.
The shrink says the kid is in a catatonic state from a trauma. I could've told you that. But she did respond to the name Buffalo.
She freaked out.
Going back to the girl. 
I left her in the car. 
The windows are cracked. 
Give me a little credit. She's at the hospital.
Yeah?
There were no overt signs. Why?
This... is a very special camera. It can see deep into your skin. It can see things nobody can see. How about I take a picture of me first, okay? 
See? It's okay. 
Okay.
All ready?
Okay.
Damn it. Look at all those bruises.
Off the board?
Ah. I missed that one.
This guy's good.
This guy is good. Whose prints are these?
Wow.
Yes, sir.
Hey, Evans.
Hmm. Find anything unusual?
Well, it's not likely. His suicide was staged.
I don't know.
Wow. This stuff rocks. I love bathrooms. Last time I printed a hotel bathroom, I had over 1,000 prints.
Okay ... close the doors and hit the lights, daddy-O.
Not a single print. 
Yeah. This guy's a real pro. Not only did he wipe it clean -- it's sterile.
Coming right up. Let's see if we can find out who this Licker is. 
What do you got?
What about the envelope with the upside-down stamp?
He's toying with us.
Anonymous.
I did some comparative digging on both victims -- Royce Harmon and Stuart Rampler. Both are white males in their 40s, single and ... both have the same birthday.
Yeah.
I'm gone.
...and it'll fly away.
What does the dove symbolize? Peace.
It wouldn't be that hard to lift and replant.
Typing in search word: Paul Millander. Here it is. Paul Millander: 
Age 42, five-eleven, male caucasian. Address not on file. No criminal record.
There's no listing, Grissom.
I got something out of the newspaper index.
Two hotel security guards exonerated in alleged 'staged' suicide. Boy's testimony shaky. Paul Millander, age ten, testified that he watched in the closet while his father, John, was escorted by two hotel security guards into his own bathtub at gunpoint where he was found shot to death. Official cause of death was ruled ...
Catherine, you were right. August 17, 1959, it's a pattern.
Brass said the curtain was shut. The Flight Attendant kept them separated. They disembarked through the rear.
Too much damage for one guy.
Driver's license ... library card ... organ donor card.
He had a family.
David ... it's always a shame.
Put your seat back and tray table in their upright position. I don't think so.
Maybe that's where the action started.
Who was sitting in 4B?
Well, the guy in 4B was knocking them back pretty good.
Could be dried blood.
Marlene Valdez was sitting in 2E.
The lavatory.
No evidence.
One step ahead of you, every so often.
I take it that's not blood.
Oh, the mile-high club. That means the two passengers may have had no idea what was going on inside that cabin.
Well ... it's good. I don't know if it's that good.
Cite your source.
You're avoiding the question. Enhances sexual experience. Increases euphoria. Cite your source.
What magazine?
Never heard of it.
Oh ... now you want to go down that route?
Nah. Never mind.
Delta Airlines, Flight 1109, Boston-Miami, March '93, Ken Fuller. Hazel eyes, Organic Chem Lab TA, BMOC ... overrated ... in ... every aspect.  Could ... we ... get back to work, please?
Fine.
Handprints.  A stallion.
That guy was wearing khakis, right?
We get anything else off the clothes?
Hey.
Looks like a shoe sale. Uh, Nick sent these photo comparisons over from the lab.
Where are they?
These look like they weren't even used. There was more lubricant in the bathroom. It's pretty negligent for a doctor. She's got to know every commercial airline carries defib paddles.
I want to be Shannon. Good.
Excuse me -- it's Flight Attendant.
Let me guess -- you're the computer geek.
So, I walk over ...
... try to calm the guy down, but he won't quit.
Warrick -- I mean, Marlene -- that's when you got up and grabbed the broken wine neck.
Shannon's vapor-locked.
Hey, guys! If you jump a guy at the exit, he dies at the exit.
Hey.
Those people should be going to jail not some hotel on the Strip.
I know you're not condoning what they did.
Feeling vulnerable is not a defense and where they were is irrelevant. They took a life.
I don't care what you say. I could never take a life.
Yeah, well, we were just talking about murder and whether we would commit it. I couldn't, Warrick could and Nick's on the fence. We're taking an exit poll.
You didn't even hesitate.
What do you think, Grissom?
I'm sorry. What are you saying?
Eight rolls. Two copies. Case is hot. Put a rush on it.
Lose an earring?
He was restrained. Some sort of tape.
Braun had company.
Where's the purge? Car blows its engine, there's an oil leak. A guy ODs, where's the body fluid? Urine, vomit, excrement.
Interesting love bites on the chest.
And he's posed.
When did you know this was a homicide and not an O.D.?
Yeah.
I have gone through every garbage can in the house.
First thing I checked. Zip.
Ooh, ooh, watch it! Evidence.
Cracker box. It was all stuck together, muckety-muck. I don't want to ruin any potential prints but I saw this TV dinner commercial and it hit me. I'm going to put it in the freezer.
Nice. Let's see if that's where my print came from.
Oh, listen to you. Would you rather hit a home run in the fourth or the bottom of the ninth?
Let me ask you something. Braun collected silver -- coins, bullion -- 23 tons of it. Why bury it in Blue Diamond?
What good's collecting silver coupons when you're dead?
You're telling us the prints on that tape aren't his or hers?
This is ridiculous.
Your prints came back unknown, too?
What about the brother?
Curt was digging up the silver to protect Janine's interest.
Couple of things on the priority list that haven't been processed yet: Tape lifts, adhesive residue, I got the earring back.
Living room, near the body.
Hey.
Nice of you to show up.
No.
Who died and made you boss?
Grissom gave you shift tonight.
Hey. Are you baking a cake? What's the hold up on my pills?
He didn't pass me over.
Grissom.
Activated carbon. Activated charcoal pills. Best antacid in the world. Coats the stomach and absorbs all impurities.
Our con man's a mule?
Without the pills, one bite of a chocolate bar would produce enough gastric acid in his stomach to eat away the balloon. Causing him to O.D.
Speaking of which I found airline stubs in Avery's shirt.
Vincent Avery was four-A, Ellie Rebecca was four-B. Strange, right, using two first names?
Hey, don't make me feel bad for doing my job.
What do you want from me? I'm working the case, the case is hot.
Clear.
Every serial number -- evidence.  bills have traces of cocaine on them?
Oh, yeah.
Hey, Ronnie you know what the intaglio script is.
I don't see it on this bill. Do you?
On a genuine bill, the words United States of America are written on the border of Ben Franklin's portrait. On the Ortons' bill the intaglio script is blacked out.
What about pigmentation? Treasury seals and serial numbers are the same color, right?
Who do we notify? Treasury?
I'll put these back in the evidence room.
Wait till the Ortons find out what we do with counterfeit money.
Well, it's counterfeit. We have to take it out of circulation.
Mr. Orton, you don't look so surprised.
Because it's in violation of Title 18, Section 473 of the United States Code punishable by up to fifteen years for knowingly passing on bad money.
Do you have a $20 bill? 
Uh, I may have something. You see that ghost? Right there on the right? 
Government embeds them in all bills. Protects against forgeries. You should see Lincoln on the five; he looks really stressed out.
A Special Agent from Secret Service is going to want to talk to you about the final disposition of this case.
You were with Brass's daughter. I didn't want to interrupt you.
Agent Beckman? I'm Sara Sidle. We spoke on the phone. Could you excuse us for a minute?
Warrick ... 
This is why I didn't bring this to you.
I didn't not tell him. I ran with the case. I do it with Grissom all the time.
I didn't say it.
No, but it did get me thinking. If something doesn't feel right it probably isn't. Take a look. This is the money we got from the con man. See the serial numbers? Each one is different.
That's what threw Ronnie and I off the scent. This couple didn't make one bill and run off 100 copies with the same serial number. 
They had to burn separate plates for each serial number. 
Much harder to catch.
You mean the Ortons.
How long have you known that?
You federal guys are sneaky.
It's your money now. Well, the Treasury's.
Hey! I'm still part of this.
I don't tag along.
AB Dick forty-nine ten  offsets this is the Rolls Royce of printers. Closest thing to what the government uses. Multiple inks. Disaperf computer paper.
Mr. Duffy, can Agent Beckman and I see your burn plates please.
Press, ink, paper, burn plates ... the only question now is ... where's the money? Mr. and Mrs. Duffy?
Oh, come on. You can print a million dollars a day with this operation. Where is it?
Excuse me? I don't get this. Beckman ... 
Passed?
I don't ... 
What if Vincent Avery wasn't murdered in that parking lot?
Wow. I don't feel that at all.
Hey.
Funny, very funny. 
Oh, look, shift's over. Guess you're one of us again.
Hey. Dispatch said suspicious circs.
You got a name?
A Fairmont Home, You'll Never Roam? Those billboards are everywhere.
Collar's off to the side, leg fabric's gathered.
We'll meet you there.
You never heard that phrase?
Thanks.
I know. The room's talking to us. They had champagne. 
They were celebrating something. 
No lipstick on either glass. 9-1-1 did say it was a man's voice that placed the call.
They kept the drapes open. A married man who's not worried about ... photographs, long lenses ... 
Or he has a death wish.  34 C? If he was with a woman, who was the guy on the 911 call?
The average American hotel room is covered with stains invisible to the naked eye.
No matter how clean or expensive the room seems that why always travel with nonoxinol nine.
Soda, maybe ... maybe champagne ... oh! Someone's little soldiers ... more champagne.
Hmm.
Rooms only on one side. Murder Central.
Why did he throw it?
I wonder if the woman has any idea she left her DNA behind?
Sure.
Semen. No surprise there.
I'm more interested ... in who the woman is.
What the heck?
Stripes.
Transverse white bands that appear six weeks after the onset of symptoms of toxicity.
They look like mees lines to me.
Or white striae, indicative of heavy metal poisoning.
Don't take this wrong, Dr. Robbins, but ... how do you release a body that's been redressed and dumped in an elevator?
The whole transplant thing didn't raise a flag?
Great.
I know that place.
Good. I'll drive. 
You're not coming?
Okay.
How long's he been in here?
Same person who approved the organ transplants.
We don't know the dose or the duration but we do know the type of poison. We processed your husband's remains. 
Most poisons would be completely burned off by cremation but heavy metals are very resistant to heat. This heavy metal -- selenium. 
Did you notice that your husband's breath might have been garlicky?
The body will excrete demethyl selenide -- smells just like garlic.
The white stripes on his fingernails--did you notice those?
That bother you, him never being home?
Did you know that the most common choice of premeditated murder among women is poison? They cite its passivity.
You cremated his body.
Do you want us to notify you?
When we find out the exact amount of selenium given to your husband and over what period of time?
Your husband's gone, but his organs are still out there.
Nick struck out on the kidney. I got four no's over the phone. One yes from a recipient in Illinois-- heart.
Why can't we cut the middle man and just check the wife's house for selenium?  All right, I know, something about constitutional law. Get probable cause, then get a search warrant ...
Sorry, Greggo-- hot case. I'm going to go look at Nick's champagne bottle. How you doing with our DNA?
Nice.
Guys? You're not going to believe this.
Funny sometimes it is the simplest things that seems so difficult. I've been trying to match the partial from the champagne bottle to these known prints. It was upside down.
Mrs. Fairmont.
Fairmont had three gold crowns. They should've survived the cremation.
His wife ... had them removed at the mortuary. That adds new meaning to the phrase gold digger.
Now they just marry them. In some countries, this would be enough to have her arrested for murdering her husband.
Poison.
Greg?
From the internet?
I could really, really just kiss you right now.
The secretary, ten years ago her husband, John Gideon.
Claudia's rich husband also died young-- 35.
We don't have to chase down these organs. Ralph Parks rejected the organ that he got from Claudia's husband.
The most. Liver. 
He died two months after receiving it back in '93. Lived one state over in Arizona. I have the cemetery address.
Awesome. We'll keep you posted.
Nick, did you get anything 
That's murder.
This is different than the shampoo compound.
Animals? Like cats, dogs?
To make up for the lack of selenium nutrient in the soil. How did Claudia get access to this stuff?
Yeah.
Our Julia Fairmont.
Ten years ago, you played secretary and you played wife.
Animal selenium, the kind used for cattle.
Implicating you, the secretary.
I don't believe this.
And then what? The two of you realized how quickly you could run through a couple million? So you went looking for another mark here in Nevada?
Brass doesn't have anything?
I like either one of them for the murder-- so will a jury.
Wait. What? So, what, and just let them move on to another state, another husband?
What are we doing? Digging up graves, chasing prints -- if it's no good in court ... if the killers win ...
I know that. I do. I know that. That's why I'm mad. 
You just said ... This is one of your riddles isn't it?
Uh, Grissom ...
The one thing you don't want to find at a murder scene.
I processed the crime scene. Lots of treads and tracks, but nothing salient.
I came up empty. I worked from the victims out till I hit the highway. Nothing. Nothing to process, no follow-up, zip. 
You have something.
Blond or brunette?
Twelve hundred miles and it's an older model. Driver doesn't get out much. 
Could be our blond. Related to Joan Marks. I'll check with DMV.
That's her.
She went through that door.
To take out one of these doors you need some serious momentum. 
Still going to be a long couple of days at the lab.
Or maybe her sister stepped in it. There was some blood on Joan Marks' right shoe. 
If Joan did step in Donna's blood that would mean that Donna was injured and bleeding while Joan was still walking around.
Sweet and sour pork.
Single servings in the back, spoiled. Family sized boxes in front, one or two days old.
Well, we already know she cooks like I do -- takeout on speed dial. 
Pottery barn, Lillian Vernon magnolia, Yafa Pen ... She's a catalogue junkie -- we're on the same mailing lists.
Ah, that's you talking.
I'll haul in her PC, check her e-mail look in on her social life.
Hey ... the toilet seat's up.
There was a man here.
Hey, Brass. Heard the database kicked out a Temporary Restraining Order. Joan Marks against her old boyfriend.
Tit for tat.
Don't mind if I do.
According to you. When did you see her last?
What was she driving?
Did she tell you she was going to her sister's?
What about you? You been to Donna's house recently?
May I ... see the bottom of your shoes?
Why not?
I like the shoes. I like them enough to get a warrant.
Donna Marks was a telecommunicator. Liked to shop. Mail order, over the phone. I retrieved lots of email confirmations.
Need for human contact.
She spent time in chat rooms. Book clubs, home crafts collected fountain pens.
Only one buddy on her buddy list. Screen name's Apollo.
That would be three days ago.  I know it sounds weird, but ... my life began when I first heard your voice ... 
It's easy to wear your heart on your sleeve when you're not looking in his eyes. He said her name so their relationship must've extended beyond the computer.
You know that garbage those numbers at the bottom of every email?
It's actually a unique number that registers the location of the sender's terminal.
Internet Protocol Address. CSI has access. Seven different IP addresses means he used seven different computers.
Could be a network.
23000 Ganza Avenue, Ely, Nevada. Western Nevada Correctional Facility.
Hey.
How's the glass puzzle going?
Triangular. That means it can't be clothing fiber.
Yeah ... but that still doesn't get us anything. We found both vics near the freeway. We've been thinking vehicle transport from the start.
I'll ask him ... and his lawyer. The blood from his shoe was consistent with Donna Marks' DNA-- he lied. He was at the house.
Also a match. Joan and Gavin ... both stepped in Donna's blood.
We already know that. 
Broken glass a pool of blood.
Gavin, what color's your car? Your missing Thunderbird?
Interior?
But we will.
Hey. Brass is holding the boyfriend on a TRO violation. I'm going back to the lab to process the prints we lifted from the toilet seat. Guy claims he was in and out. I'm thinking no time to make a pit stop.
You did?
What?
Donna's cyber boyfriend? I thought he was in jail.
So she invites you for lunch everything's great. And somewhere between the fortune cookies and sunset ... Donna and her sister are both murdered. Thoughts?
She was vulnerable. No social life, no friends, not even a cat. All she had was her work. She ordered from catalogs to give herself something to look forward to.
Joan's boyfriend, Gavin Pallard -- blood on his shoe and a TRO. Donna's boyfriend, Mickey Rutledge -- opportunity and a rap sheet. Both hid the truth ... until confronted with the evidence.
Nice work.
P.D. Found GAVIN PALLARD'S Thunderbird hidden off the I-69 five miles from the dump site.
Radiator's cracked.
Well ... whoever drove this puppy last filled up the radiator fluid but, instead of coolant, they used water.
Radiator cap. I'll print it.
Hey, Nick.
You ever try to print a radiator cap? Smudge city.
Thank you.
But Joan went off on you. And up to that point, you hadn't done anything wrong. 
You figured if you hid the bodies, you'd be in the clear.
You could've just backed off, let Joan make the call.
you don't know that.
Hey, it's Sara. I was, uh, thinking ... You want to go out ... somewhere?
Yeah, it's true. Gunshot, suicide script leaves the body in a bathtub.
Grissom, Catherine briefed us about your birth date.
Rain washed away everything. What I got will never hold up in court.
This is the point of origin. They stop at the warehouse threshold.
Only one set of prints ... 
He carried the body in. The extra weight explains the deeper impression.
I believe hitchhiking is illegal in Clark County.
So, this is Walker's car. Millander was hitchhiking. Guy stops to do a favor ... ends up dead.
Nice.
It went out the window.
Warrick and I found stippling on the passenger side seat back.
Mud prints -- one set in, one set out.
Okay, how?
Did Walker have any kind of record?
Greg, did you look at the female hair from the crime scene tub?
Well, men and women both have testosterone in their systems. No big deal, right?
What? What do you mean? Like outside the body?
So our mystery lady was trying to enhance her athletic performance?
Not yet anyway. Okay, I'm not sure what this means yet, but thanks.
Yeah, he planted it. He planted his own hair.
With endogenous testosterone. Pauline was taking male hormone injections.
My theory? s*x change.
There is no birth or death record for Pauline.
This is nice.
I cannot believe you brought that up.
Yeah, that-that-that, uh, day we met that-that was, that was very gross. 
Um... I mean, not for me but for everyone else ... for you ...
Yeah.
She barely made eye contact. She dropped the finger on the table and walked out.
Locked up at the coroner's lab, waiting for Dr. Robbins. Unless you want me to wake him up in Kansas City. Brother's wedding, back tomorrow ... 
Top half severed just below the right inter-costal joint.
Yeah, I couldn't tell. There was blood, though.
Like I told Nick, she completely ignored me.
No ... no, looked to me like Catherine was running the show.
It's a bit of a coincidence, though, don't you think? Catherine just showing up at the diner. It's not like she knew I was going to be there.
Thank you, Catherine.
She was burning some serious rubber. Definitely high-end tires -- there's colored flecks on the treads and they're fresh. 
It's got to be the Lexus. Does this mean anything to you?
Yeah.
Looks like the drop-off went down.
Thank you.
Looks like a small tear.
If the body was wrapped with this side that's on the outside.
It's not blood.
This is a grease stain. It's got an oily residue.
Yeah.
Peanut butter.
You got to admit, his solution was ingenious.
If not by the police, by his wife.
Why though? The money was in a suitcase.
How could he possibly know that Catherine was going to mark the money?
Wow, you got to go to the body farm?
I've always wanted to go there. What was it like?
What, bad milk? Cottage-cheese bad?
Yeah. He's got one of his experiments in there.
Not bugs.
So, this is your experiment, huh? So, because you found beef in the wound tracts of the victim, you think the meat might be from one of the body farm cows?
I did an experiment similar to this in San Francisco except the cross-contamination was blood. Wasn't a murder case, but it was instructional.
Hmm, what does that mean?
Uh, Grissom ... aren't you going to tell me anything?
The case, the meat, what you found ...?
I thought I was working it with you.
That meat... the raw meat... me?
How many meals have we shared together?
Take a guess -- over a year working together.
I'm a vegetarian. Everyone here knows I'm a vegetarian. I haven't eaten meat since we stayed up that night with that dead pig. It pains me to see ground beef; forget about cleaning it up.
Almost finished.
Acetone, methyl methacrylate? Nail polish remover.
It's, uh, just what it says: It's a request for a leave of absence -- six months ... year, maybe.
I was thinking of checking out the federal government system - FBI ...
I need a different work environment.
One with, um, communication ... respect.
You don't.
No, Grissom ... this is not about that Hamburger thing. I-I-I don't believe you. How can you reduce everything that I've said to some kind of single quirk? Do you think the problem here is just about me? 
If you don't sign my leave, I'm going to have to quit.
Great.
Boys will be boys.
You just don't like sports.
Baseball. Well, that figures. All those stats.
Since when are you interested in beauty?
Sure.
It's not much to go on. Maybe we should be looking off the ice.
Charlie Brown. I love a zamboni.
Yeah?
Pile of ice measures nine feet by five feet ... by ... nine feet. Without the calculus, I'd estimate ... a hundred cubic feet. Current temperature, one degree celsius.
Let's ballpark it.
120 minutes for a tooth ... the whole tooth ... and nothing but the tooth.
Take your pick. Testing for blood on a hockey jersey it's like handing out jaywalking tickets at a marathon.
You sucked at team sports, huh?
Chess is not a sport, Greg.
I think sports are physical by definition.
Not to me.
These blades skated through the blood pool.
Blood spatter. Good guess -- this is the one that did the damage.
These blades are probably set at a quarter of an inch.
And deadly in a fight.
Not now ... but you used to.
He was a stationary target. Terry was on the bottom of all those bodies. 
You okay? You all right?
Morning sickness?
Little lie, big lie.
She wasn't showing. She's skinny as a rail. But ... still, why lie about it?
I wonder if she would know who the father is... or was.
It's enough to get us a warrant.
We could search Jane Gallagher's apartment. See if Terry Rivers might have left anything behind.
Bye, Greg.
There are semen stains everywhere. Not very Victoria Secret.
Beauty, Grissom. Remember? 
With all the s*x these people are having maybe I should take up hockey.
I got your page. What's the big news?
What? I thought it belonged to the dead guy.
Is that why you hated Terry?
You're the captain of the rat pack. You make it so everyone gets a shot in and no one takes the blame -- it's a win-win situation.
You know we got his medical records. Let me ask you a question. When Terry came to did he tell you what had happened to him?
What did you do?
... and what's the difference?
Yeah.
Right here.
Didn't have access to quinine let alone know it would kill him.
Terry was a roughneck. He dished it out so the other players dished it out harder.
Someone besides Terry had to know.
Anyone with access to Terry's medical records knew how to kill him.
Malaria in Las Vegas. No wonder they were out of stock.
So you're the go-to guy?
Italy. That's pretty serious.
And you knew, doctor. Terry Rivers had a heart condition.
Jane told us she paid you a visit a couple of days ago. She thought she had the flu ... but she didn't. She's pregnant. And with the father out of the way, you knew who she would turn to.
State your source.
Rug's low pile, smooth. I'll try to dust-lift.
Gold statues ... money trees ... that's a lot of loot to leave behind. 
Gangbangers? At a Buddhist Temple?
Yeah, but just 'cause you're stashing trash doesn't make you a killer.
I found some boot prints on the prayer room rug. Monks don't wear boots, right, Nick?
I also found a smudge with some trace material on a small statue. It was a partial, some ridge detail, but not make-able and a wad of gum that was stuck to the big Buddha. All of which is definitely pointing to an outside job.
You know those prints that Nick and I got off the rifle?
Well, I better talk fast, then. The prints are only telling half the story. You know when a shooter holds a gun ...
... he grips the barrel and he wraps his index finger around the trigger? 
Ananda never fingered the trigger.
On the weapon, but definitely not where they should be.
He held the rifle by the stock, barrel pointing down.
No. Anticipating your next question, the rifle's not registered.
That chewing gum -- is with DNA.
Proud U.S.
The coffee shop?
Sure.
Uh, Grissom, I found these on the front seat.
You were there, weren't you?
I feel so useless.
It's a pretty wide area up there. Are we clear to call in for help?
Four-point sweep.
Shreds of rubber everywhere. Between the crash, and all the other interstate traffic it might as well be the Indy 500. This stuff could be from any vehicle.
You mean that Grissom look?  Second set of skid marks. Camaro.
If this is the bus ... the bus begins to slide right. Driver overcorrects.
Meanwhile the Camaro's holding steady in the right lane heading straight for us.
Taking out anything in its path.
Bus crosses four lanes of traffic and only takes out the car behind it?
A bolt? Nice. I got twenty of them.
It is, isn't it?
Bolts are graded according to their hardness. The higher the grade, the stronger the steel.
Bus company was using bogus bolts.
The gouge in the road.
Nope, only two sets of fresh skid marks on that stretch of highway.
I know. I want to wait. 
Greg? You're really good at what you do.
Sabotage.
Grissom.
I didn't see it.
But why did the tire come apart in the first place?
I do. Chloroform. Inside the tire.
I found chloroform in the interior fragments of the rubber.
Yeah, I'll be at trace. They're going to love this.
You busy?
Then I have a question for you. 
Uh-huh. 
No, he didn't.
Listen, I-I found chloroform on the inside of a steel-belted radial and I need to know how it got there.
Not in a scientific context, no.
Yes.
Chloroform, glass rod, valve core remover ....  according to Vincent and Trace, it's like pissing down a rope.
Reattach the valve ... reinflate the tire ...
...and you're done. Minute, minute and a half tops.
Ah, yeah, I'm going to go dust that right rim. I'll see you guys.
Print off the rim maybe he had a work card on file-- a Sean Nolan. 
I pulled up his DMV records looking for an address. I found one, not recent, but ... he's got a class B license with passenger endorsement.
I cross-checked his name with the employee roster from Mojave Express.
He's a driver.
Hello.
Cool.
And I got a hit off that print -- a Sean Nolan, employed by Mojave Express.
Uh, his route is ... Vegas/Grand Canyon but I'll call Warrick. He's on his way to the bus company right now.
And I quote, in his off time, he enjoys creating and inventing toys. That's fascinating. What kind of toys do you make, Nick?
Greg.
Yay.
And according to the phone records the guy called Jane thirteen times the day of the murder.
Hey, Brass? Isn't that his car?
Control, this is P-9241 requesting backup and medical assistance. The 1800 block of Newhaven Road. Possible 419.
Sir, are you okay? You all right? You seem injured.
Any idea how you got this blood?
Adam, we're analyzing the blood that we found on your shirt with the blood of your girlfriend. It's going to tell us everything that we want to know.
She had a TRO against you. Something must have happened to spook her.
Well, that's interesting because according to her phone records, she never did ... call the cops.
Adam? That's not all you were taking last night.
Secretary at a brokerage firm. About three weeks from the day of her death she took a leave of absence.
She saw Dr. Slater. Had a prescription for valium and librium.
Severe anxiety due to personal reasons. One day back from leave, Jane quits her job. No notice. Hotel receipts show she checked into the Monaco for two nights.
A week before that she goes on a frightened woman shopping spree.
Hardware shop receipts for locks. Locksmiths. Alarm installations. Phone screeners. The voice on her answering machine-- electronic. She change her telephone number. She cancels all but one of her credit cards.
Make no mistake. Jane Galloway was being stalked. Emotional terrorism at its finest.
Here's the, uh, worst part. Uh, I ran a phone check on all her incoming calls. Guess where they were coming from.
Will do, thank you, doctor.
Now, did you not just hear the doctor? You're supposed to rest. We're on it, okay?
How's it going?
Well, groggy. How's the epic?
Found that photo of Nick and his prom date. Used Jane Galloway to emulate the photo?
Nick has satellite cable, right?
Twenty-five years to life, Nick. It's over.
Hey, scent dogs are on their way. 
What about getting out?
I talked to her R.A. Paige had put in a request to have all her mail forwarded, including her security deposit.
Toothpaste-- poor man's spackle. It's an old college trick-- covers up the holes when the posters come down.
Five Hundred Dollars. That huge money at her age if you actually get it. That's a big college racket, like buying books back?
Two beds. Roommate?
Area rug? Could've been used to conceal a body on the way out.
How did you know where to print?
DNA, blood and semen.
I need you in the lab.
Yes. Somebody must have seen or heard something.
It's called zeal, Greg.
Blood's not hers.
That's not all. Check out the tox screen.
Date rape drug.
We may have two victims -- one missing, one raped.
That dorm room is cursed.
You thought you should, uh, wait for a female.
Jennifer, we found forensic evidence in your old dorm room. We believe you were sexually assaulted while under the influence of Rohypnol. 
Two women. Same dorm room. 
Do you want to talk alone?
Why would a rapist voluntarily give up his DNA?
Ah, the old Bait and Switch.
Yeah, but what if someone refuses?
Open.
Are you refusing?
Too bad this doesn't get us any closer to finding Paige.
Yeah. Not much, but enough to work with.
Still, there's no reason to think there's a connection between the paint transfer and Paige.
She could have rented, borrowed it from a friend.
It was a clean strike against the dumpster.
We still have Mrs. Woodbury.
Two box springs, two mattresses two desks... two lamps, two chairs, two dressers. 
Trash can?
And it's missing. 
Take out the trash.
Paige dumps the trash, goes back to her room. How does she end up in the dumpster?
Okay.  Whoa. Almost took my hand off.
She wanted her security deposit back.
Explosives. It's been a while.
I guess I got the driver.
Ms. Tobin? Hi. I'm with the Crime Lab. Mind if I ask you a few questions?
Thanks. Can you tell me what happened?
Ms. Tobin, where did you last park your car?
And who would have access?
Anything probative?
Uh-huh.
Bombs are personal.
Yeah, a hired hit on a housewife.
Did you know there's a dozen moving parts inside a ticking clock?
End cap?
I will see your end cap and raise you a grommet.
Not in the bomb, itself, but embedded in the end cap. The wires from the timing device enter the pipe through a hole in the grommet.
When the timing device is activated, it sets off an electrical charge that detonates the explosives inside the pipe.
I don't know, but they always do.
Mr. Claddon are you a Demolitions expert?
Do you personally know how to make a bomb?
Not enough, apparently, to be there for her last night.
Can you tell us about your son-in-law?
Does Johnny have access to explosives?
Mr. Tobin, do you fingerprint your employees?
Hey.
Happy?
I got a perfect print off the end cap. Husband.
Why didn't you tell us this before?
What kind of tool leaves evenly-spaced vertical striations?
A vice grip?
Marcie?
Maybe we should talk alone.
Okay. Listen - about your marriage -- your father said ...
Hey. You got a head start.
Ah! One more vice grip compliments of the Tobin/Claddon household.
Aw ... teeth aren't even the same size.
We're out of luck.
What happened?
That means the bomb was triggered 60 seconds before detonation, one rotation of the second hand.
Something Marcie Tobin touched inside the car?
Ignition, door locks window, radio, A/C ... turning signals, hazard lights ... 
Okay, she pulls into the lot, she gets out of the car, and she asks for help.
So, she pops the hood for him.
How is that possible? The mechanic saw the bomb.
Okay, maybe he took one look at it, and he slammed the hood.
No, I would back away fast. Um... maybe the hood dropped?
Liar, liar, car on fire.
And they're not.
You're not wearing them now.
Mind if we take a look around the garage?
Mechanics use vice grips?
No.
But ... we can improvise. Trash is trash.
Thanks ... I'll take the prints on those.
Marcus Remmick. Arrested for fraud in 1994. He was selling used parts as new. Prints are in AFIS, but they don't match the vice grip. And, in fact, AFIS drew a blank.
I'm running a Tobin C&amp;D database.
Even a shot in the dark hits sometimes.
Not only did you put a bomb in your car -- you made it yourself.
But if Johnny goes down for attempted murder, he goes to jail and you get to keep everything, because a criminal can't benefit from his own malfeasance.
You and Marcus tag-teamed us. You never popped the hood; he never shut it-- it was latched.
Oh, and Johnny's getting a promotion.
Wait. We got a call about a dead body.
Clothing's been reduced to shreds. Epidermal tissue. Is virtually gone. The body's desiccated.
Must have thought it would destroy the body.
If you touch the soil you're going to contaminate my crime scene, but I'll let you know when I'm finished.
Vic's wallet, what's left of it. It's a Nevada License. Bob Martin. 31. He lived downtown. There's 20 bucks in the flap. Rules out robbery.
Look at this.
What'd the ranger say?
Time of death?
Car? What car?
Just confirms death wasn't immediate?
Are you his domestic partner?
But he didn't come home Monday night ...
Photo department kept a log. Bob Martin reserved a darkroom on Mondays from 10:00 to 11:00 P.M. He was logged in Monday night.
He left these photos behind. They're all of the same woman. I bet it's his wife.
I got a piece of plastic. Looks like a headlight cover, maybe. This could be our crime scene.
Assuming this was a hit-and-run how does a guy with two broken legs end up on the other side of town buried in a park, covered in lye?
What are you looking for? 
If this is our crime scene then somewhere between here and Sunset Park, Bob Martin lost eight to ten pints of blood.
Where is it?
I've been looking for you.
Oh, uh, sorry about that but Brass got me a list of those Mercedes owners. One moved to Los Angeles, three are over 50. My guess, they would have stopped and rendered aid. Brass is checking them out which leaves a Ben Weston, 25. Leased the vehicle last week.
You wouldn't happen to have a copy of that police report, would you?
Sarasota Silver, S-Series, stolen Monday night.
Mr. Weston, we'd like to take a look at those clothes.
Nice suit.
I hope you didn't just buy the shirt.
Well, maybe you shouldn't have gotten lye on it. Lye is an alkali and when it's mixed with water, it eats right through fabric. Mr. Weston ... you mind taking off your shirt?
Lye can burn through fabric. It can also burn through skin.
So where is the vehicle now?
Affirmative for blood -- passenger side.
Want to pass me the luminol?
Maybe the driver hit Bob Martin, stopped and put him in the front seat.
Well, not to the Emergency Room. Not to Sunset Park for 48 hours. I'll swab the rest of the car -- bring the samples to Greg and have him run it against Bob Martin's DNA.
... maybe it belongs to an injured joyrider and we have a new suspect.
All that blood belonged to the victim.
That's a strange place for blood.
Okay. But where did it fall from?
Huh?
We ... we would have caught that.
Yeah. So how did the thief turn the engine over without breaking that lock?
Take off your shirt, please.
You want to refuse? One of us will remove it for you.
The warrant is for the whole shirt.
I hate lawyers.
Yeah, that figures.
I'll check for blood.
Maybe the garage was full.
Hey. So I checked with auto detail. Uh, obviously, if you fill a car up with enough water or, in our case, blood it's going to leak through the bottom.
The head of the victim crashed into the passenger side of the windshield.
Okay, I'm thinking that the car clipped the victim here and he was catapulted ... and he was positioned something like this.
We know where Bob Martin was. Where was Ben Weston?
You know ... the tow truck driver said Weston's Mercedes was totaled. But the only damage would have been to the bumper and the windshield. He's lying.
There goes the slam dunk. Blood in the garage would have conclusively linked victim to killer.
Sunset Park is two miles from Ben Weston's house. I was thinking maybe he used this car to transport the body to the dump site.
No visible trace of any kind. Except for this.
And I brought the music. 
You know the law. You hit a guy. It was an accident. Nothing criminal. But you let it escalate to first-degree murder. I spoke with your senior partner. It was your first day on the job. Big firm. Big welcome. How many drinks did you have that night?
Not right now.
Where did you find this?
Thanks.
This suicide letter was written by Bob Martin to his wife Charlotte. When you hit him Monday night it wasn't an accident. 
You were off the hook.
Okay.
Hey, Nick ... ?
You ever been to a swingers' party?
Frat party, huh? I wouldn't know anything about that. 
How wild?
Who's she?
Showing but not telling. I found a day planner in the shopping cart.
It's written in code. T to the third power. C 1023, minus ten O.K. equals zero.
Yeah. I write everything down in shorthand. You couldn't read it.
Keeps things in order.
No.
That handbag costs $300?
How'd you know that?
Oh.
Contextualizing. Shopping cart in the lab is like a lion in a zoo. I needed to see it in its natural habitat.
She didn't walk.
Grissom ... is that Ashleigh James?
She was under her own billboard.
Somebody was making a point.
Hey. You like crossword puzzles. How are you at deciphering codes?
About the victim? 
Well, aside from the leather day runner and the Kate Swan bag -- which appear to be from Ashleigh James's world -- you got mostly collectibles. Newspapers, review journals, the Sun ... various editions going back several months. A couple of tennis rackets ... 
... a broom, an umbrella, a pot ... I guess some kind of glove or something.
Or a fanatic.
I got crabs.
I got crabs. Take a look.
Like one of the victim's neighbors.
Tells me the victim not only had a visitor but that visitor was most likely homeless.
And go home? No way. You know, this day runner belonged to Ashleigh.
BFJ3. BF: Bellagio Fountain.
That's what I thought at first.
Nope. Once you pick it up, you can't put it down.
You're cold. What's one thing a model always knows? 
Who's shooting her. Three Js. Jay Jay Jarrett.
Famous photographer. Compliments of P.D.: Ashleigh James's employment contracts for the last year. And, as an aside she stopped working two months ago.
Good question.
Maybe the answer is in one of these pages.
T 3. 1834 BC.
48 BF ...
T 3... 1834 BC ... 48 BF.
2 EVO'D ... 8 G ...  1 TU ... 
You must have been so desperate.
... So what I realized was bulimia is a zero sum disease. That's why she has a plus sign over here and a minus sign over there. Whatever went in had to be exactly canceled by what went out.
Yes. One theory suggests it's neurobiological. Another psychological -- that people with extreme sexual or emotional anxiety unconsciously displace their feelings into the arena of appearance, because it's more manageable.
Meticulous grooming, when a person suffers from BDD becomes a destructive compulsion. There's one line in her daybook that keeps repeating over and over and over again: I'm not even.
No.  She literally means even. A large number of BDD sufferers are convinced that they're not symmetric. That one side of their body or their face doesn't match the other.
The bottom line is the same: Control and Perfectionism. That's what her code was all about.
Let's take HBWC/3, 1590 BC, 90 BF, 3930 S, 114 TC. Three hamburgers with cheese. 
Content 530. 530 times three is where she gets 1590 BC. That's BC for bad calories. And at 30 grams a pop 90 grams of BF.
Yeah. The rest of her formula involves sodium, total carbohydrates and the actual weight of everything she ate.
Or disappear altogether. Which brings me to the minus side of her equation. She would write down the number of times she T'U'D, threw up, in this case twice-- or EVO'D.
Moving her bowels. The directions on her disposable enema box use the term evacuate. So, after her burger binge, she 3 EVO'd, 14 G, 2 T'U'D, 9 G, 3 #1. She evo'd three times. But her calculations didn't stop there ... G stands for grams.
Input and output down to the last quarter gram.
I don't know what I'm looking for.
Yeah. But we always go back to the body. The body tells a story and in this case, the body says there was no crime and you're not listening. Why?
Like, for instance, when we don't agree with the coroner's report?
Germs.
Relevance ...
The rubber soles of his boots should have protected him from the electrical shock. That is why you're safe when you're in a car during a lightening storm. You're insulated by the rubber tires.
A nail.
Hey.
How's that palm print Grissom got off those cutters?
Nice.
I don't know. We found a nail in his boot. It could have pierced the protective rubber. It might have allowed electricity to course through his body.
Fired?
Yeah, yeah, we do. The, um ... it's a former union guy turned night shift project manager.
Waiting for an assignment. You got a new case for us?
No, because ... 
I'll compared it to Bob Harris' ten card. Anything else?
Okay.
Warrick.
I got a thumbprint off that nail.
Only a partial. Print lab's running a comparison.
Serrations didn't match up. They weren't used on the grounding prong. What's in the envelope?
You want lunch?
Egg salad sandwich. You want half?
Yeah. 
You can have it.
You turned my pickle into a light bulb.
You sure are.
There are none.
The iron conducted the electricity.
In through his hand from the drill; out through the nail in the boot.
She's cross-eyed from running our partial. I didn't want to lose any time, so I took over. The database is 70,000. It could still take a while.
We got a suspect?
Partial overlay. Perfect match. Now we've just got to place him at the crime scene.
Wolf stuck a nail in Valenti's boot, compromised the drill and cut the grounding prong with his own cutters.
We quit before we should have.
I'll race you!
Anyone touch the bag since?
I thought you Emergency Service guys were tougher than that.
Down, boy. It was a joke.
Great.
Body's coroner's. Property's ours.
Wouldn't it be easier to just unzip the bag and see what kind of shape our vic is in?
I see a coin. Looks like a half dollar. 
I'd say we're dealing with a man.
Sound? 
Silver dollar.
Ugh.
That's it? No organs? No-no tonsils? No ... 
... soup?
Okay, I'll take liquid man's jacket, see what I can find.
Yeah.
What?
You mean Mr. Cartsen? I found this. It's a nametag. 
Well, it's a start. I'm going to get homicide to check the VA medical database for a W. Cartsen with plates or pins.
What do you got?
God, it reeks! Q.D. Should be able to, uh ... to bring something up. 
Don't tell anyone.
Hi.
Yeah. Um ... I'll be right out. 
Give me a mint.
Just give me.
This is a nice surprise 
Yeah. Um ... when?
Oh, well, I'm in the middle of that D.B. From the gully. He's still a John Doe and we don't know the circumstances ... 
I smell.
I changed clothes ... tho' the problem is that it's human fat reduced and it's attached itself to my follicles and my pores, so ... 
You don't look good.
Ok..
Right.
Okay.
Bye.
I've heard.
Hey, Nick. Ronnie's got something on Liquid Man, says it's hot.
Science nerd.
Roma ... Roman ... nini's... Never heard of it.
When was that?
That's funny we found his body. Coroner says he's been dead two months.
So you didn't hurt him. You just put him in your car. Is that what you're saying?
These ... are the handles from the bag that he was found in. 
You see these prints here?
Any uniformity in the spray?
Blood drops this size are characteristic of high-velocity impact like gunshot trauma but there's no bullet strikes on the walls ... ruling out murder by gun.
This looks like a multiple. More than one vic. Acquainting myself.
Triangle ... coat rack?
No observable blood. Not even with pheno.
How long did Firearms give us these for?
Let's do it.
Same high-velocity spray.
Didn't you say expirating through the nose made oval patterns?
Great. Our big murderer's a nosebleed.
Our guy's girlfriend is still missing.
Or everything.
What are we looking for exactly?
What about Nosebleed's missing girlfriend? You heard Brass. 
He got a-hold of Alison Scott's parents in Canada. They said she never arrived. They had no idea she was even going to see them.
What if nose man blew blood all over these walls to cover up Alison Scott's blood?
You're not finding another layer of blood under there?
You don't think maybe he off'ed his girlfriend?
Fifteen ... give or take.
Fly spots. Regurgitations.
Place is sealed, and they don't spontaneously generate.
Or it could be something higher up the food chain like Alison Scott.
They can egress a space less than .001 centimeters.
Behind you. Vent.
Fly egg casings.
You can contact Captain Brass for that information, sir.
What do you got?
A very important beetle.
There's a dead body in here somewhere.
But you can submit a form to the city for reimbursement.
Now what?
Ahhh ... Not so. According to Grissom -- Mr. Bug Guy -- the silphid beetle will actually feed on any decomposing mammal. So we need to show human DNA or we are not going to get a warrant to break down those walls.
Where's Greg? We need to get this processed. You know, I swear that guy has a second job somewhere else.
Did we get our warrant?
You're Alison Scott?
A square of nine dots on paper and you can only draw four lines to connect them ... without the pen ever leaving the paper.
You've re-plastered this wall recently?
Huh.
Yeah ...
Hold up. Hold up. Hold up.
Alklyd. There's blood on the blanket.
That's Latin for you're hiding a dead body.
You okay?
Excuse me?
You're too hard on yourself.
What's your pulse at now?
You want to take a walk around the block? Get some air?
Clear your head ...
Okay.
Chalk ... from plaster.
Better go wash up.
Hey, you want to grab some breakfast?
Sorry, guys. I lost you at the fork.
Give me your right foot. Other right. Put it down. Lift it up.
Other foot. Lift it up. Put it down.
Flour, maybe?
Trace will probably have a better idea. I'll get DNA to see if there's bits of Ben under the fingernails.
You told me to wait for you.
I did observe some fibers in the wound. I didn't collect them, though.
Yellow. Not cotton; satin, maybe.
Strangled with his own tie?
I cannot tell you why, but I might be able to tell you where. A pizza shop. The flour on Oliver Dunne has a low gluten content -- seven percent protein -- it's typical of flour used to make cakes, pizzas, that kind of thing.
Well, the subtype of flour is another subtype -- double zero. It's a very fine flour used only in pizza-baking ovens. Oh, and trace picked up some oregano in the sample. When are you set to interview Ben?
What is that? A beer can? Soda can?
Zilch.
Whoa... whoa. Point of disturbance.
Grissom ...
Different from the first guy.
Strangers. Doesn't make sense. There's no connection.
Two men were shot and killed and you didn't see anything?
You what?
Pump jockey wasn't very helpful but bullets pulled from victim one and victim two. 
Identical striations. Bullets in both victims were fired by the exact same weapon.
P.D. Can prove through credit cards that Ben frequents the AvCon gas stations where both vics were killed.
And fibers.
I recovered a burgundy fiber from the sock of victim one. Found the same fiber on the sock of victim two.
So we went back to Ben's car.
We got the master standards from the car manufacturer. The assigned name for the material is 12-ounce Merlot-Poly.
Victim blood on his clothes ... Under his nails.
... The holes in Christ's hands, Doubting Thomas?
Does this have anything to do with the priest that's been coming around here?
What's going on?
Yeah.
Anything on the list besides the tie?
Hey, guys.
Whoa.
Hey. Dry cleaning. The trailer's low-rent. Dry cleaning's expensive.
This man's not as smart as he thinks. Dry cleaning bakes in blood stains.
Oh, now you're cautious.
Okay. You check the perimeter and I'll see if we have blood stains or red sauce.
Hemoglobin.  Take a look at this.
Nick?
Hey, Nick.
Is the printer out of ink?  ND, ND, ND.
Try again. This could be victim blood. Try again.
My evidence is no better. Total loss.
Hey. D.A.'S looking for you.
What, you think I read your messages? 
Top Secret and Urgent? It's a gift, reading upside down.
Guess we know what she was calling about.
Man, I hate rushing through a crime scene. Two years from now, no one is going to care that the Sheriff turned this into a scoop and run.
Yeah, well, I'll let you testify on this one.
Hey, little guy. Hey. Hey. Let's see.
His name is Maverick. He lives on Martingale Street in Henderson.
Guess I'll go call animal control.
I'll be right back.
Hey. Come on, boy. Let's get you home.
I am collecting evidence. Do we have an address on the vic yet?
Vic had a passenger. Say hello to Maverick.
Train probably busted out her headlights. First thing on our list when we get to the tow yard.
Catherine ... check this out.
One set going forward ...
The second set of skid marks are darker more rubber residue.
Looks like the tires were spinning in place.
In reverse.
So ... which set of skid marks are telling the story?
Hey, you know that filament you picked up?
The lamp cover's smashed, but the filament's intact.
Well, taillights have different filaments, so ... yeah.
Recent?
I got a cell phone. Battery's dead.
Hey, Catherine ... her emergency brake is still on.
Engineer didn't mention anything about a second driver.
There's no glass on the filament.
Crim 101. If a guy's driving along at night with his lights on ... 
gets in a wreck, glass breaks fuses to the filament.
Instant evidence. But there's no glass on the filament. His headlights weren't on.
Easy for an engineer to miss.
Hard to tell.
Train, too, please.
With the emergency brake on? It doesn't make any sense.
Sounds like the same thing.
She definitely likes you.
Megan Treadwell wakes up at home on Martingale street puts the dog in the car, heads to work at her desk by 9:00 A.M.
Brass. Talked to her boss.
Dog went with her, every day.
Eight, actually. Hard worker.
Except she doesn't go home. She runs an errand. I found these in the front seat of her SUV. There's only one store in Las Vegas that makes them.
Megan.
How did Megan react to Mr. Croft?
His car, out in the parking lot, it's a rental. Rented this morning.
Hey. Brass did the legwork and rushed the warrant. Found it in a body shop a mile from his house.
Gets better. Vic's SUV was silver.
What do you think?
Sustained contact.
Yeah.
She threw her coffee at him.
I hate that word.
Those lids never fit. She nailed him.
Light turns green and the chase is on.
She's got a pursuit on her hands.
And she's still spooked. All she wants now is to get home.
Not without her dog.
I'll call Brass, tell him to make the arrest.
Let me guess -- the guy makes his run same time every week.
Whole thing went down here?
Okay, I'm going to do a once-around.
Hey, Warrick! Check this out!
Grab the money bag, slice it and run.
Let's see.
We got some checks, no cash ... and a deposit slip for $22,500.
Same time every week.
Or... it was an inside job.
Um, Ms. Delgado, I know you're upset ...
So ... you think the brother might be behind this?
Nice scam.
That means whoever put these here wasn't gone long when the brother was shot. 
Potential eyewitness.
Hey, is that our guy?
How often do you distribute around here?
Well, that depends. Did you see anything unusual last night? In the parking lot at Flamingo and Rhodes?
What about the car? Did you notice the make?
According to Vega the vic owns a colt.
And ... since he mysteriously got shot in the leg instead of a vital organ I'm thinking I should go visit him.
You cant' wear them out of here, so what? You want them as a souvenir?
What do you know about the money bag?
Big knife. Great. Tell us something we don't know.
Nice.
It's gotta be transfers from the knife. Red fibers. All uniform length. 
A mold? To make what?
Everybody in the bath business uses isophthalic resin because it's got the highest water resistance. Downside is the stuff gets everywhere. Hair, clothes, skin ...
We found traces of fiberglass and resin in Santee's money bag.
So, how many knives in Vegas come into contact with both those materials? 
Thanks.
We never said what model we were looking for.
Pretty smart, Hector.
Oh, by the way we found the $5,000 you skimmed from this business in your jeans pocket.
Yeah.
It's peaceful.
I thought you said this was a single homicide.
We made it. State trooper.
Officer Spencer, did you touch anything?
Sorry.
Vomit?
A poor man's silencer.
Last paying customer -- eight hours ago.
The assailant flipped the sign on the way out, buying him time to get away.
It's plastic.
Nine volt attached to a blinking light.
Wow. A fumette. Did you get that out of some museum?
If you were in a hurry how would you get back there?
Exactly what I'm thinking.
Shoe prints.
Suspect entered ... 
... shoots the clerk through the potato... then hops up and over, leaving behind shoe prints ... grabs the cash ... flips the sign from
What are you thinking? 
We may be looking for a minor.
Eh, why not? They're in the kit.
Since when do you care about my choice of powders?
You know, I've never tried green ...
Do you have a mirror?
Crime scene?? It's not for me.
I'm just getting a better look.
Hey, David. I wasn't touching him.
Skechers. Adult size five. Female.
How's the prints coming?
Great.
You got to be kidding me. Officer Moron contaminated the scene.
What have you got?
Who's Tammy Felton?
Biological parents?
Cath, got another match from the convenience store. The print on the outside doorknob belongs to an ex-con, Darin Hanson.
You know this guy, too?
Greed. Fewer slices. Bigger pieces. 
But now he's dead. So, who killed him, and where's the money?
We've got more questions than answers.
What are we looking for?
He ducked before the chandelier fell.
I.D. the unknown, good chance we solve both cases: Laughlin and Vegas.
That's Dustin Bale. 
Whoa. Hold on. He was killed hours before the tower club heist. In on Laughlin, out on Vegas. So, Darin took him out first. They cleared the register just to make it look like a robbery.
Because he knew there were four at the Laughlin heist.
And we're back to who killed Darin Hanson.
I got chocolate.
Green ... You know what they say about the green ones.
Tell me they Scotchguard these things.
Yay. 
Tupac?
Yac? Cognac? No. Ho's? I'm not going there and, um, that's none of your business. It's nobody's business, as a matter of fact.
There was tetrahydrozoline in the victim's drink.
I got mine. You don't even like Tupac, Greg.
Well, it's not that far-fetched. Tetrahydrozoline is the active ingredient in eye drops. It's a vasoconstrictor. Obviously, it's great for bloodshot eyes.
It's a perfect poison. It's odorless, colorless, tasteless. Doyle would have never known it was in his drink.
You have been drinking too many Thug Passions. The woman is twice your age. She may be three times your age, Greg.
Well?
And that's all she was doing. The victim's drink contained point-zero-five  zinc sulfate. There was no zinc sulfate in any of Lita Gibbons' eyedrops. It's a different formulation.
No. But someone's eyedrops did.
What do you got?
Server's revenge.
A pissed-off waitress and a rounder with a bullet in him it could be a lethal combination.
Well, that can't be. Coarse basophillic stippling only occurs from massive infusions of lead.
Question is, why?
Already tested them. Negative.
No, I, uh, didn't know that.
Like acid rain.
Choco-bees.
I like his movies.  Some of them are good.
Later.
Hey. I thought you left.
Uh ... can it wait till after work?
Oh, um ... can you tell me where it was exactly?
You sure?
Thanks? Thanks nothing. I'm going to have to put it in my report.
Grissom said he found blood under movie boy's nailbeds.
They're actually exercising their right to a speedy trial?
Can't the DA drop the charges and we'll refile when we get our evidence together?
So who's their guy?
Phillip Gerard? Your mentor is their forensic scientist?
The waffle pattern -- I know, I'm trying to figure that out.
Vic didn't sustain any trauma that would've caused a medium velocity spatter.
I'll get all this to Greg but we are definitely going to need the DNA guy from days to pull all this together in time.
Yes, and the bedsheets.
To the letter. 
Our protocols stipulate we take overalls locator shots and close-ups. I took multiples of each.
Eight pair in the evidence room, in a sealed envelope.
He was just, uh, being polite and, um, it's not a relationship. We go to movies ...
I'll get the blood swatches to DNA identify any additional donors on the sheet.
What's, uh, going on?
Tom Haviland's.
There was another guy in that room. That's, that's great. The defense has us moving so fast we can't make sense of our own evidence.
Should we call the DA and let him know?
Motive. What are you talking about?
I've looked at everything in that hotel room. Nothing matches that pattern.
I told Brass that I needed them; he hasn't sent me anything yet. 
Thanks. 
Wish me luck.
I didn't want it anywhere. I collect evidence without emotion.
Excuse me?
I brushed chalk from his face.
Drywall dust. We were looking for a body.
Hey. NICK: Sara. 
I am so sorry.
On my own?
See you around.
Seventeen.
Hi, David.
Eviscerated.
It's a cheerleader.
She had to have good lungs. How come nobody heard her scream?
Died of exsanguination.
Hmm. You able to isolate the species?
Dog maybe? Teeth marks are too small for a mountain cat.
You're lying.
Can you tell how old the attacker is?
Thanks.
E-coli? Unsanitary conditions?
So whoever did this to her also has e-coli.
Smoking gun.
Soccer bunnies? What are soccer bunnies?
Sounds sexual.
Yeah, well, I'm not sure the principal's up to speed on teenagers' sexual habits.
He in class?
I bet I know why.
I understand, Mr. Darwell. Have your son's wisdom teeth come in yet?
Excuse me.
Hi, uh, Chuck, I'm with the crime lab. I'm going to ask you to show me your back teeth. Give us an odontological impression.
It's going to tell us everything we need to know.
Suspect's dinner from last night.
Can you read it for me? 
What's this look like, Greg?
Angel dust. Hallucinogen.
Brain disassociates from the body.
How many milligrams?
Yeah. Too bad everybody didn't make it.
Tell me this is raw chicken skin.
We need that report, ASAP.
Your temperature is spiking. Of course, you didn't know Mandy had e. coli when you ... ate her, did you?
Normal brain, neurons send a message ...
... synapses blink on and off. On PCP, synapses never stop firing like ...
... your entire brain is on constant DSL. 
Lieutenant Lockwood's going to arrest you. We'll assign you an advocate.
Not exactly. No match on the bite plate.
Someone getting sicker by the minute.
She have an explanation?
Nicole, do you know what e. coli is? Your friend Mandy was infected with it. We think we know how you got it. We can test your blood for PCP ...
These photographs are ... of Mandy's ribs. We believe these are your teeth marks.
It's called psychological detachment. It's a function of PCP.
Nicole, I was at Mandy's autopsy. It was not a dream.
Hey, Cyrus, next time somebody says experimenting with drugs is harmless remind me of this.
Good night.
I'm ... uh ... sorry I missed your page.
It's just, um ... you tell me to get a life and then I get one, and then you expect me to be there at a moment's notice. It's ... um ... confusing.
Is this some kind of convention?
Grissom, how do you know this?
Guy does a suicide in a public place. He was trying to make a statement.
It's a reasonable suspicion.
I got some fibers here. Possibly secondary. 
Killer's in the rope. 
So, would you mind if we tape-lifted your shirt? Combed your hair for evidence?
Well, the first person at a crime scene often turns out to be a viable suspect. 
Yeah. At, uh, random intervals.
I'm done. Thank you.
What's a pseudo? GRISSOM: Dwarfs with pseudoachondroplasia have features and head size like normal people. Dwarfs with achondroplasia have shortened limbs and enlarged heads. 
Different types of dwarfs, different social status? GRISSOM: Hey ... discrimination isn't just for tall people. 
Our concern isn't your height; it's your proximity. You're standing in a potential crime scene.
This is CSI Sidle. We need a uniform in room 312 right away. Thanks.
Yeah?
Gouge is deeper at the bottom than the top.
Grissom.
Did you and Mr. Ames have an argument, say last night?
We're going to have to take it with us.
Met you in a pseudo chat room. Do you remember me? I remember you.
...to the convention this year? I'd love to meet you. See if you can pick me out. Perfect face perfect body. Count of three, handsome.
Jessica, you knew Lawrence was having an on-line affair with another woman didn't you?
Danielle was different. She was his size. She was ... perfect.
Hey. Confronted the fiancée; she stonewalled us.
They look thin.
We're looking for anything in the picture that might give us a way to find her. Something in the background that determines location a useful reflection, anything.
What do you mean? ARCHIE JOHNSON: Individual hair shadows are amorphous when they should be distinct. 
This picture's a fake?
Excuse me?
Concept suggests ... Deep down we're all narcissists?
Scale to match the original picture with Danielle.
Danielle is a virtual woman created to attract and lure Lawrence Ames ... away from his fiancée, maybe?
The same woman that found him dead.
Well, that's interesting. That's the same time Danielle started sending him instant messages.
No, a bunch of the files were corrupted. Archie's taking another run at them.
And ties off the other end on the truss even though there is no way he could have reached it.
Nick, what are you doing?
They do okay. If the world doesn't adapt itself to you, you ...
Grissom?

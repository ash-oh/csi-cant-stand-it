Hey Jack, get over here. He's hurt bad.
That's enough! 
One! Two! Three! That's it!
Everybody knew they hated each other. They fought two times before. Title wasn't even on the line tonight. Just pride.
I didn't get to ref them, but I saw them ... $39.95 a pop. Goddamned Pay-Per-View's just like stealing, but they were good fights. Laroi won both of them. First one was a knockout in the eighth off this sweet right hook. The other was a ... a TKO in the tenth, yeah. Uh, he really dropped the hammer on Molina that time.
What do you mean?
All I noticed is that boy took one hell of a beating.
What's my cousin got to do with the fight?
Hey, he's always been a lucky guy.
Hey, big fight, money moves around.
So, what are you saying, that if I'd stopped the fight Laroi Steele would still be alive?  You charging me with something?
You know where to find me.

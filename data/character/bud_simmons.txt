Okay. Happy now?
Bud. Bud Simmons. But I'm no criminal, and I don't have to talk to you people.
Huh?
You think my costume killed rocky?
Rocky was... skritching me.
Skritching is like grooming. It's friendly scratching. People who don't know each other can't just nuzzle and trade tummy-rubs, but for animals, skritching is perfectly normal.
It started as a skritch, then everyone got in a furpile and pretty soon, we were all yiffing.
In a furpile, when all the animals start rubbing and wiggling, some of them start to do things.
That never happened before.
Okay. That happened before. I know what you're thinking.
I didn't kill Rocky Raccoon.
That's crazy. I was there for the yiffing, and that's all. Look, if I don't have my costume on, I pretty much can't get yiffed.

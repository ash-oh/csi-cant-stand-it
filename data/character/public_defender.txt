My client was in New Orleans three days before his wife's body was discovered on that mountain. He couldn't possibly have killed her. Unless I misunderstand what you've explained to us, Mr. Grissom -- your linear regression.
Quite simply. Scott has three prior complaints for abuse. What's to say the blood didn't get there during one of those altercations?
My client and I are leaving.
And, Mr. Grissom, thank you.

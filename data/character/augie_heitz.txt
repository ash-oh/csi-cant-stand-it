Grissom. A Mr. Grissom. Where would I find Mr. Grissom? 
Great, great. Thank you very much.
Mr. Grissom? Hi, I'm Augie Heitz. This is my listing. Someone died, I know. It's a terrible thing. But you got people knocking down awnings stomping through the flower beds. How am I supposed to sell this house?
What, you kidding? I mean, this is actually the beauty of the service I provide. My clients never have to see me. They don't even have to be home when I show their house.
It's a hot market. Um ... you know, I had a fish on the line. Potential bidding war. Look ...  I only give out the combination to people that I really trust.
Look, anyone could have lifted that Peter Croft. I thought this was about murder.
Excuse me.  I'm sorry, where were we? BRASS: The tape. It wasn't anybody's face on that tape, it was your face. 
I recorded their house for the virtual tour. That's what I do to sell houses.
What are you talking about? I have done nothing wrong.
I admit to having lust in my heart.
Well, my DNA is your DNA.
Look, for what it's worth I can tell you at least one guy other than her husband that saw Monica in the buff on a weekly basis.
Ah.

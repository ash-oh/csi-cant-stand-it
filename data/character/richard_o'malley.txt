Sure.
Wait a minute. You told me this morning he died in a car fire.
I gave it to him.
Because he asked me for it.
All right, look, it's got five rounds in it. There's no safety on it.
Yeah. Now look, if you think you're being followed, don't be a hero. Call the police.
Hey, look, I begged Donnie not to testify. He and Cody had everything to lose. They were doing great with their vending machines. No grandkids yet, but that's probably 'cause their marriage was shaky already. Cody has her mother's temper. She loved him, though. We all did.
My wife and daughter are pretty upset. I don't want you guys in here bothering them anymore.
So, you think this gang messed with Don's car while we were having dinner?
Cody, Mr. Brass wants to talk to you.
Right over there.
Yeah, a hobby of mine after I lost my job. Forced retirement. You know how it goes. Want to buy one?
Well, it's not like we have any neighbors.
Sure, Cody's taking stuff all the time. She'd rather spend her money on clothes. Kids.
What for?
Well, you're going to find mine all over.
How could I what?
No, I did this for you!
I would never let you get in that car!
How many Sundays did you come over and bitch to your mother about that selfish, ungrateful b*st*rd?!
You owed me!
I did you a favor!

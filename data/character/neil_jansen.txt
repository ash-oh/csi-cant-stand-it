Hey. Call me a geek, but background subtraction application software is the bomb.
Okay. Um, the technology's pretty new. You'll get hammered on cross, but it definitely works.  Okay, check it out. So the fingerprint is blood-red -- that's the shade we use for the color identifier -- and now the preprogrammed algorithm is just removing all the other colors from the fabric, and we're left with just the print. It's ...
Voyeur, huh? I like that.
Yeah. Right.
Scan this into I-AFIS, and here we go.
Got yourself a hit. Jesse Acheson. 38. Multiple convictions, cocaine possession, intent to sell. In and out of prison for the past ... seven years.
Out.
Released six months ago. Living in Henderson.
Ecklie keeps moving me around. Your pink college kids were both blotto.
You want a surprise? Check this out. Now, I know you and Greg tested the scene for carbon monoxide, but did you check for carbon dioxide?
It's a first for me, too. I found traces of blood in Trip's vomit. C02 levels are usually .03%. His levels were 8%. Lethal.
Still doesn't explain why they were pretty in pink. Carbon dioxide, unlike carbon monoxide, doesn't affect skin coloration.
Smells like my grandfather. Am I interrupting?
Lifted four clear prints from the party hat. They all came back to Preston Hayburn, from Henderson.
He's a paramedic. Would've had access to the morgue.
Oh, me, too.
I don't think I have any work pending for you.
Matchbook print. Everybody's talking about it.
Which makes fingerprints visible.
The n-terminus. 
It's the only part of the protein molecule that interacts with ninhydrin.
Upping the number of n-termini.
Or in rare cases, years -- depending on the rate of degradation.
Let's see ... plastic ... plastic traps in heat and humidity.
Bacteria would continue to break down over time.
I'd say you were processing a print in slow motion.

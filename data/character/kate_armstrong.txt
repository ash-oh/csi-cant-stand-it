I don't know what it was. I didn't care. I just wanted him off of me.
Once.
I said get off of me!
No. No. Vernon's a pig.
He's great at raising money. His donor list is huge. I didn't mean to kill him.  I just wanted him to leave me alone.

She's a friend on the faculty but she had nothing to do with this.
Julia Eastman. But she was doing me a favor. She was just at the wrong place at the wrong time.
Oh, my god.
Did Julia say anything?
Okay. 
I'm finished paying you. We're going to live openly, honestly.
That's a lie! JULIA EASTMAN: What?!
Julia and I would never have survived a rumor like that. We panicked. The school is our whole life.

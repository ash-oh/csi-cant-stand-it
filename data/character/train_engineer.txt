I'm putting 55 miles an hour. It's dark. I got an oil leak, can't figure out where. I looked up and I saw something.
Like I said, it was dark. I thought it was stopping. I turned my head for one second. Next thing I know, it's in the middle of the tracks. With all due respect we've got the right of way out here.

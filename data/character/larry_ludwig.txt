You sure you fellas don't want masks? The smell in here makes some people puke.
What, you gonna tell me my future or something?
I don't think so.
Hey, I was just getting back to work, Mr. Quinn. 
I told them I had nothing to say, sir.
They don't have warrant, Mr. Quinn. They're just... they're just fishing around, sir. Anybody who doesn't want to cooperate with the police in trying to find out who killed Brian â€“  -- can clean out their lockers and search for another job!
Yeah.
Hey, this is between us, right?
All right... I did see Brian last night. Me and my buddy, we started out at a bar, threw a few back, you know, met some ladies. And the hot one, she said, Let's go swimming.
Brian. What's shaking?
Yes, please.
So the girls, they wanted to play Tarzan. So I pull my pickup truck underneath the tree, I grabbed a rope out of my utility box, and we all started stripping down and everything ...
I mean, the guy had boobs, man. I mean, you could see 'em right through the t-shirt. 
I mean, we were all kind of cracking up about it, but ... um ... uh ... it kind of broke the party up a little bit.
Hey, man, I mean ... he ran off and we left. All right, I-I-I don't know what else I can tell you. I mean, you can ask Tony -- he works with me, too.
I went to the ... I went to a motel with one of, one of the girls.
Yeah, mine was ... uh ... she was named after some city in Texas. I don't know, like ... uh ... Dallas or Houston or something like that. The other one, she really wasn't that hot, so I don't know what her name was.

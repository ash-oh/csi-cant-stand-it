I'll need to check my calendar.
I saw baby girl at lunch 'bout an hour before we got on the bus.
Hey, that's my locker. I didn't take none of Baby's stuff.
Look ... I didn't hardly know baby girl. She only lived up in here eight days.
It was just a silver necklace.
What are you doing?
I could've told you that.
Skinny-ass feather worth as much trouble dead as she was alive? I didn't ask her to move in here.

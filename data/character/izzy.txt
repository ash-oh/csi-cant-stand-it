Hi. I'm Izzy Delancy. And back in my bad old days, I'd do almost anything to sell albums. 
People even accused me of biting the heads off live chickens on stage. I'm not proud of that. But I've worked hard to change. And with the help of the good Lord, fourteen years of therapy and two loving wives, I humbly believe I've made progress. But this story is not about Izzy Delancy. It's about something much, much bigger: cruelty. Did you know that every day in the United States, more chickens are killed than all the people in the Rwandan genocide? Now, you may argue, Izzy, African people are not a food source. Well, you're missing the point entirely. Cruelty is cruelty, whether the victim be a chicken or a malnourished African.

Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. My name is Pete Athens. I am the coroner of Clark County; I want to thank you all for being here. Coroner inquests go back to medieval times during the reign of Richard I in England. In fact, coroner comes from the word crown. A public inquest was one of the crown's checks and balances on the powers of the sheriff. And today, a thousand years later, it serves the same purpose in our countyâ€”checks and balances on the sheriff and for those who work for him. The Honorable Clayton Trueblood will be our hearing master. He's not a judge, but he's going to be more like a, um ... a traffic cop, because an inquest isn't a trial.

Tim Coleman. Newest boot. Two months in. Came right out of patrol. Best cop at Carson Station.
SWAT's LAPD. We're S-E-S. We're better. Better conditioned, better prepared.  Those the best you got?
Well, if they're not, I'll fly mine in.
Maybe you forgot. One of our own died out there in the dirt.
No.
Yeah.
Sure. On the job, we come across a scene like this, we call them a bunch of degenerates. We'd be rounding half these guys up. I am not going to miss this.
I just made lieutenant. I got nothing to prove anymore.
You know, I don't appreciate being kept in the dark this long.
If I'd known he was on drugs, he'd never have gotten into SES.
Hey, you got to keep up your strength. Don't make us look bad.
I want my union rep.
I said I want my union rep. We're done here.
Where's your kit?
Then what the hell are you doing here?
I wasn't trying to kill him.
Leg 16 was mine. I ran it eight years in a row. I won every time. Then the bosses transfer in that kid, kick me upstairs, and give him my race. No way I was going to let him do better than me.
Talk to me when it happens to you.

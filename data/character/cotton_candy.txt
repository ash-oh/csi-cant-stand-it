Come on, come on. Why you got to take the wig? Wig's part of my act.
Y'all are straight stealing from me right now! Hello!
Whoa, wh ... Hey, hey, hey! Look, look, look, look, look. Look, we didn't even have s*x, okay? It was all touchy feely. Jerky treats.
The guy I took into VIP right before panty auction. Look, man, all we did was touch.
Solicitation, right?
Margo? She's dead? And you think I killed her?
No, no, no. Look, man, I never seen dude in that picture. And Margo, yeah, I'll admit, I slapped the ho around last night, but I didn't kill her.
She's always hanging out with my fianc√©, okay? I couldn't take it anymore, so ... yeah.
Bitch!
Get off!
He works upstairs.
Look, honey, they don't call this the Over-Under for nothing, all right?
Jesse.
Are you serious? I didn't do anything.
Come on, man.
Back to the pole.
Look, man, the more I work, the more I can be with Jesse.
He doesn't care about them.
Those guys, they can't see past this, okay? I am more than a piece of meat to Jesse. Okay? He-he-he doesn't judge me. All right? He doesn't blow me off. He makes me smile, you know? He heals me, he heals me when I'm down. He makes me feel like I am Mrs. Steve Wynn.
Now we're going to get married, real soon.
I was in VIP with this pit boss, Joe Brodsky -- works at the Olympia. But he's married and he'll probably deny it. But I can prove it to you if you give me my wallet right now.
There it is. 
Right there. He paid me with those. Brand-new, straight from the bank.
You're a CSI. You can take a print off of there, easy ... duh.

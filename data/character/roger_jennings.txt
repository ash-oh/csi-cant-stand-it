Who the hell are you guys? Get out of my kitchen.
Hey, what is this?
Nope. Don't know what you're talking about. My little brother got me this job. I'm staying clean.
Ben wouldn't do that.
Ben did it.
He told me about it.
He's never been in any real trouble before. They'll go easy on him.
Grab that guy's tie, little bro. I like that thing.  Bury them deep, all right? You get into any trouble you don't have to say anything, all right? I'm counting on you, man.
Go, get out of here. Go on.

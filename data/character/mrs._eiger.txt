No. I've never seen that baby before in my life.
Do I look like I could raise a baby?
Seven years ago.
Do you know what my mother told me when I had Bruce?
Suckle the baby, cuckold the man.
You were breast-fed.
My mother was a firm believer that the way you raised a boy was to make him hard. To let him know what the world was like right out of the womb.
No free lunch. All these mothers coddling their toddlers. Look where we are.

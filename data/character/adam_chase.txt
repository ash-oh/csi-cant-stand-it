C'mon. C'mon. That's all
My mother was a powerful woman; she had a lot of enemies. My mother and Jill worked so hard to make this day perfect. It seems silly now. They had a fight about the gifts, then ... then there was a disagreement with the bridesmaids. And my mother accidentally brought the wrong dress. 
Then the dinner was wrong, and the cake was wrong. And my father showed up.
Um, no. My parents are divorced. I think that's why today was so hard on her. The wedding brought up a lot of issues for her. 
She sacrificed so much for me. Single parent, grad school. She was a champion.  My father is ... unstable. For years, he's had a drug problem.

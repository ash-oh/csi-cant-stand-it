Leg fell asleep.
I always wondered which one of us coroners would get to carve Tony.
His lifestyle was no secret -- s*x, drugs and a big bankroll. No needle marks on his arms. The guy plays golf; short-sleeved shirts checked between the toes ... groin area. Whatever he did went up his nose.
His nasal cavity looks like raw hamburger.
Or they're pressure marks. For example, if someone places a pillow or object against someone's nose and mouth in the climate of struggle.
Not always. For as much as pathology is an absolute science, it isn't. Vessels can rupture under innocent circumstances such as a violent cough.
No neurotoxins present but that's not to say some overanxious paramedic trying to save a legend's life didn't cause them in the moment.
Then I don't know what they are.
Braun's stomach contents. No food. Plenty of drugs.
And heroin.
Inhaled and ingested.
Got there somehow.
Didn't find any.
My guess, someone mashed up the Xanax, dissolved them in red wine, which I did find.
It wasn't a hundred pills.
Educated, unofficial guess: No more than fifty.
Get a speeding ticket?
Vincent Thomas Avery. I.D.'d him from his prints.
No mystery in cause of death. Gunshot wound to the outer ear.
Left ear at that.
Soot depiction on the skin surrounding the entry wound tells the story.
Bullet entered the external auditory meatus fracturing the skull base. Cracked the hardest bone of the skull.
Hot off the fluoroscope. Haven't had the pleasure yet.
There is your bullet. Deformed projectile in the right side of the calvarium.
You bet.
Something tells me, this isn't filled with white sugar.
I'd say about 50 balloons. Green dye you see here is probably from lime flavored gelatin. Makes them much easier to swallow.
Well, all indications are he was brain-dead from the time he collapsed at the hotel
An artery out-pouches blood floods the subarachnoid space.
Heart still beats, but the brain's dead. And it doesn't regenerate.
Genetic predisposition. Both parents went that way. It increases a person's chance of stroke ten-fold. He looks like an athlete.
I was wondering when you'd ask. Prime donor candidate. Next of kin signed off.
Eight in under two hours.
I deal with cause of death, which was an aneurysm and therefore, a natural, and based on that his body is released to a mortuary.
All may not be lost. Here... body of Robert Fairmont released at 0400 hours to the Desert Haven Mortuary.
Embalming certainly retards the decomposition process.
The liver's degraded but any metal should still be there.
Who'd you like to start with?
Identical body temps and vitreous humor. Both women died approximately 12 hours ago.
All I can tell you is cause of death. Injury to the cervical spine. Looks to be hands-on.
She died instantly. Now, the blond.
Contusion to the forehead, not fatal. Whatever cut her face cut her arm. I found glass in all the incised wounds. Except for these abrasions on her neck.
I swabbed the abrasions for foreign DNA sent it to the lab. 
Severed brachial artery. She bled out.
Sure.
A wildflower and a wallflower.
There's the initial bullet hole. No other leaks. Died from a single gunshot wound to the chest just like the others.
Not likely due to the origin of the facial burn.
True.
The finger was severed postmortem. No hemorrhagic tissue at the point of injury. And they used a serrated blade. Jagged teeth patterns on the bone. Not much else I can tell you. It's just a finger.
Amanda Freeman. 
My guess is, she's been in the water about 24 hours. 
Washerwoman effect. But no saponification.
Mm-hmm.
I found some in her nose and trachea, too. The decomposing body would need time to attract the bugs before submersion. Well, she's been dead 48 hours 24 hours above water, 24 hours under.
Blunt-force trauma. Back of the head.
Look at this.
You'll have to get it under the microscope. My guess is some form of stone. Granite maybe.
Well ... the entry wound tells me the body sustained a projectile.
Uh, but there's no bullet fragments in the tissue and no exit wound.
Bullet wounds usually leave bullet evidence.
There's no evidence of a bullet in this wound tract.
That was my next suggestion.
Something. A metal fragment. It's not like any bullet I've ever seen.
Titanium ... maybe a pin.
Oh, here's the manufacturer's number. I should've bought stock when I first started finding all these medical implants.
Excuse me?
Foreign tissue. Cow. Makes absolutely no sense.
This more of your cross contamination?
On the day you plan to expend a meat bullet? Ahh ... a frozen meat bullet?
Well, I'm ready to watch history.
Bullet-like entry wound. 
The meat disintegrates. Lost in the soft tissue. Hmm.
What took you so long?
Tox screen came up empty except for quinine. Must have had malaria in the past six months. Either that or he's a big gin and tonic drinker. I've ordered up his medical records. If I was this guy I'd have been popping pain pills. Hairline fracture of the ulna bruised kidney, ten stitches off the orbital bone fractured nasal bone, all recent. Healed rib fractures. 
He should have worn a cage. 
I bet he was proud of every last battle scar. What is it about organized sports?
So, uh, what did this guy do in real life?
Competition junkie.
Not me, not anymore.
Foibles of youth.
Not sure.  This cut nicked his carotid. Double-edged, clean blade, hockey skate, uh ... 
Fun continues. Basilar artery also suffered significant trauma. Evidence of blood in the intimal space. Possibly enough to cause syncope.
Well, it could explain why the vic ended up in the bottom of that pile.
W.P.W.: Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Interferes with the heart's electrical system.
Well, it didn't show during the post, but I looked at the tissue sections in histopath. 
They showed a small defect in the atrium of the heart. 
Not necessarily. You know the quinine I found in his system? Lethal for someone with W.P.W. Big scars didn't do him in. It was the little scar.
All were shot in the third eye, the sixth chakra, vortex of consciousness. I was a gray's anatomy man, until I lost my legs. I started getting phantom pains no drug or exercise could control. I began studying the chakras.
Each has a color and a vibration. 
Muladhara, the root chakra, keeps us in the physical world. Svadisthana, seat of sexual energy. Manipura, melting pot of spiritual and earthly desires. Anahata, the loving heart. Visuddha, where feelings are given expression. Ajna, the third eye. Saharsrara, the crown connecting the mortal human to the timeless universe.
Ajna, the hub of higher consciousness.
Hmm, there's a very good chance your killer's a Buddhist.
Not a drop of ethanol in his system not even from cough syrup.
My guess, hungry. Driver's medical eval taken just last month. Martin Draper, 40.  Overweight. One of 15 million people in this country suffering from Type II Diabetes.
Primary course of treatment would have been exercise and weight loss to lower blood sugar.
But he was dieting.
Crash dieting. Didn't find any food in his stomach. Means he hadn't eaten anything in at least six hours. An empty stomach invites hypoglycemia.
And in extreme cases?
Cum Laude.
Just what you'd expect. Massive injuries, internal bleeding.
We know two things for certain. Jane Galloway died from a lack of O2 and she is a natural blond.
It certainly looks that way.
Uh, petechial hemorrhaging in the eyes, deoxygenation led to cyanosis, hence the blue lips ...
... blue fingertips ...
... and blue face.
If she had struggled with her assailant that effort alone could have limited her oxygen intake causing further O2 depletion of the brain ...
Easy kill.
No physical findings. You'll have to check the kit.
I've seen things like this before. When I worked in Arlington, Virginia, every winter homeless trying to stay warm take a nap in a dumpster wake up in a garbage compactor. Mulch.
No, she was crushed post-mortem.
Tissue in the extremities was yellow and dry. Means blood wasn't pumping through her veins when she went through that compactor.
Massive internal bleeding. Her spleen ruptured.
Blunt-force trauma.
Rib cage. Ribs weren't crushed.
They sustained a single blow.
I-I have no idea. I'm still trying to straighten her out. Truth? I may never know.
Glad I'm a dog person.
You're right. No vital reactions around the bite marks. Predation is all postmortem. Cause of death: cardiac trauma. She was stabbed lateral to the sternal border, just below the fifth intercostal space 
... Straight into the right ventricle. Muscle layers decrease with age. Fascia and tissue layers are easy to penetrate. Can't tell you much about the weapon but the wound track is slick. 
I swabbed the foreign substance sent it to Greg.
Well, vic's lungs were full of fluid. Probably not relevant to your investigation, but the lab cultured her blood. She had a severe staph infection.
You found this guy in the park?
Well, that explains the postmortem scar tissue. Lye had a field day on his flesh.
Approximately 24 hours ago. Tell me about the car.
Comminuted fractures of the proximal tib-fib. Both legs. Bumper hits right below the knees. Sure sign he was hit by a car.
Which suggests he survived the impact. Usual injuries. Ruptured patellar tendon, laceration of the saphenous vein and multiple incised wounds containing slivers of glass ... 
... which I will send over to trace and bruise legs, arms and chest. What I didn't find was arterial lacerations or underlying vessel damage.
Correct. Victim was like a leaky water balloon. Heart slowly pumped blood right out of his body and based on the coloration of the bruises, trauma was sustained approximately 48 hours before death. Three days ago, this man was injured. He bled out until he died yesterday.
This is Ecklie's Mercedes?
Top of the head, face, top of shoulders and forearms. 
The victim bled out for two days.
Then the hypovolemic shock would have set in after approximately 12 hours.
Sometimes I'm glad I only deal with dead people.
Looks execution-style. At least one shot to the back of the head. A lot of bruising around these handcuffs.
Well, it's no longer trunk man. Identified him from his dental records. Jason Doyle. Dead for three days; no GSR.
We only recovered one slug from his cranium.
And I got this fragment from his lower back.
Vascular embolization. Bullet got into his arterial system.
Well, it took a full-body x-ray for me to find the thing. Bullet entered here ... 
... fragmenting at the neck and losing velocity upon penetration 
... of the carotid artery. Tube down the aorta, continually losing momentum. 
As it exited the aorta, it struck the vertebral column and then was swept down to the base of the aorta ...
... where I recovered it here at the lumbar region.
Looks like nines, like we found in the Chief.
Yeah.
Tuberculosis victims emit breath that smells like wet leaves.
I'm not sure. 
How about Darier disease? 
There's diabetic ketoacidosis. Body has excess glucose which converts to ketone ... Gets expelled through the pores. Has a fruity smell. It would help if we had a piece of the assailant's clothing.
What?
No visible track marks. Tox screen came up empty except for botulin.
I'll know more when I cut open her stomach. Heard about the rat. Hope he didn't have any children. Take a look at these tiny puncture wounds in her forehead. Indicates repeated injections. You sure she's homeless?
Educated guess: Beautification. She was injected with pig botulism. 
Botox ... the ultimate wrinkle cream.
Bad doctor. Missed the muscle. Shot directly into her supratrochlear vein.
People are still animals. Signs of possible torture. A lot of scarring. Some old, some new.
The dove-tail abrasion of the margins was caused by the scraping of the handle of some weapon. Tells me the blade was completely inserted -- more than once.
Give me a few hours; I'll know more.
I found blisters in the back of her throat.
That's what I thought until I noticed worn enamel on the tooth.  Which made me realize it wasn't sexual abuse.
She was bulimic and anorexic. Which explains the down on her skin.  Lanugo. Characteristic of premature babies and anorexics.
Not this week. Last week, or the week before, who knows? Binge-and-purge.
You know what's next.
Uh, starvation and purging weaken the immune system. But cause of death: Failed kidney, fueled by septicemia.
Probably, but she's been septic for at least a month. She has anemia borne of chronic disease. Her red cell count's low, iron's low. ESR is extremely high.
Quick. Name three human bones that can stand a twelve story drop.
They appear to be the only bones not fractured or broken.
Gil, he wasn't shot. This is the guy that fell of the new jailhouse. Are we talking about the same case here?
News to me. I didn't find any physical evidence of electrocution.
Negative on the burn marks. In most electrocution cases, capillaries rupture, hemoglobin leaks into the perivascular tissue.
His body contradicts your crime scene.
Mrs. Buckley, do you have someone to drive you home?  Mrs. Buckley?
Do you have someone to drive you home?
My youngest just turned 14. Tough age.
Cranial-cerebral injuries. Comminuted fractures of the occipital bone.
First blush? Yes. Waiting on toxicology. In the meantime, check out his torso.
Possibly.
You, too, huh? His body's covered in them.
Well, maybe it was as simple as he wasn't wearing his shirt and pants.
Exactly what kind of therapy was this?
No can do. Released six hours ago.
Another 24, but there's nothing in there to support Valenti was electrocuted.
You want to look at my notes?
His troponin enzymes are elevated.
Sure, but troponin's found in all victims of cardiac arrest, most of whom have not been zapped.
Uh, vic also had an elevated concentration of iron in his blood -- six, seven times normal.
No.
Well, it fits the bill of mundane. His skin looked jaundiced.
Dead or alive, your vic's epidermis is yellow.
What? ... Okay, I'm working with you. Uh, I don't remember. I mean, genetics can be fascinating -- and there are things I take note of -- but I didn't focus on his genitals.
You're welcome.
Barry Schickel from the high school. Dug three of these .44's from his back. 
First one cracked his infraspinous fossa.
Second one entered ... past the interior angle of the scapula punctured a lung.
And the last one entered just right of the right anterior sarratus muscle ... pierced the heart.
This is a special case. 
See the scar? This guy was attacked before ... I'd say in the last six months.
Whatever it was, it would've killed him. If his heart had been there.
Barry's upper body? All his internal organs are on the opposite side of typical placement.
Which was good for this guy, until his luck ran out.
Six months, hand-to-hand combat. Sounds like something your suspect would do?
Jacques Cousteau. Kidding. Coroner's humor. But I'll tell you what I do know. He didn't die in that fire. No carboxyhemoglobin in his blood. 
Tells us he stopped breathing before the fire started. Guy was probably killed someplace else and dumped.
Victim's injuries are inconsistent with a fall of that magnitude. No fracture of the pelvis no compression of the lumbar vertebrae no shortening of the body.
His heart stopped beating. 
The human heart beats in a four-beat rhythm like a fox-trot. The two atria contract, then the two ventricles. Ba-boom, ba-boom.
Commotio cordis. Cardiac concussion. The guy short-circuited. It's rare, but I've seen it. Couple of years ago a minor leaguer took a line drive to the chest. 
Interrupted the impulse to the heart turning it into a bag of worms. Fibrillation.
Definitely. 
... Lake Mead. Sorry, Nick. But I did find something between him and his wetsuit. Soap residue. Like he started to shower. Soaped up never soaped off.
Oliver Dunne. Corporate lawyer. Father of two.
His wife-- widow. She came down to I.D. His property.
Last one I recovered entered through his abdominals ... 
... pierced the liver, lodged in the oblique.
You might be right. He died of asphyxiation. Tie probably closed the windpipe. 
Without oxygen, the alveoli capillaries wither and dry up. Whole pulmonary system shut down. What you may have here is the smallest sliver of the murder weapon.
I'll take it from here, David.
Catherine.
No serosanguineous fluid expunged from the mouth or nose.
Rules out your jacuzzi theory.
Bright red lividity extending down the body.
Well, heatstroke possibly. Stroke could cause multiple organ failure and if I'm right ... 
Hey, I still have to do the post. Catherine?
As finished as I'm going to be. You were right. Cyanosis. Blood was unable to oxygenate her tissue.
With blood in her lungs, asphyxiation's out. I found vomit in her throat, bloody stool, hemolysis and some irritation of the mucous membrane on her tongue. I won't know more till I get the blood test back. Could be blood-borne disease.
Then you know more than I do.
Fifteen minutes before my next post. Bottled chemicals from the library?
Hey. Great room. Great table. I could use this. Lay out all the body parts. Get a real overview. Is that a light under there?
Oh, your vic. Poisoned. Substance as yet unidentified.
When you isolate the toxin you'll have a better idea where it came from. Nick ... 
I love this table.
Well, ricin. I never would have gone there but it explains the irritation of the mucous membrane on her tongue.
I don't know about ate but the ricin made contact with the tongue which means you're probably looking for a powder.
She died two to four hours before she was discovered. Jury's still out on cause of death but considering the whip and ligature marks it's no stretch to say it was violent. Some of the scars on her back are years old. Some are fresh.
That's the strange part. Her body's a road map of abuse but there's no sign it was sexual. She hasn't had intercourse in months.
Left or right?
Mona Taylor didn't die from the beatings but cause of death was equally as slow: Asphyxia. You look like you expected it.
Well, there's something else. She had some odd scaring in the inside of her nose. Some small red circle. 
She worked in a s*x club, it could be caused by anything.
Maybe I lack imagination but why would you need a straw at a s*x club?
There's a difference?
Cocaine?
I like to think so. So this is our cross-dresser in thee ? I.D.'d as Adam Brower, shot in the back with a hollow point -- close range. Mushroomed upon impact maximizing trauma.
Forty-five. 
Someone didn't want to share.
Contusions on the anterior neck. Streaking erythema on the lateral aspect of zone one. Cartilaginous tracheal rings are crushed.
Catherine.
How'd you know?
Put his thumbs around her air pipe and pushed.
I swabbed her neck. Affirmative for epithelials.
Parents called. They're on their way in to I.D.
Oddly, relieved.
You know why Steve Wynn hired Bobby Baldwin to run The Nugget, then The Mirage, The Bellagio? He was a great poker player, Great Thinker.
Stop the world. No violaceous lividity prominent above the level of the shoulders.
Not ruling out stroke, but check out the mees lines in his fingernails. 
Milky, vomit-like fluid in the corners of his mouth ...
... single blue line running across his gums ... 
... all the earmarks of lead poisoning.
What's that look like to you?
It's probably been there quite a while leeching lead into his system.
I'll know better when I get the tox screen back and examine the brain.
Hey, Catherine. Nice timing. I just finished my prelim on your John Doe.
Cause of death: Perforating gunshot wound through and through. Wound penetrated the zygomatic arch exited the right temple. 
Check out his right eardrum.
Presence of blood indicates the tympanic membrane was blown out shortly before death.
Jet engine? Well, that would explain his clothing. A gasoline smell. Sent if off to trace. Here's something you don't see every day, though: Perimortem bruising on his torso. Two symmetrical lines.
Maybe. 
Yup. Turbo.
Nope.
Want to step back a little?
You ever held a legend's brain? 
Correct spelling: U-N-C-A-L. Uncal herniation-- a swelling at the base of the temporal lobe which compresses the posterior cerebral artery resulting in a stroke.
Tox is pending.
Wild card was blood pressure. If he kept that under control he might have had another twenty years.
Yup.
Wound tract tells us the weapon was sharp, irregular with a tight curve.
Corkscrew would be consistent with this tissue damage.
Transected the superior thyroid artery external carotid, causing exsanguination. Both laryngeal branches of the vagus nerve and her larynx were severed. Vagus nerve controls the muscles in the larynx. Any injury to this nerve and its surrounding muscle results in immediate paralysis of the throat.
Voice box was immobilized. 
Why the look?
No surprise here. He drowned.
Lack of bruising, no bleeding wounds. Indicates his circulatory system had stopped. This was postmortem.
Uh, don't know. Not a rash. Some kind of abrasion. Maybe even a friction burn. Definitely peri-mortem. X-rays reveal several broken ribs and he's got a bruise on his forehead. He could have taken a bad fall.
Maybe.
No physical findings for sexual assault though I did send a kit to DNA. Looks like cause of death was a single gunshot to the head. I'll know more later.
Yes, I do. Depth of bruising gives us a timeline. Apparent thumbprint on her neck came first the, uh, prints on her hands second. Major impression on top. It's some kind of recoil bruise on her palm.
... and linked to an external screw. Turn the screw, it cracks the bones. Osteogenic cells flood in.
Callus forms to bridge the gap. The fractures heal and the bone gets longer. You have to break the bones every four to six hours a quarter millimeter at a time. Excruciating pain ... for an extra few inches.
What fools these mortals be.
So ... 
At least. C.O.D. was asphyxiation due to strangulation. Give me a hand here. 
Bruise behind the ear is characteristic of a hanging.
This bruise is not.
Take a look at this. 
Separation of the first and second vertebrae prior to death.
That's something that would only happen to a dwarf with pseudoachondroplasia. Physiology can make for cervical spine instability.
Hmmm ...

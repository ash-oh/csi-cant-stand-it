Miss, my daughter has to go to the bathroom.
Thank you.
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.
Come on. It's been a rough night.
I'll be right back, sweetie, okay? 
Okay.

I've been practicing for eleven years.
Emily. She wanted to see the white tigers.
I caught it during the ruckus. The price you pay for being a Good Samaritan.
Hey, stop it! 
Oh...
Get out of the way. Get out of the way! Give him some air. Sir?

If he had been in my E.R., I might have been able to save him, but at thirty thousand feet, there's only so much you can do. Look ... I did what I could.

I protected my daughter and I tried to save a guy's life. And, yes, I'm satisfied with that.
I don't need a deal.
Get out of the way! Get out of the way!

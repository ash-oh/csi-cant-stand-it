: You have a beautiful family.
He did. In Barstow at the rest stop. It was supposed to be a girls' weekend.
No! This is my weekend. If this is going to work, I need my space.
Then go back home.
I saw him pull out. Drive off.
I wish I hadn't yelled at him.
What are you talking about?
Oh, god.  It's because he was a doctor. He saw it every day. People hooked up to machines waiting to die. He swore he wouldn't let anyone he loved go through that. And if his life was at stake, he wanted to make the hard decision so no one else would have to.

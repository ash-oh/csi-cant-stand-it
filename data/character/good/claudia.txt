My husband's dead. We had our problems but I loved him I don't ... I don't much care what you do now.
We have never represented we didn't know each other previously.
Well, we did live in grazing country although, I have to say, Julia knew more about livestock than I did. She rode horses.
Oh, I hated the stables. The smell. Never stepped foot in them.
I'm, uh ... I'm coming into a lot of money.
Pardon me.

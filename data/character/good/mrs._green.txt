I need to know what happened to my daughter.
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
She had just been certified.
No, not that I recall. No.
No, she had just moved in with her boyfriend, Jason Hendler. He still lives on Medley Place.
A couple of times. He had nothing to do with this.
He loved my daughter. He was good to her.
The first few months of a relationship nobody fights. 
She was crazy about him.

Don't you have enough cases over at CSI now you're going to start telling me which ones I should take to court?
As a matter of fact that is why I was hunting you. Jennings brought it in about an hour ago. Chain of custody; I can't touch it. The first victim was ligatured, right?
Jennings says his little brother asked him to hide the tie.
A jury doesn't understand epi-whatevers, okay? They understand a twisty tie and blood all over Ben's car seat.
Oh, come on, Grissom, they're both part of it and if I can get one of them, I will.
Yeah? Then his epithelials shouldn't be on that tie. You'd better check with your lab.

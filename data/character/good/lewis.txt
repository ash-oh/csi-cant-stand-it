Look, you got squat. Jerry and Bruce signed with different pens. You found a cigarette butt at Lake Mead and wood chips on a tree-hugger. Bottom line, you got a dead guy up a tree and you don't know how he got there.
For what? What have you got?
Still doesn't explain how Bruce's body wound up in that tree.

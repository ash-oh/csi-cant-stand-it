So you really pulled this out of a corpse?
Well, it's not a knife. The tip's double-edged. Bevels on both sides, downward slope. This came from a dagger which means it's either carbon steel or stainless steel. I get asked this question more than you think.
How's a cop know all this?
Dark spots.
Length.
Daggers are rarely more than an inch at the base. We got the tip. So, we can fill in the rest. It's basic geometry.
It's five inches. Top row-- five-inch daggers, carbon steel. 
This is the one you want. $24.99. We don't take credit cards.

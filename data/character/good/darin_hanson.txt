I haven't seen Joseph Felton since the trial two years ago.
Yeah. Guy put me in jail. I had no reason to see him again.
Mm-hmm. Knew the guy fifteen years. My folks lived across the street from him. We'd barbecue together with his wife and daughter.
Joe was the lance guy. He taught me how to break into safes. That's why the M.O.'S the same.
I was in Barstow all week. Just got back this afternoon. 
Okay ... here you go ... receipts from the trip. Go ahead.
Am I late?
Owe you? I'm the one that told you the truth about your father.
Where to?
Not in the least.
Take it easy, pal.
It'll hold you over ... till tomorrow.

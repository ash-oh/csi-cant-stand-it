Hey! What the hell are you doing? That's Warrick Brown from ID. Put those guns away.
All right, you caught him. Congratulations. Clear out of here before you wake the neighbors.
Brown, what the hell are you doing?
You got a winner for me? 
I'll make it worth your while, you give me a name.
Oh, I knew it. Listen, kid, I'll make a deal with you. You put
You got a winner for me?
You put $5,000 down on the Pack for me I'll give you a blank warrant.
Warrick, Judge Cohen. You bet the wrong team, you idiot. 
I said Packers. I got the 49ers for five grand. The spot in fifteen minutes.
What are you, dyslexic? You owe me ten grand, buddy.
So what are you breathing here for? Get out there and get my money.
Hey, you came to me.
You got an hour.
You don't leave until I tell you to leave.
You're already in contempt with me. We're in bed, pal. I own you.
Yeah? Let me tell you something. You ever heard of a wolf in sheep's clothing? You and me -- we're going to do business together whether you like it or not. Keep your cell phone charged.
Called for a continuance.
Nobody was supposed to tell you.
You're going to do something for me.
You do what I ask, slate's clean. Henderson rape case. State's evidence.
Judges aren't appointed on a whim. I owed the family. I need you to compromise the chain of custody.
I have to have this case kicked.
Give them an excuse. You're good at that. You worked the graveyard. You pulled a double and you're tired. It could happen to anybody. Don't worry. I've got your back.
This better be good.
It's a two-way street, pal. Did you do what I asked?
What's the big deal? You break the seal on the evidence box it's over. We put it to bed, I tell Henderson mission accomplished.
What's going on here?

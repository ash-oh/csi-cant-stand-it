No, he, he, he kept kicking the back of my seat with his foot. You know, like in a movie theater when somebody's kicking your seat? Imagine that all the way from Atlanta to Las Vegas.
Maybe not the entire flight. You know, like, like Dallas to, to Las Vegas.
Hey, Pele, could you please stop kicking the back of my seat?
You know exactly what you're doing. Stop it.

So I took some of my runner money and I hit the blackjack tables. I lost ... so I doubled up. I ended up losing thirty grand in eight minutes.
I was scared. You know, it wasn't my money.
I should have. But, no ... I only worried about my butt. They killed Joey to send a message to me. Mom, I'm sorry. I didn't know.
One of the runners. Probably a guy ...
One of them killed Joey. You know, they'll do anything for money. It's like a-a disease.
Joey died because of me. Either they find his shooter, or I do.

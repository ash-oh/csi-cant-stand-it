You must be Sara. 
The CSI who called me?
I'm Tom. Uh ... Pam's husband. Thanks, uh, for all you've done.
Thanks.
Okay, uh ... good. The doctor says Pammie's condition is stabilized. He was in an hour ago. He expects her to live.  Says she's not going to die.
Well, we're moving her to Haven View Center later this week. Do-do you know that facility?
Yeah. That's what the doctor said.
Well, um, uh ... come see us sometime.
Good luck to you.

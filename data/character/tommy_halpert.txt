Wait, what is he being arrested for?
Who got murdered?
Um, I'm not allowed back there. I just pick up the poop and walk the dogs.
That's not true. I was here when he picked Hannibal up.
Like 47 right now. 
Most of these guys are pretty jacked up.
Yeah, most of them have. 
You can go ahead. He's not gonna bother you.
Yeah, you try to make a difference. I spent some time in a cage, so I know what it's like.
Yeah, you're a good boy. You're a good boy.
It's okay, boy. It's okay.
Oh, yeah.
I did the best that I could.
And I told you what they were doing to those dogs and I gave you all the tapes.
But they had the fights in different places. I mean, she never told me where they were, s-so ...
You know, I've been on the streets ... in juvie. I've seen people do some bad things to each other, but those dogs, like ... you can beat their brains in and, like, a minute later they come up to you just wagging their tails.
No, I never had a pet. My mom was allergic.
Do you know how they train them?
She was fighting dogs. All right, she was ... she was killing dogs in the ring for money week after week. And the city decides to give her an award? I gave her what she really deserved.
At least I had the decency to euthanize her before I threw her to the dogs.

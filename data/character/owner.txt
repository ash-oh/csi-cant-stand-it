It's a kitchen. The chefs use knives. That's not uncommon. You are...?
One of my waitresses.
No, that's the strange thing. He... he never did.
This guy's a punk.
This guy's no good. He's been in here before, and every time it's trouble, so this time, I exercised my right not to serve him. You know what the little freak does? Lifts up his jacket, and shows me a piece. I tell him to take a hike.
Then he proceeds to tell me how I better watch my back, 'cause it wouldn't be the first time tonight he killed somebody.
No, it's Gene Jaycobs.
Hey, look. Some kid dropped dead. It's a shame. Kids O.D. all the time in nightclubs. They're big boys and girls. This ain't church.
You understand. You know the kind of rent I pay on a joint like this? Rain or shine, I owe the landlord fifty thou .
You don't get it.

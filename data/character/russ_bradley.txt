Hi.
Maybe as many times as I've asked you to have the kids ready and out front on my nights?
What's going on? Are the kids all right? Is Jake in some kind of trouble?
Are you serious?
My hands? Why?
Sure.  Look, uh, I don't want to be rude, but ... I stop paying alimony the day Mike and Jane get married. I mean, I'm the last person who would have killed him.
You can reach me at any of my four grocery stores. Any time.
I'm going to get the kids, if that's all right.
You're telling me this b*st*rd took pictures of my daughter?
I never liked the way he looked at Jody. I've never liked it.
Touchy-feely. 
It wasn't normal. I told Jane when she started seeing him he's not a good guy. He's not good for our family. But you can't control who your ex-wife dates.
Yes.
Please.
Of course. You never, never store a dirty firearm.
A .38 special. It takes .38s. 
Whatever's on sale.
A father knows. I mean, he was giving her gifts, you know, cameras.
And the wedding was, like, a week off and he was going to be living under the same roof as my children full-time. When I went over there you know, I was just going to set him straight, right? You know what he says?
You touch my little girl and I will kill you.
That's when I lost it.
I'll tell you the truth. I ... I feel relieved. I'd like to make a formal confession.
Okay.
Brad, make me a deal.
What do you mean you can't? You got me four years for murder.
You can get me something.

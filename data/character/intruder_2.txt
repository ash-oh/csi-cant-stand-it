I'm telling you, this bitch is loaded and no one's seen her for weeks.
What the hell.
No, man. I swear. Somebody must have beat us to it.
What the hell is this?
She was supposed to be, like, this old widow, right? Like, always going out to dinner and coming home with shopping bags. Bitch had insurance money and word was that she kept it in a box hidden under her bed.
Listen, man, we didn't kill her.
No. There was nothing left to touch, man.

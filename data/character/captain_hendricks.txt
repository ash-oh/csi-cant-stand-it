Yeah, at 6:58 P.M. We were on scene in about four minutes. Three smoke bombs on three different floors, three pains in my ass. There's no major damage, just paint and wallpaper. We were there about a half hour.
They didn't find much. Uh, the smoke bombs were made out of soda cans.  Kids, Internet, you do the math. It's all in your lab.
A couple guys from the day shift were gonna compare 'em to those bombs we found a couple of weeks ago.
Apartment building over on Paradise. Smoke bombs started a fire, one woman died. We still don't have a suspect in that.

Smoke bombs. We caught this creep sneaking away. My guys tried to stop him.
You should see what he did?

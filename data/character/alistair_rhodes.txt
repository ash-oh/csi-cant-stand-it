Most people around here just call me Reverend.
The man you're looking for no longer exists. If you'll excuse me, I have some chores to do.
Plenty of times--with hookers, addicts, drug dealers, pimps, wife beaters, runaways. I save people.
There's nothing I can tell you.
I don't answer to you. I want to talk to my lawyer.
My partner ... is the Lord.
... bang you with chains of iron! Come from her now!
Back, pandemonium! Back, confusion! Leave ... this ...
... girl!
Now, spirit!
This is your fault. You didn't believe. You didn't believe.
Come from her now!
Back, pandemonium! Back, confusion! Leave ... this ... girl ... now!
Amy's not here.
It's your fault. You didn't believe. You didn't believe.
I've helped other people cast out the Devil before.
L-listen to me. Listen to me. The mother came to me ... at her wit's end, heart in her hand, begging me, begging me to free her child. She said she'd tried doctors and pills, but nothing worked, so I went to the house, I saw it with my own eyes.
The thing in that house ... it wasn't Amy. It wasn't human. I had to cast it out.
No. Amy's father broke the rules: never speak to it, never interrupt, and believe me completely, do only as I say.
Mr. Grissom, do you believe in a separate, living evil?
The Devil's slyest trick is making us believe he isn't real. But call his name loud and long enough ...  ... guess who comes knocking on your door?
I told you the truth. You have to let me leave.
I cast you out! 
I saved her. I saved her.

Hey, Len.
Thanks.
Thanks.
It's ugly out there.
This is not good. The hospital doesn't need this.
Joanne was coming off shift, I was coming on. Doing bed checks, I found Robbie on the floor. Kenny was in the corner covered in blood.
He's been taken to seclusion.
Leon, let's get a couple more milligrams of lorazepam into him.
Shh ... 
Yes.

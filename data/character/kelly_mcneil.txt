Kelly McNeil. Deb and I are best friends. We were supposed to get together yesterday. It was our day off.
Yeah. Both of us. Desert Palm Hospital. We made lunch plans, but she canceled.
Michael.
Michael Clark. Um, she's been seeing him for a month or so. He's a surgical intern. When she didn't show up for work today, I called the house ... her cell ... no answer, so I drove by after shift.
We have each other's keys.
No. I walked in and ... I saw her and I ran out.
He was the first guy that Debbie ever blew me off for.
No. I figured they were both playing hooky.

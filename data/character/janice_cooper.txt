It's late. I was worried.
Love you.
I see that. Good morning, honey.
Yeah, well, the jury's still out on that as far you're concerned. You must have had quite a night.
That Joey's a dog. If you don't watch out, he's going to get you into trouble.
Yeah, pretty talk, talk, talk.
Mm, it's delicious. Very good.
I'm glad you shaved. I barely recognized you under all that scruff.  
What are you doing?
Not even ready for dinner.
Well, you're not wearing that to the Eiffel Tower.
Hurry up. My mom's waiting for Maddy. I don't want to lose that table.
Okay. Well, now, who's that beautiful girl, huh?
You going somewhere?
The fake ID cards?! The staying out all night, and then this mysterious ATV ride in the desert.
Yeah, at three o'clock in the morning?
Uh-uh. You're planning a job.
You're a liar, Karl. You're lying!
And what's that supposed to mean?
You even think about Maddy? Your daughter? You promised ... on her life, you promised!  No more robberies!
Now you just kill people.
Oh, Karl. All the waiting. All the maneuvering, the lying. I did it. And I did it for us, for this family. I kept money in our wallets. I invested it, so all you had to do was watch football on TV.
And you jeopardized everything we have for some scumbag that nobody gives a damn about.
Oh, God, he had it coming. And you were careful, right? So what's with the fake IDs? Karl? You don't make mistakes.
The ... the girl on the tv? Oh, Karl! Oh, God, she was just a kid!
I want you to go up the stairs. I want you to kiss Maddy. I want you to tell her that you love her ... and I want you to get out of this house.
Maddy ... sweetie, come with me, okay?
Yeah.
He's not here.
You guys never do. Look around all you like.
Like I said, he's not here.
Maddy, you be nice, baby, okay?
Go to hell.
I've had cops in my face for half my life. You don't scare me.
Hello?
Yes.
Yes.
I think they're tracing this call.

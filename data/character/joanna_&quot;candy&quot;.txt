You like trouble, you ... 
Hey! Give me my purse! Give me my purse!
Help! Somebody!
All my stuff. I'm just cleaning out my locker.
Thanks.
Hey!
You're a cop, right?
I'm Candy.
Yeah. What do you want?
I'm working.
I don't go home with the customers.
Thanks.
Cheers.
You don't give up.
Joanna. Krumsky.
Good luck.
Not with me. I'm a black belt.
Not even him.
When the guys get drunk and start groping the girls. That's not tolerated.
No, but I heard about one. It's supposed to be Al Capone's.
Yeah, but that has to be a rumor. Mob guy with Al Capone's chair -- it's so clich√©. Gedda's like the last wise guy left in Vegas. Guess that's his way of keeping his culture alive.
Scumbags like him started Vegas. None of these lights would be here if it wasn't for them.
Money. The hours. The dancing.
Come here, you.
Relax.
It's just for your protection.
You want it? 
Doesn't it smell good? Very good.
You like trouble, don't you, big boy?
Hmm.
Are you scared? 
Don't -- 
What do you got for me? 
Sweet dreams.
Sweet dreams.

What's up, man?
One second ...
Who do you want now?
Sure.
Is this your slot card?
Sure.
Sheriff.
Look, dude, I didn't see it.
Chica had a nice, round ass and that's what I was scoping.
About three. She comes in, grabs some candy, looks outside, waves at somebody. The next thing I know, she flips her wig. She's screaming about her sister. I didn't see the girl or a car. Besides, there's a lot of traffic out there.
Kind of.
Inside we got five. They're all state-of-the-art. Place gets hit a lot. Outside they're all dummies.
Huh. I would've picked you for a leather guy.
Most popular models are the latex love-'em-or-leave-'em cheapies for bachelor parties. But in the midrange, Chrissy's not a bad choice.
Oh.
Bad for business.
Yeah, that is Zippy Tee.
Dude, I don't know where he lives.
It's not the Louvre. It's the love boutique. Local guys get store credit.
Yeah.
White guy. Brown hair. Little shorter than you. 40, maybe 45 ... 
Average looking.
Sorry. Declined again. You have another card?
It could be the card-reader. My manager'll be right back. If you guys want to get some coffee, it's on the house.
That's the kid from the news, right?
Are you sure it's really here? As I said when you called, we have no record.
Okay.
So it is.

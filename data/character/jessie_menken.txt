Scales found on your suspect's jacket are keeled. Diamondback rattlesnake. His others, smooth scales. A snake fang is basically a hypodermic needle. Oral glands hold in the venom ... like the barrel. When aggravated, the jaw muscles push on the toxin, like a plunger.
Well, your guy's probably pretty comfortable with his collection-- otherwise, he'd be dead -- which means, he could've milked this one.
Well, I know a lot of hot shots who drink the stuff -- manly, daredevil B.S. -- And they're still alive.
Hmm, then you're seriously screwed. Was there an abnormal tissue death? Necrosis?
That rules out his diamondback rattlesnake. Rattler venom's hemotoxic. It means it predigests the tissue before swallowing.
Well, your guy likes them mean. So ... These other two could've done the job, both neurotoxic.
Equine necropsy's a lot like human autopsy. One organ at a time. Do you know, they're a lot like us, except their constitutions are even more sensitive. A horse can die from indigestion.
Who said that?
Ah, James Bond fan, huh?
Well, the vet flushed and dilated her, but her white blood count was through the roof.
Hard to tell ... but the uterus is a highly-balanced environment, and an infection can start with something as simple as a speck of dirt. The uterine walls sense a foreign body, and attack it.
Well, they're supposed to, but she's got so much pyometra in her right uterine horn, something got in there.
Unless a horse is opened up, you can't actually reach the horns.
This is outside my purview.

Mugs?
I remember the first time I saw you. You didn't have any clothes on.
I would've taken you home right then if I could have.
I'll take care of it. You go back to the pit. Make sure nobody's robbing us blind.
You know, back in, uh ... in '67 I was in my 20s and ... I was drinking in a dive in downtown Buffalo. At the end of the bar was this pro quarterback drinking double scotches, two at t time midnight to 7:00 in the morning. It's Sunday, game day, mind you. So you know what I did? Called my bookie, bet against him. Guess what? I'll be damned if he didn't throw six touchdown passes.
You know, even when Tony was juicing he could run circles around these college, Harvard types ... and I'm not saying that just because he was my kid. Tony was the best damn casino exec this town has ever seen and just between you and me ... I couldn't hold a candle to him. Now he's dead. Overdose.
Nobody shoots at that target without going through me. 
What do you mean?
Which one? I mean, they were all trying to pick the gold out of his teeth.
She's the worst ... and he loved her the most. Can you believe it?
If I know her type, now that she has the gold she'll be going after the silver.
You know, this ... this could've all been his. His and Tony's.
Sure it is. I committed the cardinal sin. I loved one son more than the other.
But you can hide it. And I didn't. They're my sons ... I made them, I raised them ... and one kills the other.
You know, I should've married your mother.
Just wasn't in the cards, Catherine. It just wasn't in the cards.

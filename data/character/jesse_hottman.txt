Ah, just off work, huh?
Oh. What can I do for you?
Ah. Lady Dorton. Yeah, she's one of my relationships.
Okay. Um, I don't like to talk about my relationships out here. Let's take it someplace a little more intimate, yeah?
Uh, she picked me from the Meet Book.
Uh, she wanted what most women want.
The dream.
50 G's I make a month says I am. Who doesn't want to be swept off their feet?
Yeah, but you don't want to spend your whole life waiting for it either. Right here, right now, a woman can have a relationship with a man who only wants to please her -- who can make her laugh, wipe away her tears, give her the confidence to be herself.
I can handle about twenty-five at a time.
Yeah. She's been financially worshipping me for a while.
That's good. Means I'm doing my job.
Yeah. Um ... my relationships do get jealous sometimes, especially when one has more money than the other and can monopolize my time. Is that why you're here, because of that little catfight?
Margo was ... killed?
And you think Cotton Candy killed Margo?
Um ... I wouldn't know.
I don't see my relationships outside of here. You know, if it does happen, it marks the end of the relationship. I mean, by having s*x with me, a woman's reached her goal. There's nothing more I can give her.
She told me she was divorced.
Unless, of course, the relationship is ending.
I didn't kill her, all right? I ended the relationship and I bounced. Champagne got me sick.
So you want to end the relationship? 
Shh ...
She lied to me. Said she hired some private investigator to find me. Said she'd been building up the nerve to tell me the truth. Said she had a lot to make up for. And that, uh ... I could have her car. And that I didn't have to work anymore.
Yeah, lies to get closer to me. All my clients have their tactics. But hers was ... insane.
Then take me to jail. You know, call me a killer ... a murderer, whatever, but don't tell me I have a mother ... because I don't. I never did. And I never will.

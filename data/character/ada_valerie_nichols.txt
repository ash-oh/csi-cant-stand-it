Mr. Tanner, can you tell us what injuries you sustained as a result of the attack?
Would it be correct to say that while you were being attacked, you felt like your life was in danger?
So your official cause of death was ... ?
In his report, Mr. Sanders testified to that fact. The rock was found at the scene.
Demetrius James was going to finish off the victim with the rock.
Excuse me.
Mrs. James!
We are all very sorry for your loss, but you are not a witness here.
Judge, can we have some order here?
Judge?
It's probably good for his campaign. He's running for Assembly.
All right, let's take a look at the official transcript of your call for backup. 
01:54 and 21 seconds, Dispatch Control answers. Would you please read your response.
You took a couple of seconds to look at the street signs. There's a few more exchanges and then dispatch tells you: Closest unit has a five minute ETA. Five minutes. Control continues-- Rolling Code 3. Are they armed? Please read your response.
What'd you do?
Did that stop the beating?
Mr. James.
All right. Your Honor?
At this point, did you fear for your life?
Did you have a weapon, a gun?
What were you thinking when D.J. left Stanley Tanner's unconscious body and ran at you with that rock?
Now it's taken us several minutes to go through the events of that night. And I'm sure that you've all formed some kind of opinion about what happened. But, right now, let's put ourselves in Mr. Sanders' position. Let's see how much time Greg had to save a man's life. 
Seconds. Mere seconds. What would you have done? Mr. Sanders, was it your intention to kill Demitrius James?
Your Honor ...
See, excusable is a lawful act with no intention to kill. Justifiable means that the action was the only alternative. That's what they should have found.

Don't take everything you see at face value. Fifteen years ago, Diane decided she wanted to go back to work. And I encouraged her. But then she became ... driven. And I was slowing her down. She got nasty. I got depressed. I started taking antidepressants. She was mortified. Said it wouldn't look good. I said, Hey, I'm not one of your clients. I'm your husband. Not anymore, she said. She filed for divorce. And she said it was because the drugs affected my libido. We hadn't had s*x for eight months before I started taking the drugs.
Yeah. Yeah. Because of the meds, I don't drink very much. I did today because I thought it would take the edge off. It put the edge on.

I stuck around to see the ceremony. I even saw a little bit of the reception. I was sleeping it off when your guys found me.
No. But you better check to see if she's really dead, because I don't think you can kill the devil.

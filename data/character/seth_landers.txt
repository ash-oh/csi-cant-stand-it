Don't kill me! Don't kill me! Please! I'll do whatever Mr. Braun wants! 
Please don't kill me! Please!
Yeah.
Yes!
They came to me. It was their idea.
I built the computers to put in the shoes. That's all.
Scam was 20 to 30k a night, max. We hit Pike's. Next day, Tangiers. Everything was great. We made fifty grand, and then Teddy and Davis got greedy. You can't crush a roulette table like that, and not expect someone to notice.
No. His casinos are old school. They're low tech.  There's less interference for my gear.
I didn't get one. I just got paid for my supplies and my time. That's all.
It was a challenge. I just wanted to see if I could make it work.
Why don't you ask Sam Braun?
When they took teddy to the box, I was sure we were busted.
Davis freaked. He split.
And then when he came out with the money, everything was great.
For about two seconds.
They grabbed him and took him outside.
That was the last time I saw either one of them.
Hey, what's up, man? Am I going to get out of here?
You know what, you keep on asking me all these questions, but my lawyer says I'm not even supposed to talk to you.
What? I didn't kill anybody. This is crazy.
I waited outside the casino for an hour. Teddy didn't show up so I went to his place.
Davis, where are you, man? Braun got Teddy.
Davis, wake up, man!
I have never used a gun in my life.
Can't be.
Um ... the rule was that if something went wrong, we were supposed to just go home.
Uh... so I found the body, got blood all over my shirt, so... I gave it to my dad. I gave my dad the shirt. He's the one who had the shirt.
Dad! Dad!
Davis ... Davis is dead.
I think they got Teddy, too. Braun's on to us. What am I going to do?
The truth is, I just wanted him to like me. But I'm not him. You know, I'm never going to be him. Counting cards and the poker face. They say it's a skill, but it's a gift. Till Sam Braun took it away.
Yeah. I mean, I went after the whale, but I skinned it. I did what my dad could never do.
Hey, Sam.  Where's the ice?

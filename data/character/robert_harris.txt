I think that was his point.
Hello, Brian.
Look. Roger Valenti was an unhappy guy. Money problems. Family problems. He took the easy way out.
Twenty grand a day. I'm ten days ahead. 
He had the whole floor to himself. Valenti was usually my first guy up. He would drill the holes for the safety cables. No one walks a new slab until the cables are looped around the perimeter.
Well, like I said he was the only one up here.
GFCI would have prevented shock.
The Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter.
You see, if there's and electrical imbalance the GFCI trips the circuit and the tools are suppose to shut itself off.
The third prong grounds the drill. Without it, the interrupter's useless.
My prints are on the metal cutters because my prints are all over everything at the site. I'm the project manager.
I'm vigilant about safety. I'm always inspecting the equipment, tools ...
Of course not. I'm a union man myself.

Matocho. Nonsense word. You know where this name comes from? There's a legend in Central America. This man, he woke up in a bad mood. Killed eight members of his family with a machete and then went and had breakfast. Matar. To kill. Ocho. Eight. To kill eight. El Matocho.
Tick-tock. Tick-tock. Tick-tock. Tick-tock.

Hello, there.
I'm Sage. I'm looking for Nina.
She left work early Friday to see Jimmy Buffet in Tahoe. But then she never showed up at the shop today.
Sage.
Are you kidding? Jude and Nina had the marriage we all wanted.
You know, uh, your third eye is so open right now. Are you having visions or hearing voices?
I'm really sorry.  But you're radiating this crazy feminine energy.
Mm-hmm. Do you believe in past lives?
How come?
I think you're doing pretty well.

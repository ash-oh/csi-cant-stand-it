Yes?
Oh, yes. Is this about my car plates? I have them. I just haven't had time to put them on the car.
Oh, well, Mel isn't here right now.
Yes. He's at the store. Is there a problem?
Why do you keep asking me these kinds of questions?
I didn't kill Mel. I loved him.
Never. Never. We had a perfect marriage. Perfect.
I don't like your tone, young man. Detective, you said I could have an attorney at any time. I think I'd like one now.
No. I-I want to explain.
I couldn't afford the burial. So I-I got the saw ... and I cut him into manageable pieces.
Mmm.
Yeah. To Mount Charleston.
It's okay. Mel took those pills himself. He asked me to leave the house, so he could do it.
He was dying from the heart trouble. He was in chronic pain. He asked me to get it over with. I couldn't. I loved him.
I lied about why.
No. Let me talk. Mel made me promise to hide his body so I wouldn't lose his social security benefits.
Yes. Even if you've spent fifty years by his side -- packing his lunch, pressing his work pants. Mel was my whole life. I didn't kill him. I couldn't even put him out of his misery.

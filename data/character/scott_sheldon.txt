Kaye screamed at me a lot, that's for sure but I didn't kill her. In fact, I was out of town last week at a convention.
Five days ago. When I came back from my trip she was gone.
I keep my personal business private. If Kaye had left me again, I wasn't going to broadcast it.
It was probably our tv.
You're kidding me.
Kaye can get wild. If I came home late with friends I've wrestled her off me. I admit that.
Kaye was excitable. Like I said I've wrestled her off me, but I never, ever laid a hand on her.
You have your hands full with her.
Come on over. I've got nothing to hide.
Can I get you guys something to drink? Soda, ale?
She's shy.
Sometimes. Why?
Yeah, I, uh, cleaned it before I left town. Took out the garbage, too.  Does that make me guilty of something?
I fired them at the shooting range last month. I go there with a couple guys from work.
To a car. I drive a different demo every day. Perk of the dealership.
I have no idea how that got there.
Get your finger out of my face, bitch!
Look at her.
Can't you control her?
I told you she was a handful.
You're gonna leave me? Is that what you think?!
And all the guys are gonna see a woman walk out on me?
You just try...

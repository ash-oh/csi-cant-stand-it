At the walk-through you said that you saw a third suspect at the back of the store. Why did you make the decision to shoot?
Did you see a weapon?
What kind?
So you fired first.
Four times.
Can you explain the lack of evidence for a third suspect at the scene?
Did you see Julia Reed in your line of fire?
According to Supervising Criminalist Grissom's report, you had an unobstructed view of Ms. Reed, so how do you explain the fact that you didn't see her?
You don't deny that a bullet from your weapon killed her?
But you can't explain it?
Look, your partner was dead. You'd been shot. You saw someone you thought was a suspect and you fired. Under those circumstances, any one of us could make a mistake. Did you?
Officer Fromansky, answer the question.

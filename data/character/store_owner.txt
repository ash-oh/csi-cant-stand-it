So, what is it you need?
Oh, yeah. We sell about a hundred of these a month.
Yeah. Over here. 
Try to steal from me, you miserable lowlife! This time, I get justice! You're going to jail! You are going to jail!
Yeah, I remember that guy. He's, like, Chinese or something, real spun out.
Well, he was on something. He was acting all shady. Downed a bottle of soda before he even paid for it.
There ain't nothin' out here. People here act messed up because they are messed up.
I called it for him. Anything to get that tweaker out of here.
All I saw him do was walk through the door.

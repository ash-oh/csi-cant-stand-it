I'm going to go ring it.
Howdy. Dickie Jones. And you are?
How about after your shift, I take you out for a cup of coffee? And I could tell you my whole life story.
It's just a cup of coffee, doll. I'm not asking you to make love.
Not right away, anyway.
You know, I could open up new worlds to you. Have you ever had the back of those thighs kissed by a man ... who's standing up?
So you find dwarves funny?
Come on, what do you say? Is it because of my receding hairline?
Well, I just think you might be missing out, pookie.
But you haven't told me your name.
Catherine.
Catherine. Well, Catherine, we little people see things from a different perspective -- things other people might miss.
I'm just talking, doll-face.
What are you doing? 
I'm just trying to work-- 
Pookie, it's me, Dickie.
I've got information I think you might be interested in.
No. It has to be in person.
I'm at the studio.
There wasn't. Now there is. That's how it is with phones and electrical storms. Look, it's urgent. Get down here as soon as you can. 
The situation is evolving.
I look forward to it. Just hurry.

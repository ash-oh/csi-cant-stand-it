Huh?  Yeah, yeah, I'm ... I'm okay. I'm okay.
I'm fine, honest, I am.
Really, it's nothing.
I'd really rather you not do that. I'll tell you why. I don't, uh, I don't have any insurance.
Can I tell you something, sweetheart? You're drunk right now, okay? And you hit me. Now, that's a DUI, and if you call the police, they're going to take your license away, and they're going to throw you in jail. Now, what I'd like you to do is get in your car, drive yourself home and forget that this ever happened. Can you do that?
I'm fine. Go on. I'm fine, honest, I promise. You go.
Sorry.
I love you, too.
No gruyere in it, sweetie; I promise. All right, egg me.
Morning.
Yeah. I guess I lost track of time.
I kind of doubt that. I wouldn't worry, though. It won't happen again. These days I'm all about you, baby.
I know. I know, but daddies can have more than one baby.
Here, wait, wait. Try this, try this. Maddy made them.
Hadn't quite finished that.
Joey? Joey? Hey.
You don't hit on a cocktail waitress at the bar. Go sit at a table, then she's got a reason to come over and serve you, and it's less obvious.
I married a cocktail waitress.
This crappy little joint in Cleveland.
Mm-hmm.
Joe, you're, like, 40-something, right? Shouldn't you be toning it down a little?
I missed my family.
I'll send them my resume.
Mm.
Oh.
I was checking our stocks.
I'll throw some clothes on.
Two seconds.
Let's pretend ... that you're wearing a suit, and let's pretend we're in your office, and let's pretend I just cut you a big check for your services because you are still my damn lawyer.
There's some stuff I need. No particular order. 
No questions.
I know the guys you represent. I'm one of 'em. I need the stuff fast. Don't let me down.
You gave me the ATV for my birthday. I ride it because I love you.
Yeah.
I'm not planning a job! You know I don't do that anymore.
Honey, listen -- honey! Janice, look ... I had to take care of something.
I killed Clayton Nash.
I don't do robberies anymore.
He was a rat.
And Nash was the reason. The reason that you had to hide the money and live on the run. I never got caught! And I never would've got caught, except for that ... that lousy junkie who gave me up. I only had one rule: You never talk! And he talked.
Janice, he called me four weeks ago. He said, I'm in town for a while. Maybe we could we get together. He had something to tell me. Tell me what? I'm sorry? I'm sorry I stole seven years of your life. I-I couldn't let it go.
I didn't. Somebody else did. A girl named Ally Sullivan.
She crashed into my car right after I did Nash. She was gonna call the cops. I had to do it. I had to.
Just answer yes or no -- are the cops there?
Are they threatening to take Maddy?
That's what happens when you marry a crook.
Hey, officer.
I'm going to make your day.
I know the drill.
So, tell me ... where'd I go wrong?

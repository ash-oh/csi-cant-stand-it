I checked the circuit box. Blown fuse, room 39. That's when I found him.
That's hardly our first suicide.
Oh, come on, this loser? He's been here four weeks. He only paid for two. Wore the same clothes every day. No family, no friends.
Lance I'll have it for you tomorrow Frazer. I was going to throw him out in the morning.
Oh, thank god.
Told you. Loser.
You don't have to go through the dude's mail. Name's Manny Rupert. He's a new tenant. Paid first and last in cash.
We got a lot of party people around here. You know, so there's loud music every night, but this dude was pumping tunes at seven in the morning. You know, I knock on the door, I go in, that's when I see the dude all laid out on the bed. Uh, figured I better step out, call in the big guns. That's you.
Um, listen ... if my good citizenship is not going to be appreciated here, maybe I just don't call the next one in, you know?
Um ... okay.

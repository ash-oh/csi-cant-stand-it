Yeah, Celia and I scoped out Zumanity. Sexy stuff.
I've got all kinds of alleys, but, uh, yeah, I'd say that's one of them.
I touched her feet for over an hour. She tried on twenty pairs of shoes.
Yeah.
I'm a gentleman. Best toe cleavage I ever saw.
Nothing. We had a nice time; she split. Haven't seen her since.
Nah, man, not me.
Look, uh, are we done, 'cause I got to get back to work.
Okay, so what if I was there?
Zumanity got me all worked up. She was grabbing on me. I-I was down to do whatever she wanted.
Go backstage at Ka, see it up close and personal. She was bananas about that show. She said to meet her near the artists' entrance just after the show started. I did. She let me in.
I figured maybe backstage at Ka was her version of the mile high club.
Celia, just relax for a minute.
Something clipped her in the side of the head. She fell. She didn't even scream.
I was just so freaked out, I bailed, I'm telling you. I tried to warn her, but she was just too fired up. She kept trying to get closer and closer and closer.

Mr. Stokes.
You got stuck on this one, too?
Husband reports his wife missing and her car's at a bus terminal. Come on. Lady took a trip. Didn't want him to know where to. Not much of a mystery.
No. We just slim-jimmed. We checked for a body -- didn't find one. Big surprise.
No. I didn't touch a thing.
We had dinner last week. I thought it went great. You never called.
Yeah.
And the carpet's clean.
What lies beneath?
You're checking for blood?
Looks like our missing person might be a homicide.
How's the case going?
Just got a hit on one of our missing lady's credit cards. A motel.
Four Aces.
I've got some uniforms meeting us there.
Las Vegas police. Your husband reported you missing.
Uh, Nick, let's get out of here.

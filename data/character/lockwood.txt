Lockwood, Homicide. DFO's in the back.
Stan Grevey, 35. Backup sax player. One of the waitresses found him.
Nope. Just pronounced, that's it.
No, not a word just said he reminded her of Coltrane.
She was just coming on shift. She came through me. Already cleared her.
It's too late for that.
You have dinner yet? SARA: Yeah. Why? LOCKWOOD: You might be seeing it again. 
Mandy Kirk. Seventeen.
Senior. Janitor found her.
Maybe a wild animal? They picked up a mountain lion last week in Henderson.
Well, each cheerleader is assigned a soccer player.  She's his bunny. Gives him gifts the night before the big game places his wake-up call.
Yeah, that's what I asked the principal but he said no. He said that, uh it's all good, clean fun.  Gifts are inspirational videos like, uh, Rocky and wake-up calls are pep talks, nothing more.
Yeah, well, victim Mandy was soccer bunny to a Chuck Darwell. And when I called him on his cell this morning he said that he hooked up with Mandy after every game except last night. 
Said he hadn't seen her last night.
Hospital. Got rushed there two minutes ago.
Whoever killed Amanda Kirk ingested her organs, Mr. Darwell. Left teeth marks.
Is that stomach contents?
Anything he throws up no longer belongs to him. PD, public domain.
You would on PCP.
You and Mandy were on the soccer field. You were cranked up. SARA: Do you remember anything?
Nicole Exmoor, 18. School nurse said she couldn't stop throwing up. Teacher found her passed out in the locker room.
Said that she ate something that didn't agree with her.
Ms. Sidle can make an impression of your teeth or you can help yourself and explain what happened.
I'm placing you under arrest for the murder of Amanda Kirk.
That's up to the D.A.

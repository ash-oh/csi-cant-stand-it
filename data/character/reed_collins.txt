Bob is dead?
We're roommates. I got divorced last year. And about six months ago, Bob's wife kicked him out. He needed a place to crash and I needed help with the mortgage. He's two months late on the rent. How do I go about collecting under the circumstances? 
Look, we were roommates. We weren't really friends.
We both work at the Tangiers. He managed the restaurant, and I work in maintenance. Last monday we drove in together.
Mondays? No. After shift, he'd walk over to the university. He's an amateur photographer. Take the bus home.
I didn't think much of it. He's always going back and forth with Charlotte. His wife. What do I care? As long as the rent's paid.
Packing up Bob's stuff. Found it on his dresser. Thought you'd want to see it.

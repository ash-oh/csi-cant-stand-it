What's he, dead?
It's machine 25 again. Been spitting silver all day. It's a good day to gamble.
What's the occasion?
That's Dennis Kim. Flies in four, five times a year from Seoul to play baccarat. Very generous player. We reserve a table exclusively for him while he's in town.
Yeah. He's at his table right now.
There's Mr. Kim, right there.

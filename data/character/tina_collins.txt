When can I be with my sister? She's so scared.
No, but they sounded like footsteps coming from the kitchen.
Yes.
I don't know. My dad checks the house at night. It's always been a safe neighborhood.
I hook up with different guys. No one special.
Buffalo? No.
I know my brothers' footsteps. And my Dad's. These were different.
I don't know why I didn't get blood on my pajamas. I just didn't.
I saw my family dead. I was scared. I ran to the neighbors. That is the truth.
I want to see my sister.
You don't understand. I need to speak with her.
How can you tell?
That was the last night he was going to touch her.
Because they should have protected me.
My father ... 
I was young. I learned to deal. But when he went for my daughter ...
The father? I was thirteen ... and nobody noticed that my clothes were getting bigger. Nice, huh? Brenda may hate me for what I did ... but I protected her. I did that much.

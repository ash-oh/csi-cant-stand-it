Hey, Amelia requested me. I was up there every night. I hooked her up. And she wasn't drinking no Italian Rotgut either. She was ordering '93 pinot from Russian River Valley. That's three-fifty a bottle, twenty percent delivery charge. You do the math.
No.
No, that mutt wasn't there.
Yeah, that manager scumbag. You bring a bottle of wine when he's there, forget about it. He signs for the bill and stiff city. Now, when the Prince of Soul is there, that's a different story. He'd give you $500 just to get lost.
Yeah, I saw him for a sec. He came in between shows. He showed me the door.
Hey, I could tell they were in love, you know? But he was never around. I mean, I felt bad for Amelia. She'd have four times a night.
No, but I heard 'em. And I'm sure 2202 and 2206 heard

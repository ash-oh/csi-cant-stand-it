I don't understand. Becky was in perfect health. Can I see her? I'd like to see my daughter.
But you said she fell.
Anything.
When she dropped Susan off yesterday evening, she came in for a few minutes. Said she was headed home and out to dinner with Ray.
Yeah.
Why is that important?
Susan, would you give me a moment with the detective?
You said you found my daughter's body on the stairwell?
You're aware that Ray's first wife, Susan's mother, was found the same way?
They said Susan's mom died of a stroke.
I never had any reason to doubt it.
Ups and downs. About a year ago, Ray's business went under. And Becky works for Western Airlines. They've been downsizing since 9/11. It's been rough.
Do I have to answer that?
Detective, what's going on?
A warrant?! What?

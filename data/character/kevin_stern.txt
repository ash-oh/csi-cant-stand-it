You sent a cop all the way to Pahrump to bring me in. What couldn't we discuss on the phone?
It was about three months ago. She came to my vineyard for a visit.
She left early. Said she felt sick.
Mom was uncomfortable around my four-year-old.

She could hardly look at him. It's nice, huh?
My vines contracted black rot last spring. It's an expensive problem. Why are you checking my credit?

Yeah. Organic's a fad.
Whatever.  We done?

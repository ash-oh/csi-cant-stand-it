We're closed.
Take it to the dealership in the morning.
Lady's driving a brand-new Beemer. First service is 15,000 miles. Things don't go wrong.
You know how women get.
Go ahead, pop the hood.
Back away.
Run, run!
Run!
Guess I must have shut it, then. I wasn't thinking; I was reacting, you know? No harm, no foul.
Come again?
I wear gloves.
I wear them most of the time.
Knock yourselves out.
You guys having fun?
Don't use vice grips -- pipe wrench has a better feel. Must belong to one of my mechanics.
Yeah, I guess I do.
Ready.

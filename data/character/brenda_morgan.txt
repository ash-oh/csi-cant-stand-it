Yes, he's been to some of our events. We've exchanged hellos.
I'm pretty sure I saw him at the mixer. Why?
I didn't notice. But you could check the message board.
When you see somebody you like, you leave them a note. If they respond, you're in luck. If they don't, it's softer than face-to-face rejection. We get that enough as it is.
The answer is no.
I didn't want to get involved. I still don't.
Look ... Maurice wasn't a nice guy, but I slept with him anyway. I could service him all night, and he wouldn't even ride the elevator with me.
I'm fat, Ms. Sidle. I am a fat woman. I've tried diet after diet, joined gym after gym, done obesity programs, obsessed about drastic surgery, and I'm still fat. I didn't get my high school crush. I did his homework. Didn't get the one in college, either. He became my friend. But Maurice left a note in my slot on the message wall. And he made me feel special ... sexy ... wanted. 
When I went up to his room, she was leaving.
I thought about turning around, but it's not like I've had a lot of chances. It wasn't till afterwards ... that I started to feel ... angry. At myself. For letting him take advantage of me.
No. I waited for him to fall asleep. Then I smothered him with a pillow and held him down until he stopped moving.
A few years. What difference does that make?
Do you always ask questions you already have the answers to?
I don't drink a lot.
Wake up. Wake up.
Wake up.
I just couldn't bear the jokes. Be some comedian's punch line. I would rather admit to murder and go to jail ... than to ever be that.

While unis were canvassing the area, they said they found this.
Looks like we have what's left of a body.
Heard you were working on Captain Ferris.
Would you like to tell us what happened that night, Major?
Or, at the very least, make Claudia and TRP the fall guy.
Hey, Morgan.
Hannah's wound was immediately debilitating and fatal.
Henry identified the animal blood we found in the Fishers' tent.
Jared Briscoe, the Gig Harbor Killer.
The owner already started cleaning up inside.
What is that powder?
Any point in, uh... dusting for prints?
Oh, check it out.
Yep, the trail ends right over here.
Got something else.
Gives her a silver dye job to die for.
Drug possession, burglary... pandering?
He knows Tori Nolan.
Jared Briscoe, the Gig Harbor Killer.
All of our victims are involved in the s*x trade. We never knew who was pimping them out.
Sorry to interrupt.
Collin Winthrop.
It's not gonna help us find his son.
All right, we have very big plans tonight.
Wow, it's a really good turnout.
Bye, girls.
Oh, no!
I know there's a gunman.
Jared Briscoe, the Gig Harbor Killer. Murdered seven women.
St. Gabriella's Convent.
Well, let's hope so.
D.B., I got a court order to exhume the grave.
Oh, we will.
Hey.
Yes, he is. We both are.
I'm sorry, who are you?
Uh, he shouldn't have those.
He was telling the truth about one thing. Eight months ago, Desert Peace did have a fatality. A female patient OD'd on sleeping pills.
If Zach is not the killer, where are we?
So, we are just about cleared out, and I'm officially releasing the rooms.
I was doing some digging, and I checked police activity in the alley the night of the murders.
So you said that, on Sunday night, at about 7:00 p.m., you were not in the laundry room.
He was.
Hey.

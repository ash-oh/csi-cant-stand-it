So you were at the strip club on official business earlier in the day, but then you went back on your own time later?
And that's when you met the victim?
Approximately how much money did you spend getting to know the victim?
And that would be the investigation the undersheriff told you to drop?
You still on the modafinil and the zolpidem?
Did you take them yesterday?
So, today is the first day of the rest of your life, hmm?
So, in the course of developing this informant, you took her to a motel and had s*x with her?
CSI Brown, in your mind, is there any distinction between personal and official?

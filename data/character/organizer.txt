Adam Brenner was one of our top division one players. Ranked in the high 1,800s.
Logos has all the skill of chess combined with the cruel whimsy of fate. Adam once set a tournament record by scoring 735 points in a single game.
Justifiably. It's an incredible achievement.
You actually suggesting that somebody here killed Adam?

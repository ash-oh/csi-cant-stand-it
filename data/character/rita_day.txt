Sure, I know Duane. He's a good boss. I just hated being cooped up in an office building all day.
Yeah, sure. Why?
Damn. Well, I'm sorry.
Lost the Colt in a poker game years ago.
I was drunk as a skunk. Met these guys at a bar. Lost a small fortune trying to keep up with their raises.
Well, he's an older guy, at least fifty. I remember guys were calling him Cy, but that wasn't his real name. He had this large mole between his eyes.
Yeah. I swear I thought that thing was winking at me.
No problem.

Come on, come on, come on, come on. Come on, come on!
Oh, god, you've got to help me, please, help me.
I'm in my car. There's this maniac, he's following me ...
Help me, please!
Help me, please! Oh, my god!
What?
Go to hell!
Oh, my god, you've got help me, please. Help me!
Please ... pl-please.
Hey, sweetie ...
Oh, god, no! Help me!
Help!
No!

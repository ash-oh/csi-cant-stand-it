I was in labor for 27 hours. They didn't want to come out. Who could blame 'em.
I thought it would be easier.
I did the best I could, Mr. Grissom. Their father couldn't look at 'em. Took off when they were a few weeks old. Babies are supposed to be cute.
At the time, we were living in Fresno. Family, friends stopped visiting. They were scared of my children. Especially Allison. She ... she looked like ... when she started nursery school, the kids teased her, called her names, made her cry.
It was best for everyone but she became completely dependent on me, and for eighteen years, I took care of her.
One day, Allison wanted to take a walk ... outside. I didn't want anyone to see her. We had a fight. I locked her in her room -- my own child - because she wanted fresh air. At that moment, I knew I needed to leave. I told Hayden to tell her I was in a car accident. Two days later, he put on a black suit, told her he was going to my funeral.
Please don't judge me. I spend enough time doing that.
I haven't seen either of them for seven years. I wouldn't have any idea.
And tell her what? That I faked my death to escape from her? How do you say that to your own flesh and blood?

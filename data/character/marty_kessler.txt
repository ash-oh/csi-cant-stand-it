You really, really ought to have the one with chocolate icing.
Hello, Officer.
Detective. Sorry, I ... uh, just a little something for you and your boys, uh, a token of appreciation for local law enforcement.
Go ahead. Coffee's fresh. Didn't even spit in it.
Not that I ever would. I, I love cops.
Marty, uh, Martin Kessler. I live here ... there, right over there, number 2305.
So, uh, does this have anything to do with the missing cats?
People have lost a lot of pets in this neighborhood. Too many, if you get my drift.
Not personally, but, uh, I know kids around here throw fireworks ...  ... illegal, down there. Kaboom! Kaboom! Four o'clock in the morning. Kids have no respect for the law.

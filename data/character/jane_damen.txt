She was getting better, though. She had a, uh... rough time after college finding herself, but she was getting better.
The shoeprint that you found in Linda's bedroom? Are you thinking that Brody might have...?
We like to think of her as normal, as improving. She was prescribed lithium her junior year of college.
Well, it's a catch-22. When Linda's in an up phase, she doesn't think she needs the lithium, so she doesn't take it which then makes her more unstable.
Made.
I take valium on occasion. Yes. Our lives get pretty frenetic just trying to keep up with Linda. 
I did not drug my daughter.
Did Linda's boyfriend put you up to this? Because he is not stable.
John?

Those two guys came out of nowhere ... made everybody go to the corner.
Uh ... dry goods. Then one guy grabs Celeste ... 
I was looking at his piece, not his face, okay?
Uh, shotgun. He drags her over to the registers, makes her open 'em up. She does. They're pulling out the cash, and then he sees the cops roll up. Second guy says, everybody, get down and don't say a freaking word, so that's what I did.
... And then?
... ankles and flashes and booms.
That's all I remember.
No, I didn't.
I got to change my pants.
I got to change my pants.
Look, I go to that store to bag groceries, not to get my ass shot off. I figure I earned the money. Kind of like working overtime.
Whoa, wait a minute. You think ... ? No way.
Not from me, they didn't. Look, you want to bust me for the money, go ahead, I took it. But I did not set the thing up.

You know, I was really pissed off at Stacy when I heard about the whole ... hair dryer thing, but her ... her friends had put her up to it. Stacy wanted me to give you something.
It's a peace offering. I think you'll look great in it at the spring formal. Oh, you are so going.
Over here.
Dad ...
I want to talk.
Without my dad.
This doesn't get back to our families, all right? My dad's a deacon, and Stacy's dad is, too. They'll never understand.
I was pressuring Stacy to have s*x. She kept resisting. It was that stupid virginity pledge that she had taken at the high school. I told her that I loved her, and that nothing should get in the way of that.
Yeah.
Yeah. I love you. I love you with all of my heart.
There was a little blood. Not a lot, but ... after, she ... she started feeling guilty, so I went back into the front of the car and I tossed the condom. And ... then I ... wiped my fingers under the seat.
Stacy said that she was afraid that God would punish her for having s*x. I told her that was crazy. Guess I was wrong.

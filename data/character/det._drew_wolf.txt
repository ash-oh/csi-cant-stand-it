My favorite CSI. I was hoping you'd get the call out.
Had everything but you.
One body, male caucasian. Looks like a home invasion. Listen, I'm headed next door. I'm going to talk to a neighbor who heard shouting, called 9-1-1. Keep me posted?
I got a feeling they both did. The owner of the house has a franchise of fast food places. Uh, fast and fresh burgers. I just got off the phone with him from Hawaii. Alvin Jackson. Three stores in the Vegas area. And he's on his yearly vacation.
You bet. 
Listen, Catherine. Me and Warrick can handle this. 
All right, so we take them one by one.
You all right?

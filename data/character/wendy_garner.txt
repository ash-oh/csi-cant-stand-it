Officer ... thank God you're here.
Yeah, I ... I ... I was speeding, uh ... of course, but you have to understand, you see, someone is chasing me.
You see, I have videos. 
Officer, if I could ... if I could just show you.
Oh, my God, what is this? How could you do this? I just wanted you to keep my secret from Aaron, not this. I trusted you. How could you just leave her like this? 
So much blood.
I mean, this day means so much to me. And to have girlfriends like you, it's just amazing. 
Mimosa, look, it's me. I need your help, okay? I have these videos and I have to show you them. You're never going to believe what's on them. These people ... they have to be stopped.

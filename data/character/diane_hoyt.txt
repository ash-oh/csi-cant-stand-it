Any news?
Oh, my God.
Hi.
Thank you.  Where's Joey?
Okay.
Yes. I was baby-sitting.
Uh ... I'd just put Joey down. A little after 9:00.
About half an hour later. We both talked to her.
Excuse me.
I'll answer anything they want. I backed my car into a telephone pole. So I put it in the shop. I had to rent a car.
It's a fantasy car. Ever since Amy got hers, I've wanted one, so I splurged.
You mean, did I let anybody drive it?
Lori and Mark both did. But I was always with them.
No.
I'm her stepmom. That's not a secret.  I couldn't have children of my own. Ever since Lori's father died a few months ago, she's all I had. 
Look, Mark is devastated. I really should get back to my grandson.
No, I don't know him.
No, not that I remember.
I left Lori's house, drove home and went to bed.

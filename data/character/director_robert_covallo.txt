Yes, sir, I just got here. Several injuries, one serious. Fire department arson explosives are assessing the damage right now. 
What'd you do to my lab, Grissom? 
I'm going to need a complete evidence inventory by case. What's been lost, what's contaminated, what's salvageable.
Well, we'll never sell that in court. Defense attorneys will rip us apart. That, uh, double murder movie star case last year, compromised evidence, lax procedures, mistakes.
You got lucky. This is a priority. I want to know how this happened.
I'll be waiting for her report.
You hadn't identified the liquid?
And it was consumed in the explosion so I guess we'll never know what it was. In any event, you placed this unidentified chemical under the fume hood.
Next to an active heat source.
Because you didn't check.
Why not?
There were 13 active cases in DNA. They are all now tainted or destroyed.
Sorry doesn't cut it. You're on suspension. Five days unpaid leave.
Grissom. We're not done here. I've heard rumors that you've been kicking back Willows' reports.
Great. Well, while you're at it, maybe she can reissue the lab explosion.  Let me explain something to you. 
Every one of us ...
In this building, all of us ...
Okay. It's not your job to protect your people. It's to protect the integrity of this lab.

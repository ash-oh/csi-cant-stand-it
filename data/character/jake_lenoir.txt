What's going on?
Let me tell you something that the, um ... newspapers, TV stations don't want to hear. There's nothing over there to photograph. Insurgents? They fire off their outdated weapons, then run the other way. When we do midnight raids in the villages, you know what the people tell us? Ali Baba not here. We are fighting a fictional character. And you got thousands of soldiers over there, kids, 18 years old, pumped up on testosterone, full of nicotine, and caffeine, waiting for something to bloody well happen. And you know what? You pray for a roadside bomb because it feels like action. But you can't photograph the taste of gasoline. It just looks like smoke. So one day, yeah, I'm screwing around on my computer. Couple of soldiers come by, took a look at what I'm doing. You know what they say? They say, Yeah, yeah, that's our war. That's what it's like waiting and bodyhauling. So I had it. I had the image that said it all. So yes, I used a lie to tell the truth.
What?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, well, I heard she committed suicide and look --
Yeah. Me and her, we-we had a history, okay. We dated. But if she felt like outing me for this all I had to do was accuse her of sexual harassment and we both go down.
Doubtful. Without her job, she had nothing.
Yeah, but not for long. Bird was rigid in everything she did. Having s*x with her was like ... eating glass.
Well, I was probably the last person to actually walk that dog. God knows she never did.
So there were two of them. I dated Jill. She kept the most rigid schedule of anyone I've ever met, you know. It was always Thursday night pick up the dry cleaning night. And I mean, God forbid I wanted to see a movie or catch a show or something. Leave it to Jill to be so thorough. Makes me have to kill her twice.

Still working on it, Warrick. I don't work one case a day.
You look terrible.
That doesn't sound like you.
That's virtually untraceable.
Hit man was a ghost.
Make that one thing.
It gets worse. Got a print off your quarter. Ran it through AFIS. Came back your dead man.
Pretty gruesome. 
Was your guy a gambler?
So I've got some good news and mysterious news.
Well, your results are back from the prints on the car. And your vic, Walter Banglor, is top of the list.
You fumed the entire car. What did you expect?
I found some speckles of blue dust in the ridges of Banglor's print. Here. Look it.
Mr. Grissom, the prints are back from Stuart Rampler's mini-recorder.
Not print-- prints.
It's two thumbprints overlapped.
Yeah. Running both prints through AFIS.
How can that be?
Uh, Catherine, can you excuse us for a moment? I need to speak with Mr. Grissom in private.
Well, the top print came back Paul Millander.
It came back you.
Well, if their names are Curt Ritten and Janine Haywood the answer's, no, it's not their prints.
Maybe you have the wrong suspects.
Look, I'm not your beast of burden. Sara, this is your thing.
I'll give you something dandy. Your doggie-door prints. Good-bye, I have to go on a break now.

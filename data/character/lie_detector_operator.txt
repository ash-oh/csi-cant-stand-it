Remember -- yes or no.
Did Tina Collins approach you at school and ask you to kill her family?
Would you lie about that to escape the death penalty?
Did you kill her family?
Did Tina let you in the front door the night of the killings?
Yes or no?
Did she already have a knife for you?
Did you use that knife to kill Barbara Collins?
And Mr. Collins?
And both sons?
Was Tina mad at her parents for not letting you see each other?
Did Tina Collins tell you she wanted them dead so you could see each other?

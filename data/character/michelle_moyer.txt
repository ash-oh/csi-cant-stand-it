Sorry I didn't get here sooner. I was pretty upset.
We were engaged. I can't believe he's gone.
There was a golf tournament on ESPN that night. He wanted me to tape it for him. I was trying to reach him because I was at my folks' place and the VCR was broken. Sounds so silly now. I'd like to see him ... to say good-bye.
I called Hayden so many times that my battery died. 
You know about his condition, right? It made him really sweet. I mean, it was like he was constantly trying to make up for his physical imperfections by doing everything perfectly. He was the perfect boyfriend, the perfect lover, my best friend. I don't know what I'm going to do without him.
I had just announced our engagement to my family. Brent flipped out. I was upset. Everyone was yelling at me. I went for a long walk to clear my head. And when I got back, Brent was gone. He told my parents that he was going to speak with Hayden.
My brother has a temper.
When Brent called and told me that Hayden was dead, he said that if I told you guys ... if I implicated him ...

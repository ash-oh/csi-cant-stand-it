To be honest, I haven't seen my husband in over a year.
He made it big in venture capital. Retired at 32. That's when we started having problems. The officer said Rod died while hunting. Can I ask what happened?
No. In our circle of friends, he was the only one who owned a gun. We used to fight about his sport. I showed him studies about how the animals suffer, how even the best hunters don't always get center shots. Well ... I guess brutality begets brutality.

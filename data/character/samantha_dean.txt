I didn't answer.
No, I mean, I can't remember. We're both in bed by nine.
Brandon. You a mother?
Um, do you have any more questions because, uh, Brandon needs to go to my mother's. I have to go to work.
This is ridiculous. I don't even own a stereo.
No.
Of course not.
No.
Please, just leave! Just go! Please!
Honey, it's okay. 
Am I under arrest?

When I made him leave, he said he'd call an L.A. Lawyer and take Brandon away from me. 
I'm not sure now what I was going to do but ... 
... when I saw him with the heroin next to him ... I knew nothing had changed. 
I carry needles in my kit. 
I am not proud of my youth and my son was never going to be a part of that world. You're a mother. What would you be willing to do to save the life of your child?

I love my grandpa -- don't get me wrong -- but he's got no idea how it works in here. I'm not sure you do, either.
First off, this place only sees two colors: Black and white. You stay with your own. Despite what those chucks think upstairs this entire place is infiltrated with rolling 60s. Overflow from L.A.
Yeah. I mean, I'm just trying to survive, man. I'm 60 days and a wake-up unless I get got.
First, you got to tell me something. You got to tell me what side you're on.
Who put me in here?
All right. It breaks down like this --
Kingpin from Gerson Park and Kingpin from L.A. County/Slauson both under one roof. It was time for one of them to stake their claim. 
Vegas fool got shanked. 
I was sitting right there. I had two things going against me: I'm the newest face and the only witness.
Basically, yeah and everybody knows about it. They're just waiting to see what I'm going to do. I sing ... they send me a song back. I shut up ... I'm your age when I get out.
So I don't have to testify?
How'd you know it was RC's?
Oh, god. 
I owe you, man.
I love you, grandpa.
Pops ... hey, you okay?
Pops, let me explain to them. 
They should hear what happened.
No. That's how it was.
I'll come see you with a lawyer.
I won't.
There's just the two of us.
Thanks, no. I'll take the bus.
Pops, I'm sorry, but I got to.
Hey, pops, it's me. Tips were good. 
Hey, I thought I'd go check out a movie over at the plex. 
Okay. See you later.
I didn't know that little girl was dead. I swear. I didn't know what to do. I knew Pops would know.
Don't worry, Pops. I'll be okay.
You, too. Don't be going downhill.

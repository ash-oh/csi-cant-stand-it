No. She's a Jane Doe. She's got two bullets lodged in her brain. Docs can't remove them without killing her.
Feels different, huh?

Hi.
Victim's name is Stuart Rampler. Lives in town reserved a room for one night because his house was being fumigated.
I bagged a couple of utility bills. 
Ready for mail. It's almost as if he wanted to take care of some unfinished business before he checked out.
It's an upside-down stamp. What does that mean?
He wiped it clean.

Yes ...
... I was near the dorm that night.
Introduction to philosophy, yes.
Amanda ... uh, I'll talk to you tomorrow after class.
Not if I can help it.
She was a very bright, young woman. 
Henry David Thoreau. But that's just broken pottery.
I'm married.
She was never in my car; she was never in my house.
Here. That's how the vase broke, because we were ... 
Amorous.
And tell you what? That I cheat on my wife with my student who is missing and I have absolutely no information?
No. I ... I went to the dorm. I-I did. I went to, I don't know, maybe to stop her maybe to say good-bye one last time but at the very least, I wanted to see her. But she never came down.
Can I meet you there? I-I'm not going anywhere. I just need a little time to explain all this to my wife.
Thank you.
I don't need counsel. The only person I was hiding from was my wife. She knows everything now. So ask your questions.
Well, that's impossible because she's never been in my car. Are you sure it was hers?
Well, maybe it was on my sweater or something.
I don't know ... 
I only use my cell phone when I call her -- not my office, not my home.
Faculty lunch that day, 12:00 to 2:00, every department head. And it will stand up in court.
No. 
No.
Sharon, someone called Paige from the house, and it wasn't me.
How long have you known?
They found Paige's hair in the car and they think ... did you attack her?

Well, I'm sorry to hear about Christina, but we broke it off months ago. I haven't seen her since.
Huh?
How in the hell do you know about my s*x life?
Well, that's why I dumped her.
And fine, I saw her a couple of days ago. She called me in a panic. Dingbat had locked herself out with her damn baby still inside the house. Thought I had her spare key. I didn't. She sounded hysterical, so I went over to help.
Yeah. Well, she wanted to talk. 
All right, get this. She tried to tell me that God got her pregnant.  I mean, if that's true, the big guy owes me an apology
Well, you guys were investigating her murder, and I want to stay out of it.

I don't understand. If you found blood in Sidley's house, why isn't he in jail? I mean, can't you at least hold him until you determine whether or not it's Caroline's?
I brought her brushes and combs. Anything else I could find. Think you'll be able to get enough DNA off that stuff?
I know the cops say that if you don't find them quickly, you don't usually find them alive. But every time the phone rings or there's a knock at the door, my first thought ... my first hope is that, uh ... it's Caroline.
When you guys were first investigating her disappearance, you couldn't get access to Sidley's place, so I appealed to his kid.
The cops can't get a warrant. I'm not saying he hurt Caroline, but maybe there's something in your house that will help me find her.
Look, maybe you could just talk to him. Convince him to let me take a look around the place.
All right, if you change your mind, give me a call. Anytime.
Unfortunately, I never heard from him. Ms. Willows ... if the blood you found matches my daughter's DNA, tell me that the b*st*rd's going to jail ... for the rest of his life.
It's true. All of it. You gonna arrest me?
Hold on. I didn't kill anyone.
I took the body from Desert Palms Hospital, from the morgue. He was already dead, a John Doe. Auto accident in a stolen vehicle. Car exploded, he was burned beyond recognition. Ms. Willows, I stole a dead body and I trespassed, but that's it.
You're a mother, right?
Why do you think I did it?
Look ... I wish I could say that I was sorry for the trouble I've put you through, or the-the petty crimes that I've committed, but I didn't hurt anyone ... and Martin Sidley is behind bars, and my daughter's getting her funeral. And that's all I wanted.

Captain, this is not like her. Of course it's no accident they're missing together.
We thought that Megan was sleeping over at Sheila's.
Uh, Sheila Latham, her best friend. When I called Megan on her cell phone this morning, I couldn't reach her, so I called the house, and, uh, she wasn't there. And Sue Latham didn't know anything about a sleep-over.
Stupid I can live with. I need to know they're okay.
Let's go.
Oh.
Thank you, Charlie. Thank you. You've always been very good to her.
Sure.
Oh, my God.

Man, I'm not a rapist. I was a date rapist, which is not even the same thing. And besides, back then, roofies were in.
It's not like that. It's not like that at all.
What -- ?
Can I get a soda, too? I'm, like, parched.
Uh, yeah, yeah. I was out at Jet ... I was kind of faded, I guess. Um, I bumped into Ally, and she offered me a ride home. I needed it.
Yeah, Ally don't care where I live; she's a cool girl.
Oh, yeah.
Nah.
No, look, we really didn't talk that much. But we would text all the time. That's, like, when you use your cell phone to send, like, you know, words.
Fine.
Sorry. Look, I'm telling you the truth, you really couldn't get Ally on the phone, it's all texting with her. Well, what do you want my DNA? You want me to pee into a cup? You want my underwear? 
Whatever you want, you got it, cause I didn't kill Ally.
Can I get a soda?

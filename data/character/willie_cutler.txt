Get out of my way.
Just get out of my way.
How was she, you little son of a bitch? Now get out of here.
Please! Please don't! Don't kill me. Don't kill me. Don't kill me. Please, don't kill me.
That sounds bad.
Can I get something to wear?
Um. Not much to tell, really. Uh ... Cowboy Dan had the office working round the clock for the last week. We were putting together a campaign for a new tour. I just got back from breakfast.
I heard a shot, shouting.
I guess the guy didn't even know I was there.
I was so scared, I couldn't move. So I just played dead.
Ow. I don't even know how long I was there. And then you guys came in and found me.
Um ... I guess I was standing somewhere around here.
Look, I need to call my wife. I should have been home by now, and she's probably worried.
Um ... I guess it was, uh ... probably yesterday morning. Why?
Wh...?
What do you mean?
Yeah. That's got to be it.
I don't know. Maybe it's just some nutcase. A guy sees me on the street, and I remind him of somebody he hates.
Sure.
Hmm? Timmy? 
No.
Well, he's lying. 'Cause I wasn't home.
Look, my wife and I had some problems. You know, all married couples do.
I was getting a promotion at work. At least I thought I was. So I threw myself a little celebration.
Cowboy Dan just couldn't bring himself to promote a felon.
Stupid kid stuff. You know, it follows you around the rest of your life.
I got shot, too.
So?
That's not true! 
I didn't kill my wife! I lost this money at the tables. You know ... this has been the worst day of my life, and I still haven't had a chance to see my wife's body -- I want to leave.
We're done! You can't prove that I killed anybody because I didn't kill anybody. And if you're not going to charge me, I'm going to leave. 
I want to see my wife's body now!
Oh, you're a tough guy? You wanna go through me then if you ...
Huh? You think you want some of this, huh?
Get out of my way!
Get out of my way!
Shut up, or I'll kill you.
Hello?
I will blow her head off. I'll blow both our heads straight off. You understand me?!
I'm not coming out.
Why do you want to come in here?
Close that door.
Either I walk out here right now, or she dies.
You sure about that?
Then I want to talk to my brother.
You're lying!
Where is he?
He was just trying to help me.
No way.
You really have my brother?
I want to talk to him.
I don't see his face, she dies!
Oh, yesterday I spent $5,000 on a hooker because I thought I was getting a $15,000 promotion. When I went to work, I got the news that I'd been
Well, way I saw it, I was fifteen in the hole. So I went to a cash machine and I wired myself 50-K. Every cent I own. For a second I was up, I was killing 'em. They were serving me cocktails, and calling me sir.
Bust, bust, bust, bust, bust! Damn it! 
Dammit! Ah, God!
What? What?
What?
Things got worse ... 
I lost everything. Our entire savings. I'm sorry.
Sammy told me to stay put, and he said I should clean up the mess. He said he was going to take care of me.
I can't turn him in. And I knew I'd get blamed.
I tried to find him myself. I figured I could get him to Mexico or something. I drove around for hours. Nothing. So I went back to my office, and that's when I saw Cowboy Dan and Roger. And I knew what Sammy meant when he said he was going to take care of me. He was going to give me a clean slate. He was going to kill everyone that wronged me.
I don't want to hurt anybody.
Me and Sammy?
We used to be so tight.
And that stupid car. He always felt so guilty about dragging me into that, but it wasn't his fault. He wasn't to blame.
Yeah. It's a good thing I have the gun.

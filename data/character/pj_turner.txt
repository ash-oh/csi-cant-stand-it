I don't even know Courtney what's-her-name.
I've never been to her apartment.
What? Yo, I don't even know no dead person.
No, no, no. I didn't kill nobody.
Here's what happened -- I swear, this-- this is the truth.
I was minding my own business. I was checking out the dumpsters behind, behind the Strip, and lo and behold, I find this lady's purse.
Yeah, like pennies from heaven.
It had a wallet, it had keys, it had a cell phone. So I checked for her license, I got her address and went to her house. I was going to return the purse, I swear.
Yeah, but, when I got here, no one was there.
I used the key. I was going to leave the purse inside.
I might have taken a couple of things.
Behind the Palermo.

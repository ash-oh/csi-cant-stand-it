Sorry to keep you waiting, but, uh, commission rules, you know? Before and after a fight. Boxing and drugs don't mix, you know?
All yours.
So ... que onda? What's the crime lab want with me?
Why?
No.
Now, who do you think you're looking at -- Felix Trinidad?

All I did was out-punch Laroi. Okay, you think I wanted it to go down like this? I mean, people are going to remember me now like Ray Mancini when he killed that Korean guy. That's my legacy now. Ah, this wasn't my fault, all right? He brought it upon himself talking all that trash saying I could never beat him.  Look ... he should have never came out in the seventh round. He could barely stand up. I knew it was over right then.
Now, one word from that ref, and I would have stopped.
But he never gave the word.
Come on. Get her out of here.
Boxing is a combat sport. Sometimes fighters die, okay? That's all part of the game.
I have empacho. I take mercury for my stomach problems.
You push a man too far, there are consequences.
That's boxing.

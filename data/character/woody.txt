I'm the park's chief engineer. Been working on coasters since before I was tall enough to ride 'em.
I keep all the rides up to code.
Well, in theory, I didn't think it was possible. There's never been an accident like this anywhere.
On roller coasters? Hell yeah. Ten years of service on Six Flags'
That's a nut. It, uh ... secures the wheel to the screw.
No, no, there's, uh ... eight wheels per train. They-they'd all have to be loose, and, uh ... that just doesn't happen.
Oh, follow me. Rumor has it the park's going to shut down Pharaoh's Fever for good. You know anything about that?
Newspaper called it A Death Trap. An Accident waiting to happen.
Well, she's old and wrinkled, but I took good care of her.
Holler if you need anything.
It's got a support beam under it. 
It's just a cosmetic problem.
Well, hell, yeah. Fixed it a half dozen times this year. It's in my maintenance log. But like I said, that cross bar is supported by the metal beam.  But since my hours were cut back last November, I've had to prioritize my fix-ums. Yeah, it's really too back, but, uh, you know--
It's, uh, not technically mine.
Yeah, but it's the property of the park.
I heard you were looking for someone.
Oh, sure, it's Cleopatra. She works in food services. Second pyramid on the left.
I should have caught those loose screws. Used to check 'em every morning, but since management cut back on my hours ...
Oh, I just hope they don't blame the coaster. It may not be the Manhattan Express at New York, New York or the Desperado in Primm, but it-it ... it still makes grown men scream.
My first coaster marathon. I rode that monster for a week straight.
Uh, uh. My-my favorite's still the, um, King's Island. The Beast.
Ah. So, you prefer wood over steel?

Okay, partner ... I guess I was pretty rough on you. Maybe not rough enough. You're the best rookie I ever trained. I have to leave you now. I'll, uh, I'll talk to Tracy. Try to make her understand. Drop in on the kids. You were a good cop.
That's correct.
Didn't leave the Buick. The Caprice cut in.
Don't know. The next thing I know, we were taking fire. Forgot all about the Buick.
I was kind of busy.
We were southbound on Roosevelt. Bell observed a male and female Hispanic having a domestic dispute.
Over in that last spot.
They got out of a green Geo Metro. Walked this way. By the time we'd turned around, they'd gotten into the Buick Regal.
They were driving away. She was pregnant, about to pop, just like Bell's wife. He said we should pull 'em over.
Southbound on Roosevelt. As soon as we turned on Desert Springs, the Caprice cut us off.

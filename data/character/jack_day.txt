Excuse me, ladies? Have you seen my wife? Her-her name's Cara.
Or my little girl? I had a beautiful little girl. She was only about that big.  You ain't seen her, have you?
So they're not here?
Okay. Then, it's okay. Anywhere but here, right?
Oh, ma'am, I thought the war was hell until I came to Vegas.
No!
You don't get it. This is the best week of my life. I got to hold my baby girl.

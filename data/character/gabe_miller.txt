Yeah, that's my old number. Haven't seen that ring in a long time.
Every cent I earned playing ball went up my nose or on some dog at Las Vegas Downs. I was a real mess until I accepted Jesus Christ as my personal savior. 
Do you got a problem with that, Captain?
Well, there's no need to keep talking unless you're gonna speak your mind.
So you think I'm an addictive personality. Only now I'm into God instead of greyhounds?
When the Lord cleaned up my life, I promised him I'd always remember the man that I used to be, so I'd never be that man again. I dedicated twenty years of my life to playing football.
And I pawned my championship ring for a $50 parlay.
Okay.
I don't need trophies anymore, Captain. Good luck on your case.

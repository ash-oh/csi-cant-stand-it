Well, none of my men saw anyone suspicious enter or exit.
Our cameras only watch the money and the exits. Not rooms like these. Damn, they got the sword. Most expensive piece in the collection. This is all Mr. Caulfield needs right now.
9/11, the depressed Asian economy, Indian gaming in California. Every casino on the strip's taken a hit.
Your officers didn't say anything about detaining Mr. Caulfield's guests.
Yeah.
No, not quite. At Mr. Yamamoto's request, the collection's been moved to Mr. Caulfield's office vault. He was pretty upset. He's on his way here now from Tokyo.
Mr. Caulfield's vault is off limits.
You're in luck there. Our hotel registrar took polaroids of the collection when she logged it in.
Well, Miss Green is on vacation, but, uh, I can try and contact her.
Yamamoto carried his own insurance. 
Our hotel registrar just documents the condition of each piece. We extended Mr. Yamamoto every courtesy, but weren't going to assume responsibility. This is a Casino, not a museum.
So Brandon Miller never made it to the hospital, huh? Concussion, my happy ass.
Well, your timing's perfect. Mr. Yamamoto just arrived. Mr. Caulfield's with him right now.
Mr. Caulfield.
You asked to be kept up to date on our progress.
Yes, sir.

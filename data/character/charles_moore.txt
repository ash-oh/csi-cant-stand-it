My grandson won't take my calls. He'll only talk to you.
That was a nice thing you did giving him your pager number when he went away but he should be calling me. I'm his grandfather. I deserve to know what happened.
What's my grandson looking at?
Why didn't James call me ... tell me?
There's no honor in jail.
You're all I got, James. You're everything to me, you hear?
Can I help you folks?
It-it was an accident. I saw the girl and I tried to brake but I accelerated by mistake. I get confused. I-I shouldn't have left. I was wrong.  Is she okay?
Oh, my god.
I was driving yesterday.
What's he doing here?
No.
They're going to ... from me. 
I asked James to drive with me. I don't do so good, night driving. When I hit that girl I got knocked woozy, and James switched seats and took over the wheel ... got me home.
He was worried about me, not the girl. One more moving violation and they take away my keys. I'm not saying good judgment was used but that's what happened.
Just not during school hours.
You want to look at my teeth? What kind of investigation is this?
Fine. You look at my teeth. 
Give them back when you're done.
He's a good boy. It was an accident. I make him call ... let me know where he is especially when he's out after dark.
He drove straight home and wanted me to go to the police station with him. 
I wouldn't let him turn himself in. That was my decision. Boy's going places - college -- he's got a real future.
Miss, please, now, I'm willing to serve his time.
I made him cover it up. That was my decision.
My grandson going to jail is never okay.  You stay alive in there. You hear me?
You didn't have to do that - 
... give James your number. I've seen other law enforcement people in my day ...
Yeah. Well ... she did something right.

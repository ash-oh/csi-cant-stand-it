I just don't understand why they need my clubs.
And what it's about is honor.
Do you think they're with God?
I think they're still in there.
They're waiting to fly up to heaven.
For me to say good-bye. 
Come on, Dad.
Mom had made cookies.
I hid in here.
Then there was someone at the door.
I heard him eat a cookie. Then he went out the back door. I heard some more bangs. Thought he was gone, and then he came back in through the front door, called the police.
Say good-bye, Dad.

Yeah.
There's a screen trap behind the drain. Catches everything bigger than an ice cream sprinkle.
About a month ago. Why?
Sorry, lady. Can't just close down the shop. I got customers.
Soon as that Porsche Cayenne works its way through the line ... I'll shut her off.
You're welcome.
There's no way. Photocell technology. Whole system shuts down if the cars get within three feet of each other. Believe me, in this tunnel, accidents do not happen.
How long is this crap going to take?

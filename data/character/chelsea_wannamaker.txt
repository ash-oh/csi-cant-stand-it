Hey, lady. Hey.
You want to try to eat something?
All right. I'll go get Ahren. You get dressed.
Ahren?
Ahren?
Ahren?
Ahren...
Ahren ... Ahren ...
Uh, we started out at Light and then we went to Road Runner, and from there we were at Double Down, and then Copper K, and then we ended up at Drai's.
Not meth. Glass.
We did some coke at the club, had a couple of drinks. There was this guy that gave us these, uh, these blue pills, but I had to come home and lie down.
We only do this when we're, when we're clubbing. I mean, it's just a hobby, it's not a habit. We have it under control.
Well, I don't feel safe wearing this to a club.
Well, I used to. But my gun was stolen out of my purse one night when we went out. Is there something you want to say to me?
Life's short, but it doesn't end at forty.
The thing with Ahren the other night shouldn't have happened. We were on ecstasy ... and a line got crossed.
Okay. 
All right, you come right back.
That felt so good.
Bianca came in and found us.  I wish it never would have happened.
I went into the living room and I let the two of them talk it out. Next thing I know, she announced that they were moving to Colorado, so it seemed to me like they worked it out.
So you have some lunatic stalker telephone repairman claiming that I told him to kill my daughter's boyfriends? Give me a break.
I love my daughter.
I called Tom. I asked him to scare Justin away. He was after Bianca for her money. I mean, we have to protect ourselves.
I was attracted to Ahren ... and I was just trying to keep him away from Bianca and me.

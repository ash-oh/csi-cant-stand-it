Yeah, that's right. My son was having a birthday. 
Except this time, I think maybe we should've gone to Circus Circus.
Well, we hired a clown -- squirting flower, big floppy shoes and all that -- what we got was a smackdown.
Doodles was going through his clown bit, and, uh, then this mime comes through our kitchen, which at first we thought it was part of the act.
So, uh, I jumped in and broke it up and dragged the Mime into the kitchen. I was going to call you guys ...
... But he apologized and said that, uh, there was bad blood between him and Doodles. And he gave me a hundred bucks for the damages, which I thought was a pretty stand up thing to do, so I let him go.
I did better than that. 
He, uh, told me he'd give me great rate if I ever wanted to upgrade from clowns.
The kids were really upset after the fight, so I took them out for ice cream.
My wife!
You don't understand. Merrill and I have been married nine years. We have two kids. 
I love my wife.

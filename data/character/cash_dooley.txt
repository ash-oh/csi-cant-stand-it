Hey, Cody. You all right? You okay? Get a stretcher.  Get a stretcher! 
Are you sure? 
Howdy, Cash Dooley.  And my name's about the only cash I got.
There ain't one. Too dangerous.
Sure. But you better let me do the bending.
Here.
What's this about?
No. It's private.
If you knew Cody, you'd know he'd never do anything like that.
He always let me borrow his truck.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
He ain't breathin'.

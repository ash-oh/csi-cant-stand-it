Sy said all that Bruce had was fear.
All right, Baby Bruce. Playtime's over.
I smell a smelly. 
You made a big messy in your diaper. 
You ready?
There you go. That feels so good.
Mommy's got a special treat for you. It's extra special today.
... Wonder what you are ... 
... and then, he just started acting crazy.
Yes.
What is it with you, Brucie?
What are you doing? What is wrong?
Wait, that's a bad boy.
What is it with you, Bruce?
What's wrong?
And then, he just ... jumped off the balcony.
Nobody leaves Bruce.
That I'd never see my baby again. Bruce said that he wanted a baby. That he'd take care of both of us.
He explained to me, you know, about infantilism. Said that it was in the bible. And then he made me clean him.
Five years. Five years and every week, I would ask him if I could see my baby and he kept saying, next week. Sure, Tanya, next week.
If I told you to jump off a bridge would you do it?
Fly, Brucie, fly. Show Mommy how you can fly like a birdie!
Come on, you can fly!
You can fly! 
You can fly!
You can fly, you can fly.
You can fly!

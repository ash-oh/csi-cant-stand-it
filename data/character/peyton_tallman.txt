What?
Nothing. I mean, this is my sister's place. I'm Peyton Tallman. Where's Barbara? Did something happen to her?
What?
Barbara.
Barbara, please.
Captain, how can we help?
But you can. Well, Barbara was a high regarded psychotherapist.
Well, no, it's-it's possible. She, um ... she counseled a lot of at-risk adults, um, halfway house kids, pro bono.
She helped a lot of people.
She can't say. It's doctor-patient confidentiality.
What happened to my sister was not just some isolated tragedy.
There have been four other murders, four deaths which could have been prevented had the public been warned by the people sworn to protect us. Barbara Tallman was the latest victim of a serial killer ... the LVPD has known about for months.
They call him the ‘Miniature Killer,' because he makes little models of his victims posed in the places where they die.
I'm a private person, but if this prevents just one tragedy, then it's worth it.
You should've seen Barbara when she was young. She was fierce. And fearless. She protected me. She was the smartest, the funniest, best friend I could ask for in life. The Parkinson's just robbed her of everything. She'd take medication; she'd go away. She'd get off medication. She'd become lucid again, only in agony. She wanted to die in her own home.
She said this was the perfect opportunity. She could get what she wanted, and ... everyone would blame the ‘Miniature Killer.'

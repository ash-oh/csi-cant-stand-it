Yeah.
Yeah. This place just reminds me too much of Ed.
I can't.
I'm still doing it.
Wanna get off. I ... I don't got another run in me, but I can't stop. 
This place is nice. Can I stay here, Ed?
'Cause you're gonna take care of me, right?
I tried so hard. He said I would feel again. I never wanted to feel. 
Ed saved my life.
I tried.
What if I don't want to be clean?
He was an angel. He gave me that stuff.
We all have this secret, terrible cave in our hearts, and the more we try to escape it, the deeper we drive ourselves inside of it.
Ed gave me ibogaine. 
It was like Adam and Eve taking you to the movies except the movie was your life and you were watching it and in it at the same time.
The spirits ... they protect you.
I don't need that anymore.
Just one more, and that's it.
One guy's dead. One guy's going to jail.
Go where?

Yeah, I know Jamie. He's a sweet man. He was supposed to call me. What happened to him?
Oh, I'm sorry. Why'd you contact me?
Napkin. We, uh, we met on the plane.
And, uh, there was only one blanket, so we ... shared it, and I got a little frisky, and ... anyway, there was a kid sitting two seats away, so ...
Yeah.
No. Jamie told me that he-he was flying in to party with some pals from high school in Seven Hills. Said he'd invite me over. Figured he blew me off. It-it happens. I mean ... I have a healthy self-esteem.
Yes.

Wendy just bought her wedding gown. She, uh, she would've been a beautiful bride. 
We just wrote our wedding vows last week. I just figured that she was at a friend's house -- a girlfriend's house -- for the night.
About two or three years in the line. I mean, never topless. But, uh, in her costume, she was a vision.
About a year. We met in a grief support group. I'd lost my wife.
Thank you.
Uh, she'd ... lost her twin brother.
Yeah, Walter. Did you know him?
Uh ... we were an old-fashioned couple. Neither of us believed in premarital sexual relations. I mean, that's why I fell in love with her, because of her traditional values.

That body should be up in a few minutes, Mr. Grissom.
Catherine?
There's someone waiting for you in reception.
Where's the rest of the body?
Human fat. Well ... I can tell you that the malleolus -- the ankle bone -- is completely hollowed out.
Bone marrow was reduced to ash.
Which means that the foot was burned off the body, not severed. That's consistent with your theory of spontaneous combustion.
Word gets around.
No, that's why I wore a clean coat. I'm just reporting my observations. If the foot had been severed, the marrow would still be intact.
Not yet. I want to send a scraping down to toxicology.
Excuse me. 
I want to check for any flammable compounds in the blood. Don't expect much.
The quality of the sample may have been compromised by the heat.
Yes, sir.
Erin McCarty, 20.
Cop said she's single -- she lives at home with her mother.
About six weeks.
Well, here's the reason the skin was funny.
Close. Biotone arterial. Promotes high diffusion and fast drainage in skin tissue.
Yeah. Yeah, I already ran her prints through work here. Got an I.D. right here.
I, uh, I just want to say I-I ... well, I really admire the gusto with which you approach your job.
Uh ...
Uh ... Grissom, Dr. Robbins wants to see you. Something about your skeleton.
If there's something under all this blood you'll be the first to know.
Stand-up guy.
Can you imagine getting that phone call? What a shame.
Checking liver temperature. Estimating time of death.
88.6 -- ten degrees below normal.
Well, he's not in rigor. TSD is under six hours. I'll move him as soon as you're finished.
None.
Excuse me, sir? I'm sorry to interrupt.
You're all clear for tonight.
My dad's a Colonel out at Nellis. Grissom's requested a meeting.
Mine are lined up right over there.
Allergic to cats.
Rigor mortis has passed. Lividity is fixed. Extensive marbling on her limbs. She's been dead three or four days and I need a Benadryl. Excuse me.
She drowned. 
I am aware of that. She drowned.
Desert, no desert -- I don't care. She drowned. Look, if it's any consolation she dry-drowned.
Happens in about ten percent of all cases.
When dry-drowning occurs the larynx closes involuntarily ...
... preventing air and water from entering the lungs resulting in hypoxia -- a reduced concentration of oxygen in the blood. Thus, water's kept out of the lungs -- dry-drowning.
In wet drowning, hypoxia also occurs but the larynx relaxes and water floods the lungs. Still, the question remains, how does a girl drown in the middle of the desert?
Stokes.
No sweat.
I like to put that off till the last possible moment with decomps. 
Silver, whole.  I've done a few of these. 
It looks like a pin. It's a medical implant. 
Oh, and that's a plate in the skull. The head's been rolled.
Yeah, and by the sound of things he's been dead about two months. 
You weren't here when ESD brought this in. 
Let's go to the V.I.P. room ... I'll show you what I mean. 
Remember, breathe through your mouth.
Metal plate.
... and...
Pile of bones and that's it.
Add some bacteria, a couple gases, and... voila!
I'll cremate this.
A decomp this bad can stink up the entire building ... forever. The sooner we dispose of this, the better.
Yep, she's next.
I hate it when you CSI guys get territorial.
Yes, sir. 
Nice to see you, Catherine. Well, I smell the body. Where is he?
I know you better than that.
I made a wrong turn back at the fork.
Wow, is this new?
I like it. 
You need any help?
Cool.
Brain cried uncle.
Hey.
Compound fracture of the long bones including the phalanges. Extensive laceration. 
Yeah. There might be enough to work with.
Tattoo.
Yeah, no problem.
Grissom. 
Yeah, we're all set, Dr. Robbins.
If the poison was administered orally I may know how it got into the bloodstream.
Gastric ulcer.
In a healthy, functioning stomach, ...
... mucosa lines the walls and prevents the hydrochloric acid from burning the organ itself. 
... But if H. Pylori gets in there, sends the whole system off-balance, stops the mucosa, and causes an ulcer. 
Opens a direct channel from your digestive tract straight into your bloodstream. I know a lot about stress-related ailments.
Nick. Cool enough in here for you?
Ambient here's about 65 degrees, which makes core temp drop roughly two degrees per hour. Figure he's been dead five to seven hours.
Uh, yeah. Said they found him face down, head towards the rack.
Blow came from an object roughly rectangular in shape, resulting in a depressed fracture of the parietal bone,
... with radiating linear fractures extending outward from the point of impact. 
Based on the fracture pattern, I'd say it was a single strike to the head.
First hit's free.
And, uh, take a look at this. Black plastic. Found it in the wound.
Hey. She's hot pink, like a maraschino.
Death was not the result of natural gas inhalation.
Uh, yeah. Paramedics said they found them both in here.
Yeah.
Doc, I'm not quite sure how to proceed.  First exhumation.
Okay.
Wow. She's pretty well-preserved.
... removes the blood, retards bacterial growth, and, uh, pickles the tissue.
Why?
Oh. Okay.
Petechial hemorrhaging indicates strangulation.
Yeah, lividity bears that out. She wasn't moved.
Paramedics say they didn't touch her.
Let me just finish this ... 
Ninety-eight point one.
I only see one bullet wound through the back.
Hey.
Suburbs are encroaching on the hinterlands. We'll know more after the autopsy.
Didn't have to do much of a Y. Attack did it for me.
Bled out. Trauma to her internal organs. Spleen, liver, heart they all sustained multiple mastications.
They're human.
You can see the bridgework on this impression of a premolar and an adjoining molar.
Well, I can't give you the exact age but wisdom teeth erupt between 15 and 30. And there's no evidence of a wisdom molar on this impression.
Oh, one more thing. I found an infection in the mucus overlying the large intestine. This girl suffered from the e-coli bacteria.
Or a bad burger.
Oh, yeah. Spiked temp, vomiting, lower GI problems, the works.
Yes, sir.
Hmm, can't say. But I do know that Teddy Henders died from blunt force trauma. 
And almost Catherine. 
That had to be scary, huh?
Oh.
You ready for me?
Sure.
That's Grissom's bailiwick, not mine.
Ok guys, we're clear.
Hey ... Grissom. You ever see anything like this?
Cortisone.
No, sir. 
Yeah, but supervised. No one's touched him.
My high school science teacher used to say that your small and large intestines could stretch across the Brooklyn Bridge. 
Only 25 feet combined.
I'll tuck the viscera in the bio-hazard bag.
Excuse me, I'm headed over to the hospital. Taxi driver didn't make it.
Tilt it, sir?
Okay. Uh ... 
All right, man. Um ... I'll take the shoulders, you take the feet. Okay?
You ready? On three. One, two, three, up. And now tilt. 
Come on. Up. DAVID PHILLIPS: Okay, now tilt.
Oh, god. Up more, tilt more. Now. DAVID PHILLIPS: Uh, god.
Oh, down, down, put him down. DAVID PHILLIPS: One more time.
Ready, one time. One ... two, three, up. DAVID PHILLIPS: Oh, god.
S-sir, we can't get him. Uh, his knee's bent.
What did I do?
Toe to head.
Hey, uh, Mrs. Marlene Mitchell, 32. Apparent gunshot wound to the chest. Entry, no exit. No other apparent injuries.
Oh, hey. Uh, jugular's been punctured. 
Two marks.  Possibly bite marks.
Punctures are 32 millimeters apart. That's the average distance between the eyeteeth in an adult male's mouth.
Yeah, well, what about fangs?
Wounds are deep. She bled out.
Lividity tells me she wasn't moved postmortem, so, I don't know.
Hey.
Entry wound's on the left side.
We'll retrieve it at autopsy.
Officer Clay's already been processed. We wanted to get him to his family.
Uh, yeah. They're right here.
And we also got bullets from both of them.
He didn't. Uh, two gunshot wounds to the back of the head. TOD is within the hour.
Uh, yes, sir. He's all yours.
You think a hacksaw's going to do the trick?
I was just thinking I wouldn't be caught dead in those shorts.
That's why undertakers love smother-victims.
Yeah?
I'll get these parts to Dr. Robbins. He'll start putting her back together.
I did.
Choking.
With this guy, my money's on choking.
85.5.
So, how was your run?
That's everything. 
Well, he was in a race.
Hey. Tessa Press. School I.D. was in her pocket. She's 13.
After she died, blood settled to her anterior and lividity fixed. 
Yeah.
I'll defer that question to the insects.
Given the ambient temperature and last night's rain, I'd estimate she's been out here twenty-four hours.
If you're going to drive all the way out here to dump a body, why not take another ten minutes and bury her?
X-rayed Tessa's neck. Blade appears to have perforated her fifth cervical intervertebral disc, lacerating the spinal cord. 
Type of trauma suggests we're looking at asphyxia due to diaphragmatic paralysis.
Well, we did find her outside.
No exit wounds.
Major fractures and lacerations on his hands. 
Rampart's always been lucky for me.
Maybe the killer tried to clean up.
Okay.
You already shot me down once.
Thanks.
Yeah. Sure.
Warrick?
All right, I'm not going anywhere.
Body's fully rigid. Normally, I'd say the infant's been dead for a couple of hours, but in this weather, it's possible the infant died no more than an hour ago. I'm all through, Catherine.
Hey, you ready for me?
I've had better.
Sara, take a look at this. What is that?
It's just ... disturbing. There was a big raccoon who hosted an after-school kids show when I was little. 
Linda Jones, 35, single. We're trying to track down the next-of-kin. No mystery in cause of death, though.
And then some.
We're about to find out.
I'll send the blood work down to tox.
Lining looks like some kind of latex.
It's a high-velocity round. Gives the bullet a smooth entry in and out.
Bad night.
I'm cleaning a pelvis.
Yeah, ten days ago. I thought it was Catherine's case.
It was flaky. Like the glaze on a doughnut? I sent a sample to trace.
I've been looking for the feet.
Hey, I went through his pockets. No wallet, no I.D. Uh ... just some cash and these car keys.
It's a rental.
Good. Yeah.
Yeah.
Arachnodactyly. Abnormally long fingers.
He hasn't been dead long. He's just coming out of rigor, so I'd say less than twenty-four hours.
Vic's got a contusion on his forehead. Probably from the impact.
Well, maybe he fell asleep at the wheel.
He's not wearing prosthetics and his soles are worn.
Gunshot wound to the head. Looks like it came through the windshield.
Oh, sure.
Hey. There's no I.D. on the vic. Lividity is set. Rigidity is still present. Dead no more than twenty-four hours.
His carotid artery is ripped to shreds.
Well, I didn't find a blade on the decedent.
Liver temp's 71 degrees. Given the ambient temperature, her T.O.D's roughly thirty-six to forty hours ago.
Well, his pockets are empty. There's no wallet or any other kind of ID.
Well, he's all yours.
Hey, Cath.
Her liver temp's 83 degrees. She's been dead approximately ten hours.
Oh, yeah. Grab her feet.
Defensive wounds.
Incised.
At least a dozen.
Liver temp makes T.O.D. around midnight.
Okay.
Hey.
You have any idea when I might be able to process the bodies?
Thanks.
Hey, Catherine, um, I was wondering if I ...
A what?
Well, based on lividity, I'd say around 4:00 A.M.  Laceration on the lower lip. Contusions on the neck.
Blunt-force trauma.
Maybe it was a post-mortem blow.
Kid can't be more than 12 or 13. You think he's homeless?
Sure.
Well, he's just developing rigor, so, I'd say dead no more than eight hours.
... and nobody noticed him?
Body dump.
I'm sorry I'm late. Stopped to get my waders.
No wallet.  Oh, wait a sec. 
What do you think?
Cause of death?
Gunshot. Looks like a small caliber weapon.
Look familiar?
Well, her clothes and underwear are undisturbed.
Sure.
Location of the entry wound is different.
Slug's still inside her.
Sara, do me a favor and open the window, please.
Yeah. 
Take a look at the skin coloration on both victims.  Their bodies are slightly pink.
Oh, hello. The path to the body was made by the paramedics. They pronounced and took off. ID'ed has Kevin Staniland, age 30 from Reno. I figured before I processed the body, you'd want to photograph the crop circle.
Well, it's a circle in the middle of a field. What would you call it?
Lividity is fixed.
I have an idea. 
I'll keep it to myself.
Given the circumstances, alien was not an unreasonable conclusion at the time.
I'm engaged, but thank you. Could you just check out his pants? There's grass stains on his knees.
His tighty whiteys were soaked in urine. Don't know if it's pre- or post-mortem. 
I've got to document this.
Sir?
I know. A body disappeared.
Sir, this isn't my fault.
Yes, sir.
Walk you through what?
Okay, um, I brought him into the washroom ... 
I photographed the body, took hair and fingernail cuttings, emptied his pockets, removed clothing, washed his body, tagged him. I put him into the cooler and ... 
I haven't seen him since.
What?
Sir, this really isn't my fault.
I didn't do anything.
What would you like me to do?
I don ...
Right, 'cause you never authorized a transfer.
Body snatcher?
If you wanted to steal a body, wouldn't it be a lot easier to go to a hospital or university facility?
Ah, yes-- the guy we left on the bench.
Look, I'm ... I'm really sorry I didn't get here sooner. Maybe if I had ... 
There's no ID on him.
I sure will miss him.
Do you think he suffered?
Uno ...
Well, Y not?
Look, I'm ... I'm really sorry I didn't get here sooner. Maybe if I had ... 
There's no ID on him.
I sure will miss him.
Do you think he suffered?
Uno ...
Well, Y not?
90 degrees? Given the timeline, it should be higher. That-that can't be right.
No signs of sexual assault.
Were you expecting some?
Well, maybe she was moved. Trunk of car? Tire iron?
Her-her red blotches are consistent with CDC photos of ebola.
Sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt ... barge in. I ... normally would've knocked, but the door isn't ...
Oh, uh ... paramedics just delivered it.
Got separated from Ms. Loakes when she was loaded into the ambulance.
Oh, no, no.
Sure.
Foam in her nose and mouth. It's consistent with drowning. Abrasion on her forehead is fresh. And ...  ... lividity is unfixed.
She's been dead less than two hours.
Oh, you got my message.
To meet me here. I was preparing a body for a mortuary pickup, and I noticed something.
Postmortem bruising.
Liver temp is 97.2. She's been dead less than two hours.
Ligature marks on both of her wrists. Some kind of adhesive residue, too.
Marked impression on her left cheek.
That's a nice ring. It's at least four carats. 
We've been shopping.  Lots of surgical procedures here: Artificial breasts, cheek implants ... collagen lips ... you'd be surprised how many women I get on this table with fake parts.
And it severed the femoral artery.
Why would the shooter leave the gun behind?
Hey. Sorry I'm late. Busy night.
Rigor's barely set, so not long--under four hours.
You're married? Congratulations.
Lividity is consistent with the position of the body. So it's highly unlikely.
Hirsute is an understatement. It's like he's wearing a pelt.
Liver temp's 80 degrees. Been dead around twelve hours.
Explains why he didn't take her calls. COD -- bullet to the chest.
Aw, c'mon.
Thanks, I ... have done this before.
No one's home.
Yeah, well, he's not available right now. I am trying to prep him for autopsy.
No! You may not touch or pet the decedent.
I was supposed to have him prepped hours ago. Please. Okay, you guys gotta go.
Yeah, I need you to leave.
His pupils are dilated. Lividity is consistent with body position. Looks like he bled out from a stab wound to his upper leg or pelvic area.
No, we're good. My man's all there. We're ... good.
Las Vegas Coroner's office.
I just got started, but I can be done by the time you get here.
No problem.
So just find a bull with a bloody horn, and you've got your killer.
Based on liver temp, been dead one to two hours. It looks like two shots -- to the chest, and a through-and-through to the head.
A thousand ... when I was a waiter back in college, if I had three twenties in my pocket, it was a good night.
And these ...
Well, there's a seat-belt contusion on her shoulder.
Liver temp is close to ambient.
But lividity is fixed.  And rigidity starting to pass.
Hey, Grissom.
Conditions are less than ideal. Is it okay if we just do a scoop and run?
Couldn't get an accurate reading. You want me to pull vitreous from the eye?
That much mold would suggest he was burned at least a few days ago.
I measured the pelvic bone -- sub-pubic angle's less than ninety degrees. He's male. Any suggestions on how to proceed? 
Great.
Okay.
Yeah.
Mm! He's lighter than I expected.
Well, that would explain how the killer was able to carry him up to the roof and then foist him down the chimney.
Crispy though and through. Based on the melted fibers, he was probably wearing a polyester shirt.
Oh, some sort of plastic. I found it where his shirt pocket would've been. I'm thinking maybe a credit card.
Gunshot to the chest. Liver temp is 98 degrees which is odd unless she's running a fever. It means I can't give you an accurate TOD. Sorry.
Bullet was a through-and-through. Based on lividity, the body wasn't moved.
It's okay if I roll him?
Well, no through-and-throughs. We should be able to recover some bullets from the body.
Looks like he rubbed up against something.
Shot through a Flavor Flav clock. Haven't seen one of these since high school. 
Oh. Hey, Grissom. I'm sorry to hear about the setback.
There was a vital response in the ligature marks around her ankles.
Yeah, all the significant trauma was to the back of her head. We'll know more after autopsy.
About two or three hours ago.
Just this. 
Mom was right -- always wear clean ones. Because you never know what could happen. What do you think that is?
Why am I always the guy who has to sniff the shorts?
You do it.
No.
Oh, I already went through his pockets.
Of course, I was double-gloved.
Hmm ...
That accounts for the high-velocity spatter.
Single GSW to the forehead.
Stipling makes it close range. At least he died with his boots on.
Whoa.
Well, his liver's not where it's supposed to be.
Do you think this is some kind of birth defect?
Yes. Got the liver.
Hey. Just came from the hospital.
Oh. No, no.  Traffic fatality. 
Sorry.
It's like the Red Sea in here.
No, it's blue from afar and transparent when held in hand, like any other body of water. I was just speaking figuratively.
Please, I was just waiting for you guys to clear a path. Blame the paramedics.
You know, twice as many people die each year from falling down stairs than from accidental gunfire?
Always with the silver lining.
No wallet, no ID.  80.6 degrees. He's been dead around twelve hours.
Could be.
What's this?
Hmm, looks like a money belt.
Mom was shot twice in the back. Not up-close.
Lividity suggests she hasn't been moved. Liver temp is 92 degrees, which means she's been dead four to five hours. 
Better you than me.
Grissom? 
Heard anything about Bell?
Well, there's no bullet holes in the back. That's always good.
I don't know. Officer, can you remove these handcuffs?
Yeah.
Looks like three went in.
Major artery. Fatal wound.
All of the organs seem to be in the right place.
Okay. Kidneys are ... a bit pale. Liver is light tan.
Not a lot of blood.
Dead at the scene. He bled out.
This is going to look bad.
I eat here all the time. I like the chili.
Based on liver temp, he's been dead around two hours.
Mashed potatoes.
No fingernails ... on either hand.
Look what I found in his pocket. Aunt Jackpot's Pretzels.
Sorry, got held up at the meet the future in-laws dinner.
I got a little too excited talking about work. They stopped eating.
Yes, sir.
Rigor's setting in fast. It happens when it's hot like tonight.
Oh! 
It's apparent suicide, from Sam Braun's party. Sara and Warrick's case. Gunshot to the head.
He bled out in the bag. I guess I forgot to tape them shut.
Single stab wound, just below the sternum. It feels domestic. Crime of passion? CATHERINE: Maybe?
Good point.
Blunt-force trauma on the forehead, and on the base of the skull.
She's been dead at least twelve hours.
You know, we're getting kind of backed up in here.
Got a broken fingernail.
Okay, here we are. Autopsy samples for Doe, Jane. 99-103.
To a drug dealer from ten years ago? That's kind of weak.
We got third Instar maggots. 
With this smell, she's been dead at least 48 hours.
No ID on the body.
Needle marks are sclerotic. Chronic user. Probable OD.
Maybe it's a dwarf sign. Like Pluto is, you know, a dwarf planet now.
It looks like an impact from a weapon.
Okay if I move him out?
Something ironic, I'm sure.
About four hours ago.
No exits.
She's pale. No sign of trauma. COD'll have to wait till autopsy. Sorry.
I've been through all the bedrooms. She's the last. Rebecca Mayford. Boyfriend ID'd her. Neck's clean. The other five victims' throats were transected. There are at least a dozen stab wounds to the chest and abdomen. 
Liver temp is 95.6. Been dead at least two hours, which is consistent with four of the five other victims.
You got it.
Hey. 
That's why I always do.
Found a wallet.
Got a license. Vic's name is Champ Landley.
They haven't found it yet.
He made me do it.
I'm sorry, but Happy's antigen assay came back. The anaphylaxis was a reaction to shellfish.
This is a career first.
Are you kidding me? She'll want to hear every detail. Why do you think I married her?
Bullet entered through his back.
No exit wound. There's some swelling under his lip.
Ugh, disgusting. You get mouth cancer from this.
Sure.
Two distinct lacerations -- one on the forehead, one on the back of the skull. Lividity is fixed. Decomp is pretty well developed.
Could be a couple of days to a few weeks.
Hello, Grissom.
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late. 
Yeah. Twenty-one days and counting.
There's a scrape on his left cheek.
No. Could be a redress.
Sometimes this job gets to me.
On three: one, two, three.
Two GSWs to the chest. Rigor hasn't set. Probably been dead less than four hours.
Not a lot of spatter.
Bet he's mashed up on the inside.
Oop ... Wallet.
License ... registration ... Kenneth Billings. Nevada resident. Date of birth, 11-9-52.
Photo.
Hey, guys. Busy day.
It's my second one today.  That guy got hit by a limo.
Looks like animal bites on her arms and legs.
No purse or ID.
Hey.
Sure. What's up?
Maybe. I can't say for sure. I mean, there were dead dogs and trash all over the place.
Sorry.
Sure.
I'll send samples to Tox.
Hey, Doc.
I heard your band killed last night.
My wife's second cousin. Works in the mayor's office for the budget and finance director. He was at the country club. Grooved to your moldy oldies all night.
Sorry.
What did I do?
Her name's Elizabeth Rodriguez. She and her husband Felix were honored last night by the Nevada Enterprise Association. Humanitarians of the Year. They opened that outreach center in the Alphabets. They were dancing right in front of me.
Here you go.
These are the ones I took.
Oh, sure.
Cody's little doggies are right fragrant.
Confirms it's Don Cook.
Oh, Mrs. Phillips. An extreme makeover.
I'm all over it.
I can't get the helmet off.
I found the same black powder on his clothes.
Every male in the Phillips family gets a lifetime subscription to Hux for his Bar Mitzvah. 
I guess my sons will have to settle for a Cross pen.
Puncture wound. Um ... no abrasion ring. But I can re-approximate the skin.
Maybe. Right through the temple, into the brain. Be lights out in seconds.
Guys? I-I have a dead body here.
Oh ... uh ... it had something sticky on it, so I bagged it for Trace.  But if you want, we could put it back on for the photo op.
Well, there's no wallet or ID on this one either.
There's no indication she was re-dressed. It doesn't look like sexual assault.
Maybe it's a drug thing.
No visible signs of sexual trauma ... if it's any consolation.
Rope burns on both palms.
Whoa! I ... thought this ... guy was a guy.
Full male genitalia.
Body's in full rigor. Been dead at least ten hours. Appears to be ... one, two, three gunshot wounds to the torso.
No exit wounds.
Lividity is fixed along the anterior aspect, and ... she is still in full rigor.
No panties. I'll do an SAE kit.
The horror.
The horror ...
Huh? Huh? Bra-Brando?  Brando from Apocalypse Now?
Oh. I'll get the gurney.
You really don't recognize her?
You've ever seen Chop Chop, Fizz Fizz?
Can I Lick The Spoon? 
They're classics.
You know what I loved about her? She really made you feel the terror. When she was scared for her life, I was scared, too.
That's all you've got to say?
Epiglottis? What about the pathos? I mean ... what about the humanity? This may be Weatherly's finest performance.
Oh, just watch the movie.
Based on levidity and rigor, TOD is roughly 24 hours ago. And he's got perimortem bruising on the back of the neck. And a single sharp-force injury to the forehead.
Yes, sir.
Agent Malone?
We're read to take the boy out.
Sorry, no ID.
It's the third jumper on campus this year. Maybe it's contagious.
Well, there's this. 
No sign of sexual trauma.
No sign of sexual trauma.
Look.
He's crunchy.
Frozen sweat stains. Yuck.
How long do you think he was stuck in there?
So we're just going to wait for him to thaw?
No sign of sexual trauma.
No sign of sexual trauma.
Nine, maybe ten, hours.
These coveralls are brand-new.

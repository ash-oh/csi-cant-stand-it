I'll handle this when Myles breaks for the encore. Been the kid's manager since '97.
I should be the one to tell him.
Great, Myles. The best.
No, no, no. Everything sounded great.  Listen, Myles, these are Crime Scene Investigators. Myles, uh ... there's been an accident.
No, no, no. Your mother's fine. Look, Myles, it's, uh ...
You're killing me, Jimmy. You're killing me. All night the spotlight was off. Way too hot on his face. It's too hot on me right now. They guy's not Wayne Newton, all right? Can you see it on my face, Jim? I need ... Jimmy. Thank ... I need a cast shadow on him for all the love songs.
Sorry.
Yes, I was in Amelia's room. I'm in there all the time. We're like family.
I represent one of the biggest headliners in town. Wear a lot of hats: Manager, marriage counselor, confidante. I kept Myles happy by keeping her happy.
Amelia, anything else I can get for you?
Look, sweetheart. Here's how this works. You give him his space, he sings his heart out. Honey, we all prosper. Let me set up a dinner for you two -- quiet, alone -- after the show.
Relax.
Give me an hour.
Look at me. Do I look like a threat? The reason I've succeeded in this business, I don't squat where I eat, you know what I mean?
No. Never. I don't touch it. I'm on call 24/7. Myles can pick up the phone, have me do anything, anytime. Fly to L.A., pick someone up at the airport. 
When it comes to Myles, yeah. What's this all about?
Poisoned? By who?
What do you want to do, kid?

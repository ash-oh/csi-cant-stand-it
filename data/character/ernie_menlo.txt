I'm, uh, unemployed at the moment.
Uh, no. Look, could you put the A.C. on in here or somethin'? That, or just, uh, let me go. I mean, you can't keep me in here. It's against the law.
You can't touch me.
Clean living... good karma. But either you call the cops and book me now, or I'm out of here.
Awesome. Okay, I'll take my money and go.

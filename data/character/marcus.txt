Crime Scene Investigation. Hell, I love a bloody scene ... DNA and all that. Look, you give me a serial number, I can definitely figure out who bought it.

This is the old style cylinder. Give me a second.
Yeah, man, this, uh ... serial's not showing up.
Yeah, but these old serial numbers sometimes get erased from the system. I mean, it's happened, you know?
No name popped up.
Look, man, I don't need that kind of a scene around here.
I can live with that.

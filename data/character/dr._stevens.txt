Shaken up. Horses are incredibly sensitive to change. Travel's hard on them.
Like losing a best friend. I just don't understand how this could've happened.
Okay.
High Folly is what we call a dirty mare. Prone to serious uterine infections.
Caslick stitching keeps out fluids and bacteria.
I know it sounds bad, but I promise having an acute infection is worse. And there's no greater tragedy than a champion who can't breed.
I don't know. It could be.
You'd never use a tranq gun on a horse. The impact energy would cause an immediate adrenaline response. Make the horse more agitated.
I came as soon as I got a call from the USDA.
Chronic metritis. Uterine infections. I opened up the caslicks. I tried antibiotics, saline lavage ... I guess it was too little, too late.
Well, it'd have to be critical for lori to try emergency surgery in the air.
Massive swelling ... a threat to high folly's ability to foal.

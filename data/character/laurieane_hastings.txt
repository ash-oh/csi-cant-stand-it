Cops. I have talked to enough of you already.
Is this going to let Roy McCall out of jail which is where he belongs?
McCall was always borrowing this motorcycle and Chuckie was mad at him 'cause he returned it wrecked again. He was yelling at him and out of the blue mccall pulled his gun.
Yes, I was.
I most certainly did. I was doing laundry here ...
I went to see and try to break it up.
Yes.
Couple minutes.
That's right.
No!

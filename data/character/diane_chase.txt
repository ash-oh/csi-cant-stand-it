If it was an intelligent question, I'd stop to answer it.
Everyone ... everyone. 
I want to thank your for coming. 
You know, the bible says, Love is strong as death, and as mother of the groom, a wedding is bittersweet. You are giving up as much as you are gaining. 
In some cases you are giving up ... 
Oh ... up much more. Oh. 
To hell with it. I'll wing it. 
My Adam ... he studied at Oxford. He went to Harvard School of Business. And of all the intelligent, wonderful, beautiful women he met along the way, he ended up with Jill. 
Plain, little Jill. 
There's nothing wrong with her. But what's right with her? 
I mean, even her name is boring.
I mean, do you really want to shallow our gene pool like this? 
Oh ... 
Oh, I want to thank you all so much for coming. Oh, I love you, Adam.
Thank you all for coming. I love you, Adam.
Good to see you. Hi. How are you? It's great to see you ... 
Excuse me.
You were not invited.
They teach literacy at the halfway house?
You're not here at all.
I wouldn't be so sure of that.
I know what you did. I'm going to have your husband's medical license, and I'm going to have you put away for attempted murder.
The gall of you to ask me that! You know I'm not okay, you little tart. You're all just as bad as she is.
Oh, by giving me a controlled substance? You are going down for conspiracy!

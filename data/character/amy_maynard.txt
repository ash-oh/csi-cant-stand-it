Girls' night out. We've been best friends since high school.
The Top Floor. 
Okay.
I'll take care of it.
She's in love with her baby. She wouldn't go anywhere without him.
Mark loves Lori. He would never hurt her.
I promised I would never say anything. Before the baby was born, she suspected he was cheating.  But then Joey came, and last night at the club, Lori said things were great.
There was this one guy who kept moving in on Lori.
I think his name is Brad.
She had lost some weight. It was being resized.
We stopped drinking at ten. Left about an hour later.
He didn't get the hint. 
He seemed harmless. Horny ... but harmless.
Of course. How can I help?
That would be me. Birthday gift from my father.
You want to see my car? Why?
Lori was in my car all the time, especially last week.  Mark was using hers.
It's in the lot. I'll call my father. He'll pick me up.
Yeah. We both did.
Why are you asking me all these questions?
Lori was like a sister to me. Investigate me all you want, but when you're done, you should take a look at Mark.
I know what I said. That was before she turned up dead. And I'm not saying he did it, and Lori ... she never said anything. It's just sometimes, um ... he can get rough.
One of them. I'm not proud of it.
That's why I ended it.

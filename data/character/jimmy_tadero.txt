Hey.
How you doing, kiddo?
Fine. Sit.
For the wife. Says she can't face me without it.
Counting the days till I retire. Nice job on the Logan case.
Hoo-hoo! Wild ride!
You did good.
Yeah.
On tv, yeah.
I always regretted the jury didn't give him the chair but I'll take cancer, long as he's gone.
Deathbed denial. Negotiate with god for a better seat in hell.
I looked him in the eyes fifteen years ago. He did it.
Witnesses saw him bothering her in the club that night. Uniform picks him up a block from the alley. Knife cut on his hand. Come on, Cath!
What never lies?
Guy's up a tree, dead.
Ex-wife in the bedroom, with the pool man both very alive, if you know what I mean.
You must have read the coroner's report.
Hey, Cath. What's the case of the week?
Ted.
Worst day of my life.
That's right.
Up there, around the corner of that dumpster. I figure he'd dropped it, trying to get away.
Yeah.
He was busy trying to corral Kelso. It was dark. I came back in the daylight. What's going on?
What do you want? We got the guy.
I'm going to forget you ever asked that.
He killed her.
Yes, I do.
He had a history of roughing up girls. He had a knife cut on his hand. But the D.A .... got cold feet, released him.
I helped the evidence along.
What?
You think I killed Stephanie?
You're good. You are.
Yeah, you do that. You go get a warrant.
I could have told you that. Did you compare the unknown against the club owner, Ted?
I screwed up -- you want to hear me say it? I liked Kelso. Maybe I was wrong.
So now what?
You're not serious. 
He was a scumbag. He copped to another murder.
I can get life in prison if you turn me in, do you know that? Maybe even the death penalty. Do you know that?!
I can't believe you're doing this to me. I gave you your career.
You were two steps away from turning tricks. This is the thanks I get?

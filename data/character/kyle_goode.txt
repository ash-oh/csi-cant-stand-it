Hit that ninja. On the bridge. KYLE GOODE: That's it.
Uh-huh.
I was wondering when you guys would get around to me.
My ex-partner's murdered. I got a lawsuit against him. He owes me millions. I'd like me for it.
With my son, Alex.
You're not going to believe anything I tell you. Why don't you ask him?
Come, Alex. Get off the game.
That's enough.
I got more quarters.
More like 8:00. Alex likes those breakfast sandwiches. We picked a couple up. Ate them on the way.
Sunny Side's over on Eastern. You looking for an alibi?
Come on, Alex. Let's go over to Circus Circus. They got a real arcade.
I'd like to bend you over the counter, baby.
You're going to break them. ALEX GOODE: I-I-I ... 
That's my kid.
That's his binoculars.
You know how it is. You got your kid in the car, traveling a long distance. Whatever keeps them occupied.
For what?
What geniuses?
I hated that son of a bitch. Mike Trent was a scumbag, worst of the worst. Use you up and blow right through you. I brought him in on my nickel. And he throws me out? Invests our money in clubs and kicks me out? To do what? To ride off into the sunset with my piece of sushi? And it's not just me. There's a lot guys out there got burned by him who wouldn't mind a little revenge. I'll even go so far as to say I'm not sorry he's dead, or rotting somewhere in some box. 
But I'll say this for sure: I didn't kill him.
Or his wife.
... Ten makes twenty large.
When you do it, I want to see it. I'll be up here.

Yeah?
The drive-around-all-night guy?
Pick him up near Viking and Pecos around 2:45 A.M.
Yeah.
Okay.
He didn't know where he wanted to go, but he said I should drive anyway, so I drive. 
He sees a store, he says 'stop.' Buys a beer. Then he says, 'drive, stop, cigarettes, and drive some more.' I'm all around town. Five, six hours.
Uh ... I think it was Sammy. Yeah. Yeah, that's what he said. He asked me to wait for him by this office place, but by then it was at the end of my shift. 
I told him, I got to get home to my wife. And he asked me, do I love my wife, and I told him, hey  She loves me. And he said, I was a lucky man, which I am. And he left. He gave me a big tip.
Yeah. Yeah, that's the guy.

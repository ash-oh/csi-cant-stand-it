She's fine. She's just a little shook up is all.
My wife invited her drunk friend to stay here so he could get back on his feet. Two weeks tops, she says. That was six months ago.
Jimmy, Jimmy! Please take your sweaty feet off the head pillow. They stink.
Here's a 20-- twice as much as you came with. Hit the road.
That was it. I feared for my wife and my baby. Let's put the baby to bed.
Why are you doing that?
No, why?
No, why would I do that?
Sure.
I tripped over a rattle.
Then clear me. I already told you everything.
I've got a gun.
Call 911.
I must've tied the laces wrong. I'm sorry, I ... I know I should've told you earlier but ... I was nervous. I mean ... I took a man's life here. You don't believe me, do you?
How can I help you?
Come again?
A warrant? What? Am I a suspect? I already gave you a sworn statement.
Well, I'd love to help you, but I already cut them.
I flushed them down the toilet.
Open the door ...
Don't ask questions. Just open the door.
Call 911.
Do it!
Leave it alone. We're already late.
You look great.
Sorry we're late.

Some night, huh?
Uh, yeah.
He had a personal item.
You can't bring anything in group except a beverage. It distracts the other patients.
A photograph.
A little boy.
I followed protocol.
Anybody else have anything they want to talk about?
Hey, hey, hey. Hang on, hang on. Robbie? Wh-What have you got there?
Well, what's the rule? 
There's no personal items in here ...
Give me the...
Give me -- 
Watch it!
Boom, boom and boom: Medication, seclusion, restraint.
Call it what you want -- these aren't my children.
Because crap like that happens every day here.  I should get back to the unit.
Wait! 
Adam -- 
No!
Adam! Stop!
Get a medic in here!
Where is it? Where is it?
We need help in here!
I'll be right back.
We have rules for a reason. 
You people come in here disrupting things. You're unsafe. This is your fault.
What are you suggesting?
That's ridiculous.
I gave Robbie my lipstick sometimes. Maybe he was wearing it when the whole thing ...
Well, that's your problem. 
What are you waiting for? Get him to the medical unit, stat.
rrr-bee ... 
rrr-bee... 
Tht's my Nnn-gl.
Nnn-gl...
That's my Angel.
That's my angel.
That's my angel.
Adam liked it when I brushed his hair.
I've always gone by my maiden name.
My son needed me.
You have no idea what goes on between us.
Hello.
You need to stop this.
End it with Robbie.
End it or I will.
I want you to talk about this in group today.
It's okay. You can bring it.
Hey! Robbie. What do you got there? JOANNE MCKAY: There's no personal items in group.
I didn't say anything.  Give me that. What is that, a picture?
Give me the picture.
Give me the picture.
Hang on! 
Why would my son do that?
You can't prove any of this.
Good luck getting him to testify.

I buy and sell and trade parts all the time. From all over the place. Salvage yards, swap meets, e-bay.
I don't check. Doesn't matter if they're clean or dirty, only that they work. Look, me and Chris are partners. I built the bot, he drove it. We kicked ass, made good cash. Why would I want him dead?
There was nothing weird Chris be he did stage effects for pyrotechnica. Have some pretty good tunes, you know. Worth listening to.
Anyway ... when Chris is on the road he's a vapor trail. He's not a phone call kind of guy.
Yeah, sometimes. I, uh, I dabble in ambient music.
There's some pretty good samples out in the mountains, especially at night.
Oh, you don't have hobbies you go nuts. Human beings are designed to make things. It's hard-wired into our brains. We make things, we build things to make more things. 
It's what sets us apart from the other animals. Except monkeys. Primates in general, I guess.
Yeah?
Uh, I rent a space.
It was an accident.
No. Hmm?  We were in the shop.
Real late, no one else there. I'd made some changes to Smash-n-Burn's program. We were testing them out.
Smash was acting ... really flaky. Sluggish, and then ...
It just went crazy. With all that blood.  And ... Chris ... in the middle of it just lying there. I had to make it go away.
It was my fault. I was ... I was so scared.
All I could think about was my wife, and my little girl. My little girl. I didn't want to lose them. You got to believe me. It was an accident. 
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.
Maybe there's something jammed.
Oh, my god! I can't turn it off!
Chris! Chris!
It was an accident. The bot just ... oh, my god! Oh, we've got to call the cops!
I didn't do it.

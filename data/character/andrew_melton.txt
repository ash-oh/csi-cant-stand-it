Why don't you, uh, you wait for me here, okay?
I married, uh, June about a year after Svetlana left.
It was about two years ago. She didn't come home one night. Next thing I know, the cops are knocking down my door. I thought something happened to her, but they were there to arrest me. For hitting her.
We were married for three years. I never hit her.
I don't know.
After that, I ... I was done. I went looking for her to sign the divorce papers, but ... it was like she fell off the face of the earth.
Look, I took out ads in the newspaper every day for a month. She never responded.
I'd been accused of abuse. How would that have looked?
She didn't have any.
Her parents died in some kind of industrial accident in Odessa.
Yeah.
Through an agency.
We were introduced through an agency.
You know what, lady? I am not gonna feel bad about my decision. I dated American women, like you. They don't want to be anyone's wife, or mother -  -- you mention the word domestic, they're done with you. It's nice to be needed ...
You know, what, you can think whatever you want.
I'm not giving you a damn thing until I read every last word.
Which I never did.
Everywhere we went, men were making love to her with their eyes, defiling her with their thoughts. It got so bad it wasn't safe to let her leave the house. But then she got lonely. Like a person I didn't recognize.
In all the good ways ...  ... and the bad.
Svetlana! 
Why would you do that? Huh? 
Is that what you want? Huh? You want me to hit you?! That you want?!
She never appreciated me.

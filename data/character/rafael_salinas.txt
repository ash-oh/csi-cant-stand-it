Leave your card, I'll send you a picture and autograph, huh?
I was seeing Carla ... until Veronica Juarez's article came out. I figured out who she was.
Then I dumped her ass. What do you think? She put down my music, my band, made it look like everyone involved in narco corridos was a drug dealer or a criminal. She lied to me.
Asi es como pagas?
Narcocorridos are entertainment. The drugs, they're an economic activity woven in the fabric of Sinaloan history. The music does nothing more than reflect that.
So does the 6:00 news. A lot of people were pissed off when she wrote that trash.
I'm saying she was a two-faced bitch who got off on our music at night, wrote about how disgusting we were during the day, when she was the one smoking, snorting, screwing everything she could find.
Listen ... I didn't kill Veronica. But she was a pocha, a traitor, and people like that aren't taken lightly in Sinaloa.
When you're inside la hacienda corona, you might as well be.

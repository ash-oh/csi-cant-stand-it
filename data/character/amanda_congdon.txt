Hey, people, Amanda Congdon from rocketboom.com with this week's creep report. If you were planning on checking out that new club, Bubbles, down near Harmon and Twain, you might want to think twice, because the corpses are really piling up down there. The body of Clayton Nash was found just two blocks away from the site of Ally Sullivan's murder, and the killer's still at large. Is this just another crime spree, or the work of one deranged maniac? Don't ask the cops. They don't have a clue. Remember, Amanda warned you.

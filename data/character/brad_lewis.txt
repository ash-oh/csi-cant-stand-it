Change your tone or I'll end this right now.
She was a new mother -- 23 years old. If she'd meant to harm her son why would she call 911?
No. That's why the police were called in. And by the time my client went home and found the chewed food on the kitchen floor it was all too late. She was branded.
As for the death of little Zachary, my client categorically denies any involvement. She's a victim of an intruder who entered her home and abducted and killed her child. Thank you all for your continued efforts to find the real killer.
What's your point?
She belongs to the club. Grass stains.
If you arrest her now ... you have 48 hours to charge her. You really want to show your hand at the arraignment?
My colleagues, Messrs. Landry and Frank are representing Steve and Tyler Anderson respectively. Although we're not co-counsel in the strictest sense we've agreed the authorities should have no more than three questions to put to our clients each. After that, we'll accept written submissions only.
This may prove cover-up. None of it proves they killed Zachary.
Estimated. It could be 8:30.
Don't give them anything.
Please. 
Mrs. Anderson.
For the record my client made this statement against legal counsel.

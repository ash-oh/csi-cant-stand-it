I got to do my job, you got to do your job. So, if this stuff isn't taken down there then we all lose. So, you just make sure that you are in touch with me ...
Yeah.
Yeah, she told me you might stop by.
That's what we do. You must have seen our work on TV. We imploded most of the old strip hotels.
It's not hard. Anybody here could show you how.
If you're implying I had anything to do with all this ... I love my wife.
These folks are from the crime lab. They're here about Marcie.
Well, let me know if I can help.
You found the end cap? That's not easy.
My father-in-law's company is the largest purchaser of end caps in Nevada. I log inventory.
It was stolen. Look, I'm the one who reported the theft. I kept the dynamite in my SUV, inside a storage magazine.
Yes.
Is that what Mr. Tobin told you? Marcie's the best thing that ever happened to me. Plus, I've got an ulcer. Do you have any idea what an affair would do to me? I work my butt off for her old man. I barely have enough time to sleep let alone Romeo some other girl. And the truth is, nothing I ever do is good enough. Tobin wouldn't even let Marcie take my name.
You're looking at the wrong guy.
Marcie handles the payroll and she has a rep for shortchanging overtime. Talk about pissing people off. Any one of those guys could have put that bomb in her car.
Because it's not her fault. She's just doing what her father tells her.
Your father ran his mouth about our personal life?
I was working.
Marcie, we talked about this. You know the pressure your father has me under.
It's not fair.
Marcie and I have had enough. That's it. Now, you have your warrant, fine. But please no more questions.

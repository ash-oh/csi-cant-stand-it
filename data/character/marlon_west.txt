Everybody thought Stacy was so ...
... special. She thought so, too. She wasn't. Stacy was a stuck-up bitch and a miserable person. I just put her out of her misery.
I killed her and I put her in the ground. That's all I've got to say.
I don't get it. What's wrong with you people? You want me to confess? Again? Fine, I will.
I already said that was okay. I killed Stacy; what else do I have to tell you?
I know I did; I was there. What's the problem?
So you think I'm too stupid to have done it. Great, join the club.
Uh-uh. I broke into the chem lab. I stole the sodium. Me. All by myself.
Stay away from Hannah. She had nothing to do with this.
Just leave her alone.
What are you guys doing here?
Kira committed suicide.
Somebody I know ends up dead and I'm automatically a suspect?
That was an accident. And I admitted I was responsible from day one.
My prints were there because I've been in there a million times. Kira and I were in a band.
Yeah, we were having s*x. 
No, we had a gig last night. We ... we got into a fight.
No, not exactly.
Kira! Kira!
Keep your hands off her!
I don't know who the guy was. I had never seen him before. After that, I just ... wandered the campus most of the night by myself.
I guess I don't.
I'm telling you, I didn't kill Kira. I've never lied to you. Not once. You just never believe me. When I'm guilty, you want me to be innocent. When I'm innocent, you want me to be guilty.
Kira, don't do this to me!
Why would Hannah want to frame me?
Hannah's always been kinda weird. But since the trial ... and after our parents died, she's started getting really weird.
Really clingy, I guess. Always wanting to hang around with me.
Yeah. But not for Hannah.
You're right. She doesn't. You want to help me teach Kira a lesson?
I asked Hannah to teach me how to make GHB, and how to get it into Kira. I just wanted to mess her up a bit. I snuck it into Kira's room a few days ago; I still had a key. Hannah must've made a copy.
Why is Hannah doing this to me?
If Hannah wants me in jail, that's where I'm going to be. There's nothing I can do about it.

Ed Burnell worked here for about a year. We're a halfway house. We provide a safe place to live. I mean, if they're going to do ibogaine, I'd rather have them do it in here than out in the street.
I wouldn't do anything to jeopardize this place, and we don't give out illegal drugs. We do a lot of good work here.
The drug doesn't promise anything. You got to earn it. If a user doesn't realize why he used in the first place, I mean, no power in the world is going to make him stop. Right here is a good case in point. 
So, you're going?
You sure that's what you want to do?
Look, I really wish you'd stay here a little longer.
You did a good job here, Mindy.
Ed got her clean. Let me show you what she looked like two months ago.
So, was it the ibogaine or the months she spent here?
I don't believe in miracles.
Look, when Ed first came here, he was an asset to the place. And then he got ... religious about it. You know, there's a reason why Mohammed kept his ass on the mountain. It was safe there. The thing about recovery is it only works for those who want it, not for those who need it.
Yeah, and he started pushing it on everyone. Sometimes he won, sometimes he lost. 
Thank you.
All right, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Pharaoh's Fever. Buckle up. Get ready to scream.
Good night.
I'm just following protocol. You find a body, call you guys.

: I don't know where she is.
Okay, I'm sorry ...
I really didn't realize that anyone was ... 
A year. The magician I used to assist for retired.
I came to talk to Zoe, and the door was open so I thought I'd snoop around a little.
'Cause we do everything. I mean, what does he do? Wave his arms around? I work my butt off for that guy. Bring this out, bring that out keep proper timing, inspect the tricks. You know, follow his lead. Zoe is the best inventor in the business. You know, she sells me just one of her tricks and I can be in business myself.
Through Zephyr. Yeah.
Yeah. It's one of her stipulations that she's the volunteer opening night.
I don't know.
Drove. My car's parked down the street.
A Ford F-150.
Sadie's my cat. She's my pet. I got her from a previous gig. Zephyr hates animals so I just keep her in my truck during the show. I let her out between shows so she can get some air and she cut her leg on the tailgate. So I sedated her. 
Can I go? I've got a lot of work to do. Tonight's a really big night. We're sold out for the first time and Zephyr's debuting a new trick.

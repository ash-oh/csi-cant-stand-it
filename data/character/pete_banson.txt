Howdy. Pete Banson. Ranch manager.
What seems to be the trouble?
Yeah, he's one of my stall muckers. Hired him about two years ago. A little slow in the head, but got the work done. And all of a sudden, he up and disappeared never heard from him since then.
No, he just mucked the stalls and went home.
Look, guys, am I in some kind of trouble here?
Enrique. He's an illegal.
Mm-hmm. That's where the cowboys toss all their unwanted gear.

Billy Rattison. Pro bronc rider.

Curly's the only one I got.

Yeah, Gina works here; she's off today, though. Probably at home.
Not since yesterday. 
This is the best picture you got?
There was a guy ... I don't know if it's him. He was on those slots when Gina came on her shift.
Guess it was his lucky day. Must've thought the jackpot gave him a shot at her. He started chatting her up.
She blew him off and left. Said she wasn't feeling well.
He cashed out and left a few minutes later.
Um ... $2,500.

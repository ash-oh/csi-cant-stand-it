He wasn't my boyfriend. I knew the guy two weeks. Why am I here?
My word against a cup, and the next five years, I'm being traded for cigarettes by my cellmate.
You're not reopening my case. What do you want?
So, this is about my dad?
Seeing your daughter turned into some ... hood rat's lesbian s*x slave can be rather emotional.
I don't know. What did he do?
How many did he get?
Who's Nick?
That's pretty funny -- you guys not being able to find something.
You know what I used to do before this? Back when I was alive? I used to grow things. Outside. I was studying horticulture. Flowers. My cellmate, Trish, gave me one for Valentine's Day. 
Want to smell it?  I hope your friend dies.
You the one?
What do you want me to say? I'm sorry?
That's it?
We're done.

Hi.
Couple days ago. 
Parole Hearing Board liked my smile.
You did.
Just checking it out.  You know how, when you came to see me, what you said about when I get out, not taking it with me? I've been thinking a lot about that. I wanted you to know.
Perfect.
Thanks for seeing me. I know you said we didn't have to do this in person.
A little too much. I just wanted to talk about his estate. Is what he did going to affect it?
I have relatives in Provo. I was going to visit them. I cleared it with my PO. You gonna tell me why a state trooper pulled over my bus and yanked me off?
Yeah.
Yeah. So ... ? 
Sylvia's handling my dad's estate.
She's the trustee. What's going on here?
And you think I have something to do with it.
Are you kidding me?
Sylvia was my dad's friend. She was helping me get back on my feet. How I felt was grateful. CSI puts me in jail for something I didn't do. Do you really think I'm going to kill somebody the minute I get out?
Not if it isn't there.
Care why I did it?
She told me my dad didn't leave me anything. He never would've done that. He loved me.
The ransom was her idea. She didn't get the money. She took it from me.

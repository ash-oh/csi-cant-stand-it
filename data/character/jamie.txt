Hey, look. Oh, $40 million. Could you imagine?
Oh, give me a $20. Hurry! I just got a premonition.
But I left my purse in the room.
Oh, my God! 
We won!
They gave us the presidential suite. Can you believe it?
Oh! Look at our view! 
Wow!
Excuse me?
So what was I this whole time, huh? Just someone to bang?
Why?
He took off. I cut him up pretty good. He probably went to the lobby to fetch some first aid.
No.
Well, if they keep a record check it for yourself. Why are you bothering me?
Can I go now?
Got me with what?
Oh, are you kidding me?
Sure.
No.
So, could I ask you a question?
All that stuff you rattled off. How'd you know about all that?

Be careful with those stitches, okay? I just put them in a couple days ago. Your mom will kill me if it scars.
Sorry about that, guys. You had some questions?
Dennis, do I have to answer that?
Well, Jude and I have a standing Sunday night appointment.
Okay, look, I have no idea what went on out there, before I got there.
Hi, Jude, it's 8:00. Where are you guys?
I called 911.
I didn't leave my name, because ... because I didn't want to explain what I was doing there.
Dennis, of course not. And Jude was discreet. He rarely sold to anybody in town. He sent most of it out of state.
What size shoe do I wear? A ten.
I was here, doing rounds.

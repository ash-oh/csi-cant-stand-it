Airport. I was coming home from the airport. It's a business trip. Caught an early flight to surprise Margo. I want your best cops on this. I contributed a lot to this community.
Around 10:30.
Midnight.
A half an hour waiting for baggage check, and half an hour to find my driver, and a half an hour to get home.
Margo's.
We don't ... or I don't. She gave him up right after we met. She was seventeen. And I didn't want any kids.
The biological father, but he was a drunk. Last we heard, the kid ran away.
Yeah. She started taking them out ever since she hit menopause.
They call it premature menopause and she was having a tough time with it. The mood swings, the brain fog, the emotional detachment. 
No. She was paying for s*x?

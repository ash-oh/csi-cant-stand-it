The TV said you were looking for information on Kaitlin Rackish.
Monday, but I've been pledging, so I haven't slept in the dorm the last couple nights. I just thought I kept missing her.
We went to the gym. Showered. Went to the dining hall. Monday's mac-n-cheese day. It's Katy's favorite. We picked up our orders at the campus copy union -- term papers. We bought sodas at the bookstore. We went to the library to study. A couple guys from Zeta Beta Theta were at the same table, so we didn't get that much done. Then she left for her 7:00 class.
Monday's, um ... Introduction to the Female Form with Professor Lewis.
He got me interested in art.

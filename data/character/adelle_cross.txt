I promoted this match, Mr. Grissom. I spent sixteen months of my life stroking fighters, managers, handlers, and kissing a whole lot of ass that never got past junior high and I resent the implication that the fight was fixed, or that Laroi Steele's death was anything other than a tragedy.
The last Steele-Molina fight.
And for show. Boxing is theater.
Boxers fight for money. The rest of it is just hype.
Yeah.
Yeah. Technically, after a fit those gloves become property of the boxing commission.
What do you think you're going to find on those gloves -- liniment? Like Sonny Liston used to blind Cassius Clay? The sport has come a long way since then.
What did you find?
Like in a thermometer?
Yeah. That's my signature. So what?
Which is what I did.
There's no way.
Not exactly. 
Look. It was a big fight. There was a lot of pressure. You've got to give the fighters a little space.
I guess not.

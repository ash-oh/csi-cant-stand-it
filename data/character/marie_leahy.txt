Who killed him? 
Do you know who killed him?
I want to know how the gang found out about Don Cook.
Uh ... a few weeks ago, at a gas station near my house, this ... uh ... this woman comes up to me and ... uh ... she knows everything about Peter. That's my ... uh ... little brother in Chicago. He's only 19. Got ten years for something he didn't do. And she said they'd get him out. And they did. Guy just confessed and my brother's set to go free.  Did that witness die because of me?
She was white ... uh ... short brown hair ... I'm sorry. I only seen her once.

I told my mom I was sleeping at Chase's house, and he told his sister we were sleeping at my house.
We just wanted to see a high school party.
Some of it.
This tastes horrible.
Jackie caught us. Made us leave. We promised to go to my house. We didn't. We went to this arcade, played a few games, and then I walked home.
He stayed there, playing the games.
He asked me to.
And after that, it gets a little fuzzy.

Yeah.
No, they just let me take off my cheerleader uniform and warm the bench.
I played 24 minutes, 12 seconds -- about my season average. I also lead the team in assists.
I didn't see what happened to Terry.
You're looking in the wrong direction. Now, we may have disliked Terry, but his own teammates ... hated him.
How would I know? I'm just a girl. Can I go now?
You're putting words in my mouth.
I don't play for the rat pack.
Okay, so I changed teams. Big deal. I wanted to win.
Terry was a stockbroker. He did really well for himself --
No. All the guys had money with him. I mean, Terry was a salesman. You listened to him talk for five minutes and your hair was on fire.
Look, it was pileup. 
Everything was a blur. 
That's ten guys with blades on. Hey, I was just looking out for myself.
Oh, god.
: I knew I shouldn't have had that shrimp salad for dinner last night. If you'll excuse me I'll get that cleaned up.
We were in the sack. Right in the middle of it. Next thing I know, he stopped ... how do I say this? He stopped ... 
Yes. Thank you. His face was flushed. He was sweating. It was all good, and then he just ... 
... he went soft and passed out. 
I was scared. I called the team doctor. The paramedics came and rushed him to the E.R.
He didn't tell me anything. Neither did the doctors. I wasn't family.
Took off. I didn't want anybody to know I'd been with him.
I was sleeping with Terry, but I was dating Tommy.
Terry was a bad boy. The kind of guy you just can't get out of your system. who's on your mind all the time. He used to drive my friends crazy. Tommy ... husband material.
I need you.
Look, we tried it out, it didn't work. We're friends. I don't want the whole world to know that I've been with Terry. Please?

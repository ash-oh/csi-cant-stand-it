I don't know any Melissa Winters.
Yeah, I was out in one. What about her?
It was a chump charge. She did a number on me.
I went to her house. Not to kill her. I wanted to see the look on her smug-ass face when she saw I knew where she lived. She wasn't there, all right?
No one was there. I busted in, thought I'd mess the place up and give her a nice welcome home. 
Yep. At least I got something out of her.

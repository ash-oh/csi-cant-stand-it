Dad ... you all right?
What's going on?
What are you in the mood for?
Last time I saw my mother, I was ... in seventh grade. She handed me my lunch and said, See you after school.
I thought that she was dead. 
Can I sit down?
And my dad.
How could he?
The bracelet was a gift.
Guess he thought I deserved it.
For taking care of everything.
Laundry, groceries, carpool for Charlie ...
My father loves me.
Oh, my god.
Yes.
No.
Oh, no. It's mine.
That's a horrible story.
What kind of a mother would do that? I'm helpful. I do what needs to be done. 
I never ask for anything!
It's not my fault. I'm innocent.
What are you doing?
No, but I'm going to have a baby!

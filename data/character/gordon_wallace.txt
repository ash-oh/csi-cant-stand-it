Jim Brass. Been a long time. 
Well, I'm working 24-7 for Joslynn Raines ...  ... while she's in town, so I was here with my crew until ten. Raced over to the airport, picked up my brother. Flew in from Florida, landed around ten-thirty. Brought him back here for the last show.
Nah, it's just, I ... I thought you were busting my chops for your boy, Jameson. Yeah, I was there, earlier this week. Joslynn wanted to buy a love potion. Despite her killer looks, the young lady is unlucky in the romance department.  You don't believe me? Let's go ask her.
Hey, Joslynn can you spare a minute for the, uh, boys in blue?
Are we done? You're going to need to ... exit out the front.
You sad old man. Is this all you have to live for?
Who's that?
Maybe I was in the neighborhood. It's not a crime to drive around Vegas. I was only in that shop once, and I got my own witness. You got nothing.
You like 'em? They're new. Threw the old ones away.
What for?
Already told you that.

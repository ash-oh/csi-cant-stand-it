I'll tell you what she's doing here-- she's cruising.
Wait, you're not listening to this? This is such a crock.
Hey, hey, I'm pressing charges! I don't care who you know!
Yeah, thanks.
Yeah, but you do know her.
Tell me about it. 
Yeah.
Yeah. Thanks, man.
That's right. Yeah.
Chief Rittle left around 5:00 A.M.  5:14 to be exact.
Yeah, he was with his wife and kid. And he had his baseball cap and sunglasses on like he always does. 
Well ... actually, I didn't.
The cover's 25 bucks each.
Four months. But I don't know anything about this murder you're talking about.
No idea.
What?
I let them use the room to make a movie, that's all.
The guy threw in another two hundred  if I had s*x with the girl. She was hot, so I figured why not? Did her and left. She was breathing fine.
I didn't want to lose my job.
Excuse me. Okay, folks. I need everyone to stay back. There's a live wire in the pool, okay? Everybody stand back.
Come on, pal. Let's take a walk.
Whoa-whoa-whoa. What the hell is that?
Come on.
All right. Keep coming.
Hi.
Like I've been telling everyone, this is a strip mall, not a casino. The feeds go off-site. My boss is bringing it right now.
No. 
Yeah, she ... uh ... she eats at the veggie place downstairs a couple times a week.
I don't know, like 7:30, maybe. That's when she usually comes.

Let me guess -- three police officers looking for respite from having to control and dominate our big, bad city?
Another happy customer. 
Now, would you prefer individual sessions or would you like to enjoy each other's submission?
You don't have to decide now. Please, make yourselves comfortable and welcome to Lady Heather's Dominion.
Never lost one of my girls.
What you see and what I feel are two different things.
It's when I don't hear screams that I start to worry.
Knowing Mona, every couple of hours. She enjoyed her work. 
Captain Brass, surely you don't think sexual contact is the only means of fulfillment.
Her last client was at 11:00. She would have left at midnight.
Would that get you excited?
Mona worked the pool house. Give me a minute, I'll have to move some clients around.
Does all this fascinate you?
And you think what goes on here is aberrant?
Every job has it's peculiar hazards. Rock stars damage their ear drums. Football players ruin their knees. In this business, it's scars. But no one who works for me has ever sustained a serious injury.
Not because she worked here that's your assumption. What happens here isn't about violence. It's about challenging preconceived notions of victorian normalcy. Bringing people's fantasies to life. Making them real and acceptable. 
It's people who don't come to places like this that I worry about. The ones who don't have an outlet. Say ... someone like yourself.
And your s*x life?
In my experience, Mr. Grissom, some men go to the theater ... some men are the theater. Either way, what I offer is a chance for submission or control, whichever's required. Sometimes a client doesn't know what he wants until I show him.
I bet he'd have enjoyed himself here.
That can't be. Mona was Dominant with her clients. 
Does that one interest you?
Anything from last night would be in here. Masks, the usual accouterment.
Not necessary. I want to help.
Go ahead, ask. How can I do this for a living?
Ten grand.
Okay, twenty.
s*x pays a lot better than death.
It's like I always tell my daughter ...
Eighteen this month; freshman at Harvard.
Oh, that's a great age.
When I thought Zoe was ready to hear it, I told her, Honey, there are a lot of things you can give a man -- your body, your time, even your heart. But the one thing you can never, ever, ever let go of is your power.
Don't take this the wrong way, but I think you've got everything it takes to make a great Dominatrix.
Well, you should. It's just about knowing yourself, being strong and not taking any crap from powerful jerks who are used to giving it all day long.
So, how do you survive?
I like a bit of civility before dark ... when all the needy little boys show up.
A DNA sample? I have several clients in law enforcement. X-X or X-Y?
Not the wife, but I have seen the husband.
It's obvious. Look at the way he's clenching her hand with both of his and leaning toward her. And see how she's twisting away presenting herself to the wealthy alpha male? She's insensitive; he insecure. That's a setup for matrimony, not passion. She wants the dominant male to choose her so she can stop being dominant.
You want to be my boss?
Oh, I'm sure of that.
I can read anyone who walks through this door and know their desires. Sometimes even before they do. Why do you think I selected china and table linens?
Or maybe I knew you'd like them. Same way I know you enjoy most of the superficial trappings of civilization.
Only because you try not to be. You spend your life uncovering what goes beneath the surface of civility and acceptable behavior. So it's a release for you to indulge in something like high tea when it seems, if only for a moment, the world really is civilized.
The most telling thing about anyone is what scares them. And I know what you fear more than anything, Mr. Grissom.
Being known. You can't accept that I might know what you really desire, because that would mean that I know you. Something, for whatever reason, you spend your entire life making sure no one else does.
More tea?

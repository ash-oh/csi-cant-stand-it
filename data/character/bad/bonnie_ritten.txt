Oh, you're going to take this, too, huh?
I come down here with a check to bail my husband out and you say to him, we're out of here? No, honey, you're out of here!
Take it easy?!
How many men do you need, huh?
I've stuck by you through the bankruptcies the flings, the lies, and I have had it, okay? So, you choose. Me or her?
It's not mine. I don't wear earrings.
Yeah. So what?
I'm not giving you anything.
No, my husband's bimbo.
Bonnie Ritten.

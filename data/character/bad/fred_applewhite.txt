Y'all here for lunch?
Victor and I were partners. We shared everything including in our house and the storage shed.
Three months ago. He found somebody else ... kicked me out.
Not everything.
Yeah. I thought, once Victor got this new guy out of his system he'd come around.
Who said I went there?
What do you think you're going to do, just paint me out of your life?
I'll tell you what I want. 
Damn it! God!
You wouldn't believe it, but I forgot to lock the shed.
Yeah.  I don't know who took it.

I need to ... uh ... make a withdrawal.
There's sufficient funds in my account.
Is that going to take long?
Is there a problem here?!
No... I'm not saying anything without my lawyer.
What?
How long is this going to take?
Paul, get me out of here, now.
Where's my car?
You don't understand. Get away from me.
Hello. 
It's for you.
What did he say? Is Amanda all right?
Amanda's my girlfriend. 
Yeah. I know, I know. My, uh, my wife doesn't know.
I, uh, I probably left a dozen messages for her and, um, she, uh, never called me back so I went over to the condo ... to the condo and, uh ... this was waiting for me on the bed. I ... uh ...
My cell phone rang; it was the kidnapper. He said, uh, he wanted a million dollars in cash by the end of the day, or he would ... he would send me the rest of her. He said if I ... talked to he cops ... 
You expect me to eat? We should be in the car, waiting by the phone.
Uh, coffee. Black.
What if somebody sees you?
What'd he say?
Yeah, I've got a son. He's a soccer freak. His life's ambition is to be Roberto Baggio.
Hey, there's a cop. There's cop. Slow down. Come on. We don't want to be pulled over. If we're seen with a cop, Amanda's dead.
That's it-- yucca.
Are you crazy?
No, wait!
The gas-and-go station, Highway 582, South of Henderson.
I don't see a phone.
Where's the phone?
Dammit. They set us up. She's dead. I knew it!
No, no, no-- no, no! He said no phone calls. They may be watch ...
Listen, please. What if it was someone you loved? What if it was your daughter?!
Amanda, hi, it's Roy. Where are you? Call me on the cell.
Amanda, I thought you'd be home all day. I wanted to swing by. Call me.
Amanda! Amanda!
Oh, god ... oh, god ...
I need to see her. Please.
Look, she ... was my life. I loved her. Please?
Ooh ... ooh ... it's my fault. If I'd only ... gotten to her sooner. If I'd only paid them sooner ...
When? Where?
I-I don't think I can face my wife right now.
All right. You can find me at the Tangiers.
When? Where?
You know, with all that money on my lap we could've driven to Mexico.
I don't know. You get so used to lying you figure, what's one more?

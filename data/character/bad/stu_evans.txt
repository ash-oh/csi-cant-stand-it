You'll like this apartment. My wife says it's the best of the lot. Now, the tenants moved out kind of quick so I don't normally show apartments before I've had a chance to look, so ... use your imagination.
I haven't seen Alison in over a month.
Renteria said she left town.
I manage the complex. I notice everything.
No. He just wrote the letter saying he was moving on. Listen, if you find him, you tell him he is not getting his deposit back, okay? The blood'll never come out.
I thought I heard some banging around. You, uh, you find my tenant?
Depends, how many walls and what for?
In every room?
You CSI's going to pay for the replastering?
Yeah, I'm still waiting for my tax rebate. I don't even have to bother the owner with this. He's not going to let you bust out these walls.
Yeah. What do you want now?
Food went rotten wanted to cover the smell.
I had rain damage. Funneled down, wrecked a five-foot area.
Yeah, me and Cliff were always fighting about the temperature. So what?
I got a plumber coming on Saturday.
In the basement. But, really, I got a plumber coming.
Yeah. Listen, you know, I got a guy on retainer. You don't have to do this.
Yeah.
Something's wrong with that. I had no choice.
She nagged me.

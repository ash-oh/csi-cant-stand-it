You're fishing, I just got out of the joint. I was never at Donna's house.
What, are you going to do? Arrest me for flushing a toilet?
Help me out here, will you?
Look, we met over the internet. We had a lot in common --
She served take-out ...
... But what do I care? It wasn't chipped beef.
Sweet and sour pork ... my favorite.
I think the sister's a piece of work. Soon as we finish eating, she shows up ... with an attitude.
First thing I learned in the joint -- when inmates are fighting, you make yourself invisible. So I got out of there.
I took fifty calls a day.
Hey -- you know, I don't usually meet girls like Donna. She was nice.
Look, I've been in the system, I know the law. I admit, I was there. So what?
You know where to find me.
I'm good, thanks.
I didn't kill her.
It wasn't my fault. 
She's dead.
Rehabilitation was working for me. But you put a guy in that position ... 
I would've landed myself right back in the joint.
Come on. Who's going to believe a guy like me?

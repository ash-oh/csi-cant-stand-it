You could say that.
I don't know. He didn't get in?
The fraternity. Pledging. I mean, it's not easy.
I think you know.
No.
But there is an initiation.
Pledges, turn and face your active chapter.
For the past ten weeks you guys have accumulated points. Some of you are way ahead. Some of you are way ... behind. 
It's time ... to get signed!
Yeah, he wanted to belong, but you know what, I questioned his chops. I think we all did.
I mean, the menu was pretty straightforward. Arms and legs: Five points. Ten points for your chest, 25 points for your butt cheeks and 100 points for your Johnson.
And Johnson ... ...your sorry ass is so far behind in points that you better get your ... Johnson ...  ... signed a couple hundred times or you're... history.
He was signing himself.
I had no choice. I had to ding him.
We didn't pledge him. He pledged us. He knew what to expect if he didn't measure up.
That's what it's all about.
Microscopic fabric? I have no idea what you're talking about. You just lost me.
No. Look, lady, I have no idea where you're going with all this but you're way off.
What about the liver?
Okay. James begged us for one more shot so, we came up with a challenge. 
Swallowing raw liver.
Oh, man. Oh, man, he's choking.
Okay. We freaked. I mean, we had a lot to lose here. We could lose our charter or get kicked out of school or even go to jail. So, me and Matt, we strung him up, and ... made it look like he'd committed suicide.
We didn't kill him. It was an accident.
Look,  ... my dad's a top defense attorney so, if charges are filed ...
It'll be manslaughter, not murder. And me and Matt wind up with community service.
Good.
Meet me upstairs, pledge. 
You're still behind in points. So this is what we're going to do. I'm going to put this down your throat you're going to swallow it and you're going to trust me to pull it back out. Okay.
All right, all right, all right, listen to me. Anything goes down my father will bail out the chapter. 
Now you're just going to follow my lead and you're going to keep your mouth shut.
Is my dad here yet?
No way, come on. That's ridiculous.

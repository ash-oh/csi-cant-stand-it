Uh, I actually haven't even seen him since last Friday. I had Wheezer tickets, and we were supposed to go, but he, uh, he blew me off. 
Yeah, he's an art student, you know. He goes off a lot, and for days sometimes.
I've been, uh, studying my ass off for this American History midterm, but, uh, feel free to have a look around.
That's not mine. I don't know what that is.
I don't know.
Yeah, he liked the scenery up there.
Okay.
My dad's not gay.
We never talked about it.
No.
He let me borrow his car all the time. We were roommates.
Yeah. So?
People in town ... they said my dad was different. But he wasn't. He was just lonely. And Ross, like, totally used that to ruin him. It was all Ross.
Because I wanted him to suffer.

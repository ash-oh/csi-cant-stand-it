Bianca, sweetie, it's Daddy. I got your message about moving to Colorado with Ahren. You can borrow the cabin, but we need to talk about this move. Call me, princess. I love you.
I don't pick fights that I can't win. I kill this one, I got five more dipsticks waiting to take his place. I'd just be pushing the rock up the hill. Besides, I was in New York yesterday.
I wanted Bianca to get a job. My biggest mistake in life? Giving my baby everything she ever wanted.
When Bianca was a teenager, they fought like cats in a sack. It's good they've been spending time together.
Well ... they're shopping, dancing ... you know, girl stuff.
Look ... there was no good reason for Chelsea to marry me back in the day. I had a little money. Nothing like what we have now. She was half my age and ten times better looking. I thought if I kept her on a long leash ... maybe she'd never stray that far.
Yeah, of course.
It's Wannamaker. She's never changed her name.
Bianca, honey, it's Daddy. I got your message about moving to Colorado with Ahren.

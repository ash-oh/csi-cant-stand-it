This is a little intense for getting my bike stolen. I already got a new one.
No. You're kidding me, right? I got jumped, man.
By two bucked-ass brothers. They were both yoked as hell. Ripped. I thought for a second they were going to kill me.
Man, it's killing me. I don't know what the hell they hit me with, but my knees was the first to go.

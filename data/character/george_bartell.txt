Yeah, I want to report a crime.
Expired ice cream. Trash for cash.
It's still good.
I wanted to give Al his piece of the action, 88 bucks. We, uh, walked into the break room, and someone was smashing up the candy machine.
Yeah. And he had a gun.
He shot Al. Then the guy hauls off and brains me. And after that, everything went black.
Yeah, I told you.
I was blindfolded, shoved into the trunk of some car and, uh, drove around for almost an hour.
It, uh, glows in the dark.
Tire iron. I felt around in the dark, and, uh, there it was.
Under the, uh, the trunk liner. I had to really twist to get at it.
Right.
I popped the trunk. 
I-I was in Pahrump. I got family out there, but nobody was home.
I'm ticklish.
Oh, man. I'm so stupid.
Bowling night.
My own cousin.
Why?

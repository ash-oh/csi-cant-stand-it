Oh, hey, happy birthday. Um, I got to go soon ... I got to go do my show. So ...
Frickin' cops won't let me go. Yeah.
Bye-bye.
Hey, it's me. Are they freaking out backstage?
What the ... ?
Uh, the bathroom.
What, do you punch a clock every time you take a leak?
I don't know anybody, okay? My publicist made me come to this thing. I guess Lo-Lois needed somebody with a pulse, so ...
I got a show to do. I've got two thousand people waiting for me right now.
I don't know how that crack pipe got in my purse, so ...
Come on ...
Come on, man. Look ... here, man. See?
Hey!
Okay, I'll admit I was outside. But ... 
It's cool. Um ... it wasn't just, uh, Lois's birthday tonight, it was also my bodyguard's birthday, and I scraped my knees giving him his present.
What do I have to do to make you believe me?

I can't believe you called. I actually got you outside of work.
I don't normally date women from work but there was ... something about you. And it definitely wasn't your perfume.
Isn't that one of your coworkers?
Is that a finger?
Only long enough to see one gnarly looking hand. Well, skeleton of a hand.
With that smell?
Hey, I'm plenty tough.
Sure.
Are you supposed to do that already?
Sara?
They told me out front I could find you ... here.
I wanted to see if you'd like to have dinner.
Now. I'm on break. 
No ... well ... not that bad.
I need to get some air.
Uh, no, you-you stay. Uh, you've got that John Doe to worry about and, uh ... well, I can always stop by another time.
Hey, Sara. 
I need to talk to you.
It's about work. When I tried to revive the victim the bra was in the way, so I repositioned it. I didn't think about it until I was at the elevator.
A little ... a little over here.
Thanks.
Sorry.

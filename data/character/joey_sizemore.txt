You want to talk about Doodles, fine. Take a look at what that skeek did to me.
Stick a mime and a clown in the same place, it's like a cobra and a mongoose.
I didn't kill him.
Look, the creep was a parasite. When he wasn't bad-mouthing me, he was horning in on my gigs. Every time I line up a job, ring-ring, Doodles calls the mom, gets her to hire him, too. That's money out of my pocket. So, yeah, I figured a little payback was in order.
I had a strip mall opening out of town.
No. I got two hookers in Pahrump who can verify.

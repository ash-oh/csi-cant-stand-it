I wasn't skipping town.
I was going camping out at Red Rock. And suddenly, these cops pull me over. They take me into custody. My car's still up there.
Funerals are expensive. I'm broke.
I figured ... let the county pick up the tab. No one was going to show up anyway. It's not like we were close.
Twice a month. Went over, made sure her bills got paid. Brought her medication. Stocked the fridge. All the stuff any good son is supposed to do.
About a month ago, she called me up -- middle of the night -- hysterical. Her precious tabby was locked inside. She couldn't remember the combo.
I didn't steal her money. She didn't have any. The only thing she owned was the house. And she left that to some damn cat sanctuary.
I'm flat broke and she gives her house to complete strangers. Can, uh ... can somebody drive me back to my car, if we're done?

I told you little punk ... airport cops to stop riding me, man.
You get out the car! All this old crime scene stuff followin' me, man.
Y'all think you're all cops? Y'all ain't cops.
Hey, hold on, man, you calling for backup? Your backup or my backup? 
Yeah, you're real cute with that gun, too.
You know what, man? I've had so many damn guns pointed at my face, I feel right at home looking at yours. 
How you know I won't shoot your man? Huh? How you know I ain't got something at my waist pointed at your man right now?
You know, hollow points'll go right through the door.
I got nothing on -
I don't need no gun for you!
I'm telling you, man, I'm ready to file a complaint right now. And that not-a-cop better be lucky I ain't suing his ass. 
Maybe I will. Look, man, I wasn't even doing nothing.
I wasn't speeding ...
Wait, hold up, h-hold up, man. Let's get this straight. I don't own a car. You can check the papers. That's my grandpa's ride.
No, I didn't. I was working, man. I deejay over at O.G. If you don't believe me, you could ask Jeni, and Rocker Jules, and GG, and Lina, and Blaze and you know, I had my first five-some that night. And there wasn't no homicides goin' down. You could believe that.
Yo, man, my grandpa was a gangster back in the day. You'd be surprised.
If I'd killed those kids ... you would never find a gun.

Well, you were wrong. My client's been through enough distress. Winston, come on.

A finding from a crime unit that blows up its own DNA lab? You really think that's going to carry a lot of weight?
So what? My client's a recovering addict. He got hooked in prison. The war on drugs works about as well on the inside as it does on the street.
There are thousands of methadone users out there.
This is harassment. We're done cooperating here.
You have a known gang member in custody and yet you persist in harassing my client.
Of my clients.

Ouch!
Oh, you were so on tonight, Cammie.
Pigeon-toed. Should have stayed on the bluebell line. BG.
Been like this ever since Lauren got her creepy new boyfriend. 
He's a musician. My mom dated a musician -- total freeloaders.
Take me with you.
Becca fell off the wagon again.
Everyone's in my room. Follow the music.
Hey, guys.

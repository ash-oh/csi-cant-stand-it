I'll be right here. Thank you.
Our company has an excellent safety record.
Look, you own an airline or a bus company -- any transport business -- accidents are inevitable.
Wait a minute. I've got a family. Sometimes they ride my buses. I don't take a chance with their lives or anybody else's. I screen all my drivers. Zero tolerance for drugs or alcohol. I keep strict maintenance records. Vehicle inspection every 45 days as required by law. You're not going to find anything criminal here.
Bolt, grade eight. Sheared. It doesn't happen.
I buy all my spare parts from reputable companies.
Brillway Bolt Company.  I just switched; they were low bid.
I'll ground the fleet.
I have a zero tolerance policy. I found marijuana in Mr. Nolan's locker. He was out of here that afternoon.
Everything from fill-ups to tune-ups the last six months.

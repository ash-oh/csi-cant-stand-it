How'd you find me?
Fin. After Cammie's grandmother. But her adoptive parents call her Annabelle.
They're pretty cool. We didn't have contact, but ... they would send Cammie a photo every year on Fin's birthday. And every year, Cammie and I would get together, have a beer, look at it. Biggest regret of my life is not marrying Cammie and raising Fin together. I wanted to, but ... she said we were too young. Maybe if we had ...
Were you with her when she died?
At least Cammie died knowing kindness.

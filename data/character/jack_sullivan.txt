Ally was out late all the time. I never worried about her.
She liked the club business. She wasn't a party girl. 
She wanted to be a VIP hostess.
Way you do that in this town is you ... get your face out there, ... 
... meet the right people, ... 
... be seen. 
I taught her to be responsible. If there was an accident, call the police. Help anyone who needed it.
I'd say to her all the time, no matter how pretty you are today, someday, all that will be gone. She knew that. 
She knew she had to treat people with respect. 
She always did the right thing; that's why I don't get it.
Whoever was in the other car ... I don't care why they left. All they had to do was call an ambulance instead of leaving her there to die.
What are you people thinking? Think I'm going to say something magical, to bring Ally back to me? I'm not talking to you people.

We sure did.
Oh, we met her at the Murado at the top of the Mediterranean.
It was like we'd known Portia all our lives.  Has that ever happened to you?
We were from back east, and we had mutual acquaintances.
She wouldn't even let us pay for a dinner.
This charity event.
Well, as far as I know she wasn't even on the guest list.
Have we done something wrong? 
What?
Is that what he told you? That's an act? It's as real as it gets.
You don't know Patrick.
You're surprised? Look at your face. You never made a mistake until you met her.
I had no choice. We were partners. You can't grift me, Chad.
On a yacht, in Greece.

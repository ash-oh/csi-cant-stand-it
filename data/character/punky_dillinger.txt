I do.
Punky Dillinger. I'm Zephyr's stagehand.
I only control the stage part.
Yeah.
At this point of the trick, I'm supposed to escort the volunteer out of the basement. Now I only turned my back for a second and she was gone.
No, that's the thing. Stage left's the only exit. I don't know.
Mm-hmm. 
Oh, hey? Hey?! Those are Zephyr's tricks in the corner. No one's allowed to go near them not even me.
You guys want more lights?
I'm not a bad magician, you know.
Okay. Truth is ... I lied.
I love magic, you know? One of the fringe benefits of my job is knowing how the tricks work. Zephyr wouldn't let anyone go near his tricks. You think I want to be a stagehand the rest of my life? I got aspirations, too, you know? So, I snooped around. Climbed inside the chamber one night and tried it out. Is that a crime?

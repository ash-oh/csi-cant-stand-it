It was the '70s, it was Las Vegas, it was the time of Mickey Dunn ... 
... the legendary organized crime figure who ran Vegas operations of extortion and racketeering by day ...
... and partied on its disco dance floors by night. Until August 1976, when federal authorities linked Dunn to the murder of a low-level mob informant. 
It was the case prosecutors were waiting for. The arrest warrant was issued, the party was over. But the legend had just begun. 
Mickey Dunn and his fabled gold Cadillac vanished that hot summer night, never to be seen again â€“ 
-- until today.
So you went fishing, your line got stuck, and you pulled this up. Do you know what this might be?

Look, if you're looking to bust my son for street-racing you can get your partner out of my backyard. I mean ... 
He doesn't know anything about that.
All right what is this all about? I mean, look, my son doesn't have to answer any more of your questions.
It's not his; it's mine. It doesn't belong to him. It's registered to me.
Well, sir ... My wife was murdered two years ago and I couldn't even get a cop to return my phone calls and now here you are in my home harassing my son. Get out. Now. Take a walk.

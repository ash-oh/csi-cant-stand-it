The fear in this neighborhood just South of Las Vegas Boulevard is almost palpable. Scott Collins, his wife and two sons were brutally murdered in their beds. 
Authorities thus far have offered no comment fueling the fears of the neighbors that a killer is on the loose.
Any truth to the rumor that a cult may have committed these crimes?
But you wouldn't rule it out?
Sheriff, can you tell me what went on inside?

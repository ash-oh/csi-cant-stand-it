Let's go over again what you found on the scene.
Anything else?
Give me another fifty yards, okay!  That includes you.
We're not through. We swept the house for booby traps. It was clean, but we still haven't done a full search yet.
Scene will still be under my authority.
We're not done yet.
Got some det cord here.
Stuff designed to be humped around by grunts. You gotta want it go off. Only one thing you need to worry about.  Ever see me running, make sure you keep up.
Don't touch a thing. Get out now.
Clear out now.

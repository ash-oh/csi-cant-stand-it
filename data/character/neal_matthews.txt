Last night, about six.
No. We had a fight, she left. It's happened before.
I don't know; what's a lot? Look, things have been a little rough for us lately. Tara's been on anti-depressants for awhile. I own my own business, so she's home most of the time. What's this all about? Where's my wife?
I want to see her.
I don't know who that is, but ... that's not my wife. That's not Tara. 
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Tara. 
How did this happen?
All day ... I've been waiting for her to get home. I was really going to make it up to her.
How does it look like she's doing? 
We can talk here.
I didn't know then.
No.
Not that I know of. Why would she? 
What's that supposed to mean?
You think you know how I feel?
Yeah. I do feel guilty. I was unable to give my wife what she needed. If she went to Morgan, that's the reason. She never handled rejection well.
Badly.
Not Tara.
Hey, buddy!
Shut up!
Whatever happened, Tara couldn't have done it on purpose. It must've been some sort of accident.
Yeah.
We were trying to have a baby. Why wouldn't I?
She always said that a woman without a child of her own wasn't a woman. We tried in vitro fertilization a half a dozen times.
Right.
I told Tara we could adopt. She wouldn't.
She wanted to have a family so bad ...
Stop talking about it like that.
No!
No, I'm ...
I want you to shut up! Just shut up!
I love my wife.
You don't know anything about her.
We were just hanging out, having a couple beers and I got a splinter.
Morgan said the tweezers were up in his bathroom.
He said it was Corinne's idea. They were just trying to help us.
You slept with my wife!
She ran. She was going to call the cops. I was just trying to stop her.
I didn't know what else to do, so I called Tara. When she came over, saw what I'd done ... She just freaked out.
I made it look like Morgan shot Corinne and then he killed himself.
This is all because of you.
She said we didn't deserve to live, neither one of us. And then she just ran out the door. I was afraid she was going to try to kill herself. All we wanted was a baby.

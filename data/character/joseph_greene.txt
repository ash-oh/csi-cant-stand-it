Teddy Deller. That's apartment 27. Is he in some kind of trouble? Hey, John.
I don't know. He's got a roommate -- Davis Mullins. Oh, yeah, they eat a tremendous amount of pizza. 
Here we are.
Anybody home?
Hello?
Come on, give me something. Somehting, something ... anything ...
That's my son. Is he okay?
Would you mind stepping away from the machine? You're st-staring over my shoulder, you're looking at me. You're jinxing me, and I'm gonna have to ... 
I had an accident a long time ago.
I'm sorry, I don't know who that person is.  I don't like to talk about my hand, okay?
It's Greene.
Do I know you?
Don't you have something better to do? Like find out who murdered those two kids in number 27.
No. The gaming commission put me in the black book.
I did not cheat. I did not cheat. I didn't have to cheat. I beat the casinos. I beat 'em, and they ganged up on me, and, uh ... that was it, they didn't want me there anymore.
Motive for what, playing the quarter slots?
Come on.
I had no idea what those two boys were doing. But I will tell you this -- I will tell you that my son is a good kid, he's a good boy.
Stop looking at my son. Stop looking at me, and start looking at Sam.
Give me your shirt. Go back to school and lay low.

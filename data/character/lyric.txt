Ain't no sunshine when she's gone... 
If I should die this very moment / I wouldn't fear / for I've never known completeness / like being here / wrapped in the warmth of you / loving every breath of you / still my heart this moment / oh, it might burst / could we stay right here / to the end of time / till the earth stops/turning? 
...Seas run dry / I've found the one / I have waited for / all this time ... 
... I'm so tired of playing / playing with this bow and arrow / going to keep my hideaway 
Water falling down / a hundred meters colored by the sun / in day-glo colors always dragging me around / through beams of light blinded by the sun ... 
... with eyes afire ...
... But I can't find my way home / still, I can't find / my way home / and... come down / off your throne / but I can't / find my way home. 
:
and up on dry land / take what you can / cuz you won't be here again / everybody out of the water ...
...Now I'm treadin' high water / to get back to you / looking for a little spot of something to cling to / there's too many bodies / there's not enough room /
...they say nobody panic / help is on its way, we're already on it / you've got to be brave / if you can fix it now then don't make us wait / man they're ain't nobody coming / back away from the gates ... 
Everybody out of the water / get up on dry land / take what you can / 'cause you won't be here again / well, I loved you then / like I love you now / that won't matter anyhow / well, this is the new frontier / everybody out of the water ...
... everybody out of the water ...

If I should die this very moment / I wouldn't fear / for I've never known completeness / like being here / wrapped in the warmth of you / loving every breath of you / still my heart this moment / oh, it might burst / could we stay right here / to the end of time / till the earth stops/turning? 
...Seas run dry / I've found the one / I have waited for / all this time ... 
... But I can't find my way home / still, I can't find / my way home / and... come down / off your throne / but I can't / find my way home.

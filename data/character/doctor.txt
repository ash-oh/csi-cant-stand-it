Let's start a line.
Kidneys, stat! DOCTOR: Go, go, go!
Here comes the liver. Ready with a basin, please. Nurse: For ... DOCTOR: Right now. DOCTOR: And here we go!
Clamp it. DOCTOR: Get it back, get it back. DOCTOR: Ready and got it. DOCTOR: Here we go.
What's this... a burn?
How'd that happen?
I'll give you a prescription for antibiotics. Let's do the last portion of your exam now, okay?
Excuse me.
Okay, lay back. Scoot back a little more. Just a little more. Very good. Take a deep breath. This won't hurt at all.
Come on, come on. Coming through.
Sit down and let me have a look. Okay, you're out. DOCTOR: Myles will move in from the second line.
Terry, will you relax? It's a weekend league, it's not the NHL.
You're not 100%.
Concussion, two cracked ribs, sprained wrist, five stitches to the forehead. It could have been a lot worse.
He needs rest. But I don't see why he can't go home relatively soon.
Now, these painkillers are the real deal, okay? Don't overdo it. Plenty of rest. No work for at least a week.
We're both scientists, Mr. Grissom, so let me tell you the science. You've got otosclerosis. Basically, this means a bony growth has begun to form around the base of the stapes. What this does is prevent the stapes from moving and passing vibrations to the inner ear effectively neutralizing sound waves.

I don't have that answer.
Yes, I am.
Skin and ink, ink and skin -- one makes the other one live. You see, that's strength ... 
... and that's superiority ...
... and that's ambition without limit. See, it's the chosen one.
Can I borrow that? Excuse me.  His name was Jimmy Maurer.
He died, didn't he? Well, his fate was inevitable. I simply gave it form.
No, it's not an angel. It's Greek mythology. Icarus. He flew too close to the sun on wings of feathers and wax.
Hubris. Is that what brought Jimmy down, as well?
How should I know?
Oh, that feels nice. Do you have something to take this off?
Good thing you caught me early in the shift.
Hey.
No.
Go ahead and put this on, okay?
Okay.
Here at the clinic, we pride ourselves a confidential relationship with our patients. This is a highly unusual request.
How many do you need?
These kids come from all over the place with stars in their eyes. While they're waiting to be discovered, they still got to pay their rent. They do a bump to turn their first trick. Next they're turning tricks to get their next bump. We do what we can. You do what you do.
Good luck.
Okay, we're back.
All right, let's call it, people. We've done what we could.

Not Peter. Petey. P-E-T-E-Y.
Good.
Those things hold a lot of dough.
I was in the guard shack. Where else would I be?
The shack's out there.
Look, I'm not supposed to leave the premises, okay?
I was gone five minutes, tops.
A little after 11:00. Grabbed a burger and came back.
In 'n' Out -- three blocks from here.
That's what I get.
Hell, yeah.
Come on, man.
Look, my boss finds out I'm leaving the site every night to get my burger on, I'm toast.
Around 11:00, this cat George -- he usually works days -- drives up and asks me where Al is.
I told him he was back here. I came back. Everything was quiet. So I ate my dinner in my shack.
Beats me. His car's still in the parking lot.
Sure.

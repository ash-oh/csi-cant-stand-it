Hey. Hey, hey, Mister. Hey, Mister, that is Tookie's scarf. That is his scarf. 
I gave it to him. That is Tookie's. Are you a Taker ... or are you a Giver, Mister?
Yeah ... and fleas can tell time.
Ow.
Now I can see what the dark looks like.
Mmm ... with all those preservatives, no, no, no. I-I don't want to be preserved, thank you very much. No. I mean, I mean ... do you know what-what relish can do to your insides, huh?
Yeah, well, you know, you should. I mean, you know because our insides -- they can kill us.
Yeah, you know, you-you have to be careful, you know 'cause what goes down, you know it's got to come out. It's got to come up. Out.
Everybody's twisted.
My-my sister didn't have a sister. Protein's good, you know? C-carbs are bad. This is bad. 
That's bad.
Yeah, I know it.
I should have stole it. Because sh-sh-she stole from me.
My life.
Get away from me!
The v-victims have victims, too. 
I-I know... you know, I know, I tried to warn her. About the in-in and-and outing and the ... and the pick-pick. And the-and the and the counting the counting and the counting. I mean, I did, I tried. That's why I tried to really, really save her. I mean, I tried to save her.
Right. She could never be, you know ... she could never be ... pretty enough. And she could never b-be ... sk-skinny enough. And sh-she could never be ... perfect enough. And sh-she could never be any-anything enough.
Mm. I mean, that's why I did, I did. I tried to stop her.
I tried to stop.
It's you! It's you! It's you! You! You!
The dead don't bleed.
No, I would need a shelter from a shelter. No, no, no. Out here, I can hunt and I can range and I can find the things that I need out here. I mean, you never know what you need until you find it.
I mean, all we are is what we try to get rid of. Fat and newspapers and loneliness and cat food cans. And there are going-away people and there are left-behind people but, you know, everybody's secrets ... everybody's secrets are the same.
My sister didn't have secrets. Her secrets had her. That... I told you I didn't ... I don't know. I mean, you know, y-y-you-you can pick through a million lives and never have one of your own.
You never know what you need until you find it. And the next thing I find it might be the thing that changes everything.
Sleep ... the most perfect sleep.

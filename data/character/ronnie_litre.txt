Husband and wife carjacking. I heard about the case. My friend and I eat at Andre's. Creepy.
Well, it's a fresh pad. Only a couple of pages missing. Let's see what she wrote on those missing pages.
Okay, we've got the blueprint and Kevin Shepherd's credit card receipt from Andre's. Okay. Now, normally, a signature wouldn't give us much.

Everything in the proper order. You know that. I got five other tests I got to run on this paper before I try to isolate prints.
Yeah. The paper's expensive. High rag count.

Positive. Chemical tag in the ink tells the tale. Then I shot the maps with 300 nanometers just to be sure.
Thought you would. I have a messenger on call.
I wanted to hold off on this matchbook until it dried out, but then I realized ...

Whatever you make of it. You've got a legal document. Two signatures -- notarized, the whole nine yards. The only thing I can tell you is your two guys used separate pens.

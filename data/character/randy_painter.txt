Tammy, my name is Randy Painter. I'm a defense attorney. The Marlowes have hired me to defend you.
Bail's been set at half a million dollars.
The prelim's tomorrow morning, 9:00 A.M.
I'm advising Adam to invoke his fifth amendment rights.
Go ahead and ask. He won't answer. 
Well, for that, you're going to need a warrant. 
This warrant is for blood ... 
... and a scalp search.
It's okay.  In that case, my client is now prepared to make a statement. Tell him, Adam.

N-no, just us. Why?
Are you sure he won't hear a click or something?
I don't know.  Yeah, yeah.
Okay. Built my own business. I can handle any kind of pressure.
Yeah.
I don't know. Um, sometime after we called 911.
No. Go ahead.
In the fridge.
I jumped out of bed and I went to her, and that's when we called 9-1-1 from the upstairs hallway.
I'll go see what I can find.
Why?
You think we had something to do with this?
My lawyer warned me that you were going to try this.  You don't have a suspect so now you're going to come after us.
You're damn right we don't!
We had a homeowner's association vote meeting. It was just five doors up from our house.

Our baby has been kidnapped. 493 Fairmark. Please hurry.
My family is done being railroaded by you people so just ask your questions, and let's go.
It was the longest night of our lives.
We did everything that we could.
We wanted to protect Robbie.  We didn't want him to grow up with the stigma of ... the boy who killed his brother.

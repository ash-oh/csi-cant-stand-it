Um ... okay. If it'll help.
Okay.
It's a lot of money, Mr. Logan. It's going to take some time.
Mr. Logan, would you like an escort to your car?
Not to our knowledge.
I'm sorry, member files are confidential.
If you read further, you'll see that it was in remission.
Not yet approved, not yet denied.
The authorization process takes ... it takes time.
We have a procedure, and we follow it.
We're not liable here. We're not responsible for Mrs. Lambert's actions.
You people seen enough? When can I put him to rest?
Hey, look, I'm sorry. You know, this is a tragedy for all of us, and his family. I just don't want the press to see him like this.
Crime scene? It's an O.D., Right? He killed himself.
Well, he was a drug user. I mean, he's been clean for a long time. A health freak, actually. It's a shock to us all.
We are just trying to be reasonable here.
Mrs. Ramsey, it is not our policy to allow clients to ... 
Now you are being unreasonable.
That's everything he got.
It's a Riviera necklace. We loaned it to a couple for the fight and they refuse to return it until we return the ring that they brought in for cleaning.
Exactly-- and they won't leave until we get this sorted out. Can you help me out here?
Thanks.
Well, you know, we're not the most modern store around.
About 24 hours.
Nothing.
Those VCRs are busted. Never got 'em fixed. You know, cutbacks. Over the register and outside works. That's all we really need. Gotta keep an eye on the employees, right?
They steal worse than the customers.
Oh, yeah, that's him. Adanto Adams. Said he wanted to play BJ in the no-limit area. So I had the cage check his credit.  Qualified for ten grand.
And I wrote him up.
They all got systems. This one was a small-time double-up type thing. Bet 100, lose; bet 200 lose. Bet four, lose. Double-up-till-you-win type thing. 
The one thing about systems in this town -- if you got one, we want you here.
Listen, you look familiar. I seen you before? You been in here?
We hired him to photograph it.
A model? Never. Nothing in the photographs should be sexier than the automobile.
It's not just a car. It's a Maserati.
Honey ... The car has been detailed three times since Howard brought it back. It's getting primed for a whale tomorrow. You're wasting your time.
I need this car. Untouched.
Yeah, it was rented to an Adam Watson. Waived insurance. Government discount.
Right. How could I forget him? He threw it in my face when I told him we were out of compacts.
I'll put you in a full-size and won't charge you for the difference.
Vehicle entered the lot at 9:31 P.M. Mr. Watson drove out nine minutes later.
The Guy worked for Homeland Security. You think maybe some terrorist blew him up?
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'm their manager. El Jefe. You want to ask my band questions, you can ask me first.
What do you want to know?
That narco-corrido was written ten years ago. It's a classic.  Surprised you haven't heard it.
Why don't you buy a CD on the way out. All right?
That's Carla. She's dead?
That's too bad.
She was a loyal fan. She knew the words to every song we did.
Mrs. Bakerset's grandson bought her a top-of-the-line chair about a year ago after her stroke.
I'm sorry, she passed away last week.
No, no, no, Bonnie hadn't left here in at least six months. Her place is right over here.
When the residents pass, their property remains in the room until their family picks it up. Her grandson said he'd swing by next week.
The woman loved to shop.
I'll see if I can get you some info on that wheelchair.
It wasn't the smell that got my attention, you know? Usually when I find a body, it's, uh ... it's very, uhm ... raunchy. 
I'll remember that for next time.
Rent is due every week.
We ask for cash, not names. 
We take who the casinos won't. Someone's got to do it.
First thing I did was call you guys. Got you on speed dial.
Most of my girls have tats.
What color?
That'd be Tammy. 
She's at the bar. Help yourself.
The room is registered to a Jeffrey Powell of Van Nuys, California.
No. The reservation was for one person. He checked in yesterday, paid with a corporate credit card. 
Sheritown Inc.
You got it.
That looks like a doll.
Well, that narrows it down to about a hundred tenants.
1106. That's Ms. Tallman's place.
No, but that's probably 'cause the rent's due. See, around here, we mostly have the kind of tenants who don't like to pay their bills much.  This is the one.
You got my authority to use deadly force.
First one's for room 810, registered to Cody Latshaw.
Second one's also to room 810. 
It's a complimentary guest key issued to Tiffany Rigdon.

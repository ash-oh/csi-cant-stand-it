You want to pick on someone?
Can I get my cart, please?

You stupid bitch!
Give me the phone, or I will slit her throat.
All right, that vehicle's a negative. Next one.
It will come to pass! It's just a matter of time. You can only lie to yourselves for so long. We pretend that we're not afraid. But when it happens and that day comes... nothing will stop the world from bleeding. Nothing!

A couple of the guys predate me. I'll ask around.
We artists covet our brushes.  That's Russian Blue Squirrel ... Japanese Synthetic ... Badger.
Anyone who's studied art would never use nylon with oils unless they were using the paint for something else. When brushes age ...

Student union sells them. Most art stores. You can get them cheaper on the internet.

We're not crazy. If you look at who has had contact, we're airline pilots, professionals, teachers, scientists. I don't know how to get the truth out, but we have to.
They've got her.
Don't make eye contact with them.
Don't.
Now say it.
I said ... say it.
You have to say it. Say it.
Excuse me.

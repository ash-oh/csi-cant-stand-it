Oh, she's not missing? She's in my world. I'm just mirroring some good cheek on top of some bad cheek.
I'll fix her forehead. 
Her chin ... what a mess.
I'm going to do a little cloning here. She actually had a really nice complexion. Perfect porcelain face.
It's a macro. What kind of hair do you want her to have? Blonde? ... like Courtney love?
Let's give her some eyes ... blue.
I know her from somewhere.
Yeah.

Hey, Harlan. Special delivery. Fresh shipment in from Nebraska.
All right, you got it, boss.
You got to sign ...
Get your freakin' hands off me, man!
Hey, I told you, you got to sign for that!
You're violating my rights! I want a lawyer!
I got called out to a pickup on Viking Circle. W-when I got there, I didn't talk to an actual person. I just found an abandoned package with some cash taped to it.
It was a hundred bucks. If you want it back, you're gonna have to ask Steve Wynn.

I know my son's friends. That's not one of them.
I'm not leaving my son alone with you. My husband wouldn't like that.
Blood? Where?
I don't know what you're talking about.
They fight a lot.
I don't know. Kids get hurt all the time. They fall down, cut themselves ... get nosebleeds.
Don't you call my son a liar.
He didn't. 
Don't you say another word, baby.
I want a lawyer.
Come on, Roger. Do we have to?

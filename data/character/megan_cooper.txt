Oh, don't break your million-dollar foot.
Hey. Stop. I told you Come on. I want to wait till prom.
Stop it!
Where is he?
We were at the game ... and I did a perfect hurkey.
It's a jump where you go ...
I keep forgetting I can't move my legs.
Mom, you're not helping.
We won. Everybody was happy. I remember being really cold. There were lights. And then ... nothing. I'm sorry.
Stop it!
Okay, considering. Oh, my parents are in the cafeteria if you want to wait.
Is that me? What am I doing?
Who took this?
Oh, come on. Obsess much?
No. Not what happened that night. 
If I did push Ryan, and he died, then that was wrong. Don't you think that I've been punished enough?

Please. Cream with some of that fake stuff.
Hey, how's the body with the bugs?
What do you have for us?
Missing since last night. Last seen at home of Richard Zeigler in - ooh -- Summerlin.
Bye.
Is everything okay? You've been quiet all night.
I don't believe this.
Yes. He's pissed off because I won't let him back into my life so he sics Child Services on me.
I never expected they were going to talk to my friends. Well, what did they ask? What did you say?
Hi. Sir, we're with the Las Vegas Crime Lab. We're here about a Paul Sorenson.
Thank you.
Sorenson is a painting.
How dumb are we?
Right on.
Why don't we dust for prints?
Oh, yeah. Inside job. 
So ... was it a disaster with Child Services?
Well, my job does take me away from my daughter. Nobody knows that better than you.
Well, not intentionally.  They just, you know, know how to ask questions.
We're working on it, sir.
How many people have access to your home -- keys and security code?
Can you get them all here? They might be able to help us with evidence.
Helix, antihelix, helix rim, tragus, antitragus.
Come on. An earprint?
Yeah, I know, I know. I'd like to see that one on appeal. Well, photograph and lift. We'll have someone to compare it to soon enough.
It's just like a fingerprint ... for your ears.
Well, there's no forced entry. Someone shut off your alarm. That tells us that we eliminate the family first before we widen our investigation.
Thank you, sir.
You're a good sport.
We got a match.
What do you think?
Jason, do you still have the painting?
Well, that would be selling stolen property and you would be arrested, no matter what your dad says.
Thank you.
Nicky, how's it going?
If only her artwork brought in this kind of dough I wouldn't need to worry about her college tuition.
Keep walking.
Okay, now I know that these are rich people and it's just a painting and nobody died, but ... this just doesn't feel finished.
I know.
Court.
Yeah.
Hey, Warrick. Are you going to tell me?
About Child Services?
Really?
I was reading up on Sorenson, and I found a site that says that 15% of all museum art is fake.
You're so right, but if this is a forgery, we've got a new crime.
So, an authentic Sorenson would be titanium-free.
Okay, so if the owner purchased this painting from a reputable auction house, they would have run a similar test to this?
This kid's in college, right? Let's check his dorm room.
Hello, Mr. Zeigler.
Yes.
We'd like to ask a favor of you Mr. Zeigler. A private viewing of the painting.
Robbery checked with your school. They actually teach classes in how to copy the Masters.
But, the other night, his little scam was interrupted.
The police are going to want to know if you're pressing charges this time.
Yeah.
Hi.
Whoa, somebody likes their job.
Ex-girlfriend, Nick?
Oh, no. What are you going to do?
Heavy pastiosity?
Grissom.  I've got something you'll want to see.
You know how you're always pushing that holy trinity stuff?
Victim, suspect, crime scene.
Right. Well, we don't have a victim. We don't have a suspect. All we have is a crime scene -- the restroom at Marty's Market with the message, I killed five women. So, I figured there had to be four others.
No. I found the four other crime scenes.
Brass ran our case through VICAP. 
I made a few calls ...
Five stall doors from five supermarket rest rooms. Five missing women, including Margaret Shorey.
Just like Marty's Market -- there was no physical evidence indicating that the women were killed there.
Interstate 15. God knows I've driven it enough times.
I'll flip you to see who drives.
Moapa.
Besides the I-15?
You two ladies done talking? It's hot out here.
Well, it's not Margaret. This one's a blonde.
Missing woman number one -- disappeared from a supermarket restroom last July.
I-15? Refrigerated?
What's his problem?
Brass got us a list of all the refrigerated trucks that made deliveries to the market yesterday. 
There's a female trucker on it.
Do yourself a favor.
I've got a kite. Can you see the women? Kill the lights.
Three times.
Caucasian female with only a high school education and left-handed.
I'll be right back.
She's not the one.
The right to keep on trucking.
Well, Ms. Hard-ass travels with her boyfriend. I bet you a lot of guys travel with their girlfriends.
No.
Eliminate all trucks that only travel in state.
Now eliminate the trucks that don't deliver to supermarkets along the I-15.
That's our guy. He delivered to all five towns -- all five supermarkets.
We got three.
Try this.
We're going to take you home.
Am I disturbing you?
Good.
Here they are.
Give him a perfect ten or your ass is out of here.
The prisoner plea. Brass told me about the video.
Wait a minute. Ecklie was the CSI on that arson. I see a bad moon rising.
Only if they're of equal rank and they're looking for trouble.
Yeah.
Hey, O'Riley, anyone put their meat hooks on this vehicle?
Still got to ask.
Just a baby. 
Tap city. Empty.
Killer was probably in the back seat waiting for him. 
Kid never stood a chance.
Maybe he was deaf.
You hungry, Nick? Got a burger. Extra lettuce.
Giants ... negative nine.
What does a kid doing walking around with a wad like that betting thirty grand on a football game? Who wrote the ticket?
So, it was found with the kid killed in your parking lot.
A runner?
Kid wasn't a day over sixteen. Isn't that illegal?
Well, does 517 have a name?
Well, you've been very helpful. Thank you.
Mrs. Hillman? Is this your son?
Mrs. Hillman? Was your son hearing-impaired? Joey was wearing a hearing aid.
I don't know.
Danny?
Well, the police will want to talk to your son Danny.
Well, that's more than a little something.
So, who was your boss then?
It's illegal to use two-way communication in the sportsbook.
You like the Lakers today?
So do I.
From a sneeze.
Mm-hmm, with the sniffles.
So what is the DNA like in mucus these days?
Thanks.
Oh, hi, David. What's up?
Detective?
Yeah, thanks. Did you call Nick?
Well, I can see why you ran.
You guys don't even know who your boss is, do you?
Danny ... do you have any idea who shot your brother?
Oh, one of you is going to win a trip, all right. Everybody clear this is voluntary?
So everyone is clear.
Yeah.
Well, if you're that confident it's not one of your guys you must know who it is.
Head back. 
Okay. You're all free to go.
Oh, these fire guys really know how to trash a crime scene.
It's not the size of the bomb. It's the overpressure in the air around it.
A perfectly symmetrical amputation. Means he was looking directly at the bomb when it went off.
Uh-huh. 
Gunpowder.
I'd love to.
Seat of the bomb is here. Victim was thrown ... three meters. His clothes are torn but not burnt, indicating a low-velocity propellant -- 6,000-
Time will tell.
Bombs explode. Weird thing is their components survive the explosion. If we can piece together this bomb, we're closer to finding who did this. So, Warrick, when you're photographing this debris can you, uh ... ?
F - P - 
Well, are his initials F.P.?
I found this near the point of origin.
Whoever did this is playing with us.
Yep.
Vacuum effect. The air is being pushed out so fast ...
... when the bomb detonates ... 
... there's a calm at the center.
Well, except for when he lost his ears.
I ran it through ATF's bomb database. No profile.
Dominic the security guard? It's too soon to tell.
Looks like a balance wheel from a clock.
We're kind of busy here, Nick.
Hey, Nick ... I'm sorry to hear about your friend.
Word travels. It was the day shift coroner.
Not yet.
Bad idea. You and Ecklie ... oil and water. Just let me get into it.
If Nick's arrested. it's not going to matter that he's cleared later.
Eyes, no hands.
Look at those ligature marks.
Raccoon eyes excoriation around the neck. She didn't give up easy.
Ecklie find the murder weapon?
Did you check for fingerprints on the body?
Half-life of fingerprints on flesh ... they're disappearing as we speak.
Then that's what you report. Evidence, Doc ...  ... all we got.
Oh, hey, uh Conrad, Grissom's in the field.
And I need to speak with you ... about Nick Stokes.
Come on. The hooker was a person. Her name was Kristy Hopkins.
Nick, I don't think that you guys should be talking.
You know what? Nick's private life ...
Okay, look, I'm going to get O'Riley to track down this Jack guy for questioning. But I am out on a limb for you here, Nick. Just don't make it harder with Ecklie, okay?
I ran priors. The guy's got an '88 conviction for sexual assaults.
It's a load of crap, and you know it.
Sheriff, you arrest Nick now you end his career.
Nothing, except my gut and ten years of experience. He didn't do this.
So give me twelve hours, access to the crime scene and evidence without filing papers on Nick.
How you doing, Greg?
Yeah. I need to see his DNA from the crime scene. You have it, right?
That's my case for the next twelve hours. Ask the Sheriff.
Smart man.
Thanks, Greg. 
When did you say this sample was frozen?
These guys are all heads-- no tails.
The sperm found in the condom was frozen at 10:15 A.M. It's all heads, no tails.
It takes about seven hours for bacteria to eat away at the tails placing the time of ejaculation at around 2:00 A.M. But Kristy's time of death was 6:00 A.M.
You could be a little more supportive.
Kristy Hopkins was strangled with this sash. 
It's fingerprint-free, but the force of the pull would have scratched off epithelials from the killer's hands, right?
And can you extract DNA from epithelials?
Jack Willman has a prior for a sexual assault so his DNA is on file.
I think that you and I should head over to the police station.
Never have I seen such a clean match. Jack Willman killed her.
Hey ... hey, I'm just doing my job. Besides, if they'd sent you to jail I'd get stuck with all your cases.
O'Riley.
Get him out of here.
How long you think it's been out here?
And long enough for the elements to have washed away any evidence.
Well, it is a leg bone, and my guess is that it didn't walk out here by itself.
You see, that way, I'm never disappointed. You know, sometimes I'm nicely surprised. So, can we call it a crime scene?
Yes, professor, I, too, took Osteology.
Well, I feel it in every one of my 206 bones that this was a murder.
So we just talked with the academy. We're getting an entire class of cadets meeting us there.
Mm-hmm.
So we'll do a grid search and we really could use your friend Teri Miller.
Well, why not? She's a forensic anthropologist -- specializes in bones -- and, hello ... all we've got is a bone.
Okay.
Oh, yeah.
Stop!
What are you doing?
I-I hope you had your Hepatitis B shot. 
Did you?
Well, do you want to suck it ... to be sure?
Flag!
So ... you thinking what I'm thinking?
Mmm ... no. I-I was thinking that we have about 100 bone fragments. We could I.D. this body before the end of the shift.
Stars and trucks?
That's the femur.
That is correct. According to the book.
Hmm. Have we hit a wall yet?
Well, he was old-- there's some calcification on the rib cartilage.
Are the bones whispering to you?
Wait a minute. This guy was chopped up. That's murder.
A mulching machine? How long do you plan on ignoring the obvious? 
A 70-year-old man found in the mountains with clear evidence he was chopped to pieces. That's a ... homicide.
Thanks for coming, Teri.
I told you I was ... calling Teri ... ... didn't I? Anyway, what were you saying about hemorrhagic tissue?
And you don't bring in one, possibly compromise the case, because you two had a relationship?
Oh ... so I guess that dopey look in your eye when she's around is just that. Here's the deal -- we're using cliff notes to put that skeleton back together in there. Teri is availing her services. You said she's the best, but, hey, if you want me to send her away ...
Right.
Really?
No way. A local dentist. 
Move over. 
Overlapping left incisors. That's the front teeth, right?
Gold fillings. Well, I know that. He's got gold fillings in
And the winner is ...
Excuse me. Um ... the person's name is Mel Bennett. We just confirmed it. We're going to meet Brass at the widow's house.
Well, do you know where he is?
Is that because she just found out he's dead or because she got caught?
Oh, I don't know. These two were good with each other. 
It takes a bad marriage to recognize a good one.
Well, not even an aspirin. 
Look at this. The tub hasn't been used in a while.
Tub's the most obvious place to cut up a body but I don't see anything down there.
Give me a swab.
We found blood in the drain.
And this saw matches the one that Brass found in Mrs. Bennett's garage?
You mean Mrs. Bennett? 
Oh, right.  Reserve judgment.
But not so strong as to make clean cuts.
Well, I'm going to go check that out. Teri ...  ... You rule.
I do. There's no evidence of blood.
Which means he was already dead.
So what does that leave us?
Leaves me with a black widow.
Disassembled him? So she admits to taking an electric saw to her husband?
There's no law saying it's okay, either.
Manageable?
Well, Mrs. Bennett ... can you afford the burial now?
It's her husband's social security checks from the last two years.
It's also a motive.
Typical Vegas wife - off'ed her old man for the money and there's nothing we can do about it.
Right. There's always a clue except we don't have a body.
I try.
Ladyfriend? Hmm. Wouldn't know anything about that.
We are.
Digoxin?
She poisoned him.
Did you kill him for his pension checks?
Because a wife's benefits are cut in half when the husband dies.
So what do you think, Jim?
So that leaves us with one choice.
Golden rule.
I don't think she did it.
See you. 
Okay, so I was wrong. It wasn't murder. 
You want to go in with me? Give her the good news?
Sure.
I'll take the shallow end.
Can I get you a towel, sir?
Turquoise and silver. Breaks down the regionality to the southwest -- maybe Arizona, New Mexico, Texas.
Hey.
419 at the Sphere, glass elevator. You're on it.
Well, groove on down to The Strip.
I was probably saying that to get you to service my needs at the time.
Oh ...
Hi.
Private club fifty grand a year just to walk through the door.
And you're house-sitting? Or you're living in?
Could you put us in touch with someone who was close to her?
Close your mouth.
Did he have a name?
Turned on by the mystery and the s*x. I've been there.
What's with the smile?
Let me guess: You're wondering why Lacey Duvall had a music box engraved to Portia Richmond.
Maybe it's as simple as they knew each other and she gave it to her.
You know, when Eddie and I were first married -- when things were kind of good? On the anniversary of the day we first met, he'd always give me a lace teddy. Well, I mean, I know it's not a music box, but ... 
Right.
March 7, 1973.
March 7, 1956. 
March 7,1986.
She wouldn't give away a gift this sentimental. 
It's not waltz of the flowers.
The seal on the door wasn't broken.
Caught in the act.
Oh, yeah.
A little late for that.
Big word.
Mm-hmm.
Let me see if Portia took her bathing suit with her. 
Here we go.
We've got a bathing suit, lingerie, jewels, wallet, bags ... I'm not so sure she's gone anywhere.
What?
Ugh. I guess now we have two cases. We've got a body without a murderer and a murder without a body.
Greg ... why don't you start the DNA profile on the tooth so that we can tell if it's Portia Richmond.
How about the toothbrush and the hairbrush that we took from her vanity?
Nothing. Hmm.
So, either she's extremely hygienic, or...
I can't believe I've been in this town twenty years and I've never seen the Liberace Museum.
I believe it.
Lovely.
Oh, yeah.
Yes, please.
Ow.
DNA heaven.
You want to take that thing off your head, Greg? It's evidence.
I wore nothing but skin.
Did you see that?
She took that fur from right under their noses.
Well, in addition to exchanging bodily fluids did you exchange gifts?
Well, according to her credit card statements Portia Richmond hasn't spent a dime since she's been in the Mediterranean.
Oh, not necessarily. Maybe she's been ... swept off her feet.
And what question is that, Nick?
Boys and girls, we've got ourselves a forgery.
Well, his name is Chad.
All right, but ... I've had them on for a week. Can't account for what's on it.
Which leaves small indentations on the blank sheet. All you do now is connect the dots, then get rid of the evidence ... but, obviously, they didn't.
Suddenly a personal shredder sounds like a mighty find investment.
Me. I thought it would be nice.
Let's. I don't think a forged signature is a slam dunk for murder.
So is this.
Right, right, and we've got a cuff link with the initials C.M. Found in the bottom of the pool along with a floating showgirl.
Exactly. I mean, you know, you can change your name. You can't change your blueprint.
The Hayneses controlled Portia Richmond's bank account including the Burn Center Account but they had to stick around for the checks to clear.
Excellent question.
Uh, Brass, cough it up. Cover Nick's, too. He had that tiramisu.
Huh. Just like with Lacey Duvall.
Uh ... who wants to tell us about Portia Richmond?
Cholesterol is found in humans, not fish. So how does a fish acquire human cholesterol?
Surely.  So, you got our assignments?
This mess? You're not serious.
And why isn't the case CSI dealing with this?
And what did the DA charge?
Well, no pressure here.
Why would my bank be asking you about my employment record?
We didn't want to sell it until the market went back up and then we were going to split the profits. I can't believe he took a second out on the house. How can he do that without my signature?
I called Eddie about the loan. I got his voicemail. The guy's like ether. You going to answer my question?
All right, here's McCall's statement. If you can believe a guy who's looking at murder. Mccall says that he returned Hastings' motorcycle to him with the front end smashed up. They were standing in Hastings' backyard...
Mccall defends himself with an automatic that was down his pants.
Mm-hmm.
So, what? McCall lied. He really said that Hastings cam at him with a screwdriver so he can plead self-defense?
All right, which box?
The evidence is lost? In a murder case?
So, we know why Franovich left. He quit before we could fire his ass. 
So, you know who the DA will blame for this?
Well, now that we've exhausted all of our options let's start over.
Hi. Laurieane Hastings? We're with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
We're simply reviewing the evidence for the preliminary hearing.
You were home.
And you saw the shooting?
How long did you say they had been arguing before you heard the first shot?
And then you went out back?
Okay, thank you. This won't take very long.
She did a fill-in back there in the garage. First, she said she saw both shots, but I just asked her and she said she heard the first shot and then came running out here.
Yeah.
Right. It took me 3.8 seconds to get out here. She didn't see any shot.
Right.
So, there's a good chance that McCall was telling the truth -- that he shot Hastings in self-defense.
Right.
Right. Let's go see McCall. No one lost him.
Can you circle the area in which the screwdriver entered your arm when Hastings attacked you? 
May I exam your client's wound?
Thanks. 
I think he's telling the truth. He's right-handed. I could tell when he took the pen.
And even if he'd tried to fool us and stabbed his right arm the entry scar would have been upward, not down.
Well, the coroner disagrees.
People don't realize just how many sets of hands a piece of evidence passes through. Losing evidence isn't about anything sneaky. It's just human error.
Yeah, tell me about it.
You get that loan canceled, and you do it now, Ed. Now! 
Well, this is progress. The shirt confirms what the coroner said: That the shots were fired back to front. Look at those entry holes.
Which happens when a gun is fired less than three feet from a victim.
McCall says that they were standing five paces apart. 
Mrs. Hastings says the exact same thing. So we have two eyewitnesses on opposite sides of the case ... saying the same thing.
Well, the DA's on my beeper. Would you, uh, explain this to him because I can't.
Figures. I just had a manicure.
Right.
Using the same firearm and ammo that McCall used in his backyard on Hastings. 
And according to Lauriane Hastings' statement he was running away. How can the second shot be closer than the first?
Can't happen when someone's facing you.
I think I know how we can figure this out. I saw this thing in my forensics catalog.
Oh, yeah. He's worth it.
Well, look at him. He's lifelike, he doesn't talk, and he's self-
Yeah. We make a mistake in our calculations we just start over.
All right. How's that?
All right.
And McCcall says that Hastings was facing him shot him in self-defense and he's got the wound ... to prove it.
Mm-hmm.
Warrick ... ?
I think maybe they were both telling the truth. 
Hey, baby.
He is?
Ed ...
Uh, I'll see you in a bit, honey. 
You set me up. Again.
Get over here.
You are so pathetic.
Just so pathetic.
Sucking up to our daughter 'cause I caught you robbing me.
No s*x is worth you, and you are not taking my daughter to a club with one of your music whores.
It was a job, Ed and it supported you, just like every job I've had including this one!
You're such a bast...!
Let go of me.
Just get him out of here.
Well ... bear with us.
I'm Hastings. I stab McCall in the right arm.
And Hastings charges again. This time he lunges at his midsection.
He shoots from two feet according to our firearms range test and the unburned powder on the victim's clothes.
The first shot is fired in self-defense. But then McCall shoots Hastings a second time. Now that shot ...
... Was not in self-defense.
We'll see you in court, Sam.
Um, well, uh, she's with my sister. Hey, thanks for helping me out there. 
I appreciate it. I ...
Robbery interruptus?
One way to beat the rap.
Can you tell us anything about the murder weapon?
Hey, Doc, you have a comb?
Gee, thanks, Nick.
That's what I'm doing although I don't think this is dirt. 
He's covered in spores. 
I think these are from a fern.
A fern plant deposits billions of spores in its lifetime. Most are just dust in the wind. In our case they're evidence. As good as fingerprints or fibers in placing a suspect at a crime scene.
Hey, you forget about the coroner?
Excuse me?
Why do I know that name?
Oh, that Melissa Marlowe. Wasn't she presumed dead?
I don't see a match.
You've got a perfect match. Wait. Is she a suspect in the homicide?
And Nick and I will cover the homicide.
He put you in the gray bar? Sounds like motive to me.
He must have really pissed you off when he turned on you.
Looks authentic. Cactus Pine Cafe, Barstow, noon today.
At a pottery store on Stansberry Street. Tammy, we've already I.D.'D your father. If you don't want to see him, I'd understand.
Well, don't be surprised by some swelling and discoloration. 
You have any other family?
I can put you in touch with a counselor if you need to talk.
Is there anything you need?
Tammy ... were you at the pottery store with your father?
There's some plant spores on your sweater. We found them on your father, too, and matched them to some ferns behind the pottery store.
I'm taking these spores into evidence. They place you at the crime scene. Is there anything you want to tell me?
Why didn't you just tell me that?
Am I interrupting?
Oh, my god.
That's Tammy Felton and we've already met.
She was kidnapped 21 years ago and may have killed the man who raised her -- possibly the same man who kidnapped her.
Hey, Nick. So what's the word on the murder weapon?
Why don't you just talk with him?
Dr. Kane, this girl was kidnapped at age four. Would she have any recollection of her prior life?
That's got to be frustrating.
Such as?
Tammy Felton needs help. She may be a suspect, but she's also a victim.
Tell me about your mother.
Tammy, if you've got nothing to hide and you want me to find out who killed your father why don't you just answer my questions?
Your parents, were they close?
Do you have any siblings?
How was your childhood? Were you a happy child? Did you have any friends?
Sure.
Tammy -- Tammy Felton.
What?
Tammy referred to her mother as Mara, now deceased.
Of course. I didn't mean ...
What were you thinking?
That woman hasn't seen her daughter in 21 years. You actually thought a glass wall would keep them apart?
I know. You're not good with people.
Hi, Tammy. We just, uh, want to look around.
Tammy, could you step outside? This officer will keep you company.
Thanks.
Yellow paint.
Well, that's affirmative for uranium.
Tammy, I need your right index finger.
Who else was there?
Tammy ...
Who was with you?
But Melissa killed Joseph Felton -- Tammy's father.
Forensic psychology is a science.
Thank you. I got a call that Melissa wanted to see me.
Am I speaking to Melissa ... or Tammy?
I'm not an attorney. There are no privileges here. Whatever you say ...
The evidence is damaging.
You have a lawyer. Why are you asking me?
I'm not an expert.
Then you shouldn't have any memories of me ... Tammy. 
There is no Melissa, is there?
I'm gone.
Guard.
Hey, come on. We're going to be late for the prelim.
What? Why?
How much did the parents lose?
Right.
Brass, it's Catherine. I need a credit card purchase report on the Marlowes. The last 24 hours. Based on what? Based on the fact that the Marlowes are blind when it comes to their daughter and would do anything for her.
Look, you're here, she's not and we know that you helped her flee the jurisdiction.
Wherever you think she is -- wherever you're planning on meeting her -- she's not there. She played you. Now, if you'll just tell us where she is, we won't file charges, right?
Think about what you're doing.
Hey.
Thanks.
I was assigned. This is my case.
Right. That's why you were assigned -- a homicide detective. What happened?
Body count?
And you're not calling this a crime scene?
O'Riley ... it's a suspect.
Hi. District Engineer?
Ah. Follow the tie. 
Is that from the rain?
Are you hiding something, or am I not worth your time?
Well, you are the District Engineer of the city, right? You're responsible for the structural safety of this building.
Catherine Willows, Las Vegas Crime Lab.
Yeah. The building fell down. Three people were crushed to death. 
Why is the wood wet?
Then what am I looking at?
Drywall. But what about this layer right here?
What, was quarter inch on sale that day?
Catherine.
Don't say, sorry just know who you're talking to.
It's noticeable now. Which District Engineer conducted the last inspection?
Then it looks bad for you.
Where's the point of origin of the collapse? 
Look, this is my crime scene. I can find it myself but that might mean lots of question to lots of people.
Then that's where I want to be.
No offense, but they work for you.
Well, so the victims' family deserves answers.
Somebody's responsible.
Well, maybe not intentionally, but if a ship sinks, the last person who checked for leaks is negligent.
Thanks for your input.
I'm going in.
Why is everybody asking me if I want to do my job?
And?
I know I have a job to do. Excuse me.
Am I almost at ground zero?
I feel like I'm crawling through a straw.
Sweet!
Are you getting this?
I'm not an entomologist, but I know one. He can tell us.
I thought this building was secure.
Nellis Air Force Base.
Anything else I should, uh be aware of?
Okay.
Okay. I'm in the laundry room ... what's left of it. You want to talk me through this?
Got it.
Yeah, it's wood, all right. 
And it looks like somebody took a sledgehammer to it.
He likes you, too. Now, tell me about him.
You assigned me the case. You already know that.
The frame's made of Douglas Fir.
I did find more than a bug. Dry rot, questionable repairs, a jittery Engineer. And check this out.
I know. Gives new meaning to home wrecker.
Translation: We're opening a political can of worms. The mayor's involved, an election's around the corner and you could've clued me in a little earlier.
Sorry. It's evidence.
I know-- wood.
Nope.
How did you get in here?
A lot of factors contributed to the collapse. I'm focusing on the human element.
Now... if a sledgehammer was taken to this column recently there'd be evidence of discoloration. The damaged part would be lighter.
Hands off.
Yeah.
Public record? And you failed to indicate the damage in your inspection report?
Tell that to the women who were crushed to death.
Proving that you're not responsible for what happened to that building.
The damaged support column buckled. Why?
Good. We're on the same page. Now, I put a section of the floor assembly in the tank. I added a dozen or so of my daughter's rubber balls two sub-woofers ...
Exactly. Because I suspect that sound vibrations may be the ultimate cause of the collapse.
No, but, uh, maybe F-16s and whatever else they're flying out of Nellis Air Force Base.
Now, I ramped up the decibels on the stereo to maximize the vibrations.
Watch the bouncing balls. 
The nails are rotating. Like screws. Righty, tighty. Lefty, loosey.
Multiply that by 50 years of flybys.
No. You point one finger there's always going to be four pointing back at you. Beetles, sabotage, dry rot and time.
Yes. 
Anything you want to say to me?
You're welcome.
Jim, dispatch said this is a kidnapping? Divorce situation?
So this could have been legitimate?
They say how come?
Check the premises?
Nice digs.
Bet they wished they hadn't today.
I'll go with you.
Oh, you're right on the golf course. That must be nice.
It's okay. It used to happen to me with my daughter if I didn't get to her right on time.
I'll get this to our guys.
Mr. and Mrs. Anderson are calling. They want to know why you refuse to release the body for burial. They said that you gave the coroner strict instructions.
Sure.
We need to refer to him as the case unfolds.
A stranger wouldn't treat a victim like that.
A wealthy family.
Beat up a 12-year-old in the school stairwell.
So what are we looking for?
Well, let's start up and work our way down.
You two were having an affair.
Because his wife got pregnant?
What? A new baby screw up the office romance?
Yeah. Well, a lot of women would understand if you went over there and ... got rid of that baby.
Steve asked her to get out from underneath the obligation of a newborn?
A wife kills her baby to get back at her husband over his affair. Come on. Any woman would go after the husband, not the baby.
Well, I don't buy it. I just don't buy it, doctor. She really loved that baby.
A guy cheats, but the wife commits murder. How come moms always end up the bad guy with you Freud types?
Is this authentic?
Ice.
Just do it.
That was quite a speech you made out there, but between you me and the water fountain ... you think that Gwen Anderson's innocent?
I still am. I'm just ... taking your temperature.
You didn't answer my question.
Go ahead, Mrs. Anderson.
But she doesn't play golf. Remember our conversation, Mrs. Anderson? It's not your game?
Did you see that?
She didn't seem like that type to me.
I'll catch you later. I want to hear that 911 tape.
Hey.
Mrs. Anderson wasn't there?
Yeah, well, it's a legitimate comment. Doesn't make her guilty of anything.
Are you familiar with the JonBenet case?
Well, the police went back, and they found an earlier call that was placed from the home to 911 and the audio tests separated out the son's voice. Now, I'm not saying that Tyler's our guy, but ... we need to check into every avenue.
In the parents' name, but did you look under Tyler's? I mean, a rich kid like that's probably got a cell phone.
Hello.
7:00 A.M.? I'll be there.
Yeah. I'll bring it all. Thanks.
Nice ... what money can buy.
All right, let's work backwards starting with the cover-up. Sometime around 11:00 P.M. the night of the kidnapping you and Mr. Anderson had a drink -- rum and cola ...
... and decided what to do with the body of Zachary.
We have yet to determine whether or not his death was accidental or intentional.
Mrs. Anderson, while your husband was writing the ransom note, you wrapped Zachary's body in a blanket that you got from the upstairs linen closet.
You then laid his body to rest near a statue on the golf course.
You put down a plastic bag from the pantry so that he'd remain dry. Evidence of genuine care and concern. 
And Mr. Anderson you put up a ladder outside the window.
You had to wait till morning to report him missing.
Guilty people do that when you corner them with evidence.
Now I know why you didn't want to hold Robbie when your husband handed him to you outside the police department. 
I'm very sorry.
Of course he didn't.
You're an average family burdened with a tragedy that put you under a microscope. That close, nobody can look good.
Oh ... god.
Yeah, considering there's only about six billion people in the world ... ah, thanks.
We want this one.
Right. 
Hey, remember about three months ago I applied to the American Academy meeting in Chicago? Well, the deadline for your approval is end of shift today.
There's important papers to be presented ...
Thank you.
Get ready to pull a double.
I count two -- where are the others?
Hey, I know this guy.
Oh, yeah. Too many dips in the chips.
Assuming Flynn was the target, and it was a hit the shooter followed Flynn ...
... in the front door ... shot the muscle first ...
... then Flynn ...
... and some poor kid minding his own business. 
The girls were last.
... four dead. One is still alive.
What do you know about Flynn?
Any bullets recovered?
Why?
Guess he got off easy.
I.D.?
Just keeps getting better. Someone notify the husband?
How far along was she?
She knew.
Need help with the measurements?
Shooting occurred around closing time. Is it customary for your employees to close up?
Grissom!
Grissom!
Grissom!
About what it's like to be deaf?
Sara told me that you spoke in sign and now you're putting plugs in your ears.
Mm-hmm. Is that why you forgot about the conference?
You missed the deadline. No Chicago for me.
This is the one meeting I needed to attend. I don't always want to be second banana. I can probably do your job. I know that I can do Ecklie's.
Make sure to submit the paperwork by the end of the day.
Well, I knew you'd forget so I upped the deadline -- gave you a buffer. Don't forget again.
Frankie Flynn.
Why don't you tell us about your CCW permit.
What kind?
Talk to me.
Bobby?
Well, what about the breach-face marks on the casings?
Hmm. 
Well, well ... looks like you got zip.
So we have no statements or physical evidence indicating it was a hit on Flynn.
Yeah ... why?
Not yet. 
Nick?
Headphones.
Ricochet. Through and through.
Flynn was closest to the door.
Me, too.
What if the shooter was here when he shot big Al?
If the shooter walked through the front door.
Erin McCarty-- the employee who was supposed to close up.
If she was headed towards the parking lot, how do you explain this ricochet?
The ricochet went out into the store.  There's no hole in the door. There's no hole in the door 'cause the door had to have been open.
He shot toward the parking lot first and then toward the front of the store.
So who was in the line of fire? What if we have it backwards? What if ... the shooting began back here ... with Erin?
The target was Erin ... the pregnant girl and the rest was damage control.
Twenty-year-old girl, living at home? She would have taken a test if she was five seconds late -- panic city.
Well, it's not immaculate conception. If the guy was Mr. Right she would have told her folks. Which means he was Mr. Wrong. Maybe Mr. Married.
You still have the pregnant girl?
Six weeks with half of someone else's DNA in her body.
You're the manager. Erin was the employee.
Maybe we do-- we all make mistakes-- but, just to be sure why don't you give us a sample of your DNA and you'll be on your way.
A bunter tool makes a unique mark.
They're identical. You came here that night ... to kill Erin.
You came in through the back. Erin was in the office.
But Alice saw so you shot her.
You thought that Erin had locked up but there was a kid drinking coffee 
... and then things got out of hand.
Is that why you brought your gun?
The carnival case. I'm taking it.
A six-year-old girl died on a ride at the carnival over on Washington. The paperwork's on your desk.
You think I overstepped?  These people come to town, they commit crimes and they leave. I just want to get there before the carnival moves on.
She's meeting me there.
Stop.
What are you doing? That bag's been used 100 times. Get her a new one.
What if it was your kid?
She gets this one.
She looks scared. No six-year-old should have to go through that.
Why don't you go find the mother and talk to her. I'll take the crime scene.
Not anymore. So you didn't know that anything was wrong until this car came out of the tunnel, right?
Seat belt's loose.
Did you check this one?
So do you strap the riders in, or do they do it themselves?
So you keep the belts loose on purpose. Loose enough for adults to get close or six-year-old kids to slide through?
Officer, give us a minute. 
You tampered with the evidence.
Spare me the hee haw routine. You run this nightmare on wheels. I found this in there. 
You sent one of your employees into that tunnel to fix the track where that little girl was killed to cover your ass?
Field test for drugs. I'm sure you've done this before.
Oh, before you came to Nevada you should have looked up the law. Mandatory drug testing wherever there's been an accident. Pee now, and don't tell me you're shy. 
Stay on him.
Yeah, well, there should be. And I don't have to wait for results to know that guy's coked out of his brain.
Oh ... crawling all under his skin.
So you did the tox screen on my carny?
Mm-hmm. So?
Great. What did he do? Try and mask it?
Oh, come on. That creep tested clean?
What?
Oldest trick in the book. Somebody else's urine. Probably keeps a stash in his trailer and that uniform was too green to look for it.
What a surprise.
Let's go.
What did you do?
If you so much as breathed on this child, the evidence will tell me. You can dope your urine change your name compare yourself to Elvis himself, but if you harmed Sandy Dantini, I'm going to get you.
No.
Pickens is a drug addict and s*x offender operating a two-ton kid magnet.
Did you take a look around that carnival?
Did you notice anything about those other rides? Ferris wheel-single cars in the open. Zipper-single cars in the open. Himalaya-group cars in the open. How come Pickens was hanging around the only ride that takes kids into the dark? 
What if he pulled that little girl out of the car?
How tall was the victim?
The water was a foot and a half deep. She could've easily climbed out, unless she was unconscious.
Spiral or straight?
Somebody twisted that little girl's arm hard enough to break it.
He's a s*x offender. He was going to take her someplace.
You read the OSHA report. How many emergency doors were operational?
He was trapped like a rat.
He did the only thing he could -- he hid the evidence.
You're going to enter this as a homicide, right?
It's a homicide. I'm going to get your proof. So write down that
I'm not a coroner. What's your daughter's name?
Oh, Mrs. Dantini. I'm Catherine Willows, from the Crime Lab. You've spoken with my colleague, Sara Sidle. I'm so sorry.
Actually, I'd like to ask you a few questions. Is it possible that someone reached into your car and pulled out your daughter?
Well, when you went in the water to try to save Sandy did you hear anything? Did you... sense that anyone was there... in the dark?
I'm not ruling anything out.
It's evidence. It's not going anywhere. Nothing is.
It's going to take a lot more than vegetable insults to get us to move.
Oh, I know exactly who you are, Mr. Pickens. And if you so much as look at me in the wrong way, I will personally lock you in a cell with someone who's going to do the same thing to you that you've been doing to those little girls.
What?
As compared to what?
I want four techs in there. Let's try to pull the girl out from every conceivable angle.
Mom was on the left. Where's my dummy? 
Forty-two pounds?
And, just like ... the loose seat belt.
The belt wasn't loose enough to yank the girl out. Forget Pickens.
Her eyes were pointing in the wrong direction.
Carla Dantini was looking left when she told me about the accident. 
When a person is remembering, they look right and when they're creating, they look left.
Call Brass and tell him to meet us at the mother's house.
You got the warrant, right?
We need to see the clothes that you wore the day that your daughter died.
No, it can't.
So this is everything that you wore at the carnival last night?
Your watch is waterlogged.
How come your shoes are dry?
The lining's blue. If they'd gotten wet the indigo dye would have bled onto your white socks.
If you didn't go into the water how did your watch get wet?
You reached for her all right.  To hold her under.
And you held her under while you sat in that car until you drowned her.
You took your daughter to the carnival 'cause kids get hurt there all the time. You thought the blame would leave town with the ride. Well, you should have planned better. 
What did you actually think? That you and your boyfriend would run off like newlyweds? No kid? No cares?
She did.  Didn't you?
Arrest her, Jim.
Yeah.
I got to go home.  Thanks. Rain check?
It couldn't have come at a better time.
Sayonara.
Well, well, what a switch. You actually beat us here.
Hmm.
He's working spillover -- personal thing -- kid he knows who's in trouble.
Well, maybe we should be evaluating you.
Goody.
I'll meet you at the autopsy.  Head-topsy.
Kind of sounds like the daytime coroner.
It sucks.
Hey, I just filed for divorce. I'm feeling a little confident.
So, where's the head?
Man, look at those chopping wounds on the jawbone. 
They almost look like practice swings.
Definitely a crime of passion.
I could have.
Well, I'm out of here. I'm going to be with Brass ... see if I can get anything on those Victoria's Secret girls.
Now there's a start-- gross. Gross negligence-- flying down I-15 in a stolen car. Gross anatomy-- a human bowling ball in the trunk. Gross details-- let's hear it.
Let me guess. You left your clothes in the van.
Sure. Why not?
Silk, silk, silk.
Water. Why?
Hey ... here's something new. 
The cousin of footprints. Sock prints ... look. That's not from a shoe. Look at the fabric impressions. The guy ran out of here in his socks.
He thought wrong.
Our head.
Well, this amount of blood suggests that the victim was killed here. Why don't I do the one-to-ones and you start looking for the weapon?
Paul Bunyan.
By the way, what about my evaluation?
They're tacky. 
Hmm, positive to positive.
Tabling the ax. Hammer time.
Um ... pretty close.
Wait a minute. Maybe it wasn't about hitting him in the head. Maybe it was about fitting him in the locker.
Exactly.
We found everything else in that shed. I don't know why we didn't find a gun.
That would explain the plastic.
I didn't? Oh. 
The victim was wrapped in a plastic sheet.
Really? Who's the painter?
Yet.
Okay, let's get right to it. What's your shoe size?
Okay ... step on the paper. 
Two sizes too big. You can go.
Okay, great. Now, Mr. Applewhite ... this time, I want you to do something different. 
This time ... run.
Don't bother. There aren't any. Just like the last time. The guy's Mr. Clean. Here, knock yourself out.
I'll tell Brass to check for s*x offenders in a two-mile radius.
So, we're looking at the same guy.
What's the red stuff?
Not blood?
So, what, this guy's got some strange chemical in his mutated DNA?
Freakiest semen I've seen in a while. Call me.
Oh.
Pertaining to the case?
Well, Sheriff, I'd say let's go to my office, but I don't have one.
Fast. I'm impressed.
This one of your jokes, Greg?
I'm sure this is meaningful.
Sugar, water, salt and tomato paste. Ketchup?
Well, does he add it after or is it organic?
When we zig, he zags.
All of which I'm sure you'll share with the FBI.
Hey ... is it so bad to avail our lab to the resources of the federal government?
I've been listening to our Sheriff. He says that you won't.
Well, no. He preferred someone from night shift and it may be more than just this case.
Gil ... learn to be more politic.
When we zig, he zags.
Starting to look like deja vu all over again.
Not?
It's there or it isn't.
Staged?
I don't think he made a deposit ... either.
I just talked with Brass. He said that Walden was having an affair with a dentist in his office.
Politics ...
That may have been the problem.
Hey!
Your door was open. You okay?
Migraine. It's been a while. 
You just don't like it when you can't solve a case or command your troops.
I told the Sheriff I'd pass.
Well, if I get a promotion, I want it to be on merit ... not because you're politically tone-deaf. 
So, our guys are outside in their Tahoes. If you're a civilian, we are.
Except we are putting in for overtime.
This guy showed up on the database.
Yeah, well, don't act like it's so simple. This guy could have gone another year without being picked up. What did they get him on?
Oh.  Suspended sentence, released two days ago. Call Grissom on his cell.
He is. Dial. Tell him to meet me at this guy's work address.
You think anything illegal goes on in here?
We're with the crime lab. Heard you just copped a plea for indecent exposure.
How do you explain your DNA on the bedsheets they were murdered in?
Any recent trick offer you money for something a little weird? Say a portable sample of your DNA?
I guess we should have known if our guy was planting hairs he was planting semen.
You all right?
Nick told me.
What position? Never doubt and never look back. That's how I live my life.
Very good.
I couldn't drive here fast enough to tell you how much I love you.
Sara Sidle?
How many hit-and-runs we had this year?
My daughter wants one of these scooters. Says she's the only kid in the world who doesn't have one.
You feeling all right, Warrick?
So this is what-- your new leaf?
Hey, relax. I'll play nice. Thank you for the offer. I'm okay. I can handle this one. 
It'd be nice if this paint transfer had just one special property.
And all we've got is some paint that's going to match up to about 20 million other vehicles.
b*st*rd.
Oh, my god. Plate numbers.
Yeah.
Call DMV.
I'll meet you out front.
Hello.
Mr. Charles Moore?  We're with the Las Vegas crime lab. We'd like to talk to you about your car.
That's why we have a search warrant, sir ... 
... so that we can look in your garage.
She died at the scene.
Is it me or did he give it up too easy?
When the spirit moves you, Sara. So, in your case, I guess, never.
I hope you can return it 'cause, uh, Lindsey doesn't want a party. 
My kid.
She isn't.
What do I have to do -- put it on the bulletin board? There is no party. My daughter doesn't want a party. Is everybody clear on that?
Six feet, I'd say.
Start the car.
Just do it.
Mr. Moore was not the last person to drive this car.
Uh, turn the music off.
Yeah.
Sir, that doesn't answer our question.
Your grandson is an approved driver on your insurance. We had him pulled out of school.
Did you hit that girl with your grandfather's car?
James. You have family? Someone you can call?
We can give you a lift home.
You know that James was riding solo that night.
It's just that we've got so much power in this job which we use to get the bad guys. Once in a while, I'd like to use it to help the good guys like Mr. Moore and his grandson.
No ... what I'm saying is that ... putting James away isn't going to bring her back. Mr. Moore is willing to do the time and the victim's family gets closure.
Yeah. I know it.
Yeah. Momentary lapse.
What are you talking about?
Oh, that. Yeah.  I'm just afraid that I'm making her weird, you know?
I work 24/7. I have no time for my friends. My daughter rarely sees me having any fun. And, all of a sudden, she doesn't want a party.
Yes. I'm her mother. She mimics me.
You're just saying that to make me feel better.
It shows.
When you want evidence, you can't find it. When you don't want it, it's as big as Dallas.
Can you tell what that is?
James ... we found a tooth chip embedded in the steering wheel of your grandfather's car. It doesn't appear to be, uh, from your grandfather's teeth.
I'm very sorry, Mr. Moore. James, I'm afraid you're going to have to be taken into custody.
I know you are, Mr. Moore. We can't let you do that.
He can explain all that to court. I'll be a witness. 
We both will.
Is this more of your new leaf?
I owe you.
So, did you have a good day at school?
They did?! Well, you have got some great friends. So, Lindsey ... how come you didn't want to have a party with them?
Oh ... wow ... well, I'm really glad to be alone with you, too. I like this more than you will ever know.
Uh, maybe when you're older.  Like 40.
Whatee?
I know it's not fair. Life isn't fair.
Femur. Strongest bone in the human body -- it's sliced clean through.
Well, that's good news.
Well, do you want to be alive when your leg's being cut off?
Well, she's wearing a wedding ring.
No. No way, use your own hand.
No!
Umm ...
Ugh!
She's a floater, Wendy Barger. Thirty-four, local, Green Valley.
Already did. Talked to the husband. Never reported her missing.
At the coroner's, I.D.-ing the body.
You confirming rape?
We need to ask you a few questions.
Is there anyone that you know of that might have wanted to harm your wife?
And when was the last time you had intercourse with your wife?
It's part of our investigation, sir.
Mr. Barger ...
We're still trying to piece it all together. A sample would be helpful.
DNA doesn't match.
Let me ask you something. Would you want to know everything?
Barger as much as told us that he and his wife were having problems. She was staying at the lake. It wasn't the first time. And what do you think the chances are she was seeing somebody else?
Very good to excellent.
Anybody seen her since Tuesday?
She had something on the side. I can tell you firsthand when you don't cheat, you don't suspect.
Not a chance.
Okay. Brass, you coming?
What does that give us?
Now tell me, why are we here?
And you know this because...?
Oh. Alone?
Do you recognize this woman?
Ordered the calamari.
Well, I don't care about everyone. I care about her.
Mr. Swelco, are you all right?
And... when she didn't, you got angry?
Scared? Why?
What happened once you got here?
Do you believe him?
Is that the husband?
We're interviewing a lot of people. Most of it's follow-up.
As soon as we know, you'll know. 
You know, eventually we're going to have to tell him that his wife was having an affair with somebody he knows.
When Eddie was cheating on me I sure wish somebody would have said something.
Who else?
New pet?
Yeah, well just keep the lid on it, okay?
If you're through amusing yourself I have some news on the boat.
What do you think?
Right. We need to find the boat.
It's me. I found it. Just South of Barring Point Bridge.
I took a walk.
It's white with lime green trim. Just like the splinters we found in Wendy Barger's head wound.
I think I may have found some skin. When Wendy hit her head. Did you hear what I said?
Blood? Well, you were at the autopsy. The head trauma wasn't a bleeder.
Damn, you're good.
Mr. Barger, why don't you, um come over here with me. Just walk over ...
Have a seat.
Oh, I'm sorry.
He deserved to know the truth.
I guess you just have to be on the wrong end of an affair to understand.
We bring ourselves to our cases. We can't help it. I knew how Barger felt. Would you just relax? I didn't give him chapter and verse.
You right, you know. I should be just like you. Alone in my hermetically sealed condo watching discovery on the big screen working genius-level crossword puzzles, but no relationships. No chance any will slop over into a case. Right. I want to be just like you.
Grissom ... what personal stuff?
Okay.
What?
Why?
There's no gas. It's not gonna start.
As long as there is one.
That's it. What's your point?
It's sore.  But you already knew that. 
It was just an accident.
Well ...  ... I guess we better go talk to the husband. I mean, unless you think I'm going to compromise the integrity of the case again.
I would love to.
He had to say it.
Okay. Hey, Warrick.
We just came from your house. We wanted to tell you that your wife's death was an accident.
Hey, you want to give us our assignments or do you want us to take... the night off?
Hey,  ... you could've turned the job down.
Well let's just hurry this up.
You really want to see flash paper flash? Walk in on a bookie.
Don't answer it. 
We've got work to do ... boss.
Did some kid off him with a silver spoon?
Where is he?
You're coming with me.
Hi.
What do you got?
With that, probably.
Yeah. Blows to the head, up close and personal. A lot of passion around this one.  How about the suspect?
A rock?
How many times did you hit him?
Miss Armstrong ... were you and the Dean having a personal relationship?
Then why did you hire him? You founded the school. It's your integrity on the line.
But you hit him more than once.
Well, you hit a man once, there's no blood. The first hit's free. You hit him more than that ...  The walls in his office look like the Dean went a couple rounds with Mike Tyson.
Will you excuse me? Officer. Thanks.
Heavy on B.S., zippo on truth.
Hell, no. I'm stoked.  We drew the best case, Nicky. I can feel it.
String it.
Wow. 
Now, there's a look I like to see-- confusion.
Cast-off from the weapon against the window.
The back wall ... void... against the back wall. 
The floor under the body?
There's an interruption -- a space where something or someone comes between the blood coming off the body and the wall.
Kate Armstrong is lying.
The blood evidence is telling us otherwise.
And when you were playing witness where were you standing?
You're sure?
Nick reenacted the crime using blood spatter.
Sure.
Okay, so this is what we've got so far on our dead dean. Blood spatter and blood cast-off on the walls. Kate Armstrong's confession, her clothes. Three void areas, and that's pretty much it. Anything else?
That's it.
The one thing we're missing.
On Julia's clothes.
We need the clothes that you were wearing the day that The Dean was killed.
Why?
Blood's funny that way. In fact, I bet there's lots of blood on Dean Woods' shirt.
Look at that void. What a beaut.
Talk about your unique attributes. What do you think -- a bandage?
Julia, make a fist for me with your right hand. I mean, count it down like so, starting with your thumb first. Five, four, three, two, one.
Dean woods' shirt.
Now, remember we said blood tells us everything? Well ... so does the absence of blood.
All because the guy was handsy? Seems a little severe.
No, no, this isn't over.
We still don't know why.
Hey, Nick.
Grissom's not always right. Do yourself a favor and think for yourself. I mean that as a friend, okay? Okay, detective, we got some more homework to do.
Mm-hmm.
Great.
$5,000. Another for $5,000. $3,000. Memo: Loans. I don't think so. I think she was paying him off for something.
This is where Gris and I differ. Forensics is about more than science. Human behavior. The inconsistencies of human behavior. Yes, how is crucially important, but so is why.
Bigger why: Why did it have to come down to this?
Maybe they didn't.
A lose-lose situation.
So, what do you have for me? I could use a rush.
Because?
Because I used to be one, I'll be biased?
Just let me do the prelim.
Eddie.
According to the police report she's telling a different story. I wonder what the rape kit's going to say.
In the parking lot behind the club.
Melanie know about this?
You might want to call her anyway. She can loan you the money for an attorney.
A detective from s*x crimes has been assigned. I'm going to place another CSI.
What about her?
Hotlines ... hit or miss.
So I saw Eddie. He actually... seemed scared.
Um ... no. I'm not really sure what I ... feel.
Hi. 
Evans, I'm sorry I'm late. I'm Catherine ...  ... just Catherine. I'm a forensic scientist.
Thanks.
Yeah. 
Those bruises from last night?
Sexual assault nurse collect a kit yet?
Why don't you see if you can catch her. I'd like her to get a sample from under her fingernails.
Anything that might, show up from a ... a struggle.
Okay. I didn't hand it off.
I'm sorry, Warrick.
I know. 
I'm sorry. 
I'm doing this for Lindsey.
Eyes, no hands.
Skin samples from under the woman's fingernails are consistent with Ed's. I saw some bruises but Eddie's style has always been very ... involved ... vigorous.
Thank you, Warrick. Eddie said that she was into it.
Eddie.
What are you doing here?
You could be a detective. Thank you.
Well, you obviously made bail. Did you get a lawyer?
It wasn't all bad.
Well, let me give it a try. 
Excuse me, sir. 
Can we see your permits?
Okay, Ted.
I'm okay.
Can't seem to get off the night shift. 
If you want to call that dressed. Yeah, Evans. Hey, Ted, you heard about this thing with Eddie and April?
You mind if I look around?
Thanks, Ted.
So, Greg, what did the rape kit say?
Glycerin?
It's a contraceptive film. 
May I?
Thank you.
That's right.
Really?
Uh-huh.
Oh, I doubt it.
You would have remembered. 
So, this film-- it's kind of hard to detect because it dissolves with body heat. And, as you know, Greg, s*x can make a body pretty hot.
Which means that April inserted the film while she was still at work.
Like what -- marriage, kids?
And for that you set him up for rape?
Wait a minute. You think that Eddie's got money?
He reps some bands off-strip.
Nothing.
Morning. 
Please don't tell me that you're in trouble again already.
You're welcome. 
I don't think that's such a good idea, though.
What's to talk about? You cheated on me. I caught you. I've got a new life.
You got it.
I got the blood samples on the way to the lab.
You mean the blood swirls next to the father's body in the boys' room? 
I studied pictures of the Manson Murders. This isn't butter. It's imitation. 
What's your take?
Explains why the blood is confined to the bed and the floor under it.
Gave his life for the little girl. There should be more blood.
The first suspect.
Well, she'd need help. Maybe a boyfriend?
Linds.
Linds? Lindsey? 
Lindsey ... Lindsey.
Hi, honey!
Oh, am I glad to see you.
I know. I was just there. Your teacher told me daddy came to pick you up. Oh, you feel so good. 
Ed ... I'm working this quadruple. Time got away from me. I apologize.
Right.
Yeah. Thank you. I really, really ...
Yeah. 
Oh, god.
Yeah.
What?
You made pancakes?
For dinner?
That would be Grissom.
Ed.
Okay, I'll be right there. Just let me put on some clean clothes.
Eddie ...
She always does.
We're about to go ask her. Nick, what did you find out about that stuff that you collected at the back of the house?
But your statement says that you bent down and hugged your mother who was bleeding profusely. Then you ran out, tripping over your father's body in the upstairs hallway.
It's a little too late to start coaching her now.
The doctor says it's from trauma. What happened, Tina? Did you catch your boyfriend killing your family?
That they killed the family so they could be together?
Notes on mapping: Collins family murder. Case #00-398. Intruder killed mother. 
Father went to protect the little girl. Got nicked by knife. 
Killer subdued him as dad was entering the little girl's room to ... 
... save her. 
Grissom.
Who's asking?
You know, your department can't seem to get things straight. If you're looking for the little girl, she's already got a caseworker.
My Lindsey? Why? What are you talking about?
Is this Eddie's idea of a joke? What, are you in one of his bands?
It's me. Something's off on the map.
Uh ... I'm looking at dad's blood in the hall. I found an interesting drop. The droplet tells me that he wasn't running to the little girl's room. 
Yeah. 
I filled one of your holes, Grissom. 
The father was killed first -- then the mother. 
And the blood that we found in the hallway was from the knife.
Night, guys.
The ones that got away. Fish.
Not good. Exceptional. Print examiner lifted a thumbprint off the mini-recorder near the tub of our first victim. The print came back this.
So what do we do?
That looks like he was shot trying to protect himself.
Forced into the tub at gunpoint?
Stuart Rampler was resistant. He didn't want to get into that tub too easily. He took a few jabs to the temple.
Not a bad start.
We talked to the second victim's girlfriend -- played his suicide recording for her. She confirmed that it was his voice. 
I know. We just need to be absolutely certain. Do you have a recording of your son's voice so that we could tie the killings together?
Disco Placid -- what's that?
Really?
A pleasure.
The mother was wrong. That is her son's voice.
Play the second victim's tape.
No. Play it through.
He's just reading from a suicide script.
What do you think?
Okay, so maybe it's some reverse or backwards pattern. August 17, 1958 ... 1957. The suicide message was recorded backwards; the postage stamp was upside-down ...
What do you mean? It's more than one person?
Compliance?
It's Grissom's print? 
Wait a minute. Somebody got ahold of your prints.
Well, somebody's obviously making this personal. They could've got your print from a glass that you touched at a restaurant. From a latex glove that you discarded and they turned inside out ... 
Oh, god ... 
... you kill it.
:Have we located this bum?
He's obviously making a point.
But I don't think it's peace in terms of ... human civility or unrest. I think maybe it's peace of mind.  Justice.
Latex rubber surface, freshly dried paint a snip of scotch tape - 
Change databases. Newspaper index, periodicals index -- just keep trying.
So he was killing men who were born on the same day that his father died.
Blank. What's that mean?
Tony Candlewell, age 30. Communications Company Manager from Atlanta, married ... no record.
I don't know but this sure must have looked scary at thirty thousand feet.
I'll start the interviews.
Sir, we realize this is an imposition, and we apologize for it. Nobody wants to see you on your way more than we do. We'll make this as quick and painless as we possibly can.
More flies with honey.
And he wouldn't let you?
Are you telling me this guy was kicking the back of your seat the entire flight?
May I see your hands?
And did you give him anything?
And, as far as you know did he complain of a headache when he boarded?
So what made the worm turn?
Right. Well, thanks for your time.
Nada. You?
I'm going to go out on a limb here ... and say ... they're hiding something?
And where were you when this was all going on, Mrs. Finn?
In the bathroom? For how long?
So, you ... slept through everything and you woke up next to a ... dead body.
All right, we're going to have to change tack here because what I said about getting more flies with honey -- I was wrong.
Why you telling me?
Well, why don't you tell them that? They're not giving me bupkus.
Shoes ... off. 
Now.
Hi.
Oh. Excellent.
That looks good.
Well, that's it then.
Okay, folks. I've got some good news ... and I've got some bad news.
Well, the good news would be that seven of you may be ... getting out of here very soon.
The bad news is that three of you may be staying in Vegas a lot longer than you planned. And that would be ... Mr. Lou Everett, Mr. Max Valdez ... and Dr. Kiera Behrle. Would you ... please come with me.
Dr. Behrle, we're going to be asking you some very sensitive questions -- questions that I know that I wouldn't want my daughter to hear.
How did you get that black eye?
Okay. 
I'm, uh ... just a little confused. Your heel impressions were found on the back of the victim's suede jacket. 
That's a little aggressive for a Good Samaritan.
And you're satisfied with that?
But you are trained to use the paddles in the event of an emergency and this was an emergency situation.
So, whatever it was he was going through it didn't look a heart attack.
All right, so let me get this straight. 2F is on the floor. His wife is in the aisle brandishing a broken wine bottle. What about 1A? He was closest to the action.
If you ask me, it's their spouses that are the dummies.
So is mine. These passengers are lying.
Lou -- the angry businessman. How about that?
Single mom. What an imagination you have.
What time was that?
Very good.
And my shoes end up on his back.
That's probably how the doctor got her black eye.
And, at this point we're not individuals anymore -- we're a mob.
And you can't perform CPR on a man's back. Dr. Behrle had to have rolled him over ... 
... probably just to cover for herself.
Well ... it's wicked serious in here.
All the way.
That's right. If it involves the protection of my child I fight to the death.
That's a cop-out. It's a simple question. What would you have done if you had been one of those passengers?
He was a threat.
Have you been inside?
What have you got?
Yeah, join the club.
Good morning, Gil. So, this is Tony Braun's house. Son of Sam Braun.
Oh, yeah, you bet your ass.  Sam came to Vegas when Vegas was dying. Built three casinos in a year. Had ties to Bugsy Siegel.
Chasing the dragon. A pinch of H. Heat the foil. Inhale the fumes.
It sure seems that way.
Well, I'll tell you one thing -- if those were my dogs, I wouldn't be leaving this gate open.
Gardener said it was the first time in five years that he'd found this gate unlocked.
Last morning of Tony Braun's life? Well, either somebody inside the house opened it, or somebody had a key because this lock hasn't been forced. There's no pry marks. No metal shavings.
Who's this?
And, uh, where has she been the past 12 hours?
Right now, your house is our crime scene ... and we can do whatever we want and that includes fingerprinting you.
Thumb to pinkie.
Of course you are.
Yeah. Is Sam Braun in?
Would you let him know that Catherine Willows is here to see him?
Yeah, well, that was a long time ago.
I know, but you were married and I was a baby. It would've never worked. Sam ... how are you holding up?
: Yeah ... sounds like Tony.
Sam ... the bigger the pedestal the bigger the target.
Well, that's business. What about personal?
Did you ever talk to Tony about any of his girlfriends?
Janine Haywood.
Yeah, I do.
Okay, on the left, Braun prints we got from the coroner and on the right, gold digger prints I got from Janine Haywood.
And?
Good thing or ... bad thing?
I thought he inhaled it.
He ate it? 
Well, Braun was a heroin addict using heavy just before he died which means he was probably meek as a lamb.
And make him drink hemlock. It's a lot easier to pour liquid down a guy's throat than it is to make him swallow a hundred pills.
Not lately. We found fifty Xanax in Tony's stomach.
I'll tell you what you left -- your fingerprints all over the prescription bottle.
Oh, mind the dummy.
I figured. So why'd I bring the dummy?
Braun's shirt.
Is this part of the Sherlock Holmes Fan Club Kit?
So Braun would have been on his third or fourth balloon by then.
But when you're doing drugs, you're a slob; and when you're being manhandled, you're even sloppier. Like this.
He was burked.
Maybe Janine had a helper.
That's a lot of motive.
Yep. Braun family. Long arms.
I thought you said that Ritten's wife lives in Carson City.
Or digging up silver.
Mrs. Ritten?
Criminalistics.
I don't have to ask you that question.
He's Tony Braun's brother. He's a pit boss at the Tangiers which is why his prints were on file -- gaming card.
Go figure. The more evidence that shows up the more this case doesn't make sense. We got two suspects in custody and neither of their prints are on the duct tape.
Mm-hmm.
It's been done. They're not Walt Braun's prints on the tape. Came back unknown.
Flimsy alibis don't prove murder. What else have we got?
Without Curt's prints on it.
Been there.
What've we got?
Now, Jim, that's just a little callous.
He is?
So, wait a second -- Janine, the stripper claims that half of everything is hers so that's actually more than just wishful thinking?
I just got the references off of Walt Braun gave the samples to Greg.
We got to test it against Janine.
Mm-hmm.
Are you finished? Open your mouth. 
What about the maid?
Wow. You got this whole thing down don't you?
The earring back was lost that day.
So, I guess rule number one was broken. There was a woman in the house.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
She lives in Carson City.
She has access to Curt's truck.
Hell hath no fury ... 
If you don't wear earrings for a while the holes will close up.
You should've let your husband rot in jail. 
We lifted your thumbprint from the check that you posted for his bail.
Just like a pair of earrings-- identical.
What I don't get is ... you and Walt Braun didn't move in the same circles. How'd the two of you hook up?
It's not your fault.
It's human nature. We can't deny our feelings.
Hey, Sam ... you still got me.
Well, considering I was six months old when you guys lit the flame ... a lot of time has passed. You had plenty of chances.
Sorry.
I don't doubt that for a minute.
You're roach racing
Ah.
What do you feed those guys?
And who's ... supervising night shift?
Me? I am on the red-eye to Reno. The Braun Family is opening a new casino. I am Sam's date.
I told you once, memo'd you twice.
Better get somebody.
Do you think you're the only friend I've got in the police department? I'm just telling you, be careful.
Hey, look, we all get a little crazy when our kids are involved.
Okay. Hey, but listen. If you find the boyfriend, don't go it alone.
Mmm.
All yours, girl.
Oh, Nick, give it up. We got a death imminent to worry about.
Hand me that magnifier.  Thank you.
See those white specks? 
No, I don't think so.
Never you mind. 
Let's just get this to trace.
I gave this to trace. Why do you have 
This is skin.
Dandruff.
Had a bad case of seborrhea.
Thanks.
As long as you don't tell her it's a date.
House mogul caught with his pants on? Yeah, I'm just rolling to the hospital to get his clothes. Why?
You serious? For what?
Wow!
Let me know.
His property is part of our investigation. I'm afraid I have to take it.
Yeah, me, too. Did you work for the Fairmonts three years ago, when Mr. Fairmont was shot?
Interesting. 
You have dandruff.
It is when I'm on a case. Do you mind?
But you did redress him and place him in the elevator.
Well, that's dangerous to say to a scientist. 
Dandruff is nothing more than sloughed-off skin. It has a nucleus just like a cell on your arm or your big toe. 
These 13 DNA markers from this dandruff cell are a match to the dandruff that I recovered from your sweater. You were there. At that hotel.
Let me guess -- you snuck out down the stairwell.
Well, we won't mind if we compare your DNA to the vaginal contribution of a condom that we recovered from Mr. Fairmont's room?
Good. We'd like to show you something else -- about that accidental shooting three years ago at your boss' house.
We're thinking it was you.
Where was his wife?
So, you just sat there in the dark and aimed south of his belt.
Or both.
We just interviewed her. She copped to moving him. We're looking hard at the wife on the poisoning.
We know. Dermatomycoses seborrhea -- we got it.
She could be back from dinner at any moment. This shouldn't take long.
Shampoo full of the same poison found in Bob Fairmont's remains?
Cream cheese.
Garlic cream cheese ...
It explains away his bad breath.
We'll see.
This is yours ... and these are yours.  There's the door. We build a case before we make any arrests.
Hey, what's going on? We called the hospital. She's been released.
A dairy farm. 
Gideon Dairy and Cheese. Largest supplier of milk in Connecticut, in fact. Brass talked to a local chamber-of-commerce type about Claudia's husband. You want to know who his secretary was?
And you loved your husband Right up to the day he died ... of 240 milligrams of selenium.
Bravo. Ladies. You have got this down to a science.  Why did it happen the first time? Hubby ignored you or abused you or you got sick of him fooling around so you started slipping the ... 
... cow stuff into his chocolate milk? Julia must have caught you.
So the two of you struck a deal.
But the difference is that you actually loved Bob Fairmont. 
You shot him because he was cheating but that didn't get in the way of your long-term goals, did it?
It's down the hall to your right.
Well, no big surprise. We have proof of poison but no way to prove which one of them did it.
She-said/she-said defense? It's never going to fly. They'll raise each other as a viable suspect just like they did with us.
See you back at CSI.
He bled out.
So he died approximately ten hours ago.
Thanks, David. Okay, let's see who you are ... 
Nevada license.
James Jasper.
Well, you were right -- he should've been wearing his orange safety vest.
Hunter lays in wait, spots a deer. Hunter fires ...
... deer takes off ... but the bullet keeps going until it stops. 
It's got to be somewhere.
You find the bullet?
You know what the textbook says -- if you're not a hundred percent sure how to collect it, bring the whole thing in.
Nick.
Tell me what you got?
Trajectory?
And how was your husband handling that?
Mrs. Jasper, was your husband an experienced hunter?
You were?
That's cottonwood.
I did.
Ah, oxidation.
Well, we've got the wrong bullet but the case still seems like a write-off.
She bought it?
He's in the insurance business and she buys a policy behind his back.
Okay, the tree is a point of reference.
So the bullet should be somewhere between your rope and mine.
Congratulations to us. Still a needle in a haystack.
Nick.
Let's just pack it up. The bullet couldn't have gone this far.
Yeah, just tying up a few loose ends.
We haven't heard a single shot all day. Where are these hunters that you talked about?
No one hunts during the day but the coroner placed Jasper's time of death at 2:00 P.M.
Expect the unexpected. GSR on the clothing means the victim was shot at close range.
Or suicide.
Okay. But if he was murdered, we should've found some evidence of the killer at the crime scene.
All right.
She didn't kill her husband.
A pro would've shot him in the heart.
Right. But he never moved. He was standing in front of this tree when he was shot. He didn't try to get to his car, get help, he just ... sat down and waited to die.
Ninety-nine out of 100 suicides by gun ... muzzle to the mouth, bullet to the brain. But there's always just that one.
No, the weapon we found was never fired.
He shoots himself in the gut leaving himself time to hide the weapon.
How about the lake?
Hey.
Metal on metal.
Okay. Right there.
Well, we never found the bullet, but we found the gun.
Mr. Jasper committed suicide.
Mrs. Jasper, you purchased a life insurance policy on your husband in which you are the sole beneficiary.
We have the actual application for the policy with your signature.
Your husband staged his death to look like a homicide. As a beneficiary, if you knew of his intentions to take his own life, that would constitute fraud.
Hi.
You want to explain this?
Because he knew that if he had bought the insurance himself it would've sent up a red flag.
Long drive.
Anything else?
Pete Walker, California. Date of birth: August 17, 1957. It's got to be the work of Paul Millander. What do you think brought him back out?
Hasn't changed his M.O .-- Kills men whose birthdays are on the anniversary of his father's murder.
Ready for this?
Isn't your birthday in August?
Plan of attack -- split up. Nick, take the tape over to A-V. Break it down. Warrick, Sara -- examine the perimeter. We need to know how he got in and got out. We'll stay with the body.
Anytime.
He's got stippling on the side of his face. 
No entry wounds near his face.
Wait ... wait a minute. I got something.
Hello, Dolly. Dark hair, 12 inches. Female?
Well, the vic had light brown hair so we know it's not his.
So, back to that again. Another victim, or an accomplice?
What do you mean?
So Millander planted an aged hair? But once exposed, the tag would dry up and fall off, especially in transport.
Okay, so what's he trying to tell us? That he used to kill women?
Grounds?
Nevada state patrol found the victim's vehicle here. Found the body in good springs here.
And what time was sunrise this morning?
So in that time he had to get the recording and get rid of the body.
Are we sure he didn't kill him in the car? He was shot in the warehouse. He was incapacitated in the car.
Grissom, you want to add something to this?
Employment -- Dinners Delivered. Need a car for that.
Try Stuart Rampler.
Besides birth dates.
You mean court dates for speeding tickets?
Always the same judge?
Gil.
Any chance he's got a twin?
Why, you getting a cold?
Ah, fuming.  I'll lift it and get it to the lab.
You're never going to believe who Judge Mason's fingerprints match. Judge Mason. As printed when he was sworn before the bar Nevada State Superior Court.
Yeah, we know that. How do we prove it?
Well, that's the first thing Brass looked into. Apparently, the records building burned down in 1982.
Ruled arson. No suspects ever found.
Here's some good news. Brass went to the new records building looking for anything on a Millander. Found current property-tax accounts.
Mm-hmm.
Isabelle Millander? 
It's our understanding that your child witnessed your husband's murder.
Thank you.
I hope we're not interrupting. It looks as if you're expecting someone for dinner.
May I use your bathroom?
Thank you.
Oh ... I have a daughter myself. I was admiring the old clothes. 
She's beautiful.
I'm sorry. 
Mrs. Millander we're just trying to clarify ...
So, Paul Millander killed his sister.
It's a kid's fingerprint from the baseball card.
Brass found no prints from little Pauline no birth records, no death certificate. I'm going to use the prints from the only other kid who lived in the Millander house.
Ridge analysis proof. Judge Mason is ... 
So her brother planted it?
Millander. It's a female hair.
You know, when I was back at the house I saw several photographs of Pauline and nothing of Paul. In fact, the only proof of Paul is a hidden baseball card.
Oh, this is just ridiculous. I mean, you'd think they'd make an exception in this case -- three murders. This guy's telling me that Millander is representing himself. Pro pers are always last on the docket.
You going home?
I re-read the backgrounds of Millander's victims. I think that he slipped up. You know how every victim read the suicide note I'd like to say 'I love you' to my mother? Well, Pete Walker had no mother.  She died in childbirth.
So how rich is this guy?
Who doesn't?
And he hasn't said a word to anyone?
Mr. Logan ... would you please put your hands out? Palms up.
I'm also going to need you to strip.
Thank you, Mr. Logan. You can put your shirt down. Left arm out, please. 
Right arm. 
No visible injuries.
Didn't Shakespeare say let's kill all the lawyers?
Yeah. Hey, can you do me a favor and drop this off at the lab? I'm due at a nursery rhyme recital. Lindsey's going to play the girl in the moon.
He got the mumps.
Mr. Logan!
You forgot your sunglasses.
Service-oriented policing.
What? 
Hello
CSI three Willows. Who are you?
Criminalist.
Who would be dead?
Yes.
Who is this?
Let's talk in the car.
You never answered my question. Who's Amanda?
Somebody does. How did they make contact?
Got your attention. 
Yeah, I heard that part. I need a drink.
We don't know how long it's going to be before he calls. Why don't you order something?
I have the phone. Do us both a favor: Relax.
Um, two glasses: One with ice; one without. Roy?
So, let's get to know each other. You first. 
You were born; you came home from the hospital. Then what?
Give me the finger.
I got to preserve this evidence.
Hello.
Let's go.
Open the briefcase. I've got an idea. 
I use this to paint my daughter's face. She was playing the moon tonight in the school play. I missed it. Mark the edges of the money. 
Do you got any kids?
One more mile.
Sorry, it's been a while since I've driven a sports car. 
Thanks.
First we need to see Amanda.
No. We need something more than just your word.
He had a shot gun. If all he wanted was the money, we'd both be dead.
Give me the phone.
We're past that. Give me the phone!
Well... according to the map she should be somewhere around here.
Why don't you give me a hand?
There was a kidnapping.
You got my clues?
I bet she loved that.
I owe you. Thank you.
You're assuming it was a he. Rabbit mask. Full-beam headlights. Truman Capote voice. Who can tell gender?
Bloody nose, ecchymosis. She took a beating. Cause of death?
I'm going to head over to the townhouse check out those blood spots with Nick.
Mr. Logan?
I wouldn't advise that.
You've got to give us time. Why don't you go home, get some sleep?
This town is full of hotels.
Marble.
Kidnapper probably broke in. She made a run for it. Got hit in the face. Went down.
And you know this from ... ?
So, how did the killer get the body out of the house?
Bedsheets?
Plastic, maybe. If she was murdered here her finger was severed here where are the knives?
Clever. Kidnapper washed all the knives.
Get those glasses to Greg.
He wrapped her in it.
Greg got saliva off the wine glasses. Ran the DNA. One was Amanda, and the other a woman.
Or fight about.
Mrs. Logan, do you know Amanda Freeman? Because she called you on your cell phone the day she was murdered.
We could compel a DNA sample which would confirm that you had a glass of wine with her that night.
You tore down the shower curtain wrapped the body in it.
You transported the body to the reservoir in the back of your SUV where some of your son's PB and J made it onto the shower curtain.
One more thing. Mrs. Logan, can you hold your hands out palms up? Jim, can you hit the lights?
You killed Amanda Freeman.
Your client?
What are you saying? That Mr. Logan paid you to dress up as a bunny rabbit?
So, basically, this was a stage play written by Mr. Logan.
I'll drive.
Mr. Logan? Open the door. Please.
Fat chance. Son of a bitch. He had me completely fooled.
I bet that locker's empty, too.
Amanda broke the only rule. Don't call the missus.
Everything from that point on was calculated. 
Blood on his hands ... 
... he's the last customer of the day at the bank Acting suspiciously ...
... driving recklessly.
You bet your ass. He didn't leave those sunglasses behind by accident. His cell phone rang on cue. The call's for me.
He practically forced that money into his lawyer's hands.
Sure, we wanted us to suspect the wife. That's why he used her SUV 
to transport the body. 
And he let me mark the money because he knew that eventually his lawyer would touch it.
So I did everything in my power to help him.
Willows.  Yeah.
Bravo. 
That's right. You're short one mistress. I got to hand it to you that was a brilliant performance. But then again, any man who juggles a wife and mistress and god knows what else has to be a pro.
Try explaining that to your son.
Body Farm; creepy.
Tell that to Slim hanging from the tree.
Can't just slip a card into the deck.
Well, look. One of your friends.
Vic seem more like a hardwood floors kind of guy to you?
Yeah.
Quiet.
Bugs or blood?
I gave the prints to identification. They're running through the bases now.
Oh, it's not a John Doe anymore. Database says that our victim is Mike Kimble age 38. He has a townhouse in Summerlin. Brass is going to meet us there along with the rest of the unit. My bet says that it's the primary crime scene.
Aren't you coming?
Sounds fascinating.
Is that Mike Kimble's house?
Seems like somebody beat us here.
Where's his neighbor now?
You and Mike were engaged?
Would you mind showing us your hands?
To see if there's any gun powder or evidence of a burn on them.
We have evidence that Mike may have had an inappropriate relationship with your daughter.
Things like this happen sometimes right under our noses. We're going to have to talk with your daughter.
Jody, we found pictures in Mike's house of you posing. 
In some of the pictures ... 
In some of the pictures you're wearing a bathing suit. Do you remember Mike taking them?
Jody ... anything that he did to you was not your fault. You can tell me if Mike took those pictures.
The daughter clammed up. Seems to be in the protect-the-abuser trap. I'm going to take her over to the hospital for a SART exam. 
I've seen it happen. As a mother, I hope not.
Sara's not going to be too happy with that experiment in the fridge. 
The doctor finished the exam on Jody Bradley. Physical findings: Scarring, chronic sexual abuse. 
Listen, there's a good chance the daughter's our arsonist. She had second-degree burns on her wrist.
Right. You coming with?
Right. Experiment.
That's the girl's nightgown.
Child Services will be remanding Jody to a foster home.
Jim?
Convenient timing.
It wasn't that you 'sensed' what was going on?
I'll believe the DNA.
So, whose is it, the father? 
Voluntary man, first offense. Out on bail. Free in four. No jury was going to convict a father for killing his daughter's abuser. What do you have?
Looks as if Jody was probably telling the truth. She did burn herself on a curling iron.
Jody? We know that Mike gave you his camera. We suspect that your father used it to take pictures of you on his boat. 
We believe that he then placed the camera back at Mike's to implicate him along with the pictures.
Did you ever tell your mom?
Jody, we have strong forensic evidence against your father. But cases like this are very difficult to prove. A victim testifying makes all the difference.
Jody, if you don't talk ...
What is this?
Yeah, 12.
Excuse me. Could I talk to you for a moment?
I owe you an apology. I have an eight-year-old daughter.
Just give me a straight-ahead murder any day.
I heard about you and ... uh ... Sara.
Are you in denial? No, that's ... no, no ... way too analytical. Wow, you got burned bad, huh? Welcome to the club. I got third-degree burns from my marriage. Happens to everybody. Everybody just moves on.
But you have to deal with it. You have to deal with it first. You got to deal with it before it goes away. You are the supervisor. You have responsibilities, and people are making a family around you whether you like it not, whether you give them permission or not. We don't have to go to the Grand Tetons together, just ... every now and then you got to lift your head up out of that microscope.
Well, I guess is must be from the third period. Looks like that other team worked him over pretty good.
So, why did you move the body?
Then Mr. Rivers was still breathing?
Did you also do the stitch work?
So, if he'd listened, he'd still be alive.
What do these guys play for? A little money? Imitation Stanley Cup?
And the joy of kicking ass. You are...?
Is that how you lost the, uh...? The sit spin? 
Which means?
That why your guy ended up dead?
Usually does.
What'd you get from area 51?
Every fire needs a match. So, I guess this is their equipment?
Okay.
Okay.
Ms. Gallagher?
Catherine Willows Crime Lab. I understand you play for area 51. Did you see much ice time during the game?
You know what? Been there, done that. Just asking a question here.
Oh ... you've got good peripheral vision. You see the ice really well.
You're a real teammate. Down the line, just one of the guys.
Any reason why?
Nice bike.
So, this is what being a stockbroker buys you.
How do men live like this?
Well, it's a cave with hardwood floors.
Well, how about a plant? Anything to makes it a little more ... human. I mean, it doesn't seem like this guy had any ... connection to anybody.
It's never a good sign when the number of women a guy sleeps with is more than the number of chairs he owns.
Well, uh, ballparking it, I'd say ... four women to every one piece of furniture he owns including the TV.
So... I guess our guy is about three things - pucks, bucks, and ... chicks.
Well, we know how he lived.
Yeah, I saw ten of them.
You got a match. To what?
So, what you're saying is whoever was in Jane Gallagher's bed was on the ice the night Terry Rivers died. 
So we just double-checked the search warrant returned from Terry Rivers apartment. There was no quinine found in the location. He never had a prescription for quinine.
Do you have his medical file?
Let me see it.
Somebody did. You can withhold medical information from your friends all you want but it's still going to be in your hospital record.
Aren't you on duty?
Hey.
Okay. How are you.
Whew. Attitude adjustment?
Ah. How is Mrs. Tadero?
Oh.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah?
Well ... I had a good teacher.
So, did you see it? The confession? 
And what do you think?
What if Kelso didn't kill Stephanie?
What if he didn't? I mean ...
Well ... maybe I'm just afraid that if I accept that he killed her that it's over, and Stephanie's really dead. 
I ... I don't know.
The evidence.
The statute says that once the convicted party is executed or dies, the evidence can be destroyed. I-it's not here.
Yeah, well, people make mistakes.
Yeah. Fifteen ...
Yeah. 
Yeah, that's it. 
This was my old life.
Stephanie was my best friend.
I got a gig. I promised him I'd be there. Forgive me?
I never saw her again.
Peace of mind that they got the killer.
Thank you, Greg. Thank you.
I'm taking this to Trace.
You see that?
Fifteen years ago, we figured, why light up something you can't analyze in the first place?
Priority.
Wow.
Found a third donor on the knife. Blood's from a male. Unknown.
Then you know why we're looking at the file.
Hey.
It is in the evidence log.
Jimmy Tadero. Booked two days after the murder. So why no photos?
He's my mentor. If he screwed up, I don't think he's going to want an audience.
Oh, uh ...
Some things do.
You were always nice to me, Ted.
Jimmy changed my life. And no funny stuff, just mentor and pupil. Guy delivered me into a whole new life.
Hey! Jimmy! What's the case of the week?
Mm-hmm?
Guy's spying on his ex. Has a heart attack when he sees her doing the nasty with the pool man.
Just my woman's intuition.
Yeah.
Wish I didn't know. You up for this?
This is where Stephanie was found.
Over there is where the beat cop grabbed Kelso as he was running out into the alley.
Now, do you remember where you found Kelso's bloody glove?
And then you logged it into evidence? No sketches, no photos. Just brought it in two days after the murder.
Arresting Officer never saw a glove, according to the file.
You always used to say if something doesn't feel right, it probably isn't.
Jimmy, you're not hiding anything, are you? You didn't try to make things fit ... ?
I got your beep. Did you run those tests?
From where he cut himself stabbing her?
Kelso's saliva?
Well, blood mixed with saliva sounds like a mouth injury.
Did you check the blood that Ecklie collected from the murder weapon?
Well, how did blood from Kelso's mouth end up on the glove as well as the knife?
Unless it was planted.
Jimmy. You set him up.
You don't know that.
Guys like Kelso brag all the time about things they didn't do, cat-and-mouse ... 
Good evidence doesn't need help. You taught me that one. I'm going to have to ask you for a sample of your blood.
New technology. We isolated male blood on the murder weapon. It doesn't belong to Kelso.
You were in love with her, Jimmy. That was no secret. But the ring was. 
Three karats and she turned you down. Same week she died. I never thought anything of it till now.
I'll get a warrant.
There was a shooting one night in the club and Jimmy pulls out his revolver and takes down the bad guy. The guy's on the floor, dying. Even though this was fifteen years ago, we still knew about aids. Jimmy then puts his gun away, he leans down -- he starts giving this guy mouth-to-mouth after having just shot him. 
Forget his own life, he's going to bring this guy back. And he did. 
You've been excluded on the murder weapon.
Yeah, I compared it to Ted. I compared it to every male in CODIS. There were no hits, nowhere. Have a seat, Jimmy.
Yeah, you were.
You know now what. 
You put a man away for life on planted evidence, Jimmy.
Scumbag or saint, what you did is a capital crime. You can't play with evidence, especially in a murder.
What do you want me to do? What do you want me to do? Do you want me to look the other way? Do you want me to dummy my report?
I earned my career and you did this to yourself. You fabricated evidence, Jimmy.
... because you sold the one thing a cop can't afford to sell: Your integrity. So you tell me, between the two of us who's the whore?
Arrest him.
You can hate me all you want. I'm going to see you through this.
It's still a rescue operation.
Got here quick. That should tell you something.
Parolee-At-Large.
And already over state lines.
I'm sure it was.
Fire department says the driver of the Camaro's dead.
Now that is a serious blowout. And the front left tire's still intact.
Not anymore.
Driver tried to maintain control. Veered to the left.
Putting pressure on the right front tire causing it to blow. The ... the bus then veers to the right and goes off the road.
I'm going to go see what's going on with that Camaro.
We're going to get you out of here, okay?. Rescue!
Can you tell me your name?
He's one of the victims in the bus crash. He was in the Camaro. He was driving the Camaro.
Excuse me. 
Catherine Willows with the Las Vegas Crime Lab. This will just take a second. Can you tell me your name?
Eric?
Eric Kevlin, 32. He was a resident at the UCLA Med Center. He was on his way to Vegas to surprise his girlfriend.
But he's rescued. Given a second chance on life. and, uh ... he signs this.
It's a pre-op DNR.
Hey, Nick. We making any progress?
We checked Kevlin's property at the hospital. There's no wallet. 
Literally.
Yeah, that's him.
Nice-looking girl.
He said he wanted to surprise you.
Is there any reason why Eric, in a medical crisis would refuse resuscitation?
Chloroform in the tire?
23 passengers, plus the driver.
Whoever tampered with that tire was playing Russian roulette with people's lives.
Right. You look hard enough everybody's got a skeleton.
Tracey Logan? Seat 8-B? Her boyfriend was Eric Kevlin, the camaro driver. He was a doctor. He followed her from L.A. They had an argument in Barstow. 
Wait a minute. Eric Kevlin was a nervous boyfriend. He wasn't a criminal.
I'll check for residue.
Listen I scanned Eric Kevlin's car and clothing with an ion detector. There was no chloroform. He was clean.
Any chance he was in Barstow yesterday?
There were security cameras behind the counter but none of them were pointed out here.
Forget about getting a usable print off that airhose.
Your prints were on the bus.
Front right wheel hub.
Uh ... Mr. Nolan, have you handled any chloroform lately?
You mind?
Would you turn around, please?
So, you figured, I'll just blow a couple of his tires.
Well, I'd hate to be a juror on a case like this.
Reckless disregard for safety and human life mitigated by bad bolts.
Reading my mind.
It's definitely not blood. Wrong color, texture.
It's hair dye.
Who called it in?
There's no sign of forced entry. The bathroom window's nailed shut.
Dog bed, dog bowl, dog food ... no dog.
Triple locks on all the doors. Every shade drawn. State-of-the-art alarm system. As far as we know her place was perfectly hermetically sealed until the cops batter-rammed their way in.
So, how did he get in?
Keeps the sunlight out. GRISSOM: Keeps the eyeballs out, too.
No. I got it.
Tweeze me. Thank you.
So, what do you think?
No, I've seen them this thick.
Yeah.
Oh, and don't forget what's under the bed.
Something that you would have caught eventually ... Crime Stopper ...
No. You know, now that you're a celebrity, you may want to think about getting a new shirt.
What are you looking at me for?
So, he murders her, poses her, yet he doesn't rob her or rape her.
Blood doesn't match our victim. The girlfriend of a Ricco Manzo filed the police report last night. It seems that Adam here put Ricco in the hospital with a broken nose from a fight at bar 9-1-1.
What about Jane's work history?
Medical records?
It's as if she's trying to make herself disappear.
And her boyfriend had an alibi?
Inside her house.
Hello?
Why?
Where are you?
Uh, Gil, there's a, uh ...
Right.
Then why kill her? And why ... leave all this stuff behind?
Interesting collection of toys.
Digital camera ... with a fiber-optic lens.
Digital recorder.
I'm guessing he's got microphones all over the house.
Same question -- how did he get in?
Thank you.
So. Who do we let into our homes every day?
So, we go through her bills and we see which utility companies worked on her house.
You know, Nick was alone. The Stalker could have killed him and didn't.
Not a stick of furniture ... except for a computer and a chair.
What the hell?!
Well ... you're going to love this.
Yup. Now what?
Well. Just think, this is only tape one.
Epic.
Archie, freeze it.
Do you see that behind him? To the left hand of the screen? Can you focus the pixels?
That's the Crime Stopper article.
Do you think he knows Nick?
Well, we should get back to the lab.
Four hundred students, twelve uniform officers, ten minutes per interview. P.D. Should be done by Tuesday.
Four days? We'd be looking for a body already.
Uh, yeah, fine.
Yeah, it's ... it's good, Warrick.
Yeah, well, on missing persons, we can't wait.
Hmm, snappy little sucker. Somebody ought to fix that.
Right.
Yeah, plenty, but not what we're looking for.
Funky.
Wait, stop. Stop, stop, stop.
Looks like, uh ...  Something or ... someone smashed up against this chute pretty hard.
Uh ... between, um ... first and second, I think.
Pizza. Keep going.
Ah. Touchdown. Uh, chute's clear. Looks like trash is picked up every morning. We got nothing.
Hey, Warrick, it looks like we're not the only ones chasing our tails.
Thanks for noticing, Gil, you're very observant.
A five-foot-eleven workaholic.
It looks like somebody carrying... something.
Advance it to 8:27 P.M.
He calls up. Paige says that she'll be right down.
And just like he tells Brass ... he waits 15 minutes. 
Hey, where's the fire, bud? We're just getting started. These security cameras are the only witnesses we've got.
Good idea.
... and there it is again.
All right, you loop around twice you're looking for a parking space. Six times ... 
Is that something hanging from the rearview mirror?
Why don't you zoom in on that.
Right. Why don't you meet up with university parking and cross-reference all silver Volvos.
Oh, and Nick?
When you find the car ...
Silver Volvo. University I.D.
Office hours with the Professor.
Professor Woodbury, you circled the block six times.
And what kind of student was Paige?
We found you. We will find what you're hiding.
Yep. The ring indicates that.
Physical.
Oh, so you cared about her? But obviously not enough to come forward.
Any idea where she might be?
Warrick and I searched the trash chute at the dorm. It was clean. There was no reason to check the dumpster.
So what did kill her?
Point of impact?
Now what?
If it's hers, maybe that's why the scent dogs lost their trail. The odor from the dumpster would've ... thrown them off.
There's some matching chips on the ground. 
It would explain the blunt-force trauma. Point of impact was her abdomen.
Mrs. Woodbury.
But with a silver car.
Paint transfer's green, just like the dumpster.
And we've chased another lead to a dead end.
No one can predict more than a few seconds into the future.
What the hell is going on?
Relevance?
Right, so ... she had to improvise.
Excuse me.
This actually happened to me once before, with a set of keys. Eddie and I had this huge blowout. He threw my keys in the trash. All right, so Paige ... leans over reaches for the trash can.
Yeah, but we didn't give them what they needed-- some closure.
Not always.
Who alerted homicide?
Oh, god! Ugh! I didn't think anything could mask the smell of a decomp.
Me-ow.
You don't look so good.
Oh, bummer.
She could have died of natural causes. Three or four days, pets could have been looking for their next meal.
Or maybe they turned on her.
Floor's covered with trash. Lots of partials. Mostly from animal control boots. But ... I got something here.
Well ... an old lady wears flats or slippers. I can't imagine that this vic entertained.
Cat lover.
No reaction. Knives are clean.
Only 4,000?
But a cat didn't kill her.
My name's Catherine. What is your name again?
Oh, eight and a half. So, I bet you're in the third grade?
You know, I have a daughter. She hates the eight's, too. So, Jessica, can you tell me what you told your mom?
Hey, are you girls sharing secrets? Can you share it with me?
Thank you.
I think that we're done here.
Oh, uh, Mrs. Stein? She hates cats.
Debbie Stein?
I'm here for your shoes.
Eau de match.
Well, a witness heard you scream at her.
You're free to go.
Well, she had an answer for everything.
What are you saying? That she's lying?
Hey!
Well, there goes our only suspect.
Right!
That's the same last name as the vic.
Mr. Elliot, we found your mother's safe. It was busted open and your prints were all over it.
It's also the only open lead in our case. Spit it out, Greg.
Like the blades of knives.
Okay, so ... knives, screwdriver, ice pick, letter opener. We're looking for a weapon with a splash of mineral oil. I'll grab the A.L.S.
Now what?
I thought animal control rounded up all the cats.
Where are you going?
Hi. Girls.
Hi, Rascal.
Okay. Rascal.
All righty. Thank you.
Two against one.
Huh. Well ... single mom ... juggling a job, a boyfriend. It's just easier to say yes than no and then eventually, they just keep asking for permission. You want to tell me why I swabbed their cat?
And we know that our victim had a staph infection.
You know, I spoke with Janet Trent. She and her daughters are all healthy.
What, and she ... gave it to the girls?
So if it was hers, and she... didn't give it away ... 
We know that Mrs. Elliot was killed by this pen. Can one of you tell me what happened?
Jessica, in this room, the only promise you make is to tell the truth.
Who?
What did your mother do?
Jackie?
Girls, do you ... know about fingerprints? When you ... touch something -- like this floaty pen, for instance -- you leave behind an invisible mark that's special, that's yours. I have a way to ... see these invisible marks. And we found these fingerprints on the pen. And they don't belong to an adult.
So Greg said you guys are processing an S-Class.
Now, that's a crime. Oh, this would have broken my ex's heart. Every weekend the guy'd be test-driving another Mercedes. I'd get myself all dressed up make the dealer believe we could actually afford it. Damn.
Except if the car was stolen the ignition lock would be punched, right?
Anyway, I got to go. Warrick and I are due in court. Later.
Ex-chief of detectives. Left to make the big bucks. Consultant with security at every major casino in town and couldn't even protect himself.
And what about the rest of his family?
What about the daughter?
Assumed?
She's gone.
Found a shell casing. 
Looks like one of ours.
So where do you suppose the Chief keeps his gun safe?
Thank you, Scott.
Nice.
Still looking for that Nine .
So you think the Chief might've kept his signature piece someplace else?
Yeah.
So I'm thinking that the wife might be in on this.
What?
So, you saw a baseball cap and sunglasses.
Did you actually see the chief's face 
Any bodies, Joe?
Who is this?
What is his connection to the chief?
Catherine Willows.
All right, let's just be clear. This is a Las Vegas case. This is our victim and we do the processing.
I appreciate the respect.
Hi, Sasha. I'm Catherine Willows. And ... I need to ask you a few questions. Okay? 
My kit. Did the man touch you?
Did he hit you? Did he hurt you in any way?
Well, you know what always happens to bad people? They leave behind a part of themselves and that's how you can help us find your mommy. Now, I need to look underneath your fingernails.
You want to show me what's in your hand?
Where did you get that?
Catherine Willows. Southern ... Nevada.
We don't really work theories. Do we, Warrick?
Uh, no, the chief's little girl is with child services. We're still at the drop-off place.  Yeah, right. Will do, Brass.
Okay.
We got some tire treads on the shoulder. Made an easy stop.
I don't even know you.
Not very far.
If you're lucky, urethral cells with slough off with urine. 
The guy has B.O.?
All this because some showgirl said he smelled sweet?
Uh, yeah, we are. They picked the place. The Shore Club. Later. 
What's taking so long?
48?
Willows.
I don't understand. Why didn't the Feds put this out on NCIC?
Cover you for what?
Yeah, that's Mina Rittle.
Mina Rittle.
But somehow it got preserved in the water. My guess is the plastic was wrapped around her eyes at some point.
Adam Van Der Welk. Little girl saw a monster. Showgirl saw a husband. So this guy could be anybody.
You, too.
I'm sure he's making progress but Grissom rarely says anything until he's good and ready.
You say that like it means something.
Yum. This is where he got the idea.
Ready, honey?
Do you recognize this guy?
Look, you work the door. Anybody come in here in the last 48 hours that bought some of that very expensive tupelo this is Miami.
A limo driver?
Let me guess-- from Vegas.
We understand that another one of your customers bought some very expensive honey from a club.
This customer of yours have a name?
Well, did you notice anything unusual about him? Did he smell? Did he ... have an odor?
Well, we'd like to take a look.
Vodka.
Gin.
Sickly sweet. That's exactly how Grissom described it.
You found a medical condition.
Which I guess could easily be mistaken for whiskey breath. Hey, can you test for diabetic ketoacidosis off urine?
What would a doctor prescribe? 
Absence of c-peptide in the blood. Means the insulin in our guy's system isn't natural -- it's synthetic.
Gordon Daimler. That's the limo driver.
But the scent was still in the limo's AC system. Well, now we have this guy's address.
Who's the owner of record?
Sissy and Dylan Corwin. That's the couple he was picking up at the airport when we pulled him over.
So then maybe that's how he finds his victims -- driving a limo.
Hops over to Las Vegas. Visits the couple he met in Miami. Kills the husband...
...Brings the wife back here-- kills her.
No one's answering inside.
He wrapped her in plastic by the bed, raped her.
If Gordon's true to form, he's going to kill the Corwins.
The boat's missing and that's where he's killing them right now.
Identify the other players.
How? We haven't identified all the players.
Give us thirty seconds.
Gordon, did you drive your limo here? 
He's clean.
Like the lent you their boat?
The husband didn't die. He left us a witness and enough evidence to convict you in two states.
Nah, you got it. I'll have my D.A. call your D.A.
Thanks for yours, actually.
I always do.
Hello.
Nice suit. 
Yeah. Right.
Nothing. It's just ... unusual to see you dressed like that.
Missed me that much, huh?
Dusty, we got no hits on the fingerprints and no one fitting her description has been reported missing.
Okay.
Mm-hmm.
What can you do about the hair?
Sounds good to me.
You do?
The cover girl, Ashleigh James -- she's your girl in the shopping cart. P.D.'S tracking down her agency now. Somebody wanted her dead.
It's not doing anything to gentrify them.
Very much a woman, yet still a little girl.
No, she wasn't a user. But maybe the boyfriend was. 
Let's hope he nicked himself.
Blood in the sink.
None on the floor.
Don't generalize. It's not very scientific of you.
Not exactly the victim's style.
Yeah.
Did you forget to pack? We found men's clothing and personal items at her place.
You run out of drawer space in your place?
I don't know what that means.
So you didn't sleep with her. You just stayed over. You brought a change of clothes, razor blade, toothbrush ... blah, blah, blah.
And what did you do for her?
So, you led her to the slaughter?
That's Cassie. It's the homeless sister.
So, in Cassie's mind, she was a victim here. Makes sense that she'd be angry.
What do you know that's good?
Classic Paranoid Schizophrenic.
Well, if you ask me that's not the only psych evaluation we need.
That poor girl. Definitely lacking in the self-image department.
Well, we know it's not the ex-boyfriend -- no evidence. Not the agent -- wouldn't jeopardize an asset. And if it's not Cassie, who's left?
Cassie James's prints from booking on the left. Prints from the loft faucet on the right. Do we have a prom date?
All right, well ... 
Cassie James was definitely in her sister's apartment.
You're talking about BDD: Body Dysmorphic Disorder.
I knew this dancer. Every night she'd stare at herself in the mirror for three hours.
Yeah. We bagged it.
Which is why Rod cut her loose. She was no longer bankable.
Hey, O'Riley, we got the 419.
Well, good. Then you can fill us in.
You're a Therapist.
And why were you seeing Dylan?
We can always get a warrant to get your records.
Ten o'clock at night. You use your home?
Did you try to revive him.
I can see that.
Goat cheese, goat milk.
Angora.
Sheered, washed, spun and dyed. Angora's 100% goat. You didn't know that, Nick?
Yeah?
Who hasn't? Didn't save my marriage.
Rather I tell them to you?
Yeah, well, this time, maybe she will.
Linen closet, top shelf.
He resisted; you persisted. Then what?
s*x with an underage patient.
It doesn't make you any less guilty.
What's going on with you?
We're on a case.
How many swabs does it take to process a blanket?
The lab tested Dylan Buckley's blood for Creatine Kinase which would be elevated post-seizure ...
You're racing me, Nick. We're driving the same car. 
Nick! 
Nick, I'll have you removed from the case. 
You're confronting suspects before the evidence is processed. You're flying solo, cutting me out. What's going on?
I'm sorry.
Dylan Buckley's. Dr. Sapien's.
Familial DNA.
Naked kid under a blanket at his shrink's late at night and his mother's there.
Congratulations.
He was wrapped in that blanket.
Mrs. Buckley, we know that your son didn't have a seizure. We also know that you were at Dr. Sapien's house with Dylan the night that he died.
What is the blanket for?
So you wrapped Dylan up ... beat the hell out of him and hocus-pocus, he's supposed to love you again?
Somewhere in the middle of an angora birth canal?
So you pushed on him like a mother in labor?
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing?
There's been a murder here. Nothing gets cleaned.
Everything is Evidence. Policy of the Las Vegas Crime Lab. Should we call the Sheriff?
Thank you.
Worse.
Yeah. Till you caught me.
Hi. 
Brass said the victim had a can of spray paint, right? 
Paint from another source. I'm going to find out who belongs to that locker. 
And was this a first or has the deceased spray-painted his locker before? 
Well, that's obvious or a young man wouldn't be dead. Tell me what stick means. 
And Miss Barrett says that a Dennis Fram had been bullied by the deceased all year. He spray-painted his locker many times always something to do with his build. Skinny, shorty ... that kind of thing.
Oh, I'll catch up to you.
Hey ... I need to talk to you.
It's not about that.
So how's your new toy working out?
Bummer. I know how you wanted to see that thing work.
So why did you need the expensive one in the first place?
I'll see you in homeroom.
I was what?
A bully? All right, I guess I was. But, I mean, not the kind that people want to take a gun out and shoot.
Like you, Nick, huh? 
Oh, Nick ... what were you in high school?
Dependable.
Dependable jock, Dependable stoner?
So that leaves you, Warrick. What were you?
You?
The girls didn't even notice your eyes?
Aww ... Well, what do they know? They're your best feature.
Yeah.
There's a reason. I can put him at the crime scene. Jim, can you call them from the car?
Oh ... well. I'll explain on the way.
Okay. But you'll miss all the fireworks.
We've placed him at the murder.
Proves a timeline. The alkyd particles in the victim's spray paint adhere and dry in 30 seconds.
Oxidation. Dennis had to have swiped the paint within seconds of Barry putting it on his locker for his print to take.
The janitor. 
He keeps timed records of graffiti. Job security. And Dennis left paint on the door jamb in the bathroom where Barry was shot.
And then someone killed Barry.
How tall are you?
No reason.
Grissom, we got a suspect. But it's not who you think.
How did you know?
Her perfume?
A high-end woman's perfume. It's doubtful that any other girl at the school wears it.
What about revenge for her little brother?
Wears her dead mother's perfume. Nice touch.
Yeah? Well, I smell a rat in the Fram family.
Dennis?
Well, Dennis, you haven't told us that you explicitly saw Kelsey shoot the victim.
He says that his sister did it.
Oh. At a motel with the high school coach. No wonder she wouldn't talk.
So why is he saying she did?
Hi.
How the hell he'd got up there?
You're serious?
That's a total urban legend. We're scientists, Nickie. No way that happened.
And I suppose you believe in Santa?
There's a consistent burn over this whole area.
Well, the chief said that the original fire was a class C. Downed power line. Winds keep shifting hot spots breaking out all over.
Good eye.
Don't touch it. It'll disintegrate.
Hair spray. Extra hold?
It buys an arsonist a five-minute head start.
So you got an ID on the scuba guy?
Means he didn't inhale any carbon monoxide. 
There goes your theory, Nick. Good try, though. So what was the cause of death?
So, our scuba diver took one to the chest.
Hey, coffee boy. Where's my DNA? Cigarette butt? Match book time-delay device? Hair spray? Any of this sound familiar?
Did Grissom put his stuff in front of mine?
I just talked with your partner. Working this case without me, huh?
Greg Sanders?
Fissure. 
That explains a lot. Acid etching. Not bad.
Pretty smart thinking there, partner.
Okay, N-4-double oh-2, let's see what kind of lead you are.
I'm Catherine Willows, Las Vegas Crime Lab. Detective O'Riley. Is there a Jerry Walden lives here?
Are you missing a scuba tank?
So, let me get this straight, Mr. Walden. You lent Bruce Skeller a spare tank.
Well, he didn't exactly dive in the water.
Excuse me. You said that Mr. Skeller was an experienced diver. Why would he be borrowing a tank?
There used to be something here.
Interesting furniture. What is that, ash wood?
Is that what the coffee table was made out of?
Where is the coffee table?
I, uh ... ... think it needed a little more than that.
Did you bring the file? Well, there goes the foreplay.
Well, I know how you love a challenge. So, what'd the property sell for?
Whoa. Excuse me?
Hmm ... Capitalist's wet dream -- buy low, sell high. So they played it smart.
You can say that again.
I'll see you.
What about the land deed, Ronnie?
What can you testify to?
No.
Where'd it go?
What does it mean?
I'm going to forget that you called me that.
So, you've done your job. I got to go do mine. 
These ash wood splinters are from scuba guy's back?
They only get us something if they match Walden's ninja coffee table.
Radial chains align. Pores match. Two pieces of ash wood, one source. So, Walden and Skeller get into an argument probably over their land.
Walden pushes Skeller he falls back onto the ash wood table.
Which escalates to a punch.
Plenty. Why don't we just start from the beginning. Bruce Skeller didn't die in any fire. He was killed at your house.
He didn't pick up any ash splinters from that forest. It's all Telarosa and Oak out there.
You drove out to the lake, dumped the body ...
... and lit up. 
Not 'cause you wanted a cigarette. You lit up with a purpose.
You figured the fire department would label it a hot spot -- relate it to the original fire and the body would just burn up.
Yeah. Got to love this job.
D.B. ... Mediterranean Casino ... Women's Spa.
A young woman, healthy, just reading a magazine and all of a sudden she DFO'S?
Hey, Brass ... you touch this body?
Well, it looks as if the sash may have been tied by somebody else.
Miss ... you know anything about redressing the body?
Did you move the body here, too?
Actually, it is.
Ms. Marita, did the deceased use the jacuzzi facilities this evening?
It's, uh, not uncommon to drown in a jacuzzi. Hair gets caught in the whirl a person gets dragged under. The hotel wouldn't be considered unsafe.
Oh, I hope that's Shelley Danvers the woman from the hotel spa.
Well, it's about time. You guys finished with day-shift runover, huh?
Yeah, well, the victims' families hate it when we don't.
Good morning.
She didn't drown?
Anything probative?
From?
... cover-up. 
Brass, I need you to get records from that hotel spa -- a warrant, if we need it. Yep, that's right. Bye.
Yeah. Was our girl staying with anyone at that hotel?
We need someone to give us the truth about last night.
And you can verify that when Shelley went to the hotel spa last night, she was going to use the dry sauna?
You said you have proof that Shelley used the dry sauna.
Hotel surveillance would love that. You're sure she used that phone to make the appointment?
That's okay, 'cause we do. ESDA can read this blank paper ... see what's written on it. Up to 14 layers.
That's Miss Danvers' handwriting. We confirm that.
So, Shelley was in here from 8:00 until ... what time did you call 9-1-1?
You moved her into the locker room? Put the robe on her?
From negligent homicide.
I'm up for a shower and tucking my daughter in.
I thought we solved this case. What'd you get?
Don't ring her bell till we re-examine our case.
But the stroke covered up an underlying medical catastrophe.
She went into anaphylactic shock. Coroner says some of the indicators are the same as a stroke: renal failure, cerebral edema.
Because she didn't order it; you did.
We've got a machine known as the ESDA machine which can read pen imprints. 
Well, the machine isolated this. Jeremy, drinks, 10:00. Shelley made that date. That's her handwriting. Were you in the room when Jeremy call?
Well, her allergy kicked in in the sauna under the worst possible conditions -- 
... trachea... larynx ... tongue swelled. 
Oh. You're going to be getting a call from the local papers about spa safety.
We had a victim die of an allergic reaction at the Mediterranean. Some foul play ... some negligence.
That it was an isolated incident ... that in no way should it be a mark against The Strip's other fine hotel-casinos.
Bottom line.
One-on-one with a train. Did she think that she could beat it?
Hey.
Door handle.
Dead center.
To get to the other side.
Well, it's not like we can take this back to the garage.
Where are you going?
Thanks, but you got to give me some guys.
All I need.
Call was made above our heads. Just document the time in your notes.
Thanks.
Aw ...
That's not that far from here.
Okay.
Filament.
Two sets of skid marks.
These skid marks are about seven feet shy of the gate.
Could be an overlay.
Burning rubber. Going nowhere.
Maybe they both are.
Yeah.
So what, the filament's from another car?
Paint transfer.
Hard to say.
You know, this right rear tire's lost a lot of rubber.
Maybe her brakes failed or she had to engage it for some reason you know, I'm thinking that maybe another vehicle was involved.
Maybe he didn't see it. 
10:30 at night?
Black car ... headlights off.
So he hit our SUV. Accidental or intentional?
Maybe not.
Can you isolate the individual tracks?
Good. Lose the dog.
She was flooring it.
Okay, lose the victim's voice and let's just hear the car.
Separate them out.
Day in the life.
We know this how?
Why the dog?
So she works till six?
Finishes packs up and leaves the office.
And that set him off.
Was he a regular?
And what about Mr. Croft?
You want to submit to a lineup?
Let's just cut the B.S. Where's your car?
You got proof of sale?
An accountant who doesn't keep receipts.
I know you've got a temper.
Black Excursion. Turbo diesel.
Gutted.
Well, this is a lot more than a fender bender.
Get some scrapings.
I think I may know what ...
set this guy off.
He spilled his coffee.
Not a good color for Croft.
Coffee on the outside, coffee on the inside. Lipstick on the lid.
Croft chases her from the parking lot caught up to her at the light. 
They said their screw you, screw you's. I think I know the word that made her throw the coffee.
And now she's got a problem.
And she's the pursued. So, she dials 9-1-1.
Somehow she loses him.
That's why she had the emergency brake on.
She could have jumped out.
And that's why you always cut the other driver some slack.
I think we got a van full of tools we can't use. Sand's a nightmare.
You get these haikus out of a book or do they just come to you?
We grab a trowel and some fine mesh screens and we just pretend like we're panning for gold ... Master.
I'm thinking trade-in. Some lowlife gets tired of beating on the old model so he punches her ticket and starts shopping around for a version 2.0.
Not to mention some serious breast augmentation. That is not a Tijuana boob job. Those puppies are top-of-the-line
... at least we've got a pair of saline leads.
Can you grab me one of those?
Dealer's choice.
Dr. Cornfeld? Catherine Willows, Las Vegas crime lab. I believe this is one of yours.
Spare me the sales pitch. We removed that from a homicide victim. I've got a photo.
I'm going to need her name.
I'll tell you what's a shame -- that she was so pretty and perfect and still thought she needed implants.
Trust me-- I've been in her shoes. I got out of them.
They were killing me.
No domestic has a $10,000 rack. Not even in Vegas.
How much business can one sugar daddy give a plastic surgeon?
I'm for fun. Right.
But she didn't drive home.
It's still locked.
Looks clean.
What's that?
Handy.
Bag it. We can get a mold and try and track it down.
Oh, there you are. Mona's car is in the driveway. It looks clean.
And you will be...?
I feel like I'm trapped in the Marquis De Sade's brain pan.
Waiting for recess.
Didn't Grissom say he found some flecks of silver on the victim's back?
I may have found the source.
Hmm?
People are just as twisted in their own living rooms. The props are different here. That's all.
Everybody, Nick. Wake up and smell the species.
Just because you never did it doesn't mean you never could.
Hey, relax, Nick. All I'm saying is you're human.
There's one thing you learn on this job is that human beings are capable of anything.
We don't technically have a warrant.
Oh, that's not what I was thinking. How much does this place clear a week?
I'm not with the IRS.
I don't make that in three months.
Plus, the outfits are cooler. 
You got a good thing going here. And the best part is that these guys think getting slapped around and getting humiliated is their fantasy.
You got a daughter?
Really? Mine's seven.
Yeah.
All my mother ever said to me was Cash up front.
I take that as a compliment.
Well, death is still a man's business and I don't have to tell you about police work.
By knowing myself and working hard ... and by not taking any crap from powerful jerks who are used to giving it all day long.
These are the masks and straws I took out of the sink at Lady Heather's.
Oh, nice. Mmm. Yeah, that's the idea, Greg. Two straws per mask.
And not much more through straws.
Actually, I've got the yang and you've got the yin. This is as far as our watch will go. So that's on her wrist. No air bubbles. Good job.
Hm-mmm. That's from the trash can.
Wow. Looks like there's a few carats around that bezel. And the band. Major bucks. 
Oh, and, uh, computer graphics system keyed up the video system. Just hit it.
Yin and yang. Top and bottom. It's definitely not a man's watch, but unique.
Well, are you missing any personal property? Jewelry? Small valuables? A watch, perhaps?
Before you do, Mr. Nelson, in the last year, did you buy a diamond watch at Maarten's jewelers at the forum shops?
Why do men always make everything look so tough?
A $20,000 watch and he didn't discuss it? He's lying.
He tried.
Did you order a $20,000 custom made watch from a jeweler at the Forum shops?
No. We'd just like to see it.
Is that the trip you look to L.A. with your boss, Ronald? Let me refresh your memory. You shared a suite. Very cost-effective. What'd you save there, two-three hundred dollars?
Sometimes, that's all it takes.
Latex. Like Hansel and Gretel, we just followed the bread crumbs all the way home.
Too late.
Played in any sandboxes lately Mr. Nelson?
Mr. Nelson, you're very emotional right now. Why don't you just take a moment collect yourself. Let me get you a glass of water.
Psychologically, she was a surrogate. In fetish club terms, she was a slave. Cameron would put a mask on her face and cover her body in liquid latex.
Cameron couldn't dominate you, so he dominated Mona. Only his last appointment, he got carried away.
I just realized that you and I have a very healthy relationship.
Well, when we have a problem, I don't paint Greg Sanders in latex and stick a straw up his nose.
Gil ... you're supposed to say something revealing back to me.
Can you imagine living out here?
Peaceful? The town just lost five percent of its population.
Yeah, in a population of 20.
What's the rush? Crime scene's not going anywhere.
Not an expectorate. Potato. Blown to smithereens.
Now, why would an assailant need silencer way out here?
We just got the call. The place is open 24 seven. Why'd it take so long?
But now without getting his picture taken first.
You're joking.
Real or fake, it didn't work.
Hey, don't knock it. It's still the best tool for lifting prints off cardboard.
Blow and print.
Easy. Jump the counter.
Lay it out.
How old is the killer?
Shoe size is five, six tops. 
Fluorescent powders?
Protocol's black.
Assistant coroners is four hours late and we are stuck out here until he transports the body. And I haven't heard from Grissom ...
I should've never been sent to this remote scene in the first place. I've got seniority. I deserve -- no, I've earned the right to pick my cases.
If I start eating, I will shut up.
Since when do you care about your appearance?
Sorry. 
We can't touch it.
Oh, thank god. It's about time.
So, uh, what took you so long?
Anything on the shoe print?
Well, at least, we're not chasing a kid.
We ID'd on from the open/closed sign.
No. Not so great. State trooper.
Yep. Well, I'll just beef him to his captain.
Tammy Felton.
A fugitive and clinical psychopath that Grissom and I put behind bars. She tried to play but I didn't bite. 
Her biological parents posted bail and then she bailed on them.
Tammy was kidnapped as a child. Raised by her kidnapper. When she found out the truth, she killed him. Hey, finish running the prints.
Tammy uses people. She wasn't alone.
Grissom!
You don't read memos. Do you remember Tammy Felton?
She's back.
She's been to Calnevari. She's a prime suspect in our convenience store homicide.
Just get to the point, Greg.
Wait a second. There was potato on the bullet?
There was potato on the bullet because there was potato inside the barrel of the gun.
Right. One of your armed robbers may have used a potato as a silencer prior to the heist.
Maybe.
He ran with Tammy's father, mostly from the law. 
A regular Bonnie and Clyde. Just what Vegas needs.
Same gun. Two crimes. One case.
What makes you think it's the right car?
Let's go.
It was dumped.
Detail ... pop the trunk.
Thanks.
It's Tammy.
Hey, Doc.
She didn't put up a fight, did she?
She was killed by the one person in life she trusted.
Darin Hanson stared her in the face and she never saw it coming.
I'll run them against Darin Hanson's DNA.
How did they sound?
They finally know where she is.
We found Darin and Tammy's prints at the convenience store. Hours before the heist, gets murdered.
Which explains why he killed Tammy.
Epithelials on her neck are a match to Darin's DNA.
Why kill a man for a few hundred bucks when you're about to steal a hundred thousand?
Play it again.
Let me guess. Laughlin, cottage casino?
I'll meet him at the station. Call you with an update.
You going somewhere?
Good idea.
Surveillance tape from the Tower Club Casino. You ducked before there was a reason to cover.
You forget about Darin Hanson? Your car was covered with gray dust-
And it still doesn't explain why you went to see Darin.
Darin Hanson shot Adam Brower but you might as well have pulled the trigger.
Yeah, me, too. He confirmed a fourth. Darin plus three. Just like Laughlin.
And he's still out there ... flush with cash and a .45 caliber.
Bobby D.
We need your help.
What else?
Narrow it further.
Just one. It's out of left field. About 75 miles out.
Where did you stash the cash?
I can answer that. It's all in a day's work.
A potato silencer muffles a bullet but won't silence it. You went in your gun drawn.
You should have arrested them. But something happened, didn't it? My bet, Tammy made you an offer.
They still had pockets full of cash from the Laughlin job. They offered you a finder's fee.
You patrol on 97.5 square miles. Is the calnevari mine a part of your jurisdiction?
That's right. We make the big bucks.
$250,000 turned a career cop bad.
We all do.
Birds of prey beat maggots to a body-- impressive. Gunshot. Entry just below the cheek. Not much blood, no blood pools.
Where exactly is here?
Perfect place to dump a body.
No longer a John Doe. Got a name and a rap sheet. Jace Felder, busted for selling meth in '98. His prints are in AFIS.  Your turn.
His eardrum's gone.
We found him on an airstrip. Maybe he was too close to a jet engine.
Looks like it could be from a harness or a seat belt.
What was this guy? A Top Gun?
Well, this was no plane. Marks are too narrow. No center wheel, and ... when was the last time a plane lost a rearview mirror?
Two?
Man, you are way ahead of me.
Right. And you only lay down treads when your wheels aren't rolling smoothly. Panic braking? Sudden boost of acceleration? Race?
Drag racing? 
Ah ... 
Yeah. Kids end up dead.
So your brother's cooler than you.
Foreplay is foreplay. So, when do they race?
They go all the way out to Frenchman airfield from here?
It rained last night. Rain brings up the oil from the streets. They got to go somewhere to get some traction.
More power, no extra weight. Every girl's dream.
Nitrous oxide as in speed?
So the sudden boost of acceleration could account for the treads back at the airstrip.
Hey! You deaf?
A jackhammer is about 50 decibels quieter.
So, Thumpy ... you blow out a lot of eardrums?
Hey, Thumper! How about we impound your car, seize your stereo system and charge you with disturbing the peace?
Yup.
Well, Thumpy G said he was an artist. 
Yeah. So how long you been racing cars?
And you're costing us time. We're investigating a murder. 
That's right. 
Works of art.
Silver spoon kid. You got a copy of the check?
Tossed it?
No.
Yeah?
Where?
Who's the seller?
We'll take the car.
No glass no paint flecks, no personal effects. It's been cleaned.
Well, if he was shot in the car there's got to be some blood.
Well, the only void is in the driver's seat. Means it was occupied by our victim, Jace Felder. So he was shot in the head, left to right. Spatter on the passenger door is from the exit wound.
He was shot while the car was in motion? Bled out while the car was rolling?
I want to meet this killer.
Wait a minute. Let me, uh, let me get in on this.
What were you thinking? You-you took the car?
And what does a person's life go for?
And you didn't think to call 911 or anything like that?
Jackass.
Opportunity knocked.
You race Jace Felder the other night?
Sir, we're investigating a murder. Jace Felder was shot and killed.
Tony ... tell me about the race.
From what I hear, Jace Felder was ... Mario Andretti. Why would you...?
Why would you risk your Michelangelo against the best?
Where's the gun, Tony?
We'll be back with a warrant.
So, I looked into Rita Del Nagro's death. The accident report says hit-and-run. It was a two-car collision. It's still open. An arrest was made, but the suspect was released due to insufficient evidence. Now, guess his name.
Gives Tony Del Nagro plenty of motive. He lost his mother. Wanted revenge.
Well, if it looks like an accident the investigation would be abbreviated..
No full-on autopsy the bullet could go undetected.
You guys rock.
So, we know the bullet can make the shot ... let's go see if the driver can.
Hey, thanks, we'll take care of them for you.
Love to.
Always thinking there, Nicky, aren't ya?
You just try to keep up.
Thank you. Good night!
You were in the car. Why didn't you just tell the police?
Revenge is best served cold.
Single gunshot wound to the chest, through and through. Entry wound is massive. 
Unburned gunpowder. He was shot at close range.
Car door ... is closed ... but not latched. Vic was in a hurry?
Good question. I don't see any bullet holes.
What's this? Ah, blood and hair. Maybe the vic got a piece of the perp.
Yeah, I know what that's like. I got a kid at home myself.
Ah, you know what, get it off your chest. It sucks. You're living for everybody but yourself. But you know what? You're still breathing.
Did you see a license plate?
Can you describe the vehicle?
Yeah, you need a cannon to fire a hunk of lead that big.
Anything that might have hit it would have ripped right through. Thing's probably still moving.
Hey, Greggy, any luck on those blood and hair samples?
Hmm, spoken like a man who's never hit a jackpot.
Hmm.
Thanks, I will.
Bobby.
Desert eagle?
Had O'Riley run the vic for registered firearms. It turns out that Roger Mitchel purchased a magnum research desert eagle mark-seven three weeks ago.
Right, well, you know some men feel the need to compensate. 
Yes, it does. Beer drinker switches to bourbon. He's got himself a brand-new gun. He's just looking for a fight. Statement is, bring it on. 
So, full of liquid courage, he hauls out the big iron. 
But a drunk is not hard to disarm.
And the perp walks away with the murder weapon.
Well, that's three miles from here. That's walking distance.
Ooh, neighbors.
Hey, do you smell something?
Something ... fruity.
No. I never wear perfume at work. It dulls the sense of smell. 
A-ha. (CATHERINE picks up a fruit and smells it. Mulberries.
Hmm. Hide-a-key.  Empty. Anybody else know about this?
Looks like Roger's got a mulberry tree. So, Ned, we found mulberry branches in your pickup and there's a mulberry tree in your dead neighbor's yard. I'm starting to like you, Ned and not in a good way.
Let me guess, um, Frank Craft lives in the blue house on the other side of the fence.
A regular Mister Rogers.
Check this out.
Something.
That's a hell of a bruise you've got on your chin, Mr. Kraft. How did you get that?
Recoil's a bitch, isn't it?
Do you have a dog?
Let me guess. Citizen Ned doesn't want to get involved?
Well, I guess he doesn't want to be seen talking to us.
Yeah, that's becoming really clear. Check this out. Kraft was stealing cable from Edmonds. Edmonds cuts the line. Hate thy neighbor. Did Ned mention anything about Kraft's dog?
I'm starting to think the victim may have taken care of that.
Not enough detail -- we'd never get a match. We can't check Kraft's property out without a warrant. But ... 
You like jigsaw puzzles?
Uh ... depends.
Ah, and you're confined to the lab, huh? Well, hey, look, it's regular hours. I mean, go have dinner with the boyfriend ... Hank, right? And, and ... go, go to a spa.
Sara, I don't make the rules around here. You've got to talk to Grissom about that.
What makes you think he's going talk to me?  Get some rest.
The key word here: Retaliation. Roger Edmonds cuts the cable that you stole.
Of course, he was.  So, then you ... chop up his tree ... 
... borrow Ned's truck to dump the branches ... 
Shut up. This isn't about Ned. It's about Roger. So ... while you're out dumping the branches, Roger comes home and sees what you've done to his tree. He ups the ante.
You return home ... find your dog ... start looking for Roger.
Something else you ... borrowed?
Hey ... I heard you know your Greek mythology. I'm impressed -- never would've guessed.
Yes, you are.
So, where's Nick?
Well, good work, you guys -- both of you. Would you let him know?
I'll see you around.
You, too.
Closed that murder I was working. A man's life for a dog's life for a mulberry tree.  Sometimes I wonder if people are meant to live together.
Then you'd make a great neighbor.
New case?
Oh ... bugs.
Enjoy.
Body in a meat grinder. Sounds kind of mob-ish except they left town in the '80s.
Good god...
One of the strongest bones in the body. Probably what jammed this grinder.
It's like that Morrissey album - Meat is Murder ...
Blood's everywhere. Phenolphthalein and luminol are useless.
Yeah.
I think I can handle this.
Well, everything's pretty much plumbing. Male into female parts. Righty tighty, lefty loosey.
Grinder plate.
Blade.
The worm.
Except ... all the employees wear them.
It's Debreff. 
It's a five-star restaurant. I've eaten there.
Excuse me, but you don't understand.
We know. He's dead. 
Coroner made a positive identification.
We found traces of aspic and olive oil under his fingernails. Means that he went into the meat grinder without showering. Possibly straight from this kitchen.
I don't know. Would you?
We can shut you down for hours or get a warrant and shut you down for good.
People always think that the show is out front. It wasn't till I waitressed I realized it's all in the back.
What are you looking at?
Yeah. What? Caused by a candle?
We have the owner's consent so, again, could you explain this blood?
Hey! We found blood spatter on the uniforms of several employees who worked the night that Chef Petrov died.
Macho.
Apparently not.
Lucky you.
Some things never change.
Cocaine.
Blood, coke, semen. These people were doing everything in this kitchen but cook.
Blood clot. What is that, sand around it?
Well, one thing's for sure: The blood got there before the sand.
Well, that depends on what we find.
25 knives in, and I'm bust.
Oh, now we're cooking.
It's not blood.
Ground it up. We're thinking that you did the actual filleting.
We have. They won't talk. Military calls it code red.
Fierce loyalty to the top dog. I guess Petrov was that until somebody killed him.  His tragedy is your promotion?
I bet they'd forgive a murder, Les.
Code red?
Greg, how's the knife coming with that mysterious smudge on it?
Nail polish.
May I see your nails, please?
Oh. Well, I'm going to need a sample of that polish. A scraping.
Yeah. That'll do.
Okay, the, uh, three of you can go. Thank you, ladies.  And I've got a table for you. A five top. All by yourself. By the window. Someone will be with you shortly.
So that sample I collected matches the polish on this knife. 
You handled this knife.
Kitchen's first rule: Don't touch my knife; don't touch my Johnson.
Did you stab the chef?
I'm aware of that.  But when a transfer is made on a blade it's usually from slippage. Due to a stabbing motion.
No. But why don't you have a seat out in reception. Things could change.
What'd you find?
How did we miss that in trace?
Sand. Right -- for balance and precision.
Volcanic sand. Long way from home.
Never been to Japan, but I've seen this sand before ... on the blood clot.
I'm going to guess Shakespeare.
A murdered chef in your kitchen. Kiss of death for a restaurant.
Code red, in fact -- protect the kitchen.
Some people say that the most important part of preparing a meal is the cleanup.
While the fillet man disposed of the chef parts you got rid of your bloody woolen suit.
All in a day's work.
That's not all they're missing.
30 miles in every direction. Pi-r-squared. That means that we're looking at a ... 2,800 mile search area.
We're up a tree and you're quoting Poe. Give me something.
And what about the iris?
Color distinction means the body's been dead less than 48 hours.
Well, I've got foil ... a leaf ... a feather and plastic.
Seagull feathers.
But only when the fishing's good. And we got some ground limestone.
Means they know where to shop. 
We found the eye here. I bet she shopped here where limestone is used as ground cover.
The landfill manager says this is the active cell. Spotter says cell lift moves forward 20 feet a day. That puts the active cell right ... pretty much in front of us.
You are what you throw away. 
Well, this onion is our time line so peel back accordingly.
I think I may have something here!
Got a leg.
Obviously.
Okay, so, uh how hot do you think it is, underneath all this trash?
So this is yesterday's trash. Dead body. Minimum 18 hours in this heat.
Yeah, she's not.
Yeah, I think they only finished the job. How did she get here?
Heard you got to be superhero today.
Got anything on our lady of the dump?
So we've got no arms, no prints. What kind of identifying characteristics do we have?
Well, that narrows it down to more than half the women in this country who gave birth.
You're my hero, Al.
I thought, uh, disc replacement surgery involved fusing bone to bone.
Oh, well, I like those odds.
Tourist?
Yeah, every last one on storm cloud lane.
I talked to the president of the owner's association.
A return visit.
Well, that makes five.
Let's see if any of it's human.
And that's our house.
Any idea how it got there?
Do you know an Amy Ennis from Austin, Texas?
So, you have absolutely no idea what I'm talking about?
I'm just asking your father a few questions.
Divorced?
Well, we know that she had a kid.
So, what, we've got nothing?
According to Greg, the hairs and the DNA from the toothbrush are a match to the vic. What about the prints from her car?
Amy Ennis.
Well, Amy Ennis is our vic. It's her car.
Kelly Easton ... Easton ... 174 Storm Cloud Lane?
Leave town.
... Want to Mulligan on your first story? Divorced?
Well, maybe you gave her a reason to leave. Spousal abuse, cheating...
Okay, you didn't kill her.  At least back then.
Could place Mrs. Easton at the house.
Did you know that she was back?
Yeah, sure. Nora, I'm sorry. I know this has got to be very hard on you and your brother.
Is your dad seeing anybody? Does he have a girlfriend?
Mrs. Easton was a brunette.
Lack of swelling, clean fractures ... she was frozen.
Skin and muscle would've lost elasticity. Fracture planes would've passed through in a straight line.
Well, the garbage tells us how she was killed. Now I want to know who.
That's what I figured.
Okay, this is all great, but, uh, why the 9-1-1 page?
The daughter. Dad did have a new girlfriend.
From your father. Diamonds and platinum, that's, uh, pretty fancy.
Why?
Everything?
Is that it?
Nora ... I'd really like to help you and your brother, but I can't unless you talk to me. 
We found evidence of you in your father's bed.
Are you lactating?
You're pregnant.
You sick son of a bitch. Did you think we weren't going to find out she was pregnant?
Oh, stop it. Your daughter.
Cut the clueless routine.
Your wife came back and saw what you were doing. So, you killed her, and you tried to buy off your daughter with a diamond bracelet.
Your daughter's telling a different story.
I'm going to nail you for murder.
More like the immaculate perception. Pseudocyesis -- imagined pregnancy.
Fantasizing. Wow.  When the desire to become pregnant is so strong hormone levels can change, setting off all the biological signs of pregnancy.
Swollen abdomen, lack of menstruation, and sometimes bilateral galactorrhea. Milk production in both breasts. Leaking can be brought on by stress.
Emotional or physical stimuli cause prolactin to shoot through the endocrine system, ending in the mammary glands, and triggering the cells to lactate.
About all the women in his life.
The bracelet was mom's. Greg checked the epithelials.
Nora, is this your shirt?
Can you explain to me how your mother's blood ended up on it?
Well, you told me that this bracelet was a gift from your father. He claims that he bought it for your mother.
I think you feel the same way about your father.
And then you put your mother in the freezer and you waited until trash day.
It's not a story. It's what the evidence tells us really happened.
I know. You take care of things.
And all you wanted was the one thing that you couldn't have.
You were innocent, Nora. You're not anymore.
Good defense.
How it manifested? No. But the cause?  People throw things away every day.
You think?
Okay.
Hey, guys. Catherine Willows from CSI. Could you all clear the residence, please?
The victim's well-being takes precedence over everything. Right now, this is Joanne Crooks' apartment, not our crime scene. So ... there's the door.
Thanks. Thank you. Appreciate it.
Joanne ... all the guys have left. 
It's just me. I'd like to ask ...
Well, I'm not a cop; I'm with the crime lab. I'd, uh, I'd like to process the bed sheets ...
Well, would you allow me to take samples from you?
Look, I know this is really horrible.
Washing away evidence hurts any chance of finding out who raped you.
If you let me recover that evidence, we can stop him from doing this to somebody else.
Well, then let's get him for what he did to you.
Greg ... get anywhere with the semen I recovered from Joanne Crooks' hair? I sent it back with an officer.
That's impossible.
Oh, the trailer before the movie.
Hey, Grissom, thanks for the lift.
Grissom, uh ...
Grissom?
That must be some good evidence. 
No. It turns out the semen in the vic's hair was pre-ejaculate, which, of course ...
... carries no sperm, therefore, no DNA.
So, I got this poor woman's hopes up for nothing. How about you?
Unsolved ... any of these women get a description?
Well, I guess half the problem's the name-- Peeping Tom. It just sounds so innocuous when, in fact, peeping is the first step in the evolution of a sexual predator.
Well, we know what road this guy's on. It's just a matter of time before he rapes and murders.
Victims' profile: Both women are single, under 30, live right next door to each other in a large apartment complex.
Uh, no crossover so far. Doreen Bainbridge works in the corporate field and Joanne Crooks is a dancer, so feels like completely different social circles.
Well, it's possible this guy's so new he doesn't even have a record.
Hey, how's it coming?
All right.
Hey, Jacqui. Grissom's print any good?
With one hand, anyway. Okay, well, that's a lot of distortion.
So can you enhance the ridges equal to the amount of the slippage?
Well, I'd run AFIS last. I doubt if he's in there; he wasn't in CODIS.
It's kind of looking like that.
Justin Lamond, 18. Non-gaming card.
Oh, and look at that. He lives one block from the crime scene. Thanks, Jacqui.
Hey.
Well, that's what he looks like.
I'll be this way.
Jim. There, that's him.
Justin Lamond?
It's a spy camera. What, you can't peep in apartments during the day so you come to the mall to sneak some thrills?
Put him in the car.
We found your fingerprints on her window.
Well, remind me to give you a medal. 
Stand up. Step down. Both feet.
It's not a match.
Three-size differential. He was obviously outside Doreen's apartment, but he's not our guy.
Try to keep it on ice.
What's up?
Yeah.
Yeah. With glass. Reflective glass.
So our suspect stepped in wet maintenance paint.
Which could tell us what direction he's coming from. Let me call my guy in the department of transpo.
Still charting recent toms?
He's a C-level man.
And he gets there on foot, from east of Avon.
Closing in on it. The city painted double yellows down Taylor Road last night. Started at 10:00 at Avon avenue. The paint crew goes three miles an hour. That puts them at Taylor and Cedar -- the victims' apartments-at approximately 20 after 10:00, just before the attacks.
Quadruple it.
Predators get smarter with every attack. It's been in the news. He may be wearing gloves this time.
Aren't you coming?
High profile case, technicalities ... that can't be why you do this, why you hang back and hide out.
Right. I didn't think so.
Supervising. So I'm listening to news radio on the way over here and they're calling him the sliding-door rapist.
Polite?
He's just more savvy. There's less evidence for us to work with. I know, exactly.
I just have a few questions. First off, what were you doing at those apartments?
Try me.
So you decide to start your search in the dead of night when there's a rapist on the loose.
Oh.
Well, Wendy did okay. Um, the problem I'm having is that those apartments there's always an availability so, um, kind of gives you a plausible excuse anytime, anywhere, doesn't it?
Oh, I like those shoes. What size are you?
Eight and a half, huh? Do you mind if I look at the soles?
Hey, how would you feel about allowing me to look at all your shoes from home? I mean, it'd be strictly voluntary.
A young, white male living in a targeted neighborhood -- I'd think you might want to, you know, help rule yourself out.
Of course you do.
Yeah. 
Oh. Uh, Mr. Reed. If Wendy attacked you and you're innocent, I'd think you might want to file charges against her. How come you didn't?
You sure? I wouldn't want you to do anything you didn't believe.
We'll take a report.
Agreed. May I please take that swab?
I'm going to need that jacket, too.
Wendy, I can't discuss an ongoing case, but what I can tell you is if we're going to get this guy, it'll be because of what you're giving us right now.
Really.
Greg, I don't want any other cases jumping mine. This is priority.
Mm.
Unknown subject, five months ago breaking and entering, burglary.
But we do now.
How's your chart of escalation?
Was one of your original burglaries located at 13200 Appian way?
Where our guy Taylor Reed cut himself on the glass. So, we've narrowed the epicenter down to a single block-- Appian way. I'm thinking if we find something overlooked at those early crime scenes on Appian, we can tie it to our sexual assaults.
You're the poet.
Looks like somebody is still awake.
We'd like to come in.
I'm going to take a guess here. This apartment came on the market five months ago. The old tenant was bothered by the breaking and entering, the bloodstain that you left behind. You moved into the apartment you committed your first crime in, didn't you? 
You weren't looking for another apartment. You were looking for ... 
... another victim. You got something to hide, Reed?
Jim?
Jim, we need an ambulance!
Miss, are you all right? It's over. It's over. It's okay.
You're late, Eddie.
You know how much this meant to Lindsey?
Nice perfume.
I'm sorry, baby. You did good, though.
Hey, and you know what? It's just a play.
I'm sorry, honey.
Okay. Let's go home.
You sure about that? 
Okay.
Eddie? Ed? Hello? Uh ... bad connection, Ed. Uh, I just entered a scene. I-I'll call you later.
D.U.N.S.
Mm-hmm.
Parchment changes of the skin. So what's the exposure to that window, south?
Right, all that spring break activity with the frat brothers ... 
Eddie? Ed?
Lindsey's with him. Maybe she's ready to come home.
Cash and a very busy passport ... designer threads. Ten-to-one, Croix Richards is a drug dealer. And that is no workout accident.
Eddie? Eddie, you've got to get to a land line. This connection sucks.
Lindsey?  I-I can't hear you.
You're alone? Well, honey, where's daddy?
Uh ...  uh, yeah, honey. Yes, yes, I'm coming.
It's going to be okay, honey. I'm on my way.  Do you know where you are.
Are you near a lake? Are you near grandma's house?
In the car?  Lindsey, can you get out?
It's going to be okay, honey. Just listen to me. Before the car crashed, where were you going?
On the way there, did you see any hotels?
Excalibur. Did you see, did you see the pyramid?
Industrial Road? Is that, is that it? Lindsey, is it industrial road?
Lindsey? Lindsey!
Lindsey? Lindsey!
Hang on, honey!
I'm here, honey.
I'm going to get you out. Hang on.
Okay. Listen. I have to break the window, okay? You've got to move to the front.
Okay, I'm going to come around, okay? I'm coming around.
I'm here, Lindsey. I'm going to go down. I'm going to go down.
You all right? You okay?
Yes? I got you. Hold on.
Never, never, never, no. He loves Lindsey. He'd never do that. Not willingly.
Be careful with my car, boys.
I don't know, baby. I ... I'm going to go look for him, though. I'm just going to be right over there.
I want you to stay here with Detective Vega. Okay?
Knowing Eddie's taste in women, I'd say that's a good bet.
Did he have anything to drink? Did he have a beer, a glass of wine?
You remember, Lindsey. Just think about it.
Why did you stop there?
You mean he left you in the car alone.
Willows.  Yeah.
Croix Richards and Trey Buchman. Same profession, same employer, same cause of death.
Not your typical male M.O. Lady Heather a suspect?
I'm okay. Lindsey's ...  ... We're okay.
Thanks, you guys. 
Why don't you catch us up.
Especially for repeat crimes.
No, thanks.
Extra-marital s*x to help your relationship problems?
Mrs. McCormick, did you meet Trey Buchman at Lady Heather's? 
Well, Mrs. McCormick, I'd like to get a sample of your hair and DNA for comparison.
So she lied to you guys at the hotel, she lied to us at the house. She's been with him, not just online.
You even think about my daughter again, I'll kill you. I will kill you. 
I will hunt you down and put ... I will put you in the ground!
I've been here a lot longer than you ... 
And I wouldn't have to be here if you were doing your job properly.
You're going to tell me what I want, huh?
Grissom!
We got a problem.
Stranglings are intimate. Crime of passion.
Mr. McCormick ... were you the one who found your wife?
On the stairs?
May I see your hands, please?
Other side. 
They look clean.
I don't know. If it were my spouse, I would've touched the body.
So you're calling it?
What a great bedtime story for my little girl.
Yeah, makes us VIPs tonight.
No, thanks. Oh, it's not luggage. Thank you, though.
You said you had a situation in your casino?
Well, until we know the victim was taken over state lines, the FBI has no jurisdiction. Do you have any contact from the kidnappers?
Whose five-year-old boy?
Mr. Tombs ... 
We're with the crime lab, and I'm assuming that that's our ransom note.
How many of you touched this letter?
Did this note come in an envelope?
We have a better chance of getting uncompromised prints off of this.
The casino's fronting the ransom money?
We strongly advise that you don't hand over that money.
Any unidentified prints?
So prints don't help.
Liquid extraction results.
Nicotine. So we're looking for a smoker -- menthol smoker.
Body's in an unnatural position.
His body's also coated. Makes me think whoever did this didn't even stop the car. 
Something had to have gone wrong.
Mr. Tombs, I'm sorry, but in a crime like this, an autopsy's mandatory. Evidence from your son's body may lead us to the suspect.
It's not your call anymore.
Hey. Why don't you let me handle this?
The foam around his mouth?
Well, that could be from roughhousing with his older brothers. What about this bruise?
We haven't found the scene.
We already have.
Tramelle.
Ms. Willis ... is Tramelle your only child?
Why wasn't she with Tavian's other kids at the carnival?
Oh, yes, I've been there. Works wonders on the disappointments of little girls.
Pill casings.
I see a USP number.
Looks that way.
So, our kidnapper had contact with dogs.
Hey, how about a vet?
Acepromazine maleate. Tranquilizer.
I'll call Brass. I'll have him check vet clinics, kennels, pet supply stores, and we'll extend the radius out from the dump site.
Or a guy who knows how to finish.
Visible match.
Tramelle, where's your mother?
So, Tavian was paying Bridget child support -- three grand a month.
Well, he made his deal with Bridget when Tramelle was born. Bad timing for her.
And it is his son. I'm sure he would have paid any amount. So, how does that dog kennel guy Price figure into all this, and was killing him part of the plan?
In her act of redemption, she gives Tramelle to Tavian.
How about the driver?
That's Sara's boyfriend.
Some happy hour, huh?
Hank.
Yeah, not your granny's oldsmobile.
So you going to tell me how it went?
Yeah, you don't answer their questions, you're looking at more days off without pay, and that blows.
Nobody mentioned it, but the camera's there. Big brother knows.
Motor oil. 
Hitting the curb could've caused the car to buck.
Traffic light, intersection, curb. Well, either the car wasn't working, or the driver wasn't. 
Looks like the newspaper dispenser used to be here.
She tried to stop, but it was too late.
Oh, hey. So, I got photos of the restaurant patrons off the DMV database and input the information per the restaurant seating chart and the police report. 
Who's Elaine Alcott?
Oh, well, she was seated with Hank. I just thought maybe that ... SARA: Oh. 
Anyway, um ... apparently, she told P.D. that she was returning from the ladies' room at the time of the impact.
Okay. 
Um ... okay, so, we've got 36 people in the restaurant. Twelve worked for Sillmont Healthcare, a block away. Another ten were from the brokerage firm across the street, a couple of regulars, a few out-of-towners and restaurant employees.
Wow. She sped through that intersection -- 52 miles per hour.
There's only one way to find out.
Hey, check this out. The red light camera clocked her speed at 52 miles per hour, right?
The computer software pegged her at 60 by the time she hits the newspaper dispenser. She accelerated into the building.
I'll call Brass. If Lambert had a grudge against the place, somebody there should know her.
Let's run it.
Okay ... top to bottom.  Cameron Black, deceased; from Jersey. First time in Vegas. Unlikely mark.
Table three: Hank and ... Elaine Alcott. Also works at the insurance company.
Yeah. Maybe you should.
Hey.
So, how did it go with Elaine Alcott?
Well, that's certainly more evidence to suggest that her actions were intentional.
Dial the number.
Right. The Checkerbox is at 16 North Meadows.
Well, GPS is hardly perfect. Maybe north was a directional default.
Well, did she have some kind of problem with her policy?
Well, this member is deceased. Not even the doctor-patient privilege extends postmortem.
You know what? Four people are dead. Don't waste our time. We can take this downtown.
Well, what exactly does that mean?
In other words, Mrs. Lambert's health was in limbo. She wasn't receiving treatment, but she couldn't file an appeal, since you hadn't officially denied her claim.
Time Mrs. Lambert didn't have.
.... and while you were following your procedure, and postponing a decision, her cancer cells were multiplying.
For what it's worth, that makes me sick.
Yeah.
If you were aware of your grandmother's intentions and programmed the GPS, you're guilty of aiding and abetting in the murder of three people.
Uh ... well ... Corey, homicide has informed us that your grandmother had a life insurance policy, in which you're the sole beneficiary.
I'll meet you at the car.
You got plans?
You want to get a beer?
Ugh!
Soap mummy.
All you need is a little moisture and enough time.
Anaerobic bacteria digest body fats, converting them into a waxy solid.
Kind of like the way they make vegetable shortening.
Five, six weeks, minimum.
I've seen it done.
Mmm.
What about the foot? It looks as though that's been sheared off.
Industrial accident?
How about an axe then?
Body in a drum in the middle of the mountains. Well, if the head and hands were missing, I'd be saying mob hit.
So, I.D. from dental records is out. How about DNA? Bone marrow may still be viable.
It's your kitchen.
Hey, Grissom bailed. You guys are with me.
Yeah. His name was Christian Cutler.
He wasn't in CODIS. Department of defense registry. He was in the army. An E-5 sergeant, honorably discharged three years ago. The guy drove tanks.
Hard-core mechie.
This place seems lively for a warehouse.
Hello.
Metal weapons, money, competition, testosterone.
Look available, be unobtainable.
He found his body stuffed in a chemical waste drum from this warehouse.
I take it this Chris was not well liked.
Is this a machine shop or a junkyard? 
I guess this is what passes for pinups with these guys.
So this must be Hammer of God. Or at least what's left of it.
I think we just got Ginger.
We traced the machine shop back through a holding corporation.
Well, we found this in Brian's station -- your fingernail.
Yeah, they also scratch. There were skin scrapings under the nail. We tested the epithelials. They're Christian Cutler's. Your shop, your fingernail, your waste drum with the dead guy in it.
And you didn't think this was worth mentioning?
So, that's the price of doing business?
Here's the way I'd call it ...
Cutler-Comma-Christian. 
Never went to college. That part wasn't in his service record.
They don't match. Okay, so when Christian died, Brian wasn't controlling the bot.
Well, we know it didn't. It was responding to a different control frequency.
If he did, he was protecting somebody.
Look available. Be unobtainable. Except when you're trying to beat a murder rap.
Well, you are the queen bee. The drones line up to service you.
Does it have a name or did it come with the wallet?
Puppet master. Somebody else was pulling the strings.
So, what's the range of those controllers anyway?
So, if somebody hijacked Brian's bot they'd have to be nearby, but ... obviously, out of sight.
Well, there's a good place to hide up there. Opportunity.
Ooh, proud papa. The man who built Hammer of God.
And look what's missing: 84.
So ... what happened?
You couldn't kill Christian's bot so you killed Christian.
The bot wasn't the only thing you manipulated, Luke.
Brian gave you up. 
I know what it must've been like for you. Having created something, only to lose it.
Yes, I have a daughter.
Uh-huh.
I guess the only flaw then was you.
Whoo! Theaters are like nightclubs; they should always keep the lights off.
Was there anyone else here?
With you?
Yeah, somebody beat him to it.
And nobody saw anything?
Professional killer?
Mr. Siskel, Mr. Ebert, may I have a Cause of Death, please?
Well, what movie did you see this in?
Or necklace. Oh!
Butterfingers.
Hey! I wasn't the only one who dropped something tonight.
Soda.
Popcorn.
It wasn't the cleanest theater in the world. I just want to match the blood to our victim.
Uh-huh.
We're with the Las Vegas crime lab. Do you know a Gus Sugarman?
Well, we know that Dr. Sugarman called you at home two minutes before the movie started, and that you didn't pick up.
And you were here alone?
Can anyone verify that?
Still screening?
We'll be in touch.
Don't tell me -- Greg won the bet.
Oh, great. Let's, uh, go back to Audrey's and see if we have a match.
And she was going on a date with this guy?
Did you happen to notice if she was wearing gloves?
Excuse me. 
What happened to the garbage that was in the can in the lobby?
So, the gloves match the palm print on the murder weapon as well as the pay phone in the theater lobby. Unfortunately, there was no epithelials inside the gloves because the cleaning woman had ammonia on her hands.
Well, obviously, she didn't make it home in one minute.
Well, if she couldn't afford a powerful attorney, how did she pay for a hit man?
She used an extension cord and tied it to the railing and must have jumped off.
Our only suspect apparently commits suicide.  Convenient.
No signs of a break-in ... or a struggle. She may have been killed by someone she knew.
Yeah, she was dragged over here, tied off and shoved over.
You got something?
Maybe she threw it away.
Well, there's an awful lot of water damage, but, um ... there's some kind of an impression.
Strangers On A Train. Is that the one with the perfect murder?
Life imitating art?
So if Audrey is Farley Granger ... 
Sphere E4-117. Well, that's got to be the Sphere Hotel.
Locker, safety deposit box ... 
Yeah.
E4-117. Your assigned parking space. It was written on a movie schedule we found in Ms. Hilden's home.
Have you ever seen any Hitchcock movies?  Strangers On a Train?
So, get this -- Anthony Haines had a sexual harassment suit filed against him recently.
Uh-huh, from one of the showgirls.
She claims that he threatened to fire her if she didn't perform certain sexual favors.
... if Audrey hired the same firm? She did.
Knees bothering you?
Well, any physical evidence on those gloves would've been compromised by the ammonia.
You're looking for transfer.
Langly &amp; Langly.
Oh, it's the law firm that both you and Audrey hired to deal with your problems -- Gus Sugarman and Anthony Haines.
Well, we're guessing that that's where the two of you first met, at the lawyers'.
Right. Right. I mean, either way, you ladies had a lot in common.
Oh, yeah.
You needed them both dead. 
So, right out of Strangers On A Train, if you swapped murders, no one could tie you to the victims, and then you started talking specifics -- where the best place would be to kill Haines. Someplace dark, secluded-- the parking lot right here at the sphere.
And then you walked out into the lobby and called Audrey on the pay phone, to say that the deed was done.
She was the one who picked the movie ... and made the date.
You'd killed for her. Now she wasn't holding up her end of the bargain.
The only thing that she had on you was that movie schedule. That had to go.
Hi. What'd I miss?
Mm. This one of your favorites?
Okay. Well, what do you like?
DA just got the call. Tom's manager hired Marjorie Wescott to defend him.
Guilty, rich client, high-profile case it's right up her alley. Publicity for her new cable show.
So, we'll take the suite. It's the penthouse, right?
I could live in that bathroom. So, I've checked every plumbing fixture in this place. There's no blood.
And that sheet looks like a butcher's apron. Movie boy had to wash his hands someplace.
Tonya.
Then, showing consciousness of guilt he washed the blood off in this room which is right around the corner from his suite. 
We found dilute blood in the sink, pipes and ... footprint ridges there.
Did you lock your car when you helped this driver?
Our evidence is solid. We can't let 'em take us out of our game.
Oh, that's what lawyers do; especially when their clients are guilty.
Yeah. What typically drags on for months has now been put on the fast track and the prelim is less than seventy-two hours.
You're going to have to call in help, because if the judge thinks that our evidence isn't strong enough to go to trial he's going to dismiss the charges on Tom.
Sure, but the odds are that Tom will relocate to Europe and pull a Polanski.
Marjorie's requesting copies of CSI's proficiency test records, by midnight.
You completely forget, don't you? My test is on appeal.
Board said I was wrong on one question. I said the question was ambiguous. They're going to rule my way, but not before the prelim.
Just trying to rattle me.
Maybe I should just take a page out of your book. If I don't collect or analyze anything I don't have to testify. Of course, it helps to be boss. Very politic. Ecklie must be rubbing off on you.
Remember, if you get stuck just maintain the same posture. If there's any adjustments, you're seen as squirming. It's going to make you look shifty.
Well, I've done it longer.
Hey, any luck?
Better keep looking.
What?
Date, time and file number?
The dice places Tom at the murder. Victim's blood mixed with his saliva.
Did the judge exclude the dice?
We'll send him right in.
Night school, yes.
That's correct.
For a very good living.
Technically, yes, but it's on appeal. I'm confident that I will prevail.
No.
Grissom ... they're beating our heads in. Judge is going to dismiss -- you can feel it.
I'm not ahead of myself. I'm up there front and center taking hits along with the rest of CSI. You know, you've turned into a really lousy leader.
I need your help, and you're on the sidelines.
Tom Haviland ... away from the set, between films and ... in paradise. 
Buh-du-bum.
Maybe he slipped on a banana peel.
Hmm.
Hi, David.
Well, there's no foam on the mouth. No discoloration around the lips. Pupils aren't dilated. No overt evidence of a drug overdose.
What do you see?
What are you looking for?
Oh, china ...
So, who has access to the green room?
All right. I would like to see everyone's wallet. I don't need to see your identification. Just open your wallets.
Thank you.
Thanks.
That's more than I needed to know. Thank you.
When was the last time you used this credit card?
Well, that's between you and the D.A. The preliminary tox screen on Dougie Max came back positive for cocaine.
It was in his blood.
Cocaine on the foreskin, or any skin, for that matter, is not a stimulant; it's a numbing agent.
Sounds frustrating.
I don't have to run any tests. You cannot absorb enough cocaine through your pen1s to OD.
I don't have a source. 
Whatever.
Cocaine levels are less than .05 milligrams per liter. Way too low. That's not what killed him.
And what were the levels in the vic?
Ooh. Dougie Max was poisoned.
Because Spam can't be absorbed through the pen1s, and if you ask me to cite my source ... 
Death by chocolate again?
Hmm.
Information.
Dougie Max's Innoko water bottles that were on the stage his last performance -- who set them up?
Well, besides you and Dougie, who had access to it?
Well, you've got a temper ... and a record. Assault. Club in Tucson.
Oh, hey, listen. I checked the bartender's medical records. The guy's had six different prescriptions for migraines in the last two years. Guess which one he's on now.
Total recall. We pulled 140 bottles 
... of Innoko water off the shelves in this store alone. There's 500 convenience stores in Vegas. We need to get this product off the shelves now. Grocery stores, restaurants, wholesalers ... I mean not to mention the population of informing the people ... 
Yes, I know that we risk panic, chief, but I'd rather risk that than have another victim.
We need to find out what's in there.
Right.
So, we've got two bottles of poisoned Innoko water -- one from a comedy club on western, the other from a convenience store halfway across town.
There may not be one; it could just be random.
You know, they never caught the guy who put the cyanide in the Tylenol back in the '80s. They found out how the bottles were tampered with. That's where safety seals came from.
No, nothing yet.
Wait a minute. It's in the threads.
We've got a bigger problem than we thought we had.
I'm not looking at you.
We think that we nailed the tampering method. The poison wasn't inside the bottle. It was on the bottle cap.
We think that the killer dripped a solution of naratriptamine into the threads of the bottle cap.
Capillary action pulled the solution into the threads, where it dried into white crystals.
Right now, that's the way it looks.
Right. But how did it get there?
There was a coffee grinder in the green room at the Comedy Hole.
All right, gentleman. Good afternoon. Could you line up for me, please. Right up here, please.
Right, well, I can see you all know how to open your mouths, so ... good.  Ready? 
Just give me an O.
Oh, well, then maybe I should use a rectal swab.
Good boy. 
Okay, who's next for some foreplay
Funny.
Where to start?
The horse?
All right, let's talk about Lori Hutchins. What can you tell me about her?
And she always traveled down below with the horse?
So nothing unusual.
Trainer had all these small syringes. Why go for the big guns instead?
Steward said he brought her some dinner.
Guess she wasn't very hungry.
Work boots, I think.
Oh ... a J.P. Tod's driving loafer.
I may shop the outlets ... but I read vogue.
Hey, man, I don't want to go blind any more than you do.
Oh ... looky here.  Little DNA party.
Ooh. Bloody towels. 
Hi, Dr. Stevens.
How's she doing?
How about losing a trainer?
Thank you.
Is this some kind of food?
We'll need a blood sample. We found a tranquilizer gun in the container. We want to double-check it.
We'll still need that sample.
Equus caballus?
Thanks.
How about the dart in the container?
Owner of the plane.
Steward who brought the vic her dinner.
Concierge ... interesting.
Those brown shavings that we collected from the cargo hold and the horse's teeth were tobacco. More specifically, of Volando and Colorado Maduro.
Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar, but when it does not contain propylene glycol, an additive used in the humidification process ... 
Dominicans are just as good, but, uh ... they're legal, so, you know, where's the fun in that?
Your handy concierge.
Uh, why don't you help us, since you're so good at getting things like Cuban cigars?
It's still the law.
Well, we found your prints on the rail going down into the cargo hold.
How about we talk about DNA?
By who?
Are you being cagey?
Harper.
Yeah?
What happened?
Define critical.
Really? Well, check this out.
I don't think it's pixie dust. And ... lots of red lentils.
That Dr. Stevens was very involved.
Why did he leave one behind?
And ran.
He had a partner.
No. Um ... so, based on the six-to-one lentil-to-diamond ratio in the packet we found, and assuming that all the packets are the same size, I think we're looking for ... five more.
Well, yeah, based on weight, uh, we've established that approximately 183 grams of lentils per pack...
Oh, my mistake. Four.
Conflict diamonds? Don't those fund warlords and support child slavery?
Well, that would explain why someone felt the need to smuggle them into the country.
And if Lori were about to find out, explains why someone would want to kill her.
What have you got?
What?
Carrots on the karats.
After she fed the horse, evidently.
So Dr. Stevens didn't have one partner, he had two.
She was a victim, but she wasn't innocent.
Okay, so, we've got a dead woman, a dead horse, a runaway vet, and ... a couple million dollars worth of uncut diamonds that are unaccounted for.
But why would he smuggle them into the country only to smuggle them out again?
Well, you met her. Would you be her friend for free?
Rhone Kinsey-Confer. Hey, what if we were thinking about this whole thing a little too globally? I'm going to find out what Rhone's mother's maiden name is. 
She may have sold me my engagement ring.  Brass, check out Kinsey Diamonds. 
Find out if the owner is related to our Concierge.
Yeah, well, we'll log it in tomorrow.
Yeah?
Oh, the ever-popular DFO. 
Right up there with the mysterious dude defense.
I wouldn't be surprised. Wife had two priors for spousal abuse. Seems pretty straight up to me.
Yeah.
Although I'll take it when I can get it. These nannies do not work cheap.
She got caught fighting at school.
Ah, she lost her dad recently. She's just having a hard time.
This won't take long, Greg. We promise.
Did you notice anything prior to the explosion? A power surge, a spark, a smell?
Yeah, we're done. Feel better, all right?
What a mess.
I'm thinking spiral with an overlap.
I'll head this way.
Damage radiates from here.
Yeah, so it's not a high explosive.
Yeah. That narrows things down.
Somebody left the hot plate on inside of the fume hood. 
Presence of acetone, methanol, all kinds of combustibles.
This.
We understand that you handled a meth lab yesterday.
Well, our report is going to reflect the fact that an active heat source was under the fume hood.
Hey.
Blue.
Hodges' pan wasn't the source. It got pushed out.
By this. High primary frag.
I did.
CSI Brown and I had collected evidence on a case involving a woman whose husband had collapsed. We suspected poison. When we returned to the lab ...
Not yet, no.
Right.
I didn't know that at the time.
It's my responsibility. I didn't follow procedure.
Because there's 24 hours in the day and I'm pulling 16 for the county, spending three pretending to sleep and the other five lying to my daughter that everything's going to be all right.
What do you want to hear? I screwed up. I'm sorry.
Late.
A while.  I got a little time on my hands.
Yeah.
Yeah, and, um ... I wanted you to hear it from me.
What a day to come back to work.
Coming?
Wrong place, wrong time.
These guys were pros.  How much did they get?
Whoever did this knew precisely what they were after.
All right, good. All here. We've got a lot of work to do.
Grissom...
Grissom?
Well, I was thinking that we need to start processing this bank.
Check the tape anyway.
Where?
The coroner?
What have you got?
I'll take any part of that bullet.
Near decapitation. Wire's still around his neck.
Tells us something about them.
We got prints. Getaway driver. Larry Whiting. 29.
He was convicted of assault and drunk and disorderly five years ago. Did some time.
Mm-hmm.
He doesn't. 
Well, it is his hotel. It's his call, ultimately.
Mmm.
I may be compromised. You know I have a personal relationship with the guy.
Well, his record caught up with him, Sam. We suspect he was involved in the First Monument Bank robbery. Getaway driver ... except everyone got away but him.
Sam ... That's like you telling me when I was a kid that you were too tired to drive home every night when you were sleeping with my mother.
All right.
Well, last year, one of your cocktail waitresses is murdered. Still unsolved.
And this Whiting guy worked here at the Rampart ... They're both your hotels .... How does that look for business?
Right. They made it go away.
Well, this is my business. It's not going to go away.
Wow. Almost looks good as new.
Kind of.
That's the box they were after.
What is up with the bank manager? We've been waiting forever.
Hey.
How long have we known each other?
I'm serious here.
Can you hear me?
Oh, not some, just one. Box 729.
Oh, no worries. 
Benny Murdock?
Yeah.
He died a couple of weeks ago, right?
Did Larry Whiting ... know Benny?
Informally.
Ooh ... that is Old Vegas, Sam. Sunset on that time. I hear you and Benny had a little sunset of your own. A falling out about six months ago.
Benny.
Well, I wish we could.
You know what off the record means, don't you, Greg?
Good.
Grissom?
What do you think?
Well, unless the answer's in that fortune cookie, what's the plan?
Just run it. After that, give us an address.
Oh, well, that is... one example of the evince going up in smoke.
Box 729.
It's some kind of fabric. Silk, maybe. What do you make of that?
Pink panther.
Maybe has something to do with this fabric.
Until they made him disappear.
Well, all three were carrying, so they're not tied up, and they're still armed.
It's not a dump job. Killer drove them here, killed them, and drove away.
Never let a man do a woman's job.
They didn't get all their makeup off.
Let's just hope he stops.
Bloodstain. Rainbow-colored thread. Safe deposit box. Those guys are definitely the bank robbers.
I hear scissors, I hear murder. What did I miss?
Rampart.
He's not returning any m my phone calls. I just need to confront this Sam Braun business once and for all. I'll drive.
What do you mean?
Surgery? 
Your hearing?
I'm sorry.
What can I do?
Oh, eh, mm ... that's it?
Tangiers, pike's gambling hall ... Where are the Rampart scissors, Sam?
Uh-huh. I'm sure they went to a good cause. How much money they make?
I think that we're past playing games, Sam. I need the truth.
Oh, yeah. Now more than ever.
Why would Benny ... do that? Why would Benny ... murder Vivian and then keep the incriminating evidence, not even attempt to wash off the blood?
Let me just get this straight. To protect Benny after he's already dead, you hire Rob Rubio and three cronies to commit Federal Bank Robbery to steal back a pair of scissors?
We have the safe deposit box in our possession, Sam, along with the bloodstained sash the scissors were wrapped in. We recovered two different blood samples -- one belonging to Vivian, and the other unknown. I guess I didn't have a good enough reason until now, but ... I tested my DNA against the unknown sample.
And wouldn't you know ... there were seven alleles in common.
It means that you and I are biologically related. You killed her, Sam ... and Benny covered for you. 
Part of the old double standard. No woman that you're with is ever going to be with another man.
Oh, now, that holds a lot of weight. To this day my mother still sits at home waiting for your call.
Science ... tells me that you did. So, yes, I do.  It's just such a lousy way to find out that you're my father.
Hey.
I just wanted to see you. And I didn't want you to go in without wishing you good luck.
'Cause she's a babe and he's ...
.380 auto caliber.
Well, gunshots do a number of your face, so typically, women prefer pills.
Well, you do the math: Dead female spouse plus missing husband ... equals murder.
All right, look, I read rooms for a living. That closet was tossed. The carpet lit up. So I'm going to ask you again. What were you doing in there besides copulating?
Right. Well, we found this laptop on the vanity still on. You didn't play with it, too, did you?
And we have a right to protect the crime scene.
I can't tell you anything until I get all the details. I'm sorry.
Ms. Newman. Would you come with me, please?
Ms. Newman, is this your ex-husband?
Virtual tour. Right on, Archie. Before and after photos of the crime scene.
You know your art. You a collector?
Oh, I haven't been yet.
A docent. So, you think that's legit?
You'd be surprised. The rich go cheap to stay rich, you know what I mean?
Please.
And, uh, what happened to the sculpture?
You saying somebody lifted it?
Put your house on the market your privacy's up for grabs, too.
Quite the saleswoman. 
Down, boys.
Hey, Archie, freeze it.
Who's that in the background?
Like the Peter Croft sculpture.
Oh, it is. 
Oh, you're innocent in all this?
I'm going to need that DNA sample.
Great.
Say, ah.
Her stepson, Max. Did you get any DNA off the cigarette butts?
Max, we found two sperm donors on the sample from your stepmother. Your father's and yours.
What's your shoe size, Max?
The kid didn't do it. Look, we found the father's blood on the underside of the pool ledge.
So there was a struggle in the water. 
Right.
Well, do you recall living in San Diego?
Oh, it just might help jog your memory. San Diego's a military town. Your sister married a guy in the navy, right?
Well, we could go someplace else if you'd like. 
How about your house? It's up for sale.
Well, you see, we didn't have enough evidence at this point to get a warrant, but you put your house on the internet. I didn't need a warrant. Gave me complete access via this virtual tour. And all with your permission.
That's you ... that's Peter Berglund ... and that's the Pacific.
Yeah. You hired him to kill your ex-husband and his new wife.
No, but it did give me access to Peter's financial information. 
Loan application. Two signatures -- Peter Berglund and yours. You cosigned for Peter because he couldn't qualify on his own. Payment for the hit. He gets your house you get your ex-husband's money.
The thing about murder for hire ... there's always a paper trail.
Look who's back in town? So, what happened, Drew? You didn't like ... Idaho? Is that it?
Yeah, right. So, what have we got?
Always did.
Hi.
Willows. 
You clear the place?
Okay.
Yeah?  Okay. Cool.
This your first time on body watch?
Well ... alive ... it's inside your bowels. Dead, it ends up on the floor.
Go. Go, go, go. Just get some air.
Suspect on location! Suspect on location!
Out back.
He went out back.  I'm all right. I'm okay.
Warrick ... ease up. My fault. I sent him out.
Hey. 
Yeah. I'm all right.
Don't touch me. 
I'm evidence.
Hey, um, hand me a swab, would you? 
Damn.
All right, um, hey, uh, turn around.
Privacy. 
The guy bodied me full-on. I don't want trace to miss one hair or one fiber.
Suspect on location! 
He was drinking. 
It was beer. Warrick: I'll go process the back. 
Denim fiber from the cabinet. Could be nothing. And lots of smudges but no prints worthwhile.
Based on ...?
So, our home invasion robbery may be not a home invasion after all.
What are the marks on his forearms? 
Z?
There was a z-mover video game on the floor next to the vic. Murder by z-mover.
One ends up killing the other.
I didn't have time to be scared, David.
I was scared ... and I still am. 
Don't tell anyone, okay.
Got your beep. What'd you get? Warrick: Denim fibers at 400x. 
Cooking grease.
So there's a good chance the victim worked in a fast food joint.
Something his employees would definitely know. Get any addresses?
I'm going in. Warrick: Well, the guy assaulted you. You don't have to put yourself through this, you know. CATHERINE: I don't, I'll be scared of the next guy and the one after that.
Transfer works both ways.
Warrick?
Blow your nose.
Guess.
Then I guess I'll just have to look for myself. 
Nose hairs ... are nature's filter. Traps all kinds of things. Dust, dirt ... 
... fingerprint powder.
You did it.
You inhaled the fingerprint dust I was using.
Yeah.
What's the name of the band again?
Yeah, that was good to dance to.
I'm guessing that's the road manager.
He does not look too happy.
Gus Kenyon.
Heroin. If this was an overdose, why leave some in the syringe?
Wait a second, what's this? Doesn't look like a bruise.
What's that?
By someone else standing over him?
Easy ... if you're capacitated.
We understand that, sir, but this is a crime scene.
Then you knew he was a drug user?
You're kidding me.
So what killed him?
Air bubble.
Shock. Suffocation. 
Explains why he didn't throw up.
There was heroin still in the needle. Why didn't it make it into his system?
Oh, right, on his index finger.
He wrote every song.
His name's on every title. If they were splitting up and he took his songs back ... 
We need to get back to the crime scene. I'm looking for ink.
Why do they want us off this bus so badly? 
Standard printing ink. 
What to do when your cell phone's not working?
Gone.
Seems like nothing on that bus does.
Oh.
Bet it matches that smack we found on the needle.
No ... but somebody did. 
I got a smudged name. Dean.
No surprise. Cash cow, everybody does it.
I'm chasing the phone book.
Samantha Dean? I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab. Do you know Gus Kenyon? 
Gus Kenyon looked up your number and address in this directory and, uh, called you last night ... 
... from a phone booth outside of his tour bus. Records indicate the call was made around 2:00 A.M. 
It lasted 20 seconds.
So it rang?
What's your son's name?
Yeah, yeah. I have a-a daughter who is nine. Yeah, I know how hard it is to do it alone. 
Now those are some cool shades Brandon has on. Are those Silhouettes? Those are expensive. 
All right. Thanks for your time.
There.
There.
Samantha Dean. She knows him. She's backstage with him.
Backstage with a rock star. Trust me, it's a big deal. See that VIP pass around her neck? That's like diamonds.
Girlfriend?
There was a scuff on Samantha Dean's door.
Uh-huh.
Kick ass.
And it's not so much that this girl in the photograph looks exactly like you. It's that the sunglasses that Gus is wearing ... familiar?
Very rare, custom-made graduated lenses. Your son is holding them in his hands. 
Were they a gift for him?
He has his father's eyes. The two of you met on a video shoot in Vegas six years ago. 
Last night ...
: ... Alone and depressed ...
...He just decided to look you up.
He knew immediately that it was his son. Any father would. 
For some reason you had kept Brandon a secret.
Gus gets angry. He can't understand why you won't let him be a parent.
You've changed a lot since your days with Gus. You were protecting your son from his father's lifestyle.
I just have one other thing, Miss Dean. I'm just guessing that when you found out you were pregnant that you stopped listening to Gus' band and that you haven't heard any of his latest songs. 
I'm drying up like rain and sand without you wiping away my tears with your hand, you saw through the lies that make up my disguise I need you back to set me free just give me one last chance come back to me. I think that he wrote this for you. I think that he loved you very much and ... that he missed you.
I think that I'd rather have my daughter know a bad father than no father at all.
Grissom ... a stay. New evidence appeal: Hair analysis. I already over-nighted the six pubic hairs found on the victim to norfolk -- Department of Criminal Justice -- for mitochondrial DNA analysis. 
Defense thinks DNA's a magic pill for exoneration. I doubt if it's going to change the outcome. 
You don't know what I'm talking about.
People v. John Mathers. Serial. Western LVU. I was a rookie ...
All sexually assaulted, but no semen was found. Suspected he wore a condom. 
Case with the strongest evidence was victim number three: Charlene Roth. Mathers, a campus security guard got Murder One for that.
I put a rush on it.
First to exhaust all of his appeals and get an execution date. 
How many have you had?
Mathers was convicted and sent to death row by a jury of his peers. I played a small part. I presented my findings ... 
Okay. I haven't figured out how I feel yet. 
Yeah. Old case, new eyes, new technology. 
That was before DNA. Now that the case has been reopened I can re-evaluate all three murders. We always thought Mathers was good for the other two, but if they overturn Charlene Roth with the new DNA, we can go back and try Mathers with the other two murders with the new evidence.
You pro or con?
Yeah.
I try not to give it much thought. I stick to the work.
Campus police found the victim Charlene Roth in this trash bag.
Who's working the print lab tonight?
Apples and oranges, Greg. Fifteen-year-old hair samples no roots, room-temperature storage.
Yeah, that's how we stored hair evidence back then. Microscopy was king.
And you are how old?
Maybe so, but face it, Greg you just don't have the equipment.
Well, maternal lineage is good enough on this one. No one else on Mathers' mother's side is a suspect. So, if it's a match, the stay is lifted he's back in the chamber. If not, we're back in court.
Jacqui ... I'm so glad you're back on nights. Got a good one for you.
Give it some vacuum metal deposition. 
And, um, super-rush. You're in a race with the federal lab.
Second grade, tons of homework.
Hmmph. Now I know why I missed you so much. So, page me as soon as you're done.
Yep.
I would like a vanilla ice soy blended latte, please.
Yes?
I'm sorry. Do I know you?
Mr. and Mrs. Roth. I'm sorry. I didn't recognize you.
You know any news has to go through the attorney general's office. I can't divulge any information on an open case.
I was confident at trial. I'm still confident. The evidence is solid.
Uh, well, you will have an answer very soon. I'm sure of it.  Excuse me. I need to go.
What's going on? I'm not on call.
Which memo?
Mather's attorney is going to have a field day.
Right.
Body dump. Just like 15 years ago.
Not yet.
May I?
What do you think this is?
That's what I was thinking -- bug.
Two-fer. Looks like some kind of a bug casing and black fibers.
She's all yours, David.
How come I get you?
I'm glad to have the help.
A little too familiar. Let's figure out how she got here.
Debbie Reston, 17. She was taking a night class at Western LVU. Pre-req for early admission.
Yep. Just like Mathers' other victims.
Mm-hmm. Doc, you were here back then. Tell me why this one's different.
So she's been dead at least 12 hours, right?
You know that I can't confirm or deny any information regarding an active investigation. Excuse me.
Ms. Campbell, I have no personal opinion about your client. I tested the evidence in his case and that evidence failed to exonerate him.
What suspect? I can't help you.
Ms. Campbell, I am only an interpreter of the evidence. I know how to make the evidence speak to me. I don't care about the outcome.
Yes, what the paint was all about.
Not what he was looking for.
I found pieces of this in the victim's hair. What's it look like to you?
They spend their whole lives waiting for the end.
I found some more glass.  Looks polarized.
Yeah.
Make it up to me. I got a new case. New bag.
Great.
Why did it come to you?
I do.
All six hairs are a match to Mathers. 
He raped and murdered Charlene Roth. 
How are you coming with that twist tie, Greg?
Yeah.
Good. Keep working on it.
Slam dunk on Mathers.
Yeah?
Oil-based? That's for canvases, not railings.
Okay ... he knew what he was doing. Expanding his window of opportunity.
And the paint matches Western LVU shade of blue. 
Well, is there anyone in the art department who was here when the first murders took place?
Say I wanted a badger hair paintbrush -- where would I buy one?
Janet Kent-- the first victim?
John Mathers is the copycat.
Oh. Hey. Mathers' execution's back on. The Roths asked me to sit with them.
I just need to do it.
It's like your first autopsy ... your first murdered child. You can make it through that you can keep doing this work.
Well, that's the difference between you and me.
Hey.
Thanks.
Gang member. 
They were all in the bathroom.
I got a gun.
Put up a couple of booths we could have ourselves a gun show out here. 
Smith &amp; Wesson .40. High end.
And bringing them to Vegas for target practice. Great.
How we doing, Bobby?
The bad news?
Could be biological. I'll send it to trace.
Three guns found at the scene. None match the bullets recovered from the victim. What does that tell us?
Means he likes his gun and may have used it before.
Firing pin impressions and breech face marks a closer look.
They get a conviction on the suspect?
I bet I could find where he stays in Vegas.
I guess Tiny's mother can be proud of her son for one thing. He sure knows how to clean a room.
Who's that?
What's his Dealio?
The man?
Why didn't you get a warrant for his room? 
Hello.
So are we. Do you mind if I ask how the man got the burn mark on his neck?
I guess you are hot. 
Contest all you want. It's still coming after the fact. Open.
Well ... Jerome is under the misguided impression that he's a one-man pyrotechnic display. Watch too many movies and kids start to think that people actually shoot like that.
If his DNA matches what we found on the shell casing we'll be able to extend the scope of the warrant.
Look, we all know that you forget what the word Loyalty means as soon as you step away from the mirror so what do the Snakebacks get you?
I thought that's what college was for.
So crime pays.
Right, you don't make the rules, you just exploit them.
In this case, The Man makes the clothes ... and produces the music ... and represents the athletes ... when he's not involved in street shootings, of course.
As far as he's concerned murder is just another way to separate himself from the Calvins and Ralphs of the world.
Klein and Lauren. Fashion.
Speak for yourself. The only thing between me and a wardrobe like this is a few extra zeros on my paycheck.
The mojave. Highway patrol is out looking for our guy. Odds are that Tiny Tim is back in L.A. Evidence disposed of along the way. That means my last chance of connecting the dots is somewhere along these racks. Fibers, GSR, blood.
Calling card?
.380 automatic. Tiny's favorite piece.
Same as it always does.
Wrong place, wrong time. It doesn't take much to set someone off.
The snakebacks kill a vandal. Then the vandals kill a snakeback.
Round and round and round it goes. Where it stops, nobody knows.
Yeah, it should. arterial spray was real.
I've got several envelopes here from various private shipping companies.
Dead trail. 
I got Archie to digitize that film blow up a head shot of our victim.
Thanks, Sulik.
Find any fingerprints?
Won't help. Pornos buy short ends from legitimate clearing houses. Saves money and they're impossible to trace.
I pulled a porno ring using teenage girls a couple years ago. Learned all you want to know about the adult entertainment industry. 
Hell of a way to go.
FBI's official position on snuff films in the U.S. Of a? No such thing.
Single film goes for hundred grand ... original negative.
Greedy doesn't mean smart.
Oh, nothing. Only difference between Kitsch and beautiful is time.
Well ... Sara, you take that one.
Warrick, you go there, I'll go in here.
And painted the wall.
Right.
Arterial spray 
Yeah, maybe.
Oh, I don't think snuff makers cross a line, I think they start on the other side of it.
Where's that security guard?
You should try a scalp conditioner.
Your dandruff.  Oh, my bad ... primer. Alkyd-based. Never comes out in the wash but you already know that.
Warrick?
You stabbed that girl.
Oh, touching.  Arrest him.
Look, the Security Guard just left the room. You see the door shadow right there ... at the foot of the bed.
Well, then, that's our guy. There's got to be some way to I.D. him.
What about the rest of the room?
Roll out. Camera slows down, the last frame stutters gets hit with more light. 
Right. Good editors always cut the roll out.
So all your editors' cuttings are in there?
Bins of sin.
Yeah, industry policy. Ever since '98. Even have a quarantine list: Who's positive, who's not. And that security guy wore one, too. Pretty surprising for unregulated p0rn.
You did?
Thank god.
Hot frame, all right.  I still can't see who it is.
Good eye, Sara. 
Yeah, that Kitsch lamp. Somebody moved it out to the lobby. I'll have Warrick go back to the hotel and grab it.
Guy thinks he's Zalman King, playing with the lighting.
Saliva.
Guy replaced it with a red bulb. Got residual saliva on it. I'll process for DNA, run it through CODIS.
The same Douglas Sampson who did three years for sexual assault and battery?
Take a break.
I bet I could guess your exact height.
We've got you on film, killing her.
We've got ourselves a film student here. DOUGLAS SAMPSON: I'm one of the best in adult film and I'm going to be making the jump to mainstream, you watch.
Financed by a snuff film?
Getting a cold? Maybe you should raise the heat. I'm sure they wouldn't mind.
Hey, what do you got?
Butterscotch?
Yeah.
Bidahochy range. Butterscotch-colored soil.
Great.
He's working evidence from the riverbed.
Any chance of finding any serration marks on the bone?
There it is. 
Tested positive six months ago.
Yeah, right. The rule is, the actor tests positive twice they go on permanent quarantine.
Walked right into her own death scene. The thing is ... p0rn director may have, too.
You still have those chills, Mr. Sampson? Feeling hot, achy? Back of your throat scratchy?
Original flu happens at the onset of HIV. Seroconversion. Usually presents two to six weeks after the exchange of fluids.
That temperature is your body working up a resistance to the virus.
A private lab can run a virus test within a day. CDC doesn't broadcast that. Tests are very expensive.
We had that lab do what's called a phylogenetic analysis of your HIV's DNA and Susan's.
You did stab her, though. And at that moment 
... her arterial blood hit your eyes entering your body through the conjunctival membrane.
Where the new HIV cells immediately started attaching to your healthy white blood cells. Gets inside one, replicates about 2,000 times. Disables the host cell, pinches back out, infecting more good cells ... lowering your immune system until your body loses its ability to fight off even the simplest invader. 
But for now, we got you. 
You killed her.
Hey.
I do, but I left these on my desk.  I'm on my way to Circus Circus with five nine-year-olds. It's Lindsey's birthday. Got to wrap a Bridal Barbie.
Funny. Oh, blue ... gun shot residue.
So it means that he may have fired the revolver that you and Grissom found in the park?
Right. Hmm ... but maybe Grissom can.
Yeah, I just passed him in ballistics. He was meditating on your revolver. Didn't even look up.
Mm-hmm. 
Thanks.
No towels, either. Someone took a few souvenirs. I'll check the surveillance tapes.
It's not her room, either. It was registered under the name of Parker.
You heard that?
You're back.
This is very weird.
Yeah, and it starts there, ends there. It's not very deep.
No ligature marks. No defensive wounds.
She sat there and allowed someone to slit her throat?
He sliced her gently?
And what did the tox report give us?
Double the legal limit.
Ecstasy? And alcohol? Party mix.
Well, maybe it explains why she was cut from the front.
Glitter?
You go, Doc.
So, they were George. 
Big tippers.
Watch.
Ordering clear drinks to keep the party going. What'd they order?
Guess who got the hard stuff.
Uh, I got to be at the courthouse. Apparently, there's a last-minute evidentiary hearing in the Sam Braun case. I need to be there.
He already is, sweetheart. Thanks.
Help with what?
That obvious, huh?
Oh ... Sam Braun.
I'm not.
Sam told me it takes a lifetime to establish a reputation and just a second to ruin it. When I suspected that Sam was my father, I didn't go to him. I didn't go to Grissom. I went to Greg and had him run a DNA test.
On me.
Blood evidence from his case.
Yup. And I'm just afraid.
A backlash.
Is that it? We're done?
Well, power's back on. So, why this place? How do you go from The Sphere to The Fez?
Oh, great. Help the bad guys. I'm sure the Laggermans appreciate that.
Enjoy.
They had to have been in some kind of situation where they couldn't say no.
They didn't think he was just going to walk away.
It's just so sick.
Well, I checked with the manager. The vic was not registered. No car.
Someone's got blood on their hands.
We suspect that Mr. Dominguez was forced to kill his wife for the promise of freedom.
Doc Robbins found evidence of glitter on Mrs. Dominguez.
We didn't know who they were at the time. Okay ... that's it for the first murder. What about the second?
Okay, so, uh, we're going to have to get into the Klinefelds' house. If they haven't tossed the towels and sheets ...  ... we may have something.
Funny, doesn't look like a doghouse.
Um, no, you ratted yourself out. Hey, Nick, I know you're proud of what you do. You're good at what you do, and you want people to know what you do, but once you open your mouth, it's all over 'cause what we say ends up in the news.
So, if that's the lure, where's the catch?
mm-hmm. Clear drinks. What do you want to bet the Rifkins are drinking vodka and the Klinefelds club soda.
So, if we're creatures of habit ... if she stuck her tongue in Mr. Rifkin's ear, chances are she stuck it in Mr. Dominguez's ear, too.
Mr. Dominguez has already been autopsied. Washed from head-to-toe.
Coroners.
He's not picking up.
Oh, hey, doc. Doc. Where's the ice man?
Drop the hose.
Did you go from head to toe or head to toe?
You run with it.
And leave all this?
And you want me to cook?
Okay, boys. There's always room for jell-O.
I wasn't planning on eating it.
All right, that is A ... twelve-inch penetration.
So ... a, um ... hundred percent load gives us twelve inches.
Seven and three-quarter inches.
Four inches.
So Mrs. Mitchell was shot by a bullet traveling 550 feet per second.
Excuse me. May I have your...?
Excuse me. May I have your attention, please?
Thank you. I'm Catherine Willows. I'm from the crime lab.
No. I'm sorry. No one is going anywhere. Ms. Davis. I'll start with you. Will you follow me, please?
Miss Davis, we found a synthetic blond hair on the victim's body. Care to explain?
Did he take you up on your offer?
Lucky for you. Attempting to influence is a category D Felony. It's up to four years in prison and a $5,000 fine.
Woman to woman? The pole is there for a reason. It's what you hang on to so the creeps don't pull you out of there. Smarten up.
Mr. Jervis. Why are your fingers bloodied?
Would you hold your hands up for me, please?
Mr. Jervis. I need to remind you that you're still under judge's orders not to discuss the case.
You sure it's lost?
Hey, Gil. 
So tox came back on Chris Gibbons. He may have been allergic to penicillin but didn't have any in his system.
Epinephrine. So maybe Mr. Gibbons had an allergic reaction to something else. Such as...?
So we're looking for a used hypodermic.
Greg, I'm the one that actually put you on a case, not just talked about it.
You know what? You started, and you gave me six strong innings, and I brought in the closer. What's wrong with that?
Fish -- that's a good place to start. I need you to check the victim's blood for shellfish, egg whites, nuts and soy.
Got to start somewhere.
I'll go talk to the friend.
Hey, Jim.
Did you talk to that guy across the street? 
Yeah, he looks like he has something to say.
Hi, I'm Catherine Willows. I'm with the crime lab. What is your name, Miss?
You're a nurse?
She give a reason why?
Michael?
And how did you get in?
Did you touch anything inside?
Kelly, this, uh, Michael -- is he just a guy, or is he somebody special?
And did you see him today, at the hospital?
One thing I can never get over with this job: Anything can happen to anybody.
I bet this bathroom was the reason she bought this place.
Cleanser. Bleach maybe.
Arterial spray is neck high. Indicates she was standing when she was attacked.
And the highest gush of blood has the most volume.
The killer had to get something on him. Had to be a bloody mess, but there's no ... footprints, there's no handprints, no smears.
What's the message?
Same here. So there's blood in all four drains, followed by bleach.
The answer is in the drains.
We're never going to know where the blood ends and the bleach begins.
No cleansers. No rags, no sponges, no paper towels ...
Well, I'm thinking the killer used everything the victim had.
Nothing.
I think I can confirm the victim's male.
City picks up the evidence and spreads it all over the dump.
Scalpel?
Half a day. That's patience.
Oh, I'm not so sure I see it that way. A killer with knowledge of anatomy whose tool is a scalpel. I think the butcher was a doctor.
So David, isolate all ten fingers, ink them, give Jacqui the ten-card. We need to know who he is.
Two days ago, Debbie Marlin is off work. Sometime in the morning, she buys groceries.
Pendale's is about 20 minutes from her house. Where's Nick?
Getting ready for her date.
Lighting candles. Multi-tasking.
Her girlfriend said that she was locking down for the afternoon with Michael Clark.
So, um, most of our efforts have been towards identifying another victim.
So Michael Clark was dead in the tub.
We just don't know how he got there.
The bathroom is big, but it's not big enough to kill two at the same time.
So he takes seconds to kill Debbie.
So why does he spend so much time cutting up Michael Clark?
Don't tell me you never went home?
You know you lose your edge after sixteen hours. You're into your third shift. I mean, I'm all for overtime, but this is just plain greedy.
Have you eaten anything?
I'll see what's in the fridge.
Feel better?
Well, now that we fed you, we should probably talk about a shower.
I mean at your place. You need to go home.
With fresh eyes, you won't miss it.
All right. The bathroom is where things got started -- candles, oils, steam shower, cleaned up, oiled up, sexed up.
She changed her sheets for her date-- I would.
Why, yes, I do.
I don't mean to embarrass you, but, um ... 
... some guys need leverage.
I'll dust for prints.
Hang one. Toe print. 
I'll have Sara compare it against both victims.
Butterfly, huh?
Gifts from her ... gentlemen callers?
He's still at the crime scene.
Well, we know she was fishing off the company pier. 
You, uh, seen Debbie?
And?
If I didn't know better, I'd think that was you on that table.
Just step on the card, please.
Yeah, lucky for me. I think I could probably tell who pulled a double.
Thank you.
Dr. Tripton.
Your toe print was found in Debbie Marlin's house.
So, you Feng Shui-ed your way to the bed?
All right, well, let's talk about what's not open to interpretation. Yours were the only prints found in the house.
Oh.
The prodigal CSI returns. You get any sleep?
So, uh, Brass had to let Dr. Tripton go. The old s*x alibi. Too bad he didn't leave a toe print on a scalpel blade.
Balloon head, but credible ... like most adulterers.
Not really.
No.
He's a lefty.
You don't strike me as the type who believes in curses.
Uh ... oh, hey, David.
Bite marks?
Right, but those punctures aren't consistent with human teeth.
David, I don't know a whole lot about vampires, but if she was bit, there's spit, and if there's spit, there's DNA, so swab the neck.
Negative. It's probably just house paint.
I'm not sure what we found. Did you ID the Vic?
Warrick, the symbol on her ankle -- it's similar to the one that was painted on the floor of the crime scene.
Relevance?
Then why switch to the jugular?
The Black Veil: 13 Rules of Community.
So you've read what's in here? 
Your daughter believed that she was a vampire?
Lab results.
Well, your daughter was found in an abandoned house. And we believe that there was, um, someone there with her. Do you have any idea who that might be?
Her court?
Alice, you need to answer the question.
Okay, let's start over. Do any of you ladies recognize this man?
Okay. All right, I've had enough.  Your friend is dead. This is a murder case. If you're not willing to help us, we will split you up and treat you as suspects. Hold you for 24 hours. Is that what you want?
Are Angela's tox result in yet?
Her friends didn't say anything about drinking.
And how would Angela get a hold of this?
Mind if we join you?
And you are ... ?
Why would she do that?
Was that the last time you saw her?
How long had the two of you been together?
And you were her donor?
Okay... but you were someone's donor.
And that pendant around you neck? That wouldn't happen to contain blood, would it?
Whose?
And a sample of your ... DNA.
Oh, I prefer saliva.
Open up.
Right.
What about that pendant?
... that she be tested for HIV.
Um ... 
Oh, we've already seen her results. She's dead, so, the confidentiality privilege no longer applies. We need to know which tech withdrew her blood.
Oh. Well, there was a pendant with her blood inside it.
Her blood was mixed with a polyester base. I think you know what that means.
My bet is that it's against your lab's policy.
Mr. Jones ... I'm going to need a sample of your DNA.
The blood in your personal fridge belonged to Angela Sommerville.
And what, you just got thirsty? Angela's test date was 32 days ago, and our lab determined that the blood from your fridge was less than a week old. Would you explain that?
Mr. Jones, give me a file, and I could sharpen my teeth into fangs.
Mm-hmm. The night that Angela was murdered, you were watching over her.
She may have offered her blood to you, but you took her life. You murdered her.
DNA from your saliva was on the rim of the container. It's consistent with the saliva surrounding the puncture marks on Angela's neck.
Everybody, could I please have your attention? All right, folks, I know that you've been through an awful lot this evening. If you could just bear with me a little longer, I need to talk with every one of you one at a time, so I promise to get you out of here as quickly as possible.  Is the, uh, guy in black the cocktail waitress' husband?
Where, specifically?
Which guy?
Shotgun or handgun?
And then ... 
And you never moved from that spot?
Do you have somewhere you need to be?
Sorry.
You were friends?
From where you and Rufus were, could you see Officer Fromansky?
Mr. Reed, you can't look for reasons here.
Hi, I was wondering if I might be able to speak with Celeste Turner. She, uh, has a gunshot wound. She was brought in from the grocery store robbery.
Yes. Thank you.
What can you tell me about the little boy who was also brought in from the robbery incident?
Wait a minute. So, the little boy's mother is Celeste Turner?
b*st*rd was behind her the whole time.
Is there any sign of Fromansky's mystery gunner?
You're not the one that pulled the trigger. Ms. Turner, what was your son doing there with you?
Then?
Henry likes his candy, doesn't he?
Well, we found him in a storage cabinet, near the candy rack.
So, explain to me what all the money was doing in the registers and not the store safe.
Most of the halos are lit.
So, those guys did their homework. They picked the perfect time to hit.
A little.
Well, we just need a few more details before we can release the body. I promise this won't be long.
Well, you said that your wife fell during the gunfight, that that's how you got separated.
Do you recall exactly how she fell?
How did she land? Did she land sideways, backwards ... ?
She fell forward. So her hands broke the fall, landed on her knees?
Well, there weren't any bruises or scrapes on her knees or elbows, which is leading me to believe that she didn't fall.
Mr. Reed, there were a lot of bullets flying around that store and a lot of victims, and every detail is important, but they don't help if they're not accurate.
Well, the suspects knew there was a blind spot. It has to be an inside job.
Somebody came out ahead. Inside guy?
What about the cash?
Almost $900 in small bills? We'd have noticed pockets bulging with a wad like that.
No one by that name interviewed at the scene?
You left something in the store besides a urine stain. 
Just a little too tempting, huh? All that cash just sitting there right in front of your face ...
Might as well get something for all your trouble, right? Considering the fact that your nice little robbery had gone straight to hell.
It was an inside job. You knew the registers were full. Those gunmen had help from an employee.
He admitted to swiping the cash, but he wouldn't cop to the robbery.
One more time.
Somebody moved the camera.
You used to part-time at the forum shops. We got your prints off your work card. It was the same print that we got off the loading dock surveillance camera. 
You give them the best time to hit the registers. You tell them where to park. It's a good plan. Until your Ex showed up and leaves you with your kid. 
If that's what happened, that could go in your favor. 
Early morning call-out, the worst.
Where did you come from?
Did you get any sleep?
About a half an hour.
Mm-hmm.
I try to avoid those places.
Looks like they never got out of the driveway.
You drag a body away to hide it, not down a driveway for the world to see it.
The ol' trophy wife.
Classic Vegas. He pays for her boobs, tummy tuck, Prada, weekly spa, french manicure. And she's just hanging on his arm like she belongs.
Oh, it's gross. I wouldn't want to be her for the world. I wouldn't mind being her for a day, I guess.
No.
Nobody I know lives like this with kids.
Crime occurred in the driveway. Nothing to indicate that the suspects were inside the house.
Anything inside that'll make the outside make sense. 
On your hands and knees. Check the carpet for trace.
Hey. Greg. I'm going to need you to photograph something.
It's what I didn't find.
Blood? Where?
p0rn. That figures. 
Yeah. A few years back.  A Goode/Mike T. Production.
We're mid-case. Why do we have to do this now?
Okay. My goals. Mm ... oh, all right, okay. 
For starters, I'd like two consecutive nights off. I would like to cut my triples down to ten a year instead of the usual twenty, and, uh, I would love to find a reliable baby-sitter, so I could have myself some kind of a personal life.
I ... write this down: I haven't had s*x in six -- no -- seven months.
Gil, how do you do this? Honestly, how do you juggle scheduling and vacations and ... 
Are you considering me?
You've left that out. Are you covering for me? 
Before I sign, um, since we're putting all of our cards on the table, there's something you should know. Sam Braun wrote me a check, and ... I cashed it.
Enough to where Lindsay and I can do anything and ... not enough to where we can do nothing.
I consulted an attorney. It is a check from a father to a daughter. It is completely out of departmental jurisdiction.
Gil, I would never compromise you or the lab.
That's everything.
Talk to me.
Okay, so you've gone through her purse, uh, her wallet ...
What about the briefcase?
I need to see your boss.
Yes, I am.
Well ... this is private.
He didn't treat her like a trophy wife?
Um, and what was, uh ... what was your professional affiliation with him?
Have you seen this Mr. Goode lately?
And ... What about this Drake Snow guy?
Uh, and how did he get along with the Trents?
Reading my mind.
Oh. Catherine.
Willows.
Chris Bezich. 
And you wanted in?
And Kyle - 
And what? Mike didn't agree to it?
In the kitchen, you said?
Oh, you gave Laurel the release form.
All right. So, uh, listen, Drake. I'm going to help you get that dream shot. So that when you do get into the p0rn biz, you won't have a murder rap hanging over your head.
Here. Crime Scene 101. Stick this in your mouth.
Checking out my butt again, Greg?
mm-hmm.
Oh.
So he told the truth about the blood and lied about the kitchen. Figures.
Puts him at the scene. And the fourth butt?
Orange seeds?
So we're looking for two guys and a gal who might know Drake.
mm-hmm. Well, I'll have to verify it with evidence.
Everything. Including you. You're clear.
s*x?
Yes, well, I did happen to notice those little waitress girlies trying to serve their way into bed with you.
What? You want to get to know me?
Um ...
Wait. Hang on. I'm on the clock.
Yes, and when the time is right, maybe I'll finish it.
Trace on the cigarette butt is a match to the sand I collected from the ashtray.
So it's possible that the butts were planted. 
May explain why there seems to be so many suspects at the crime scene.
With two guys on bikes.
Sounds like no honor among thieves.
I'm thinking more and more it was never part of the plan.
So it was Laurel Trent who cleaned out her own jewelry box.
Oh ... you're still here. Uh ...  So I'm leaving. Need anything?
Are we good?
Okay. I'll see you tomorrow.
I've got some unfinished business to take care of. 
So, how long have you been in Vegas, Detective Cavaliere?
Whatever blows your skirt up. Burn me a copy.
Yeah, it looks like he's wearing makeup. Blush on the cheeks ... lipstick.
Murder usually personal.
I'd settle for his clothes.
No. But that's why god invented sawzalls.
That's still legal in Nevada.
Dave, what's up? You find something?
Don't let the scope touch the garment. You don't want to contaminate the evidence. And work systematically. 
Oh, Well, whatever works for you. Just don't miss any spots. 
All right, hang on. What do those look like to you?
Yes. 
No. 
Thanks for putting that picture in my brain. 
All right, so ... 
I want you to outline each individual stain with dots. But keep them at least an eighth of an inch from the edge to avoid contamination.
You got it.
A fiber in his nose.
I would've thought he was strangled during some kind of rough sex-play, but there's no marks.
Vegas brow.  A showgirl thing. Eyebrows thin out from all the plucking and waxing and filling in.
Yeah.
His face looks painted.  Kinda looks like a clown.
Description didn't match anyone in missing persons. If you've got a better idea, now's the time.
I'd say we're in the right place.
I'm Catherine Willows. This is Sara Sidle. We're with the crime lab.
The party has already happened. 
Identify the body. Did that man ever work for you?
How do you register a clown?
Which kind was Doodles?
Mm-hmm. Lindsey's fourth ... bad scene.
So, what was the last gig you booked for him?
So, if he's hooking up in Tranny-town, you'd expect to find some man-on-man p0rn.
All we've got is varying flavors of juggs.
Oh, an answering machine with messages.
You know what they say about big feet.
Interesting.
Makes sense if he's out of town on a job. I'll call Detective Cavaliere and have him pull the phone records.
We're hoping you can help us find out.
What do you mean by that?
And what time did Doodles leave?
Do you remember the name of the taxi company or the time of the call?
Uh-huh. So that leaves us with what?
Hmm.
What about timeline? Mrs. Maguire gives Doodles a lift, getting him home around 8:30.
Doodles goes home, having performing all day for kids, wrestling with mimes. His costume would've been a little skanky, yet he doesn't change out of it?
And he walks around town in his clown suit until he gets killed?
Greg analyzed the semen stains on his boxer shorts and found an unknown vaginal contribution in the sample.
So, we're looking for clown s*x ...
You notice how everything matches except this one pillow sham?
The white-faced clown with a pillow covering his face. There must've been some transfer.
I'd clean it first.
You lied about driving the clown home. He was in your bedroom.
I think you like them more than most people.
You stripped the body and dumped it in an area frequented by transvestites, hoping that it would just... go away. Another forgotten s*x crime. You covered your tracks. You cleaned the house. You washed that pillowcase. What I don't understand, though ... why did you keep the clown suit?
You got my message.
All right.
Room service.
Hey, Jim!
We got a call. A possible 4-19. Is there a dead body or not?
Okay, well, I got some blood on the wheel well.
Oh, yeah, that's a definite on the 4-19. 
Um, well ... appears to be female. Caucasian.
So ... the bus is traveling sixty-five miles per hour. What's the distance from the tip of her nose to the tip of her toes?
Well, looks like she used strips from a white cotton sheet.
Low thread count. Average tensile strength wasn't strong enough to support her weight.
Yep. If she'd used a nylon rope, she'd be on her way to Tijuana.
Oh, hey, after that, grab Sara and go directly to jail. I'm going to supervise this body part collection.
Okay, David, I think that's it.
When I do a jigsaw puzzle, I like to start with a corner piece.
Antoinette Stella. Two-year sentence for identity theft. She was due for release next month. Guess she was in a hurry.
Have you determined the cause of death?
I'd like a clean look at that fracture.
Anything else?
Birthmark?
Juanita? Do you recall the last time that you washed out the interior of the bus?
Did you notice anything unusual in the back of the bus?
Blood or ... semen?
What about semen?
Yeah. But I doubt if conjugal visits are permitted in a prison bus.
Lots of things are felonies, but people still do them. Otherwise, you and I'd be out of a job.
Oh, the Warden faxed over Baby Girl's commissary purchases. She bought one twenty-count box of tampons every month like clockwork, but check out the last few months.
I think Baby Girl was having a baby.
Did you, by any chance, do a pregnancy test on Baby Girl?
She had been.
Home Pregnancy Test, huh?
Eye on the bottom line. I find that very ...
Prudent. But that was a good try.
Who's your daddy?
We have probable cause to believe that a Correctional Officer was involved with Baby Girl.
Nevertheless, as you pointed out, s*x with an inmate is a crime. Which is the basis for my warrant. 
Okay, everybody, can I have your attention, please?
Start talking.
Not a surprise.
Also, not a surprise.
She was pregnant. Twelve weeks. And you're the father. Your attorney has reviewed your case file.
Yeah. I imagine that you were pissed off when she broke the news. It kind of changes the power dynamics.
Well, your client's already been charged with a felony. DA has all the time in the world.
Greg.
That's what I asked you.
So, if the epithelial DNA matches the bus driver, this case is closed.
It's female DNA? Well, I guess we're looking at an inmate.
Oh, not if the vic's skull is in that bag.
White fibers.
Warden, how often do the inmates have their laundry washed?
You don't mind if I empty out your laundry bag, do you?
Juanita, would you remove your shoes, please?
A lock in a sock.
Juanita, I read your rap sheet. Possession with intent to sell. Your old man was using you as a drug meal, right?
Well ... my ex drained my bank account. I was saving up for this nice little house for my daughter and me, and ... 
Gets lonely in prison, doesn't it? Was it the first time you had a relationship with a woman?
Tattoo. Baby Girl had the other half.
It wouldn't be the first time to cross gender lines in search of some ... affection.
And Baby Girl ended up pregnant. It's not like she could hide that from you.
So you killed her?
You tied her body to the undercarriage of the bus and assumed we'd think that she died while attempting to escape ... right?
I think that you should know that Baby Girl was telling the truth about the transfer. It wasn't her request. It was Warden Hutton's decision. 
She was caught trying to smuggle in this necklace and was reprimanded. I'm guessing it was for you.
Blood drops are medium to large. Low-velocity spatter. No castoff.
Hand to hand?
Size doesn't matter when you're outnumbered.
You might want to check that.
You okay?
Nasty. That kind of looks like a hickey.  You want to tell me what got this party started?
That's it?
101.5.
How'd you know there was another body at that motel?
And you're wondering what he'd been doing all his life.
Willows.
Why don't you hold that thought until later?
Sorry. A new friend.
So Jane Doe was never reported missing.
Shared alleles, so it was either a father or a son.
So it was a father.
Warrick.
These have got to be maternity clothes.
Her name's not Libby.
Dental records confirm our Jane Doe was Marissa Cleary.
The foreign DNA in her pelvis wasn't from her father. It was from her son.
Not through her birth canal. There's other ways to deliver a baby.
The umbilical cord contains fetal DNA.
Mr. Cleary, we haven't found any evidence to suggest that your son ...
Yes. 
Last thing you needed was a family. 
Mm-hmm.
My money's on Walter.
Yeah, well, Warrick's going through his stuff now.
So, what about this text?
So, he'd be eight now. Assuming he's still alive.
The Bates Motel is in Sloan. Why would Walter go that far out of his way to mail a letter?
Do you recognize this woman?
Her name is Marissa Cleary. We believe she was a guest in your brother's motel eight years ago.
I don't know. I'm sure it wasn't much.
Are we keeping you from something?
Did Walter give you those burns?
You're not his mother.
Middle of the night, your brother shows up and hands you a baby. You don't ask any questions. You don't report it.
Marissa Cleary didn't sign that note.
The suitcase was in Walter's closet. 
Hey.
So you think it's a serial?
I think our arsonist just turned into a murderer.
Smoke inhalation happens really fast. I'm so sorry. I heard you say she wasn't supposed to be home tonight. Was she with her dad?
What time was that?
Mrs. Abernathy, do you have any idea what may have caused the fire?
Do you know anyone who might want to set fire to your home?
Her mother thought that she wasn't home.
But she wasn't asleep.
If you can explain the behavior of teenagers, more power to you.
Mrs. Abernathy said that she locked all the doors before bed.
Plus ... a bar full of liquid fire with a low flash point.
Couch?
This looks like a liquid pour pattern. High-intensity burn. You think this could be the point of origin?
How'd you do?
That's on the other side of the house.
Did they find an accelerant at the first scene?
So maybe part of the M.O. is that he uses accelerants that are present.
Well, how can that be? It was an obvious liquid pour pattern.
All it needed was a spark.
We've got no accelerant. We've got no match. We have no idea what started this fire.
Hmm, looks like a one hundred. Longer the cigarette, longer the filter.
It's fine.
Well, we found a cigarette filter in the remains of your couch. And we need a urine sample from each of you so that we can rule you out for nicotine.
Ritalin, valium, and grandma's a liar.
Mrs. Abernathy, did your daughter have attention deficit disorder?
Well, we found Ritalin in her system, and as I'm sure you're aware, ritalin is used to treat kids with ADD, but acts as a stimulant in older kids and adults. Teens use it as an upper.
As were you. Valium.
One with a teenage daughter.
Mrs. Abernathy ... are you covering for your mother?
Maybe after you went to bed, she came out into the living room.
But it's a possibility?
Any luck?
Did you try different variables?
I'm not following.
Mm-hmm.
Unless the fire didn't start on the living room couch.
An incandescent light bulb will soften at around 900 degrees, and distend in the direction of the original heat source.
How did we miss that?
Let's dig in.
Do you fondue?
The accelerant was ethanol, methanol and petroleum jelly. Chafing dish fuel, like sterno.
So it has gone from intentional to accidental to personal. Who have we got?
She's got no personal connection to the family.
Charming.
What about Cody?
What about suspects within the house?
She seems more frustrated than desperate. Frustration shows you still care.
I don't think so. Bitch. It's such a teenage girl word. 
I might be willing to buy that, but how do we prove it?
This is old school hydrocarbon detection.
Chafing dish fuel is alcohol-based, but water would have washed away any trace.
Well, it's the only shot we've got, I guess.
Hmm. Take a look at this.
Oh.  Hit the jackpot.
Mom was locking the wrong door.
Mrs. Abernathy, would you come with me, please?
Mr. Dominguez was forced to kill his wife for the promise of freedom.
Rifkin's ear -- chances are she stuck it in Mr. Dominguez's ear, too.
Yeah, well, let me tell you how it ends. They die. 
Whoa, this isn't half bad for college kids.
Hey, how 'bout it: You, me, Warrick, Nick, Grissom ... 
What the hell is this?
Thanks. Where's the body?
It's raining man juice?
Yeah, if only the smell would.
It's like a sewer in here.
Oh, god.
How long has he been in here?
Well, any evidence on the floor's been washed away.
We got to take that body and get it through that door.
This drain hasn't been tampered with. It's just clogged. I think this is an accidental.
Well, I don't think that means much. Chances are he's not getting his drugs from a medicine cabinet.
Same place we were when we walked through the door -- with a bloated floater.
Hey. 
A backwards seven.
I don't know.
Some kind of greasepaint or makeup.
Rubs off your chest. Oh, what kind of guy paints his chest?
Sports freak.
Cause of death?
A slow leak in a tire?
Well, he had to have been in the water for a couple of days to look like this. Roommates last saw him Thursday. So I guess we start there and we work backwards. Thanks.
What about the away games?
Define ugly.
Did you notice anything? Did he ...feel okay?
How did Shirley take it?
Do you see any of those guys in here now?
Start with the Shirley Temples and go from there.
How?
Interesting ring you've got on. 
That's a college ring. Mind if I borrow it?
Yeah.
Jaws.
No, it was in Steven Spielberg's Jaws. They had this mechanical shark named Bruce. And he kept swimming round and round in circles.
His dorsal fin was bent.
Same way the kid's ring did. It hit something.
But he was already dying. And you're responsible.
What the hell kind of music is that?
Sedative.
How about something that doesn't twang?
Better.
Hey, Grissom!
Grissom!
Grissom!
Gris-s-som!
God! What, are you taking a leak? 
The follow car is supposed to stay with the runner. We've been training for months, man. Twenty CSIs. A hundred twenty miles.
Good call.
Weird. The race just started. 
L.A. County PD. Special Enforcement Squad. Badass. Hardcore badass. Give me some more light here.
That looks like a recent injury. There's no scab. Fight?
Would you give me your phone?
Uh ... Uh, this is CSI Willows. 
I'm at highway 160, halfway through leg 16 of the Desert Relay. We got a 419, officer down. Notify Captain Brass.
Barehanded, huh?
Ten years ago we wouldn't have been able to get DNA off that fiber.
Time of discovery: 4:32. I'll put it in the report.
So much for the race.
So much for that shoe print.
How many cops are in town this weekend?
Spring break with a badge.  Well, this ought to be fun. Every suspect's in law enforcement.
Grissom. 
Tox came in. Tim Coleman had 75 mics per mil of furosemide in his system.
And it was a high dose, but not a lethal one.
And the drug can also cause muscle cramps, ... 
... dizziness, confusion, blurred vision, restlessness.
That could explain how Tim Coleman ended up where he did.
Am I interrupting something?
Um, are those bags brought in from the race?
I'm going to need Tim Coleman's.
You're not going to miss the competition?
A man with nothing to prove. Now that would be a first.
Tim Coleman's gear bag. Gym clothes, towel, vitamins, pocket knife.
Well, you know, there's a five-minute penalty if you litter the race course.
Injection.
Ingestion.
Someone spiked his drink.
Jim.
Well, if you think that's all I handle, you're not as smart as you think. So, you're the L.A. County team medic, right? That means you're responsible for making sure that all your team mates are well hydrated.
Including Tim Coleman.
He had a good excuse. Did you give it to him?
Well ... sounds like you've been giving it some serious thought.
Well, according to histology, Tim Coleman's muscle cells were hyper-hydrated, yet his body was dehydrated.
Right. But apart from the furosemide, his tox was negative. So, I took another look at the guy.
Buff, cut, aggressive. Made me think steroids.
Well, steroids are controlled, but creatine isn't. It's a legal way to bulk up.
Tim Coleman was using it. Creatine pulls the potassium from the blood and moves it into the muscles.
Exactly. And you add furosemide to it, and you get a severe electrolyte imbalance.
The dose.  There wasn't enough furosemide in the water to make that happen.
Backwash.
Tim Coleman died of a drug-induced cardiac arrest.
Actually, he was only on one drug. Creatine. You made it plural. You gave him a protein bar that was laced with furosemide.
The combination of the two drugs is what killed him.
We're going to need to see your pocketknife.
Hi, David.
Now ... the body position is inconsistent with her lividity.
So she had been facedown.
How long has she been here?
Instar maggots.
Takes that long for blowfly eggs to hatch.
Let's just hope there's some evidence on her body.
I'm very sorry.
Officer, could you please escort Ms. Press ... to the morgue.
A single mother, working nights.
Ah, you do the best you can.
Hey.
Got your page. What's up?
Mm-hmm.
Wow. This place is crawling with kids. She remembers her?
Have we tracked down her friend, Carrie?
And was she supposed to sleep over the day that she was killed?
Warrick.
Yeah, you're not the only one.
Can you enlarge it?
And who's that with you?
You two were friends?
She was thirteen. How old are you?
In the photo, you're grabbing her arm.
Did she say who?
What's up?
Come again.
You're kidding?
Who knew? Uh, so can we track the source of ... ?
Zoodoo.
Hello.
May I?
At this point, we're just following a lead. How long have you known Justin?
And where's Tessa's father?
Have you ever left Tessa alone with Justin?
The blood on the blade matches your daughter's DNA.
You can help yourself here. You can avoid murder one by telling us what set you off.
Try me.
Why don't you tell us?
No. Your daughter was the best thing in your life.
I know she was thirteen years old. A child.
In this town, it's always Halloween.
Rolex is still on his wrist. Probably rules out robbery.  What do you think?
Yeah ... gotta be.
So, uh ... Brass ran the ID. There's no Ernie Menlo in the system. Fake.
Well, I don't see any shell casings either. So maybe the killer picked them up.
So either he walked in or he got a ride. Either way, this gravel and glass makes good evidence.
I found some tire treads. I think the vehicle was making a three-point turn.
Wow!
Rampart. Guess I'll go check that out.
Coincidence.
Why is that a problem?
Gil ... 
Are you complaining?
Hmm.
You like that?
Uh-uh. Just give us a minute.
What do you want?
I could get fired for even having this conversation.
Just cut to the chase, Sam.
Some people in this town know you're a murderer.
Kids? How do you know there's more than one?
I'm fine.
He slept with my mother.
What are you doing?
Uh, you know those tracks that we found at the neon graveyard?
Yeah, those. Sam ... used to be a caddy man. He would drive a new one every year. These days, he's being driven.
I saw him.  He came to me.
I made him walk away from me. Right into a stretch limo with a big turning radius.
Then have it come from you. Warrant shouldn't be hard to get. Especially if the call comes from someone whose character is above reproach.
Sam. Could I buy you some dinner?
Right. He gets to work off his debt.
You don't want to take the statement?
No.
Linley Parker, I'm Catherine Willows. I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab. I know that you've been through a horrific ordeal.
Can you start from the beginning?
Thank you. That was very specific. You said that you looked at him. Could you describe him to a forensic artist?
Well, blue looks black at night.
Mm-hmm.
Well, he could've ditched the shoes anywhere.
So, uh, what do you got, Greg?
You're kidding.
She was so sure.
He's not the man that assaulted you.
DNA ruled him out.
We have some additional leads, and we're working on them. I promise to keep you informed.
Linley, it was dark. You were under attack. Under those conditions ...
... pupils dilate, it's hard to focus.
You can't always trust your eyes. 
This is my cell phone number. Call me if you need anything.
If you don't feel safe in your home, stay with a friend.
Willows.
Linley? 
Linley, I can barely hear you. Where are you?
Linley?
Linley?!
Where is she?
There's no new damage except for the window.
Blood is probably from whoever broke the glass, not the victim.
Anybody see what happened here?
It's the same guy. He's getting rid of the witness.
And until then we wait?
Yeah, you should have had eyes on the brothers.
Yes.
I looked everywhere.
So where's her phone?
We just took a shot. She's got a lot of new gadgets in her car, most new cell phones are imbedded with a GPS chip.
Okay.
That's the middle of nowhere. 
We got a location!
Which means it doesn't match Todd Coombs.
Linley was absolutely certain that Todd Coombs raped her.
Well, maybe the evidence is wrong.
Deep down, tell me you don't think this guy is good for this.
Puts him with the body.
I'll have Brass bring him in.
So he had two strains of DNA in his body.
So, what do we have here?
Hmm. 
Okay, thanks.
Hey, Nathan. How's your foot?
Hmm. Yeah, I see that. Mrs. Timmel, does the gun belong to someone in the house?
Nathan, where did you find the gun?
Seymour?
So, you were playing with Seymour, and he found the gun where?
Well, where exactly?
Was it buried? Did you dig it up?
Will you ever play with guns again?
Hey, Rich. 
Found this somewhere where it didn't belong. 
Unregistered. No prints.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, light enough for a five year old to use.
He's okay. Thank god.
Well, that's a good thing.
Okay.
Frank Maddox. 47-year-old white male. Professional bounty hunter. Single .32 round in the side of his head. Bruises on his face and chest.
Warrick, your notes are great. Let the case speak for itself.
Maslow Park. All fun and games till the sun goes down.
So, the bounty hunter is here at 2:00 A.M.
Well, apparently, someone found him first.
Hunter becomes the hunted.
A dozen perfect dump sites within a mile of here. So, how does the gun end up across town in the hands of a five-year-old boy?
Doesn't make any sense.
Actually, no. Terrango killed two more people before another
Oh, yeah, it did. After that case, his recovery rate went down practically to zero.
What about suicide?
Maybe too textbook. A bounty hunter would know how to fake it. Let's check out his right sleeve. Very odd. It's unbuttoned - it's pulled way down. It would explain why there weren't any prints on the gun.
Maybe someone found it and grabbed it up.
We're always looking for a weapon. You'd think it'd be easier when the weapon finds us.
It's polypropylene film. It was found in the trigger guard. It's ribbon, for wrapping presents and ...
You got ten bucks?
Hi.
You here every day? 
Do you recognize this man?
Did he buy any balloons?
I'll take what he bought.
Hey. I'm sorry to hear about your case.
Well, he'll be back. We'll get him eventually.
Want to go for a ride?
Frank Maddox - bad-ass bounty hunter on his way down. Loses his rep, loses his edge ... 
Except maybe one thing: Going out with his boots on. 
He picks a known hot spot, and waits until it gets dark. 
Angles the gun down...
... and the balloons make it look like murder.
Until ... 
... you leave the city to get away from crime, and guns fall out of the sky.
When are parents going to learn a car is not a baby-sitter?
I lost count after ten.
If it's not babies in cars, it's babies in swimming pools. It's that time of year.
mm-hmm. Personal visit. Must be important.
We're working on it.
Based on the time of death, uh, we estimate roughly an hour. The 9-1-1 call came in 11:30 in the morning.
According to Captain Brass ... uh, ten a.m.
I know. It's a tragedy.
Is there any worse punishment than losing your child?
Doesn't change my job.
I always do.
Car seat's fastened correctly. Most aren't.
Hey, Gil. Look at this. What do you think?
Exactly. There's no indentations in the leather.
Yeah. Same thing the father said.
I don't know.
Negative for blood.
What are you thinking?
Hey, Greg.
How are we doing on that swab?
Not likely. Child endangerment. Child neglect. Child abuse.
You and the D.A. can shake hands.
Your print out's ready.
Cough syrup.
Mrs. Winston.
You flew to Los Angeles, Mrs. Winston?
I presume you have a babyseat in your vehicle.
Ms. Winston, did Joshua have a cold?
Did you give him anything for it?
How about this morning?
Howard Aston Winston.
When did he die?
Oh, that's incurable. Like MS, right?
The Winstons never mentioned they had another child.
I know it.
So, between the cough syrup and the heat, Joshua probably fell asleep and the father forgot that he was there.
Pesticides. 
What the hell's he doing with pesticides in his system?
Where do you keep your gardening supplies?
Night and day, compared to Joshua.
Quite a lot of vitreous fluid left. 
Run this?
Anti-inflammatory. Sometimes prescribed for Tay-Sachs. Well, it's the same principle of giving marijuana to glaucoma patients -- doesn't really cure the vision problems; it just buys you time.
Yeah.
So, they don't kill their first child, who's dying. Why kill the second child, who's healthy?
So, both Howard and Joshua Winston were patients of yours?
But Joshua dodged the bullet.
Had you seen Joshua recently?
It was a regular checkup, or ... ?
What are the odds?
And did you confirm it?
When you were in the garden, was Joshua with you?
Did you wash your hands?
Well, I met with your pediatrician, Dr. Garner. When you brought Joshua in on that emergency call, it was because you feared that he, too, had Tay-Sachs.
Did you know that repeated exposure to certain pesticides, even in small amounts, can have an adverse effect in infants? Even mimic the signs of Tay-Sachs?
You work with pesticides, Mrs. Winston, on your job and in your garden. And you handled Joshua -- we suspect that that's how the traces got into his system. I'm just speculating here, but I think this is what happened next:
You gave Joshua cough syrup, Mr. Winston. Why did you medicate him?
The shame of it is you didn't have to.
The enzyme test that dr. Garner ran came back negative. Joshua didn't have Tay-Sachs. You killed a perfectly healthy baby.
Ooh, that's what happens when 6,000 pounds of thrust meets three feet of hood.
Well, now, how did she end up way over here? 
There must be 20 feet of rubber burned into this asphalt. She was braking hard.
Oh. What kind of animal are we talking about here?
The victim could have clipped the animal when it ran in front of her. 
Well, it can't have gone far.
Hmm. Ooh. Not much padding.
Oh, yeah. That's what you see out of. I once dated the Detroit Lions Mascot. Off-season. Dutch was his name.
Dutch never had furballs, though.
The eternal question: Why did the man in the raccoon suit cross the road?
Your basic massive internal trauma.
Anything unusual about our furry friend?
Well, this one liked to wrap his around a bottle. 30 days: One day at a time. He was a friend of Bill W.'S. 
Oh, my -- hand stitching.
This isn't a costume. It's a six-foot condom. Explains why there was no blood on the road.
Through and through.
So, he was shot and hit by a car.
Hi, Warrick.
Anything on Mr. Raccoon?
Oh, that's where he got the 30-day chip. Maybe he fell off the wagon after he hit 31.
Oh, hey, Warrick, it's Vegas. People come here to be animals.
Oh, yes, the blue fur ball.
Really?
Well, ipecac's an emetic. I once gave it to Lindsey when she swallowed mothballs, but civet oil?
Ooh.
Not an architectural digest reader.
If you want to know what the man really is all about, check out his bedroom.
A man lives alone. Has no relatives. No attachments. So, he forms his own furry little family.
What's PAF con?
Minus one raccoon.
PAF con?
I think I'm having Hunter Thompson's flashbacks. This is weirding me out.
I'm not getting the brave thing.
A full head of hair?
Hello, guys. Pardon me. Uh, can you help me out here? Do you recognize this guy?
Look-look again.
Hmm. Nice dog.
I'm Catherine Willows. I'm with the crime lab.
Um, we're going to need samples of your fur.
You have a problem with that?
Hello, Sexy.
That's one I haven't heard.
Well, killing is perfectly normal for them, too. It doesn't make it legal for you.
So, if we follow the ipecac and civet oil, maybe it'll lead us to the shooter. I don't see a compartment for a concealed rifle.
Okay, well ... I've heard of some guys getting off in some weird ways, but humping an animal suit? Well, whatever happened to normal s*x?
Uh, you think it's natural for a grown human to only be intimate with a talking animal?
Well, I like hairy chests, but I'm not about to bop a six-foot weasel.
You lied to us. You were doing a little more than grooming.
I get furpile. Define yiffing.
You couldn't possibly.
Did you smear ipecac and civet oil on the back of your costume?
Oh, who the hell knows what goes on in a furpile? But if somebody doused their special scent on kitty's back, I'm sure he's going to want to know who did it.
Maybe we just ask him where the hip, young plushy-on-the-go likes to hang out?
E-I-E-I-O?
Whoa, Nellie!
It's a homicide investigation.
Ooh! These costumes are pretty marinated. Smokey could've used some deodorant.
How boring.
Uh, Rocky was a target.
Civet oil and ipecac.
Damn it. This was here the whole time.
So she didn't just hit rocky, she knew him.
You ever have a car fight?
You know, if a couple has any kind of history together, they know how to press each other's buttons. And you lock 'em up in a metal box with wheels on a bad night, they're going to start pressing 'em. You follow?
Yes. That one. I mean, it's bad enough that raccoon-boy blows his girlfriend off to go fur-piling -- he gets sick licking some nasty kitty and makes lambchop drive him home.
Well, she wasn't heading back to the hotel. She was heading back for him. 'Cause that's how car-fights always end. After about a mile or two, you start to feel guilty that you've abandoned the person, and you turn around. Except she didn't plan on an 18-wheeler finishing her off.
No ... but I think I may know the last person who saw them alive. Why don't we ask the valet if he saw some ... furriest conventioneers?
So, there's your car-fight. Now she thinks that he's back on the booze, which he denies, but the sicker he gets, the more she this he's lying.
And the battle's just beginning.
Okay, so it makes sense up to that point, but then what? He gets out and ... she shoots him?
You don't think they allow plushies in the NRA? All right, then who shot him?
Hey, Grissom. Over here. I found the bullet.
So, either he was shot by a giant ... or he was, uh, on all fours.
He was dosed intentionally but killed accidentally.
Bob Pitt was sick when he got out of the car, wounded when he got onto the road, and dead when he hit the dirt.
We took one look at those furry suits and thought foul play, but this was really just a domestic dispute gone mad.
Any idea when Grissom'll be back?
Jackpot, Nevada. Where the hell is that?
Spruce and fir trees. Typical mountain forest.
Fire, roads or ... logging.
No manzanita leaves here.
Is the service actually bad out there or are you just keeping your phone off?
This trip wouldn't have anything to do with you ducking case reviews, now would it?
Oh, your job, my pay. Why would I care?
Yeah, you had better. 
Hodges ID'd your leaf litter.
Oh, no. Grissom's on a safari.
Oh, no. I'm trying to avoid that. His headless D.B. had a Western LVU bookstore receipt in his pocket. Grissom just unraveled it.
Wow! Some of these books are a hundred bucks a pop. Tuition, plus room and board -- that's at least another 10k.
Yeah, well, I missed that boat. So, most of these are freshman textbooks. Core curriculum.
Oh, wait. Hang on. Chiaroscuro Theory and Technique. It's a sophomore-level fine arts text.
Narrows the field.
Are these Ross's shoes?
Aspen leaf. A little piece of the countryside. Has Ross spent a lot of time up in northern Nevada?
Everybody in Sleepy Hollow still drawing a blank on the victim?
Well, then somebody's lying. Ross Jenson was having a relationship with someone in jackpot. Greg traced a series of romantic I.M.s from your victim's computer.
Yeah, he knows stuff. Pretty hot, too. Sounds like he was in love. Brass is still working on a court order for the name. You ever coming back?
Oh. Thanks, Judy.
What is this?
Well, I didn't come here to talk. I came to give it back.
You're a murderer.
Lindsey's none of your business. You keep her out of this.
Yeah, well, nothing I can do about that.
And the next time you stab one of your showgirls and you need CSI to cover it, I'm supposed to help you out, right?
I don't need your Charity.
You're lucky Lindsey's too young to understand that.
Hey. What's up?
The day Ross Jenson left Vegas, he used MapQuest to get directions from his dorm to jackpot.
Well, that doesn't make sense. He was involved with someone in jackpot for several months. There were traces of aspen leaves in his dorm room closet. I just assumed he'd been there before.
He has a roommate.
Yeah, his name is ... Eric Brooks.
Was Ross?
We got your fingerprints from a former ROTC commander of yours, and ... they matched a print that we recovered from the steering wheel.
Could I see the bottom of your shoes, please?
Well, that's an unusual wear pattern. Matches the shoe print we recovered from the barn near the vehicle.
You were there.
We tested the thermos and found traces of GHB.
You used Ross' drugs to subdue him.
Why didn't you go the distance? Why didn't you finish him off yourself?
Because he was in love with your father? Or because he wasn't in love with you?
My case. Rachel Lyford, 19. Murdered in her apartment.
The assistant coroner examined the body. Based on the vaginal introitus, he suspected rape. I processed the scene. There was nothing probative. There were no prints, no DNA. Everything I collected is in the vault.
Further processing of the evidence became a low priority, pending the trial date.
I'll go back to the scene and look at it with fresh eyes.
Thank you.
Oh ... I remember now.
Really? Any good?
I processed this place for twelve straight hours. I never took a break. Couldn't eat.
No, I went over every square inch of this place. I did the mattress, the sheets, the floors, the cabinets. If the rapist ejaculated, he was smart enough to use a condom.
Yeah, I did, but ... 
Not every guy uses the trash.
Guy had sticky fingers.
Oh, yeah. Fresh eyes, new evidence.
Hey, you.
How, uh, are you holding up?
You sure?
You're in the women's bathroom.
No, I ... I'm all for it.
Better to know his lies before we go to trial.
We've got time. Seminal DNA's being processed as we speak. This case can break any minute.
Come on, you know, Warrick, we don't just call these cases rush
DNA on the toilet flusher. 
Suspect's DNA is inconsistent with the semen found at the scene.
Our only suspect may be innocent.
Well, the toilet bowl was clean. The semen belongs to whoever flushed the toilet last, but there was a drop, not a smear.
Okay, so, for argument's sake, let's assume that Fife didn't put the knife in the car. How did it get there?
And what evidence is still outstanding?
Well, I know that there was wax on the sheets and the victim's body. How about the murder weapon?
Grissom?
Made with soy, burns clean. Drip it all over your partner's body. I thought that we installed a fire-wall for sites like these.
What have you got?
Give me.
Thank you.
Except, if we ask him, we show our cards, and his lawyer will know that we're looking in another direction.
So, I liked your tough act yesterday.
I hand out the assignments. This isn't a negotiation.
Not enough.
By bringing your car to a car wash, you pretty much open it up into the entire world, right? Vehicles are most vulnerable down that tunnel. So, I'm thinking that Michael Fife's taillight was intact when he arrived.
Exactly. So, his car proceeds on down the line, and then inside the tunnel, someone, presumably our killer, stashes the knife, breaks the taillight.
Right. And the killer is banking on some ambitious cop searching the vehicle. Okay, so, a broken taillight. The pieces fall into the water.
Uh, excuse me, sir. A-are you the manager?
Does your drain have a filter?
Well, when was the last time you had it cleaned?
I'm going to have to clean your traps.
I understand, sir, but you know, just let us shut you down for about an hour or so. Otherwise, we can get a search warrant, come back on Saturday, your busiest day, and, well ... it's up to you.
The crime lab thanks you for your cooperation, sir.
Look what I found. 
Which means the taillight was broken on purpose.
All right, you guys, I'm going to be swabbing your left cheek, so, uh ... try not to bite down.
Well, you just hold on there. It's only going to take a second. Open.
Thank you.
Uh, Akers, do me a favor and escort this guy to the john.
Really? Well, I swear that you do. I found semen on the toilet in Rachel's apartment that matches your DNA
So, you do know her.
I don't think so.
After raping her, you realized she had your name, knew where you worked. One call to the cops and you're looking at 25 to life.
Forget life; you're looking at the death penalty.
You broke the taillight, you stashed the knife. Instant suspect.
She gave them to you ... over her dead body.
So no girl? 
What did he blow?
Going to take him a long time to sober up.
Six days missing? He didn't just hurt her.
Attaboy, Sheriff. Nothing like predicting the future.
This is like a timeline. Day one all the way up until this morning.
Howard Delhomme Photography.
Who reported Julie Waters missing?
What's that?
What about her car?
Purse?
Although the place was papered with articles about her, all acquired after the fact.
Where is he?
I'm sorry. I never meant to hurt anyone.
Anyone? What's that supposed to mean? That Julie Waters isn't his first victim? He's done this before?
How many yards did you say it was from mile marker 15?
Need your help here, Mr. Delhomme.
All right. 
Howard. Are we in the right place?
What were you wearing that day, Howard?
You recognize any of these rock formations?
You'd be less confused if it was just you and me?
Not yet.
Hey, uh ... We need him in one piece.
All right, at least we can hold onto him for a while.
Well, until we find the body, he is all the evidence we've got.
Oh, I've got a good feeling about this.
Believe me, I'd rather follow the evidence, but if it takes having the evidence follow me ...
I'm the Senior CSI here.
You want it?
I got the most high-profile cases under my belt; I think that the Sheriff would rest easier knowing that I was heading it up.
You going to have my back?
He wanted me. He's got me.
Remember, we're looking for anything this guy did last Thursday, November 6.
You want to learn. And you can start by not repeating my mistakes.
I screwed up. You covered me.
No, you're here because I want you to be here.
Household item? That could be anything.
Inucci motors.
He checked out a car at 2:00 that afternoon and returned it the following morning at 9:00 am. 
Why would Howard Delhomme have a receipt for one of your cars?
Did you instruct him to hire a model for the photo shoot?
Where is the car?
Oh. Well, I appreciate that. I still need to look at it.
You know what I did the last time I looked at a car? I cut out a
Oh, well, I can't promise you that. But what I can promise you is that for the next few hours ... 
... that car is mine.
Take these and compare them to the toothbrush that Sara collected from Julie Waters' apartment.
Hey ... you want to gawk, do it on your own time. You want to work with me, stay focused.
Nothing. How's it going with the Sheriff?
I need someone without an agenda. 
This isn't O.J.
I know what I'm doing.
Hey.
How's it going?
The odometer of the Maserati had 142 miles on it. The car dealer said that the vehicle only had nine miles when DelHomme picked it up. That means Delhomme drove it for 133 miles. If you do the math, that makes the search radius approximately 66 miles.
It's probably where she hooked up with DelHomme.
That explains the blood and the hair in the back seat of the Maserati.
That's Devil's Smile.
Chance to be a hero. Girl's beautiful. These guys don't get many chances.
To rescue a princess.
Hey, hey! Hold on. Nobody touch the crime scene. We do this right.
All right ... I want you to search every trash can, drainage ditch, dump site between here and the city. We're looking for a shovel, a purse, anything else that looks like it belonged to her.
Sleeping Beauty.
Nature preserved her.
Loose sandy soil, shady area, November temperatures -- it was like a freezer. 
A girl this beautiful wouldn't zip up this far.
She's not wearing any makeup.
We think there may be a connection to the Robyn Knight case from last year.
Well, only skeletal remains were found. There's nothing definitive to connect Delhomme to the murder.
Howard, just help us with one thing. How did this happen?
I understand. Photographer. Model. Had to get the light just right.
Mmm ... can't do anything until we figure this out.
Well, the problem I have with that is the dealer representative specifically stated that no model was hired to appear in the photos.
So, you took photographs of Julie?
Any idea where they are?
Well, if you remember, let me know. 
Guy we're looking at was 180-plus.
He must have hit her, which ripped her earring out.
Was there any evidence of sexual assault?
Anything else?
On the day of her dinner with the producers of Real Vegas Showgirls. She'd be like Dorothy racing for Oz. There's no way that she slowed down to get drunk.
But in order to have a postmortem level of .18 ...
So, that's three shots in an hour? He could have forced her to drink.
Robbins rushed the protocol. Released Julie's body to her parents.
Mmm. Thousands of girls come to vegas every year just hoping to beat the odds.
And some of them don't.
Sexual assault kit had no semen, no trace evidence.
Now I'm confused. Julie Waters died of positional asphyxia. That means that someone sat on her chest, and ... two years ago, you were arrested for forced oral cop. 
Just one more thing from the autopsy report. Julie was drinking.
Why didn't you tell me this before?
Just set it on the counter.  Could you please get me a pair of gloves and an evidence bag? 
Thanks.
Okay.
When did you get this?
It was mailed two days ago. There's no return address. How do you know your brother sent this?
Was there a note in the envelope?
If I get arrested. Now, why would he think that?
I'm guessing he's trying to create an alibi 
Something's off, though. White shoes, black stockings, and all ripped up. Not to mention these aren't the clothes that we found her in.
Now, what is this?
Is that Julie's body?
Archie, let me know when you've got these printed up.
Here's our little lie. Delhomme said that he took her out to photograph her because she had no more head shots. Needed new ones.
Explains how he cleaned her up.
Here's her clothes.
First thing you learn as a model -- bring several outfits with you. You never know what the photographer might like.
Here's our big lie. Delhomme said when she injured her earlobe, she was in her underwear and she was barefoot.
Capital investment. Our victim hadn't made it to the show yet. Her life was all about after the show. The right guy, the right meal, and after that ...
Did your father ever tell you you were pretty?
He ever tell you you were smart?
So, it probably never occurred to you that you wouldn't be successful. If all you ever hear is that you're gorgeous, you can let everything else fall away, and it can leave you in a very dangerous place. Okay, the bloodstain on the top of the foot is round. Gravitational. On the bottom of the foot, it's smeared.
The only way we can get this guy is if the evidence counters every one of his lies.
That matches the drop on the top of her stocking. Separate bloodstain. Separate drop.
And there was none to help her.
She knew.
Well, it's got to be here. We found this guy in pieces, and putting himself together ever since. If we don't find something, he's going to walk out of here and forget about this like a bad dream.
The odometers don't match.
What's on the rest of the double-exposed roll?
Archie, do you have the SART photos from the autopsy?
We need to compare bodies.
Uh, why don't you guys take a break?
They bother me.
The naked pictures weren't of Julie.
At this point I don't care why he did it. What do you have?
Look, the entire lab didn't need to see pictures of Julie's v*g1n* plastered all over the screen.
I saw the look in Howard's eye. I used to make my living off that look. He wanted me. We needed him. I decided to exploit that situation. And as angry as that made you, when you're in my shoes, you'll do the same thing.
We're looking at the wrong evidence. His initial arrest was for brandishing a firearm.
We waiting on a new one?
Is that what you like? Being alone with a woman?
Take her out in the middle of nowhere.
You slapped her.
Then you violated her.
Julie Waters' cervical tissue was on your gun sight. 
What's the matter? Couldn't swallow it when you saw her all over the TV?
I had help.
They're good. They're pros.
All he had to do was stay quiet.
She couldn't get away from him and he couldn't get away from her.
We'll photo-document the scene. Overalls from all angles. Aerials as well.
I'm going to start marking the evidence.
Got a sig-sauer. Probably the driver's.
Okay.
Yes.
Right. And the bullets from the Camaro's trunk?
I've never seen anything like that.
Penetration, not perforation. Why?
... but not the plane.
Left some clothes behind ... and a paper shredder. I'll bag it.)
Dr. Amerian, 4:00 P.M. Oh, today. 
I'll make an appointment.
That's your right, Mr. Dunbar.
Warrant for your clothes.
Strip. Everything in the bag.
There was rocket fuel in the bomb and rocket fuel on your t-shirt.
Mrs. Dunbar, could you and your son wait outside, please?
The three ingredients to make lava flow.
In fifth grade, I built one of these as my science fair project. It was awesome. First place should've been mine. But they ended up giving it to this kid with some lame red ant colony.
That was you.
Uh-huh.
Right.
Well, what about that volcano? Your husband said that he helped your son build it.
Mrs. Dunbar, your husband told us that he was in sales.
As far as you know, has he talked about his job with anyone else? Any other family members? Friends?
Mm-hmm. His apartment.
Roger A. Dunbar. Roger B. Dunbar. That's an easy way to separate out expenses.
2175 La Pressa.
822 Devon, Mesquite.
1845 Galewood, Henderson.
His son.
Well, according to his wife, his mother's deceased. He's an only child. So, that leaves a daughter. Well, there's no way there was a kid at that apartment.
Forget secret agent. Roger Dunbar was living a secret life.
Good evening. We're with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
Is this your husband?
You're currently married to him?
Well, your husband is a suspect in a criminal investigation. Currently, he's in police custody.
He helped you build it?
We found a band-aid with your daughter Amy's blood at your apartment. So, you bring your daughter there, but not your wives?
Mr. Dunbar, we collected both of your children's volcanoes and supplies. And we found a pair of pliers at your home in Henderson. Those pliers were used to make both of the volcanoes.
I'm just really confused. Um ... your wife, Beth, told us that you couldn't build a volcano to save your soul. Yet your wife, Debbie, claims that it was all you that made your daughter's volcano. So, what is it?
When did you borrow those pliers?
You never returned them to your wife, Beth?
Same characteristics. We got a match. 
Take her in.
We found these pliers in your car's glove box. You used them to fix the hose bib. And to ... make a bomb.
Why didn't you just leave him? Turn him in? 
Mrs. Dunbar, you killed three innocent people.
You can't possibly call that thing my office. It's a cupboard.
Hello, I'm Catherine.  We need to talk.
Hey.
With the worst hangover a guy could ever have.
Massive hemorrhaging.
Is this from a single wound? Cracked skull. Did you I.D. her?
Well, she's got some breast implants. That's for sure.
I'm going to guess stripper. She's got a locker room key.
We'll trace it back to the club.
You can say that again.
Looks like she went back into the bedroom to call for help.
Why is it you guys can never hit the bowl?
Right.
How does a guy fall asleep after killing a woman?
You sure it wasn't the booze?
Well, if she drugged you, sir, it'll still be in your system. A blood test would be in your best interest.
I know. Vartann called. Nicole Richards, 25. Her stage name is Raven. We traced the locker room key to the Embassy Strip Club. Your turn.
That's almost four times the legal limit.
That would explain why there was so much blood at the scene.
Well, you ever try shaking your ass in four-inch heels? 
Blood standard, unknown urine, tell me it's the same guy. Now, Greg mentioned to you that my stuff gets done first, right?
It's uh, quiet in here. Greg played music.
Carl Johnson?
Runs security at the Embassy Strip Club.
Thumbprint on the towel bar?
Yeah.
You let your girlfriend turn tricks?
Fresh wounds. You get those kicking guys out of the embassy, or ... kicking your girlfriend's ass? I don't think that you were cool with her ways. A big, strong guy like you, you're not gonna share her. She didn't tell you where she was going. You followed her, and you killed her.
I need your clothes.
Hi. Chris here?
I'm Catherine.
Hi.
I'm checking out an alibi. Was this guy in here last night?
I'm working late.
Yeah, and he didn't change his clothes from last night. I screened them for blood -- negative. And the tox report on Mr. Johnson confirms traces of triazelam in his blood.
No.
Hit the lights.
The victim had a swollen ankle. What if this bracelet is an anklet?
By then Johnson had passed out from the triazelam.
The more docile the john, the easier the job, except when you need him to save your life.
Try explaining this to your family back in Ohio.
I'm Catherine Willows. I'm with the Crime Lab.
No.
He's brain dead?
Tell me about his injuries.
Well, those are shoe prints on his face, which suggests that he was attacked while he was down.
Mr. Mendez. I'm Catherine Willows, with the Las Vegas Crime Lab. Are you sure?
Well, there's only one way to find out. I'll have to take his prints.
Hey, Mia. Did you finish processing the batons?
Which means that a police baton never connected with Sam Mendez. He had to already be down when the cops entered the cell. Thanks.
Yeah?
We are almost finished with our investigation, but I can tell you that the victim's prints don't match the Sam Mendez that's wanted for murder.
It was a routine traffic stop. The arresting officer ran the name and got an immediate warrant hit.
An arrest warrant for murder and two guys with the same name.
No one's saying that you didn't.
With all due respect, Lieutenant, that really doesn't sound like the Warrick Brown I know.
Thanks.
Have a seat.
Lieutenant Chen dropped by.
To complain about you. Wish you told me you had a beef with him.
Well ...  ... I'm the supervisor of the swing shift. I'm responsible for the whole team. It's my job to make sure that we remain objective and professional.
Well, I'm not Grissom. He let a lot of things slide that I won't.
The evidence cleared the extraction team. You owe Lieutenant Chen an apology.
From now on, anything that happens at a crime scene, I'm your first phone call.
We now know the cops were not responsible, so that leaves us with thirty-four suspects, all with rap sheets. Is there anything to narrow the focus?
Well, the official C.O.D. was blunt force trauma to the head, not stomping.
Well, that all sounds good, but why go to all that trouble?
The last thing the guy wanted to do was to get caught with a gun that had a body on it.
Taking your pet for a walk?
That is so thoughtful. Now tell me why you really stopped by. You checking up on me?
What've you heard? Who talked to you?
When I was your right-hand and your left, I always knew that if it hit the fan, that you'd be the one to get dirty.
Yeah, that's the job.  Did you ever play politics?
I'm going to guess that you didn't vote for yourself.
Your loss was my gain.
Yes, and when is that going to change?
Any signs of foul play?
Are you guys satisfied?
Then get one.
My problem, not yours.
What ... what is going on?
Do you know how much ballistic joe costs?
I just thought you guys were gonna go over your notes, look over the case file.
So, you're saying the victim was electrocuted?
Watch it wiggle, see it jiggle, I get it. Well, you're gonna need at least six milliamps to prove your theory.
Congratulations. You killed the jeep, but the victim's still alive. The current never even made it past zero. So, either your theory is wrong, or you've got a problem with your experiment. Are there any variables in the case that haven't been duplicated here?
Well, let's dress him up.
It needed an entry point and exit point.
Right across his heart, stopping it cold.
So I know that I've never said this to you guys before, but ... hide the evidence.
We're a team, guys.
No. I'm the boss.
Then I'm sure you know the case is now closed.
Yeah, you should have given me the day shift. But I'm making it work.
Well done.
So time of death roughly 1:00 A.M. 
C.O.D.?
Ripped out in chunks.
And a lot of hatred. So her eyebrows have been shaved off and drawn back on with eyeliner. I know that's popular among Latinos in 28th Street. She could be a banger or a girlfriend of one.
What is that, nine digits? Social Security number.
Okay, start with those, but make sure you run the partials off the box as well 'cause I got Ecklie looking over my shoulder, so, uh ... 
Yes.
Well, that's why bangers have girlfriends; sign things they can't.
Sure is.
Gangbanger girlfriend with a degree?
Well, there's no signs of sexual activity.
Oh, hang on now.
You could be up for a week straight on that stuff and not even know it.
Looks like a mariachi band with artillery. 
The band?
Okay. We've got a female victim with a degree, Mexican artwork, drugs and Sinaloan cowboys.
Hi.
What is this?
They were found the next dawn, in a dry river bed, their intestines exposed, and many cats feasting upon them.
Narco what?
A drug ballad.
So apart from having her hair removed, Veronica Juarez's murder was life imitating art.
We don't even know that much about the victim, other than she was somewhere between art lover and meth user.
Something I said?
We ran Ms. Juarez's social. She wasn't an employee.
Had she received any threats?
Well, that just means he didn't place the head in the box. The vic's blood was on the jacket in his store. She was run over by a Toyo Open Country MT 38-by-15.5-by-18.
Now, that's a big-ass truck tire.
Take a look.
Invoice copies of any retreads that were done on this type of tire.
Really?
Thank you.
And then?
Narcocorridos also depicts actual events.
So you're saying that she deserved to die?
After her tox screen, we know that Miss Juarez didn't do drugs. And ... I seriously doubt that she was having s*x with you.
We're not in Sinaloa.
Worse news, his tire treads don't match the ones on Veronica Juarez's leather jacket, either.
I can't make any promises, sir, but I don't think the Paiute wore heels.
Hey! What's it look like?
It makes our job a lot harder.
Okay.  Gentlemen! Start your shovels!
Do you think our Jane Doe was buried alive?
Nick, did you get that last soil sample? 
I don't know if she was buried alive, but ... she wasn't buried alone.
This looks like ... barbed wire.
Or maybe some kind of torture device.
Oh, I don't know what I'm thinking.
I'm not sure yet. Obviously I can't saw through without potentially destroying evidence, so ... if the tar were harder, I could chisel it. If it were softer, we could peel it off.
Of course you do, but last I checked, the backlog on grave was about ... mmm ... a hundred cases? 
You ever done this before?
Okay, Mr. Wizard.
Not much left of her but the clothes.
No, no, no. You're not going to just destroy this skull and split.
I'm short-handed as it is.
Sara. You're mine tonight.
My God.
Thank you, Sara.
Well, Doc Robbins told me that she had severe trauma to the skull, probably what killed her.
Distal phalanges were cut off. Both vics, both hands. I cast tool marks, looks like some kind of opposed blade tool. Jagged on one side, smooth on the other.
Yeah.
So we've got a killer who digs a grave, dumps a body, covers it with tar, comes back three years later, digs again and dumps another one on top of it?
Mr. Melton, take a seat.
And when was the last time that you saw Svetlana?
And then what happened?
Yet you didn't file a missing persons report.
Well, we're gonna need a list of Svetlana's friends and family.
Russia?
How did the two of you meet?
Did the wife ask for help?
You can't arrest someone for marrying the wrong person.
If the guy's an abuser, if he killed his first wife, we will build a case and we will nail him.
Sara, I was there -- there wasn't a mark on her.
You know ... every time we get a case with a hint of domestic violence or abuse, you go off the deep end. What is your problem?
I don't want to talk about it. Okay, so, this is the jacket that Svetlana was wearing the night that she went into the hospital?
So I'll see if the husband's willing to give us a comparison.
So he was telling the truth?
Nyet.
Well, maybe Andrew found out that Svetlana wasn't as lonely as he thought she was.
Nothing.
Mm-mm.
Greg, she crossed the line with a suspect; she was inappropriate with me and with Ecklie; she needs the time off.
Nothing from Ken Wellstone?
Well, she worked in a hair salon.
Hair dye was present when she was being attacked.
True, but his story is so absurd I almost buy it.
So, you can't sell your kids, but you can buy their mother.
It's not supposed to be simple. Complicated is the whole point.
Yeah.
Ugh ... !
Jagged on one side, smooth on the other.
I got blood spatter next to the hair dye.
These chairs don't match.
I think somebody's hiding something.
So, we know who the blood belongs to. We just can't prove it.
Hang on. There's something else.
A recycled love token. Now, that's tacky.
But it's cause for a warrant.
Do you believe this?
Locks his wife out.
Control her food, control her destiny, I don't know.
Or help.
Svetlana's blood was on the necklace worn by Andrew Melton's current child bride.
All righty. We know that this guy did it. How do we prove it?
And both girls' fingertips were removed by blending shears.
And the only people with full access to the salon are Chloe and Vlad.
Okay, here's what I wanted to show you. The facts just don't match up.
What action are you taking?
I had to see with my own eyes. You're actually autopsying a bear.
Yeah. You have a cause of death on him?
It's lead. No copper jacket. So, the copper jacket had to have come from his rifle. But this is from a handgun.
Except he didn't have a pistol. Or a knife, for that matter. And his stomach has been slashed open.
Really?
So, Robbins confirmed that our vic was killed by the bear.
Uh, not quite. I spoke with the Ranger. There's no way that a Kodiak bear just wanders into Nevada, so whoever smuggled him in could be charged with homicide.
The bear could be considered a lethal weapon.
What's up?
I see.
Well, the microchip was registered to you. Take a look.
A broker?
Well, we're going to need to see some paperwork.
Yeah, so do we.
I, uh, talked to the zoo in Columbus. They never heard of Tippy.
The Department of Agriculture never issued a license for a Ken Bovitz. Documents are fake. I sent them to Q.D. for analysis.
And what about Kodiaks? NICK: That would be a no. Mr. Hollis's wife's on her way to P.D., so I'm gonna head over there right now.
So Robbins sent the bear's blood to tox. It turns out there were elevated levels of ketamine in its system.
Yeah.
I'm sorry. There's just no sport in that. It's just sick.
And they drug the animals?
But in our case, both the hunter and the prey ended up dead.
Mm-hmm. A simple forgery, but it doesn't get us any closer to our suspect.
Of course.
I see it.
Thanks.
We know it was.
Aaron Colite worked here, right?
You fired him?
We suspect that Aaron figured out a way to make a buck, and he asked for your help.
Mr. Hollis probably thought that he had killed the bear, and he raced over to claim his trophy.
His shot only stunned the bear. It was Aaron's shot that killed it.
You're looking at grand larceny and obtaining property under false pretenses.
I'm recommending to the DA that he add another charge: Second degree murder ... 
... for the death of the hunter.
What's going on? This is my scene.
If it's all hands on deck, what are you doing behind the tape?
And when was the last time you testified?
I need help, not supervision.
So, he either jumped, fell or was pushed.
Let's talk to the wife.) 
I smell crap.
Don't take another step.
The Eigers have any pets?
Okay.
I saved you from putting your foot in it.
Yeah?
I'll be right there.
Well, if he was pushed, they'd have to be strong enough to get that big boy over the railing.
The only clue is no clue.
The inner sanctum.
Scotch ... and milk.
What are they doing on the floor?
Thanks for waiting. Got here as fast as I could.
Grissom, what the hell? Am I going to have any part of this case, or should I just go back to my office and start shuffling some papers?
So, is this an Ecklie mandate, or is this just your thoughtlessness?
Thanks. I feel much better.
You didn't touch my camera, did you?
I have a 256 memory card. This is a 32. Somebody switched it out and took my crime scene photos.
We have a problem.
The memory card from my digital camera was stolen and switched with a blank. The only time the camera was out of my possession was at the crime scene.
I don't know. I dusted the camera and the card. There weren't any prints. All of the crime scene photos of the body and the blood evidence were on that card.
Well, I know that the scene's been released.
Okay.
Mrs. Eiger! Mrs. Eiger, please stop.
I need to take additional photos of the crime scene. If you could just put the hose aside and ...
Uh, men just don't appreciate us.
You know, I think you're better off without him, anyway.
Catherine.
Sara and Greg went through these cans last night. They were empty.
Evidently.
Uh, Warrick?
Mm-hmm.
Well, we can probably get DNA from the blood. But to confirm that Eiger actually wore this thing, Mia's going to have to test the urine inside. Lucky girl.
Do you think Donna always takes her laundry to the city dump?
... a freak.
Were gonna have to take this back to the house and look at it in its original context.
I mean, we're not even certain this rug came from this room.
A man with secrets needs a place to hide them.
Wow. Just when you thought you'd seen it all.
So we're back to suicide?
I think that Bruce just wanted the same thing as every other guy.
Easy access.
Well, I guess we won't get to see who swaddled him.
Do you think they do takeout?
Oh, hey.
Yeah.
It's a safe assumption that it's his.
Well, I know that his blood work came back clean.
Yeah?
Those are mine.
Thank you, Conrad.
Is Foxy short for anything?
Yeah, your friends at KRAC take obstruction of justice seriously. You stole police department evidence in a homicide investigation. You're guilty of theft and possession of stolen property.
Why would he do that?
So in the absence of scandal, Magli created some.
Two voids ... one pointing towards 11:00, one towards 1:00.
Something in a size eight.
I don't think so. It's a fine mist. A spatter.  I think he was still alive, expirating blood.
I wonder what was going through her mind when she stood there and watched him die?
That drug spike that Mia detected in Bruce's diaper -- Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds... L-S-D. But I don't get it, because acid trips last for hours. Why wouldn't it have shown up in his bloodstream?
Well, there are good trips, and bad trips, and trips right off the balcony.
Maybe not his choice.
An enema.
So the acid was no doubt supplied by the same sweet thing who gave him breast milk from that ... boobs-ahoy dress.
Your fingerprints are all over the nursery. The DNA that we took from your breast pump matches the milk from Bruce's fridge. And the arresting officer confiscated LSD from your purse.
You knew this man's most intimate secret. You could've left him.
What were you afraid of?
And you believed him?
Tanya, this man exploited you for five years. He didn't allow you to see your only child and ... there he was, high as a kite and you're the only one there. Are you saying that you didn't offer him any encouragement off that balcony?
Which part? The part where I got in your face or the part where I, uh, lost evidence, or uh, maybe you just miss me.
Really. Thank you.
Yeah.
So, is Tanya going to take the fall?
Any more culpable than his wife, who just let him lie there?
But diapers?
Grissom. 
What's the deal? You're coming to my crime scenes before I get to them now?
Guess you missed me.
Oh. Ew.
Well, out here, I guess there's, uh, rodents, coyote, buzzards ...
... occasional mountain lion.
What do we have here? A little ice?
Las Vegas ... greenbacks?
Now, that's what I call a rat hole. 
You saying you don't like me as your boss?
I got a shot cup.  Doesn't make any sense, 'cause our vic was definitely shot point blank.
Yeah.
Typical pump-action. Holds four in the mag, one in the pipe.
This was a chase.
We know where it ended, so ... let's find where it began.
And the vic wasn't dressed for either.
What you got?
Hang on.
Damn. This beaver's doing nice work.
I want two people in the room at all times, double counts, every pile. If you don't agree, do it all again.
Yeah.
Let's hear it.
Okay, what's his name?
All right, well, give it to Brass. We'll follow up.
Hey.
So, uh, Brass got a home address on the runner, Lou Barnes. He's looking into it. What are you still doing here anyway?
Line moves? Got to say, the only thing that sports book means to me is guys without showers.
Yeah, I know.
So if I were to place a bet on Duke, they would have to win by more than 15 in order for me to win the bet.
Yeah, everybody's throwing money on Duke. Big favorite.
Which means that Louisville could lose by 24 and still win the bet.
So, why would you bet on the underdog if you had already put money on the favorite?
He got more than 17 and less than . He won both bets.
Uh, Charlotte. My mom grew up in North Carolina.
What do I get if I win?
I'll take your action.
So, unless we find our murder weapon, the case against Urbana is circumstantial at best.
You were a sports betting guy.
Oh!
My team loses, but I still win that bet.
What's the name?
Yeah.  Professional boxer from '79 to '85. After that, he spent a lot of time in Vegas as a bouncer, bartender, handyman. Just another one of those broken down, punch-drunk bums.
Oh. So maybe Urbana hired his former boxing buddy to do his dirty work.
Dabo grabs most of the cash, goes back to Russell's body, takes the wallet, ID, takes off his face.
Let's put out a broadcast.
You find a weapon?
Boy's not even safe in his own bed.
I'll take the inside.
Well, I bagged the bloody sheets from the bed. Found boxers, a t-shirt and a fitted sheet in the washer. ALS'd for blood, found urine.
Consistent with a pipe?
He's got no defense wounds.
Yeah, I got a hair off of Ty's t-shirt. Also consistent with Matt.
Yeah.
Uh, blue fibers. Got them off the vic's t-shirt.
No, but you know, could be from a blanket, a carpet, towel. I'll take them to Trace.
He can move as fast as wants. The D.A. won't file without the physical evidence. And right now, we got nothing.
Yeah?
Anything probative?
Yeah?
So we've got three suspects, three scenarios.
Or dad could have worn it and dumped it in the park.
Not our problem at the moment. Let's just stay focused on the sweater. It's tied to the victim and this scene. We need to tie it to the killer. Hey, how tall would you say Matt Hawkins?
Meet me in the garage in half an hour.
Okay, Warrick, you are approximately the height of Martin Hawkins. Nick, you and the homeless dude are about the same, and Judy, you're close to Matt.
The table is the same height as Ty's bed - forty-three and half inches from the floor to the top of the mattress. The white sweaters, which you all look so adorable in, are the same fabric as the bloody one.
The pipes are the same diameter as the wounds on Ty's face. I want each of you to take a whack at our victim.
Uh, spatter up.
Judy, your sweater -- killer.
No key, no access.
Where the hell were they?
... as she ran down the stairs.
Yeah, way should be.
Struggle?
Maybe murder-suicide.
You thinking professional hit?
Loose end.
I've got some long hairs on the pillow -- brunette. Wife was a blonde.
Yeah.
Oh, I'm sorry, David. We're going to need to keep the bodies in their original position for a while longer. 
I'm sure he's hoping they'll give us one for free.
Let me guess: Gun was clean.
Never underestimate the fragility of the male ego.
And what about the daughter?
Any trauma to the body?
Broken rib. Now, I know the paramedics performed CPR ...
So maybe this all started with the accidental death of a child.
Wife tells her husband, whose mental state is already hanging by a thread ...
Except how do you perform CPR on your child and then toss her back into the pool?
It's hard to look and not touch, isn't it?
Have something for me?
Well, so far, you haven't told me anything I didn't already know.
Uh, looks like a thermometer.
Do tell.
Yes. And most thermometers aren't that specific.
... during ovulation. I know. It maximizes your chance of conception. So ... Corinne Stewart, I guess, was trying to have another baby.
Or with whom.
Which is normal.
Not normal. The 21 allele is outside the normal range.
Tara Matthews' DNA in Morgan Stewart's bed.
So the lighter blew up in her hand? Are you saying that she ... set herself on fire?
Well, Tara Matthews was having s*x with Morgan Stewart. So, if she attempted suicide several hours after the Stewarts died, she's a possible suspect.
Yeah. It was crushed on the master bedroom floor. Why?
I was just looking at Corinne Stewart's autopsy report. Uh ... she had a tubal ligation, so ... she obviously wasn't trying to have kids.
So it's been confirmed. Tara Matthews is pregnant.
A mother's body is designed to protect her baby. I don't know, all that trauma and morphine ... it'll be a miracle if she brings it to term.
Too early to tell. She's just a few weeks pregnant.
Neal could've been shooting blanks. GRISSOM: Well, medical records will confirm that.
Neal catches Morgan in bed with his wife ... 
And now, he knows where the best friend keeps his gun.
Clothes are easy to dump. The glass was an oversight; he didn't even know it was there. 
Which leaves Tara.
Not everything.
Did you do a wet mount?
Well, Warrick found several used condoms at the scene. Killer must have run out, and started riding bareback.
Enough to rule out rape?
Maybe that's all the killer had to work with.
Well, that's kind of like turning a sock inside out.
Well, what about the epithelials under her nails?
So where does that leave us?
Oh, Nick?
I heard you were looking for the student directory for Butterfield Academy.
I pay tuition.
Mm-hmm.
She was at a crossroads and I, uh, needed to put her in a school with tighter reins. You know, when it comes to your kids, you, uh, find the money.
You looking for a prom date?
Good luck.
Who found him?
Like a rock in a tumbler.
I'll get it to narco.
Or a person.
Aren't we at least gonna draw straws?
Hey. Did I ever tell you that the city paid me a dollar a square foot to rip out my lawn and replace it with rocks because we're in a drought?
No.
Grissom. We got another body.
Is that you, Warrick?
Phew.
Looks like an aquasock.
Here's its mate.  Kind of upscale for a tunnel rat. So the vic was barefoot. The tunnel's full of murder weapons. Bum kills him, or finds the body and takes the socks? What was the guy doing here in the first place?
The way the body was ground down means that the water took him for a pretty long ride.
Excuse me!
Down here!
Uh, no problem, sir. I'm just wanting to know what street I'm on. Under.
Thank you.
Don't bother.
All right, so we're about a mile south of where we started.
What, do we, uh, eenie-meenie-minie-mo it? Split up? What do we do?
Fits with the aquasocks.
I knew you were gonna say that.  Watch your head.
We gotta be into some golden time by now, right?
What do we have here?  There's something in the lid.
Hang on to that.
Hey, it's our dead guy.
Calvin Berkowitz. Worked at the Tangiers. Lifeguard. So what's Calvin doing down here?
Yeah?
Oh, I heard about that. He grabs an inner tube, a helmet, jumps into the channel.
Current takes him down.
This isn't about drugs or beating up homeless dudes. It's just plain stupidity.
Hey, you know something? This is, uh, right around where I found Lindsay.
Yeah, when Eddie's car went off the road.
Ugh ... let's just get out of here. Can you take that?
Hey. Oh.
Yeah, I think.
Well, animal bones can fool you. Pig's feet or sheep ribs are not much different from yours or mine.
Yep. We're gonna have to flush the line.
Rip it.
Warrick.
I got some bones here.
Yeah. I got part of a rib. Uh-huh. I can see the costal groove. And it's too deep to be an animal's. These bones are human.
This is the sewage vault.
And the bones look pretty old, so it could just be from a grave robber getting rid of his leftovers.
If we're gonna find where the bones came from, we gotta work our way up.
Oh.
Well, large bones wouldn't travel down the line as far as the small ones, so at least we're getting closer to the source.
Lots of backed up toilets.
Okay.
Yeah.
Right. So the blockage has gotta be from the main line. One more vault down the street.
Jackpot.
Oh, man.
Uh. Florazene reacts to feces as well as blood, so I know that you're not looking for blood.
And the only way the water would rise is if there's something blocking the pipe.
And loose bones wouldn't do that.
Tissue decomposes until there's not enough body left to withstand the pressure.
Probably made before decomposition, and not from hitting any obstruction in the sewer line. Stab wounds.
Okay. Geography first?
There's no one particularly close.
Missing six weeks, eleven weeks, eleven months. That's not long enough. The condition of the bones suggested the body's been decomposing for at least two years. 
Well, why don't you clear an area and we'll process behind you.
I don't have a problem with authority.
This looks like the point of origin.
Yeah, this is Catherine Willows for Captain Brass.
Don't bother.
The lowest point of spatter is 46 inches above the ground with a downward angle. Even if those dogs could walk upright, they couldn't have done this. Kid's a liar.
Let me guess. He lawyered up.
Hmm. And what about the wife and son?
I cast the stab marks in the victim's ribs. Bone deterioration removed all the individual characteristics. The best we can do is rule out the serrated blade.
Hey, what about the kid's videos?
A teenage boy with a shoe box full of home movies under his bed?
DNA from Travis Giles' tooth matched the blood that we found in your house.
Now you're lying. 
Travis was stabbed twice. That's not possible if he just fell on the knife.
Then why did you dump the body down a sewer in the middle of the night?
He didn't do it alone. We found the victim's charred clothing folded. Kids don't fold anything, mothers do. You helped him clean up the mess.
Well, we really don't need a confession.
Hi.
Husband and wife got into it.
She caught him with a hooker in their bed. She cut him. He killed her.
She grabbed his wallet and took off. I caught the guy just sitting on a curb. I swabbed his hands for blood spatter.
He's not going anywhere. Thanks, Mia.
Oh, hey, guys. I could really use a drink. You want to join me? I'm buying.
You did?
All right. 
Okay.
Bruised, but not broken.
No, I'm good, thanks.
You?
Uh, yes, I have a daughter.
If I don't get home soon, I will be in trouble. 
Thanks. I needed this.
I can't do this tonight. I ... I'll call you.
Go to hell.
Hello.
Mom, Mom. Grissom just called. I've got to go in. I'm backing up grave.
I brushed my teeth. 
Hey, listen, Lindsey's got a dentist appointment before school. I wrote all the information down in the kitchen.
Okay? Thank you.
You're welcome.
Clotted blood hasn't retracted yet.
We have an ID?
I walked into a door. Can we not talk about it?
No cartridge casings.
Maybe she knew her attacker.
Can you open it up?
Thank you.
I found a gun under the seat. 
.22 Beretta.
I'm not in the mood.
Did you see her leave with anyone?
Which cab company?
Doesn't explain the gun.
Thank you.
I thought judges were supposed to be color blind.
I found some particulate on the jacket. Not sure what it is. I'll get it to Hodges.
Can I see that?
You know, I've got to go pick up Lindsey. Could you cover for me?
Thanks.
Lindsey!
What happened to the trash?
Yeah, I'm great.
Can't get into this now, Mother. I'm in a jam.
Save the sermon.
There but for the grace of God ... 
Damn it.
I threw something away. It's gone.
Yeah? Uh ... yeah, just wait till I get there. Yeah. 
Mom ...
Oh. What do you have for me?
I know.
I know.
We found the .22 in Alice's car.
Is that when you gave her the gun?
You know where we can find Jeff Simon?
Look, we can get a court order.
I'm gonna check out his truck.
Gil, the suspect has a laptop in his vehicle that has a GPS unit that's honed in on the lab.
I know. That's why I'm calling.
Yeah.
Thanks.
He was tracking her car. Let's bring him in.
Is that your idea of love? Stalking her with a GPS unit?
Well, there's a problem with your story. She called a cab.
Cut the crap. We found trace amounts of automotive sheet metal on her clothing. You work around cars. If Alice picked it up from you, you were in violation of the T.R.O.
It was over, Jeff. She didn't want you to be her lover, her protector. She didn't want you within a hundred yards. Whatever trace from you we found on her was fresh.
You were living a fantasy, thinking you still had a chance. When reality set in, you killed her.
Do you have a minute?
Okay, uh, it really is only gonna take a minute. Um, I just need to have a conversation with you.
Right.
Two?
Are you saying that all the DNA evidence from the last two days has to be resubmitted and retested?
How the hell did that happen? 
It's proof he lost track of her.
Which they'll probably kick down to a misdemeanor because she's dead.
You got a name?
Mr. Novak ... I'm Catherine Willows, CSI.
We should ask for his clothes. Black leather jacket, black t-shirt, jeans.
This is what I was trying to tell you.
He's not lying about anything that pertains to me.
No, it was an accident. But ... by the time it happened, he wasn't who I thought he was, and ... that scared me.
I have nothing to be ashamed of.
I met Adam Novak in a bar called the Highball.
I had one cocktail, on his tab. He walked me out to my car. Things got physical.
I believe that I outlined the specifics in my memo.
I didn't have s*x with him, though he clearly wanted it.
I went out after shift to unwind. I even invited Warrick and Nick to come along. They had other plans.
Yeah. I got into my car. He went back inside.
This is just a theory, but ... she was drunk, probably more compliant than I was. He walked her outside. He waited with her for the taxi, offered her a ride ... 
We'll finish this later?
Yeah. Like the other night.
Can you remove the jacket?
Looks like a small-caliber gunshot wound ... like the first victim.
Grave is working a case with similarities. That victim left a bar called the Highball shortly before she was killed. I'm wondering if Holly went out last night.
Thanks.
There's two sets of shoe prints ... with a bit of distance between the strides. Which means they were both running.
Well, there's only one shot fired in Grissom's case.
I'm thinking that she was attacked near her house ... and then made a run for it.
Got a courthouse keycard. For the parking lot.
Adam Novak's a public defender. Let's run his prints against this.
Anyone write their number on a matchbook?
So ... you're having a good time and ... Holly had had enough.
When Holly left, did you see that man again?
Hell of a backlog, here, doc.
Holly Pearson?
.25 caliber. It's the same as the first victim.
She bit her attacker ... when he tried to kiss her.
Mom, Lindsey, go inside the house.
Mom, we're fine. Take Lindsey inside.
Lindsey.
No. I'm coming in. I want to hear about your day.
What the hell are you doing here?
I want you out of here.
You want to talk to me, call your lawyer. Set up an appointment down at PD.
Back off.
If you take one more step.
You came to my house.
Nick.
The center console. Was there a parking lot car key inside?
Suspect claims some incriminating evidence found at the second crime scene wasn't his. It looks like he was lying. We got him.
The Slim Jim.
And then locked the car back up. Novak wouldn't be the wiser until he drove into the courthouse again. Did you find any prints?
Run 'em.
Have you been in Adam Novak's car recently?
Then why did we find your prints in it?
No, but I think that you're familiar with the concept. You were obsessed with Alice, and when you saw Adam having at her, you flipped out.
I mean, here's a woman that you can't get any traction with, yet she's willing to do a stranger she picked up in a bar.
I mean, lucky for you, the Highball was Adam's second home.
The next night, you came back and saw his car in the parking lot. Creative justice. You could get them both.
It was just bad luck that Holly Pearson met Adam that night.
You had no reason to kill her, but you followed her home and worked up the nerve.
You made one mistake, though. The evidence that you used to frame him brought us back to you
Gil.
I'd ask you out for a drink, but under the circumstances, it's, uh ...
Okay, how long is this going to go on?
Gil, it was an act of omission.
I went out after work. Is it a crime to want a little human contact?
Bill Bennett? Guy who owns the Sahara?
I thought you said you were a dork in high school.
I don't doubt that. Hey, Dave.
Pin the tail on the donkey gone wrong?
The only pathway is from the paramedics. How'd he end up in the middle of the circle?
Mm. You have C.O.D.?
A young man's heart stops, and you don't know why?
For every action, there is an opposite but equal reaction.
Hey, Archie.
Freeze the frame, Archie.
Let's see who owns it.
Are you Morgan Wendel?
That's right, yeah.
Kevin thought that he was being pushed out of a helicopter a thousand feet in the air, but ...
The pilot gave us the name of the cameraman, who supplied the tape voluntarily.
When you saw that he wasn't moving, you just took off. That sounds like guilt to me.
When the jury sees that tape, you'll be going all the way ... to jail. Second-degree murder. Twenty-five to life.
I got some white fibers on Nick's vest.
Smells like alcohol.
Why'd you bag that?
It's the wrong color tape. No initials on the seal. That's not Nick's evidence.
Oh, my two favorite guys. So, I've got an assault at Stripperama and a trash run at Flamingo and Koval. I'm too busy to play favorites, so duke it out.
Dumpster's clean. 
No apparent blood or body parts.
A lure. To grab Nick.
David, get this stuff to the doc.
We're going to get him back, David.
Dog entrails.
That's not going to help.
No, that would be my job.
Well, according to Hodges, the white fibers on Nick's vest were cotton with traces of ether ...
Yeah.
All right, so, where are we on possible suspects?
Well, that's possible. Because whoever staged the crime scene couldn't have known that Nick was going to respond.
Shut up.
Son of a bitch. He's screwing with us.
I don't think he knows we can see him.
But if they're going to keep him alive for 12 hours, it must mean that he's got an additional air supply.
Judge Stokes, Mrs. Stokes, Gil Grissom.
No, we haven't yet, but ... they should be contacting us in roughly four hours.
You've already done it by coming here, by showing your support ... 
Sam?
Sam, I need to talk to you.
Zip it, sweetheart. Sam ...
One of my guys is in trouble. He's been kidnapped. I need a million dollars in cash. Large bills. And I need it now.
No.
Considering the problems that you've had with the law, you could use some good publicity.
I'm not here as a cop.
I got the money.
Where do you think?
He's a casino owner. A leader of industry. Never convicted of any crime. And right now, I don't care about the integrity of the lab at the moment. I care about Nick.
Well, you're sitting here like Jack Handy with your deep thoughts, staring at a coffee cup. You got a better plan, I'm all ears.
That's my money.
Agreed.
Somebody bag this money, please? Don't get any funny ideas, either.
What I had to do to get this money and for what.
Sorry, Greg. I'll go talk to him.
Hey, Warrick, hey. Hey, how you holding up?
I know.
Hey, Nick is not inside a box because of the flip of a coin.
Hey, you know what? I know you. I don't believe that. Okay?
Greg, get some crowbars.
Yeah, but if he buried him lengthwise, and who's to say he didn't ... he could be.
It's Plexiglas.
Nick?
Nick?
It's a dog.  It's a dog.
This has got to be a prototype. It was probably built to test how long he could keep somebody alive inside.
There's eleven nurseries in the greater Las Vegas area.
He-e-ey! I'm picking up the web cam transmitter.
This is it! I found it! It's here.
I found it! This is it!
Nick! Nick, we're here. Hang on!
Nicky!
We got you, Nicky!
Willows.
We found him. We're getting him out now.
What? What?
You got to be kidding me.
Everyone out of the hole. That box is ready to explode!
Get out of there now!
There are charges under the box!
Bring it over. This way!

Probably used his fists. b*st*rd had to have hit her.
Hello.
Who's calling? Yes. Uh, yes. Speaking.
She's what? Uh - uhm ... 
Uh, Nick, let me catch a lift with you.  There's something going on with Lindsay.
I'm Catherine Willows. What's the trouble?
Thank you, Officer. I appreciate everything you've done. Let's go.
Okay, what or who is on Fremont Street that you would risk your life to get to? Mouthing off to teachers, slipping grades and now hitchhiking. I mean, what is next, Lindsay?
What did you just say?  Okay, no phone, no friends, no nothing.
A month.
Hey, you want to make it two?
Well, what do you expect, Lindsay, since he was always high.
She played soccer?
She told you about her brother?
How old would you say he is, Jimmy?
Well, her face is covered, that means remorse, guilt ... somebody cared.
She's been re-dressed.
Her panties are missing.
Have you been to bed?
Did you sleep?
Me neither. She was the same age as Lindsay. She was trying to hitchhike.
Fremont Street.
She's ... just so angry. She doesn't talk to me.
Well, I don't want to scare her. I don't want my daughter to be this ... frightened, paranoid kid who's always looking over her shoulder.
Daniel Perez was diagnosed with relapsing acute promyelocytic leukemia or APL when he was ten. It's rare, it's nasty, and it usually hits Hispanics.
His sister, Alicia was conceived in vitro to be a genetic match.
But when she was four, they took her blood for a transfusion.
At seven, they took her blood to remove stem cells.
It takes one to one-and-a-half liters of marrow for a successful harvest.
She is being charged and processed and the court will probably grant her bill.
Why?
She's refusing to talk about what happened to your youngest child, Mrs. Perez. 
I think it might be the best place for her.
Why don't we step in here, please? 
And, uh ... where did Alicia fit in, except for what she could give to your son?
I saw her medical records. I looked at her x-rays. I know what that little girl suffered, what you put her through.
You put one child over another.
Uh, I have a daughter.
No. You need to see for yourself why you can't ever hitchhike or go downtown or be careless with your safety. Are you ready?
She was waiting for a bus downtown when she was attacked. She's was 23. She was taller and stronger than you, Lindsay. She fought back and didn't win. Someone's gonna have to tell her family. Her parents are gonna have to see her like this. Do you get it now?
Well, with due respect, Doc, this doesn't concern you.
I honestly don't know!
Catherine Willows, Crime Lab.
Quarantine?
Hi. 
Someone want to fill me in here?
So what are we looking at?
Okay, it's my turn now. Clear the scene.
Sorry I'm late. I was processing the scene. Nothing probative.
Lasers?
That's consistent with the hotel manager's statement. Said the vic had booked into the Safari Suite.
Women who ... don't want their friends to know that they're freshening up will check into the suite while they heal.
So, could complications from this procedure have resulted in her death?
Mees lines; indicative of heavy metal poisoning.
Anything else?
Chugalug.
And when was the last time you saw her, Dr. Malaga?
So you supersized the procedure. You did it all in one sitting?
We'll be getting a court order for Ms. Stern's records.
Heavy metal.
Looks like it began approximately three months ago.
Can tox confirm that arsenic poisoning was the cause of death?
In poisoning cases, the killer's usually a relative.
Next-of-kin is an only child, a son. Who has a vineyard in Pahrump. 
But you didn't think so.
Grandma was a dirty word.
You're about to come into some money.
Let me guess -- she turned you down.
Arsenic is the active ingredient in the vineyard pesticide, but you're ruling it out as the source of the poisoning?
So he's not a killer, he's a polluter.
Not sure if it's hinky or kinky.
Remind me never to shake your hand.
That's always a good idea.
Ah ... just like Julie Stern.
An exact match.
Two women, both fighting the toll of time, die prematurely. Why?
Supplement diary.  Daily youth regimen: Coenzyme q-10--
... grape seed-- 200 mg; deer antler drops; chinese mountain ant extract; tincture of wild reishi. And that's just for breakfast.
Why are you asking me?
Scientifically, there's not a whole lot of evidence.
You gonna ask me if this stuff works, too?
Yeah?
If you believe in me, you will never thirst. Rivers of Living water shall flow from your bellies. John 7:38.
Apparently, some fringe health professionals have used the biblical passage as justification for urine therapy.
I ran an Amazon search, I found fifteen books touting urine's supposed health benefits, including its magical powers to reduce the signs of aging. Listen to this.
Make a muscle, Nicky.
Roll up your sleeve, make a muscle.
Oh. Now, how much time and effort went into this? I'm gonna guess five days a week a the gym, low carb, low fat, slow burn, and for what, Nicky? For what?
No. It's nice, though.
Really? But it's rock hard.
Thanks, David.
Dorian Spray. One spray twice a day under the tongue.
Hey, check out that second ingredient.
According to Vartann, Dr. Malaga bought the spa two years ago and incorporated his practice.
Just tell him we're here.
That's my car payment.
It's Vegas, Nicky. Everybody needs it.
Urine therapy. Nature's elixir ... 
You sold Dorian spray to both Renita Loakes and Julie Stern.
I'm familiar with digitalis.
Did you also take a course in spa management?
Hang on. You consider aging a disease?
But you're not treating the body. You're battling crow's feet.
Acceptance of what?
We need Ms. Sterns' and Ms. Loakes' medical records. And, uh, this time, we've got a court order.
Hey, Travis? These are the vials from our decedents, right?
Well, the red blood cells haven't separated from the serum.
Maybe. I mean, normally, we'd see a yellow band of serum on top of the crimson blood. These vials are solid crimson.
So, the women were thirty years apart in age. They lived on different sides of town. They probably didn't know each other. But they both drank their own urine and were patients of Dr. Malaga's.
Well, last monday, two days before liver spot removal, Ms. Stern had a body wrap and ... hydrogen peroxide therapy.
Question is, is it deadly?
I'll get the blood.
So, hand me the syringe with the three percent concentration.
No effect.
Lysis.
The death was in the decimal.
He injected a lethal batch of hydrogen peroxide into two of his patients.
Well, I am not talking about other people. I'm talking about Julie Stern and Renita Loakes.
They put their trust in you because you're an M.D. Your professional degree made them feel safe.
Is that what you tell yourself? And when you screw up again, what happens?
Oh. I'll be notifying the victims' families. You can count on a civil suit.
Good night.
I know that you got the memo, I'm not sure that you read it. Eckley is being promoted to Assistant Director. They are taking applications for his supervisor spot on days. I want it.
What? You want the day spot for yourself? You're worried about giving me a good A.P. score and breaking up the team? Or maybe you just think that I'm incapable of the position? Not worthy of the promotion? Is that it? 
I'm just always, always, always defending myself to you. 
I'm unbelievable. I have a daughter who is so starved for my attention, she is thumbing rides to Fremont Street to see her grandfather. The last person I want her around. I mean, not that it's much better with my mother, who sees Lindsay much more often than I do.  I am missing out on my daughter's life. I have no life of my own. Would you just stop me and say something here?
That's part of it, but ...
I want the job because I can do it. I'm qualified, I'm motivated and I'm ready, Gil. You know that I am.
Thank you.
What's with the tape?
Cute. 
Anything of interest?
It's a fingernail.
Uh, sorry, Sara. I need the microscope. Priority.
This can't wait.
Both. Go have a cup of coffee on me.
Thank you.
Oil-based blue paint mixed with motor oil ... 
No. We believe that Mathers was the copycat, responsible only for Charlene Roth's death.
And we have reason to believe that he has killed again. Our suspect's M.O. is to apply blue paint to a campus railing ... 
... that he has infused with motor oil to retard the drying process.
He then lays in wait for a female victim to touch the railing.
It's always near a water fountain. He then grabs them from behind as they're washing the paint from their hands.
Our suspect's prior victims were all sexually assaulted. No semen was found. Cause of death: Strangulation.
Given that he has been killing for around twenty years, we approximate his age to be ... 
... at least thirty-five. He may wear glasses. He may drive a Chevy with black interior.
Serials have been known to change their signatures because they have to. Fear of being caught ... interruption ... or it could just be an act of escalation.
I haven't been cleared for comment.
John Mathers killed Charlene Roth and was punished for it.
What's this key used for?
You know that hazing is illegal. You could lose your charter.
Political science major?
Good. Maybe you can explain why the pledge who swallowed this key ended up dead.
So, he's been missing for days, yet you didn't bother to call anyone?
'Cause he was working from a schematic the campus security gave him. The railing's not on it.
This cement is fresh.
Call Brass. 
Two years ago, DNA confirmed a hair found on Debby Reston belonged to the serial's first victim, Janet Kent.
Well, DNA confirmed that the hair found in the doll's mouth belonged to Debby Reston.
Prior evidence indicated that the suspect was an artist or had some connection to the university's art department.
What about behind her?
Some kind of signage?
He was in the front seat, and he was looking at her through the rearview mirror.
The pump was probably for the doll. Beer bottles ... tell Mia to check them for saliva, as well as other bodily fluids.
I'll take the girl.
Prints turn up anything?
Height and weight?
Can you take down her hair?
Pretty boy.
None of the other victims looked alike.
Maybe he was a mistake.
This girl.
We thought he selected his victims at random. He didn't. He chose her. He hunted her ... and trapped her.
When was the last time you saw Kaitlin?
Can you tell me what the two of you did on Monday? All the details.
What class is that?
Cody Lewis?
Janet dated Cody Lewis. Kaitlin took his art class. All right, so, uh, there's not one single thing that all five women have in common.
This the John Mathers interview?
Is there anything in his prison file?
Mathers was the submissive. His partner is the alpha male.
Mia was looking for saliva on the beer bottles from the van and found a vaginal contribution on the neck of one of them.
Question. The partner kills on the eve of Mathers' execution, and again this week, on the second anniversary.  Why the no-show last year?
The most recent victim went to the campus copy union with her roommate on the day she disappeared. Janet Kent's ...
... pocket contents -- a receipt from WLVU Copy Union. On Debby Reston's backseat ...  ... catalogs with comb bindings.
Black plastic trash bags with toner powder.  
Excuse me. Does Kevin Greer use this machine for any of his personal projects?
A paint mixer.
So he mixed his own paint so we couldn't trace the origin of his purchase.
Wait a minute.
There are six here.
We only know of five.
There's a sixth victim. A Brit or Brittany Mosscoe. Her name was on a ziploc bag in Greer's freezer. It contained a lock of hair. Sara's looking into Missing Persons. And Mia's running it through DNA.
Slow down. Okay ... okay. I got it.
The sixth victim is a ruse. He drew her off a calendar. Brit Mosscoe is an anagram for Miss October.
What are you doing?
You don't need a diagram. 
You need a woman. 
I'm looking forward to your speech.
Gil ...
Don't even think about it.
I thought you were going to process the scene with Grissom.
Right ... Ecklie's right hand.
Ever do a case with her?
A napkin is not a speech.
I'm going to need to see everybody who went in or out of the east penthouse since check-in, and that includes stairwells and service entrances.
Yeah, I know. Her father owns the casino.
Dance is still going strong.
I just found Janelle Macklin.
That's going to be tough.
Your daughter looked terrified.
So you think this is all an act? Daddy's little girl begging for attention. 
I take it that's not her usual greeting. If this is a game, why ask for money? She obviously doesn't need it.
When Steve Wynn's daughter was kidnapped, he didn't tell the police. He went to the Mirage Casino Floor, he got 1.4 million in cash, he made the drop ...
Tell me something.
Tough shift.
Well, we know they didn't take the VIP elevator down ...
Even more fingerprints on those buttons. Good luck.
How's it going?
Yeah ... 
I might stick a few of those in my trunk.
These guys definitely knew their way around this hotel.
What's this, Kenny?
Sure you do.
TIVO-ing the casino. Now that's ballsy. You time-shifted the signal from the west penthouse service elevator and you fed it to the east monitor. 
You were in on it.
Where is she?
She's also a person of interest in the death of Nicole Jensen. If you know anything ...
Why are you talking to yourself?
Is it working?
And black wool is definitely not used for party dresses. So it's got to be from those tuxedo boys in the suite.
Not deceptive.
Well, according to the polygraph, yeah.
Let me guess. Mrs. Butterworth?
Well, there he is, stepping onto the main elevator from the 15th floor. Alone.
You crack this kid's head open, all that would come out would be T and A.
Actually, more than once.
2:04 A.M.
So when are you going to be doing your final proficiency?
And since the surveillance feed was still being time-shifted at that point, my guess is that Janelle took the service elevator out.
No actual crime was committed. The kidnapping wasn't real.
She glued it.
Just keep in mind, Gil, that she is on Ecklie's team.
And the tox came back positive for benzodiazepines.
And knock you out at the same time. Girl probably didn't even realize she was suffocating.
All right, so ... based on the time that she called her father and the time we found the car, she was in the trunk at least three hours. That's a slow way to go.
Let me guess: Jensen lawyered up?
Everything matches Janelle Macklin.
The position of the knot was the key. 
Between her wrists and her back, The only way that it could've ended up in that position was if she had tied it herself. And her saliva on the ends of the scarf confirmed it.
I guess I am. Although I don't think that was her intention.
I think that she was ... hoping that her father would save her in time.
Found a camcorder. No tape inside.
Not much traffic. Makes it a lot easier to run someone off the road ...  ... and slash their throat.
Women in convertibles are low-hanging fruit.
Plastic lasts longer.
She was a He?
And what does that mean exactly?
Subtracting what?
Good. Because top or bottom, this looks like a sexual assault that turned into a hate crime.
Ran her prints through AFIS and I got two hits. A Wendy Garner was a dancer at the Tangiers, and Walter Clancy, a blackjack dealer at the Riviera in the mid-'90s.
The coroner noted that she had collagened lips.
Okay, so 86 those cheek implants.
Now, estrogen would've rounded out the face, so square that jaw.
Well, one thing's for certain: Walter didn't kill Wendy.
The gods would be happy in Vegas.
Gil, only civilians confuse strippers and showgirls. You can't cheat the full monty.
Thank you.
Hello, ladies.
I'm Catherine Willows. This is Gil Grissom. We're with the crime lab. Do any of you know if Wendy Garner worked last night?
Unfortunately, she was found dead last night.
So do you know where she got her work done?
Males to females rather than females to males?
I guess she found somebody who would.
Those look like bloody footprints.
Yeah?
Someone outsourced their health care to the wrong provider.
At least ... something was sterile.
Normal people don't torture people in storage bins.
I can only imagine those cramps.
And how long does milady have to wear a wire?
I take it that wasn't supposed to happen.
Or they were taking some bad Mexican bootlegs. Now, that is more than a five o'clock shadow.
So she died before Wendy.
Jacqui got an AFIS hit off the bloody fingerprint from the toothpaste tube found in Vern's v*g1n*.
Came back a Dr. Karl Benway, military service.
So we've got a non-doctor who served in the military who doesn't drive and never leaves the country.
Mm-hmm.
Right.
Well, Vern was a male, and Dr. Lavalle was a male.
Wendy's video tape ... your fingerprint. 
Based on the DNA that we found in Wendy's cheek, you were swapping spit with her, and your wife was swapping something else with her.
So the man admits to murder but not infidelity. 
So you're saying it was transfer?
Right.
I remember this case. The Garbetts owned a restaurant that was next door to the victim's hardware store. Max Larson owned the private alleyway that was behind both places.
Well, he claimed the restaurant's delivery trucks were clogging the alley.
And without access for deliveries, the restaurant business just dried up.
Well, the fingerprint's pink -- so you used ninhydrin?
Well, I know that on some surfaces, ninhydrin can take time to develop a print. It was in, uh, last May's Journal of Forensic Sciences.
Warrick, in your field report, you documented the collection of several hairs near the body, but DNA never analyzed them.
Process the hairs now.
Actually, I kind of made that up. Eddie did have a gig. It ended early and he and I ... well, let's just say that not all my memories of him are bad ones.  Which reminds me you, at the time, were going out with that Assistant Manager of the Flamingo--
Boy, did she have it bad for you. She kept calling while we were working the scene. You had to shut your phone off.
Okay, Nicky, since you have such a good memory, why don't you explain the unidentified prints that you lifted from the murder weapon.
Okay, well, we're going to have to compare that unidentified print with this matchbook print.
I agree. But the prosecution may not see it that way.
Someone other than the suspect touched the matches and the wrench.
Who else had access to that restaurant?
Warrick, I thought you were following it up with DNA.
Thanks.
You told Ecklie?
Oh, we all are.
All of whom would've had access to the kitchen and to the wrench.
And what about the other four?
Hi.
I want to see if I can bring out the image on the matchbook.
That's why I'm doing it now. How was the door-to-door?
Hey. 
The inquiry into Grissom. 
Your responsibility is to confirm that all conclusions drawn are supported by the data. They are.
I worked on this case. The conclusions, they are supported. I assume that's what you're finding?
Right.
I'll bring out the illuminants and contrast.
Club PCH.
Is that probative?
Understood.
You know I was.
Gil doesn't micro-manage. We know what needs to be done. I photo-documented the scene, I collected blood evidence, and I brought the charred newspaper to trace.
Are you asking if he performed a supervisory review?
He must have. I'm sure he did.
Are you doing all this for the sake of the lab or to indict Grissom?
About my request -- I really would like to supervise days.
No, this promotion isn't about money.
We're done here, right?
Vacuum metal deposition.
Comparing unknown matchbook print to garbage bag print.
Match.
while your parents were in court, suing to have that dumpster removed, you were running the restaurant. In fact, you signed the vendor checks that week.
You can play it that way. It's fine with us. You and your father can both stand trial. I mean, after all he was the one who had motive. He threatened Larson. His prints were on the wrench.
As far as we know, they could've been in it together. It's easier to overpower a guy when it's two against one.
Warrick, why don't you and I take the perimeter and work our way in.
Yeah?
So you get the team back together only to break us apart again. What kind of a perverse game are you playing here, Gil?
Yeah, I'll cover it. I'm taking Warrick.
A shopping bag for a shirt, rubber boots and a g-string. Homeless stripper?
Why is there a ring on your ring finger?
What?
How long have you been married?
About as long as Warrick's been married.
You poor guys.
Yeah, that. Yeah, that kind of threw me for a loop. Tina, right?
She must be a very special woman. I look forward to meeting her.
The vic's blood-alcohol level was .16 and COD was blunt-force trauma.
Mm-hmm.
No work card; no record. But the rubber boots were standard issue: Streets and Sanitation.
Yeah, there's three S&amp;S workers with those initials and ... 
... it looks like an Eddie Vonner was on duty last night.
Where?
When I see them, they're usually dead.
She died a few blocks from where you dropped her off.
Depending on what else they ride.
It's a pretty sweet deal for the guys. Hot chicks getting trashed with no security and nowhere to go. 
And what happens when the girls want to get off?
Brooke Harris was getting calls from a gym?
And what's the word on the husband?
The husband.
Well, workout is one thing. What is a housewife from Centennial Park doing on a stripper bus with pros?
And you let her.
You were teaching her a lesson.
And drunk CEOs aren't wolves? They're worse. You know that. That's why you kept calling her. So you could hear all about it, right?
Um ... the champagne ride picks up strippers near the clubs, but not actually at the clubs.
Well, look, Brooke Harris wasn't planning to die that night. She had to have parked her car somewhere.
So, if she parked her car here ... why did she go here?
Yes?
Sure.
Live for the day.
You know that I'm happy for you.
Yeah.
Warrick ... you know, the thing that makes a fantasy great is the possibility that it might come true. And when you lose that possibility ... it just kind of sucks.
Brooke Harris probably spent ten bucks a day on nonfat lattes.
She needed money to get her car back.
Where'd you find that?
May I ask you a question?
Do you recognize this woman?
Hey, Michaels. Think you might be able to take this man into custody?
I got to beg off, you guys. Got to take Lindsay to school.
Bye.
Mrs. Matthews inside?
Well, I'll get a DNA exemplar for Jesse and let her get some sleep.
Mrs. Matthews? 
Mrs. Matthews? 
I'm Catherine Willows from the Crime Lab.
It's okay.
I understand. 
This photo ... is it recent?
If it's all right with you, I'd like to borrow it. I'll get it to Nevada Child Search, and they can get it out to the media.
Thank you.
I have a daughter. Thirteen.
Thirty-six and a half inches. I'll add it to the physical description. And, Mrs. Matthews, our K-9 unit will need something with Jesse's scent.
That'll work. And I will need something with his DNA: A toothbrush, hairbrush, pillowcase ...
Well, if we locate anything that could lead us to him, we want to make sure we've got the right boy.
Hi. 
Oh ... okay. Yeah, I'll let her know. 
Mm-hmm.
Who takes care of the hamsters?
Mrs. Matthews, has Jesse ever run away from home?
Was he upset about anything?
Of course. I'd feel the same. 
Mrs. Matthews, when the officer brought your car back, I noticed that there were gifts in the garage that were from your husband's parents.
I'm still going to need some contact information.
He's in with a social worker. He's okay. 
Jim?
He's got the same scar over his eye as in Karen's photos.
King Solomon didn't have a DNA lab.
Hey, is it all right if he goes with CSI Brown for a little while? It won't be long.
Thank you.
Adam?
Well, once our lab confirms DNA, he can go home with his mother.
Mrs. Esposito ... did you adopt Adam?
Did you have twins?
I need your help to tie up a few loose ends.
Let's start with a sample of your DNA.
We have to follow procedure for everyone's protection. In fact, Jesse can't even be released without a positive match.
I'll make it a rush, I promise. 
Open your mouth, please.
It's the same kid. It's a doppelganger, with an identical scar.
I know there's cases in which the kidnappers threatened their victims, Tell them that I'm your mother or I'll kill your real mom.
I don't think that Mrs. Esposito's lying either. Karen Matthews had a house full of photos of him.
There's something off about this picture.
Do you recognize anything in the picture?
Was Karen Matthews there?
Mr. Esposito ... several witnesses saw a man matching your description at Mesa Valley Park ...  ... when Jesse disappeared.
Were you there the day before yesterday?
Hey, I got the DNA results. The boy is Adam Esposito. Victor and Valerie are his parents.
Uh, not quite. She's got 13 alleles in common with the male DNA that we got from the toothbrush exemplar.
I was inside the house. Believe me, a kid does live there.
These are all in chronological order. Archie confirmed that all the photos taken along the top row were genuine. Up until the photo taken at the funeral in which he was two.
Yeah.
They haven't seen him since the funeral.
Well, he was home-schooled. And we're looking into a doctor and a sitter.
For four years she's created an elaborate fantasy -- which collided with reality at Mesa Valley Park.
When she couldn't find him, she called the police. 
Karen, tell me what happened four years ago after your husband was killed.
Did Jesse get sick? Was there an accident?
Karen? Did something happen to Jesse? Is Jesse dead?
I found this in Karen's medicine chest. Olanzapine.
Yeah. But the prescription is over four years old. I'll have Brass subpoena her medical records.
It's hard for anyone to let go of someone they love.
How old were you when he died?
Little guy.  I'll get started in Karen's room.
Just too long ago to get any DNA. But Hodges also found traces of olanzapine.
Karen is already mentally fragile when her husband is killed. She gets into a very heated argument with the in-laws at his funeral, goes over the deep end, poisons Jesse and buries him in the backyard near the fence.
The neighbor claims that Karen killed his dog. If the dog detected decomp and dug near the grave, ... 
Karen may have moved the body to protect him.
Nick found a patch of tissue and hair in trunk of Karen's car. The DNA matches the toothbrush. 
His father was a soldier, his grandfather was a soldier, ... 
... Karen did not want that for Jesse.
Hey, Dave, James.
Hey, Dave, you've got to pick it up.
Yeah.
So, Brass gave us a quick briefing. How can we help?
So that leaves the perimeter.
Broken window.
Yeah. It slides. The front door was locked. The killer probably broke the window and exited out the front.
Doesn't look big enough to have done the job.
Well, that ain't no anthill. That dirt's fresh. Looks like something's buried there. 
Hang on.
Bobby.
GRCs aren't even close.
How do you kill a werewolf?
I hear the vic has a sister.
I'm assuming you contacted Allison.
She's dead.
Well, other than hair, when you and Warrick processed the house, did you find any evidence of a sister?
We are now.
Thanks, guys.
Allison?
Allison ...  I need to talk with you. Can you please come out?
Allison, my name is Catherine Willows. I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab. I know that you suffer from hypertrichosis. I understand why you would rather not talk with me. But we need to discuss your brother's murder. Would you please come out?
May I ... ?
Would you step out? Please? 
No, I ... no. I don't want you to have to hide from me. Allison ... I'm a scientist. Excess body hair does not evoke fear ... or morbid fascination. It's simply a genetic quirk, like ... blue eyes or flat feet. 
It's nice to meet you, Allison.
What can you tell me about your brother's murder?
Why did you wait twelve hours to call the police?
Do you have any idea why someone would want to hurt your brother?
What about your parents?
No one else knows that you exist?
Help you-- with what?
Michelle, your relationship with Hayden, was it serious?
Michelle, I understand that you were at your folks and you were trying to get a hold of Hayden on your cell, but we were unable to reach you on it. Can you explain?
Do you have any idea who could have done this? 
What's up with the 911?
So it was on his side where the blood settled.
So, uh, somebody moved him several hours postmortem.
Well, there was blue carpet in the sister's room.
I'll get back to you on that one.
Allison, it's Catherine. I need you to step out.
There's another woman with me.
I need to get inside your room.
Thank you.
You can't expect us to believe that you live in a secret room that only you go into, yet you can't explain why your bed is covering up blood.
Did you kill him?
Did you?
Because he was going to leave you ... for Michelle. That had to have been scary for you.
Allison ... if you didn't kill him, who did?
Okay, okay. I know that you're scared ... but you have got to tell us what happened.
And when he was shot, what did you do?
Was the television on?
So you had a pretty good view of the living room through the reflection in the tube. What did you see?
You're sure that it was Brent?
Okay, um ... let's just go back to the gun.
Yes, we found it.
Well, we can try to build a case without you.
Well, just hear me out. We have a rock with Brent Moyer's fingerprints on it.
Well, let's just leave Allison's testimony out of it. We simply inform the judge that our suspect's fingerprints were on a rock that may have been used to break a window at the murder scene.
Oh, no, I don't have any qualms. It's just that my moral compass doesn't always point in the same direction as yours.
I'd take it under advisement. Why, is that what you're recommending?
Way too many.
Our Trace Lab analyzed the silver found in the bullet mold. It's identical composition to the bullet in the victim. DA says it's a slam dunk.
And the silver bullet?
So you left your parents', you went back to your place to make the bullet and then you went over to Hayden's.
So it was premeditated. I guess you can forget heat of the moment as a mitigating factor here.
Allison ... what are you going to do now?
And you're set with money?
Allison, I have every confidence that you're going to be just fine here, but ... 
If you ever need anything, would you please give me a call?
Catherine.
I'm not sure I follow.
So you were the one that contacted peopledetectors.
Hit and run?
Did you run the plates?
Cell phone, a shoe and a briefcase. Probably lost them all on impact.
Most cars have to be going at least 14 miles an hour to trigger the airbag.
Well, I can't be sure, but it looks like somebody popped the ignition.
Carjacking gone bad? Vic gets off the elevator, walks to her spot ...
...on the phone, distracted, catches the guy stealing her ride ...
He runs her over and splits.
No prints?
Hey, Arch. You get anything off the parking garage camera?
Killer was camera shy.
This wasn't a carjacking gone bad. It was premeditated.
Keep working the video, Arch. See if you can get us a face.
Well, join the club. No usable prints on the parking garage camera either.
Yeah. From her office. Lots of international calls. 
Mm-hmm.
Cayman Islands. Popular with scuba divers and money launderers. I called a few of the numbers; all banks.
It's also a good way to siphon money away from your clients.
Hey, somebody wanted this woman dead.
Oh, hey, Nick. Nick.
We caught a break. 
No. Archie isolated a frame of the killer turning the focus ring.
Presidents, movie stars ... a drug-dealing waiter isn't the kind of guy usually associated with Lois O'Neill. On the other hand ...  Tony Constantine.
The Copa girls from the Sands.  That's Lois O'Neill.
Happy birthday to my beautiful doll! Love always, Tony?
Dead, like Jimmy Hoffa. The only guys who know aren't telling.
Found this handkerchief hanging off the balcony. I'll get it to Hodges.
Well, I should say hi to dear old Dad.
Hi, Sam.
Sam, when you left this room tonight, where did you go? Upstairs? 
Mm. Maybe Mom fell for the wrong gangster.
You always were a sucker for a hot dancer, weren't you, Sam?
Must be serious. That's the first time you haven't asked me how Mom's doing. She's fine, by the way.
Oh, so it was positive for gun oil.
130, 131, 132 ... got to admit, this is some kind of closet.
Oh, let's see. It's 1-60 ... 1 ... 
Oh. 161 -- hanger's empty.
It's possible she sent them to the cleaners to get rid of blood and GSR. We can get a warrant.
Oh. How apropos that she's named names.
A canary diamond.
Mom? What are you doing? Where's Lindsey?
Drai's ... The girls like to spend.
Where did you get that hanky?
A friend who was at Lois' party?
You can't be seeing Sam?
Oh, for one thing, he's a player.
Oh. I can't believe this.
Put it in the envelope.
Because we haven't cleared Sam as a suspect.
Oh, this has been going on for weeks, huh?
You lied about being in Lois O'Neill's bedroom.
Your handkerchief puts you there when the waiter was shot.
So quit giving them away.
You know, Sam, this is the second time that I thought that you might be a killer.
The thing is, I don't. It never occurred to me for a minute that this is something that you wouldn't have done. And that wouldn't bother me, except you're dating my mother.
Making up for stabbing one girl by being kind to another. Hmm.
What? What would you do, Sam?
You know, I think I've been called out to this place before.
So he's been dead for at least twenty hours.
.380s make a lot of noise. It's odd that no one heard anything, even in a dump like this. Walther PPK. Two shots in the body, one to the head.
Looks like the killer used Armorall. The gun is clean.
Apparently not enough.
The coroner's bullets matched the Walther, but Bobby found an additional striated mark on the o-jive, so he went back to the gun. There was threading inside the muzzle.
Oh. Also explains why no one heard anything. But leave the gun, take the silencer?
If the silencer was homemade, we might have been able to match the killer's tool marks. Assuming we ever find this guy.
Well, he was a somebody to the killer.
I'm guessing that Clayton Nash had a record.
I get the drift.
What is this, summer camp?
All of them?
Well, that certainly explains why someone would want to kill him.
Who isn't?
Two murders, same killer.
It's a good plan, well executed.
We know his original target, Clayton Nash. Small-time hood who gave up a lot of his big-time cronies. He's got a list of enemies.
Seven. Three of them are still in prison. One is dead, one is out on parole, and two served their time and are now out.
It's not enough detail to run through AFIS?
Karl Cooper. At age 19, he was an Army Ranger. By 42, he was one of the most successful bank robbers in U.S. History. He pulled off dozens of heists, going back two decades, all without killing a single person, and he was known to his bank-robbing buddies as Red.
Well, he got the nickname because he was always in debt ... in the red.
Last known was the U.S. Federal Penitentiary in Marion, Illinois. When Nash gave him up, Cooper plead guilty. He served the full seven years' term. He got out, dropped off the face of the earth.
Well, Karl Cooper had a girlfriend back in Ohio, a Janice Hanford. I mean, she could be Cooper now.
How did she get from Harvard to here?
Lady Heather told me. She was very proud of her.
Well, it looks as though she hasn't checked her mail in ten weeks. The postmark dates back to November 12th.
Betz Clinic?
Including the employees?
We'll need to see those testing rooms.
How do you monitor your patients?
What is your screening process?
No, I wouldn't.
Here's Zoe Kessler at the start of her session. 
And here she is at hour number four.
Except ... check it out.
Look at the bottom right hand corner.
See that shadow? Somebody opened the door.
Here's Jack Landers. 
Except he never returned. Wolfowitz works at the clinic. He has access to both victims. One victim was found less than mile from his house, which smells like human decomp.
How do we get to him?
Gil, I saw him. Yesterday. He wasn't frozen. I mean, maybe he knew too much, and someone at Betz sensed that we were getting to close and ... 
Well, I know what I saw.
I'm on it.
So, none of the fingerprints from the car belong to Jacob Wolfowitz. They're all a match to a Leon Sneller.
That's John Sneller.
Which explains how I saw and how Lady Heather ... did a dead guy. 
I thought that she killed him, too. I would've. I mean, I wouldn't have slept with him first, but ...
Which makes you wonder who's on the autopsy table. Sneller joined the army in 1985. He was stationed at a field hospital near Berlin until about a year ago.
At which point, I think that he came to Vegas, ... 
... put his brother on ice, started impersonating him.
I mean, I know this theory's a little out there, but given the evidence ... it's the only conclusion that makes any sense.
Given twins ... go with twins.
Love what he's done with the place.
I found a blue pill in the car. Tox came back, didn't match any known pharmaceutical.
Shabbat shalom.
I think this is a gynecological device from a hundred years ago.
Zoe Kessler would've made the perfect uber-woman except for her one brown eye.
Hey, check out the face of the clock.
Sir ... 
Massive blood loss was the cause of death.
Well, the other twin didn't make it.
That explains Judaica. I guess Jacob went nurture and Leon went nature.
Yeah.
Of course I do, yeah. Missing person, we never found her.
Ugh, yeah, what a creep.
Mr. Sidley, her father says that she was headed over here the day before yesterday, and he hasn't heard from her since. 
Warrick and I were looking for a missing person about a year ago, and we tried to get a warrant to search this residence. The owner denied us access.
Well, believe it or not, exceptions are made for photographs with serious artistic or scientific merit.
I don't make the rules. So found a large, diffuse pool of fluorescence here on the wood floor. It's consistent with bleach or some other cleaning compound.
Mm.
Yeah. It was negative for blood.
What are you doing?
How many times is a couple of times?
Were they dates?
Was she ever in your house?
How very responsible of you. And you had that conversation how many days before she went missing?
We found an old blood pool in your living room. You want to tell me about that?
We were just working the scene.
This piece of wood was pried from your living room. The surface was scrubbed with a cleaning agent, but we found a spot of blood ... right there.
This house was processed in accordance with CSI protocol, but do what you have to do.
Your client has a bit of a temper.
Sit down. Please. 
Gentlemen, this is Nick Stokes. He's a colleague of mine. We found identification on the decedent in the chimney.
Oh, it's just posturing. There's no way that our search violated his rights.
Good.
Well, hopefully, we have to.
We're trying to get a DNA sample from Caroline's personal effects and compare it to a blood drop that was on the living room steps.
Absolutely. 
Yeah.
Thank you.
This is Tad Sidley's dorm room, right?
And why didn't you report him missing?
He was murdered. May we come in?
Were you and Tad good friends?
Why not?
Any idea who killed him?
Caroline's dad.  What do you know about this?
That's not my decision to be made. Unfortunately, the DA feels that we need more.
Oh, yes, absolutely.
Mr. Fitzgibbons, we found your name and number written on a post-it in Tad Sidley's dorm room. Can you explain how it got there?
Now wait a minute. We only found a single drop of blood. No doubt Sidley's attorney will argue that Caroline may have cut herself. He already admitted that she was in his house.
Yeah, and you don't get a murder conviction off of a single drop of a victim's blood.
That would certainly help.
Hey. Thanks for your help.
Thank you.
When we showed up at the scene a year ago, Sidley wouldn't let us into his house. I'm guessing because the body was still inside.
Kind of like Telltale Heart.
Guy commits a murder and buries the body under the floorboards of his house.
All right ... the attic is above the living room. They both share the same chimney.
The east wall of the house is 17 feet from the chimney in the living room. But that same east wall is only 14 feet from the chimney in the attic. When you retrieved the body, did you excavate the entire chimney?
There's no question that somebody extended the brick exterior of this chimney. There's a slight color disparity between the old and the new bricks.
Which means that her heart was probably still beating.
Defensive marks?
We found a potential blood pool in the living room and another much more substantial one in the attic -- is that consistent with your findings?
Probably stabbed in the living room and then moved to the attic where she continued to bleed until she died.
What's going on?
Does his father know?
Well, I'm on my way to the PD to meet up with him and his lawyer --
Yes, I will get to that. But first I wanted to let both of you know that Caroline's body was recovered in Mr. Sidley's attic.
The coroner confirmed that she was raped, stabbed and bled to death.
I searched the chimney, specifically, in accordance with the original warrant and subsequent limitation. 
You live alone, Mr. Sidley ... and you have no idea how her body got bricked into your attic? Oh, come on. What happened? Did she say no one too many times?
If you didn't kill her, Mr. Sidley, then tell me, is there anyone else who had access to your house? Who else could have raped Caroline under your roof?
This is Catherine.
I'm on my way.
Hi.
Right.
But the son wouldn't cooperate.
Well, it's a logical theory, but to kill someone and stuff him in a chimney in hopes of getting information on your missing daughter ...
Polyethylene plastic?
You just admitted to murder; I think you know the answer.
And the body in the chimney?
And Tad Sidley's ID? Did you place the gym card on the body?
Yes.
You wanted Martin Sidley to know what it's like to lose a child.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry that we couldn't find your daughter without your help.
Sexual assault?
Thank you.
Vic probably thought it was good for her, too.
We got that memo. They're 'Hard Crime.'
Right.
You see, it's good PR for the department. Try not to bust their chops, okay?
Either that or he talked his way in.
Candles burned down. A bouquet in the trash.
Flowers and candles -- sure seems like a date.
Got a void in the wax.
I think it's nail polish.
So the assailant could be any one of them ...  ... assuming that our guy didn't take the stairs which, of course, aren't monitored.
He brought flowers. How romantic.
So he could've been with the victim the whole night.
Pull the best image of his face you can, and get a printout to Brass.
Good question.
Cuticles? 
Nail polish, diamond particles ... maybe she was giving herself a mani and pedi before the assault.
Yeah, I hear you there. Thank you.
Wendy ran the semen, no hits in CODIS.
SAE found oral, vaginal and a**l smears positive for semen. Degraded and intact sperm suggests multiple deposits.
Yeah, well, tox came back -- lorazepam in the vic's blood.
No, nor did I. Lorazepam is a hypnotic sedative, and I know in high doses, it causes acute amnesia. Maybe that's what he was counting on to cover his tracks.
Low-profile entry, sedatives, duct tape -- I mean, if he's not a serial, he will be soon.
Well, he certainly looks the part.
The time code says 6:36 P.M. But the alarm went out at 6:58. That's 22 minutes later.
We live in a desert, Gil. You want to see a woman's bare feet, all you have to do is look down.
What? You got to narrow that down.
Okay. Our rapist is a foot fetishist. That's what gets him off. He has to see his victim's feet somewhere. If we can figure out where, maybe we can find him.
Christina Hollis. African American. Single. Lives and works at the Omni. She lives on the 11th floor, so there's no real way for a peeper to see in. And she uses the gym, but not the pool.
Well, she does have nice feet. And the nail polish looks like a similar shade to Christina Hollis'.
He waits a couple more weeks, he does it again, but this time he goes all the way.
Well, we may have be wrong about that.
Very. We're trying to understand what you have in common with the other victims that might lead us to him.
Where do you buy your shoes?
Pool?
I notice that you do yoga.
Where?
Anybody in those apartments has a clear view of her bare feet.
The tenant's name was on the nitrous oxide list.
No, no, no, you're not going in there, no.
Okay, thanks.
Yoga flyers from all over town.
Guy's got everything he needs for a pedicure.
Candle wax on the camera.
Oh, yeah, these are old pictures. She's a teenager now.
Are you kidding? I keep a vial of her blood in my freezer.
Well ... one thing you learn doing this job is that bad things happen to people who never expect it ... every day.
Multiple fragments of metal penetrating skin and dermis as deep as the superficial musculature of the back and neck. The showerhead explosion didn't kill her.
What happened to the shower curtain?
How old is she?
Marlon West.
Got the DNA results on the blood from Hannah's sweater.
Hannah.
Maybe, maybe not. The soil on the shirt was consistent with the dumpsite. Hannah could've been at the scene.
She could have cut herself burying the body.
And counted on us to make the match? Well, that's just plain scary smart. I mean, my daughter's a few years older than her, and the most important thing on her mind right now is how much belly button to show off at the mall.
Never thought I'd be grateful for that.
Ah, the shower curtain the vic was wrapped in.
Okay. But Hannah uses those showers after gym class.
Probably hiding her body. She's twelve. She hasn't reached puberty. Undeveloped teen girls are very self-conscious.
Could be from Hannah dragging Stacy's body.
Plastic slides on grass. It makes it easier. It's certainly possible.
Well, it's got adjustable seats, tilt and telescoping steering wheel -- It's certainly possible.
I'd say the killer moved the seat.
Hey, Gil, if you're swamped, I can always cancel my vacation plans.
Good, 'cause I really wasn't that serious. What are you working on?
Oh, the Wallace case. Yeah, I wanted on this way back when. But I was the new kid, and my supervisor wouldn't let me do it. I probably would have solved it, too. Is there a new lead? 
I heard Jameson dug thirty holes in the desert looking for her body?
That's dedication.  Or obsession. You know, my sister lived near the Wallaces out in Henderson. Their fights were legendary. I was at a barbecue one time, I heard them screaming at each other from three blocks away. Made me and Eddie seem like amateurs. 
Disneyland. With the parents.
Oh, yeah. And Sam wanted to take us on the Tangiers jet but my mother refused. Said it wasn't the tradition. So now we're driving. Yeah, that'll be a hell of a road trip.
Will do.
This is Catherine.
I'm busy. Checking up on me?
You tell me.
Fair warning for what? 
So, somebody killed them both. And if it's about money, doesn't look like this guy has much. 
Suggests semi-automatic, but I don't see any shell casings here.
Killer could have picked them up.
Could be transfer from that railing. There's some paint flaked off of that railing.
Gil. This looks fresh.
Thanks, Jim.
Double *** buck. Standard shot is nine pellets.
So you're saying that a single shotgun blast, through a security door, took out two separate victims in two separate locations?
Shots were centered on his chest, about there.
Vertical deflection down to the cab is roughly 60 degrees. Standard shot won't spread that far.
The cab driver was collateral damage.
Okay, but the man with the shotgun said he shot a burglar. What's here to steal?
What other Laotians are having a bad night?
Vipraxay? Well, that's a hell of a coincidence.
Yeah, he's got the same last name as the guy who shot him. In fact, Grissom said that our vic over there caught a cab at a gas station near Mount Charleston. I'll have Auto Detail bring in his car.
Unless you got any more in your drawers?
Hi.
Well, if you have to ask, it's just friends.
Are you the only guest?
It's from a compact disc? Well, how did it end up in Samay Thao's eye?
Noy Vipraxay's car.
Find anything?
The car was found at the bottom of a steep incline.
So he was leaning over it when he bled out.
So someone moved the body?
Hang on. 
Trace came back on the splinter that was in Samay's eye. It was a CD fragment. Samay was in this car.
I don't buy it. Keo shot him from the other side of a locked door. He was waiting to blow the guy away.
Life's getting cheaper. Who's the beneficiary?
I got the serial number rundown from Keo's shotgun. He bought it last week, two days before he shot Samay.
There's a word for that. Premeditation.
Where's Jeremiah's room?
Mr. Calvin? Whose room is next to Jeremiah's?
Did Morris ever drive the car?
Where is he?
Morris? 
Morris?
Control, this is CSI Willows. We need an ambulance.
Hey, Morris, somebody's coming.
Tetanus.
No wonder he wouldn't talk -- he couldn't.
Well, he doesn't have lock-wrist. You got a pen?
We matched your blood to the staple gun; it puts you at Convention Center Drive and you go down for three murders. 
You have anything to tell us, now's the time.
And Morris Calvin was there. DNA confirmed that it was his blood on the staple gun.
Vega ran the vics past the guys in the gang unit. Nobody recognized them.
So aside from the accident, Mrs. Lincoln, how was the show?
And compare it to what? We've got no crime scene photos.
Has it been to prints?
Yeah. Nick's truck has no street value. The value was what was inside.
Anyone interested in the wedding DVD?
Courtesy of Frank Rosetti, owner of Cupid's Kiss.
All right, where do you want to start?
Justifiable homicide?
So you took the perimeter of the scene, right?
Well, I saw this guy in the shadows. Archie blew it up. He looks more like a suspect than a guest.
That face look familiar?
Wow, I thought my wedding was bad. Where is he?
Sara? 
Sara?
No. They're still held up with that officer-involved shooting, but the bomb squad has cleared the convertible.
And what did Diane have to drink?
Oh, my.
When was the last time she was on camera?
Would you play that again?
Yeah, Jim. Check into a Mikey Shoemaker, the bride's brother. Run his wants and warrants. And also look into the location of his tow yard. Thank you.
Where did you find Nick's truck?
Well, I watched the rest of the wedding video. He may have stolen the car, but once Diane disappears, Mikey never leaves the party.
Hey, look. They fixed it.
Oh, it's a little funny.
Oh, Romeo, I don't think that you have time for romance. You're being charged with grand theft auto, obstruction of justice and conspiracy to murder.
Well, if you didn't commit the murder, why did you steal the car?
Which bridesmaid?
So you committed grand theft auto to get laid?
TOD?
Looks like he went down fighting.
Nice clothes.
Yeah, and on his shirt. So what's a guy dressed for a party with a key to this hotel doing out here?
Got smudges that look like white paint up here. Similar to the trace on the vic's clothes.
I don't see any wet paint signs up here either.
He check in with anybody?
Oh, yeah.
He got lucky, all right. He got lucky with a blonde.
Either that or he just bought them and paid a fortune.
Yeah, well, if that ever ends you can kiss Vegas good-bye.
Jackpot.
Ooh, Sasan. Cost him more than all of his other clothes put together.
There's some kind of blue powder trace on the pocket. Nicky, take this.
Except he was driving a Toyota.
The blunt-force trauma to the neck?
Any idea of the source of the BFT?
Yeah, that could be anything. How about prelim tox results?
Stimulant, erection and a painkiller. Party in a pill.
Blue baby powder?
Birefringent crystals. Pretty. What are they?
And that would be?
Stop trying to make that sound dirty. Our vic had a callus on his hand.
Don't. Which means that he was probably playing a lot of pool.
Well, it's closer to Palermo; it's a good place to start.
-- but it is illegal for the house to take a cut a gaming license. I don't see one on the wall. 
You know where we can find this Heidi?
Hey.
Jeff Powell went a little crazy with his corporate card and rented the Ferrari himself?
What kind of business is it?
Well, nothing's entirely unlisted these days.
Caprice Unlimited.
Caprice Unlimited. Anything is possible.  Sounds like a s*x business.
Uh, something other than, a guy is dead, and it looks like you're involved.
Not taking calls.
And Heidi takes the Ferrari. Finds Jeff at the Palermo bar.
Which she then accidentally spills on his clothes.
Insists on buying him a new outfit, one that he couldn't afford on his own.
As was the partying in his hotel room. And the s*x.
Which can make a guy do some pretty stupid things. So anytime more than $10,000 hits the table, the casino's required to ID the player. 
Yep.
He's dead.
Did you guys see where he went?
Well, we're gonna need to take those shoes.  White paint.
The bodyguards dragged Jeff through the service corridor. 
Between the drugs and the confidence, he must've put up quite a fight.
Most likely, he was still alive when they left. They probably thought they just had taught him a lesson.
I'm thinking ear-shredding rock, a beautiful model, boatloads of sushi and ... latex?
Okay.
Nice rocks.
Yeah, there was a jewelry store right across from the service corridor entrance.
Now that is a fantasy.
Tour historic Las Vegas.
It's probably just a drive past the Flamingo where Bugsy Siegel took his leak.
Closed? Now wait a minute. It should be open.
Oh.
Hello?
Anybody here?
Hello?
Control, this is CSI Willows. 
We have a four-nineteen at 4172 Hamilton. 
A business: Neon City Excursions. Suspect may still be on the premises.
It's all right, sir. We're not going to hurt you; we're the police.
Cowboy Dan gets it first.
The shooter finds his next target.
... shoots him in the back.
Well, at least his day started out on a good note.
So what do you got, five nine-mil shell casings?
So they're all accounted for.
So Willie Cutler must have been standing along this line when he was grazed by the bullet.
It's consistent with his statement.
And if the shooter never saw him, he got under the desk really quickly.
So what do you think, Greg? Is Willie Cutler the luckiest guy in the world or the unluckiest?
So the pit boss gives Willie the heave-ho, with chips still on the table.
And what about Sammy?
Just stay here and shut up. I'll be back to take your prints, assuming they're not already in the system.
Which of the seven deadly sins are not represented here?
Or somebody threw it for him. Pillow or a hand on the face certainly could've done the trick.
You know what they say, it's not a real party till somebody breaks something.
I got blood.
Bullet holes.  Somebody shot out the mirror.
Let's get busy, boys.
You joking?
Maybe he suffocated during oral s*x.
Guess we're done with the appetizers.
Well, at least he went out in style, hmm?
... means he died with a smile on his face.
Remember that trick roll that you pled out last year?
Your DNA in our database says that you do. 
Funny, you don't look dead.
So, how did it go so bad?
No off switch?
Well, that's a great story, but it doesn't sound like it was worth the ten g's that we found in your purse.
Don't take it personally, but you are not a $10,000-a-night girl.
Excuse me.  Hi, Lindsey. I know, I told you that I might be a little while. No, I said that we could try and see a movie. Hey, you know what? I've got a friend here who is fighting for his life. I would appreciate a little understanding. I will talk about this with you later. Good-bye.
Fourteen. Supposedly.
It feels pretty small to me right now, too.
Was he injured?
Wouldn't you?
Tequila will always remind me of Señor Frog's.
Cancun. My honeymoon. My dime.
Is that a proposal?
I'm assuming those boot prints aren't yours.
Yeah, when you fall down the stairs, your head tends to go in one direction, your body in another.
What are you thinking?
Edges of the blood pools were already dry. The pools themselves were tacky.
Good question.
Hey, Grissom, spatter on the wall doesn't exceed 18 inches.
Yeah, she would've instinctively reached out for leverage.
Well, it's inconsistent if she fell down the stairs. Maybe she fell up.
Sometimes first blush gives you a head rush.
And what about this here, on the counter?
Lucky for us.
You want fries with that?
Well, it looks like two millimeters--same as the blood at the scene. So, maybe it was just an accident.
So we've got two theories, supported by physical evidence.
Well, I know that there was no blood found in the car, so it's unlikely that Ray took a drive to dispose of the weapon.
Well, if she wasn't cremated, it's not too late for a postmortem examination.
Well, what do you think the chances are we're going to give you an answer before all the evidence is in?
Without wisdoms? 28.
I guess Ray found himself another set of pearly whites.
And you were okay with that?
I'm still confused about the bite marks.
You found yourself a vampire?
Uh-huh. And, uh, what is her name?
And your wife never suspected anything?
But you never told your wife?
When, exactly, was the last time that you had sexual intercourse with your late wife?
Uh, wow, you know, uh, a joke like that doesn't quite seem appropriate for a distraught husband.
Mr. Lester, did you know that your wife was having an affair? The day that she died, she had had intercourse.
For now.
What's in the bag?
And you wanted to see if her lover's prints were on that bottle.
Lovers and co-workers. That never works.
By some more than others.
We're listening.
And Ray is the beneficiary.
Oh, um, am I interrupting?
Brass just called with a heads up. Since when does the DA's office tell us when we're ready?
Sara and I may have uncovered motive. In the last two weeks, Ray filled out five loan applications--200 g's a pop. All denied. With his wife dead, he is the beneficiary of a $250,000 policy.
P.O. Box was through a private company, paid for in cash with a pseudonym: Abe Lincoln. Ninhydrin picked up six distinct prints. Five were matched to Ray.
Becky Lester.
What if Ray's telling the truth?
Unless she touched the letter before it was sent, which would make her the sender.
Becky thought that Ray was squirreling away money. Maybe this is her way of getting her hands on it.
She blackmailed her own husband, knowing that he would pay up, so she wouldn't find out his secret.
Well, if Becky's saliva's on that envelope, it's indisputable.
If Becky wrote the note, she wrote it at work.  This is Catherine. Oh, yeah. I'm on my way.
Sorry, I got held up.
I'd be happy to. Ray and Becky Lester were unhappily married. She was having an affair with her boss; he was indulging his biting fetish. They were having financial problems. But Becky believed that Ray was hiding money. Two weeks ago, Ray received a blackmail note demanding 200 grand or the wife finds out about bite girl. Well, we have just confirmed that the blackmailer and the wife are one and the same.
The envelope of the ransom note. DNA was a match.
Never underestimate the deviousness of a malcontented spouse.
Well, I have the phone records here, so ... uh, the call lasted ... two minutes?
Yeah, I'm just seeing this for the first time here. Um ... the incoming call did not come from the grandfather's house.
I'm gonna call this number.
Susan called her stepmother from inside the house.
Sure. That'd be all right.
I'm gonna need to see inside your backpack.
I'd like to see what you're studying.
What did you hit her with?
She wasn't strong enough.
Blaming herself for the marriage.
Timeline is off.
Sure.
You knew.
Your daughter killed your wife and you knew it.
Susan attacked Becky as soon as she went into the house. But you admitted to having another drink. You would've heard the attack.
You went into the house and found Susan wiping blood off of her hands. You sent her back to her grandfather's. You came up with a story to tell the cops, and then called 911. You were protecting your daughter. And now she's protecting you.
Well, either way, you have to live with it.
Broken nose, broken cheekbone. Somebody worked him over pretty good. There's a piece of his shirt that's missing. That doesn't look like a tear from a struggle. It looks like it got snagged on something.
There's heavy foot traffic but no blood. It's got to be a body dump.
But why here?
Dispatch didn't say anything about another body.
I'll get its blood to tox.
They get a look at the intruders?
It's a big desert.
And the nearest town is Pahrump. That's about 30 miles from here.
Who are you today, Moses?
Grissom and I are going to take a little walk.
The vic's shoes were scuffed at the toes, so he must've been dragged. 
Well, whoever they are, they like junk food.
Does the Luxor count? Eh, what do you think? I haven't even been to New York.
Keep walking, we could come upon them today.
So you like archeology, huh?
I found the point of ignition.
Molotov.
Sounds like a motor.
Think someone's in there?
Half of Nevada was a weapon site.
Stop. You're not going any further without backup.
That's a good question, Jim. I think we're about three miles northeast of the Copeland house, in front of some kind of military installation.
Jim, can you hear me? 
you're breaking up. Jim?
Lost him.
I don't hear anything but the generator.
After you.
Anyone here?
Me, too. They're so young.
Who's there?!
Las Vegas Crime Lab! Identify yourself!
I don't know if they drank spiked Kool-Aid, but they drank something. Smells like alcohol.
Well, these earthly bodies got a good workout first. Big room, big bed, light show. This cult was about getting laid.
So while you were watching shooting stars, they were dying.
And two people are missing.
Well ... would you settle for a flying saucer?
Nick, I got a real low signal; you're cutting in and out. Say that again.
And what about the blood in the elevator shaft?
No, that's unlikely, after all they torched his car, dragged his body three miles and dumped it in the Copelands' backyard. Anything on the liquid in the bottles?
Nobody dies from a martini.
Well, that's enough to kill a horse.
So I was wrong; they did take a trip.
Ten grams percent of ketamine times 12 bottles, that's 300 milliliters of ketamine? Can't score that on the street.
What did autopsy say time of death was?
How did you know that?
Nick, was TOD same for everyone?
Okay, thanks, Nicki. Got to go.
Did you notice those buzzards earlier?
A silver Beemer in the middle of the damn desert? Yeah. Nice wheels. Somebody sure went out of their way to hide this car.
Decomp.
Fits the description of the leader, Joseph Diamond. Guess he never made it to Australia.
Well, assuming this is Diamond and Ty Bentley was a spurned lover and not a member of the cult ... we're still short one body.
Hey, Nick. Well, there's no hits off the fingerprints from the kitchen cabinets. Dozens of unknowns, none of which were in the system -- no work cards, no prior crime. So I expanded the search to other databases, and I did get one hit: a Mark Horvatin, 17 years old, junior ROTC. His print was in the kitchen, but not in blood. Could just be a friend.
Blood pool closest to the front door, and the size nine-and-a-half shoe print ... both in Jeremy's blood.
Jude stepped in Jeremy's blood.
Blood pool number two. In the hallway,
... between the foyer and the kitchen.
Nina's footprints, dual contribution, Jeremy and Jude.
Blood pool number three ...
... Nina's blood.
Yeah, Nick, I got the DNA results back. Blood pools were confirmed for mom, dad and Jeremy. None of the blood was Cassie's, so ... 
... either her death was a bloodless crime ...
Where's the father?
Wound pattern and GSR suggest a tight contact shot.
Joey is better off without me. Christina Adalian. Postpartum depression so bad, it leads to suicide?
She wanted to make sure that her baby was quickly found and fed.
Sara, check out the blood on her hand.
And what appears to be -- is not. 
Can't find a red pen anywhere.
Some black and white particles. Want to hand me a hinge lift?
Who do you keep avoiding?
Ah, that means you should answer it.
No, it can't. 
No one on your team receives cost-of-living adjustments until those evaluations are turned in.
Sofia.
I'll have Greg run down the gun's serial number. Nick is covering the autopsy.  Warrick and I will finish the processing here and I'll keep you posted.
What would you do without me?
Diorite granite.
Yes!
Actually, senior year I took rocks for jocks. I dated the TA.
As a matter of fact, I did.
Her ex happen to be working today?
See, Mr. Peters, we know that you and Christina technically never had s*x, so when you found out that she was pregnant, I'm guessing that you felt that she cheated on you.
I mean, that had to have made you really angry, right?
Why did you lie to us? Claim that you hadn't seen her in months?
Well, it's too late for that, my friend. We need your DNA. Open wide.
Uh-huh. Yeah. That must've been nice for you. So ...
Is that why you paged me?
And Evan Peters isn't the father?
Surrogacy ... that would explain her hymen.
Her hymen was intact, which is consistent with in-vitro fertilization.
Yeah, that is a problem.
Oh, hi, Archie.
And?
Thank you. So I understand that you're going up against Mark Thayer. 
The guy's an ass.
Well, I've seen him on the stand. He manipulates evidence.
So do you think that Thayer is presenting the jury with faulty forensics?
Huh. I don't know who killed Christina Adalian, I don't know how she got pregnant and I don't know the identity of the baby's biological parents.
I now have to share this office with the day shift supervisor. She's got some kind of thing for waterfowl. What's up?
Abandoned embryos?
And Sunflower tries to find women willing to gestate and raise the leftovers?
I knew a stripper who claimed the exact same thing. So, is there any chance that you have a record of the baby's biological parents?
If I understand your program correctly, you take these embryos and you place them in available wombs.
Are you aware that throughout much of history, the official church position held that a child's life begins when the mother first becomes aware of movement?
In the 16th century, the pope proclaimed that embryos less than forty days old are not human. That is not my opinion.
Huh. No. Thank God I decided not to have one. But we are not talking about me, Dr. Ryan. Are you a medical doctor?
Oh, it's just a question. I take it that's a no?
We can get a court order.
Have you been able to analyze the ink?
You can match ink?
Uneven distribution?
Yeah.
A single woman adopts a leftover embryo from an infertile couple and upon her death agrees to give the child back to its biological parents?
You happen to have an address for this Mr. and Mrs. Johnson?
Oh, hey. How's the way of the gun?
Greg, never apologize for doing your job.
Where is your husband now?
No, thank you.
I'm so sorry. Can I ask you ... did you ever conceive a child?
Had you ever considered a surrogate?
Are you aware that one of those embryos was carried to term?
Well, if you don't mind, I'd like your permission to take a look at the clothing that you wore two nights ago.
It's protocol. The victim was shot at close range.
We're going to need to take all the laundry back to our lab.
Oh, hey, Ecklie said you wanted to see me.
I met Dr. Ryan in the course of my investigation. She runs an organization called Project Sunflower. Philosophically, I completely disagree with the organization. Perhaps I expressed myself.
I'm pro-choice. I'm in favor of stem cell research. I'm sorry she felt harassed, but my comments were in response to her statements. I don't think I was out of line.
Is that your position?
So are we having a philosophical discussion here, or am I being reprimanded?
What?
Tell me about the blouse, please.
It proves that she fired a gun, Carol.
Theoretically.
I'm sure that you did. But looking into Joey's eyes and seeing your husband must've torn you up inside. And the only person standing between you and your baby was the victim.
When was the last time you actually saw Christina?
What were you doing two nights ago, around 11:00 P.M.?
Can anyone verify that?
Mrs. Walkey, I need your help. Your daughter claims that two nights ago she was home watching television. Can you confirm that?
Thank you.
Four, maybe six.
There're two women that live at that house. Only one is a size
Would you mind emptying the contents of your purse?
No, it was probably transferred from your blouse, the one that you wore that night. I have a warrant to search your person and your home. Please empty the contents of your purse onto the table.
A red coda pen.
You knew that her sister was coming for a visit, so the baby would be okay. You killed her and then staged the scene.
Is this your husband?
He looks like a poker player.
Actually, it's ... the mole between his eyes that's his tell.
Because you used his gun. The gun he won in a poker game.
That's how it works.
I'm sure that Child Services will follow the dictates of Christina's will.
Did you ever consider that Christina Adalian is somebody's baby?
Officer, would you please escort Mrs. Walkey to lockup?
You know it's going to be a long shift when you get the call to respond to a command post.
What happened out here?
I'll stay with them. I'll collect their firearms and ammo.
Could you tell the types of firearms they were using?
And they were shooting the entire time?
The suspect had a gun in his hand.
Did you fire any shots in the alley?
Any magazines?
Captain Brass's service pistol was received with an empty magazine and one live round in the chamber.
Detective Curtis' service pistol was received with one magazine containing three live rounds and one live round in the chamber.
Uh ... Bell was in front of me ... but he was down behind his car.
Do you need a moment here?
So how are we doing on the suspect that got away?
We got ID's of all three dead suspects. Multiple felonies, drugs, immigration violations. They're all members of the 18th Street Chucos.
These witnesses credible?
Well, let's not get ahead of the evidence.
So the suspect had a gun pointed at Officer Davis.
What did Bell mean by new suspect vehicle? Can you take it back to the last communication before that call?
A 487 is a traffic stop. You were pulling over a Buick?
Did you see where it went?
Hey. I just interviewed Sergeant Adams. He and Bell were making a routine traffic stop when the Caprice cut in. 
The initial vehicle was a ...
I hate it when you do that.
Where were they?
I wonder if that camera works.
There's the Geo Metro. There's the Buick Regal.
He's not giving her much choice. So, just how bad was the meeting with the undersheriff?
Mm.
Looks like he's pulling out a hide-a-key.
Whatever they were about to do, they weren't going to do it in the Metro.
Hey, Nick?
Have you checked the inside of the wheel wells?
Oh, yeah, I can see that. Um, well ... since you're already dirty, would you mind checking out the left rear one for me?
Thank you.
I am looking for something to hide a key in.
Right.
Well, it probably fell off at the location.
Hey! 
Suspect on the run!
Wow. You had the baby and got your figure back in one day.
We got the couple driving the Buick. Female wasn't pregnant. She was a mule.
Found her rig for transporting narco inside the house, and unless these guys were in the mail order business, I think they were being shipped drugs.
Yeah.
It's the best lead we've got.
Surveillance footage from Angie's Donut Shop shows you carrying drugs and getting into the delivery car. That alone gets you ten years.
You know, based on the dates of these address labels, it appears that Carlos and Bianca were receiving two to three drug shipments a day.
Yes, and Narco found trace amounts of cocaine, for whatever that's worth. Well, the return addresses are all bogus, the couple is not talking, and all four suspects are dead. There's nothing more we can do.
This place used to make a hell of a meatloaf sandwich. 
Well, it looks like he was knocked out and thrown out. And there's some metallic silver residue on his cheek.
Maybe he was alive inside there. Digging to get out.
There's some scarring on his wrist, but not on the other.
Oh, now, they make a great pretzel.
Multiple contusions. He's got a band of dead tissue on his wrist. No fingernails.
So what are you thinking now?
Do you recognize this face? 
Dude got a name?
What, he left it behind?
They're calling poker players athletes these days. Seen the guts on them? Hey, can I get a pineapple cinnamon?
Thank you.
Oh, nice look.
That'll guarantee you the chicks.
How many hot dogs did he eat?
God, ugh. Do you think we might be able to ID the makers of the hot dogs from the ingredients?
Well, how about through the griddle marks?
Looks like those novelty chatter teeth. Weird.
Circus Town Buffet.
Well, he paid, didn't he?
So he still had his wallet. Do you have any surveillance on your register?
And are those the only hot dogs that you serve?
There's the chatter teeth logo.
I think we just found our Digger James.
Well, which one do you want? The guy in the silver face paint or Digger James?
Do I have a choice?
Yeah, it's part of my investigation.
Oh, it's still moist. That's good for me.
And what happened after the friendly hug?
Is that the guy in the hat?
No, thank you, I just came from Nel's hot dog eating tournament. I'm really done with food.
Yeah. He's was the most famous guy in Japan behind Yao Ming.
They ought to make it an Olympic sport or something.
Please? No, I can't go there. I can't.
Yeah, that's why you're leaving it behind.
I got an ID on dumpster guy. Brass is tracking down a current address.
No, his name was Jerry Gable.
That could explain why after consuming twenty-two dogs, he wanted more. Could also explain why he was found in the dumpster. He followed the food.
That kind of fits the victim's description.
Like having a full tank of gas, and gauge is stuck on empty.
So either he escaped or ... someone set him free.
Hey, you don't want to give us your name, fine, but you better explain why Jerry's not in this chair.
All right, look, I'm going to print this restraint. And when I find your fingerprints all over it, I won't need to ask you again.
Why did you leave your brother with somebody you didn't trust?
Couldn't you have left him with a family member?
What about some kind of professional help?
Yeah.
I always liked the circus.
Well, that's taking the fun out of it.
Green powder on her dress.
Well, there's plenty of surveillance.
Why'd you move the body?
Well, we know where she died. 
Where would you like to start?
I've got a monogram necklace. A.F.D. Well, it's not an ID, but I'll settle for initials.
You know, this crush zone is clearly marked.
So she was dead before she was crushed.
So the fatal blow was a separate event.
Well, the way things move around on that stage, it could have happened anywhere. She looks like she's probably in her mid-20s. She's in good shape.
Is well toned. She got calluses on her hands and feet.
But if she wasn't part of Cirque, what was she doing there?
The blood on the necklace was the victim's. A.F.D. Arcadia Federation of Dance. Celia Noel was a dancer, which would explain her fascination with Cirque.
I know what you mean, and yes, I do.
Not if he thinks he as to dance.
Ooh. I like him.
Oh ... awesome.
Yeah, I bet you do.
Ask her to dance. NICK: Yeah? CATHERINE: I'm going to get a drink. NICK: You're sure? CATHERINE: Go for it.
No, thanks.
Yes, I'm ... Yes, I'm ...  I mean ... No, Gil. I'm good.
So, how's your day going?
Oh, I doubt that.
Uh, look, you're not going anywhere. It'll be a lot better for you if you just cooperate and tell us what happened.
Mm-hmm.
Okay, David. Let's roll her over together.
Hey! Hey! Hey!
You ready to give me a name?
You know, you are in a very deep hole, in every sense of the word, my friend. Think about that while we chisel you out. It's going to take a few hours ... assuming we're careful. See ya.
That looks like it could be a double-edged blade. It's pretty thick, too.
Upward thrust.
Okay. Any idea what the weapon might have been?
Thank you.
You take them out, he puts them back in.
It's acetic acid.
Takes your fingerprints.
No.
We're coming up goose eggs on cement boy and his lady friend. 
No hits on AFIS, no hits on CODIS. Guy's got no work card, and his keys weren't a match for any vehicle in a three-block radius of the construction site.
Apparently, just a couple of law-abiding folk.
I'm sorry. It's horrible. But it's really funny. It's horrible and it's funny.
Are you okay?
You're tired.
CSI processed the knife and found blood from four different sources, -- 
-- three of which were intermingled together on the blade. One matched Addie Finch, the victim. 
The other two were also female. And based on the number of DNA markers they have in common, they're either sisters or mother and daughter. They are not related to Addie Finch. And both remain unidentified.
When I disassembled the knife, I found blood on the tang, which is the steel area under the handle.
It was a match to the victim's son, Jay Gregory Finch.
That's right.
No, the defendant turned it in to PD.
The defendant did not call for help, and he waited five days to turn it in.
It's possible. However, Mr. Finch's blood was found isolated near the handle. Stabbing is a messy business. I believe that Mr. Finch cut himself ...
It's not speculation.
Yes, but ...
We believe that the defendant stabbed his mother multiple times, stood over her while she was dying, and shot her in the forehead to complete the act.
No.
The bullet was a .38. The defendant's father, who passed away in
Do you keep it in a velvet-lined gun box?
Quite the salesman, Mr. Novak.
Finch is guilty.
Yeah, you're not a murderer; you just set them free.
What a load of crap.  We found his bags packed near the door. Addie raised a momma's boy and she'd finally had enough. She was kicking his ass out and he snapped.
No, but his CT scan showed damage to the amygdala and the frontal lobe. That kind of injury has been known to change personality, to make a person more inclined to violence. We need to ID his other two victims. Charge Finch with a new crime. No double jeopardy. We can even use the knife again.
He drove for five days, Nick.
But not to any of the small towns in between. They aren't connected to a central network.
It's our job to find a needle in a haystack.
You got a second?
Jay Finch got an oil change the day that he killed his mother. We compared the odometer reading on the work order against what it read when we impounded his car. The difference was 350 miles. We used that to create a search radius. Nick and I just spent six hours on the phone with sheriffs in every county inside that area. There was one unsolved case that matched our criteria in Larkston: a Laura Montoya and her 12-year-old daughter, Robyn.
And I don't buy it. I need to go to Larkston.
Look, I want a second shot at this guy. I want to get him before he kills again.
When are you leaving?
I'll be back before then.
How long have you known about this?
I guess I should be grateful you didn't stop by my house.
What do you want?
Climbing the 12 Steps. 
Well, you can check me off the list. Thank you for stopping by.
I'm fifty-fifty.
Perfect timing. Let's go.
Why wouldn't he?
Maybe he's got himself a girlfriend.
Why, 'cause I shaved my beard?
What are you talking about?
Oh, is that what people think? That daddy's little girl got herself a big inheritance? Well, let me tell you something, Nicky. All of Sam's money is tied up in a big hole in the ground on a very nice piece of Strip real estate, but I got no dog in that fight.
Catherine Willows. Nice to meet you.
Yeah, as would we.
Abduction?
Mother's the bigger threat. Probably took her out first. And once she was injured, the daughter got scared into compliance.
We're gonna need a blood sample to compare to our knife.
So if Laura was seated here ... the shooter would've had to aim downward to impact the asphalt.
Killer shoots Laura from behind...
Finch used a .38.
Thank you for your help, Beth.
There was a first time?
Why didn't you tell us this before?
So you initially thought that Guffey was also good for your friend Laura and her daughter's abduction. What changed your mind?
Stabbed, then shot.
Says here he has a history of violence.
Was Guffey in Vegas that week?
But you couldn't match the bullets to it?
I'm assuming you have the blood samples from the two victims?
Looks like Addie Finch's house.
Mary answers the door. The killer forces his way in ... stabs her.
Heather comes to her mother's aid.
Gets stabbed herself.
And flees to the kitchen.
He catches up with Heather and executes her as well.
Is this the phone that you pulled Guffey's prints from?
So we found one bullet in Addie Finch, you found one in Mary, one in Heather. There're three in this hutch.
But was it Guffey, or was it Finch?
Let's start digging.
Hey.
There's enough here for a comparison.
You need to get all the evidence back to the lab.
I'm gonna go see Guffey.
We'll see.
Hi, you've reached CSI Catherine Willows. Please leave a message at the tone.
Robert Guffey?
You can call me Catherine.
What do you like to be called?
There was a murder that was committed in Vegas two days before the Acheson-Curtis murders. I think the same person committed both crimes and I think that person is you. Mr. Guffey, this is how this is going to work. Every time you answer one of my questions, I unbutton a button. Are you ready?
You recognize this woman?
Why did you kill Mary Acheson and Heather Curtis?
Well, that wasn't an answer.
What's that supposed to mean?
Well, then why did you confess?
So now you're claiming you were coerced.
Just pace yourself. How come your prints were found all over the house?
So you called for help, but didn't stick around.
Let's see if your story checks out.
He's probably innocent.
Which brings us back to Jay Finch and his missing .38.
Well, look, the only way we're gonna get a conviction is we place Finch at the Curtis house. In the meantime, have Brass put a tail on Finch. I'm not sure if he's a flight risk. I don't want to take a chance.
I'll tell her.
Robert Guffey alleges that he was coerced into a false confession.
Did anything unorthodox happen during his interrogation?
Did you ever do an interrogation tired, Beth? Use your frustration, snap at the suspect just so you can go home? Use all that edge to get a confession?
You questioned Robert Guffey the exact week your best friend and her daughter disappeared. That's not just edge, that's a whole blade.
People under duress.
With the opportunity to right a wrong.
Guffey was in your house, but probably after the fact. We believe we know who actually committed the crimes. 
Mr. Curtis, your son was the only one that got out alive. He may have seen something.
May I ask him?
Thank you.
Hi, Danny. I'm Catherine. I'm trying to catch the bad guy that hurt your mom and your grandma, and I could really use your help.
What do you think?
Why?
What are they waiting for?
And then what happened, Danny?
And the knife?
We got him, Nick.
AFIS hit -- Jay Finch.
Norman Bates is keeping his mother alive and well.
Including the gun. 
He kept the gun case in here.
In court, he was always writing in his notebook. Now I know why.
Old woman answers the door, denies him access ...
And then he saw red.
Clearly not, but you don't have enough tricks in your bag to get him off this time.
Hey, you really want to defend the innocent? There's a guy doing life up in Carson City that could use an advocate -- Robert Guffey. Might even out your karma.
Just looking to keep my faith in the court system. Everyone deserves justice. If not the first time around, then the second.
Easy to miss. 
Jane Doe it is.
You must be Keppler.
Catherine.
Welcome to Las Vegas.
Is that how they're doing things in Baltimore these days? Out here, we don't touch the body until the coroner releases it.
There's bruising around the neck, relatively fresh. No other obvious wounds on the body. This girl's barely out of high school.
Excuse me?
That's a terrifying thought.
A daughter, fifteen.
I try not to bring my work home with me.
How about you?
Any kids?
White fibers.
Unlike most men, this one knows how to clean up after himself.
Well, he was hired to staff the new day shift, but ... since we're one shy with Grissom away, Ecklie wanted us to break him in for a few weeks.
If the nail had been torn off, the break would be smooth. It's jagged; she's a biter.
My hometown.
So I see you've got the soil and vegetation exemplars.
Thank you.
Probably not. Our best bet's the body. Which we're probably not gonna get much from, either. 
I like it.
No.
There were no defensive wounds on her forearms, no ligature marks on her wrists or ankles.
Highlights and lowlights. That's a hair process that isn't cheap. Nominal hair growth is roughly half-a-millimeter a day.  And based on the length of her roots, it's been about two months since she's had it done.
About two months ago?
Runaway?
Jury's still out, but he knows what he's doing.
I can't believe that she was compliant. Thanks, Doc. 
I'm guessing you've got cats.
Our guy's done this before. I'm with you there.
Okay. So we know what his type is and we know what he likes to do with them.
Okay, we've got three that fit the type. The cases were years apart. 1999, 1989 ... and 1975.
That's consistent with the latest victim.
Yeah, it's crimped. I remember those days. There's no way that style survives a shower.
Okay, Jane Doe '75.
How do you know?
You're a CSI, not a profiler.
Evidence. I want leads and IDs. Follow up on what you've got.
Which means if our guy still sedates his victims before sexually asphyxiating them, whatever he's using now isn't leaving a trace.
That one's it.
No.
So the original ME didn't even do an autopsy?
So she is one of ours.
On the outside of the tooth?
Jane Doe '99 had traces of chloral hydrate in her system. I read that dentists used to use it to sedate pediatric patients.
Her name is Veronica Sorensen, and we believe that she might have been a patient here.
Yes. These girls, do you recognize any of them?
Well, we're going to have to see your patient files from 1975 to
How long has Dr. Dave been working here?
Dr. David Lowry?
I'm Catherine Willows. This is Michael Keppler. We're from the Crime Lab.
Thank you.
No, we don't know who they are. Do you ever use chloral hydrate?
Thank you.
Except for the serial killer part, I hope.
I don't remember.
Dr. Lowry, would you please come with us?
We've got a court order to collect a bite impression from you.
Fine.
Be my guest.
I've gotten convictions from bite marks.
That's not enough for a conviction.
The killer's left front incisor is misaligned. Dr. Dave's smile is perfect.
Yes.
Wait, why don't you go in and I'll watch.
Because I have a pretty good feeling he's not gonna talk to me.
Found it next to the tire impression.
Science can only do so much with a cold trail.
Is that why you're in Vegas?
Oh. We fake a crime scene.
Assuming they can be deceived, which they can't.
I'll remember.
Hey. I need you on a 411 tonight. 
PD recovered twenty stolen motorcycles. They're at the Dupont Towing Lot.
Take Warrick with you. It'll go faster.
Um, nothing I can talk about. Keep me posted on the 419. Greg's going to meet you at the scene.
Zamesca was shot three times with a nine millimeter. We've got two sets of shoe impressions. Two sets of tire impressions. A plastic Jumbo Cola cup. Drugs were found in Zamesca's car, in plain view, but his tox was negative.
Crime scene was a remote location.
Car was a bloody mess.
Did Mr. Holstein also donate his brain matter and bone fragments?
Well, without actually shooting the guy, this scene is going to be slightly less than perfect, but it's just you and me out there.
Well, if we use one of my guys, they're going to figure it out.
I'm not used to faking it.
Hey, Henry.
Really?
Henry, I need you to step out and get a cup of coffee.
This is not a request.
It's all yours. You can get out now, Detective, and ...
You got it. Oh, and there's some fresh clothes in the back of the vehicle.
Sorry, man.
So, Mike, you said reverse forensics didn't work in Baltimore. How come?
You steal cars before you became a CSI?
Note to self.
Excuse me?
Plan A was the photograph. Anti-drug crusader doing lines. Career buster.
He was a hard man to kill. Simon panicked. Which explains why he left evidence behind this time.
Sorry. I'm at a 420. Similar MO to Zamesca.  Press is all over us. I need permission to get the body out of here ASAP.
Of course. Now, which mortuary's on call?
I'll take care of it. Thanks, Doc.
Called the morticians to get it out of here. Gunshot victim.
Yeah.
No, um, take the perimeter, get started on a diagram.
Thanks, Warrick.
Got a partial print off the straw from the soda cup. AFIS hit Edwin Dennison, aka Rat.
Nick, we got a print from the Holstein case. Street dealer. We're bringing him in now. And he looks dirty for Zamesca, too.
Excuse me. I grew up in this town. I know about playing the odds. You are gambling with my team.
I'm not quitting. But I don't like it. And I hate lying to my guys.
Hey, Nick. 
What do you want it for?
We have evidence and a confession. You can't just come in here and take over my case. 
Nick, as your supervisor, I'm ordering you to back off.
Simon had to believe it when he saw it on the news.
I understand how you all feel. I am sorry. I did not have a choice.
Sara?
Okay, look. We can still get Simon. He only walked on Zamesca. He drove Monique Carter's vehicle out into the desert. Nick's established that. Did he kill her, too?
There's another half a dozen calls to Hugh Griffin, Bud Small, Frank Townsend. All known associates.
You are aware that you talk about the killer in the first person?
Any good news?
Oh, well, that narrows it down.
Let me guess, multiple BFT?
Warrick found a bloody champagne bottle at the scene.
I know how hard it is to wiggle your ass all night. Now, why would you want to spend all your hard-earned money on a guy whose job it is to be with you and 24 other women?
He's doing the same kind of thing that you are doing on the pole for the guys.
And what would you like us to do with those?
Heard we have a dead out-of-town cop.
Trenton?
David, you got the TOD?
Did you find the hand?
Probably come back to the hooker.
Bath towels haven't been used.
So either she was lying in wait ...
Let's pull the elevator surveillance. 
This is Catherine.
Mike. Where have you been?
No, but we got some info from the deadbeat who burgled the hooker's apartment. Claims he found her purse in a dumpster behind the Palermo.
Mike, are you okay?
Hey, Mike.
Did you get anything from the dumpster?
So ... Ecklie wants you on days now that Grissom's back, but ... I could talk to them, get you to stay with us.
Yeah, usually transfers don't fit in, but ... think about it.
Do we have an ID on the blonde?
I just finished running names off Courtney Evans' incoming calls.
Here it is. Priors for prostitution and a last known.
Well, if we can find Suzy, so can a retired cop. He needs her dead.
Mike? Mike, where are you going?!
Why would McCarty have a bloody gun with Keppler's prints on it, in his hotel room?
No. Could Mike have touched it when he found it?
Maybe he's being set up.
He was with me in A/V. Nobody has seen him since, and he's not answering his cell.
What are you saying, Nick?
PD's on their way to Suzy Gibbons' apartment now.
Welcome home.
I don't think Suzy works out of here.
Jim?
And –  -- what about the victim -- Detective Graves?
Okay. 
I know a lot of working girls operate out of the Siren. 
Okay.
Hello.
Where have you been? Everybody is looking for you.
Then come back in.
Let me help you.
Mike, don't do anything stupid.
He just called, sounded desperate. Like a man with nothing to live for and nothing to lose.
Yeah. I'm on my way. I just wanted you to know.
Mike!
Mike.
Mike.
Mike.
Mike, hang in there.  Call the paramedics.
You're gonna be okay. Just stay with me.
I'm here. Stay with me, Mike.
Mike?
Hang on, Mike.
What?
Where're you going? 
Gil, where's the fire?
But ... we caught the 'miniature serial killer'; he confessed.
So maybe he arranged to have it sent postmortem.
So, now it's personal?
No ... at least not on our shift. 
I'll check with days and swing, and see if anybody caught a case that matches.
Why not?
It's dated the day after tomorrow. 
Prints and DNA are going over the package and wrapping paper.
Return address was an empty lot. Any clue as to who the victim is?
Well, she's not wearing a wedding ring. She's probably single. Her eyes appear to be bloodshot. Petechial hemorrhaging, maybe?
Blue smudges on the pillow. Blue mascara on the victim. 
Our vic gets comfortable, grabs a little shut-eye ...
... and never wakes up.
She's going to be smothered.
If you interpret this headline literally, the doll is the victim. That's different than the others.
Keppler said something like that once.  He did come down on the right side.
That's from the Izzy Delancy miniature. What's it doing here?
It's deja vu all over again.
This could be the source.
Killer returns to ... complete the miniature the old-fashioned way. 
And things get a little messy. But in the end ...
-- he puts everything right back where it belongs.
Well, they appear to be consistent with the sofa pillow cushion at the scene.
Other than the fact that it's out of its skull? Pigmentation's unusual.
Nick and Warrick did say that she was a little ... spacey when they met her, but they didn't mention any shaking.
Would they have shown up on a poison tox panel?
Hey! How'd it go with the sheriff?
Well, I got the final trace report on the bleach water that spilled at the scene, but ... the fluid in the ear was biological. Water and proteins.
Mm-hmm.
The smudges are from the pillow. There were no tear tracks. I don't think the victim was crying. I think the killer was.
When you cry, your tears sometimes can pick up skin cells from your cheek.
The DNA in your tears that were found on your sister's body proves that you were there. I imagine it was the hardest thing you've ever done. But you did it.
There's no ... assisted suicide protection in Nevada.
I understand. You're under arrest.
Both kids have an ATM card. Neither's been used since they went missing. No calls were placed from either of their cell phones. There's an APB out on Ryan's van-- no hits. An APB has gone out to local hospitals-- nothing yet. I know. It sucks.
Where do I start? Megan and Sheila phoned each other about a dozen times. A handful of calls were placed to Charlie and Bonnie. They're both on the cheerleading squad. Hair up or down? Black socks or gold socks?
Ryan, uh, and Megan exchanged a few calls. He phoned home twice. His last call was after the game to a Diane Kentner. She is the photography teacher at the high school. Warrick is following up and ... I'm going to collect DNA exemplars from the kids' houses. My favorite part.
There's a large rectangular blood pool at the center of the sleeping bag ... with several satellite transfers. At each corner ... a four-plus-one pattern consistent with transfer from bloody hands, indicating the body was carried on the sleeping bag.
Between ten and twenty semen stains. Some overlaid with blood.
Ugh.
Yeah, crabs. I am buying Lindsey a chastity belt.
You are so creepy sometimes.
Unless someone arrives at the party with them.
A s*x pervert with an STD? That's not going to narrow it down.
Yes.
Busy night.
When I first started doing this, everybody I worked on reminded me of someone.
Somehow, we all get past it.
I'll start with the bathroom.
He had a gun. I found grip and slide impressions in some powder on the bathroom counter.
Noise factor? You can't scream once your throat's been slit.
I may have something for you to feed to the monster. 
And the pattern on each is consistent with the knife being wiped off. I think that the killer cleaned off the knife after each kill.
First was Emily ...
-- then Lauren ...
Libby was next.
Then Cammie was attacked, followed by Jennifer. 
But you were right--Becca was attacked last. It was all of her blood that was tracked throughout the house.
He stepped in her blood, walks into the bathroom to clean off the knife, back out into the hallway, down the stairs.
To maintain control. I see a clean knife, I think that the others are still alive and ... I'm more compliant.
Maybe by the time he got to her, he was unable to ejaculate.
Did you get any prints on that knife?
And by his own admission, Mullins had been in that house at least a couple of nights.
No car keys and no unaccounted for ... cars in the vicinity.
She gets taken along for the ride, jumps out trying to escape.
Don't tell me you're tired of the field already.
I take it you're not gonna pull a Sanders on us, then?
You have something for me?
Yeah?
Okay. You got make and model of that car?
Oh. 
And are those ligature marks?
She was dragged by her wrist.  We found a seatbelt adjuster at the scene. Maybe she was dragged by a seatbelt? 
Her eyes.
They're the wrong color. They were green.
Green contacts.
Yeah, that's been shaped, rolled and twisted. Las Vegas origami. Pretty corny.
That bad, huh?
Here we are.
Maybe in more ways than one.
Yeah, that depends.
This your idea of romance?
We found it in Simone Molinez's purse.
She's dead.
You've got a GMC truck? Where is it?
Disinfectant.
Seat's damp.
Hey, Carey, there's blood in your car.
Well, it's a hell of a lot of blood for a nosebleed. Looks more consistent with the body of a bloody girl.
This is Catherine.
Interesting line of work.
Needle-nose pliers aren't exactly a fine surgical tool.
You talk to Scott?
If he's anything like his friend, I'll sure he'll give you plenty of attitude. Let me know what he has to say.
A .38 fragment recovered from a suspect in my homicide matched a .38 bullet that Greg found near the strip club drive-by.
Over what? Why were these guys shooting each other up?
Wait a minute. Why would Simone even be with those guys?
All right, how are we going to prove any of this? I mean, we're not going to get any answers from the suspect in the truck. He's lawyered up.
No match to the truck. Doesn't even have seat belt adjusters.
Excuse me.
Did you see me last night?
Who was I with? Describe him. Was he white, black, tall? Hair color, car?
Who was room 229 registered to?
I may have been roofied and raped. I woke up here. 
I, uh, improvised my own rape kit. I've got pubic combing, nail scrapings, vaginal swab, urine samples ...
I called you.
Yeah, I know procedure. I didn't want an official investigation. I-
Uh ... I got to get this, uh, stuff to the lab. Room 229, it's right up there. Please print it. And keep it between us.
Thanks.
Yeah.
No. Thanks.
I said I didn't need your help.
It's a urine sample.
Get it to Tox. And ...  Check this for spermicide. Call me with the results.
Just do it.
Consider this a proficiency exam.
Sam. What are you doing here?
Oh, yeah. I heard about that, um ... I'm sorry I missed that. 
Monday.
Uh, yeah, I'll call you when she's had a chance to catch her breath.
Keep the change.
Excuse me.
You were working last night.
Do you remember me? I was ... I was here.
Well ... do you have any surveillance cameras in the place?
I'm with the Crime Lab.
So you've got nothing that covers the customers or the dance floor, or ... ?
I did the best I could, Lindsey.
Work just ... really got out of hand.
Lindsey. I really am sorry. I hate it when work gets in the way. I love to watch you dance.
You did? That's so great!
Fantast ...
Is my daughter okay?
Lindsey!
Lindsey!
Lindsey ... !
I don't need that. I'm fine.
No -- 
I'm refusing treatment. Just give me the release form.
Just give me the damn form!
They got Lindsey. Warrick: I know.
They took Lindsey.
It was an SUV. And it was silver or brown.
And they drove that direction. I never saw it coming.
They came from this direction.
These are acceleration marks. They were waiting for us.
I should've told you, but I didn't want a sermon. I did my own rape kit. Came back negative.
I appreciate that.
I-I know.
Any luck on the prints?
That's impossible.
Don't go there, Nick. They were gonna get to me, one way or another. It had to have been at least two guys -- one who was driving the Cougar, and the other in the SUV.
He reached through the window. Print the inside of that handle.
Sam?
It just happened. Who told you?
Well, I can't talk right now. I'll let you know when we find something out.
Sure, Sam.
Sam!
What do you know about what happened to Lindsey?
Who's using us to get to you? This is your granddaughter we're talking about. What the hell do you know?
Can you guess what you're going to give me What does that mean? Who's behind this?
Where is she? Who has her?
Like hell! I blame you! I blame you for this!
Business? You don't have a business. You're a thug in thousand dollar shoes! 
Thanks for not disappointing me, Sam.
What?
Lindsey!
Lindsey!
Where are you, Lindsey?!
Lindsey! Lindsey!
Lindsey!
All right.
I'm right here, Lindsey. Right here. I'm right here.
I'm right here. I'm right here. I'm right here.
Deep breaths.
Breathe easy. Deep breaths.
Okay. It's okay. I got you. I got you. Everything's okay.
It's okay. It's okay, baby. It's okay. Everything's okay.
I got you. Everything's okay.
She says she's fine. The doctor is assessing her now. We still don't have an ID.
Yeah. Yeah, he was there.
I can't get a face.
Did you get a name?
Thirteen alleles in common with Robert O'Brien?
The guy who grabbed Lindsey is Robert O'Brien's brother?
Joe Hirschoff. O'Brien's partner.
Hi, Sam.
Everybody in town knows you're here every Thursday night. And usually with my mother.
Just save it. I only came here to tell you to call off your guys.
Joe Hirschoff and his partner invested everything they had in the Eclipse. But it went bankrupt before you broke ground. You formed a new corporation to finish the project, leaving those guys with nothing.
Uh-huh. O'Brien and Hirschoff lost $20 million, right? O'Brien caved and stuck a gun in his mouth. Hirschoff wants you to pay him back. So, where is he?
Come on, Sam, this isn't old Vegas anymore. Let the police handle it. Or have you already killed him?
Sam? Sam?
Somebody help me!
Huh?
What's the weapon? A Taser? Come on!
So, Greg-O gets a hit at a mob restaurant, and I get a clown who can't take a joke?
Hey.
Hey, you said you were gonna rush DNA off that Taser that I checked in.
Run the unknown against the semen that I found on the clown wig from my Peeping Tom case last month.
Let's just say I got a real good hunch about this one.
Whoa.
Either that or this guy's got the world's ugliest Johnson.
This guy's got a nasty crack on his head.
There's linear markings on the contusion.
I think it's backwards.
I-N-C-H.
And what are those gray spots?
So what killed him?
Well, he was found floating face down in a pool, so let's start with the obvious. Any evidence of drowning?
Well, the entry and the exit are the same size, but ... it doesn't look like a bullet wound to me.
And what are the odds of it not hitting a major artery?
So COD is anaphylactic shock?
And nothing else.
And Happy ends up dead. Not bad. Who's Brass going to charge?
Smashed with a crowbar, shot by a crossbow, poisoned by shrimp and now bitten by a snake?
Yeah, these are straight. And one's deeper than the other. Look like needle marks.
Which girl?
Well, according to Tox, the hemolytic component of the venom had time to break down tissue, which means that it had to have been in his system at least a few hours.
Doris administers some very special first aid ... and Happy's little soldier swells to battalion size.
How romantic. So, now Happy is not so happy, because he'd heading into anaphylactic shock.
At this point, you'd think he would've just called it a night. Watched a little TV, hit the sack, but no.
What?
Well, it's certainly enough blood to suggest foul play.
Used a steam cleaner. Would've denatured any DNA.
How about the husband's?
So what's this?
How is Connors, this pig farmer, connected to the victim?
Kind of a club?
Chyna was a dealer at the Palermo. Looks like Shannon was a player. Gold level.
Reptiles ... UFOs ...
What's Shannon doing with him?
Oh, Jim ...
Yes, the, uh, tip has been wiped clean. Negative for blood. But I did find a couple of partials on the blade just above the hilt.
And a couple of full prints on the handle.
Hey, Greg. You up for a bite?
Oh, it's only a bad year if you do a bad job, Greg. You're having a great year.
We have our weapon?
Yeah.
I'll keep that in mind. The sword I found at Shannon Turner's made the tool marks on the skull. Shannon's prints were all over the handle. And the partials on the blade, above the hilt -- Chyna De Vere's.
Did Wendy find anything on that drop of blood on the carpet?
Warrick? Come at me with a sword.
All right, so I push back hard enough ...
-- bang you on the nose. Brass wouldn't have seen that.
Which was found in the soil at Hank Connors' ranch.
Have you looked inside yet?
Preston was found naked, right?
Preston's wallet. Somehow I doubt aliens would have folded his clothes when they abducted him. 
So Clarissa drove him out there and he left his stuff in her car.
This case just came down to Earth.
Did you find anything?
Oh.
They're both Chyna's.
So whose prints are on the steam cleaner?
Men are snakes.
Is she going to be okay?
Heather, I'm Catherine Willows. I don't know if you remember me. It's going to be all right.
Did you call Grissom?
Who found her?
You've got something to look forward to, Jim.
Chewing tobacco. Looks fresh.
Lady Heather has a house for this. Why take her show on the road?
Yeah.
Did she have ligature marks?
Well, that doesn't make any sense. She was a dominatrix. Not a submissive.
Or somebody didn't know the rules.
S &amp; M is a rich man's sport. Kind of like hockey -- a lot of equipment.
Heather told me, five years ago, she was clearing 20 grand a week.
Beautiful ... smart, intense ... charming. The only woman I've ever seen rattle Grissom. I mean, he kind of liked that forensic anthropologist, Terry Miller. Remember her?
But she wasn't enough of a challenge for him.
Heather, on the other hand ... uninhibited and can beat him at mental chess. 
They had chemistry. And he is a scientist.
I have no proof and I know he'd never tell me, but I'm certain they spent the night together. Wonder which one wore the chaps.
I mean, more power to him, really, to find somebody outside of work
My fantasy does not include costumes, or pain ...
-- and certainly not sawdust.
You?
The substance that I found under the saloon window was chewing tobacco.
Yeah, Vernon Porter. He was fired from the force back in Chicago.
Oh.
I'm thinking he had a front row seat.
Yeah.
There's no way that he could afford her. So why would Heather cover for him? Unless he's just a witness.
Gate's unlocked again.
Maybe.
Okay, come on, Jim, give it up. I know you know something about Grissom and Lady Heather.
Oh, yeah, he's dead.
Who shot the sheriff?
Ruger Single Six. Gun hasn't been fired.
Might have threatened her.
Well, the one that killed Porter's still inside him. Porter was shot in the back. He was facing away from the saloon.
To get to the window, this bullet had to be fired from the opposite direction.
Oh, wow. These look authentic. All revolvers.
I'll get the guns to ballistics.
We're investigating a homicide.
You were there all night. Want to explain why? Look, I know that you don't go home and cuddle your insects every single night, but why would you go there knowing that we're in the middle of an investigation? And now she's a prime suspect with you as her alibi.
So, when your personal life gets tangled up in a case, that's off limits?
Isn't that a little hypocritical? 
You know I'd slap you, but I think you'd enjoy it too much.
Your timing sucked.
What's this? So now you're building your own?
Well, the underwear that I pulled from the toilet was a 38-inch waist. Porter was a 34. He didn't attack Heather.
One of Heather's clients pays for a kinky Wild West fantasy only to discover he had an audience?
'Cause she's not talking. Her business is based on discretion. Couldn't count on Porter's discretion.
Oh, Mandy got a hit off the revolver and the ammo box.
Benjamin Oakley.
Yeah, I'm calling Brass.
Hey, Jim ...
You took a shot at Porter.
This is a warrant for your DNA.
To prove that you also attacked Heather Kessler.
Open up.
Comparing construction materials of the new doll to see if it's the same work as the others?
Is there any doubt?
So in trying to catch the killer, we've changed his behavior.
What?
Well, there was no physical trace on any of the other dolls or the miniatures.
Must be on a separate circuit than the lights. I just reset the breaker. That do the trick?
What you got?
The outlet doesn't look scorched.
Looks like some burned skin. The sink is still damp. Hey, hit that crack.
I think we may have found the Mini Killer's booby trap.
Sink is cracked, water pours in, touches the bracket ... Trevor touches the water ... zap.
You saying the killer's the next-door neighbor?
So the genius steals power from his neighbor and ends up electrifying Trevor's sink.
Doesn't explain what that doll was doing there, though.
Great Rainone and His Little Bisque Doll. Oh, that looks like the doll images from the miniatures. What's a bisque?
A grown man who sticks his hand up the back of a doll and speaks like a girl. Sounds healthy.
Who's Chloe?
Okay, we're in a David Lynch movie. Where's the dwarf?
So, being a performer and a parent had to have been hard at times.
Had the girls been fighting?
The Great Rainone is in great denial. Of course, losing a child at the hands of another could do that to you. You do agree that Natalie killed Chloe, right?
Let's just focus on the details. There's always something to go on.
Here in the lab?
I don't know. This just feels different.
Some white cotton fibers. Probably from the towel. Could be she was dragged into the elevator.
From any floor except this one.
Well, no 13th.  Yeah, unlucky numbers. Different countries, different superstitions. That was something Sam taught me.
And we just eliminated the one we're on.
Thirty-three floors.
That's all right, David. Why don't you help me turn the body? Examine her for injuries.
Wait a second. 
A rose petal. American Beauty.
Oh!
I'm gonna take a wild stab and guess drowning.
We got a dead cop.
I know these suites. This furniture's been moved.
What is this is, an eight-sided pattern? Feng shui?
Now we know how you drown in an elevator. You don't.
Don't step in. Just take a look around and do you notice anything missing or out of place?
And do all your infinity tubs come with rose petals?
When the water flows, the money flows?
I think that working helps. I mean, you know that.
Any chance it was an accident?
Oh, yeah. Someone held her down.
... put up a fight.
He knew there were cameras in the elevators, but not in the hallways or the service area.
His sleeve is wet.
Stop and smell the roses.
Mr. Hsing, I'm Catherine Willows, from the Crime Lab, and I need to see the suit that you wore last night.
A rose petal from the victim's body was found to contain traces of vitisvinifera -- grapeseed oil. The kind that this hotel puts in your tub. We know that the killer's shirt was wet, so I need to see your clothes.
Thank you.
Rose petals in the bathtub had traces of grapeseed oil. Killer's sleeves were wet.
Dry cleaner screwed us.
Yeah. Enough to keep that body moving, and leave me with a lot of partials.
By what?
Maybe it was his payday.
Personal.
Uh, David, hang on.
Well, it's not necessarily a woman's.
All right, slick. Now what's with the suit?
Today ended ...  ... an hour and a half ago.
Well, if that's the case, why don't you help my day end quicker and help me isolate some shoe treads.  Take the pants.
So ... ? How'd you do on the stand?
Female?
How many different patterns you have there?
Well, I've got three different ones on the t-shirt.
I mean, this one that looks like an athletic shoe sure got around. As did this pointed toe high-heeled one. Check out the heel mark.
What do you know about work boots? I'm guessing you haven't worked a day of hard labor in your life.
Yeah, for skinheads.
You know, one of the victims was Hispanic, the other was Jewish. Maybe this was a hate crime.
Is that your number, Cha Cha?
So tell me ... what does a dead guy sound like?
Oh, is that funny?
Someone called you from his phone-- who was it?
12:33 A.M., last night.
Who's this guy?
Farami, huh?
If it was real, I might.
When I swab that knockoff Farami buckle and I find this tourist's DNA on it, you're going down for murder.
No, but Mr. Ruiz did. And you were the last person that he called. That connects you to both crimes.
And what did Tara want?
Is that your idea of a party?
A what?
Why would you want to do that?
And you do this all the time?
What is Pig's name?
So if ... fannysmackin' is all about tourists, why'd you go after a dishwasher at the Golden Sapphire?
Oh ... the king swine.
It could be a mass text. Lindsey once sent everyone in her phonebook the same message at the same time. I got stuck with a $300 bill.
From Tara's phone? They'll know it's us.
We don't have Pig's phone.
Okay, but how do we get the pig?
Pig and the piglets are in the pigpen.
Did you know that Pig, aka Cole Tritt, was the only adult. The rest of them were under 18. One was 14.
I mean, they weren't all delinquents. Demitrius James was a college student.
Make me slit my wrists, why don't you? I'm raising a teenager here.
In eighteen years, this is my first crucifixion. In a Catholic church with no crucifixes.
We could all use a little forgiveness.
Well, the blood pool is gravitational. And the blood trail ...
... the tips are pointing towards the statue. She was bleeding on the way in. I'll backtrack, see if I can find the point of origin.
This one's for you, Sam.
Oh, hi.
I saw you at the crime scene. I thought you were on desk duty until the coroner's inquest.
Yeah, there's no therapy like work.
You doing okay?
Well, hang in there.
No sign of forced entry.
Does this look like the condo of a woman who sings weekends at the Gorilla Room?
Fight must've started here. Got some blood, some here on the pillow. But no blood trail. The real beating took place in the bushes at the church.
Explains the bloody tissue found in the back seat of Hugo's car. I guess she got a bloody nose or a fat lip here, ran out and used Hugo's car to go to the church.
She had quite the career.
Sofia.
You recognize that guy? That's Father Frank Berlin. I mean, a lot younger, obviously. 
You know him?
That's 'the Big Hombre.' He sells cars on TV. She's known these guys forever.
Hmm. Could be the one she was strangled with.
Or you're being chased.
DVD's on pause.
Well, there they are again.
There was a man in her life.
Mr. Frisky.
Folic acid.
We'll have Robbins run a pregnancy test.
Hi. I heard Grissom wants us to keep digging. This Charlotte's car?
Well, unless Father Frank drove it that night, and we've got no reason to believe that he did.
Do you have a big enough sample for DNA?
Well, I'll compare it to Father Frank's shoes. If it's not a match, I'll get a warrant for Cody's shoes.
Your grandson's into sports, huh?
Just like the movies, they sniff them out.
You worried about the money?
Got something here.
Lucas was last seen wearing khaki-colored board shorts.
Perfect place for a little privacy.
It's the door itself, not what's inside. There was a struggle here.
We've got tags.
That's far enough away from the door. It's possibly a separate event.
Somebody's kids were playing here.
Sofia ... A dental bridge.
Two premolars.
Hi. 
Grissom said you could use some help. What haven't you done?
Hope I die before I get old.
Bloody glass.
Any luck?
Drug panel on his urine came back negative. He's clean.
No pain meds in her system either.
Well, there wasn't any trace of Fentanyl in the nephew's system.
If that's the case, it's motive for both.
Everybody's got dirty laundry. Sometimes it gets you killed.
Thanks, David.
Well, I got a phone and keys, but no purse.
Take the purse, leave the Lexus?
Hmm. Car's been keyed. 
Registered to a Dr. Gary Sinclair.
Wife and mother.
They're even wearing the same toenail polish.
Well ... eight-year-olds dressing alike I kind of get, but grown women? That's weird.
Don't tell me they died at the same moment.
Our two cases have become one.
What happened to Mr. No-Such-Thing-As-Coincidence? Simplest hypothesis is usually the correct one. If you hear hooves, think horses not zebras.
Murder/suicide. Jill killed Amanda. Felt guilty, then killed herself.
Did you notice any photos of Amanda or her family in Jill's house?
Right. And I looked through Amanda's phone book. Jill was not even in it. 
Brass spoke with Jill's attorney for next of kin. None existed. She's leaving a small fortune to various charities. It just sounds to me like estrangement. Okay, even if that's not the exact way it went down, I'll bet you a dollar that the twins' deaths are related.
If they're relatives, yes: sisters, husband and wife, father and son.
Okay, what?
Bad.
Well, based on the contents of her purse, she's more the lip balm type.
They don't put victim's DNA in the database.
With Amanda's husband, Dr. Gary Sinclair.
What she is?
I'm going with yes. Ballistics came back on the bullets that killed Amanda. There's only one gun with a six right polygonal barrel that comes in a .41 caliber: a Baby Eagle-- Israeli military issue.
Unless you served in the Israeli army like Natal.
Classic he said, she said. They're either acting in cahoots, trying to confuse us, or Natal is acting on her own, thinking that the wife is the obstacle standing between them.
So Amanda was set to pick up dry cleaning in the morning, but it looks as though she had a sick child, so she went at night instead.
Amanda.
So having the same toe nail polish and watch made sense when we thought they knew each other, but now? I mean, they even have almost the same handwriting.
We were both right.
You ready for this?
The guy's been spotted more places than Elvis.
CHAINSAW. 
Live fast, die young ... Doubt he left a good-looking corpse.
Little piece of Vegas history right here.
What, that he was a thrill in the sack?
Quite the ego on that guy. Even in death, he was larger than life.
My father was not a Mob guy.
Greg -- 
You were a kid in the '70s.
No.
Is this on record?
What? In a puff of smoke?
Did it work?
There was a lot of dirty everything back then.
Skipping town with a load of cash.
So you think this motorcycle cop killed him?
I was sixteen. 
Jaws was sold out, so I went looking for trouble. Found Mickey Dunn.
All he said was, if I met him outside at 2:00 a.m. sharp, -- 
-- he'd show me the time of my life.
Well, I showed ... he didn't.
All I know is that I dodged a bullet. And he didn't.
Freddy Kreuger, ‘Nightmare on Elm Street.'
Parts one through nine.
‘Friday the 13th.'
Yeah, and look what happened to her.
They never get the spatter right.
Chainsaw -- sound familiar?
Mickey Dunn.
I think I got all I need.
Yeah, Officer Eddie Sanchez. He had a wife, two kids. He also had a skin condition commonly known as acne which he treated with tetracycline.
That drug incorporated into his bones, making them glow under ultraviolet light.
Helped us identify him.
Thank God you blew me off when I didn't know better.
Sam Braun stopped you?
You're not going anywhere.
I'll give you a hint: you're not in heaven. How long you been living with a bullet in your chest?
Why God invented X-rays.
I'm guessing it's a .38 ... 
...which matches the .38 that we took from the body of Derek Paul, -- 
-- which also matches the one that killed Eddie Sanchez.
I got one for you.
Yeah.
I bet you heard it. It's strictly B-list stuff. No-name cast, summer release. 
Four Vegas punks run a monster off the road. 
They shoot him, they rob him, they leave him for dead. 
But everybody knows that shooting the monster and killing him are never the same. 
A young honest cop arrives and with him comes opportunity. 
The monster changes his name, his face ... passes for human. 
Rides off into the night.
Mickey, you know that real horror stories never end.
Why now?
You mean this bullet?
Mob doctors ...  ... become Mob doctors because they sucked in the first place. B
Oh, you've been out of the game awhile. The homies they have in the pen these days never heard of you.
No, Mickey, that's life.
Previously on CSI ... 
Great. Now if we could just see what it saw.  Where are the damn tapes?
You recognize this woman?
What about her?
When was she here tonight?
Taser barb. It doesn't tell us where, just how.
Nick!
Okay, that's good news.
If there are shoe prints, that means she got out from under the car.
Everybody listen up. We're searching on foot.
I'm not seeing any more footprints, are you?
I think we just lost the trail.
What?
This is better than a footprint.
Yeah.
Good girl.
You see another one?
What?
Oh ...
It's not her.
Must have got caught in the flash flood. Couldn't make it to higher ground.
She's a survivor.
How is she? 
Where are you taking her?!
Hey, could you do me a favor? Um, bring me one of the swabs?
There's some white trace on the soles of her feet. You were at the scene. Did you happen to notice any white material that might have transferred?
Hmm. Excuse me.
Would you help me remove her dress?
Let's just roll her.
That look like a needle mark?
And she stayed?
So, that's a three-and-a-half-hour window.
Thank you.
Can you tell me anything about these bites?
So, it's unlikely it's coyotes.
Are you going to be okay with this one?
Mmm. She was found with a bunch of dead dogs. What about the husband's tux?
You just exonerated our only suspect.
It's called your salary. What have you got?
Phenytoin and pentobarbital. An anti-epileptic and a sedative hypnotic?
Dog bites, mass dog grave, euthanizing solution. Well, those drugs are controlled substances, so their sales should be registered.
Del Santos Kennel.
Yeah, Nicky, where are you?
We need to see your controlled substances; any records you have on a confiscated dog named Hannibal; and I'll have to print everyone who works here.
Anybody else have access?
Are you a licensed veterinarian?
Oh, I didn't realize that techs were allowed to perform surgeries.
What do you think that is?
There's a hidden camera in the medicine cabinet pointing right at it. It's an awful lot of blood.
We've got the victim's blood and hair at your kennel. She died of an overdose of the same drugs that were found in a medicine cabinet that only you had access to.
Mr. Card, I found this hidden camera in the exam room. Where's the receiver?
How do you figure? It was on the morning news that Lizzie was dead. And when I came into work ...
So instead of calling the police, you cleaned up the crime scene.
You cheated them out of $50,000?
Gee, I hate to see the sport tainted like that.
Okay ... what is this?
The victim was tied to that stand.
What's everything?
Classic he said/he said.
There's no forced entry at the kennel. He has no alibi.
He has a good lawyer. Realized that we were onto his client and wanted to throw us off the scent.
Problem is, we don't have enough evidence to convict either one of them.
Well, you don't look like a guy who just got a confession.
You think he would have gone to the kennel with her?
Check the phone records.
Hi.
Yeah, it's a violent sport. Check out his hand. Riders live with constant injuries and pain.  They always get on that next bull and try like hell to hang on for the next eight seconds.
I used to date a bull rider. Cowboy up.
So there's just a few bills in his pockets. David, why don't you give me a hand here?
Some guys keep valuables in their boots.
That guy was a walking time bomb. Any trauma with sufficient force would snap that vertebra and sever the spinal cord.
Forget how to use the scissors?  Put your fingers in the holes and squeeze.
This looks like semen.
Oh, God, that movie made me cry.
You don't say.
Riding glove. So he wasn't planning on re-riding Wintwister when he left here.
Bed looks used. Maybe he partied with Tiffany.
Nobody ever wrote me a poem.
That's sweet.
Sounds like it was more than a money relationship.
Broken bones -- he gets up and rides again.
COD was multiple blunt force trauma.
Yellowish.
Maybe Cody had rejection issues. Could be why she was leaving him.
Well, that's over an hour after Cody's body was found. Thanks, Jim.
Hey.
Well, it is his truck.
So ... get this. There's a witness that puts Tiffany's TOD after Cody's. He didn't kill her.
So ... say this partner thought Tiffany knew something about the semen rustling and he ran her over to keep her quiet.
We've got Cody's phone. Find out who he's been talking to.
And we know that someone other than Cody put the electroejaculation equipment into the truck and drove away.
Now, that's the rope that I collected from Cody's room?
Jim?
We ran his ten-card against the prints from the truck and the equipment. They don't match.
Right. So now, I'm convinced that Cody Latshaw's death was not an accident.
It's kind of a lonely life, these cowboys, every weekend a different town.
Yeah, but no man is an island. I mean, obviously, he had feelings for Nancy or he wouldn't have written her that poem.
The bull?
Let me run it down for you. Isolated stretch of Route
Single gunshot wound to the lower back. Passing motorist called it in. Fire department arrived within 12 minutes. Fire burned so hot, they had to use foam to put it out, which, of course, is never good for us.
We'll keep in touch.
So the Deputy DA got out of bed for you? Whose bed?
All right.
The debris path starts approximately 100 yards from where the vehicle came to rest.
Gesundheit.
New car engines don't catch fire, not by accident.
And guys on fire don't stop to close doors.
Probably?  Hosers.
Nick, come here.
Um. Clear that off, would you?
Oh, hey, Dave, nice haircut. What gives?
Mm. Oh, make sure you get those photos to Grissom.
Jacketed hollowpoint. One cannelure. Looks like a .38.
Never thought I'd be disappointed that we solved a case.
Court personnel files?
What are you looking for?
So you're looking at the judge, his staff, the clerk that issued the warrant, court reporter, any cops who knew ...
Thanks for coming in, Archie, I appreciate it. 
Dude.
So we need to review some phone records, and fast.
Oh, no. I can narrow it down. It's a 90-minute window, yesterday, at 12:00 noon to 1:30. Just cell phone calls.
Timothy O'Shea. 702-555-0124
Do a reverse lookup.
Cole Zampas ... 702-555-0145
Jessica Varge ...
Darby Vance, 555-0137.
Marie Leahy.
Has she called the number before, within the last two weeks?
Okay. Try the text messages.
Every night around 11:00 p.m., someone texts her a number, which she then calls the next day.
You know what? Good for you. Divorces should be like Band-Aids, one quick yank and done.
Oh, what do I know? Eddie and I stayed together way too long. Every decision was an act of Congress.
I'm sure the magazine will go on without him, Dave.
What are we looking at?
So it's probably not a gunshot.  Stabbing?
Did he just leave?
April was here ... and Huxley was here.
Stab him. Extract the weapon—drip, drip, drip.
Near Ms. Shasta.
You know, one of these could've been the murder weapon. It's approximate in size and shape. And everybody had one.
Well, could've been whatever food was on the skewers. ALS will pick up anything that's fatty or dairy-based.
I'm sorry, but this is a stupid idea for a restaurant.
I need to see what I'm eating.
Where are you?
Hi. Warrick: Hi.
Night vision goggles?
Kind of defeats the purpose of dining in the dark.
All skewers accounted for, none of them bloody.
We've got a high-profile dead guy in a locked-room situation, with sixteen diners and three blind waiters. Give me something.
It's not a Band-Aid. It's a nipple flower.
Sticky.
Hey.
So, Huxley had honey on his hairpiece, ink in his brain and blood all over. There were three people who had honey on their hands: the frisky couple and Michael. Two people who had blood on their clothing: April and Michael. And there was a total of five people moving around the room: two Manducci brothers and all three waiters. Now, that's a lot of lists for Michael to turn up on. He does work there, so there's reason for it, but ...
What would he have against Huxley?
A blind chef?
The man knew his way around a kitchen, and his way into my heart. Michael would spend hours teaching me, feeding me ... loving me.
If you wanted to frame Pippa, why did you plant the pen in Shasta's purse?
Why are we parking in an alley two blocks from the crime scene? 
Call it in. You got it, Mitch? 
I don't see any luggage. Wedding rings still on the fingers. Probably rules out robbery, but not infidelity. One gets to watch the other one die? 
Anything under 110 is manageable. Above that, crime rate goes way up.
So ... middle-class couple ...
... takes a walk on the wild side, checks into this dump for ... some fine dining and romance. Somebody breaks in, kills the man, and tortures the woman. For what?
Well, wouldn't be the first time some nice folks from Henderson came east of Fremont to score.
Not yet. Maybe Tox'll find it in them.
I don't think they helped.
Drug dealer with priors for assault-- nice.
Is that it?
If you've got a missing kid, I've got a pedophile.
Well, according to the sheet, he served five years and made parole. A registered s*x offender. We know where he lives.
Hi, Amy. I'm Catherine Willows, I'm with the crime lab.
Swab. 
No, no, Amy, this, this is ... um ... this is in the mouth. Staff tells me that you've already gone through the SAE kit.
Not in those words. Amy ... the man that took you ... he cannot hurt you again. We've got him.
Well, they're evidence for now, but you'll get them back. The clothes that you wore -- were they yours or ... did he make you wear them?
I've contacted Child Services. You'll have to stay there for at least tonight. Do you have any relatives?
I've got a daughter. She's almost your age.
There'll be some counselors there that you can talk to and ... take as much time as you need and ... whenever you're ready, to go back to school. Where do you go?
Jefferson High? I don't know that one.
Amy, what grade are you in?
What are you doing?
Would you give me the shirt off your back?
Okay.
Easy.
I guess Amy was. A trophy after s*x.
Ground her for life. Take the laptop. 
Well, you push kids, they push back. Things can get out of hand pretty quick.
So Amy escapes, she goes and gets her knight in shining armor.
They return to the motel.
The parents are gone, but the room's still paid for.
They have s*x and burgers.
Dad gets killed first ... quick, but Mom, the true believer, the one who wanted to drive out the demons, she has to suffer.
I'll call Brass. We'll go pick Amy up.
We need to see Amy Macalino.
Her what?  Control, this is Willows. I'm at CPS. I need backup. Code Three now. 
Ugly guys do gamble more when there's pretty girls to look at.
So, Mom, who made the first move?
Supervisor Willows from Crime Lab. What's going on here?
'Cause they played the Frontier in Ronald Reagan's act. And only humans have a saddle joint. In fact, that's how we were able to swing out of trees and end up here. Opposable thumbs.
Oh, I know. My dad built this one.
Yeah, this is CSI Willows. I need to hand a case off to swing. Conflict of interest.
Oh, you don't remember yesterday? Calling him? Texting him?
How odd?
Then you won't mind giving us your fingerprints and DNA?
When I was growing up, there weren't any lakes in Vegas, just hotel swimming pools.
I think Mr. Cyden might be dodging us.
We've got a 419.
So you think that's a message or his dinner?
Probably rules out suicide.
No signs of forced entry, no signs of struggle.
Maybe the same person who killed the tranny killed the boyfriend.
Offer to buy his house dated... yesterday. Who tears up an offer in this tough market? Purchaser: Jonah Quinn.
These could be hormones.
Carpe diem. Lots of them. Numbered and dated.
R-41
Why would he be giving hormones to fish?
Hey, what are you up to?
Carp. Paul Cyden died holding one. He had a freezer full of them, some kind of an experiment.
Do I know how to turn you on or what?
And the carp from Paul Cyden's freezer had high levels of estrogen plus other prescription drugs.
I thought they drink ground water.
How?
Because the womb is the only place a human lives in fluid ... like a fish.
Here's the bullets pulled from Paul Cyden.
Brian bought a Ruger SP 101 revolver two weeks ago.
Mrs. Towne, don't blame yourself. You had a teenager who was depressed and not communicating and you push too hard and they pull away ...
Is that when you found his gun?
Mrs. Towne ... he was trying to save your son, not hurt him. We found this letter on Paul's computer. You need to read it.
He was going to blow the whistle. I think that's what Paul was trying to explain to you when you went over to confront him.
What about Brian's mother?
Her son's gun plus motive -- that's not enough?
Lynn Towne goes free.
That's not enough for me. If their lawyers can hog-tie the EPA for years, someone's got to go around them. They've got to take Brian's story and the research to the press. I mean, if ... if it's happened here, what's to say there aren't other Brians out there?
As a mother, maybe I don't care.
Either that, or the killer's got a wicked sense of humor.
Oh, yeah, yeah. I know, Dave. Everybody knows that.
Looks like the Lady lost a heel.
No, it's ... uh ... it's the wrong color. It's too red.
And I am not seeing any prints. It's been wiped clean.
The vase is clean. I've got a spiral notebook filled with dates, times and weights. Looks like she was a bit concerned about her size.
That guy looks familiar. Oh, that's Vincent Lafoon. He and his brother own the place.
He's trying to make it look like somebody broke in. I think he's framing Zarco.
I don't know, but according to Brass's notes, he thought the system was down. So, we found no physical evidence linking Zarco to the scene. Vincent knew he had an easy fall guy. He's been playing us the whole time.
But if she had been gored first by another weapon and then axed, there would have been a lot more blood.
Her body came up light?
Well, we should go back, expand the search perimeter, try to find the actual murder site.
Okay.
Nick. Why don't you ... uh ... take the offices, and Ronnie and I will start in the storage area.
Hey, Nicky, what do you got?
Okay, I'll ... uh ... meet you back at the lab.
Busy.
No, thanks.
Sometimes, yeah.
I don't go out with persons of interest in an ongoing investigation.
Don't call me pookie.
Catherine.
Catherine.
If you're implying that you know something about Weatherly's death, and you're not giving it up, that makes you, at a minimum, an accessory after the fact, -- 
-- and that buys a long stretch for a stubby guy.
Here's my card.
If there's anything that you want to tell me as it pertains to the case ... 
Uh ... call me.
Hey, Ronnie, anything?
It's supposed to.
I think we just found our murder weapon. Hidden in plain sight.
Looks like Weatherly's missing heel.
This is where she died.
Ah, damn. 
Oh, good.
Auxiliary generator just kicked in.
And I don't have any service.
I'm going to get a dolly for you to move this thing. Photo it and get it back to the lab.
This is Catherine.
Yeah, you'd better. They're department issue. And if you lose it, you replace it.
Oh, yeah.
We found the pipe that killed Weatherly. It's in the print lab being processed. She was killed on the soundstage and then dragged over.
Okay. Let me know what you find out.
What do you want?
I know.
Okay, shoot.
Where are you?
I thought there was no phone transmission from there.
I just came from there. Why didn't you tell me then, you annoying little man?
If you're screwing with me, I will to string you up and beat you senseless.
Control, this is C-13 Willows, trying to contact C-147
Okay, thanks. Over and out.
Ronnie ... 
... uh ... I'm, I'm coming. 
Just ... just stay on the line. 
Ronnie? 
Ronn—
Dispatch, this is C-13 Willows requesting backup to meet me at Repulsion Pictures.
Ronnie! 
Good question. David was in Henderson on another call, so, when Greg and I got here, we just started processing the house. 
Found the victim in the bathroom, covered with a towel. We got a plastic print on the bathroom door. It's the strongest piece of evidence -- I photographed it and transmitted the image back to the lab; Mandy got a hit to an unknown palm; case info was in ViCAP. And then, Dispatch called, telling me to stop processing immediately, by order of the FBI.
Oh, beats the hell out of me.
Well, there may be a resemblance, but kids change a lot in six years.
Agent Malone, why don't I fill you in on what else we do know. There are no signs anywhere that the boy actually lived here. The sleeping bag on the couch indicates that he was probably a house guest. Why don't you follow me into the kitchen. 
Bring us up to speed, Greg. 
Which suggests that he was an experienced criminal. What do you know about this guy?
Well, this time, we think it's hammer.
The round indentation wounds are consistent with hammer blows. Do you see any similarities between this victim and the babysitter who was killed six years ago?
Covering a body usually indicates remorse on the part of the killer.
Maybe he knew Carmen Davis. There's three toothbrushes, two of them in travel cases. My guess: the killer was staying here with the little boy. There was no sign of forced entry.
So, I assume we'll be sending over the case evidence to Quantico?
Half an hour? 
Was she raped?
I'll get it to DNA.
And takes it with him.  Was the babysitter raped?
Most four-year-olds will do what you tell them. Most ten-year-olds will do what they want.
So, I cross-referenced similar-patterned unsolves in ViCAP by proximity to rail spurs. There's at least a dozen cases.
If these are the work of your guy, he's piled up one hell of a body count.
We ran the fingerprints that Nick lifted from the casino IRS form. Got an AFIS hit. Terry Lee Wicker. Served two years in Sing Sing for burglary. He got out four months before Jack's original kidnapping, and get this, when he was sent up, he was married to Gina Farentino. Brass put out a broadcast.
Meadowood. It's off the 93, and it looks to be about ... 16 miles northeast of your location.
It's okay. Brass has a line on the resident director.
Hey! Let her on through.
I saw this documentary once on suicides off the Golden Gate Bridge, and they interviewed a survivor and he said the moment that he let go of the railing, he realized that all of his problems were fixable, except for having jumped.
Uh, yeah, Nicky, what you got?
Well, the body landed close to the building, so if she didn't come from the roof, she must have come out of a room.
Hang on.
Yeah, there's a long perimortem abrasion on the lower back.
Hey. What do you think this might be?
Yeah. We think she was pushed. So, between her knuckles -- suggests a struggle?
There's no trauma, but the wet mount indicates that she definitely had s*x.
Yeah. Such a scary thing, sending your kid off to college.
Yeah. In fact, we looked at WLVU last month.
She's free on campus, might as well be a thousand miles away.
Oh, yes, I remember this case. A high school senior at age 12.
Well, we don't know that just yet. I mean, we don't have Marlon's DNA to compare with the semen that was found in the victim. All the old evidence was expunged with the verdict.
And no vaginal trauma because she was too numb to resist. It's possible.
You know, that just sounds like something a girl tells her parents in order to make them feel better. I mean, we know she had s*x. There was GHB in her system ... I think you just need to test everything in her room that she may have ingested.
The condition of the interior could be the result of a struggle, or the simple, understandable panic of a man trapped inside a freezer. In any event, the emergency release handle appears to have been bent and rendered inoperative, and several chemical containers broken in the process possibly releasing chloroform and methyl ethyl ketone into the space. I'm sending samples to Trace to confirm.
Trace. Is there anything you can't do?
This could be a case of lab geek humor gone wrong.
Oh, hey. How are you?
I can't ask how you're doing?
Oh. Well, maybe you should take a few days off, for once in your career. I mean, you've got enough stored up. Go after her.
What do you want?
Hello? Hello? 
Unknown caller. No call list. Probably disposable.
We've been calling him. There's no answer.
Well, city landfill is a couple of miles down the road.
Do I get a choice, too? Because, if you don't mind, I'm going to take the garbage man.
Good luck.
Most likely, the garbage compactor.
Oh, it's always better to be compacted dead rather than alive.
You do not. Knows some famous people. Or uses famous nicknames for his friends.
Nick!
I think I just found ground zero. I think Jason was killed here.
At least now his mother has someone to bury.

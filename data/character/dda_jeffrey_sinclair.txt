Nick.
He's waiting for me.
He's a confidential informant. The DA's investigating Steve Card, Gino Aquino, Elizabeth Rodriguez, everybody associated with the dogfighting ring.
Knowing about it and proving it are two different things.
Same old-- he... used to ride with the D-Streeters, shot his old man when he was 15, did four years in juvie, got out, tried to turn his life around. We busted him 18 months ago for possession and assault. He cut a deal.
It took me over a year to get him inside that dogfighting ring. I'm reserving judgment.
I'm sure you did, Tommy.
It wasn't enough. We needed to see the dogs fighting; that's the felony.

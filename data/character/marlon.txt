After that, Kira said she was done with me.
Thanks for coming.
Yeah, I do. I need to know ... what I did to deserve this.
We both know I didn't do that.
No, I'm not feeling all right.
Hannah, they're going to put me away for the rest of my life.
Please ... after everything I've done for you, after everything we've done for each other, at least tell me why.
And I love you, too.

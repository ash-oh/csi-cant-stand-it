I don't care what he had. Always sticking his nose where it don't belong.
I left it on the post. I don't want it in my pocket when I ride.
Nope. Bought it a couple months ago. Somebody stole the last one. See, we got a big problem with that around here the help walking off with stuff.
Yeah.
Looks like bronc finals, Wichita, Kansas. Spent a month there training for the finals.
Mm-hmm.
This photo here ... uh, March, 2000. 
What do you all want now?
My belt buckles. Somebody stole it last year, like I said. 
Sure.

He doesn't wear his hair like that.
What happened?
Who shot him?
Where was he found?
He wasn't alone, was he?
I married a cop. With that comes alcohol and women to take the edge off. First time ... he said it meant nothing. He promised never to do it again. By the third time ... I told him to stop confessing. I wasn't going anywhere.
I wasn't willing to trade my family for the flavor of the month. That doesn't make me pathetic.
We've been through this. I didn't care about Manny's indiscretions.
So I talked to him on the phone. He was drunk. He was raving. I didn't understand half of what he said.
I was in Laughlin with my son.
I don't understand what you're talking about.
Oh, you b*st*rd!
You can't prove that.
She was nothing. He jeopardized our family for that?
Oh.  I caught her with him. She answered the door like she belonged there.

Thank you.
I saw what happened.
Police make me nervous. You guys aren't cops, are you?
I was kind of taking a break, hanging out at the P.T. Cruiser. I was laid back in the heated driver's seat when I heard the siren.
Just like that.
The car was sitting right here.
No. It was beige, beat up. Hazards flashing. People leave their cars here all the time. I wait ten minutes then call for a tow.
No. The driver gunned it but I didn't hear a screech.
Motor oil? 
Which means?

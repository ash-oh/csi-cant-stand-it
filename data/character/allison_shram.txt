No, she missed the morning news meeting. All the section editors are biting my head off. Look, I don't have a straight answer for you. No, I've called, I've e-mailed, I've texted. She'd have to be lying dead in a ditch not to answer her phone. I know. Bye. 
Can I help you?
Okay, is she in some kind of trouble?
Oh, my God. I ...  God.
Back off. Get away. All of you, go! Go! 
Look, you can't drop a hot one in a room full of vultures. They smell blood. Half of them were wanting to pry her ass out of that chair for months.
I don't have access to that kind of information. You're gonna have to go down to Human Resources.
Yeah, her laptop, of course. It was like an extra limb.
That was a new thing. She's always been neurotic, but lately she's been secretive, like sneaky â€“ rolling her own calls, making her own appointments, talking with editors from other newspapers. Honestly, I just thought she was looking for another job.
Are you kidding? She had the only key, and protecting her privacy was how I kept my job.

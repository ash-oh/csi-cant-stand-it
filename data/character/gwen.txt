No.
No, no. It doesn't matter. We're already ruined. Look, they're just ... they're just trying to protect me, all right? 
Donny.
Please, Donny, I just had the worst morning.
Oh, my God.
Hey, Paul, it's Gwen. 
Come on, babe. Let me in. Work me out.
No, uhm, Paul cut down on clients so he could train for Mr. Las Vegas. It's next month and he really wanted to win this time. He cancelled my last two workouts.
If he cancelled again, I was going to.
Just once. Last month.
I'll tell you what I want.
What's wrong?
He said he had a headache. But I mean, he was training really, really hard, so he was probably just tired.
I don't know. I don't care. I mean, just lying back on that bench and sweating and pushing the weight with all of his muscle right there I mean, it, it was totally ... motivating.

Warrick, right?
I saw your presentation on longitudinal striations of the toenail in Dallas, A.A.F.S.? Really good work.
Oh, I'm Chandra. Chandra Moore. 
Thank you.
Same.
Pleased to meet you, sir. I'm a fan.
I-I'm sorry?
My...  ... why?
Yeah, well, in my lab, I decide what gets run and when. Unless Mr. Grissom tells me otherwise.

Thank you.
Could you please take this somewhere else?
Oh, I can't go through with this!

They all want ... they all want you, and I can't be you. 
I'm going back to Connecticut.

No, I-it's his, the one you took away. I tried to help him. I thought I was doing everything right. I think I might have killed him.
I was crossing the street. This SUV came out of nowhere -- almost clipped me. I turned and there was this body lying in the street.
Oh, my god. 
Help! Help! Somebody call 9-1-1!
I freaked. 
I did everything wrong. I didn't tilt his head back. I- I- ...
I didn't clear his airway.
Why?
Yeah. Look, you've got to know about the affair. Check his bank account. He paid out 35. You want to counter?
It's over, man.
It's over. Look, you better split. Go call 9-1-1.
Shut up, you slut!
She's always going to be my wife. You're never going to have her!
Get away from me!
Call an ambulance!

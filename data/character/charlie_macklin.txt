I told the kids not to report it. And I told 'em not to leave the room. They were smart enough to listen. Janelle's fine. It's a game.
I've seen it. 
She does school plays. Says she wants to be an actor. At least that's the story this month.
Right on the button. Let me tell you about Janelle: I sent her to a nice prep school back east, she flunked out on purpose. I gave her a Bentley for her sweet 16, she wraps it around a tree. I've been putting up with this crap since she was a kid. I'm done.
Yesterday, when she asked me to comp the suite. You want me to call her, fine. She never goes anywhere without her cell phone.
I pay, she wins. You want to know why the abductors want the money wired to the Caymans?
That's where Janelle has her trust is set up. She knows how those banks work.
Got his daughter back in a couple hours. Yeah, I know the story. Steve Wynn's daughter was a real victim. Janelle isn't.
You do that. And when Janelle turns up, crying, saying how sorry she is, you make sure she answers for it.
I'm really disappointed with you, Janelle. All these years you spent around me at the casino and you think you can put something like this over on me? The only thing I'm giving you tonight are four little words: Get ... your ... ass ... home.
Janelle left a message a couple hours ago. She ... 
I mean, what kind of kidnapper ... lets you keep your cell phone?
Where did you find her, Captain?
Janelle loved airplanes when she was a kid. She was always ... begging me to go ... see them take off and land. I took her down there. A couple of times, I think. Her mother is in Paris. That's, uh ... what ... nine hours ahead. Kind of late to call right now.
Captain Brass, my wife.
I want you to find whoever did this.

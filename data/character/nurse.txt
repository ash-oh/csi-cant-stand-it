Sir, you can't be here.
Oh, I'm sorry, but Ms. Willows already asked for them.
She should be right with ... you.
Okay, if I can just have you lay back.  All right, Nora, I'm going to need you to relax.  Okay, now take a deep breath.  Good.  All right, another deep breath.
Right there.
They're preparing the surgery right now, Mr. Grissom. I'll be right back.
That's right, officer.
He's critical. Ruptured spleen, collapsed lung, fractured ulna, possible intercranial bleeding. Doctors are still waiting on the labs.
His personals are bagged -- top shelf. They're ripped up pretty bad.
He said he killed a boy -- ran over him?
No, that was it.
Right. Curtain three. Just out of surgery. Stable. She's still pretty doped up, though. You're going to have to come back later. You going to need these?
Minor injuries. He's fine. Mostly shock. He's with his mom. Hell of a night, huh? Take your kid to work, both end up shot.
Yeah.
She's ready.
You hitting every E.R. in town? 
These are all the jaw fractures that came in from two to three years ago.
We don't get as many of these as we used to.
Are you okay? Is there anything else? 
She was in the burn unit.  Bay number three.
You're welcome.

Here you go.
She refused.
I did a wet mount from a vaginal swab and got four-plus motile sperm present.
Guys like this, they keep doing it.
We need to get a -- 
Still in v-fib.
Three hundred! 
Three-sixty!
Out of v-fib.
I understand you're upset, miss, but there's no need to take that tone.
He's in surgery. The only thing you can do right now is take a seat and wait until he gets out.
He's coming back. That's an improvement.
The patient never told us.

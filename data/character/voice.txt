Who are you?
Are you a cop?
Good. Because if you had been a cop she'd already be dead.
Do you have a weapon?
Then put it on the ground, along with your pager, cell phone and that case you're holding.
Do it! We're watching you, CSI three Willows. Attempt to go back into the police station and we'll kill her. 
Attempt to contact any coworkers and we'll kill her. Any false moves at all, and Amanda is dead. 
Now get back in the car. You drive, anywhere but here and await my next call.
Take Boulder Highway South till it intersects ninety-three. Take the Yucca Exit, East, one mile. You'll see a sign: Horseshoe Tavern. You have one hour.
The briefcase.
Hand over the money get back in the car, and drive to a pay phone. The gas-and-go station Highway 582, South of Henderson. I will call you. I will tell you where she is.
Then she's dead.

So, what can Longevity do for the LV Police?
What's the problem?
All right. Well, I'd be happy to check. Will you excuse me, sweetie?
Yep, there he is. Roger Lapinsky, 37 years old, died of cardiac arrest. It's tragic.
And if you don't tell me what's going on, you're going to need a warrant.
Major organs have to be removed at the hospital and then transplanted into the new patients within four to six hours, but bone and tissue can be removed at any point and stored for up to five years.
I always have signed consent from next of kin.
Most funeral homes have tissue recovery coordinators. They choose who the parts go to. If you have a good reputation, you have a better chance of getting the parts. I help the dead help the living. 
If that's what it says.
I'm so disappointed with Mr. Heinz. He always seemed so honest.
No. That's the hospital's job. But as far as I know, none of the recipients have ever complained.
Oh, my God. 
You've got nothing on me. I don't care what that .. little body snatcher tells you.
They can try. That is what signed release forms are for. 
Uh-uh. I didn't do anything.
Well, that is your job, isn't it?
And you'll have my full cooperation.

All right, straight up. Janelle hired an eye-in-the-sky geek to knock out the cameras in the service area.
We swooped in, scooped her out, and bam, I mean, we were over it.
No. I wouldn't take a penny from Janelle. We've been friends since grade school.
Look, my parents have dealt cards for twenty years, all right? I didn't grow up with squat. Janelle, she didn't care about that. She still kicked it with me. So when she asked for my help, I helped. 
I wasn't even thinking about that. You don't even get it. You don't understand what it's like to be born and raised here. I mean, Vegas was a dirt lot until the '60s. I mean, it's lucky that I'm not a drug dealer, and Mr. Mack should be happy Janelle's not a junkie stripper. I mean, he was never there for her like my parents were there for me. They instilled good values in my head.
Uh-uh, nah. Vegas has got too many rats, and I'm not gonna be one of them. You want to know where Janelle is, I'll tell you. But you're not going to believe me.
I want to clear my name.
Kidnapping Janelle Macklin.
No way.
No. I don't know.
No.
No. It was just a prank.

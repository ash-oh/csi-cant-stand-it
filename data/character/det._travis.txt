Detective Travis. I'm ex-LAPD homicide.
Nice to meet you.
Uh, concerned citizens. Come on, right this way, please.
The weather's been pretty bad out here. I don't know if you're going to find much. A couple of teenagers were out here last night shooting off their dads' guns. One of them ... tripped over this thing.
Yeah, we were the second call they made. The first one was to Dan Rather ... who I don't think is coming.
From what I understand, they're always out here. See this guy in the silver lam√©? He put it on the watch the skies web site. It's been a freaking free-for-all ever since then. You know where you are, right?
It's the most secretive piece of real estate in the world. This is about as close to the base as we can get and still be on public land.
I guess the killer should've dug a deeper hole.
Can't you guys just beam him back to the morgue?
Hey. E.T. phoned home. I got an I.D. off the hearing aid.  Our alien is Reverend Edward Thomas of 49
Well, if the reverend is dead, who's running the place?

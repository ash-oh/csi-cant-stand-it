Pac-man, Pong, loved these games. Thought it was a sure thing.
You want some advice?
Never go into business with somebody you're sleeping with.
Bitch.
We broke up. At least I think we broke up. She skipped town without telling me, stuck me with the rent.
I didn't kill him.
Every penny I got. About 20k.
No, but I called him. Asked if we could maybe work something out. Told me to go screw myself, he'd see me in court.
You're going to find my prints all over that place. It was my store, mine and Melissa's.
Oh.
You had s*x with our landlord?
That didn't happen. She told me she convinced Basengi to give us more time on the rent. I-I didn't know she was banging the guy.
I didn't kill her!
You can keep the rest of it! All I want is Ms. Pac-man!
It was my dad's.
I just went to the arcade to scare him. Things got out of hand.
It was an accident. You guys have got to believe me, I did not kill Melissa. I didn't even know she was dead.

My wife's pregnant. Almost nine months. She beeped me. I was trying to get home. Couldn't believe the traffic.
We live on the other side of fraternity row. It's a straight shot from my office but I get to the freshman dorm, nothing's moving.
Around 8:30, I guess.
Yeah, I thought I was having a baby so I gunned it down the alley.
I veered to avoid the parked van. It was wet ... and I swiped the dumpster.
If I had hit a car, I would've stopped. It ... it was just dumpster.

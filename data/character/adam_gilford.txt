Of course I knew Becky Lester. I'm her boss. I'm the one who hired her. Hard to believe that was six years ago. And it's such a tragedy. She was loved.
Excuse me?
Becky wasn't in love with Ray. They'd stopped having s*x. If they divorced, she'd owe him alimony, and Becky didn't think that was right. 
She told me everything. She and Ray were living on vapors. They'd just taken a second on the house. She also told me that Ray was hiding money from her -- the insurance payout on his first wife. Look, if you suspect she was murdered, I can tell you why Ray did it.
At Western Airlines, VP's and above receive corporate life insurance policies--quarter mil payouts. Last week, a round of pink slips went out. We both got hit. Two weeks, she would have been out of here. And the insurance policy, suspended.
He killed her just in time to make a killing.
I just found the digital video and printed out the stills.
Did you check the P.O. Box today?

We all just started running when those two psychos started shooting it out with the cop...
I took a first aid course about a hundred years ago,
... so I-I-I tried to keep pressure on the wound, but it just kept bleeding, you know?
I couldn't leave Rufus all alone, scared, dying.
Mmm, sort of. He-he'd come in a couple of times a week and play the quarter slots.
Oh, the cop who saved us?  No. I couldn't see anything. I just heard all that gunfire just blasting away.

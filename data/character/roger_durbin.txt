Illegal use of fireworks? This is crap.
No one's complained to me.
Come on, guys. Let's go.
Anything happens in here, it's your fault.
Huh?
I've never been arrested for anything. I've never hurt anybody.
Well, I don't know about you, but in my house, there's rules. Terry and Owen know what to do and what not to do.
Somebody gets blown up, ... 
... it's nothing to do with me. I told you not to go in my house.
Then you must have put it there.
I don't know anything about it.
Sons of bitches! I'm gonna sue your ass into the ground. I hope you know that. Yeah. I'm gonna own you. I'm gonna own this whole place. In fact, maybe that's where I'll live. I'm just gonna move in here.
Just keep the camera on it, will ya? Watch.
Here, stir this.
Blowing stuff up.
Go ahead. That's good.
That's good. Get it good.

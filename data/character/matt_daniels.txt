How you doing? I'm Matt Daniels.
James is upstairs if you guys want to follow me.
Yeah. I told him last night. I'm the one in charge of dinging pledges.
Yeah, I mean, it took a long time for Phi Alpha to get its charter. We have a strict no-tolerance policy and as president, I enforce that to the letter.
State passed a law: No Hazing. It's six months in jail plus expulsion. We do not haze.
I could tell right off the bat James was nervous, you know? 
He was kind of the shy guy. I mean, he ... he wanted to pledge. He wanted to belong.
So, yeah, we gave the pledges an assignment: They were to go to sorority row and, uh, get ... different parts of their bodies signed.
Kyle caught him cheating in the bathroom.
I mean, come on, you're only as strong as your weakest link.
Give him the heimlich. Give him the heimlich. Give him the heimlich!
He's turning blue!
What are you talking about?
Yeah, Kyle, can take a joke.
Okay.
Hey, let's see what Johnson came up with.
Dude ... that's your girlfriend. She signed it.
Dude, where's Johnson?
Oh, oh, this is crazy.

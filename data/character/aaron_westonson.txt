Honey, who is it?
I remember you. You were here about Rita.
You found her.
This is about Rita. I have a right to know.
Four years ago, you tore this place apart. That was okay with me. Now you come back with no answers, and you're looking at me with that same face. I'm going to tell you the same thing I said before. I had nothing to do with Rita's disappearance.
Yeah. Help yourself.

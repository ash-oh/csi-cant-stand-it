What the hell is going on?
A warrant for what?
Guy was here this morning. Why?
We do it once a month. We, uh ... we all take turns.
No, no, no. We are a friendly group.
Erin is the greatest wife in the world.
Yeah. Yeah. It's fun.
Well, it's not like we were having an affair. That'd be breaking the rules.
No, means no. Arrive as a couple, leave as a couple. Drugs, never. Condoms, condoms always. 
I came home one night. I parked the car in the driveway and went to the fridge to grab a beer. It was the wrong beer. I was in the wrong house. Anyway, it just got all the neighbors talking. Variety is a good thing. And if you get the right group of people together, a couple of drinks, you'd be surprised what can happen.

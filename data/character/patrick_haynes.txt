Nice suit.
Welcome.
Well, thank you, Sheriff. Your presence here means a lot tonight.
Are you talking about the glass or the bubbly?
Well, if I'm smiling, it's because we raised $1.6 million for Mrs. Richmond's Burn Center tonight.
That sort of generosity deserves a raise of the glass, huh? 
To Portia.
Hey. We did it.
Excuse - excuse me.
By all means.
But worth every penny. 
House-sitting while hunting for our own place. Portia refused to take any money from us.
That's why, when she took off to Europe ...
It's the least we could do. After all, we know how to throw a party.
No.
Something wrong?
I hope we didn't embarrass you.
Fire away. Drinks for anybody else?
On a yacht somewhere in the Greek Isles.
You have a compass?
She's incommunicado.
Have at it. 
I don't follow.
Amanda didn't know she had even taken it till Mr. Grissom here told her.
Yeah. Yeah, my wife's not here. Time to convert lies into The Truth. I had s*x with Lacey before the party.
No. My relationship with Lacey was purely sexual. It was good s*x. Well ... great s*x. Whenever we could steal a moment, uh, we did. Just like an addiction.
Whatever do you mean?
No. No. I never gave her anything.
Honestly ... no. Those music boxes belonged to Portia, not to me. But Lacey had been by the house and she did admire them.
Human nature. We always covet what we can't have.
It took three of you to tell me that?
I slept with her, but I didn't kill her.
Absolutely.
What? See what?
You killed Lacey because I told her about us?
She's in Europe.
Portia.

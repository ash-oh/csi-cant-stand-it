Thank you.
Uh-uh, manager.
Uh, well, an agent gets ten percent and a manager gets fifteen. Listen, I'm here in town for a film festival and I have to get to a screening, so you can you just, you know, cut to the chase?
Okay.
Um ...
How do you know about that?
I have an agent friend who I work with who had a bachelor party out here, and Jason hooked us up VIP-style. 
He took us to Moon and LAX and Drai's and then of course, naturally, we ended up at a strip club. And everyone knows the best girls are at Pigalle Boulevard.
It couldn't get any better until the check showed up.
Ten grand? The manager said $800 a bottle. We ordered five.
No. No, no, no, no. I just think you overcharged us, man.
This place is a rip-off. And your girls? They're beat, overrated, and oversized. Get it?
I'm not paying.
No.
I mean, I was never more scared in my life. You know, he was so sweet enough to give me the choice of my throat or my genitals, so I chose the latter ... so I'd live. Then he charged my card and escorted us out to the parking lot. Oh, here's something really cool. I left with a broken nose, some sore wrists, and some really nice bruises underneath my arms. And I just should've given him the ten grand because I paid my plastic surgeon twice that.
Oh, yeah. I mean, he gave this guy Gedda a call right in front of me. Then he cursed him out and he told him he would never take anyone to Pigalle anymore.
Oh, yeah. By the way, if you're gonna prosecute this guy, I'm not a witness. There's a reason that I didn't press charges, if you know what I mean.

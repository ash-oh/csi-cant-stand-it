What did you do, walk into a door?
Okay.
Oh, good grief, girl.

You haven't seen your daughter all week.
I was a working mother too, you know?
Don't just assume that my time means nothing to me.
Catherine?
You're throwing more than you know away.
Go. Go. I'll be here when you get back.
No.
Believe it or not, Catherine does know how to say, Hello, how are you? Would you like a cup of coffee?
Let's go.
She's on a sleep-over.  So kill me. And I had dinner at Drai's with the girls. Filet to die for. 
Red wine always makes me two of the seven dwarfs: Sleepy and Sneezy.
A friend.

And why not?
I don't expect monogamy from him.

Why?!
He can't be! He has been so wonderful to me these past few weeks.
We have a history together, Catherine. We were young together. Some day, maybe you'll understand.

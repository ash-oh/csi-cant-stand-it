Hey.
Huh.
You see, tox revealed a bac Of .30 with several benzodiazepine sedatives, Along with zolpidem in her system.
That's not what killed him, though.
Unbelievable.
Both are sharp-force injuries.
Hmm, good shape, considering.
You know they celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary in October?
Guys.
After all these weeks, we found 'em.
Hey, Nick. Got a minute?
Nobody should have to die like this.
Looks like he's having a pretty good time.
Hey.
He wasn't so lucky.
Yeah.
I think he was alive when he went in the pool.
I could not imagine what Greg and Finn are going through.
All right, fellas.
There's a lot of damage to the neck. I'm counting three sharp-force injuries, and I saw five more in the back.
Might be the dead guy's face.
W-Wait a minute, Doc, hold up.
Um ... Dr. Robbins ... 
This one's still connected.
Sorry. Catherine needs to speak to you. Says it's urgent.
Sorry for the delay.
Jaw flexibility is minimal.

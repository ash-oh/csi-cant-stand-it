I don't understand.
Trust me, Roger didn't build a bomb. I love my husband, but he's inept. Just last week, the hose bib cracked. Front yard was a river. Roger was helpless till I got home.
He watched. I'm a teacher. Timmy knows which parent to go to for help.
He's with the State Department. You know, all that sensitive government stuff. Keeps him on the road. He doesn't say much about it.
His parents are dead. Roger's an only child. He doesn't have time for friends. There was this one night, years ago. We were both a little drunk and ...  Roger confessed he was CIA.
His other wife's name is Debbie. Once or twice a year he'd call me by that name. I ignored it. 
Look, when Roger and I were together, he was a good husband. Terrific father. It was almost like being in a state of suspended honeymoon. 
He asked me to get his dirty laundry out of the trunk of his car.
There was a plastic bag with all the makings of a volcano. Including the stars I had hand-cut for my son. 
I'd always suspected there was another woman, but never ... another family. So. Two weeks ago Sunday, I followed him. He, uh, dropped off his rental car and walked to some apartment building. Then he changed his clothes, and got into a nicer car, and drove out to Henderson.
He made a fool out of me. A mockery of our life.
That was never my intention. That bomb was supposed to go off at 8:30 on his way to the airport.
It, it's not much harder to make a bomb than a volcano.

I only noticed 'cause she got up during the best part of the movie, right before the gunfight.
Yeah. I mean it's not THX surround-sound. This was 1950 and mono optical track.  I like how loud this theater keeps it.
I drove forty minutes to see this flick; my eyes were on the screen, but, uh, she was tall, not old ... a redhead.
No. And, uh ... 
I-I don't see her here.
If you ask me, anybody who leaves their phone on in a movie deserves to get stabbed in the head.

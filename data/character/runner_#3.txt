For the last six years, I ran the toughest leg of the relay ... against the same guy from SES.
Yeah, this cocky kid shows up.
Typical SES, all mouth.
Ignored him.
Hey, I was here to race. He cold-cocked me. I never threw a punch.
I'm SWAT. I subdued him.
Knock yourself out. Not going to find any blood on it.

Look, it was an accident. All right, Travis came over one night, said he wanted to buy a knife.
So I gave him a knife. He said he couldn't pay. He tried to run.
Wasn't moving, he was just lying there, knife stuck in him.
Like I told you, it was an accident.
If you talk to my mother like that again, I'll kill you.
I'll kill both of you.

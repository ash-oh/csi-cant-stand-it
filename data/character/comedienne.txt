Okay, so you know the thing that drives me crazy about men? You know how they take the toilet paper and then they put it up on top of the holder.
What is that? Do they not see that? Are they just busy looking at their underwear on the floor?
I got a nickname for my man. I call him Mr. Drop-and-stay, 'cause if he drops it, man, it just stays there.
God, uh, ooh, well, and that's my time. Uh, you've been fourteen quiet people, six empty tables, and I'll see you in hell.

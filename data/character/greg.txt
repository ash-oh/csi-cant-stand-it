Oh, don't touch it. That's my pot!
Yeah, you know, from my own private stash.  Blue Hawaiian -- $40 a pound. Only grown a couple times a year on the Big Island hand-picked to perfection.
Oh, is that alcohol on a bug bite? That's like butter on burns, man. Wives' tale.
It worked, didn't it?
Well, with all due respect, sir, it's not a baked potato. It's Braun's blood and with all the impurities in his system it might take a little extra time.
Did I ever tell you I used to live in New York?
Excuse me. You know, heroin has a nine-minute half-life. After that, it metabolizes into morphine.
A hundred fifty-eight  micrograms per liter. Again, not lethal. There's addicts walking around times square with more drugs in their system.
Oh, I was just going to tell you about another way to take heroin -- a suppository up the coolee. You just stand on your head, and then you let gravity ... 
... forget it.
There. Well, maybe not. The earring back -- not Janine's. But it was in the ear of a female.
What about black flag?
Process. Just because you got passed over, don't take it out on me.
Really? What would you call it, then?
Ah. 
Coal.
Wood.
And ... coconut shells.
Well, I think I hear some coffee perking.
First, I have the saliva sample taken from captain Brass's badge. Better known as Ellie's DNA. Take a good look at her markers. Second, blood sample from Jim Brass.
From parent to child seven of thirteen markers should match up minimum. In this case there's not a single marker in common. I don't have Ellie's mother's DNA on file but my guess is ... 
Not Brass's, not Ellie's. 
No, or her boyfriend Keith Driscoll. You still got a shooter out there.
Well, because I deal in DNA. The smallest sliver of epidermal tissue.
Scalp skin. Itchy. Can be embarrassing in social situations especially if one is wearing a dark shirt.
Good chance whoever moved the guy into the elevator ...
Hey, Catherine? Do you think Sara would ever go out with me?
So I was thinking. Maybe we could take our break at the same time.
Really.
Well, without the DNA sample from the hotel guy this test is pretty useless.
Well, just like the bra, I'm going to need a reference of her DNA in order to do anything, and that's not going to happen until ...
What?
Stripes.
Sara! I was just looking for you. Still up for break?
Uh ... inside-outside we're still looking for a reference for comparison but the epidermals are looking promising.
Sara and I were just going out for dinner.
Oh. Right.
That's the sample Catherine pulled off of the secretary's blouse and the hotel man's clothes -- same source.
Hey. I was just printing something out for you ... on your hot case.
Yeah, I ... I was... on break, had some time ... thought ... hey ...
Sorry, I drew a blank on the wife.
If you're here about the blood on Joan Marks' shoe, I already told Sara. I'm backed up.
Oh. Well, on that, I got an ID. 
Nope, but I ran a DNA profile on both victims. What do all sisters have in common? DNA.
So, did I solve the case?
So you got this water from a radiator?
Well, it ain't no Rocky Mountain Spring.
Nasty sodium count. Potassium, phosphorus.
You've got that look. What did I say right?
Well, that's impossible. The amelogenin on the follicle came back xx-- female.
That would work.
Is this the car the guy was killed in?
Now you know how I feel, like ten times a day. So what's this Millander guy's thing?
Hmm ... Pep boys receipt? Dry cleaning tags?
So what kind of paper item would you she into the center console in the heat of summer? 
When you say jump I say how high? I found testosterone in female hair. Post pubescent female hair.
Well, this is. This testosterone's endogenous.
Injections. Supplements.
Or increase her s*x drive.  You know women do that. I read. None that I've ever met.
No, you were right. The substance is microcil-like but it's really old-school-- alginate. The book says that, uh ... makeup people used it up to the '70s to make molds and impressions. It's green, hence the algin in alginate.
The guy's pretty shrewd. 
Every murder comes back to a dead man.
Got it.
Processing it next, sir.
Okay. The hair you found in Pauline Millander's bedroom two x chromosomes-- female.
Well, Sara had me compare it to the hair found in the tub at the crime scene. They're a perfect match.  DNA identical.
Well ... not exactly. 
The blood's female. Definitely not Logan's.
The blood from the finger was diluted due to the ice. But I made a positive match.
So it was kind of like Getty's ear? They cut it off, sent it to the house?
Did you guys clean the table before putting the curtain on it?
'Cause I think your evidence got contaminated.
Oleic acid. Goes well with jelly.
Kind of feels like blackjack, you know? You guys all fanned around the table, holding your breath waiting to see which card I'll reveal next.
Right. Sorry. So, I have DNA samples from every male that lives with Jody Bradley full-time or weekends. First, I have Mike Kimble, the fiancé. Dead fiancé.
Sorry, Captain.
DNA takes a pair.
Third and last.
Just getting into the mind of a potential killer.
In a minute. First things first -- your contact lens was worn by a near-sighted person. And since I was born with perfect eyesight I'm experimenting with what it would feel like to be near-sighted.
Give me some credit. Borrowing a pair of lenses from Archie in A/V. Giving me a headache, though.
The GSMS does not kid around.
Uh, your sample's 91.
What's wrong with it?
It's clean. Television, couch. What else does a guy need?
Any blood?
I was captain of the high school chess squad.
Then why is there a World Chess Champion?
Well, s*x is physical. Is that a sport?
You know, I had a roommate in college freshman year, from Edmonton, went on to play for the Swedish Elite league. Anyways, he set his blade at half an inch, tops. And I should know, because he made me get them sharpened.
Well, that's as sharp as it gets. 
It's a tough blade to skate on. We're talking Wayne Gretzky style 
She's a liar, and a mother.
Yep.
Well, first I tested for the presence of shellfish -- crustacean free. And then I figured if she's hiding that what else is she hiding?
There was blood in the sample. Not uncommon in early pregnancy. Women get mucosal tears in their esophagus because they yak so much. So, I tested the blood for the presence of human choriogonadotropins. She is definitely with child. 
Catherine ... you seen any guys with a broken tooth lately?
Yeah, well, one of them is your suspect.
Oh, that tooth that you found at the bottom of the snow pile ... 
To the nasty-ass toenail that Sara found.
No, it belongs to a live guy.
Gold.
Hey. Got here as soon as I could.
All hands on deck. That was the call, right? Crims on the scene.
Come on. I'm capable.
No.
Oh, I feel bad. I just froze up.
I guess I just wasn't expecting blood to look like that. Pre-collection, so different.
How do you deal?
Anybody check the bus?
Just out of curiosity, what are the unobvious spots?
Yeah.
I get the picture.
Sorry.
Hey, boss. I had a feeling you were coming. I ran the DNA on that whiskey bottle. You'll never guess. It's not the bus driver but I do have an answer behind door number two. Seat number 1C. 
You heard about it, too?
That I ... messed up.
Well, then ... I enjoyed it fine.
I thought I told you I'd page you with the results.
Wrong question.
I took a snip, ran a crossed immuno-electrophoresis.
Didn't pass.
This is Pink. Pink, this is Warrick.
Do you know how hot you are? Ssss!
Yeah?
How mad is he?
Heard you were looking for me?
What's up?
Okay. But, I mean, you are the one who's doing the Forensic Spotlight in the department newsletter.
Cool.
So, uh, what are you fuming?
Did she die of suffocation?
Cheese. Milk. Sweaters. What do these things have in common?
Ding, ding, ding. Fibers from the lady shrink, fibers from the boy. Both are angora.
Mm-hmm.
I think I smell something burning in the DNA lab. Love to stay and chat, but ...
I wouldn't break out that champagne just yet. Don't go shooting the messenger. Thumbprint from the nail.
FYI. Thirty swabs in six hours? Not realistic, all right? Even for me.
Lots and lots of epithelials. There were skin cells shed all over the blanket.
You're two-thirds of the way there. I also isolated a set of cells from another individual. Identity unknown. But when it's important to Nick here, I push further. Seven of the 13 markers matched your dead kid.
Yeah, your case just entered a whole new dimension of weird.
You smell like death.
You know ... a real man wouldn't mind.
DNA results, um ... sixteen samples from the apartment walls and the one we just took from the guy's arm.
Hey, I always double-check your stuff. But all the results are pointing one way.
That is my next run. Just a little backlogged.
Oh, not necessarily. Sample from the nosebleed's lamp. It's not his blood. And I don't know whose blood it is but the amelogenin came back with something pretty interesting: XX.
Mm-hmm.
No. I heard about your case. Sounds interesting.
Bet it's liquid dishwashing soap.
Well, you know I used to do a little diving myself actually. Belize, Maui, Great Barrier Reef ... Okay, maybe I took that one a little too far. But the point is, that these rubber suits aren't very easy to put on. Neoprene and skin need a little romance to get together. And a capful of liquid soap works like a charm.
So, you check this safety valve?
And what about the pressure gauge?
It's 3,000 psi; that tank was full.
Yeah?
How?
Bags under the eyes, coffee cups, stress face. Any of this look familiar? I'm working on it.
No. I'm working on your case -- with Nick.
Excuse me.
Silphid beetle -- test for presence of human DNA.
Yes, sir.
Hey, yo, Cat ...
Sorry. Um, I've got a full profile on our -- your torch. I pulled his DNA off of a cigarette butt. Lucky for us, he's a wet-lipped smoker.
Just get me something we can compare it to.
Blood from Jennings's denim shirt.
It means None Detected. The dry cleaning baked in the blood and it also degraded it to a degree that I just can't get a result.
I have tried. It's chemically impossible, Sara. Nothing from nothing is nothing.
You think Einstein had people hovering over his shoulders all the time? If he did, do you think that we'd be walking around with e=mc squared t-shirts?
Would you step back? Just give me some breathing room?
Maybe I'll tell you something about the silver sliver that Grissom found on sandbox girl's back.
Let's see what the library has to say.
Tempered steel with aluminum coating.
If she was, she was wearing something pretty funky.
Yeah, in a matter of speaking. Remember that sparkly stuff that Grissom got off her body?
I broke it down -- tree sap, ammonia and water.
Liquid latex.
Really? It's all the craze right now, man. Girls paint it on guys. Guys paint it on girls. You can paint it on yourself if you want if that's what you're into. You can't get a date.
Like I would know.
None of which have been washed.
You know what a switch is?
Oh, he's even got the lingo down.
You're so dialed into this case, I'll bet you don't need me to tell you which mask had her DNA.
You can't get any air through pens.
I found the victim's DNA on this mask and ... these two straws. Red mark: Victim; blue mark :... 
Dude, I rip.
Surfing's just a state of mind. 
Oh, relax, bro. The gc mass spec's working on it. Should be done, um ... 
... now.
Transmission fluid.
So?
Congratulations--you're looking for a Ford with a leak.
Which means it can't get very far.
Grissom ...  I need you, ASAP. Please.
So, ballistics sent me a bullet from the casino. It's a .45 so we know it came from one of the ladies' guns.
No, but there was a foreign substance adhered to it.
Not exactly.
Tomato, to-mah-to, potato...
You bet. Strange, huh?
Real-life fairy dust. 
S-I ... O-2. Silica dust. Each particle's a hundred times smaller than a grain of sand.
What don't you know?
Normally I don't like to speak ill of the dead but, uh, Mr. Newman's sperm had company. Bad company.
Look at D-7. Three alleles.
Which can only mean one thing -- menage d'allele.
Percentage is too high. We're looking at a minor and a major sample.
The husband.
Nope.
Ibid. Major donor is still unaccounted for.
Driving someone else's porcelain bus?
The coroner left this in your mail slot.
Uh, Caesar salad. 
Oh, and Pele used an interesting dressing. PCP.
Well, it acts like one. But PCP's such a powerful drug it's in a class all its own: Disassociative anesthetic.
Yeah, after it takes you through the paces.
Uh ... twenty. Dude's dose was off the charts. I'm surprised he's still alive. 
Well, it's raw ... and it's definitely skin.
Hey, heard you nailed soccer boy for the murder.
Well, maybe there was someone else with them.
Yeah?
See, now we're getting into this whole strip forensics thing and I'm not so sure I can hang with that even if you are my boss.
Yeah. And you know, my grandfather got tossed from Norway for getting my grandmother pregnant before they got married. To this day, he still tells me som man reder sa ligger man.
One must lie in the bed one has made.
Now, you're sure you want me to do this? Things could get loud in here.
So you want to tell me why we're doing this? GRISSOM: It's an experiment. 
What did you do to me?
I'm Hazmat meat. Quarantine, here I come.
Yeah, well, I'm not worried about the right foot.
Oh, great. It's probably fatal.
You infected me with mildew?

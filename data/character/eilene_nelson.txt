I thought my husband answered all your questions.
I know what they look like. 
Well, I would hope that I'm not like most people. Is there a point to this?
I did. Is there a problem?
Do you have a warrant?
The truth is I lost it on a business trip. I'm waiting to find out from the hotel if they found it.
I'm a corporate litigator. It's going to take a lot more than that to rattle my cage.
No.
That's a big leap. Lost watch to a DNA request. I think we're done here.
You again. I thought you people would've gotten the message.
Is this some kind of joke? This is limited to my watch box.
Cameron, go see what Dylan needs. 
I think my watch box is in my glove compartment.
This qualifies as a harassment suit.
What?
As my husband's attorney, I'm advising him not to speak with you.
Shut up, Cameron. I'll handle this.
I'm looking out for our family. I'm the only one who's qualified.
Cameron ...
No! No water, no gum, no anything. If you think you can trick him into giving you some DNA, you're mistaken.
What is that supposed to mean? 
Why would he do that?
My watch.
Cameron, be quiet! If this is all you have, I am ... happy to go to trial.
Where are you going?

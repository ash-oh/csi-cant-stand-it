Of course. He's one of my closest friends.
Excuse me. What?
No. It's just. Uh ... last week we were playing toss with a ball.
There was glass everywhere, so I knocked out the loose pieces.
That he was a hairy SOB? Yeah. Of course. Why?
He's a friendly, quiet guy. I've known him since high school. He's been dating my sister. Oh, God. She doesn't know yet, does she?
Yeah.
She's at my parents, in Pahrump. Her cell phone's probably out of range.
Sure. But if it's okay, I'd ... I should break the news to her in person.
Freak.
What's going on?
Why would I kill my best friend?
Hayden was going to marry my sister.
I couldn't let that happen. He was diseased. Wasn't a problem for me. But my sister deserved better.
Did you see his body? Hayden was a monster passing for a regular Joe. My parents blamed me for introducing them. You know, the werewolf disease, it's hereditary. It means my sister could've given birth to freaks.
Figured it was appropriate.
Yeah.
I did the right thing. My sister's out there waiting. Since I confessed, can I at least go out and talk to her? Explain why I did it.

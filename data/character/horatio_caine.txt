Sasha?!
Sasha. My name is Horatio Caine. I'm the head of the crime unit.
Yeah. Yeah, that's real.
I know that.  I knew that.
Me, too. Me, too. What do you say we sit here and get found together?
What a day.
I got a female in distress. I want the APB to extend the whole state.
Good.
Horatio Caine.
Caine.
Child services has sent a doctor out.
Okay, I didn't say he processed her. I just said he was here.
You sure about that?
Not yet.
Okay, I found her right in here. 
And ... this is the young lady right over here.
It's okay.
I bet it felt cold when you picked it up.
Hmm.
You're too smart for that.
I think that's a fair description.
He was coming home to Miami. 
How'd the little girl get away?
And why did he pick such a secluded area?
Or take a leak. Maybe that's why he stopped the car here... to take a leak.
Let me ask you another question: When you're home alone do you lock the bathroom door?
Sure you do. We all do. It's human nature to avoid being vulnerable, isn't it? So, if that's the case then he would look for a tree to shield himself, wouldn't he? 
So Then the question becomes, how far along this path before he loses sight of them?
Look at this. Bang. Footprints ... and this is urine. 
But if we get his DNA, there's a chance we'll get him.
Yeah. Caine. What do you mean FBI?
That is a good question.
And you talked to him?
Do they have an ID yet?
That's it?
Of course there is.
Dennis ... Dennis ... tick-tock, Dennis. While you're waiting to get your ducks in a row the guy with the Miami link just slipped through my hands.
I need answers for this little girl. Her father's just been killed, maybe her mother, too. And that's your fault. You understand that.
Dennis, you don't give me this link, I will make this very personal.
Here? This hotel?
Mm, I wish I would have known that. Maybe they'd still be alive. Yeah?
si ... vamos. 
I had a bad feeling about this.
She just said that you need to learn the language. 
I got you.
Guys ... please?
That her?
Our guy's still in the wind, folks. Still in the wind.
The substance is water-soluble.
Hey.
So, how's your colleague Grissom doing on the aroma angle?
Smart man. I just wanted to show you something. The sticky substance we got off the wife is, in fact, honey.
Well, honey on its own is just honey, but when you add plastic wrap, it's ... a different situation.
Yep. 
Wish me luck.
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Hi
Really? I'm partial to the swab myself.
Coming, dear.
I was there opening night.
I was, uh ... VIP.
What is this?
Where'd you get that?
Okay, let's swap this out. I want you to take a look at this.
We got this off the chief's wife.
It's a match.
Wouldn't it have been easier to put these in order? This is going to take forever.
Let me see that.
My people tell me that a customer came in here two nights ago to buy some.
Did this Gordon tell you who he had in back of his car?
How'd you find him?
Nice work. You got a last name, Gordon?
Well, the Corwins are going to have to wait.
Remember what he was drinking? Was it sweet like irish whiskey?
Hmm. Smell that?
Ask him what medication you would take for that.
Lucky for us we found blood in his urine.
And prescribed. Right over here. It's our database.
Okay, what we're looking for is a patient who's purchased synthetic insulin in the last 48 hours.
Here we go.
That's him. And the reason that old Gordon probably didn't smell when we picked him up is because he'd just taken his insulin, hadn't he?
Yes, take a look at this address. A limousine driver with a house on the water in Coconut Grove? I don't think so.
Let's check it.
That's right. 
And when they're away at some posh resort he moves into their house, doesn't he?
mm-hmm.
And when the Corwins come home ... not good.
Miami-Dade police!
Slowly. 
Slowly.
Then dragged her in here and cornered her like an animal.
But what's your point?
Speed, get on that thing right now. Put the birds in the air and call the coast guard. Right now. Do it.
Commandeered by one Gordon Daimler. Gordon Daimler.
... Gordon Daimler.
Speed?
I'm not sure.
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Don't the Corwins have a jet? 
The Corwins have a jet, right?! Gordon left them here to die. 
Abort this, Sackheim! Abort this!
Stand down!
Detweiler, I know you want to impress your boss but there's an innocent man on that boat. Now, if you take this shot I'm going to be in your grille for the rest of your natural life. I want you to think about what that might be like. 
Think about that.
Speed, the Corwins have a jet find the jet. Call the FAA and ground the jet by authority of ...
... Miami-Dade County.
Then send backup!
Mr. Corwin!
Get me fire rescue.
Good evening. Mr. Van Der Welk.
I'd rather call Dylan at the hospital to confirm.
You're not rich, Gordon.
I'm going to, uh ... I'm going to book this guy. You want to go with?
Sounds good. Sounds good.
Uh ... thank you for your help on this.
Right.
You take care of yourself.
Hey.
Well, your aunt is flying in to talk to you.
I lost someone once.
Well ... 
Still do. Still do.
Sasha .... people are going to say a lot of things about your mom and dad and some of them are going to be true, but what I want you to remember is that they fought like heroes for you. Will you remember that for me?
Good. Good for you.

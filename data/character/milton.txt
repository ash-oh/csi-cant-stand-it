Hey, Sheriff! 
Di-Did you hear about my wife? Somebody shot my wife. Yeah, I'm telling ya, they shot my wife.
Hey! 
You kids, you caught your, caught your guy?
You going to catch him?
Well, think this might be of some help? 
I told you, somebody shot my wife. Come in. I'll show you. 
I told 'em. I told 'em, but would they listen? No, no, just an old man running off at the mouth.
No. Woke up this morning and found it like that.
That's Longfellow.  What do you kids know 'bout poetry? 
Even an idiot could see that.

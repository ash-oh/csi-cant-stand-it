Yes.
Why don't you come inside. Please.
He was my dentist. That's terrible. He'd asked me to go to the movies, and I said yes, but ... it was a late show, and I had to get up early for work.
I was screening. I figured he'd get my message.
I felt bad standing him up. I called to apologize. I figured I'd get his voice mail, but when I didn't, I tried again.
Yes.
Why?
Sure. I love old movies.
I prefer French new wave. If you'll excuse me now, I have to go to work.

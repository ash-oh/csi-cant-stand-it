Sweet red Ferrari. F-360 Spyder.
Last night-- I brought the car when they left. Around 8:15. They're gone a couple hours. The car - pfft -- was amazing.
No.
Uh, a little after ten. The guy gave me a Benjamin. I kept an eye out on that baby, I didn't want any of these other maniacs putting their paws on it.
I don't think so.
I'll say this, if she was hooking, then she was top shelf, just like that car. I felt kind of like that garage guy in Ferris Bueller's Day Off? You know, he likes the car so much, he takes it out for a spin for, like, the whole day. Not that I'd ever do that.
Whoa, look, I had nothing to do with the damage on that car.
I mean, it was pristine before they took it out.
Look, any scratch on that beauty is a tragedy and this was, like, a dent. You know what? They looked like they didn't even care. Anything else I can do for you?
Lenny. Lenny Andretti. No relation.

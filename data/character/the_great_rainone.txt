So how do you feel today, Chloe?
Well there, what's the matter, doll face?
A hobo? Well, now you know what that stands for don't ya? That stands for homeward bound.
Well now, that's silly. Chloe, everybody's got a home. Where do you live?
In a box?
A pain in your sawdust?
Yeah, that was my other daughter.
Well, my folks were in vaudeville. It wasn't hard until my wife passed away. Natalie was six and Chloe was four. It was, um, pepper and salt. Darkness and light. Within the year, my whole family was just ... poof. Gone.
Sure, sweetheart.
Hey, Chloe. Love you, baby.
Chloe. Oh, my God! Chloe! 
Chloe would never fight.
I don't know. It was hard on both of us. 
I tried for a while, but I just couldn't handle it. I had to give her up.

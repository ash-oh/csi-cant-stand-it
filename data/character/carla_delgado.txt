This morning everything was fine. Then some pendejo attacks my brother and we're out god knows how much money and now I'm stuck running this place alone.
Upset? Upset is for white people, lady. I'm pissed off. My brother was just shot in the thigh, okay? That's awful close to serious if you know what I'm saying.

You better have insurance. You take 15% of a man's paycheck just to cash it. People use us, but they don't like us.

Hector's my husband, but I hope you keep him in jail a long time. 
What? 
You self-righteous b*st*rd. You stand there and bad-mouth my husband while you're robbing me behind my back?
You going to arrest his ass?

I don't think so.
No.
I had a cold, so I stayed in my room and I read Pride and Prejudice.  I have a big fat crush on Mr. Darcy.
I mean, I didn't have nothing against him.
What pissed me off, he started coming around, and he just stopped paying for it.
Doris, uh ... she had a little thing for Mr. Happy, if you know what I mean.
I don't know.
Stars shining bright above you, night breezes seem to whisper I love you, birds singing in the sycamore tree, dream a little dream of me. 
My daddy gave me that name 'cause he liked that song. BRASS:  Happy was hit in the head with a crowbar we found in your room. You wiped off your fingerprints, but you didn't wipe off his blood from the grooves.
He was always ... coming up to my room, getting all up on me. He liked them other girls, but he was obsessed with me. Look, look what he did. 
He punched me right there in the ribs just for fun. Stupid. 
Then he flipped me over and then he started punching me back here. Every night, drunk, crazy, messed up--whether he could get it up or not.
Last night I was just about to take my week off to bleed, and I wasn't in the mood.
So yeah ...
... I hit him.
So what? He deserved it. It didn't even drop him. He just wandered off.
I just explained to you ...
I know, but I didn't ...
He came over ...
I killed him?
I killed him!
Okay.
Really?
Oh, that's great. That's like I told you. So can I go now?
Well ... yeah, okay.
Huh.
A snake bite. Isn't that a hoot?
You know, there's a bunch of those rattlers all up over those hills. I bet he just ...
I don't know nothing about that.
He-he blamed ... he blamed it on me?
Mm ... Connor would never say that. He was in love with me.
No. Connor ain't that smart. It was my idea.
My daddy was a serpent-handling preacher. My people all had the holy fire. I had it, too, but mine came from below.
I caught and milked that rattler.
Come on. DREAMA LITTLE: Put it in.
That's okay. Shh. Go back sleep.
It's okay.  Two holes.
Two holes.

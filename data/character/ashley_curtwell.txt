My parents died in a car accident four years ago.
Yeah.
He goes away a lot.
I was on my way to the mall to get something to eat. I always cut through the construction site.
My brother tells me not to, but it saves me, like, ten minutes.
Well, this guy from school, Brian, comes out of nowhere.
Yeah. It's, um ... Haddick. We were in homeroom together freshman year. 
So, anyway, he says his cat ran away ... and will I help him find it.
A cat. I'm so stupid.
So, we walked into the house ...
What color is he?
Here, kitty, kitty.
It was like the more I shouted, the more he liked it.
No!
He was all over me. I just had to get him off me.
What? I bought that stuff? All I remember is getting new clothes and going home. Why does all this bad stuff keep happening to my family?
Let's do it!
He goes away almost every weekend.
Before he went straight, we were buds, but then he got too good for us, but he wasn't too good to want to get with this.
Stop.
Get him!
Get him!
Of course. It's what I was counting on.
Good luck. I dress up real nice -- couple barrettes, little lace collar, two dead parents. I'll be the saddest little girl in the world.

You told me to go home and look around. That's what I did. My ex took 'em.
He doesn't care about Lucas. He barely uses his visitation, and then, six months ago, I don't know, he-he got into some kind of trouble. He started coming around when Lucas was home alone. He'd gone through my mail, my checkbook. He-He stole our TVs.
So I told Lucas that he couldn't be home alone anymore, and I took his key.
I made arrangements with Jason's grandpa. The hide-a-key is for emergencies only.
Lucas ... Lucas always drops his book bag in the hallway and turns on the TV. I bought him a new one. I'm positive he didn't come home.
225-IHG.
Yeah, well, he moves around a lot. Practically lives out of his car. He ... He runs a stripper circuit on I-15.
No. Why? 
Lucas knows better than that. You don't talk to strangers.
Oh! Oh, God!
Oh, God, no!

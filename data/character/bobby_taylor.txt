I've never filed a missing person's report before but I'm getting concerned about Eric.
After work, we went out.
No. A few blocks apart. I'm over at Voosh's, you know? Voosh's fireworks. And he's at Element Sound, the music store.
Yeah. A party out near red rock. How did you know?
We, uh, drank a couple beers hung out, and ... then I just lost track of him around midnight and I haven't seen him since.
No. No way. Look, do you ... do you know where Eric is or not?
Oh, god ... what happened to you, Eric? Oh, god ...
The guy said it was natural -- that it wasn't a drug. I mean, jimsonweed is a plant.
Yeah, but he said it was safe. That's why we bought it.
Yeah. We both did. You drink it. It's a tea.
He didn't give a name. He just ... he told us that j-weed would be a cool high. Mind-expanding. I mean, that's the whole point of a rave is to experiment.
Yeah. But that was, like, four days ago.
Definitely.
It's gonna be
There.
That's him, there! That's the dealer!
You killed my friend!
Yeah, uh, spider bite. I think it's infected.
Sure. You're a doctor. 
You might be able to give me something for it.
I'm telling you, I didn't kill Eric.
Cheers, man.
Ph-photo what?
I loved that guy.
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up! Shut up! BOBBY TAYLOR: Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up! Shut... shut up!
Shut up ...
I just ... I-I can't remember, honest.
I don't think I would do that.
Shut up! Shut up! BOBBY TAYLOR: Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up. Shut up.
Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!
It doesn't matter. 
You don't understand. I don't care what happens to me. I killed my best friend.

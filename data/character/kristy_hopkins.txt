I don't know what happened. I remember this song that was playing on the radio. I just don't remember passing out.
What?
Ahhh ...
You wanna give me 20 bucks?
You want to give me twenty bucks?
Oh, Nick, hey ...
Oh, you probably don't recognize me with the shorter hair. My nipples are all better, you want to see?
No, I'm in here, minding my own business shopping for a dress spending my hard-earned money!  Okay, semi-hard-earned money. When Squiggy over here starts harassing me saying he doesn't want my type in here. He grabs my arm, cops a feel then he spit on me, so I slugged him!
Oh, I'll show you ...
What?!
Why is it every time we meet you're wanting me to take my clothes off?
That's-that's very, very interesting.
No. 
Great.  
I'd invite you out for coffee, it's probably a bad idea, huh?
Yeah. But I can call you sometime, you know just in case I ever get into trouble or something.
I owe you two.
Get your hands off me! Let go of me. You don't own me. Nobody does.
You don't own me, Jack. 
Nobody does.
Nick. 
I know him. He's a cop.
Nick, tell him to leave me alone.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. That was good timing. Thanks.
Do you mind?
Thanks.
Seems like every time we run into each other I'm getting into trouble.
Not every john is like that guy. Besides, I'm making a change. I'm going back to school.
I've always wanted to study communications. I'm good with people.
You think so?
Well, I'm going to go inside now. 
Come on. Just 'cause you're a crime scene analyst you don't have to analyze everything.

I'm ... Kenny Berlin. That's my brother. I'm the one who found him.
I don't ... I don't know. I came... I came walking in the door, I saw my brother lying there ... stuff everywhere. All I could think was that ...
Hey, Jeff?
I-I called 9-1-1
... and then you guys showed up, and...
What are you doing?
What blood? Am I a suspect?
Right here?
You found what on my pants?
Well, it's just a guess but someone broke into my car last weekend and smashed my window and made off with my CD player. So I must've been wearing those pants.
No, but you can check with my insurance company.
No.
Sorry. I was never very good at science.
Look, it's like I told you. I walked in the house ...
... and I thought ...
They're coming back, and they're going to kill me, too.
I heard a noise, and I walked to the window.
That must be when I got the glass in my pants.
Look, somebody really did break into my car, okay? And I just remembered all that stuff just now. So, am I in trouble?
I'm a day trader.
That's two questions.
Yeah, you can.
That's crazy. I loved my brother.
Based on what?
What evidence?!
No.
I didn't use anything. I didn't do it.  I want a lawyer.
Do you have any idea how much money I've lost?
Come on! $20,000? That doesn't even begin to solve my problems!

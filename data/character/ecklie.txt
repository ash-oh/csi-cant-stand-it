Take these people into the lobby and get their statements.
Sanders, if the former mayor was gonna stage his own assassination, I would've known about it.
The guard got himself killed over this?
Yeah, what are they?
Did she happen to explain why Monique was running around wearing Vinnie's clothes?
So what do we have, Doc?
So we're still not even sure of his name.
He's got dark hair.
That's not our guy. Let him go.
And give engineering an all clear.
If Briscoe and his brother really are the one's behind these murders, catch them.
Agent Parker, you blindsided me on this.
Sara.
Grissom.
Gil, we could really use some insight on Lady Heather.
When was the last time you spoke with her?
Sara, your warrant came in.
Okay, okay, one more, one more.
Congratulations, Brown. You just bounced off the glass ceiling.
Brass buys his daughter a get out of jail free card and her boyfriend ends up on a gurney. Good call.
I'm dedicated.
Pictures get lost, Warrick. I do remember that glove, though. Kelso's blood was all over it.
Grissom.
We have a situation, Gil. Preston Breckman who's on trial for the murder of Joanna Whitson.
You would think. 
We got the right guy.
Defense has called entomologist Mark Thayer as an expert witness.
He's gonna say that the insect activity on the body proves defendant was out of town at the time of the murder.
Gil, we need you to listen to his testimony. Prosecution may need your assistance on cross.
Is that true?
Defendant was in Mexico 'til November 3. We think he killed her on the fourth.
How is it going?
Great. That discounts Thayer's testimony and puts Breckman in Vegas at the time of the homicide.
And jurors might be more receptive to video documentation than books.
Well, there's no doubt in my mind that Thayer worked his science to get the answers the defense needed. We just need to know how he did it. Could he have altered one of the variables?
Can you conduct your own experiment?
Well, we know that's not gonna happen.

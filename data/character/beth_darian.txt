I've heard enough.
I do. Walter was killed in police custody.
Was that how he touched your life?
I don't care how he died. I'm just relieved that it's over.
Walter hurt a lot of people. If you had something he wanted, he just took it. And if you got in his way ... I always kept my distance.
... hot to the touch? He was always that way, ever since we were kids.
Always knew that Walter would end up in jail or dead.  I'm sorry.
Well, I moved to Henderson to get away from Walter. I stayed out of his life, hoping he'd stay out of mine. Didn't matter that I was his sister. He treated me like he did everybody else.
No. Who is she?
He killed her, didn't he?
Oh, I wonder what she did to set him off.
He could always find an excuse for anything that he did.
No. It makes me really uncomfortable talking about Walter.
No, that was, uh ... an accident on the job many, many years ago.
Nobody's called me that in years. How did you know?
I, I had that job for one day. I was a lousy waitress. Why would he keep that?
Hey, baby. 
Why don't you take your stuff and put it in your room? I'll make you a snack.
He's going to be nine next month.
I'm the only mother he's ever known. I raised him; I had to.
Walter said that the mother was a runaway, and that she didn't want the baby. I took him in. I love him.
I don't know.
I'm not like Walter. When I opened the suitcase, and I saw the photograph ... I didn't want the father to suffer. 
I took it back. I didn't want it around me. I knew that he would never notice. 
Giving me Martin ... was the only good thing that Walter ever did. I don't know why he did it. But it wasn't out of the goodness of his heart.

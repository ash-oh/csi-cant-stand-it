Knucklehead just blew the stop and ran right into the side of my car.
Didn't even try to stop! Just dropped off my partner -- otherwise I would've been sitting in that passenger seat.
No. I know better. Been to a couple of forensic classes taught by you lab guys. Reached in through the window to check his vitals -- he was dead. Paramedics pronounced; made sure no one touched anything.

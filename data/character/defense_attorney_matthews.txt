Mr. Brown, you stated that you found the knife in Mr. Fife's vehicle. Is that correct?
Why did you search his vehicle?
Mm-hmm. At what point did you secure the warrant to search Mr. Fife's vehicle?
Officer Watson never secured a warrant. 
Did you?
Your honor, the knife is a product of an unlawful search, and under NRS Chapter 179, we submit the knife and the towel be ruled inadmissible. Furthermore, all evidence acquired as a result of the seizure must at this time be excluded.
Detective, let me finish.
I want it on the record that my client has been advised not to take this meeting.
We've been through this before.
He's never been inside the victim's apartment.
You don't have to submit to this, Michael. Just say the word.
Detective Brass, if you were to make your case, we'd be back in court, not an interrogation room. Assuming without the knife, you have nothing to directly connect my client to the attack, in twelve hours, he's going to be getting his street clothes.
Why are you asking about a car wash?
The tenor of these questions leads me to believe the focus of your investigation has shifted. This conversation is over, Michael.

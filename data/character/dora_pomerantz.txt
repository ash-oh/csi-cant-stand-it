Who wants to know?
About what?
That was a very long time ago.
I was eighteen years old when I got pregnant. Charlie said he'd stay with me. Then he got drafted to Vietnam. Came home six months later ... in a box. These two chirping birds. Waa, waa, waa. I couldn't get them to stop. I couldn't take it. So one day I just ... Boop ... snapped. That was it. No more babies. I spent ten years in a state facility, you know?
Oh ... fine. A smart doctor put me in touch with an equine assisted therapy program. Saved my life. Horses don't have judgments. They have needs. Meet the needs, the horse is happy. Helped retrain my brain. 
Oh, no. Uh ... not recommended. Sometimes you just can't go back.
Who's Amanda?
We keep envelopes loose in a desk drawer. I must've touched it before she sent it.
The handwriting, it's Tiffany's.

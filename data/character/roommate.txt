You know, Daniel was from Green Bay. Big-time diehard football fan. He tried to walk-on here, but, uh ... didn't make the team. But, hey, come game night, he was always at the stadium.
He watched one game at home and lost all of his chill privileges. It was ugly.
Busted the couch, jumping on it. Neighbors called the cops 'cause he was so loud. He was a real bluto.
Can I help you?
Yeah ... look, whatever he did, I wasn't involved.
I-I don't know. A couple weeks ago.
Look, Tad's a third-year freshman. Or as he likes to call it, a three-peater. He disappears for weeks at a time.  What happened to him?
No, not exactly.
Look, I study my ass off. When Tad's here, he's baked for breakfast, lunch and dinner. He's distracting. He blares his music. He invites his friends over to party. He is ... or was ... inconsiderate. Fortunately, he wasn't around much.
Look, the guy was a pain in my ass, but everybody else seemed to love him. His dad's totally loaded, and tad was pretty generous.
I never noticed it.
Go ahead; take whatever you want. Look, there's this rumor going around campus that if your roommate dies, you get an automatic 4.0 for the semester. You know, because of all of the traumatic stress. Who ... who should I talk to about that?

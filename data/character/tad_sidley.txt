Okay, look, I may not like my old man, but he's not a killer. And if you think he is, go to the cops.
I'm sorry, okay? I'm sorry. I can't just ...
Look, I see my dad once a month... when I pick up my check. He's not going to listen to me.
Yeah, me, too. Uh, he said you wanted to talk to me?
Tijuana, L.A., quick stop in Santa Barbara. Just got back this morning.
No. I'm sorry, I didn't even know it was missing. I'm-I'm not exactly big on the weights, you know? Look, uh ... I'm late for a movie. You mind if I get out of here?
Gonna ask me out?
Dad ...
Son of a bitch.
He's lying.
I have no idea what really happened. I met her once ... at the house. A month or so later, I see her on the news -- she's missing. I can tell you that for two weeks after that, he wouldn't let me anywhere near the house. Claimed that he was painting, and he didn't want me breathing in the fumes. 
He killed her. I'm sure of it.
Hi, Dad. I heard everything.
Yeah. I'm not dead. You're dead to me.

Hey, what's up, man?
Have you had any trick rolls lately?
I've had six pros come through the ER in the past two nights all with two distinct similarities. Every girl has been mysteriously knocked unconscious and we found some skin discoloration.
No, their nipples.
Which one of you is with Family Services?
Brenda's fine but I'd like her to have a consult. I've paged the psychiatric resident. Should be here within the hour.
Name's Walter Banglor. He'll live.
Subdural hematoma, compound rib fractures ...
I didn't say you couldn't see him. 
He's sedated. If you want to talk to him you're going to have to wait until he comes off his meds in about 12 to 24 hours.
Two minutes, understand?
He doesn't have a bad attitude, he has clostridium tetani.
I extracted this from the wound in his calf.
Bacteria on the staple got into the bloodstream, releasing toxins that enabled muscular contractions. That's why they call it lockjaw. 
Take couple of days for the antibiotics to flush it out of his system.

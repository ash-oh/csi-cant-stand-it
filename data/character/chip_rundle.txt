Hey, no, I wasn't stealing the bag, all right?
Hey, look at the bag. It's not even leather. Why would I want it?
Why would I need a lawyer? Look, I told you I didn't know there was any money in that bag. Hit balls at that park twice a week. Ask around.
How does that mean I kidnapped his wife? I know the dude.
He pays extra for me to come to him.
Look, unless it was from Jack's vineyard, I don't know. Helped him move some crates couple weeks ago up to his garage. I can't believe it. Y-y-you got nothing to hold me on. Going once, going twice ... sold ... to the man walking out the front door.
My lawyer's number. In case you'd like to communicate with me again. 
Hey, didn't I see you on the news tonight -- the chopper-- you were digging up Jack's wife? It's amazing. Hope you catch the guy.
Stop me from taking the money -- she still dies.

Don't move.
No, no!
What?
I love you.
Put this on. 
A lot of it.
Switching cars -- covering our tracks. I got a jeep up over this hill.
Bring $2 million in hundreds to Charleston and Third in three hours or your wife dies. Stop me from taking the money, she still dies.

You think I'm selling body parts? Come on, you're wasting your time. I sell refurbished engines. I don't know jack about body parts.
I hired Ross to weld metal together. Even if I killed him -- not saying I did -- but if even if I did, I'd just burn the body as is, not re-pipe the guy. And I definitely wouldn't burn him at work. Fire station's a block away.
I was out before he even went in. I picked Ross up with a bunch of other guys looking for work outside that big hardware store on Herrick four days ago.
Four days ago. He'd been working nights.
You calling me a liar?
Ouch.

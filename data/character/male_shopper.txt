Would you happen to have a cigarette?
I've been trying to quit. Didn't want to buy a pack.
Non-filtered. The women I know smoke filtered-- you know those long, skinny cigarettes?
Guess it does. 
You got a light?
You live around here?
It's probably smart. I wouldn't tell me either. You're cute.
I'll give it back. Here.

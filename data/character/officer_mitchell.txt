Karl. Don't do anything stupid.
I got a 20 on Simon, right here.
Nine-millimeter.
Captain, we got press all over the place.
Where you headed?
Go on up.
This is Ryan Lansco's assigned parking spot. His drives a blue '72 Ford van. It's missing.
Doesn't look like transmission fluid.
No. I didn't even have a car.
Captain?
Neighbor gave this guy up. Mullins hangs out at a bar right down the street.
From the hood to the hills. Didn't take him long to spend the taxpayers' money.
Stokes, you ready for a cup of coffee?
Your call.
You all right, man? You all right?
Hey, Captain. He'll take care of you.
I think you should see this, cap.
We caught her trying to bring this into the building.
Yes, sir. Ma'am.
Put her in the car -- 
Been there twice. Still nobody home.
Sorry, son. This is a crime scene. You don't want to be in there.
Calm ... calm down.
Iris Paul?
Officer Mitchell, Las Vegas Police Department. Are you Derek's mother?
Florida.
Can you give me a description of Derek?
Kind of like that?
Gun on the seat.
He's clean.
Did you find something?
Grissom. All these guys know Dorsey. This is where he lives.
Richard Dorsey! Time to wake up. You're under arrest.
Meth head. No weapons. He's clean. All right, let's go.
Yeah.
You got it.
Sugar.
I'll tape the scene.

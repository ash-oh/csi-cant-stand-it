Sure. What are you into?
Lazarus Kane.
I don't know any Angela Sommerville.
She file a complaint against me?
Look, everything we did was consensual. It's not illegal to drink someone's blood. She was into it. That neonate ... she offered herself to me.
We had a drink together here.
What's this about?
No. Later on, I swung by her court and daggered the relationship.
For the past three months, she's been my donor.
No, it doesn't work like that. Daegonna belonged to me.
Well, under the right circumstances, I'll do just about anything.
Well, I don't know anything about that. See, I follow very strict guidelines: Black veil. Principle 11: You never mistreat your donors.
Yeah.
It's Daegonna's, okay? She gave it to me couple weeks ago. I offered to give it back, but she wanted me to keep it ... said her PSI belonged to me.
Life-force, blood. 
Knock yourself out.
Aw ... 
I will not be tied down.

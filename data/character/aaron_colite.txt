What's this about?
Right under the TV.
Look, I was cleared in that robbery years ago.
Yeah, I did. I killed it.
I killed it. Look, I was ... I was out hunting.
By the time I shot the bear, the guy was already dead.
Yeah, I do, actually.
I've been through the wringer with you guys once before. I figured a guy was dead. There was nothing I could do about it. I took off.
Look, I've got a hunting license with tags. I was out hunting deer. Tried to save a guy's life. That's it.
It ain't illegal to cut up a dead animal as long as it's already dead. That's the law.
For what?
Take a look. Wasn't me.
Rod, Rod, Rod, Rod!
Right there. You see him?
Yep, you got him.

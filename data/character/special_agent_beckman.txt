Warrick Brown? Special Agent Beckman, Treasury Department. You're subbing in tonight, right?
Wanted to be sure CSI's on the same page on this counterfeit case.
Our lab's going to want to analyze that money, too.
Did Sidle hold back information on this money?
They don't have any money in their bathing suits so you suspect them of a high-end counterfeit operation.
Just like real money.
Very high-end. The Duffys are major counterfeiters.
Our investigators tell me they're the Duffys from Las Vegas County. Orton's their assumed names.
As soon as you phoned me I went on a T-Department Database. They've each done time for interstate fraud. And, yes, high-end counterfeiting.
Access. So, what do you want to do with the money?
Thanks. I'll take it from here. Find their operation and shut it down.
Not really. But you're making me look good to my superiors so if you want to tag along ...
Suit yourself.
Heavy rag. Twenty-five percent  content. Makes for durability.
There is no money.
Congratulations, Sidle. You passed.
Duffy is their code alias. This is Special Agent Conners. This is Special Agent Tessari. We're all with service. Quality control.
We put bait money in the hands of bad people. In this case, a reputed con. Our directive is to see how the money leads to law enforcement. 
However, in light of unpredictable events this sting still upheld. It came to you, Sidle, and you didn't take. You should be very proud.
It never feels right when it works. Only feels wrong when it doesn't.

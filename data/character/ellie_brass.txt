Everyone I sleep with dies.
I slept with this sailor once when I was fourteen. He died overseas somewhere.
There was no relationship. I barely knew him.
He invited me for the weekend. I figured as long as he didn't chop me up I'd have some fun.
Mind if I smoke?
Man, I wish I knew what you were talking about.
I wasn't even there.
Home. In the bathroom.
I'm out of here.
As long as you're the one doing them.
I lent it to my boyfriend.
You know, you have this whole Lenny Kravitz thing going on. I'm not one for brothers, but ... damn.
Keith Driscoll.
Told you I was clean.
Boss?
Only if I eat. Releases gastric acids, blah, blah, blah...
Well, you see, the thing with me is I'm mind over matter. I can imagine a hamburger, and I'm full. Will you fill me up, Warrick?
Are they arresting me? 
I have a place. 
Keith and I do. We share everything.
No, I'm not.
How'd you find me?
It's true.
No, dad. I was never there. Never.
Dad, it's way too late. I got to catch a flight to Jersey. Midnight. Mom says that I can stay with her for awhile.
Thanks. I'm taking the shuttle.

Thank you for visiting Sunny Side's. Next in line, please.
Would you like to try the Sunny Side's special?
Um ... 
Are you a truant officer?
Yeah.
Oh, my god. That's the creep who was hitting on me. He was so repulsive. You know what he said to me?
And he said it in front of his kid. What kind of father acts like that?
Oh, he did. I hope you're going to arrest him.
I get all the creeps in drive-through -- teenagers, perverts, walk-ups, and those are my favorites. Hi, I'm on a skateboard. Can I have a burger combo? No, dork.
Oh, yeah, we have cameras all over here. Even in the cooler.

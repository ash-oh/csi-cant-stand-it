Captain Brass, I am simply here representing the interests of Mr. Eiger's estate.
Well, finding out what happened, certainly. But doing everything within our power to protect Mr. Eiger's private life.
Mr. Eiger was a very private person. And although he's no longer with us, his intimates are.
Excuse me?
No. Mrs. Eiger is not a health care professional. She merely delayed in calling for help.
It wasn't a killing at all.
Donna may be an opportunist, but she is not a murderer. And since neither of us believe that Bruce was suicidal ...

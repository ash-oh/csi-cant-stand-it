Hi. Could I ask you a question? It's critical.
Am I your type?
Oh, yeah? Nice try.  Ring.
Last chance.
Yeah, I was at The Top Floor. I hit on a lot of girls. You can't arrest me for that, right?
Yeah, I remember a Lori. Said she was married. Yeah, right. You dress up like that and go to a club ... you're looking to get some.
So? I walked her back to her car. I am a gentleman.
Is that what this is about?
I was hoping it would go flat on her way back home, and I'd come along and fix it for her.
Seemed like a good idea at the time, yeah. 'Course I was tanked.
Well, that's the thing: It didn't. I mean, I followed her for like twenty minutes. Way off strip. And, come on, how long can you follow someone for, right?
I don't know anything about that.
No. I met Diane, uh, two weeks ago at Rain. Banged the cougar that night, but I had no idea she was anybody's mother.
Well, that's the whole point of banging a cougar -- you never got to see 'em again.
Well, which means I didn't kill her, like I told you.
I don't know. The lady paid me 2,000 bucks. Um ... said she was having a fight with her daughter and wanted to make good ... um, only Lori wouldn't return her calls, so it was my job to get 'em together. When she called me and asked me for my help later that night, she said she'd pay me

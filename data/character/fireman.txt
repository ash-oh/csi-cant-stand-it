Over there.
All right, check the fentanyl?
Tourniquet still in place?
I got a heartbeat!
Go pull a line towards the garage.
Knock it down.
You're going to be all right.
I'm going to need you to stay right here, ma'am.
Hey, I got one more!
Here you go, pal. You stay right here with your mom.
Ma'am, is there anybody else in there?
We got another one. 
Got another one.
We need a paramedic right now. She's not breathing.
That one? That turns on the siren, so we can get to places really fast. 
That's right.
Yeah.  I'm sorry, buddy. 
We've got a body! Alert homicide and CSI!

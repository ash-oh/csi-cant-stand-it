All right, Kevin!
I want you to prepare to jump!
Dude, the name of the show is Going All the Way.
Listen, man, you don't have a choice, Kevin. You already ate raw meat, you stuck your face in a beehive. You don't go all the way, you don't get nothing! Come on, Kevin!
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Dude, dude, check this out, get a shot of this.
Get his crotch. Get his crotch. Come here.
Our first contestant peed his pants. 
Re-a-li-ty! Come on, let go! You can't fake this.
Now, Kevin ... go, baby!
Keep going, keep going. But here's the thing. We're only four feet up. Joke's on him. Let's check it out.
Kevin! Kevin!
He's not moving.
Turn off the camera. Turn off the camera! Turn ...
See you later, Kevin!
Hey, Kevin?
He's not moving.
Come on, let's get out of here!
Look, I assured Kevin all our stunts were safe. And they were. Besides, he signed a waiver; I'm not guilty of anything.

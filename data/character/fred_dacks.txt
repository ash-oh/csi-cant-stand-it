Then show me some air, punk.
Yeah, what can I do for you? 
Jimmy. The guy was a punk. Other than paragliding and working here we had nothing in common.
Yeah, only 'cause that fool bit it off me. 
Yeah, whatever. It doesn't change a thing. The guy was a mouth. He threw shade all over the place.
Yeah.
Oh, is that right? From who? That artsy chick? He was sticking it to her. What did you think she was going to say? Plus, she was still pissed at me that I didn't take part in her little masterpiece.
Hell, no. I wouldn't fly with him. Dude can't match my skills. Nothing but a menace.
Oh, yeah. See? Tight line, leading edge to the wind. Carving it up. Must be me.
Yeah, yeah, I remember now, all right? Last time I saw Jimmy, he was still on the ground tugging his junk.
Well, then, why are you talking to me, man? 'Cause the only rig I got is my own. 
Uh-huh.
Rick.
Jimmy's going to hit you up for a canopy. Why don't you give him something big and slow?
: Perfect.
That's cute. You should put it in a frame. So I fix gear for other flyers sometimes, big deal.
Hey, I already told you, man, this dude was soft in the air. He could've turned back anytime.
Hey, I called him out, he took me on. Bigger air, higher altitudes push the limit, dude -- that's why we fly.

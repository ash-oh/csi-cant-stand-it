Sorry I'm late. Been on the phone all night with corporate ... not to mention I had a gun in my face. So, you want to know the lessees of some of our safe deposit boxes?
Why don't you just hold up a touch? I want to help you, but ... you're going to have to give me a court order.
Box 729 lessee is Benny Murdock.

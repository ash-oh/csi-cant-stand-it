Last, I would like to thank you for working late into the night. During this trial, you have heard people portray the defendant in glowing terms. He may be all of these things. He certainly seems likable. That doesn't change the fact that he got behind the wheel of his car legally drunk, and drove through an intersection, killing Shelley Daniels, a 12-year-old child. 
When you go into that jury room, I ask that you seek justice and return with a verdict of guilty. Not for me, not for his honor, not even for Shelley Daniels. I ask because Justice itself demands it. Justice is greater than our personal feelings. Than ... revenge, than ... than pity. Do not shrink, do not disappoint, but rather ... embrace it. Thank you.
I wish you could. I'm sorry. Thank you for coming on such short notice.
Yes, People v. Archer. Trial's on deck this Thursday. I prepped all weekend. 
Great. I've handed the case over to another D.A., Greg Rubio.
He's quick on forensics, he's great on game day.
I'll be dead.
My wheels?
Made me a widow, left me a souvenir. 
At the time, the doctors said if they removed it, I'd die. But in the last few years, the bullet has meandered. Last week, my voice gives out during a cross. I have trouble swallowing. Hand starts to shake. My neuro calls it Traumatic Basilar Artery Aneurysm. Um, he has to clip the artery.
The operation's delicate. The odds are, well ... low. I've really enjoyed working with you, Sara.
Victor?
Victor!
: Sara, hey.
Yeah. I beat the odds. I got lucky.
Yeah, my doctor mentioned it. He said that he gave you the bullet.
You're the one with the evidence.
I didn't understand why I couldn't move my legs.
I thought I could go back. That I could get rid of it.
You would think that an attorney could come up with a great case against an abusive husband, but I was ashamed. I didn't want people to know what he did to me.
I've always believed in Justice. I still do.

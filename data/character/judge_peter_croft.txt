Pull it closer, Mr. Stokes.
I'll allow it.
Dr. Grissom, please answer the question.
Ms. Wescott?
The witness may proceed.
You may be excused, Dr. Grissom.
I'm binding this case over for trial sixty days from today.
I'll take it under submission.
Bailiff?
It's a double murder, Counselor. Request for bail is denied. 
The Accused is remanded into custody of county jail.

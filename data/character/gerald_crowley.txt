Where is he? What did you do?
You swore you wouldn't lay a hand on him.
Yes, ma'am. Did you know this man is a bully? Big college football coach until he got caught abusing his own players. Almost got thrown in jail. You just had to take care of him for a few months. What the hell is wrong with you?
I swear ... If you hurt Jason ... I will kill you.
It's okay, Jason. Daddy's here, boy. Daddy's here.

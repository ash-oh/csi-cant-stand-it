Hi. My Suzy was in that apartment yesterday. And she was filthy when they sent her back, and I marched right over there to give Paula a piece of my mind, and she wasn't home. Paula wasn't there.
Her husband. Neither of them was there when I went back.
Guy always kinda creeped me out.
We live across the courtyard.
Bye.
I send Suzy over. I watch until she gets inside.

Max didn't like dogs. We don't allow them in the store.
No. Mr. Brown, what's this about?
Look, I have a right to know. Max was my business partner.
Based on a friggin' technicality. I talked to the D.A. myself.
Garbett killed Max. I was right here when he tried to shake us down.
I guess he could've handled it better. But Garbett's delivery trucks -- they were always blocking access to our parking lot. We complained -- he refused to do anything about it, so we exercised our legal rights. A judge rules in our favor. Two days later, Max is murdered. Can you imagine killing over an incident like this?
Yes.
Correct.
What are you getting at?

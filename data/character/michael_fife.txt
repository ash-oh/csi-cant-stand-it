I want to hear what they have to say.
I don't know anything about any threads.
Rachel was a neighbor. I'd say, hi. How are you? That's it.
No, I got this one. The night before Rachel was killed, there was a party in the courtyard ...
She must've taken the trash back inside her unit.
Listen to me. I don't know who killed Rachel. I don't know how that knife got in my car. I didn't even know my taillight was busted until that dumb-ass cop pulled me over. I've been in jail for ten days on something I didn't do, and I am tired of this crap!
Devil's in the details, huh?
I hung out until about midnight. Drank my six pack. Hit on a couple girls. Struck out. Went back to my apartment, passed out. In the morning, I drove up to Green Valley and installed a chandelier, two sconces. At noon, I went back to my apartment, and I made a tuna fish sandwich. Lettuce, tomato, spoon of relish. Wheat bread. Then ... I took a leak. I don't want to skip a beat.
That afternoon, I had a job in Henderson. On my way, I stopped, uh, at a car wash. It was a lunch-hour discount.
Reliant, on Chardon Circle. It's about a block from my apartment.
No. Yeah, in fact, I mean, they should've said something.

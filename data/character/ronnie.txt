Bad guys go away.
You're trying to rob me?
I'm being robbed by cops? You're trying to rob me!
Dakota? Now, what that crazy bitch got to do with this, huh? What, she snitched on me?
I didn't kill nobody.
Yeah, we kicked it, all right? We kicked it. Look, I would never kill no girl with all that good ... all right, look, let's just say I enjoyed having her live downstairs from me, man. Listen ... she knew when to open her mouth and when to keep it closed. Now, her girl, Jersey ... oh, God, the best mouth I ever had. Mmm. That mouth gave me a lot of pleasure. It just never stopped.
Out.
I-I-I was seeing customers, all right?
No.
Bitch, what the f- ... What are you talking about?!
Come on, man. Get out of the car.
So, how was he?
You wasn't supposed to do him.
You want me to admit to a murder I didn't commit so you can reduce a drug charge?
What, you high, right? Y-y-you must me high.
Hi, Sheriff. 
No. This place is creeping me out.
Catherine? I've got something else here.
Mine's dead, too.
Okay.
Here you go. Thanks!
Damn it.
Control, this is C-147 Lake for C13 Willows.
Hey, Catherine, I left my cell phone at the studio. I need to go back and get it.
Does that include the cost of the contract?
Damnit. I'll see you later.
Hello, Dispatch?
Hello?
Catherine, it's Ronnie. I'm stuck at Repulsion Pictures. I need backup.
Hello? 
Hello? 
Hello? 
Hello? 
Hello?
It's gonna be okay. Keep your voice down.
Shh!
Shh! Shut up!
For the love of God, stop talking.
That's good. Yeah, stop talking.
Shh-shh-shh!
Sir, I'm a CSI. Think about what you're doing.
Put down your weapon.
Yeah.
I wasn't acting.
I'll see you.
Thanks, but I like what I'm doing.
Okay, thanks.
Bye.
Hey. Sara, you done with your scene?
Great, because we just caught another one: 425 off Craig Road.
Busy shift, but you know I like that. I'll see you outside, okay?
Then someone ran out the door.
Mrs. Jimenez, are you okay?
Sara, she's got a very bad back.  Dispatch, this is CSI Lake. We need paramedics right away on location.
Sara?
Wait a minute. How are we going to handle this?
He'll be free by tomorrow. Her husband is obviously abusing her.
You can call me anytime. Just stay in touch, okay?
No. She came involuntarily. It took some convincing, but she's agreed to go to a shelter.
Maybe not. But at least now she has a chance. Look, I did it all on my own time, no OT. I know it's not the way you do things, but I think it's part of the job. At least, that's how I want it to be. For me.

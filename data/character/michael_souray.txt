Hi. Michel Souray, company manager of Ka. I'm sorry to meet you under these circumstances. 
Backstage can be a dangerous place if you don't know your way around. 
So the Cirque organization made a special agreement with Clark County. Any accidents that occur inside our facility are under Cirque jurisdiction. When we found the body, our personnel immediately transported her outside and the paramedics arrived within minutes. 
I have no idea who the poor girl is and I know every face on our staff. Watch your step.
During the performance, the stages above you are always moving. 
We found the body here in the crush zone.

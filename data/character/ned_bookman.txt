Ah, crap!
Look, I got another car. I hardly ever use the pickup. I work nights. Anybody could've stolen it. You know, I mean ... it could happen.
Apparently.
Roger lived across the street. Didn't make us pals, just neighbors.
Uh, F-F-Frank Kraft stole my truck. Uh ... I mean, I mean he-he borrowed it. He-he ... he borrows my stuff. I don't mind.
He and Roger, uh ... had problems. But you didn't hear it from me. 
Please don't say anything.

Sam?
Sam? Where is Sam?
What about Sam?! Sam!
Sam. Where is he? Where is...?
No.
Sabrina?
Sabrina, what are you doing here? You weren't supposed to be here. Sabrina?
Please help me. Please.
She wasn't even burned.
My husband died five years ago in a car accident. She ... was at her friend Molly's house for a sleep-over. At least she was when I went to bed.
I don't know, 11:00, 11:30.
I go to bed, I make sure the lights are off, lock the doors.
I go to work. I take care of my kids and my mother, and that's my life.
I'm sorry about this. Typically, I leave with Sab ... with Sabrina, but ... 
I don't.
I don't think so.
My house burned down, and my daughter is dead. And you're asking me to pee into a cup? 
Sure. Why not?
Sabrina? No. That girl had the focus like you can't believe.
So, Sabrina was taking drugs?
Fair enough. You know, Sabrina used to scream at me, I can't wait till I'm old enough to move out of here. And I would scream back, yeah, me either. What kind of mother says that to her kid?
You know what I pictured for this part of my life? S ... Saturday night, leave the kids with grandma, date night with my husband. Instead, I'm stuck home alone with two kids and a 70-year-old infant.
Part of me wants to say yes, please just take her away. Let her be the state's problem. You know, she leaves the stove on, and she leaves the water running. I come home, and I find little burn marks in things. But I was with her the whole night. I never saw her smoke.
I doubt it.
No. It isn't. Miss Willows, you can go ahead and judge me, but after my mother falls asleep at night, I lock her in her room.
They're going to ask you some questions about the fire at our house. And you'd better start talking, mister.

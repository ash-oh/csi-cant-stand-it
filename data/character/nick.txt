There's nothing good to eat around here.
We, uh, played a hunch; checked with homicide. You were late.
Bye.
Need help with your homicide?
She took the bus instead. Case solved.
Detective Secula.
What's up?
Yeah, well, missing person -- could be interesting.
Auto unit been by yet?
Yeah.
Secula ... something wrong?
That doesn't mean I wasn't going to. 
Is our missing person a redhead?
Call in a tow to the CSI garage. This case is now officially interesting.
Hey.
Good, good.  Are you putting one of Lindsey's drawings into evidence?
Yeah, I heard your missing person was a painting.
Oh!
There's no more hair. Not even a trace. No signs of foul play.
Yeah. Yeah, too clean ... ... which begs the question ... 
Hand me the phenothaline, please.
Well ... I am checking ... to see why someone scrubbed this carpet so clean. If there is blood present ... ... we'll know why.
Right.
Hey. Dead end. How about you?
Her abductor sold her card or is using it himself. What motel?
That's right around the corner from where we found her car.
Good job.
Are you Sheryl Applegate?
You, uh ... you haven't been abducted have you, Mrs. Applegate?
We found evidence of blood in your car.
That you're okay.  You're going to have to fill in the blanks.
May I see your discoloration?
You want to do time?
Well, that depends. Was she the assaulter or the assaultee?
No, I'm not even going there. 
Lace.
Gentlemen, Nick Stokes. I'm here for the 416; something about a special request.
Over where?
Thanks.
Excuse me ... ma'am?
You got to be kidding me.
Yeah, yeah, Kristy Hopkins, what are you doing here?
Whoa, whoa, whoa ... he spit on you?
All right, all right, break it up! Ease up! Ease up!
Kristy!
Get over here! I need your shirt.
Because every time we meet you put yourself in a position where you have to take them off.
Down, boy. What can you tell me? Is there saliva on it?
What, is it on the internet? Might as well be. Just remember that.
Gross.
What's that stuff?
No.
Then Kristy was telling the truth. But it doesn't mean it was the security guard's spit.
I'm going to need a sample.
If you saw the girl that went with this blouse ... you'd try.
She got in a fight with a Security Guard.
Are you asking me what I think you're asking me?
I don't believe this. You've always been so cool.
Sanders ratted me out, right?
I don't think so.
Yeah, I bet there are a lot of people looking to steal your two-headed scorpion. Not to mention Miss Piggy. 
I was out of line earlier. I'm not sleeping with her, if it helps any.
And, for the record she wasn't working -- she was shopping. And the security guard was a jerk, man. He pushed her around, then he spit on her. That's why she lost it.
I can't. There's something about her. Looking at her. She doesn't have anybody else. I had Sanders run a test on the shirt. There's saliva on it but the problem is, I can't get a match. The security guard refuses to give me a sample.
Black, no sugar.
Like I said on the phone I don't want to seem biased here. This girl's nothing to me. She's a hooker.
Yeah, professionally. But my profession, not hers. I cut her some slack a while back. She's bad news but she's a babe.
Yeah, between you and me, I should have busted her, but I thought I might get lucky.
Yeah. Next time she gets in a jam she throws my name out. My boss not pleased. So ...  I want you to write down your own statement seal it up in this envelope and I'll hand deliver it to the DA. It'll be good for both of us.
No problem. Us guys have got to stick together, right? That's right.
Us guys have to stick together, right? He said, right. You the man!
So, I mean, I could have used an STR-DNA but it's too state-of-the-art; it's overkill. So I used an HLA-DQ A1, with a ... polymarker.
You don't care about this at all, do you?
DA threw out the case.
Yeah.
Maybe you should try not getting into trouble. You do owe me one.
You know where to find me.
Mmm. Get to rate the boss. I dig this.
Two days before the Super Bowl.
Hmm. Organization ... minus one.
Whew! Two days before the super bowl and they're already killing each other.
Sergeant.
Oh ... gunshot wound to the head, point-blank range.
Check this out. Hearing aid?
Possibly. 
Got some condensation on the window. You should get a shot of this.
A rule of thumb: $2,500 an inch. There's got to be ... fifteen thousand there?
Giants minus nine.
It's a super bowl ticket. Straight bet-- $30,000.
Teller 12.
517? What's that?
I'd be willing to bet there's a mother out there that wishes you hadn't.
Yeah, we thought you might. So?
He didn't have a name?
So ... how do we find this, uh ... Voice?
Yeah.
He's not talking to himself, is he?
Yeah, I guess all the runners heard about it by now, huh?
What was Joey's route, exactly?
Are you interested in helping us better understand Joey's crime scene, or ... not?
Did you think to get back to your boss? Try to make amends?
Did you tell Joey to get out of town-that someone might try to harm him on behalf of your boss?
Whoa, whoa! Hold on, now. Nobody's going after anybody. Okay, he doesn't have to give us a name, Mrs. Hillman. Alright. Danny, you wear an earpiece, right? Just give us the frequency your runners operate on.
Yeah.
Okay ... here's what we're going to do. Open your nostrils.
You're on cool breeze. A hundred bucks.
This way, gents.
Yeah. I don't have it on me. I'll have to bring it to you.
Mm-hmm.
Hey, how you doing?
The runner ... um, 702. 
I owe him a little cash.
Um ... you have an envelope I could use?
Nice watch.
Thought you were getting out of this business.
Later.
New job, huh? Joey's old route?  Did you get so scared when you shot him that you forgot the money?
Well, you better get one that knows forensics ...  Dispatch, victor 19. Code 462 on the 4-20 suspect Monaco.
Oh, no. I just pulled a double and I still have to file my shift report.
Well, I guess I grew up.
Enjoy.
Here you go. Thanks, man.
Kristy? 
Kristy!
Hey. Back off.
Crime scene investigator.
Hey, we going to have a problem?
You okay?
I suppose you need a ride.
No. Come on.
Not that it's any of my business but maybe you should think about changing careers.
Yeah?
That's good.
Yeah. Yeah.
I don't think that'd be a good idea.
Hey, it's me. You in the shower? What are you doing? Anyway, if you check your messages I don't have to work till later. So I thought, since you're between careers you might want to grab a late ... 
... breakfast.
Not a lot. What's ... what's going on?
Who's the decedent? 
Yeah, I must've, uh ... I must've got my wires crossed. I'll see you.
Hey, guys.  Can I steal you for a minute?
Yeah, I know, and I'm sorry, but I don't think this can wait.
I wasn't till last night after I broke up her fight with this guy, uh ... Jack.
Yeah, and I can tell you what he's going to find. My fingerprints; my DNA.
I wasn't.
We had a connection, you know? A chemistry thing, I guess.
She was irresistible, man.
I took off around four.
Who told you?
So people know I was with Kristy last night?
Maybe I should just go to Ecklie and tell him I was there.
I can't just sit here.
Yeah.
Okay.
How's it going, Cath?
It's no big deal. What's up, Ecklie?
I assume you're trying to prove Kristy Hopkins and I were sexually active last night.
And my DNA will match, no warrant necessary. And I have something else for you. 
I got this off a valet surveillance tape.
You just love that, don't you?
I hate that guy.
Yeah.
You contact her family?
Has anyone claimed her for burial? Friend? Old roommate?
No. I'll pay.
Doc, I'm giving this girl a proper burial. I don't much care about my career right now. Someone wants to throw me in jail for that so be it.
Well?
DNA didn't pan out, huh?
Thank you. 
Hi. Just the guy I wanted to see.
Tell me why you did it.
She was going back to college, turning her life around getting out of the business, and you killed her for it! Why?
Do you think I'm going to believe the John that killed her?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess you're right. Because there's no happy ending for you. Twenty-five to life.
Outstanding.
Yeah.
You got it.
It looks like somebody in the dental society database saw our posting.
Sid Tucker.
He has records that go back thirty years.
It's lower level third from the middle. 
Better memory than you. And ... our first character match.
Two for two.
Nolan Ryan pitches another perfect game.
Mel Bennett. 326 Franklin Street. Date of birth September 6, 1931. He was 70.
Sure.
See this tissue?
Yeah. Tells us blood was not pumping through Mel Bennett's veins when he was cut up.
Yeah. 
I wonder how much it costs to feed all these fish.
Hmm? Right.
Marco?
You want to get out of there, sir? Pool closed at sundown.
Someone's bitter.
You? Tired? I thought you never sleep.
Nice. Nice.
What up, G?
Don't look at me. I've got 'sunshine' all night.
Check for DNA in the sexual assault kit and the fingernail, please.
Tut's Tomb. Steak and eggs, $1.99.
Two for one.
What do you got?
Same social? You're sure? 
Bam!
Oh, yeah.
Grissom? 
Can I talk to you?
I just ... 
Grissom, this is important.
We matched the DNA taken from Lacey Duvall to a cold case in Texas ten years ago.
The suspect's name was Chad Matthews.
Sara ran Patrick Haynes' social. The real Haynes is deceased. So Patrick Haynes is Chad Matthews and Chad Matthews is on the run.
Hmm. Yeah, some guys still like to foot the bill.
Hey, I only go Dutch if girls ask the wrong question.
What do you drive?
No. No, it's not. What it means is, How much money do you make? So you can take care of me.
Ooh. Either that or a dimpled ballot. 
Hmm. Let's connect the dots.
Here, I'll show you. Catherine, you wear pierced earrings. May I?
Sign your name, please.
Now, nobody signs their signature exactly the same way twice. Not even you, chicken scratch. If they do, then one of them's a forgery. Here's where connecting the dots comes in.
We dot the lines... and curves ... of the signature.
Who picked this place?
Hey, did anyone tell Grissom where we were having lunch?
Oh, that is good. One of our moes has six names that we know of including Chad Matthews.
Okay, Patrick Haynes.
Whoever. He commits a murder ten years ago. Why give up your DNA so easily?
Right on.
What's the cookie?
Wait, wait. Time out, now. I had half a Caesar and a coffee. How's my end 20 bucks?
Excellent idea, Sara. You're catching on. I'd love to.
It looks like a high heel print. Maybe abducted. 
Did she know the guy? Did he use his car or hers?
Cartridge casings. They don't look like hunters' either.
We couldn't have been there long. No elements.
Scent pads?
Looks like a giant dustbuster.
Yeah. Yeah, then we pull them out when we know enough about this denim guy to find a proximal location.
And left two cartridge casings behind for us. Thank you very much.
Still, you'd think the bad guys would figure we'd eventually start a database on cartridge casings, huh?
Well, well, well. Looks like this gun was used before in a case we've handled. 
North Vegas shooting.
Hey, you guys, this North Vegas shooting with the same casings as our Jane Doe's?
It was gang-related. And homicide never found the shooter.
Snakebacks.
Lets the opposition know who was responsible.
First-name basis, Sara?
Our ball cap belongs to somebody in this neighborhood. These houses are full of people who know the guy who wears it.
Why can't we just use those scent pads?
Great, great. Why'd you even suggest it?
Now you want to use the dogs to track down the Jane Doe shooter?
Yeah, but I spoke to Brass. He said we can't get a warrant on anything we need from the suspect's house-- gun, jeans, nothing.
You're rushing this for Sara.
Whoa!  Are we supposed to be able to keep up with those guys?
Guy's wearing the evidence in plain sight. We just got lucky.
Yeah.
Hey, Sara, did anyone ever tell you, you have a pretty good singing voice?
Come on. I've heard you around here. People never tell you that?
Yeah. Yeah. Take a look.
Okay, let's go tell the boss. 
Hey, if you go near that Thorpe kid...
I'm just saying ...
Unusual way to penetrate a safe.
How much was taken? 
Yellow looks like transfer from the murder weapon but what's with the glitter?
Your hair looks great, Cath.
Well, the back entrance was overgrown with them.
Yeah. Yeah, Jim, hi. I took these photos at the crime scene. 
Safe was cracked with a plasma lance.
It's a high-powered electric blaster. It could cut through that hard plate with extreme precision. It's not common, but effective. 
Crime scene photo from a robbery case in '99. 
Joseph Felton our dead guy, was arrested but granted immunity in exchange for his testimony against his partner, Darin Hanson who used a plasma lance to crack that safe. Darin Hanson ...
... was released from prison last month. His last known address -Vegas.
Yeah, they hook it up.
... break through the rear entrance of the pottery store.
Hanson lances the safe ...
Once the safe is cracked, Hanson steps back allowing Felton to collect the cash.
With Felton's attention diverted Hanson seizes the moment ... kills him.
Revenge for testifying against him and putting him in prison.
No, no ... but I think we know who to ask.
So it's a coincidence that he was killed shortly after you were released from prison.
The transcript from your trial says that you used a plasma lance in that
Tammy Felton's our murder suspect?
Whoa, wait. I thought her prints from the crime scene -- they weren't fresh.
Well, the swab from the head wound's at trace.
I'm on it.
Do you have the results on the swab yet?
Uh... from the dead guy at the pottery store? The coroner sent over a sample. You were supposed to analyze the mineral content.
Grissom's on a missing persons-- he hasn't sent you anything.
Oh, yeah. Catherine's working with me.
Great.
No.
Do you see the sparkly bits?
Yeah, ready.
Nothing yet.
Whoa, whoa, whoa ... stop.
Are you serious?
Which is radioactive. Do we need to evacuate the building or anything?
You sure?
Yeah. He says I'm okay, but you know Greg. Tell me, am I radiating a green glow?
What's uranium doing on a murder weapon anyway?
Color enhancers?
Say no more.
You got to be kidding me.
We have a warrant.
I should get a finder's fee. 
Here. One for each of you.
I need a darkroom.
Now, if uranium is present the photons should react with the film. 
Okay, I'm exposing it ...
Thanks.
Done.
No mercy. 
This guy's stabbed at least five times. Got some reddish hair. Vic's hair is brown.
Now! Let's go guys! Go! SARA: Pick the jacket up!
Let's go! BRASS: Bring me a body bag. I want to cover this woman! NICK: Get a bag, hurry up!
Let's go, let's go! Okay, I've got it.
All right, let's get him out.
Don't even bother bagging it.
Hey, Greg.
Somebody's been putting in way too much overtime.
Cute toes?
Mmm.
Mmm.
Oh, what's in her heart?
Dude, you're sick. Man, you've officially lost it.
But whatever happened to getting to know someone over coffee ... letting the relationship evolve? Romantic is sending flowers not bogarting her skin cells. 
Um, pulled some hair off a male stabbing vic.
What?
Cat hair?
Hope you're not allergic there, boss.
Cat hair. Found similar hair on Kevin Shepherd's clothing.
Nope. No hairs on the wife.
Victim number three. Wrong place, wrong time. Saw something she shouldn't.
What?
None of the above.
Hey, Grissom, you know that theory I had?
I'd like to revise it.
My evidence is in the layout room.
All the wounds sustained by Kevin Shepherd were to his torso. Now, look at this. 
Blood flow on the left instep of Kevin Shepherd's shoe.
Amy Shepherd was too far away but Jessica Hall was alive and bleeding.
Gravity. Warrick, please, on the floor our back.
Sara, you're Jessica.
Come on, now. 
I say hinder.
She was in on it. She held him down while someone else stabbed him.
I heard the lab matched the blood on Kevin Shepherd's shoe to Jessica. My theory's getting better and better.
What's he doing calling the woman who helped kill him?
I think I found a keypiece of evidence. 
The redhead we've been looking for.
Chances are Shepherd was here without his wife.
To access Achex, double-click icon. User name: Jessica. Password: Money.
Yeah. 
Achex. Personal on-line banking. Deposits, checking, money transfers everything under the sun. 
Okay, I'm in. Direct deposit from Beaumont's department store$500 a week -- probably her weekly paycheck.
What, she win the lottery?
Let's see who she gave it to.
No luck.
Wait a minute -- Shepherd paid Jessica to murder him and his wife?
I took this from our suspect's apartment.
Don't cancel your next reservation. It wasn't a carjacking.
Quarters for laundry. Not incriminating. Pay parking ticket. Andre's at 9:00 P.M.? 
Whoa!
Assuming K is Kevin they were planning to meet three days after he was murdered.
No. Neither was Jessica.
I'm with you. Why'd he end up dead?
He was cheating on his wife, Amy.
Which means he didn't need CPR.
Maybe not. In 1997, Jessica and Justin had a joint account. And they shared the same last name.
No, thanks, I'm an iced tea man.
Okay, then what?
Never seen him like this before.
Here's the father's bottle of cola -- here's the unknown. I duplicated conditions and monitored the pressure that escaped from the father's bottle which he told you had been open two hours against one I know was open two hours. Kept this log. Pressure released every quarter hour.
Well, I've got trace running tests now, but I did an unscientific whiff test. 
Picked up a hint of some kind of booze.
I'll take a swatch, get it back to you ASAP.
We got a call about ten minutes ago-- a shooting at Vegas Grounds Coffee Shop, eighth and main. Multiple fatalities.
One person dead, it's a shame; more than one's a party.
Thank you.
Speed metal. Couldn't hear a bomb go off over this.
Guy wasn't light with the ammo. This place is raining shell casings.
Who's the muscle?
Cash taken?
You're thinking hit?
She's probably still in high school.
Bless her heart.
Another nine-millimeter, just like our casings.
Once the coroner makes a positive I.D. Their families will be notified.
Good news, bad news. Same caliber, different gun.
What we have is five dead bodies.
Smoke and mirrors.
If it was a hit, the guy came to the front door took out Al and Frankie, and got the witnesses. Bullets will confirm it. Shooter was standing here when he shot Al ...
... bamm. Once in the chest. This is Flynn. 
One miss ... 
... One hit ... one through and through.
Each victim gets a different color. Blue beams are isolated. The kid with the cd player was alone.
Shooter was positioned between Flynn and the front door. Flynn eats it ... ? Nah.
I would have taken out big Al ... bodyguard first.
Ident found both of the bodyguards' paws on the counter.
Big Al would already be dead. It doesn't make any sense.
What if he came through the back?
Yeah. Yeah. Shot twice in the back while headed for the rear exit.
What?
Like this.
I love this job.
Assuming Erin was running for her life the shooter follows her in the back room shoots her twice -- he would have been shooting toward the parking lot.
He'd only shoot toward the front if there's somebody there. 
Yeah, and somebody else saw. Frankie Flynn was an innocent bystander. Wrong place, wrong time.
You really think Erin knew she was pregnant? I mean, six weeks?
Yeah. Brass talked to her parents. There was no guy in her life.
Stall them. We want a paternity test.
911 page?
What's up?
Son of a bitch swapped the gun barrel out.
Could be an incomplete tool mark. Maybe the guy dropped his gun. Either way, we still don't have the barrel.
But we've got Kendall's ammo. What about bullet batching?
Every casing's got two pieces of information on it: Manufacturer and caliber.
So if you compared the casings we collected at the crime scene with the casings from Brad Kendall's gun...
Which would link Brad's ammo to the crime even though we can't link his gun.
But still enough to build a case.
Well, Catherine's working on a hunch.
Microscopic surface analysis. This ought to make things more clear.
Casings from your gun are on the right. Casings collected from the crime scene are on the left.
Six weeks pregnant with your child.
I guess he won't be eating dinner tonight.
He picked the wrong time of day to be running alone. Dusk is when the animals come out.
So what are we dealing with?
Most people don't admit when they're wrong.
So a dog killed him, then someone came along and cut him up.
Go back to the crime scene. Collect the dog's scat.
I didn't realize how many dogs take their walks up here when I said that.
No, hair and fiber is evidence, Warrick. This is combat duty.
Don't even waste your time. That's cougar.
See the rabbit hair in the feces? Don't you remember the seminar?
Julie?
Looks like dirty ice.
It's evidence of a picnic, Warrick.
Corn. Hamburger. Rawhide. But no human cellular tissue in this sample.
Man, do you turn it on like this at your seminars?
Well, if he's got bits of jogger hanging out of his mouth, cuff him.
Does this mean Simba's going to the big dog pound in the sky?
Well, I can tell you we found a unique sample at the crime scene. Great dane-sized scat containing bits of premium pet store kibble.
Sirloin, rice -- nothing artificial.
Dry ice. Frozen co2 sublimates into invisible gas, not water.
Surgeon?
Warrick. I got a match.
The scat I found at the crime scene and the scat from the doctor's house are the same, except for one difference. The stuff from the backyard -- full of human cellular tissue. Jogger DNA.
Weird, isn't it?
To prove the presence of heme -- the stuff that makes blood red ... 
Yeah.
But we found evidence of blood on it.
Hey, you're the one who said that lady doc keeps skipping town.
This is only part of the kitchen-- the rest is in those bags and boxes.
Yeah.
Whoa, whoa. So she's not selling the organs on the black market ... she's eating them?
Okay. Good. I'm on it.
Look. Grissom I know this is a bad time to bitch to the boss but, uh, I've been a CSI Level 3 for nine months now. I was a CSI before Warrick. Warrick works D.B.'S solo. Why can't I?
Silk, silk, silk?
Milk.
Look, I'm not one of your suspects you can trick, okay? If I'm not ready, be a man -- tell me I'm not ready.
You know why I took this job? Honestly? I wanted to pack heat, walk under the yellow tape, be the man ... but mostly, because I want you to think I'm a good CSI.
Oh, man.
If it's the rest of him he's been skinned.
Yeah. Most likely to avoid I.D. Hey, Sara.
No approaching surface prints. No tire tracks. Only O'Riley's boot prints. These are ours. Look at the area around the corpse. Look at the big dent in the ground, like a meteor hit.
What are we doing? Walking through the garage.
All right. It's simple. We got the body, they got the head. The BMW's fair game. Come on, Sara, where's your Noriega?
Grissom. 
Uh ... Sara ... want to take a look at this?
Peanuts on the gas pedal. You're kidding.
Hmm.
You up for a riddle?
Okay, repeat after me: Silk, silk, silk.
What do cows drink?
Never mind.
Mm-hmm. Perp thought he could cover his tracks by taking off his shoes.
Oh ... so this is the rest of his body?
Yeah-- whatever punctures, whatever chops. 
Bob Villa.
It's private.
Enough.
Grissom didn't tell me anything. 
I put this together myself. 
Give me some light here, will you, partner?
All right, it's like this: Sock prints were found at the crime scene: Size 11. Shoes Grissom took from the closet here: Size 11. Dasilva's shoe size: Ten. So whose size 11's were they? Grissom missed something.
I'm calling Grissom.
All right. Thanks.
You sure you can't help me out?
We found one of your uniforms in his closet. Any idea how it got there?
Guys ... look, boss, I'm sorry. I thought I was onto something here. I had a conflict in shoe sizes so I thought I'd play a hunch. Sara was right there. We were checking out the shoes ...  ... and we found some peanuts in the cuff links and go up and Spurs Corral.
I don't think so.
...so that's why I buzzed you guys down. You got to follow your hunches, right?
What? You're looking at the sombrero?
Okay, Mr. Applewhite ... take a walk.
You see, everyone's foot makes a unique well impression. Check it out. 
The, uh width ... ball of the foot ... instep ... arch ... and, uh ... 
... size 11 for dessert.
Yeah, he did.
What can you tell us?
A hypnotic.
Percussive control.
Okay. I'll go back to the scene, try to find something like it.
Will do.
Hey, Gil, you want to give me the skinny on this meeting of yours? I'm on my way back to the crime scene. 
I got paged about the signature case.
Freeze!
Hey.
Get out of there. Get out of the closet.
What are you doing?
All right. Quiet. Quiet. Are you out of your mind? I could've killed you. This is a crime scene. You don't belong here. Unless you want me to get the cop at the front door you'll get out of here now. And I'd better not see any pictures of this apartment in your paper ... or I'll have the D.A. on your front door.
You didn't scare me.  Mm-mm.
No.
You guys got a sec? He's wearing latex gloves. The thick kind, too. He must know the thin ones leave prints.
You know, it's not fair, Grissom. You know more about signatures than most of them put together.
All right, well, I got dibs on Eileen Snow. And I have a strong feeling I'm going to be the one to break the case.
Yeah, I'm looking in front of Eileen Snow's apartment. This security guard said he saw a guy burn rubber out of there tight of Eileen's murder.
Yeah, well, there's no rubber here. On the pavement or curb. A coup of oil spots, that's about it. And I called Brass. Nobody took any photographs of any tire marks. Not the Las Vegas P.D. Not the Feds.
Mm-hmm.
I was just looking for a quiet spot to call my girlfriend.
I got to run, peanut. Love you, too. Bye-bye.
Give me some of that.
You, uh... you got me, right, War?
How's this for service?
Re... fried beans. Mmm!
Whoo!
He's altering his voice, sir, electronically.
In a car trunk -- that kind of thing.
No.  You're in mine.
I outrank you.
Keep telling yourself that.
I know what to tell the audio guy.
I got it under control. 
Swear. 
Later.
Captain Brass. Hey.
Sorry. Sorry. Grissom told me to hook up with you. He says the drop place will be a crime scene.
Why don't they move in on the guy?
Well, he's been there five minutes.
Here, kitty, kitty...
You think that's him? You think that's our guy right there?
Hey, Catherine what time's your little girl coming by?
Yeah, but I got her a chem set.
Stop flirting with me. Cath, really, when's the party?
Hey, just in time. We're giving it a final run.
It is. Now, ransom tape against your exemplar. You got it loaded up, T.H.D.?
There's something wrong. There's just a green line.
We got our kidnapper.
I'll call Brass, tell him to go pick the guy up.
What did I do wrong?
Like what? We already matched the guy's voice.
You think I don't know that? Aw, you been second-guessing me ever since I got on this case.
I'll go back to the tape.
Hey!
Yeah, the ransom tape enhanced -- mega-enhanced.
All right. Hey, I just ... I didn't know there was more to look for, you know?
Audio downloaded everything. Dubs are cued up.
I'm sure you all recognize Chip's voice unaltered. Now, one more time with a slight variation.
Heck, we can lift entire speeches just to see what's underneath.
All right, let's go, Laura. Officer has a car waiting out front.
What do you think, bro? Breakfast on me?
Ouch. Well, time-and-a-half. A cup of java, and you're set.
That's harassment. 
Later, bro.
I know, a dead body at a fraternity. 7:00 A.M.-Looks like we're pulling another double.
Yeah.
Hideous. Thank you.
I can't believe I used to live in a place like this. It seems like a hundred years 
Guys, Nick Stokes. This is Sara Sidle. We're with the crime lab.
Hey, Matt.
Okay.
Good god.
Coroner pronounce?
Let's get him down.
Was James depressed?
So, you guys let James know he wasn't getting in, right?
So he asphyxiated by hanging? Are you ruling suicide?
But we found him swinging from the ceiling.
Oh, no, I ... don't have to look. I have a pretty good idea what this is all about, so ...
Knock yourself out.
Come on, man, I was a Greek and we had all kinds of policies, too. Guys still hazed.
Yeah, you know, your, uh ...
Answer the question, guys.
Humiliation, initiation ...  ... appreciation.
Right, right?
Bust it out.
I'm nuking a burrito.
Mm-hmm. That's interesting.
Kyle, I'm getting that hazing feeling.
Tell me about the liver.
Kyle ... Kyle ... eleven years ago I was you, man. Smoking cigars in closets, playing tanks. I wore a trout in my jean pocket for seven days till my leg went half numb. I've been there. So, don't ... don't tell me what about it?
Don't worry. They will be.
We can hold him for manslaughter.
You're going 80 miles an hour in second gear. Let's just slow down, all right?
They said they performed the heimlich, right?
Well, if they performed the heimlich, there'd be evidence of trauma. 
Not even a fracture.
No, it's two deltas. Greek letters. She's a delt.
Jill, we need to ask you a question. Is this your signature?
We don't know yet. That's what we're trying to find out. How well did you know James?
Who's your boyfriend?
Yeah, fibers liver-anything to implicate these guys.
The murder weapon. Dingle-dangle.
Matt, I got to know. How much did it tick Kyle off?
Jill.  Man, Kyle must've been steamed. His girlfriend signs a pledge's privates?
Hey, Matt you know why I joined a fraternity? 'Cause I wanted to belong to something -- the brotherhood. That's what it was all about for me you know what I mean? So, I'm going to cut to the chase here, bud. You come clean, you might be able to save your house ... save the brotherhood, but ... if you don't ... 
Everything you're trying to protect you'll destroy. Matty, I found the string. Now are you ready to tell us what happened after James got back to that house?
Your boy rolled over on you, slick.
Oh, yeah. They gonna love you.
Here I am.
I got it. Man, check out all that blood spatter.
What did you find out?
You don't seem too bummed about it.
Mm-hmm. Then there's only one thing left to do. 
String it.
Blood spatter on northwest wall. Blood sprays northeast corner above ...
No, I'm not confused. X marks the spot. A blow here ... here ... and here. Our dean received the majority of blows when he was on the ground.
Mm-hmm.
The blood spatter has a void instead of one continuous line of spray.
Which means our assailant was here and ... there was somebody else in this room.
Look, homicide will give us her name if you won't. There are detectives, and your school's not that big.
We're forensic scientists, Julia. Blood talks to us. People exaggerate or forget. Blood's like my grandfather. Never lies.
No, I just strung it.  No, the computer gizmo does all the geometry. 
You factor in the location of the body in relation to the blood on the wall in order to recreate the event. Each hit that drew blood gets its own unique color as he fell. See?
So how could your friend Kate, who's roughly half his size, wrestle him to the ground and keep him there while she bludgeoned him to death? Without help?
Hmm.
That's not enough. It's not enough. What's the one thing we're missing?
What's it?
The blood.
Oh, yeah. You don't even have to know every star and you can draw a constellation.
And fill in the rest. Whoa, look at that last finger there.
We'll have to ask our ladies, but I can tell you this -- somebody's playing through the pain.
It heals a lot faster when you wear one of these.
You held him down ... while she killed him.
For all forensic purposes, it is over. They're going to eat bread and bang a metal cup against some bars. That's it. It's over for us.
It's not our job to know why. It's our job to know how. You heard Grissom. The more the 'why', the less the 'how', the less the 'how', the more the 'why'.
Yeah?
Hmm. You got your why. Crime of passion.
I guess they didn't feel like they had a choice.
Okay, I'm ready up here. 
Can you confirm it's human?
There's got to be an easier way.
Ten bucks says the owner sells the house.
She?
I know all I need to know. I figure she was killed before her cement bath.
She was stabbed at least a dozen times -- a screwdriver, maybe ... like... a spike.
Well, stabbings are personal. She knew her attacker.
You brought the foundation of the house to our lab.
I pulled the permits. Summercliff was built five years ago on nothing but desert.
House was sold subsequent to completion, so the homeowner isn't a suspect. Homicide is running a missing persons check.
I think our killer was counting on that.
Here you go.
Yeah. Yeah, okay, I'll do that.
Grissom. Hey, doc. Hotline's lit up. Five callers all I.D.'D the same woman -- Fay Green -- and her mother just confirmed.
I don't care about the ocean, just the sand in my skeleton. Can you pinpoint a beach?
Why don't you ask him yourself?
Could the particles be sediment from the concrete where we found her?
What does that mean?
Now, let's go.
Hi.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Guess where Jason Hendler was employed five years ago.
Close. A subcontractor. How did you know?
I'll meet you outside. Hi, Teri.
It's luminol, sir. It dries quickly.
Why use the Alternate Light Source if the luminol didn't pick up anything?
Who lacquers maple unless they're trying to hide something?
And you painted the floors, covered your tracks for what, aesthetic reasons?
Officer, would you please arrest Mr. Hendler?
I'll get to work.
Mrs. Hendler, do you and your husband do much rock climbing?
Mrs. Hendler, I'm a good listener.  You got to give me the gun.
No, wait.
Wait!
Yeah.
I'll take the back. Warrick, you get the front?
This kid should be out playing Pop Warner.
How do you know it's fresh?
.
And I bet he dropped the bidi I found in the back on the way out.
Yeah. Those hand-rolled cigarettes? Probably a teenager. They're always taking shortcuts.
Hmm?
Yeah. It's cool. I'll see you back at the lab.
The bidi? DNA's still processing but Tina said nobody in the family smoked.
Well, it's just like a cigarette.
There's no smoking in here.
And I'm not your dude. This ain't a movie and Sharon Stone's fine. Let's go. 
Matches?
Ha-ha-ha! Houston, we have liftoff.
You see how each half of the match lines up?
Ah ... who broke the case?
Ecklie?
We got them both. I don't much care why they did it.
See you, Cath. 
Normal would be nice.
Oh! Warrick: Throw the flag, ref! NICK: Uncatchable, bro.
Is it true?
You're going down, bro.
Call came in blind. You see who could have made it?
I'm thinking DUI.
I'm calling that beer bottle.
It's still cold. Foam in the bottle. Take it up top?
The skid start way up the road. I got him doing at least 70.
These grooves are from the car's frame. It balanced before it fell. 
This is where he bailed. Wide spacing, slipping of the heel. He ran.
The phantom driver.
I don't know. That's why we're up here. But he left his buddy hanging out to dry. I can tell you that.
Driver ran to this point, car picks him up. Here are your tracks ... probably took him to the hospital.
You care to back that statement up? My phantom driver against your criminal?
Fifty.
Mr. Backseat going to make it?
He well enough to talk?
All right, all right, I get the picture. How long until we can see him?
Check his personal effects. 
That's it?
To what, a deuce?
You bet.
Hey, man, this is war.
Minor setback. How about the 911 call?
Good.
Car was rented from the airport three days ago.
Walter Banglor. I figure Vegas vacation; side trip to Hoover Dam.
Mm-hmm.
No.
No, he travels light. There was only a change of clothes in the damn suitcase.
All right, the fumes have settled. Give me a hand.
You can run ... but you can't hide.
Give me the good news.
It's a big list.
Let me see. 
I have no idea.
Possibly a cop from Philly. Or a ... a nurse from Omaha. Don't forget the mail carrier from Nashville. 
Well, this is going nowhere.
No, no, no, no. We're still on. I may be stalled, but I'm not out.
You want to take it to three? 
You still think he was robbed?
He lays in wait, he robs him, he tries to kill him, but he lets him buckle in?
What about the blue dust, Warrick?
Don't you think it matters?
Okay, like?
I hate you.
Hey, partner, you get a match yet? Ooh! Converse all-star.
And you needed all the books for that? 
Those soles have been around 20 years.
You look tired, buddy. You want me to make you a bottle, go nigh-nigh?
You should have worked the tire tracks. Jimmy in trace put together a digital catalog of treads ... has thousands on file. Took me three minutes.
And standard on your alleged getaway vehicle ... the '99 Bentley Arnage, red label. It's a sweet ride, man -- handcrafted. So, how many people in Vegas you think drive that kind of price tag?
Oh-ho! So sweet!
Well, I wish Banglor's rental car company were as considerate as your thief.
That's right.
Something to compare our mystery blue dust to.
We don't bet on cases.
Banglor's shooting stick with the phantom driver ... tosses a few back ... piles into the rental ... ...I-93, Hoover Dam. But don't drink and drive. You might spill your drink ... car skids ... bangs into the railing ... 
... see-saws ...
... on the edge ... what does the driver do? Man, he bails. He leaves Banglor in the back seat to take the fall. 
Literally.
Fingerprints, grooves, footprints: All the bases are covered. Victim, suspect, crime scene. Like a laxative ... 
It works.
You know, I hate to admit it ... but I like your theory. It does work.
So, what do you think? Can two solid theories, each backed by evidence both be correct?
That's all we'll need.
Hey, hey. How are you feeling, Mr. Banglor?
I'm going to come right out and say it. What happened to you is not right. The person responsible needs to be brought to justice. You tell me who that person is. Who was driving that car?
I'm Nick Stokes. This is Warrick Brown. We're with criminalistics. We've been working your accident.
You climbed in the back seat yourself?
Glad we could help.
Well, the only thing we didn't factor in was his will to live.
No loser. 
406. Burglary. Double or nothing?
What about the passengers in coach? They see anything?
So, more than one guy?  What do you think, Gris?
Is that a meat thermometer?
Guy should be colder than that. Body temperature drops two degrees in the first hour after death then one and a half degrees for each successive hour.
That would make his temperature at the time of death ... 101.6.
Looks like the heel of a boot.
Well, this guy's a study in contradictions. 
He's got defensive wounds on his palms but the scrapes on his knuckles and the broken hand indicate aggression.
What have you got?
What about prints?
Hey. Are you losing your touch there, Einstein?
Coroner's photos of the dead guy's back. Multiple horseshoe-shaped bruises. Those are definitely shoeprints.
CSI-3 seniority, sweetie.
If I'm Max, I want no part of this.
Plus, I don't have an aisle seat.
Right. Max gets up ...
... slides across Marlene. Excuse me, buttercup.
I come over confront the dead guy. Then what?  Who talked to 2F? To Max?
Oh, yeah.
This is when they really get scared.
Mine, too.
He tried to get away.
Whoa.
And you're okay with that? We processed evidence for twelve hours laid out the whole case and now those passengers are going to suck martinis and eat shrimp cocktails? Where's the justice?
Yeah. What else?
Their lives were threatened when Candlewell was at the emergency exit trying to open it, but the five feet between the exit and the aisles is what made the difference between self-defense and murder.
I don't know.
Catherine, you're a mother. You and Lindsey are on that plane. How far do you go?
Yeah, you're talking about a dog owner on heroin. How responsible can he be?
What's so different about this morning?
So ... why was the gate open?
Mm-mmm. 
No, thanks.
I don't know, man. Something back at that house must have bit me.
Yeah, this is the guy who told me to put hemorrhoid cream on my acne.
Yeah?
Something definitely two-legged went through it. Got mostly partials. Print lab's working on it now.
Mandy ... give me something dandy.
No. Came back: Walt Braun.
Oh, it's no worries. I got some cream.
All right. It's no big deal, really.
9:15 that morning.
About a half hour.
Who is this?
So ... ?
Ah -- I don't know, boss. I mean, ask yourself the question: Are doggie-door prints and chigger bites enough to get a man for murder?
But Tony changed his mind, which changed the will.
So, what's right in front of us that we're missing?
Where'd you find that?
I got one left. Smile.  Lovely.
Yeah, we're done here, brother.
Yeah, I just finished it.
You were late.
Yeah. Good luck.
Hey, Jim ... what do you make of that void? Nail?
Don't say that.
Then call him.
I didn't say anything.
You know how Grissom is. If you ask him for the keys to the car he's going to ask you if you've done your homework.
It's like a multiple choice question. You know? Go with your first choice.
Sack up.
You got to turn on your pager. I got Brass' daughter's car in the garage.
Hey, Vega says we won't be able to hold the suspect more than half an hour.
Guys ... 
Tire plug. That's a nail in sheep's clothing. 
Treads from the crime scene.
The void on the one-to-one matches the void on Ellie's left rear tire. Siamese twins.
Yeah.
Where's his daughter?
Check his weapon?
One shot?
What kind of cop doesn't empty his magazine? They're trained to shoot to kill.
Novice shooters get their hands pinched in the slide.
Hey, guys. I just pulled the manager out of a restaurant. Bob Fairmont was staying in room 2927. Catherine's parking the car.
Okay.
Murder Central?
Well, if I did, would I have asked the question?
Sara doesn't know what Murder Central means any more than I do.
What do you got?
What do you think, cocaine?
How can you tell just by looking?
Okay, we're done in the elevator. You guys need a hand?
Thanks a lot.
You are so busted.
Nice shot.  Reservoir's still wet.
Mmm. I'm only impressed if he aimed.
Not rocket science. Man's inside, woman's out.
His fingernails.
Who approved this cremation?
A heavy metal like selenium presents so rarely that it's 
No, sir, no, I'm not. I'm Nick Stokes. I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
Thank you, doctor. 
I was hoping I might be able to get a sample of that new kidney of yours.
Biopsy. A sliver.
Maybe an invasive scope. The only way I can get an accurate barometer of the poison in Mr. Fairmont's system is through one of his organs.
Hey, I understand. Thank you for your time.
I like your watch, man, that's cool.
Yeah, get it to a watch repair shop.  I hope you get to feeling better, Mr. Mercer.
Hey, Mr. Mercer. I got your message. You wanted to talk to me?
No. No, sir. ,I have found selenium in his office but... without actually knowing how much was in his system ... 
I'm sorry. 
I can't even talk Warrick into splitting a sandwich with me and this guy's willing to give us his kidney?
Yeah, that's my point. Carl Mercer risks dying sooner to help our investigation but who protects his rights?
Well, so do I. I want to retract our request. I don't think any investigation for the dead is worth hurting the living.
What?
What? Player was in the hotel cheating with his own wife?
Ms. Fairmont ... Ms. Fairmont, you feeling okay?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Yeah, yeah, let's sit down here in the car for a sec. 
There you go. Relax, relax, relax.
yeah, I need an ambulance. Uh, Vegas PD, west parking lot.
ER doc gave her a shot of hydropazeen ... sent her on her way.
Which means ... somebody's been poisoning our suspect.
Hey, Sara, got the warrant.
Yeah, But it doesn't stop the smell.
We'll find out.
Hey, Sara. Yeah. Sodium selenite-- selenium. 280 milligrams for a 180-pound man...
Yeah, well, it would have been murder for a 300-pound man.
Yeah, it contains polysorbate 80 and vitamin E. That combination's found in selenium supplements injected in animals.
Mostly livestock, grazers.
Well, it looks like a through and through. 
Hunting rifle. Winchester 70.
Four in the magazine, one in the chamber. All accounted for. This rifle was never fired.
When's hunting season?
No bullet in the body.
No bullet in the tree.
Catherine!
Yeah. But how am I going to get it out of there without damaging it.
Yeah, I'll figure it out.
Coroner said it's cut and dry. Bullet severed an abdominal artery.
Front to back. Straight across. Round entered one inch to the right of the umbilicus. Bullet's with ballistics. Vega's got the widow. They're ready for us.
Did he go by himself?
Can you think of any reason James wasn't wearing a safety vest?
Tell us about the bullet now. Striations, lands, grooves?
Oxidation takes a lot more than 24 hours.
Yeah, nothing we have says that it wasn't a hunting accident.
She was crying poverty when she was in the money?
We've got to find that bullet.
Yeah, and since the bullet didn't hit the tree, and the blood's to the west, then the through-and-through defines our search area. The furthest drop of blood is here ...  ... The spatter seems to be confined to a 45 degree angle.
Yeah, we've reduced a 360 degree crime scene to a 45 degree angle.
Yeah?
Well, he was out of work. Maybe he was trying to save money.
Whoa. Well, that's not worth the risk. Maybe he wasn't up here to hunt?
Right, right ... feeding time, it's ... when they're out in the open. What about other game?
Yeah, that's an odd time for a hunting accident.
Gunshot residue.
So now what? We're thinking murder?
He never fired his rifle. What'd he shoot himself with?
Yeah, not to mention whoever shot him would've been eyeball-to-eyeball. Who could've gotten that close without Mr. Jasper putting up a struggle?
Somebody he knew. I'm going to call O'Riley see if he's checked out Mrs. Jasper's alibi. I'll meet you at the car.
Hey, Sara.  Hey, how's your case going?
Yeah. Yeah, I know, it's impossible. But it's just a radiator cap so give yourself a break.
Hey, Sara ...  ... you gotta get out more.
Well, Mrs. Jasper's alibi checks out. She was at work from 2:00 A.M. To
Murder for hire?
This guy was shot in the gut. Bullet didn't even come close to his spinal cord. 
Wait a minute now. Abdominal injuries take time to bleed out. But it would've taken at least ten minutes for hemorrhagic shock to set in and he would've been mobile.
Yeah. Yeah, I see where you're going here. His injuries and his behavior aren't consistent with murder. But they're not consistent with suicide either.
Look, suicidals want it quick and painless. Bleeding to death is slow and painful. Not to mention, he never fired his rifle.
That-that's a big stretch. He brought his rifle plus a spare?
Yeah, but there's no blood trail. What'd he do with the spare, throw it up a tree?
Yeah. Yeah, okay-- heads up.
I just marked our search area.
You know, even if your theory's right, we still haven't explained the insurance policy purchased by the wife.
Hold up, let me give you a hand.
Yeah. I got it. I got it.
Whoa ... water pistol.
And the wife's out a million bucks.
Sure. Mrs. Jasper, when you claimed your husband's personal possessions, you signed a release form, yeah?
I ran that same form through our questionable documents lab and I cross-checked your signature with the signature on the insurance application here. It's not yours. Your husband must've forged it. I also checked with the insurance company. Your husband opened the account.
Yes, ma'am.
We work together; he can't outsmart all five of us.
Contained quarters first.
What is that, that whir sound?
Oh, yeah. Willie Hank's Don't Pay the Ransom. I'll contact the local country and western stations get a time and tape on when the song aired. Establish a timeline. What else?
Mm-hmm.
From what, a blown speaker?
Pulling all of the sound bottom right. Now if that were true the victim may have been sitting in the passenger seat.
Millander was driving.
He was killed in the warehouse -- and don't sneak up on a person like that.
He saw his dad killed when he was a kid over some money dispute. Ends up killing guys himself.
Check that out. Eight digit number with a dash.
Well, whatever it is it happened during the summer. Paper only burns itself into plastic in high levels of heat.
Something you didn't want. Or something you had to keep.
Pow-wow.
Later.
I put a call into three area country and western stations. Got the FCC list ... during the time of the victim's suicide recording KWV had Willie Hank's Don't Pay the Ransom playing from 1:47 A.M. To 1:51 A.M.
5:13 A.M. So that's about a three hour window. He was racing daylight.
Made the recording in the car killed him in the warehouse.
Yeah?
Speeding ticket? How long ago?
Summer.
909987-23...
Walker's birth date's on the ticket. August 17, 1957.
What about his driving record, Jim?
There's a few tickets.
Catherine wouldn't have left her stuff behind.
We wait. Right?
Catherine didn't say anything?
Kidnapping?
I'll call Brass.
I knew.
Hi.
How about if we just have a look around?
Wife was way too cool to have seen a severed finger. I don't think so.
Townhouse off Flamingo. Under the company name, not rented.
I'll get a warrant. See if anybody's missing a finger over there.
Hey.
Criminalistics. Anybody home?
Okay ... talk to me.
Too bad you can't talk. Maybe you could tell me where she is.
Good to see you again. Yeah, somebody hit the table. There's obvious signs of a struggle.
Blood pool here. Spatter all the way to the bird. Birds have blood feathers and flight feathers. Flight feathers don't bleed. No capillaries, just cartilage.
Discovery channel.
There's no blood trail from here to the door, so my guess is he wrapped her in something.
Checked. Bed's still made. Linen closet's full. Not to mention, a wet sheet leaks.
Why wash the knives and leave the wine glasses?
Yeah, looks like someone ripped the liner out.
Must've gotten dumped when she did.
Yeah?
No, man, I hate the stuff.
Mrs. Logan scolded her son for eating in the car. Peanut butter and jelly. Said her husband just had the car detailed.
Come on. 
You know that treating the surface with a carpet cleaner only pushes the dirt further down?
Warrick, you got those box cutters?
Did I mention how much I hate peanut butter?
Now he really has a problem. 
Why make the map? Why lead Catherine to the body?
Besides, there's always fingerprints.
Yeah, and he's probably long gone by now.
Why does that not surprise me?
Man, something stinks in here again.
Worse. It's all over my sandwich. Smell that.
You're kidding me?
Man, someone has got to talk to Grissom about this.
You leaving your experiments in our refrigerator.
Well ... 
That blood is rank, man.
I told him, he just ... doesn't hear it.
Sorry I'm late. D.A. Wanted an update on my robbery case.
The desk is crispy.
Defies the laws of physics. Fire's drawn to fire. Well, you know what we gotta do.
The guy who started the fire wanted to make sure the bedroom got it worse.
Well, according to Sara, 94% of all arsonists are male.
The fire burned longest here.
Yeah, right here. 
Could have burned off. Fabric would have fueled it.
Yeah, unless it was chasing after an accelerant. 
Warrick ... is that blood?
This fire is just a cover up.
Hey. Yeah, Warrick said the fire was orange so low-temperature fuel. Something accessible ... gasoline, kerosene ... I thought you were at the post.
So, anyway, this is where the fire started. Victim's bedroom.
Grissom ... Gris ...
Sometimes, I hate this job.
Well, our photo guys tell me those pictures were taken with Mike Kimble's type of camera.
Yeah. What are you doing here?
What is that? There at the bottom right corner? Is that a finger?
Well, that's unusual, isn't it? A professional photographer gets a finger in the shot?
I'll ... I'll see you later.
We've got some samples coming in. They're priority one.
Give me that. 
How'd we miss that?
All right, hold on. You mind if I talk to Jake alone?
I have a hunch.
Everyone does it, Jake. You just ... feel like you're the only one. Then when you don't do it, it happens in your sleep anyway, right? Yeah. And then you go to take a leak, dust off the equipment and just grab the first thing that's handy, huh?
Your sister's nightgown?
Yeah, that's rough. Rough. Well, listen, in the future, dude ... even if the situation's embarrassing, the truth's probably the best policy there.
Hey, listen, you ever notice your mom's boyfriend acting weird around your sister? Like a little, uh ... too friendly, too forward?
Really?
How?
Mm. Mm-hmm. You like the guy?
Hey.
You get anywhere with those fingerprints?
No.
What is it? A clock, a mirror? It's got a latch, a lock. A porthole? ... It's a porthole?
Easy come, easy go.
Lead the way.
Tiny scrubbing bubbles.
Had an interesting diet. Cowhide.
Yup.
Your waitress say anything about a needle butane torch, that sort of thing?
What do you think? Our guy having a little party with the waitress?
Well, somebody was here ... grabbed the stuff took their glass. 
Bet the contact wasn't his.
Whoa, miss.
Why don't you just catch us up there, boss?
Come on, Greg.
China white? You sure?
West coast heroin is MEXICAN BROWN. 20, 30% pure, tops. What's china white, 75%?
Doesn't make any sense, man. The money from dealing heroin comes from the cutting. The more you cut, the more money you make. There's no profit margin in selling stuff that's too pure.
Sure you don't want to start in the dressing room?
Hey, just 'cause I've been on a personal losing streak with the ladies doesn't mean you should be, too.
I'm talking about chicks, not gambling.
Mind if I go for her, then?
Warrick.
It's still yours.
I've got twins here, Bill -- one set of prints from your work card; another set from the drug paraphernalia we found in the dumpster.
Yeah, but you got him the gig. You didn't know he was a junkie?
Yeah, okay.
Hey, one more thing, Bill. You wear contacts?
How's that working out for you?
Hey, Sara. If you come up here on your nights off, people are going to start confusing the two of you.
What's up?
Marquis Mecke Froede.
The coasters test positive for heroin. 
He wasn't the only one with two coasters, man.
Remember when we talked to Lillie about the scarf?
She had a drink with two coasters.
Did you not hear me? She might be involved. You got to walk away from this fast.
And we will. What about her?
Then handle it.
You're nearsighted? I bet this is going to match the contact lens we found at the crime scene. Let me ask you another question. Why deal 91% pure china white? Did you have a beef with the victim, or what?
You're going to have to do better than that. You intentionally sold him stuff that was too pure.
Hey, do yourself a favor, slick. If you don't know enough about something, stay out of it.
You want to talk about it?
Okay.
Obviously.
I'm playing cards ... with my friend.
Paramedics just pronounced. Four dead, no witnesses. Coroner's on his way. Guy in the robe flagged down an officer.
Yeah? Well ... 
He's a quiet monk. Non-native, from Thailand.
Stippling around entry.
Close range. Looks like they were shot one at a time. How do you get one vic -- let alone four-- to sit still while you put a bullet between their eyes?
Yeah, for mercy. 
Interesting reading for a man of the cloth. That monk had it in the bottom of his desk drawer.  And he was the guy handling the money. You hide one thing from your brothers, then maybe he was hiding more.
Yeah, I'm just ... talking it out, Sara. What'd you find?
No, no, or read p0rn or commit murder.
Hey, whatever. Outside, inside. Why shoot four people, then leave the murder weapon behind the temple where even a blind man could find it?
Bobby D. Shot the test bullet through the rifle you found behind the temple. It's on the right.
Bullet from vic number three on the left. Lans and grooves align perfectly.
Well, we've got more than that. Sara and I found prints off the rifle.
Well, I'll give you a hint. He's bald, he wears a robe and he likes his coeds bodacious.
And a whole lot of bad karma.
Tampering with evidence is against the law.
Maybe, but a crime had been committed there.
Yeah, right.
Placa was carved into the panel with a straight-edged blade. Nondescript. Not much to work with. What's unusual is the placa itself.
Yeah, but after those German tourists were killed the Snakebacks were pretty much wiped out. The cops really came down hard on those guys. Twenty-seven members were put away for ... for murder and weapons possession, drugs, you name it. According to the gang unit, they've been out of business about a year.
Hmm?
Not a gang member, uh ... wannabe?
False clue.
Air Force?
Why?
Did you get his picture from outer space?
Hi there.
Yeah, I'm Nick Stokes. This is Gil Grissom. We're with the Vegas crime lab.
No, thanks. We're here about the murders at the Buddhist temple off crystal peak drive.
Sir, your vehicle was seen in the driveway of the temple around the time of the murders.
Good, we should go after him, then, 'cause the sandwich man's going to walk. His alibi checks out -- he was in Laughlin with his wife at a farmers market.
Took the van.
Yeah. Teenage kid, no parents, keys to a ride. I'm all over him.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Knock it off!
Come on over here, Rambo.
Wow! One pop to the chest and you're out. You got off easy.
Yeah. Not yet.
You the only trauma doc?
Yeah, mine, too. 
Only one on a tour bus required to wear one. Thank you.
Whoa, what are you doing here, Greg?
You're taking my notes. You didn't bring a warmer jacket?
How long after your scheduled stop in Barstow?
I understand that, Mr. Draper, but how long after that did the wheel start to shake on you?
Sir, are you okay? 
Hold on, hold on. Wait a second. Mr. Draper ... 
Mr. Draper, have you had anything to drink tonight?  Keep an eye on Mr. Draper, will you, for me? Mr. Draper, you sit tight.
Won't take a minute. I understand. I understand. Hang tight.
I understand. I want you to take a deep breath, and I want you to blow into the end of this for me, okay?
I need a doctor over here. Greg, get some help.
Greg!
Greg! Get some help!
It's all right, man. Stop apologizing.
That's why we have fielding training, Greg. No disrespect, but you're not qualified to be out here.
Yup. I remember my first time in the field. CSI One. Green as could be. Initial call was a robbery. I get there, triple homicide. Blood all over the place, mother and two kids.
You just do.
Okay, what's next?
What about the rest stop in Barstow 
I'll find out.
Well ... McBride's not on the bus.
Hey, Grissom. Cheap whiskey. Broken bottle. Brown paper bag. You know, I never gave the bus driver a breath test.
Seat 1C was the only seat with an unobstructed path through the windshield.
Laminated safety glass, pops in, pops out.
Hello, Mr. McBride.
You're telling me this guy wasn't intoxicated.
He could barely put a sentence together. If he wasn't drunk, then what was he?
On any medication?
Doesn't look like he was hitting the gym.
So, it's not the driver ... 
Bus company just faxed over a maintenance report. Bus was in perfect working order. Serviced last week.
Uh ... no.
A grade eight bolt shouldn't snap like a toothpick.
Yeah, I hit it with the tru-blue. It's not a grade eight. It's a grade five.
Okay. Driver hits the brakes, initiates the skid.
Another vehicle.
Man, there could be a million reasons.
Just this jacket so far. Passenger seat. And you?
Guy drives from L.A. Four and a half hours -- I got an idea.
Hand me that, uh, crowbar there, please. 
Thank you.
Ha. Bingo.  I always take mine out. Pain in the ass.
Yeah.
Wait. I've seen her.
Yeah. Yeah, I've seen her. She was in the accident.
Well, he didn't drive back to L.A.
He consented to lifesaving surgery, but ... signed a DNR.
Why chloroform?
How much later?
All right, to do what?
Bus logged into Barstow at 8:03 P.M. Target would be two hours later.
If not, it was sabotaged in L.A. And we've got another two hours and 13 minutes.
You know, if this guy Nolan ;worked for the bus company, his print on the wheel could be legit.
No.
Sure.
Hey, Catherine, I'll get that.
A little thick for a human hair.
Really?
I'll get it to the lab.
Why, what's under the bed?
No one's going to let me live that one down, are they?
Yeah? Well ... I'm short on options. Besides, the dry cleaners keeps losing my stuff.
Grocery bag with a red smudge.
You're kidding me, right?
I thought I got my hands on all those departmental newsletters. Where'd you get those?
Yeah, that figures. All right, listen, Grissom wants us to divide and conquer. Blond hair for you, Warrick.
Sara, you're on phone records.
Yes, you are.
Greg. Come here. I want to talk to you for a sec. 
Come on.
Stop invading my privacy, man, I don't like it. I'm just trying to do my job around here. I don't need the extra attention.
I didn't do anything, man. Someone from the community wrote a letter of commendation. Public affairs ran it. Cool?
Plastic bag from the crime scene. I'm trying to get lucky -- see if I can get some prints off it.
Horndog? It's a blast from the past.
She said that she was cleaning out the attic one day stumbled upon them thought she'd send them to me for a laugh.
No. She lives in Bosnia, man. Maine or something. She's got three kids. What's she going to do, fly in for murder?
I don't know. Something in my gut tells me it isn't right. Hey, what if somebody from work tapped into my e-mail?
Yeah. Maybe I forgot to log off one day.
No. I'm serious. Somebody had to have read my e-mail.
I already did.
Luna Cable. Good company, same as mine. One hundred fifty channels. I'm telling you, you got to get it, man. The last three weeks have been heaven.
Mr. Crane?
Nick Stokes, Criminalistics.
Mr. Crane, your door's open. Just want to ... ask you a couple questions.
The gloves, you find them?
Of what?
Who is it?
It's almost one in the morning. What do you want?
Yeah, maybe but look ...
I can't just let you in my...
Hey, hold up.
Sir ...
Sir. Sir ... You're going to have to leave.
Get out of here.
You saw my address?
I don't know.
Just ...  Hello?
Who?
Yeah, well, I'm not alone.
Your psychic's here.
Mr. Pearson.  Mr. Pearson. Mr. Pearson ...
Mr. Pearson, you back here?
Cops are on their way.
You wearing my clothes?
You know what? I'm a little confused here myself. Uh, why don't you refresh my memory. When did we meet?
You installed my cable.
Like you watched Jane Galloway?
A gift?
Yeah.
You watch me sleep?
No, no, it's, uh ... it's not my job. You should know that. It's the coroner's gig.
No.
Hey, now, Nigel, now we got a D.B. here, huh? You're going to help me with the crime scene, right?
Yeah.
You know I don't want to disappoint you, Nigel, but this isn't the first time I've had a gun in my face.
How do you want this to end, Nigel?
Yeah.
Why me?
It's not over for me. It's over for Jane Galloway.
Well, I'll take prints over people any day.
Okay.
Mm-hmm... I'm interested in any camera that covers Paige Rycoff's room.
Now, go back four days, one hour window 8:00 to 9:00 P.M.
Fast forward.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa -- hold on.
How'd you miss that?
Go back 15 seconds, replay in slow-mo.
Camera captures 13% more than we're seeing on this monitor. Picture condenses to fit the aspect ratio ... 
Mm-hmm. Show me the under scan. Stop.  Freeze and magnify.
Looks like he pushed off the wall ... tossed something on the lens. Prints over people. Thanks, man.
Knew where to look. How about you? 
We shoot, we score.
Hello. Got an ID off my print. I know who covered the cameras.
Hey, your fingerprints say so.
Why the fourth floor?
So what?
She dumped you. 
From hot to cold in a minute.
There's our boys about to move their borrowed furniture.
Okay, I think the table's set. Cab double-parked.
And he becomes the world's most patient cabbie.
13 minutes. 27 seconds According to the timecode. Close enough.  Let's get back out in the field. Tech can finish up here.
I'll, uh, settle in.
You know, that car circled the block six times between... 8:20 and 8:40 P.M?
You're up to no good.
You know, it's easier to get a master's degree than a parking spot on campus.
Right.
Yeah?
I know -- check the trunk.
Registered to Robert Woodbury, Philosophy Professor, tenured. Detail's almost got the latch.
Means hairs were ripped at the root.
She was in his car. It gets us closer to our suspect.
Hey, I think I got something here. Check this out. The whole dumpster's beat to hell. This one spot's fresh.
Possibly a hit-and-run? Means the vehicle had a high ground clearance. Maybe an SUV?
Still, why was Paige even down here?
There's two coats of primer between each paint job. Quality work -- probably a dealership.
Really?
Cherokee, '89 or '90. Three paint jobs, all factory stock. Stone white, flame red and there's your midnight black there.
Done. An hour ago. 
Hey. Brass just called. He's down at P.D. Paint to car; car to driver. Suspect's down there -- he's looking for you.
Your guy didn't hit Paige.
Or her husband.
Here we go.
I predict I'll still be standing here one minute from now.
You're thinking she accidentally dropped it down the chute. Then how did she end up in the dumpster?
Oh. Please.
Fatalities?
Yeah, I'll take the rig.
Check out this displacement. Detritus blew backwards. 
Right into the driver.
That's intentional.
So ... assuming Mrs. Tobin was the intended target the bomber knew what he was doing.
Another spring.
I do now.
Hmm ... hello, sweetheart.
Pipe bomb.
End cap at both ends. Either one could have come in contact with the explosive inside the pipe. I'll swab it see if trace can identify it.
A grommet? Inside a pipe bomb?
Yet the grommet's fully intact. How did it survive the blast?
And just when I thought you knew everything.
Hey. Pieces are small, but it's coming together.
Jonathan Claddon?
I'm Nick Stokes. This is Sara Sidle. We're with the Vegas Crime Lab. We're here about your wife's car.
So, I take that as a yes?
Will do.
You, uh ... you don't think too much of him, huh?
Get ... 
C-3 ... H-5 ... and three molecules of NO-3... nitroglycerin. The explosive component of dynamite.
Thanks, Greg. What'd I win?
Hey.
Well, you look ... 
Smug, actually.
Nice. I got the type of explosive used in the pipe bomb. Dynamite -- nitro and sawdust. The same kind used at Tobin C &amp; D.
Hey, if I were you I'd worry about my fingerprint. How'd it get there?
So, you're telling us someone broke into your vehicle and stole a single stick of dynamite?
Bomber fastened the cap to the pipe leaving behind tool marks. Check it out.
A vice grip.
Yeah. Let's get a warrant for Johnny Claddon's home and for Tobin C &amp; D.
Yeah, didn't even have to wait for my warrant. I just rolled over to Tobin C &amp; D and before I could say vice grip the senior foreman gave me every grip in the house.
Bad news, though. No matches.
No. And we're out of vice grips. 
Let's unwrap the Beemer.
You know, when I was 16, I begged my mom for a car. Swore she'd come through.
Encyclopedia Britannica.
All 24 volumes. Still own them, still use them. Okay.
Mechanic found the bomb next to the engine mount closest point to the driver. Bomb was on a delay. Clock with a ticking second hand and a nail driven into 12.
Question is, what started the clock?
Yeah, but we're only dealing with a 60-second time frame.
Mechanic offers to take a look.
Hood release.
Whoa. The latch has been blown apart. Which means the hood was down when the bomb was detonated.
X-ray vision? 
Sara, if you found a bomb in your car would you close the hood?
No way. BMW has built-in hood shocks.
No prints.
Well, if you were pawing all over the hood then your prints should be on it.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
You got any clay?
Well... we can't just take the tool without a warrant.
Cheese. Nice.
I'll compare this with our case toolmark.
A blast. Hey, man ... these yours?
Boy, you just have an answer for everything, don't you?
Striae are identical. Auto body vice grip was definitely used to tighten the end cap. Mechanic's prints on file?
Hmmm. Then what are you running?
Oh. Shot in the dark.
Really? Because we found your prints on a tool at the body shop. It was the same tool we know was used to make the pipe bomb.
Fortunately for you, you only worked Thursday nights, because your little plan took a lot of extra time and effort.
You snagged a stick of dynamite out of Johnny's SUV, took an end cap out of inventory, knowing we'd trace it back to Johnny if we found it. And then at the body shop, you put it all together.
Really? You sure about that?
You needed Marcus' help to wire the bomb and substantiate your story. So the two of you paid him $50,000 for services rendered.
So, you're both looking at, what, uh ... twenty-plus.
Lockwood.
Who called it in?
He see anyone else in the vicinity?
No tire treads. Whose are these?
Engagement ring, no wedding band.
Orbital bone looks fractured.
Could've. Hold that for me?
Down feather.
Shine that right here.
Grissom should enjoy this. Hey, Lockwood you got any food in your vehicle? Hamburger, anything like that?
No, gum'll kill him. I'll stop at the first place I see pick up some jerky. 
Will you get me a sample of the ground underneath the body?
Good.
This is the girl I found in the desert.
It's not possible, Dave-O. She was found in Diablo Canyon -- miles from the nearest water source. Lake Mead's got to be 20 miles away.
Dry-drowned?
She doesn't. She was engaged. The guy never filed a missing persons on her.
Okay. You mind if I have a look around?
Thanks.
Detective. 
Check that out. You see that?
Stacy had a head trauma wound. You wouldn't know anything about that either, would you?
No? How do you explain the domestic disturbance call to this address two weeks ago?
I don't know ... the neighbor who filed the complaint said you were really yelling at Stacy. Said it sounded abusive.
No. No. We got what we need.
How'd it go?
Yeah, the problem is the small amount of blood found in her own home isn't enough to prove anything, you know? People bump their heads and scrape their knees all the time.
That musclehead boyfriend --he's a little shady. He's hiding something. I can feel it.
Four samples: One from their swimming pool one from their bathroom, one from Lake Mead and one from Clark County Reservoir but none are consistent with the water I recovered from her stomach. 
Some rocks from under her body and a goose feather. 
The desert, yeah.
Really?
You sure?
Hey, that helps. I think I'm going to head out there. You want to roll? 
You're on call at court, right.
If it was a little kid or a mass casualty maybe we'd get that kind of manpower but hey, exercise is good for us, right?
Let's go.
Yeah, several layers, tempered cotton. This is a men's extra large. This is too big for her. Goose down like I found on her body. What's this? 
Ah. Property of Mr. Muscles.
Well, maybe he left a day later than he said for his little marathon, you know? Followed her out here, started arguing with her no neighbors around to call the cops.
She manages to fight her way free finds higher ground, he follows her, takes her down. 
You should try describing a scuba diver up in a tree, man. This is nothing. No, the evidence tells a story.
Everybody thinks they have a plan till things start to go wrong.
Then help us out here, man. I've got prior disturbance calls, her blood in the pool, her body drowned in the middle of the desert with your jacket nearby ... your map.
No. No, it's evidence now. You can put a request in for it when we complete our investigation, okay?
I'm getting this to QD. He doesn't want me to have this map and I want to know why.
Sounds good, man. Thanks, man.
Hey, Grissom ... 
Keep me posted.
Did you take a look at that maggot from e desert yet?
And?
You mind taking another look for me?
Why?
So, my maggot was stunted?
Yeah, but we found the vic in the desert.
Muchas gracias.
Come on in, Greg.
Hey.
News travels fast.
I'm trying to calculate barometric pressures here, G.
Yeah, yeah, I see where you're going. Last week in Vegas -- perfect weather. Warm, steady barometric pressure, but ... out in Diablo, two days before I found Stacy Warner's body ... 
Right.
Right. Humidity spikes up. Moisture in the air condenses.
I checked with the national weather service. This area got three inches of rain in 20 minutes the night Stacy died. 
Got nasty in a hurry. Nothing she could really do about it.
But it was too late. She drowns in the floodwater. Body gets carried to the base of the canyon. 
No evidence of the storm anywhere except on the vic who carried traced amounts of basalt rock with her and rainwater in her throat.
Stokes.
You sure about that?
I need you to get those results to me.
An accident of nature, yeah. But you still had a hand in her death just the same, didn't you, Mr. Hudson?
Why don't you take a break. Come on over here for a sec. 
You altered the map. You used the same color ink as the printer but the chemical tags in the ink are different. This is magic marker. 
And when you shine ultraviolet light on it like this ... 
... you can see exactly what you did. You made this look like an impenetrable ridge -- no way out, when it's actually a meadow.
Then why did you alter the map?
What you did isn't a crime ... but it is criminal, isn't it?
Yeah, I'll be above you.
Mm-hmm?
Well, if it's the same thing as a frat party yeah, lots of them. You know, you get enough booze going things can get pretty wild.
Multiple-partner wild. And it'd be no big deal to have two, maybe three girls at once, just ...
Hit on the rock glass. Work card. Orpheus hotel. Tiffany Langer.
Showgirl.
Was there anybody there you didn't know?
Do you know where he is?
So ... your date stayed at the party after you left?
Where does he live?
Why don't you give us his name.
You said he kind of looked like Ricky Martin, right?
Yeah, that's the problem with eyewitnesses. All the more reason to rely on evidence. Tell Warrick hey. Let me know if anything breaks.
Thanks. 
No. Nothing.
You, uh, you sure this is the vic's?
Ooh, pretty girl.
Listen to this: Babe, he's not good enough for you. He doesn't have the history we do. You mean the world to me. I know you'll live to regret this decision.
Hey!
Where's he going?
C'mon.
Well, it looks like lover boy isn't home.
I don't know, man. We don't even have a warrant.
What did you find?
That's Ashleigh James.
Yeah, we got a match, too, but it's not the vic's.
Someone forgot to clean these, too, for a long time. Positive for blood all over the place.
Hey, man. What you eatin'?
That stuff will kill you, you know.
And?
Ashleigh?
You feel like crap, blame your face.
So, we're not really talking about looks. We're talking about survival of the species?
Bad fat?
Evo'd?
Yeah, he destroyed Frank's vision of her.
But wait, that still doesn't answer how Ashleigh ended up in a shopping cart by the freeway.
Was he home alone?
Privilege doesn't extend post-mortem.
Why don't you ... just tell us what happened.
I take it this wasn't his first convulsion.
Catherine, we need to get a tape-lift here, please.
Mrs. Buckley? I'm Nick Stokes. I'm from the crime lab. I've been assigned to your son's case.
It's protocol.
I understand.
Sure.
I'm sorry for your loss.
Cause of death?
Injuries consistent with a grand mal seizure?
He's covered in bruises. Possibly from being thrashed during the seizure?
I found tan fibers on his boxers.
Fibers on his body and his underwear but not on his shirt and pants, why?
Okay, then at some point he was with his Shrink in his underwear.
Goat ... sweaters?
Angora is processed goat hair?
Must be a chick thing.
Hey, Catherine.
You ever been in therapy?
And you were okay sharing your problems with a complete stranger?
Yeah.
I hope it's a general.
What do you mean, we're lucky? We've got fibers on a 14-year-old kid and the shrink's clothing.
s*x with a minor. Suspension's a joke. Should have lost her license, minimum. 
Then maybe you should wait outside.
That's the funny thing about choices. Once you make them you have to live with them.
Dylan Buckley was just a boy. He trusted you and you abused that trust.
Was that blanket here ... on the floor?
He was a 14-year-old kid. What's the matter with you?
That's not what your rap sheet says.
We got what we came here for.
I'm on a case.
Right.
Okay. Thank you, David.
I'm thorough.
... but Dylan Buckley's levels were normal. I just got my own copy of the report. Dr. Sapien lied.
All I can remember doing afterwards is sitting in my room in the dark, staring at the door waiting for my mom to get home. But I've never told anyone before.
It's what makes a person, I guess.
I'm sorry, Catherine.
Come on, Greg, I thought you liked a challenge. What are we looking at here?
Father's dead, means we're looking at mom.
Doc? The kid in his underwear ... Tell us about the Y-incision. 
Mm-hmm. Head-to-toe.
He was in his underwear wrapped in a blanket fighting for every breath.
That's what every parent says.
Re-Birthing?
So, then what happened? Things got out of hand? He changed his mind?
So much for your ... therapy.
Excuse me.
Okay! There he is. Let's get down there.
Ready?
Stokes! Sidle! Crime Lab. Did you open the bag?
He-he. Nothing like flirting over a D.B.
You want to airlift the body to the coroner's. We'll radio ahead.
Let's see what metal shows up. 
Well, there's no gun on our dead body. 
What's that? There. About four inches long. What is that? 
Well, it wasn't from lack of trying.
Gambling chip.
Jacket. Government Issue, Army.
Human ... soup. Well, we are 73.5% liquid, eh, Dave?
What if we find the family or they find us?
Not for our investigation.
Yeah, in a zip bag.
Hmm.
Hey, how's Liquid Man doing?
You know, Sara, a lot of homeless guys get these army jackets cheap at salvage stores.
Okay. 
Ugh...
I don't know. I can't read an address or a phone number ...
About what?
You're going to need more than one.
Shut up. She was not.
Really?
Catherine?
No, no. You were the kind that guys fall all over themselves trying to impress.
Me? I was, uh ... I was dependable.
Mm-Hmm ..
No. Never a strap, never a smoker. Just all-around dependable guy, I guess.
I was popular with the right people, I can tell you that. I can also tell you what I wasn't. I wasn't a mac daddy wannabe with a Members Only jacket, putting his swerve on all the ladies.
Good.
You changed ...  But you still smell.
Let's go!
... Human fat never dries out, it just gets waxy.
I have. Nightclub for boomers off the strip.  Thanks, man.
Yeah?
Okay. Come with us.
Are you sure you haven't seen him around here? Wore an army jacket, might've been down on his luck?
Moses? 
You didn't maybe zip him up in a bag because he was giving you trouble ... anything like that?
Can I see your right hand, sir?
Hey ... treating another human being like garbage is not a job. It's a choice.
Rest in peace, Lieutenant. Rest in peace.
Zero humidity, record highs. 'Tis the season.
Wow.
He couldn't have climbed up there with all that crap on.
Well, you know ... Lake Mead is just over the hill and the copters are dropping water.
Okay.
After today ... oh, yeah.
What do you make of that void? Green vegetation.
Except for that one spot.
Well, well ... downed power line, huh?
Matchbook time-delay device.
That's the only reason I carry this stuff.
The difference between walking and running. Guy lights a cigarette, sticks it in a matchbook takes a stroll.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, he was dumped all right ... out of a chopper. Right, doctor?
Heart attack ... consistent with being scooped out of Lake Mead.
So, what happened to this guy?
He could've been clipped by the chopper's Bambi Bucket. Did you find anything between his toes? Like sand from ... 
Something on your mind, Greg?
Yeah. You want to make yourself useful, drop this off at trace. 
Must be some kind of soap. Robbins got me halfway there.
Yeah? State your source.
Sealed closed.
Hose melted. Catherine found it at the base of the tree. 
Guess it's like anything pressurized. These things blow for one of two reasons: Too much air or too much heat.
You just made yourself useful, my friend.
Oh, yeah.
Hmm?
Let go my Greg-o. He's a CSI wannabe. Please. Check out the bottom of this tank.
We had a little explosion here. 
Figure if I can get the serial number off the tank get on the horn with some surf shops track the renter through a credit card.
Well, we still haven't ID'd the vic, but ... it's worth a shot.
Mm-hmm. Embedded in his aconeus muscle. 
After you paged, me I had Robbins comb his body.
It's your theory.
But that's not what killed Skeller. Robbins said he took a line drive to the chest.
I'll call O'Reilly.
You had a dead body. So, you decided to get creative. Fire season, wet suit, liquid soap.
This gave you a head start. My guess is around, what, five-minute mark.
Actually ... you did. See, the thing you forgot about a scuba tank is it contains compressed air. Too much heat ... and kaboom.
Rocket Man.
Come on ... we always get better service when you're there.
You're keeping him alive? Sara said you guys already solved the case.
All right.
Nick Stokes, Gil Grissom, Las Vegas Crime Lab. You want to tell us what's going on? What happened here?
See that lividity? Blood settled at the time of death.
My bad, Sara.
Okay, make like a scarecrow for me, partner. 
Arms out, away from your body. That's it. Stay just like that.
Got some red fibers.
Victim didn't fight back. Probably didn't see it coming.
I feel like I'm mowing a lawn.
Zilch.
Don't tell me, more zilch?
No ligature marks.
Hey ... I feel a wallet here.
Ramirez Kenny. A 25-year-old Latino and a 42-year-old white guy?
Hey, O'Riley. What's the matter, man? A/C not working?
Yeah ... gas station.
You don't just miss something like that. What was going on?
Okay, all right. Just-just walk us through it. When did you know there'd been a crime committed?
I don't see any blood.
Murder scene was compromised.
A Lorcin .380. The same pistol registered to a Benjamin Jennings.
And we can prove he transported those bodies in his vehicle based on the blood you found.
We I.D'd the fibers using the FTIR. It's a polymer commonly used in vehicle carpeting.
They're identical.
Bottom line ... he killed them.
Excuse me?
Victim blood in his car?
It's our job to present the D.A. with the best evidence possible. Let a jury decide. Anything else, we're playing judge. The evidence doesn't get any better than this.
Right.
Misunderstood the priest? How?
Benjamin Corey Jennings. Nonviolent crimes.
Roger Jennings ... armed robbery. Past convictions, breaking and entering. Assault with Great Bodily Harm. Paroled 9/27/2000.
This guy is hard-core. He's looking at his third strike here.
You know how we pushed him to file on Ben?
We might have been wrong.
Nope.
Hey, guys. You can go ahead and take off. I think we got it.
Sara?
Could be red sauce.
I'm just trying to put our mistake to good use.
Okay.
Looks like it jammed, huh? Get anything instructive?
Any idea what he used?
We present this to the D.A.
The guilty brother's going to walk.
Hey, there. Warrick's got three residential burglaries, so ... 
According to O'Riley this guy's body language says he's guilty.
Autistic? You mean like Rain Man?
Kind of sounds like you.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Sir, you can't come in here.
Officer, Mr. Hunter would like to give a statement to Detective O'Riley.
Mm-hmm.
There's no surveillance system.
Do you have something for me?
Well, there's no smoking gun in any of these bottles. What's on the label is what's in the bottle. Isopropyl alcohol ... 15% ammonia solution ... imidazole ... bleach.
Hmm?
Is this guy the real deal?
Organized by size.
I'll check out the bedroom.
Grissom. You might want to come back here a sec.
Personal effects. Like some creepy little shrine. Vic's hair. She was seeing Hunter. Aaron got jealous. Incapable of deception, huh? How do you feel about murder?
Well, it's not pulling a spectra. It's not a chemical.
But it's foreign. How did it get in there?
I always thought you kept your p0rn in there.
Very impressive.
Yeah, yeah, which one of your relatives got you in?
Translation ... 
You just drew the molecular structure of a foreign protein. A Plant?
Biotoxin?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop now. Biotoxin, as in anthrax, smallpox? I was at that crime scene for eight hours, man.
What kind of symptoms are we talking about, here?
No.
Mm-mm. 
Western State Historical Society.
Hey, guys. That's Aaron's book, right?
Shouldn't you be looking at that under a fume hood?
What makes you think there's a difference? He probably cooked up that ricin in his kitchen.
So he cleans up well. What, you're not feeling sorry for this guy, now, are you?
Anybody else would be in a cell right now.
Veronica Bradley must have loved uniballs. She had about a dozen at her house. Plus every known piece of forgery equipment.
I also found this under her refrigerator. Funny how people don't think to clean there.
But if we find Ricin on any of the pens from her house ...
... we'll know where she cooked up the castor beans.
What up, Einstein? Ooh, you got anything there?
It's all yours.
Then she was chained up.
She was in the raw.
Yeah.
Sounds like frat house gravy.
Never heard of it.
I got it.
Sure, sure. I got it, man.
That's her.
She drove herself to work.
Hey, Catherine .... come check this out.
Liquid latex. Grissom found some on the victim. Sanders did a trace analysis. Stuff peels off like a glove.
Yeah. What do you think that is there? Watch?
I guess Lady Heather hasn't quite cleared this room yet.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Hey, hey. Liquid latex. Like the kind we found in the dumpster and on the vic. Hand me a bindle will you? You know what I just realized?
None of this weirds me out anymore.
Catherine, do you really think that those freaks out there, running around with their little dog collars on getting spanked are the same as you and me?
No way, never gonna happen.
Hey, man, my mom and dad are human, and ...
Security managed to return a few rounds. Nine millimeter.
Times have changed.
Did you get a good look at it? Make, model?
Car peel out?
Smells like burnt wood.
No. No, transmission fluid. But it's brown, not red.
It's not the right color.
You're a surfer now?
We're 300 miles from the nearest beach.
I got your page. Where's my report?
Yeah, thanks.  Type f with dexron.
So ... you should be reading Car &amp; Driver instead of Sand and Surf. Someone put the wrong type of fluid transmission. See, Ford automobiles use a thick red Type-F transmission fluid. General Motors uses a thinner, yellow fluid with dexron. Now, when dexron's put into a ford it thins that Type-F fluid. Friction builds, gears grind. 
The second gear is usually the first to go. Friction causes the engine to overheat, in turn cooking the transmission fluid turning it brown. 
Leak on the pavement is the first clue you've got a problem. 
Not just Ford. The getaway vehicle has a stubborn second gear.
My guess is it's already been dumped.
Hey, guys. I just got a call from Brass. We got a possible getaway vehicle off I-93.
It's beige abandoned, '77 mercury cougar. Mercury's a division of Ford. I'll drive.
Yeah. Check for treads, Jim?
If you were stashing a car, where would you hide it?
Oh ... check out that dirt displacement.
There isn't one.
Dirt to pavement, then the trail goes cold.
I'm not pulling it.
Yeah, it turns grown men into criminals.
Silica found both on Adam Brower's clothing and the getaway vehicle.
Motorcycle tracks at the vehicle dump site.
Yeah, that smells nice.
Adam, Tammy ... now Darin... all dead.
Shot with the same gun used to kill Adam at the casino.
Why did Darin kill Adam? 
That's confirmed?
So, Darin thought he was getting the whole score.
Maybe Tower Club surveillance missed something.
Yeah, before Tammy drew her gun.
Indirectly, yeah.
No, it's from his head.
Mm-hmm.
One, two, three, four, five, six.
Mm-hmm.
Let's run ATF.
Any names jumping off the page?
Who called it in?
Means he wasn't shot here.
Well, it's flat. You could still land a plane here.
Actually, we're looking at two.
Yeah, I've got fresh marks at the head of the runway two sets, both parallel, so ... my guess is one car spun out here ...
Yeah, well, I been here a while. Over there another set of treads going straight ahead, so ...
I think so, yeah.
Or street racing.
There's a reason it's illegal.
Midnight drags. My brother was a gearhead. Rebuilt a '65 GTO with three carbs. Ran the thing flat out. Zero to a buck-13 in a quarter mile.
No. No, not really.
The desert.
Centrifugal supercharger. Nice. 
Nos. Nitrous oxide system.
Regular air is about 20% oxygen. Nitrous is 40. Double the burn, double the power.
Check out that racing harness. Same as the bruises found on the victim.
We're all ears.
Michelangelo?
It's an odd name for a mechanic.
Michael ... angelo. Nick Stokes, Catherine Willows. Vegas crime lab.
Wow.
How do you know?
We're looking for the kid he raced the night he was shot.
Thumpy G dropped your name, man. Said he was driving a Michelangelo.
A blue honda, blue rims, tinted windows. 
Hold the phone. I've got what looks like ... ah. ...A nine-millimeter round. No visible body fluid. What do you think? Maybe a miss?
Spray it up.
Well, what about the rest of this blood? It's everywhere. 
Okay. Uh, let's back up and start over shall we, Mr. Masters? You and your brother were off-roading.
And you stumbled upon a wrecked racer out near Mercury.
Why didn't you just ... ?
Please.
Make yourself at home, boss.
Dumbass.
New glass - less tint.
Did you replace one of your car windows recently?
Before or after you fired the gun in your car?
The sunroof?
Well, sir, we have reason to believe this gun was used in a homicide. 
What do you got, Bobby?
Yeah.
Great, so it's useless.
Bullet's got splinters. Light glass, tinted glass. Thanks, Bobby.
Jace Felder?
Maybe, but why try to gun down Felder he in the middle of a street race?
Hey, wait, hang on Cath, give me a test fire, will you?
I wired the target to the car's alarm system. Gotta make sure we hear it.
Okay, remember full out the fifth then hit the nitrous and hang on.
And you weren't?
So, let me get this strait. You decide to become one of them. You buy a car with your mother's death benefit toss your hat in the ring and wait for your shot.
Took his title and then took him down. 
We beat Grissom here? That's a first.
Yeah, that's the least of this guy's problem.
You know, if you landed head first, there should be more blood.
Rain or not, I'm not finding any shoe prints.
No casings or bullets, either.
Sure looks like it. Hand to hand combat?
I've been searching high and low for a blunt object. Crow bar, two-by-four, brick, something like that. Nothing. But I did find this crack pipe. I'll get it back to the lab see if I can get some prints off of it. 
This roof's not that accessible, you know? Besides, coming all the way up here to get high and low. But still, little extreme for this part of town don't you think?
Okay.
Is the doctor in?
Hmm.
Hmm.
Was? What do you mean, that's not his name anymore?
Hey, man, you tell us.
And I spoke with Brass. That squirrelly tattoo artist had a record.
Drug conviction: Crack, cocaine.
Lab's working on it.
Hey, Doc.
Blunt force trauma.
Cyanosis? Body was starved for oxygen.
Okay, not beaten to death, not strangled to death. But something bad went down on that roof. He left half his head up there, man 
Yeah, but there's no evidence of anyone else at the scene. How do you suffocate alone on a rooftop?
He died in the sky.
According to trace, the yellow dust on Jimmy Maurer's leg was pinion pine pollen.
Pinion's a desert tree found in higher elevations 4,500 feet and up.
Yeah, it fits the bill to a tee. Think our vic was there before he died.
Yeah, look under what? Hot air balloons? There was nothing in the air. I mean, we can ...
Flying? You're a genius.
Pinion pine pollen, pinion pine pollen, pinion pine pollen.
It's amazing how simple it is. Air fills the canopy and you're off.
Well, it looks like it might be a rush.
Yeah.
The walk back?
How high do these thermals get?
Whoa. Yeah, the walk back.
The worst kind. Thanks, Rick.
And a paragliding canopy for Nevada. Ripped to shreds. It's mine now. I'll swab it for epithelials.
What's that?
What?
I'll check it out.
That sounds like a line.
Did it work on you?
Jimmy's leg loops are unbuckled. How come?
Well, I bet that didn't settle real well with Rick Weston.  When did you take this one?
And is that the canopy Jimmy normally flew with?
Where'd he get it?
And who's he butting heads with here?
Who's that?
And by the looks of things he was pretty competitive with Jimmy.
Is that Fred there in the yellow and white canopy?
Expensive price to pay.
Uh, Jimmy Maurer?
Yeah, I'll say.
Really?
Funny, that's what we heard about you.
That really doesn't concern me, Mr. Dacks. What I want to know is, did you fly with Jimmy the day he died?
We know that's you, Fred.
Uh, you know what? I'll take this one.
He's threatened by the guy. It's to keep from getting shown up, you know.
Hmm.
Who?
If we want to find out what happened we need to find that rig.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
Yeah. Now, the canopy's designed to soar. Has to fall downwind of the body. And at 15,000 feet, wind was northeast at 22 miles per hour.
Yeah, let's put out a broadcast.
Patrol unit spotted it on a routine traffic stop.
What have we got?
Bingo.
15,000 feet up, no helmet the only thing holding you in are two shoulder harnesses and a chest strap.
Uh-uh.
That makes two liars.
'Cause he knew how it would end up.
Jimmy never had a chance, man.
Don't tell me. Rick pleaded ignorance.
Really? Well, , that guy's wasting his money. Take a look.
These lines are spun polymer. They're lightweight, but strong as hell covered in a plastic shell; now, over time that plastic coating wears down. Unprotected lines rub against one another ...
...  weakening, fraying, until ... 
...snap! It's normal wear and tear, man.
Do you remember a case about a year ago? Diablo canyon?
Yeah. You fool me once, shame on you. You fool me twice ... shame on me.
Yeah, the bigger the cloud, the more air that gets sucked in the stronger the thermal. And check out our boys. Heading straight for it.
You catch a good thermal and you take it as far as it takes you -- dead or alive.
And to show Fred up, Jimmy had to fly higher.
Good question.
Yeah, I don't think it works, bro.
An experienced flyer, prepared for the altitude. There's no reason not to use his oxygen.
There it is.
I, uh, I think we're off by a couple of G's. I'll dust it.
In the air, you lose perspective. You have to trust your instruments 
You couldn't stand the fact that he was better than you.
Sorry, dude.
Whoo-hoo!
Fresh off an airplane from a conference, and bamm -- I got seminal fluid.
What's that?
I'll go have a little chit-chat with the hostess. They always seem to know everything.
Yeah, well, that's tourist trash.
Man! You find the best evidence in the nastiest places.
Whoa!
Obviously female.
Whew. I'll bag it.
I don't know, what do you think -- ballpark at 120 degrees?
Yeah, she's really torn up.
That all of this trash was found around the victim. And she was buried with some very expensive trash.
Home pregnancy test. Negative. Better luck next time.
They weren't shopping at CostCo. They paid way too much for ice cream.
Let's start trying to narrow this down to a neighborhood, huh?
Sort. Please.
First up: 178 Spaulding Meadows. Uh, 174 Storm Cloud Lane. A second 174 Storm Cloud Lane.
Hey, is this all of them?
What'd you threaten her with?
Yeah. Yeah me, too.
These two are human.
Yeah, and blood dripped down the side of this one as the hydraulic arm dumped it.
What's that?
Oh! Depends on what her business was, I guess.
Maybe she got it here. She could've met somebody, you know.
Okay, I'm going to fume.
I thought I messed it up, so I ran it twice.
No errant prints, all a match to the same woman.
No Amy Ennis in the database.
Prints came back to somebody named Kelly Easton.
What's the first thing you do when you don't want to be found?
Yeah ... and change your name.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry.
How's that?
I don't think your mom knew she was going to die, bud.
This is where I found the hairs, in between the packages of frozen peas.
And we found a warehouse worth of frozen peas at the landfill.
I'm thinking somebody in this family stuck her in here, waited 'til trash day.
Hey, hey. Check out these photos. The two stains on the inside of the shirt we found at the dump tested positive for Nora, but the stains on the outside, bloodstains, are definitely mom's.
Hypertrix? Sounds like a breakfast cereal.
Dot com ... dot bomb.
I'll need the access log.
Cool.
And since then, four people have entered the building, and nobody left.
Ooh. Hey, David.
I'll manage. Most computers dissipate over two thirds of the energy they consume as heat. A/C's here for them, not the worker bees.
Chief Technology Officer. T.O.D.?
Apparent blunt force trauma. Minimal seepage around the wound. No blood on the floor. The paramedics roll him?
Any sign of a weapon?
Yeah, but there's plenty of places to hide.
Okay. One dead boss. Three live employees. I like the odds.
Mr. Benton, could you stand up for me, please?
Charlie?
Could you hold your hands out for me, please? 
Pretty easy to see the door to the server farm from here.
So you make your computer watch other computers that other people are watching?
Yeah, you don't exactly fit the corporate image.
So your boss is laying there dead for five and a half hours plus, and you never even notice he's gone.
Working.
Right.
Explains the lack of spatter at the scene.
Killer knew what he was doing.
Possible transfer from a murder weapon?
You bucking for a promotion?
Yeah, yeah, that's what I'm counting on.
Hey, Arch.
Are these, uh, business e-mails? I'm a little confused.
Scared to lose your job? Your five-figure bonus? 
Yeah?
Hey, did you I.D. that scraping from my vic's head wound yet?
Okay, thanks.
What, then?
It's the right tool for the right job, man. You have to understand the world you're investigating. Hey, Archie.
Hey, what's that star trek episode where the guy's got the forehead thingy, and the time portal ... ?
I have no idea what you are talking about.
What is this, a video game?
You know a lot about this stuff, don't you?
You got to get a girlfriend.
Nah, it's more like a place where you can play god, right? Maybe treat people the way you wish you could treat them in real life?
You look a little uncomfortable, Mr. Molyneaux.
Upset about what?
How?
Then transfers the data to Kwan's machine. Big brother.
Well, knowledge is power. Kwan had his computer set up to auto-burn a new disk every night-- here. This was made the night of the murder. If we found out o was away from their desk at the time of death ... we got our killer.
Great. We just eliminated all of our suspects.
No suspect. No motive. No weapon.
A guy goes into a room with no windows and no doors. How does he get out?
Same way he got in. You know, there is one thing that comes in and goes out of here all the time.
Cold air.
Just black P.E.T., As far as the eye can see.  And a possible transfer.
Interesting choice of words.
You'd remember this company. It's where you killed a guy ... with that.
It happens.
Oh, it just came loose, huh?
Okay. Well, then how'd you pick it up?
Why don't you, uh, show him our grabby tool?
Hey, Grissom.  Got what looks like a semen stain. It's crusted, it's not fresh. Still, it confirms your theory that he's been watching her for awhile. 
Hey ...
Well, there are hedges outside of every one of these apartment windows -- that's built-in concealment. 
Yeah, this guy was having his own little private peep show. I ...
Yeah, and the semen sample I recovered is still being processed in DNA.
Whose?
That's probably from excessive masturbation. Guy's been outpacing his ...  ... sperm ...
It's just a hunch.
Hey, Sara. Heard you reopened the Winters case.
Flannery. Yeah, yeah. He retired and moved back to L.A.
It's shored. There's a definite abrasion ring.
There are two CSIs you never want investigating your murder -- the one on his first week, and the one on his last.
Hey, does Melissa know you're doing this?
She's been through a lot. You know how some victims are. They don't really want to know what happened. You know?
Well, go for logic. Some guy breaks into the Winters' house shoots 'em both and leaves his gun behind? Why?
Well, if it was really there, how come CSI didn't find it?
Yeah. Gravity only runs one way.
Hi. Hi, I'm Nick Stokes. I'm with the Vegas Crime Lab. There's a situation in your apartment complex you should be aware of. Do you mind if I come in, ask you a few questions?
Downstairs neighbor smelled it. Called the plumber.Yeah, they always think it's a sewage problem.
Phew!
Whew. No pain, no gain. Purge fluid.
Dead Upstairs Neighbor Syndrome.
Yeah, well, it's going to take us a while to get this smell out of our nose hairs.
East. Gets direct sunlight half the day. I learned that down in Lauderdale. You know, you've got to remember to turn.
Something like that. Nice little cocaine fingernail. So ... no mail built up. I don't see a telephone. What do you think? ... 
... Howard Hughes in a studio apartment?
Now what's his deal?
Yeah, I bet.
How you doing?
You want me to just...?
Hey, Doc.
I thought I'd come and get an update on ... Stinky here. Whew! Wow, that's horrible.
Yeah, I'll say. Hey, what's the foreign body lodged in his femur?
Whiter than bone. Dense like a metal. What exactly are we looking at?
Whew!
Looks like the tip of a needle.
Cracked my D.B.'S laptop. Got his appointment book.
You know, Croix had this sweet apartment and this wad of cash. We thought he was selling drugs.  He was selling himself.
Paid to get laid.
Ooh.
The micrometer pegged it as a 30-gauge. 
Well, the decomp's too severe. We'll never get anything out of tox or the needle.
Well, good thing my gigolo was organized. He used accounting software to keep track of his finances.
Hey, Catherine.
Yeah, if you or Lindsey need anything at all ...
Yeah.
Credit card transactions for Lady Heather's web site. Both our victims worked in the chat room. We cross-referenced their clients.
And looks like both victims died approximately four weeks apart.
Shouldn't we get the spike out of his head before we try to get any prints off it?
Well, he sure is dirty. I mean, he isn't homeless. This is his car, right?
How you doing over there?
Feces?
Under the fingernail?
He wiped his own ass?
Bat scat.
Well, whatever. It's a lot better than what I got. As far as I can tell, the wood's Douglas Fir with a side of god knows what. I'm no geologist, but these splinters are intertwined with some kind of mineral.
Oh, yeah.
Great. That limits it to every outdoor area in greater Nevada. Mountain ranges, mine shafts, quarries ... underground sewers.
Outer City Salvage Company. Owned and operated by Alex James.
Thanks.
When's the last time you saw a dinosaur like this? Lemons on the reels.
Old Vegas.
Buckshot pellets. Looks like he loaded his own.
What's that for?
Quenched it in the tub?
More precious metals.
Easily traceable.
Through-and-through.  Oh, yeah. Medium caliber. This is our primary crime scene?
Yeah, but he had a .38 in his car.
Hey, Griss, ballistics matched the .38 bullet to the gun in the victim's car. As for the splinters on the stake ... you were right. Quartz. Fluorite.
Well, the mass spec dug deeper. Arsenic and cyanide. Now, as of late, that's what's used to extract gold.
Yeah, hundreds. Including gold and silver mines in Nelson, Searchlight, Goodsprings. You name it. I've got Lockwood running a background check on our vic. Maybe we'll get lucky.
Now, why would he do that?
There lies the mystery.
What's with the gate?
Who puts the bat gates in?
What have you got?
Oh. Good.
They don't bite, do they?
Well, hey, let's ... let's not bother them, okay? I'm serious.
We're rich.
Another buckshot casing.
So, he was loading his own.
With gold. Pawn shop jewelry and melting furnace.
He was salting the mine.
Yeah.
Why?
Air's getting thick.
Yeah. But how did it get in the back of the guy's head?
Joe McPherson. Local. Mr. Mia. Not an organ donor.
You know, I was talking to a lady in the county records office. She said those land patents have been changing hands for over fifty years.
There's a sucker born every minute.
Homicide radioed in a D.B.?
I don't smell anything.
Science geek.  Takes one to know one, I guess.
Right, when carbon monoxide displaces oxygen in the blood, victim asphyxiates, turns ... pink.
You know, Dave, when I was a CSI-1, I would've tried to answer that, but now I know where before why. First step, find the source of the C.O. I'll grab the nighthawk, fire it up.
Carbon monoxide fills the air when any carbon-based substance is ignited. The kid checks out, so ... the point of ignition's probably this room.
Would've saved this woman's life. 25 parts per million. That's the highest reading in the room. 
This is a natural gas burning fireplace. Burns clean. C.O. fumes should be minimal at best. 
Foreign substance. Still warm. 
There was something other than natural gas burning in here.
Chimneys are designed to funnel smoke up and out ... if this fire was the source of the CO, the fumes should've traveled up the chimney instead of permeating the room.
Damper's busted.
Foreign fuel source in a compromised chimney ... I think we just ruled out accident.
No, I just figured I'd come by.
No, I'm checking upon my evidence.
Yeah ... Hodges, that's what I think.
The foreign substance in the fireplace is carbon.
None. Pure unadulterated carbon.
Used in filtration systems, kitty litter, some medications ...
And I got one Francis Crick. What's going on, Greg?
What have you been doing all day?
You mean smokers get a jump start on the poisoning process? Could explain the 10% difference. It could also explain why he lived and she died.
They were both smokers.
Well, not tonight, sir. It's still an active crime scene. Our lab found zolpidem in your wife's system -- 20 milligrams. That's twice the recommended dosage. Do you know anything about that?
So you drugged your wife to get some shut-eye?
It's also illegal.
I have another question. Did you know the damper on your chimney was busted?
You told your father you fixed it.
We know you took advantage of the broken damper. Placed activated charcoal from your fish tank filter in the back of the fireplace...
... then waited for your father to do what he does every night.
You killed your mother. You almost killed your father.
Well, you thought the charcoal would burn up, destroying any evidence of the crime, but your father woke up, called 911.
Approximately 45, 50%.
Yeah, but two people exposed to the same level of carbon monoxide for the same period of time, their C.O. saturation levels should be approximate.
Three weeks ago, your father quit.
The patch delivers nicotine to the blood, but since your father quit smoking cigarettes, his C.O. saturation level returned to zero. 
What I don't understand is why. Man, why would you want to kill your parents? Your high school told us you were accepted to Princeton, early action. A few more months, you would've been 2,000 miles away. Whatever your parents did to piss you off wouldn't have mattered.
So with your parents gone, you could sell the business and pay your tuition. 
Hey, Sara, I don't want to cross any lines here, but, uh, I've got this buddy who's not going out with anybody ...
Good.
He's a cool guy.
I mean, you don't ... 
Listen, just hear me out for a second.
Gone but not forgotten.
Hey, hey -- want to know where his drum came from?
The chemical company serializes all their shipping containers. That way, if hazardous waste ends up where it shouldn't be, they know where it came from.
A good place for a rave, though.
Robot rumble. Demolition derby by remote control. They got a show on cable tv.
As well as their bots. We can't have a murder without a murder weapon.
They're fast, they're powerful, and the weapon characteristics fit, so I can't rule them out.
Well put.
Yeah, join the club.
I'll get going on the tool marks.
No. Tool marks don't match the vic's wounds.
Victim's blood, three different parts from three different bots? That doesn't make any sense.
They usually have blood on them?
That's a nice ATV. You ever take it to the mountains?
Brian, Brian.
Hobbies take up space. You don't seem to have a whole lot of that here. Do you have a workshop?
This is Brian's bot right here. Smash-n-Burn. And it's got a spinning weapon. I'll take it in for tool marks.
And it's missing parts.
Rust stain.
Twenty-three inches.  That's standard diameter for a 55-gallon drum.
Catherine, I've got spatter.
I think we've got our murder scene.
Scroll up. Check the K'S.
Hmm. Hold it.
The rings belongs to you, Brian.
You want a tissue or something?
You disposed of the body. Cleaned up the scene, dismantled the bot, and sold the parts.
Smash-n-Burn isn't some cyborg death machine with a mind of its own. Man, you've got to drive them.
Yeah.
Okay. Here we go.
It's not responding.
Yeah, and in every competition, each team is assigned a different numbered frequency. That way, each driver can control their bot without interfering with anybody else's.
Yeah, and this is Brian's transmitter.
Brian claims the bot malfunctioned.
I don't think he knew that.
Whatever you did worked. Brian's going down for you.
The bot was on a different control frequency, which means someone was using a different transmitter.
That would explain why the bot was sluggish.
It's limited. Definitely not outside this building.
Maybe we've got motive.
Which leaves us with ... means.  Transmitter modules. 
Yeah, check out the 80s. 81, 82, 83 ... 85, 86?
I bet I know who's got it.
You didn't lose. You were destroyed.
And you wanted revenge.
This is the transmitter from Christian's robot.
So ... it's got your DNA on it.
Brian wasn't in control of the bot. You were.
No place to hide now. 
Detective.
Looks like a war zone.
I'm Dennis Rodman.
Bag it.
You find anything else up there?
Yeah. 109 rods.
How in the world do trajectories occur 15 to 20 feet off the ground? Horizontally?
Whatever happened to take one down, pass it around? That's the best part.
I know, I just dumped a sack of bullets on Bobby Dawson. So, why don't you sing me a tune I want to hear?
DNA? From the beer bottles? 
Just talked to Bobby Dawson. All the bullets came from the same gun: Nine-millimeter semi-automatic. How's this going?
I'll check the surveillance, see if we can get some footage of this guy. 
What is that on his elbow?
Can we see it?
Hey, listen, if-if you're the victim here, you can tell us. Okay?
Hey, Sara, I was just coming to get you. Surveillance footage from Jenko liquor. Archie just put together some black-and-white stills. Check it out. Kevin, the older brother, buying beer.
No, you're right. He had four other friends with him, including Timmy.
And here you go.
It's a classic distraction technique. Did it many times. You go in with a group of buddies and you cause a little ruckus.
Well, you know about the camera glass Warrick found, right? That means someone has this all on tape. I say we track down the other kids, see which one of them thinks he's Tarantino.
Soundbite Wescott?
All right.
I'll look for transfers.
Okay.
You coming?
All right.
I'm processing as fast as I can, sir. It would help if I had the dice used at this table.
I've got my work cut out for me then, don't I?
Proceed, sir.
Oh, here she is.
Are you serious?
As soon as it's processed they'll get a copy of our report.
I've never done a case where the defendant took advantage of that rule of discovery.
You beeped me from across the hall?
Yeah?
So when he blew on the dice, he blew victim blood.
Murder's messy, my friend.
If I want to present it to a jury, yeah. Nowadays, people expect a show. 
I should've gone to film school.
Yeah, Tonya's. Looks like Raymond was disposing of the bodies for your client. You think he ran out of time before he could move Kim's out?
No. What I showed you on video is Ray in the casino during the time the murders were committed.
Uh, Ray was caddying a dead body. We show him this he'll rat out Tommy Terrific in a heartbeat. 
Uh-oh.
I don't believe this. 
This is B.S., man. Total B.S. This guy, Tom Haviland's, got blood all over his hands ...
... and friends to lie for him! This is B.S.!
Hey, Grissom. Brass just called. They found the other victim, Tonya. Briarway golf course.
Grissom, you might want to come down here.
Beans and franks. Tonya's a man.
Thanks, Cath. You know, I've done this before.
Yeah.
I do.
Nicholas Stokes. S-T-O-K-E-S.
Oh. Sorry. I'm used to the old ones. 
Nicholas Stokes.
Damn!
Damn, damn, damn. I blew it. I forgot to put case identifiers on my dice photos.
Yeah. 
Don't look at me that way, okay? I wrote it down on the evidence envelope. I had to move fast. The casino manager wanted us out of there.
This is it.
This is the one.
I was sweating bullets looking at those photos.
No. No, just my credibility.
Yeah, he's, uh, he's in the men's room.
Hey, we're all in Nevada. It's legal; don't worry about it.
Truth is, it is compromised, Warrick. 
How do you take it?
Shoot.
CSI found what?
What changed?
Onward and upward.
People grieve in different ways, man.
What's the payout?
You sure you're not looking for Grissom?
Just a bathroom, a towel bar, and a dead woman.
Yeah, but the contusion to the back of the head was not fatal.
I don't know, Sara ... other people's notes, other people's photos, evidence twice-removed. No CSI even got to look at it.
I'm Nick Stokes and Sara Sidle over there and we're with the Vegas Crime Lab.
We're not really as concerned with the car, sir. What we'd like to do is look at your bathroom.
Like I said, we're with the crime lab. We're here to tie up some loose ends regarding your wife's case.
Right. 
I understand ...
It smells like fresh paint.
Did you replace the tub?
But you replaced the fixtures.
You selling?
Thank you.
Yeah, that bathroom's not the crime scene anymore. I say we go with the next best thing.
Model home.
Seventy-five units with seventy-five identical floor plans. I never thought I'd be grateful for cookie cutter homes.
You sure you don't want me to do this?
Yeah, but you're taller, thinner.
mm-hmmm.
Towel bar.
And it doesn't budge.
You okay?
You sure you don't want me to do that?
Okay.
Sara.
You want me to give it a shot?
Someone took a lot of effort to make this look like an accident.
Yeah, it's nothing personal, Doc.
No one's saying you missed anything. We have new evidence. We need to reevaluate the body.
I think I do understand.
Now, if she grabs you, use your free hand and hold her down, okay?
Well, embalming does ... 
Thanks, Dave.
I've never seen one like this.
Kills the bacteria, but ... mold feeds on it?
What's wrong? I'm not doing it right?
It's consistent with her fall. But it wasn't in your report.
They're in the beauty business.
Brass was right. We are looking at murder.
But ... this ...
... and this ... and this ... mean everything. The fact that you're left-handed doesn't hurt us either. Hurts you, though.
New evidence. Body was exhumed by a court order. Second autopsy.
Mm-hmm.
You staged the crime scene.
Civil charges.
This isn't the end of our criminal investigation there, George. It's just the beginning.
Where's the horse?
A hundred-pound woman trampled by a 1,400-pound horse? Doesn't seem very fair.
Changes the odds a little.
Yeah ... heavy artillery.
What have you got?
Mmm ... I don't know. Maybe she didn't want to get too close to a spooked horse. What about this food?
Looks like someone stepped in horse crap.  And what was the vic wearing?
That's a funky print.
Hmm?
What was this, a smoking flight?
Now, please, don't make me ALS.
Well, at least something made it into the trash can.
Hey, fashionista.
Brass collected all the shoes. You were right. Not only did we find a match, but I also found trace elements.
Horse dung all the way. Brass is bringing her in now.
Miss Fitzgerald, your shoe print was found in the cargo hold where Lori Hutchins' body was found.
Lady ... why were you down there?
We need a DNA sample.
What if the vet repackaged the diamonds, took them with him. PD traced him to the Caymans.
Ski instructor ... massuese ... geez. Is there anyone not on Harper's payroll?
Yeah, but she's got no reason to smuggle diamonds. Reward's not worth the risk.
A little old for a student.
Beer bottles.
Lover's lane.
She's been dead less than an hour.
Latent prints on skin, oil on oils, we're cutting it pretty close here.
I think I've got a partial on the ankle.
It's a generic econo-box. Might as well just paint a bull's-eye on it. You got the front?
I've got a ripped-up pair of panties. Possibly the vic's. Bag that for me, will you?
Whoa. s*x in the backseat.
What have you got?
Hey, who's working trace tonight?
Oh, great. Guarantee you that kiss-ass will have the results to Grissom before we do.
Killer had her in the car. Easy getaway. But still, why take her all the way up the bleachers, to risk getting caught in a room with only one way out?
Single woman on vacation in Vegas ... alone?
Who takes a tape recorder with them on vacation?
Hmm?
So, she knew Jason Kent. He wasn't just some random pickup.
Maybe she was a murder groupie.
Hey, Manson, the night stalker -- all those guys had them. I think for some freaks, killing's a turn-on, you know?
Run Jesus through NCIC. Cardenas.
The former residence of Jason Kent.
Jesus Cardenas and Jason Kent were two prisoners with the same taste in visitors.
Yeah, she visited Jason 13 times in the last 18 months. And the last two times, she also visited Jesus.
Mmm.
Yeah, and it's all cued up.
Nicer criminals.
Jesus Cardenas.
Jason's little girlfriend was screwing a guy he hates.
Hey. You back on?
Hmm. 
I'll meet you outside.
What can you tell us about Alison Carpenter?
You remember Jason. Two cells down. Hates your guts.
In here or out there?
We pulled Jason Kent's disciplinary file. He spent some time in solitary. His co caught him with heroin on two separate occasions. Once in, uh, '97 and again in '99.
Uh ... you-you know how these guys are. All they do 24/7 is figure out how to beat the system. We figure the drugs probably came from Jesus.
Yeah, they passed her around like a party favor.
I hear you think you're indestructible now, Sara.
Have you ever had a gun drawn on you, Sara?
Hmm?
Mm-hmm.
Did you cut yourself shaving or were you just thinking too hard?
Those are human bite marks.
And your fingerprints are on Alison Carpenter's body.
: He was only 34 years old.
Radio car's shot up pretty good. I'll dig around in there.
Radio car traveled about 15 feet after being hit. I followed the leakage back to its original position. Two in the hood, one in the windshield, Lockwood. High power, long range.
Thank you!
Hey, guys, guys, let's focus on the robbers.
I know.
The cookie comes out of a press, like a tortilla, and then some lady puts the fortune in the center of the dough, and then folds the dough around a piece of metal, and then folds it again.
You guys need a hand?
But I didn't get any lunch.
No, man, look at the blades. They're almost double the size of the handles.
Sounds like somebody wanted her to disappear in the rubble. Bet you Braun hired his own clean-up crew for that one.
Okay, Warrick, hit it.
White female, multiple bruising ... bullet hole to the temple doesn't help. .380 auto on the side.
Hmm ..
Hey, Warrick.
Check this out.
It's a little thin for blood, isn't it?
What do you ...?
Hummingbirds do love the color red.
No visible footprints.
Yeah.
Solo? 
So does this mean when I come in on my day off I get to work solo?
Whoa. I got what looks like two sets of prints. Ballpark in a size ten from the house. And what looks like a ... size 12, possibly from the pool.
There were definitely two guys here, Griss.
Oh, yeah, it's the pool. It's been doing it all night. 
First officer said it was clear.
Uh ... no.
I'll go in the pool.
Oh, man! Male D.B.
I mean, I don't get it. She's not even slated to work. She comes in on her day off and she gets to work solo.
Is that right?
Blam.
Blam.
Hmm? Oh, that guy in the mirror. Good. Archie, help us out.
Nice.
Looks like Augie was helping himself to a little bit more than the artwork.
Some hairs, may have found a filling.
Tributlyltin oxide, aluminum sulfate quaternary ammonium. Chemicals in the vic's lungs match the chemicals in the pool water.
Trace matches the side of the pool. No surprises.
Hmm?
Gives us possible transfer.
He may have transferred mildew from the pool to the house.
She was cheating on her husband.
Pool man.
The realtor?
Good. I'm almost there. Hang on.
Okay, I think that's the angle.
Back up.
Keep going. Keep going.
Big. Keep going. Keep going.
Well, go in the closet.
What?
What the hell is that?
You cannot be serious!
All the prints are accounted for by people who had a reason to be in the Newman house all the way down to the vortex cover. Warrick? 
Yeah.
Yeah, so all I've got is an errant blond hair, a tooth filling and some detritus from the bottom of the pool.
Yeah. I mean, I did identify some neoprene and it was white.
Yeah.
Not that I know of. The son can't even swim.
Scuba diver. Or a professional.
No, I mean like a hired gun professional.
Oh, hey. Excuse me.
Suicide among any disability group is above average.
This rope was identical to the rope around the victim's neck. It's used as a hand rail. 
Hey, Greg. GREG: Hey. NICK: Get anything off the rope? GREG: Yeah, a few brown hairs around the knot. Only one with a skin tag, though. And those fibers that Sara found on the body? NICK: Yeah? GREG: Polyester upholstery. Cheap rugs and tacky furniture.
So, present.
All right, fresh epithelials.
How long for DNA?
Well, I can't just give you her blood. That takes a court order.
We found your skin cells on the rope that hung Lawrence.
No, I'm not.
Then explain how your skin cells got on the rope.
Brass told her not to leave town. 
He sounded a bit like Jack Lord, don't you think? 
You have a cross section?
Hmm. No pigment at the central core. No color.
Okay. So, back to the midgets.
Well, you better do it fast. The convention's over in two days. After that, the Little People go home and we lose all our suspects.
Hey. Do you mind, little man? I'm trying to work here. Man In The Wheelchair: Really? NICK: Yeah. Man In The Wheelchair: You making any progress, CSI man? NICK: Some. Man In The Wheelchair: Uh-huh. Are we getting your A-game or your B-game?
Come again? Man In The Wheelchair: You see us little people we're used to getting the short end of the stick.  You don't get to laugh at that. 
Well, a man was killed; that's no joke. 
He looked like he fit your profile. So, I asked around. Two little people confirmed he has C.H.H.
Did you know your father killed Lawrence?
Hey, did you get anything else off that laptop?
Victim was paralyzed, couldn't fight back. Kevin Marcus puts the rope around his neck makes a slip knot.
No way he could've reached it.
Changing my perspective.
Oh, man. Can you imagine going through life at this height?
... adapt yourself to it.
Where's Grissom?
We know how he did it.
Pekinpah. Back in '93, first album was a moderate hit. Don't you remember that song, it was pretty popular-- uh... Symphony of Epiphanies? 
Well, he just lost a lead singer.
Ooh ... rock and roll, baby.
It's a shame, man. He had a good voice.
No vomit around, either. That's a first for me.
How'd he do that?
The tourniquet. He's obviously left-handed if he shot up in the right arm. If he tied it off himself he would have pulled it towards him, like so. It's tied the other way, pulled away from him.
You really shouldn't be in here, sir.
The videotape from last night's show has you ... wearing this.
So, it was used as a tourniquet on Gus' arm.
Okay. When was the last time you saw him alive 
I talked to your manager, and he said Gus was clean.
Crazy?
I obtained Gus's medical records from L.A. that said he was treated for depression. You guys know anything about that?
Where did you hear that?
Who, the singer, Gus?
No more Pekinpah; no more money for the band.  Why don't you get back on the internet for us? See if there's any gossip floating around.
I showed the road manager a copy of the warrant. He went nuts. He's on the phone with his lawyer right now.
This doesn't work.
Yeah, but this doesn't work, 'cause the batteries suck.
Belongs to the guitarist. Looks like Mr. Clean and Sober had a habit.
Yeah. You, uh, trying to make a call?
What's up, G?
And?
Who's planning the album?
The guitarist?
I'm chasing the smack.
Did you give some to Gus last night? 
Needle, too?
Well, Keith ... 
... think Gus would get messed up enough to kill himself? That'd help you sell a few more albums, wouldn't it?
What?
Where?
And?
Really? Hmm. So ... groupie? 
Was it a red door?
So, you never met Gus Kenyon?
You sure? We know he was here. We matched the paint from your door to the paint on Gus's ring.
Miss Dean, you're a Registered Nurse, is that correct? That means you have access to medical supplies. Needles?
Gus left here and he went back on the bus. He thought about doing some of Mr. Castle's drugs but he didn't. He said he just passed out from the booze. 
But you, you've been around heroin before, haven't you? You know how to cook it. Did you think you put just enough in the syringe to make it look like a suicide?
No. No, we're just here for your son's DNA.
Hey.
People are pigs.
Doesn't seem like the same house.
Trying to keep something out.
Guess they weren't much on family dinners.
A gi and a black belt.
I'll bag it.
Glock. Laser sight. Slide's missing. Mr. Reston was a bit of a garage tinkerer.
Hey.
Okay, we're into it.
Mm-hm. Do me a favor?
Inside, bloody towel, bagged and tagged.
Thanks.
There's our M-11. 16-round magazine. Two remaining. One in the chamber. Modified to fully automatic.
Missing girl's old man's got blood all over him. Blood in her room ...
Hey, Griss ... found a density change. The screen's showing something.
Two and a half feet.
Yeah.
Well, we got something else to hold Reston on: Illegal burial of a domestic animal.
I'll cover him back up.
Yeah.
Vehicle upholstery.
You can't carry a body in plain sight on campus even in at night.
Well, that kind of narrows it down.
What, from the busted security light?
Okay, the guy broke the bulb on purpose.
Suspect's minus one point two five.
Okay, I'm getting this to trace. Hey, check out the vehicle's upholstery. It's black and it's a Chevy ... 
Yeah, well ... maybe he's thinks he's some kind of smart guy you know, covering all the bases.
What's that?
Wonderful.
Thanks.
Smash and grab. Left that behind.
One. Yeah. Waited till the manager was alone knocked her down and hopped the counter. Got away with a whole sack full of stones. It takes some stones to pull off a job like this.
Yeah?
What's it highlighted for?
Which was stolen along with the other items, right?
Sorry, mediation's not really my thing.
Mm-hmm. O'Riley? Stokes, listen, I'm at a smash and grab. Lots of glass, a little blood. Do me a favor: Check the local hospitals. Anyone comes in with a forearm laceration, it could be our guy. Thanks, man.
Hi, there. Where'd you get the cut on your forearm, man? You practicing for a job at Benihana?
Well, you don't get any privileges, Randy. You're wearing stolen property.
Yeah. We arrested the guy and recovered all the jewelry.
Not a problem. I just need you to fill out some documentation and then I can release your ring back to you, okay?
Sir, I matched every item recovered to a log provided by the jewelry store piece for piece.
I need to explain to you?
Man, I would N ... 'cause that's not the way it works.
Are you making a formal accusation?
Knock yourself out, Big Dog. Forms are at the front desk.
Yeah, well, it's not done yet, but ...
Oh, yeah, it was a little rough. We had to check a few ER's, but we snatched him up.
Yeah. Why are you tossing me a softball and putting everyone else on real cases?
Yeah, but it's like Night of the Pifflings out there and I'm on a smash and grab. 
Puffin offspring. First time out of the nest every year they crash land in this town near iceland because they are attracted to the lights of human civilization. It's the same way people flock to Vegas for a fight.
How come when you talk about bugs everyone says you're a genius but when I talk about birds everyone says I watch too much television?
Copy that.
You know what? You should apologize. But not for your husband.
You know damn well your diamond isn't a diamond. It's a substance called moissanite.
Really. White light refractions and inclusions of your stone are inconsistent with a real diamond's. 
The thief ... Yeah ... I don't think so. Because before the store could clean your ring I was able to collect DNA.
You know, it's my guess you switched out the stone some time ago because judging from your husband's response he knew nothing about it.
I'm a criminalist for Clark Country, Nevada.
So you can file a false insurance claim which is a felony? Better yet, why don't I have an adjuster come over to your place and check out all your rocks see which ones are real and which ones you've switched out? No? Look, if you find yourself in a hole, the best thing to do is stop digging. You know what I mean?
Put it in motion.
What the heck is that?
Carbon steel. There was some rust on it.
Well, you found some stab wounds on the vic, right? Underneath all those ants? Maybe it's somebody's old scalpel.
Geometrical extrapolation?
You got a pencil?
From the tip down, the slope looks to be slightly curved. Now, if I extend that trace outward ... 
What do you think? Blade of saw ... 
You see how the base of the fragment curves downward? Suggesting something circular. 
Repeating pattern. Circular saw, maybe.
Wait a minute.  I've seen one of these before, man. A spur ... cheap spur.
Yeah.
Yee-haw.
You ever ridden a horse, Grissom?
Who mucks your stalls now?
A former employee of yours was murdered. Now, who mucks?
Stubs. What is that, some kind of nickname?
Do you ride, Mr. Vasquez?
You wear spurs when you ride?
I'm going to need to take a look at those spurs, Mr. Vasquez.
Enrique said he got those boots an spurs from Hero's Row.
And they just leave them there for anyone to pick up?
Hmm. Mr. Banson, the pro Rodeo Association banned sharp rowels on spurs back in the early '70s because they were found to be cruel to horses.
This would be a pretty cool little truck if it weren't for the shiny new toolbox.
Pro rodeo Association.
But you live here normally, right?
19 months ago.
Your ants put the time of death at 19 months Rattison puts being out of town at 19 months yet Randy Traschel's been missing 17 months so...  ... now what?
Yeah ... so ... back to the bugs?
Ahh.
So it's like slicing the mold off of bread ...
Spur exposure time was exactly 17 months.
Missing persons was right. The ants were off.
Two feet.
We're looking for horns with points attached.
Eighteen inches.
Positive for blood.
Room closest to the exit. Imagine that.
Take the exit.
Hey, guys. How you doing? Uh, I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab, and I'm ...
Yeah.
Kenny. 
Hi, Kenny!
How you doing, man?
Good to see you.
Yeah. Yeah.
Uh, Crime Scene Investigator. I'm on a case.
Right.
Yeah, actually, uh, she had her throat slit and bled out all over the room. I'll know more when I check the surveillance camera.
Uh, I'm just checking possible escape routes. She was murdered in the room closest to the exit. Murder Central.
Hey, Warrick. Take a look at this wound. It's different than the wife's. She was cut from the front.
Use this, uh ... cash-advance check Warrick found as a reference.
And compare that to the print I pulled off the exit door and the knife ... please.
Here you go.
What the hell?
Kenny Richmond, that's what.
This valet at The Sphere. I played baseball in college with this guy. I bumped into him for, like, two seconds.
Hey, it's not like I ran my mouth to the press, okay?
'Fess up to what? There were a hundred people at that crime scene. Anyone could have gone to a reporter and told them what was going on with the case, man.
Yeah. What, fifteen buckets?
Yeah.
Yeah.
You want to talk?
You know, if it's anything like the Sphere, we're probably not going to find much.
Bathroom's clean.
Haven't you ever seen one of those before?
Magic Fingers. Twenty-five cents for 15 minutes of vibration. Died a slow death in the '70s due to vandalism and seedy connotations. Good for s*x. Good for sleep ... too.
And their prints on those coins.
A reporter got some inside information. Killer probably heard about himself on the news, changed his mo.
I should probably get those quarters back to the lab, work on the prints.
Hey.
Yeah?
Is it a mixture of more than one stain?
Oh.
Chances are that's our killer.
Mandy Klinefeld. 11546 Blackbird Lane.
Mandy and Cameron Klinefeld. I just pulled their license photos off the DMV. Brass showed them to the motel manager. Couldn't I.D., so ... APBs are on the horn.
Come on, Grissom. It's got to be them. Who stays at a motel when you live here?
That explains the thumbprint I found on the exit door leading to the garage. What, they take him for a walk?
Did anyone at Shimmer I.D. the Klinefelds?
Uh, we've got prints on quarters.
Grissom ratted me out, huh?
I guess I'm learning that the hard way, huh? 
Hmm. Did you see that? That was a little tongue action right there.
What about the ice man?
David ... whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Good. Good answer.
Any minute now.
Whoever was in his ear was on that ice machine. She's the killer.
Fellows.
Do we know who shot her?
Nobody saw anything? Nobody heard anything?
Somebody's lying.
That the husband?
Interesting family reunion. Whose brilliant idea was that?
Don't you hate it when hello leads to gunfire?
I'll need to GSR both.
Sir? I'm going to need to test your hands for GSR.
Gunshot residue.
To rule you out.
Thank you.
Explains why she just dropped.
Well, it looks like a nine millimeter. I'll let Vega know.
Sure.
Four inches? That's shallow. Standard handgun bullet penetration's twelve.
Give me a hand, will you?
Eighty-five degree downward angle?
Oh. Thanks, doc.
That's not definitive. One of them still could have fired the gun and washed his hands.
Hmm.
The only reason for shallow penetration is loss of momentum.
So, assuming that the bullet didn't come in contact with any intervening object, what slowed it down?
Hey, Catherine, feel like doin' some real work?
I got a woman who DFO'd in front of her house trying to break up a fight. It's a single gunshot wound to the chest. The penetration is ... shallow. I want to know why.
Oh, yeah.
Standard velocity is 1,100 feet per second.
500 and ... 50 feet per second.
Now that we know the speed, we can calculate the distance. Thanks, Catherine.
How far does a nine millimeter bullet have to travel before it slows down to 550 feet per second?
Yeah, that would pretty much eliminate anyone that was in the Mitchell's front yard. Can a nine millimeter bullet even travel that far?
That would account for the distance, but ms. Mitchell was shot at an eighty-five-degree angle. That's basically perpendicular.
People ... aren't.
I assumed she was standing.
Okay, this is the Mitchell's house,
... and by all eyewitness accounts, she was standing in front the house, facing away north, when she was shot, so this line represents the 1,800 feet our bullet traveled.
It had to have come from somewhere ... on that arc.
Just curious.
And this is the gun that you fired?
Empty ten-round magazine.
I, uh, only count nine holes in your target.
Oh, you didn't miss.
You see, your neighbor didn't lose her kid, but six blocks away, a guy lost his wife.
And that's why it's illegal to discharge firearms within the city limits, genius.
Thanks, man.
Detective. Hey.
Yeah. Sure, what's up?
Wow. Um ...  ... yeah, I remember uh-uh, Rita?
Found nothing suspicious. Nothing criminal. Figured she wanted to skip town, disappear.
Faye, it's been four years since your sister went missing. Now, CSI conducted a full investigation -- found nothing suspicious, nothing criminal. Why are you coming forward now?
Okay. Let's start from the beginning. Your sister disappeared over a weekend ... 
Now if memory serves, her husband had an alibi?
That's his business partner, right?
Do you know what Aaron did with Rita's body?
You were the other woman.
File's thinner than I remembered.
We figured she skipped town, wanting to disappear. At the time, that was a reasonable conclusion based on the evidence.
Well, if she's lying, she's obstructing justice and wasting my time, but if she's telling the truth, we may have closed the investigation early.
Yeah, it would have. I'm checking out her story. I'll see if it holds up.
Mm-hmm.
Right here?
Well, if Rita's body was incinerated here, the gasoline fumes would have settled into the soil...
...and trace amounts of hydrocarbon would still be detectable.
Mr. Dorsey.
There are no hydrocarbons. Damn. 
There's no evidence of gasoline whatsoever. Where's Hodges?
What rumor?
He gave Sara ... ?
Well, science seems to have trumped the eyewitness. That story doesn't hold up.
You withheld information.
They why didn't you tell us about your younger sister?
Did your relationship with Aaron end amicably?
It was muddy?
Okay, was it raining?
No. So I stuck a moisture testing probe into the ground at the burn site, registered 18%. Now anything over 10% is indicative of full saturation over the last couple of years.
Exactly, but before it washed away, some of the hydrocarbons could have seeped into the ground into the tree's roots. Roots carry nutrients to the tree. Some of the hydrocarbons could have hitched a ride. Oaks don't bear fruit, but this one bears witness. 
Every year, a branch grows a new ring composed of alike, dark band. Counting from the outside in, going back four years -- one, two, three, four ...
Yeah, the same distortion is present in ring four of every branch.
I'm thinking the burning of gasoline under the tree.
Saw dust.
Affirmative for hydrocarbons. Now we're talking.
Yeah.
No, no, not exactly, but we have a potential new lead. 
Uh, yes, ma'am -- eight ounces from Mr. Westonson's pump.
Say hello for me.
Fuel pump's behind the barn, right?
I was standing right here four years ago asking myself the same question. 
You know, Aaron Westonson's right about one thing. Back then Grissom and I processed every inch of that house and this barn and found no signs of a struggle.
Yeah, it would've been over before it started.
Okay, fill her up.
It's an EPA requirement. Farm's don't have to pay taxes on fuel, so refineries, they mark their agricultural diesel by dying it red.
Trace Tech. He analyzed the fuel from Aaron's pump. Confirmed it's diesel. The hydrocarbons found in the tree were from unleaded gasoline.
Ah, I thought the same thing myself, so I called the NDEP.
The permit for Aaron's fuel tank was specifically for diesel. 
NDEP's database for Clark County. Now, the red dots represent the areas of permitted fuel tanks.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Only two permitted fuel tanks up in that area. The one on the left is Aaron's. We can exclude that one .
Faye Minden.
Hey.
Yep.
Yeah. Yeah, you wouldn't mind, would you, Faye?
Yeah.
Oh, he didn't say anything. Just want to take a look.
The pump on Aaron's farm is diesel. Your sister was cremated with unleaded.
Excuse me.
I believe you, Faye. You see, blood evidence doesn't disappear over time. Your sister was murdered ... by you.
Unleaded gasoline, barrels for incineration, cast off on the walls. DNA consistent with Rita Westonson. 
Faye killed Rita to be with Aaron. And a couple of weeks ago, hears he's getting engaged to her younger sister Terry. They couldn't handle it, man. She just freaked. So she tried to pin Rita's murder on Aaron.
Well, you were following protocol.
Now I'd fight you on it, yeah.
Rita Westonson was a dependable, predictable girl. We never answered the question why she just woke up one morning and walked away from the rest of her life.
Well, that's what the physical evidence was telling us. We should have dug deeper. You can't just ignore the human element, Grissom.
So what? You know, I'm always getting criticized for empathizing with the victims and their families, but that's who I am. That's how I do my job. And as far as the promotion goes, it's all good, man. I can live without it. I'm not you.
Weird night.
Yeah, it's a CPR demonstration dummy. Fully articulated.
Yeah. You know, paramedics, firemen -- they use these things to teach lifesaving techniques.
Oh, no, no, no. Been in the water way too long, man. Sorry.
Grissom, ... 
I got a hit on your partial print from the hotel employee database.  Brandon Miller. He's your duct-taped security guard.
You tell me.
There's our man.
3:15 A.M.
Yeah, you really can't get a good look at him from any angle. He's walking like he crapped his pants.
It gets better.
There's over three thousand employees who work at the Mediterranean, and this guy is not really giving me much to go on here.
Will do. You missing anything else around here?
CPR dummy.
Is this Macaulay?
Hey. 
Sure.
Grissom, how's our insurance?
I was being careful, I swear.
Do you think someone switched swords on us?
The paint on this mask is coming right off, layer by layer.
So it's not just the sword. This ... his whole collection's a fake?
Vintage cherry red leathers, bronze pvc fabric, aged. Countless furniture and clothing suppliers. Nothing really unique.
Only about half a dozen us importers. One did recently make a sale to a business in Las Vegas.
Chen's scenic prop house -- owned by Graeme Chen of 1 Engelfield Road, Las Vegas, Nevada. Also his place of business.
Hey, Grissom, check this out.
Yeah, definitely.
Looks like Mr. Chen tried a few times before committing.
So, Mr. Chen made their costumes, their props and their scenery.
No.
Coincidence?
A lot.
How long is the surveillance loop?
What, uh ... what happened to these tapes here?
These are active cameras, right?
Right.
Yeah.
Okay, here's what I got so far ... there's our two DOA suspects. Looks like they just walked in off the street.
No. All the cars in the parking lot were accounted for, and the loading dock out back was deserted, so ...
... this is the only view of what went down.
And see here? Here comes our cop.
Three, four feet away, doesn't even see him. The thing I hate the most is the bad guys always know if there's going to be a gunfight.
Double counts, two people in the room at all times. When you're done, match the total amounts with the register receipts, okay?
See that light? It's called a halo. It's keyed to the sensor in the cash register. Now, at a preset amount, that light goes off, letting the store manager know it's time to transfer the cash to the safe. Now check this out ...
Maximum cash, just lying in the drawers.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, guy slips in after everything gets started. During the confusion, nobody sees him. Or no one that was alive to tell anyway.
Yeah.
Oh, no doubt. Matched the cash from the garbage bag to the register receipts-- $878 was missing.
Well, I'll run the employees. Maybe somebody's got a record.
Hey, y'all. Ran the criminal records for the employees. Came up with a Raul Valdez. Freight loader.
He clocked in for work that night. Never clocked out.
Here's the kicker. A few years ago, he spent some time in prison. Lompoc. So, Brass is trying to find him now.
Hey, Catherine, how'd it go with the bag boy?
Then I have something you should see. I was going back through the surveillance tapes covering the loading dock, thinking I might find someone scouting a blind spot, you know? But instead, I found this. Two nights before the robbery.
There. See that?
Yeah.
That camera's stationary, so ... 
Mike Trent?
Boy, he's a big dog in the club world. Rumour is he paid Lil' Kim
Hey, uh, let me have one of those, Sara.
I thought you moved into communities like this for this not to happen.
Hey, Grissom. What do you got?
I'll check the rear for any sign of forced entry.
No sign of disturbance in the rear.
You still sucking on that same cough drop?
So, assuming the killer didn't live in the community, how did he gain entry?
And bail on bikes. That's a little low-rent, don't you think?
Ah, no one's the wiser. Okay, I get it.
Sara did find an orange peel in the side yard. What do you think, sticky fingers?
Sure it will, if it's derivatized. Do you have any fluorescent reagents?
Amino-Naphthalene Trisulfonic acid.
You're trying to stump me. I can feel it.
Hey, you can set 'em right there.
Sugar on the handlebars of both bikes. Just like the keypad.
We could check the serial numbers, but they're usually not recorded.
Hmm?
What are you doing?
Now how did you know that receipt was in there?
Good for you. Bad for Ross Davis, though.
Hi.
No, I'm Nick Stokes. I'm with the Las Vegas crime lab. Can I talk to you for a second? 
Are you Missy Wilson?
No. Your Manager said you were working breakfast the other day at the pick-up window.
Do you remember this guy?
Sounds like he wanted to make an impression.
One thing at a time. Now this window ...
Does this window have a surveillance camera?
Confirms his alibi. Every suspect Brass leans on seems to have a case of the airtights.
I don't know. Let's enhance it.
Hard to tell, but, it almost looks like a canteen.
I'll pull some stills, see what I can make of it.
I finished up on those still photos. The canteen around Little Alex's neck ... is really a set of binoculars.
If you keep flipping, it tells the rest of the story.
Now, call me crazy, but it looks like daddy doesn't like the little man wearing the binoculars around his neck so much.
What are you thinking?
Yeah?
Back where Mike Trent was shot?
How's this? Can you see me here?
Mm-hmm.
Doesn't make any sense. If she disposes of her clothes, she's not just going to forget about the knife.
Renaldo was Mindy's landlord?
What say we check out the bus?
Tied to the undercarriage ... maybe.
Yeah, and I bet this big boy spit out body parts all the way down the road.
Yeah, use whatever's available when you're breaking out of prison, I guess.
The torque of the spinning axle ripped her apart like the rubber off a bad retread.
Right. I'll call auto detail, have the bus sent to the garage, yeah?
What time did the bus leave for church?
What can you tell us about the vic?
Baby girl -- was that a street name?
I'm ruling you out as a suspect, ma'am.
No evidence of blood.
No sign of a struggle, no evidence of a body drag. If the attack didn't happen in her cell or in here, maybe it happened on the bus.
You allow inmates to service your prison vehicles?
Absorption.
Yeah, and it's more than just a paper cut.
Florescence. Bluish-white.
Acid phosphatase tests positive.
Sounds like we're looking for a lethal pair of white underpants.
Aluminum ch ... ? I've never heard of this before.
A what?
Funny, I didn't get a Christmas gift from Grissom. Did you?
Looks like a half moon. Gang moniker, maybe.
Oh. Yeah. Where's the other half?
When he said he expected something on top of his $11.65 an hour, I thought he was talking about free car washes.
It's still rape. Under cover of authority.
And she blabs to the warden. He's demoted from officer to inmate.
This program is scanning the topography of the skull and building a three-dimensional image based on the data. It should be done in a second, but you can already see two concentric arcs. 
Inner arc is impressed just a little bit deeper into the skull. Check it out.
Yeah.
There. 
Small ... 
... evenly spaced indentations on the edge of the inner arc.
Yeah, well, we know where he went. Just show us where he came from, please.
Whoa. Whoa. That's good. Start it from right there.
Yeah, the little guy on the right just snaked him.
Two for two.
He knows he has backup. Is the third time a charm?
Yes, it is.
Accusations from Tony. He's getting hot.
Tony got worked. Just wanted his money back.
ID's off. We're looking for a blue shirt and jeans.
Where there's a will, there's a way. PD found it in the Orpheus parking lot.
So this scumbag, Walter Darian, he beats a guy to death, goes out to his car, changes clothes and then goes back into the casino, washes his hands and just gets something to eat.
Wow.
Whoa ... yahtzee.
Whoa. Must be a few thousand dollars' worth of chips here.
So, he grifts, but doesn't cash in?
Road side diner, Libby. Sara.
Burn holes.
When's the last time you saw her?
What about this guy? You ever see him with Libby?
That's all I got. No name, no tissue, no hair.
Pull up the standard tissue thickness scale for female American caucasoids. Use the normal figures.
Apply the midline measurements. Good. Now the bilateral.
Mm-hmm.
Long skull. Prominent nose and chin.
What's with the 911 page? Fire's not even out yet.
Thanks a lot.
Okay, folks, any information you feel like you may have...
Oh, well, I'll make sure you have your medications by breakfast, okay? You're going to be all right. Everything's okay.
This man will take care of you, okay? 
Newspapers. I found them in the carport.
Yeah, it's kind of weird. Completely out of the path of the fire and the firemen said they didn't put them there.
Well, maybe he started in the carport, Sabrina came home, provided access to the inside of the house.
Let's hope he stuck around long enough to witness the damage.
It looks like everybody's neighbor.
A neighbor would know when people were out of town.
If this is a serial situation, to go from an empty garage to a whole house full of people, we're talking about a major escalation here.
Oh, she looks familiar. Hang on. I may have something.
She was at both fires. I got her name off the canvas.
Yeah.
She has a record.
You were arrested for attempted arson?
I have you on film at both fires on cell crook road.
That's not what your file says.
What is the distinction?
But you do set fires?
No, no, no. We're not talking about me.
Maybe not on purpose, but accidents do happen.
Yeah. Greg, how'd you like to be listed as an assist on an arson case?
Cool. I collected these matchbooks from the pyromaniac's house, who was ... kind of hot, actually.
Yeah. This, uh ... this match was used to start a garage fire a couple of weeks ago. See if you can find a match to ...  ... one of those. Thanks, pal.
Hmm. Doesn't mean she didn't do it.
You know, arson's usually a property crime. Did you ever find out the Abernathys' financial situation, Warrick?
Maybe the high school baseball team.
McKinley High School Gazette.
This is tomorrow's edition with the lead story by editor-in-chief Sabrina Abernathy, entitled Varsity Hazing Ritual. Now listen to this ... The question is not whether the so-called student athletes should be expelled, but whether or not they should be arrested.
Apparently, something with several hookers and a lot of testosterone.
We're just talking.
Sabrina Abernathy died in her home in a fire on Saturday night.
Cody, where were you around 1:00 A.M. on Saturday?
Except for the nights he's with the team pulling a train on a hooker.
Well, most high school seniors who are being scouted by division one schools. I don't think an expulsion and an arrest would look too good on a scholarship application.
How 'bout you, Cody? Do you know?
Yeah, but you're not real sorry the whole mess died with her, are you?
Thanks for your help.
Maybe this will help. It kind of smells like a menthol.
Cigarettes are a terrible way to commit arson. Unreliable. They take too long. Possible DNA trace, but ... it just doesn't make any sense.
Yeah, the bad kind. My burn scenarios don't match up with your data.
Ahah. Open windows, uh, drafts from vents, all of it. Here's the problem.
Demagnetized.
Okay, the Curie point is the temperature at which all materials lose their magnetic properties, yeah?
Okay. For the iron in these, the temperature would had to have been 932 degrees in that kitchen.
With the fire starting in the living room, no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get it that hot in there. It just doesn't make sense.
Living room was crammed with combustible materials. It received the most damage. It seems like the point of origin.
Yeah.
Well, Rick Chilson did call Sabrina a bitch when we were talking.
Yeah, he's an ass, but his alibi checks out. Surveillance at the Mirage has him playing poker the night of the fire.
He was right there with him. But I don't think that kid takes a breath without daddy's nod of approval.
And the son, Sam?
Well, she did think the baseball team had it in for her. Her family life was no picnic.
Then she stuck her tongue in this jerk.
These our serials?
We had 'em ... 
What do you think?
Not yet.
Grissom, I've got blood, but ... a lot of pheno-negative stains as well.
Hey, Dave, let's run a tox screen on both d.b.'s okay?
What do you got, Rick?
Think they were being smart taking the sheets, or did they just get off sleeping on 'em?
Hey, you know that cell phone Grissom found at the crime scene?
Traced it back to a Public Defender. Said she lost it. Made life hell for her while she was in DC.
Mm-hmm. Polyethylene. 
mm-hmm.
Hang on a second. 
Where do you keep the sodium rhodizinate?
Hey, Warrick.
Polyethylene plus corn syrup plus GSR gives you what?
GSR on the inside of a plastic bottle means ... 
Poor man's silencer. Only good for a couple shots.
What do you think? 
You went for a bottle and found a shirt?
Running it through limbic.
Sure, what's up?
That's about nine hours after he died. Good hunch, Greg-o.
Or at least, a thief. 
There might be an easier way.
Had a real good talk with your manager, Clyde. How's Fast 'n Fresh treating you?
I guess this kind of beats saving up, huh?
I'll be talking to her soon enough.
Hey, regular guys don't steal $300 with a dead cop's ATM card, man!
The manager says Clyde Grimes took a break around three. That's consistent with bank records. Three hundred dollar withdraw to Clyde's account registered at 3:06.
Yeah, one hour later.
How? The camera's part of the ATM.
Then the guy who used Tim Coleman's card should be on video one hour later.
He's, uh, emptying the ATM.
Hey, is everybody all right?
I'm with the Vegas crime lab.  Yo, yo, where's the fire, my man?
Ha! No wonder you were in a hurry.
Well, Mr. Drake. I suppose this is one way to make eight years in an injection molding factory pay off. You're certainly good with plastics.
It was a good scam. Your reader transmits the card number to you, and the camera records the sucker's pin number.
You raked in over $13,000 off 62 skimmed accounts.
And I checked the bank records. All of the cards you stole belonged to cops.
Hey. Sorry we're late. There was a news van blocking the entrance.
Okay, let's go to work.
Uh, photo-evidence log -- just record everything we collect, okay?
Oh, well ... technically, these are eccentric shafts, not screws.
Means the nuts were loose. Excessive play on the screws would've worn down the threads.
Could've been a pipe wrench.
Or whoever loosened the nuts screwed up.
I'm processing the dead park employee's clothing. The shirt and the pants are covered in red fibers.
Well, they're trilobal.
Oh, I am the man.
I microsilled the pipe wrenches you and Sara turned into evidence. I excluded Woody's wrench. Take a look at the tool marks from the wrench found in the t-bird. On the left, the sabotaged nut. On the right, the test marks.
I have a theory maybe Jim Nevins sabotaged the roller coaster. 
When he left the park, someone attacked him, grabbed his wrench and hit him over the head with it.
I got a partial. And I had a tech print the T-bird. Found two sets of prints on the trunk's lid.
One belonged to the vic, the other unknown, but it did match the partial.
Semen match the dead guy's?
Well, there goes my theory. No one tampers with their s*x machine.
Can you go back in time, to the night before?
Jim Nevins may have been on that coaster. I want to see if anyone was with him.
Oh. So much for safe s*x.
Reverse one more pic.
Now, that picture's worth five bucks.
We need to find that girl.
Hey.
This is about the key CSI position. Grissom recommended me.
It's not necessary. Position was cut. Budget had room for the new promotion or a new qiagen, bio robot ez-1. Greg will be thrilled.
Oh, well, it's just an honor to be nominated, right?
Complicated, huh? Maybe for a couple of pizza majors. But not for an electrical engineering grad student. AFIS got a hit on the print off the transmitter in the shoe. 
Seth Landers. WLVU. Got busted a few years ago for making fake IDs.
Well, If someone hit my boys all mob-style I'd disappear, too, you know?
Uh-oh.
Stop!
Well, this is Seth Landers' dorm. 
There's a lot of garbage build up. When was the last pick-up?
Looks like blood. Let's hope the killer left his DNA behind. .22 revolver, two live rounds, four expended. Should be able to pull some prints off it.
Doesn't matter if it still works.
There you go.
So we've got our murder weapon.
An rg .22. That's not a very bad ass' first weapon of choice.
Okay, two victims, two taps to the head. But the loads are different.
And reloaded, yeah.
And the two rounds found in Davis Mullins were Remington Brass washed. So, based on the position of the cylinder Remingtons were fired first?
No skid marks, no signs of another vehicle.
I compared the eight pairs of shoes we collected at Todd Coombs' house to the shoe print at the crime scene.
No matches.
Yeah, true. 
Could explain why she picked Todd out of a lineup -- strong family resemblance.
Nowhere. No Kevin Coombs at the address you gave me; no forwarding address. PD's following up.
How'd you guys know Linley Parker's cell was e-911 capable?
Her carrier accepted the Attorney General waiver. I'm accessing her site now. If her phone's on, it should show up.
Okay, got it. Nearest cross streets, uh, Warm Springs and Durango.
Hey, Catherine. She's moving.
Two hundred fifty feet. Two hundred, still moving.
One hundred fifty feet.
Eighty. NICK: Seventy, sixty, still moving! NICK: Fifty. Okay, okay, she stopped. NICK: Thirty feet, she's right here. 
Hey, check this out. I just found it in the hose. It's from a potted plant purchased at the house company. Confirms Todd Coombs' alibi.
A lot of people work at the Palms. And it doesn't nail Todd Coombs.
Yeah, me, too.
All right, I'll see you.
Wow. That's really hard for you, isn't it?
Yeah, and we get a 406 in Henderson. Want to trade?
To protect and serve.
Are you boys ready for softball on Sunday?
All right. You're ready to kiss my what?
Well, sir, we need a list of all the kids who were here tonight.
We're going to need to search the premises.
I'm going to have to ask you folks to step outside. Thank you.
Yeah, I'll take the master.
Table against the closet door, chair shoved under the knob. It is the same M.O.
Bad guys leave, fear just stays behind.
The center whorls look similar.
Hey, hey. Two partials equal one slimeball. Jacqui got a hit through AFIS.
Man ... LINDA KIRKWOOD was a Hoover. She even bleached the sheets.
Ring the doorbell; that usually seems to work.
What?
Leftovers, I guess.
Single women, dining alone -- easy targets.
All you have to do is follow them home.
Same waiter?
Education, employment history and a driver's license are required for all employees.
Well, Eric Shultz. Lives in the same neighborhood.
But the busboy, Kelly James -- not only went to the same high school, but graduated from the same juvie center.
What do you think? That's our guy, right?
I'll find out where he was the night the Kirkwoods were invaded.
Short shorts. Rock soft shoes. Dressed for sport.
Chances are she's been dead less than twenty-four hours.
Uh, we have air in our lungs, add water, you have foam.
No birthmark. No scars, no tattoos.
I got a locker key.
Yeah, yeah. Last week. I still haven't heard anything about it.
It's all yours.
Greg processed the sexual assault kit. Positive for semen.
Hello. Yeah. All right. Good.
Ranger Stone came through. We found our locker.
Dollar slots.
University student ID. Sophia Renatta, 20 years old.
Well, that's certainly a guy's. Could be a boy-friend's ... beach buddy ... ?
He wasn't a cool guy? 
They look like a couple to you?
So, you think they just met?
Thanks.
Well, if he did just meet her, he's a pretty smooth operator. Bailed her out, bought her lunch, and still had some coins left over to play the slots.
No, no. No one's saying that. We're just ... Mr. Young, when is the last time that you saw Mark?
Hey, believe me, I understand. I've been there.
We're not saying he's a criminal. 
But maybe we don't need one. If we could just come by there and collect some of Mark's things, uh, we could get a DNA sample, exclude him as a suspect.
A waverunner ... point and throttle.
We have no idea where they went.
And I'm sure you're here to shed some light on the situation.
Right.
mm-hmm.
Uh, no. No. I think we got it, boss.
Greg was right. There's our waverunner.
Half a tank of gas. Why didn't he just take this to get out of Dodge?
So... he just hoofs it out of here? How?
Yeah, but when you're young, it just looks like a whole lot of fun.
Well, if that's where she died ... the evidence isn't up here. It's down there.
Spiral search pattern. The anchor chain is your center point. Do a 360, then drop your depth. Now, you're not done till you hit the bottom, okay?
Good luck.
What do you got?
That's got to be Mark Young.
She went in first.
And he jumped in after her.
This was an accident, Sara. He was trying to save her.
Twenty-six feet under with a busted eardrum? If not to save her, why dive that deep?
Almost over.
I think he died trying to save someone's life.
No, it's my pleasure.
Hey.
What do you mean?
Look, I'm just trying to give the guy a little peace, you know?
Hey, let me ask you something, Sara: You're Mr. Young, would you rather know this much or nothing at all?
Well, okay, if that works for you.
Frozen stiff.
It got messy. Check out the shotgun spatter.
Let's go. Vega's got the security guard.
Hey, how you doing?
They shot a guy over a vending machine?
You don't make rounds?
Okay, but if you were here, you're a suspect. Come on, man. Middle of the shift, you're getting hungry. You figure, hey, I'll deck out and grab a bite to eat. Who's going to know, right?
When?
What kind of burger?
I love In 'n' Out. I always get the In 'n' Out double, animal style.
You grill the onions?
Now, that is crazy, Petey, 'cause you know, being an In 'n' Out kind of guy, I know it takes at least five minutes to grill the onions alone.
That time of night, you're lucky if you don't wait 20 minutes just to get to the window.
How'd it go?
So, what are we going to use, hot water?
To preserve the body?
The one we gave Hodges?
Till we do, anything else?
So, some budget-minded garage gunsmith glues his gun stock together ...
Even Petey can do better than that.
Go on, please.
Everything went black?
Oh, yeah.
So, uh, now, how did you get out?
Where?
What kind of a knucklehead rolls into pd wearing pants with blood on them?
Yeah. Preemptive strike, huh?
I was in that freezer. Man, there was spatter everywhere. Now, assuming that is al's blood, how does George not get it on the outside of his pants? Do you think George is telling the truth?
Okay ... ...fire in the hole.
Now for the good stuff. Changing one variable. Dropping temperature to
Shooter was standing in front of Al. A spatter went back and to the sides.
Well, Lone Ranger had Tonto. Some Doofus has George.
What's the top layer?
Doofus.
Oil and water. Love to be there when his hood starts to peel.
Mm-hmm.
Hey, Sara, no luck on the car, but Hodges ran the gunstock adhesive. It's primarily an epoxy posisin with traces of styrene and benzyl peroxide and ground terra-cotta.
Terra-cotta's the giveaway. It's a granite glue.
Yeah. It's used for adhering joints on big pieces of stone. 
Well, he used what was available. That's what people do.
I already checked. There's not too many places in clark county that specialize in granite installation, so...
That's a bet.
Is this your car? It was also in your garage. It has dual-layered paint, identical to the dual-layered paint chips we found on your kidnap victim.
Ah, you're not stupid. Man, your cousin just set you up.
Is that where you told him about the vending machines?
Well ... George, sometimes people, they, uh, disappoint us.
Hold on. Warrick's already searched the car and the knife's been excluded. What exactly are we hoping to find?
That was auto detail. There's a traffic jam on Flamingo. Tow truck should be here any second.
Lots of things.
A ticking clock gets priority.
I don't care if you're working on the hottest case of your career. If your supervisor tells you to leave a scene to go wash his car, you do it. 
You don't have a career without a job.
That's not the right car, man.
We can see that. Why?
This is evidence in an active investigation. 
Then let's get started.
What do you got?
Hmm.
White threads...
Reddish-brown stain consistent with blood.
Mmm.
Well, the towel is inadmissible, but the threads are still fair game.
So ... you still upset about your case being put on hold?
... Ms. Lyford? Ms. Lyford, I'm Nick Stokes. I'm also a criminalist here in the lab, and I want you to know I understand. I understand your frustration. This is not an easy thing to deal with, but I can assure you that this entire lab is on your sister's case. Okay? I can't make any promises, but we're doing everything possible to keep this suspect behind bars, where he belongs.
Okay. Okay.
Hang in there.
What's up, Warrick?
With you.
Her sister was raped and murdered. She watched the defense decimate your case. I think you could have given her five minutes.
She just wants to know that someone around here gives a damn, Warrick.
Hey, Grissom, that Sheriff checked with just about every tech in the lab looking for you. He's bugging for an update.
Why? What happened?
Fife still could have raped and murdered Rachel.
Was there any sign of forced entry?
Doesn't matter. Knife's excluded.
Jim, the world's watching.
A .21.
Her mom. She said she talks to her every day. Called the station when she couldn't reach her by nightfall.
Doesn't look like any of her toiletries were missing.
Her mom said she had dinner with the producers of Real Vegas Showgirls.
It's a reality-based show shooting here in Vegas.
It was found four days ago at Dante's pizza on boulder highway -- parking lot.
A professional photographer, lives alone ... 
Meanwhile, we still haven't found anything. Now, did anyone stop to think this guy might just be nuts?
The original missing persons call was mine and Sara's.
Hold on, now. This is a career case, Grissom. You know Sara and I both put in for a promotion. If we work this, we're on departmental radar here.
We wouldn't ask for it if we couldn't do it.
What does it matter? We're all on the same team.
Let's just find her, okay?
So can I.
She's got Greg helping her?
Well, the only way to learn is by getting out in the field, and if Greg helps find her, I'm okay with that.
How many were models?
Washed up during heavy rains. Furnace Creek. Left in the morning for a photo shoot. Has a list of photographers in her day planner.
Guess whose name is on the list?
Julie's vehicle was found in the parking lot of Dante's Pizza, off Boulder highway. That's what? 12 miles away?
So they hopped in the car and went to a photo shoot.
He drove her body to the snack bar and went back and buried her. Question is where?
Okay, Greg, diagram every rock on the pile. By trial time, defense will make us recreate this whole crime scene.
Yeah, and then he used these rocks to cover her so that she wouldn't wash up in a storm the way the other girl did.
What is that, double exposure?
Separate them?
Do you have Catherine's crime scene photos of the car?
Just give me the instrument panel and put it side-by-side with the double-exposed instrument panel.
Now just the speedometers.
Does that look like the same car to you?
Hey, y'all. I got something on the double-exposed roll of film.
No, on the left is you. Crime scene photo from the Maserati.
Well, it's unknown. Must have used a picture he already had for the double exposure.
A female body, naked. No face to go with an ID.
Sorry, Catherine. Traffic's backed up all the way to the strip.
I'll start bagging. Gather the detritus and separate out the bomb components.
It was a pipe bomb. Initiated by a lightbulb filament.
There were still magnet and solder fragments attached to the pipe.
Digital clock in the dash.
I was about to analyze the chemical residue left on the bomb frags.
Will do.
ID'd the explosive.
Yeah, rocket fuel. GCMS picked up the other half of the equation-- gasoline.
Ammonium perchlorate's available at any chemical supply store. You can gas up on every corner. Anyone could've made this bomb.
I can answer that, too.
Take a look.
Compromised the timing device. Made the bomb unpredictable.
Hey, I made one of those in third grade. Science fair. Should have won, too.
Bomb end-cap with tool marks. Given the orientation and spread of the marks, consistent with pliers, vise-grips.
Hmm.
We can compare the tool marks on both end-caps. Doesn't matter what you make; it's what you make it with.
Mm-mm. So, whatever tool made the volcano did not make the bomb.
Man, if I ever have to search another torched car ... 
Oh, yeah. Yeah, the new DNA girl. Right?
O-kay, well, I'm going to go use the no-pressure, no-AC, stinks-of-feet shower. So ... welcome.
All right.  I'll meet you there. 
I'm late? 
Yeah.
These kids thought they'd found a real space alien.
Not with a short-handled shovel.
Got some paint ... maybe. Something for Hodges. One thing's for sure: It's going to take a lot longer getting him out than it did getting him in.
Hearing aids have unique serial numbers, Super Dave.
If you get this to Detective Travis, he should be able to run it down for us.
Hmm?
You've got to be kidding me.
Oh, you're going to love this.  Like a blinding supernova, your love is blasted throughout the universe. Two spirits become one by the power of the sun, the moon, and all the planets of the universe.
Yeah, identical. Manufactured by Big City Costumes.
Specifically designed for this chapel.
Do the initials E.T. mean anything to you?
So business is good?
Viva Las Vegas, man.
Come on, where's your intellectual curiosity?
We've already been there.
We know where there's a pink cadillac.  Thank ya. Thank ya very much.
Sara. 
Let's go talk to the king.
You want to tell us about the scratch on your cadillac?
We found the shovel near the body. The paint transfer matches your car.
And so then you just took over his business?
Abnormally long fingers, arms, legs, scoliosis.
Yeah, the coroner found dirt in his stomach and his upper airways, underneath his fingernails.
He died from asphyxia, all right, but it was post-burial.
Hey, man.
Thanks.
Great.
Hoo ... so, you've got a Samuel Mendez with a cracked skull listed as death imminent, right?
Yeah, well, if they'd've thrown a bunch of feces at me, I would have cracked some skulls too.
This is the last place I thought I'd see a gun.
Could be his.
Wow ... this is a lot of crap. What, did they squat on cue?
So, the cops bust in to get the prisoners under control when they start throwing raw sewage?
You want to tell me what happened here?
A fish?
You see what happened?
Fire in the hole! Shooting two!
Because the gun was hot. Ran it though IBIS. It was used in an execution-style murder.
Yeah ... little fish in a tank full of sharks.
Hey, Chris.
Yeah, I can see that. It's just hard to believe that's what killed him.
Uh, coming over that embankment? That would've woke him up. Key's still in the ignition. Car's in drive. Engine's not running.
Oh.
You think?
Yeah, yeah.
This is a pretty remote place for an accident. But you think someone saw it, took advantage of the situation?
Maybe.
The contusion on the forehead was, uh, superficial, right?
But you're still working on it, right?
Passenger door latch is busted. It could've happened during the accident.
What'd you get back from tox?
I know marijuana slows your reaction time, but based on the lack of skid marks at the scene, the position of the vehicle, I don't think this guy ever hit the brakes.
Come on, you're a bigger boy than me.
Yeah, yeah, put your back into it.
Yeah, but the gauges are all off. The panel's not even working. Okay, ignition was on, but the engine wasn't running, so ... what? No gas?
Cory was in good shape. The jeep seems to be in decent condition, so ...
Brakes on the jeep were functioning. The driver should've been able to stop.
No. Something's not right.
We don't have an answer.
All right, we're on the clock. Let's take this thing apart.
Hey, I've got some blown fuses and some fried wiring up here.
Yeah.
Well, that would indicate some sort of electrical shock.
Like what, lightning?
Let's go back out there and check it out.
Cory was coming from Lake Mead, which is that way.
Yeah.
Wire trimmings. They look fresh.
Looks like a new splice on those wires.
Yeah, but even if a live wire struck the roll bar, the tires would have insulated the vehicle.
Black transfer. Wasn't the undercarriage of Cory's jeep black?
Completing the circuit, and theoretically, electrocuting the vehicle.
We're finishing up the case.
Yeah, we called Nevada Power, and they confirmed there was a downed power line the day of the accident.
Yeah.
I'm on it.
Same vehicle, power's good. So, why isn't Mr. Wiggles connecting?
Entry through the, uh, the watch on his wrist and then exit through the rivets in his shorts.
Thanks for getting our back.
Yeah.
Hey, Greg, Grissom wants to see you.
Good job.
Pulled a couple of likely palm prints on the newspaper the head was on, but I don't think that's going to be our best bet.
Cover your ass.
My pleasure.
Herpetologists always throwing the Latin around. What's wrong with just calling him rattlesnake?
Apparent Mexican vic on a Mexican newspaper with a Mexican snake. You don't find a whole lot of these buzz-worms around Vegas anyway, do you?
What are the chances that thing just crawled in their on its own?
This is a pretty nice place. A long way from 28th Street.
Sounds like a rock band.
Hey, Vega? Check out these pics.
Think she liked to party?
I know.
Okay.
That looks like pure crystal meth.
Perfect drug for this town.
Carla? Not Veronica?
She, uh, friends with the band?
I know my Spanish is a little rusty, but I think he just said, She was a liar, she wasn't who she said she was.
I met the snake ... eat a snake.
That's not really what I'm after, my man.
Excuse me.
Great. What can you tell us about the song they just played?
Quite frankly, the lyrics are very similar to a homicide we're investigating.
Yeah, I might do that. Listen, one more thing, if you could.  This girl, you know who she is?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Anything else?
Oh, hey.
Oh, it's, uh, it's an old case from San Diego.
Yeah, now you put that to music, sing it in Spanish, and you have a narcocorrido.
A corrido is a Mexican ballad. A narcocorrido ... 
Kind of more or less, except their songs include actual events, like specific dates, names ... here. Come over here, check this out.
This girl was shacked up with a local drug lord. He dumps her, she rats him out to the authorities. The rest of the body was never found. But the song was a big hit.
Yeah, and if that's the case, anyone who knows this song could ... could be the killer.
Huh? Oh, no, no, no. Sorry. It was actually something I saw.
She was working undercover?
Yeah, her article came down pretty hard on the music, huh?
Good thing Veronica wasn't.
Veronica Juarez had a jacket just like this one. Minus the tire tracks.
This jacket? It's coming with me. And you're going with him.
You want to tell me what this is?
I don't know, it looks more like a human finger to me. It's been burned.
That's right. That's why I do a lot of tests. And I'm also gonna match the blood found on Veronica's jacket right here.
Now, why would they do that?
The Mexican Robin Hood, a thief and a killer, hung May 3, 1909.
Okay, hold out your hands -- we're gonna get some prints.
Hey, Catherine. The palm prints on the newspaper don't match Elindio's.
Elindio didn't even own a car, much less a big-ass truck. What other characteristics?
That's a retread.
I only know of one place in Vegas that does work like this.
Hey.
I'll take that autograph now.
Ven aca.
Bad news. Rafael's palm prints don't match the one on the newspaper.
Great. Well, you know, there is one place the victim was where there's a whole lot of these tires.
Vega!
Run the plates.
Hey, Juanito. Not barbacking tonight?
No.
No, we're looking for you.
That's a cool belt, Juanito. What's it made out of? Human hair?
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no 
Hey, hey, hey, back up!
He killed an innocent girl!
Hey!
Este muchacho mato a una señorita inocente. Inocente!
Y tiene que pagar. Y tiene que pagar! Get him out of here!
Go, go, go!
Hey, it's better than the joint. I can promise you that. Besides, you didn't prove anything ... Taking the life of an innocent woman ...
Yeah? To do what? Impress a bunch of fools who don't give a crap about what happens to you, anyway.
No, no, no, no. You see, the song's already been written. You're just a sad copy. Una copia triste.
Right.
We've got disturbed soil in a three-by-five perimeter.
Yeah, but I think I got something else too.
Hey, guys. Check this out. 
A third foot.  Looks like we have another body at the bottom.
Remember, now, she had a broken jaw. That was 26-gauge stainless steel. It's used to surgically wire jawbones shut.
Well, if it was pre-mortem, that would support torture.
Yeah, well, her wounds don't just trickle, man, they-they gush.
Uh, found this paper. It was found in the pocket. Decomp trashed it, though.
Ouch.
Fatty acids dissolve the ink, and it leeches onto the pocket lining.
Huh. That must've been a pretty hot number you had there, boss.
Sharpen the contrast, will you?
Madame ... Matryoshka's. Tuesday ... Eight? G A.M.? Some kind of appointment. G A.M.?
Sure. 
Oh, yeah, yeah, the dolls that look alike, that fit inside of each other, right?
You mean wife-to-be.
For money?
Sounds a lot like prostitution to me.
Mm, I don't know about that. Svetlana ended up dead.
Yeah, I-I'm sorry, there seems to be a really fine line here between, uh ... peddling marriage and peddling flesh.
That's it?
Yeah, she was murdered.
We're gonna need to get a DNA sample from you, and I'm gonna take a look around your place. Is that cool?
I looking for kindest, noble man. Well, I got news for you, sugar pants. Buying women ain't that noble.
Hey, wait a minute. You're not telling me you're into this stuff?
He needs a translator, 'cause you're not even speaking the same language.
Best part of what?
Svetlana was a tall girl. Spatter looks a little low. Maybe she was sitting.
It'll never stand up, Rick. You know how it is, they'll say the blood could've come from anywhere. She could've left the necklace behind.
I'm not convinced he did. Svetlana was buried in a pre-existing grave. Right on top of another girl's body.
Yeah, and Chloe doesn't really seem like the type that gets her hands dirty.
Well, it looks like the Vladski tricked the Kenski.
Safe to say he was mauled by a wild animal?
Your call came in as suspicious circs. Is there something else we should know about?
Got some broken branches over here. 
Directionality faces away from the victim and the animal. 
Looks like someone even tore their pants. Khakis. Vic's wearing jeans and a nylon vest. I bet somebody else was out here, and they were running for their life.
Hey, man. I ran the vic's prints. Didn't get a hit.
We know someone else was out there. Maybe he drove.
Yeah. Hunting's not exactly a poor man's sport. U.S. presidents still hold up dead ducks for photo ops.
Some hunters think soap and deodorant tip off their prey. Truth is, body odor's much more pungent.
Okay. Case closed.
We may have an ID on our hunter. Uniforms found an abandoned Mercedes. Plates came back to a Mr. Rod Hollis, who had hunting permits that included tags for wild goats, deer, and bighorn sheep.
You were separated?
He was mauled by a bear. Ms. Hollis, I have reason to believe there was somebody else out there with him. Any idea who?
Where's the gun, sir?
Okay, Mr. Colite, this gun is going into evidence.
You know, someone killed a Kodiak bear up in the Black Mountains the day before yesterday. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?
Excuse me?
You mind if I have a look around?
Whoa, Mr. Colite. I just have one more question for you. How long have you been storing gallbladders with your ice cream?
Barbiturates?
I think I know what's going on here, Catherine.
They're called canned hunts. Going on all over the country.
Well, you got that right. Point is, you don't have to go to Africa to hunt wild game anymore. If you've got the money, Africa comes to you.
To guarantee a kill, yeah.
Something went wrong.
And not by the paramedics.  And according to them, he had a broken neck.
Hey, Catherine.
I think I found the launch point.
Hey. Whatever happened, it happened right here.  Planter could've been broken during the struggle or been used as leverage.
Well, maybe the killer hung out ...
... enjoying the fruits of his labor.
No.
If these walls could talk, huh?
Yeah, no doubt.
Maybe the guy had stomach trouble, you know, ulcers.
Well, whoever was outside might've been in here, too. I've got some greasy handprints, look very similar to the ones on the railing.
I'll take a sample.
Yeah.
Okay. What about the handprints from the railing and the floor in study?
I compared the hand size, and, uh, the prints aren't Eiger's, man.
No. Which means that ...
Well, maybe some people aren't as discerning as you are. How does a grown man get diaper rash?
Maybe he had gastrointestinal issues.
Yeah. No drugs in his bloodstream.
He had dilated pupils, and he was a sick guy, but ... no medications.
Whoa. Who's your mommy? The true inner sanctum.
Hey, maybe we're looking for the hand that rocks the cradle.
I just don't get it, man.
No. I mean, I had a wooby, but who didn't?
Don't even.
I'm going to have a look around.
This is the same toy box they sell at Forever Baby, except the one in the store was twice as big on the inside. SARA: Well, he did like his secret spaces.
Yep.
All right.
Whoa.
Bingo.
Sy Magli ... Sam Braun ... Rory Atwater?
Looks like it. Along with some gaming commissioners, judges, pro athletes.
Well, apparently, Sy liked the spectrum -- 
I don't get it. Grissom calls me up, I come out here, and I find you. Things were a hell of a lot simpler when we were all on the same shift.
Whatever.
Yeah, a shot cup coming out of a shell is like throwing a potato chip. It doesn't really go that far.
Another casing.  That's got to account for at least two more shots.
There's not much out here to do for a couple of guys, other than hike or hunt.
So they were up to no good.  Is that a trail over there?
C-note in a Beaver Dam.
They should do a commercial for the city.
Las Vegas -- where even the beaver can strike it rich.
I think the guy used a sawed-off shotgun.
Check out the stria.
Impatience.
Sawing off the barrel of a shotgun is hard work.
Those that do it are usually in a rush in to get it done. It leaves a burr on the edge of the barrel.
So every time the weapon fired, the burr on the barrel raked the shot cup ...
... before the pellets blasted holes into Mr. Gabe Miller, here.
Yeah, why? Is it that funny?
Yeah, wide receiver for the Vegas Greenbacks, right?
Well, his team ring was on this guy's finger.
Roughly 25,000 in cash, money bands from five different sports books, some, uh, assorted trash and junk, and these.
They winners or losers?
Well, if he was placing bets for a bookie, maybe we can find out who it is.
Hey.
Yeah, I've heard of them. They set the spread for almost every sports book in Vegas.
Okay, Ma'am. What've you got for us? 
Number four buckshot. Barnes was at Rainbow Canyon with Russell.
They win big, and both wind up on the wrong end of a shotgun.
We're looking for a third guy.
Beaten to death.
You got it.
Yeah, I could use the fresh air.
Found a pile of pipes by the side of the house; one seems to be missing. This is an exemplar of a possible murder weapon. And I cast a shoe impression just outside the kid's bedroom window. Also some graffiti on the window -- B-R-
Mm. Well, whoever killed the boy knew how to get in and out of this house without waking the family.
The Crime Lab is going to dust your house for prints, so I need to know which ones are yours.
Mr. Hawkins, would you stand up, facing me, so I can take some photos?
Open up.
I'll be needing to take your shoes as well. You can wear some booties home.
You just gonna let them go?
Well, they could've showered, tossed their clothes.
Yeah, based on what?
Detective ... can I have a word with you outside, please?
We don't have enough evidence to suggest that that boy killed his brother.
I'm saying I'm not sure if threatening him is the right tactic right now. I found no blood on his clothes. The screen door could have been the point of entry.  I mean, have you considered asking him what he heard or-or saw before you just put the full court press on him?
No, you don't. Look, there's no disrespect here, okay? We're all on the same team.
The shoe impression outside Ty's window matches the brother's. 
Either of which could be related to the murder or just a result of two brothers living together.
What's in the bindle?
Nobody in the family was wearing anything blue.
Yeah.
Hey, I am concerned that Detective Cavaliere's moving ahead of Forensics on this one.
Hey.
I'm getting there. Nothing definitive as of yet. Which means you can't hold Matt Hawkins for longer than his twenty-four hours.
Really?
He confessed?
Did you beat it out of him?
Mm, how's that?
That device has been discredited for years.
Well, not in Las Vegas. Or anywhere else in this state. Say, was an advocate or a parent present at the time of the confession? 
He tell you why he did it?
Okay.
Suspects are tricked into confessing all the time, but I'm telling you, Cavaliere intimidated that boy. Man, he would've signed anything.
Could be. I checked the crime stats for the Hawkins neighborhood. There's been a rash of nuisance calls. There's some homeless guy running around out there peeping in windows, urinating in public, attempted B and E.
I'm gonna go back out there, see if the Hawkins know anything about it.
You got that kind of time?
Thanks, Rick.
Right now your son's under investigation.
Yeah, the detective asked him if he wanted a parent or advocate present at the interrogation. He's fourteen years old, so it's his right to say no.
Were those his clothes in the washer?
Okay, we'll see what we can do about getting him something to wear.
Was it brat?
That would explain the shoe impressions outside the bedroom window.
Well, that's what we're trying to find out.
Walter, that's a nice blue sweater. Where'd you get it?
I said I like your sweater -- where'd you get it?
Oh, it's yours?
Suspicion of murder.
Easy with the sweater. It's evidence.
Hey, man.
I'm just following the evidence, and it led me to another suspect. I think you're going to want to talk to him in the interest of justice.
You know any good defense is gonna bring up a rush to judgment here. Come on! Chris, you put another interviewed suspect on your list. It shows due diligence. Let's go.
Your sweater's been analyzed, Walter. Found bloodstains from a murdered boy on it.
You already told me it was yours.
Where did you find it?
Hey, Catherine.
DNA finished up with the blue sweater and I processed it.
I ran it under the UV light and out popped one of those invisible dry cleaner ID stamps, you know?
I called the dry cleaner; they gave me a name.
Mr. Hawkins, is that your sweater?
Did you give it away?
It's got Ty's blood on it.
That's your call, sir.
Yeah, Matt could have worn his dad's sweater when he killed Ty. Dumped it in the park during the night, where Walter found it.
About five feet, why? Dad is ... 6'2. What about Walter?
Yeah.
I'm sorry ... 
... that you feel that way.
So was the daughter, right?
Well, I'll collect the sheets as soon as I'm finished up here.
Yeah. Crime scene this messy, gotta bust out the big guns. You know what I mean?  Hey, did you know that Ecklie volunteered the lab to evaluate this scanner for Third Tech? 
Hmmm. I wouldn't count on it. But I am definitely going to enjoy using this while it's here. Virtual crime scene sketch. Sure beats doing it by hand.
So, what, we're looking at a murder-suicide? Guy kills his family and then turns the gun on himself?
Hey. 
Checking out trajectory angles. This is the shot coming out of Morgan's body.
Oh, the wall trajectory is a constant. Morgan's is the variable here.
So let's make them line up.
He was moved.
Wait. Morgan's wound bled out here. The blood puddle covered the initial spatter.
So maybe Neal or Tara Matthews has blood on their clothes.
Ye... yes, yes, I'm very aware of Butterfield Academy's privacy policy, but this a homicide ... 
Jeans are a little nice for a homeless kid. Check his veins and do a SART kit anyway. Can you ballpark a T.O.D.?
This is a busy line -- buses, traffic ... 
Maybe be hasn't been here the whole time. Could explain the blanket.
Hey, Chester, you been taking that thing off road again?
Thanks, Chester.
Sir, all I'm asking for is your class roster. Ye ... yes, yes, I'm very aware of Butterfield Academy's privacy policy, but this a homicide investigation. 
Okay. No, no, no. I understand your position. Thanks.
What about the burn to the face? Could that be from an iron?
Skull fracture what killed him?
Shake and bake.
Yeah.
Yeah. Yeah. How'd you get this? I talked to the headmaster. He wouldn't give me jack.
Your daughter goes to Butterfield?
Wow. That's a little pricey.
Yeah.
No. I'm trying to I.D. A victim. Thanks for this.
Thank you.
Oh. Hi there. I've been ringing the bell.
No school today?
Oh, gosh. Okay. Uh, well, my name's Nick Stokes. I'm with the Las Vegas Police Department, and, uh, this is pretty important. Parents around?
Do you have their cell phone or work numbers handy?
No, not exactly. Um ... how old are you?
How old is he?
You have a brother?
Yeah, Chase. Is, uh ... is he around?
Is that the last time you saw him?
Do you have a picture of your brother I can take a look at?
Would you get that for me, please? Thank you.
Um ... I'm gonna need your parents' contact information if you don't mind, in Vail, okay?
You're Chase's best friend, Andy. I need to know what happened last night.
Ma'am, please, I need to hear Andy's version. Okay?  Go ahead, Andy.
They were in Vail.
And did you?
What about Chase?
Talk to me, Goose.
Yeah, the, uh, teenage sister had a kegger.
Oh, 16, 17.
So your saying, two generations from now, four-year-olds are just gonna be getting trashed?
Mm.
Transfer from the blanket?
Okay. What about the, uh, the gack in the guy's hair? HODGES: Melted vulcanized rubber and thermoplastic elastomers. From the sole of your average athletic shoe.
Hmm. What's hot, cramped, and full of other people's hair?
Excuse me. You the manager?
Yeah. Uh, I was taking my laundry to the car, and the cart locked up on me. 
A 12-year-old boy died in one of your dryers the other night. You trying to tell me you don't know anything about it?
That's it? I don't buy it, Jared. I don't. You know why? Your fancy carts. And I know that no cart leaves that parking lot unless somebody presses the magic button. And I also matched tires treads. Someone ... wheeled one of your carts through wet grass ... and dumped a dead 12-year-old boy on a bus bench.
Bus bench. Hospital. I could see how you could make the mistake.
Uh-uh. But I'll let you know.
Hey ...  You found him. You put him in the dryer.
Mm-hmm. Chase can't even lock himself inside those things. They lock from the outside. 
And I matched your print on the handle. I got it off your school's safe kit.
Just another day in paradise.
Okay, I opened the age range to give us a better margin for error. Currently 47 male Caucasians between the age of 12 and 16 missing from the greater Las Vegas Metro District.
Mm-hmm. Body was found here.
These are the last-known residences of the missing persons.
I'll narrow it down.  Two-mile radius.
Okay, I'll go wider. Five miles.
So far we've followed up on eleven missing persons who fit the profile, ruled out every one by case history.
Well, we're only looking at people who've been missing more than a year. The condition of the bones ...
Well, most of the time kids believe what they want to believe, you know. Did he run off to see his mom?
Ms. Giles, do you, uh, do you recognize this boy?
No?
Do you have anything of Travis's he might have used on his body? Like a toothbrush, hairbrush, anything like that?
Mmm.
Well, it would help if I could get a sample of Travis's DNA. Look ...
Well, we know Owen went to school with Travis Giles, right?
Ms. Giles? Hi. What can I do for you?
Hello!
Yeah, sure. How's the conference going?
Okay, shoot.
Mm-hmm.
Vic Patterson does. Are we talking about The Eagle? From that TV show?
A .45, same kind he uses in all his cheeseball shoot-outs.
Yeah, I can run the serial number through Automated Firearms Service, give you the history.
Colt sold it to the Beverly Hills Gun Club, who, in turn, sold it to The Eagle on September 28, 1983.
Hey, Jim. I just got your bullet. I'm running it through IBIS right now. Not gonna ask how you got it. 
So, did you meet him?
Ha-ha. Yeah. Did you get his autograph for me?
Do you think that would make his autograph worth more? Or less?
We got a match. Entered by Matt Glazer, LAPD. Recovered from a BMW gas tank. Open investigation, homicide-related.
Sure.
Yeah ...
Rain check.
Rain check.
Hey.
Heard you may be looking at a second victim?
I just got off the phone with courthouse security. That keycard that you and Catherine found belongs a guy named Adam Novak.  Only prints I found on the card were his.
Hey.
No. Two sticks of gum and a pack of condoms. Why?
I don't know how you're going to take this, but I think this car was recently broken into. These scratches ... they look fresh. B&amp;E 101. 
Somebody could've swiped his keycard.
Smudges and partials, inside and out.
Crop circles?
Come on, Super Dave. Wasn't the alien autopsy embarrassing enough?
You need to get a girlfriend.
Oh, hang on. We have ourselves a tapeworm, gentlemen.
This guy's been eating meat or fish infected with tapeworm cyst.
Yeah, and since this guy's already dead, the tapeworm needs to find a new host. Only two ways out.
Some of the leading theories on crop circles include extraterrestrials, wind vortexes, earth energies, and of course, hoaxes. But in 1985, farmers near one U.S. military base suspected the source of a recent incident to be the down wash from a helicopter's rotor blades.
The spinning of the blades caused the chopper to rise ... 
... forced the air downward, in effect, bending the grass below.
Since I'm a skeptic when it comes to aliens and earth energies, ooh. So we started with the chopper.
Decedent's T.O.D. was approximately 12:00 noon, yesterday.
You scared him to death. He had a heart attack. So the signing of a waiver doesn't make it any less criminal.
she was playing penny poker 
D.A. What's going on out here?
Hmm. Tasty.
Well ... I can't move the, uh ... the body until the coroner releases the scene. It's a busy night. It's probably gonna take a while, man.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, take your time.
Whew!
Hey, you, uh ... want some gum?
Hey ...
Well, that's peculiar.
Oh, yeah, yeah, down over at the, uh, Spur?
No way. You almost got into a beef?
Yeah, yeah, you play the scientist card.  You're a copologist.
No, he didn't.
So?
So, this is out in front of the hotel?
Did you tell them you're a cop?
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.
So what happened?
Yeah. Yeah. What'd you do on Sunday?
Duke it out.
Boy! Better flip a coin. I'll hurt you.
Call it in the air.
You know, I'd do two out of three, but you got a gambling problem.
No, hey, you know what?  You keep this. It's bad luck.
Enough ... enough with the damn light!
No.
The fan's connected ... the fan's connected to the light.
No.
It was Christmas in Las Vegas / when the locals take the town / Teresa hit a streak / and laid her waitress apron down / she was playing penny poker / over at the old Gold Spike / she tired of Texas hold 'em / so she switched to let it ride ... 
Hey!
I'm in here!
Hey!
It was Christmas in Las Vegas / when the locals take the town ... Teresa hit a streak / and laid her waitress apron down ... 
She was playing penny poker / over at the old Gold Spike ... 
The air.
Hey, I'm right here!
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
Oh, my God.
My name is Nick Stokes. If anybody finds this tape, turn it in to the Las Vegas ... PD. There should be a reward.
Mom ...  ... Cisco ... well, this is a lousy way to say good-bye, but it's all I've got.
I love you. You raised me right ... and I'm going to miss you.
Grissom ...
Oh, my God. No, no, no, no.
Help!
Yeah, yeah.
I promise.
Okay, okay.
Yeah, back at you.
No, you didn't do anything to me. And what your dad did, I ... I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much.
Hey, Kelly. Kelly.
Pick it up.
In a few years ... when you get out of here ... don't take it with you.
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.
That's it.
That's it.

Hey, Kelly. Kelly.
Pick it up.
In a few years ... when you get out of here ... don't take it with you.
Yeah. Yeah, that's it.
That's it.
That's it.
Rusty. They say I have a flinch.
Yeah, when do we have time to do that?
If we're not processing a scene or working evidence, we're in court. 
This girl seemed a little old to be lured by a lost puppy. So how'd this guy pull this off in a lot this public?
I bet he had a weapon. Threatened her, so he could drive.
Oh, yeah. Well, I'm taking it again day after tomorrow, so I figured I could work.
You're serious?
Copy that. I'll be in the lab.
Here's the Perez house, Alicia's walk route to school, and the convenience store where she was taken. All the locations are within a half-mile, plus or minus three-tenths.
This is a map of all registered s*x offenders in the state, the county, and the neighborhood.
Get out of jail, come to Vegas. They're listed in tiers of projected recidivism, zero through three. Three being the most dangerous.
If I remove the zeroes and ones, since they have a low or moderate risk designation, this is what we're left with.
Mm, maybe not.
Here, I'll isolate the Perez neighborhood.
Marlon Waylord, tier two, 38, black, lives alone, sometimes handyman and fits Jimmy Jones' description.
You take it right.
260 out of 300. 225's passing, which, I believe, was your high score.
Well, this is dad's car. You ever see those guys out in the street, with the scope, measuring distances? Always thought they were nuts for standing out in traffic, but ... 
Look familiar?
From the marks, it looks like you lasered over forty spots. In one session?
We'll need a copy of her medical records.
Hey, uh, do you have a problem with me, doctor?
Well, there are two of us here and you're only addressing my colleague, so...
What do Ozzy Osbourne, Iron Maiden and our victim all have in common?
Arsenic in her system, poisoning was chronic.
Techs collected the ingestibles found at her home. None were contaminated.
Not yet. Until the quants come back, we won't know if the concentration was lethal.
Right. Someone with access to the victim.
When's the last time you saw your mother?
How'd that go?
Why's that?
Mr. Stern, I also did a background check and you recently maxed out three credit cards.
You're weren't worried about paying off your debt, were you?
Do you use pesticides on your grapevines?
We're going to need a sample of that.
That's more than a coincidence.
Thanks.
Dr. Robbins did say Renita was in good shape.
How'd she have room for pancakes?
Do you think these supplements really do any good?
I'm just asking a question, Catherine.
More lotions and potions.
No. I'm gonna process the bathroom.
Hey, Catherine.
You might want to come take a look at this.
Urine in the bedpan and in the glass. 
She liked it fresh.
You getting religious on me?
Drinking your own pee?
It is a perversion of medicine, not to mention the bible. I don't get it. These women-- the time, the pain, the effort. For what? Smoother skin? Please.
What?
That's a good point, but it's not the same thing.
Well, thanks, I'm not even flexing it yet either.
No, no, it's all right, Super Dave. Nice purse.
Anything else?
Arsenicum. Holistic for arsenic. An oral spray? For refills, contact Dr. Malaga.
This is a doctor's office?
Thanks. I'm Nick Stokes. This is Catherine Willows. We're with the crime lab. We're here to see Dr. Malaga.
Botox injections-- 500 bucks. Restaylane injections-- 500. Micropeel--
You don't actually think you need this stuff, do you?
You don't.
Doctor, you are aware that arsenic is a poison, right?
Well, they teach you about arsenic in medical school?
So, what Ponce de Leon couldn't find, you did, huh? The Fountain of Youth. Snake oil in a fancy bottle.
Medicine is about healing. Hope is about prayer. That should be free.
So, Dr. Malaga was telling the truth -- both women were poisoned. But that's not what killed them.
Which means the red blood cells have lysed.
Something caused the red blood cells to lyse, or pop. The hemoglobin from inside those cells infiltrated the serum.
If a sufficient number of red blood cells lyse, a person dies.
We answer that question, we solve this case.
Well, were either one of their procedures sufficiently invasive as to compromise their blood?
Ms. Loakes also underwent hydrogen peroxide therapy... on the same day? Here's the menu of services provided by the spa.
Well, let's find out. I'll get the hydrogen peroxide.
Okay.
Here you go.
Upping the concentration of hydrogen peroxide to ... seven percent.
Okay.
Fifteen percent ... 
Concentration level 30%.
Concentration at 30%. That's ten times the three percent specified on the menu.
You okay to drive?
That's better than bouncing off the curb, I guess.
Sure.
Landlord's working late, trying to fix up the place for the new tenant, kicking up dust, paint fumes. Door's open for ventilation. Killer strolls in. Next thing you know, landlord's deli meat.
I'm having Detective Cavalier run down the evicted tenants. It's a Melissa Poolie and a Charlie Pinscher.
Crime scene cleanup.
You know, it's funny. I don't see an American bio-recovery badge.
Yeah.
Okay, Marty. I'll have the Detective release the scene.
Melissa Poolie?
He was holding your inventory hostage. How much you got tied up in Centipede and Space Invaders?
Mr. Pinscher, I'm going to need to go ahead and get your fingerprints.
I expect to find your prints in certain places, sir. We're just doing this to rule you out.
Only new items brought into the arcade post-eviction were the tools, tarps and paint cans. No prints from Charlie Pincher on any of them. Just the landlord and some unknowns on the saw.
Yeah, but you don't just lie down when somebody's trying to kill you, man. There had to have been a struggle.
I still like Charlie for this. I know we don't have enough for a warrant ...
Okay, Marty ... 
Oh, six figures.
It's decomp. Subtle, but it's in here.
We were tired.
Could be a dead rat.
I don't know, Rick. Your guess is as good as mine.
You trying to tell me you make between three and ten grand a week?
You should be ashamed of yourself, Marty.
The plastic must have covered the smell.
Hey, hey, hey.
Dental records ID'd the body found in the arcade machine. 
Your ex-girlfriend Melissa Poolie.
We also found semen in her vaginal cavity. It matches your dead landlord.
Yeah, the dead body someone crammed into Ms. Pac-man.
Mr. Pincher, when someone is killed with a table saw, blood gets everywhere -- your hair and your clothes. You would have had to take a long, hot shower, wash your clothes, clip your nails, toss your shoes. Are you sure you got it all, Charlie? Hmm?
That's a nice watch.
I was admiring the band. Lots of open spaces and nonporous surfaces. That's a perfect place for blood to hide, don't you think, Chris?
There's a chemical I use called phenylthaline. It can detect a speck of blood the size of a pinprick.
I bet if I take that watch it's going to tell me more than time, isn't it?
Did you kill him?
So you're thinking the weapon is still in here?
Why would the killer leave it in here?
That's true. Mr. Pinscher had a cash-only business.
You got something?
Yeah, she went a little further this time.
Don't worry, man, Grissom talked to the Sheriff, said he's gonna pick up your tab.
Mm-hmm.
See you around, Marty.
Hey, Grissom, why is it hot?
I don't see any tissue. How long would it take for them to pick a body clean?
Yeah, and that's another thing. I have a hard time believing that if a corpse was here, no one saw it. And these bones?  They're uniform. Same shape and size.
Remember, you're on the clock, man. About, uh, twenty-four hours ... all of these maggots turn into flies.
Then retrieve it and return it by the end of the week, right?
Has anyone from omega zeta pi dropped out or gone missing?
We're gonna need his toothbrush and his hairbrush.
Serials typically photograph their crime scenes. If we're dealing with an artist here ... maybe he drew his victims instead.
Windows, maybe. Can we blow that up?
Cramped space. Chairs in the foreground, but no other furniture. No shutters or curtains on the windows. Maybe it's not a room. Maybe it's a ... vehicle.
I recognize the signage. The Erotica Boutique on Tropicana.  It's distinctive ... the font ...
You're thinking she was raped with a foreign object ... may be why we never found semen.
I'll take the van.
Two years ago, Debby Reston broke her killer's glasses.
They were 20/80.
VIN's been obliterated. You better go ahead and run that parking pass.
Plate's expired. Registration sticker's a phoney.
Check out the serial number 
No. No, I superglued. Why?
Dead plates. Tampered VIN. Registration stickers are counterfeit. The killer did a good job, though. He used the right color, changed them every year, but no serial numbers.
Well, Greg did find this in the glove box.  It's from 1986. So I called school administration. It's parking spot 324. Not a student, but an employee executed two years ago. 
Yep. Ran Mathers through the DMV. The partial VIN Number on our van's a match. 
I don't think these two guys are an original and a copycat.
They were partners.
Week before he was executed.
All those years on death row he only had one visitor, his lawyer. Although he did receive a far amount of letters from random women ... if he was in communication with his partner, nothing in the file shows it.
Prison shrink diagnosed Mathers as a psychopath with a dependent personality disorder.
Maybe Mathers was this guy's surrogate pen1s.
Okay. Thanks, Hodges.
Kids have been going in and out of the suite all night, but the front desk only issued card keys to seven. Brass has five of them upstairs ...  Uh, Janelle Macklin and Sean Paland are unaccounted for, so I'll check the casino.
I was. He said he had it covered. Sofia Curtis is up there with him.
Hmm?
Uh-uh. Hey, I heard Grissom stuck you with his speech.
Why don't you come over here and talk to me for a second?
What, you need to tell your date?
Come here.
Hm ... you hang out with Nikki a lot?
Is that what was she doing up in the P. Diddy suite with your buddies?
Yeah, Janelle ... do you know where Janelle is now?
Man, there must be over a hundred shoeprints in here.
Thanks a lot.
So, Dean Tate was telling the truth.
So you're telling me when I take a sample of your DNA and compare it to the kabuki masks here ... that's not going to be you?
No. No, the evidence did that.
You see us laughing? 
Wendy lived here at 118 Sunshine Road in Green Valley. 
She left her weekly session with Dr. Lavalle at 8:00 P.M. here. Now, Officer Mann pulled her over on Industrial Road 24 minutes later.
Takes ten minutes to drive from the clinic to Industrial Road.
Yeah. I had Greg run it.
That's what I'm saying. She must've stopped somewhere between the clinic and where Officer Mann clocked her doing ninety.
Somewhere in this highlighted area.
Not so fast. Sara found this in the medicine cabinet. It's a post-it.
Doesn't have anything to do with the medicine cabinet. I thought it was map coordinates or something like that, but it's not. You know what they have a lot of up in this area?
Storage facilities.
G-105. Should be right down here.
Catherine.
What do you think went on here?
Maybe why I'm not getting any prints.
Hi, Jim.
Hi. Do you know a Vern Saldusky, aka Tawny, Peaches, Vava? 
Okay.
Thanks.
I've never seen junkies shoot up in the face before.
Do they?
Mm-mm.
No. No, that's all right.
Where can we find this humanitarian?
Do you know Vern Saldusky?
We know the name of the butcher.
I think we have a spitter, my friend.
Oh, yeah.
All right.
Well, you're here because I compared your DNA from this cigarette butt to sweat recovered from the inside of a latex glove at the crime scene.
Ms. Hamshaw ... Dr. Lavalle was performing illegal surgeries, and you were assisting. Now, why would you be involved with something like that?
So Tippi has two dads and one mom?
Okay, tell me about Wendy Garner.
Well, right up till her death.
Yeah, the guy was a jerk.
Well, if the print matches the suspect, who cares?
Catherine, do you remember why you were late to this crime scene? Eddie had a gig and you couldn't find a baby-sitter.
Free steak and eggs means she didn't know about the flight attendant.
I lifted six prints off the wrench. I ran them through I-AFIS. Five were a match to the suspect. One was unidentified. Now, at the time, we all agreed that that print was irrelevant, because the wrench was found in the common area.
Will do. Hey, Catherine ... we didn't do anything wrong here.
A perfect match.
The wrench was found in a toolbox in the suspect's restaurant. The murder happened after closing.
Mrs. Garbett.
Oh, okay-- Mrs. Katz. Duly noted.  Please, have a seat. I appreciate you coming down here and meeting with me.
You think he's guilty?
What I'd really like to do is get a list of anyone who had access to that restaurant five years ago.
Recent evidence has come to light ...
Oh, now that I can't discuss.
So you weren't living in town at the time of the murder?
Oh, okay.
Yeah, that'd be great.
The Garbetts' restaurant employed six waiters, two cooks, and a busboy.
Right: Garbett's ex-wife's, three of the waiters' and both cooks' prints were in I-AFIS because of work cards, but none was a match to the mystery print.
I ran their socials to get their addresses. I'll grab a uniform, go bang on some doors.
Hi. I'm Nick Stokes.
Good day, sir. My name's Nick Stokes. I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
I'm reinvestigating Max Larson's homicide.
I was hoping to get your, uh, your fingerprints if I could. It would help eliminate you as a suspect.
Thank you, ma'am.
Hi. Video spectral analysis.
We didn't have this equipment five years ago.
Good exercise. Everyone volunteered their prints but ... no match.
Expose the matchbook to white, and that covers the spectrum.
Rotate it 180.
Los Angeles.
Maybe. Defendant's son lived in L.A.
He was a Veterinarian?
We found some dog hairs at the crime scene. Out of context, it didn't really mean anything.
Keith.
Keith, what we'd really like to go ahead and do is get a set of your fingerprints, if we could. Okay?
There's more than one way to get his prints. Trash on the curb -- public property, right?
Sometimes the evidence isn't in the bag ... it's on it.
Thank you.
Game, set.
You lied to us. Said you were living in L.A. at the time of the murder.
They were in a box of records your mother sent over. You saw the business was going under. Their marriage was in trouble. And while the judge ruled against them, you snapped.
Oh, yes, ma'am. At minimum, they're looking at conspiracy.
Yeah, but I don't think it went down that way. After your father was convicted, you gave up on your veterinary practice. Moved back to Vegas -- spent every last dime you had on his defense. Now, that tells me you had a guilty conscience.
Your father spent the last five years in prison, man. If you love him so much, why don't you tell the truth? Set him free.
To protect yourself.
It was a team effort.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm familiar with the case, Conrad.
No, Grissom allowed me to pursue a new lead, under his supervision.
He kind of talked to all of us.
Oh, come on. You don't really believe that.
I got this -- that's the kind of cash I'm bringing down right now.
Above ground, Wilcox.
I'll take in.
This is a piece of the roof right here -- fiberglass and particle board. These things weren't built to last.
This place is totaled. The bed's collapsed.
Well, there doesn't seem to be any drug-manufacturing supplies, but plenty of ignition sources: a hot plate, fondue pot, gas stove, candles. One leaky pipe's all it takes.
Which I haven't found yet.
Okay, that means the natural gas didn't suffocate her. Explosion probably knocked her out before the fire even started.
Explosion could've done that.
Yeah, yeah, the UV light's definitely bringing out the bruises underneath the skin.
That looks like a tire mark.
Hey, hey ... Sara. Check this out. This is a piece of the exterior wall facing the road.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
Yeah. Yeah, just come straight through. Run him over in bed with another chick.
Yeah.
Well, '96 f Ford Ranger, stock paint.  Maybe I can match the transfer to this.
No, no, you go ahead. I'm gonna ...  I'm gonna work on this.
Amber Durgee was cheating on her husband, maybe even wanted him dead, but her truck didn't have anything to do with it.
Mm.
Found something?
Well, I found some blue paint transfer on that chain-link fence. As far as tracks go, this place is a parking lot, man. They're everywhere.
So, the trailer wasn't rammed?
Flying car.  That's what we're gonna go with?
mm-hmm. Okay.
The partial OEM number on the headlamp piece belongs to a '97 Pontiac Sunfire.
Well, GMC paint -- tire model wasn't that tough.
All right.
Michelin tires.
Can she cook? Is she a good cook? Come on, Warrick.
Hey, Grissom. We're taking Warrick to the Pepper Mill to celebrate his marriage and to condemn his elopement. You in?
All right.
Bye. So?
All right.
Hey, Hodges.
Yeah, and you have a tissue sample with adherent hairs. Examine the hairs and get the tissue sample to DNA. Priority.
You're coming around, Hodges.
Hey. I, uh, I have a visitor?
Kelly?
Hi. You ... you got out.
Mm ... 
You know, I thought I saw you at a crime scene the other day.
I did?
You all right?
Lift with the knees, Super Dave, lift with the knees.
I'll need to print the window, but, uh ... why don't we get to this first.
We have a print.
No way.
.32 Beretta. Victim was shot, right? It's going to be hard to get a print, but I'll get it to Ballistics.
Mr. Moyer, you're here about Hayden Bradford. Do you know him?
Yeah ... yeah, I'm sorry. We found his body this morning. You didn't recently try to break in his home ... did you?
We found a rock by a broken window, with your fingerprint on it.
Is that funny?
That still doesn't explain to me how your fingerprint got there.
You guys being good friends ... you were aware of his medical condition, right?
Do you know why anybody'd want to hurt him?
Who, Michelle?
I tried to call her cell phone and ...
But you can get me their home number, address, all that?
Hey, Grissom, you got a second?
No, I didn't.
You talking about Allison?
Well, if that's the case, why not try electrolysis or depilatory lasers?
Well, I just ran into Archie. The decedent used a company called peopledetectors.com to try to locate his mother.
Apparently not. She's alive and well, and has an address in Henderson, so I'm gonna go out there, check it out.
Yeah.
Sure. Why?
Hey, man.
What are you smiling about?
Is it?
No, thanks. I would like to know about my bullet, however. I assume it was homemade since the manufacturer doesn't sell it in silver.
Elemental properties are consistent with sterling silver jewelry.
What do you got?
Mm, I don't know. When you run, you usually take the car.
Hit with her own car in her own spot.
Looks like she saw the car coming. Impact's pretty evenly distributed. The car hit her straight on.
Pedal to the metal.
The killer knew how to steal a car.
No. No, it's wiped clean.
What's up with the focus?
For good reason.
If he touched the camera, maybe I can get some prints off it.
Yeah, this is Nick Stokes with the Las Vegas Crime Lab. We're trying to reach Kelly Gordon's parole officer.
Great. I need Kelly's contact information.
Kelly, where you going in such a hurry?
You know a lady named Sylvia Mullins?
Did you have a meeting with her yesterday?
So why did you have a meeting with her?
Hmm.
Ms. Mullins was found in her parking garage ... crushed by her own car. 
When you worked in the prison garage, did you just learn how to fix cars or did you learn how to steal them?
Does it look like I'm kidding you? You waited for her to get out of work so you could let her know how you felt about her.
Hold out your hands.
Hold out your hands. Ms. Mullins' air bag deployed on impact. Air bag dust gets everywhere. 
It's really hard to get rid of.
Hey, Catherine, I just got back trace on Kelly Gordon's fingernails. I was looking for air bag dust, but all Hodges found was air.
Okay, I'll have Sofia release her from holding. Those the vic's phone records?
A lot of 345s.
Where's that?
Suggests offshore accounts. It's not illegal, but it is very anonymous.
Well, that's a leap.
Hey, Archie.
If you got a couple of minutes, I need a voice comparison.
Kelly Gordon's voice on tape. I want to see if it's the other voice on the Walter Gordon audio file.
No, but he obviously told you.
You know what? Forget about it. If this girl's involved, that means she's capable of murder. It's all cued up for you. Her voice is first.
Hey, Grissom ... You want to talk to me?
Yeah. 
No. No, it's not a problem. And by the way, I heard the tape. I did a voice comparison.
Sylvia Mullins is the other voice on that tape. She's Walter Gordon's ex-business manager, so ... I'm pretty sure she had something to do with my kidnapping.
Yeah.
Yep.
Good.
Yeah?
The security guard confessed.
She did it.
Doesn't really matter now.
She's OD'ing. She's OD'ing right now.
Vicodine, INH, methadone. Kelly! 
Kelly! Kelly!
This party is organized like an invasion plan. 6:15: Bar set up and ready. 6:25: Lois greets guests in foyer. 7:15: Lois changes into her dinner outfit. Talk about attention to detail.
What about the interior cameras?
Hmm. I'll need a list of all the guests who were here tonight.
You're thorough.
And based on our interviews so far, only a few people actually left the room when Lois O'Neill was gone. 
Among others, her ... a pop star known as Li'l Cherry. She was due onstage at Mandalay Bay half an hour ago.
Mr. Jensen. I'm Nick Stokes. I'm with the Crime Lab. I'm familiar with your daughter's case. 
Sorry for your loss. You knew Mr. Constantine, right?  Were there any other friends of Mr. Constantine here tonight?
You want to elaborate a little bit more on those enemies?
Hey, man, I'm just trying to get to the bottom of what happened here tonight. Several witnesses said they saw you leave the room. Alone.
Mm.
Hey.
That would explain the prior injuries.
Yeah. I've been through the footage throughout the entire day. I've got party, staffers going in and out the back door. But, get this - same time, different entrance.
Yeah, a couple minutes late. Now, here ...
... around the time of the murder, same car ... pulls up ... waits.
Yeah.
Nevada 295, ocean, henry, union.
McGinnigle ... McGonigle.
McGonigle.
There. There, that piece of paper, zoom in on that.
What is that, a bar code?
Can you decode it?
Vincent Pullone was the vic's real name, and he arrived at the crime scene in Nanci McGonigle's car.
He was busy being dead.
Okay.
The same way they did.
It's probably just trash blown in from off the street.
Hey, Greg. Come here and check this out. 
A single set of ATV tracks goes off the trail back there into here -- killer could've dumped the ATV and then got on the bus.
Another precaution to cover your tracks.
I'd say it's our guy. 
And I think he just gave us the finger.
The tire model is a Dunlop KT-345. I checked with the local dealers. The only ATV that uses that particular type of tire has only been on the market for about a year. It's called the Yamaha Raptor. So I got the list of the names of everybody in Las Vegas who's recently bought one. The only Cooper on the list is female -- Janice.
Yeah. It's, uh, second page.
Jim ... ATV has the right tires and there are plenty of machine tools and parts back there to build a silencer.
Looks like they starved her to death first.
No clothes, no shoes, no hair.
No right hand either. Could have been disarticulated by a wild animal.
Branding.
Tell that to a bull when he gets stuck on his rear with a hot iron.
Could be an infection.
That kind of defeats the purpose of an eye transplant, doesn't it?
Yeah.
Hey, Sara, got your message. No AFIS hits on my Jane Doe. So I put a bulletin out to surrounding agencies and the media. Maybe somebody will recognize her from the photo. Where you at right now?
Did you get a peek under the patch?
Right, right, but lobotomies -- they're not common practice today?
He's not a suspect; he's a victim.
Jane Doe is #19.
She chewed off her own hand?
Animals in traps do it all the time.
Like a rat.
Right now, the hand's all we have to go on.
Hey, look, the condition she was in, she couldn't have gotten very far. Maybe if we find the hand, we find the torture chamber.
All right, everybody gather around. Let me have your attention. We're going to proceed forward covering the immediate area bordering the road to the south, the rocks to the west and the dry creek bed to the east.
Woah, you smell decomp?
Maybe. Let's get a sample.
Somebody who's trying to cover up the real deal.
LVPD!
We can look, but not touch.
All right, here's the real catch-22. If we open it up, find something probative, we can't use it. But we can't find something probative ...
Yeah.
I'm not. Grissom is.
Yeah, it's all about genetic modification.
Isn't that the same guy from the Betz Clinic?
Mr. Wolfowitz?
Mr. Wolfowitz, come out of there now. We're from the Crime Lab. We need to speak with you.
Hey, Catherine. 
So Brass has put the lockdown on the airport, bus depot and train station. But so far, no Sneller. 
Well, speaking of twin we got a call from Social Services. Sneller was their birth name. But they were adopted by a Jewish couple named Wolfowitz.
Maybe he went Nazi, trying to kill the Jewish half of himself.
Good!
Okay.
I smell a little decomp, but mostly the fireplace down below. The body's really positioned too far to be in that condition.
Check out that mold. It's just eating away at the flesh.
He?
Wrap and roll.
Okay, you get the head.
On three ...
One, two ... three.
Most of the muscle and flesh have burned away. He's pretty well drained of fluids. He probably weighed twice as much when he was alive.
Yeah. Get him to the morgue.
Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside?
Well, synthetics are just plastic polymers. They melt instead of burn.
Good, good. I'll work it up; try to get an ID.
Yeah, it's a charred piece of plastic found in chimney guy's pocket. It may be a credit card. I'm trying to get some ID off of it.
How do you know that?
Oh, yeah? You, uh ... been pumping iron there, Greg?
Yeah, okay, thanks. Anyway, I'll, uh, check it. Maybe I can get a membership name.
Oh. Maybe it'll help us clear up the photo.
Nice.
A gym card. Actually, it was found in his pocket. The Crime Lab restored the charred image, but we couldn't get a name. We we're hoping you could help make a positive ID.
Yes, sir. You recognize him?
Let me guess: He burned to death.
Come on, Doc, this isn't a hard one. 
It's not uncommon to find bone fractures in fire victims.
The body produces heat, causing the long bones to contract and fracture.
Bone chipping is also a symptom of extreme heat.
What are you getting at?
Yeah ...
No. No, it can't.
You sure you remember this guy who stole Tad Sidley's credit card?
Grissom, meet Larry. Larry's from the Gas and Go.
Yeah, I downloaded it myself.
Two pieces of duct tape; both have been swabbed for DNA and fingerprinted. Grissom wants you to compare adhesives. He's looking for a match. ... 
Why's that good?
Are you looking for the video crew right now?
Relax, man, the show's only an hour long. Laser ablation takes, like, six.
I lifted two identifiable prints off the bouquet wrapper.
We don't, but one matched a print found on the duct tape, right here, used to tape up the victim. 
Apparently not, no.
Dwight Reynolds. Police are bringing him in now.
Thanks. Yeah, well, we have to do it in court all the time. If you can't explain it to a jury, then the bad guy usually walks, and we don't like it when the bad guy walks.
A search of the defendant's house yielded a laundry hamper containing the clothes he wore the night of the murder.
No. We determined they had been bleached. 
Human hairs consistent with the victim -  -- were discovered in the drain of the bathroom sink. DNA was extracted and was also matched to the victim.
That's correct.
Of course he did. She's just a mixed-up kid trying to protect her older brother. All the evidence points to Marlon.
All right, then we have to prove that Hannah could not have done this.
We'll need a week to reexamine the evidence.
Come on ...
The judge suppressed the video because the child advocate was never brought in, even though Marlon had waived his rights. We really didn't need a confession out of him. The case against this kid was solid.
It started out as a prank: A sabotaged showerhead.
pH tests later revealed the presence of a strong base substance, which was later identified as sodium hydroxide. 
A high school chemistry favorite, yeah. Just add water, and instant kaboom.
Yeah, I matched the spindle marks on the paper to a laser printer in the high school library.
Mm-hmm.
No, no, it did not.
Well, the vic was injured, disoriented. She grabbed the first thing she could to cover up and ran.
The intermittent blood trail started in the locker room and headed down a hall.
Or chased her out, yeah. There's no way to know. Either way, she ended up at the bottom of the stairs. The size of the blood pool indicates that the fatal wound occurred there.
Well, yeah -- she's four-foot-three and 65 pounds. The crime just required more strength than she's got.
Twelve.
She's a high school senior. She skipped six grades. She's a prodigy.
Yeah, but not the brawn. The body was moved from the high school building across a football field and then hastily buried. The vic's car was then driven two miles from campus and parked in front of the house of a kid named Scott Baird, Stacy's boyfriend -- I think possibly to frame him.
No. He plays varsity hoops. He was out of town on an away game.
I found blades of grass with blood on them near the vic's car -- nondescript tracks headed towards the next-door neighbor's house.
Yeah. This kid's been in trouble before. Multiple fights, threats. It just got out of hand this time. Marlon West killed Stacy Vollmer. His little sister's just trying to exonerate him.
Hodges, did you get the soil analysis back on Hannah's shirt?
Really!
Uh, I kind of doubt it.
What isn't easy, Hodges?
I know the feeling.
This is Marlon's room.
It's pretty much the way I left it. The bleached clothes were in the hamper.
But the real action ... was in here.
Pulled Stacy's hairs out of the sink trap the first through. And I found some burn marks around the bathtub drain. pH tested positive for sodium hydroxide, so ... I figured Marlon probably did a test run.
The scope of the warrant only covered Marlon's room and other common areas of the house. I popped my head in here. Nothing in plain sight at the time.
It wasn't in plain sight. I didn't check it.
Yeah, it's a party game where boys get the girls to wear different colored lipsticks while they have oral s*x. Boy with the most colors wins. Supposed to be trendy.
Carrie. Weird high school girl gets humiliated at the prom, only to exact her revenge. Hannah wanted us to find this.
Yeah, I had Mandy run the unknowns from the original case against Hannah's prints. She got a match.
This curtain was used in the handicapped shower. Why would she do that?
Mm-hmm. Four ... fingers, closely spaced. Grabbing, maybe.
Hannah weighed 65 pounds. Stacy about a hundred. Dead weight.
DA's not going to like the sound of that.
Starting to look that way, yeah.
Mm, I don't know. I don't think Hannah's really the video-game type.
If he's willing to talk, I'd say, we caught a break.
We need it quickly, all right?
What do you mean by most?
Same one that printed the out of order signs for the shower.
Mm-hmm.
So much for the boyfriend.
I have a better idea.
Yeah, playing football, chasing girls, books when I wanted to learn something -- What's not to like? 
Hey.
Yeah. You were right; she's about Hannah's size.
Okay. Crime started right here.
Depends on what's behind the curtain.
A stool. Just like the one in Hannah's bathroom. Try this.
Darcy, why don't you put those headphones back on?
Maybe. But the next part, that was the toughest.
Yeah, so far.
That's okay. Look, even if she makes it to the grass, you think she could've pulled the body the entire length of the football field?
There were scratches on the shower curtain -- the body was dragged at least part of the way.
Not by herself. They did it together.
If Marlon and Hannah worked this crime together, then they're probably still working as a team.
Mm-hmm. Well, if we can't get one to implicate the other, we're screwed.
Marlon, you need to confirm that you're willing to talk to me without a parent or lawyer present, just a child advocate.
Well, the truth works for me. I like the truth.
You moved the body, you buried it ... 
Well, the problem is what happened in the locker room. I mean, you're not the kind of guy who puts sodium in a showerhead to get back at somebody. You just trip them in the hallway.
I don't think you're stupid, Marlon; I didn't say you were stupid. But this is Hannah's game. The whole way.
It takes skills to handle a chemical like that properly. And, quite frankly, man, you just don't have the skills.
No, no, she had everything to do with this. You two were working together from the beginning.
The evidence says either one of them could have done it, but I think they were in it together.
That's right around Stacy's TOD. 
But one of them did answer the door.  So that means they were not together at the time Stacy was killed.
Marlon's your guy. He's your guy -- just because Hannah wasn't there doesn't mean she didn't help plan this.
I stand by the case we filed.
Julian Harper.
Wasn't he supposed to be like, uh ...  the next Brad Pitt or something?
Semen on the bed sheets, as well as every other flat surface in here.
Hey, hey. Pantyhose.
Was this guy just doing it all over the hotel room?
Or her feet were up ... in the air. You tell me -- you just had your honeymoon.
Hey, Archie. See if you can help me out. There was a smear on the window at the hotel. It came back saliva. So I ran it through CODIS, got a hit--felony battery on this guy, Willie Angel.
Now, he's a Las Vegas resident, but he wasn't a registered guest at the hotel. He has no affiliation with Julian's little entourage whatsoever.
Really?
Do it up.
Mm-hmm.
Shopping bags? There's no mall on that floor. He was shopping at Julian Harper's.
The Palms issued two card keys -- one to Julian, and one to his boy Blinky. But the database shows ... one, two ... three keys were used to access the suite?
So ... how'd Willie get it?
Ho-ho-ho! Slick Willie. Look out now.
Well, I bet you're real lucky with this cheap magnetic stripe reader and palm top, huh?  You know you can get into most hotel rooms in the city with this thing?
You take the old card key, you input the room number, a little magnetic encoding ...
... and Bob's your uncle.
You used the card to open the door. You get into his suite and hide.
drops his wallet and takes off his watch
You rob him blind.
But he wakes up. So it's kill him or go back to jail.
You were in his suite for over two hours, man. That's more than enough time to snag a couple shopping bags.
Certainly looks like she's been through something rough.
Good eyes.
Can you follow her out?
Man, you gotta quit kissing his ass.
That's got to be at least a few G's.
Solicitation murder? Manager pays to have her client whacked.
Let me guess! ... 
... the fibers are wool. Are you bagging Z's right now, man?
I bagged some black socks and some black pantyhose.
No. No, they were all balled up. I just bagged them and tagged them.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, we've got to get this to DNA.
I thought Greg was in the field. Is he back in the lab?
We've got to clear this up. It's like he's confused. Lab, field, field, lab. We have a lab on wheels.
The vic had a pair of black cotton socks.
Okay, transfer from the sock to the pantyhose, to the neck. So the sock was in between the pantyhose and the neck?
There were only two girls in the suite. Which one of them killed him?
Burnt pantyhose. Okay, evidence of s*x games gone wrong.
Well, something singed the hose.
Hmm?
Do I have to?
Hey, this is Stokes. I need a lift, Convention Center Drive. 
That's a lot of racket. Somebody heard something.
Old school's the new school.
So, what do you think? This has got to be a gang war, huh?
No personal effects! No keys, no ID! Nothing!
Either these kids were traveling light, or they were robbed blind.
What up, Country? 
Which means it was probably fired from a polygonal barrel. Did you run cartridge casings yet?
That's a $2,500 firearm. That's not your typical street piece.
Really?
Yeah, yeah, here you go.
You said definitely.
I'll get a warrant. You don't mind taking a break for a while, sitting on the curb while we get some cops up in here.
Good man.
That's the same part of town where the SWAT cop lost his gun.
How long ago did I call for backup?
Dispatch, this is unit 3D7. We are 465 at 59391 Sandhill. ETA on that backup?
Copy that. We'll sit tight.
With a gangster in it.
He saw us.
Go for it, go for it.
Dispatch, this is unit 3D7. Suspect is on the move. It's a, uh, royal blue Chevy Impala northbound on Vegas Valley Drive. License 4-2-3-
Where are we now? Where are we now? 
Dispatch, Westbound Hatteras. Westbound Hatteras. Suspect is now west on Crag Avenue.
We're now southbound on Eastern.
Dispatch, uh, this is unit 3D7. Suspect has pulled into an alley on the 7700 block on Eastern. Requesting backup.
That's right, we're not cops. We're mad scientists.  Back away from the vehicle and let me see your hands right now. 
I'm not going to tell you again.
Let me see your hands.
Whoa, whoa, hey, right here.
Check him for weapons, Mitch.
Be cool. Cool. Just be cool.
Hey. How'd things go with Ecklie?
Don't worry. I'll talk to him.
Yeah, but we don't have a murder weapon, so we can't confirm Morris was the shooter. 
The only thing the victims on the ground had on them were the clothes on their back. And the kid in the palm tree, empty satchel.
And tox panels on them all came back negative. There were no drugs in their system, no personal effects. I doubt they were even packing.
All right, now wait a minute, Grissom, there were posters all over that street. Man, we have no way of knowing which posters they put up.
I'm guessing this is not his next album cover.
So this is a rap thing?
If these guys would shoot somebody over lyrics, they'd definitely kill over this.
Hey, Jim, check it out. Geniuses hitting on 21. P-I-M-P.
Yeah, and what's with all the boxes, clothes?
Hmm.
Yeah, is that it?
Don't worry, we're gonna get you out of there and get you medical attention.
We need your prints so that we may exclude you as a suspect.
Okay, look, why Dudes Gone Nutz?
Looks like Dollar's crew is here, too. All the rappers come to MAGIC. Go ahead, I'll catch up.
Hey, guys.
How you doing?
No, thanks, man, I'm all set. You know, personally, I think it's a bad idea to hit on blackjack.
I know all about Dollar. What's your connection?
I work with the police department, yeah. Crime Lab. My name's Nick Stokes.
What's the deal with these street teams. What's going on?
You know, three kids were murdered the other night doing the exact same thing.
Yeah, I don't know about that. They were putting up posters of your boy Dollar -- ones that made him look a lot stupider than just hitting on blackjack, you know what I mean?
Take a look at these kids. See if you recognize any of them.
Show them.
Yeah, okay.
I'll see you soon, Dawg.
Hey.
Mm-hmm.
I figure Dante had that revolver when he was going up and down those poles. Grip gets thumped, chips off in the satchel.
Wood grain seems consistent, this means Dante made the video.
Mm-hmm.
I don't know. I don't know, but on the video, Dante did say, Who's the bitch now? So ... you could say it got a little personal.
Tisha ... what happened to your face?
And Dante blamed Dollar. 
So he joins Dollar's street team to get close to him, close enough to sneak into his hotel room and videotape him, the same way he videotaped you.
Smells like bacon in here.  Slide over. That scene took forever. We were there like, what, nine hours? 
Come for a wedding, stay for the funeral. Why do we always eat here?
Oh, that's not what a wedding is. It's a public declaration of love.
Pass the cream, will you?
It's parked right ...
We were seated at a booth, with clear visual access to the vehicle. A delivery truck pulls up, blocks our view.
Two, three minutes, tops.
Bread, dairy ... I can't remember.
Yeah. Yeah, it didn't go off.
Yeah, absolutely. And I have a tracking system on my truck, too. I called it in as soon as I realized it was missing.
Hey, Jim. 
I need a ride.
Well, thankfully, that didn't get stolen. Where is it?
Oh, you really have a thing about weddings, don't you?
Should I put flirting in the case file?
Hmm.
No. No, I didn't get anything. She must have put it in my pocket. Mindy.
The perfume of American beauties was everywhere. Though a rose by any other name would have smelled just as sweet on a day with that much love in the air. 
Ladies, hi, how you doing?
I'm with the Crime Lab. My name's Nick Stokes. I'm going to need to print you both, okay?
You were in the wedding party. Did you spend most of the day here with Ms. Chase?
There you go.
So, she was a drinker?
Yeah.
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I caught that guy trying to sleep one off in the bushes. That's the groom's old man.
I sent him to detox, in the tank.
One suspect down.
That's ... that's weird. Her ex-husband told Brass she was very anti-psychopharmaceuticals.
That explains Mindy's account of her behavior. And the toast.
So how does that help explain how Diane Chase died?
Narrows the field of suspects down to someone who had access to that suite.
Where's the statue?
Ah!
So?
I thought you'd never ask.
Anything to keep me awake.
... and I kind of smell, and I don't have a freaking car.
Hey.
Hey, this, this sucks, man. I didn't do anything wrong, and everybody's looking at me like I'm the bad guy. 
If I had to do it all over again, I'd do the exact same thing.
I mean, how do I ... 
... fix the situation?
It was already screwed up to begin with.  What?
I loaned one of the bridesmaids my jacket. She was wearing black. There was no reason to ALS. Blood must have transferred from her to my jacket, to me. I didn't want to contaminate it by pulling it over my head, you know?
All right. Hey, Wendy, ... 
I don't know if you'll be able to get anything off of this, but I want you to compare the female epithelials you found on the snowboard bag against the napkin that I have in my right front pocket.
Come on.
Oh. Oh, that's not funny.
That Mindy Faberge?
Yeah.
Well, she was in the suite with the gifts. She could have touched it then.
Wow, for somebody who's anti-wedding, you certainly know a lot about it.
At which point Lacey tells Mindy and Cindy. 
They formulate a plan.
They tie her to the car, chuck the bag in the trunk, return to the party.
Do you remember the name of the company?
Sheritown Inc. We're going to need access to all of the surveillance footage from tonight, all right?
Okay.
Two glasses. Think our vic got lucky?
Jeans ... full of holes. Must've been wearing them a long time. 
I remember my first time to Vegas. I got one of these - Guide to Blackjack. Everybody dreams of hitting it big out here, don't they? 
We have a winner.
California driver's license.
Company credit card.
Amateur Speedway Association card.
Guy liked fast cars.
No cash. This sounds like a classic trick roll.
Kid from of town on a lucky streak-- 
He's an easy mark.
Get him up to the room ...
loosen him up ...
... jump him and dump him.
There's a long-haired blonde.
Time stamped 10:52 P.M. He entered his room a couple of minutes later. Manager said the last time he used his card key was 10:54 P.M.
He doesn't have a jacket on. He's probably not going too far.
Mm-hmm.
Grab that.
Print that.
How do you lose him? Aren't there a hundred cameras in there?
Freeze that.
Enhance that bag.
The vic was wearing a Sasan jacket. 
I'm going shopping.
But you were working last night.
Do you, uh, do you recognize either one of these people?
How about this? Recognize that?
Credit card receipt, anything like that?
Mm-hmm. Buy anything for her?
Thank you.
Must not have been a very good one.
Mm-hmm, okay. A guy like that gets beat by a punk kid on the street it's gonna be an assault on his manhood.
Okay. I'll see if I can place him at the hotel. I'll let you know.
Hey, Arch.
Surveillance footage from the Palermo?
Ooh. She didn't look too happy.
You think that was on purpose?
It's safe to say she wasn't after him for his money.
Any guy would help a beautiful woman in distress, right? 
Yeah, and he was a NASCAR fan. So the whole staged car chase, narrow getaway was everything he dreamed about.
I don't get it. After a night like that, I would have felt like Superman. Why leave the girl?
Hey. Want to know why Jeff left the girl and went downstairs?
This was dropped off at the Palermo. Manager sent it over.
Mm-hmm. Jeff must have spent the ten g's he won playing pool on it.
Gift wrapped, never picked it up.
You know, the biggest fantasy in Vegas is that everything here happens by chance. Nothing here happens by chance. The odds are set before you get off the plane.
So, I hear your marriage is on the rocks, and you're shopping for hookers?
Sally. Sweet apple pie. Hmm. Do you really think it's a good idea to sleep with a girl who advertises in a flyer?
Hmm.
All right, for your enjoyment.
Hi. This is, uh ... Dirk ... Diggler. I'm looking for a date.
I'm taking a trip around the world. Want to go?
Is two g's enough?
3057 Westfall. It's right off of Charleston. 
It's a single level building, all the way in the back.
Um ... I have a little Tom Cruise thing going.
All right.
Ah, sweet apple pie! The Cruiser.
Well, you're not here about prostitution, sweetie.
No. I need your help with a homicide.
Why don't you go ahead and have a seat? Thanks.
This man's wife was murdered last night. His name's Willie Cutler. Was he ever a client?
Yeah.
Deal? What, like a travel agent?
No ... no, me either.
Yeah, I'm working.
No ID. Probably decapitated by the train.
They probably didn't have time to finish the job before other trains roared through here.
You know, there's not a lot of blood on the ground for a decapitation like this.
I'll find it.
Yeah?
Thanks, that will help me distinguish it from the other severed heads I find out here.
The guy had an itch.
That makes sense, as much orthopedic pain as the guy was in.
Hey, you checking out my waist?
Oh. Congratulations.
Fibers.
Means those were the clothes he was wearing.
Did you get a manufacturer?
There's insect activity all over these fibers. Maybe moths or mites. Check it out.
Maybe. Did you analyze the bone fragments?
You been to the hospital?
I'll keep good thoughts.
Yeah, she's here. Been drinking a ton of coffee and going outside for smokes; on her cell. Not real sociable, you know? You want me to keep an eye on her?
Nah. I'm off the clock. I'll stick around for a while, let you know if there's any change.
Which means she'd been down here at least an hour or two before you guys even got here.
How'd the tequila get back inside?
Okay, sir. I'm going to need to take your clothing.
No, that's okay. We're still processing upstairs. You can remove them right here and I'll give you a jumpsuit.
Those don't look like mosquito bites.
Okay.
Quick. How many teeth in the human mouth?
Yep, and the 28 teeth in Becky's mouth do not match the bite impressions on her husband's body.
No, no. I'm with you. Was the video encrypted?
Did you get an ID on Buffy?
Are you kidding me?
Huh.
You e-mailed Ray digital video of your sessions together.
Um, Dr. Cohen, did, uh ... did, uh ... 
... Ray ever mention his wife?
Uh, ma'am ... would you mind biting down on this for me?
Hey, Doc.
Perimortem.
He was dumped in a backyard by a whole bunch of other people. Do you think they could've beat him to death?
Hey!
How many we looking at Doc?
Okay.
Oh, man. What is this place, a mini Jonestown?
I'll process the bottles.
I said all the prints on the bottles belong to the victims. The prints on the funnel came back unknown though.
It matched to Ty Bentley, but we can't confirm he was murdered. For all we know, he fell down that shaft.
Yeah, tox results just came back: 40 grams percent ethanol. Now, that's about 80 proof. Kind of smelled like vodka, the cheap stuff.
No, but you add ten grams percent of ketamine and they do.
Yeah, or the Copelands' dog for that matter. Ketamine's a disassociative anesthetic, which means they were hallucinating, having out-of-body experiences ... 
Well, there are a lot of different ways they could have killed themselves, so I'm guessing that was the point. 
Well, we didn't find any ephedrine, which is generally used to cut ketamine. Veterinarians use liquid injectable ketamine as an animal sedative, so Sofia's checking with the local vets now.
Between 3:00 and 3:30.
Approximately. It varied with body weight. Took between 12 and 20 minutes for them to die.
Ketamine's really hard on the stomach; it induces vomiting.
I think a combination of alcohol and the drug just slowed their lungs.
Ultimately, they died of respiratory arrest.
Has it been forensicated?
It's a low priority for CSI.
Hmm, and where to look for it. Drugs have been alphabetized.
K for ketamine.
Okay, well, it's probably an inside job. Just get me a list of current and former employees, and we'll ... go from there. Thanks.
Wow, it's alphabetized.  Now what are you doing?
Okay.
The prints found at the clinic break-in are a perfect match to the ones lifted off of the tire iron and the funnel.
Her W-2's in the file.
Sheriff? Who, uh ... who called it in?
Without the bodies, I can't confirm there was a murder.
What do you know about the family?
Sounds like all that's missing is the white picket fence, huh?
Begin at the beginning.
Oh, no. No, I didn't do it. Coffeemaker's programmed to go on Monday through Friday.
You'd have to be alive to do that. 
Blood pools are dry, so, crime scene's at least 12 hours old.
There were at least three major blood events -- Here ... here ... and up the stairs. Without the bodies, we'll have to confirm the source of the blood through DNA comparison.
The sheriff confirmed the McBrides' cars are parked out front, and their cell phones, car keys, wallets are all right there.
Mm.
Yeah.
There is that men's nine-and-a-half between blood pool number one and blood pool number two.
Yeah, they're consistent with the mom, size nine. No matches to Jeremy or Cassie, though.
Could explain why there are only three blood pools.
I'll go up there and see what I can find.
What is that?
Oh, yeah? How's that?
Whatever happened to just flipping burgers, man?
If this was a territory war, or something like that, wouldn't the dealer want to take the new growth, to try to put these guys out of business?
Yeah, if they didn't care before, I bet they do now.
Okay, Ecklie's sending out a tech. I'll include it with the other evidence.
No outgoing calls from the house after 6:00 P.M. Friday night. I scrolled through Jude McBride's recent cell phone calls. No activity all weekend until Sunday night. Several incoming calls, all from the same number. According to Pioche PD dispatch, it's the same number as the anonymous 911 call. So I had the phone company cross-check it. The guy's local: Dr. Malcolm Parker.
Hi. Can I help you?
Yeah? So am I.
And what was your name again?
Sage. Okay, yeah, maybe you can help me out. Um, the family, what do you know about them? Are they having problems? Marital problems, anything like that?
Really?
No.
Really.
No, ma'am.
Because I'm just trying to make it through this one.
Hey ... Sage.  Thanks.
What size shoe do you wear?
Can I see the bottom?
Oh, yeah, they're new, huh?
Huh. You know, when I played ball, I used to stick all my gear in the trunk.
Parking lot still school property?
Why don't you go ahead and pop the trunk for me?
Fellas. We have a little problem. Mark's not talking, not even to pass the buck. And his dad, Mark Sr., is a lawyer, and he's challenging our search and seizure, saying that even though we were on school grounds, we lacked probable cause to search personal property.
... or they took her alive. Thanks, Catherine.
DNA confirmed to everyone but Cassie.
Mm-hmm.
All right, thank you.
All right.
No ... no, you go ahead, I'll catch up.
None of her blood was found at the house.
I don't think she was drugged. She's a smart little girl. She hid that cough medicine in her shoe; that's like hiding green beans in your napkin, you know?
Doesn't mean we just give up. 
I was rescued.
I don't think it was Cassie's day.
Hey! 
Sara, did you find any gum on that boat? Any gum at all -- wrapped, unwrapped-- anywhere?
I think Cassie was on that boat -- alive. I think she was leaving us a trail ... of gum, gum drops.  In the driveway, in the car, on the boat. It's like Hansel and Gretel. Half the pictures I've seen her in, she's chewing gum.
You tell Sheriff Brackett I'll meet you at the station.
How'd you hurt your hand? 
What's the matter? She fight back? 
You tried to drug her, but guess what? She was too smart for you. You coached the little girls' swim team, 'cause you liked to watch 'em in their bathing suits, is that it? You're gonna answer me right now! 
No more screwing around! Where is she?!
Where is she?
Where is she?
Okay, my guess is the guys stopped at the ATM to get cash for gas. That's cash only, and Eddie over there says he filled the tank to the top Friday night.
Sure, what's up?
Oh, yeah.
I know, I'm sorry. I apologize for that.
Three-quarters of a tank. Took an eighth to get out there, an eighth to get back.  And according to the gas mileage, on the Lockes' boat, that would have been about three miles out from this launch point right here.
Come on.
Yeah?
Stop the boat. Stop the boat. Let me out. 
Let me out.
Hi.
You're welcome, sweetie.
They're in Vegas.
Their bodies are in the coroner's office, honey.
Hey, Cassie ... I know when bad things happen, it's hard to remember. But if I give you some details, do you think you could tell me the story of what happened to your family?
Okay. We'll go slow, okay?
And we'll just begin at the beginning, okay?
Virgin Mary?
You mean dry humping?
Right. Sperm meets labia, all bets are off.
Thanks, Dr. Ruth.
Don't be caught picking your nose.
Looks like a porcupine.
No, Bell and Adams must have really been swerving and weaving.
I heard Bell was a rookie, barely off training. It was just his time, I guess, huh?
I'll call and have the suspect's vehicle towed to CSI.
Are they saying what I think they're saying? 
Senora, donde esta su hija, huh? Queremos hablar con ella.
Usted vio algo de lo que paso? No?  Nobody saw anything.
The story keeps changing till you don't know what the truth is or whose story it was to begin with.
Oh-ho-ho! Yeah! That's what I'm talking about.
Whoa. What are the chances of that happening?
Well, the bullet had to come from Officer Davis's pistol ... but if you're the suspect, don't you know your gun's getting hit?
You don't have to tell me; I know it was crazy out there. You know, I pulled 78 bullets out of one car. Davis just got lucky.
Well, there you go. Proves he was pointing the gun at the officer. See you in court; stroke one up for the good guys.
Hey.
No. I was having too much fun in here.
Yeah, sure.
What are you looking for?
Okay. Although, most hide-a-keys are held on with a magnet, which would've been demagnetized by the heat of the gasoline fire.
Nope.
Maybe. Auto transport usually sweeps up the debris. Good luck with that.
Looking for something?
Where'd you find that?
Well, I've been through this car twice. There's no evidence of cartridge casings, blood, drugs of any kind. So there was nothing here to begin with, they cleaned it out pretty good before they torched it.
Yeah, me either. I'd have to shoot through both cars to get to you. I processed them both -- no shots entered from the back.
Yeah, now.
Okay, he popped up, took one in the vest.
Mine's been on the whole time. It's still blocked.
He stood up.
Double murder?
Bitch on wheels. Can't wait to meet her.
Residentials are a low priority. They're usually false alarms.
If this was a robbery, they missed all the good stuff.
Abrasion on his forehead. No visible blood. Blonde hairs on his shirt. Both victims are brunette.
If her neck was sliced with a knife, it was probably serrated. The wound's too jagged for a straight one.
Smudges in the blood trail. Ovoid shapes suggest directionality. Satellite stains also suggest suspect moved this direction. 
There is good money in vinyl. Especially if it's rare and well-preserved. Who would kill somebody over a bunch of records?
Loose strike. Would have been pretty easy to get in from back here.
Sofia said the door was open; maybe he took off. Bloodstains stop at the grass. Sprinklers are on now, kissing the evidence good-bye.
Yeah?
I'll call Animal Control.
Yeah, yeah, I'm petrified. So what's the outside chance of rabies?
Well, other than rabies, what would make a dog attack its owner? Abuse?
Yeah, yeah, I hate that show, too.
Yeah, I'll prep the microsil, if you prep the pooch.
DNA confirmed all the blood at the crime scene is Lori Tinsley's.
Well, Michael did send his girlfriend Missy over to retrieve his vinyl, but last night he broke in himself, not to mention she was home. That's kind of asking for trouble, isn't it?
Yeah, me either. Hodges.
Have you processed the hairs yet?
You know, studies have found that pet owners have lower stress levels. You should check that out.
Michael Tinsley was shot?
Looks like a .22 caliber.
The Tinsleys died at home ... alone. So, where's the gun?
Well, a dog did attack Lori, but it wasn't Kahlua. The bite marks on Lori's neck are inconsistent with Kahlua's teeth.
Check out this left canine.
All the dog hair we found at the crime scene was consistent with a golden retriever, which suggests there was another golden retriever in the house. It could've attacked Lori, fled out the kitchen door.
I'm calling Animal Control. We're looking for another golden retriever, one with a bad tooth and rotten disposition.
Oh, Hodges, heel. No, better yet, play dead, man.
Hey.
Custody over what? They didn't have any kids.
I think I know why.
Lori greased up before the big face-off.
A dog's sense of smell is 25 times more sensitive than humans. Bacon grease would've been pretty irresistible.
Stokes. Yeah, all right, cool. Our suspect is in custody.
New collar, new tags. Kahlua. Same name.
Michael Tinsley. You bet.
Left tooth is chipped. Confirm's ID. She doesn't seem very ferocious.
Yeah.
So the gun acted as a trigger. She heard it and attacked Lori.
The police showed up, she got scared , went back to her closet.
I got it.
Aircraft carrier. That's what this place reminds me of. Of course, an aircraft carrier was built for national security and this ... 
... is a ton of hi-tech, twisted steel for the sake of entertainment.
Yeah, and anybody familiar with the stage would know to avoid that area.
There's the vic, right?
It's dark, they're wearing black ... crew's focused on their jobs ... it's possible nobody saw them.
Give me the time code when she dropped the purse.
Okay, let me know when the cliff deck is where it was at that point in the show. Um, I think it was just before the wash up to the shore scene. That was at, uh, 21 minutes, 37 seconds.
Yeah, that's great. That's great right there, thanks.
Okay ... go find your friend.
Okay, move the deck into its next position, please.
You know, if you want to dive in here and give me a hand, this might go a little faster.
Okay, hang on. I think I found something.  This isn't the purse I dropped.
Well, the initials on the necklace that Catherine found were A.F.D. 
Apparently one a little bit harder than the others.
You still like to dance?
I don't mean the way you used to, I ...
I think I have a line on the victim's date. Now, four of the tickets that we pulled from her purse were charged to her credit card, but the Zumanity ticket was purchased with a different card, one belonging to a gentleman named Arnie ... Clifton.
He should have paid cash.
How'd you two meet?
Did you pay for it?
No, we're not done here. You got sand in your shoes.
So do you think Grissom will show?
You got to dance.
Come on, let's go. My God.
I think I know her.
I'm surprised anyone picked out a gas leak through the rest of the stench around here.
Whoa.
Head in the oven ... It's kind of a classic, huh?
She's definitely got gray hair.
It's just a guess, but I'd say she's in rigor.
Yep.
I've got a substance on her ... right ear. She doesn't really look like the hair gel type.
Hang on a second, fellas. Look at that.
Her dentures ... they were in upside down.
Okay, Hodges. What do you got?
Which is?
Just tell me what it is, Hodges.
Lime Jell-O?
Oh, boy. Looks like somebody cleaned up in a hurry. More green Jell-O.
I got blood, too.
It's possible. But why get rid of this body and leave the old lady?
Did Finch have a history of violence?
Catherine, we tried three years ago. There were no other female-related crimes in the Vegas metro area that week.
Yes, and as I recall, we put out a broadcast covering cities statewide.
Needle in a haystack.
You all right?
Sabbatical's usually a euphemism for sayonara. I don't think Grissom's coming back.
I don't know. He shaved his beard, he's lost a little weight, he's been leaving when shift is over. I think he even took a day off last week.
That's what I'm saying. You know, I thought you were going to leave a few months ago.
No, I mean, I ... you don't really have to work anymore if you don't want to, right?
Well ... Sam, with your dad ... the whole thing.
No. 
Nick Stokes. Nice to meet you.
Why don't you ... run us through it, Sheriff?
No bodies?
Did you identify who the blood belonged to?
Any idea on the mode of death?
You know, there are quite a few nicks in the pavement down here.
Then this would have been the trajectory of the bullet. Now, there's what appears to be a ricochet mark headed in the right direction.
Wait a minute.
Oh, yeah. I think we're in business, ladies.
.25 caliber.
Finch could've used a different gun, but chances are, yeah, they're unrelated.
How'd he kill them?
So the son was home?
So Guffey knew the victims?
Did you recover a handgun?
You thinking what I'm thinking?
So, nothing inside's been touched in three years?
Screen door's ripped.
The killer finishes Mary off and hunts Heather down.
Whose blood on the door handle?
I think whoever did this might have seen Danny's toys in the backyard, thought the job wasn't done yet ... and went outside to finish it.
He shot the rabbits.
If all these bullets were shot from the same .38, six would kick it. Three murders, one gun, one killer.
Well, these bullets should answer that question.
Good. Good, if it matches Guffey's gun, he stays in prison, but if it doesn't, we've got no gun to tie to Finch.
What are you gonna do?
He's not gonna talk to you, Catherine.
Hey.
Not back yet. I got a ride here with a local deputy.
Oh, yeah. Listen, about that ... I told my folks when I went to college I'd be back, you know? Go to work at the D.A.'s office with my dad. You can kinda see how that turned out. Anyway, I just wanted to say it's been great, man. 
Really, I've learned a lot from you, man.
Yes, sir.
Hey, Catherine, I tested the rabbit bullet to Guffey's gun. No match.
But, but it did match the stria to the bullet that killed Addie Finch.
Yes, ma'am, it does.
Okay, okay. And hey, one more thing. Tell the sheriff that I ran the bullet from her abduction case through IBIS and there was no hit as well. Sorry.
Mr. Novak.
Out. How can I help you?
Concern for his safety?
With all due respect, Mr. Novak, no laws have been broken here.
No, but you can for a different crime.
Personal to who? 
You know, Catherine and I get along just great. Maybe it's you.
Duly noted.
Hey, Catherine. Wendy found two DNA markers from the bloody fingerprint on the cookie jar. Related females -- Heather and Mary.
Also a match.
Yeah, looks like everything's still in the exact same place. 
Well, we searched everywhere the first time. He ditched the gun.
Now I think I know why Finch stopped by the Curtis farm. He'd been driving for days. He was exhausted, disoriented. He thought he was home. 
And all Finch saw was his mom.
Sounds like shoddy police work.
Well, there was a follow-up in spades on Jane Doe '89. She was found in a vacant lot off 28th Street near Boulder Highway. Uh, stripped of her clothing. Like the others, several peri-mortem bruises, but check out this hair.
Killer didn't wash that one down.
Again, the cops didn't come up with a single suspect. There were detailed sketches of the crime scene, microscopy on errant hairs and fibers, even ran the vic's prints through WIN.
The guy that worked on this case was very thorough. He just didn't close it.
Or maybe the first one found.
Junkies do bruise easily.
Pretty but not pricey. 
'89 Jane Doe, this was your case.
You processed a mountain of evidence but didn't turn up a single suspect.
What are you talking about? There's nothing here to indicate that you ...
You did note morphology consistent with the vic.
This hair had a tag. Did you run DNA?
There's your money shot.
Did you preserve the hair?
Sir, I spent half the day at Central Property going through their records. Now, according to the case logs, it was transferred to this court in late 1989 and never returned. So, it's got to be here somewhere, okay?
Excuse me, bro.
Yeah, I think I need a hand here, Hodges.
It's from an '89 Jane Doe. I'm looking for anything that will help us out.
That's because they are rat droppings, man.
Hodges ... glove up.
In the original photograph, it would've looked like a severe bruise. But there's a lot of information in the negative. You know, back in the day, they didn't have the capability to see this stuff.
Yeah. And here, there's a small gap between the two front teeth. Did Dr. Dave have a space between his teeth?
Looks like some sort of foam.
Stolen motor vehicles? You got to be kidding me.
Can't you slide it to days?
Okay.
Giddyup.
I'm CSI Stokes, this is Brown.
We're from the Crime Lab, dude.
Wh-What if, what if I promise to come back and give it to you later?
You want to shoot our way in?
Sir, don't make us call your supervisor. Now, come on. 
This is so lame. How much do you want to bet half the prints come back to the cops who recovered these bikes. They never wear gloves.
Boy, she has got it in for me today.
What are you doing with the cup from my Zamesca scene?
They found the same kind of cup at their scene?
Hey, Doc.
Want you to catch me up with Catherine and Warrick.
Where's the body from their 420?
Who's this?
She involved with Catherine's 420?
Will you send me a photo of this tattoo? And when the body comes in at the mortuary, will you give me a call?
You guys seen Catherine around? She's not answering her cell phone.
Anything from your scene link back to Zamesca?
Because I think your DB's the unidentified woman in the photo I found.
And, excuse me, we found this same type of material at the Zamesca scene. If we can match it back to this car ... you could place the car at the scene. And Simon behind the wheel.
I just connected Sara's vic to Simon.
Yeah, you might want to hear this.
Well, I think, that Simon was driving her BMW to meet Zamesca.
I can't find the evidence in the Holstein case.
Because that guy who confessed to killing Zamesca didn't do it. Sheriff's jumping the gun.
Is there a reason you don't want me to see that file, Catherine?
'Cause Catherine and Keppler are in there.
No, and this isn't about Keppler being IA anyway. This is about Catherine having a false confession and standing by it.
Zamesca knew Sara's and Greg's vic. He's dead, she's dead, same drugs are found at both scenes, and then ... those same drugs showed up at your crime scene?
I can't find the Holstein evidence.
Yeah. Why didn't she put it where it belongs?
Well, it's kind of hard to have an autopsy when you don't have a body, man. I talked to Doc Robbins; he's still trying to track it down. And the mortuary has no record of Catherine's phone call whatsoever.
All right, that's it. We're a team now, the four of us. We can't trust Catherine and we can't trust Keppler. I'm serious. I'm gonna run with this one.
Try to stop me and I'll have you put in jail.
Hey, Warrick, it's Nick. When is the last time you found high-velocity exit spatter with no brain and no bone?
Got the evidence yet?
There's a pool now?
Who's number two?
Number three?
How's it going in here?
Spark plug?
Crooks. And cops. And, hey, get this. The blood found in Holstein's car had high levels of EDTA. Anti-coagulant.
That means this crime scene was staged.
Yeah, if this is all IA BS, then why would they play it out in the press?
We trust you with our lives, Catherine. You could have trusted us with this.
What hasn't been cleaned?
If Simon was hiding out here for a couple of weeks, he had to eat, sleep and use the bathroom. So, what did the cleaners miss?
We'd have to get a court order to compel a DNA sample from Simon. That takes time. Brass can only stall this guy's release for a couple hours, you know.
Sara.
Nah. No, I'm, I'm tired. I'm going home.
The vic is Ross Neddy. Ex-con. Spent a couple years in Jean for domestic assault. Just got paroled.
Shop foreman says he's only been working here a few days.
He is a crispy critter. I'd say the point of origin was him.
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, he's all yours, Super Dave.
Ex-con.
Enemies on the outside ... two points of origin ... maybe we're looking at a little payback. 
What do you think, Keppler?
Hey ... you know what Grissom would say here, don't you?
Looks like the long bones are gone ... ditto for the spine ... tendons and cartilage ... most major veins ... phew.
So the crispy critter isn't Ross Neddy?
Let me get this straight. The ex-con digs up a corpse, scoops out a few body parts to sell, then fills it back up with PVC and umbrellas, then torches the body where he works to make it look like he's the victim?
But if this Lapinsky guy was already dead, then how come the doc didn't find traces of embalming fluid?
So what?
So, this isn't just about desecration of the body, but of the family as well.
I'll get a court order for the exhumation.
The coffin had only been in the ground for about a week. Dirt and sod were pretty loose, so it was relatively easy to take out and put back in.
As many as we have to.
No surprise.
Dead men don't wear plaid.  Wait a minute. Is this blood?
Hey, thought you had a deposition.
That's the same logo you found on the umbrella that was in Lapinsky's leg.
This is a criminal investigation. Those parts are evidence now.
You know, I was always under the impression that the body parts were to be removed at the hospital.
And?
It turns out, Ty Miloni ... is a bit of a hustler as well.
Those umbrellas were a promotional gift for a vitamin telemarketing company he ran a few years back. 
He did drop out of chiropractic school.
Well, if you're FDA registered, yeah.
You just fill out a form. In the last three years, 37 of the bone and tissue donors were from Silver Hills Mortuary that went to this Longevity clinic.
COD in 23 of those cases was cardiac arrest. And most of those decedents were in their thirties and forties.
And do more exhumations.
Maybe that's 'cause they're not around anymore. We followed up on several patients who received Silver Hills bone and tissue from your clinic and now seven of them are dead. Three from hepatitis, three from cancer, and one AIDS-related. The same thing ironically killed the donors.
You're reopening a very nasty, old wound for them, now.
Ty ... let me tell you something. I'm gonna come down to that clinic ... and I'm going to go through it piece by piece by piece. And if something doesn't jibe, I can assure you, sir, I will find it.
Yes, it is.
Hey.
Aren't you off shift?
Yeah. Yeah, thanks. I'll be back in a minute.
Looks like it's you and me again, Hoss.
No, no, I like your style. It's just the whole suit thing you got to work on a little bit.
Two gunshot victims. Male, two shots in the chest. Female shot in the back, and her hand is missing.
Why take just one hand?
No, no, I did not.
.45 automatic.
No.
No, no safe in here.
Hey, this guy has a bunch of law enforcement logo shirts hanging up in here. Check the bible drawer.
Anything?
Nine-millimeter service pistol? 
Stamped T.P.D. Could be any city starting with T.
Hey, Catherine, check this out. I've got an uncapped bottle of mouthwash here.
Yeah, but I've got something else, and this is good.
There are quite a few long, light-colored hairs snagged in the soap dish right there. Not a match to either victim.
I doubt the maid would miss this. What appears to be high heel shoe impressions -- I checked, again, no match to the working girl.
Hey, Keppler. Do me a favor. Go over by the body, will you?
I can see you; can you see me?
What about if I get low?
Or an eyewitness tried to hide from a killer.
Implants. Kind of big for my taste, really.
Oh, they're for the butt?
You know, I spent twelve hours on a court bench last week. I could have used a pair of these bad boys.
Okay, so I'll run the serials?
I am an ass man.
You okay?
Well, I tracked down the plastic surgeon that augmented Courtney Evans' glutes. Probably the only implants ever paid for in cash by, get this ... her pimp, a guy named Eric Hong, aka ...
Is she one of yours?
You bought her butt cheek implants. Is that something you normally do for girls you don't know?
Okay. So, then she is one of yours, right?
I'm sure it is. So what did she do, Precious? She make you mad?
Nothing? Like cut off her hand, and you kill the cop she was with?
She had a baby? Damn.
Yeah.
Ma'am, I'm Nick Stokes; this is Mike Keppler. We're with the Crime Lab. You mind if we ask you a few questions?
What about the father?
Go with her.
Oh. Looks like we have another victim, huh?
It's gonna be okay, baby.
Keppler. Archie found the mystery blonde. Before she was in Dennis Graves' room, she was with that cop, Frank McCarty.
They got on in the lobby, got off on 11—around the time McCarty said Dennis picked up his hooker. Hey, he never mentioned he had company, and he knew we were looking for another hooker. Now I'm starting to think we're looking at a dirty cop.
PD's about to. I'm calling them right now.
Same caliber as the gun that killed the cop and the hooker.
This-this is practically gift-wrapped. If the guy wants to get caught so bad, just confess, make it easy on all of us. I can't wait to get this back to Ballistics. I'll see you.
Doesn't make any sense.
No, no way. I was right there. Besides, the blood was already dry. You don't leave fingerprints in dried blood. I compared the .45 ammo evidence to the dead cop and the hooker. It's the correct make, model and caliber, but I'm telling you, it's a different gun.
We should be talking to Keppler about this. 
He knows where the eyewitness lives.
I'm saying that if he had something to do with these two murders, then Frank McCarty's not the only one we need to worry about.
He brought back the three bullets from Autopsy, which didn't match the gun with his prints on it.
Anything's possible.
Keppler and McCarty were both Jersey boys. Expand the search to the East Coast.
Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait! I got something.
Check under the nails. You'll find Frank McCarty's DNA.
Remember the Blue Paint killers? Maybe Ernie Dell had a partner. Like an apprentice, an accomplice, something like that.
Tanks and airplanes.
Other people had access to those files. Maybe it was a cop. Or somebody in the lab. It's been known to happen.
Now, even if we find a match, we could already be too late.
C'mon. C'mon.
Nick Stokes, LVPD. We're looking for a woman that lives in this building. She looks like this.  Have you ever seen her?
Yeah, well, it's actually a death threat. Time is of the essence here. Can you help us out? Anyone in the building look like this? No?
Ms. Tallman? Las Vegas Police. You need to open your door, please.
Ms. Tallman?
Please, ma'am, calm down. We're with the Crime Lab.
No, we're not confused. We're here for your protection.
Doctor, do you normally take a nap around the same time every day covering your face and eyes with the pillow?
No, ma'am. No, not anymore. This officer will help you get your things, okay?
She may have already been poisoned.
We should collect blood for tox.
Hey, get out of there!  The killer did plan every detail.
We ran tox on Ms. Tallman's blood as well as her milk and cookies. She was negative on everything from pharmaceuticals and illicits, to herbicides, pesticides and heavy metals. You sure she was going to be poisoned?
Well, it'd be kind of rude not to greet him, don't you think?
The timer goes off, activating the motor, which closes the flue and drops powdered charcoal onto the flames, producing carbon monoxide. 
Fumes have nowhere to go but out into the apartment, into Officer Kamen.
And the cat.
You know, this timer was geared to run for weeks. It could have easily been put in place a month ago.
Not entirely. There's some kind of liquid. It looks like it fell and splashes on the floor ... and the body ... and it looks like ... the ear.
Forty may be the new twenty, but 16's the new 30, between cars and cell phones and the Internet.
Hey.
Yeah?
A little blood in the parking lot, a lot of blood here. But very little in between?
Hey. Look at that equipment shed door.
What's that? A letter jacket?
Well, I never accused you of not being smart. Greg, you're a little weird, but ... a hearse?
So what's with the ropes, Casanova?
What about the busted door?
Stokes. Oh, hey, Wendy. Really? Yeah, thanks.
How does your theory account for the fact that all the blood's Ryan's?
Okay. Let's say I'm a Lovers Lane rapist. I stalk them. I want me a high school cheerleader. What's the first thing I do?
Why take Ryan's body?
People ... let's spiral out.
This road has almost no traffic at night. Take a look at this.
Start out heavy, and then they fade out as the vehicle gains momentum.
They're in a direct line with the accident debris. That tells me it's probably related to the impact. If Megan was hit by a car, hard enough to knock her out of her own shoes, I doubt she just walked away from this.
I had a friend once that got hit by this big-ass van. Knocked him like two hundred feet in the air.
Yeah?
Yeah! Yeah, I got her.
Barely.
Excuse me. I'm Nick Stokes with the Crime Lab.
You're very welcome. I left your mom a message. I wanted to ask you a few questions. You mind if I ...  steal him for a minute?
I understand you and Megan were pretty close, huh?
You wait that whole time? Don't cheerleaders work out for, like, hours?
Oh.  Oh, okay.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I get it. Did you wait for her after the ballgame the other night?
Hey, Charlie, since you guys are so close you'd know if somebody had it in for her, wouldn't you?
How rude?
Megan, listen, I know you've already been through a lot, but you may be the only one that can tell us what happened to Ryan.
We don't know. Let's start with the last thing you remember.
What's a hurkey?
Do you remember anything after the game? Anything?
What am I looking at here, Arch?
Some dude named Charlie.
You can grab a cup of coffee.
I know you've waived your right to counsel. I appreciate you coming in here and talking to me, Charlie. That means you're ready to be honest. That's, that's good. Because Ryan is still missing, Sheila is now dead, Megan is partially paralyzed, and you are digging yourself into a pretty deep hole here, pal.
I know you were there that night in the equipment shed. I have your shoe impressions at the scene; I've got you on film; and we found Sheila's cue cards in the back of her mom's trunk. So ... Where's Ryan?
You're an adult, Charlie. There's a big difference between going to juvie and going to state prison. Big difference. Okay, I'll tell you what I think happened.
You're in love with Megan, who's in love with Ryan, who's a dog. You said so yourself. And he gives her crabs. But does she break up with him? No. She goes right back to him after crying on your shoulder. Man, that'd piss me off. Don't make me present to a jury that you came up with this plan, this little prank, and recruited Sheila -- equally afflicted by this -- and you ran that boy's head against a tackling sled. Then when Megan freaked out and got scared, you just ran her over and left her for dead.
Then you tell me what happened!
What happened?
What did you do with the body?
Where is Ryan?
What about Megan?
Okay, come here and take a look at this.
Sheila's holding the camera; you're holding the cue cards. Who's holding the light? Was there somebody else there?
Hmm? 
Are you sure?
How you feeling?
Oh, no, no, I'm ... I'm good. I just wanted to show you something.
What do you think about that?
Oh, it looks like you're killing your boyfriend. You tell me. 
Ms. Kentner.
Oh, so, you do remember?
I wish I could get selective amnesia. There's a lot in my past I'd like to forget about.
Looks like he was about a size 11.
I heard about what happened. You okay?
There's a custom-made label on a wine bottle over there.
Maybe he forced wine down her throat. Tox will tell us.
It was good that you were there for her, Sara. She didn't have to die alone.
So, Mr. Greyburg, you don't want a lawyer?
How did you get to know them?
Sara.
Killer shoes. There were multiple shoe impressions in blood at the house, looked just like those.
Prove it. We'll take your little ceramic knife, give us your shoes, and we'll take a sample of your DNA.
Any hits?
Whoo! Did you call for backup?
Feeling lucky?
Hey, Sara?
Got a knife over here.
Tip's broken off. That's probably going to be the murder weapon right there.
And it matches the one from the swag bag.
You sure that's really such a good idea?
I was able to make a physical match between the broken tip in Becca and the knife recovered from outside the bar.
We don't know yet. Sara's at the hospital now -- she's bringing back a DNA sample to compare.
Yeah. No ridge detail. Same smudges were found on the wine bottles and in the bedrooms.
Where'd Brass find it?
Smart.
Whoa. One, two ... three, four, five, six.. . ladies' handbags.
Rebecca Mayford. Becca.
Mm. Looks like she was trying to quit smoking.
And failing. Miserably.
There is only one missing.
Here we go. Bought at the Trip Wire Bar at 12:48 a.m. same night as the murders.
Looks real to me. Imagine if you're petrified.
Drops. Told you I'd see you later.  It's called criminal activity. Stand up and hold your hands up for me, please.
The only thing we have in common, Kellen, are the dead bodies that seem to keep piling up around you.  Turn around, please.
Well, you keep heading down this road and, unfortunately, that's where you're going to end up.
It's a test for gunshot residue. Hands up.
Maybe not. Okay, now, I need you to remove all of your clothing, including your shoes.
You can put these on for now and I'll come back to get them when you're done.
You are covered in blood. Your clothes are evidence now and I'm going to come back in here and I'm going to get them. If not, you're just going to be standing here in your underwear.
This is not a compromise, Kellen.
You might want to close your eyes or turn around or something.
Gentlemen. Follow me.
There were two shots fired through the glass, but as you can see, different sizes, different calibers.
Yeah, but check out the beveling on the impacts.
Well, I analyzed the radial cracks from both holes. The cracks from the shot that was fired out was terminated by the cracks from the shot that was fired in.
It's got to be about the girl. Her DNA matched the unknown female contribution on the hundred dollar bill, so, she was in the limo.
No, but it proves she was with Aaron at some point in the night.
Because of Drops. He knows everybody in the club scene, especially the party girls. He could have picked her up anywhere.
Yeah. Yeah. And somewhere in between, Simone just gets ... tossed.
Yeah. Any trace of blood?
Great. What about the, uh, the hoodie in that cell phone picture? It looked like Aaron was wearing one.
Looks like the little hood left us something.
I'm going to need to photograph your hands.
Blood evidence, yeah, and defensive wounds. I'm also going to get a sample of your DNA and your fingerprints. So, why don't you hand little Nora to her mom for right now, okay?
Why don't you ... where is your shirt?
Mmm.
Yeah, do you think anyone else had the ... the gate code?
Are you accusing your son of killing your husband?
Oh.
How you doing man?
By who?
You don't live here full time?
We fingerprinted everyone in the house, DNA samples as well.
Nothing but partials.
I ran the VIN number on the cougar that hit you. A place sold it yesterday for cash. Catherine, I'm really sorry for leaving you there.
Okay.
Think I got something.
Mandy ran the print that I picked up from your car, and it's a match to an open burglary case, from a few months ago. I think this was yours, Warrick.
What the hell's an erotic athlete?
Nice.
Oh, no, it's-it's lube ... I think. Yeah, these bikinis are from the erotic athletes at Lolita's bar. This woman, Lucy Pavorotti, broke her neck flipping around up there. Well, now she's suing everybody.
Nothing?
Nothing at all? I'm all ready for Luscious Lucy likey Lolita's lubey.
Good point. Hey, I've been meaning to ask you about something you might be interested in. The Forensic Academy has their conference in June.
-- and I'm going to be speaking on fieldwork. But the thing about it is, man, I'm just no good when it comes to IR trace technology. 
But now you ... you are.
So ... what do you think? It's in Iowa. Which is ... as fun as you want to make it, but ...
Ugh. Me either. This chair has taken quite a beating, and this cigarette looks like it was just left here and burned out. Hand me an evidence marker, will you?
There is a stain on the filter. Could be blood, could be lipstick. If this fellow was shot through the throat, and had a nasty lump on the head, -- 
-- could be how he ended up face down in the pool.
Back-splash could have washed it away when he hit the water.
Well, it sounds like we need to play ... Find the Bullet.
Are the girls allowed to keep any weapons in the room for self-defense?
Then you won't mind if I check for myself, right?
As long as it takes.
Hey. Catherine said we might not be looking for a bullet anymore.
Not a bullet.
Mm-hmm.
No, sir.
There is what appears to be blood on the shaft.
Sir. That's, that's really sweet.
Yeah.
Hey, Sara. Found another arrow shot in the ground near that old toolshed.
Well, to work in a brothel you're required to register your fingerprints, so ...
Okay. I'll let you know if we get lucky.
Mr. Foster, we're going to need to talk to you down at the police station. Okay?
Well, that gets Dreama and Connor for attempted murder with conspiracy to commit.
Babinkian knew about that shellfish allergy -- that's intent, right?
That's assault with a deadly weapon.
So the field tracheotomy buys un-Happy enough time to get the epi.
You do know what a good defense attorney is going to say to all this, don't you?
The lawn chair did it.
Which, in his case, was today. Bomb squad find any booby traps?
Any sign of Chyna De Vere?
Come on, pretty girl, come on.
Come on.
Hey.
Well, I read about this farmer in Canada who killed a bunch of women and fed them to his pigs.
Yeah, their health department had to put out a bulletin that said, Warning: your pork may be contaminated with human.
Get through there!
Well, no one has seen or heard from the victim's husband, so ... I kind of figured he may have been dessert.
They always do.
Oh, boy.
The femur measures 461 millimeters.  Gives us a height for a white female of 5'6.
5'7.
No, sir, I was just about to. 
41 point s ... point five millimeters.
You want my theory?
This little piggy went to market. This little piggy stayed home. This little piggy had Chyna.
And it is consistent with Connors chopping off her head and tossing his
Yeah?
Man, that looks human.
To Preston, Love, Chyna.
You're supposed to let me get these things on.
Oh, I don't know. I don't think it's a good idea to date somebody you work with. You never really get away from work or them the way you need to, you know?
Yeah, exactly, honey.
Yeah, it looks like the bullet that killed her came from Connors' Walther PPK.
Any witnesses?
Thanks.
That's a pretty nasty head wound. Where's Super Dave?
No. Gentlemen don't get hit in the head with those.
Maybe it's not her purse.
Aw, man, that's a shame. Look at her. She could be anything she wanted to be. Makes you wonder what happens to people.
Sometimes I miss the days when I didn't take this job so personally, Warrick.
No, thanks.  I'm only going to be about another ten minutes here, okay?
Hey. You all right? 
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Not the street. Not the street.
I got you. 
Hey.
No, no. Some drunk driver ran into a radio car at my crime scene. Friggin' idiot.
Nothing was on fire. I didn't pull anybody from anywhere.
Run these against the paint chips from the body, please.
So the victim was hit by a car.
Well, the car that hit her was yellow and black.
No.
Excuse me?
Well, I'm sure you are, but, uh, no, ma'am, we're not dancers. We're here about the warrant.
Hey, we just take them apart. We don't put them back together, now.
Front bumper screens positive for blood.
This isn't a robbery, sir.
Do you know the guy that drives this cab?
Thanks for the info, fellas.
You sure you've never seen her before?
You don't remember her at all?
That picture was taken by the camera inside your cab. Why don't you take another look?
Recognize her now?
Hey. Dru. I was born at night, but not last night, okay? I know you picked her up at the steakhouse. I know the last time she was seen alive was in your yellow cab. I know she was killed by a yellow car. I found blood on your front bumper.
Where'd you let her out?
Mr. Kambhatla, if I match the paint from your cab to the paint we found in her skull, do you realize how much trouble you're in?  'Cause I'm not sure you really do. Scotty.
I recognize the graffiti on that bench. That's the street we found her on, right there.
Go back, show me the last three photos, Archie.
Well, he's pissed. So she did snatch his wallet after all.
Yeah. Thanks, Arch.
Sofia, Faith Maroney's prints were found on the cab driver's wallet so there's your motive. No problem.
The paint from the dead girl's skull matched the paint on Chandru's cab.
The paint chips from the street are not a match to the paint chips from her skull. Are you sure about this?
Then what color were the other paint chips?
Oh.
That's a lot of canary yellow and engine black. Cab-on-cab hate?
What about the other half?
Sweet. I'm glad I figured that out.
Well, it looks like Friendly bought a small fleet of white cabs from another company last year that went belly-up.
Seventy-five.
Hey, Warrick. I got what looks like fresh damage over here.
Do we know that guy?
Freeze that and grab a number off that cab.
If Dru was dispatched, then what was Gus doing at that steakhouse?
Looks like Gus took the fight to the streets. He hit him again right there.
And we know from the paint chips we found on the ground that Gus's cab collided with Dru's on that street.
It's physics. Gus's cab transferred most of its energy into Dru's -- more than enough to launch him into the girl. Car bumpers are designed to absorb the impact from another vehicle, but the bumper hitting her? Would have been like a ... elephant hitting a flea.
It's a bad neighborhood. Nothing's open out there. So why'd you drop her off?
So why didn't you just report the accident?
Hey, you were stopped and Gus hit you, pushing your cab into her. Now, that's not your fault. Okay?
Yeah, well, Gus doesn't know the law, but I do. What else did he say to you? Mr. Kambhatla, this may be the last chance you have to tell me the truth, now.
Okay. Okay. What kind of deal?
No, sir, unfortunately, that's not the way it works. I've got you for obstruction, for fleeing the scene, and now you're an accessory. I'm sorry, man. I know you're confused, but ... you just made a deal with the wrong guy.
According to the doc, COD was cerebral hemorrhage due to multiple blunt force trauma.
No luck with that print?
So that's why you built this thing? I mean ... other than to creep us all out?
The Miniature Killer's a woman?
Well, female cuts the list down a little bit.
Unless the female killer was an Amazon, I kind of doubt a guy like this was just ... beat around his own bathroom.
In the Penny Garden case, the victim was ...poisoned, then died falling out a window after going into convulsions.
In the Barbara Tallman case, the method of murder was gassing but was disguised by potential poisoning and suffocation.
Well ... take a look at this. That little round spot ... is that discoloration consistent with decomp?
Any idea what it is?
He was electrocuted?! From what?
All the outlets in the bathroom are dead.
We're hot.
Possible burn mark on the tile. If this is where Trevor's foot grounded out, he must've been at the sink when he got zapped.
Hot wire's touching one of the metal brackets that's holding up the sink.
You can see where it's been rigged. Whoever tapped into this power line must've gained access from the apartment on the other side of this wall.
Generic stretch of desert. She could be anywhere in a four-state radius.
I think I got a VIN number.
King-Sam-Victor-four-five-three.
So, she salvages the car, and somehow gets it out to the desert, and then grabs Sara, and puts her under it?
Damn. You're lucky -- I don't even see any skid marks.
Hey, Linda ...
You didn't touch the outside of that door handle, did you?
You did good. This might take a while, if you want to take a little break or something. Thanks.
Hey, Doc. What brings you out?
Dig in.
Huh?
This could explain the blood.
Sofia ...
You might want to put out a broadcast on Mr. Caris and his vehicle.  Possible stabbing suspect.
He's not smart.
Was he alone?
Would you recognize this guy if you saw him again?
Is that him right there?
That's what I'm gonna find out for you. Why don't you go with this officer right now. She'll take care of you, all right? I'll do my best to keep you informed, ma'am, I promise.
Yeah, there's some-some ... oil and grease around the pump. I'll check the tire and ... shoe impressions.
I'm telling you, no place is safe anymore.
What about the crash-test dummy here?
You don't get that from an auto accident, do you?
Okay, good. So ... COD?
His skull separated from his spine.
Should've been wearing a seat belt.
And why does he pick the biggest guy at the station?
Rewind it back to this fool getting out of the Buick.
He seems disoriented, shaky ... high on something.
THC? That's it?
No, I was kind of thinking there was something else in there. You should've seen this guy -- he was acting really ... sketched out.
PCP?
Embalming fluid is the street name for PCP.
So this guy was smoking wet.
So, now, what do I tell Sergeant Day's widow? A retired Marine who served two tours in Iraq. That-that all this is about getting higher?
I'm sorry.
Hi.
Yep.
But she shouldn't have been walking around here, Warrick. Couldn't pick a shadier part of town, man.
Then they mosey through the naked city with their thousand dollar cameras.
Next thing you know, we're taking their picture.
Looks like someone's on a little crime spree.
Excuse me?
There's about to be an ass-whupping on this block.
That's right.
I'm sick of these punks, man. I'm serious, I'm sick of it.
Maybe.
Hey, Catherine. I think I'm on to something. Check this out.
Now, y'all is plural. Believe me, I used the word a lot, so I have a feeling he sent that to more than one person.
Hmm, we got this punk's phone number. All we have to do is subpoena his phone records. We'll get every one he sent the message to. We'll text him, we'll tell him to meet us somewhere.
No, from Pig's phone.
Don't need it. When you text from a computer, you put in the number that you're calling from. We'll just use Mister Piggy's.
Let me in there.
No, I'd like to see Greg. I'm definitely in, yeah.
Hanging out with the wrong crowd in the wrong town. I'm telling you ... 
... a fake ID in Las Vegas is like having a free ticket on the hell train. s*x, drugs, gambling, no adult supervision, 24/7. 
By the time they're 21, they've done and seen it all.
Yeah, that was pre-Mirage, back when you were a little squirt going to the casino playing the arcade games.
No, Vegas is a different animal now.
Yeah, a good slap.
You know if you think about it, this is one of the oldest ways to kill somebody.
Well, the two-by-four is tied to the scaffold with a single loop. There is an empty pulley up here. We could lower her down with that.
First things first. We'll use our rope; I'll run it through this pulley, and then let you take the weight. I'll mark the rope, cut the knot; down she goes.
Ready?
You take the weight. I'll cut it on three.
One, two, three.
Got it?
Yeah, either that or highly motivated. You know how it is once somebody's adrenaline gets pumping. Feel like they can do anything.
All right, that's it.
Hey.
Hey! Hey, I found it. Rope, nails, hammers, everything.
Oh, yeah.
The killer used materials from the church: the rope, the 2x4s, and one of these hammers. I just haven't found it yet. But all this was in the same utility closet.
Hmm-mm.
Inside job.
Father Frank.
The blood on the hammer is a match to the blood found on the father's clothes, but none of it is from Charlotte.
I think Sister Bridget found the bloody hammer and confessed to the murder because she thought Father Frank was guilty.
Maybe he's the unwilling father of her unborn child.
She looks thrilled.
Upon initial search of the premises, farmer located one adult male unconscious on the living room floor. His name's Carl Fisher. Paramedics have him on the bumper now. Once he came around, he started claiming every time there's an Amber Alert, somebody tries to kill him.
Tier Two, by his own admission.
Hey.
And let me guess. Nobody saw or heard anything, right?
Right.
Based on the burn pattern, the origin of the fire was definitely here. I detected an accelerant on the front of the car, and on the ground, both consistent with gasoline. Now, the back seat's still intact, so I figure the fire jumped from the car to the house and fast.
Check this out.
Someone stepped in the accelerant before the car was lit.
Could've been anybody.
Yeah, if he's got those kids stashed somewhere, he could try to take them out of state.
I wish I had more. The burned shoe impression was a size 11. Carl Fisher wears a size 11. But none of the patterns match up. And the shoes that Sara found near the sofa ... I can't even identify a brand.
Sorry.
Yeah, there's some minor bruising on the knuckles of his right hand. Probably a defensive wound.
Catherine found some brown fabric on a fence nearby. I bet it's from these shorts.
Hey, super, you didn't leave this shirt inside out when you took it off the body, did you?
Yeah. Yeah, it could.  Okay ... Well, SAE kit should tell us whether or not he was molested.
Yeah, me, too, buddy. Me, too.
Are those palm prints on his sternum?
Now, what kind of a killer performs CPR on their victim?
Catherine found blood smear on the floor where he was playing. He has a laceration on his cheek. And the grandpa admits he pushed Lucas down when he hit his head.
His blood alcohol -- point one six.
And Sara found a whiskey cap in Carl Fisher's car.
Yeah, well, listen to this. According to the report, Lucas also had 98 micrograms per milliliter of salicylates in his system.
Wonder who gave him that.
These glass fragments are from the mob breaking out the windows of CSI Sanders' Denali.
That's how they dragged him out.
This is a clump of his hair, torn from his scalp. And that's the rock Demetrius James used as a weapon.
I'd like to answer that question. Usually, when someone plants a weapon, whoever did it puts it right beside the body -- in this case, the rock was found near the front tire of the Denali. Skid marks suggest it was dropped upon impact.
No. More like one man against an extremely violent, out-of-control mob.
It has always been department policy not to harm innocent civilians. You call for backup, you try to be a good witness, and you stay out of the way.
Well, when those people are wearing masks, running around beating people up.
One victim was dead. Another was seriously injured. Another fatality imminent. I'd say the use of deadly force in this case was consistent with department policy, absolutely.
Hey.
I don't know.
Yeah.
Well, that's not the question. What a jury wants to know is did Greg do what any reasonable person would have done under the circumstances.
What can we do to help him?
Yeah, according to the acceleration skid marks, the front end went from there to there with D.J. coming at him.
Yeah.
Ready.
With this kid running at him the whole time, there's no way Greg could have avoided hitting him.
Bad day when you can't even run a simple errand.
Mr. Chen works here alone with his wife, and English is not their first language. I'm not even real sure that it's their second, but what I did gather is that the steam machines are very noisy, so neither one of them really heard anything. Mr. Chen found the body when he was closing up around 9:00. Said she's a regular customer.
Mugging?
Yeah, that's not real savvy, is it?
Yeah, that's gonna probably be the husband. Gary Home has called her six times in the last hour.
I'll check the trashcans for the complex, see if I can find her purse. Maybe they dumped what they couldn't liquidate.
Hey. I got your text. What's up?
Oh ...  Oh, Mandy / Oh, you came and you ... 
Oh, Mandy. 
Oh, that would make sense. The letter was signed Dora.
Hi.
Your twins.
Healthy enough to get back in touch with your daughters?
Is that why you wrote Amanda this letter saying, Please do not ever contact me again?
So ... you always go through your mom's mail?
Why's that?
Did Jill ever try to contact your mom?
So you met his wife, Amanda?
Hey, with you around ... sounds like she had pretty good reason.
So ... crazy chick keys the wife's car. Is it gateway violence that led to murder or just another coincidence like everything else in this case?
You what?
So they'd freeze up and can't get them open?
Over a girl?
So she definitely keyed the car, and may or may not have been doing the husband.
Israeli guns are really hard to find.
Okay. Okay, I certainly wouldn't put it past her, but what about the husband?
Nothing quite says I love you like, I killed your wife so we can be together.
A smoking gun.
Come on. You can't tell me we're back to square one on this deal.
Tiffany.
M. Myers. Here he is, Jim. Knucklehead left us his autograph.
Got trash?
Empties should give us DNA and fingerprints. Not that we really need them. Mr. Myers has already left us his photograph and signature.
Boy, you got to love it when a guy makes it easy for you.
Gentlemen ... blew up a clean copy of our hit list photo. Look at that.
Busboys, waiters, obviously at the Desert Inn.
It still begs the question: Why are those guys killing these guys?
The whole city's a desert. Could be anywhere. 
Warrick, take a look at this.
In those photos of Natalie observing Grissom and Sara at the crime scene, I never remember a sketchpad or a camera in her hand or anything like that.
Well, maybe she's eidetic. You know, a human camera. The eyes snap a photo, scan it to the brain.
All right, go ahead. I'm not leaving here till I find something.
Compassroute.com. Natalie's been spending a lot of time in the desert. About a dozen different spots, all off the beaten path. No roads, just general locations.
Done.
I was rescued.
She's not here.
All right, I'm going with her.
Wait, slow down, slow down, slow down.
Go that way.
Go.
Sara!
Sara, it's Nick. Can you hear me?
I can't get a pulse.
Don't worry, we're going to get you out of here, okay?
They're coming for you now.
Over here!
She's been in the sun all day, about fifteen hours. She's not answering me at all.
Yeah, this is definitely not the city dump.
Okay, Dave, let's see what we got.
Yeah, maybe. But I doubt they tied her up and beat her.
Check out the contusions, ligature marks.
Yup.  It looks like he's moving up the food chain.
Yeah, she got another call-out. We're a little bit shorthanded right now. What's up?
Confiscated during a drug raid at a gang house three months ago.
A member of the D Street Killers. Rodriguez Outreach Center is on D Street.
Maybe enough to want her dead.
Go see everyone's ID.
Lo siento pero esta prohibido.
I thought you said your dog's been gone for a couple months now.
Then why do you have a bowl of fresh water for him out in the shed?
And the leashes?
What about the treadmill?
Elizabeth Rodriguez.
Mr. Card, I'm going to have to ask you to step outside. We'll get your statement.
I don't know. But the pattern on these restraints is consistent to ligature marks on the victim.
Long red hairs. Hmm. I don't think these came from a dog.
Murder.
Mrs. Rodriguez. Do you have any idea what that contraption's used for in the back storage room there?
Mm-hmm. It says here you released the dog back to its owner, but Mr. Aquino claims he never got Hannibal back.
How many dogs you got here?
I'm gonna need to collect saliva samples from all of them.
Ooh, yeah, looks like he's been in a few fights.
Must get pretty tough working here, huh?
Hey, what's going to happen to all these dogs now?
And the people who turn them into killers, they just get away with a slap on the wrist, huh?
Well, it should be.
It looks like a like .25 caliber. That's friendly fire. Thanks, Doc.
No, no, no, it was a .25 caliber slug they pulled out of you. It means it was one of your boys.
Yeah, that's probably it.
Tell me about all the dead dogs I found down the Silverado Wash. Were you the one that tortured them? Made them fight? And when they died, were you the one that threw them out with the trash? Hmm? Was that you?
You know, there are two things a jury can't stand: people who abuse kids and people who abuse animals. So buena suerte.
Steve Card was the only one with access to the drugs and he admitted to cleaning up the crime scene.
And why would he give us all of Elizabeth's personal effects? You know, I'm starting to get the feeling the guy's not really all that smart.
Well, maybe Gino's telling the truth.
Means the killer could have used her key.
Hey. We ... uh ... we can't really talk to him yet. He's still waiting for his lawyer.
Hmm?
So you knew about this?
Okay.  Okay, so what's this guy's story?
So he's got a history of violence. You think he killed Mrs. Rodriguez?
Tommy, did you kill Elizabeth Rodriguez?
I, I could understand if you did. A whole lot of people that would say she had it coming.
I know, man. That's how they are. I always had dogs growing up. Did you?
No, but you really cared about those dogs at the kennel. Now, I know. I saw the way you treated them.
No. No, but you did.
Didn't you?
Oh ... something's still bugging me. If Mr. Rodriguez hadn't left the party, Elizabeth might still be alive.
I don't know, but he received a phone call from somebody that night that made him leave his wife.
Hey, witnesses at the party said that you received a phone call the night of the murder and then you just left. We know that phone call was from Tommy Halpert.
What'd you two talk about?
Speak to your wife about what?
So you just left her there, knowing that Tommy was going to come after her?
You let this happen. You did.
Okay, thanks.
Here's the point of impact.
Radiator fluid.
Hit-and-run. Hit back there ... ran over here.
Isn't that Grissom's dead cowboy?
Here's another card key from Pike's Gambling Hall right here.
Here you go.
Cody knew the girl he ran over.
Lucky for us, housekeeping's a little slow on the uptake.
Threw back a bunch of beers, some liquor. I don't see any drugs.
Bet it cost him. I ran her priors. She's got a couple for solicitation.
By the time you read this, I'll be married. He's a great guy. Honest, Cody, I'll always be thankful for everything you did for me. Love, Tiffany.
Mm-hmm.
Broken heart and he's a killer.
It's not Shakespeare.
Are you really?
Well, it sounds like Cody was trying to make sense out of his girl leaving him.
Yeah. Bullriding's an equipment-intensive sport.
They don't use those in professional bull riding.
Come up with a match?
That's okay. I'm good.
I wish I didn't.
Hey. I got prints from the truck, but half of them are Cody's.
I think he had a partner. There's a set of unknowns both on the truck and on the ... uh ... electro-love machine.
So who's the partner?
He lived on the family ranch. He was probably letting his folks know how he was doing in the finals.
What about her records?
Precious Ricky.
Yeah, he's a pimp, and he quit calling her after 2:00 AM, like he knew she was already dead.
Nobody's going to hit you, Rick.
This is about Tiffany Rigdon.
Did you beat her up?
Let me tell you something, man. You play around with me, I'm gonna throw your ass in jail. You feel me?
Good.  So she said she was leaving you, going to get married, right?
Oh, come on. At least admit I'm right about that.
Is that when you took her boyfriend's truck and ran her over?
It's a good plan, Rick – 
You get the boyfriend and a little revenge to boot. I mean, it's ...
Is that all you did: talk?
Where were you making all these phone calls from?
Mm-hmm, all right, all right, I'll check it out.
I didn't take you for a country music fan. Yee-ha.
Shotgun.
Would have been pretty loud, but everything is in a place like this.
Welcome to the Wild West.
And then, what, Troy came over to your chapel to set up the service?
And what time did he end up leaving?
Wedding chapel's only a couple blocks from the crime scene.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, on the way to her own wedding. I'll get a BOLO out on Troy's vehicle.
Hang on, Jim. Let me ... Let me talk to him real quick.
Yeah, yeah, okay.
Hey, Troy, when's the last time you got down to Big Bend? Huh? You-you got the plate frame. Man, I used to go to summer camp down there.
Hey, take it easy, Troy. Look, I got no weapon on me. Okay, I just want to talk to you for a second.
Yeah, I know. You came out to Vegas, and you got in over your head, but this is getting out of control. If you don't put that gun down, these cops are going to start shooting, and that could turn out very bad for both of us. You know what I mean?
Hey.
No, Troy, just wait. Hang on now. Listen to me. I know about Tiffany. I know why she stood you up at the wedding chapel.
Hey, man, look at me. Look at me.
I know she wanted to be there for you. Come on out of there, man. I'll tell you all about it. You don't want to do this.
Give me that. Come on, give me that thing. Give it to me.
It's going to be okay.
Missed you around here. Welcome back.
Killing Tiffany.
That means the rope found with Cody's body belonged to someone who's been around for a while.
Is Cash Dooley here?
Is that where you keep your clothes, the rest of your stuff?
I'd like to take a look in that cab.
That's part of the tradition, you know. Solitary man out there trying to find himself.
Nancy? I don't know about that. Tiffany's the one that broke his heart.
Oh. Yeah, her eyes were blue.
Then who did he write the poem for?
Thanks. Boy, I hope I'm not getting sick. I'm not finding any pour patterns on the exterior. The hood and the front quarter panels are down to the primer and the front tires are burnt down to the rim. Think the fire probably started in the engine compartment.
Now we'll have to get it back to the lab for a closer look.
No, no, I talked to the battalion chief about that. He said the driver's side was open when his boys showed up, and that the pressure from the hose probably closed it.
L-A-T. That's La Tijera's tag.
I wouldn't know. 
Yeah.
Okay ... uh ... there was no blood trail at the scene. Fire pretty much took care of that. And I doubt you're gonna find any trace of blood in that burnt-up driver seat.
Be my guest.
Eliminates the first scenario.
I don't know. Greg, I think we would have found evidence of somebody else inside the vehicle.
I think I just found my reason for getting out of bed this morning.
Check it out. The same guy that tampered with the car could have followed. Made sure the job was done.
Oh.
Hey.
I feel beat up.
No, no, I'm cool. I can push through it. 
Yeah, okay. I processed the driver's side. I was about to get to the passenger's side glove box.  I owe you one, man.
What?
You mean the GCMS caught it?
Maybe you should go work in China.
La Tijera is responsible for all three crimes. Tags at both scenes, and Gomez is an admitted member of the gang. According to Hodges, the tagger didn't use spray paint. He used an oil-based specialty paint.
Here you go.
What?
Yeah, those ... uh ... those do look like brush strokes. 
I assumed the tags were authentic. We've been looking in the wrong direction.
Where was your son-in-law's car parked that night?
Those are nice. Did you make those?
You keep the garage door closed when you're not working?
Anything ever gone missing?
Mind if I take this crate?
Fingerprints.
That's why I'm going to get yours, too, sir. So I can exclude you. Follow me.
Ma'am, I'm going to need to get your fingerprints, too.
I found your fingerprints on a stencil. It was the one with green paint all over it. And the paint from one of your paintbrushes is a match to the car.
Your daughter said you disappeared into the garage right after dinner. That's when you stuck the rag in the engine between the catalytic converter and the heat shield.
I think we all know what that did. Hmm?
You think the daughter had anything to do with it?
It is the morning.
You know, none of these people make a move without a direct order from Alvarado, especially not torching his own place.
Well, think about it. When Marie leaked the warrant information, it had to have gone in and out through him somehow. He's the boss.
Things still move in and out of his cell: laundry, food.
What about all the other books he's been reading?
He looks like he could still be in high school. Boy, football's gotten a lot more brutal since my playing days.
There's no high school football fields around here anyway. What do you think, Grissom?
Blood pool tells me the helmet must've been here for a while.
Probably got pinballed down the road.
No.
Hey, did Sara ever say anything to you about her and Grissom?
So you knew about the two of them?
Where's the uniform?  If he's not a player, what's with the helmet?
Got to be around here somewhere.
Twenty yards away, two hours later.
I better get this ten-card to Mandy right away.
Hey, Mandy. I got a ten-card on our John Doe.
Hey, if you had a kid, would you collect a safe-kit on them?
Then go to bed every night hoping you don't have to use it.
Yeah?
Okay, good. Thanks.
Mr. Bartley?
I'm... Nick.
Stokes. Uh ...
Shouldn't I be talking to your parents?
Matt ... your brother wasn't on the football team, but when we found him, he was wearing a football helmet. Why is that?
Is that how you got injured?
So why the helmet?
Yeah.
No, I don't.
It's not surprising. We found the body on the side of the highway.
Okay, Hodges, dazzle me.
Guess I better get my go-cart on.
Oh, uh ... that's awesome.
No. No, not really.  You know, when I was a kid, we used to make these things out of lunch trays and old lawn mower engines.
Hot Rod!
Get out of the truck! Get out of the truck now!
Get out of the truck now!
Nothing says I'm guilty like running from the cops, dumb-ass. Give me his wallet.
Rodney Banks. We're with the Vegas Crime Lab, Mr. Banks.
Where'd you get that belt?
Where?
So your statement is he just spontaneously lost his head?
And then what happened?
There's road gravel embedded in all these tires.
Well, if it turns out to be leather, it would confirm Hot Rod's story that he towed the second cart back using Vinnie's belt.
So how did Hot Rod decapitate Vinnie while racing down a highway at 60 miles an hour?
If it would've happened that way, we would've found trace from whatever did it. The only trace in the neck and arm wounds was rubber from truck tires.
If that go-cart was going 60 miles an hour drafting a truck going the same speed, and that truck blows a tire, sending a two-pound projectile into the driver's neck ...
Whoo!  You ... uh ... you want a ride?
What about you, Ricky Bobby?
Okay.
Fourth, actually. If I didn't know any better, I'd say the city was trying to get rid of us. That's a hundred dollar fine right there.
That's not good.
It smells metallic.
Oh, man. What the hell is that?
Bet it tastes like chicken.
Yeah, I'm sure that's what he wants everybody to think, too.
Hey, Archie.
Whatever you're doing, that's more important.
It's an exorcism.
How did he get up there?
Okay, super, I'm ready to cut.
He probably tried to pull himself up.
Mutilated tranny strung up in a tree.
Bet I know how he got up there.
No. No, no. I wouldn't do that. I was just ... uh... I was getting a cup of coffee.
Why, do you got something?
Larry Ludwig. Convicted of aggravated assault and DUI. Bring up his parole record. 
There you go. He works at the same water treatment plant as my victim.
Right.
And I'm Nick Stokes, we're with the Vegas Crime Lab. We're here investigating the death of one of your employees, Brian Towne.
Go ahead and take off your gloves. Show us your palms.
These tire treads were under a tree where Brian's body was found.  They're from a Chevy Colorado. Isn't that what you drive?
Yeah, absolutely. 
No, you kind of broke up the party, man, when you cut him up with a beer bottle and you hanged him in a tree.
We better not find any of Brian's blood in your flatbed.
Well, that's carp. Nobody really eats those.
I don't see a gun or cartridge casings anywhere. He has some fairly dense gunshot residue patterns. Shooter was only a couple of feet away, practically face-to-face.
I bet he knew his killer.
That's Brian's boss. I met him. This notebook charts hormone levels. No names, just numbers. There's over 40 test subjects here. If this guy was running some kind of underground clinic here, then where are the drugs?
Warrick found vials like that in Brian's bedroom. Check that freezer.
Shoot me a number.
June 20, 2007.
Hey. Heard you were looking for me.
Really?
What's her name?
Ah, yes. Tucson, the capital of Texas.
Well, Paul Cyden's DNA and fingerprints finally arrived.
You think he just climbed that big ol' tree all by himself?
Okay, yeah. What about the mutilation?
So this was a hate crime.
Where they let the kids fish and swim.
Thanks to Brian.
Well, if that's the case, then why didn't the other boys develop breasts?
That reservoir is supposed to be lined to prevent contamination.
What about Brian Towne?
But he turned you down. Is that why you shot him?
Congratulations on your last film. Any idea who sent her these, Mr. Vespucci?
This hers?
Wallet, keys, and cell phone still in there.
Looks like somebody broke the glass, reached in, unlocked it and opened it.
Uh, Jim ... I got her.
And I believe she's died for the last time.
Whoever stuck her under this poster was trying to send a twisted message.
She was last seen alive about 15 hours ago.
There's a whole lot of something here, but it doesn't really look like blood to me.
Smells sweet. Karo syrup and food coloring -- it's prop blood.
The question is, where does the fake blood end and the real blood begin?
How's it going in here?
Actors.
The axe isn't what killed her.
Like a spear, or a pipe of some kind?
If the axe was planted in her back postmortem to conceal t original puncture site, then ... we don't have a murder weapon.
After examining the crime scene, I determined there were between 200 and
Right, right. So, I compared the initial coroner's report with the last entry in her weight loss journal -- which was taken no more than an hour or two before her death. And guess what?
Six pounds light. That's six pints of blood at a pound each nowhere in or around the body. She was moved.
Okay. I'll get a hold to swing. We're going to need some help.
Hey.
I've got the hat Lafoon was wearing in the surveillance video. The wear on the strap indicates that it's been set larger ... like it was adjusted for somebody with a bigger head or something.
So I'm going to get it back, see if I can get some prints off it.
Hey, Archie, could you bring up the surveillance video from Repulsion Pictures, please?
What's the best you can get me on the face?
He seems to be deliberately looking away from the camera. Take him to the window.
Freeze that. Zoom in on the sleeve. Does that jacket look a little small for that guy to you?
I measured the height of the window. It's five feet. How tall is the guy?
Vincent Lafoon's only five-foot-ten. This guy's six-foot-two, six-foot-three, easy. And a lot rounder. The only guy that big in the bunch is Mason.
Catherine, it's Nick. Listen, the surveillance video footage is a fake. I think we got the wrong brother in custody. I think Mason set up Vincent to set Oliver up. It's getting complicated.
Nothing was stolen?
Baseball bat there, hammer here-- weapons of convenience. Guy seems to grab whatever's handy.
Why kidnap a kid, wait six years, then kill him?
According to this, the kid was adopted. Did you take a look at the biological parents?
Was the dead girl wearing any jewelry when you found her?
Then that's a good call, man, 'cause she's wearing some in just about every one of these pictures.
I wouldn't doubt if she kept a lot of it in that box. I'll check with the local pawnshops, see if anything's been hocked.
Yep.
Is that the surveillance?
Okay.
Mm-hmm.
Three numbers? I don't know too many serial killers that dial 911. He's calling Information.
Uh, yes, this is CSI Nick Stokes with the Vegas PD. I need to get the telephone number of one of your pay phones on the casino floor. Near the ... uh ... Let It Ride tables.
Yes, ma'am.
Oh, great. Okay.
Mm-hmm. Very good. Thank you.
What is it?
17-41-33. Yes, ma'am, day before yesterday.
Gina. Gina Farentino. He called Information to get her number in Boulder City, but it's unlisted.
He knows where she works.
How much did he win?
I need to take a look at his W2-G, okay?
If you make over twelve hundred bucks, Uncle Sam gets his cut, you know?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, the cashiers don't really seem to care,  And even when that's fake ... you can't fake one of those.
Hey, Catherine.
Chains and padlocks. There's no roof access from the dorm.
Okay, I'll work my way down.
That's affirmative.
Perks of the job.
Hey, Catherine, do you see any wounds on the body inconsistent with the fall?
I think I know how it got there.
Drag 'n' drop.
Hey. Any luck with dorm security? 
Okay.
Yeah. You should have seen mine. It was really bad.
Sexual lubricant. Give me that.
Yeah, or just another way to get attention.
Mm-hmm.
How does that work?
Marlon West was on trial for the murder of Stacy Vollmer.
He confessed. It was later thrown out on a technicality. We really didn't need it. The prosecution's case against Marlon was very strong.
She's a pint-size Machiavelli. She manipulated events, fabricated evidence, and in the end ...
GHB does occur naturally in the body. You sure she was drugged?
Okay, so then maybe she was roofied, raped, then murdered.
I didn't find any drug paraphernalia in her room. It was pretty consistent with a straight edge lifestyle.
Okay.
Really? So this guy roofies himself along with Kira?
Wait a minute. I think I know what they shared.
Kira and Jordan had unprotected s*x, right?
That means ... they both came in contact ... with this.
We know Marlon's fingerprints are on the lube tube. We know he was jealous. Maybe the GHB-lube was his way of getting back at her. You know? Give a drug-free girl a bad trip.
Yeah. But still, that doesn't conclusively put anybody at the crime scene.
Hey, you know what, Marlon? You can save it, ‘cause unlike most people, you're not going to get me to underestimate you. I already know you're every bit as smart as your sister, especially when it comes to creating confusion.
Open up.
Bite down.
Let it sit.
It's a physical match. Puts Marlon at the scene.
Seems like a lot of pictures for a college band.
What guy would like having his little sister around to watch as he gets his ass kicked in front of his girlfriend?
So this new guy pops Marlon in the mouth, chips his tooth. Marlon's humiliated, decides to take it out on Kira. Kills her, then tries to make it look like a suicide, and in the midst of their struggle, his tooth fragment ends up in her fist?
What are you looking for now?
I can't believe Archie's gone.
It's gotta be the dealer.
According to this, twenty bricks of coke were logged into evidence just past midnight. The explosion occurred about a half an hour later. But there are twenty-one wrappers here. And since no one entered or exited the lab during that time frame, it means the explosive was planted in the suitcase here. Which means ... 
Chemicals have been sent to Trace for ID, but the bomb appears to be a binary explosive.
Killer hides the loaded brick amongst the others ...
... and pressure arms it ...
Liquid A in ampoule mixes with solid B, creating an unstable chemical explosive ... 
All you need to do is move it.
Looks like you're one blasting cap shy, Bob.
The explosive was liquid nitro-acetate and solid ammonium nitrate packed in baking soda.
Yeah, he said it needed to be refrigerated.
Nitrogen tetra-hydride ... 
They produce nitro-acetate.
Baking soda was used to conceal the explosive, smartass.
Yeah, you're welcome.
Man, I don't know if I'm more tired or hungry right now. You wanna get something to eat?
After the shift we just pulled?
I don't think so, man. Maybe another time, huh?
I'll catch ya later.
All right, Grissom. That's it for me. I'm out of here.
Yeah, I'm going over to Frank's to grab something to eat. I'll probably be there for at least an hour if you want to ... if you want to join me.
You know, we don't have to talk about anything in particular. Just two guys having breakfast. I just don't think it's good for people to be alone too much.
If you want to, cool. If not, cool. Whatever.
I tried to trace garbage man's cell phone. Like we expected, it's disposable. So I tracked down the distributor. It was paid for in cash under a bogus me. But I did get an AFIS hit off his print.
Brody Biggs. Former cop.
1975, police academy graduation. I contacted LVPD. They said he quit the force back in 1980 with a perfect record.
Social came back to several different garages around town. He was a freelance mechanic for 20 years.
It's Jason Crewes, 27. Got a hit off his work card. He's worked at five different casinos over the last six years.
Well, it doesn't look like Jason planned on going anywhere. I know a lot of people in this phone.
Did you see anything?
Well, this would have been the perfect murder if Jason's body would have actually made it to the landfill. Would have been incinerated.
Hey.
What's up?
Hey, what are those?
Those pills?
Really?
How long you been taking those?
Aren't you still taking those sleeping pills, too?
So now ... you're taking uppers and downers.
No, you need to give yourself a break, Warrick.
No. No, I'm not going to let it go.
You need to take a look at yourself, Warrick. And I care because I'm your friend.
All right?
All right, tell me about these bruises.
That should be enough for a warrant.

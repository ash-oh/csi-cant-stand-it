There's nothing good to eat around here.
We, uh, played a hunch; checked with homicide. You were late.
Bye.
Need help with your homicide?
She took the bus instead. Case solved.
Detective Secula.
What's up?
Yeah, well, missing person -- could be interesting.
Auto unit been by yet?
Yeah.
Secula ... something wrong?
That doesn't mean I wasn't going to. 
Is our missing person a redhead?
Call in a tow to the CSI garage. This case is now officially interesting.
Hey.
Good, good.  Are you putting one of Lindsey's drawings into evidence?
Yeah, I heard your missing person was a painting.
Oh!
There's no more hair. Not even a trace. No signs of foul play.
Yeah. Yeah, too clean ... ... which begs the question ... 
Hand me the phenothaline, please.
Well ... I am checking ... to see why someone scrubbed this carpet so clean. If there is blood present ... ... we'll know why.
Right.
Hey. Dead end. How about you?
Her abductor sold her card or is using it himself. What motel?
That's right around the corner from where we found her car.
Good job.
Are you Sheryl Applegate?
You, uh ... you haven't been abducted have you, Mrs. Applegate?
We found evidence of blood in your car.
That you're okay.  You're going to have to fill in the blanks.
May I see your discoloration?
You want to do time?
Well, that depends. Was she the assaulter or the assaultee?
No, I'm not even going there. 
Lace.
Gentlemen, Nick Stokes. I'm here for the 416; something about a special request.
Over where?
Thanks.
Excuse me ... ma'am?
You got to be kidding me.
Yeah, yeah, Kristy Hopkins, what are you doing here?
Whoa, whoa, whoa ... he spit on you?
All right, all right, break it up! Ease up! Ease up!
Kristy!
Get over here! I need your shirt.
Because every time we meet you put yourself in a position where you have to take them off.
Down, boy. What can you tell me? Is there saliva on it?
What, is it on the internet? Might as well be. Just remember that.
Gross.
What's that stuff?
No.
Then Kristy was telling the truth. But it doesn't mean it was the security guard's spit.
I'm going to need a sample.
If you saw the girl that went with this blouse ... you'd try.
She got in a fight with a Security Guard.
Are you asking me what I think you're asking me?
I don't believe this. You've always been so cool.
Sanders ratted me out, right?
I don't think so.
Yeah, I bet there are a lot of people looking to steal your two-headed scorpion. Not to mention Miss Piggy. 
I was out of line earlier. I'm not sleeping with her, if it helps any.
And, for the record she wasn't working -- she was shopping. And the security guard was a jerk, man. He pushed her around, then he spit on her. That's why she lost it.
I can't. There's something about her. Looking at her. She doesn't have anybody else. I had Sanders run a test on the shirt. There's saliva on it but the problem is, I can't get a match. The security guard refuses to give me a sample.
Black, no sugar.
Like I said on the phone I don't want to seem biased here. This girl's nothing to me. She's a hooker.
Yeah, professionally. But my profession, not hers. I cut her some slack a while back. She's bad news but she's a babe.
Yeah, between you and me, I should have busted her, but I thought I might get lucky.
Yeah. Next time she gets in a jam she throws my name out. My boss not pleased. So ...  I want you to write down your own statement seal it up in this envelope and I'll hand deliver it to the DA. It'll be good for both of us.
No problem. Us guys have got to stick together, right? That's right.
Us guys have to stick together, right? He said, right. You the man!
So, I mean, I could have used an STR-DNA but it's too state-of-the-art; it's overkill. So I used an HLA-DQ A1, with a ... polymarker.
You don't care about this at all, do you?
DA threw out the case.
Yeah.
Maybe you should try not getting into trouble. You do owe me one.
You know where to find me.
Mmm. Get to rate the boss. I dig this.
Two days before the Super Bowl.
Hmm. Organization ... minus one.
Whew! Two days before the super bowl and they're already killing each other.
Sergeant.
Oh ... gunshot wound to the head, point-blank range.
Check this out. Hearing aid?
Possibly. 
Got some condensation on the window. You should get a shot of this.
A rule of thumb: $2,500 an inch. There's got to be ... fifteen thousand there?
Giants minus nine.
It's a super bowl ticket. Straight bet-- $30,000.
Teller 12.
517? What's that?
I'd be willing to bet there's a mother out there that wishes you hadn't.
Yeah, we thought you might. So?
He didn't have a name?
So ... how do we find this, uh ... Voice?
Yeah.
He's not talking to himself, is he?
Yeah, I guess all the runners heard about it by now, huh?
What was Joey's route, exactly?
Are you interested in helping us better understand Joey's crime scene, or ... not?
Did you think to get back to your boss? Try to make amends?
Did you tell Joey to get out of town-that someone might try to harm him on behalf of your boss?
Whoa, whoa! Hold on, now. Nobody's going after anybody. Okay, he doesn't have to give us a name, Mrs. Hillman. Alright. Danny, you wear an earpiece, right? Just give us the frequency your runners operate on.
Yeah.
Okay ... here's what we're going to do. Open your nostrils.
You're on cool breeze. A hundred bucks.
This way, gents.
Yeah. I don't have it on me. I'll have to bring it to you.
Mm-hmm.
Hey, how you doing?
The runner ... um, 702. 
I owe him a little cash.
Um ... you have an envelope I could use?
Nice watch.
Thought you were getting out of this business.
Later.
New job, huh? Joey's old route?  Did you get so scared when you shot him that you forgot the money?
Well, you better get one that knows forensics ...  Dispatch, victor 19. Code 462 on the 4-20 suspect Monaco.
Oh, no. I just pulled a double and I still have to file my shift report.
Well, I guess I grew up.
Enjoy.
Here you go. Thanks, man.
Kristy? 
Kristy!
Hey. Back off.
Crime scene investigator.
Hey, we going to have a problem?
You okay?
I suppose you need a ride.
No. Come on.
Not that it's any of my business but maybe you should think about changing careers.
Yeah?
That's good.
Yeah. Yeah.
I don't think that'd be a good idea.
Hey, it's me. You in the shower? What are you doing? Anyway, if you check your messages I don't have to work till later. So I thought, since you're between careers you might want to grab a late ... 
... breakfast.
Not a lot. What's ... what's going on?
Who's the decedent? 
Yeah, I must've, uh ... I must've got my wires crossed. I'll see you.
Hey, guys.  Can I steal you for a minute?
Yeah, I know, and I'm sorry, but I don't think this can wait.
I wasn't till last night after I broke up her fight with this guy, uh ... Jack.
Yeah, and I can tell you what he's going to find. My fingerprints; my DNA.
I wasn't.
We had a connection, you know? A chemistry thing, I guess.
She was irresistible, man.
I took off around four.
Who told you?
So people know I was with Kristy last night?
Maybe I should just go to Ecklie and tell him I was there.
I can't just sit here.
Yeah.
Okay.
How's it going, Cath?
It's no big deal. What's up, Ecklie?
I assume you're trying to prove Kristy Hopkins and I were sexually active last night.
And my DNA will match, no warrant necessary. And I have something else for you. 
I got this off a valet surveillance tape.
You just love that, don't you?
I hate that guy.
Yeah.
You contact her family?
Has anyone claimed her for burial? Friend? Old roommate?
No. I'll pay.
Doc, I'm giving this girl a proper burial. I don't much care about my career right now. Someone wants to throw me in jail for that so be it.
Well?
DNA didn't pan out, huh?
Thank you. 
Hi. Just the guy I wanted to see.
Tell me why you did it.
She was going back to college, turning her life around getting out of the business, and you killed her for it! Why?
Do you think I'm going to believe the John that killed her?
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess you're right. Because there's no happy ending for you. Twenty-five to life.
Outstanding.
Yeah.
You got it.
It looks like somebody in the dental society database saw our posting.
Sid Tucker.
He has records that go back thirty years.
It's lower level third from the middle. 
Better memory than you. And ... our first character match.
Two for two.
Nolan Ryan pitches another perfect game.
Mel Bennett. 326 Franklin Street. Date of birth September 6, 1931. He was 70.
Sure.
See this tissue?
Yeah. Tells us blood was not pumping through Mel Bennett's veins when he was cut up.
Yeah. 
I wonder how much it costs to feed all these fish.
Hmm? Right.
Marco?
You want to get out of there, sir? Pool closed at sundown.
Someone's bitter.
You? Tired? I thought you never sleep.
Nice. Nice.
What up, G?
Don't look at me. I've got 'sunshine' all night.
Check for DNA in the sexual assault kit and the fingernail, please.
Tut's Tomb. Steak and eggs, $1.99.
Two for one.
What do you got?
Same social? You're sure? 
Bam!
Oh, yeah.
Grissom? 
Can I talk to you?
I just ... 
Grissom, this is important.
We matched the DNA taken from Lacey Duvall to a cold case in Texas ten years ago.
The suspect's name was Chad Matthews.
Sara ran Patrick Haynes' social. The real Haynes is deceased. So Patrick Haynes is Chad Matthews and Chad Matthews is on the run.
Hmm. Yeah, some guys still like to foot the bill.
Hey, I only go Dutch if girls ask the wrong question.
What do you drive?
No. No, it's not. What it means is, How much money do you make? So you can take care of me.
Ooh. Either that or a dimpled ballot. 
Hmm. Let's connect the dots.
Here, I'll show you. Catherine, you wear pierced earrings. May I?
Sign your name, please.
Now, nobody signs their signature exactly the same way twice. Not even you, chicken scratch. If they do, then one of them's a forgery. Here's where connecting the dots comes in.
We dot the lines... and curves ... of the signature.
Who picked this place?
Hey, did anyone tell Grissom where we were having lunch?
Oh, that is good. One of our moes has six names that we know of including Chad Matthews.
Okay, Patrick Haynes.
Whoever. He commits a murder ten years ago. Why give up your DNA so easily?
Right on.
What's the cookie?
Wait, wait. Time out, now. I had half a Caesar and a coffee. How's my end 20 bucks?
Excellent idea, Sara. You're catching on. I'd love to.
It looks like a high heel print. Maybe abducted. 
Did she know the guy? Did he use his car or hers?
Cartridge casings. They don't look like hunters' either.
We couldn't have been there long. No elements.
Scent pads?
Looks like a giant dustbuster.
Yeah. Yeah, then we pull them out when we know enough about this denim guy to find a proximal location.
And left two cartridge casings behind for us. Thank you very much.
Still, you'd think the bad guys would figure we'd eventually start a database on cartridge casings, huh?
Well, well, well. Looks like this gun was used before in a case we've handled. 
North Vegas shooting.
Hey, you guys, this North Vegas shooting with the same casings as our Jane Doe's?
It was gang-related. And homicide never found the shooter.
Snakebacks.
Lets the opposition know who was responsible.
First-name basis, Sara?
Our ball cap belongs to somebody in this neighborhood. These houses are full of people who know the guy who wears it.
Why can't we just use those scent pads?
Great, great. Why'd you even suggest it?
Now you want to use the dogs to track down the Jane Doe shooter?
Yeah, but I spoke to Brass. He said we can't get a warrant on anything we need from the suspect's house-- gun, jeans, nothing.
You're rushing this for Sara.
Whoa!  Are we supposed to be able to keep up with those guys?
Guy's wearing the evidence in plain sight. We just got lucky.
Yeah.
Hey, Sara, did anyone ever tell you, you have a pretty good singing voice?
Come on. I've heard you around here. People never tell you that?
Yeah. Yeah. Take a look.
Okay, let's go tell the boss. 
Hey, if you go near that Thorpe kid...
I'm just saying ...
Unusual way to penetrate a safe.
How much was taken? 
Yellow looks like transfer from the murder weapon but what's with the glitter?
Your hair looks great, Cath.
Well, the back entrance was overgrown with them.
Yeah. Yeah, Jim, hi. I took these photos at the crime scene. 
Safe was cracked with a plasma lance.
It's a high-powered electric blaster. It could cut through that hard plate with extreme precision. It's not common, but effective. 
Crime scene photo from a robbery case in '99. 
Joseph Felton our dead guy, was arrested but granted immunity in exchange for his testimony against his partner, Darin Hanson who used a plasma lance to crack that safe. Darin Hanson ...
... was released from prison last month. His last known address -Vegas.
Yeah, they hook it up.
... break through the rear entrance of the pottery store.
Hanson lances the safe ...
Once the safe is cracked, Hanson steps back allowing Felton to collect the cash.
With Felton's attention diverted Hanson seizes the moment ... kills him.
Revenge for testifying against him and putting him in prison.
No, no ... but I think we know who to ask.
So it's a coincidence that he was killed shortly after you were released from prison.
The transcript from your trial says that you used a plasma lance in that
Tammy Felton's our murder suspect?
Whoa, wait. I thought her prints from the crime scene -- they weren't fresh.
Well, the swab from the head wound's at trace.
I'm on it.
Do you have the results on the swab yet?
Uh... from the dead guy at the pottery store? The coroner sent over a sample. You were supposed to analyze the mineral content.
Grissom's on a missing persons-- he hasn't sent you anything.
Oh, yeah. Catherine's working with me.
Great.
No.
Do you see the sparkly bits?
Yeah, ready.
Nothing yet.
Whoa, whoa, whoa ... stop.
Are you serious?
Which is radioactive. Do we need to evacuate the building or anything?
You sure?
Yeah. He says I'm okay, but you know Greg. Tell me, am I radiating a green glow?
What's uranium doing on a murder weapon anyway?
Color enhancers?
Say no more.
You got to be kidding me.
We have a warrant.
I should get a finder's fee. 
Here. One for each of you.
I need a darkroom.
Now, if uranium is present the photons should react with the film. 
Okay, I'm exposing it ...
Thanks.
Done.
No mercy. 
This guy's stabbed at least five times. Got some reddish hair. Vic's hair is brown.
Now! Let's go guys! Go! SARA: Pick the jacket up!
Let's go! BRASS: Bring me a body bag. I want to cover this woman! NICK: Get a bag, hurry up!
Let's go, let's go! Okay, I've got it.
All right, let's get him out.
Don't even bother bagging it.
Hey, Greg.
Somebody's been putting in way too much overtime.
Cute toes?
Mmm.
Mmm.
Oh, what's in her heart?
Dude, you're sick. Man, you've officially lost it.
But whatever happened to getting to know someone over coffee ... letting the relationship evolve? Romantic is sending flowers not bogarting her skin cells. 
Um, pulled some hair off a male stabbing vic.
What?
Cat hair?
Hope you're not allergic there, boss.
Cat hair. Found similar hair on Kevin Shepherd's clothing.
Nope. No hairs on the wife.
Victim number three. Wrong place, wrong time. Saw something she shouldn't.
What?
None of the above.
Hey, Grissom, you know that theory I had?
I'd like to revise it.
My evidence is in the layout room.
All the wounds sustained by Kevin Shepherd were to his torso. Now, look at this. 
Blood flow on the left instep of Kevin Shepherd's shoe.
Amy Shepherd was too far away but Jessica Hall was alive and bleeding.
Gravity. Warrick, please, on the floor our back.
Sara, you're Jessica.
Come on, now. 
I say hinder.
She was in on it. She held him down while someone else stabbed him.
I heard the lab matched the blood on Kevin Shepherd's shoe to Jessica. My theory's getting better and better.
What's he doing calling the woman who helped kill him?
I think I found a keypiece of evidence. 
The redhead we've been looking for.
Chances are Shepherd was here without his wife.
To access Achex, double-click icon. User name: Jessica. Password: Money.
Yeah. 
Achex. Personal on-line banking. Deposits, checking, money transfers everything under the sun. 
Okay, I'm in. Direct deposit from Beaumont's department store$500 a week -- probably her weekly paycheck.
What, she win the lottery?
Let's see who she gave it to.
No luck.
Wait a minute -- Shepherd paid Jessica to murder him and his wife?
I took this from our suspect's apartment.
Don't cancel your next reservation. It wasn't a carjacking.
Quarters for laundry. Not incriminating. Pay parking ticket. Andre's at 9:00 P.M.? 
Whoa!
Assuming K is Kevin they were planning to meet three days after he was murdered.
No. Neither was Jessica.
I'm with you. Why'd he end up dead?
He was cheating on his wife, Amy.
Which means he didn't need CPR.
Maybe not. In 1997, Jessica and Justin had a joint account. And they shared the same last name.
No, thanks, I'm an iced tea man.
Okay, then what?
Never seen him like this before.
Here's the father's bottle of cola -- here's the unknown. I duplicated conditions and monitored the pressure that escaped from the father's bottle which he told you had been open two hours against one I know was open two hours. Kept this log. Pressure released every quarter hour.
Well, I've got trace running tests now, but I did an unscientific whiff test. 
Picked up a hint of some kind of booze.
I'll take a swatch, get it back to you ASAP.
We got a call about ten minutes ago-- a shooting at Vegas Grounds Coffee Shop, eighth and main. Multiple fatalities.
One person dead, it's a shame; more than one's a party.
Thank you.
Speed metal. Couldn't hear a bomb go off over this.
Guy wasn't light with the ammo. This place is raining shell casings.
Who's the muscle?
Cash taken?
You're thinking hit?
She's probably still in high school.
Bless her heart.
Another nine-millimeter, just like our casings.
Once the coroner makes a positive I.D. Their families will be notified.
Good news, bad news. Same caliber, different gun.
What we have is five dead bodies.
Smoke and mirrors.
If it was a hit, the guy came to the front door took out Al and Frankie, and got the witnesses. Bullets will confirm it. Shooter was standing here when he shot Al ...
... bamm. Once in the chest. This is Flynn. 
One miss ... 
... One hit ... one through and through.
Each victim gets a different color. Blue beams are isolated. The kid with the cd player was alone.
Shooter was positioned between Flynn and the front door. Flynn eats it ... ? Nah.
I would have taken out big Al ... bodyguard first.
Ident found both of the bodyguards' paws on the counter.
Big Al would already be dead. It doesn't make any sense.
What if he came through the back?
Yeah. Yeah. Shot twice in the back while headed for the rear exit.
What?
Like this.
I love this job.
Assuming Erin was running for her life the shooter follows her in the back room shoots her twice -- he would have been shooting toward the parking lot.
He'd only shoot toward the front if there's somebody there. 
Yeah, and somebody else saw. Frankie Flynn was an innocent bystander. Wrong place, wrong time.
You really think Erin knew she was pregnant? I mean, six weeks?
Yeah. Brass talked to her parents. There was no guy in her life.
Stall them. We want a paternity test.
911 page?
What's up?
Son of a bitch swapped the gun barrel out.
Could be an incomplete tool mark. Maybe the guy dropped his gun. Either way, we still don't have the barrel.
But we've got Kendall's ammo. What about bullet batching?
Every casing's got two pieces of information on it: Manufacturer and caliber.
So if you compared the casings we collected at the crime scene with the casings from Brad Kendall's gun...
Which would link Brad's ammo to the crime even though we can't link his gun.
But still enough to build a case.
Well, Catherine's working on a hunch.
Microscopic surface analysis. This ought to make things more clear.
Casings from your gun are on the right. Casings collected from the crime scene are on the left.
Six weeks pregnant with your child.
I guess he won't be eating dinner tonight.
He picked the wrong time of day to be running alone. Dusk is when the animals come out.
So what are we dealing with?
Most people don't admit when they're wrong.
So a dog killed him, then someone came along and cut him up.
Go back to the crime scene. Collect the dog's scat.
I didn't realize how many dogs take their walks up here when I said that.
No, hair and fiber is evidence, Warrick. This is combat duty.
Don't even waste your time. That's cougar.
See the rabbit hair in the feces? Don't you remember the seminar?
Julie?
Looks like dirty ice.
It's evidence of a picnic, Warrick.
Corn. Hamburger. Rawhide. But no human cellular tissue in this sample.
Man, do you turn it on like this at your seminars?
Well, if he's got bits of jogger hanging out of his mouth, cuff him.
Does this mean Simba's going to the big dog pound in the sky?
Well, I can tell you we found a unique sample at the crime scene. Great dane-sized scat containing bits of premium pet store kibble.
Sirloin, rice -- nothing artificial.
Dry ice. Frozen co2 sublimates into invisible gas, not water.
Surgeon?
Warrick. I got a match.
The scat I found at the crime scene and the scat from the doctor's house are the same, except for one difference. The stuff from the backyard -- full of human cellular tissue. Jogger DNA.
Weird, isn't it?
To prove the presence of heme -- the stuff that makes blood red ... 
Yeah.
But we found evidence of blood on it.
Hey, you're the one who said that lady doc keeps skipping town.
This is only part of the kitchen-- the rest is in those bags and boxes.
Yeah.
Whoa, whoa. So she's not selling the organs on the black market ... she's eating them?
Okay. Good. I'm on it.
Look. Grissom I know this is a bad time to bitch to the boss but, uh, I've been a CSI Level 3 for nine months now. I was a CSI before Warrick. Warrick works D.B.'S solo. Why can't I?
Silk, silk, silk?
Milk.
Look, I'm not one of your suspects you can trick, okay? If I'm not ready, be a man -- tell me I'm not ready.
You know why I took this job? Honestly? I wanted to pack heat, walk under the yellow tape, be the man ... but mostly, because I want you to think I'm a good CSI.
Oh, man.
If it's the rest of him he's been skinned.
Yeah. Most likely to avoid I.D. Hey, Sara.
No approaching surface prints. No tire tracks. Only O'Riley's boot prints. These are ours. Look at the area around the corpse. Look at the big dent in the ground, like a meteor hit.
What are we doing? Walking through the garage.
All right. It's simple. We got the body, they got the head. The BMW's fair game. Come on, Sara, where's your Noriega?
Grissom. 
Uh ... Sara ... want to take a look at this?
Peanuts on the gas pedal. You're kidding.
Hmm.
You up for a riddle?
Okay, repeat after me: Silk, silk, silk.
What do cows drink?
Never mind.
Mm-hmm. Perp thought he could cover his tracks by taking off his shoes.
Oh ... so this is the rest of his body?
Yeah-- whatever punctures, whatever chops. 
Bob Villa.
It's private.
Enough.
Grissom didn't tell me anything. 
I put this together myself. 
Give me some light here, will you, partner?
All right, it's like this: Sock prints were found at the crime scene: Size 11. Shoes Grissom took from the closet here: Size 11. Dasilva's shoe size: Ten. So whose size 11's were they? Grissom missed something.
I'm calling Grissom.
All right. Thanks.
You sure you can't help me out?
We found one of your uniforms in his closet. Any idea how it got there?
Guys ... look, boss, I'm sorry. I thought I was onto something here. I had a conflict in shoe sizes so I thought I'd play a hunch. Sara was right there. We were checking out the shoes ...  ... and we found some peanuts in the cuff links and go up and Spurs Corral.
I don't think so.
...so that's why I buzzed you guys down. You got to follow your hunches, right?
What? You're looking at the sombrero?
Okay, Mr. Applewhite ... take a walk.
You see, everyone's foot makes a unique well impression. Check it out. 
The, uh width ... ball of the foot ... instep ... arch ... and, uh ... 
... size 11 for dessert.
Yeah, he did.
What can you tell us?
A hypnotic.
Percussive control.
Okay. I'll go back to the scene, try to find something like it.
Will do.
Hey, Gil, you want to give me the skinny on this meeting of yours? I'm on my way back to the crime scene. 
I got paged about the signature case.
Freeze!
Hey.
Get out of there. Get out of the closet.
What are you doing?
All right. Quiet. Quiet. Are you out of your mind? I could've killed you. This is a crime scene. You don't belong here. Unless you want me to get the cop at the front door you'll get out of here now. And I'd better not see any pictures of this apartment in your paper ... or I'll have the D.A. on your front door.
You didn't scare me.  Mm-mm.
No.
You guys got a sec? He's wearing latex gloves. The thick kind, too. He must know the thin ones leave prints.
You know, it's not fair, Grissom. You know more about signatures than most of them put together.
All right, well, I got dibs on Eileen Snow. And I have a strong feeling I'm going to be the one to break the case.
Yeah, I'm looking in front of Eileen Snow's apartment. This security guard said he saw a guy burn rubber out of there tight of Eileen's murder.
Yeah, well, there's no rubber here. On the pavement or curb. A coup of oil spots, that's about it. And I called Brass. Nobody took any photographs of any tire marks. Not the Las Vegas P.D. Not the Feds.
Mm-hmm.
I was just looking for a quiet spot to call my girlfriend.
I got to run, peanut. Love you, too. Bye-bye.
Give me some of that.
You, uh... you got me, right, War?
How's this for service?
Re... fried beans. Mmm!
Whoo!
He's altering his voice, sir, electronically.
In a car trunk -- that kind of thing.
No.  You're in mine.
I outrank you.
Keep telling yourself that.
I know what to tell the audio guy.
I got it under control. 
Swear. 
Later.
Captain Brass. Hey.
Sorry. Sorry. Grissom told me to hook up with you. He says the drop place will be a crime scene.
Why don't they move in on the guy?
Well, he's been there five minutes.
Here, kitty, kitty...
You think that's him? You think that's our guy right there?
Hey, Catherine what time's your little girl coming by?
Yeah, but I got her a chem set.
Stop flirting with me. Cath, really, when's the party?
Hey, just in time. We're giving it a final run.
It is. Now, ransom tape against your exemplar. You got it loaded up, T.H.D.?
There's something wrong. There's just a green line.
We got our kidnapper.
I'll call Brass, tell him to go pick the guy up.
What did I do wrong?
Like what? We already matched the guy's voice.
You think I don't know that? Aw, you been second-guessing me ever since I got on this case.
I'll go back to the tape.
Hey!
Yeah, the ransom tape enhanced -- mega-enhanced.
All right. Hey, I just ... I didn't know there was more to look for, you know?
Audio downloaded everything. Dubs are cued up.
I'm sure you all recognize Chip's voice unaltered. Now, one more time with a slight variation.
Heck, we can lift entire speeches just to see what's underneath.
All right, let's go, Laura. Officer has a car waiting out front.
What do you think, bro? Breakfast on me?
Ouch. Well, time-and-a-half. A cup of java, and you're set.
That's harassment. 
Later, bro.
I know, a dead body at a fraternity. 7:00 A.M.-Looks like we're pulling another double.
Yeah.
Hideous. Thank you.
I can't believe I used to live in a place like this. It seems like a hundred years 
Guys, Nick Stokes. This is Sara Sidle. We're with the crime lab.
Hey, Matt.
Okay.
Good god.
Coroner pronounce?
Let's get him down.
Was James depressed?
So, you guys let James know he wasn't getting in, right?
So he asphyxiated by hanging? Are you ruling suicide?
But we found him swinging from the ceiling.
Oh, no, I ... don't have to look. I have a pretty good idea what this is all about, so ...
Knock yourself out.
Come on, man, I was a Greek and we had all kinds of policies, too. Guys still hazed.
Yeah, you know, your, uh ...
Answer the question, guys.
Humiliation, initiation ...  ... appreciation.
Right, right?
Bust it out.
I'm nuking a burrito.
Mm-hmm. That's interesting.
Kyle, I'm getting that hazing feeling.
Tell me about the liver.
Kyle ... Kyle ... eleven years ago I was you, man. Smoking cigars in closets, playing tanks. I wore a trout in my jean pocket for seven days till my leg went half numb. I've been there. So, don't ... don't tell me what about it?
Don't worry. They will be.
We can hold him for manslaughter.
You're going 80 miles an hour in second gear. Let's just slow down, all right?
They said they performed the heimlich, right?
Well, if they performed the heimlich, there'd be evidence of trauma. 
Not even a fracture.
No, it's two deltas. Greek letters. She's a delt.
Jill, we need to ask you a question. Is this your signature?
We don't know yet. That's what we're trying to find out. How well did you know James?
Who's your boyfriend?
Yeah, fibers liver-anything to implicate these guys.
The murder weapon. Dingle-dangle.
Matt, I got to know. How much did it tick Kyle off?
Jill.  Man, Kyle must've been steamed. His girlfriend signs a pledge's privates?
Hey, Matt you know why I joined a fraternity? 'Cause I wanted to belong to something -- the brotherhood. That's what it was all about for me you know what I mean? So, I'm going to cut to the chase here, bud. You come clean, you might be able to save your house ... save the brotherhood, but ... if you don't ... 
Everything you're trying to protect you'll destroy. Matty, I found the string. Now are you ready to tell us what happened after James got back to that house?
Your boy rolled over on you, slick.
Oh, yeah. They gonna love you.
Here I am.
I got it. Man, check out all that blood spatter.
What did you find out?
You don't seem too bummed about it.
Mm-hmm. Then there's only one thing left to do. 
String it.
Blood spatter on northwest wall. Blood sprays northeast corner above ...
No, I'm not confused. X marks the spot. A blow here ... here ... and here. Our dean received the majority of blows when he was on the ground.
Mm-hmm.
The blood spatter has a void instead of one continuous line of spray.
Which means our assailant was here and ... there was somebody else in this room.
Look, homicide will give us her name if you won't. There are detectives, and your school's not that big.
We're forensic scientists, Julia. Blood talks to us. People exaggerate or forget. Blood's like my grandfather. Never lies.
No, I just strung it.  No, the computer gizmo does all the geometry. 
You factor in the location of the body in relation to the blood on the wall in order to recreate the event. Each hit that drew blood gets its own unique color as he fell. See?
So how could your friend Kate, who's roughly half his size, wrestle him to the ground and keep him there while she bludgeoned him to death? Without help?
Hmm.
That's not enough. It's not enough. What's the one thing we're missing?
What's it?
The blood.
Oh, yeah. You don't even have to know every star and you can draw a constellation.
And fill in the rest. Whoa, look at that last finger there.
We'll have to ask our ladies, but I can tell you this -- somebody's playing through the pain.
It heals a lot faster when you wear one of these.
You held him down ... while she killed him.
For all forensic purposes, it is over. They're going to eat bread and bang a metal cup against some bars. That's it. It's over for us.
It's not our job to know why. It's our job to know how. You heard Grissom. The more the 'why', the less the 'how', the less the 'how', the more the 'why'.
Yeah?
Hmm. You got your why. Crime of passion.
I guess they didn't feel like they had a choice.
Okay, I'm ready up here. 
Can you confirm it's human?
There's got to be an easier way.
Ten bucks says the owner sells the house.
She?
I know all I need to know. I figure she was killed before her cement bath.
She was stabbed at least a dozen times -- a screwdriver, maybe ... like... a spike.
Well, stabbings are personal. She knew her attacker.
You brought the foundation of the house to our lab.
I pulled the permits. Summercliff was built five years ago on nothing but desert.
House was sold subsequent to completion, so the homeowner isn't a suspect. Homicide is running a missing persons check.
I think our killer was counting on that.
Here you go.
Yeah. Yeah, okay, I'll do that.
Grissom. Hey, doc. Hotline's lit up. Five callers all I.D.'D the same woman -- Fay Green -- and her mother just confirmed.
I don't care about the ocean, just the sand in my skeleton. Can you pinpoint a beach?
Why don't you ask him yourself?
Could the particles be sediment from the concrete where we found her?
What does that mean?
Now, let's go.
Hi.
Thank you.
Thanks.
Guess where Jason Hendler was employed five years ago.
Close. A subcontractor. How did you know?
I'll meet you outside. Hi, Teri.
It's luminol, sir. It dries quickly.
Why use the Alternate Light Source if the luminol didn't pick up anything?
Who lacquers maple unless they're trying to hide something?
And you painted the floors, covered your tracks for what, aesthetic reasons?
Officer, would you please arrest Mr. Hendler?
I'll get to work.
Mrs. Hendler, do you and your husband do much rock climbing?
Mrs. Hendler, I'm a good listener.  You got to give me the gun.
No, wait.
Wait!
Yeah.
I'll take the back. Warrick, you get the front?
This kid should be out playing Pop Warner.
How do you know it's fresh?
.
And I bet he dropped the bidi I found in the back on the way out.
Yeah. Those hand-rolled cigarettes? Probably a teenager. They're always taking shortcuts.
Hmm?
Yeah. It's cool. I'll see you back at the lab.
The bidi? DNA's still processing but Tina said nobody in the family smoked.
Well, it's just like a cigarette.
There's no smoking in here.
And I'm not your dude. This ain't a movie and Sharon Stone's fine. Let's go. 
Matches?
Ha-ha-ha! Houston, we have liftoff.
You see how each half of the match lines up?
Ah ... who broke the case?
Ecklie?
We got them both. I don't much care why they did it.
See you, Cath. 
Normal would be nice.
Oh! Warrick: Throw the flag, ref! NICK: Uncatchable, bro.
Is it true?
You're going down, bro.
Call came in blind. You see who could have made it?
I'm thinking DUI.
I'm calling that beer bottle.
It's still cold. Foam in the bottle. Take it up top?
The skid start way up the road. I got him doing at least 70.
These grooves are from the car's frame. It balanced before it fell. 
This is where he bailed. Wide spacing, slipping of the heel. He ran.
The phantom driver.
I don't know. That's why we're up here. But he left his buddy hanging out to dry. I can tell you that.
Driver ran to this point, car picks him up. Here are your tracks ... probably took him to the hospital.
You care to back that statement up? My phantom driver against your criminal?
Fifty.
Mr. Backseat going to make it?
He well enough to talk?
All right, all right, I get the picture. How long until we can see him?
Check his personal effects. 
That's it?
To what, a deuce?
You bet.
Hey, man, this is war.
Minor setback. How about the 911 call?
Good.
Car was rented from the airport three days ago.
Walter Banglor. I figure Vegas vacation; side trip to Hoover Dam.
Mm-hmm.
No.
No, he travels light. There was only a change of clothes in the damn suitcase.
All right, the fumes have settled. Give me a hand.
You can run ... but you can't hide.
Give me the good news.
It's a big list.
Let me see. 
I have no idea.
Possibly a cop from Philly. Or a ... a nurse from Omaha. Don't forget the mail carrier from Nashville. 
Well, this is going nowhere.
No, no, no, no. We're still on. I may be stalled, but I'm not out.
You want to take it to three? 
You still think he was robbed?
He lays in wait, he robs him, he tries to kill him, but he lets him buckle in?
What about the blue dust, Warrick?
Don't you think it matters?
Okay, like?
I hate you.
Hey, partner, you get a match yet? Ooh! Converse all-star.
And you needed all the books for that? 
Those soles have been around 20 years.
You look tired, buddy. You want me to make you a bottle, go nigh-nigh?
You should have worked the tire tracks. Jimmy in trace put together a digital catalog of treads ... has thousands on file. Took me three minutes.
And standard on your alleged getaway vehicle ... the '99 Bentley Arnage, red label. It's a sweet ride, man -- handcrafted. So, how many people in Vegas you think drive that kind of price tag?
Oh-ho! So sweet!
Well, I wish Banglor's rental car company were as considerate as your thief.
That's right.
Something to compare our mystery blue dust to.
We don't bet on cases.
Banglor's shooting stick with the phantom driver ... tosses a few back ... piles into the rental ... ...I-93, Hoover Dam. But don't drink and drive. You might spill your drink ... car skids ... bangs into the railing ... 
... see-saws ...
... on the edge ... what does the driver do? Man, he bails. He leaves Banglor in the back seat to take the fall. 
Literally.
Fingerprints, grooves, footprints: All the bases are covered. Victim, suspect, crime scene. Like a laxative ... 
It works.
You know, I hate to admit it ... but I like your theory. It does work.
So, what do you think? Can two solid theories, each backed by evidence both be correct?
That's all we'll need.
Hey, hey. How are you feeling, Mr. Banglor?
I'm going to come right out and say it. What happened to you is not right. The person responsible needs to be brought to justice. You tell me who that person is. Who was driving that car?
I'm Nick Stokes. This is Warrick Brown. We're with criminalistics. We've been working your accident.
You climbed in the back seat yourself?
Glad we could help.
Well, the only thing we didn't factor in was his will to live.
No loser. 
406. Burglary. Double or nothing?
What about the passengers in coach? They see anything?
So, more than one guy?  What do you think, Gris?
Is that a meat thermometer?
Guy should be colder than that. Body temperature drops two degrees in the first hour after death then one and a half degrees for each successive hour.
That would make his temperature at the time of death ... 101.6.
Looks like the heel of a boot.
Well, this guy's a study in contradictions. 
He's got defensive wounds on his palms but the scrapes on his knuckles and the broken hand indicate aggression.
What have you got?
What about prints?
Hey. Are you losing your touch there, Einstein?
Coroner's photos of the dead guy's back. Multiple horseshoe-shaped bruises. Those are definitely shoeprints.
CSI-3 seniority, sweetie.
If I'm Max, I want no part of this.
Plus, I don't have an aisle seat.
Right. Max gets up ...
... slides across Marlene. Excuse me, buttercup.
I come over confront the dead guy. Then what?  Who talked to 2F? To Max?
Oh, yeah.
This is when they really get scared.
Mine, too.
He tried to get away.
Whoa.
And you're okay with that? We processed evidence for twelve hours laid out the whole case and now those passengers are going to suck martinis and eat shrimp cocktails? Where's the justice?
Yeah. What else?
Their lives were threatened when Candlewell was at the emergency exit trying to open it, but the five feet between the exit and the aisles is what made the difference between self-defense and murder.
I don't know.
Catherine, you're a mother. You and Lindsey are on that plane. How far do you go?
Yeah, you're talking about a dog owner on heroin. How responsible can he be?
What's so different about this morning?
So ... why was the gate open?
Mm-mmm. 
No, thanks.
I don't know, man. Something back at that house must have bit me.
Yeah, this is the guy who told me to put hemorrhoid cream on my acne.
Yeah?
Something definitely two-legged went through it. Got mostly partials. Print lab's working on it now.
Mandy ... give me something dandy.
No. Came back: Walt Braun.
Oh, it's no worries. I got some cream.
All right. It's no big deal, really.
9:15 that morning.
About a half hour.
Who is this?
So ... ?
Ah -- I don't know, boss. I mean, ask yourself the question: Are doggie-door prints and chigger bites enough to get a man for murder?
But Tony changed his mind, which changed the will.
So, what's right in front of us that we're missing?
Where'd you find that?
I got one left. Smile.  Lovely.
Yeah, we're done here, brother.
Yeah, I just finished it.
You were late.
Yeah. Good luck.
Hey, Jim ... what do you make of that void? Nail?
Don't say that.
Then call him.
I didn't say anything.
You know how Grissom is. If you ask him for the keys to the car he's going to ask you if you've done your homework.
It's like a multiple choice question. You know? Go with your first choice.
Sack up.
You got to turn on your pager. I got Brass' daughter's car in the garage.
Hey, Vega says we won't be able to hold the suspect more than half an hour.
Guys ... 
Tire plug. That's a nail in sheep's clothing. 
Treads from the crime scene.
The void on the one-to-one matches the void on Ellie's left rear tire. Siamese twins.
Yeah.
Where's his daughter?
Check his weapon?
One shot?
What kind of cop doesn't empty his magazine? They're trained to shoot to kill.
Novice shooters get their hands pinched in the slide.
Hey, guys. I just pulled the manager out of a restaurant. Bob Fairmont was staying in room 2927. Catherine's parking the car.
Okay.
Murder Central?
Well, if I did, would I have asked the question?
Sara doesn't know what Murder Central means any more than I do.
What do you got?
What do you think, cocaine?
How can you tell just by looking?
Okay, we're done in the elevator. You guys need a hand?
Thanks a lot.
You are so busted.
Nice shot.  Reservoir's still wet.
Mmm. I'm only impressed if he aimed.
Not rocket science. Man's inside, woman's out.
His fingernails.
Who approved this cremation?
A heavy metal like selenium presents so rarely that it's 
No, sir, no, I'm not. I'm Nick Stokes. I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
Thank you, doctor. 
I was hoping I might be able to get a sample of that new kidney of yours.
Biopsy. A sliver.
Maybe an invasive scope. The only way I can get an accurate barometer of the poison in Mr. Fairmont's system is through one of his organs.
Hey, I understand. Thank you for your time.
I like your watch, man, that's cool.
Yeah, get it to a watch repair shop.  I hope you get to feeling better, Mr. Mercer.
Hey, Mr. Mercer. I got your message. You wanted to talk to me?
No. No, sir. ,I have found selenium in his office but... without actually knowing how much was in his system ... 
I'm sorry. 
I can't even talk Warrick into splitting a sandwich with me and this guy's willing to give us his kidney?
Yeah, that's my point. Carl Mercer risks dying sooner to help our investigation but who protects his rights?
Well, so do I. I want to retract our request. I don't think any investigation for the dead is worth hurting the living.
What?
What? Player was in the hotel cheating with his own wife?
Ms. Fairmont ... Ms. Fairmont, you feeling okay?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Yeah, yeah, let's sit down here in the car for a sec. 
There you go. Relax, relax, relax.
yeah, I need an ambulance. Uh, Vegas PD, west parking lot.
ER doc gave her a shot of hydropazeen ... sent her on her way.
Which means ... somebody's been poisoning our suspect.
Hey, Sara, got the warrant.
Yeah, But it doesn't stop the smell.
We'll find out.
Hey, Sara. Yeah. Sodium selenite-- selenium. 280 milligrams for a 180-pound man...
Yeah, well, it would have been murder for a 300-pound man.
Yeah, it contains polysorbate 80 and vitamin E. That combination's found in selenium supplements injected in animals.
Mostly livestock, grazers.
Well, it looks like a through and through. 
Hunting rifle. Winchester 70.
Four in the magazine, one in the chamber. All accounted for. This rifle was never fired.
When's hunting season?
No bullet in the body.
No bullet in the tree.
Catherine!
Yeah. But how am I going to get it out of there without damaging it.
Yeah, I'll figure it out.
Coroner said it's cut and dry. Bullet severed an abdominal artery.
Front to back. Straight across. Round entered one inch to the right of the umbilicus. Bullet's with ballistics. Vega's got the widow. They're ready for us.
Did he go by himself?
Can you think of any reason James wasn't wearing a safety vest?
Tell us about the bullet now. Striations, lands, grooves?
Oxidation takes a lot more than 24 hours.
Yeah, nothing we have says that it wasn't a hunting accident.
She was crying poverty when she was in the money?
We've got to find that bullet.
Yeah, and since the bullet didn't hit the tree, and the blood's to the west, then the through-and-through defines our search area. The furthest drop of blood is here ...  ... The spatter seems to be confined to a 45 degree angle.
Yeah, we've reduced a 360 degree crime scene to a 45 degree angle.
Yeah?
Well, he was out of work. Maybe he was trying to save money.
Whoa. Well, that's not worth the risk. Maybe he wasn't up here to hunt?
Right, right ... feeding time, it's ... when they're out in the open. What about other game?
Yeah, that's an odd time for a hunting accident.
Gunshot residue.
So now what? We're thinking murder?
He never fired his rifle. What'd he shoot himself with?
Yeah, not to mention whoever shot him would've been eyeball-to-eyeball. Who could've gotten that close without Mr. Jasper putting up a struggle?
Somebody he knew. I'm going to call O'Riley see if he's checked out Mrs. Jasper's alibi. I'll meet you at the car.
Hey, Sara.  Hey, how's your case going?
Yeah. Yeah, I know, it's impossible. But it's just a radiator cap so give yourself a break.
Hey, Sara ...  ... you gotta get out more.
Well, Mrs. Jasper's alibi checks out. She was at work from 2:00 A.M. To
Murder for hire?
This guy was shot in the gut. Bullet didn't even come close to his spinal cord. 
Wait a minute now. Abdominal injuries take time to bleed out. But it would've taken at least ten minutes for hemorrhagic shock to set in and he would've been mobile.
Yeah. Yeah, I see where you're going here. His injuries and his behavior aren't consistent with murder. But they're not consistent with suicide either.
Look, suicidals want it quick and painless. Bleeding to death is slow and painful. Not to mention, he never fired his rifle.
That-that's a big stretch. He brought his rifle plus a spare?
Yeah, but there's no blood trail. What'd he do with the spare, throw it up a tree?
Yeah. Yeah, okay-- heads up.
I just marked our search area.
You know, even if your theory's right, we still haven't explained the insurance policy purchased by the wife.
Hold up, let me give you a hand.
Yeah. I got it. I got it.
Whoa ... water pistol.
And the wife's out a million bucks.
Sure. Mrs. Jasper, when you claimed your husband's personal possessions, you signed a release form, yeah?
I ran that same form through our questionable documents lab and I cross-checked your signature with the signature on the insurance application here. It's not yours. Your husband must've forged it. I also checked with the insurance company. Your husband opened the account.
Yes, ma'am.
We work together; he can't outsmart all five of us.
Contained quarters first.
What is that, that whir sound?
Oh, yeah. Willie Hank's Don't Pay the Ransom. I'll contact the local country and western stations get a time and tape on when the song aired. Establish a timeline. What else?
Mm-hmm.
From what, a blown speaker?
Pulling all of the sound bottom right. Now if that were true the victim may have been sitting in the passenger seat.
Millander was driving.
He was killed in the warehouse -- and don't sneak up on a person like that.
He saw his dad killed when he was a kid over some money dispute. Ends up killing guys himself.
Check that out. Eight digit number with a dash.
Well, whatever it is it happened during the summer. Paper only burns itself into plastic in high levels of heat.
Something you didn't want. Or something you had to keep.
Pow-wow.
Later.
I put a call into three area country and western stations. Got the FCC list ... during the time of the victim's suicide recording KWV had Willie Hank's Don't Pay the Ransom playing from 1:47 A.M. To 1:51 A.M.
5:13 A.M. So that's about a three hour window. He was racing daylight.
Made the recording in the car killed him in the warehouse.
Yeah?
Speeding ticket? How long ago?
Summer.
909987-23...
Walker's birth date's on the ticket. August 17, 1957.
What about his driving record, Jim?
There's a few tickets.
Catherine wouldn't have left her stuff behind.
We wait. Right?
Catherine didn't say anything?
Kidnapping?
I'll call Brass.
I knew.
Hi.
How about if we just have a look around?
Wife was way too cool to have seen a severed finger. I don't think so.
Townhouse off Flamingo. Under the company name, not rented.
I'll get a warrant. See if anybody's missing a finger over there.
Hey.
Criminalistics. Anybody home?
Okay ... talk to me.
Too bad you can't talk. Maybe you could tell me where she is.
Good to see you again. Yeah, somebody hit the table. There's obvious signs of a struggle.
Blood pool here. Spatter all the way to the bird. Birds have blood feathers and flight feathers. Flight feathers don't bleed. No capillaries, just cartilage.
Discovery channel.
There's no blood trail from here to the door, so my guess is he wrapped her in something.
Checked. Bed's still made. Linen closet's full. Not to mention, a wet sheet leaks.
Why wash the knives and leave the wine glasses?
Yeah, looks like someone ripped the liner out.
Must've gotten dumped when she did.
Yeah?
No, man, I hate the stuff.
Mrs. Logan scolded her son for eating in the car. Peanut butter and jelly. Said her husband just had the car detailed.
Come on. 
You know that treating the surface with a carpet cleaner only pushes the dirt further down?
Warrick, you got those box cutters?
Did I mention how much I hate peanut butter?
Now he really has a problem. 
Why make the map? Why lead Catherine to the body?
Besides, there's always fingerprints.
Yeah, and he's probably long gone by now.
Why does that not surprise me?
Man, something stinks in here again.
Worse. It's all over my sandwich. Smell that.
You're kidding me?
Man, someone has got to talk to Grissom about this.
You leaving your experiments in our refrigerator.
Well ... 
That blood is rank, man.
I told him, he just ... doesn't hear it.
Sorry I'm late. D.A. Wanted an update on my robbery case.
The desk is crispy.
Defies the laws of physics. Fire's drawn to fire. Well, you know what we gotta do.
The guy who started the fire wanted to make sure the bedroom got it worse.
Well, according to Sara, 94% of all arsonists are male.
The fire burned longest here.
Yeah, right here. 
Could have burned off. Fabric would have fueled it.
Yeah, unless it was chasing after an accelerant. 
Warrick ... is that blood?
This fire is just a cover up.
Hey. Yeah, Warrick said the fire was orange so low-temperature fuel. Something accessible ... gasoline, kerosene ... I thought you were at the post.
So, anyway, this is where the fire started. Victim's bedroom.
Grissom ... Gris ...
Sometimes, I hate this job.
Well, our photo guys tell me those pictures were taken with Mike Kimble's type of camera.
Yeah. What are you doing here?
What is that? There at the bottom right corner? Is that a finger?
Well, that's unusual, isn't it? A professional photographer gets a finger in the shot?
I'll ... I'll see you later.
We've got some samples coming in. They're priority one.
Give me that. 
How'd we miss that?
All right, hold on. You mind if I talk to Jake alone?
I have a hunch.
Everyone does it, Jake. You just ... feel like you're the only one. Then when you don't do it, it happens in your sleep anyway, right? Yeah. And then you go to take a leak, dust off the equipment and just grab the first thing that's handy, huh?
Your sister's nightgown?
Yeah, that's rough. Rough. Well, listen, in the future, dude ... even if the situation's embarrassing, the truth's probably the best policy there.
Hey, listen, you ever notice your mom's boyfriend acting weird around your sister? Like a little, uh ... too friendly, too forward?
Really?
How?
Mm. Mm-hmm. You like the guy?
Hey.
You get anywhere with those fingerprints?
No.
What is it? A clock, a mirror? It's got a latch, a lock. A porthole? ... It's a porthole?
Easy come, easy go.
Lead the way.
Tiny scrubbing bubbles.
Had an interesting diet. Cowhide.
Yup.
Your waitress say anything about a needle butane torch, that sort of thing?
What do you think? Our guy having a little party with the waitress?
Well, somebody was here ... grabbed the stuff took their glass. 
Bet the contact wasn't his.
Whoa, miss.
Why don't you just catch us up there, boss?
Come on, Greg.
China white? You sure?
West coast heroin is MEXICAN BROWN. 20, 30% pure, tops. What's china white, 75%?
Doesn't make any sense, man. The money from dealing heroin comes from the cutting. The more you cut, the more money you make. There's no profit margin in selling stuff that's too pure.
Sure you don't want to start in the dressing room?
Hey, just 'cause I've been on a personal losing streak with the ladies doesn't mean you should be, too.
I'm talking about chicks, not gambling.
Mind if I go for her, then?
Warrick.
It's still yours.
I've got twins here, Bill -- one set of prints from your work card; another set from the drug paraphernalia we found in the dumpster.
Yeah, but you got him the gig. You didn't know he was a junkie?
Yeah, okay.
Hey, one more thing, Bill. You wear contacts?
How's that working out for you?
Hey, Sara. If you come up here on your nights off, people are going to start confusing the two of you.
What's up?
Marquis Mecke Froede.
The coasters test positive for heroin. 
He wasn't the only one with two coasters, man.
Remember when we talked to Lillie about the scarf?
She had a drink with two coasters.
Did you not hear me? She might be involved. You got to walk away from this fast.
And we will. What about her?
Then handle it.
You're nearsighted? I bet this is going to match the contact lens we found at the crime scene. Let me ask you another question. Why deal 91% pure china white? Did you have a beef with the victim, or what?
You're going to have to do better than that. You intentionally sold him stuff that was too pure.
Hey, do yourself a favor, slick. If you don't know enough about something, stay out of it.
You want to talk about it?
Okay.
Obviously.
I'm playing cards ... with my friend.
Paramedics just pronounced. Four dead, no witnesses. Coroner's on his way. Guy in the robe flagged down an officer.
Yeah? Well ... 
He's a quiet monk. Non-native, from Thailand.
Stippling around entry.
Close range. Looks like they were shot one at a time. How do you get one vic -- let alone four-- to sit still while you put a bullet between their eyes?
Yeah, for mercy. 
Interesting reading for a man of the cloth. That monk had it in the bottom of his desk drawer.  And he was the guy handling the money. You hide one thing from your brothers, then maybe he was hiding more.
Yeah, I'm just ... talking it out, Sara. What'd you find?
No, no, or read p0rn or commit murder.
Hey, whatever. Outside, inside. Why shoot four people, then leave the murder weapon behind the temple where even a blind man could find it?
Bobby D. Shot the test bullet through the rifle you found behind the temple. It's on the right.
Bullet from vic number three on the left. Lans and grooves align perfectly.
Well, we've got more than that. Sara and I found prints off the rifle.
Well, I'll give you a hint. He's bald, he wears a robe and he likes his coeds bodacious.
And a whole lot of bad karma.
Tampering with evidence is against the law.
Maybe, but a crime had been committed there.
Yeah, right.
Placa was carved into the panel with a straight-edged blade. Nondescript. Not much to work with. What's unusual is the placa itself.
Yeah, but after those German tourists were killed the Snakebacks were pretty much wiped out. The cops really came down hard on those guys. Twenty-seven members were put away for ... for murder and weapons possession, drugs, you name it. According to the gang unit, they've been out of business about a year.
Hmm?
Not a gang member, uh ... wannabe?
False clue.
Air Force?
Why?
Did you get his picture from outer space?
Hi there.
Yeah, I'm Nick Stokes. This is Gil Grissom. We're with the Vegas crime lab.
No, thanks. We're here about the murders at the Buddhist temple off crystal peak drive.
Sir, your vehicle was seen in the driveway of the temple around the time of the murders.
Good, we should go after him, then, 'cause the sandwich man's going to walk. His alibi checks out -- he was in Laughlin with his wife at a farmers market.
Took the van.
Yeah. Teenage kid, no parents, keys to a ride. I'm all over him.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Knock it off!
Come on over here, Rambo.
Wow! One pop to the chest and you're out. You got off easy.
Yeah. Not yet.
You the only trauma doc?
Yeah, mine, too. 
Only one on a tour bus required to wear one. Thank you.
Whoa, what are you doing here, Greg?
You're taking my notes. You didn't bring a warmer jacket?
How long after your scheduled stop in Barstow?
I understand that, Mr. Draper, but how long after that did the wheel start to shake on you?
Sir, are you okay? 
Hold on, hold on. Wait a second. Mr. Draper ... 
Mr. Draper, have you had anything to drink tonight?  Keep an eye on Mr. Draper, will you, for me? Mr. Draper, you sit tight.
Won't take a minute. I understand. I understand. Hang tight.
I understand. I want you to take a deep breath, and I want you to blow into the end of this for me, okay?
I need a doctor over here. Greg, get some help.
Greg!
Greg! Get some help!
It's all right, man. Stop apologizing.
That's why we have fielding training, Greg. No disrespect, but you're not qualified to be out here.
Yup. I remember my first time in the field. CSI One. Green as could be. Initial call was a robbery. I get there, triple homicide. Blood all over the place, mother and two kids.
You just do.
Okay, what's next?
What about the rest stop in Barstow 
I'll find out.
Well ... McBride's not on the bus.
Hey, Grissom. Cheap whiskey. Broken bottle. Brown paper bag. You know, I never gave the bus driver a breath test.
Seat 1C was the only seat with an unobstructed path through the windshield.
Laminated safety glass, pops in, pops out.
Hello, Mr. McBride.
You're telling me this guy wasn't intoxicated.
He could barely put a sentence together. If he wasn't drunk, then what was he?
On any medication?
Doesn't look like he was hitting the gym.
So, it's not the driver ... 
Bus company just faxed over a maintenance report. Bus was in perfect working order. Serviced last week.
Uh ... no.
A grade eight bolt shouldn't snap like a toothpick.
Yeah, I hit it with the tru-blue. It's not a grade eight. It's a grade five.
Okay. Driver hits the brakes, initiates the skid.
Another vehicle.
Man, there could be a million reasons.
Just this jacket so far. Passenger seat. And you?
Guy drives from L.A. Four and a half hours -- I got an idea.
Hand me that, uh, crowbar there, please. 
Thank you.
Ha. Bingo.  I always take mine out. Pain in the ass.
Yeah.
Wait. I've seen her.
Yeah. Yeah, I've seen her. She was in the accident.
Well, he didn't drive back to L.A.
He consented to lifesaving surgery, but ... signed a DNR.
Why chloroform?
How much later?
All right, to do what?
Bus logged into Barstow at 8:03 P.M. Target would be two hours later.
If not, it was sabotaged in L.A. And we've got another two hours and 13 minutes.
You know, if this guy Nolan ;worked for the bus company, his print on the wheel could be legit.
No.
Sure.
Hey, Catherine, I'll get that.
A little thick for a human hair.
Really?
I'll get it to the lab.
Why, what's under the bed?
No one's going to let me live that one down, are they?
Yeah? Well ... I'm short on options. Besides, the dry cleaners keeps losing my stuff.
Grocery bag with a red smudge.
You're kidding me, right?
I thought I got my hands on all those departmental newsletters. Where'd you get those?
Yeah, that figures. All right, listen, Grissom wants us to divide and conquer. Blond hair for you, Warrick.
Sara, you're on phone records.
Yes, you are.
Greg. Come here. I want to talk to you for a sec. 
Come on.
Stop invading my privacy, man, I don't like it. I'm just trying to do my job around here. I don't need the extra attention.
I didn't do anything, man. Someone from the community wrote a letter of commendation. Public affairs ran it. Cool?
Plastic bag from the crime scene. I'm trying to get lucky -- see if I can get some prints off it.
Horndog? It's a blast from the past.
She said that she was cleaning out the attic one day stumbled upon them thought she'd send them to me for a laugh.
No. She lives in Bosnia, man. Maine or something. She's got three kids. What's she going to do, fly in for murder?
I don't know. Something in my gut tells me it isn't right. Hey, what if somebody from work tapped into my e-mail?
Yeah. Maybe I forgot to log off one day.
No. I'm serious. Somebody had to have read my e-mail.
I already did.
Luna Cable. Good company, same as mine. One hundred fifty channels. I'm telling you, you got to get it, man. The last three weeks have been heaven.
Mr. Crane?
Nick Stokes, Criminalistics.
Mr. Crane, your door's open. Just want to ... ask you a couple questions.
The gloves, you find them?
Of what?
Who is it?
It's almost one in the morning. What do you want?
Yeah, maybe but look ...
I can't just let you in my...
Hey, hold up.
Sir ...
Sir. Sir ... You're going to have to leave.
Get out of here.
You saw my address?
I don't know.
Just ...  Hello?
Who?
Yeah, well, I'm not alone.
Your psychic's here.
Mr. Pearson.  Mr. Pearson. Mr. Pearson ...
Mr. Pearson, you back here?
Cops are on their way.
You wearing my clothes?
You know what? I'm a little confused here myself. Uh, why don't you refresh my memory. When did we meet?
You installed my cable.
Like you watched Jane Galloway?
A gift?
Yeah.
You watch me sleep?
No, no, it's, uh ... it's not my job. You should know that. It's the coroner's gig.
No.
Hey, now, Nigel, now we got a D.B. here, huh? You're going to help me with the crime scene, right?
Yeah.
You know I don't want to disappoint you, Nigel, but this isn't the first time I've had a gun in my face.
How do you want this to end, Nigel?
Yeah.
Why me?
It's not over for me. It's over for Jane Galloway.
Well, I'll take prints over people any day.
Okay.
Mm-hmm... I'm interested in any camera that covers Paige Rycoff's room.
Now, go back four days, one hour window 8:00 to 9:00 P.M.
Fast forward.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa -- hold on.
How'd you miss that?
Go back 15 seconds, replay in slow-mo.
Camera captures 13% more than we're seeing on this monitor. Picture condenses to fit the aspect ratio ... 
Mm-hmm. Show me the under scan. Stop.  Freeze and magnify.
Looks like he pushed off the wall ... tossed something on the lens. Prints over people. Thanks, man.
Knew where to look. How about you? 
We shoot, we score.
Hello. Got an ID off my print. I know who covered the cameras.
Hey, your fingerprints say so.
Why the fourth floor?
So what?
She dumped you. 
From hot to cold in a minute.
There's our boys about to move their borrowed furniture.
Okay, I think the table's set. Cab double-parked.
And he becomes the world's most patient cabbie.
13 minutes. 27 seconds According to the timecode. Close enough.  Let's get back out in the field. Tech can finish up here.
I'll, uh, settle in.
You know, that car circled the block six times between... 8:20 and 8:40 P.M?
You're up to no good.
You know, it's easier to get a master's degree than a parking spot on campus.
Right.
Yeah?
I know -- check the trunk.
Registered to Robert Woodbury, Philosophy Professor, tenured. Detail's almost got the latch.
Means hairs were ripped at the root.
She was in his car. It gets us closer to our suspect.
Hey, I think I got something here. Check this out. The whole dumpster's beat to hell. This one spot's fresh.
Possibly a hit-and-run? Means the vehicle had a high ground clearance. Maybe an SUV?
Still, why was Paige even down here?
There's two coats of primer between each paint job. Quality work -- probably a dealership.
Really?
Cherokee, '89 or '90. Three paint jobs, all factory stock. Stone white, flame red and there's your midnight black there.
Done. An hour ago. 
Hey. Brass just called. He's down at P.D. Paint to car; car to driver. Suspect's down there -- he's looking for you.
Your guy didn't hit Paige.
Or her husband.
Here we go.
I predict I'll still be standing here one minute from now.
You're thinking she accidentally dropped it down the chute. Then how did she end up in the dumpster?
Oh. Please.
Fatalities?
Yeah, I'll take the rig.
Check out this displacement. Detritus blew backwards. 
Right into the driver.
That's intentional.
So ... assuming Mrs. Tobin was the intended target the bomber knew what he was doing.
Another spring.
I do now.
Hmm ... hello, sweetheart.
Pipe bomb.
End cap at both ends. Either one could have come in contact with the explosive inside the pipe. I'll swab it see if trace can identify it.
A grommet? Inside a pipe bomb?
Yet the grommet's fully intact. How did it survive the blast?
And just when I thought you knew everything.
Hey. Pieces are small, but it's coming together.
Jonathan Claddon?
I'm Nick Stokes. This is Sara Sidle. We're with the Vegas Crime Lab. We're here about your wife's car.
So, I take that as a yes?
Will do.
You, uh ... you don't think too much of him, huh?
Get ... 
C-3 ... H-5 ... and three molecules of NO-3... nitroglycerin. The explosive component of dynamite.
Thanks, Greg. What'd I win?
Hey.
Well, you look ... 
Smug, actually.
Nice. I got the type of explosive used in the pipe bomb. Dynamite -- nitro and sawdust. The same kind used at Tobin C &amp; D.
Hey, if I were you I'd worry about my fingerprint. How'd it get there?
So, you're telling us someone broke into your vehicle and stole a single stick of dynamite?
Bomber fastened the cap to the pipe leaving behind tool marks. Check it out.
A vice grip.
Yeah. Let's get a warrant for Johnny Claddon's home and for Tobin C &amp; D.
Yeah, didn't even have to wait for my warrant. I just rolled over to Tobin C &amp; D and before I could say vice grip the senior foreman gave me every grip in the house.
Bad news, though. No matches.
No. And we're out of vice grips. 
Let's unwrap the Beemer.
You know, when I was 16, I begged my mom for a car. Swore she'd come through.
Encyclopedia Britannica.
All 24 volumes. Still own them, still use them. Okay.
Mechanic found the bomb next to the engine mount closest point to the driver. Bomb was on a delay. Clock with a ticking second hand and a nail driven into 12.
Question is, what started the clock?
Yeah, but we're only dealing with a 60-second time frame.
Mechanic offers to take a look.
Hood release.
Whoa. The latch has been blown apart. Which means the hood was down when the bomb was detonated.
X-ray vision? 
Sara, if you found a bomb in your car would you close the hood?
No way. BMW has built-in hood shocks.
No prints.
Well, if you were pawing all over the hood then your prints should be on it.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
You got any clay?
Well... we can't just take the tool without a warrant.
Cheese. Nice.
I'll compare this with our case toolmark.
A blast. Hey, man ... these yours?
Boy, you just have an answer for everything, don't you?
Striae are identical. Auto body vice grip was definitely used to tighten the end cap. Mechanic's prints on file?
Hmmm. Then what are you running?
Oh. Shot in the dark.
Really? Because we found your prints on a tool at the body shop. It was the same tool we know was used to make the pipe bomb.
Fortunately for you, you only worked Thursday nights, because your little plan took a lot of extra time and effort.
You snagged a stick of dynamite out of Johnny's SUV, took an end cap out of inventory, knowing we'd trace it back to Johnny if we found it. And then at the body shop, you put it all together.
Really? You sure about that?
You needed Marcus' help to wire the bomb and substantiate your story. So the two of you paid him $50,000 for services rendered.
So, you're both looking at, what, uh ... twenty-plus.
Lockwood.
Who called it in?
He see anyone else in the vicinity?
No tire treads. Whose are these?
Engagement ring, no wedding band.
Orbital bone looks fractured.
Could've. Hold that for me?
Down feather.
Shine that right here.
Grissom should enjoy this. Hey, Lockwood you got any food in your vehicle? Hamburger, anything like that?
No, gum'll kill him. I'll stop at the first place I see pick up some jerky. 
Will you get me a sample of the ground underneath the body?
Good.
This is the girl I found in the desert.
It's not possible, Dave-O. She was found in Diablo Canyon -- miles from the nearest water source. Lake Mead's got to be 20 miles away.
Dry-drowned?
She doesn't. She was engaged. The guy never filed a missing persons on her.
Okay. You mind if I have a look around?
Thanks.
Detective. 
Check that out. You see that?
Stacy had a head trauma wound. You wouldn't know anything about that either, would you?
No? How do you explain the domestic disturbance call to this address two weeks ago?
I don't know ... the neighbor who filed the complaint said you were really yelling at Stacy. Said it sounded abusive.
No. No. We got what we need.
How'd it go?
Yeah, the problem is the small amount of blood found in her own home isn't enough to prove anything, you know? People bump their heads and scrape their knees all the time.
That musclehead boyfriend --he's a little shady. He's hiding something. I can feel it.
Four samples: One from their swimming pool one from their bathroom, one from Lake Mead and one from Clark County Reservoir but none are consistent with the water I recovered from her stomach. 
Some rocks from under her body and a goose feather. 
The desert, yeah.
Really?
You sure?
Hey, that helps. I think I'm going to head out there. You want to roll? 
You're on call at court, right.
If it was a little kid or a mass casualty maybe we'd get that kind of manpower but hey, exercise is good for us, right?
Let's go.
Yeah, several layers, tempered cotton. This is a men's extra large. This is too big for her. Goose down like I found on her body. What's this? 
Ah. Property of Mr. Muscles.
Well, maybe he left a day later than he said for his little marathon, you know? Followed her out here, started arguing with her no neighbors around to call the cops.
She manages to fight her way free finds higher ground, he follows her, takes her down. 
You should try describing a scuba diver up in a tree, man. This is nothing. No, the evidence tells a story.
Everybody thinks they have a plan till things start to go wrong.
Then help us out here, man. I've got prior disturbance calls, her blood in the pool, her body drowned in the middle of the desert with your jacket nearby ... your map.
No. No, it's evidence now. You can put a request in for it when we complete our investigation, okay?
I'm getting this to QD. He doesn't want me to have this map and I want to know why.
Sounds good, man. Thanks, man.
Hey, Grissom ... 
Keep me posted.
Did you take a look at that maggot from e desert yet?
And?
You mind taking another look for me?
Why?
So, my maggot was stunted?
Yeah, but we found the vic in the desert.
Muchas gracias.
Come on in, Greg.
Hey.
News travels fast.
I'm trying to calculate barometric pressures here, G.
Yeah, yeah, I see where you're going. Last week in Vegas -- perfect weather. Warm, steady barometric pressure, but ... out in Diablo, two days before I found Stacy Warner's body ... 
Right.
Right. Humidity spikes up. Moisture in the air condenses.
I checked with the national weather service. This area got three inches of rain in 20 minutes the night Stacy died. 
Got nasty in a hurry. Nothing she could really do about it.
But it was too late. She drowns in the floodwater. Body gets carried to the base of the canyon. 
No evidence of the storm anywhere except on the vic who carried traced amounts of basalt rock with her and rainwater in her throat.
Stokes.
You sure about that?
I need you to get those results to me.
An accident of nature, yeah. But you still had a hand in her death just the same, didn't you, Mr. Hudson?
Why don't you take a break. Come on over here for a sec. 
You altered the map. You used the same color ink as the printer but the chemical tags in the ink are different. This is magic marker. 
And when you shine ultraviolet light on it like this ... 
... you can see exactly what you did. You made this look like an impenetrable ridge -- no way out, when it's actually a meadow.
Then why did you alter the map?
What you did isn't a crime ... but it is criminal, isn't it?
Yeah, I'll be above you.
Mm-hmm?
Well, if it's the same thing as a frat party yeah, lots of them. You know, you get enough booze going things can get pretty wild.
Multiple-partner wild. And it'd be no big deal to have two, maybe three girls at once, just ...
Hit on the rock glass. Work card. Orpheus hotel. Tiffany Langer.
Showgirl.
Was there anybody there you didn't know?
Do you know where he is?
So ... your date stayed at the party after you left?
Where does he live?
Why don't you give us his name.
You said he kind of looked like Ricky Martin, right?
Yeah, that's the problem with eyewitnesses. All the more reason to rely on evidence. Tell Warrick hey. Let me know if anything breaks.
Thanks. 
No. Nothing.
You, uh, you sure this is the vic's?
Ooh, pretty girl.
Listen to this: Babe, he's not good enough for you. He doesn't have the history we do. You mean the world to me. I know you'll live to regret this decision.
Hey!
Where's he going?
C'mon.
Well, it looks like lover boy isn't home.
I don't know, man. We don't even have a warrant.
What did you find?
That's Ashleigh James.
Yeah, we got a match, too, but it's not the vic's.
Someone forgot to clean these, too, for a long time. Positive for blood all over the place.
Hey, man. What you eatin'?
That stuff will kill you, you know.
And?
Ashleigh?
You feel like crap, blame your face.
So, we're not really talking about looks. We're talking about survival of the species?
Bad fat?
Evo'd?
Yeah, he destroyed Frank's vision of her.
But wait, that still doesn't answer how Ashleigh ended up in a shopping cart by the freeway.
Was he home alone?
Privilege doesn't extend post-mortem.
Why don't you ... just tell us what happened.
I take it this wasn't his first convulsion.
Catherine, we need to get a tape-lift here, please.
Mrs. Buckley? I'm Nick Stokes. I'm from the crime lab. I've been assigned to your son's case.
It's protocol.
I understand.
Sure.
I'm sorry for your loss.
Cause of death?
Injuries consistent with a grand mal seizure?
He's covered in bruises. Possibly from being thrashed during the seizure?
I found tan fibers on his boxers.
Fibers on his body and his underwear but not on his shirt and pants, why?
Okay, then at some point he was with his Shrink in his underwear.
Goat ... sweaters?
Angora is processed goat hair?
Must be a chick thing.
Hey, Catherine.
You ever been in therapy?
And you were okay sharing your problems with a complete stranger?
Yeah.
I hope it's a general.
What do you mean, we're lucky? We've got fibers on a 14-year-old kid and the shrink's clothing.
s*x with a minor. Suspension's a joke. Should have lost her license, minimum. 
Then maybe you should wait outside.
That's the funny thing about choices. Once you make them you have to live with them.
Dylan Buckley was just a boy. He trusted you and you abused that trust.
Was that blanket here ... on the floor?
He was a 14-year-old kid. What's the matter with you?
That's not what your rap sheet says.
We got what we came here for.
I'm on a case.
Right.
Okay. Thank you, David.
I'm thorough.
... but Dylan Buckley's levels were normal. I just got my own copy of the report. Dr. Sapien lied.
All I can remember doing afterwards is sitting in my room in the dark, staring at the door waiting for my mom to get home. But I've never told anyone before.
It's what makes a person, I guess.
I'm sorry, Catherine.
Come on, Greg, I thought you liked a challenge. What are we looking at here?
Father's dead, means we're looking at mom.
Doc? The kid in his underwear ... Tell us about the Y-incision. 
Mm-hmm. Head-to-toe.
He was in his underwear wrapped in a blanket fighting for every breath.
That's what every parent says.
Re-Birthing?
So, then what happened? Things got out of hand? He changed his mind?
So much for your ... therapy.
Excuse me.
Okay! There he is. Let's get down there.
Ready?
Stokes! Sidle! Crime Lab. Did you open the bag?
He-he. Nothing like flirting over a D.B.
You want to airlift the body to the coroner's. We'll radio ahead.
Let's see what metal shows up. 
Well, there's no gun on our dead body. 
What's that? There. About four inches long. What is that? 
Well, it wasn't from lack of trying.
Gambling chip.
Jacket. Government Issue, Army.
Human ... soup. Well, we are 73.5% liquid, eh, Dave?
What if we find the family or they find us?
Not for our investigation.
Yeah, in a zip bag.
Hmm.
Hey, how's Liquid Man doing?
You know, Sara, a lot of homeless guys get these army jackets cheap at salvage stores.
Okay. 
Ugh...
I don't know. I can't read an address or a phone number ...
About what?
You're going to need more than one.
Shut up. She was not.
Really?
Catherine?
No, no. You were the kind that guys fall all over themselves trying to impress.
Me? I was, uh ... I was dependable.
Mm-Hmm ..
No. Never a strap, never a smoker. Just all-around dependable guy, I guess.
I was popular with the right people, I can tell you that. I can also tell you what I wasn't. I wasn't a mac daddy wannabe with a Members Only jacket, putting his swerve on all the ladies.
Good.
You changed ...  But you still smell.
Let's go!
... Human fat never dries out, it just gets waxy.
I have. Nightclub for boomers off the strip.  Thanks, man.
Yeah?
Okay. Come with us.
Are you sure you haven't seen him around here? Wore an army jacket, might've been down on his luck?
Moses? 
You didn't maybe zip him up in a bag because he was giving you trouble ... anything like that?
Can I see your right hand, sir?
Hey ... treating another human being like garbage is not a job. It's a choice.
Rest in peace, Lieutenant. Rest in peace.
Zero humidity, record highs. 'Tis the season.
Wow.
He couldn't have climbed up there with all that crap on.
Well, you know ... Lake Mead is just over the hill and the copters are dropping water.
Okay.
After today ... oh, yeah.
What do you make of that void? Green vegetation.
Except for that one spot.
Well, well ... downed power line, huh?
Matchbook time-delay device.
That's the only reason I carry this stuff.
The difference between walking and running. Guy lights a cigarette, sticks it in a matchbook takes a stroll.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, he was dumped all right ... out of a chopper. Right, doctor?
Heart attack ... consistent with being scooped out of Lake Mead.
So, what happened to this guy?
He could've been clipped by the chopper's Bambi Bucket. Did you find anything between his toes? Like sand from ... 
Something on your mind, Greg?
Yeah. You want to make yourself useful, drop this off at trace. 
Must be some kind of soap. Robbins got me halfway there.
Yeah? State your source.
Sealed closed.
Hose melted. Catherine found it at the base of the tree. 
Guess it's like anything pressurized. These things blow for one of two reasons: Too much air or too much heat.
You just made yourself useful, my friend.
Oh, yeah.
Hmm?
Let go my Greg-o. He's a CSI wannabe. Please. Check out the bottom of this tank.
We had a little explosion here. 
Figure if I can get the serial number off the tank get on the horn with some surf shops track the renter through a credit card.
Well, we still haven't ID'd the vic, but ... it's worth a shot.
Mm-hmm. Embedded in his aconeus muscle. 
After you paged, me I had Robbins comb his body.
It's your theory.
But that's not what killed Skeller. Robbins said he took a line drive to the chest.
I'll call O'Reilly.
You had a dead body. So, you decided to get creative. Fire season, wet suit, liquid soap.
This gave you a head start. My guess is around, what, five-minute mark.
Actually ... you did. See, the thing you forgot about a scuba tank is it contains compressed air. Too much heat ... and kaboom.
Rocket Man.
Come on ... we always get better service when you're there.
You're keeping him alive? Sara said you guys already solved the case.
All right.
Nick Stokes, Gil Grissom, Las Vegas Crime Lab. You want to tell us what's going on? What happened here?
See that lividity? Blood settled at the time of death.
My bad, Sara.
Okay, make like a scarecrow for me, partner. 
Arms out, away from your body. That's it. Stay just like that.
Got some red fibers.
Victim didn't fight back. Probably didn't see it coming.
I feel like I'm mowing a lawn.
Zilch.
Don't tell me, more zilch?
No ligature marks.
Hey ... I feel a wallet here.
Ramirez Kenny. A 25-year-old Latino and a 42-year-old white guy?
Hey, O'Riley. What's the matter, man? A/C not working?
Yeah ... gas station.
You don't just miss something like that. What was going on?
Okay, all right. Just-just walk us through it. When did you know there'd been a crime committed?
I don't see any blood.
Murder scene was compromised.
A Lorcin .380. The same pistol registered to a Benjamin Jennings.
And we can prove he transported those bodies in his vehicle based on the blood you found.
We I.D'd the fibers using the FTIR. It's a polymer commonly used in vehicle carpeting.
They're identical.
Bottom line ... he killed them.
Excuse me?
Victim blood in his car?
It's our job to present the D.A. with the best evidence possible. Let a jury decide. Anything else, we're playing judge. The evidence doesn't get any better than this.
Right.
Misunderstood the priest? How?
Benjamin Corey Jennings. Nonviolent crimes.
Roger Jennings ... armed robbery. Past convictions, breaking and entering. Assault with Great Bodily Harm. Paroled 9/27/2000.
This guy is hard-core. He's looking at his third strike here.
You know how we pushed him to file on Ben?
We might have been wrong.
Nope.
Hey, guys. You can go ahead and take off. I think we got it.
Sara?
Could be red sauce.
I'm just trying to put our mistake to good use.
Okay.
Looks like it jammed, huh? Get anything instructive?
Any idea what he used?
We present this to the D.A.
The guilty brother's going to walk.
Hey, there. Warrick's got three residential burglaries, so ... 
According to O'Riley this guy's body language says he's guilty.
Autistic? You mean like Rain Man?
Kind of sounds like you.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Sir, you can't come in here.
Officer, Mr. Hunter would like to give a statement to Detective O'Riley.
Mm-hmm.
There's no surveillance system.
Do you have something for me?
Well, there's no smoking gun in any of these bottles. What's on the label is what's in the bottle. Isopropyl alcohol ... 15% ammonia solution ... imidazole ... bleach.
Hmm?
Is this guy the real deal?
Organized by size.
I'll check out the bedroom.
Grissom. You might want to come back here a sec.
Personal effects. Like some creepy little shrine. Vic's hair. She was seeing Hunter. Aaron got jealous. Incapable of deception, huh? How do you feel about murder?
Well, it's not pulling a spectra. It's not a chemical.
But it's foreign. How did it get in there?
I always thought you kept your p0rn in there.
Very impressive.
Yeah, yeah, which one of your relatives got you in?
Translation ... 
You just drew the molecular structure of a foreign protein. A Plant?
Biotoxin?
Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop now. Biotoxin, as in anthrax, smallpox? I was at that crime scene for eight hours, man.
What kind of symptoms are we talking about, here?
No.
Mm-mm. 
Western State Historical Society.
Hey, guys. That's Aaron's book, right?
Shouldn't you be looking at that under a fume hood?
What makes you think there's a difference? He probably cooked up that ricin in his kitchen.
So he cleans up well. What, you're not feeling sorry for this guy, now, are you?
Anybody else would be in a cell right now.
Veronica Bradley must have loved uniballs. She had about a dozen at her house. Plus every known piece of forgery equipment.
I also found this under her refrigerator. Funny how people don't think to clean there.
But if we find Ricin on any of the pens from her house ...
... we'll know where she cooked up the castor beans.
What up, Einstein? Ooh, you got anything there?
It's all yours.
Then she was chained up.
She was in the raw.
Yeah.
Sounds like frat house gravy.
Never heard of it.
I got it.
Sure, sure. I got it, man.
That's her.
She drove herself to work.
Hey, Catherine .... come check this out.
Liquid latex. Grissom found some on the victim. Sanders did a trace analysis. Stuff peels off like a glove.
Yeah. What do you think that is there? Watch?
I guess Lady Heather hasn't quite cleared this room yet.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Hey, hey. Liquid latex. Like the kind we found in the dumpster and on the vic. Hand me a bindle will you? You know what I just realized?
None of this weirds me out anymore.
Catherine, do you really think that those freaks out there, running around with their little dog collars on getting spanked are the same as you and me?
No way, never gonna happen.
Hey, man, my mom and dad are human, and ...
Security managed to return a few rounds. Nine millimeter.
Times have changed.
Did you get a good look at it? Make, model?
Car peel out?
Smells like burnt wood.
No. No, transmission fluid. But it's brown, not red.
It's not the right color.
You're a surfer now?
We're 300 miles from the nearest beach.
I got your page. Where's my report?
Yeah, thanks.  Type f with dexron.
So ... you should be reading Car &amp; Driver instead of Sand and Surf. Someone put the wrong type of fluid transmission. See, Ford automobiles use a thick red Type-F transmission fluid. General Motors uses a thinner, yellow fluid with dexron. Now, when dexron's put into a ford it thins that Type-F fluid. Friction builds, gears grind. 
The second gear is usually the first to go. Friction causes the engine to overheat, in turn cooking the transmission fluid turning it brown. 
Leak on the pavement is the first clue you've got a problem. 
Not just Ford. The getaway vehicle has a stubborn second gear.
My guess is it's already been dumped.
Hey, guys. I just got a call from Brass. We got a possible getaway vehicle off I-93.
It's beige abandoned, '77 mercury cougar. Mercury's a division of Ford. I'll drive.
Yeah. Check for treads, Jim?
If you were stashing a car, where would you hide it?
Oh ... check out that dirt displacement.
There isn't one.
Dirt to pavement, then the trail goes cold.
I'm not pulling it.
Yeah, it turns grown men into criminals.
Silica found both on Adam Brower's clothing and the getaway vehicle.
Motorcycle tracks at the vehicle dump site.
Yeah, that smells nice.
Adam, Tammy ... now Darin... all dead.
Shot with the same gun used to kill Adam at the casino.
Why did Darin kill Adam? 
That's confirmed?
So, Darin thought he was getting the whole score.
Maybe Tower Club surveillance missed something.
Yeah, before Tammy drew her gun.
Indirectly, yeah.
No, it's from his head.
Mm-hmm.
One, two, three, four, five, six.
Mm-hmm.
Let's run ATF.
Any names jumping off the page?
Who called it in?
Means he wasn't shot here.
Well, it's flat. You could still land a plane here.
Actually, we're looking at two.
Yeah, I've got fresh marks at the head of the runway two sets, both parallel, so ... my guess is one car spun out here ...
Yeah, well, I been here a while. Over there another set of treads going straight ahead, so ...
I think so, yeah.
Or street racing.
There's a reason it's illegal.
Midnight drags. My brother was a gearhead. Rebuilt a '65 GTO with three carbs. Ran the thing flat out. Zero to a buck-13 in a quarter mile.
No. No, not really.
The desert.
Centrifugal supercharger. Nice. 
Nos. Nitrous oxide system.
Regular air is about 20% oxygen. Nitrous is 40. Double the burn, double the power.
Check out that racing harness. Same as the bruises found on the victim.
We're all ears.
Michelangelo?
It's an odd name for a mechanic.
Michael ... angelo. Nick Stokes, Catherine Willows. Vegas crime lab.
Wow.
How do you know?
We're looking for the kid he raced the night he was shot.
Thumpy G dropped your name, man. Said he was driving a Michelangelo.
A blue honda, blue rims, tinted windows. 
Hold the phone. I've got what looks like ... ah. ...A nine-millimeter round. No visible body fluid. What do you think? Maybe a miss?
Spray it up.
Well, what about the rest of this blood? It's everywhere. 
Okay. Uh, let's back up and start over shall we, Mr. Masters? You and your brother were off-roading.
And you stumbled upon a wrecked racer out near Mercury.
Why didn't you just ... ?
Please.
Make yourself at home, boss.
Dumbass.
New glass - less tint.
Did you replace one of your car windows recently?
Before or after you fired the gun in your car?
The sunroof?
Well, sir, we have reason to believe this gun was used in a homicide. 
What do you got, Bobby?
Yeah.
Great, so it's useless.
Bullet's got splinters. Light glass, tinted glass. Thanks, Bobby.
Jace Felder?
Maybe, but why try to gun down Felder he in the middle of a street race?
Hey, wait, hang on Cath, give me a test fire, will you?
I wired the target to the car's alarm system. Gotta make sure we hear it.
Okay, remember full out the fifth then hit the nitrous and hang on.
And you weren't?
So, let me get this strait. You decide to become one of them. You buy a car with your mother's death benefit toss your hat in the ring and wait for your shot.
Took his title and then took him down. 
Soundbite Wescott?
All right.
I'll look for transfers.
Okay.
You coming?
All right.
I'm processing as fast as I can, sir. It would help if I had the dice used at this table.
I've got my work cut out for me then, don't I?
Proceed, sir.
Oh, here she is.
Are you serious?
As soon as it's processed they'll get a copy of our report.
I've never done a case where the defendant took advantage of that rule of discovery.
You beeped me from across the hall?
Yeah?
So when he blew on the dice, he blew victim blood.
Murder's messy, my friend.
If I want to present it to a jury, yeah. Nowadays, people expect a show. 
I should've gone to film school.
Yeah, Tonya's. Looks like Raymond was disposing of the bodies for your client. You think he ran out of time before he could move Kim's out?
No. What I showed you on video is Ray in the casino during the time the murders were committed.
Uh, Ray was caddying a dead body. We show him this he'll rat out Tommy Terrific in a heartbeat. 
Uh-oh.
I don't believe this. 
This is B.S., man. Total B.S. This guy, Tom Haviland's, got blood all over his hands ...
... and friends to lie for him! This is B.S.!
Hey, Grissom. Brass just called. They found the other victim, Tonya. Briarway golf course.
Grissom, you might want to come down here.
Beans and franks. Tonya's a man.
Thanks, Cath. You know, I've done this before.
Yeah.
I do.
Nicholas Stokes. S-T-O-K-E-S.
Oh. Sorry. I'm used to the old ones. 
Nicholas Stokes.
Damn!
Damn, damn, damn. I blew it. I forgot to put case identifiers on my dice photos.
Yeah. 
Don't look at me that way, okay? I wrote it down on the evidence envelope. I had to move fast. The casino manager wanted us out of there.
This is it.
This is the one.
I was sweating bullets looking at those photos.
No. No, just my credibility.
Yeah, he's, uh, he's in the men's room.
Hey, we're all in Nevada. It's legal; don't worry about it.
Truth is, it is compromised, Warrick. 
Okay, Warrick, hit it.
White female, multiple bruising ... bullet hole to the temple doesn't help. .380 auto on the side.
Hmm ..
Hey, Warrick.
Check this out.
It's a little thin for blood, isn't it?
What do you ...?
Hummingbirds do love the color red.
No visible footprints.
Yeah.
Solo? 
So does this mean when I come in on my day off I get to work solo?
Whoa. I got what looks like two sets of prints. Ballpark in a size ten from the house. And what looks like a ... size 12, possibly from the pool.
There were definitely two guys here, Griss.
Oh, yeah, it's the pool. It's been doing it all night. 
First officer said it was clear.
Uh ... no.
I'll go in the pool.
Oh, man! Male D.B.
I mean, I don't get it. She's not even slated to work. She comes in on her day off and she gets to work solo.
Is that right?
Blam.
Blam.
Hmm? Oh, that guy in the mirror. Good. Archie, help us out.
Nice.
Looks like Augie was helping himself to a little bit more than the artwork.
Some hairs, may have found a filling.
Tributlyltin oxide, aluminum sulfate quaternary ammonium. Chemicals in the vic's lungs match the chemicals in the pool water.
Trace matches the side of the pool. No surprises.
Hmm?
Gives us possible transfer.
He may have transferred mildew from the pool to the house.
She was cheating on her husband.
Pool man.
The realtor?
Good. I'm almost there. Hang on.
Okay, I think that's the angle.
Back up.
Keep going. Keep going.
Big. Keep going. Keep going.
Well, go in the closet.
What?
What the hell is that?
You cannot be serious!
All the prints are accounted for by people who had a reason to be in the Newman house all the way down to the vortex cover. Warrick? 
Yeah.
Yeah, so all I've got is an errant blond hair, a tooth filling and some detritus from the bottom of the pool.
Yeah. I mean, I did identify some neoprene and it was white.
Yeah.
Not that I know of. The son can't even swim.
Scuba diver. Or a professional.
No, I mean like a hired gun professional.
Oh, hey. Excuse me.
Suicide among any disability group is above average.
This rope was identical to the rope around the victim's neck. It's used as a hand rail. 
Hey, Greg. GREG: Hey. NICK: Get anything off the rope? GREG: Yeah, a few brown hairs around the knot. Only one with a skin tag, though. And those fibers that Sara found on the body? NICK: Yeah? GREG: Polyester upholstery. Cheap rugs and tacky furniture.
So, present.
All right, fresh epithelials.
How long for DNA?
Well, I can't just give you her blood. That takes a court order.
We found your skin cells on the rope that hung Lawrence.
No, I'm not.
Then explain how your skin cells got on the rope.
Brass told her not to leave town. 
He sounded a bit like Jack Lord, don't you think? 
You have a cross section?
Hmm. No pigment at the central core. No color.
Okay. So, back to the midgets.
Well, you better do it fast. The convention's over in two days. After that, the Little People go home and we lose all our suspects.
Hey. Do you mind, little man? I'm trying to work here. Man In The Wheelchair: Really? NICK: Yeah. Man In The Wheelchair: You making any progress, CSI man? NICK: Some. Man In The Wheelchair: Uh-huh. Are we getting your A-game or your B-game?
Come again? Man In The Wheelchair: You see us little people we're used to getting the short end of the stick.  You don't get to laugh at that. 
Well, a man was killed; that's no joke. 
He looked like he fit your profile. So, I asked around. Two little people confirmed he has C.H.H.
Did you know your father killed Lawrence?
Hey, did you get anything else off that laptop?
Victim was paralyzed, couldn't fight back. Kevin Marcus puts the rope around his neck makes a slip knot.
No way he could've reached it.
Changing my perspective.
Oh, man. Can you imagine going through life at this height?
... adapt yourself to it.
Where's Grissom?
We know how he did it.

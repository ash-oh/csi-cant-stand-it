I'm sick about this. Of all kids. Jeff. I can't stop crying.
Oh, thanks, uh ...  Small Pellegrino, room temperature.
I don't know her. Jeff must have met her here. I loved him like a son. Smart. Hard-working. I hired him right out of law school.
An assistant. He wanted to learn from the bottom up, like I did.
Yeah. But I had a nasty habit -- I wanted to eat regularly. And didn't want to work as a waiter to do it.
Um ... about a month ago, when he was making copies of my divorce settlement, he spotted a provision that my wife's lawyer had rephrased. My lawyers had missed it. He saved me millions of dollars. So to thank him, I gave him a vacation.
Couple hundred bucks, corporate credit card. Told him to have fun.
Yeah. I'll be regretting that for the rest of my life.
Well, I hope this means you know what happened to Jeff. That's the first time that the tower yanked back my Gulfstream on takeoff.
Something wrong with your office?
If that's a joke, it's in pretty poor taste.
That's because he did. The charges against me were dropped. The poor kid had a serious problem. I got him into a program. Understand he's doing better now. 
The media spins everything ... 
I don't do drugs. And I had no idea that Jeff had a drug problem.
Captain Brass ... you've seen too many of my movies. I'd like to call my attorney now.

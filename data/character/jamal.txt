Yo, man, get these spiders off my face, man! I gotta beam up outta here. I need my medication. I'm a CEO of a five-bag-a-day corporation, you know that? 
Thank you. 
Y'all look like cartoons, man. Okay, thank you.
It's all good, it's all good.
Whoa! Who gonna pay for that hole in my ride, man?
Finders keepers, baby. I gotta bag me some ho's.
I know you stealin' my medication. I am in pain, damn it! Bring me some stuff! 
What are you two ladies lookin' at?
Half the peoples I know be dead. It don't mean they can't own a vehicle.
Nurse, this be cruel and unusual!
Explain what, B? I was laid up shootin' speedballs all day. Look, man, when I get off, I'm gone. Feel me? I can't see nothin', I can't hear nothin'. Wherever high is, that's where I take the elevator up.
Oh, you damn cow! Took you long enough. When I call you, you come, you understand me?
Why you got to do me like this? That's right.  Man's already dead. Why he be needing shoes, anyway?

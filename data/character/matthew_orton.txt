You all right?
We're honest people.
What kind of deposit?
What? Why?
What do you mean, you can't give it back? That's all the money we have for our vacation.
I went to the gas station. The attendant told me the hundred I gave him was phony so I went to our branch bank here and I tried to exchange the bad money for the good but they said we couldn't do it. I mean, why would anybody turn in bad money if they can't get reimbursed for it?
I just didn't want to get stuck holding the bag.
Wish I had met you last week.

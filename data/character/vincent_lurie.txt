Dr. Clark is on my surgical rotation. He was scheduled to assist this morning. No show.
No. It's completely out of character. See, half these interns come in here so scared, they couldn't carve a turkey. I have to give them scalpels with training wheels. Clark was different. He, uh, he's a real artist, a steady hand. Yeah, he has a gift.
He turned a lot of nurses' heads, but it never interfered with his work. Why the questions?
Uh ... all I can ask is that I ... I hope that you're wrong about Dr. Clark. Excuse me.
You understand, right? The police aren't the only ones with a code of honor. Now, some of these men are married, and if this gets out ...
There was no need for the light show. All you had to do was ask.
I'm a 48-year-old man. I'm not unique.
I-I take rogaine and propecia. Again, not unique.
Well, if you're going to make accusations, you should really do your homework. Howard and I are the only lefties on staff. Dr. Randolph, who has privileges at the hospital, he's also a lefty. We play tennis every Wednesday. He's got a heck of a back-hand.  If you want me to name more names, I could, but you don't want me to do your job for you, do you?
Mm-hmm. It looks like it. Where's the rest of it?
Well, all I can tell you is when I gave it to her, it was in one piece.
Oh, no, no, it's worth a listen.
I'm still here.

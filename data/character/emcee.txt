Fire up your controllers.
Hold on, guys.
Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for the Comedy Hole's very own Michael Borland.
Ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow night, more than 18,000 people are going to come and see this guy at the Thomas and Mack Center. But tonight, you guys are going to hear him first. Everybody give it up for Mr. John Mayer!

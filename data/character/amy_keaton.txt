I went out with friends.  My curfew's 1:00. I was a little late.
My mom was in Detroit. Vanessa's my stepmom. The tv was on in their room. I snuck into my room and went to bed. The sirens woke me up.

Like you care who I have s*x with? I know about your parties, all the kids know, so don't get all righteous on me.  I want to see Tom.
It wasn't like that.
How could you!
Oh, my god. Oh, my god.
So we put her in the fountain.
He loves me. Can I see him?

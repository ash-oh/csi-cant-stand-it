I didn't shoot nobody. Please, you got to believe me. I just wanted to drive that car. Morris was always bragging about it.
I was picking up an order for Drops. I saw that poster on the wall. I just told the other guys what I saw. Look, I know I shouldn't have done that, 'cause as soon as I did, Morris wanted to see the poster. Morris would do anything for Dollar. You know, Dollar's his life. He only has Dollar in his ipod. No one else.
Yeah. We just waited for them to show up.
Some other snippers. Hi-Def street team. Morris didn't care who they were, ... 
... as long as they was putting up them posters, they was dead to him.
I ran them over.
After he got the first one ... he said he had to get the rest.
He shot the second one next, down off the palm tree. 
The last one almost got away.

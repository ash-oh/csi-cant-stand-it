That's not your ring.
I'm telling you, that is not the ring I gave you. That's a different cut.
I bought you that ring. Who do you think spent the week looking for the perfect stone for our first anniversary?
Then maybe you should explain to me why I'm not looking at my wife's ring.
How do I know you didn't switch this ring out?
Oh, we screw the out-of-towners and nobody's going to care, right?
You bet I am.

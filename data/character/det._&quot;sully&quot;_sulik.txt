Girl's name is Linda Damen, 23, apparent suicide. Father stopped by with dinner found her dead, called 9-1-1.
Nope. Did find her wallet out. Empty.
There he is-dollar slots, wearing the cap.
We showed his photo around. The ATM in the lobby -- he used it 24 hours ago.
Las vegas police. We want a word with you. What do you know about the death of Linda Damen?
Did you kill this girl and try to make it look like a suicide?
Save her how?
I looked into that prescription at the pharmacy you asked about. Linda Damen, the deceased.
She doesn't have a prescription for valium. Her mother does -- Jane Damen. 25 milligrams as needed.
Okay.

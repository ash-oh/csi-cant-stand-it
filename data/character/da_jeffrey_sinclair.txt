I asked you guys to rule out one suspect, now we have three.
Oh, I'd put money on that.
Yeah. Which means we're down to Malcolm and Hannah. Right back where we started.
Okay, I'll proceed against Marlon for the murder and bring charges against Hannah for conspiracy.
Stacy's parents and the community will have my ass if I don't.
So, did anybody talk to the delivery guy?
Where we are is in the crapper. Look, I have to disclose the cart. Defense is going to eat me alive.
Well, I sure hope it's Marlon, because he's the one we have on trial.
Sara?
In my world, that's called an acquittal.
High school. Even if you're popular, or a jock, or a brain ... it can be hell. Everybody here remembers what it was like ... what it was really like. Now take a look at Marlon West. Take a good, hard look. Not popular ...
... not a jock ... not a brain.
Now imagine what it must be like to be Marlon West day after day after day in the sociological pressure cooker of high school.
This imposing, struggling outsider like Marlon resenting someone like Stacy Vollmer, who made it look so easy to be popular, athletic and smart. 
That strong resentment was already festering when Stacy made Marlon's sister the object of a typical high school prank.
And that is when Marlon, his resentment ... 
... boiling over, crossed a line: He stalked Stacy. You've seen and heard evidence illustrating the elaborate pains he took to rig a showerhead to torture Stacy,
... how he forced her to run and fall, ... 
... and watched her die in a pool of her own blood. You know, for the first time in his life, Marlon feels like a hero. He's not invisible anymore. He's a killer ... and he is guilty beyond all reasonable doubt.

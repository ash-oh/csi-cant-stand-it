Uh, ma'am, I got to take a leak.
You guys are making a big mistake. 
... I don't know a Rachel Lyford, I swear.
I know a Rachel, okay? I never knew her last name. Did the girl that you guys are looking for live at the Saturn Arms Apartments?
I ... here's the deal, okay? A car wax costs sixty bucks, okay? We give you discounts sometimes. I' show up early and, you know, I'll go to a girl's apartment before work, or whatever, you know, and all the guys do this. 
I only charged her 25.
Shiny as a new penny.
Yeah. She was all over me. She answered the door in, like, this sexy little thing, and stuff. Most of the time, when a woman answers the door, it's in sweats, they got the money ready. This was not like that.
What am I supposed to think?
Hey, I'm all done.
Lady, you are whacked.
She gave them to me.

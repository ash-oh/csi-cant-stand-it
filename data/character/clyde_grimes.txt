I'm up to $8.75 an hour.
Look ... is my wife here?  Is she behind the glass or something?
Oh, come on, now. Is that really necessary? I mean, I'm just a regular guy ...
Dead cop?! What are you talking about? Those three bills -- that's-that's my money. All right, technically, it's my wife's, but ... I was about to go on my break anyway. My wife's not behind that glass, right?

Cut!
Cut! Damn it!
Can somebody please get her a glass of water?!  What happened? Babe? What are you doing? Are you choking on the blood?
Yeah, but this time, get it on her face, not in her mouth.
Yeah, I know, I know. But hit her from the side, from the side. And get plenty on the rack.
How long have I known you, huh? This is you and me. Get the shot -- not too tight. Wide enough to fit in the fun bags.
Baby-cakes ...
Don't laugh. You were scary. Get away.
Honey, this time, don't inhale the blood, okay? All right, let's get her cleaned up. Let's shoot this bitch.
Not you, baby. The shot. The shot's a bitch. I love one-ers. And you know what else I love? I love sushi. Me, too. Do you want to go for sushi?
Well, do you have a suspect?
Yeah, I get it, I get it. I mean, it could be anyone.
So what am I supposed to do today?
Please. That looks pretty stupid, doesn't it?
Yeah?
Detective Brass.
Man, I love that. Detective Brass. You're a detective, and your name is Brass. I mean, I can use that. That's like a cop named Officer Copper. Or a tin horn sheriff named Sheriff Tin. You cannot write that stuff. 
Dude, I know why you're here, okay? Weatherly and I, yes, we were knocking boots, man.
Well, yeah, I just said I had s*x ... Why would I deny it? Hey, I bang all my stars. It builds trust. It's part of my process. 
Dude, you gotta see this. You're gonna love it. 
Check it out.
Money. Money.
Oh, yeah.
Oh, ba-by. Oh, ba-by.
Oh, man, oh, man...
Look, does that look like a woman being taken against her will?
Weatherly was ... how can I put this delicately? She was an ass-scratcher, man. She liked to scratch my ass. She wasn't pushing me away, man, she was pulling me in.
Brass, look at my ass.
Freaking claw marks.
You gotta help me. I'm shot! I'm shot! You gotta get us out of here.
Do you know how many people I've killed in this place?
The irony is exquisite, but the pain is more formidable, you know? I think the pain is preventing me from enjoying the irony.
But I ...
Oh, that's not good.  I should really stop talking and-and try and relax.
But I can't stop talking. I've got that thing that ... It's a syndrome. It's a word ... There's a word for it.
People have it. It's a syndrome. I can't stop talking.
Stanley ... Stanley, don't shoot me again. I don't want to die, okay? You already shot me twice. I learned my lesson, okay?
I'm editing late, like I always do, and I hear a shot. 
So, I go outside and check it out.
Stanley!
But you killed him! You killed Dickie!
Next thing you know, I'm running for my life. And the nut job is chasing me. He shoots me, and then I see the hot ... you. And all I can think the whole time is, Man, this is great. I could use this stuff. I mean, this is life imitating art imitating life. You are so beautiful.
You are ... Your, your face is so expressive. It-it emotes. You do terror so good.
I know.
Well, hey, listen. If you ever get tired of fighting crime, you know, there's always a future for you in the horror business. I mean, I'll take you there.
Oh, hey, the offer's still good.
No, I'm serious. I could build an entire franchise around you.
Seriously. Give me a call.

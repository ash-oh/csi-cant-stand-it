Ah, that's gross.
Oh, you think?
It was a tip.
I found it ... sort of.
Tavian is always surrounded by women. Guys, too, but they want autographs. The chicks -- they want something else.
Now, usually his boys turn them away, but this one got through.
There were definitely chicks a lot hotter, but I guess when you can have anything ... 
No, just the opposite. They got into it right there.
Casino taxes me $24 an hour regardless of what I make. And do you know how much a zillionaire like Tavian Tombs tips? Zip. Nothing. Not even change I can throw in the fountain. And why? Because he's comped all the way around. R.F.B.-- Room, food, beverage -- including tips. So, when ten large goes sliding across the floor, and nobody sees it? Get out of the way, 'cause Kevin's coming through.
Hey, I tried to give it back.
This is yours. 
So, uh, what about my money?

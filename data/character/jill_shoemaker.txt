Okay, well, when we got engaged, she ran into the backyard and she screamed, Why, God? Why me? Okay, she wore white today. She invited Adam's very, very attractive, very, um, single ex-girlfriend. When she found out that I had registered for sporting goods, she went behind my back and she changed the registry to housewares, saying that I'd better learn how to cook, okay? I'm a vegetarian, and she demanded roast beef. Um ... oh, and then ... then there's the toast. The ... the toast.
I would never do that to Adam. I honestly don't know how such an amazing man came from-from ... that. Look, it wasn't just me, okay? She fought with everyone today. She fought with the valets and the bridesmaids and the waiters. The caterer -- I thought for sure he was going to poison her.

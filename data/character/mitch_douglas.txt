My name is Mitch Douglas.
Want me to pee in a cup?
He worked a lot of places. I met a lot of people.
Yeah. His music sucks. What do all these stiffs got to do with me?
Before or after he blew his brains out?
You ever step in a pile of crap, but you're wearing boots, so you can't just scrape it off. You got to dig it out with a stick, but even that doesn't work, so you just end up tossing the boots in the trash? It was kind of like that.
Much better. You gonna arrest me?
I'm not.
Okay, so maybe I met her. So what?
I don't.
If only. Let me tell you about Ernie. What he cared about in this life was ... his wife, his trains, and his kids. In that order.
Again, if only. If you're looking for a love connection, then ... then you should maybe go talk to one of the chosen ones.
Fosters. My parents had, like ... dozens. They'd come and go, some before I was born. My mom loved kids. Dad loved Mom. I guess as soon as I came around ... the love ran out. And then Mom dies ... the kids leave ... and Ernie's left with me.
Ernie didn't take a bullet for me.  But it's a beautiful thought.

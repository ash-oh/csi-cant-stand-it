I received the call and issued the 444. Uniforms called back a few minutes later, said they checked the area, said it was a U.T.L. You want to hear that?
I can get that for you right now.
What's it worth to you?
I don't think you understand.
Now, I've got three full minutes of Officer Fromansky here. I was thinking of maybe taking it to the dispatch convention.
I can make that dub for you. What time?

I'm Trent Calloway. Who are you?
Yeah, but he's out.
Yeah. I'm painting the house.
A day or two ago. 
This whole painting thing had him stressed out.
Yeah. He worked freelance mostly. He won a bandy award for that one.
That's it, as far as I know.
I'm a bouncer at the french palace. I throw guys like you out.
We weren't that close. We had some mutual friends, he needed someone to help him with this place and, uh, I never turn down a job.
I don't think it's Victor's style. This is ridiculous.
Yeah, I was painting it.
No.
Why?
It's 13.

Gentra just loved the hip-hop music. And it kept her out on the streets. She actually wanted to be a rapper herself. She did a couple of talent shows. Didn't do too well. So she joined a street team.
Groups of kids who hit the streets to promote their favorite rapper. It kept Gentra around what she loved.
Hi-Def. That's what he calls himself.
I couldn't afford to bury my husband.
You send her ashes to Hi-Def.

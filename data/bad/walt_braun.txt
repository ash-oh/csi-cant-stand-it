Hey, dad, I got the press clogging up valet. Should I call security or just handle it, or what?
You came down here to ask me about a doggie door? I could've just told you over the phone.
Hmm. Tony and I went to dinner.
A while back.
Uh, about a month and a half ago. We ate at Piero's talked a little business -- I dropped him off.
My key still works here. How come it doesn't work on the front door?
And, so, I used the doggie door walked through the house, opened the door, let Tony in.
When you're a Braun there's nothing you can't replace.
I don't know something must've bit me.
What are you, a dermatologist?
Sure. Can you tell me what to put on it? It's killing me.
Whatever rubs your Buddha.
Shoshone Hi-Rise -- J.W. Brown Road.
Yeah, I'm a glorified pit boss.
No. My life's pretty routine.
That's the thing about my father: He could never give advice but he had a million stories. 'Scorpion and the Frog.' 
Scorpion needed to get across the creek and asked the frog for a ride. Frog says, 'I can't trust you, you're a scorpion.' Scorpion says, 'sure you can.' Hops on the frog's back. Midway across, the scorpion stings the frog. Frog looks at him. 'Why would you do that? Now we're both gonna die.' Scorpion says ... 'I can't help it. I'm a scorpion.'
If Tony hadn't thrown a party ... the two of us would never have been standing at that bar.
You're looking at my brother's trophy?
Walt Braun.

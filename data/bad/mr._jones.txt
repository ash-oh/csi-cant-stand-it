Why the flip?
Not bad. No hairlines. No fly specks. You got yourself a slider.

Guy came in a couple of weeks ago with this collection looking to sell. I bought it.

No, go ahead. I got nothing to hide.
Hey, my merchandise is authentic.
Yeah, well, I cut my finger the other day.
Yeah, it sounds like a pretty nice collection. How about I come by Saturday and take a look?

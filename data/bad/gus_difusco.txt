Hey. I got robbed last week, filed a report. How come you're helping Chandru and not me?
I had to cut out early. My wife's sick. But, uh, Dru's solid. Got to respect a guy who comes here and wants to be legit. Goes to work, pays his taxes, studying to be a citizen.
Go get 'em.
Because he was gonna report it and get me fired. I'm two months from retirement. My wife's got MS. I need my health benefits. But I didn't hit that girl. He did.

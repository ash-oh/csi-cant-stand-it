Hello.
No. Everybody loved Wendy.
Tuesday morning. She needed some time away ... to get perspective. She did that sometimes. Uh, we have a, a cabin up by Calville Bay.
Oh, that-that's personal.
Uh, well, the average is only once a week. Saturdays.
Probably three or four months ago.
What's going on? I thought Wendy drowned.
When you find out what happened to my wife, I want to know everything.
You didn't call, so I was following you. Uh, this is ... Phil Swelco's house, isn't it?
Informally. Does he have something to do with Wendy's death?
I just wanted to see if you guys have anything new.
All right.
Phil? Phil Swelco?
What are you doing here? Why are you questioning him?
I always knew she was seeing someone. I just didn't know who.
She was having an affair with Phil Swelco? And you think he killed her.
He killed my wife.
What?

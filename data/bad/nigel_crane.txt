From an airplane they used to look like ants. And now ... they're all ants all the time. You squash one ...
They all start running around in a panic.
I see you, Jane. Do you feel me? Do you feel me?
You ... you will never get me. No. Not the way he does. And we all get what we deserve. And I ... I got a friend.
It's like he, he's ... he's the kind of guy I always wanted to, um ... to be. And that's why it's so great, because ... we're friends now. I feel like I can count on him, you know? And you know what? I think if it came right down to it he would lay his life down for me. Ask him. A-a-ask Nick. Nick, would you let me stop your heart?
Oh, man. You got to ... you got to watch who you let in here. Guy was snooping around all over the place. You know, smart move. Spare gun.
Ah. Keep it right by the phone right? Right next to your address book and, and take out menus.
Yeah. I heard that.
Oh, yeah. I'm ...
You know, I-I-I picked these up at the dry cleaners and I ... I hope you don't mind. It's just that ... I'm sorry I, I just get a little confused about what's yours and what's mine.
Sports package. Hundred fifty channels. I-I-I even threw in a few movie channels. Free. We-we-we talked, like, forever. I mean, it's like I knew you my entire life.
Yeah. The ... the minute I met you I knew we connected. Because you told me what you did and I knew exactly what you were talking about, because ... that's what I do. I do it, too. You know, I observe people. I-I-I notice everything about them. I watch them. All the time.
Jane was cool. But, um, it would have never worked out between us, you know. Never. I mean, she had a boyfriend and she was kind of stuck up. And you know what, she would have totally, totally gotten between us. So, you know, consider that a gift.
Yeah. Prom night. Your date. Melissa.
Bent over the toilet puking her guts out. Is that ringing any bells, huh?
You know, I mean, Jane's hair was the wrong color but, you know obviously, I fixed that. Because I know how much you love redheads. You know, you ... you mentioned her name in your sleep.
You, um ... you want to open him up?
Hmm?
Are you humoring me, Nick?
You know ... we made friends that day and every time since you just blew me off. Do you know that? You just completely blanked me.
You are so self-absorbed.
I was right in front of your face.
Manners, Nick! Manners!
No, no, I'm going to ... I'm going to ...
... give you a brand-new one. I'm going to do better than that. I'm going to give you the best you ever had. Stand up, Nick. Stand up.
Nick, you know what a nine-millimeter slug does to a skull at close range? You know?
Blow it right apart, right? Brains like strawberry swirled. Whipped cream, everywhere. And you.
You'd have to scoop that stuff up, right? Yeah, little pieces of skull and bone and brains. All in individual baggies with the victim's name on the label.
How do I want this to end? I want you to be able to remember my name.
I am one, and who am I? I am one, and who am I? I am one, and who am I? I am one, and who am I? I am one, and who am I? I am one, and who am I? I am one, and who am I?
I am one, and who am I? GRISSOM: The problem for Nigel is that you would have to die in order for that to happen. Or else he would.
I am one, and who am I?
I am one, and who am I? I am one, and who am I?
I am one, and who am I? I am one, and who am I? I am one, and who am I? And who am I?

Gil Grissom?
I have information about Roger Valenti.
I was the union rep before Roger. The walkout was my idea. Bob Harris threatened me and my family. I wouldn't betray the union so I gave up my position at the local. Roger picked up where I left off.
Because it could have been me.
You checked me out. So what? Worst thing I've done is get a speeding ticket.
It's a work site. Guys get in beefs all the time. 
Look, I'm not saying another word till I talk to a union lawyer. I pay my dues and these guys play hardball.

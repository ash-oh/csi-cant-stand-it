I can't believe she's dead.
Nobody knew we had one.
We were separated. We filed for divorce last week. I thought Wendy was going to do the same thing.
No. No. That's not what I meant. I loved Wendy. She said the marriage was over. It's just that ... just ... she was scared.
She didn't want to hurt Winston. She thought if she left, he'd ... break.
We went back to the marina in her car and then we took the outboard back here.
Wendy didn't want anybody to s-see her car in my driveway so we always met at the marina and then we'd take the outboard over here.
We made love. Then she left. Took the boat back.
At the marina.
Winston.  I heard about your wife. I'm sorry.

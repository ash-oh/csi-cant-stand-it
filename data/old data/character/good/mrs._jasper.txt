Jimmy left early, before I got up. When he didn't come home for dinner I just figured that he got himself a deer.
Well, um, we had both been laid off recently. He was in insurance. He was an auditor.
Well, you know, he was okay. I mean, uh ... we had to borrow money from his folks to pay the rent. That was hard on him.
I have to call them. I haven't called them, I ... 
Yes. Since he was a kid.  He always looked forward to deer season. But, with the baby and all, he missed the last few.
It's me. Isn't it? I encouraged him to go. I thought that it would help him take his mind off things. Oh ... what am I going to do?
No. I mean, he was always so careful. That doesn't sound right.
Thank you.
I don't know what you're talking about.
If I knew, I would've stopped him. Jimmy was everything to me.
Why ... ? Why? I don't understand that. Why did he do that?
So what you're saying is ... that my husband killed himself for me?

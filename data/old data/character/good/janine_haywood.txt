Excuse me.
Boy, are you lucky my lawyer's on a golf course. I've been standing out here, in the heat for hours, answering these stupid questions. Here's your answer, okay. This is my house. Okay? This is half my house anyway.
These are my things ... 
Oh, my god.
Listen -- if anything is missing from this house I'm going to add you to my lawyer's to sue list.
You can't arrest me in my own house.
Why? Didn't do anything.
I just lost my boyfriend, okay? You're a woman. I'm just looking out for my end here, you know? Things start to disappear. If Tony were here right now, he'd tell you himself, just make sure Janine's taken care of.
Hey, I'm in the will.
I told you I dropped them down the bathroom sink.
Look, I took two, gave Tony two and I accidentally dropped fifteen or twenty down the sink. It was an accident. You know, an accident? Haven't you ever spilled a drink?
Don't pin that on me. I'd left.
I went to the pharmacy waited in line picked up the prescription signed for it brought it back to the house. You know, Tony did nothing for himself except work and get high.
Yes, it did. And it'll buy me the dress I wear at Tony's funeral, too.
A friend's.
She's out of town.
That means you can't reach her? Yeah.
Geez! You scared me. How'd you get in here?
Curt, we're out of here.
Hey, at least I can take care of mine.
Yeah ... heard that before.
Call me.
You want to swab me, go ahead but I can save you the-tip. That's really not my style.
Yeah. He doesn't understand. I don't wear studs. Haven't worn studs since, like ... god, seventh grade.
Can I see that picture?  Thanks. See? This is an earring back. It goes to a stud earring. I don't wear studs. I'm more of, like, a dangle gal. I like chandeliers. They move with you. They're on wires. They don't have a back.
Look, rule number one: No women allowed in the house. Tony had a wandering eye, he had a wad of cash who needed that drama?
No. Rule number two: Heavyset, over 50, no makeup, no jewelry, no english.
Yeah. This is my house. I didn't do anything wrong. And I inherited Josie, and she cleans real good. 
Every day. Except on her day off.
Hmm.

Change $100, go ahead.
I don't know what the hell's going on with the world. Everything's crazy. I risk my life just coming into work. Makes you miss the mob days, huh? Back then, this never would've happened. And if it did, those scumbags, they'd be dead, every last one of them and we would never know about it.
We'd just made a money transfer to the rolling cages. Then, bang-- the chandelier comes crashing down. Sounded like an explosion. So I dropped to my knees-- I took cover.
Yeah, I started praying for the gunfire to stop.
Yeah. What the hell is going on here?
What's it to you?
I'm calling my lawyer.
Excuse me?
I saw a gun; I hit the ground.
No. I didn't kill anyone.
Well, I didn't kill him.
I went there, but ...
No, I want to clear this up. All right, I went out to the mine, but I didn't kill Darin. He was already dead. All right, look, I ... I'll admit I helped him out. I ... I told him when and where to hit. That's why I ducked. But that's it.
Well, I went to collect my share, but the money was gone. Darin was dead, and I panicked, but I didn't shoot him. You can't get me for murder on this.
Look, Darin was the only one that I spoke to. I never even met the other three.

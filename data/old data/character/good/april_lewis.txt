I've given Eddie Willows twenty lap dances. He never got rough till last night.
Yeah, he asked me to go for drinks you know, but out in the parking lot he starts kissing on me and I kind of laughed it off, but ... then he grabbed me and he slams me against the wall and... that pig.
Scientist ... wow. You look so normal.
Yeah. A guy pinned me against a wall.
Uh ... what kind of sample?
You'd think what that nurse took down below would be enough. The weird thing is ... I liked the guy.
He promised me a million things. I got tired of him lying.
Music videos. He kept telling me he'd put me in one but he never delivered.
No, it wasn't supposed to go this far, okay? I got this friend over at the trop. She got this high roller on a rape charge. He paid a ton to make it go away.
He is in the music business.
No, I met a producer friend of his from L.A. and he's always throwing money around this place. 
What? What's so funny?

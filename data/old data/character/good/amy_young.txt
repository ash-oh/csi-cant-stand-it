A smudge of dirty tire on a ratty piece of paper?
Just because I'm a newbie, doesn't mean I'm not good. Your tire print from the strip mall.
Common to a lot of compacts and subcompacts. But one manufacturer who uses it standard off-the-lot: Honda.
I've got incidental marks from where the tire ran over something. Left an impression. 
All you have to do is find the tire attached to the vehicle your shooter was driving.
Clean cut, quick way in.
BFK.
I found materials on the cut.
The refractive index of the fibers is 1.544. It's a synthetic. Fiberglass.
Close. But those amber beads are catalysts. Resin-- which causes the fiberglass to harden once its poured into a mold?

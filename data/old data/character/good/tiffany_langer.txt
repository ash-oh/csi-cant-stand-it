Yes, I went to the party. No, I didn't go alone. And no, I'm not telling you my date's name or anyone else who was there. These people are important.
I don't care. It took me a long time to get into the circle and I plan on staying there.
Well, my date.
I haven't seen him since that night. He sent me home with a Judge and his wife.
As far as I know.
I don't know. I've known him for five days.
Right-handed, a libra, circumcised, rich ... back-east rich. Which kind of surprised me because he wore really cheap cologne.
Smelled funny ... sweet.
Or deodorant. Mouthwash maybe. All I know is it smelled sickly sweet. To be honest I thought he could have used a little help in that department.
The only thing he gave me was a good time.
Adam Van Der Welk.
Ask me what he wore. Ask me if he was good in bed. Just don't ask me how close together his eyes were.
Yeah, with a touch of Jude Law.
Okay ... three-way kiss. His lower lip was kind of pouty ... 
and he had this Michael Douglas thing working, you know --- a cleft in his chin.
Yeah. You're right. That is easier.
You want me to do what?
That's it. That's Adam's smell.
Champagne.
No, Are you kidding me? With him it was all dom, all the time.

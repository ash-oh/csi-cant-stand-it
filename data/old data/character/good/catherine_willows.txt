Okay, give me a kiss. Mommy's got to go catch some bad guys.
I'll pick her up in the morning.
Bye, sis.
I love you!
Ma'am ... are you all right?
What do you think?
It's also your 100th.
Why don't you print that tread and see how good you are?
Wait ... wait a minute.
Sir, after you shot the deceased, did you move re-dress, or alter the body in any way?
The left shoe's tied differently. Sir, in the six months that the victim lived with you did you ever wear his shoes?
Sir, what happened to your pinkie toe?
This is Catherine Willows. Are you in danger?
All right, put the gun down.
Everything okay here?
Control, Junk's is a code four.
You the new girl?
Thanks. I'm Catherine Willows.
Let me tell you something, Lady -- if you don't care about catching the suspect neither do we. We're out of here. You can pick your gun up tomorrow.
No.
I can sit here and I can baby you and I can tell you to quit but I'm not going to do that, because I really love my job. We're just a bunch of kids that are getting paid to work on puzzles. Sometimes there's a piece that's missing. Sometimes we solve it in one night.
Stick with it? The cops? Forget it. They wouldn't know fingerprints from paw prints and the detectives ... chase the lie. We solve. We restore peace of mind and when you're a victim, that's everything. Stick with it. At least until you solve your first and if after that you don't feel like King Kong on cocaine ... then you can quit, but if you stay with it my hand to god, you will never regret it.
Copy.
Nurse, excuse me. I'm Catherine Willows from Criminalistics and I'm here for the 428.
Hi, Laura. 
I'm Catherine.  How you doin', kiddo?
Well, that is a camera. I'm gonna take a few photographs. Before I do that, though, could you do me a favor? 
Could you take a look at this drawing and point out to me ... where he touched you?
Can you just show me?
I'd love to.
To my house? Why?
It's okay. 
It's gonna be okay, sweetheart.
Control, this is p-3901. I'm going to be on break for about fifteen minutes.
Shh. 
We don't want to wake up Jeremy.
Mommy just kind of had a rough night. I couldn't drive here fast enough to tell you how much I love you.
Let's get some breakfast. It's on me!
Well, uh ... you know, honey, it's a school night so I need to discuss that with daddy first.
I can sit here, and I can baby you and I can tell you to quit, but I'm not going to do that at least until you've solved your first, and if, after that, you don't feel like King Kong on cocaine, then you can quit.
Weren't you supposed to be shadowing Holly?
You left Holly solo?
Wait a minute. Uh, you-you can't give him the Holly case. I mean, all due respect, Nick. I want this one.
Why?
Yeah. She was going to walk. I convinced her to stay. If anyone's to blame here, it's me, and I want this case. 
Fire me.
Sara Sidle?
Great, that's just what we need, somebody sniffing around.
A little late for the brigade.
First blush?
This is Holly's gun. 
She shot back.
She's out in the field. 
Let me guess ... Sara Sidle?
If you think you're taking my case ... forget it.
Pager. 
Found at the crime scene.
Grissom. He won it on e-bay.
Uh ... Desmond Tutu.
Try one of the casinos on Blue Diamond Road.
Oh, I'll page you with any information.
Okay, thanks, Bobby.
What's wrong?
Shot her with her own gun.
Oh, yeah. Sorry.
Is there anything in there with alcohol?
No.
Shh. It's ringing.
Uh, hey.
Uh-uh. It's my beeper now. I found it.
What kind of business?
Oh, a little something-something. Or maybe a little bling-bling?
Well, invite me over to your crib, baby and you might find out.
Three Aces Motel, Room 202.
Did I just do that?
Got me.
What are you doing here?
Now that's a bling-bling.
Yep.
Where'd you get that scratch?
Hey, guys, it's Catherine.
For whoever is listening we got him. Repeat. Holly Gribbs' suspect is in custody.
You didn't have to come.
I probably do. But this is something I'd rather do alone.
Okay.
I'm sorry.
No, thanks. Got my own.
She gave me just enough ... just enough to catch him.
but she held on long enough to give us a clue.

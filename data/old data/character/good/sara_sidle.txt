Wouldn't you if you were married to Mrs. Roper?
That's me. Still tossing simulation dummies? There are other ways to tell, you know?
You're old school.
How's the girl?
That's too bad.
There's only one why that matters now. Why did Warrick Brown leave that scene?
Do you know where I can find Catherine Willows? 
I know who I am. I think you're a little confused.
Look, we can stand here and argue ... or ... we can get out there and find out who did this to Holly Gribbs.  Two sharp women are better than one.
Where'd you get the pager nest?
They're great for tracing if you can rely on the suspect's honesty.
See what I mean? Don't feel bad. My last four traces came back Eminem,  ... so ... look, you seem to have everything under control here.
Where can I find Warrick Brown?
Stay. I want to talk to you. 
You were playing $100 on every spot. You have a system?
Isn't that illegal?
You play anything else?
So ... let me get this straight. You were assigned by Brass to shadow a trainee, a robbery comes up on M.L.K, and you go for coffee.
So, you felt safe to leave? Do you know the policies and procedures for clearing a scene?
Then, why'd you leave? I mean, what was so important that you had to rush out of there?
Was that before or after you made your bets? Sunday ... Vegas ... NFL football ... guy like you ... come on, you trying to tell me that you didn't make a little pit stop? 
Look at me. Did you log on ... tell dispatch where you were going?
Yeah, well, this time is different.
Holly Gribbs died on the operating table twenty minutes ago.
Mind if I get a soda?
You want one? 
Root beer.
What are you going to say? Hi, I'm a Criminalist. I was in the neighborhood ... 
What's a bling-bling?
For a conviction, we're going to need a DNA sample.
Nicorette?
Pretty good stats! Whoo!
Nice work, Catherine.

I'm going to see my brother! Get out of the way!
Denny, are you okay? Got your call.
My dad's back in town tonight and you'll be sorry you harassed my little brother.
Denny?
It's okay, it's okay. Come on. We'll fix it.
Come on, drink up. Here you go. Good.  Just hold this to your face, okay? I'll be right back.

I'll protect you. I'll fix things so he never comes near you again.

Hello.
I'm Richard Zeigler. Cops told me you were coming. Here, please, come in.
Well, this is, uh where the Sorenson was displayed.
Paul Sorenson was an artist. Early 1900s.
I think I may have surprised the guy while he was stealing it.
I came downstairs to read and I heard a noise.
By the time I got to the room, he was gone but the door was open.
Somebody disengaged it.
Are you finding anything?
Just my wife and my two sons and, uh ... my daughter.
Now, wait a minute. Are you thinking one of us did this?
Oh, no. Nobody's getting a warrant against this family. We'll humor them, and get this over with.
Tell me what you want me to do.
Why would you steal from me?
No, no. God, no. No. I just ... we'll get help for Jason. I don't want court records.
Hello.
Oh, good. You brought my Sorenson.
Good. I'm glad it's back.
My god, my-my ... my Sorenson's a forgery?
Wait. I have $10 million worth of forgeries?
What? 
I don't even know you.
And what exactly were you doing?

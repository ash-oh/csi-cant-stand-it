Yeah... yeah, um ... it's a place called Dante's Pizzeria. It's behind the Strato'.
Well, I deliver the pizzas. It's too hot back there with all the ovens and stuff.
No.
Well, I don't have to talk.
Look, if you know so much about these murders what do you need me for?

I don't know.
What?
I don't know. I swear I don't know. I ... he ... I just picked up the bodies at his place.
Yeah, yeah, man, I'm there all the way.
'Cause he's my brother.  He told ... He told me that if I didn't talk to you guys and if he didn't talk, then this would all just blow over; it'd all just go away.
I don't ... I don't think I can do that kind of time.

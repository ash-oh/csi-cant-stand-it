Tower:  Understand &quot;police.&quot; Roger.
Emily Berhle:  Mommy!







Brass: The luggage stays in the plane. We're going to treat this like a crime scene until we're told otherwise. Tim, Sam, talk to the coach passengers. See what you can't learn. 

Brass: All right, look, I'm going to talk to the first class passengers -- they're in the lounge. Let's meet back there in a half an hour, all right?
Officer Tim: All right.

Grissom: So ... dead guy in first class?
Brass: Las Vegas Air.  Always heard it was a good time.




Grissom: Coroner pronounce?
Brass: About thirty minutes ago.
Grissom: Eyewitnesses?
Brass: Everyone in first class -- nine passengers, one flight attendant.
Grissom: Where are they now?
Brass: Sequestered in the lounge. According to the Flight crew, the deceased had some sort of panic attack and died before they landed.


Grissom: Point of disturbance: Cockpit door. Bloody handprint.  Looks like foot impression. Ballpark shoe size ... ten to eleven maybe. 
 

Brass: Deceased found lying between rows one and two.

Brass: What is that? Blood?




Grissom: I want this whole plane taped off ... nose to tail and wing to wing.
Brass: Oh, it's going to take a lot of tape.
Grissom: I've got a dead body, a crime scene with wings. Something very wrong happened in this plane.
HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS







Grissom: Sheriff?
Sheriff Brian Mobley: We've got a whale of an opportunity here, Gil. Dead body on an airplane -- FAA has jurisdiction. But the Feds won't be here till sunrise. That gives us about twelve hours to be heroes.
Grissom: I don't follow you.
Sheriff Brian Mobley: Well, we either hand over the guy who did it when the Feds get here or we give them all the glory while we watch from the sidelines.
Grissom:  I don't even know if we have a homicide yet. First reports indicate he had some kind of an episode.
Sheriff Brian Mobley: Give me a little credit. Even you wouldn't tape off one of these wide-bodies unless you knew you had something.  Arrest would be good for you. It would be good for me, too. Good for Las Vegas.

Grissom: You running for mayor?




Nick:  What about the passengers in coach? They see anything?
Sara: Brass said the curtain was shut. The Flight Attendant kept them separated. They disembarked through the rear.
Warrick: What do we know about the dead guy?
Catherine: Tony Candlewell, age 30. Communications Company Manager from Atlanta, married ... no record.

Grissom: So? What do you think?
Catherine: I don't know but this sure must have looked scary at thirty thousand feet.
Warrick: All this damage by one guy? Had to be on drugs.
Sara: Too much damage for one guy.
Nick: So, more than one guy?  What do you think, Gris?
Grissom: I think we got ten witnesses all singing the same song. Deceased went berserk. Unless we find something else in the evidence, that's what happened. Catherine ...
Catherine: I'll start the interviews.
Grissom: Thank you. Warrick, go with. 
Warrick: Yeah.
Grissom: Brass has them all assembled in the lounge. Assume there's evidence on everyone. Nick, go with the coroner. Sara and I will work the plane. This is a mobile crime scene. It might not be here tomorrow.






Kiera Berhle:  Miss, my daughter has to go to the bathroom.
Shannon : Okay. I'll see what I can do.
Kiera Berhle: Thank you.


Vicki Mercer: How are you holding up?
Shannon : I'm still shaking.


Brass: Can I have your attention? I'm Jim Brass, from homicide. This is Catherine Willows and Warrick Brown from Las Vegas Criminalistics. They're here to gather evidence.
Lou Everett: You know you can't keep us here.
Catherine:  Sir, we realize this is an imposition, and we apologize for it. Nobody wants to see you on your way more than we do. We'll make this as quick and painless as we possibly can.

Warrick:  Nice snow job.
Catherine: More flies with honey.

Sara: Driver's license ... library card ... organ donor card.
David Phillips: Stand-up guy.

Sara: He had a family.
David Phillips: Can you imagine getting that phone call? What a shame.

Sara: David ... it's always a shame.




Co-Captain Arrington: I saw him board. He seemed like an okay guy.

TONY CANDLEWELL Here, let me help you with that.
Kiera Berhle: Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.
(CO-CAPTAIN ARRINGTON watches the exchange from the front of the plane. 
Tony Candlewell: Sure. No problem.

Grissom: When did you become aware that there was a problem in the cabin?
Captain Murdle: Sixteen-thirty hours, about 35 minutes out. Shannon asked one of us to come out and address an issue with a passenger.

Captain Murdle: What's the problem, Shannon?

Tony Candlewell: Come on! Hello!  Other people have to go to!

Shannon:  Do me a favor: Go back to coach. Make sure no one comes forward. Thanks.

Tony Candlewell:  Come on! It's been ten minutes!
Captain Murdle: Sir ... is there some way we can assist you?
Tony Candlewell: Yeah. You can help me open this door.
Captain Murdle: There are two other rest rooms towards the rear of the plane.
Tony Candlewell: I paid $1,200 to pee here, not in coach.
Captain Murdle: Sir? You need to take your seat.

Grissom: How much time did you spend with him?
Captain Murdle: Two minutes.
Grissom: In that time did you notice anything that would explain his behavior?

Grissom: Was he drunk maybe, or on drugs?
Captain Murdle: Not as far as I could tell. A little agitated. It's not like I haven't seen this kind of behavior before. Flying just makes people react in funny ways.




Nick: Is that a meat thermometer?
Dr. Jenna Williams: Digital readout. Bigger numbers.  98.1.
Nick: Guy should be colder than that. Body temperature drops two degrees in the first hour after death then one and a half degrees for each successive hour.
Dr. Jenna Williams: Well, he's been dead for two hours.
Nick: That would make his temperature at the time of death ... 101.6.
 This guy had a fever.

Dr. Jenna Williams: Let's see what else we got.

Dr. Jenna Williams: Petecchial hemorrhaging behind the eyes ... suggesting suffocation of some sort. Horseshoe-shaped contusion on the left side of the neck.
Nick: Looks like the heel of a boot.
Dr. Jenna Williams: Oh, I'll buy that -- for now. Multiple contusions front and back. Broken hand.
Nick: Well, this guy's a study in contradictions. 

Nick: He's got defensive wounds on his palms but the scrapes on his knuckles and the broken hand indicate aggression.





 
Grissom: Dr. Kiera Behrle, 3-E. Emily Behrle, 3-F. Nate Metz, 2C.

Grissom: Nate Metz.
Sara: Put your seat back and tray table in their upright position. I don't think so.
Grissom: Let me guess who was sitting in 3C. 
Tony Candlewell. The dead guy.




Nate Metz: Look, the guy was a real ass.
Brass: In what way?
Nate Metz: You know why I fly first class? Other than the fact that my company pays for it? Because I can work. I have to work.
Catherine: And he wouldn't let you?
Nate: No, he, he, he kept kicking the back of my seat with his foot. You know, like in a movie theater when somebody's kicking your seat? Imagine that all the way from Atlanta to Las Vegas.
Catherine: Are you telling me this guy was kicking the back of your seat the entire flight?
Nate: Maybe not the entire flight. You know, like, like Dallas to, to Las Vegas.

Nate:  Hey, Pele, could you please stop kicking the back of my seat?
Tony Candlewell: I wasn't doing anything.
Nate: You know exactly what you're doing. Stop it.


Brass: What did you do?
Nate Metz: I just ... I ignored him. You know, I punched the seat a couple times in anger and that's it. 

Nate Metz: Look, the guy set me off. It was either the seat or him.
Catherine: May I see your hands?

Brass: Your knuckles are pretty banged up.





Grissom: Blood drops ... away from the main event.

Sara: Maybe that's where the action started.
Grissom: Could just be a bloody nose.
Sara: Who was sitting in 4B?

Grissom: Lou Everett.




Brass: Lou Everett?

Lou Everett: Yeah.
Brass: How'd you get that slice around the chops?
Lou Everett: The guy swung at me with a C.D. Put his finger in the hole and slashed me.
Warrick: What guy?
Lou Everett: That crazy guy-- the psycho. He was out of his mind.

Nate Metz:  What the hell is wrong with you? You know, you owe me another laptop, pal.

Tony Candlewell:  Move over!

Shannon: Hey!
Lou Everett: Hey, hey. We're in mid-flight now, guys. That's enough.


Lou Everett: So what do you think? Bodily injury ... can I sue a dead man?
Brass: I think you need some coffee.
Lou Everett: What do you mean?
Brass: A few cocktails on the plane, Lou?
Lou Everett:  Look, I get nervous when I fly. So what?
Warrick: Well, alcohol does different things to different people ... at different altitudes.
Lou Everett: Hey, I was fine. He went bananas. Why don't you just ask ... ask the Flight Attendant?




Shannon: So, we were about 35 minutes out ... when he started pressing his call button over and over. He was complaining of a headache.
Catherine: And did you give him anything?
Shannon: Yeah, I gave him a packet of aspirin and he popped it dry, no water.
Catherine: And, as far as you know did he complain of a headache when he boarded?
Shannon: No.
Catherine: So what made the worm turn?
Shannon: Look, I've been flying for ten years. You know, I have seen it all. I've seen ferrets in suitcases, uh, fellatio in first class ... passengers stir-frying on their tray tables. I mean ... who knows why anyone does anything?

Catherine: Right. Well, thanks for your time.
Shannon: Thank you.


Grissom: So, any bites?

Catherine: Nada. You?
Grissom: If nothing criminal happened on that flight ... why isn't anybody talking to us?
Catherine: I'm going to go out on a limb here ... and say ... they're hiding something?
Grissom: Then we get to play hide-and-seek.








Grissom: I just got off the phone with Nick. The coroner did some carving on our dead guy. She found intercranial bleeding, thoracic hemorrhaging a ruptured spleen. And, for what it's worth the guy also had a fever.  You find anything interesting?
Sara: Well, the guy in 4B was knocking them back pretty good.


Sara: Could be dried blood.


Grissom: Victim had defensive wounds on his hand.

Sara: Marlene Valdez was sitting in 2E.




Marlene Valdez: Look at me. My blouse is ruined. Just hope it washes out.
Max Valdez: We'll get you a new one.
Marlene Valdez: After I saved your life, you better.
Brass:  Mr. Valdez was your life in danger?
Max Valdez: Well, you know ...
Marlene Valdez:  Of course his life was in danger. That maniac was pacing up and down the aisles ... all sweaty ... his eyes glazed. I was sure he was going to hijack that plane.

Shannon: Everyone needs to return to their seats.
Tony Candlewell: Get out of the way!

Marlene Valdez:  Do something.
Max Valdez:  We should just mind our own business.
Marlene Valdez:  Well, if you don't do something, I will.

Max Valdez: Uh... ex-excuse me, sir. Uh... why don't you just take a seat?

 
(GRISSOM and SARA are both kneeling in front of the beverage cart mess in the aisle. GRISSOM holds the bottom half of the wine bottle.
Grissom: The other half of the wine bottle ... from 2E. So ... Marlene in 2E slashes the victim. He's bleeding. Where does he go?

Sara: The lavatory.


Sara: No evidence.

Grissom: No &quot;patent&quot; evidence. But if there's blood present there may be latent evidence.

Sara: One step ahead of you, every so often.
Grissom: Thank you.

Grissom: Well. Would you hand me the Christopher Columbus from my field kit? Thank you.


Sara: I take it that's not blood.
Grissom: No... but there's protein in it.
Sara: Oh, the mile-high club. That means the two passengers may have had no idea what was going on inside that cabin.
Grissom:  You know, high altitude enhances the entire sexual experience. It increases the euphoria.
Sara:  Well ... it's good. I don't know if it's that good.

Sara: Cite your source.
Grissom: Hand me a swab, please.
Sara: You're avoiding the question. &quot;Enhances sexual experience. Increases euphoria.&quot; Cite your source.
Grissom: A magazine.
Sara: What magazine?
Grissom: &quot;Applied Psychodynamics in Forensic Science.&quot;
Sara: Never heard of it.
Grissom: I'll get you a subscription. 

Grissom:  Now, cite your source.
Sara: Oh ... now you want to go down that route?
Grissom: Yeah.
Sara:  Nah. Never mind.
Grissom: You started it.
Sara: Delta Airlines, Flight 1109, Boston-Miami, March '93, Ken Fuller. Hazel eyes, Organic Chem Lab TA, BMOC ... overrated ... in ... every aspect.  Could ... we ... get back to work, please?
Grissom: Yeah. I think, due to your, uh ... firsthand knowledge and experience in airplane bathrooms, you should do the swab.

Sara: Fine.




Catherine: And where were you when this was all going on, Mrs. Finn?
Vicki Mercer: Uh, Mercer, Vicky Mercer. Um, I was in the bathroom.
Catherine: In the bathroom? For how long?
Vicki Mercer: For a while. I ... I really don't fly very well.
Warrick: And where was your husband?
Carl Finn: We're not married. We just work together.
Warrick: Right. Where were you?
Carl Finn: I was in my seat.
CATHERINE So, then you saw what happened?
Carl Finn: I had my headphones on. I was listening to the air traffic control channel. Puts me right out.
Catherine:  So, you ... slept through everything and you woke up next to a ... dead body.
Carl Finn:  Basically, yeah.







Sara: Handprints.  A stallion.




Catherine: All right, we're going to have to change tack here because what I said about getting more flies with honey -- I was wrong.

Warrick: This is incredible. Ten people and no one's talking. My theory: The killer is in the group and the rest of them are afraid.






Sara: That guy was wearing khakis, right?

Grissom: Yeah. 

Grissom: Fibers drawn from his pants maybe?
Sara: We get anything else off the clothes?

Grissom: Nick's working on it.





Nick: What have you got?
Greg Sanders: Well, what you got here is a nice bordeaux and a starbucks blend. No blood. No saliva.
Nick: What about prints?
GREG SANDERS; Well, suede leather's a tough gig. It's too porous.

Nick: Hey. Are you losing your touch there, Einstein?
 
Nick: Coroner's photos of the dead guy's back. Multiple horseshoe-shaped bruises. Those are definitely shoeprints.
Greg Sanders: Yeah. Looks like somebody stomped on your dead guy.




Grissom: Bring me the jacket. If I do heel impressions I'll need something to compare it to. See you in twenty.





Grissom: ... I need their shoes.
Catherine: Why you telling me?
Grissom: Because you're the &quot;people&quot; person, right?
Catherine: Well, why don't you tell them that? They're not giving me bupkus.
Grissom: Please?

Catherine:  Shoes ... off. 

Catherine: Now.






Grissom: I used to have a pair of these.

Warrick: It all comes down to shoeprints.

Sara: Hey.
Catherine: Hi.

Sara:  Looks like a shoe sale. Uh, Nick sent these photo comparisons over from the lab.

Catherine: Oh. Excellent.

Grissom: Max.

Catherine: That looks good.
Grissom: Yeah, that's a match. Okay.

Grissom: That distinctive mark on the circular tread... hmm.

Catherine: Well, that's it then.




Catherine: Okay, folks. I've got some good news ... and I've got some bad news.
Nate Metz: The good news?
Catherine: Well, the good news would be that seven of you may be ... getting out of here very soon.
Lou Everett: What's the bad news?
Catherine: The bad news is that three of you may be staying in Vegas a lot longer than you planned. And that would be ... Mr. Lou Everett, Mr. Max Valdez ... and Dr. Kiera Behrle. Would you ... please come with me.




;







Brass: Stevie, keep these guys on ice.

Brass: I'm sorry, ma'am. This is as far as your daughter can go but we'll have an officer stay with her.
Kiera Berhle: Come on. It's been a rough night.
Catherine: Dr. Behrle, we're going to be asking you some very sensitive questions -- questions that I know that I wouldn't want my daughter to hear.

Brass: Hi. My name is Jim. What's your name?
Emily Berhle: Emily.

Brass: Emily. Oh, that's a great name. Emily, I'm going to make you a deal, okay? We're going to borrow your mom for a little while.
Kiera Berhle:  I'll be right back, sweetie, okay? 

Kiera Berhle: Okay.
Brass: Okay? And here's the good part. You get to borrow anything you see on me.
Emily Berhle: Can I borrow your gun?

Brass: Well, you know, my gun ... it's kind of ... it's old, and it's heavy and ... and it's stuck there. Anything else?
Emily Berhle: How about your badge?
Brass: You got a deal, and you know what? This is the best thing. You know why? Because anyone gives you any trouble all you got to do is ... flash this. There you go.

Brass: So, were you scared?

Brass: Did you see what happened?

Brass: Okay. Okay. It's okay. 





Brass: Sweet kid -- Emily. Uh, so, er ... Behrle ... how long have you been a physician?
Kiera Berhle: I prefer surgeon.
Brass: Okay.
Kiera Berhle: I've been practicing for eleven years.
Brass: And what was the nature of your visit to, uh ... to Las Vegas?
Kiera Berhle: Emily. She wanted to see the white tigers.
Catherine: How did you get that black eye?
Kiera Berhle: I caught it during the ruckus. The price you pay for being a Good Samaritan.
Catherine: Okay. 

Catherine: I'm, uh ... just a little confused. Your heel impressions were found on the back of the victim's suede jacket. 

Catherine: That's a little aggressive for a Good Samaritan.


Tony Candlewell: No! No!

Kiera Berhle: Hey, stop it! 

Kiera Berhle: Oh...

Kiera Berhle: Get out of the way. Get out of the way! Give him some air. Sir?

Kiera Berhle: One, two, three ... one, two ...

Kiera Berhle: If he had been in my E.R., I might have been able to save him, but at thirty thousand feet, there's only so much you can do. Look ... I did what I could.
Catherine: And you're satisfied with that?
Kiera Berhle: Why? Because I'm a doctor I'm responsible for what happened on that plane?
Brass: What did happen?
Kiera Berhle: I protected my daughter and I tried to save a guy's life. And, yes, I'm satisfied with that.
Brass: Well, you've seen cops the tv show, so you know our game. The first one to talk gets to make a deal.
Kiera Berhle: I don't need a deal.
Brass: No? Well, maybe your daughter Emily needs you to take one.





Grissom: Mm-hmm.  Makes sense. Okay. Thanks, Catherine.

Grissom: We have a ping-pong ball. We just need to find the paddles.

Sara: Where are they?
Grissom: Probably in the first compartment.

Grissom: The doctor in 3E told Catherine that she performed CPR on the victim. Check the inside of the paddles. See if there's any bio gel on them.

Sara: These look like they weren't even used. There was more lubricant in the bathroom. It's pretty negligent for a doctor. She's got to know every commercial airline carries defib paddles.
Grissom: Yeah, and if she didn't know, the Flight Attendant sure did.




Shannon: By the time I thought to grab the defibrillator he was already dead.
Catherine: But you are trained to use the paddles in the event of an emergency and this was an emergency situation.
Shannon: Yes, but I'm trained to use them when a man is having cardiac arrest in his seat, not flopping around in the aisle.
Catherine: So, whatever it was he was going through it didn't look a heart attack.
Shannon: Look, I'm going to be honest with you. I was scared. I mean ... I thought this guy was going to take us all down.

Shannon: All right, everyone needs to return to their seats.

Tony Candlewell: Get out of the way! I got to get off!

Catherine: All right, so let me get this straight. 2F is on the floor. His wife is in the aisle brandishing a broken wine bottle. What about 1A? He was closest to the action.
Shannon:  That would be Mr. Cash. Um, he was in his seat.




Warrick: Mr. Cash.
Preston: I was wondering when you guys were going to get around to asking me some questions.
Warrick: So, what did you see?
Preston Cash: Not much.
Grissom: Sir, it's been a long night, and we don't have much time before our crime scene flies away.
Preston Cash: I was in my seat.
Grissom: You were sitting in 1A.
Warrick: Sitting ringside, how do you not see what happened?

Grissom: The blind leading the blind.
Preston Cash: I'm not totally blind. I'm legally blind. My central visual acuity is 20/200.

Shannon:  Take your seat!

Tony Candlewell:  You got to land the plane! I got to get off this plane!

Lou Everett:  Get him off the door! Get him down!


Grissom: Can you identify the voices?
Preston Cash:  First voice. 4B. Businessman. I could tell by the way he ordered drinks.
Grissom: How do you mean?
Preston Cash: JW black, triple, not double.
Warrick: That's Lou.
Preston Cash: Second voice, guy in 2F, kind of far away.

Warrick: Max.
GRISSOM; Third voice?
Preston Cash: Third voice, row behind me, two seats over. Mr. Dot-com. Guy must've typed 60 words a minute.
Warrick: That's Nate.
Grissom: Mr. Cash, you got to help me. I got eight eyewitnesses with various stories. I put them all in a mixing bowl, add eggs, milk stick it in the oven, and all I got is a limp souffle.
Warrick: We need you to tell us everything you heard from the time the deceased banged on the cockpit door to the time he died.
Preston Cash: Then listen up.


Tony Candlewell:  I need to get off this plane! I have to get off this plane!
Lou Everett: Get him off the door.
Kiera Berhle: Get out of the way! Get out of the way!
Emily: Mom-my! Mommeee!
Tony Candlewell: No! No! No!



Preston Cash: I never heard such silence.





Grissom: I got two hours till I lose my crime scene to the Feds. Tell me you have something.
Dr. Jenna Williams: I know what set this guy off.
Grissom: That's more than I got.
Dr. Jenna Williams: We know our victim suffered from intercranial bleeding. I had that pegged as possible cause of death so I crack his skull open, and what do I find? A cantaloupe in a soup can.
Grissom: Tight fit.
Dr. Jenna Williams: And not from one or two blows to the head. He was also running a high fever so I tested his spinal fluid. A normal protein level is between 15 and 45 milligrams. Candlewell's was 60. Did anybody mention this guy had a headache?
Grissom: Flight Attendant gave him two aspirin. Why?
Dr. Jenna Williams: He was suffering from undiagnosed encephalitis.

Grissom: Swelling of the brain.
Dr. Jenna Williams: It can manifest like a heart attack: Slurred speech delirium, loss of consciousness. You throw in the altitude and the air pressure changes in the cabin and our guy was probably out of his mind.
Grissom: Is that what killed him -- encephalitis?
Dr. Jenna Williams: It wasn't the one thing that killed him. Ruptured spleen, intercranial bleeding petecchial hemorrhaging. And the guy's heart just stopped beating.
Grissom: A, B, C, D or all of the above. Standoff with the police -- guy gets shot in the chest, runs back into his burning house inhaling smoke as he goes. The roof collapses the air conditioning unit falls on his head, he dies. What killed him?
FADE OUT








Grissom: Okay, Vicki Mercer and Carl Finn. I believe are in the bathroom.

Warrick: Mile high club.
Catherine: If you ask me, it's their spouses that are the dummies.
Grissom: Emily Behrle is in 3F. 

Grissom: Preston Cash, 1A.

Brass: Tony Candlewell, dead guy.
Grissom: Right there, 3C. And for now, he's alive until he's dead.

Brass: So, you want to tell us what we're doing here?

Grissom: The physical evidence that Sara, Nick, and I collected is contradicting the anecdotal statements that you, Catherine, and Warrick got and my money's on the physical evidence.
Catherine: So is mine. These passengers are lying.
Grissom: I mean, if this was an arson case, we'd burn down an empty house to prove our theory, right? Well, in this case we're going to recreate the flight from... 1630 hours on. You are in 4B.

Brass:  Lou.
Catherine: Lou -- the angry businessman. How about that?
Sara: I want to be Shannon. Good.

Warrick: The stewardess.
Sara: Excuse me -- it's &quot;Flight Attendant&quot;.
Grissom: Catherine-- the doctor, 3E.

Catherine: Single mom. What an imagination you have.
Grissom: Max and Marlene, 2E and F. You two are married. Who wants to wear the pants?
Nick: CSI-3 seniority, &quot;sweetie&quot;.

Warrick: Yeah, whatever. You're henpecked anyway.
Sara: Let me guess -- you're the computer geek.
Grissom: In the interest of clarity, yes. Nate in 2C.

Grissom: Okay, look, it's going to be sunrise in ten minutes. We're going to have to do a run, lola, run and play this in literal time. Up until the point that Captain Murdle escorted the dead guy back to his seat the events are substantiated by the flight log and the eyewitness statements unless anybody knows something different.
Catherine: What time was that?
Grissom: 1632 hours -- exactly 33 minutes before they landed in Vegas. One minute later, the plane hit turbulence.
Brass: And, according to the Flight Attendant that's when our stiff lost it and started hammering his call button.
Sara: So, I walk over ...

Sara:  ... try to calm the guy down, but he won't quit.


Grissom:  Well, we know he's suffering from encephalitis. He's probably sweating and fighting back a migraine.

Brass: I know what my guy's doing in my seat -- Lou. He's getting ticked off.
Grissom: Yeah, but Candlewell is ticking off Nate in 2C even worse. I mean, this guy is perseverating. 

Grissom:  Uncontrollably kicking at the seat.

Brass: That's when he winds up and breaks your seat.
Grissom: So, I get up, spin around ...

Grissom:  ... confront the guy.

Warrick: Now, Lou, in 4B, said he was the peacemaker.
Brass: Peacemaker, my ass.  He's got three empties in the pouch.

Brass:  Seat reeks of whiskey.

Brass: The guy probably spilled Lou's drink.
Catherine:  Very good.
Brass: I was boss at CSI once. For a reason.

Brass: Anyway, Lou gets up. He's angry. He takes a swipe at the guy. After knocking a few back at 33,000 feet you know, probably misses. And what does he get for his trouble?

Warrick: A CD swipe across the chops.
Brass: Right. So he falls back ... Well ... maybe Lou ... 

Brass: ... spills his own drink.

Grissom: By this time, Candlewell's got to be out of his seat, right?


Nick:  If I'm Max, I want no part of this.

Nick: Plus, I don't have an aisle seat.
Brass: Yeah, but you're lucky. Your wife is going to make sure that you get in the playing field.
Warrick:  Yeah, go ahead, honey. Save my life.

Nick:  Right. Max gets up ...


Nick: ... slides across Marlene. Excuse me, &quot;buttercup&quot;.
Grissom:  Candlewell's moving up and down the aisle by now.
Nick: I come over confront the dead guy. Then what?  Who talked to 2F? To Max?
Brass:  I did. Max told the dead guy to sit down. He turned, he shoved Max into the food cart 


Brass:  ... Max landed on the ground.

Sara: Warrick -- I mean, &quot;Marlene&quot; -- that's when you got up and grabbed the broken wine neck.

Warrick: Saved Nick's butt, as usual.
Grissom: There's a bottle of wine on the floor.

Grissom:  You slash at Candlewell ...

Brass: Then he swipes him across the hand. Hence the defensive wound.
Grissom: Now our guy's bleeding. He turns and heads for the cockpit.

Grissom: Bang, bang. He wants in the cockpit ...

Grissom:  ... but the door is locked. 

Grissom: Captain Murdle gets on the horn calls first class twice. No answer. Why?
Sara: Shannon's vapor-locked.
Grissom: He can't get in the cockpit. What's next? 

Grissom: He heads for the exit door. Blood underneath the latch handle shows that Candlewell tried to open it.

Grissom:  And, if he gets the door open, they all die.

Brass: Now it's a whole new ball game. It's every man for himself.

Nick:  Oh, yeah.

Nick:  This is when they really get scared.
Warrick:  And, according to Preston, Max and Lou they got to Candlewell first.

Grissom: The struggle ensued. Max and Lou slammed into Preston

Grissom: ... and, at some point, Candlewell goes down. Now it's a free-for-all.

Catherine: And my shoes end up on his back.
Nick: Mine, too.
Brass: Ditto.
Warrick: He's messing with my man, so I get my licks in.
Grissom: Nate's knuckles were bruised ... so he was in on it.
Brass: We're in close quarters, so there's elbows flying everywhere.
Catherine: That's probably how the doctor got her black eye.
Brass: Right.

Sara: Hey, guys! If you jump a guy at the exit, he dies at the exit.


Brass: Yeah. And our guy...

Brass: ... was found five feet away ... with his head towards coach.


Nick:  He tried to get away.
Warrick:  But they didn't let him.
Catherine:  And, at this point we're not individuals anymore -- we're a mob.
Emily: Mommy! Mommy!


Catherine: And you can't perform CPR on a man's back. Dr. Behrle had to have rolled him over ... 

Catherine:  ... probably just to cover for herself.

Grissom: That makes us all murderers.





Grissom: I want five of those passengers arrested for murder.
Sheriff Brian Mobley: Oh, that's four more than I anticipated.
Grissom: We looked at the evidence, and the evidence says five.
Sheriff Brian Mobley: Let me get this straight. Five strangers get on a plane and then, together, they kill a man.
Grissom: On the surface, self-defense. They thought Candlewell was bringing the plane down.
Sheriff Brian Mobley: And he would have.
Grissom: But he didn't. They stopped him, and then they killed him -- not as individuals, but as a mob.
Sheriff Brian Mobley: Let's cut to the chase, Gil. Can you prove your case?
Grissom: Not yet. I need more time.

Sheriff Brian Mobley: Well, time's up. I'm going to give these people their walking papers. If the Feds want to pursue it, let them.
Grissom: Don't do that.
Sheriff Brian Mobley: Oh, come on. No jury's going to ever convict them.
Grissom: You don't know that, Brian.
Sheriff Brian Mobley: Look, if you or I were on that plane we would do whatever it takes to save our lives.
Grissom: That's what a jury would say. That's not what the evidence says.
Sheriff Brian Mobley: That's exactly my point.





Reporter :  Las Vegas Air has issued no formal comment other than to stand by the actions taken by the flight crew. Meanwhile, the first-class passengers from the flight have been released ...



Reporter :  ... and no charges will be filed. The airline provided a bus to their Las Vegas destinations. Our request for interviews were denied, leaving the events surrounding the death of Tony Candlewell a mystery.

Sara: Hey.
Nick: Whoa.
Warrick: Let it go, guys.
Sara: Those people should be going to jail not some hotel on the Strip.
Warrick: It's out of our hands. Our field ruling was overturned by the good old Sheriff and the Feds.
Nick: And you're okay with that? We processed evidence for twelve hours laid out the whole case and now those passengers are going to suck martinis and eat shrimp cocktails? Where's the justice?
Warrick: Oh, you think this is about justice?
Nick: Yeah. What else?
Grissom: It's about human nature -- how people react when their lives are threatened.
Sara: I know you're not condoning what they did.
Warrick: I'm not discounting it. I mean, think about it -- is there anyplace more vulnerable than being at thirty thousand feet in a tin can?
Sara: Feeling &quot;vulnerable&quot; is not a defense and where they were is irrelevant. They took a life.
Warrick: Because their lives were threatened.
Nick: Their lives were threatened when Candlewell was at the emergency exit trying to open it, but the five feet between the exit and the aisles is what made the difference between self-defense and murder.
Warrick: Human nature again. I mean, adrenaline doesn't come with an off switch.

Sara: I don't care what you say. I could never take a life.
Warrick: If it was between him or me, I could. Nick?

Nick: I don't know.
Catherine: Well ... it's wicked serious in here.
Sara: Yeah, well, we were just talking about murder and whether we would commit it. I couldn't, Warrick could and Nick's on the fence. We're taking an exit poll.
Nick: Catherine, you're a mother. You and Lindsey are on that plane. How far do you go?
Catherine: All the way.
Sara:  You didn't even hesitate.
Catherine: That's right. If it involves the protection of my child I fight to the death.
Warrick: See? We have four people here, all with different opinions. Think of how the passengers must have felt.
Sara: What do you think, Grissom?
Grissom: I can't answer that question.
Catherine: That's a cop-out. It's a simple question. What would you have done if you had been one of those passengers?
Grissom: It's not about that. You all have different opinions but you've taken the same point of view. You've put yourself in the shoes of the passengers, but nobody's put themselves in the shoes of the victim. That's the point.
Sara: I'm sorry. What are you saying?
Grissom: Nobody stopped to ask Candlewell if he was all right. They just assumed, because he was kicking the back of Nate's seat, that he was a jerk -- because he was pushing his call button that he was bothering the Flight Attendant -- because he was trying to get into the lavatory he was making a scene -- because he was going back and forth up and down the aisles, he was posing a threat.
Catherine: He was a threat.
Grissom: No. He turned into a threat. It didn't have to be that way. People make assumptions. That's the problem. You just did. And I think these passengers made the wrong assumption and now this guy's dead.
Warrick: Well, if that's your stance how could it have been prevented?
Grissom: If just one person had stopped and taken the time to look at the guy to listen to him, to figure out what was wrong with him it might not have happened. It took five people to kill him. It would have only taken one person to save his life.

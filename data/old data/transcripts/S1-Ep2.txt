Gil Grissom: Hi, sorry. Welcome to Forensics. Gil Grissom, I'm your supervisor on grayayard.
Holly Gribbs: Holly Gribbs.




Jim Brass:  Well, congratulations, Gribbs. You're the fifth person I've been forced to hire. 
Holly Gribbs: Well, that's not fair.
Jim Brass: Putting a juiced-in Lieutenant's daughter on the shift is fair?


Holly Gribbs: I'm fulfilling her dreams, not mine.
Catherine Willows: I can sit here, and I can baby you and I can tell you to quit, but I'm not going to do that at least until you've solved your first, and if, after that, you don't feel like King Kong on cocaine, then you can quit.


Jim Brass: Grissom!

Jim Brass: Have Warrick shadow Gribbs for the next three weeks or until Nicky makes his 100th, whatever comes first.
Warrick: People walk every day because of you.
Gil Grissom: That's enough. Warrick, let's go!


(GRISSOM talks with WARRICK
Gil Grissom: The minute you started thinking about yourself instead of the case, you lost him.


Warrick Brown: You be okay on your own?
Holly Gribbs: Are you kidding? I'm fired up, ready to go. Besides, there's an officer here.


Warrick Brown: I'm sorry, Judge. Captain Brass wouldn't call you for a search warrant. I got a whopper on the line with a 100 pound test.
Judge Cohen: You got a winner for me?
Warrick Brown: Favre.
Judge Cohen: You put $5,000 down on the Pack for me I'll give you a blank warrant.


Gil Grissom: Congratulations, Nicky, my boy. You are now a C.S.I. Level three.
Nick Stokes: Woo! 


Warrick Brown:  Woo-hoo! Yeah! I'll be right there. 

Warrick Brown: Uh, give me 'Niners for five dimes.




Gil Grissom: Weren't you supposed to be shadowing holly?
Warrick Brown: Oh. She's cool. She's doing prints on that 4-0-7. There's an officer there.



Jerrod Cooper: Excuse me, miss.



Jim Brass: Holly Gribbs has been shot. They don't think she's going to make it.








Jamie: Hey, look. Oh, $40 million. Could you imagine?
Ted Sallenger: Never happen. You got a better chance of going to the moon.
Jamie: Oh, give me a $20. Hurry! I just got a premonition.
Ted Sallenger: You got your own money. Go play.
Jamie: But I left my purse in the room.

Ted Sallenger: I'll play. Wait here.

Clerk:  Is this your slot card?
Ted Sallenger: No.


Ted Sallenger: Your little premonition has cost me $20. Happy now? Here.

Ted Sallenger:  Watch out. Here come the millions.

Jamie:  Oh, my God! 


Jamie: We won!








Elias Templeton: $40 million. You'll be having lobster tonight.

Jamie:  They gave us the presidential suite. Can you believe it?
Elias Templeton: Here, Richard Gere, why don't you let me help you with that?

Ted Sallenger: Thank you.



Jamie: Oh! Look at our view! 

Jamie: Wow!

Ted Sallenger:  Take a hike. 

Ted Sallenger: Get lost.

Jamie: Excuse me?
Ted: Come on, Jamie. I'm a millionaire now. Now, why would I want to waste anymore time with you?

Voice Outside:  Room service?





Gil Grissom:  All right, the minute you hear anything on Holly Gribbs's condition I want you to page me. 

Gil Grissom:  All right? Bye.

Dispatcher:  ... Call back at 4-7-7 Desert Inn Road.
Gil Grissom: So he pulled a &quot;Louganis&quot;, huh?
Detective Barns: Yeah, 150 feet. The giga-millions curse strikes again. Past four winners ended up dead or missing. What do you think, Grissom? It's a conspiracy.
Gil Grissom: Coincidence. I worked those four cases. There was never any evidence of foul play. Was he in town with anybody?
Detective Barns: His girlfriend. She's upstairs in police custody. Do you want to talk to her?
Gil Grissom: Not yet. Right now, I want to talk to him.
Detective Barns: How do you talk to a dead body?

Gil Grissom: I let him talk to me, actually. 

Gil Grissom: In fact, he just spoke. Didn't you hear him? He just told me that he didn't commit suicide.

Detective Barns: No. You-you lost me.
Gil Grissom: This guy fell to his death wearing prescription eyeglasses. Jumpers take their glasses off. Suicide is the ultimate form of selfishness, Detective. It's unlikely that anyone cowardly enough to take his own life would be brave enough to watch his own death.
Detective Barns:  You can tell all that just by looking at a pair of eyeglasses?
Gil Grissom: You have no idea.







Gil Grissom: Messages?






Gil Grissom: I just got off the phone with the Sheriff. He says he wants me to run the unit.
Jim Brass: You're the boss. 

Jim Brass: I mean, I can't say I didn't do it to myself.
Gil Grissom: Where are they going to place you?
Jim Brass: Homicide. Believe that?

Jim Brass: Instead of moving up, I'm moving back in a time capsule, like it's
1979 again. So, I guess, this might put you and me at odds.

Gil Grissom: Cop versus scientist. Interesting, huh?

Jim Brass:  Yeah.

Gil Grissom: You got any advice for me? 
Jim Brass: Yeah, cover your ass ... and hide. They're all yours, pal.




Paula Francis:  Tragedy struck early this morning when an on-duty Las Vegas Criminalist was brutally gunned down. 


Paula Francis:  It was her first night on the job. Victim Holly Gribbs was investigating a robbery/homicide in an apartment on the corner of M.L.K. and Warm Springs.

Paula Francis:  The crime lab now faces the daunting task of investigating the shooting of one of their own. The wounded C.S.I. has been taken to Desert Palm where she is listed in critical condition. The suspect is still at large. 
Newscaster :  In other news ...

Catherine Willows: Weren't you supposed to be shadowing Holly?
Nick Stokes: Warrick, man, what happened?
Warrick Brown: I left her to hook up with Grissom on that toenail case ... and then, I came back here.
Catherine Willows: You left Holly solo?
Warrick Brown: It was just supposed to be an easy print job. Look, I feel bad enough, okay?

Gil Grissom: Here's what we know. Brass assigned Warrick to shadow Holly on a robbery. 

Gil Grissom: He left her at the scene. The suspect returned and Holly was shot. The sheriff phoned me earlier this morning. Brass has been moved back to homicide.
Nick Stokes: Who's going to run the unit?
Gil Grissom: For now? Me. 

Gil Grissom:  I know. We'll just play it by ear, okay? 

Gil Grissom: All right. Last night, a jackpot winner took a swan dive off the Hotel Monaco about the time Holly was shot. I'm going to work the leaper. Nick?
Nick Stokes:  Yes, sir.
Gil Grissom: You work the Holly case.

Catherine Willows: Wait a minute. Uh, you-you can't give him the Holly case. I mean, all due respect, Nick. I want this one.
Gil Grissom: Nicky is the only one that didn't have any personal contact with Holly. I don't want you on this, Cath.
Catherine Willows: Why?
Gil Grissom: Because you're emotionally involved.
Catherine Willows: Yeah. She was going to walk. I convinced her to stay. If anyone's to blame here, it's me, and I want this case. 

Catherine Willows: Fire me.
Gil Grissom: I'm not firing anybody. Look. I know we're pulling a double. We're on edge 'cause of Holly. I just want everyone to stay calm and to do their jobs for the next ten hours. And as of now we're short of help. So, I'm bringing in Sara Sidle to give us a hand. 
Catherine Willows: Sara Sidle?
Warrick Brown: Who's that?
Gil Grissom: She's a CSI out of San Francisco. She's a friend of mine, someone I trust. She's going to handle our internal investigation and I want to keep this in-house. I don't want I.A. Involved.

Catherine Willows:  Great, that's just what we need, somebody sniffing around.

Gil Grissom: Nicky, you can back me up on the D.B. at the Monaco.

Nick Stokes: You got it.
Gil Grissom: That's it.

Warrick Brown: That's it? What about me?
Gil Grissom: You're on leave. You get some personal time.
Warrick Brown: I don't want any personal time. I want to help. You're the boss now. You can reinstate me.
Gil Grissom: Go home, Warrick. Get your story straight before Sara gets here.






Catherine Willows: A little late for the brigade.
Officer: What do you think happened here?

Catherine Willows: First blush?

Jerrod Cooper:  Don't move.

Holly Gribbs: Hey, it's okay. I'm not a cop. I just ... I just analyze the scene.




Catherine Willows: This is Holly's gun. 

Catherine Willows: She shot back.






Dr. Jenna Williams: He's all rigored up. Now pull it like a slot machine. It's been three weeks since my last jumper. At least this one died a millionaire.

Gil Grissom: Geez, these look like defensive wounds, maybe.
Nick Stokes: Somebody came after this guy with something pretty sharp.
Gil Grissom: You have any idea what it might be?
Dr. Jenna Williams: Glass, maybe. We found tiny shards in the incised wound. 

Dr. Jenna Williams: Take a look.
Gil Grissom: Not just glass ...

Gil Grissom: ... black glass.





Nick Stokes: Broken glass.

Gil Grissom: Blood drops, leading to ... bloody towels. No effort to hide.
Nick Stokes: Hey! 

Nick Stokes: Defensive wounds.
Gil Grissom: Champagne bottle. Black glass. I missed that.

Nick Stokes: What do you think, boss?
Gil Grissom: You're C.S.I. three, now. You call it.
Nick Stokes: What? You want me to play it blind?
Gil Grissom: You've read the woman's statement. The room is full of evidentiary clues. 

Gil Grissom: Talk it out. What does the room say?

Nick Stokes: Okay. Well, according to the girlfriend's statement they were on the balcony when they had a lovers' quarrel.

Ted Sallenger: Come on, Jamie. I'm a millionaire now. Now, why would I want to waste any more time with you?




Nick Stokes: ... room service.

Ted Sallenger: Thank you.
Bellboy: You're welcome.

Jamie:  So what was I this whole time, huh? Just someone to bang?
Ted Sallenger: Yeah.

Jamie:  Why?

Ted Sallenger: Crazy broad!

Gil Grissom:  And then what happened?




Jamie: He took off. I cut him up pretty good. He probably went to the lobby to fetch some first aid.
Gil Grissom: And he never came back to the room?
Jamie: No.
Gil Grissom: You sure? The Presidential Suite at the Hotel Monaco is a secured room. They keep a log. Every time someone enters with a card key ...
Jamie: Well, if they keep a record check it for yourself. Why are you bothering me?
Gil Grissom: Nicky, what does the log say?
Nick Stokes: Well, she's right. The only entry I see here is when hotel security checked them in.
Jamie: Can I go now?
Gil Grissom: Yes, ma'am. 

Gil Grissom: Her story checks out.

Gil Grissom: She doesn't have any financial motive. She was his girlfriend, not his wife. Any money won by the deceased goes directly to the family estate.
Nick Stokes: Well, if he didn't fall from his own balcony where else could it have happened?

Gil Grissom: The roof.





Warrick Brown: 
Patient's name is Holly Gribbs.  Thanks.

Warrick Brown:  Warrick here. 
Judge Cohen:  Warrick, Judge Cohen. You bet the wrong team, you idiot. 


Judge Cohen:  I said Packers. I got the 49ers for five grand. The spot in fifteen minutes.









Gil Grissom: Okay, I think we're ready for Operation Norman.

Gil Grissom:  You'll never get that off. It's Meyer's roof dust. All the hotels use it now. It diverts the sun's rays. Keeps the utility bills down in the summer.
Nick Stokes: Yeah? How do you know all this crap?
Gil Grissom: It's our job to know stuff.




Gil Grissom:  All right, Nick, standing by for Operation Norman. Let him fly.

Spectator : Oh!




Gil Grissom: Yes, yes.

Gil Grissom: Norman &quot;pushed&quot;.

Gil Grissom: Norman &quot;jumped&quot;.

Gil Grissom: Norman &quot;fell&quot;.
Sara Sidle:  Wouldn't you if you were married to Mrs. Roper?

Gil Grissom: I don't even have to turn around. Sara Sidle.
Sara Sidle: That's me. Still tossing simulation dummies? There are other ways to tell, you know?
Gil Grissom: How? Computer simulation? No thanks. I'm a scientist I like to see it. Newton dropped the apple, I drop dummies.
Sara Sidle: You're old school.
Gil Grissom: Exactly. And this guy was pushed.

Sara Sidle: How's the girl?
Gil Grissom: She's still in surgery. She's not doing very well.
Sara Sidle: That's too bad.
Gil Grissom: God, Sara, I have so many unanswered &quot;why&quot;s.
Sara Sidle: There's only one why that matters now. Why did Warrick Brown leave that scene?




Judge Cohen: What are you, dyslexic? You owe me ten grand, buddy.

Warrick Brown: All I got is four.

Judge Cohen: So what are you breathing here for? Get out there and get my money.
Warrick Brown: Hey, look, a girl was shot on my watch 'cause I was doing you a favor.
Judge Cohen: Hey, you came to me.
Warrick Brown: All right, Judge, I'll get your money but I need more time. You got to give me a day.
Judge Cohen: You got an hour.





Sara Sidle: Do you know where I can find Catherine Willows? 
Catherine Willows:  She's out in the field. 

Catherine Willows: Let me guess ... Sara Sidle?
Sara Sidle: I know who I am. I think you're a little confused.
Catherine Willows: If you think you're taking my case ... forget it.

Sara Sidle: Look, we can stand here and argue ... or ... we can get out there and find out who did this to Holly Gribbs.  Two sharp women are better than one.

Catherine Willows: Pager. 

Catherine Willows: Found at the crime scene.

Sara Sidle: Where'd you get the pager nest?
Catherine Willows: Grissom. He won it on e-bay.
Sara Sidle: They're great for tracing if you can rely on the suspect's honesty.

Catherine Willows: Uh ... Desmond Tutu.
Sara Sidle: See what I mean? Don't feel bad. My last four traces came back Eminem,  ... so ... look, you seem to have everything under control here.
Sara Sidle: Where can I find Warrick Brown?
Catherine Willows: Try one of the casinos on Blue Diamond Road.

Catherine Willows:  Oh, I'll page you with any information.







Gil Grissom: There's our jumper.
Surveillance Director: So, you want to see everything one minute before and one minute after he won the jackpot, right?
Gil Grissom:  Please.

Gil Grissom: Wait a minute. Go back. 

Gil Grissom:  Could I see the person that was sitting at this machine right before the victim?
Surveillance Director: Sure.

Gil Grissom: Is there any way of telling how long he was sitting there?

Surveillance Director: 11 hours, 13 minutes ... 15 seconds. At three bucks a tug, hell, he could have gone through ten, 20 thou.

Gil Grissom: Nick, call the slot host. Get this guy's name from the slot card. I'm going to talk to this man.





Bobby Dawson: All right. Here you go. Holly's weapon's already loaded. So, just point at the gun entry hole there to do your test fire.
Catherine Willows: Okay, thanks, Bobby.

CAMERA SLOW MOTION






Bobby Dawson: Okay, now, in order to eliminate Holly's gun as the possible weapon we start by looking for imperfections in the bullet's stria ... now, that's odd.
Catherine Willows: What's wrong?
Bobby Dawson: We don't have an elimination. We got a match.

Catherine Willows: Shot her with her own gun.

Holly Gribbs: It's okay, I'm not a cop. I just ... I just analyze the scene.

Jerrod Cooper: Throw the gun down! 

Jerrod Cooper: All right now, yank the phone out of the wall. I'm taking my prints with me.









Floor Clerk : I pulled the slot card for you.  That's the gentleman, right over there.
Gil Grissom: Thank you.
Floor Clerk : Mm-hmm. 

Gil Grissom: Hold this. I think I'll play a little.

Red Carlton: Double down, always get a winner. Oh, yes, a winner. The winner. Double nine.
Gil Grissom:  You're under arrest.
Red Carlton: Oh yeah? What for?
Gil Grissom: First-degree murder.
Red Carlton: Oh. On what grounds?

Gil Grissom: Roof dust.
Security Officers: Sir, would you please come with us?

Gil Grissom:  Nicky, my boy, collect my winnings. It's a C.S.I. three initiation.






Dealer: You're up 11 G's. Hit or stay?

Sara Sidle: Stay. I want to talk to you. 




 
Sara Sidle: You were playing $100 on every spot. You have a system?
Warrick Brown: I'm counting cards.
Sara Sidle: Isn't that illegal?
Warrick Brown: Not if you do the math in your head.
Sara Sidle: You play anything else?
Warrick Brown: I bet sports from time to time.
Sara Sidle: So ... let me get this straight. You were assigned by Brass to shadow a trainee, a robbery comes up on M.L.K, and you go for coffee.
Warrick Brown: An officer was there.
Sara Sidle: So, you felt safe to leave? Do you know the policies and procedures for clearing a scene?
Warrick Brown: Yes.
Sara Sidle: Then, why'd you leave? I mean, what was so important that you had to rush out of there?
Warrick Brown: I told you. I went for coffee.
Sara Sidle: Was that before or after you made your bets? Sunday ... Vegas ... NFL football ... guy like you ... come on, you trying to tell me that you didn't make a little pit stop? 

Sara Sidle: Look at me. Did you log on ... tell dispatch where you were going?
Warrick Brown: Do you know how many times I've been left alone at a crime scene when I was a rookie?
Sara Sidle: Yeah, well, this time is different.
Warrick Brown: Yeah, why's that?
Sara Sidle: Holly Gribbs died on the operating table twenty minutes ago.








;






Sara Sidle: Mind if I get a soda?

Catherine Willows: Oh, yeah. Sorry.

Sara Sidle: You want one? 

Catherine Willows: Is there anything in there with alcohol?
Sara Sidle: Root beer.
Catherine Willows: No.


Catherine: Oh ... god.

Sara Sidle:  What are you going to say? &quot;Hi, I'm a Criminalist. I was in the neighborhood ... &quot;
Catherine Willows: Shh. It's ringing.


Jerrod Cooper:  Hello.
Catherine Willows:  Uh, hey.
Jerrod Cooper: Who's this? I just dialed my own damn beeper.
Catherine Willows: Uh-uh. It's my beeper now. I found it.
Jerrod Cooper: It ain't your beeper, girl. It's mine. 

Jerrod Cooper: I do a lot of business on that beeper.
Catherine Willows: What kind of business?
Jerrod Cooper: You know -- slinging a little something-something.
Catherine Willows: Oh, a little something-something. Or maybe a little bling-bling?
Jerrod Cooper: So what you know about some bling-bling?
Catherine Willows: Well, invite me over to your crib, baby and you might find out.
Jerrod Cooper: It's on. Three Aces Motel, Room 202.
Catherine Willows: Three Aces Motel, Room 202.

Jerrod Cooper: See you soon.

Catherine Willows: Did I just do that?
Sara Sidle: What's a &quot;bling-bling&quot;?
Catherine Willows: Got me.





Red Carlton: Yeah, I was up on that roof. I didn't push him off. I did talk to him, though.
Nick Stokes: We know. Hey, what did you drink? Gin and tonic or amaretto sours?
Red Carlton: Amaretto sours. How'd you know that?
Nick Stokes: We got a record of the victim's room charges. Chief.
Gil Grissom: At 1:27 A.M. Our victim, Ted Sallenger, made a couple of purchases in the gift shop--

Gil Grissom:  ... band-aids and antiseptic. At 1:40 A.M ...

Gil Grissom: ... we tracked a purchase at the la promenade--

Gil Grissom:  ... a $30,000 designer watch. 


Gil Grissom: At 1:45 A.M., you both started knocking them back in the hotel bar.

Ted Sallenger: Sweet.

Red Carlton: Hey. You won my money.
Ted Sallenger: What?
Red Carlton: That was my machine. I put everything I had in that machine. 
Ted Sallenger: So you're a degenerate. What do you want from me? 

Ted Sallenger: Hey, old timer, come on, sit down. I'll buy you a drink for second place. What are you having? It's on me.
Red Carlton: It's on you? All right. In that case, I'll have a, uh ... Amaretto Sour.

Nick Stokes: The first hour, you both drank tit for tat but by hour two, Ted started ordering doubles ... and you quit drinking.
Gil Grissom: Drank decaf coffee instead. My guess is that you were getting him lathered up for your little elevator ride.

Ted Sallenger: Have a nice life, huh? I know I will.

Gil Grissom: And from there, you went to the roof.

Red Carlton:  I couldn't go through with it. I'm a born failure. I failed at my marriage; I failed at my work. Then I couldn't even commit suicide right. One pull away ... the story of my life.
Gil Grissom: Mr. Carlton, we're not detectives. We're crime scene analysts. We're trained to ignore verbal accounts and rely instead on the evidence a scene sets before us. But I have to be honest with you, Red ... I believe you. I do.
 So ... here's what we're going to do: You're going to stay here until we get back. If you pushed this guy off the roof he will, without a doubt, have roof dust on his shoes. If he does, we'll have you arrested for murder. But if dust is not present, then you'll be free to go.

Red Carlton: I like this guy.





Catherine Willows: What are you doing here?

Jim Brass: Guilt therapy.

Jim Brass: Police officers! Open up!


Officer: Get down. OFFICER: Hold him down on the ground! OFFICER: Put your hands behind your back! OFFICER: Get him down!

Catherine Willows: Now that's a bling-bling.
Jerrod Cooper: That was you on the phone?
Catherine Willows:  Yep.

Catherine Willows: Where'd you get that scratch?

Sara Sidle: For a conviction, we're going to need a DNA sample.
Jim Brass: Okay, let's sit him down. Let's get a saliva sample.
Catherine Willows:  Hey, guys, it's Catherine.

Catherine Willows:  For whoever is listening we got him. Repeat. Holly Gribbs' suspect is in custody.





Warrick Brown: Ten Thousand. See you around, Judge.

Judge Cohen: You don't leave until I tell you to leave.
Warrick Brown: What? What are you going to do, hold me in contempt?
Judge Cohen: You're already in contempt with me. We're in bed, pal. I own you.
Warrick Brown: Nobody owns me.
Judge Cohen: Yeah? Let me tell you something. You ever heard of a wolf in sheep's clothing? You and me -- we're going to do business together whether you like it or not. Keep your cell phone charged.



[INT. FORENSIC AUTOPSY - FORENSIC SCIENCE/LABORATORIES DIVISION - HALLWAY --
DAY]

Catherine Willows: You didn't have to come.
Gil Grissom: I know. I wanted to. In case you need me.
Catherine Willows: I probably do. But this is something I'd rather do alone.

Gil Grissom: Fifteen seconds, you're in, you're out we make a DNA match and it's over, okay?
Catherine Willows:  Okay.





Catherine Willows:  I'm sorry.




Nick Stokes: Will the real Red Skelton please ... stand up?
Gil Grissom: You're too young to remember who Red Skelton was.
Nick Stokes: Hey, Nick at Nite. You should check it out. 

Nick Stokes: No dust. Great.
Gil Grissom: I thought so. Turns out he's red herring. There's got to be something else. 

Gil Grissom: Nice watch.

Gil Grissom: Look at this. 

Gil Grissom: These look like fibers.
Nick Stokes: Yeah. You think he was dragged?
Gil Grissom: Maybe.
Nick Stokes: Well, I'll go back to the Presidential Suite ... take a swatch of the carpet, see if we can match the fibers.
Gil Grissom: Get a hold of the girl while you're at it.
Nick Stokes: Why, is she a suspect?
Gil Grissom: She is now.



 

Grissom: All right. What do you have?
Dr. Jenna Williams: Hey. I thought you might like to see this.

Gil Grissom: What the hell is that?
Dr. Jenna Williams: I found it after I shaved his head. Something hard with a diamond insignia on the back. You find that, I bet you find your killer.
Gil Grissom: Was this first blow?
Dr. Jenna Williams: First and fatal. Crushed his skull. So he was killed, then he was pushed.
Dr. Jenna Williams: Without a doubt.




Sara Sidle: Nicorette?
Catherine Willows: No, thanks. Got my own.

Greg Sanders: Boss, your DNA results are back. 

Greg Sanders: Well, according to my DNA data the types are 814 quadrillion to one that your suspect is our killer.
Sara Sidle: Pretty good stats! Whoo!
Catherine: Yeah, considering there's only about six billion people in the world ... ah, thanks.

Catherine Willows: She gave me just enough ... just enough to catch him.

Jerrod Cooper: Don't move!

Holly Gribbs: Hey, hey, it's okay. I'm not a cop. I just ... I just analyze the scene. This is my first day. Believe me, I'm-I'm no threat. 

Holly Gribbs: Um, look ... phone with your prints on it? Here, take it. Okay? Here.

Catherine Willows:  but she held on long enough to give us a clue.



Sara Sidle: Nice work, Catherine.










Gil Grissom: Nice swatch, Nick. Pizza box-sized.



Gil Grissom: Grissom. 
Nick Stokes:  It's Nick. I just finished the carpet swatch comparisons. Got a match.
Gil Grissom: I'm starting to get that feeling, Nicky, my boy.
Nick Stokes:  Yeah, so am I.
Gil Grissom: Listen, I'll meet you at the interrogation. I still got one more thing I want to check.
Nick Stokes:  Okay. Bye. 



[INT. HOTEL MONACO - HALLWAY IN FRONT OF PRESIDENTIAL SUITE - ROOM 1227 - DAY -
CONTINUOUS]

Gil Grissom: Okay, I'm ready to try this now.
Elias Templeton:  Stand by, house.

Gil Grissom: Did your security log record that?
Elias Templeton:  No. Well, I'll be damned. The curse. Hell, I ain't playing those machines no more. It's true. You win, you die.

Gil Grissom:  Gotcha.




Jamie: Got me with what?
Gil Grissom: Capital murder.
Jamie: Oh, are you kidding me?
Gil Grissom: I never kid about murder. What do you think, Nick? My turn to play it &quot;blind&quot;?

Ted Sallenger: Hey, Red, have a nice life, huh?  I know I will.


Ted Sallenger: What the ... ? What the hell's with this thing?


Gil Grissom:  Now, the funny thing is if Ted didn't come back to the room then why were presidential carpet fibers found in the band of his brand-new watch? 'Cause he did come back. 


Gil Grissom:  And you do the smart thing: After you throw him over the balcony you cleaned up the crime scene. You left blood-soaked towels in plain sight. Your alibi? The blood came from Ted's forearms.

Gil Grissom: How am I doing so far, Nicky?
Nick Stokes: Yeah, I'm into it.
Gil Grissom: According to your statement, you felt slighted 'cause Ted had just won $40 million and dumped you within half an hour giving you motive enough to kill him and you exercised that motive.


Nick Stokes: Can I ask you a question?
Jamie: Sure.
Nick Stokes: How are you so cool? You took someone's life. Don't you care?
Jamie: No.

Gil Grissom: Deputy, we're going to have her arrested.
Jamie:  So, could I ask you a question?
Gil Grissom: Maybe.
Jamie: All that stuff you rattled off. How'd you know about all that?
Gil Grissom: Your boyfriend told me.





Gil Grissom:  I'll see you outside, okay?

Gil Grissom: They say I have to let you go. You violated the policies and procedures for clearing a scene. I read Sara's report.
Warrick Brown: I know. I messed up. And Holly's dead. 

Warrick Brown: I'm sorry, Gil.
Gil Grissom: I'm sorry, too. I don't want to do this.
Warrick Brown: You got to. You know where I was?
Gil Grissom: I think I have a pretty good idea.
Warrick Brown: I went to lay a bet. I didn't even think I was doing anything wrong. Never occurred to me.
Gil Grissom: It never occurred to me, either.

Gil Grissom: You know what? If I let you go I got to let me go, too. 
And Catherine ... and Brass. We're all culpable in this.  I don't care what the book says. I lost one good person today. I don't want to lose another-- here.

Warrick Brown: I won't let you down again.






Gil Grissom: Let's go home.

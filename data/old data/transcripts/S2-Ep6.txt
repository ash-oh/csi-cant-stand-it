Benjamin Jennings: No! No!



Grissom: Call said one dead body.
Sgt. O'Riley: Caught him red-handed. Ben Jennings.

Nick: Nick Stokes, Gil Grissom, Las Vegas Crime Lab. You want to tell us what's going on? What happened here?

Grissom: You have anything to say? 
 
Grissom: You don't have to talk to us.

Grissom: He'll talk to us.





Nick: See that lividity? Blood settled at the time of death.
Grissom: Body's been moved from the murder scene. Impound his car.

Sara: Sorry, guys. I lost you at the fork.
Nick: My bad, Sara.

Grissom: Let's process this guy shall we? Officer, would you uncuff him, please?!


Nick: Okay, make like a scarecrow for me, partner. 

Nick: Arms out, away from your body. That's it. Stay just like that.

Sara: Give me your right foot. Other right. Put it down. Lift it up.

Grissom: Hold still. 

Grissom: Possible secondary transfer ...
Nick: Got some red fibers.
Sara: Other foot. Lift it up. Put it down.

Grissom: No defensive wounds. No hematomas.
Nick: Victim didn't fight back. Probably didn't see it coming.
Grissom: Matthew ... tag that body for special processing, VIP room. Don't wash it till I get there, and don't touch his fingernails.





Catherine: &quot;D.B. ... Mediterranean Casino ... Women's Spa.&quot;

 

Brass: Body is Shelley Danvers. DOB: 10/10/81. Employee walked in to get towels ... 

Brass: ... found her here.
[Clips of the crime scene from various perspectives flash in quick pulses. Flash to white:
* Red spot on right thigh. Flash to white.
* Magazine open on the floor. Flash to white.
* View of victim on the locker bench. Flash to white.]
Catherine: A young woman, healthy, just reading a magazine and all of a sudden she DFO'S?
Brass: Done fell out. That's what the night manager says.

Warrick: Miss?

Kim Marita:  Excuse me.
Warrick: We're from the Crime Lab. You found the deceased?
Kim Marita: Yes, I was, um ... just getting some towels and I walked in and she was there.

Catherine: Hey, Brass ... you touch this body?
Brass: Yeah, I was born yesterday.
Catherine: Well, it looks as if the sash may have been tied by somebody else.
Catherine: Miss ... you know anything about redressing the body?
Kim Marita: Well, she was naked. I-I-I thought she should be covered 
Catherine: Did you move the body here, too?
Kim Marita: Guests were looking in. I put a robe on her. It's not like it's a crime or anything.
Catherine: Actually, it is.
Warrick: Makes us doubt the circumstances surrounding the victim's death.





Sara: Flour, maybe?
Grissom: But what kind? All-purpose? Self-rising? Pastry?
Sara: Trace will probably have a better idea. I'll get DNA to see if there's bits of Ben under the fingernails.
Grissom: What about the neck? Any fibers in the wound?
Sara: You told me to wait for you.
Grissom: Well, that hasn't stopped you yet.
Sara: I did observe some fibers in the wound. I didn't collect them, though.
Grissom: Be my guest.

Sara: Yellow. Not cotton; satin, maybe.

Grissom: Dress shirt ... but no tie.
Sara: Strangled with his own tie?
Grissom: Find me on the flour.

Warrick: &quot;Shelley Danvers&quot; -- appointment 8:00.
Catherine: Ms. Marita, did the deceased use the jacuzzi facilities this evening?
Kim Marita: Not that I remember, no.  What? You don't believe me?
Warrick: Well, you lied to us before.
Catherine: It's, uh, not uncommon to drown in a jacuzzi. Hair gets caught in the whirl a person gets dragged under. The hotel wouldn't be considered unsafe.
Kim Marita: Well, that didn't happen here. She did not drown on these premises.
Warrick: Well, if she did, the coroner would find water in her lungs but it'd be worse hearing it from him than from you.



Robbins: Oliver Dunne. Corporate lawyer. Father of two.
Grissom: You get all that from his ... uh ... dentals?
Robbins: His wife-- widow. She came down to I.D. His property.
Grissom: .380s?
Robbins: Last one I recovered entered through his abdominals ... 

Robbins:  ... pierced the liver, lodged in the oblique.
Grissom: That's not what killed him, is it? We pulled a yellow fiber out of the neck wound. I think it's from his tie.
Robbins: You might be right. He died of asphyxiation. Tie probably closed the windpipe. 

Robbins: Without oxygen, the alveoli capillaries wither and dry up. Whole pulmonary system shut down. What you may have here is the smallest sliver of the murder weapon.
Grissom: Why would a guy shoot a man three times and then strangle him with his own tie?

Sara: I cannot tell you why, but I might be able to tell you where. A pizza shop. The flour on Oliver Dunne has a low gluten content -- seven percent protein -- it's typical of flour used to make cakes, pizzas, that kind of thing.
Grissom: So, why did you rule out bakeries?
Sara: Well, the subtype of flour is another subtype -- double zero. It's a very fine flour used only in pizza-baking ovens. Oh, and trace picked up some oregano in the sample. When are you set to interview Ben?




Brass: You're the registered owner of a Lorcin .380. Takes the same caliber bullet as the slugs we took out of the victim. So, I'm going to ask you one more time. Where's your gun?
Benjamin Jennings: I lost it.
Brass: Do you think we believe that? Do you think ... 
Grissom: Are you employed, Ben?
Benjamin Jennings: Yeah... yeah, um ... it's a place called Dante's Pizzeria. It's behind the Strato'.
Grissom: You make pizzas?
Benjamin Jennings: Well, I deliver the pizzas. It's too hot back there with all the ovens and stuff.
Grissom: Do you, uh ... ever come into contact with the baking flour at Dante's?
Benjamine Jennings: Mostly pizza boxes. Why?
Grissom: Well, 'cause we found flour on the victim and it's the kind that's used to make pizza. Can you explain that?
Benjamin Jennings: No.
Grissom: Ben, why don't you earn yourself some points by telling me what the science is going to tell me anyway?
Benjamin Jennings: Well, I don't have to talk.
Grissom: No ... but we're going to figure it out.
Benjamin Jennings: Look, if you know so much about these murders what do you need me for?
Grissom: Murders? There are more bodies?





Nick: I feel like I'm mowing a lawn.
Sara: What is that? A beer can? Soda can?
Nick: Zilch.
Sara: Zilch.
Nick: Don't tell me, more zilch?

Sara: Whoa... whoa. Point of disturbance.
Grissom: Hold up.

Grissom: Isolate it.

Sara: Grissom ...

Grissom: Any more bodies you want to tell me about?
Benjamin Jennings:  No.
Grissom: We're going to radar this whole hillside.

Grissom:  Sometimes ... when I leave a crime scene where I've been particularly involved with a dead body, I sit in my car and it hits me -- how close I was ... how heavy the body is ... the texture of the body ... how it feels... you know?

Benjamin Jennings: Mr. Grissom ... I'm not a bad person.

Grissom: You're not a bad person?

Grissom: Then, what are you?






Catherine: Oh, I hope that's Shelley Danvers the woman from the hotel spa.
David Phillips: Yep, she's next.
Catherine: Well, it's about time. You guys finished with day-shift runover, huh?

David Phillips: I hate it when you CSI guys get territorial.

Catherine: Yeah, well, the victims' families hate it when we don't.
Robbins: I'll take it from here, David.
Catherine: Good morning.
Robbins: Catherine.

Robbins: No serosanguineous fluid expunged from the mouth or nose.
Catherine: She didn't drown?
Robbins: Rules out your jacuzzi theory.
Catherine: Anything probative?
Robbins: Bright red lividity extending down the body.
Catherine: From?
Robbins: Well, heatstroke possibly. Stroke could cause multiple organ failure and if I'm right ... 
Catherine: ... cover-up. 

Robbins: Hey, I still have to do the post. Catherine?



Catherine: Brass, I need you to get records from that hotel spa -- a warrant, if we need it. Yep, that's right. Bye.

Warrick: Oh, it's on.
Catherine: Yeah. Was our girl staying with anyone at that hotel?
Warrick: Uh, yeah. Tina ... Tina Kolas. Best friends from Terre Haute, Indiana. Flew here in a package. Why?
Catherine: We need someone to give us the truth about last night.




Father Powell: Gil Grissom?
Grissom: Father?
Father Powell: Benjamin's a member of my parish. The officer won't let me talk to him. He said you were in charge.
Grissom: Of this crime scene.
Father Powell: He needs spiritual guidance.

Grissom: Yeah, I imagine he does.
Father Powell: Ah ... then you'd have no problem with my talking to him.
Grissom: It's the 11th hour. I wouldn't expect anything less.
Father Powell: Eleventh hour?
Grissom: When the reality of their actions set in, they usually turn to religion.
Father Powell: Can you think of a better time?

Grissom: Okay, hold it. That's enough. Let's dust him.

Nick: No ligature marks.
Sara: Different from the first guy.
Grissom: See if this laceration on this guy's forehead is consistent with the kid's shovel.
Nick: Hey ... I feel a wallet here.

Sara: Strangers. Doesn't make sense. There's no connection.
Grissom: Well, it obviously wasn't a robbery.

Sgt. O'Riley: Hey.
Nick: Hey, O'Riley. What's the matter, man? A/C not working?
Sgt. O'Riley: I was on with dispatch. Oliver Dunne's car was just found by the highway patrol abandoned at an Avcon station off 215.
Grissom: They didn't happen to find another car there, did they?
Sgt. O'Riley: Yeah. Registered to a &quot;Ramirez.&quot;
Nick: Yeah ... gas station.





Catherine: And you can verify that when Shelley went to the hotel spa last night, she was going to use the dry sauna?
Tina Kolas: We'd been drinking apple martinis for, like, three days straight. Shelley said the sauna would detox her you know, clean her out.
Warrick: Cath. Whose shirt is this?

Tina Kolas: Mine. Shelley and I got in a fight over it.
Warrick: When?
Tina Kolas: Yesterday. I caught her trying it on and I said &quot;give it back,&quot; and then we started fighting over it, you know, tug of war and the whole thing ripped right in two. We fell back laughing.

Tina Kolas: I'd give anything to have her back.
Warrick: We're going to take this shirt, if you don't mind.
Tina Kolas: No, go ahead, if it'll help.
Catherine: You said you have proof that Shelley used the dry sauna.
Tina Kolas: She called down from this phone. Do they tape phone calls here?
Catherine: Hotel surveillance would love that. You're sure she used that phone to make the appointment?
Tina Kolas: Yeah.

[MEDITERRANEAN HOTEL &amp; CASINO

Warrick: We're going to take this as well.
Tina Kolas: Okay... but it doesn't have anything on it.
Warrick: Well, that's okay. We do magic.



Sara: Two men were shot and killed and you didn't see anything?
Kirk : Sorry.
Nick: You don't just miss something like that. What was going on?
Kirk: A friend of mine came with his new car. We took it for a drive. I'm afraid my boss will find out. I was only gone five minutes.
Nick: Okay, all right. Just-just walk us through it. When did you know there'd been a crime committed?
Kirk: Well, my buddy dropped me back here and I noticed these two cars. I went to check them out.

Kirk: Oh, my god.

Nick: I don't see any blood.
Kirk: Yeah, I hosed it down.
Sara: You what?
Kirk: It was freakin' me out.




Father Powell: H-hello? Mr. Grissom?

Father Powell: Uh ... they told me out front I'd find you here.
Grissom: I don't see your, uh ... visitor's badge.
Father Powell: Priest's collar. People trust it.  Most people. Even ... lapsed catholics.
Grissom: What makes you think, uh ... I was ever a catholic?
Father Powell: First time we met, you called me &quot;Father.&quot; Only Romans do that. Everybody else, it's &quot;Reverend&quot; or &quot;Minister.&quot; I wanted to know how your investigation against Ben is going.
Grissom: This is his car. You know, you really shouldn't be here.
Father Powell: I didn't come here to tamper with your evidence. 

Father Powell: He was a good kid, all through school still comes to mass every Sunday. If he has a problem ... it's trying to please people.
Grissom: Is that a problem?
Father Powell: It can be.

Grissom: This luminol reveals dried blood.

Father Powell: He wouldn't do this.
Grissom: I believe the car.
Father Powell: &quot;To whom much is given, much will be expected.&quot;

Father Powell: I leave you to your work.




Kim Marita: I told you we have no record Shelley Danvers specifically used the dry sauna.
(CATHERINE opens a Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Evidence folder with the following information:

Catherine: That's okay, 'cause we do. ESDA can read this blank paper ... see what's written on it. Up to 14 layers.
Warrick: Sometimes a simple flashlight will do the trick.

Catherine: That's Miss Danvers' handwriting. We confirm that.
Kim Marita: So she took a dry sauna. What does that prove?
Warrick: She died of a heat stroke. The coroner just called in with the results of his final post. Your sauna's kept in the optimal condition for heat stroke -- 182 degrees. 


Warrick: That could kill a person if you left them longer than two straight hours.
Brass: Especially if no one checks up on them. A hotel employee is supposed to check on the various saunas every 15 minutes. Hotel regulations, right? We, uh, we got a copy of the check-up sheet.





Brass: No hotel employee checked in on the sauna after 7:30 P.M.
Catherine: So, Shelley was in here from 8:00 until ... what time did you call 9-1-1?

Kim Marita: I, um ... I came in at closing. 10:00.

Kim Marita: Miss? Miss? Oh, my god.

Catherine: You moved her into the locker room? Put the robe on her?
Kim Marita: I was just trying to protect the hotel.
Catherine: From negligent homicide.
Kim Marita: They drill into us that the reputation of this hotel is everything.





Nick: Murder scene was compromised.
Sara: Pump jockey wasn't very helpful but bullets pulled from victim one and victim two. 

Sara : Identical striations. Bullets in both victims were fired by the exact same weapon.
Nick: A Lorcin .380. The same pistol registered to a Benjamin Jennings.

Sara: P.D. Can prove through credit cards that Ben frequents the AvCon gas stations where both vics were killed.

Nick: And we can prove he transported those bodies in his vehicle based on the blood you found.
Sara: And fibers.

Sara: I recovered a burgundy fiber from the sock of victim one. Found the same fiber on the sock of victim two.
Nick: We I.D'd the fibers using the FTIR. It's a polymer commonly used in vehicle carpeting.
Sara: So we went back to Ben's car.

Nick: They're identical.
Sara: We got the master standards from the car manufacturer. The assigned name for the material is &quot;12-ounce Merlot-Poly.&quot;
Nick: Bottom line ... he killed them.
Grissom: Good work, you guys. Very good. But you haven't proved murder. You've proved burial.
Nick: Excuse me?
Sara: Victim blood on his clothes ... Under his nails.
Grissom: From burying them.
Nick: Victim blood in his car?
Grissom: He transported them. Show me the gun with Ben's prints on it. Gun shot residue, the ligature, the ... 
Sara: ... The holes in Christ's hands, Doubting Thomas?
Grissom: Yes. Empirical evidence. St. Thomas was ahead of us all.
Sara: Does this have anything to do with the priest that's been coming around here?
Grissom: No. It has to do with the evidence.
Nick: It's our job to present the D.A. with the best evidence possible. Let a jury decide. Anything else, we're playing judge. The evidence doesn't get any better than this.

Grissom: Okay. Ship it. Show it to the D.A.
Nick: Right.

Brass: Anyone up for breakfast?

Catherine: I'm up for a shower and tucking my daughter in.

Warrick: Football-- wide-screen.

Brass: Well, I guess I'll go see Tina alone. Hotel tells me she's down playing quarter slots.

Catherine: I thought we solved this case. What'd you get?
Brass: Well, my guy in the hotel lounge tells me that Tina and Shelley were having a catfight over some dude named Jeremy the day she died. That's probably how the shirt really got ripped.
Catherine: Don't ring her bell till we re-examine our case.





Nick: Misunderstood the priest? How?
Grissom: I looked deeper into the evidence. I should have looked deeper into Ben's character.

Nick: This guy is hard-core. He's looking at his third strike here.

Sara: What's going on?

Nick: You know how we pushed him to file on Ben?
Sara: Yeah.
Nick: We might have been wrong.




Grissom:  Tell me about your brother. We know that you only buried the bodies. So, what happened? Did he threaten you?

Grissom:  Ben?





Grissom: Did you learn to throw pizzas in prison, Roger?
Roger Jennings: Who the hell are you guys? Get out of my kitchen.
Sgt. O'Riley: &quot;Roger Jennings -- armed robbery, breaking and entering.&quot; You sound like the kind of guy it wouldn't be a big jump to murder.
Roger Jennings: Hey, what is this?

Sgt. O'Riley: Your first stop the AvCon gas station. See these two guys?

Roger Jennings: Nope. Don't know what you're talking about. My little brother got me this job. I'm staying clean.
Sgt. O'Riley: Suppose I told you your brother said you did these guys.

Roger Jennings: Ben wouldn't do that.

Grissom: You did it directly after work using a .380 pistol and then you strangled one of the victims with his own tie. 

Roger Jennings: Ben did it.
Grissom: Did you witness this?
Roger Jennings: He told me about it.

Benjamin Jennings: Look what I did -- I just lost my head. What am I supposed to do now?
Roger: I'm on a short line, all right? You're on your own, Ben.
Benjamin Jennings: Roger, you've got to help me.
Roger: You know I can't. What am I going to do? Huh? It's your mess. You got to deal with it.

Sgt. O'Riley:  What started the beef with the victims?
Roger: I don't know. Tempers, I guess.

Benjamin Jennings: Hey! Hey, man! I was here first. You want to wait your turn?
Kenny Ramirez: What are you going to do, huh?


Roger: Bystander gets a little too nosy ... 

Roger: ... and he gets it, too.

Grissom: The perpetrator's hands left flour on the victim's face. This is not from a gunshot. This was something a little more intimate.

Grissom: When a person changes his mode of murder from pistol to ligature it's for one of two reasons - entertainment ... or necessity. Which was it for you?
Roger: Neither. I told you, Ben strangled that guy.
Grissom: The flour said you did.
Roger: I don't know what you're talking about.





Sara: Anything on the list besides the tie?
Nick: Nope.

Sara: Hey, guys.
Nick: Hey, guys. You can go ahead and take off. I think we got it.
Officers: Thanks.


 

Sara: Whoa.

Sara: Hey. Dry cleaning. The trailer's low-rent. Dry cleaning's expensive.

Nick: Sara?
Sara: This man's not as smart as he thinks. Dry cleaning bakes in blood stains.
Nick: Could be red sauce.
Sara: Oh, now you're cautious.
Nick: I'm just trying to put our mistake to good use.
Sara: Okay. You check the perimeter and I'll see if we have blood stains or red sauce.
Nick: Okay.












Sara: Hemoglobin.  Take a look at this.

Sara: Nick?


Sara: Hey, Nick.










Nick: Looks like it jammed, huh? Get anything instructive?
Grissom:  Possibly.



Greg: Blood from Jennings's denim shirt.

Sara: Is the printer out of ink?  &quot;ND, ND, ND.&quot;
Greg: It means &quot;None Detected.&quot; The dry cleaning baked in the blood and it also degraded it to a degree that I just can't get a result.
Sara:  Try again. This could be victim blood. Try again.
Greg: I have tried. It's chemically impossible, Sara. Nothing from nothing is nothing.





Bobby Dawson: The striaions are different. See? 

Bobby Dawson: There's no way I can say that the bullets taken from the victims were fired by Jennings's gun.
Grissom: So, he altered the barrel somehow.

Bobby Dawson: Yeah. Changed how the bullet relates to the barrel so when the bullet emerges, its fine stria are altered.

Nick: Any idea what he used?

Bobby Dawson: Whatever it was ... did the job.
Sara: My evidence is no better. Total loss.
Nick: We present this to the D.A.
Grissom: Unfortunately, we've had this discussion before.
Nick: The guilty brother's going to walk.






Roger Jennings: He's never been in any real trouble before. They'll go easy on him.




Grissom: The bullet jammed in the feed, didn't it?

Grissom: So, it was necessity.







Tina Kolas: Wait, are you saying Shelley didn't die in the sauna?
Warrick: She died of heat stroke.
Catherine: But the stroke covered up an underlying medical catastrophe.
Tina Kolas: Like what? Shell was always healthy.
Catherine: She went into anaphylactic shock. Coroner says some of the indicators are the same as a stroke: renal failure, cerebral edema.
Warrick: We missed it until Captain Brass brought your room service records to our attention.
Tina Kolas: I don't understand.
Brass: Well, maybe this will help - 


Brass: The travel agency contract you and Shelley signed. Under &quot;allergic reactions to foods&quot; for Shelley Danvers -- shellfish.
Warrick: As her best friend, you would know that.
Brass: And then we have this from the hotel computer for your room 7:01 P.M., On the day: &quot;A Taste From the Sea a lovely tureen of mild bisque with pureed bits of Maine lobster.&quot;
Pureed, two bowls. She didn't know what she was eating when it arrived, did she? 
Catherine: Because she didn't order it; you did.
Catherine: We've got a machine known as the ESDA machine which can read pen imprints. 

&quot;ROOM SERVICE EXT 219&quot;

&quot;JEREMY DRINKS 10&quot;
Catherine: Well, the machine isolated this. &quot;Jeremy, drinks, 10:00.&quot; Shelley made that date. That's her handwriting. Were you in the room when Jeremy call?
Tina Kolas: I answered the phone. He asked for her.
Warrick: You killed her over a guy you two met at a bar?
Tina Kolas: I didn't mean to kill her. I thought that she would just have an allergic reaction and she wouldn't be able to make her date that night, you know ... like, get hives or something.
Catherine: Well, her allergy kicked in in the sauna under the worst possible conditions -- 

Catherine:  ... trachea... larynx ... tongue swelled. 
Warrick: Her pressure got so low her blood quit running through her organs. They shut down.

Tina Kolas: I didn't even like the guy. I just ... I didn't want to be left out.
Brass: Miss Kolas, you're under arrest.



Sara: Hey. D.A.'S looking for you.
Grissom: About?

Sara: What, you think I read your messages? 
Paula Francis:  Wall street Analysts, though, say stocks ... Good investments for the long term.
Sara: &quot;Top Secret&quot; and &quot;Urgent&quot;? It's a gift, reading upside down.

Paula Francis : The Las Vegas District Attorney is reportedly preparing to file homicide charges against Benjamin Corey Jennings in the so-called Burial Murders Case. Jennings has been in police custody for the last ...
Sara: Guess we know what she was calling about.
Paula Francis: ...Since he was caught burying the first victim, Oliver Dunne in the national forest.




Robin Childs : Don't you have enough cases over at CSI now you're going to start telling me which ones I should take to court?
Grissom: There isn't one piece of evidence that says that kid was even present at the murders.
Robin Childs: As a matter of fact that is why I was hunting you. Jennings brought it in about an hour ago. Chain of custody; I can't touch it. The first victim was ligatured, right?

Robin Childs: Jennings says his little brother asked him to hide the tie.
Grissom: Well, how convenient. The older brother brings it in explaining why his epithelials are all over the murder weapon.
Robin Childs: A jury doesn't understand epi-whatevers, okay? They understand a twisty tie and blood all over Ben's car seat.
Grissom: He set up his brother.
Robin Childs: Oh, come on, Grissom, they're both part of it and if I can get one of them, I will.
Grissom: He's a good kid, Robin. He hero-worships his brother, but he's a good kid.
Robin Childs: Yeah? Then his epithelials shouldn't be on that tie. You'd better check with your lab.




Grissom: Explain how bits of your skin got on the ligature used to strangle that victim.
Benjamin Jennings: I don't know.

Grissom: Your brother brought this in to the district attorney.
Benjamin Jennings: What?
Sgt. O'Riley: He's framing you.
Grissom: Unless you can tell us how your epithelials got on that tie.
Benjamin Jennings: I don't know. I swear I don't know. I ... he ... I just picked up the bodies at his place.
(Quick flashback to BENJAMIN and ROGER standing by the car. ROGER slams the back door closed after putting the bodies in.
Roger Jennings: Grab that guy's tie, little bro. I like that thing.  Bury them deep, all right? You get into any trouble you don't have to say anything, all right? I'm counting on you, man.
Benjamin Jennings: Yeah, yeah, man, I'm there all the way.
Roger Jennings: Go, get out of here. Go on.

Sgt. O'Riley: I got to ask you ... how does somebody bury two bodies as a favor?
Benjamin Jennings: 'Cause he's my brother.  He told ... He told me that if I didn't talk to you guys and if he didn't talk, then this would all just blow over; it'd all just go away.
Sgt. O'Riley: You're looking at two counts of murder, special circumstances. The best you can hope for is life without parole.

Benjamin Jennings: I don't ... I don't think I can do that kind of time.
Grissom: Do you have any physical evidence linking your brother to the murders? Anything?

Grissom: I know that we've arrested the wrong brother.

Grissom: He came to see you as soon as Ben was in custody.
Father Powell: I tried to help ... without breaking my vows.
Grissom:  We both have jobs that begin after the crime. 
Father Powell: After the &quot;sin&quot;.
Grissom: Some people would call that a career in futility.
Father Powell: Some call it a &quot;vocation&quot;.
Grissom: A hundred years ago we didn't have the technology for fingerprints. Fifteen years ago, we didn't have DNA. Hopefully one day, we'll have foolproof means by which to put the right man in jail in this case.
Father Powell: Someday, we won't need jails.

Father Powell: I celebrate mass every Thursday night, 7:00.
Grissom: Thank you ... but ...  ... no.
Father Powell: You don't believe?
Grissom: In religion? I believe in God, in science ... in Sunday supper. I don't believe in rules that tell me how I should live.
Father Powell: Even if they're handed down by God?
Grissom: How many crusades were fought in the name of God? How many people died because of someone's religion?
Father Powell: Fanaticism. Not religion.
Grissom: Semantics. They're still dead. I'm sorry about Ben, father.

Father Powell: You still suffer like a catholic.

Father Powell: Light bulb goes out other people fix it, get a new one. Light bulb goes out for the Catholic he stands in the dark says, &quot;What did I do wrong?&quot;
Grissom: That guilt's not in me anymore.





Grissom: Hey.
Catherine: Oh. You're going to be getting a call from the local papers about spa safety.
Grissom: Spa safety?
Catherine: We had a victim die of an allergic reaction at the Mediterranean. Some foul play ... some negligence.
Grissom: So what am I supposed to say?
Catherine: That it was an isolated incident ... that in no way should it be a mark against The Strip's other fine hotel-casinos.
Grissom: CSI supports Las Vegas.
Catherine: Bottom line.

Officers: Need some help in here!
Officers: Get his arm!
Officers: Hold his head!

Officers: Hold his head!
Officers: I can't stop the bleeding.

Grissom: Oh, no, no, no. How did this happen?!
Officer: Incisor. He used his teeth.

Medic: Clamp down. MEDIC: Keep him with us.
Medic:  Sir, step back. Sir.
Medic: He's bleeding out. MEDIC: He's bleeding out here.
Medic: We need to stop this. Compression. MEDIC: Keep him with us. Get the head up. MEDIC: We're losing him, we're losing him ...

Medic: I'm going to pronounce. 22:04.

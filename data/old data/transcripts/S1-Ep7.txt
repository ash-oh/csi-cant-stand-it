Tina Collins:  Oh, god, help me! Somebody, please! Please ... oh, god! Somebody help me!

Tina Collins: Please! Help me! Help me!

Tina Collins: Help me! Help me! Please!

Cue Sound:  AMBULANCE SIREN WAILING



 

Grissom: Hey.
Det. O'Riley: Heads up. The press is going to be all over this one.
Grissom: Did the count change since you called me?
Det. O'Riley: Four dead: Mother, father, two teenage boys. The sisters were luckier. 

Det. O'Riley: Teen girl heard a noise, hid in the closet. Alerted the neighbors after all the shouting was done. 

Det. O'Riley: Younger sister's over there. They couldn't have killed their father tag team -- soaking wet.

Grissom: What's the matter with your guys?
Det. O'Riley: They've been inside.









Grissom: Put your equipment down, son. 

Grissom: Put these on. I'm going to do a preliminary walk-through. You're going to take my notes. 





Grissom: Don't touch that! I want everything exactly the way it was. 

Grissom: The air smells like copper. Lots of blood. Breathe through your mouth.
Shibley: Yes, sir.






Grissom: Male caucasian approximately 40 years old lying in a pool of blood. 

Grissom: No drag marks. Body does not appear to have been moved. Multiple stab wounds to the back and neck. Looks like a single-edged blade. Force to such a degree that the left and right internal jugular veins have been transected. Head faces west. Feet pointing east. Approximately two feet from the north wall, one foot from the south.
Shibley:  Could ... could you take your own notes? I think that I'm going to be sick.

Sara: I got it. Go get some fresh air. 

Sara: I heard on the scanner. Quadruple. Figured you might need a hand.
Grissom: You don't sleep, do you?
Sara:  No. 

Sara: Blood swirl on the wall. Are you thinking cult? Manson?
Grissom:  Somebody left a message. I need to see the rest of it.






Grissom: Female Caucasian. Appears to be one stab wound to the throat. Transection of left and right carotid arteries with exsanguinating hemorrhage. No defense marks. Cursory opinion: She was killed in her sleep.



Grissom:  Do you feel this?
Sara:  Her soul's still in the room.
Grissom: But there's something else.













Det. O'Riley: You want a barf bag?
Grissom:  I want the paramedics that were in this house back here immediately -- police escort. Get them on this front lawn now.

DET. O'RIELY: You'd think I work for you instead of the other way around.
Grissom:  Call dispatch. You tell my entire graveyard shift that I want them here ASAP -- all of them-- no exceptions. 

Grissom: Sara, those photos -- blown up times ten. Tell the lab that we need every forensics tool available to us here right away. This is the only crime scene in Las Vegas tonight.
Sara: Yes, sir.





Reporter 1 : The fear in this neighborhood just South of Las Vegas Boulevard is almost palpable. Scott Collins, his wife and two sons were brutally murdered in their beds. 

Reporter 2 : ... the murder of four innocent ...

Reporter 1 : Authorities thus far have offered no comment fueling the fears of the neighbors that a killer is on the loose.
Reporter 3 :  ... A multiple murder. And we will have more on this ...





Det. O'Riley: It's okay. We'll give you clothes. The lab guys just want to see yours.
Grissom: Sergeant, may I?

Grissom: Tina ... I'm very sorry about what happened to you tonight. But everything we take from your house can help us find out what happened to your family.
Tina Collins:  When can I be with my sister? She's so scared.

Grissom: Soon. Detective?



 

Grissom:  Thanks.

Grissom: Hi. Is your name Brenda? 

Grissom: I'm trying to find out who hurt your family. Do you think you could help me? Did anyone come into your room tonight? Through the door? Through the window maybe? 

Grissom:  Okay.

Brenda Collins:  The buffalo.

Grissom: The buffalo? Who's the buffalo? 

Grissom: Brenda?

BLUR OUT TO:



Grissom: First rule for this crime scene: Do not do any interviews. Second rule: Don't talk to the Sheriff either.
Warrick: Media have it right? Four dead?
Grissom: The killer was here not two hours ago. He left part of himself behind. Catherine, I need you inside, mapping and blood samples.
Catherine: You got it.
Grissom: Nick, Warrick-- the perimeter. I want to know how he got here how he got in, how he got out, and how he left.
Nick: I'll take the back. Warrick, you get the front?
Warrick: You got it.





Officer:  Hey, O'Riley, Grissom wants to see you.





Det. O'Riley: They said you were looking for me.
Grissom: Hey, stop! Evidence!

Det. O'Riley: We got to hug the wall? This is the only room with no blood in it. There's nothing to disturb.
Grissom: You guys will never get it, will you?
(GRISSOM continues to look around and notices the open knife drawer. He reaches over and pulls it open.
Grissom: Knife drawer. One missing.
Det. O'Riley: It's the only drawer open. The killer knew where they were going.
Grissom: I think the suspect's been in this house before. And this is the first place they stopped tonight. 

Grissom: Good. Linoleum. The best surface.
Det. O'Riley: Best surface for what?



Det. O'Riley:  You guys got some toys ...
Grissom: It's not a toy, O'Riley. It's an electrostatic dust print lifter.
Det. O'Riley: Okay ... 
Grissom: Like a supercharged lint remover only it lifts footprints. Possibly our killer's.





EMS #1: We did everything by the book, sir.
Grissom: Relax. I just want to know where you walked in the house and who you touched in there.
EMS #1: Well, we did use the main entry, and up the stairs. But once we saw the husband, we grabbed the walls. I felt the pulses in each room. Once I found they were dead, we booked.
Grissom: Show me the bottom of your shoe.


Grissom: Now yours. 

Grissom: You fellows were both in the kitchen.
EMS #1: We didn't see any bodies in there so I didn't think twice about walking on the surface.
Grissom: All right. Yours are the only clean prints I found. Thanks. You can go back to work.

Det. O'Riley: News bim's waiting for you. Thinks you have an &quot;interesting look.&quot;

Reporter 1 : Any truth to the rumor that a cult may have committed these crimes?
Grissom: I don't know that.
Reporter 1 : But you wouldn't rule it out?
Grissom: I don't rule anything out.

Sheriff Brian Mobley: Grissom.
Grissom: Sheriff?
Sheriff Brian Mobley: The mayor has already called. So what have you got?
Grissom: Nothing.
Sheriff Brian Mobley: I'm not asking you to lay out your whole case. Just give me something I can run with. I have got to feed the press and defuse the panic.
Grissom: As soon as I have something, you'll have something.
Sheriff Brian Mobley: Here's a thought. Why don't you try being more like Ecklie?
Grissom: I could speak volumes about Conrad Ecklie, but I have a crime scene to process so ... you'll have to excuse me.
Reporter 1 : Sheriff, can you tell me what went on inside?

Sheriff Brian Mobley: Let me assure everyone that the situation is well under control. We don't have any suspects at this time, but our forensic crew ...

Sara: You want me inside?
Grissom: I need you to transport the little girl to the police department. Brass is waiting for you.
Sara: You're kidding me, right? I'm a taxi service on the biggest case of the year?
Grissom: Sara ... I need one of us with that little girl.
























Grissom: I want to see all of their personal property -- clothes, jewelry, whatever they have on.
David Phillips: If there's something under all this blood you'll be the first to know.

Nick:  This kid should be out playing Pop Warner.






Catherine: I got the blood samples on the way to the lab.
Grissom: Good. You buy this cult thing?
Catherine: You mean the blood swirls next to the father's body in the boys' room? 

Catherine: I studied pictures of the Manson Murders. This isn't butter. It's imitation. 
 
Catherine: What's your take?
Grissom: Whoever did it killed the mother first. In her sleep, quick.
Catherine: Explains why the blood is confined to the bed and the floor under it.
Grissom: Husband woke up. Ran to protect his kids. 

Grissom: The killer nicked him here. And then finished him off down the hall.
Catherine: Gave his life for the little girl. There should be more blood.
Grissom: Yeah. It's a hole. We need to fill it. If we start from the inside and fan out whoever's left at the scene ...
Catherine: The first suspect.
Grissom: The teen daughter?
Catherine: Well, she'd need help. Maybe a boyfriend?
Grissom:  I wonder if they call him &quot;buffalo.&quot;




Sara:  Look, brass, I don't see why I got to take her. I'm a scientist. Catherine's the mom. Ask her.
Brass: O'Riley was primary on this till it passed over to me. Big deal.
Sara: What about Family Services? Can't they take her?
Brass: They sent their caseworker over to the hospital so meet her there with the kid.
Sara: I am not good with kids.
Brass: Look, I'm not asking you to adopt her. Just take her over to sunrise for a Psych Eval, will you?


Sara: That's very pretty. 

Sara: Or not. 

Sara: Want to go for another ride? 

Sara: I'll take that as a &quot;yes.&quot;




Brass: Tina, do you know what time you heard those noises?
Tina Collins: No, but they sounded like footsteps coming from the kitchen.
Brass: And that's when you hid in the closet?
Tina Collins: Yes.
Brass: Does your family normally keep the doors locked at night?
Tina Collins: I don't know. My dad checks the house at night. It's always been a safe neighborhood.
Grissom: Tina ... do you ... go out with anyone special?
Tina Collins: I hook up with different guys. No one special.
Grissom: Are any of them ... called &quot;Buffalo&quot;?

Tina Collins: &quot;Buffalo&quot;? No.

Brass: How about this, Tina? You live in a house with six people, right? You must be used to hearing footsteps in the kitchen late at night. Why so scared last night?
Tina Collins: I know my brothers' footsteps. And my Dad's. These were different.




Nick: How do you know it's fresh?
Warrick: I checked the sprinkler system. It goes off every night at zero-two hundred .
Nick: .

Warrick: So somebody came out of the house and got on what looks to be a step down from a motorcycle and drove it across the lawn.
Nick: And I bet he dropped the bidi I found in the back on the way out.
Grissom: Bidi?
Nick: Yeah. Those hand-rolled cigarettes? Probably a teenager. They're always taking shortcuts.
Warrick: How's that hand?
Nick: Hmm?
Warrick: I saw you beating up the door a little while ago. You all right?
Nick: Yeah. It's cool. I'll see you back at the lab.





Sara: Hey, Brenda.

Dr. Leever: Which one of you is with Family Services?
Connie Bellvue: I am. Connie Bellvue.
Dr. Leever:  Brenda's fine but I'd like her to have a consult. I've paged the psychiatric resident. Should be here within the hour.

Connie Bellvue:  Thanks. I'll take it from here.
Sara: What ... what's the head exam for?

Connie Bellvue: I said ... we'll take it from here.
Sara:  Look, if there's any forensic evidence found during this exam, I need to be there.
Connie Bellvue:  It's already going to be tense. 

Connie Bellvue:  Go back to your crime lab. I'll keep you posted. 

Sara:  It's okay, Brenda. 

Sara:  I'm not leaving you.











Catherine:  Linds.



 


Warrick: Damn!
Grissom:  That you, Warrick?

Warrick: You need to tell somebody when you're cutting the lights.
Grissom: What, are you working for OSHA now?
Warrick: Grissom, you remember those tire treads ... I found on the front lawn?
Grissom: mm-hmm.
Warrick: Well, I ran them through the FBI register and they belong to a '93
Honda scooter.
Grissom: That's good.
Warrick: I DMV'd it. A kid four blocks away from the scene owns the same make.
Grissom: That's very good.
Warrick: I might have just blown open the case and all you give me is a &quot;that's very good&quot;?

Grissom: If your whole family was murdered, wouldn't you run to them to check to see if they were still alive?
Warrick: Yeah.

Grissom: This is a Lady Macbeth.
Warrick: Lady Macbeth?

Grissom: &quot;Out, out, damn spot.&quot; There's not a trace of blood on the teen daughter's clothing. Not a spot.





Catherine: Linds? Lindsey? 

Catherine: Lindsey ... Lindsey.

Catherine: Hi, honey!
Lindsey Willows: Mommy, hi!

Catherine: Oh, am I glad to see you.

Lindsey: Daddy came to ballet tonight.
Catherine: I know. I was just there. Your teacher told me daddy came to pick you up. Oh, you feel so good. 

Catherine: Ed ... I'm working this quadruple. Time got away from me. I apologize.
Eddie Willows: I figured that's probably what it was. 
Catherine: Right.
Eddie Willows: When they couldn't reach you, they called me.
Catherine: Yeah. Thank you. I really, really ...
Eddie Willows: Cath, Cath, Cath ... she's my kid too, okay? All right?
Catherine: Yeah. 

Catherine:  Oh, god.
Eddie Willows: So, the case is bad? I saw it on the news.
Catherine: Yeah.
Eddie Willows: Hey.

Catherine: What?
Eddie Willows: Are you hungry? I made pancakes.
Catherine: You made pancakes?
Eddie Willows: Mm-hmm.
Catherine:  For dinner?
Eddie Willows: Yeah.

Catherine: That would be Grissom.
Eddie Willows: How is your boyfriend?
Catherine:  Ed.



Grissom:  Yeah. I need you back here right away. The Collins Case is busting out.
Catherine: Okay, I'll be right there. Just let me put on some clean clothes.
Grissom: Please do.


Catherine: Eddie ...
Eddie Willows: She's going to ask where you are.
Catherine:  She always does.




;




 

Grissom: Mr. Ecklie.
Conrad Ecklie: I just got off the phone with the Sheriff. He wants results, Gil.
Grissom: He should go to a sports book. I hear the Stardust is good.
Conrad Ecklie: No. What he should do is go to his first team-- my team.
Grissom: Teams, Conrad? I didn't know this was a competition.
Conrad Ecklie: Well, it is, and my crew usually wins.
Grissom: Really? Didn't graveyard beat day shift in softball last summer?
Conrad Ecklie: You know, you can joke all you want. It's your ass on the line.

Grissom:  I think it was 14-3.
Conrad Ecklie: Like I said, it's all about results. And, if you don't get them I will.


 

Warrick: The tire treads from the scooter place you at the scene of the murders.
Oliver: Look, I was in Hoover visiting my father. I don't know anything about Tina's parents getting killed.
Warrick: Tina's parents? So you know Tina Collins?
Oliver: Yeah, I know her. A lot of guys know her. She's a freak.
Warrick: You mean sexually?
Oliver: Yeah. 
Warrick: Where's your scooter now?
Oliver: I told him I don't know.
Brass: So it just disappeared?
Oliver: Look, it costs money, right? And my dad's been slacking on support so I bought it with three other guys. We share it.
Brass: Here's a pen. Start writing.



 

Sara: Hey, heard you have a suspect.
Warrick: We got about four just on the tire prints alone. Homicide's grabbing them up.
Grissom: Let's talk about what else we have. Tina Collins' pajama top from the murder scene without a drop of blood on it.

Sara: Hello. How does she explain that?
Catherine: We're about to go ask her. Nick, what did you find out about that stuff that you collected at the back of the house?
Nick: The bidi? DNA's still processing but Tina said nobody in the family smoked.
Sara: So a non-family member was out there.
Grissom: Bidi? Bidi? I thought you found a cigarette and a match behind the house.
Nick: Well, it's just like a cigarette.
Sara: Kids smoke them. They think there's less carbon monoxide.
Grissom: What did you find out about the psych exam on the little girl?
Sara: The shrink says the kid is in a catatonic state from a trauma. I could've told you that. But she did respond to the name &quot;Buffalo.&quot;
Grissom: Respond how?
Sara: She freaked out.

Grissom: And ... what are you doing about it now?

Sara: Going back to the girl. 
 
Sara: I left her in the car. 

Sara:  The windows are cracked. 

Sara: Give me a little credit. She's at the hospital.




 

Tina Collins: I don't know why I didn't get blood on my pajamas. I just didn't.
Catherine: But your statement says that you bent down and hugged your mother who was bleeding profusely. Then you ran out, tripping over your father's body in the upstairs hallway.
Grissom: But there was no blood on you.
Tina Collins: I saw my family dead. I was scared. I ran to the neighbors. That is the truth.
Grissom: The evidence is telling a different story.


 

Suburban Teen Guy #1: I did the nasty with her, yeah, but I didn't kill her family. Besides my dad grounded me last week.

Suburban Teen Guy #2: I share the scooter with Oliver but I was camping last night. Ask my mom. She made me go. Church group.

Jesse Overton: We had s*x. So what? I want a lawyer.
Brass: You want a lawyer? Okay, we'll get you a lawyer. Investigator Stokes will stay with you just in case you remember where you left that scooter.

Nick: There's no smoking in here.
Jesse Overton: Sharon Stone -- &quot;Basic Instinct&quot;, dude.
Nick: And I'm not your dude. This ain't a movie and Sharon Stone's fine. Let's go. 

Nick: Matches?




 

Brass: The kid's name is Jesse Overton. He time-shares the scooter. He admits to having s*x with your girl, and he's asking for a lawyer. 

Brass: I want to get a warrant and search his house. I'll keep you posted.


Tina Collins: I want to see my sister.
Grissom: It's not going to happen, Tina.
Catherine: It's a little too late to start coaching her now.
Tina Collins: You don't understand. I need to speak with her.
Grissom: She won't speak.
Catherine: The doctor says it's from trauma. What happened, Tina? Did you catch your boyfriend killing your family?



 


Nick:  Ha-ha-ha! Houston, we have liftoff.
Warrick: Let me take a look.

Nick: You see how each half of the match lines up?
Warrick: I see.
Nick: Ah ... who broke the case?
Warrick: Well, if you believe what you hear in the halls - Ecklie.
Nick: Ecklie?
Both :  Day shift.


 
Brass: Sophisticated criminal, huh? 

Grissom: Hmm?
Brass: This is the getaway vehicle. Tossing it in his own trash? What else is new? 

Brass: Whoa. Is this a pair of jeans under all that blood?
Grissom:  &quot;Yet who would have thought the old man to have so much blood in him?&quot;

Brass: What was that?
Grissom: That's Shakespeare.




 

Grissom: The lawyer's pleading him guilty.
Brass: Had to, once I put the murder weapon in his mug.


 

Lie Detector Operator: Remember -- yes or no.
Jesse Overton: Got it.
Lie Detector Operator: Did Tina Collins approach you at school and ask you to kill her family?
Jesse Overton: Yes.
Lie Detector Operator:  Would you lie about that to escape the death penalty?
Jesse Overton: No.
Lie Detector Operator: Did you kill her family?
Jesse Overton: Yes.
Lie Detector Operator: Did Tina let you in the front door the night of the killings?
Jesse Overton: Two o'clock. I waited till it was straight up.

Lie Detector Operator:  Yes or no?

Jesse Overton: Sorry.  Yes.

Lie Detector Operator:  Did she already have a knife for you?
Jesse Overton:  No. She let me choose.

Lie Detector Operator:  Did you use that knife to kill Barbara Collins?

Jesse Overton:  Yes.



Lie Detector Operator: And Mr. Collins?
Jesse Overton:  Yes.

Lie Detector Operator: And both sons?
Jesse Overton: Yes.
Lie Detector Operator: Was Tina mad at her parents for not letting you see each other?
Jesse Overton: Yes.
Lie Detector Operator: Did Tina Collins tell you she wanted them dead so you could see each other?

Jesse Overton: Yes.



 

Brass: Well, the sick b*st*rd is on the up and up.  Except your last question. Your &quot;Why&quot;?
Catherine: That they killed the family so they could be together?
Brass: Operator says his respiratory reactions were inconsistent. He's lying.
Nick: We got them both. I don't much care why they did it.
Warrick: I'm with you there.
Grissom: I care. I don't like holes. What are they hiding?
FADE TO BLACK





 

Grissom: Did you collect the property from the Collins family?
Dr. Albert Robbins: Right after the autopsies. Sealed them myself. Why?
Grissom: I told one of your assistants to make sure that I got them.
Dr. Albert Robbins: Well, I gave them to Ecklie. He said he'd deliver them to you. 

Dr. Albert Robbins: He was down here on another case.



 

Grissom:  Ecklie! 

Grissom: I want everything right now.
Conrad Ecklie:  I've been going over it.
Grissom: The Collins case is my shift. You are completely off base.
Conrad Ecklie: What, you're afraid I'll find something that might show you up?
Grissom: Oh, I'm sure, if you could, you would have by now. Where is it?

Conrad Ecklie: I don't care that you got some pimply-faced kid to confess. You kept the Sheriff out of the loop. That's a career-killer, Gil.
Grissom: That's what so sad, Conrad. You think of this as a career.



 


Grissom:  The buffalo.

Grissom:  Sara?
Sara:  Yeah?
Grissom:  Sara. When they examined the little Collins girl did they check for sexual abuse?
Sara:  There were no overt signs. Why?



Grissom:  Have some ultraviolet photographs taken.

Sara: This... is a very special camera. It can see deep into your skin. It can see things nobody can see. How about I take a picture of me first, okay? 

Sara: See? It's okay. 

Sara:  Okay.

Sara: All ready?

Sara: Okay.



 


Catherine: Notes on mapping: Collins family murder. Case #00-398. Intruder killed mother. 
(... then moves to the photo of the mother in the bedroom, Case #00-398, Photo
#17.)
Catherine: Father went to protect the little girl. Got nicked by knife. 
(Camera moves from the boy's room on the map to the photo, Case #00-398, Photo
#47.)
Catherine: Killer subdued him as dad was entering the little girl's room to ... 
Catherine: ... save her. 






Catherine: Grissom.


Ted Goggle: Catherine Willows?
Catherine: Who's asking?
Ted Goggle: Ted Goggle. I'm with Family Services. Were you working the Collins' case?
Catherine:  You know, your department can't seem to get things straight. If you're looking for the little girl, she's already got a caseworker.
Ted Goggle: Actually, I'm inquiring about your little girl.
Catherine: My Lindsey? Why? What are you talking about?
Ted Goggle: Your husband, Eddie, filed a report. Says you neglected to pick her up after dance class last night. That you routinely neglect her for your job.
Catherine:  Is this Eddie's idea of a joke? What, are you in one of his bands?
Ted Goggle: I already made a field visit to your house. Here's the form. 

Ted Goggle: Lindsey seems okay but there is going to be an investigation as to whether there was parental neglect. You're on notice.



 

Grissom: Grissom.

Catherine: It's me. Something's off on the map.
Grissom:  Off? How?
Catherine: Uh ... I'm looking at dad's blood in the hall. I found an interesting drop. The droplet tells me that he wasn't running to the little girl's room. 
Grissom: He was coming out of it?
Catherine: Yeah. 

Catherine:  I filled one of your holes, Grissom. 

Catherine:  The father was killed first -- then the mother. 

Catherine:  And the blood that we found in the hallway was from the knife.




 

Sara: Damn it. Look at all those bruises.
Grissom: Somebody was all over this kid.


 


Grissom: We have forensic evidence that your father sexually abused your sister. 

Grissom: We also know ... that he was in her room the night of the murders.
Tina Collins: How can you tell?
Grissom: Blood drops. They fall a certain way depending on the motion of the victim. 

Grissom: Something horrible happened in that house, didn't it, Tina? Long before the night of the murders.
Tina Collins: That was the last night he was going to touch her.
Grissom: But why your mother? And why your brothers?
Tina Collins:  Because they should have protected me.
Grissom: You?
Tina Collins: My father ... 




Tina Collins: I was young. I learned to deal. But when he went for my daughter ...
Grissom:  Brenda is ... ? And who is ... ?
Tina Collins: The father? I was thirteen ... and nobody noticed that my clothes were getting bigger. Nice, huh? Brenda may hate me for what I did ... but I protected her. I did that much.







 

Catherine: Night, guys.
Nick:  See you, Cath. 
Grissom: Good work.

Grissom: It'll be back to normal in 24 hours.
Nick: Normal would be nice.

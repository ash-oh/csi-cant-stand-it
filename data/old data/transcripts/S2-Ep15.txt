Grissom: You sure?
Edward Cormier: I authorize all cadavers and associated research. He's not ours.





Brass: People donate their body to science end up submerged in a pond? Crammed in a car?
Catherine: Body Farm; creepy.
Grissom: A Body Farm is not creepy. It's a controlled study of situational decomposition. All in all, a very healthy place.
Catherine: Tell that to Slim hanging from the tree.

Brass: Whoever placed our victim here knew that the body farm existed. What they didn't know is each body is tracked by a bunch of scientists.
Catherine: Can't just slip a card into the deck.

David Phillips: Well, he's not in rigor. TSD is under six hours. I'll move him as soon as you're finished.
Brass: Any I.D.?
David Phillips: None.

Brass: Okay, I'm going to move him.
(BRASS rolls the body over so that he's facing upward. CATHERINE takes more pictures.
Brass: Gunshot wound to the chest.

Catherine: Well, look. One of your friends.

Grissom: It's a carpet beetle. It shouldn't be here.
Catherine: Vic seem more like a hardwood floors kind of guy to you?
Grissom: Carpet beetles are the last to arrive at a corpse -- when it's almost a skeleton. I mean, this guy's still fresh.

Grissom: David! Get this body out of here now! We got cross contamination!






Sara: Wow, you got to go to the body farm?
Catherine: Yeah.
Sara: I've always wanted to go there. What was it like?
Catherine: Quiet.

Warrick: I hear Grissom goes there all the time. Like even on his nights off.

Nick: Why does that not surprise me?

Nick: Man, something stinks in here again.

Sara: What, bad milk? Cottage-cheese bad?
Nick: Worse. It's all over my sandwich. Smell that.

Sara: Yeah. He's got one of his experiments in there.
Nick: You're kidding me?
Catherine: Bugs or blood?
Sara: Not bugs.
Warrick:  Oh, that's so not cool. That's a community fridge.
Nick: Man, someone has got to talk to Grissom about this.

Grissom: Talk to me about what?
Nick: You leaving your experiments in our refrigerator.
Grissom: Well, the lab fridge was full. I put in last night. 
Nick: Well ... 
Grissom: I'm going to test for horizontal motion on bloodstains. Vis-a-vis surface textures. 

Grissom: Hey, any of you guys got any linoleum at home?

Nick:  That blood is rank, man.
Grissom: I know. That's why the Red Cross gives it to us 'cause it's past its expiration date.

Grissom:  Anything new on the body farm victim?

Catherine: I gave the prints to identification. They're running through the bases now.
Grissom: Okay.

Grissom: I'll be in autopsy. Let me know.

Warrick:  Way to go, Nick. You really told him.
Nick: I told him, he just ... doesn't hear it.
Warrick:  Yeah.




Robbins: Well ... the entry wound tells me the body sustained a projectile.
Grissom: A bullet.
Robbins: Uh, but there's no bullet fragments in the tissue and no exit wound.
Grissom: So, how do you explain that?
Robbins: Bullet wounds usually leave bullet evidence.

Robbins: There's no evidence of a bullet in this wound tract.
Grissom: So, let's excise it. Do a more localized search.
Robbins: That was my next suggestion.
Grissom: What's your best tool for excising the tissue of our Mr. Doe?

Catherine: Oh, it's not a John Doe anymore. Database says that our victim is Mike Kimble age 38. He has a townhouse in Summerlin. Brass is going to meet us there along with the rest of the unit. My bet says that it's the primary crime scene.
Grissom: Good.

Catherine: Aren't you coming?
Grissom: We're excising a wound tract.
Catherine: Sounds fascinating.
Grissom: It is.





 
Catherine: Is that Mike Kimble's house?
Warrick: That's it.

Catherine: Seems like somebody beat us here.
Warrick: You think? Neighbor called it in. She smelled the smoke. Thought he was barbecuing in his living room.
Catherine: Where's his neighbor now?
Warrick: Over there talking to Brass.

Female Neighbor: Um, no, I didn't hear any noise coming from Mike's place last night. But, um ... I was wearing my headphones, doing my workout.
Brass: Did Mr. Kimble have many visitors to his house?
Female Neighbor: Other than his clients, just, um ... just his fiancée, Jane. Uh, but they usually stayed at her place.
Brass: Do you have the full name and address of the victim's fiancée, Jane?
Female Neighbor: Yes, actually I do. It's in my kitchen. Uhm ... As soon as they let me back in I can get for you.




Robbins: Something. A metal fragment. It's not like any bullet I've ever seen.

Robbins: Titanium ... maybe a pin.
Grissom: From the ribs?
Robbins: Oh, here's the manufacturer's number. I should've bought stock when I first started finding all these medical implants.

Grissom: Bovine.
Robbins: Excuse me?
Grissom: Genus hypaderma. These are normally found in the intestinal tract of cows. These maggots aren't found in humans. 
Robbins: Foreign tissue. Cow. Makes absolutely no sense.
Grissom: The body farm also studies animals, not just humans.
Robbins: This more of your cross contamination?
Grissom: Only one way to find out.




 



Warrick: What up, doc? Oh, there you are.
Nick: Sorry I'm late. D.A. Wanted an update on my robbery case.
Warrick: Oh, it's all good. I'm just starting my walk-through.
Nick: The desk is crispy.
Warrick: There's a burn pattern for you. Fire burns upward. This is moving downward.
Nick: Defies the laws of physics. Fire's drawn to fire. Well, you know what we gotta do.
Warrick: Check out the upstairs?


Nick: The guy who started the fire wanted to make sure the bedroom got it worse.
Warrick: How do you know it's a guy? Why are you jumping the gun?
Nick: Well, according to Sara, 94% of all arsonists are male.
Warrick: Yeah, that sounds like Sara.
Nick: The fire burned longest here.
Warrick: It's the point of origin.
Nick: Yeah, right here. 

Warrick: I don't smell any accelerant.
Nick: Could have burned off. Fabric would have fueled it.
Warrick: I don't know. It doesn't make any sense. A fire burning downward?
 
Nick:  Yeah, unless it was chasing after an accelerant. 
Warrick:  Furniture polish.

Nick: Warrick ... is that blood?

Warrick: Oh, man. Something bad happened here.
Nick: This fire is just a cover up.




Jody :  Hi.
Brass: I'm Detective Jim Brass. Is Jane Bradley in?
Jody Bradley: She's in the kitchen.  Really? No way.





Jane Bradley:  This can't be happening. Mike is dead? I don't know how I'm going to tell my kids. They love Mike.
Catherine: You and Mike were engaged?
Jane Bradley: The wedding was supposed to be in a week at the Tangiers.

Jane Bradley: No sweets after ten. What's the rule?
Jake Bradley: Oh, come on, mom, I'm starving.

Jane Bradley: Have an apple.

Jane Bradley: He's growing like a weed.
Brass: What was your fiancé's business?
Jane Bradley: He was a photographer. He did weddings, events. We argued over who'd do our wedding because he didn't trust anyone else's work.

Russ Bradley: Hi.
Jane Bradley: How many times have I said you have to knock? You can't just barge in this house.
Russ Bradley: Maybe as many times as I've asked you to have the kids ready and out front on my nights?
Brass: You must be the ex-husband.
Russ Bradley: What's going on? Are the kids all right? Is Jake in some kind of trouble?
Jane Bradley: No.
Brass: Mike Kimble was killed tonight.
Russ Bradley: Are you serious?
Catherine: Would you mind showing us your hands?
Russ Bradley: My hands? Why?
Catherine: To see if there's any gun powder or evidence of a burn on them.
Russ Bradley: Sure.  Look, uh, I don't want to be rude, but ... I stop paying alimony the day Mike and Jane get married. I mean, I'm the last person who would have killed him.
Brass: If we wanted to get in touch with you, how would we reach you?
Russ Bradley: You can reach me at any of my four grocery stores. Any time.

Brass: We'll be in touch.
Russ Bradley: I'm going to get the kids, if that's all right.
Jane Bradley: They're in the den.




Grissom: Accelerant.

Nick: Hey. Yeah, Warrick said the fire was orange so low-temperature fuel. Something accessible ... gasoline, kerosene ... I thought you were at the post.
Grissom: I was. 
Nick: So, anyway, this is where the fire started. Victim's bedroom.
 



Nick: Grissom ... Gris ...
Grissom: Sometimes, it's about where the fire isn't.


Nick:  Sometimes, I hate this job.






CAMERA PANS TO:

Catherine:  We have evidence that Mike may have had an inappropriate relationship with your daughter.
Jane Bradley: What kind of evidence?

Brass:  Photographic and definitive.
Jane Bradley: That the man I was going to marry somehow sexually ... no, I don't believe that.
Catherine: Things like this happen sometimes right under our noses. We're going to have to talk with your daughter.



Catherine: Jody, we found pictures in Mike's house of you posing. 
Jane Bradley: Tell her Mike would never do anything to hurt you.
Catherine: In some of the pictures ... 
Jane Bradley:  He truly was like a father to both kids.
Jody Bradley:  I wish you would just listen once.
Catherine: In some of the pictures you're wearing a bathing suit. Do you remember Mike taking them?



Catherine: Jody ... anything that he did to you was not your fault. You can tell me if Mike took those pictures.
Jane Bradley: Jody? Honey?
Jody Bradley: I loved Mike and he loved me.

Catherine: The daughter clammed up. Seems to be in the protect-the-abuser trap. I'm going to take her over to the hospital for a SART exam. 
Brass: What are the chances mom knew what her boyfriend was up to?
Catherine: I've seen it happen. As a mother, I hope not.
Brass: Yeah, right. I'm going to look into it.




Nick: Well, our photo guys tell me those pictures were taken with Mike Kimble's type of camera.

Warrick: Yeah?
Nick: Yeah. What are you doing here?
Warrick: A thousand points of light and I only need one to clear up this picture. The blur equals the length of the light. 


(Close up of a fuzzy JODY BRADLEY with the following on screen:
[LUMENS/BLUR RATIO: 20.5558%
REDUCING BLUR ] )

[LUMENS/BLUR RATIO: 34.783%
REDUCING BLUR ]

Warrick: If I can compress this light back into a point then the rest of the picture gets clear. That's how they got Hinkley's image when he was shooting the prez.
Nick: What is that? There at the bottom right corner? Is that a finger?
Warrick: Yeah, I think so.
Nick: Well, that's unusual, isn't it? A professional photographer gets a finger in the shot?
Warrick: Maybe his good hand was otherwise engaged. I'm going to work on that for a while and see if I can get some ridge detail. Maybe even a fat print.
Nick: I'll ... I'll see you later.





Sara: So, this is your experiment, huh? So, because you found beef in the wound tracts of the victim, you think the meat might be from one of the body farm cows?
Grissom: Did the fly find the beef in the wound and lay its eggs or did it bring the beef with him?
Sara: I did an experiment similar to this in San Francisco except the cross-contamination was blood. Wasn't a murder case, but it was instructional.

Grissom: None of these beef particles are as big as the tissue found in Mike Kimble's wound tract. And I found out the ex-husband is the proud owner of a registered handgun.
Sara: Hmm, what does that mean?
Grissom: It means I need to see that gun.

Sara: Uh, Grissom ... aren't you going to tell me anything?
Grissom: About?
Sara: The case, the meat, what you found ...?
Grissom: I'm working it.
Sara: I thought I was working it with you.
Grissom: Yes. You're right, you are. So, take some photos of the experiment for the D.A. And then ... uh ... get rid of that stuff.

Sara: That meat... the raw meat... me?
Grissom: Yeah.
Sara: How many meals have we shared together?
Grissom: I don't know.
Sara: Take a guess -- over a year working together.
Grissom: Thirty.
Sara: I'm a vegetarian. Everyone here knows I'm a vegetarian. I haven't eaten meat since we stayed up that night with that dead pig. It pains me to see ground beef; forget about cleaning it up.
Grissom: Okay. Have Nick do it.




Russ Bradley: You're telling me this b*st*rd took pictures of my daughter?
Brass: Yes, we found them at his house.
Russ Bradley: I never liked the way he looked at Jody. I've never liked it.
Brass: How did he look at her?
Russ Bradley: Touchy-feely. 

Russ Bradley: It wasn't normal. I told Jane when she started seeing him he's not a good guy. He's not good for our family. But you can't control who your ex-wife dates.

Brass: Russ Bradley, Gil Grissom, CSI lab. 
Grissom: Thanks for coming in.  Is this your gun?
Russ Bradley: Yes.
Grissom: May I take a look at it? 
Russ Bradley: Please.

Grissom: It's been cleaned.
Russ Bradley: Of course. You never, never store a dirty firearm.
Grissom: May I ask what kind of ammunition you use?
Russ Bradley: A .38 special. It takes .38s. 

Russ Bradley:  Whatever's on sale.




Warrick: There you are. I got something for you from trace.

Warrick: Sara?
Sara: Almost finished.

Warrick: They isolated the accelerant used in the fire. It's alcohol based. 
Sara: Acetone, methyl methacrylate? Nail polish remover.
Warrick: Guess that's the six percent no one talks about. Female fire starters.





Doctor: What's this... a burn?
Jody Bradley: Yeah.
Doctor: How'd that happen?
Jody Bradley: On a curling iron.



Doctor: I'll give you a prescription for antibiotics. Let's do the last portion of your exam now, okay?
Doctor :  Excuse me.

Doctor: Okay, lay back. Scoot back a little more. Just a little more. Very good. Take a deep breath. This won't hurt at all.





Grissom: It's melting.

(Quick CGI POV of hand holding gun and squeezing trigger. Sound of gun firing. Camera close up of hammer cocking back and extreme close up of hammer hitting the 38 SPL bullet. Quick FX to bullet firing through the barrel of the gun and penetrating through the skin with bits of flesh splattering out. Bullet continues its path through the body. Cut to inside view of the body where bits and pieces of bone, bullet and ice break up inside the body where some pieces embed themselves to the nearest organ and melt. Flash to white. 









Catherine: Sara's not going to be too happy with that experiment in the fridge. 
Grissom: I'm putting it in the freezer.

Catherine: The doctor finished the exam on Jody Bradley. Physical findings: Scarring, chronic sexual abuse. 

Grissom: Well, have Brass get a warrant for the mother's house. Check the evidence we recovered from the dead boyfriend's house. They stayed in both places.
Catherine: Listen, there's a good chance the daughter's our arsonist. She had second-degree burns on her wrist.
Grissom: One thing at a time.
Catherine: Right. You coming with?
Grissom: I can't. Take Nick.
Catherine: Right. Experiment.









 
CUT TO 


Catherine: That's the girl's nightgown.




Nick:  We've got some samples coming in. They're priority one.
Jane Bradley: What is that ... what did you find?
Catherine: Child Services will be remanding Jody to a foster home.
Jane Bradley: Was my fiancé involved in any way?

Brass: He's not your fiancé. Not anymore, anyway.
Catherine: Jim?
Brass: I just got back from the events office at the Tangiers where you and Mike were supposed to be married. You canceled your wedding five days ago. I even have your credit card receipt for the ten percent cancellation charge. You didn't like the way he looked at your daughter any more than your ex did.
Jane Bradley: No. I just got cold feet.
Catherine: Convenient timing.
Jane Bradley: Look, when Russ and I got married 20 years ago you couldn't find two happier people and now we can barely stand to be civil. I didn't want to make another mistake.
Catherine: It wasn't that you 'sensed' what was going on?
Jane Bradley: Mike would not do what he's being accused of. Believe me.
Catherine: I'll believe the DNA.



;




Greg: Kind of feels like blackjack, you know? You guys all fanned around the table, holding your breath waiting to see which card I'll reveal next.
Warrick: Greg, this is an abuse case involving a minor.
Greg: Right. Sorry. So, I have DNA samples from every male that lives with Jody Bradley full-time or weekends. First, I have Mike Kimble, the fiancé. Dead fiancé.

Brass: &quot;Match not found.&quot; You got to be kidding me.
Greg: Sorry, Captain.
Brass: The guy has naked pictures of her in his townhouse. The mother called off their wedding.
Greg: DNA takes a pair.
Catherine: So, whose is it, the father? 

Grissom: &quot;Match not found.&quot;
Greg: Third and last.

Nick: Give me that. 

Nick: How'd we miss that?



Jake Bradley: No. No, I never did anything like that to my sister, no.

Brass: How do you explain your semen on her nightgown?
Jake Bradley: I can't ... I can't.
Brass: The county automatically provides your son with an advocate. We can't proceed until he arrives.




Grissom: You getting anywhere with the print?
Warrick: I'm still trying to enhance it. It's kind of frustrating, that, uh this picture puts us at the very moment of the crime but we can't see what she's seeing.
Grissom: They say the eyes are the window to the soul.
Warrick: Yeah, my grandma used to say that all the time.
Grissom: In a way, it's true. The aqueous fluid and the vitreous in the human eye allows for an image to be reflected in it.
Warrick: Well, maybe ... if I enhanced the reflection in her eye with the right combination of algorithms ...
Grissom: I think my popsicles are ready.




Brass: Jake, did you take pictures of your sister and plant them in Mike Kimble's house?
Jake Bradley: No.
Brass: You do have keys to his house, though. Right? I mean, your mother told us that both you kids do.
Jake Bradley: Yes, but I didn't plant anything.
Child Advocate: He didn't take the pictures. He didn't plant them. He has no idea how his DNA got in his sister's nightgown.
Brass: Well, maybe a little hobbit put it there.

Child Advocate: That's it, we're done.
Nick: All right, hold on. You mind if I talk to Jake alone?
Child Advocate: To what end?
Nick: I have a hunch.



Nick: Everyone does it, Jake. You just ... feel like you're the only one. Then when you don't do it, it happens in your sleep anyway, right? Yeah. And then you go to take a leak, dust off the equipment and just grab the first thing that's handy, huh?
Jake Bradley:  It was just... on the hamper.
Nick: Your sister's nightgown?

Jake Bradley: The next thing I know, I'm getting, like ... questioned by the police and my parents are looking at me like I'm some sort of ... pervert.
Nick: Yeah, that's rough. Rough. Well, listen, in the future, dude ... even if the situation's embarrassing, the truth's probably the best policy there.
Jake Bradley: Yeah.
Nick: Hey, listen, you ever notice your mom's boyfriend acting weird around your sister? Like a little, uh ... too friendly, too forward?
Jake Bradley:  Mmm, no. No, I mean, my sister is the one that's kind of weird.
Nick: Really?
Jake Bradley: Yeah.
Nick: How?
Jake Bradley: She's just always just, you know, &quot;Mike's coming over. I can't wait till Mike gets here.&quot;
Nick: Mm. Mm-hmm. You like the guy?
Jake Bradley: When, uh, my parents were getting divorced my mom, she cried, like, every day and, uh, Mike showed up and she stopped crying so ... yeah. I guess.




Grissom: What are you doing here? Isn't this your day off? 
Robbins: On the day you plan to expend a meat bullet? Ahh ... a frozen meat bullet?
Grissom: Yeah, I had to freeze it with a touch of liquid nitrogen.
Robbins: Well, I'm ready to watch history.

Robbins: Bullet-like entry wound. 

Robbins:  The meat disintegrates. Lost in the soft tissue. Hmm.



Brass: You're quite a marksman, Russ ... and inventive. You managed to build a bullet made of meat. 
Grissom: The meat from the projectile was visually indistinguishable from the victim's stomach tissue. We know that your gun was clean but it turns out that your re-loader wasn't.
Brass: Yeah. We got this from your garage on a warrant. We figured a gun enthusiast like yourself would have one of these. Packs gunpowder into used shell casings. Cheaper than buying new rounds, right?
Grissom: The material that was on your re-loader is consistent with the material we found in the victim's wound tract. Ground beef.
Russ Bradley: A father knows. I mean, he was giving her gifts, you know, cameras.

Grissom: He gave her a camera?
Russ Bradley: And the wedding was, like, a week off and he was going to be living under the same roof as my children full-time. When I went over there you know, I was just going to set him straight, right? You know what he says?

Mike Kimble: Now, I can't help it if she likes me. I guess it's like mother, like daughter.
Russ Bradley: You touch my little girl and I will kill you.
Mike Kimble: Too late.

Russ Bradley: That's when I lost it.
Brass: Then you dumped him at the body farm. Your grocery chain makes regular meat deliveries there for experimental purposes. Then what? You arsoned his place to cover up the murder?

Brass:  Grabbed the nail polish remover from the bedside table poured it all over the place?
Russ Bradley: I'll tell you the truth. I ... I feel relieved. I'd like to make a formal confession.



Grissom: He can confess to the homicide but we're still examining evidence on the arson.
Brass: The guy wants to take the heat for his daughter on the arson well, where's the harm in that?
Grissom: The harm would be to the justice system unless I misunderstand our place in it.
Brass: Don't you think that little girl's been through enough?
Grissom: What I think and what the evidence proves are possibly two different things.





Grissom: What is this?
Sara: It's, uh, just what it says: It's a request for a leave of absence -- six months ... year, maybe.
Grissom: Why?
Sara: I was thinking of checking out the federal government system - FBI ...

Grissom: We have the best lab in the country.
Sara: I need a different work environment.
Grissom: What does that mean?
Sara: One with, um, communication ... respect.
Grissom: Everybody here respects you.
Sara: You don't.
Grissom: Is this about that hamburger thing?
Sara: No, Grissom ... this is not about that &quot;Hamburger&quot; thing. I-I-I don't believe you. How can you reduce everything that I've said to some kind of single quirk? Do you think the problem here is just about me? 

Sara: If you don't sign my leave, I'm going to have to quit.

Grissom: Hey, Sara? 

Grissom: The Lab needs you here.
Sara: Great.







Grissom: Did you hear the dad copped a plea on the murder and the D.A. expedited it?
Catherine: Voluntary man, first offense. Out on bail. Free in four. No jury was going to convict a father for killing his daughter's abuser. What do you have?
Grissom: Accelerant. Identical to the type found at the arson. Police got it out of Jody's gym locker.

Catherine: Looks as if Jody was probably telling the truth. She did burn herself on a curling iron.
Grissom: So who started the fire?




Nick: Hey.
Warrick: Hey.
Nick: You get anywhere with those fingerprints?
Warrick: Back burner. I've been working on this reflection in her eye. You see what I'm seeing?
Nick: No.
Warrick: Come on, man. I've been working on this enhancement all night. Look closer.
Nick: What is it? A clock, a mirror? It's got a latch, a lock. A porthole? ... It's a porthole?
Warrick: Yeah. These pictures were taken on a boat.



Warrick: Miss Bradley.
Jane Bradley: Yes.
Warrick: Warrick Brown. Your fiancé, Mike, did he own a boat?
Jane Bradley: A boat? No.
Warrick: No? Did he borrow one or rent one?
Jane Bradley: He wanted to borrow my ex-husband's boat but he was too proud to ask.
Warrick: Your ex-husband owned a boat?
Jane Bradley: He bought one after our divorce. I've never been on it.
Warrick:  Okay. Thank you.









Catherine: Jody? We know that Mike gave you his camera. We suspect that your father used it to take pictures of you on his boat. 

Catherine: We believe that he then placed the camera back at Mike's to implicate him along with the pictures.
Jody Bradley: He said I was like my mom when she was young and they were happy. He said having me was like having his family back.

Catherine: Did you ever tell your mom?
Jody Bradley: I tried.
&lt;FLASHBACK&gt;
Jody Bradley: I don't want to go to dad's.
Jane Bradley: You know what the judge said: Two weeks with dad, two with me.
&lt;/FLASHBACK&gt;
Catherine: Jody, we have strong forensic evidence against your father. But cases like this are very difficult to prove. A victim testifying makes all the difference.
Jody Bradley: He told me if I ever talked, he'd kill me.
Catherine: Jody, if you don't talk ...
Jody Bradley: I told Mike and he was going to fix things. 

Jody Bradley: And my dad killed him ... okay?


Warrick: Catherine.
Catherine: What is this?

Warrick: Found it on the boat. DNA just ran it. She's under 14, right?
Catherine: Yeah, 12.




Brad Gottleib: He didn't take pictures of his daughter. He never touched her. He's a loving, devoted father who works hard at his chain of grocery stores to keep her in good schools.
Grissom: Except when she's on his boat, right?

Grissom: This is your sleeping bag we took off your boat. Our lab turned it inside-out. The discoloration you see is a mixture of vaginal and seminal fluid ... your daughter's and yours.
Russ Bradley: Okay.
Brad Gottleib: Don't say a word, Russ.
Brass: He doesn't have to. The sleeping bag's talking loud and clear.
Russ Bradley: Brad, make me a deal.
Brad Gottleib: I can't.
Russ Bradley: What do you mean you can't? You got me four years for murder.
Brad Gottleib: I can't.
Russ Bradley:  You can get me something.
Grissom:  No, he can't. In the State of Nevada, we're all bound by a legal statute. The sexual assault of a minor age 14 and under is a mandatory life sentence with no possibility for parole.





Catherine: Excuse me. Could I talk to you for a moment?
Jane Bradley: Why don't you wait over there, sweetie.
Jody Bradley: Okay.

Catherine: I owe you an apology. I have an eight-year-old daughter.
Jane Bradley: It's okay. You were looking out for mine.





Grissom:  Tough case, huh?

Catherine: Just give me a straight-ahead murder any day.
Grissom: Well, you wouldn't be human if it didn't affect you.

Catherine: I heard about you and ... uh ... Sara.
Grissom:  Sara, you know, she gets very emotional ... 

Catherine: Are you in denial? No, that's ... no, no ... way too analytical. Wow, you got burned bad, huh? Welcome to the club. I got third-degree burns from my marriage. Happens to everybody. Everybody just moves on.
Grissom: Good. Let's move on.

Catherine: But you have to deal with it. You have to deal with it first. You got to deal with it before it goes away. You are the supervisor. You have responsibilities, and people are making a family around you whether you like it not, whether you give them permission or not. We don't have to go to the Grand Tetons together, just ... every now and then you got to lift your head up out of that microscope.

Grissom: Yeah.





Grissom:  Yeah, hi. I-I-I'd like to get some flowers for a girl. No, no. Not flowers. A plant. A living plant. She likes vegetation.

Grissom: Yeah, that'd be fine. To a Sara Sidle. Deliver it at the CSI division, Las Vegas Police Department the one out on North Trop Boulevard. Yeah, you can bill me at the same place. Gil Grissom.  The sentiment? Oh-oh, on the card. Yeah. Um, uh ... have it say ... have it say, uh ... &quot;From Grissom.&quot;

Grissom:  Thank you.

Chief Rittle: I would, but Mina tends to get jealous.
Dark-haired Woman: I love you, Chief, but if anybody should be jealous, it's you. 
 
Chief Rittle: Who's that guy?

Dark-haired Woman: Hey, Chief ... didn't know you were into guys.

Mina Rittle: What guy?






DISSOLVE TO:




Sasha Rittle: Daddy?








Brass: So two nights ago he has a party. High-end guest list, very private. That was the last anyone saw of him. Housekeeper arrives 20 minutes ago. This is what she found.

Catherine: Ex-chief of detectives. Left to make the big bucks. Consultant with security at every major casino in town and couldn't even protect himself.
Grissom: There's only one interpretation for this: &quot;Kill the pig.&quot;
Catherine: And what about the rest of his family?
Brass: No sign of the wife.
Catherine: What about the daughter?
Brass: Housekeeper assumed that she spent the weekend with the grandmother.

Catherine: Assumed?






Catherine: She's gone.







Grissom: His wife and daughter are missing. His silver Cadillac DTS is also missing. We're looking for any signs of forced entry in the house, any signs of ransack that's not associated with the party.
Sara: Okay.

Brass: We need serious damage control. When the media gets a hold of it it's going to be bad for morale all around. Watch your step.
Warrick: I'll take the downstairs.
Nick: Yeah, I'll be above you.





Robbins: Looks execution-style. At least one shot to the back of the head. A lot of bruising around these handcuffs.
Grissom: So he probably fought back.

Catherine: Found a shell casing. 
 
Catherine: Looks like one of ours.
Grissom: Nine millimeter standard issue.
Catherine: So where do you suppose the Chief keeps his gun safe?

SCENE #08




 

Scott: We're in.

Catherine: Thank you, Scott.
Scott: No problem.

Brass: What do you got? 

Brass: Thirty-eight .

Catherine: Nice.
Brass: Pearl handle Twenty-five . 

Brass: Clear?
Catherine: Still looking for that Nine .

Catherine: So you think the Chief might've kept his signature piece someplace else?
Brass:  &quot;For Twenty-Five years of distinguished service.&quot; An honor like that. Keep it in the case.
Catherine:  Yeah.




Catherine: So I'm thinking that the wife might be in on this.
Grissom: Why didn't she plan better? Pack the kid's clothes.
Catherine: What?
Grissom: The nanny told me that she only took one shirt -- one the kid wouldn't even wear.

Det. Lockwood: Security guard. No party list but he did see each car that left the night of the party and morning.
Security Guard: Chief Rittle left around 5:00 A.M.  5:14 to be exact.

Grissom: You saw Chief Rittle leave?
Security Guard: Yeah, he was with his wife and kid. And he had his baseball cap and sunglasses on like he always does. 
Catherine: So, you saw a baseball cap and sunglasses.

Catherine: Did you actually see the chief's face 
Grissom:  Grissom.
Security Guard: Well ... actually, I didn't.

Grissom: Brass found the Chief's Cadillac.




Grissom: Who found it?
Brass: In-house security. Blue jacket. First time he saw the car was Saturday. Chalked the tires twice. Saw the bulletin on the Chief and called us.
Catherine: Any bodies, Joe?
Officer Joe: I already checked inside the car.
Brass: We were waiting on you to check the trunk.

Brass: Whoa. 
 
Brass: Excuse me.
Catherine: Who is this?

Grissom: &quot;Chief Rittle&quot;?
Catherine: What is his connection to the chief?
Grissom: I don't know. But if he has gunpowder residue on him, could be our shooter. 
Brass:  Okay.

Brass: Florida highway patrol called. Several motorists saw a girl matching Sasha's exact physical description walking along an access road.
Grissom: In Florida?
Brass: Miami-Dade county. Chief was shot Friday night. It's a two-day drive if you don't stop. It's national news with national attention. I'm not surprised we're getting call-ins.
Grissom: Well, if it is our little girl, she's got evidence on her from two Vegas homicides. 

Grissom: One of us should be down there to process.

Grissom: Take Warrick. I don't think he's ever been to Florida.








Patrol Captain: She's seven years old! She's wearing a pink shirt! She was last seen by a motorist there! She can be two kilometers in either direction. Think of this area as a quadrant. Divide up. You, north. 
Officer 2: Got it!
Patrol Captain: You, south.
Officer 3: We got it!

Officers: All right, this way.
Officers: Let's go.

Officers: Clear out!
Officers: Watch your back!









Horatio Caine: Sasha?!

Horatio Caine:  Sasha. My name is Horatio Caine. I'm the head of the crime unit.
Sasha Rittle: Horatio?

HORTIO CAINE: Yeah.  That's a funny name, isn't it? My mother named me after a famous writer named Horatio Alger. Ever hear of him?

Sasha Rittle: Is your badge real?
Horatio Caine: Yeah. Yeah, that's real.
Sasha Rittle: My daddy's a policeman.

Horatio Caine: I know that.  I &quot;knew&quot; that.
Sasha Rittle: They're looking for me, you know.
Horatio Caine: Me, too. Me, too. What do you say we sit here and get found together?


Horatio Caine:  What a day.









Officer: Burgundy sedan. Caucasian female. Age 32. Traveling with a caucasian male indeterminate age.
Horatio Caine: I got a female in distress. I want the APB to extend the whole state.
Officer: Panhandle to the Keys. Yes, sir.
Horatio Caine: Good.

Horatio Caine: Horatio Caine.
Catherine: Catherine Willows.

Horatio Caine: Caine.
Warrick: Brown.

Horatio Caine: Child services has sent a doctor out.
Catherine: All right, let's just be clear. This is a Las Vegas case. This is our victim and we do the processing.
Horatio Caine: Okay, I didn't say he processed her. I just said he was here.
Catherine: I appreciate the respect.
Horatio Caine: You sure about that?
Warrick: Does she know about her father?
Horatio Caine: Not yet.
Warrick: Well, I'd like to get started processing. Can you show me who you found?
Horatio Caine: Okay, I found her right in here. 

Horatio Caine: And ... this is the young lady right over here.

Catherine: Hi, Sasha. I'm Catherine Willows. And ... I need to ask you a few questions. Okay? 

Catherine: My kit. Did the man touch you?

Sasha Rittle: He hit my mommy.
Catherine: Did he hit you? Did he hurt you in any way?
Sasha Rittle: He acted like I wasn't there.
Catherine: Well, you know what always happens to bad people? They leave behind a part of themselves and that's how you can help us find your mommy. Now, I need to look underneath your fingernails.

Catherine: You want to show me what's in your hand?

Horatio Caine: It's okay.

Catherine: Where did you get that?

Mina Rittle: Go! Run, Sasha, run!

Sasha Rittle: I ran out after they drove off. I picked that up.
Horatio Caine: I bet it felt cold when you picked it up.
Sasha Rittle: No. No ... hot.
Horatio Caine: Hmm.
Sasha Rittle: You're tricking me.
Horatio Caine: You're too smart for that.





Calleigh Duquesne: You can spot a Glock cartridge from a block away: rectangular, firing pin impression, breach face shear. This casing's no Glock. It's isn't your chief's weapon.
Warrick: Well, whoever this guy is, he's a lousy shot.
Calleigh Duquesne: Five casings, no hits. Oh, by the way, I'm Calleigh Duquesne. Don't ask me how to spell it. Southern.
Catherine: Catherine Willows. Southern ... Nevada.

Calleigh Duquesne: You got a theory on how the mother and daughter ended up all the way in Miami from Las Vegas?
Catherine: We don't really work theories. Do we, Warrick?
Warrick: No, just evidence.
Calleigh Duquesne: We're much more fanciful down here. Aren't we, Horatio?
Horatio Caine: I think that's a fair description.
Calleigh Duquesne: My guess is that this belongs to a Taurus 9, made in Brazil. It's a cheap beretta knockoff and you may not see many of them in Vegas but we get them down here all the time. Which makes me think this guy wasn't fleeing Las Vegas.
Horatio Caine: He was coming home to Miami. 




Robbins: Well, it's no longer &quot;trunk man.&quot; Identified him from his dental records. Jason Doyle. Dead for three days; no GSR.
Grissom: So, I guess he didn't shoot Rittle.
Robbins: We only recovered one slug from his cranium.

Robbins: And I got this fragment from his lower back.
Grissom: His lower back? I thought he was shot twice in the head.
Robbins: Vascular embolization. Bullet got into his arterial system.
Grissom: That's rare.
Robbins: Well, it took a full-body x-ray for me to find the thing. Bullet entered here ... 


Robbins:  ... fragmenting at the neck and losing velocity upon penetration 

Robbins: ... of the carotid artery. Tube down the aorta, continually losing momentum. 
 
Robbins: As it exited the aorta, it struck the vertebral column and then was swept down to the base of the aorta ...

Robbins: ... where I recovered it here at the lumbar region.

Grissom: Pinball.
Robbins: Looks like nines, like we found in the Chief.
Grissom: I'll call Catherine. Thanks.
Robbins: Yeah.





Sara: Hey, Nick ... ?
Nick: Mm-hmm?
Sara: You ever been to a swingers' party?
Nick: Well, if it's the same thing as a frat party yeah, lots of them. You know, you get enough booze going things can get pretty wild.
Sara: Frat party, huh? I wouldn't know anything about that. 

Sara: How wild?
Nick: Multiple-partner wild. And it'd be no big deal to have two, maybe three girls at once, just ...

Sara: Who's she?
Nick: Showgirl.




Tiffany Langer: Yes, I went to the party. No, I didn't go alone. And no, I'm not telling you my date's name or anyone else who was there. These people are important.
Grissom: Well, a very important police officer was murdered there.
Tiffany Langer: I don't care. It took me a long time to get into the circle and I plan on staying there.
Nick: Was there anybody there you didn't know?
Grissom: Anybody who wasn't in &quot;the circle&quot;?
Tiffany Langer: Well, my date.
Nick: Do you know where he is?
Tiffany Langer: I haven't seen him since that night. He sent me home with a Judge and his wife.
Nick: So ... your date stayed at the party after you left?
Tiffany Langer: As far as I know.
Nick: Where does he live?
Tiffany Langer: I don't know. I've known him for five days.
Grissom: Well, that's 120 hours. There must be something you know about him that you could share with us.
Tiffany Langer: Right-handed, a libra, circumcised, rich ... back-east rich. Which kind of surprised me because he wore really cheap cologne.
Grissom: Cheap? How?
Tiffany Langer: Smelled funny ... sweet.
Grissom: Are you sure it was cologne?
Tiffany Langer: Or deodorant. Mouthwash maybe. All I know is it smelled sickly sweet. To be honest I thought he could have used a little help in that department.
Grissom: Would you happen to have an article of clothing of his by any chance?
Tiffany Langer: The only thing he gave me was a good time.
Grissom: Hey, guess what? This isn't about you. This is about a missing seven-year-old girl.
Nick: Why don't you give us his name.
Tiffany Langer: Adam Van Der Welk.




Catherine: Uh, no, the chief's little girl is with child services. We're still at the drop-off place.  Yeah, right. Will do, Brass.
Warrick: I got a pill. 

Warrick: Looks like sedative.

Catherine: Okay.

Warrick: Diazapam. Benzos..
Calleigh Duquesne: That could explain why the mother didn't escape with her daughter. She was incapacitated.


Mina Rittle: Go!


Horatio Caine: How'd the little girl get away?
Catherine: We got some tire treads on the shoulder. Made an easy stop.
Horatio Caine: And why did he pick such a secluded area?
Warrick: Seems like a great place to ice someone.
Horatio Caine: Or take a leak. Maybe that's why he stopped the car here... to take a leak.

Mina Rittle: Run! Run, Sash, run!


Horatio Caine: Let me ask you another question: When you're home alone do you lock the bathroom door?
Catherine: I don't even know you.
Horatio Caine: Sure you do. We all do. It's human nature to avoid being vulnerable, isn't it? So, if that's the case then he would look for a tree to shield himself, wouldn't he? 

Horatio Caine: So Then the question becomes, how far along this path before he loses sight of them?
Catherine: Not very far.
Horatio Caine: Look at this. Bang. Footprints ... and this is urine. 

Catherine: If you're lucky, urethral cells with slough off with urine. 
Horatio Caine: But if we get his DNA, there's a chance we'll get him.

Horatio Caine:  Yeah. Caine. What do you mean FBI?








Catherine: The guy has B.O.?
Grissom:  Body odor, bad breath ...


Grissom: I don't know. There's something about Adam Van Der Welk that makes him smell.
Catherine: All this because some showgirl said he smelled sweet?
Grissom:  &quot;Sickly sweet.&quot; 
Grissom: Smells can be like fingerprints, my dear. Hey, what's going on there?
 I thought you were meeting the Feds?
Catherine: Uh, yeah, we are. They picked the place. The Shore Club. Later. 

Catherine: What's taking so long?
Horatio Caine: That is a good question.

Tim Speedle: Hey, I just ran into a Fed in the lobby. He told me that apparently the Vegas case fits the profile of a serial the FBI's been tracking.
 Hey, you're from Vegas?
 
Tim Speedle: Speedle.
Warrick: Brown. 
Calleigh Duquesne: Where was the Fed?
Tim Speedle: He's right there in the lobby. He's got his little headphone on and his little tie.
Horatio Caine: And you talked to him?
Tim Speedle: Yeah.
Horatio Caine: Do they have an ID yet?
Tim Speedle: No ID yet, but their perp targets wealthy couples at their playgrounds ... Pebble Beach, Aspen, The Hamptons. Evidently the husbands get murdered first and the wives later. After they've enjoyed 48 hours of fun and games.

Catherine: 48?
Tim Speedle:  Speedle.
Catherine: Willows.

Horatio Caine: That's it?
Tim Speedle: There's also a link to Miami.
Horatio Caine:  Of course there is.

Tim Speedle: Or, you know, he could just be some geriatric dude that just digs the weather.
Catherine: I don't understand. Why didn't the Feds put this out on NCIC?
Calleigh Duquesne: Because they're Feds. 

Calleigh Duquesne: Excuse me.





Horatio Caine: Dennis ... Dennis ... tick-tock, Dennis. While you're waiting to get your ducks in a row the guy with the &quot;Miami link&quot; just slipped through my hands.
FBI Agent Dennis Sackheim: Horatio, I didn't have federal approval ... 
Horatio Caine: I need answers for this little girl. Her father's just been killed, maybe her mother, too. And that's your fault. You understand that.
FBI Agent Dennis Sackheim: It sounds like you're making this personal.
Horatio Caine: Dennis, you don't give me this link, I will make this very personal.

FBI Agent Dennis Sackheim: All of his victims stayed here in the last year.
Horatio Caine: Here? This hotel?
FBI Agent Dennis Sackheim: Rittle and his wife, too. Last winter.
Horatio Caine: Mm, I wish I would have known that. Maybe they'd still be alive. Yeah?

Horatio Caine:  si ... vamos. 

Horatio Caine:  I had a bad feeling about this.
FBI Agent Dennis Sackheim: What'd she just say to you?
Horatio Caine: She just said that you need to learn the language. 





Warrick: I don't see this burgundy car. Where are you looking?

Eric Delko: Check the disturbance along the bank and follow it in.
Warrick: How did you find the disturbance? Drive up and down the canals all day?
Eric Delko: No, the thing about Miami is the entire city's watched from above. Coast guard choppers. Someone going to cover me?
Horatio Caine: I got you.

Catherine: Cover you for what?
Eric Delko: Alligators.
Tim Speedle: Only way to out run a 'gator is to swim faster than the guy next to you. Isn't that right, Delko?
Eric Delko: Used to have a partner.

Horatio Caine: Guys ... please?







Horatio Caine: That her?
Catherine: Yeah, that's Mina Rittle.


Horatio Caine: Our guy's still in the wind, folks. Still in the wind.



;






Alexx Woods: What's her name?
Catherine: Mina Rittle.
Alexx Woods: Who wrapped you, Mina? The plastic wasn't for transport. Covering her intimates -- most likely sexual. Two gunshot wounds, left temple. One shot was a through-and-through. Trace ASAP along with the plastic. My preliminary probe shows water in the lungs which indicates she was still alive when she was put in the canal.

Alexx Woods: Looks like the eyes are glued shut. Gold crusty substance underneath. What is that, Mina?

Horatio Caine: The substance is water-soluble.
Catherine: But somehow it got preserved in the water. My guess is the plastic was wrapped around her eyes at some point.
Alexx Woods: Wait a minute. 

 
Alexx Woods: There's a lot more of it. What do you want to bet this is in every orifice? 

Alexx Woods: You guys got a sick one.





Eric Delko: Aha!
Tim Speedle: Delko, you've been down there for 45 minutes. Do you know the level of bacteria in the water? You can get all kinds of infections. What do you got?
Eric Delko: Water pistol. 

Eric Delko: One water-logged beretta knock-off.
Tim Speedle: Suspect's personal gun?
Eric Delko: That's it.
Tim Speedle: Congratulations.
Eric Delko: I'll put it over the wires that he's not carrying that Taurus anymore.
Tim Speedle: Do that, and take a shower.
Eric Delko: Nice shoes.





Composite Artist: Ma'am, you have to concentrate on the face. In parts, not just the whole.
Tiffany Langer: Ask me what he wore. Ask me if he was good in bed. Just don't ask me how close together his eyes were.
Nick: You said he kind of looked like Ricky Martin, right?
Tiffany Langer: Yeah, with a touch of Jude Law.
Composite Artist: Try to not just picture him. Try to think of an event.
Tiffany Langer: Okay ... three-way kiss. His lower lip was kind of pouty ... 

Tiffany Langer: and he had this Michael Douglas thing working, you know --- a cleft in his chin.

Composite Artist: Kind of like that?
Tiffany Langer: Yeah. You're right. That is easier.




(SASHA RITTLE works with a composite artist who is also drawing a picture of the 








Catherine:  Adam Van Der Welk. Little girl saw a monster. Showgirl saw a husband. So this guy could be anybody.
Nick: Yeah, that's the problem with eyewitnesses. All the more reason to rely on evidence. Tell Warrick hey. Let me know if anything breaks.
Catherine: You, too.

Horatio Caine: Hey.
Warrick: Hey.
Horatio Caine: So, how's your colleague Grissom doing on the aroma angle?
Catherine: I'm sure he's making progress but Grissom rarely says anything until he's good and ready.
Horatio Caine: Smart man. I just wanted to show you something. The sticky substance we got off the wife is, in fact, honey.
Catherine: You say that like it means something.
Horatio Caine: Well, honey on its own is just honey, but when you add plastic wrap, it's ... a different situation.





Crowd: Five... four... three ... ...two... one...


Catherine: Yum. This is where he got the idea.
Horatio Caine: Yep. 


Horatio Caine: Wish me luck.

Horatio Caine: Excuse me. Excuse me.

Horatio Caine: Hi
Showgirl: Some guys like to lick it off.
Horatio Caine: Really? I'm partial to the swab myself.

Catherine: Ready, honey?
Horatio Caine: Coming, dear.





Robbins: Tuberculosis victims emit breath that smells like wet leaves.

Grissom: Maple, elm, ash, what?
Robbins: I'm not sure. 

Brass: Miami is pulling cars out of canals -- chasing leads, debriefing the kid -- and you guys are flipping through textbooks?
Grissom: This is how I work.

Brass: Tuberculosis ... Cyanide poisoning ... Endocrinology.

Grissom: I'm following my nosino.
Brass: You're closer to this Van Der Welk guy than you're letting on aren't you?

Brass:  Doctor.

Robbins: How about Darier disease? 
Grissom: Doesn't that give you a rash that smells like human excrement we're looking for something a little sweeter.
Robbins: There's diabetic ketoacidosis. Body has excess glucose which converts to ketone ... Gets expelled through the pores. Has a fruity smell. It would help if we had a piece of the assailant's clothing.

Robbins: What?
Grissom: I think I overlooked some evidence.





Tim Speedle: I'm going to isolate it using high-performance liquid chromatography. Once we identify the pollen we'll know if it's floral honey.


Tim Speedle: So, H, when's the last time you were in Hives?
Horatio Caine: I was there opening night.
Tim Speedle: I didn't see you there.
Horatio Caine: I was, uh ... VIP.

Horatio Caine: What is this?
Tim Speedle: It's tupelo honey. It's the purest of all honeys. Stays in liquid form for life. Doesn't crystallize or harden.
Horatio Caine: Where'd you get that?
Tim Speedle: CDC hipped me to it after that africanized bee problem.
Horatio Caine: Okay, let's swap this out. I want you to take a look at this.

Horatio Caine: We got this off the chief's wife.

Tim Speedle: It's a match.

Horatio Caine: It's a match.




Warrick: $500 for five dollars worth of honey? I don't think it's worth it.
Nightclub Manager: Those are mostly for decoration but once in a while some bigwig comes takes one of them out of here.
Horatio Caine: Wouldn't it have been easier to put these in order? This is going to take forever.
Calleigh Duquesne:  Maybe not. I've got a receipt from just two nights ago.
Horatio Caine: Let me see that.



Catherine: Do you recognize this guy?
Security: Yeah, looks just like every other Joe that comes in here.
Catherine: Look, you work the door. Anybody come in here in the last 48 hours that bought some of that very expensive tupelo this is Miami.
Security: Every night's a weekend.

Horatio Caine: My people tell me that a customer came in here two nights ago to buy some.
Security: Wasn't a customer. It was a limo driver.
Catherine: A limo driver?
Security: Yeah, Gordon. Gave me a c-note just to double park.
Horatio Caine: Did this Gordon tell you who he had in back of his car?
Security: No. Just that it was some rich guy -- some high roller.
Catherine: Let me guess-- from Vegas.
Security: Yeah.








Horatio Caine: How'd you find him?
Tim Speedle: Figured, limo driver -- airport. I spotted Gordon here on Alton -- back way to Miami International. Lit him up, pulled him over here.
Horatio Caine: Nice work. You got a last name, Gordon?
Gordon Daimler: Daimler. Look, officer, the Corwins are coming in on their own private jet. They're two of my best customers. I really should be there.
Horatio Caine: Well, the Corwins are going to have to wait.
Catherine: We understand that another one of your customers bought some very expensive honey from a club.
Gordon Daimler: Yeah, well, I've had stranger requests.
Catherine: This customer of yours have a name?
Gordon Daimler: Never got it. He paid cash. Never saw a credit card.
Catherine: Well, did you notice anything unusual about him? Did he smell? Did he ... have an odor?
Gordon Daimler: Uh, his breath maybe. He'd been drinking a lot.
Horatio Caine: Remember what he was drinking? Was it sweet like irish whiskey?
Gordon Daimler: Whatever I have stocked.
Catherine: Well, we'd like to take a look.
Gordon Daimler: Sure. Go ahead.


Catherine: Vodka.

Catherine: Gin.

Horatio Caine: Hmm. Smell that?
Catherine: Sickly sweet. That's exactly how Grissom described it.




Tiffany Langer: You want me to do what?
Grissom: Smell this.

Tiffany Langer: That's it. That's Adam's smell.
Grissom: In the five days that you two were together, did you happen to notice what he was drinking?
Tiffany Langer: Champagne.
Grissom: Did he ever drink anything sweeter like whiskey or cognac?
Tiffany Langer: No, Are you kidding me? With him it was all dom, all the time.





Catherine: You found a medical condition.
Grissom: Diabetic ketoacidosis - 
INTERCUT WITH

Grissom: it's an insulin deficiency. His body's been expelling excess glucose. Makes him smell fruity.
Catherine: Which I guess could easily be mistaken for whiskey breath. Hey, can you test for diabetic ketoacidosis off urine?
Grissom: Well, blood's the best but if you had a urine sample, maybe.
Horatio Caine: Ask him what medication you would take for that.
Catherine: What would a doctor prescribe? 
Grissom: Novalin insulin.





Horatio Caine: Lucky for us we found blood in his urine.
Catherine: Absence of c-peptide in the blood. Means the insulin in our guy's system isn't natural -- it's synthetic.
Horatio Caine: And prescribed. Right over here. It's our database.

Horatio Caine: Okay, what we're looking for is a patient who's purchased synthetic insulin in the last 48 hours.

Catherine: Gordon Daimler. That's the limo driver.

Horatio Caine: That's him. And the reason that old Gordon probably didn't smell when we picked him up is because he'd just taken his insulin, hadn't he?
Catherine: But the scent was still in the limo's AC system. Well, now we have this guy's address.

Horatio Caine: That's right. 
Catherine: So then maybe that's how he finds his victims -- driving a limo.
Horatio Caine: And when they're away at some posh resort he moves into their house, doesn't he?
Catherine: Hops over to Las Vegas. Visits the couple he met in Miami. Kills the husband...

Warrick: I got a blood trail here. Leading to the garage.









Warrick: He dragged the body to here ... 

Warrick: ... put her in that car.
Calleigh Duquesne: Nine mill. 

Calleigh Duquesne: One shot's a through-and-through. Scalp hair. He fired this one first. 

Calleigh Duquesne: I don't know. To terrorize her.

Warrick: This strike here. That one's all business.







Catherine: He wrapped her in plastic by the bed, raped her.
Horatio Caine: Then dragged her in here and cornered her like an animal.
Catherine: If Gordon's true to form, he's going to kill the Corwins.

Tim Speedle: You guys should take a look at this. 




Tim Speedle: Well, people don't really buy these houses for the view. It's a place to put a million-dollar boat.
Horatio Caine: But what's your point?

Catherine: The boat's missing and that's where he's killing them right now.
Horatio Caine:  Speed, get on that thing right now. Put the birds in the air and call the coast guard. Right now. Do it.

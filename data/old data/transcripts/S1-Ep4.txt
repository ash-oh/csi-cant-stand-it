George: What the hell was that?
Hank: I don't know, probably one of those eight-foot carp.

George: Let's get out of here.

Hank: Something probably caught on the blades. Check the prop.
George: I'm not sticking my hand in that water.

Hank:  Move. Move out of the way. Okay.

Hank: Yeah, I got something.

George: Dude, throw it back.
Hank: What the hell is it?







Catherine: Femur. Strongest bone in the human body -- it's sliced clean through.
Grissom: Like a ginsu through a banana.

Brass: So, what do you think, drowning?
Grissom: Yeah, probably, but under what circumstances? You don't wear flippers at a five-star restaurant. Why would you wear three-inch heels at a lake?  So, Watson? The game is afoot.








Nick: What do you think, bro? Breakfast on me?
Warrick: I got a court date ... straight off of graveyard. It sucks.
Nick: Ouch. Well, time-and-a-half. A cup of java, and you're set.

Sara:  Fine suit. 

Sara:  And well, just fine.
Nick: That's harassment. 
Sara: Hey, we have one locker room and it's my job to be observant.

Warrick: Well, evidence vault opens in five. 
See you guys later.
Nick: Later, bro.
Sara: Easy. So, you and me, 419 Western LVU.
Nick: I know, a dead body at a fraternity. 7:00 A.M.-Looks like we're pulling another double.
Sara: I know, we don't have all day ... are, are you going to wear ... that?
Nick: Yeah.
Sara: It's that hideous ...
Nick: Hideous. Thank you.





Dr. Jenna Williams: Large propeller. Blade cut clean through. No epidermal bruising. The leg was severed post-mortem.
Catherine: Well, that's good news.

Dr. Jenna Williams: How do you figure?
Catherine: Well, do you want to be alive when your leg's being cut off?

Grissom: I believe this goes with that.  Divers recovered the body about a half a mile east of Calville Marina.
Dr. Jenna Williams: Female caucasian, mid-30s. Left thighbone connected to nothing. I believe this is our victim.
Catherine: Well, she's wearing a wedding ring.
Grissom: Will you collect a rape kit?

Dr. Jenna Williams: Always do.

Grissom: How's it look for prints?
Dr. Jenna Williams: Her skin's shriveled like a shar-pei. No pressure, no prints.

Catherine: No. No way, use your own hand.
Grissom: Come on, Catherine, my hand's too big.
Catherine:  No!
Grissom: It's the only way we can print her. Her skin on your hand should fit like a leather glove.

Grissom: May I take your hand?

Grissom: On behalf of the decedent I thank you.

Catherine: Umm ...
Grissom: I think we're going to know who she is by lunchtime.
Catherine:  Ugh!





Nick: I can't believe I used to live in a place like this. It seems like a hundred years 
Sara: And here I had all this respect for you.

Nick: Guys, Nick Stokes. This is Sara Sidle. We're with the crime lab.

Matt Daniels: How you doing? I'm Matt Daniels.
Nick: Hey, Matt.
Matt Daniels: James is upstairs if you guys want to follow me.
Nick: Okay.





Sara: Hey.
Detective Kane: Hey.

Nick: Good god.
Sara:  You see a suicide note?
Detective Kane: We didn't find one.
Sara: Don't release anyone downstairs. We want to talk to them. All of them.

Nick: Coroner pronounce?
Detective Kane: Twenty minutes ago.

Nick: Let's get him down.





Catherine: She's a floater, Wendy Barger. Thirty-four, local, Green Valley.
Grissom: We should contact her family.
Catherine: Already did. Talked to the husband. Never reported her missing.
Grissom: The coroner said she'd been in the water for two days. Where's the husband now?
Catherine: At the coroner's, I.D.-ing the body.





Dr. Jenna Williams: Hey. Results are back on the rape kit. Positive for semen, vaginal penetration.
Catherine: You confirming rape?
Dr. Jenna Williams: Well, there are signs of a struggle. The victim's right shoulder is dislocated. Her skull is fractured.  Give me a little more time with the body.
Grissom: Sure. Thanks, Jenna.




Grissom: Mr. Barger, my name is Gil Grissom.
Winston Barger: Hello.

Grissom: This is Catherine Willows. We're forensics investigators. Sit down.

Catherine: We need to ask you a few questions.
Winstone Barger: All right.
Catherine: Is there anyone that you know of that might have wanted to harm your wife?
Winston Barger: No. Everybody loved Wendy.
Grissom: When was the last time you saw her?
Winston Barger: Tuesday morning. She needed some time away ... to get perspective. She did that sometimes. Uh, we have a, a cabin up by Calville Bay.

Catherine: And when was the last time you had intercourse with your wife?
Winston Barger: Oh, that-that's personal.
Catherine: It's part of our investigation, sir.
Winston Barger: Uh, well, the average is only once a week. Saturdays.

Catherine: Mr. Barger ...
Winston Barger:  Probably three or four months ago.
Grissom: Would you be willing to give us a DNA sample, sir?
Winston Barger: What's going on? I thought Wendy drowned.
Catherine: We're still trying to piece it all together. A sample would be helpful.
Grissom: By law, we need a warrant, unless you were willing to volunteer it.




Nick: Was James depressed?
Kyle Travis: You could say that.
Sara: Could you say that? I mean, the kid's 18 years old, he's got his whole life in front of him and why would he want to hang himself?
Kyle Travis: I don't know. He didn't get in?
Sara: &quot;Get in&quot; ... ?
Kyle Travis: The fraternity. Pledging. I mean, it's not easy.
Sara: Apparently not.
Nick: So, you guys let James know he wasn't getting in, right?
Matt Daniels: Yeah. I told him last night. I'm the one in charge of dinging pledges.
Sara: Big job? How'd he take it?
Kyle Travis:  I think you know.




Warrick: Hey, Judge. What's going on? I'm due in your court.
Judge Cohen: Called for a continuance.
Warrick: Well, nobody told me.
Judge Cohen: Nobody was supposed to tell you.

Judge Cohen: You're going to do something for me.
Warrick: Judge, I thought we were even. How much longer am I under your thumb?
Judge Cohen: You do what I ask, slate's clean. Henderson rape case. State's evidence.
Warrick: Damn. I knew you were in tight.
Judge Cohen: Judges aren't appointed on a whim. I owed the family. I need you to compromise the chain of custody.
Warrick: Just like that? 

Warrick: We got a slam dunk on a three-time rapist and he's just going to walk?
Judge Cohen: I have to have this case kicked.
Warrick: I'm already on probation.
Judge Cohen: Give them an excuse. You're good at that. You worked the graveyard. You pulled a double and you're tired. It could happen to anybody. Don't worry. I've got your back.
Warrick: Yeah, I feel you back there, believe me.





Grissom:  Hey, maestro, what's the deal on our floater?

Grissom: Excuse me. Professor? What's up with our floater?
Greg Sanders: Come hither.


Catherine: DNA doesn't match.
Greg Sanders: Thirteen markers, and not one of them matches the husband's types.
Grissom: That's funny. I liked the husband for this.




Attorney: Well, you were wrong. My client's been through enough distress. Winston, come on.

Winston Barger: When you find out what happened to my wife, I want to know everything.
Grissom: I promise.

Catherine: Let me ask you something. Would you want to know everything?
Grissom: You're asking the wrong guy.

Catherine: Barger as much as told us that he and his wife were having problems. She was staying at the lake. It wasn't the first time. And what do you think the chances are she was seeing somebody else?

Grissom: You were married. You tell me.
Catherine: Very good to excellent.








Warrick: I need to see the Henderson Rape case 4217.
Mike: Sure, in here. 

Mike: Uh, sign here.
Warrick: Thanks, Mike.


Grissom: Hey. 

Grissom: How's court?
Warrick: Uh, damn case was continued. Clerk never called.
Grissom: Look, go home. Take a day. You're been working your ass off.
Warrick:  Nature of the beast.
Grissom: I'm grateful, Warrick. I'm glad you're back. And I owe you a party.
Warrick: Party?
Grissom: Yeah, I made you a CSI three.

Grissom: You'll see it in your next paycheck.
Warrick: More money, more problems.
Grissom: Mm ...
Warrick: Thanks.
Grissom: Yeah.

Warrick: I appreciate it.





Brass: If Wendy Barger was sleeping around, none of her friends knew about it.
Catherine: Anybody seen her since Tuesday?
Brass: Nope. And as far as I can tell, the husband's on the level. He was happier in the marriage than she was.
Catherine: She had something on the side. I can tell you firsthand when you don't cheat, you don't suspect.
Brass: Oh, man. I wish I had been married to you.
Catherine: Not a chance.

Brass:  Oh ... mm ... 

Grissom: Coroner just called. They're waiting for us.
Catherine: Okay. Brass, you coming?
Brass:  I still got half a burger. Besides, I prefer live bodies.





Warrick: Hey, Grissom.  You got a second? Uh, I'm in purgatory. Need some guidance.
Grissom:  Meet you at the car.





Dr. Corbett: Okay, here's your frat boy. We have a petechial hemorrhaging which is synonymous with asphyxia.

Nick: So he asphyxiated by hanging? Are you ruling suicide?
Dr. Corbett: No, not yet. When a victim is found hung we usually find some teeth marks on the tongue.

Sara: No teeth marks.
Nick: But we found him swinging from the ceiling.
Sara: So, the question is, how did he get there?
Dr. Corbett: Speaking of how did he get there ... 

Dr. Corbett: How did this get on his pen1s?
Sara: Huh. Is that a tattoo?
Dr. Corbett: No, no, it looks like ink.

Sara: Nick? You want to take a look at this?
Nick: Oh, no, I ... don't have to look. I have a pretty good idea what this is all about, so ...
Sara:  Okay.
Nick: Knock yourself out.




NICK Does your fraternity practice hazing?
Kyle Travis: No.
Matt Daniels: Yeah, I mean, it took a long time for Phi Alpha to get its charter. We have a strict no-tolerance policy and as president, I enforce that to the letter.
Nick:  Come on, man, I was a Greek and we had all kinds of policies, too. Guys still hazed.
Sara: We found ink on James's pen1s. Are you trying to tell us he was just practicing his penmanship?
Matt Daniels:  State passed a law: No Hazing. It's six months in jail plus expulsion. We do not haze.
Kyle Travis: But there is an initiation.


Kyle Travis: Pledges, turn and face your active chapter.
 
Kyle Travis: For the past ten weeks you guys have accumulated points. Some of you are way ahead. Some of you are way ... behind. 

Kyle Travis:  It's time ... to get signed!

Matt Daniels:  I could tell right off the bat James was nervous, you know? 

Matt Daniels: He was kind of the shy guy. I mean, he ... he wanted to pledge. He wanted to belong.
Kyle Travis:  Yeah, he wanted to belong, but you know what, I questioned his chops. I think we all did.

Matt Daniels: So, yeah, we gave the pledges an assignment: They were to go to sorority row and, uh, get ... different parts of their bodies signed.
Kyle Travis: I mean, the menu was pretty straightforward. Arms and legs: Five points. Ten points for your chest, 25 points for your butt cheeks and 100 points for your Johnson.
Sara: Your Johnson?
Nick: Yeah, you know, your, uh ...
Sara:  Don't stop now.

Kyle Travis: And Johnson ... ...your sorry ass is so far behind in points that you better get your ... &quot;Johnson&quot; ...  ... signed a couple hundred times or you're... history.


Matt Daniels: Kyle caught him cheating in the bathroom.

Kyle Travis: He was signing himself.
Frat Boy: Oh, man! FRAT BOY: No!

Frat Boy: What a fake!


Sara: You humiliate him in front of all the other actives. Poor kid was so scared, he had to sign himself. You give him a beer shower? And you don't call that hazing?

Nick:  Answer the question, guys.
Kyle Travis: I had no choice. I had to ding him.
Matt Daniels: I mean, come on, you're only as strong as your weakest link.
Kyle Travis: We didn't pledge him. He pledged us. He knew what to expect if he didn't measure up.
Nick: Humiliation, initiation ...  ... appreciation.
Kyle Travis: That's what it's all about.
Nick: Right, right?
Matt Daneils: We're sorry, but we didn't kill him.

Sara: I don't buy it.




Warrick:  Judge ... Warrick. Listen, uh, I got a little problem. No, I can't talk about it over the phone. We got to meet in person. There's something in the evidence I think you should see. Good.





Dr. Jenna Williams: I'll start at the top. Head contusion, right temple. Imbedded with wood splinters, lime green paint.

Catherine: What does that give us?
Dr. Jenna Williams: Nothing yet, but when you find the murder weapon it might give you something to compare it against. Moving down, three words. Write them down. Minimal pulmonary aspiration.
Grissom:  There was no water in her lungs?
Dr. Jenna Williams: All I'm saying is, if she died by drowning her lungs would be flooded.

Dr. Jenna Williams:  But her lungs weren't flooded.

Grissom: So we think she was raped killed, then dumped in the lake.
Dr. Jenna Williams: After a very nice dinner. Which brings me to her stomach. 
 
Dr. Jenna Williams: Fried calamari and based on the extent of the digestion she died about three hours after she ate.





Catherine: Now tell me, why are we here?
Grissom: 'Cause it's the only place within ten miles of Calville Bay that serves calamari.
Catherine: And you know this because...?
Grissom: I come here for calamari.
Catherine: Oh. Alone?
Grissom: No. Sometimes I have a beer with it.




Catherine: Do you recognize this woman?
Waitress: She might have eaten here Tuesday night right around this time. 
Catherine: Ordered the calamari.
Waitress: Miss, everyone orders calamari.
Catherine: Well, I don't care about everyone. I care about her.
Waitress: Uh ... yeah. Yeah, I remember her. Um, she came in with a guy. Regulars. Good tipper.
Grissom: Would you happen to know this &quot;good tipper&quot;'s name?




Catherine: Mr. Swelco, are you all right?
Phil Swelco:  I can't believe she's dead.
Grissom: Could you tell us about your affair with Wendy?
Phil Swelco: Nobody knew we had one.
Grissom: What about your wife?
Phil Swelco: We were separated. We filed for divorce last week. I thought Wendy was going to do the same thing.
Catherine: And... when she didn't, you got angry?

Phil Swelco: No. No. That's not what I meant. I loved Wendy. She said the marriage was over. It's just that ... just ... she was scared.
Catherine: Scared? Why?
Phil Swelco: She didn't want to hurt Winston. She thought if she left, he'd ... break.
Grissom: Tuesday night you and Wendy had dinner at the grille? Where'd you go after that?
Phil Swelco: We went back to the marina in her car and then we took the outboard back here.
Grissom: Why'd you take the boat?
Phil Swelco: Wendy didn't want anybody to s-see her car in my driveway so we always met at the marina and then we'd take the outboard over here.
Catherine: What happened once you got here?
Phil Swelco: We made love. Then she left. Took the boat back.

Grissom: Where is ... the boat?
Phil Swelco: At the marina.




Catherine: Do you believe him?
Grissom: I believe he had an affair.

Catherine: Is that the husband?

Grissom: Mr. Barger, what are you doing here?
Winston Barger: You didn't call, so I was following you. Uh, this is ... Phil Swelco's house, isn't it?
Grissom: Do you know Mr. Swelco?
Winston Barger: Informally. Does he have something to do with Wendy's death?
Catherine: We're interviewing a lot of people. Most of it's follow-up.

Grissom: Mr. Barger, this is a time when you ought to let us do our job. You've been through a terrible ordeal. You've asked us to keep you posted and I promise we will keep you posted.
Winston Barger: I just wanted to see if you guys have anything new.
Catherine: As soon as we know, you'll know. 
Winston Barger: All right.

Grissom: Drive safely.


Catherine: You know, eventually we're going to have to tell him that his wife was having an affair with somebody he knows.
Grissom: No, we don't, Catherine. We have to tell him how he died. Just the facts, without all the other stuff.
Catherine: When Eddie was cheating on me I sure wish somebody would have said something.
Grissom: You mean me.


Catherine: Who else?



;






Catherine: New pet?
Grissom: The African Red Baboon Tarantula -- the most feared of all arachnids. But basically harmless.
Catherine: Yeah, well just keep the lid on it, okay?
Grissom: I think you scared him. All his hairs are standing up.
Catherine: If you're through amusing yourself I have some news on the boat.
Grissom: Was it at the Marina?
Catherine: What do you think?
Grissom: My spider sense says it wasn't.
Catherine: Right. We need to find the boat.




Sara: The coroner's prelim on the frat hanging.
Nick: Bust it out.

Sara: What's that smell?
Nick: I'm nuking a burrito.
Sara: Mmm, junk food and radiation-- good combo. 

Sara: A strip of raw calf's liver was found lodged inside the cleft of victim's throat. Cause of death: Choking.
Nick:  Mm-hmm. That's interesting.
Sara: Microscopic threads of fabric were found embedded in the liver.




Kyle Travis: Microscopic fabric? I have no idea what you're talking about. You just lost me.
Nick: Kyle, I'm getting that &quot;hazing&quot; feeling.
Sara: Did you stuff him? Suffocate him? Shove towels down his throat?
Kyle Travis: No. Look, lady, I have no idea where you're going with all this but you're way off.

Nick: Tell me about the liver.
Kyle Travis: What about the liver?
Nick: Kyle ... Kyle ... eleven years ago I was you, man. Smoking cigars in closets, playing tanks. I wore a trout in my jean pocket for seven days till my leg went half numb. I've been there. So, don't ... don't tell me &quot;what about it?&quot;
Kyle Travis:  Okay. James begged us for one more shot so, we came up with a challenge. 

Kyle Travis:  Swallowing raw liver.


Kyle Travis: Oh, man. Oh, man, he's choking.

Matt Daniels: Give him the heimlich. Give him the heimlich. Give him the heimlich!

Matt Daniels: He's turning blue!

Sara: How does a kid choke to death and end up hanging from a rafter?

Kyle Travis:  Okay. We freaked. I mean, we had a lot to lose here. We could lose our charter or get kicked out of school or even go to jail. So, me and Matt, we strung him up, and ... made it look like he'd committed suicide.

Sara: You do realize you just admitted to killing him?
Kyle Travis: We didn't kill him. It was an accident.
Sara: It was an accident. But now it's beginning to look like Christmas.
Kyle Travis: Look,  ... my dad's a top defense attorney so, if charges are filed ...

Nick: Don't worry. They will be.
Kyle Travis: It'll be manslaughter, not murder. And me and Matt wind up with community service.




Nick: We can hold him for manslaughter.
Sara: Manslaughter -- are you kidding? Are you willing to settle for that? Come on, Nick, you know as well as I do there is more to this.
Nick: You're going 80 miles an hour in second gear. Let's just slow down, all right?
Sara: Okay.
Nick: They said they performed the heimlich, right?
Sara: Yeah. I don't believe them.
Nick: Well, if they performed the heimlich, there'd be evidence of trauma. 
Sara: Yes, there would.




DISSOLVE INTO


CLOSE UP: CHEST X-RAY ON A VIEWBOX

Dr. Corbett: Well, now, you're right. If they gave this frat kid the heimlich chances are we'd find a broken rib.
Nick: Not even a fracture.
Sara: What about abdominal or thoracic bruising?
Dr. Corbett: Nope. Photos are all negative.
Sara: They lied. When this kid was choking, no one tried to help him.
Dr. Corbett: Take a look at this. 

Dr. Corbett: Now, we magnified Mr. Johnson's privates. 

Dr. Corbett: The ink is from a felt tip. It's a paper max thin tip to be exact.

Sara:  &quot;JILL W.&quot; Two triangles.
Nick:  No, it's two deltas. Greek letters. She's a delt.

Sara: Freaks.



(NICK and SARA interview JILL WENTWORTH. NICK takes out a photograph of the
&quot;signature&quot; and shows it to JILL WENTWORTH)
Nick: Jill, we need to ask you a question. Is this your signature?

Jill Wentworth:  Oh, my god. Oh, where did you get that?
Sara: Where do you think?
Jill Wentworth: You don't think that has something to do with what happened?
Nick: We don't know yet. That's what we're trying to find out. How well did you know James?
Jill Wentworth: Uh, he was pledging my boyfriend's house. We're Greek, I mean ... we sign them. They sign us. ...
Sara:  Of course you do.
Nick: Who's your boyfriend?
Jill Wentworth: Kyle Travis.







Sara: So, looking for fibers.
Nick: Yeah, fibers liver-anything to implicate these guys.


Sara: What the heck is that?
Nick: The murder weapon. Dingle-dangle.




Warrick: Let me guess. Radiohead or Rage against the machine.
Greg Sanders: Actually, it's an audio book on restriction enzyme analysis and DNA typing. PCR fingerprinting. Choice.
Warrick: Right.

Greg Sanders: What's Grissom doing in the garage?
Warrick: Oh, he's working that Wendy Barger case -- you know, the floater?
Greg Sanders: Oh.
Warrick: Only clue he's got is a missing boat which sucks, 'cause ... it's missing.
Greg Sanders:  He thinks he's going to find it in a bathtub?
Warrick: It's a simulation tank. He's re-creating the conditions the night she died. Body was dumped, like, a half mile from Calville Bay. They think the boat must have drifted with the currents.
Greg Sanders: And let me guess -- Catherine got bored.
Warrick: Well, you know Grissom. Shortest distance between two points is science. And for Catherine, it's pounding the pavement.
Greg Sanders: Hey, I thought Grissom gave you the night off.
Warrick:  Yeah. Something came up. See you.


SCENES #33:




















 




NIGHT VISION GREEN: 





Grissom: Yeah? Grissom.

Catherine: It's me. I found it. Just South of Barring Point Bridge.
Grissom: How?
Catherine: I took a walk.

Grissom: Just South of Barring Point Bridge? What color is the boat?
Catherine: It's white with lime green trim. Just like the splinters we found in Wendy Barger's head wound.
Grissom: Well done, Catherine. Well done.

Grissom:  let's get the boat back to the garage.









Judge Cohen: This better be good.
Warrick: I need some assurances.
Judge Cohen: It's a two-way street, pal. Did you do what I asked?
Warrick: I checked out the evidence, yeah. But I'm not sure about the rest.
Judge Cohen: What's the big deal? You break the seal on the evidence box it's over. We put it to bed, I tell Henderson &quot;mission accomplished.&quot;

Warrick: Why don't you let me do that?

Judge Cohen: What's going on here?

Brass: Judge Cohen, you're under arrest for obstruction of justice tampering with state's evidence and violating seven articles of scumbag.

Warrick: I told you ... nobody owns me.

Officer: Move on.
Brass: Nice work, man.





Greg Sanders: Hey, Grissom. I hear Catherine beat you to the boat.
Grissom: We work as a team. We're not competing.

Greg Sanders: Okay. But, ah, she found it first. Right?
Grissom: &quot;Two roads diverged in a yellow wood and, sorry I could not travel both.&quot;
Greg Sanders: Robert Frost.
Grissom: Very good, Greg.
Greg Sanders: Thanks.

Grissom: But actually, in this case, Mr. Frost does not apply. When you have a partner you each take a road. That's how you find a missing boat.
Greg Sanders: Come on. Level with me. Who do you think killed her -- the husband or boyfriend?

Grissom: And you've narrowed it down to just two suspects?
Greg Sanders: Actually, you did. You see, my second week at CSI, you told me that when a cheating spouse is murdered there's always two suspects at the top of the list: The lover and the betrayed.
Grissom: I told you this?
Greg Sanders: Mm-hmm. You see, I'm thinking that the husband caught Wendy with the boyfriend and when she left his house, he killed her in a jealous rage.
Grissom: And this theory is based on...?

Greg Sanders: Nothing. I'm just trying to help.
Grissom: I'm going to the garage to meet Catherine.  You keep thinking, Butch. That's what you're good at.

Greg Sanders: Hey. If this theory checks out, uh maybe we should talk about a raise.
Grissom: Yeah.






(CATHERINE sees something.
Catherine: I think I may have found some skin. When Wendy hit her head. Did you hear what I said?

Grissom: Blood.
Catherine: Blood? Well, you were at the autopsy. The head trauma wasn't a bleeder.
Grissom: Well, maybe she fought back. Either way, we got to call Brass. Tell them to bring the boyfriend in.





Brass: Could you wait right here, please?  Stay with Mr. Swelco.

Grissom: How's it going?
Brass: Aah, you know, the usual beep-bap-bop, you know? The guy said he cut his hand cleaning fish. Got a tetanus shot. That's his excuse for the blood we found on the boat. But I'll call the Lake Clinic to confirm.
Catherine:  Damn, you're good.

Brass: Oh, shut up. Stevie, hang with him.
Winston Barger:  Phil? Phil Swelco?


Phil Swelco: Winston.  I heard about your wife. I'm sorry.
Winston Barger: What are you doing here? Why are you questioning him?
Catherine: Mr. Barger, why don't you, um come over here with me. Just walk over ...

Grissom: Mr. Swelco. Why don't we go in here sit down.

Catherine: Have a seat.

Winston Barger: I always knew she was seeing someone. I just didn't know who.
Catherine:  Oh, I'm sorry.
Winston Barger: She was having an affair with Phil Swelco? And you think he killed her.




Grissom: You just compromised our investigation.
Catherine: He deserved to know the truth.
Grissom: Knowing how she died, yes. Knowing that she had an affair -- how does that bring closure?
Catherine: I guess you just have to be on the wrong end of an affair to understand.
Grissom: You can't make this about Eddie. Look, you hurt our case because your ex hurt you.
Catherine: We bring ourselves to our cases. We can't help it. I knew how Barger felt. Would you just relax? I didn't give him chapter and verse.
Grissom: You can't give him anything, Catherine. We're scientists. We're not psychiatrists or victims' rights advocates.
Catherine: You right, you know. I should be just like you. Alone in my hermetically sealed condo watching discovery on the big screen working genius-level crossword puzzles, but no relationships. No chance any will slop over into a case. Right. I want to be just like you.
Grissom: Technically, it's a townhouse. And the crosswords are advanced, not genius. But you're right. I'm deficient in a lot of ways. But I never screw up one of my cases with personal stuff.
Catherine: Grissom ... what personal stuff?



 
Nick: Matt, I got to know. How much did it tick Kyle off?
Matt Daniels: What are you talking about?
Nick: Jill.  Man, Kyle must've been steamed. His girlfriend signs a pledge's privates?
Matt Daniels: Yeah, Kyle, can take a joke.
Sara: He didn't think it was funny enough to share it with us. You know, I never met a guy who could just laugh that off.
Nick: Hey, Matt you know why I joined a fraternity? 'Cause I wanted to belong to something -- the brotherhood. That's what it was all about for me you know what I mean? So, I'm going to cut to the chase here, bud. You come clean, you might be able to save your house ... save the brotherhood, but ... if you don't ... 
Sara: You and Kyle both get charged with murder. And the House goes dark.
Nick: Everything you're trying to protect you'll destroy. Matty, I found the string. Now are you ready to tell us what happened after James got back to that house?
Matt Daniels: Okay.

Matt Daniels: Hey, let's see what Johnson came up with.
Frat Boy: Yeah? FRAT BOY: Yeah, let's see it, dude. FRAT BOY: Show it!

Matt Daniels: Dude ... that's your girlfriend. She signed it.

Kyle Travis: Good.

Kyle Travis: Meet me upstairs, pledge. 

Kyle Travis: You're still behind in points. So this is what we're going to do. I'm going to put this down your throat you're going to swallow it and you're going to trust me to pull it back out. Okay.


Matt Daniels: Dude, where's Johnson?


Matt Daniels: Oh, oh, this is crazy.
Kyle Travis: All right, all right, all right, listen to me. Anything goes down my father will bail out the chapter. 

Kyle Travis: Now you're just going to follow my lead and you're going to keep your mouth shut.






Kyle Travis: Is my dad here yet?
Sara: No, but when he gets here, you can tell him. New charge: First degree murder.

Kyle Travis: No way, come on. That's ridiculous.
Nick: Your boy rolled over on you, slick.
Sara: One thing about the fraternity upstate, the brotherhood's fantastic.
Nick: Oh, yeah. They gonna love you.




Grissom: She ran out of gas.
Catherine: Okay.
Grissom: Get in the boat. Pull the engine cord.
Catherine: What?
Grissom: Get in the boat.
Catherine: Why?
Grissom: Just indulge me, please?
Catherine: There's no gas. It's not gonna start.
Grissom: That's not the point.
Catherine:  As long as there is one.

Grissom: Pull it again.

Grissom: Go on.

Grissom: More.

Grissom: Harder. 

Grissom: Go on.

Catherine: That's it. What's your point?
Grissom: How does your shoulder feel?
Catherine: It's sore.  But you already knew that. 
Grissom: I know what happened to Wendy.

Grissom:  She says good night to Swelco ...

Grissom:  ... and gets in the boat. Halfway home, the boat runs out of gas.

Grissom:  ... Stranded in the middle of the lake, she panics. Starts pulling on the engine cord.

Grissom:  ... She pulls so hard, she dislocates her shoulder and falls forward. 

Grissom:  ... Wendy goes under, where she remains until a barge's propeller severs her leg.

Grissom: She died before she ever hit the water.
Catherine: It was just an accident.
Grissom: Well, sometimes it's about what didn't happen.
Catherine: Well ...  ... I guess we better go talk to the husband. I mean, unless you think I'm going to compromise the integrity of the case again.

Grissom: Look ... could we have a truce?
Catherine: I would love to.
Grissom: Good. 

Grissom: But let me do all the talking to the husband and the boyfriend.
Catherine:  He had to say it.




Warrick: Hey. 

Grissom: I'll meet you outside, okay?
Catherine: Okay. Hey, Warrick.
Warrick: Hey, Cath.

Grissom: Did it go okay?
Warrick: Yeah. Fine. Thanks for letting Brass handle it.
Grissom: The fewer people who know about this the better. 
 
Grissom: I'm proud of you. You know, Judge Cohen's got a lot of soldiers.
Warrick: Yeah. That's what I'm afraid of.
Grissom: You know, I can only help you out so much. After that, it's up to you.
Warrick: Yeah, I know.



Cue Sound: KNOCKING



Grissom: Hello?! Mr. Swelco?! Mr. Swelco?! Mr. Swelco?



Winston Barger: He killed my wife.
Catherine: We just came from your house. We wanted to tell you that your wife's death was an accident.
Winston Barger: What?


Grissom: He didn't kill her.

Did you find a weapon?
Just paper wasps. They're having too much fun to worry about us.
Just doing what god intended ... ... recycling us back to the earth.
Hey, Officer 
Can I borrow some of your hot coffee, please?
Preservation.
John ... Paul ... George ... Ringo.
You got any of that beef jerky you're always gnawing on?
I want to keep these little fellas alive. They're our first witnesses to the crime.
Hi. Sorry I'm late.
How do you know about that already?
A Paul Sorenson ...
Warrick, you can work this with Catherine.  Don't you have a court date coming up?
Listen, juries need to have confidence in the evidentiary, process, so work with Catherine then break off when you have to appear.
Good luck.
No. Sara's going to work with me.
You get a missing person.  Sheryl Applegate. Her husband notified the police that she took the car and headed to L.A., but she never showed up. A few hours ago, P.D. found her car at the bus station. They requested a CSI.
Hopefully, you're right. But, until she's located treat her car like a crime scene.
Do we know who she is yet?
'Full of sound and fury signifying' ... what, Doc?
'The worms go in the worms go out / the worms play pinochle on your snout.'
An old nursery rhyme.
A muscid fly -- typical only in urban areas.
I think there's at least fifteen, but go on. What don't you get?
Like summer follows the spring.
I watch the insects mature from eggs to larvae to adults and then count backwards.
They're not done maturing yet.
But when they are, I'll be able to tell you how old they were when I found the body.
Let me guess. Downtown? The Fremont District?
Synthesiomyia nudiseta is the Latin name.
Mr. Shelton ... did your wife drive race cars?
No. The two most common causes of facial trauma in adult women: Motor vehicle accidents and domestic violence. 
These are your wife's x rays.
So do you.
Does it get cold in here in the winter?
That's why you'd need a blanket on the couch, huh? A green one, I bet.
We're going to need to borrow your bullets.
Did you do laundry back here today?
Sara!
Sara!
Get him out of here, Jim.
Hey. Hey. What is the matter with you?
The post-mortem insects will tell me when she was killed.
Jim, please don't try and compromise my end of the investigation.
She's been dead three days.
Three.
You understand it.
There's no secrets around you, are there, Conrad?
Well, then, you must feel very small today ... by association.
Did I miss one of your status meetings?
So? I'm sure something came up.
What?
Sara? 
Sara? You okay?
Did you sleep here?
I need you to do some background for me on Warrick without letting him know why.
That's why I want you to handle it, so that Ecklie can't accuse me of favoritism if it turns out that Warrick's clean.
Did you find out anything about Warrick?
Mm-hmm.
You don't crunch evidence to fit a theory.
You have empathy for her, Sara. You want someone to pay for what was done to her. That's normal.
Did you just say what I think you said?
It's an experiment. Maybe Kaye was dead five days.
They don't. People do. The victim was wrapped in a blanket. Normally a blanket or clothing doesn't impact insect maturation. The insects usually fight their way in anyway. But I examined the folds in Kaye's blanket. She was wrapped tight -- maybe tighter than I realized -- which would have decreased the corpse's exposure to insects.
And deposit their eggs. Maybe two whole days. I've wrapped porky here pretty tight.
This poor ham was already on its way to someone's Christmas dinner table.
Got to be a pig. Interestingly, they're the most like humans.
Once I took the blanket into account.
Five days, not three.
I can make a case to any jury against Scott Shelton for the murder of his wife.
Thank you, David.
You know, there was a murder recently in a village on the other side of the world. Every man in the village denied having any part of it. The victim's throat had been slashed with a shovel. So this one guy -- I guess you could call him a 'science nerd' -- asked all the men in the village to bring their shovels to the center of town and hold them spade-side up. And he waited. Eventually, flies started showing up on one specific shovel looking for microscopic bits of blood and flesh.
The investigator got his murderer, and...
To an astronomer, it is.  But then people forgot about forensic science, didn't they? And they had to be reminded again by Francesco Redi in the 1600s.
Every civilization learns what it needs to know and the next one forgets it. The sheriff ... well... it's not personal.
Yeah, they laughed at fingerprints 70 years ago, and now it's law.
You're confused, right?
That's the best place for a scientist to be. 
My body's here.
Shall we?
Doc, what's this blue mark here?
Didn't you say the suspect's ammunition was in trace?
And? So?
You did very good.  But this is just more circumstantial evidence. We're a long way from a conviction.
Hi.
Thanks.
I need you to do some background for me on Warrick.
That's why I want you to handle it so that Ecklie can't accuse me of favoritism.
They had another gig. How you doing, Jim? How's your old job?
I curse more.
And her purse is still in the cart. With no wallet. 
Chicken soup, ice packs ... pain reliever ...
Hot dogs, hot dog buns ...
Mustard.
Did you have any mop-ups in this aisle today?
Life holds no surprises. 
$1.98 for the mustard ... plus, my two cents.
Now, where would you go?
Hey, Brass, look at this.
You see this?
This circumference? Looks like somebody did a brillo job on it.
You know anything about this?
Could I borrow a hammer?
'Iv'e killed 5 women. Catch me if you can?'
Hey.
Hey, kids. All right, listen, hey, I got to jet.
Sara Sidle. 419.
Nick Stokes-- 416, fight at the Bellagio. She says she's a 'friend' of yours.
Catherine, you have a 418 -- an obituary on a stall door. I'll meet you in the garage but first, I've got to take care of Warrick.
I don't know.
I read it.
Hey.
How was court the other day?
Yeah, because you had, uh, 'personal business.'
You ... at the Monaco casino.
Casinos tape everyone who walks through their door, Warrick, you know that. I thought we had a deal.
Look, what you do on your time is nobody's business. What you do on my time is my business.
And we know that because...?
Or marker to metal. Do we know anything else?
And good morning to you, too, Miss Sidle.
I read your report.
I see the whole puzzle, Sara. You're only seeing one piece.
No. I trust him. Do you trust me?
Father, son, holy ghost?
That one, huh?
You found the other four victims?
'Iv'e killed 1 woman.' Victorville. Salt Lake City -- 'Iv'e killed 2 women. Catch me if you can?' San Bernardino -- 'Iv'e killed 3 women ... ' 'Iv'e killed 4 women. Catch me!' Mesquite. '...5 women... ' Las Vegas.
What else do you know about the crime scenes?
Which means they were probably alive when these messages were written making these messages of intention, not fact. 
What if we shuffle these doors like Pai Gow tiles?
San Bernardino, California. Victorville, California. Las Vegas, Nevada. Mesquite, Nevada. Salt Lake City, Utah.
So has our suspect.
Where we going?
What's in Moapa?
Really?
Yeah, well, I'll get into it.
And blue. This is bizarre. The body's cold.
And she's stiff -- like a two-minute burrito that's only been nuked for a minute.
Looks like the planet krypton.
That's how she was transported from San Bernardino to Vegas -- in a refrigerated truck. That's our crime scene.
And it's mobile.
Hey, Nick, I been looking for you. 
This girl you've been helping with the 416 .. .?
Is she a friend of yours?
Are you doing anything that could compromise the unit?
I have to ask. It's part of the job.
No, Brass. Do you want to talk about this?
Me, I guess. Did you find out anything?
That's my 'Big Mouth Billy Bass.' It's better than a watchdog. I got valuable stuff in here, you know.
It does.
That sounds pretty straightforward. Why don't you put a rookie on it?
'If Muhammad won't go to the mountain then the mountain must go to Muhammad.' Think about it.
A writing sample will be sufficient, thank you.
You know, I'm starting to think that maybe we should be looking for a man. Only three percent of multiple killers are female. And a woman wouldn't need a trophy. And a body on ice is definitely a trophy.
What if it was a man with a woman who would do anything he asked?
Do you ever worry that technology is going to make us obsolete?
Can you, uh, narrow your database? Say, eliminate all trucks that are not refrigerated?
Can you eliminate all trucks that were not in Las Vegas yesterday? 
This is very cool. Eliminate all trucks that did not deliver to Marty's Market yesterday.
Where is he now?
It's not your truck anymore. It's our crime scene.
Where is she? Where is Margaret Shorey?
Look, pal, I already know what happened. I even know your type -- decent, trusting, middle-aged women.
There's a lock. Are there any keys?
Hello, Margaret. My name is Gil. This is Catherine.
What are you worried about?
It only takes one.
Yeah.
Oh. Great. Sorry.
Uh, I was supposed to pass out some supervisor evaluation forms. Where are they?
No, it's not.
All right. Assignment: Parking lot of the sportsbook at the Monaco. Caucasian male found dead in the front seat of his car.
No. Uh, Nick and Catherine.
You and Warrick are working with me.
Yeah. If we take the case we have very little time to work it. The trial starts in three days.
No trouble. We're both colleagues searching for the truth. Okay, that's it. Look ... onward. You have to start by looking at this.
Meeting?
I don't remember asking you to.
Well, how does killing his family solve his money problems?
Too many maybes. I think we should go with the evidence.
Yeah, a hydrocarbon. I read Ecklie's report. 
Do I seem like the kind of guy who skips stuff?
Well, then, it'll be a short interview, won't it?
Evening.
Thanks.
Even better. Footprints.
Why did you contact me, Mr. Damon?
Fires are very complicated. 
I don't mean to stare ... but, yes, I can learn some things. For instance, the back of your hands are smooth. You read a lot. You have indentation marks on your nose from reading glasses. Your speech tells me that you're well-educated. Your occupation's not listed in the file, but I think that you had a white-collar job.
I don't know yet whether you're left- or right-handed, though. 
Now, you want to tell me what happened?
Why don't you tell me about the fire.
Why?
Flashover?
Well, if you're a volunteer fireman then you must be familiar with the use of accelerants.
According to the report there were traces of gasoline found on the floor of your bedroom closet.
Our homicide department has a credit card receipt for gasoline -- your receipt -- and there's no other suspects.
I don't chase criminals, Mr. Damon. I just evaluate evidence.
How did you burn your hand, Mr. Damon?
People with third-degree burns don't forget how they got them.
I'll take your case. I don't know whether I'll help you or not.
Nothing harder to investigate than arson. If the fire hasn't ruined your crime scene...
Yeah.
Overhaul. Post-blaze, firemen remove charred items to neutralize the hot spots. Prevents flare-ups.
Bag those.
Yeah.
The fire was contained inside this room ... but the outside door frame is severely charred.
We're going to take a piece of this back to the lab.
Huh.
More than you think. 'V' pattern on the outside wall. Fires like to go up and out.
This one's narrow. This was a very intense, rapidly moving fire.
The apex of the 'V' usually indicates the point of origin. You want to call it, Warrick?
Shards of glass.
Can't. It's melted into the concrete.
It's called 'spalling.' It confirms the presence of an accelerant.
Good question.
Really? Where's the trailing? An arsonist would spread the gasoline around to maximize the burn area.
Listen, you guys. You're like Dodger fans. The ball game's only in the seventh inning and you're already out of your seats.
I'll see you guys in the evidence lab.
Yeah? Why was there no trailing? And why no evidence of an incendiary device anywhere in the bedroom?
What are you so afraid of, Conrad? We're just a couple of science geeks. Why can't we work together?
Yes, we are -- if it's our mistake that put them there.
Hey, Eck?  What is the new policy on vacation days?
Uh... you might want to take three giant steps backward.
Three drops of gasoline, limited oxygen supply heat to ignition temperature of 932 degrees Fahrenheit.
Smoke to fire.
Tell me you're here to confirm part two.
It's called alligatoring. See the way the wood's cracked? It looks like the skin of an alligator.
Use of accelerant?
So, the only way this could've happened was ... O2.
Damon opened the door.  He lied.
We chase the lie ... 'til it leads to the truth.
Anything else you want to tell me?
About the fire.
Your bedroom doorframe disagrees. If no one opened the door ... the outside frame would not have burned. As a firefighter you know that.
May I see your hand, please? Palm up. 
This is the same type of doorknob that you have on your bedroom door.
Mr. Damon ...
Why? This places you outside of the fire. You're facing the death penalty. Why are you lying?
What else?
Carbon monoxide killed them long before the fire got to them. You know that.
You tried to save your family, but that doesn't mean that you didn't start the fire. Are you lying about that, too?
I will.
Sorry. What are you doing here?
No.
This is heavy-duty, high voltage. This thing could heat our whole lab.
You know what to do next?
Something you probably should have done.
Yeah, that was your report. This is an electrical socket from the closet where a space heater was plugged in.
I found it in the living room, melted.
It was a cold night. The outlet in the closet was closest to her bed. 
Look ... if this wire burned from the inside out then the fire started in the wall not on the closet floor.
Discoloration throughout the conductor. It burned from the inside out. The cause of this fire was an electrical overload in the wall.
Speaking of which ... where's your accelerant analysis work?
Too many unanswered questions, Conrad. This case should not be going to trial yet.
You've got to do better than that.
It doesn't prove you didn't start it. Until we can explain why there was gasoline in the bedroom closet the charges stand.
Yeah.
From the kid's room. I counted them yesterday. And I counted them this morning. Twenty. They're all there. I really don't know what I'm doing anymore.
Sure.
That's what happens.
I can't fault him for that. The burn pattern is consistent with a gasoline accelerant.
Thank you.  Warrick, you're driving.
Not while I'm committing it, no.
Let's go.
You son of a bitch. You swept my crime scene. You sent cleanup!
So you knew, and did nothing about it even with a man's life on the line?
Thanks, Ecklie.
Hi.
Excuse me. My name's Gil Grissom. 
May I ask you a question?
You're his family. What was his relationship like with his wife and son?
I broke a coffee pot today. Lost my temper. Anything like that ever happen to you?
We found shards of melted glass on the floor of your closet. You want to tell me about it?
Okay, you can explain it in court. It's all part of the report now.
Wait a minute. Go back. What did she throw at you? Be specific.
Think.
What kind of a vase?
Was it even a vase?
Was it glass? Could it have been glass?
Like a kerosene lamp?
I found kerosene on the floor of your closet.
The space heater overloaded the circuit causing a spark to ignite the kerosene.
The evidence can.
Thought you might need a ride.
Your sister. Who is she?
I don't judge people. 
And ... ? 
... responsible?
That's what they do. Put wet stuff on the red stuff.
The Van Gogh effect. In stereo. Both ears gone.
So either it drew his attention or it was contained in something that seemed benign.
Smell the sulfur?
Got your lighter, Jim?
Light this.
Well, we know the propellant. So would you care to make a preliminary call on this?
The dirty little secret of bombs is how easy they are to make and use. 
Our murder weapon's here someplace in a thousand pieces. 
We have to find it and put it back together again.
If it's not growing pick it up. We cart everything we find back to the lab.
Stay curious.
Well, thank you. And your name is ... ?
Did somebody from homicide talk to you yet?
Right. Did you know the victim -- the other security guard?
Would you, uh, like to be on the news?
Well, I mean, realistically, what could you have done?
Huh. Dominic ... with an 'I-C,' not 'I-C-K' ...
Would you be interested in helping me in my investigation?
That's good thinking. Would you excuse me a minute?
Keep an eye on that guy.
Well, we got a live one out there. I got a cop baby-sitting him. How you doing?
No. Dominic Kretzker. Why?
Or he wants to get caught.
I found something interesting.
Bomb was time-delayed. This is a piece of the timing device.
Heat of the explosion must have melted whatever it is all around the wheel. So, Sara?
What's orange and melts?
Thank you.
I thought this was your day off.
Okay.
You told me you weren't dating her.
And Ecklie's at her house now.
What were you thinking, Nicky?
Ecklie's going to be all over this.
When you're a suspect and you're innocent, keep your mouth shut. I'll talk to Ecklie.
Okay, go for a walk. Maybe you'll accidentally bump into your guy, 'Jack?'
I.D. him, but don't approach him.
No. It's an automatic dismissal.
Could you find that and turn it off, please?
Not yet.
You spoiled all my fun.
Anything's possible.
You isolate the tool, and then we trace it.
It's the same as guns -- we eliminate them one at a time.
Alas, poor Warrick.
We find the bomber by understanding the bomb. Fortunately, Catherine figured out the exterior container.
And we know the timing device.
And the propellant.
So the final piece of the bomber's signature?
Three bombs, scaled down five-to-one three different metal pipes. Different metals fly different distances when the same force is applied. Number one is a plumber's ex-flow pipe. Number two is an inflow pipe which is thinner. Number three is galvanized steel which is the thinnest metal of them all.
Mm-hmm.
Green. That's the ex-flow pipe.
Inflow pipe, blue.
Red-- the galvanized steel.
Last piece of green: Ten feet.
Blue: 16 feet.
Red: 20 feet.
20 feet. Extrapolating five to one that would be 100 feet.
So the bomb was housed in a thin container of galvanized steel -- like a muffler or a tailpipe. I've seen it before. It's a common container for homemades.
Dominic ... this is the type of device that was used to set off the Hansen bomb. We have proof that you purchased the same make of clock.
The timing device is still intact.
But you have made bombs before using parts from this make?
Is this from the Hansen bomb?
I can't tell whether he's brilliant or... nuts.
How you doing? 
That's resourceful.
I think the evidence raises some serious questions about your involvement.
Dominic, you have an attorney now. I can't really talk to you about your case. I was here on another matter and I thought I'd come by.
Excuse me?
I'll come by and see you later, okay?
What?
Where?
Form follows function. They've never been able to make a better one. Mousetrap.
Someone picks it up motion trips the trap, sets off the timer.
We say nothing to the media or anybody. Our bomber's signature just got a little more sophisticated.
What are you doing?
Polyester.
You're free to go. I wanted to tell you in person.
I can't discuss it.
Dominic ... I'm not a police officer. I-I-I'm a Crime Scene Analyst.
Good luck. Take care of yourself.
Hey, Dom?
Next time try not to be quite so trusting. You don't need to be a hero.
I'm not quite up to speed on the particulars of ...
Well, it suggests a lag between ejaculation and Kristy's murder but it doesn't disprove Nick's presence at the time of the homicide.
Orange?
The Hansen Building.
You get any hits? 
How disgruntled?
Sitting around making bombs.
Dispatch said you were looking for me?
So who bought it?
Do you miss your mother?
We think you engraved it with an implement from your high school shop class.
Tyler, did you make any more bombs? Where are they? Where are you keeping them?
Dominic, stop! Stop right there. Put it down!
No, no, no. Drop it. It's active!
Above the fold.
It's a tibia ... or most of a tibia.
Well, long enough for the animals to pick it clean.
Evidence of what?
It could have been a hiker who got lost. It's interesting to me how you always expect the worst.
Potential crime scene. Did you know that there's 206 bones in the human body?
Well, 205 more bones and we have a complete skeleton. If we find the rest, then we can determine whether or not it was a murder.
Okay, Catherine and I are on the case at Mount Charleston. Nick, we could use your help on that.
The tibia. Where there's one there's usually another.
I don't think that's necessary.
I know what she specializes in. If we hit a wall, I'll call her.
Sara, Warrick -- dead body in the lucky seven motel.
Bones are porous. They stick to the tongue. 
It could be a piece of wrist bone.
Flag man!
Flag!
How amazing the universe is. Everything made from the same carbon -- stars to trees, trucks to human bones.
Hmm.
Ankle bone? Medial malleolous? Goes on the bottom of the tibia?
I'll take toe bones for $200, Alex.
'All the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't put Humpty Dumpty back together again.'
No. This was a man, judging by the pelvic bone. 
Hey, Nicky?
Let's post this on the dental society database -- see if anyone responds.
Five times the length of the humerus means this guy was... six feet tall. But we don't know his race, and we don't know whether he was right-or left-handed yet.
Hmm.
Look at these jagged marks on the bone.
Well, not necessarily. Could have happened postmortem. You know, one of those tractors up in the hills. Or a mulching machine maybe. 
Teri.
It's blood in the soft tissue. If you find it, it means the guy was alive when he was cut up.
I would never turn away a scientist of your talent.
Uh, could I have a word with you outside, please?
You bring in a specialist without my approval?
Relationship? I hardly know that woman.
Just ...  ... check with me about stuff like this, will you?
Sorry. So, how did we do?
I'm glad you're here.
An electric saw? You sure?
I got to go. Thank you.
Nick, would you stay here and work with Teri on this soft tissue stuff? She'll explain it to you.
She looks distraught.
Interesting how people catalog their lives. Fifty years of marriage on the wall.
Well, maybe she only uses her other bathroom.
Try phenolphthalein?
Hmm...
You find anything?
Can you tell us anything about the operator?
And you failed to report him missing for seven months because ... ?
Hey. Where you going?
Town?
Well ... have a safe trip.
Teri, I admire your dedication to your work.
Oh. It ... it was nothing. I-I-I just called to see how you were doing.
Of course. So ... what's next?
Maybe it was just an alligator.
Do you have to go? I mean ... couldn't you take a later flight?
Have dinner with me later.
A spectrum of possibilities.
The universe.
Does your client care to tell us how her husband came to be dead?
You made it easier to transport his body?
And that's fraud.
We have to go back to the body.
We have bones.
It's supposed to treat heart failure but not if you're taking the amount found in Mel Bennett's bones.
'Someone' did. 
We know your husband had an overdose in his system. We found it in his bone tissue.
This is the part that I'm having a hard time with. You were able to cut him up when you realized you couldn't afford the burial?
Forensically, we can't prove if Mel took the digoxin overdose or if she forced it on him.
Equivocal evidence.
Rose goes free. Because we'll never be able to prove who administered the fatal dose.
It's not a contest.
Could you do it? I'm sorta late for a dinner.
Thanks.
I'm surprised. I'm having a nice time.
No. I just thought we might be uncomfortable away from work.
No.
Good.
... how a person does everything.'
Excuse me.
They found two bodies in a crack den at the end of the strip. Evidently, they've been dead awhile. They need me to do an insect analysis ASAP.
Yeah. But I asked you to postpone your flight.
Maybe I can ...
I'm sorry. 
Yeah. Grissom. All right, look ... make sure the paramedics don't leave and have the primary on the scene take photographs of the corpses at two-minute intervals until I arrive. All right?
Excuse me.
Nice tux, Sheriff.
To know this town is to know its celebrities and their histories. Portia Richmond was a legendary showgirl in her day. But, that's not her.
Who found her?
Come for the hors d'oeuvres - 
... stay for the interrogation.
Yes, sir. Well, I'll do my best.
All right, you guys, like I said on the phone it was a big party, and it's a huge house so we're going to divide and conquer. Nick, tonight you do the overall sketch, all right? Catherine and Warrick, you got the pool area.
What'd you find?
Good catch, pal. You get the guest list. Check for C.M.s.
I defect a bitter alkaloid.
Coffee machine courtesy of the city, I presume?
Cheers.
Have we I.D.'D her yet?
Run a serial number on the implants. Instant I.D.
Hmm.
She was strangled.
Strangulation's a man's crime.
Do me a favor, Doc. Photograph her injuries. Run a s*x assault kit. Include infrared for subdural bruising.
What about Portia Richmond?
Do you mind if we ask you a few more questions?
How is it that you know Portia Richmond?
No.
Did you know the deceased woman?
Yes.  A woman's dead.
Uh ... no, thanks. I'll be fine.
Of sorts. I'm just, um ... looking around.
Yes. I do.
Catherine?
Tchaikovsky's 'Waltz of the Flowers.'
It's playing our song.
You think?
If they knew each other, why wasn't she on the guest list? 
March 7, 1969, mean anything to you? Meant something to the Richmonds.
Music box, lace teddy, it's all the same thing -- it's tradition. And the joy of tradition is in the constant repetition.
March 7, 1981.
I bet he gave her one every anniversary until he died.
Las Vegas Police Department.
I think that was the point.
Sir, I have four criminalists working on this. No ... as soon as we find something tangible I'll call you, I promise.
Yeah, he calls me every hour. I can't get anything done.
No, thank you. 
May I have your straw? 
I ... I collect them.
Thank you. Oh ... mind if I look around a little?
The Hostess' bedroom. 
Too kinky.
Shall we do the room, too? 
I think the tooth fairy might have just left us a piece of Portia Richmond.
Take a look.
... Somebody did some serious spring cleaning.
Jim ...
And neither do we. We have a strong suspicion Portia Richmond is dead.
They're on the grift.
Hi. May we check your coats?
Jim ... may I? Mr. Haynes, we ran a sexual assault kit on Lacey Duvall. We found semen. Can you explain that?
Would you mind giving us a DNA sample?
We found a music box in Lacey Duvall's dressing area that belonged to Portia Richmond. Did you give it to her?
What did you covet from Portia Richmond?
Are you looking for work?
The sign says, 'Do Not Enter,' Nick. You can't read anymore? You're blind? What?
This is important. Sometimes in interrogations, Nick, you get one chance, one answer. And while I'm out here screwing around with you he's in there thinking up an answer that he didn't have before you walked in.
And?
C.M. The cuff link. Okay, I'm starting to forgive you.
And he just ran into us.
You're announcing your candidacy for Mayor?
Haynes is in lockup awaiting extradition to Texas on an unrelated matter.
You know, I think you're going to get my vote for mayor.
A canine.
Her tooth.
Evidence is like fine wine, Brian. You can't just open the bottle and drink it. You got to let it breathe.
Make yourself at home.
Proctologist.
Busy boy.
Does her name begin with a 'P'?
Really? Why is that?
Hey.
It's not what you missed. It's what seems to be missing. 
A fingernail?
Hey. Whatever happened to the fingernail that Catherine found at the crime scene?
I never figured a man for the fingernail, Greg.
Possible first-degree relative? 
Do me a favor. Run this for me.
You tell me.
Mm-hmm. Now I see it.
The family resemblance. 
Donnie and Marie -- brother and sister -- I've got the DNA to prove it. 
Let me tell you what else I can prove. Your sister, killed Lacey Duvall.
Old testament. The Book of Jonah.
'And now, the Lord arranged for a great fish to swallow up Jonah.'
You know what's wrong with the piranha, though? They've got high cholesterol.
You want to fill in the blanks?
What you do on your time is nobody's business. What you do on my time, is my business.
Sara, I'm going to need you to go to the hospital process the victim-- sexual assault kit, hairs, fibers, the works.
The evidence won't stay on the body long at the E.R.
Locard's principle: He took a piece of her away with him and he left a piece of himself here.  We get to find it.
Thank you, my sherpas.
You're looking at it. Murder case.
DA is. Guy named McCall shot and killed his neighbor over a motorcycle. D.A. Can't make heads or tails of the evidence for the preliminary hearing.
He ran from the arresting officers so the Judge refused him bail.
Franovich from days? He quit yesterday. Burnout.
Murder one. The case has changed hands so many times that the D.A. Can't make any sense of it. It gets better. The prelim's in four days.
Cath, can I see you outside for a sec?
Well, technically, I'm your supervisor. They said that Eddie took a second mortgage out on your house. They said that you still own it together until the divorce is final.
It's Eddie. I just thought you should know. I gotta get back out to Nick.
Nick, get a shot of this.
Looks like a belt loop. 
Brass, was the victim wearing denim?
Good chance this is our suspect's. I'm going to use scent pads.
A dog's sense of smell is about 40 times more acute than a human's. A dog's nose is packed with dense rolls of membranes that absorb odor. Stretched out, these membranes extend about a third the length of a dog's body. The membranes of the human nose about the size of a postage stamp.
Except there's a caveat.
Later. 
Hopefully, Sara's making some progress.
Somebody raped her, shot her and left her for dead.
Or true to form. People are usually meticulous in planning up to a murder. They rarely plan the aftermath.
Well, listen, if you get a confirmation, page me. I gotta go see Sara.
Hey.
How's it look?
She's evidence.
Sara?
If you try and chase two rabbits you end up losing them both.
Mm-hmm.
It's almost impossible in gang neighborhoods. Nobody wants to talk. People are afraid. Listen, let's see if we have any evidence that's not attributed to the victim.
Gang shooters mark their kills by tossing down their hats. 
Some sort of anthropological quirk of territoriality. Like cats spraying on a bush.
Jane?
We're looking for a shooter. Guy abducted, raped and shot a young black woman the other night.
The dogs? Constitutional issue. We can't get a warrant for the evidence we find off the dogs' search.
You're a grown man, Nick. Stop whining.
Hey.
I, uh, broke in my new shoes. That's about it. What'd the lab say?
So you're just ... looking at missing persons reports?
Sara. Do you have any diversions?
You max out on overtime every month. You go home and listen to your police scanner. 
You read forensic textbooks ...
Look, every day we meet people on the worst day of their lives. It's a lot to deal with. Everyone who's had any time on this job knows that you have to have a diversion in order to cope with what we see. What do you do for fun?
You need something outside of law enforcement. Catherine has her kid, you know? I sometimes ... ride roller coasters. 
What do you do?
Okay. What do you like?
You've got to find something to like. You can't get too close to the victims.
If you don't find something they'll all become special and you'll burn out.
Sara.
K-9 unit's going to meet us there.
That's if we find him inside his house. In which case, we'll figure out another way to get a warrant.
My priority is the case, Nick. Release the hounds.
Hey, lady. You ready for a scent pad?
Breathe deep. Girls.
Yeah!
Ma'am, is-is this your son?
Well, we're going to have to talk to him for a minute.
Actually, they're scent dogs, and I'm not a police officer. I'm a Forensic Scientist with the Las Vegas Police Department.
You could say 'hello.'
Were you wearing those pants the other night?
They're missing a belt loop. 
I find that interesting.
That's true, she isn't ... but if she dies within a year and a day of the shooting ... then it's murder.
Well, then I guess the law is on your side, Tony, isn't it? For now.
Let go of her, Ed!
Catherine?
I don't want to ever see you in this building again. This is our place of business. You understand that?
Go home, Eddie.
It's the system.
Sara ... you got to learn to let this go or you're going to spend all your time in hospitals trying to help the people you couldn't save.
Oh.
Introductions?
Mind if he and I have a moment together?
Multiple contusions to the back of the skull. Might've been taken by surprise.
Yeah, I think our robbery suspect is a homicide victim.
Melissa Marlowe.
You lifted 38 prints from the pottery store. I scanned them through AFIS. One came back. Melissa Marlowe.
Kidnapping - Colorado -- 21 years ago ... the little girl.
Well, not anymore on the left is Melissa Marlowe's print, age four -- preschool fingerprinting initiative. On the right is a print that you lifted from the crime scene.
Neither did I but since fingerprints are set for life during the fourth month of fetal development I looked beyond the size differential. 
Now, both prints are ulnar loops. Bifurcation, recurve and ridge endings are identical. 
I've aligned the prints along the delta.
No. Her print wasn't fresh. There was dust on it. Has to be a few weeks old. I think we have two separate cases. So I'm going to take the new lead in the old kidnapping case.
Well, we still don't know where she is. Her prints in the pottery store tell us that she was here possibly a few weeks ago, but Vegas is a tourist town.
I'm still not sure we can find her.
Teri ... come in.
Teri Miller, Mr. and Mrs. Marlowe.
Teri is a forensic artist. I called her to help us.
Using computer software Teri can age Melissa's picture so that we can determine what she looks like today at age 25. Then we send it off to every law enforcement agency in the state.
Well, 21 years ago, they told you that your daughter was dead. Now we're moving in the right direction.
It's preprogrammed with developmental averages?
No, no. Maybe you should drive.
I have a question.
Since I screwed up our last date, will we ever have dinner again?
You know, I did apologize.
Is that Mrs. Marlowe?
Wow. Hello, Melissa.
Catherine, say hello to Melissa Marlowe.
What?
Yeah, well, she could've cased the place weeks ago and then remembered to wear gloves on the big night.
And?
You and I have an appointment with our shrink.
You think this new bat's going to do the trick?
But these memories would be ... tenuous?
Inability to feel guilt, compassion or love, right?
Cath, meet with her again. Ask open questions. 
Thanks for your insights, Philip. I'll let you know how this unfolds.
Welcome to my world.
I hear that, uh, Greg found uranium on the swab from Felton's skull.
You'll be fine, silkwood.
Well, before Peter Parker was bit by that radioactive spider and became spider-man back in the '50s oxidized uranium flecks were used as color enhancers.
Like paint? Paints, dyes, glazes... since our guy was killed in a pottery store...
Yes.
It's not quite that simple.
Well, I don't want to be evasive. It's just that, uh ... we suspect she might have committed a crime.
A homicide.
I can let you see her, but I can't allow you to talk to her -- not right now -- and not under these circumstances.
Why would you need a lawyer?
I don't know. I wanted to observe them, I guess.
I never thought about that.
Yeah.
Any evidence relating to the murder of your father.
What?
Shall we test for uranium?
Nicely done, Nick.
Miss, have you ever worn these gloves?
Really? Well, we'll see.
It's a perfect match.
Joe lanced the safe.
Once the safe was cracked you seized the moment and bashed his head in -- three blows.
Nick, call Brass. Tell him it's time to make an arrest.
I'm sorry, but there's no evidence to indicate that there was a third person present at the crime scene.
Brain scans have documented changes in the hippocampus of individuals shifting from one personality to another. But would these two personalities be aware of each other?
Tammy's the dominant personality.
Who was also Melissa's kidnapper.
We have to stay open to all the possibilities.
I just got back to the lab, saw the smoke. What's up?
And what happened?
You both knew that there'd be a scientific explanation for the human torch though, right?
Did you find the wick?
A piece of fabric that's scorched but not completely burned ... like possibly from the nightgown.
It's called the wick effect. It's like an inside-out candle. The fabric acts like a wick, and the body burns inward explaining the high temperatures which destroy the bone. The fabric ends up scorched, but not completely burned.
Well, in science we learn through experimentation, right? Sometimes we need to see it to believe it. You guys did a nice job. Now you have to clean it up.
Tammy Felton's prelim has been postponed indefinitely.
She left town. Skipped bail.
Their house and their life savings. 
It's over. Case closed. We move on.
What do we got?
They didn't bother to valet.
Carjackers don't use knives.
They used to say, 'Never on Sunday.' Then Pearl Harbor happened. I never say, 'Never.' 
We got three minutes to process this crime scene! 
After that, we lose it all to the gutters! Sara, take overalls! Warrick, put a cone down on everything you bag! Nick, we got to get these bodies into the van!
Yeah ... our killer got lucky tonight.
Do we have any eyeballs at all?
What's your name, son?
Well, Justin, my name's Gil Grissom. This is Sara Sidle. We're with the Crime Lab. Is, uh, is that your blood?
Whoa. Slow down.
If it makes you feel any better, that's not what killed him.
And his wife?
Work of a lefty?
Hard to scream when your throat's been cut. 
Defensive wounds.
Two?
Two weapons ... two attackers.
What about the eyewitness?
Covered in blood.
In the heat of the moment, it's not a car, it's a possession and people will fight without realizing what they're risking.
I'm speaking in generalities. Regarding the Shepherds ... I'm in the dark, too, just like you.
When you carjack a car, you keep the car. You don't dump it.
Well, who kills for a joyride?
Has anybody else touched this vehicle?
Well, maybe there'll be some evidence on the inside.
Whoa. Whoa.
Well, I haven't felt that in a while.
The element of surprise.
Good question. Better question, who is she?
Uh. Put some gloves on.
The body fell out when I opened the door. It happens. We move on.
Seat belt's unbuckled. That's why she fell out.
Well, she's in the driver's seat. Was she driving? Or could she have been placed in here?
I think it's 29%, actually.
What?
How about Amy Shepherd?
Shepherd's SUV. Stab wound. Cat hair. She's linked to the first crime scene. But how?
Well, finally.
Someone has a theory.
Did you check in her pockets?
Whoa, David. Go back up to the 12th rib, please.
Our killer leave us a souvenir?
What do you leave your waiter?
How soon can we get that out of the body?
This is a nice job, Warrick. You know, casting is an art.
So we've identified the weapon used on Jessica Hall. Was it also used on Kevin Shepherd?
Sara, you still have the dagger tip from the body?
And you have the cast of the unidentified murder weapon.
A dagger's not a diamond. It doesn't last forever.
We don't have two weapons.
One weapon, one killer.
An anobiid powder-post beetle. Very nice specimen.
Your building collapsed.
Well, this little guy confirms it. This species of beetle eats softwood. Tell me about the building.
A delicacy.
Forget the beetle; this damage was intentional. You're looking for a homosapien.
Catherine, there's a reason I assigned you this case. You're good with people, both the dead and the living.
Can I keep it?
Don't forget to feed him.
The coroner just sent over a ten card of Jessica hall's fingerprints. Evidently, I'm the new delivery boy.
Are you doing what I think you're doing?
Yeah.
It's a scientist's right to re-examine his theory with each new piece of evidence, Nick.
When death is not immediate a victim will instinctively curl up into a fetal position. Which may have protected this from the rain.
You expect blood on a victim but let's ask the question: Could the normal action and behavior of our victim have put his blood there?
Okay. How did her blood get on his shoe?
Get closer.
You can if you kneel down.
Possibly to help or to hinder.
Nick, get a warrant for Jessica Hall's apartment. We'll see if suspect number two leads us to suspect number one. And bring a scorecard with you.
It's your theory, pal. 
Our little Jessica was a prolific note-taker. 'Be a good person today.'
'Cancel water cooler delivery.' 'Plan girl's night out.' 'Light bulbs for porch.'
Red hairs on Jessica. She owns a tabby cat. Red hairs on Shepherd.
Try it.
And then a $35,000 day?
How does a girl who makes $2,000 a month pull in $35,000 ... only to give it away on the same day?
It hasn't posted yet.
Wait. Go back. 
Well, we know who she got it from -- Kevin Shepherd.
Maybe.  Maybe not. 
We can't speak from the evidence, Nick and everybody else is dead.
Andre's, nine p.m. Green SUV. 'Corner of sixth. Sunday, K's office, 8:00 A.M.' This is a blueprint for murder.
He paid Jessica $35,000. He called her as he was leaving the restaurant. He wasn't supposed to die.
Kevin shepherd took a hit out on his wife and something went wrong. And we may have the proof.
I think Shepherd planned the murder of his wife.
They had a very healthy relationship.
To who?
Kevin Shepherd's. This is a transparency of Kevin Shepherd's defense wounds.
They fit perfectly over the handprint on Justin's shirt.
We just put the dagger in Justin Green's hand.
Okay. Jim got us a court order for production of documents. On the left, the phone records of Kevin Shepherd, Amy Shepherd, Jessica Hall and Justin Green. On the right, their banking records.
Jessica transferred the money out of her account. To Justin Green?
Well, if it was a straight-on hit for hire Jessica would've steered clear of the crime scene.
All in the family.
Only one left is Amy.
Why kill one when you and collect over 100 grand?
And Justin secures his double cross with an insurance policy. He eliminates the person that hired him. Jessica wasn't stabbed by accident. She was a loose end.
Normally, when they pay to have someone killed they do it so they're not connected to the crime. Why was Jessica even there?
You know what they say about looks.
They can kill.
All right. What do you have?
You been drinking, Warrick?
Two distinct tire treads -- one wide ... one narrow.
Hey, O'Riley, I wouldn't book those suspects just yet. I think they ran over a corpse.
You guys get over there. Keep me in the loop. Keep the media out of it.
It's not a problem.
You don't have to explain -- Consider it done.
Good luck.
There's a college for the deaf about a mile from where we found him.
Did you send a sample of his blood to DNA?
Has his family been notified?
Mrs. Clemonds?
My name is Gil Grissom. I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
May I come in for a minute?
The bell sets off vibrations which reverberate on the floorboards so that he knows someone's at the door.
Mrs. Clemonds, I'm here about your son Brian. There's no easy way to say this.
Brian was killed tonight.
No. No, it's not.
No, Mrs. Clemonds... we think he might have been murdered.
Would you like to talk to a Family Services Counselor?
How'd it go at the college?
What did you do?
All right. Let's go.
Dr. Gilbert? I'm Gil Grissom, with the Crime lab. You kicked my people out of your office.
Look, your student is dead. Don't you want to know who's responsible? I do. 
Why? 'Cause they don't understand the victim? Help them understand.
Is that what you think I'm saying? A student is dead. Maybe you feel responsible. Maybe you're angry. But don't be angry with us. We want to help you.
Yes, I will. I welcome your involvement. Now, may I see Brian Clemonds' file? Please?
Brian filed six complaints against his roommate -- Paul Arrington.
And he took it out on Brian. Assaulted him. Brian requested a new roommate. Request denied?
I want to speak to Paul.
You don't need to hear or speak to communicate. Or ... commit murder.
No.
Sara, you see deafness as a pathology. For Dr. Gilbert, her deafness is not her handicap -- it's her way of life.
As long as you see this as us versus them, you're going to have problems on this case.
This explains what we're doing. 
I need for Paul to read it.
Good. He recollects you.
He recollects the college.
He recollects Brian.
This is a shot of the crime scene.
No recollection.
No recollection of the crime scene or of Brian under these conditions.
Sorry. I was thinking.
About what it's like to hear.
I'm on a case.
The what?
Oh, Catherine ...
I forgot. I'm so sorry.
I thought you said that it was too late.
Hey. Any luck on the tire treads?
Yeah. They make your head itch. And, after head colds the most common medical problem affecting children.
Stay on the tire treads.  Warrick?
You ran a DNA profile and something very distinctive popped up?
What is it, Greg?
Dots of blue light on a red sea.
Pyoverdin. A pigment excreted from pseudomonas aeruginosa which is a bacteria occasionally found in the bloodstream.
I saw it. It's missing six digits. It's useless.
What do you call a guy with blue-dotted blood, lice and keys to a ford explorer?
A killer.
Yes. 
The SUV's registered to Adam Walkey. He's 18 years old; no prior complaints. We're processing it now. I promised to keep you informed.
We have a suspect.
Well, that's why I suggested we meet here. I don't need him to talk. I just want his blood. 
It's a licemeister.  We're going to comb your hair.
Not even lice eggs.
Delousing agents take time to kick in. There would have been evidence of the infestation.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa?
Greg, start a DNA comparison. This gives us enough to hold Walkey.
Dr. Gilbert can afford her personal bias. We can't. 
And we need a lot more than day-glo bacteria to get a conviction. 
Adam ... we found lice in the driver's seat of your vehicle but your scalp was clean. Was there anyone else there? A witness who might support your account?
You offered to help with my investigation and now you're compromising it.
Who says it was a hit-and-run. Not murder. He has a witness.
The witness can say whatever he wants. The important thing is that Adam Walkey was not alone when he killed Brian.
Until now, I did not know who was with him.
His witness is our other suspect.
I have just one question: Does your head itch?
I'm going to just, uh ... rearrange your part a little. Hmm. According to Adam Walkey you were with him in his SUV the other night and your head lice ... confirmed his statement. They also tell me that you were driving.
Now, why don't you tell us what really happened.
The evidence says otherwise.
Well, there weren't just lice in the SUV. There were lice on the victim's sweater.
Do you know what lice eat? 
Blood. I'm pretty sure I can prove that the lice on Brian Clemonds came from your head.
Let me tell you what I think happened.
You and Adam saw Brian walking out of a liquor store carrying a six-pack. You're underage. Maybe you wanted him to front you some beer.
Brian doesn't respond.
... Then you got out of the car.
You started taunting him. And then everything escalated.
The blood on the victim's knuckles led us to Adam.
The average male loses 80 hairs a day. A stray hair left behind lice, which brings us to you.
It would have ended there but, as you were about to drive away, something caught your attention.
Something in your rearview mirror.
And you took off.
Let me tell you something, son.
Fine. No more questions.
Just this. You want to know why Brian Clemonds ran away from you? It was dark, you were shouting at him and he didn't understand what you were saying. Brian Clemonds was deaf. 
He was afraid of you. But you were more afraid of him ... weren't you?
Some people are just afraid. 
You're not.
My mother.
She lost her hearing when she was eight.
... loved to swim. I asked her what it was like to be deaf. She told me to stick my head under the water ...
She taught me not to make fun of 'she' ... 'you' ...
...
I think running man was attacked up there and then dragged or slid down here.
And smart. 
This one evidently knows how to use a scalpel. HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS
Catherine.
What are you doing?
The carnival case?
Did you straighten up my office while you were in there?
Okay. Take Sara with you.
We're not?
I was wrong about the species.
What?
I'm wrong all the time. That's how I eventually get to right.
Someone with two legs and a medical degree.
Like David Crosby said, big fella: 'If I'd known I was going to live this long I'd have taken better care of my teeth.'
Did you ever hear a dog say 'woof-woof,' Greg? 
I mean, what is the origin of that? And what do we sound like to them, I wonder.
Did you come here with some particular 'blah, blah, blah' for me?
Greg, you know that paw prints are not the same as fingerprints.
And?
Now if we can just figure out where he went to medical school we'll be home free.
The, uh big dog is a Great Dane-Mastiff mix.
No, odontology did. Dr. Robbins' dental mold. But, uh it's always nice to have a visit with you, Greg.
'The array of the bite the squarish impression of the jaw are unique to a Dane or Dane mix.' And there are only 40 registered in the greater Las Vegas area. So if one of them is owed a visit by the tooth fairy ... yes ... I think I can.
It's interesting how we categorize evidence in terms of what it means to us as opposed to what it might mean to the case.
Sometimes we deal with bugs, worms, waste or worse. But, as scientists, we look beyond the possibly offensive qualities of these things to what they might tell us about the puzzle we're trying to solve.
People actually pay to go to my seminars, Nick. We've I.D.'d the dog.
And?
Is this your dog Doctor?
Well, you have a problem.
There have been complaints about your dog in the past.
The dog we're looking for is missing a tooth. I noticed that Simba is also missing a tooth.
That may be. We still have to take him into custody until we can determine whether or not he had any involvement in this homicide.
You said that you were a doctor. May I ask your specialty?
Do you ever consult with amateur athletes? Like marathoners?
Terry Manning.
You're assuming a lot.
Simba's mold's still damp, but you can see it's a perfect match to the bite mark on the jogger.
No. We need to build some more evidence. Find some jogger in Simba's stool.
How premium?
We need to find out what Dr. Hillridge feeds her dog.
There's nothing in here.
Surgical teams use dry ice to pack organs shipped for transplant.
Nutritionist. But all medical residents have surgical rotations. Fellas, we have a doctor's appointment.
Would you mind if I looked in your freezer?
No one's asked you to. 
Man's best friend ... but not yours, huh?
What?
May I ask you what medical school you attended?
I just thought, the way you handled that knife...
It chose me, actually.
No, thanks.
Excuse me.
Boy, these are well maintained.
Maybe she makes house calls. 
May we help you?
We can't arrest her for that.
Mr. Gesek, I'm not accusing you of anything. I'm not even here officially. Think of yourself as a consultant to the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
What do you know about organ theft?
And you know this because...?
Tell me about the local market for organs.
If someone was disemboweled and their liver taken what would that go for?
It's amazing what you can learn at a convention.
I'm sorry, guys. If she cut up that jogger she didn't use that scalpel.
I had Sanders run a degradation on that same sample. The blood is 50 to 200 years old -- antique, like the scalpel -- ruling out the possibility it was used in the murder of our jogger.
Yeah. I'll be right out.  I have a visitor.
Are you here for a nutritional consultation or to eavesdrop on my investigation?
The, uh, police sent them.
You have three prior complaints in three separate states for owning vicious dogs.
Each complaint is from a mountain state.
No. Only if we find other joggers have turned up dead. What's a liver go for these day
Terry Manning was missing several key organs-- healthy organs.
Pascal. Very impressive. I prefer Buddha, though. 'Even death is not to be feared by those who lived wisely.'
What, are you guys working in bulk now?
She made a protein shake in this yesterday right in front of me.
Get this to DNA --see if this is the jogger's blood.
Possibly drinking them.
We found blood in your kitchen blender. The lab has matched it to the dead jogger.
Why?
I haven't.
Yes. But the insects haven't killed anyone.
The madness of King George.
It's genetic.
You could've tried intravenous hematin.
And so you extracted the organs with the most blood-- the liver, the spleen, the heart.
Unfortunately, a symptom of your condition. But you've been killing people, doctor.
Yes, but the people you'd be feeding off of will still be alive. Cycle of life. 
Sergeant.
Protein powder.
She's a cold blooded killer.
4-19?
Ichabod was horror-struck on perceiving that he was headless.'
Vitreous humor is glazed over.
That means that, six to eight hours ago somebody lost their head. Then ... somebody lost their head.
It's Evaluation Day.
Where's Warrick?
Oh, that's right.  He told me. I forgot.
You're a riot, Alice. You and I are going to work the head case.
Nick, another homicide. 4-19, 40 miles outside of Baker.
Sara, you go with him.
Cath, I'll catch up with you.
Sit down.
Repeat after me. Silk, silk, silk.
At do cows drink?
Cows drink water. They give milk. A simple riddle. Common sense disguised in a puzzle of words, but an excellent barometer for evaluating someone's readiness.
You're not ready.
And that's the reason I have to hold you back.
Anybody who's great at anything, Nick, does it for their own approval not someone else's.
Gary Telgenhoff?
I like it.
What did this?
Fatal blow?
It could've been dark. Bad aim, maybe?
You think a female could do this?
Scared of you.
Really? You want me to prepare it?
Laundry detergent. Works great. It's like peeling off a rubber halloween mask.
Where's your crock-pot, Doc?
The head or the torso?
The bone structure is disproportionate.
Anything not broken?
Suicide by hotel.
What is it?
And you're in.
'Picking up airheads just got easier.'
What does that mean?
So bizarre, human behavior. What you can't cut out of your mind you can always cut out of your photo album.
I got a call from Greg Sanders, at our lab. He found peanut shells on the foot pedals of Victor DaSilva's car.
And voila. 
Mr. Calloway ... is there a remote possibility that Victor DaSilva ever worked at a concession stand of some sort like at a ballpark or ... the secret garden of Siegfried and Roy in the elephants' habitat?
Well, not according to his size 11s.
What are you doing?
What case?
I don't think that is a case.
I hate to be the one to state the obvious, but, uh ... this isn't a human being we're dealing with -- it's an animal.
And every time a dog gets run over you can't go to the vet to examine it.
You're right. I apologize. I was just checking to see where your head was at. For now, you're working alone. Catherine needed Nick.
We got another dead body call.
Maybe. Meantime, you're on standby in case Nick needs backup. 
Your evaluation form. 'Overall performance: Outstanding.' 'Ability to prioritize:' ...
... 'Improvement needed.'
Keep up the good work, Catherine. 
Are those molds dry yet?
That'll never hold up in court, though. We're going to need to make negative molds.
All right, I fed the measurements from the claw end of the hammer. 
Something doesn't seem right about this. Why would you use the claw end of the hammer to kill him and not the hammer end? 
So the footlocker had no headroom.
It's nice that he still had his hands.
The hammer didn't do it?
Well, maybe he was shot somewhere else.
What plastic? You never told me about any plastic.
Victor DaSilva's entire house was covered in plastic. He was having it painted.
Nobody famous.
I have a shoe fetish. I love feet.
I'd tell you not to step on the evidence, but, uh...
Yeah, sure. Jim.
You still got that picture that you took from DaSilva's house?
The earrings. Victor DaSilva was here with someone he cut out of his life.
Excuse me. You recognize this ear?
No. Takeout.
Footprints are almost as reliable 
... as fingerprints and every step tells a story. The first few steps, you were walking. 
See the complete heel, arch and five little piggies? The next few steps, however ... 
... the heel disappears. All of the pressure is put on ball of the foot and toes. Why? Because you were running. And my guess is that, on the day you had a head in your hand.
Mr. Applewhite your footprints ... place you at the crime scene.
But he didn't, did he? That's why you went to his house last night.
The plastic. 
You know ... the plastic that you lay down when you paint a house. The kind of plastic that you, uh ... 
... wrap a dead body in. The plastic that we found your fingerprints on.
We do.
You know that reminds me -- I got to remember to take Greg Sanders to lunch. He did a nice job sniffing out those peanuts.
We are, after this.
Ah-ah-ah. Every nine years and 34 days I feel like sharing. You'll like it. It cleanses you.
You're sitting in it.
This is exactly the same as the last two.
Different M.O., but it's the same signature.
Three or four overpowering blows to the head from a homemade weapon fashioned at the scene. 
Forces her to drink a mixture of sodium amytal as a chemical restraint. 
Overligature of the victim ...  ... and an object rape. Then he strangles her. Ejaculates on the bedsheets. 
And as a final act of degradation he poses her like a pinup.
Listen, no emotions in here.
That's the pattern; it's a continuum. 
Signature killers never want to get caught. And they won't stop until they do.
I wonder what that might mean.
Well, look for prints.
He stalked this woman. He knew how much time he had in this apartment to kill her, and to clean up after himself.
Yeah, have him check peeping toms, too five years back. That's how they get started.
It's about crossing boundaries. It's like, uh, with cake, you know? You're just going to have a little bit of the frosting and you end up eating the entire plate.
You're bringing the FBI in? Why?
I-I don't believe the investigation should go that way, Brian. I mean, roadblocks and special ops?
Gil Grissom, Agent Culpepper.
No, he didn't mention that, either.
I'm not handing it over. I'm willing to work in conjunction with you.
The what?
Unknown Signature Homicide, Metropolitan Las Vegas.
Mr., Uh, Goggle? Gil Grissom.
Would you please give Detective O'Riley a full statement? If we have any more questions, we'll get back to you.
The last time a security guard tried to help me, he ended up dead. But thank you.
I'm late for an autopsy.
He choked her unconscious and then brought her to multiple times. What about the rape?
Be careful, Nicky. The cliché's true. Signatures return to their scenes.
Are we done?
This looks like cotton. Maybe terry cloth. 
Could be silencing them with ... white bath towels?
He brings it with him and takes it away after. So, somewhere, there's evidence of this victim on a towel.
Mmm. Now we just have to find the guy and hope that he hasn't done his laundry.
What meeting? I'm going to evidence.
I didn't.
Would you guys go back to my office, please? I'll be in in a few minutes. 
I'll be happy to pass on any pertinent information you may have to my team.
You first.
Really? What kind of operation?
You're not serious. 
You're going to bait this guy with a human being? This is your big FBI plan 
Understanding him first, completely, so that we can get out ahead of him.
Well, I'm sorry, but he's not going to kill my CSI.
You want to put yourself in the path of a psychotic killer?
Too bad, because that's what turns him on -- women fighting back. Gives him a greater sense of power when he makes his final kill.
Sit down, Sara.
Not yet. He knows just enough about forensics to be dangerous. He thinks he's throwing us off track by planting confederate hairs. He probably shaves his head maybe his entire body as DNA protection.
He may gag his victims using a garden-variety bath towel which he then takes with him as part of his murder kit. He will go after another tall brunette and the torture will be worse. But this time, he won't ejaculate. At least not at the scene.
Signature killers always know their next victim. But they don't know him 
... until he tortures, rapes and kills them.
I was expecting something a little more elemental.
Yeah, well, he's not as smart as he thinks, you know? I mean, ketchup is not going to mask the DNA in his semen.
I'm sure.
You've been to talking to our Sheriff.
Yeah, yeah, I know. And if I don't shape up he going to have Ecklie take over the case.
Ah. Now that the trees are gone, I can almost see the forest.
Millander stages suicides in bathtubs with paternal figures. This guy's signature is overkill rage against young women. It's completely different.
When did you become friendly with the Feds? I didn't think you had that in you.
I told Culpepper that he could not have Sara.
This is a pretty flimsy excuse to get your circus up and running, don't you think?
This is action for action's sake Culpepper. You're risking my CSI's life.
Listen to me, Sara. If we study his past, we can predict his future. 
Whoa.  That guy's coming back.
Culpepper ... 
What was your first clue?
Sometimes, the hardest thing to do is to do nothing.
Hmm.
Occasionally I'm struck by the absence of evidence.
The lamp -- cord's still attached. All the others, he yanked the cords off. Look at the table. Books aren't even disturbed.
First time in a hotel? First time he didn't come in through the window?
Who's that guy?
Husband? Let's bring him in.
Witness? 
Suspect.
What did you get?
What about the object-rape? Indeterminate polymer?
Different how?
You liked to play golf, too.
These are your golf clubs. We found them in your hotel room. I prefer a titanium driver, Mr. Walden. I'd like to see what you use, but your carrier is locked.
So you won't mind opening it, though?
Well, so I can see if the leather on your club handles matches the leather from the object used to violate your wife.
Well, if this 'character' ... killed your wife? How did he get your clubs out of the case without the keys? 
Or, for that matter back into the case after he killed your wife?
Can I have a word with you outside... please?
You can't charge him for the other women.
For the murder of his wife, maybe but I am certain that he didn't do the others.
He read the papers -- he piggybacked on top of the killer.
Who knows? Convenient way out of a lousy marriage? He's not our guy.
Go ahead. Pull rank. But that hotel crime scene was staged to look like the signature's.
If you stop and think, you'll see it.
I'm telling you, this guy did not kill those other women.
No.
No, we don't.
He's not viable, Brian.
For those who have to ask, no answer could suffice.
Oh, do I get the weekend off?
No ...  I'm off.
It's all Catherine. She's the boss. 
Good luck.
I'm not used to having people in my house.
Did you come here to tell me about your new job?
You don't want to be a Supervisor?
We should reexamine each victim--all the evidence pertaining to each one individually.
Well, then go back to your crime scenes and look for a persistence of fibers.
Something's better than nothing.
Excuse me? Hunter?
Uh-uh. 
You recognize any of these women?
Do you know them?
Yeah, 'I don't know' doesn't get it, pal. DNA's like fingerprints. No two samples are alike. You were in these women's bedrooms.
Would you be able to recognize any of these guys?
Yeah. Probably in little hollowed-out packets of ketchup.
Could have been the staging area. Maybe he wears his murder kit.
Call Brass, tell him to meet you guys there. Let me know.
Grissom.
I remember that guy.
Hmm. Little lie, big lie?
Goggle.
Syd Goggle.
Mr. Goggle?
Syd Goggle.
These investigations are always in flux. Am I, uh, interrupting your laundry?
You were so meticulous about so many things. Shaving. The gloves. Planted evidence. That's why I don't understand why you'd bring towels that eventually could be tracked. 
Strong's gym. That's where the women told you to you to get lost, right? Stuffing club towels down their throat make your point?
In theory. But the truth is every object is changed by its owner. By his habits. His ... washing machine, for instance. His detergent. 
Your towel is caught in the agitator. 
Now, see, that's going to leave distinctive marks on the fabric, Syd. And that's just the beginning. I've had a look at your garbage.
Your garbage is in a public area ... plain sight. It's enough for me to get a warrant.
Yeah. How did you know I was here?
I just wanted to talk to him.
I believe Catherine was going to requisition one.
I never should have put you in that position, Catherine. I'm sorry.
I admire that.
Here.
Congratulations, Nicky, my boy. You are now a CSI Level Three.
I just off the phone with the Sheriff. He says he wants me to run the unit.
They say I got to let you go.
I don't care what the book says. I lost one good person today, I don't want to lose another. 
Here.
We don't consider it a joke at all.
Mr. Garris, please. Sometimes, if you listen closely you can hear a lot.
Right. Where do you hear nothing in Las Vegas?
The desert.  And, judging by what sounds like a low frequency buzz in the background, possibly near power lines.
I listen.
Mr. Garris ... it's my experience that, in situations like this if you want to go fast, go slow.
Nick, tell lab to do a reverse algorithm on that tape and then get it into enhancement.
You've been a Level Three for what, two weeks?
No, no, no. I barely heard you.
Dirt.
I never wear it. It interferes with the job.
Hmm.
Halothane, maybe.
'Looks like a professional job,' I think you said. 
Care to amend your evaluation? I mean, if the guy forgets the rag he used to knock her out, he can't be much of a pro.
Sara, that was a seminar. This is real. Pebbles, tile -- the front is all concrete.
In an otherwise spotless house.
Possible. As of now, that's about all we have, so ... I guess we follow the dirt.
We have an entire forensics lab working on this.
Yeah.
This dirt has interesting properties.
The gold flecks -- that's easy -- it's gold. The little gray squiggles? Cyanide.
No. Did you know that Nevada produces 80% of the country's gold? Miners drop cyanide powder into the dirt and it draws the gold to the surface.
I had a case five years ago. We found a skeleton in an abandoned gold mine. I thought it was a murder. Turned out the guy passed out drunk and the cyanide leached into his system.
You know, it's funny but every case teaches me something about the next.
Gold mine -- it's possible that's where he's got her.
True, but how many are near power lines within range of the drop zone?
It's a pack of coyotes. The sensor picks up any form of body heat, two-legged or four-legged.
Come on, give us something two-legged.
Yeah, well, we'll circle it again.
What was that? Go back.
There. 
Swing around! 
My god, she's below the surface.
Ground team is right behind us. I'll guide them in. 
She's got to be right up here.
Here! She's here!
Got to get her air! GRISSOM: Give me a pick -- an ax-- something. GRISSOM: Get away. Let me get in there.
Pull it!
Okay, we're going to pull her up.
Sara, get me something to cut this tape.
You okay? GRISSOM: You're going to be okay now. GRISSOM: Get this off.
Okay.
You okay?
Victor-18. Brass, do you hear me? 
We got the package, and she's still alive. ...
... Brass, are you reading me? Over.
You have to see the birthday present I got for your daughter.
I got one of these chem labs when I was six. I almost blew up the whole house. 
Yeah, what kid doesn't want a party?
The victim's ready at Desert Palm.
We'll play with these later.
And you never saw the person, huh?
You know how you got the bruising around your eye?
Sure. I'd like to get a blood sample from you, though, if I could.
You've got scratches on your arm. If we can find traces of your blood in Rundle's truck we can match the DNA -- make our case against him that much stronger.
Yeah, well, we didn't get any prints off the duct tape, our audio guys are working on stuff. Right now, we need something more concrete if we want to prove that he did it.
Me, too.
So?
Did you let him know you were recording him?
Thank you.
Sounds like our guy to me.
Survey says ... perfect match to the naked ear. Now, where's my spectrograph, so the defense attorneys can't claim that our alterations were altered?
That's 'cause the blue line is directly on top of the yellow line which makes it green. It's a perfect match.
What do you do now, Nick?
But you tell Brass to drag his heels 'cause you still got work to do.
Come see me after you raise Brass.
I want you to find something new on that tape.
You know what the defense attorneys will do with that? That's who you're up against, in the end. 
People leave us clues, Nick. They speak to us in thousands of different ways. It's our job to make sure that we've heard everything they've said. Anything less is reasonable doubt.
You any better?
Your little major-minor blowup about Lindsey not wanting a party.
No.
And that's because of you?
Well, then she'll be fine. I mean, look at you.
Yeah.
I love my work.
So, you found Laura's hairs here ... passenger side, front seat?
Yeah. So?
So she wasn't bound at all?
So, you're saying she never inhaled the halothane?
How pleased am I that I got a sample of her blood? 
So you can go check at the lab, see how it turned out.
I know.
What's up?
No deals. We know what Chip has to offer.
Laura Garris.
The Accomplice.
You got something that can't wait, Nick?
Good. I'll listen to it right now.
You did it. It doesn't matter how we got here. Just remember this.
Who's dead?
Because she ended up underground in a box. 
Greed.
But you became pretty good friends, didn't you?
Thing is, Jack, I tend not to believe people. People lie. The evidence doesn't lie.
Then you both drove East towards Sandfill mine. He probably told you about some little line shack or something where you could stay while he picked up the ransom money. But then, all of a sudden, he pulled over -- probably made some excuse.
I bet, right away, in your gut, you knew something was up. And then, just a few minutes later you knew for sure.
That's when, I believe, you got your black eye.
And then, finally, you were unconscious. He duct-taped your hands and he buried you. 
Let's listen to Chip's message, okay? Remember, Jack when I told you you could hear a lot if you listened?
It's amazing what we can do with the new forensic audio programs. Enhance sounds, isolate them.
A car went by when Chip was on the phone to you, Jack. Scared you, didn't it, Laura? Thought it might be the police?
Let's hear it once more without that annoying car.
We already have you both for about 25 years, minimum.
Self-preservation. She rats on him, she rats on herself.
Like a ginsu through a banana.
Yeah, probably, but under what circumstances? You don't wear flippers at a five-star restaurant. Why would you wear three-inch heels at a lake?  So, Watson? The game is afoot.
I believe this goes with that.  Divers recovered the body about a half a mile east of Calville Marina.
Will you collect a rape kit?
How's it look for prints?
Come on, Catherine, my hand's too big.
It's the only way we can print her. Her skin on your hand should fit like a leather glove.
May I take your hand?
On behalf of the decedent I thank you.
I think we're going to know who she is by lunchtime.
We should contact her family.
The coroner said she'd been in the water for two days. Where's the husband now?
Sure. Thanks, Jenna.
Mr. Barger, my name is Gil Grissom.
This is Catherine Willows. We're forensics investigators. Sit down.
When was the last time you saw her?
Would you be willing to give us a DNA sample, sir?
By law, we need a warrant, unless you were willing to volunteer it.
Hey, maestro, what's the deal on our floater?
Excuse me. Professor? What's up with our floater?
That's funny. I liked the husband for this.
I promise.
You're asking the wrong guy.
You were married. You tell me.
Hey. 
How's court?
Look, go home. Take a day. You're been working your ass off.
I'm grateful, Warrick. I'm glad you're back. And I owe you a party.
Yeah, I made you a CSI three.
You'll see it in your next paycheck.
Mm ...
Yeah.
Coroner just called. They're waiting for us.
Meet you at the car.
There was no water in her lungs?
So we think she was raped killed, then dumped in the lake.
'Cause it's the only place within ten miles of Calville Bay that serves calamari.
I come here for calamari.
No. Sometimes I have a beer with it.
Would you happen to know this 'good tipper''s name?
Could you tell us about your affair with Wendy?
What about your wife?
Tuesday night you and Wendy had dinner at the grille? Where'd you go after that?
Why'd you take the boat?
Where is ... the boat?
I believe he had an affair.
Mr. Barger, what are you doing here?
Do you know Mr. Swelco?
Mr. Barger, this is a time when you ought to let us do our job. You've been through a terrible ordeal. You've asked us to keep you posted and I promise we will keep you posted.
Drive safely.
No, we don't, Catherine. We have to tell him how he died. Just the facts, without all the other stuff.
You mean me.
The African Red Baboon Tarantula -- the most feared of all arachnids. But basically harmless.
I think you scared him. All his hairs are standing up.
Was it at the Marina?
My spider sense says it wasn't.
Yeah? Grissom.
How?
Just South of Barring Point Bridge? What color is the boat?
Well done, Catherine. Well done.
let's get the boat back to the garage.
We work as a team. We're not competing.
'Two roads diverged in a yellow wood and, sorry I could not travel both.'
Very good, Greg.
But actually, in this case, Mr. Frost does not apply. When you have a partner you each take a road. That's how you find a missing boat.
And you've narrowed it down to just two suspects?
I told you this?
And this theory is based on...?
I'm going to the garage to meet Catherine.  You keep thinking, Butch. That's what you're good at.
Yeah.
Blood.
Well, maybe she fought back. Either way, we got to call Brass. Tell them to bring the boyfriend in.
How's it going?
Mr. Swelco. Why don't we go in here sit down.
You just compromised our investigation.
Knowing how she died, yes. Knowing that she had an affair -- how does that bring closure?
You can't make this about Eddie. Look, you hurt our case because your ex hurt you.
You can't give him anything, Catherine. We're scientists. We're not psychiatrists or victims' rights advocates.
Technically, it's a townhouse. And the crosswords are advanced, not genius. But you're right. I'm deficient in a lot of ways. But I never screw up one of my cases with personal stuff.
She ran out of gas.
Get in the boat. Pull the engine cord.
Get in the boat.
Just indulge me, please?
That's not the point.
Pull it again.
Go on.
More.
Harder. 
Go on.
How does your shoulder feel?
I know what happened to Wendy.
She says good night to Swelco ...
... and gets in the boat. Halfway home, the boat runs out of gas.
... Stranded in the middle of the lake, she panics. Starts pulling on the engine cord.
... She pulls so hard, she dislocates her shoulder and falls forward. 
... Wendy goes under, where she remains until a barge's propeller severs her leg.
She died before she ever hit the water.
Well, sometimes it's about what didn't happen.
Look ... could we have a truce?
Good. 
But let me do all the talking to the husband and the boyfriend.
I'll meet you outside, okay?
Did it go okay?
The fewer people who know about this the better. 
I'm proud of you. You know, Judge Cohen's got a lot of soldiers.
You know, I can only help you out so much. After that, it's up to you.
Hello?! Mr. Swelco?! Mr. Swelco?! Mr. Swelco?
He didn't kill her.
Maggots. This kid's been here awhile. 
No gunshot wounds. No stab marks. No signs of strangulation.
Not if you're being chased. 
Look at the foot patterns leading up to the body. See the strides? This kid was running. 
See the left foot impression? It's straight; that's normal. 
But look at the right foot impression. It's turned outward. Almost
Based on these prints, it's hard to tell.
Fear.  Someone chased this kid to death.
No, yes, I did. Thank you.
Paperwork, paper clips, paper-punchers -- all these people want me to do is push paper; nobody wants me to solve crimes.
Yeah, the grass is always greener, Catherine.
That's what this was about-- bookies.
Warrick, you and I are on the four-nineteen -- our dead body in the desert. 
Sara, dead body of your own. Dumpsite out near Henderson.
Catherine, Verbum Dei Charter School. Four-twenty homicide. The school dean was killed in his office. Suspect called it in; could be self-defense.
Suspect's not a kid. It's the woman who founded the school. Take Nicky with you.
This kid was dry as a bone.
From exposure?
Try the Forensic Medical Journal. Read the four canons on the cause of death: Homicide, suicide, natural and unexplained. Talks about fear in the last part of 'unexplained.'
You want to know what killed this kid? Benihana the maggots.
Tox the maggots we found on the victim. Whatever he ingested has probably evaporated from the sun. But the maggots are like little refrigerators. They preserve what we digest for longer periods of time.
Yes.
What's that?
Did you guys drop anything that night? Ecstasy, crystal, 'G'?
Bobby, we found a body that matches your description of Eric. Would you be willing to identify him?
Is this your friend?
Which means?
Jimson Weed. 'dry as a bone, red as a beet blind as a bat, mad as a hatter.'
Internet insomnia.
Thanks, Warrick.
Most drugs derive from plants. That doesn't make them safe.
Who sold you this 'tea'?
Is there any way for us to track this, uh, DJ person?
Bobby? Would you be able to recognize the guy who sold you the Jimson?
And? ...
Nose spray? He had a cold.
Aluminum's the odd man out.
Jimson tea. I like to see what I'm dealing with.  Doesn't look lethal, does it?
You know what the japanese tea ceremony signifies?
That every human encounter is a singular occasion which can never recur again in exactly the same way.
Everything applies, Warrick. That's the beauty part.
Teenage wasteland.
Yeah.
Hi.
Uh, thank you. You're a total stranger to me.
Bobby, wait!
Break it up! Bobby, stop it!
Selling jimsonweed to kids.
You sent, uh, Bobby over here and his friend on quite a trip the other night.
Well, if you're gonna break the law, Jim you've gotta know the law.
What do you say, Ethan? These seeds look familiar?
'Cause you know the law, don't you, Ethan? 'Mandatory suspended sentence for first possession.' Yeah?
Let me tell you something, Humbert. You're twice the age of these kids and most of them couldn't find their ass with a map. You prey on innocent children concocting god-knows-what from god-knows-where selling Russian roulette in a bottle and you think we came all the way out here to bust you for 'possession', you dumb punk?  I'm gonna get you for murder. 
Cool.
This Ethan was selling jimsonweed tea at the desert rave. I believe Eric drank the most toxic part -- the dregs, the bottom of the batch the part that's full of seeds.
There's three things I got a real problem with: Guys that hit their wives, sexual assault on children and the scum that deal death to kids.
We need the pods to do a DNA match and we don't have them.
It's why I live.
Yeah. Nobody wanted to put that pusher in jail more than I did. Evidence sets him free.
It doesn't matter how I feel. The evidence only knows one thing: The truth. It is what it is.
I was flying to a seminar in New Hampshire a couple summers ago. I was sitting on the plane next to this philosophy professor from Harvard. He told me this story about how, every morning he takes a leak right after his three-hour philosophy class. He'd flush the toilet there'd be this tiny, brown spider fighting for its life against the swirling water. Come back the next day, flush same spider clawing its way back from oblivion. A week goes by, he decides to liberate the spider. Grabs a paper towel, scoops him up sets him on the floor in the corner of the stall. Comes back the next day ... what do you think happened to the spider?
On his back, eight legs in the air. Why? Because one life imposed itself on another. Right then, I realized where we stand. I understood our role. We don't impose our will on a spider. We don't impose our hopes on the evidence.
You'll be back.
You're a creature of habit.
I, uh ... just wanted you to know that Eric didn't die from Jimson tea. It didn't have the chemical toxicity to kill him. The seeds weren't strong enough.
Is your arm all right?
May I take a look?
I'm a PhD, not an M.D.
Bobby ... this bite is not from an insect.
Hi. 
I found a bite mark on Bobby's arm and I think it might be human.
Not really.
I don't know, Jenna. This whole case is going from bad to worse. I mean, usually it's a body, it's a specimen, but when it involves kids, I just can't ...
That's where Bobby Taylor works. Jenna, I need a mold of Eric's teeth ...
... and an impression of Bobby's arm.
It's not about memory now, Bobby. It's about the evidence and the evidence ... sucks.
You and Eric bought Jimson tea from Ethan that night.
That's why I tend to believe it was an act of self-protection. The lights were scaring him. At the same time, we conjecture that you were suffering auditory hallucinations. Both of these symptoms are routine with this drug.
I'm afraid that it is. The evidence tells us that Bobby suffocated Eric.
I know, Bobby, but you did.
This is a mold of the bite mark that we took from your arm today. 
This is a mold of Eric's mouth, postmortem.
You overpowered him, he suffocated ... and then, finally, the noise stopped.
Good. I hope you win.
Away.
Hang on a minute. 
Okay, I'm there.
Metacarpal, phalanges ... no question about it. 
Hold on, Nick.
When a body decomposes in concrete it leaves an air pocket, vacuum-sealed. We do this right, it'll open like a jar of pickles.
By law, you got to disclose everything -- three bedrooms, two baths, and a skeleton.
Okay, I'm late again. Nick's going to work with me on that unidentified body at Summercliff.
O.I.S. at the jockey club.
Good, I want you to double up. Listen, these deals are never easy so keep me informed, please.
Well, this qualifies: 4-26. But I can't give you the case.
Conflict of interest. The alleged rape victim is an exotic dancer.
No. Suspect's your ex-husband.  He's asking for you, but you can't take it.
All right.  Do what you can. But after the preliminary, you pass it off, okay?
Based on the auricular surface I'd say she died when she was about twenty.
It's in the hips. Pelvic bone is definitely female. You know, for a ladies' man you don't know much about bone structure.
Yeah, how?
No. The gouges on her ribs are unusual. The instrument had to be ... slightly curved with some kind of serrated edge. Like crocodile teeth. Whatever killed this girl was not a traditional weapon.
That's the rule. 
Who are you?
It's a six-by-three-foot section. When the concrete dried it preserved a partial impression of our Jane Doe. Did you find out anything about the house?
That would explain why the body was so desiccated.
Well, if it wasn't for a leaky pipe she might have been down there forever.
It's harmless.
The tarantula's touch is very gentle.
Teri Miller does not need an introduction.  I need you to make me a face.
They told me you were the top forensic artist in the country. 
It doesn't really look like anything.
So teach me.
Brown eyes? I thought you decided she was nordic.
Yeah. I'm sure someone needs closure and somebody else needs to go to jail.
I don't know. In my experience people usually remember a beautiful woman. 
Uh, Nick, weren't you going to go and do the, uh... 
At the ... ?
Did that make you happy?
You're not still in love with Eddie?  Catherine, you have to hand off the case. Warrick can just double up.
Okay. You have to pass off the case. If you compromise the investigation there's no going back. You could hurt Eddie just as much as you could help him.
Hey. I've already seen the marks on the ribs.
No.
Salt and sand. Killed at the beach?
She was quite an athlete, huh?
Did she scuba dive?
Did, uh, Fay ... before she disappeared, go on any vacation? Go diving or spend time at the beach?
And she, uh ... lived here with you until she disappeared?
And the, uh ... police interviewed him after she disappeared?
Well, how do you know that?
Did they... ever fight?
I heard about your eyewitness. A valet who joyrides. He sounds reliable.  So, uh, how's the thing going on Eddie Willows?
The thing that I told Catherine to pass off to you.
Get ahold of the DMV?
Warrick? Why would you call the DMV on a rape charge?
Really?
You so much as breathe on the evidence, it's contaminated and I end up the bad guy.
What's the status?
Vigorous?
'He said. She said?' It's about the evidence, Catherine. 
And you may not like where it takes you.
Ask me what?
It means she wasn't killed in Hawaii. 
Other than that ... he has no idea.
Cut it out! Not in my lab, pal.
Yeah. I hope I never have to. Nick, walk this guy out the door.
Sara.
Yeah, I know one thing: My guys will not bend and they will not be intimidated.
Ma'am, my name is Gil Grissom. This is Nick Stokes.
Mr. Hendler, we're criminalists from the Las Vegas police department.
We're investigating the disappearance of Fay Green. May we come in?
Yes, I'm afraid we did. She'd been dead for quite a while.
Thank you.
A trigger and a lionfish.
Interesting choices. Violent, carnivorous predators.
Mr. Hendler, at any time, was your fish tank over here?
Did it ever overflow?  Break?
You said I could look anywhere, right?
Got a pocket knife?
Pops out, pops in. 
What do you find inside an hourglass? 
Mr. Hendler, I think the tank was over here. I think it broke. I think you got water and artificial sand all over the place.
Fine, we'll go. We'll be back ... with a warrant.
Summercliff Housing Development. A plumber, perhaps?
Why else would you be so excited? 
Hey! You weren't going to say good-bye to me?
The ones that got away.
I see you've cleaned house. I thought you might.
I'm working, sir. Officer, would you hit the lights, please?
Surface is non-reactive.
Let's try the ALS.
Luminol works on the surface. ALS chases the protein molecules in blood. It actually penetrates the wood. These floorboards are all made of maple -- high-end-but they've been lacquered.
Yeah. 
Turn it off, Nick. Officer, hit the lights, please. 
Mr. Hendler let me tell you what I think happened to Fay. On the night of her disappearance, the two of you got in a heated argument.
Suffering a concussion, Fay falls to the floor. In the heat of the moment you decide to make it final. But Fay surprises you: She fights back. She pushes you off. She crawls a few feet away and you move in for the final attack. 
One thing that I don't know, though. What did you use to kill her?
Well, whatever the weapon it wasn't a knife, but it worked. You drove her body over to Summercliff where you were employed and you buried her in wet concrete.
Five years is a long time but eventually the past catches up to everybody.
I'll ride along with the cops. Bring homicide up to speed. This is now a fresh crime scene.
'The instrument had to be slightly curved with some kind of serrated edge like crocodile teeth...'
Mrs. Hendler. 
Nick, don't move.
Please. I don't want to fire my gun any more than you do. For five years, you've been washing the blood off your hands. 
You okay, Nick?
Come on.
Hey.
Did the count change since you called me?
What's the matter with your guys?
Put your equipment down, son. 
Put these on. I'm going to do a preliminary walk-through. You're going to take my notes. 
Don't touch that! I want everything exactly the way it was. 
The air smells like copper. Lots of blood. Breathe through your mouth.
Male caucasian approximately 40 years old lying in a pool of blood. 
No drag marks. Body does not appear to have been moved. Multiple stab wounds to the back and neck. Looks like a single-edged blade. Force to such a degree that the left and right internal jugular veins have been transected. Head faces west. Feet pointing east. Approximately two feet from the north wall, one foot from the south.
You don't sleep, do you?
Somebody left a message. I need to see the rest of it.
Female Caucasian. Appears to be one stab wound to the throat. Transection of left and right carotid arteries with exsanguinating hemorrhage. No defense marks. Cursory opinion: She was killed in her sleep.
Do you feel this?
But there's something else.
I want the paramedics that were in this house back here immediately -- police escort. Get them on this front lawn now.
Call dispatch. You tell my entire graveyard shift that I want them here ASAP -- all of them-- no exceptions. 
Sara, those photos -- blown up times ten. Tell the lab that we need every forensics tool available to us here right away. This is the only crime scene in Las Vegas tonight.
Sergeant, may I?
Tina ... I'm very sorry about what happened to you tonight. But everything we take from your house can help us find out what happened to your family.
Soon. Detective?
Thanks.
Hi. Is your name Brenda? 
I'm trying to find out who hurt your family. Do you think you could help me? Did anyone come into your room tonight? Through the door? Through the window maybe? 
Okay.
The buffalo? Who's the buffalo? 
Brenda?
First rule for this crime scene: Do not do any interviews. Second rule: Don't talk to the Sheriff either.
The killer was here not two hours ago. He left part of himself behind. Catherine, I need you inside, mapping and blood samples.
Nick, Warrick-- the perimeter. I want to know how he got here how he got in, how he got out, and how he left.
Hey, stop! Evidence!
You guys will never get it, will you?
Knife drawer. One missing.
I think the suspect's been in this house before. And this is the first place they stopped tonight. 
Good. Linoleum. The best surface.
It's not a toy, O'Riley. It's an electrostatic dust print lifter.
Like a supercharged lint remover only it lifts footprints. Possibly our killer's.
Relax. I just want to know where you walked in the house and who you touched in there.
Show me the bottom of your shoe.
Now yours. 
You fellows were both in the kitchen.
All right. Yours are the only clean prints I found. Thanks. You can go back to work.
I don't know that.
I don't rule anything out.
Sheriff?
Nothing.
As soon as I have something, you'll have something.
I could speak volumes about Conrad Ecklie, but I have a crime scene to process so ... you'll have to excuse me.
I need you to transport the little girl to the police department. Brass is waiting for you.
Sara ... I need one of us with that little girl.
I want to see all of their personal property -- clothes, jewelry, whatever they have on.
Good. You buy this cult thing?
Whoever did it killed the mother first. In her sleep, quick.
Husband woke up. Ran to protect his kids. 
The killer nicked him here. And then finished him off down the hall.
Yeah. It's a hole. We need to fill it. If we start from the inside and fan out whoever's left at the scene ...
The teen daughter?
I wonder if they call him 'buffalo.'
Tina ... do you ... go out with anyone special?
Are any of them ... called 'Buffalo'?
Bidi?
That you, Warrick?
What, are you working for OSHA now?
mm-hmm.
That's good.
That's very good.
If your whole family was murdered, wouldn't you run to them to check to see if they were still alive?
This is a Lady Macbeth.
'Out, out, damn spot.' There's not a trace of blood on the teen daughter's clothing. Not a spot.
Yeah. I need you back here right away. The Collins Case is busting out.
Please do.
Mr. Ecklie.
He should go to a sports book. I hear the Stardust is good.
Teams, Conrad? I didn't know this was a competition.
Really? Didn't graveyard beat day shift in softball last summer?
I think it was 14-3.
Let's talk about what else we have. Tina Collins' pajama top from the murder scene without a drop of blood on it.
Bidi? Bidi? I thought you found a cigarette and a match behind the house.
What did you find out about the psych exam on the little girl?
Respond how?
And ... what are you doing about it now?
But there was no blood on you.
The evidence is telling a different story.
It's not going to happen, Tina.
She won't speak.
Hmm?
'Yet who would have thought the old man to have so much blood in him?'
That's Shakespeare.
The lawyer's pleading him guilty.
I care. I don't like holes. What are they hiding?
Did you collect the property from the Collins family?
I told one of your assistants to make sure that I got them.
Ecklie! 
I want everything right now.
The Collins case is my shift. You are completely off base.
Oh, I'm sure, if you could, you would have by now. Where is it?
That's what so sad, Conrad. You think of this as a career.
The buffalo.
Sara?
Sara. When they examined the little Collins girl did they check for sexual abuse?
Have some ultraviolet photographs taken.
Grissom.
Off? How?
He was coming out of it?
Somebody was all over this kid.
We have forensic evidence that your father sexually abused your sister. 
We also know ... that he was in her room the night of the murders.
Blood drops. They fall a certain way depending on the motion of the victim. 
Something horrible happened in that house, didn't it, Tina? Long before the night of the murders.
But why your mother? And why your brothers?
You?
Brenda is ... ? And who is ... ?
Good work.
It'll be back to normal in 24 hours.
So ... dead guy in first class?
Coroner pronounce?
Eyewitnesses?
Where are they now?
Point of disturbance: Cockpit door. Bloody handprint.  Looks like foot impression. Ballpark shoe size ... ten to eleven maybe. 
I want this whole plane taped off ... nose to tail and wing to wing.
I've got a dead body, a crime scene with wings. Something very wrong happened in this plane.
Sheriff?
I don't follow you.
I don't even know if we have a homicide yet. First reports indicate he had some kind of an episode.
You running for mayor?
So? What do you think?
I think we got ten witnesses all singing the same song. Deceased went berserk. Unless we find something else in the evidence, that's what happened. Catherine ...
Thank you. Warrick, go with. 
Brass has them all assembled in the lounge. Assume there's evidence on everyone. Nick, go with the coroner. Sara and I will work the plane. This is a mobile crime scene. It might not be here tomorrow.
When did you become aware that there was a problem in the cabin?
How much time did you spend with him?
In that time did you notice anything that would explain his behavior?
Was he drunk maybe, or on drugs?
Dr. Kiera Behrle, 3-E. Emily Behrle, 3-F. Nate Metz, 2C.
Nate Metz.
Let me guess who was sitting in 3C. 
Blood drops ... away from the main event.
Could just be a bloody nose.
Lou Everett.
So, any bites?
If nothing criminal happened on that flight ... why isn't anybody talking to us?
Then we get to play hide-and-seek.
I just got off the phone with Nick. The coroner did some carving on our dead guy. She found intercranial bleeding, thoracic hemorrhaging a ruptured spleen. And, for what it's worth the guy also had a fever.  You find anything interesting?
Victim had defensive wounds on his hand.
The other half of the wine bottle ... from 2E. So ... Marlene in 2E slashes the victim. He's bleeding. Where does he go?
No 'patent' evidence. But if there's blood present there may be latent evidence.
Thank you.
Well. Would you hand me the Christopher Columbus from my field kit? Thank you.
No... but there's protein in it.
You know, high altitude enhances the entire sexual experience. It increases the euphoria.
Hand me a swab, please.
A magazine.
'Applied Psychodynamics in Forensic Science.'
I'll get you a subscription. 
Now, cite your source.
Yeah.
You started it.
Yeah. I think, due to your, uh ... firsthand knowledge and experience in airplane bathrooms, you should do the swab.
Yeah. 
Fibers drawn from his pants maybe?
Nick's working on it.
Bring me the jacket. If I do heel impressions I'll need something to compare it to. See you in twenty.
... I need their shoes.
Because you're the 'people' person, right?
Please?
I used to have a pair of these.
Max.
Yeah, that's a match. Okay.
That distinctive mark on the circular tread... hmm.
Mm-hmm.  Makes sense. Okay. Thanks, Catherine.
We have a ping-pong ball. We just need to find the paddles.
Probably in the first compartment.
The doctor in 3E told Catherine that she performed CPR on the victim. Check the inside of the paddles. See if there's any bio gel on them.
Yeah, and if she didn't know, the Flight Attendant sure did.
Sir, it's been a long night, and we don't have much time before our crime scene flies away.
You were sitting in 1A.
The blind leading the blind.
Can you identify the voices?
How do you mean?
Mr. Cash, you got to help me. I got eight eyewitnesses with various stories. I put them all in a mixing bowl, add eggs, milk stick it in the oven, and all I got is a limp souffle.
I got two hours till I lose my crime scene to the Feds. Tell me you have something.
That's more than I got.
Tight fit.
Flight Attendant gave him two aspirin. Why?
Swelling of the brain.
Is that what killed him -- encephalitis?
A, B, C, D or all of the above. Standoff with the police -- guy gets shot in the chest, runs back into his burning house inhaling smoke as he goes. The roof collapses the air conditioning unit falls on his head, he dies. What killed him?
Okay, Vicki Mercer and Carl Finn. I believe are in the bathroom.
Emily Behrle is in 3F. 
Preston Cash, 1A.
Right there, 3C. And for now, he's alive until he's dead.
The physical evidence that Sara, Nick, and I collected is contradicting the anecdotal statements that you, Catherine, and Warrick got and my money's on the physical evidence.
I mean, if this was an arson case, we'd burn down an empty house to prove our theory, right? Well, in this case we're going to recreate the flight from... 1630 hours on. You are in 4B.
Catherine-- the doctor, 3E.
Max and Marlene, 2E and F. You two are married. Who wants to wear the pants?
In the interest of clarity, yes. Nate in 2C.
Okay, look, it's going to be sunrise in ten minutes. We're going to have to do a run, lola, run and play this in literal time. Up until the point that Captain Murdle escorted the dead guy back to his seat the events are substantiated by the flight log and the eyewitness statements unless anybody knows something different.
1632 hours -- exactly 33 minutes before they landed in Vegas. One minute later, the plane hit turbulence.
Well, we know he's suffering from encephalitis. He's probably sweating and fighting back a migraine.
Yeah, but Candlewell is ticking off Nate in 2C even worse. I mean, this guy is perseverating. 
Uncontrollably kicking at the seat.
So, I get up, spin around ...
... confront the guy.
By this time, Candlewell's got to be out of his seat, right?
Candlewell's moving up and down the aisle by now.
There's a bottle of wine on the floor.
You slash at Candlewell ...
Now our guy's bleeding. He turns and heads for the cockpit.
Bang, bang. He wants in the cockpit ...
... but the door is locked. 
Captain Murdle gets on the horn calls first class twice. No answer. Why?
He can't get in the cockpit. What's next? 
He heads for the exit door. Blood underneath the latch handle shows that Candlewell tried to open it.
And, if he gets the door open, they all die.
The struggle ensued. Max and Lou slammed into Preston
... and, at some point, Candlewell goes down. Now it's a free-for-all.
Nate's knuckles were bruised ... so he was in on it.
That makes us all murderers.
I want five of those passengers arrested for murder.
We looked at the evidence, and the evidence says five.
On the surface, self-defense. They thought Candlewell was bringing the plane down.
But he didn't. They stopped him, and then they killed him -- not as individuals, but as a mob.
Not yet. I need more time.
Don't do that.
You don't know that, Brian.
That's what a jury would say. That's not what the evidence says.
It's about human nature -- how people react when their lives are threatened.
I can't answer that question.
It's not about that. You all have different opinions but you've taken the same point of view. You've put yourself in the shoes of the passengers, but nobody's put themselves in the shoes of the victim. That's the point.
Nobody stopped to ask Candlewell if he was all right. They just assumed, because he was kicking the back of Nate's seat, that he was a jerk -- because he was pushing his call button that he was bothering the Flight Attendant -- because he was trying to get into the lavatory he was making a scene -- because he was going back and forth up and down the aisles, he was posing a threat.
No. He turned into a threat. It didn't have to be that way. People make assumptions. That's the problem. You just did. And I think these passengers made the wrong assumption and now this guy's dead.
If just one person had stopped and taken the time to look at the guy to listen to him, to figure out what was wrong with him it might not have happened. It took five people to kill him. It would have only taken one person to save his life.
There you go, detective.
Good morning, Catherine.
He was Steve Wynn before Steve Wynn.
All seems very neat and peaceful, doesn't it?
With a Xanax back. 100 pills. Prescription filled yesterday.
If only life were that simple.
Looks like somebody did.
He's got adhesive residue on his wrists.
Well, that would be the obvious.
Welcome ... or unwelcome?
Did somebody clean him up?
Curious, isn't it?
Initially?
When I saw the TV on.
Any luck?
What about the cans outside?
Hey, Doc.
These abrasions around his mouth? What? Hard to shave when you're stoned?
Petechial hemorrhaging? Also suggestive of suffocation.
These three, circular, red marks on his chest? They're not bug bites.
CPR wasn't performed.
It's hard to OD just inhaling heroin. I know he was restrained which leads me to believe that someone forced him to ingest lethal amounts of heroin and Xanax.
Here's where it gets interesting. I took six prints off this bottle.
They all belong to one person.
It's good if you're us ...
Bad if you're Janine Haywood.
Not tonight, no. Why?
Where did you get it? 
Did you try this coffee?
The last cup I had tasted like motor oil.
Your pot?
Good. You're using my water so I guess that makes it community coffee. 
You want a cup, Nick?
What's the matter with your leg?
This is pretty good.
Let me see the bite before you get gangrene. Chigger bite.
Probably picked it up walking through the ferns in Braun's backyard. See if Catherine's got some clear nail polish. It'll seal it off from the air, keep it from itching.
Ah -- Whatever happened with that doggy door?
Be sure to check it against Janine Haywood's prints.
Xanax?
Where are all the undissolved pills?
Most OD's die before digestion's complete, right?
Okay, so what do we know that we can write home about?
Wouldn't have taken much to bind his hands with duct tape.
How many?
It's been 24 minutes, Greg. When's this thing going to be done?
Is this going to be a short story or a novel?
What's the 6-MAM count?
So Braun should still be walking around.
... and the point of your New York story was ... ?
Braun didn't die of a drug overdose accidental or otherwise.
Robbins opened him up. His lungs were compressed. Remember Burke and Hare the two 19th century Scottish body snatchers who made a living intoxicating innocent victims and suffocating them? Sold their cadavers to teaching hospitals? Got away with it, too, until a medical student discovered his fiancée on a slab.
Janine Haywood said that she left the house when the drug dealer arrived. I think she came back.
Would have been easy to tape his wrists mash up fifty pills ... 
... and force-feed him a Xanax cocktail.
So everything was going great until the gardener showed up. Then I think her plan turned to panic. It takes time to OD -- time Janine didn't have.
Burke would kneel on his victim's chest, right, covering their mouth and nostrils.
Hello.
Where?
Brass, you're breaking up.
Said he was in Blue Diamond, digging something up.
'A sable cloud turns forth its silver lining to the night.'
And a lot of silver.
Mr. Ritten ... it appears that we may have physical evidence connecting you to the murder of Tony Braun.
Did you ever leave anything there? Did you ever bring anything over to his house?
Who is he?
He's family. Why's he using the doggie door and not the front door?
Or on the doggie door ... but the brother's are.
So, call the print lab.
Nothing probative.
Look, forget Curt. Forget Janine. Forget the suspects. It's simple. We got to figure out how a piece of duct tape from a roll we found in Curt Ritten's truck ended up wrapped around the wrists of our victim.
It's a quirk. I always like to discuss fingerprints in person.
How long ago?
Be more specific.
You can't replace your brother.
What's the matter with your leg?
Mind if I take a look?
I'm an entomologist, actually. I-I know all about bugs.
Chigger bites. You might want to try some nail polish, keep it from itching. Would you mind if I took a photograph for my bite collection?
We're almost done.
In the, uh, last 48 hours have you been anywhere else besides those two places?
It might just get a little more routine.
Nick, I need your leg. Show me your bite.
Hey.
What time did you log in at the Braun house?
How long after that did you start processing the backyard?
You're not the only one with chigger bites.
Walt Braun. It's now 9:30 at night. Approximately 36 hours ago, you were bitten. Three hours earlier than that Tony Braun was murdered. Chiggers run a predictable course. 
A chigger attaches itself to a hair follicle injects a digest enzyme into the skin which ruptures the surrounding cells allowing the chigger to suck em up leaving behind a red, itchy bump.
Walt Braun lied. We now have an entomological timeline that places him at the house on the day his brother was murdered.
What evidence do we have that's still open?
We have to deal with that earring.
Ms. Haywood ... you have pierced ears.
How about your girlfriends or Tony's girlfriends -- any of them wear studs?
How often does she vacuum?
Hmm. The day Tony died.
Well, if the maid is as good as Janine says she is ... then ...
Whoever's prints are on the duct tape is missing an earring back. Who's the only other woman in the story?
She's here now.
We saw the fight in the police department.
It's funny, just recently I had a little education in earrings and I noticed that you have pierced ears.
It's okay, Jim, we have enough.
We compared it to a set of unknown prints that we found on some duct tape at the crime scene.
You know, sometimes, doing the job that we do our biggest break comes from the most innocent circumstance. It was the maid's day off, but not the Gardener's.
So you had to wing it. The gardener came to the window ...
... but he didn't see you ... so you removed the tape from Tony's wrists ... and made it look like an OD.
And an opportunity presented itself. Tony had erased you from the will and Bonnie wanted the people that hurt her to pay.
It's mine now. 
Surveillance?
Banana skids and fresh blood -- that helps. Oil slick doesn't hurt us either.
Striking resemblance to Judas.
Both men lost their lives over a worthless bag of chips.
Hey, Sanders, no punk rock.
Are you nuts?
Whoa. Careful. Livestock.
Hissing roaches from Madagascar.
These babies run two and a half miles an hour.
Fifth annual entomological convention in Duluth. Cockroach racing finals.
Actually, I'm giving a tutorial in preserving mass crime scenes. The sideshow is racing these guys.
I mean, to have a chance to run against legendary roaches like Cocky Balboa; The Drain Lover; Priscilla, Queen of the Gutters. It's huge.
Dog food.
You are.
That's tonight?
Man, these guys are primed.
If it was about seniority, I'd ask Nick. If I needed someone to stay up for three straight days I'd ask Sara. Instead, I want you.
Your curiosity would be better served on the case.
The shooting death of a con man at the Tropicana. Our guys are already there.
No.
The seminar was fine. Every one of my roaches got stage fright. They came in fourth, third, second and dead last. How about you? How'd you do?
'I love mankind, it's people I can't stand.'
Linus.
You think I like dealing with people? Remember when you asked me what I was in high school? 
When I leave CSI, there won't be any cake in the break room. I'll just be gone. So I wanted to see if you could step in. 
Tell me ... all of it, from the top.
Couldn't have been that bad.
Where's the man?
Well, this is as phony as a chappaquiddick neck brace. See how the clothes are all bunched.
It's impossible to redress an unconscious person to make it look like they dressed themselves. You notice anything about the suit coat?
Very good, Jim.  Why do they think they can fool us?
Call me if you learn anything.
Let's go up.
Mr. Fairmont was staying in Murder Central.
Sara, you're with me in here.  You guys get the elevator.
Smell the musk? Hint of bleach? 
Sexual intercourse.
Well, he's either careless or arrogant, maybe.
Yeah, you want to dust the champagne bottle?
Yeah, but they're not all biological. Some are soda stains, food stains, whiskey stains, you know.
You sound like you're making a commercial. Nick, hit the lights, will you?
Okay, we're looking for the freshest stains.
Hmm ... 'starlight, star bright, first star I see tonight.' 
Okay, I'll let you guys do the collection.
Oh, and Sara? 
Last hotel room nearest the stairwell -- easy entry and egress for an intruder and if the victim fights back, fifty percent less chance of being heard.
You tell her about the 911 tape?
Any ear-witnesses?
That's about as good as an eyewitness.
Grissom.  I'll be right there. 
No lunch.
We got a time?
From?
Aneurysm from trauma ... infection...?
Brain dead at 38, otherwise healthy and strong. Is this a Frankenstein?
How many organs they take?
Man, those harvest doctors move, don't they?
All right, I'll notify the PD about the organs.
You got a closer view?
Uh ...
Could be livor mortis.
We can't count on a photo to draw that kind of conclusion. We need the body.
I thought I'd raised a flag with the good doctor when I told him I was going to notify the police department but evidently, I mis-communicated again.
Well, if they haven't embalmed him we can still get a blood sample test for heavy metal poisoning.
You found it, you run with it. 
You can do it. Take Nick.
Useless-- heart has no memory for poison.
You want to clue me in?
On the case, 'Greggo'.
Secretary moved the body.
The secretary has dandruff.
Pical eczemas like that require prescription medication. The primary ingredient of those medications -- selenium sulfide.
You asked for it.
He has free will.
Must've grabbed the bottle ...
... upside-down to pour.
So ... who was he with?
Yeah ... but what never lies?
At least partially. Heavy metal, after all.
Actually, that's how the phrase got started. People used to dig up the bodies to extract the gold.
What's the most important component in a poisoning.
Patience.
Hydropazeen? That's an antiemetic used to counteract heavy metal poisoning.
So, this is Claudia.
She donated his organs and cremated his body.
An organ with a memory, maybe?
I just came from the D.A. Their attorneys were there as well. Based on everything we have the D.A. Is not going to move forward. He says it's a reject.
Brass is still in the field.
You're free to go.
That's what the D.A. said verbatim.
It's not always up to us.
Sara ... look ... 
I know this isn't news to you but sometimes science isn't enough.
It isn't a competition. We don't win.  The courts are like dice. They have no memory. What works one week doesn't work the next.
But, see, if you get mad, then they do win.
... But, hey ... the good news? There's no statute of limitation on murder.
A girl in a culvert pipe ... at a highway construction site in the middle of an alfalfa field. 
You got anything to add?
Who found the body?
Well, there goes that theory.
Whoever finds the body is the first suspect.
What do you got?
A second body ...
Which one died first?
My Uncle Phil used to say you can't kill two birds with one stone.
Somebody snapped her neck.
Fingernails maybe. Possible sign of struggle.
Cause of death?
Something doesn't seem right. 
Brunette ... 
Elaborate tattoos ... perfectly dyed hair. 
Multiple body piercing. Tells me she craved attention.
Blonde ... seems almost prosaic. She doesn't even have pierced ears. 
She didn't shave her legs.
So, besides time of death, what do our dead flowers have in common?
What about the culverts?
Print lab ID'd one of the vics.
Brunette. Joan Marks. At 18, she was booked for felony shoplifting. Lived at home, we got the address. Warrick grabbed a uniform. He's on his way there with a warrant.
Registered to a Donna Marks.
: Well ... we know what they have in common now, don't we?
Makes sense. The blonde's lacerations were filled with glass.
From inside out.
How are you at solving puzzles?
I have a hint for you. When they cool sheet glass, they lay it out on tin.
And establish a timeline.
It smells fresh.
More sweet and sour.
Mostly sour.
What do you think? Increase in appetite, or ... perhaps a guest?
Universal remote. She could do everything she wanted from this chair but cook a roast.
Catalogues, the internet, mail order, takeout ... 1,200 miles on her car. Agoraphobic maybe? Or she just doesn't like people?
I'm here about foreign DNA on Donna Marks' neck.
You found a match in CODIS?
You're saying that Donna's sister scratched her?
No, Greg, you didn't. But you've helped.
If she shopped online why'd she place orders over the phone?
Without physical contact?
Personal e-mails?
Pull up his most recent.
So, what do we know about this 'Apollo'?
Yeah.
An address?
That's strange.
Her greek god is in the slam.
The key to any successful business, huh? Word of mouth.
I imagine. It's like a theme park.
So, as long as I'm in business, you're in business. 
Are your inmates allowed to use e-mail anywhere else but here?
Something tells me state funds aren't your only source of revenue.
So, let me get this straight. I receive a catalog in the mail. I call a toll-free number to place an order and I'm giving my personal credit card information to a 'Hello, I'm doing 'time-life'' operator?
All right, let's cut to the chase. I'm investigating the deaths of two young women one of whom was having a 'relationship' with an inmate at this facility. I need to speak to that inmate. His e-mail alias is 'Apollo.'
I can get a warrant.
Why?
Hey.
I processed the prints.
They're not a match to Joan's boyfriend.
But ... we do have a match.
Released last week. His parole officer brought him in.
We found your fingerprints on the toilet seat in her bathroom.
Well, unfortunately I can't arrest you for lying.
Six months ago, Donna Marks ordered a sweater and two scarves from Magnolia Apparel. You took the order.
How many of your callers invited you home and served you Chinese food?
When Donna placed her order for the clothes she gave you her email address, didn't she?
You know, Mickey. I don't think your intention was to kill. All of your priors are for non-violent activities, right?
Well, we know we have two liars. Do we have a killer?
So what does that tell us?
She had multiple incised wounds. But the only contusion was on her forehead suggesting that that's where contact was made. So she was standing upright when she went through the door. 
She walked through it.
It's your science.
Hook up with auto detail, tow it in.
Well, that might explain why Joan bought coolant twice in the last week from a convenience store. We ran her credit cards.
Either someone unfamiliar with the car, or ... someone in a desperate situation maybe.
Good.  Grab me a sample of fluid, too, will you?
Yes.
What is it, Greg?
How about that? Economical and practical.
What do you use in your fertilizer? Nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium?
Mr. Willoughby, would you mind if I fingerprint your spigot?
Thirsty?
Yeah, I wouldn't drink it either. I wouldn't even put it in my radiator. I don't have all the pieces yet, Mickey, but, uh ... I'll tell you what we do have.
We know that Joan scratched Donna. We also know that Donna died first.
That's right, you didn't.
Donna's death was an accident.
... He's got to go all the way.
A guy like me.
Where is he?
Thank you.
The rain?
In descending order -- first victim was August 17, 1959; second victim, August 17, 1958; this guy, 1957.
I have a pretty good idea what it's going to say.
August 17, 1956.
Paul Millander. Remember the first victim? Royce Harmon?
Stuart Rampler, second ... 
... and now ... Pete Walker.
Coincidence. Make anything more of it gives Millander more power than he deserves.
Yes, he can. 
Thanks.
Cath ... Come here, take a look at this.
It's not lividity.
From what I can tell, he was shot once in the chest. Unburned gunpowder wouldn't plume this way.
I'll have Robbins check for leaks. Maybe he can find a hidden bullet.
So another victim ... or an accomplice?
The others didn't have stippling on the side of their faces. Unburned gunpowder doesn't change direction and stick. 
Unless ... he turned his face away from the gun.
Nobody misses from this distance.
I think this might be intentional.
He's telling me he's going to show me both sides.
Could be Millander's.
Yeah, but what decade?
Look under 400-X. The tag cell is aged.
Not if he nurtured it. Kept it in a freezer.
Maybe just one.
I don't know yet.
Yeah. None of it matters. It's one of those few cases where physical evidence isn't helping us much. I mean, put it in context. The victim's birthday is always on the anniversary of the murder of Millander's father. Staged like his father's death. A planted hair, a planted fingerprint ... it's all biographical. He's using the evidence to tell us a story.
Run the other two vics. Royce Harmon.
So what's the commonality?
Excuse me. Officer Yarnell?
My name's Gil Grissom, with the Las Vegas Crime Lab. May I ask you how many speeding tickets you issue a day?
You wrote tickets to three people who ended up dead.
Court.
Excuse me, Officer. I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab. I need you to arrest a murder suspect.
Judge Mason. His real name is Paul Millander.
Officer, this man is not who he's pretending to be.
He's wanted in Clark County for murder.
You know where I'm from ... and I know who you are.
Identical.
That every person is supposed to have an exact double somewhere in the world?
Never been proved.
Well, you know, we could always do a DNA test.
A doppelganger, evidently. Do you have your mentholatum?
No. The judge just got sloppy.  Thanks.
Go ahead and take the Tahoe. Call me later. I'm going to dinner.
I was admiring these rain boots.
You have a lovely home.
May I ask how long you've lived here?
Nice to meet you, Craig.
No, we can't.
Excuse me. I'm sorry.  Grissom.
Okay. Thank you.
Uh, I have to get back to my lab right away. I'm sorry. Thank you for a lovely dinner, Mrs. Mason. 
Craig ... your honor.
I don't care what the computer says, that guy is Paul Millander.
We have to disprove this Judge Mason. Birth certificate -- was he born in Mulberry?
Burned down?
So Judge Mason has no birth certificate. How convenient. Man, this guy plays way out in front.
In the name of Paul and Isabelle Millander.
We're with the Las Vegas crime lab.
Your son?
Halloweird.
Would you happen to have any of his work still?
Might I take a look at it?
Hmm, it's rudimentary. Almost childlike.
It's an ashtray?
May I?
I wonder what this green discoloration is.
I could take this back to the lab and analyze it. I promise to bring it back.
When did she die?
What about your son Paul?
It's plausible. It's not provable ... yet.
These were his father's prints. He was planting them as if they were his own.
Greg, if I refer to Millander as smart, it's one thing but I mind if other people do it, okay?
What have you got on the hair Catherine recovered?
Find me.
Did I miss something?
Clear ... concise ... anonymous.
Here come de Judge.
... Paul Millander.
It's ... it's Greg.
Come on.
You didn't beep me for that.
Why?
Paul killed Pauline. But he didn't murder her.
So that's what you've been hiding? That your daughter is now your son?
Mrs. Millander, we believe that your son has murdered three people and that he's living under the assumed name of Judge Douglas Mason. I need your permission to collect some hairs from Pauline's bedroom for use in court.
We took this hair from your childhood bedroom when you used to be Pauline.
So, uh ... you were a girl when you were inside the house and a boy when you were out in the world?
You did what you could do. You testified against them.
And you started to identify with the aggressors. 
Why are you smiling?
Sexual reassignment. Not just a man, though-- a Judge. Doesn't get much more powerful than that 
But none of it solved your problems, did it? Or else you wouldn't have killed three innocent men.
I have a warrant for your DNA.
See you in court.
No.
No.
It doesn't matter, Paul -- you'll be in jail.
What is going on? I thought Millander was supposed to be arraigned at
He had my I.D.
Yeah. They know where to find me.
He never slips up.
Mrs. Millander?
Well, he had a million dollars in his checking account.
He's a real estate developer. On the mayor's committee to revitalize downtown.
Nope. That's why we're here.
You don't have to say anything.
Vegas.
No blood on his clothes.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
His hands were covered in blood and he had a million dollars in his briefcase.
Yeah. Henry VI. Where is he when we need him?
What happen to the man in the moon?
What'd you find?
The blood on his hand was female.
What about the car?
Yeah. We don't have a crime yet.
Where is it?
It was the right index finger?
Any hemorrhagic tissue?
How did Catherine seem?
And her behavior toward Logan? Was she under duress? Agitated?
A severed finger, a million bucks. And Catherine's not allowed to talk to anyone.
It's time to speak to his wife.
To the blood on Logan's hands.
He's a real estate developer. Does he own any other properties?
But occupied?
Grab Sara. We're gone.
Helium canister.
The Lexus stopped there. 
Catherine walked up to here.
Could be the kidnapper's.
Thank god. 
I know -- Amanda Freeman. She's dead ... and whoever touched the money probably has glow-in-the-dark paint on their hands.
Yeah, nicely done. I know just about everything except ... where are you?
So, you couldn't see what he looked like?
Blowfly eggs?
Unhatched ova. They're waterlogged.
What is it?
It wouldn't have made any difference. She was killed long before you could have helped her.
Mrs. Logan, maybe. They would have had a lot to talk about.
Then, uh, what did you talk about for three minutes and fifty-five seconds?
I think you went to your husband's townhouse -- a townhouse you probably didn't know he had - and a civilized drink turned into a violent brawl.
Cut off her finger, stuck it in a mint tin and left it for your husband.
Whoa!
So, Roy Logan set this whole thing up?
During this elaborate farce you never thought to ask him why he was making you jump through these hoops?
The Tangiers.
I'll follow the money.
Okay, let's run this. Amanda was tired of being number two, so she calls up Mrs. Logan to discuss her affair with her husband. 
But Mrs. Logan doesn't just discuss it she throws down the gauntlet.
Most killers take their time planning a murder. He took his time covering it up. 
Forty-eight hours to be precise. 
So Logan cleans up the crime scene and calls his lawyer. Asks him to help him with his little charade. I mean, what better way to protect your assets than to pay a kidnapper who's already on retainer?
Out of one pocket into the other. 
I especially liked the little show he did for us in the coroner's lab. Trying to find out how much we knew.
Because without the body, Logan would always be under suspicion.
I saw the locker 
... and I saw Logan's briefcase. It was too big to fit inside. His lawyer had to remove the cash by hand.
You sure?
A Body Farm is not creepy. It's a controlled study of situational decomposition. All in all, a very healthy place.
It's a carpet beetle. It shouldn't be here.
Carpet beetles are the last to arrive at a corpse -- when it's almost a skeleton. I mean, this guy's still fresh.
David! Get this body out of here now! We got cross contamination!
Talk to me about what?
Well, the lab fridge was full. I put in last night. 
I'm going to test for horizontal motion on bloodstains. Vis-a-vis surface textures. 
Hey, any of you guys got any linoleum at home?
I know. That's why the Red Cross gives it to us 'cause it's past its expiration date.
Anything new on the body farm victim?
Okay.
I'll be in autopsy. Let me know.
A bullet.
So, how do you explain that?
So, let's excise it. Do a more localized search.
What's your best tool for excising the tissue of our Mr. Doe?
Good.
We're excising a wound tract.
It is.
From the ribs?
Bovine.
Genus hypaderma. These are normally found in the intestinal tract of cows. These maggots aren't found in humans. 
The body farm also studies animals, not just humans.
Only one way to find out.
Accelerant.
I was. 
Sometimes, it's about where the fire isn't.
Did the fly find the beef in the wound and lay its eggs or did it bring the beef with him?
None of these beef particles are as big as the tissue found in Mike Kimble's wound tract. And I found out the ex-husband is the proud owner of a registered handgun.
It means I need to see that gun.
About?
I'm working it.
Yes. You're right, you are. So, take some photos of the experiment for the D.A. And then ... uh ... get rid of that stuff.
Yeah.
I don't know.
Thirty.
Okay. Have Nick do it.
Thanks for coming in.  Is this your gun?
May I take a look at it? 
It's been cleaned.
May I ask what kind of ammunition you use?
It's melting.
I'm putting it in the freezer.
Well, have Brass get a warrant for the mother's house. Check the evidence we recovered from the dead boyfriend's house. They stayed in both places.
One thing at a time.
I can't. Take Nick.
'Match not found.'
You getting anywhere with the print?
They say the eyes are the window to the soul.
In a way, it's true. The aqueous fluid and the vitreous in the human eye allows for an image to be reflected in it.
I think my popsicles are ready.
What are you doing here? Isn't this your day off? 
Yeah, I had to freeze it with a touch of liquid nitrogen.
The meat from the projectile was visually indistinguishable from the victim's stomach tissue. We know that your gun was clean but it turns out that your re-loader wasn't.
The material that was on your re-loader is consistent with the material we found in the victim's wound tract. Ground beef.
He gave her a camera?
He can confess to the homicide but we're still examining evidence on the arson.
The harm would be to the justice system unless I misunderstand our place in it.
What I think and what the evidence proves are possibly two different things.
What is this?
Why?
We have the best lab in the country.
What does that mean?
Everybody here respects you.
Is this about that hamburger thing?
Hey, Sara? 
The Lab needs you here.
Did you hear the dad copped a plea on the murder and the D.A. expedited it?
Accelerant. Identical to the type found at the arson. Police got it out of Jody's gym locker.
So who started the fire?
Except when she's on his boat, right?
This is your sleeping bag we took off your boat. Our lab turned it inside-out. The discoloration you see is a mixture of vaginal and seminal fluid ... your daughter's and yours.
No, he can't. In the State of Nevada, we're all bound by a legal statute. The sexual assault of a minor age 14 and under is a mandatory life sentence with no possibility for parole.
Tough case, huh?
Well, you wouldn't be human if it didn't affect you.
Sara, you know, she gets very emotional ... 
Good. Let's move on.
Yeah.
Yeah, hi. I-I-I'd like to get some flowers for a girl. No, no. Not flowers. A plant. A living plant. She likes vegetation.
Yeah, that'd be fine. To a Sara Sidle. Deliver it at the CSI division, Las Vegas Police Department the one out on North Trop Boulevard. Yeah, you can bill me at the same place. Gil Grissom.  The sentiment? Oh-oh, on the card. Yeah. Um, uh ... have it say ... have it say, uh ... 'From Grissom.'
Thank you.
Where's the body?
This looks fresh.
Yeah, it's murder.
Two minutes for elbowing. Four minutes for high sticking. Ten minutes, unsportsman-like conduct.
Yeah, sounds like these boys went to a fight and a hockey game broke out.
That's not true-- I've been a baseball fan my whole life.
It's a beautiful game.
Since I met you.
So, we'll start at the opposite goal work our way across the blue line to center ice.
'There are three things in life that people like to stare at. A rippling stream, a fire in a fireplace and a zamboni going round and round.'
We all do.
The thing I love about zambonis is they pick up everything. Hey.
I'm afraid the other part of this tooth might be in there.
Time to combine Foyeer's Law of Conduction with Newton's Law of Cooling.
The heaters max out at 90 degrees, but the variables are constantly changing.
I don't know, 50-cubic-foot melt per hour, if we're lucky?
I was watching ice melt.
Well, organized sports is the paradigmatic model of a just society. Everyone knows the same language everyone knows the rules. And there's a specific punishment handed out the moment someone tries to cheat. Instant morality.
Stockbroker.
Aren't we all?
No? How'd you get to be Chief Medical Examiner? Look, we're all carrying prehistoric genes in a postmodern world. We get our meat from the grocery store instead of with a club or a knife. We have to work off our, uh, testosterone somehow.
Yeah. So, cause of death?
Loss of consciousness.
So did his death cause his fall or did his fall cause his death?
I don't know about that.
So, what's the ratio here?
Well, we still don't know how or why he died.
Well, speaking on a meta-level ... isn't it obvious? The overbearing patriarchal structure of modern organised sports represents a socially palatable sublimation of what Jung refers to as the 'Shadow of the Unconscious.'
We opened up terry's hard drive. It turns out he had your entire roster knee-deep in the stock market.
Ms. Gallagher, your skate had a certain blood spatter on it. It indicates that you're the one that nicked Terry River's carotid artery.
Including your skate intentionally coming down on his neck.
It's evidence. Food poisoning especially anything with spoiled mayonnaise can induce vomiting within 15 minutes. She said last night -- that was 12 hours ago.
And you know this how?
Maybe she didn't know she was pregnant. If she had, would she have gone out on the ice?
Well, if it was Terry Rivers he was definitely deadbeat dad material. Which speaks to motive.
Except you can't safely test for paternity before the baby's born.
Yeah. Say goodbye to Greg.
Well, Jane may play hockey, but her sheets are distinctly female.
What is Victoria's Secret, I wonder?
Sheets may be female, but this toenail belonged to a man.
What about the girl? Is she a temp, too?
You know, I got a list. It's got a negative figure of 12,000 after your name.
Did you ever hear the story of the 19th century chinese goldsmith? He lost a lot of money for his goldsmith buddies due to his shoddy business practices so they decided to kill him by biting him to death. 123 goldsmiths took a bite out of the victim insuring that no one individual could be blamed for the murder. For who would know which one administered the lethal bite.
Well, there's truth in this: Your friend Jane is pregnant.
What kind of coronary anomaly?
I never heard of it.
So, the game had nothing to do with it? It was the heart?
Someone still gets an assist.
... 'Doing it'.
Worried that the father of your child might find out?
Well, according to Doc Robbins he never had malaria.
So Jane Gallagher is officially no longer a suspect.
So who did know?
Which they wouldn't have done if they had known about his heart. They would have played tentatively. Which in hockey is a sacrilege.
How many patients do you have with malaria?
Well ... a man is dead.
Is this Umbria or Tuscany?
But Jane's had a couple of boyfriends since that trip, right? 
Terry was an injury waiting to happen, wasn't he? And when it did, you were there on the bench with two little pills in your hand. 
But Tommy Sconzo is the father.
You killed the wrong guy.
'Wherever you live is your temple, if you treat it like one.'
Buddha.
'Guy in the robe' is a monk, Nick.
Okay. Let's hug the walls.
Gunshot to the head. Times four.
This wasn't a robbery. This was a hit.
Five years ago, West Vegas ... German tourist took a wrong turn, ended up dead. This 'placa' was sprayed across the windshield of their rental car. It's the Snakebacks.
They were praying.
For whoever was shooting them.
May I ask a question? This is a high-crime area. Have you had any problems here before? Like break-ins or burglaries?
True. But sometimes, it leaves its fingerprints on the future.
Well, I do know that the seven chakras correspond to the body's seven energy centers.
Let's go back to the third eye.
If someone were threatened by that consciousness, that would be a logical target, yeah?
Well, we've got ourselves a murder weapon.
And?
One survivor, one suspect. 
Do your teachings allow you to keep pornography?
Got to be a lot easier to be a monk in a monastery on a mountaintop than one on Las Vegas Boulevard.
D.A. Says it's enough for a warrant. Ananda's already in custody.
What about the prints?
He never fired it.
Well, Nevada doesn't require rifle registration. What's my next question?
Bangers tag homicides all the time.
So we're looking at a Warhol.
Well, it's not a real soup can. It's a painting of a soup can.
Except, if you want to be in a gang, you can be.
David, stop calling me 'sir.' What's up with the Air Force?
I'm enlisting.
And the surrounding areas as well, right? This temple is less than two miles from your base. What's the chances your satellite's picked something up?
Cool.
Hey. Glad to see you're not in uniform. Only one vehicle passed through the temple gates around the time of the murders. Parked next to the monk's car.
Registered to a Peter Hutchins.
All photographs were intermittent. None included the driver.
Yep. Would you like to, uh, process the truck?
Thank you.
I heard that, uh, some of the local business owners weren't very happy with the members of the temple.
Your name is ... ?
Uh, which one of you two guys drives the truck outside?
Well, these wouldn't be your prayer beads, would they?
She has a warrant.
Probably not looking for salvation.
Lot of activity in this neighborhood. You're going the wrong way on a one-way. Fender bender on the corner. Some guy running down the middle of the street ...
What about the truck?
Left the truck in the driveway. Junior?
You may be right. Paintball paint.
Well, we know that your father's truck was at the temple at the time of the murders. And our lab identified boot prints and paint residue near the altar.
Water soluble, with flecks of plastic coating like the kind on your clothes. Toss them in the wash, paint's gone.
Well ... see ... 
This boot print says you were.
No. You see, our dust lifter is only effective on very recent prints. I think you were there the day of the murders.
How'd you know to remove your boots? You'd been there before?
I can't give you what I don't have, Greg. All we're going to have is what we get from this gum.
Thank you.
If you see the Buddha on the side of the road, kill him.
Climb in, I'll give you a lift. 
We've cleared the father. The son has also been cleared.
There was a gang placa that was scrawled into the walls of your temple. It was put there to mislead us. The weapon you found on your desk was also put there to mislead us. The only other unexplained evidence we have is the chewing gum. We found traces of curry and saffron.
Sometimes the best evidence we get comes from what people do when they're not thinking. Old habits, routines. I don't think the gum was put there to mislead us. I think it was just a mistake.
It's the real stuff.
And the five of you ate together that night? Any guests?
We're in a temple, O'Riley.
According to the bank, you opened the school fund account on the same day as the murders. Where did you have the money before that?
Curry powder. Your temple employs a part-time cook.
After you caught him with his hand in the till? 
Why didn't you tell us about Mr. Suddahara before?
Yep, his DNA matches the gum sample.
You thought Ananda was going to report you to the police for stealing the money.
And he'd gone to the bank to protect the rest of the money but you didn't know that.
I'm curious about one thing, though. Why did you shoot them all in their sixth chakra?
They do their job and then we do ours.
All right, I want everybody thinking worst case scenario. The highway's finally ours. Cones and pictures, skid marks, ice patches, loose asphalt, anything and everything.
Every Las Vegas CSI is on their way here.
Call them.
Crims with 'field training'.
He does no collection.
Yeah, I heard, but I think I know why the bus pulled to the right.
Newton's third law: 'For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.'
Tire to rim. Rim to axle. Axle to suspension. Suspension to frame. And the lower radius rod arm ... which connects the axle to the frame.
So, if the rod arm broke while he was driving ...
But turning the wheel was probably going to make things worse.
And we're back to Newton. The Theory's correct if the rod arm was the first action.
Well, we're missing a passenger. The only one unaccounted for is an ex-con named Calvin McBride. According to Brass, he wasn't admitted to the hospital and he's not in any of the body bags.
CHP and the Barstow P.D. are looking.
Firefighters only look in the obvious spots.
For bodies? 
Walls, hot water heaters stuffed in the box spring of a hotel room bed.  I found a head in a bucket of paint once.
What do you see?
Greg, bag this, take it to the lab, swab the rim for DNA. 
You should be wearing gloves.
This guy was in 1C.
Where's the other half of this windshield?
I'm afraid our ex-con just got the death penalty.
I need the two front wheels, axle, suspension, all of it. The whole front undercarriage.
Excuse me, miss. This is a crime scene. It's off limits.
Why are you here?
Good, Greg. Did you enjoy being in the field?
What?
No.
Symptoms of which can mirror intoxication.
Loss of consciousness and seizure. Do I pass?
Cause of death?
We're looking at the bus.
Does this look like it's in perfect working order?
What'd you get?
Snapped in half?
Did you do a Rockwell hardness test?
Often when there's one ... there's another one.
Inferior bolts would cause the suspension to give the bus veers off the road. If the sheared bolts were the first action.
Proof?
Broken rod arm, maybe?
Why'd he hit the brakes?
So I ask again -- why'd he hit the brakes?
Well, fortunately, we're just looking for one.
Criminal acts, however, are another matter.
I believe this belongs to you.
The front suspension was riddled with these.
I think maybe it's time for another inspection.
I finally know the first action. What initiated the skid? The right front tire started to come apart. When it blew, it left an indentation in the pavement.
You and me both. The Treads from the right rear tire obscured it. 
So, the driver overcorrects but since there's no more tire, all that force is displaced on the suspension system. The bolt snaps, the rod arm breaks and the bus broadsides the camaro.
I don't know.
Newton's Third ... with a twist.
Yeah, the front right tire was compromised.
It wasn't vandalism. It was an act of premeditation.
Chloroform destroys the elasticity of the rubber. Sooner or later, the air pressure inside the tire causes it to explode.
Well, that's what we're going to find out. We need a treadmill -- a big one.
Exercise a bus. Warrick, tell Larry Maddox it's in his best interest to lend us one of his ... 
... and set it up in the empty police warehouse next door. Sara?
Yeah. Weird, huh? So, where are we?
Or maybe one of them was a target.
What was her skeleton?
And he has access to chloroform.
Still possible. Motive, access, opportunity.
So, who do you like?
Is this the twin?
Did you see that?
Okay. 'Drive,' he said. Just the speed limit.
No, if the tire was tampered with in Barstow it should blow any minute.
Well, I guess it's Barstow.
Well, I wish we had a 'who' but at least we have a 'where.'
Five buses have pulled in in the last ten minutes.
Grissom.
Did you check their maintenance records?
Way to go, Warrick. I owe you.
We got a suspect. Sean Nolan.
Yeah, there was a bus crash up the road. About nine people died.
Julius Caesar, murdered in 44 B.C. Legend has it that the molecules from his last breath spread all over the world. Probably like your fingerprints, right? They're everywhere.
Whoa. Is that a pickle in your pocket or are you just happy to see us?
Second-degree murder.
Yeah, which was mitigated by greed.
Posed?
What do you make of the smears?
Her hair's still wet. You think the assailant surprised her while she was dyeing her hair?
Neighbor lady -- doing the dishes with her window open. Heard the dog yelping, evidently. Called the cops.
So, has anyone seen this dog?
Prisoner in her own home?
A better question -- how'd he get out?
Aluminum foil.
Sorry, Nick. You've been staring at this girl for ten minutes. Do you know her?
Why don't you go do the bedroom? I'll get the coroner in here and finish up in the bathroom.
What'd you get?
Good. Fume it. Tell Sara and Warrick to grab a couple shovels and dig in, too.
Sorry. So, what -- suffocation?
No ligature marks on her neck.
Sexual assault?
So, what's his agenda?
I'll be on my cell.
No becke line.
Hair refracts light under cross polarization but glass doesn't.
Maybe.
You'll figure it out.
How does this relate to the case?
He's a psychic?
Mr. Pearson.
Sit down. Captain Brass tells me that ... uh ... you had some sort of 'vision' regarding Jane Galloway's murder.
What kind of vision?
Anything else?
Okay. Thank you.
This is your eyewitness?
Why didn't you tell us you were staying here?
May I ask what you two were talking about?
But evidently, you called her back.
The front desk records also show that she checked out that night. And you checked out shortly thereafter. Why?
Mr. Pearson, I'm a scientist.
These visions that you've had in the past ... nothing specific triggered them?
Fear?
And you were hoping to heal Jane Galloway?
So, these visions you told us about earlier? These are the only ones you've experienced?
Are these the three locks you saw?
What do you mean?
Is this what you saw?
... from above.
Pick a number between two and five and indicate it with your fingers.
Please humor me.
Four. Thank you.
Look up. Jane's bedroom closet has a door to the attic.
Warrick, Grissom. You know that blond fiber we were looking at?
Not really. I was checking a phone line. But good work.
He tapped into her second line. He's got a peep hole into every room. They're labeled.
Yeah. He's our psychic -- Mr. Pearson.
You know, I don't think this thing was about s*x at all. I think it was about control, voyeurism. Jane was like his, uh, little goldfish.
Night vision goggles.
Probably.
Well, this only opens from the inside. So at some point it's possible that Jane let him in.
Well, pretty much ... if you got a uniform on, you can walk right in the front door.
Thank you, doctor.
You helped out Nick. That was the right thing to do.
Yeah, I wonder why. Let's go back over there.
No, no. You need to calm down a little. Talk to Nick when he wakes up.
Nigel Crane, age 37. No criminal record. Working for Luna Cable for eleven years. No immediate family, lives alone. Last seen by co-workers two days ago. No priors.
He lives up there. Not down here. Works, sleeps changes his clothes ... everything in the attic. He looks down on the world separating himself from others. Fascinating, really.
Red dye.
Dinner and a movie?
How's Nick doing?
Not really, not yet.
Isn't our newsletter for in-house only?
Why would he do that? Why Nick?
Wait a minute we've been doing this the wrong way. We need to see the last tape.
Archie, play this.
Nick, listen, he's been in your house.
Nigel Crane, the Stalker. Brass is one his way with two uniforms to put at your door.
What?
Good, keep him there.
I don't think it was about you, Nick. Or Jane Galloway, for that matter. I think it was more about Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. His premise is that social beings strive to belong. In Nigel's mind, Jane Galloway was someone he could control which was okay for a while but you ... you were someone he could actually become. See, Maslow's Fifth Tier of the Hierarchy is Self-Actualization.
Yeah.
There's only one interpretation for this: 'Kill the pig.'
His wife and daughter are missing. His silver Cadillac DTS is also missing. We're looking for any signs of forced entry in the house, any signs of ransack that's not associated with the party.
So he probably fought back.
Nine millimeter standard issue.
Why didn't she plan better? Pack the kid's clothes.
The nanny told me that she only took one shirt -- one the kid wouldn't even wear.
You saw Chief Rittle leave?
Grissom.
Brass found the Chief's Cadillac.
Who found it?
'Chief Rittle'?
I don't know. But if he has gunpowder residue on him, could be our shooter. 
In Florida?
Well, if it is our little girl, she's got evidence on her from two Vegas homicides. 
One of us should be down there to process.
Take Warrick. I don't think he's ever been to Florida.
So, I guess he didn't shoot Rittle.
His lower back? I thought he was shot twice in the head.
That's rare.
Pinball.
I'll call Catherine. Thanks.
Well, a very important police officer was murdered there.
Anybody who wasn't in 'the circle'?
Well, that's 120 hours. There must be something you know about him that you could share with us.
Cheap? How?
Are you sure it was cologne?
Would you happen to have an article of clothing of his by any chance?
Hey, guess what? This isn't about you. This is about a missing seven-year-old girl.
Body odor, bad breath ...
I don't know. There's something about Adam Van Der Welk that makes him smell.
'Sickly sweet.' 
Smells can be like fingerprints, my dear. Hey, what's going on there?
Maple, elm, ash, what?
This is how I work.
I'm following my nosino.
Doesn't that give you a rash that smells like human excrement we're looking for something a little sweeter.
I think I overlooked some evidence.
Smell this.
In the five days that you two were together, did you happen to notice what he was drinking?
Did he ever drink anything sweeter like whiskey or cognac?
Diabetic ketoacidosis - 
it's an insulin deficiency. His body's been expelling excess glucose. Makes him smell fruity.
Well, blood's the best but if you had a urine sample, maybe.
Novalin insulin.
Hey.
Nice tan.
Yeah, well, I knew you were coming back today, so I dressed up.
Really. 
What?
I had to go to the Chief's funeral.
Man versus Gravity. 
Man lost.
What do you think?
Dispatch called. The body's on county property.
Then why are you here, Sheriff?
Suicide, huh? I don't know, Brian. On the day you decide to end your life, why would you go to work?
You look like the Sheriff, but you talk like the Mayor. Mr. Harris, you get an extra bonus for early completion? 
Wow, $200,000. You must work your guys pretty hard, huh?
Where exactly was Valenti's work station?
Terminal velocity's 9.8 meters per second, squared. He would've hit the ground at under five seconds.
Did this belong to Mr. Valenti
This drill is shorted out. Do you think he 'jumped' before or after he got the shock of his life?
Big words meaning you won't get electrocuted.
But if the third prong of the plug is compromised, the interrupter won't work. Will it, Bob? 
These prongs don't usually snap off by themselves.
Are all your workers this careless with their tools?
These cutters may have been used to tamper with the grounding prong.
When your crime scene is twelve stories up ... I don't want to take any chances. I'm going to lock in these prints.
Bones of the inner ear: Malleus, Incus, Stapes. High cellular density, completely protected by the skull. Why?
I want to see the entry and exit wounds.
He fell after he was electrocuted.
Faulty drill. There should be burn marks on one of his palms.
Right. creating a fern-like pattern on the chest.
I don't care what the body says, this guy was electrocuted. It was not an accident.
What?
Signs of charring or melting. You've done this before.
Every now and then, we have to break the rules. Start with a conclusion and work our way backwards.
Like, for instance ... in the 1800s, when surgery was Russian roulette and patients were dying on the tables.
Until Louis Pasteur theorized that something we could not see, microscopic organisms were attacking the patients.
Bodies tell a story because we interpret them the way our predecessors taught us to. Just because we don't see something we're supposed to see doesn't mean that it's not there.
Wires were crossed.  Polarity's been reversed. This confirms that someone tampered with Valenti's drill.
Rubber's an insulator, but metal's a conductor. What form of metal hides in plain view at a construction site?
Sounds like you got a match.
Yeah. Especially if you bet against me.
You're the project manager but you don't actually use all the tools, right?
Sure. After the lab processes all the evidence.
Excuse me.
Who does?
Motive?
Ah, we're in a bowling league together.
Sure. Someone tampered with Roger Valenti's drill. And I have only one suspect. 
That's why they call it a prelim. Mr. Harris, were you opposed to Roger Valenti's union activities?
Yes.
Call Jim Brass at homicide.
Why are you telling me this?
I need to see the body again.
Final report?
Doc, please?
So, what have you got? I mean, anything unusual, even the mundane.
Troponin levels become elevated following ventricular fibrillation which could be caused by electrocution, right?
Work with me, will you?
Life-threatening?
What else?
Postmortem deoxygenation.
Tell me about his testicles.
Thanks, doc.
What're you guys doing?
A new case?
You didn't hear that from me, did you?
Greg ... I hope that's not the crossword puzzle.
What about the nail that we pulled out of Valenti's boot? Dusted?
Process the nail, please. And if you get a print ... 
Yes. Metal cutters. I need you to prove or disprove whether they were used to sever the drill's grounding prong.
And you're with me.
Mr. Gesek!
You're conducting ...
... Vivaldi, Four Seasons.
Have you prepped him yet?
Yeah, I know, Venice. I need to see his testicles.
I'll put you on the list. 
Testicular atrophy. They're the size of peas. 
Hemochromatosis. Valenti had elevated levels of iron in his blood. Yellow pallor, shrunken testicles ... I think he's been ingesting trace amounts of iron over a long period of time.
No. Iron molecules take a long time to build up. Could have been his diet repeated blood transfusions, excessive smoking possibly hereditary abnormalities.
One step closer. Mr. Gesek? Stick a syringe in his carotid all the way to his clavicle.
One pint, to go.
Thank you.
Well, iron is a conductive mineral. I want to know if there was enough iron in Valenti's blood to conduct electricity.
Yeah, well ... we'll see. Plug in the blood.
Hey, is that from the deli?
No. Can I have your pickle?
Oh, that's a nice one.
I'm electrocuting it.
This is how I cooked my hot dogs in college.
Check out the burn marks.
Pickles are high in sodium content.
Normally, the flow of electricity through a body generates heat.
Burn marks are the physical evidence of that heat. But ... if the body offers no resistance to the flow of electricity-no heat, no burn marks.
No burn marks, but he was still electrocuted.
They were not on the nail. You see, I think that someone stuck a nail in the victim's boot and it evidently wasn't Bob Harris.
Obviously, that wasn't my intent.
What are you talking about? What newspaper article?
I'm not making an apology.
You get my message?
Ian Wolf, Union of Electrical Workers, Local 37. He wanted to make sure that I stayed on Harris for the murder of Roger Valenti.
I told him to talk to you.
What?
Just like any other case.
Despite your efforts to make it seem that way.
Let's not make the same mistake twice.
Where's Mandy?
What if I narrowed the scope? To one.
Ian Wolf. Like the animal not the authors.
Warrick's on it. I got a warrant for his tool belt -- metal cutters included.
Overlap to one.
Not for an electrician I'm going to find Brass.
Yeah, you did.
They're just part of the story.
You spiked Roger's boot with the nail -- compromised the insulation. 
You reversed the polarity in his drill. 
You cut the grounding prong, planted evidence. And killed a man.
Sheriff.
Yeah, how about that? Just in time for my big 'public apology'.
Good, I leave that to you.
Strange, people usually aren't scared of class clowns.
Shot him in the back.
Yeah. We're looking for a coward.
Hand me a bindle.
Brass ...
Yeah. A little.
Yeah, it better. We have a point of reference.
Give me a hand, will you? 
.44. Here, take this. 
Orange, by my kit. It was in his backpack.
Did you get something? 
They do have a timeless quality. 
I was a ghost.
Here.
Shooter was standing right there. 
And ... ? 
Is that a Polymer Sensor Proboscis? 
Electronic noses run like ten grand.
If that thing ran out of here and bit the shooter in the ass, the county would not approve a $10,000 purchase order.
Our job is to think, Warrick. Machinery should never matter more than our mind. Try this ... 
Glass tube. Air pump ... 
Fresh out. Improvise.
Can you arrange for us to meet with Dennis?
Well, then, this will be brief.
You coming?
How tall are you, Dennis?
Have you washed your hands in the last hour?
Changed your shirt?
I'd like to do a test on your shirt if I may.
Forensic.
G.S.R. When someone fires a weapon, gunshot residue plumes back onto their hands and clothing. 
This means that you fired a gun within the last three to six hours.
The police are going to want to talk to you.
Did you ever rent a .44 caliber?
Jim.
Let me guess. Decomp in an enclosed space?
Lemons.
Use lemons.
The heart? That makes no sense.
But not with a knife, it looks like prongs.
Where was his heart?
Dextrocardia? Like Dr. No? That only presents in .01% of the population?
How long ago did you say he was stabbed?
No.
I did; they had no idea he'd been stabbed.
They talk to you, though, right? The guidance counselor? Who else may have had it in for Barry Schickel?
Really?
With a fork? Stabbed him above his left pectoral.
Where were you last night about 6:00?
Okay. Thanks.
No one's blaming you.
You know who did this, don't you? 
Yeah. But where does that leave Barry Schickel?
I trust you.
What doesn't belong?
Put him there, how?
No, no. I'm going stay here ... with this, close to Warrick.
You still got that $10,000 e-nose you were using?
I just want the software.
You grabbed a top note of 'floral' and now we ask the software to break it into ingredients. Do you recognize any of these?
Some of these perfumes have, like, 750 ingredients.
'Chanteuse.'
Yeah, the original application for this program was perfume companies. You know, testing new brands stealing from the competition.
Grissom.
Let me guess. Denny Fram's sister?
Vapor molecules. See if you can get a warrant for her perfume and have Brass bring her in.
We isolated a combination in the restroom where Barry Schickel was shot. It matches your perfume.
Might be true. Scent triggers memory more acutely than any of the five senses.
You said that you went back to the high school that night after target practice.
Excuse us.
Who's Jeremy Spencer?
Do you ever smell a fart and end up blaming the wrong guy? 
Why do you think your sister shot Barry?
Because why?
She asked Barry's coach to help you. That was her protection plan. She was nowhere near the high school that night.
No. You smelled her brand of perfume.
We recovered this from your townhouse on a warrant. Chanteuse. 
We also found the gun. It hasn't been cleaned.
You know how to shoot one.
Or eleven.  Captain Brass ran a search on you. Tetrick High School, Tetrick, Arizona. Eleven kids shot a few days after Columbine. You were the Assistant Principal.
It says that you were left with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. You might want to mention that to your lawyer.
You know, Miss Barrett as difficult as high school can be for kids, eventually, it's over ... but too soon for Barry Schickel.
For all we know, this is animal blood.
A deer hunter comes home from the mountains drunk decides to play butcher clean his kill. Chops his game up into oven-sized pieces for the winter. I mean, what does he care? He's renting.
And a human has only eight pints of blood. So, whoever the victim is ... is now dead.
Well, by and large, the average diameter is about one millimeter.
Just acquaint yourself, Sara. Don't interpret just yet, okay?
Couch? We've only got 30 seconds till this luminol disappears.
Television, maybe? A magazine?
What do you think that is?
High-velocity, small spray.
Did you notice if Mr. Renteria left a forwarding address?
Hopefully not. That's all the evidence we have.
Gee, Brass, all in one shift. I'm impressed.
We just came from your old apartment. We found some disturbing evidence there. Would you care to explain that?
Mr. Renteria, your apartment walls are covered in human blood. Are you aware of that?
Do you have an explanation?
Your blood?
You expirated blood from your nose all over your apartment walls to get back at your manager?
He's lying. Expirating from your nose would leave oval-shaped blood patterns. The ones we found in his apartment were V-shaped.
Well, may we see your furniture?
Electric saw.
Interesting lamp. 
Mr. Renteria, with your permission, I'd like to move some of your property to my lab for a closer inspection.
So?
This cannot be right.
What about the blood on the lamp?
Well, get through it. 
I also thought the metric system would catch on. Look, everything that starts with a faulty premise is bound to fail. I saw 'V' patterns and I foolishly ruled out the nose.
Hepatitis C destroys the liver and a whole host of clotting functions. Cliff, indeed, has blood to spare.
Mr. Renteria, I can't sign off on a case until I fully understand it. So, let me get this straight. You had a beef with your landlord and you decided to pay him back by blowing blood out of your nose all over the apartment walls. Is that about right?
A day? A week? A couple of months? How long did this take?
So, you get up in the morning, make coffee and go 'I think I'll blow some blood on the kitchen wall today.' Get out of the shower grab your towel, go 'Hey, this looks like a nice spot to expirate a couple of pints.'
So, you made your statement through your nose?
Yeah, well ... as it turns out our guy stands very close to the wall and blows almost sideways.
Right through his Jimmy Durante. Ambidextrous, both nostrils.
Two things which may have nothing to do with each other.
Same thing we're always looking for evidence of a crime. Failing that, we'll have to release this apartment.
I don't see any evidence of that.
No.
How many flies do you count in this room?
I counted four on my first walk-through.
Fresh. Problem is flies don't feast on dry blood.
So they're feeding on fresh blood. Could be a rodent, though, or bad garbage.
The preponderance of flies is in this room. 
Either Paul or John. 
The most important. The Silphid Beetle typically feeds on decomposing human flesh.
Mr. Evans ... could you get permission from the owner to let us break into these walls? Our original warrant didn't cover that.
We can't divulge that but it may be ... all the walls.
Yeah.
We don't do that.
DNA lab. I don't want to hear any rumors that Paul is dead. He may be the only chance we have of getting in these walls.
Yeah.
Is this definitive?
The beetle was full of human DNA. Brass got us a judge.
You left him?
Miss Scott, we found some blood on one of Cliff's lamps.
Would you be amenable to providing us with a sample of your blood for comparison purposes?
Yeah, I still want a sample. Warrick, would you?
You never get a second chance to make a first impression.
Right. Think outside the box.
We need to take a look at your wall.
Scented candles, huh?
You wouldn't mind if I, uh ... examined your vent, would you?
Did you know that your apartment shares heating ducts with the apartment next door?
Sara?
And Dermestidae Masculatus.
You can tell us where the body is or we can, uh ... tear your place apart piece by piece. Whichever. 
Let's open it up.
I don't know. I don't mind being wrong. I just don't think I am this time. Okay ... start on the floorboards. I'm going outside.
Ninety-five.
Normally my pulse is seventy. When it gets to 95, I realize how mad I am. I-I have ten people working around the clock on this thing.
No, no. I'm not mad at me. There's a body in there and that guy knows where it is!
No.
I'm fine.
Oh.
Hey, Brass. When did The Shnoz say he lost his hot water?
You, uh, have no pressure for your hot water.
Well, you know, my Uncle Herb was a plumber. I might be able to help. Where's your installation?
You got an electrician coming, too? 
A filtration system. It softens the water.
Yeah, well, I'm non-union.
There's no disruption to the cold water line. Hot water line ... water runs through the filtration tanks first and the water heater second, right?
Why is it bypassed? You've cut off the water to the filtration tanks. 
Brine tanks are usually hollow. Only got about eight inches of water at the bottom for the salt mixture.
Does that sound hollow to you?
She nagged you?
No, thanks.
I'm having breakfast with a friend of mine.
He did.
Call said one dead body.
You have anything to say? 
You don't have to talk to us.
He'll talk to us.
Body's been moved from the murder scene. Impound his car.
Let's process this guy shall we? Officer, would you uncuff him, please?!
Hold still. 
Possible secondary transfer ...
No defensive wounds. No hematomas.
Matthew ... tag that body for special processing, VIP room. Don't wash it till I get there, and don't touch his fingernails.
But what kind? All-purpose? Self-rising? Pastry?
What about the neck? Any fibers in the wound?
Well, that hasn't stopped you yet.
Be my guest.
Dress shirt ... but no tie.
Find me on the flour.
You get all that from his ... uh ... dentals?
.380s?
That's not what killed him, is it? We pulled a yellow fiber out of the neck wound. I think it's from his tie.
Why would a guy shoot a man three times and then strangle him with his own tie?
So, why did you rule out bakeries?
Are you employed, Ben?
You make pizzas?
Do you, uh ... ever come into contact with the baking flour at Dante's?
Well, 'cause we found flour on the victim and it's the kind that's used to make pizza. Can you explain that?
Ben, why don't you earn yourself some points by telling me what the science is going to tell me anyway?
No ... but we're going to figure it out.
Murders? There are more bodies?
Hold up.
Isolate it.
Any more bodies you want to tell me about?
We're going to radar this whole hillside.
Sometimes ... when I leave a crime scene where I've been particularly involved with a dead body, I sit in my car and it hits me -- how close I was ... how heavy the body is ... the texture of the body ... how it feels... you know?
You're not a bad person?
Then, what are you?
Father?
Of this crime scene.
Yeah, I imagine he does.
It's the 11th hour. I wouldn't expect anything less.
When the reality of their actions set in, they usually turn to religion.
Okay, hold it. That's enough. Let's dust him.
See if this laceration on this guy's forehead is consistent with the kid's shovel.
Well, it obviously wasn't a robbery.
They didn't happen to find another car there, did they?
I don't see your, uh ... visitor's badge.
What makes you think, uh ... I was ever a catholic?
This is his car. You know, you really shouldn't be here.
Is that a problem?
This luminol reveals dried blood.
I believe the car.
Good work, you guys. Very good. But you haven't proved murder. You've proved burial.
From burying them.
He transported them. Show me the gun with Ben's prints on it. Gun shot residue, the ligature, the ... 
Yes. Empirical evidence. St. Thomas was ahead of us all.
No. It has to do with the evidence.
Okay. Ship it. Show it to the D.A.
I looked deeper into the evidence. I should have looked deeper into Ben's character.
Tell me about your brother. We know that you only buried the bodies. So, what happened? Did he threaten you?
Ben?
Did you learn to throw pizzas in prison, Roger?
You did it directly after work using a .380 pistol and then you strangled one of the victims with his own tie. 
Did you witness this?
The perpetrator's hands left flour on the victim's face. This is not from a gunshot. This was something a little more intimate.
When a person changes his mode of murder from pistol to ligature it's for one of two reasons - entertainment ... or necessity. Which was it for you?
The flour said you did.
Possibly.
So, he altered the barrel somehow.
Unfortunately, we've had this discussion before.
The bullet jammed in the feed, didn't it?
So, it was necessity.
About?
There isn't one piece of evidence that says that kid was even present at the murders.
Well, how convenient. The older brother brings it in explaining why his epithelials are all over the murder weapon.
He set up his brother.
He's a good kid, Robin. He hero-worships his brother, but he's a good kid.
Explain how bits of your skin got on the ligature used to strangle that victim.
Your brother brought this in to the district attorney.
Unless you can tell us how your epithelials got on that tie.
Do you have any physical evidence linking your brother to the murders? Anything?
I know that we've arrested the wrong brother.
He came to see you as soon as Ben was in custody.
We both have jobs that begin after the crime. 
Some people would call that a career in futility.
A hundred years ago we didn't have the technology for fingerprints. Fifteen years ago, we didn't have DNA. Hopefully one day, we'll have foolproof means by which to put the right man in jail in this case.
Thank you ... but ...  ... no.
In religion? I believe in God, in science ... in Sunday supper. I don't believe in rules that tell me how I should live.
How many crusades were fought in the name of God? How many people died because of someone's religion?
Semantics. They're still dead. I'm sorry about Ben, father.
That guilt's not in me anymore.
Hey.
Spa safety?
So what am I supposed to say?
CSI supports Las Vegas.
Oh, no, no, no. How did this happen?!
There's no sign of struggle. Whatever happened, happened somewhere else. This is a secondary scene.
Textbook. David, when we dig her up, I want you to tag her special processing. 
The only person who knows where the crime scene is has her mouthful of sand.
He didn't put it here to hide it. He put it here to be found.
What do you think?
To get to the evidence, we may destroy the evidence.
Every time you find a body, you have to choose a path and when you take that path, Grasshopper, you risk destroying the evidence.
So what are we looking at? Rape, multiple sexual assaults?
Here's a woman who's been beaten on a regular basis but look at the care she's lavished on herself. 
Manicured fingernails, manicured toenails. Perfect teeth, hair.
Are you sure the surgeon said this is where Mona Taylor worked?
The eternal question to which we're about to find the answer.
You don't seem very upset about it.
We need names and addresses. We also need to know which rooms she worked last night so we can examine them.
Okay, tow it to CSI and then start processing the rooms in the pool house where Mona worked last night.
I'll be with Lady Heather.
Yes. I find all deviant behavior fascinating in that to understand our human nature we have to understand our aberrations.
I would say that whip marks and ligature contusions on a young woman are aberrant. Wouldn't you?
Mona did. She died.
Like the theatre.
Oh, I have outlets. I read. I study bugs. I sometimes even ride roller coasters.
It doesn't involve going to the theater.
'No man is a complete mystery except to himself.' Marcel Proust.
Probably. No crime is a complete mystery, either. The whip marks on Mona Taylor were fresh.
My guess is that one of her off-the-book clients ... is a regular. I mean, it is a repeat business, is it not?
Yes, it does. May I borrow it?
I considered it.
Like a straw?
Well, it's not a s*x club, actually. It's a fetish club.
Like a straw is not used for sipping mint juleps.
Air.
Mona was a Dominatrix at the fetish club. But my guess is that she was a switch for her off-the-books clients.
Someone who's dominant as well as submissive.
If Mona's DNA is in one of these masks, then she was the submissive on the night she died.
Yes, I do, Greg. I also need to know which straw she used.
And even less if someone's fingers are on the other end.
Our killer. Now we just need a suspect.
You got the yin. I've got the yang.
Thank you. Now we'll see how yours turns out.
You know any fine jewelers?
Thanks for your help.
If the dad didn't buy the watch then the mom did. Brass has the credit card receipt.
Gustav Stickley. Very nice furniture. No pictures of your family though.
Most people keep pictures of their loved ones in their office.
Do we need one?
Okay. How about this? Are you familiar with the gal who calls herself Lady Heather?
Well, one of the girls who works for Lady Heather was found dead with an imprint of your watch on her wrist. That's why we'd like a sample of your DNA.
We did. We also got a warrant.
Is the watch in the box? 
Afternoon tea. How nice. 
Well, I'm a little needy myself today. My lab pulled skin cells from Mona Taylor's straws.
They're male.
Have you ever seen either of these two people?
I didn't say they were married. 
You're very good. You could work for me.
You never know. We both might learn something.
You like fine things.
I'm that obvious, huh?
Which is?
Lady Heather, you're an anthropologist.
'Grains of golden sand.'
Edgar Allan Poe. Another man who was familiar with murder.
Liquid latex.
Your husband made Mona Taylor wear it every time that he paid to humiliate her.
He made her into nothing in order to make her into you.
I guess that made it more real.
Mrs. Nelson, we're going to match Cameron's epithelials to the ones on the end of the straw.
We do?
Good. He'd probably like it.
Okay. I never told anybody this, Catherine ...
And the body count?
Cash on wheels.
Small time crooks, Jim.
Yeah? That's a mere pittance to a Vegas casino. Cashiers alone are sitting on a million and change.
Dangerous, yes. Ladies ...
... no.
My bet was that that was the practice run.
Actually, it was. Gives us a starting point.
The falling chandelier distracts the guards. Makes them easy targets.
The armed robbers load up, head for the exits.
Chaos moving in one direction, the money moving in the other.
A Harvard Professor conducted an experiment. Asked a bunch of students to watch a basketball game -- count the number of times the ball was passed. 
During the game a person dressed in a gorilla suit ran across the court. Afterwards, the professor asked his students if they noticed the gorilla. Fifty percent responded, 'What gorilla?'
Extraction is an art, Albert.
Caliber?
The guards were armed with nine millimeters and they weren't hollow point. So ... he was shot in the back by one of his own partners?
You want to see me?
This is the video surveillance from that heist. This camera was trained on their entrance.
All the disguises in the world and they dress like women.
Well, Blue's the decedent I.D.'d as Adam Brower ... so enlarge red.
That must be the one that killed Brower. .45 in the back at close range. 
Photoshop black.
Dressed as a woman among men dressed as women. Now, see? That's a disguise.
If you're going to badger me about your crime scene location, put it in a memo.
I always remember the ones that get away.
And this is a special bullet?
And the substance is special?
This bullet is from my investigation.
Tammy Felton?
Three armed robbers. Adam Brower-- killed at the scene Tammy Felton ... we're still one suspect short.
So Tammy kills dad ... and she and Darin Hanson run off together. 
Let me see, Bobby.
Bullets confirm the story told by the potato.
Three suspects. Adam Brower, deceased. Tammy Felton, Darin Hanson, still at large.
Well, if that's the getaway car there would have been a secondary vehicle parked nearby.
Shall we?
No damage. This car was barely moving. 
I thought you guys were processing the car?
It's used to make glass. It's mined in open pits. Why?
There's an abandoned silica mine outside calnevari.
Come here.
Get your guns out.
Say hello to Darin Hanson. 
And ... we're out of suspects.
Three armed robbers hold up the casino. Tammy's in black, Adam was the one in blue and that leaves us Darin.
The surveillance video tells us that Darin was the only one in position to shoot Adam.
And we still don't know why Darin and Tammy took out the convenience store clerk.
Well done, Warrick. You found our mole.
Yeah. I'll call Brass. He can make the arrest.
Yeah. All murdered.
Except all we got is a gun in drag.
The clerk from the convenience store.
But the pit boss said it was Darin plus three.
Well, maybe he didn't know that the clerk wasn't there. He wasn't counting wigs. He was hiding under a blackjack table.
But you've been there haven't you?
Jim, hit the overhead, will you?
Silica is a crystal. It reflects the light. Even trace amounts will show up.  Huh. How about that?
Was it worth it?
Yeah, well, he had his price.
Well, we're going to need to process him.
Looks like the elbow got stuck in the blade.
Yup, the ulna.
Possibly why whoever did this didn't finish the job.
I'm going to need a hand.
The last remains of John Doe. We're going to need sifters.
We're going to have to dismantle this piece by piece.
I'll get a foreman.
You know about meat grinders?
Found an ear plug. 
Ear wax is ripe with DNA.
This one's different than the ones they use. Whoever wore this brought it with them. We just have to find out whose ear it fits.
What do you make of the, uh scar tissue on the palm?
Looks like it's blistered.
I'll send this sample to trace.
Tips of the fingers look like they're worn to the bone.
Much more than that. Lansberry's Ridge Builder. One application to the bulbs of the fingers and the ridges plump out temporarily like a chia pet on steroids.
Petrov Samsko. Non-gaming sheriff's permit, head chef, Debreff Restaurant.
Chef-- that would explain the burn scar tissue on his palm.
Good, maybe you can get us a table.
We don't have reservations. W-we're here...
Not just dead. Dismembered. 
We're with the crime lab.
Hey, Cath?  Blood spatter.
Gil Grissom. I'm with her.
Who's, uh, Stephanie?
Oh, I understand how chefs cut their fingers and how the kitchen help could have blood spatter on their uniforms, but how does a waitress get blood on the back of her shirt?
Okay, this 'rush' is taking entirely too long.
Looks like a v-pattern to me. What do you think?
Burn area seems too big for a candle.
Mr. Dutton, uh, can I ask you what happened here?
Ah, excuse me. Stephanie?
Is this your uniform?
I thought you said the mafia left town.
Ross Halpo -- sous chef.
Lola Creighton -- saucier.
You want to tell us how the blood got here?
Okay. That still doesn't explain how the blood got on the uniforms.
Haven't these people ever heard of HIV?
Alert all your employees. We're going to take over your kitchen, starting now.
Presence of blood on the drain.
Looks like it. What would sand be doing in a kitchen?
This was not a little knife knick. This guy was stuck. I mean, uh, he bled out long enough for his blood to pool and clot.
Excuse me.  Starting with yours.
I thought there was a policy against the use of these in Las Vegas restaurants.
You know, those v-marks that we found in the restaurant -- those were made fairly recently. Certainly ... since the '70s.
According to your owner's log, ...  Danny Pasqualle, Italian male model suffered third-degree burns on his face the night of September 26, 2002.
Did he ever file formal charges against you?
No charges will be filed, Mr. Pasqualle if ... you'd be willing to fill out a statement to that effect.
The wound on your hand, Mr. Pasqualle? Patterned abrasions over the dorsal of the hand at the metacarpal phalangeal joints.
Human mouths are full of bacteria. A wound from a human bite is a tremendous source of infection, unfortunately.
You don't have to say anything, Mr. Pasqualle.
We just need your hand.
I knew that, Greg.
That would impress me.
I guess he settled out of court.
Thanks, Greg.
You can see why I might have a hard time believing you, right?
Excuse me.
He's denying murder.
Hey, do you guys serve mutton?
Mutton. It's from the french word for sheep. These fibers look like wool and since sheep are sheered before they're butchered I think that somebody was cooking something here, and it wasn't food.
That's heavy?
We're talking about clothes?
Okay, good. Thanks.
Did we get a DNA test?
You're the new guy.
Come here. Do you hear this?
I don't know. But I've learned that the evidence room is the quietest place in the lab.
Did you know that to a geologist there's no such thing as sand? Each grain is its own tiny rock. Fine, glassy crystals ...  ... dark. Obsidian, I bet.
Japanese call it singing sand. If you walk on certain beaches in Japan it'll make a musical sound.
Well.  'Let us carve him as a dish fit for the gods.'
Julius Caesar.
That's your knife.
This is the owner's log.
'The sous chef gets 89% of the meat off of trout filet -- six percent better than any chef on the line.' 
I don't think you killed the chef.  You did fillet him, though.
Your knife handle slid open...
...sand went down the drain landing on the victim's clotted blood.
It's hard work, carving up a man. I believe that's how you broke your knife handle.
But you didn't do this alone, did you?
Well, he's not denying anything. He's not admitting anything, either.
Such as?
Why did you kill him?
What does that mean?
Officer, would you take her to booking, please?
Yeah.
You up for dinner?
Well, someone's missing a contact lens.
You know, ravens, like eagles, have been known to travel 30 miles from roost to feeding ground.
'Once upon a midnight dreary while I pondered weak and weary over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore.'
'Quoth the raven, 'only this ... and nothing more.''
You'll be pleased to know the eyeball was only slightly desiccated.
Still blue.
Yeah, I sent some vitreous fluid to tox. The rest to DNA. So ... Can you get me an eye for an eye?
Feathers. For warmth.
Well, the only place we'd have seagulls around here would be Lake Mead.
Not found at Lake Mead.  You know, ravens are incredibly intelligent. They have a brain capacity comparable to dolphins.
... we're flying blind.
David.
A 35-year-old male. Car salesman. Dropped dead at work. Apparent heart attack. Not under the care of a physician. Uh, no history of high blood pressure. Just routine autopsy.
Go for it.
Yeah, our little miracle worker.
Well, that would explain the discoloration Robbins found around his mouth.
Yeah, real Ricky Roma.
We have a warrant to search your premises.
For evidence concerning the attempted murder of Fred Stearns.
No, he didn't ... and he's not.
Thank you.
Oral fixation you think? Constant need for gratification?
Depreciation doesn't make it a logical investment.
We're not buying, we're looking. If we need any help we'll let you know.
You always, uh, lock your drawers?
Huh.
You're the one who super-glued Fred's phone.
'Chewing gum: Will turn any mouth black for days.'
I get it. You're the funny guy.
Do you know the definition of attempted murder, Mr Hinton?
Go with you where?
Fate, or destiny. It's from the arabic word meaning to distribute, or divide up.
Dead guy. Not funny.
Tox screen ruled out the ink gum.
I don't care about his indigestion, Doc. We need to know what killed him.
Possibly reptilian skin?
Tox report. The organic poison came back snake venom. I think maybe it's time to open a relationship with Marty Gibson.
We found reptile skin on your jacket sleeve. So, unless you're shedding, we want to know how it got there.
No, thank you. 
No doughnuts.
Marty, what'd you do with the mice?
No. We were leaning towards murder.
Yeah, that's what we're afraid of.
Only, our victim didn't have any puncture wounds.
And brought the venom with him to the dealership.
Well, the trace lab found venom proteins in his coffee cup. Could that have killed him?
Because typically, the stomach acids would kill the venom before it reached the bloodstream, but if you had an ulcer...
No.
Well, the Elisa test came back positive for alpha-neurotoxins.
Which would send the body into complete and total paralysis, right?
Explaining why the victim ended up in the morgue the first time.
A coincidence is a scientific anomaly. Maybe he just got rid of the snake.
Marty Gibson.
What else did you do for Marty?
Did you get him coffee?
Now you do?
'The Goodwill Guy?'
Well, sometimes access is all you need.
Sylla-what?
Right. So, you're the snake guy. You're also the goodwill guy who gets the coffee. So, when someone is poisoned with snake venom in their coffee, 'a' plus 'b' equals you.
So you kill him?
I guess it's just too bad he had an ulcer.
Didn't you grow up in this neighborhood?
Drive-by. His girlfriend see anything?
You going to be able to handle this?
Well, we're obviously looking for an automatic.
The bullets went through the glass, shed their jackets or disintegrated completely on impact with the wall.
All we have left are lead cores, which are of no comparison value.
The only bullet that may help us is inside that little girl.
Well, it went through a bookcase. Nine millimeter.
Thanks.
You're sure. 
We only found a small amount of GSR on his hands. Could have been transfer from just picking up the murder weapon.
Well, either he's buying in bulk, or that stuff's hot.
I'm afraid the only bullets in here are silver bullets.
You got any paint transfer?
Call auto detail. We'll tow it back to the lab.
Jaycobs has an alibi.
Meet me in PD.
Mr. Phelps, it's good to see you again, sir.  Would you excuse us a moment? Warrick.
What's he doing here?
This was not a good idea.
David Artiss. Says he was with our suspect the night of the drive-by. Says he dropped him off at PJ's tavern right before we picked him up. Says he also saw him find the mac.
What is this?
Well, if this is evidence, it needs to be tagged and catalogued.
Can you prove that?
The job, Warrick, is to process evidence. Objectively, and without prejudice.
You know what? You're not working on this case anymore. I'll have another assignment for you tomorrow.
Where were we?
Go back to work.
What's going on, fellas?
Stovepipe. Possibly jammed in our murder weapon. Never fired, never exposed to the heat.
Yes.
I don't jump to conclusions.
Well, you may get a chance.  Your new assignment. Check out the pattern in the center of this contusion. It's probative.
Blue paint transfer. Possibly from your mailbox? I found a jammed nine millimeter cartridge in the backyard of a house a few doors down from where Jaycobs said he found the gun. Backyard of a house that had been broken into. You said he was a thief, right?
See, I think he lied about where he found the gun so we wouldn't know he was breaking into houses. Apart from that, I think he was telling the truth.
Shall we?
Greg. How many licks does it take to get to the center of a tootsie pop?
All play and no work make Greg an unemployed boy.
That would be me.
We found your saliva on this lollipop stick in Mr. Phelps's van, and we found your thumbprint on this bullet.
The van wasn't hot-wired, so I think you knew where Mr. Phelps kept his keys.
So Jason Gilbert was just collateral damage.
Yeah. But you're not the one who's paying for it.
Dispatch said breaking and entering and sexual assault?
What do you mean, 'blocked'?
Yeah ... except somebody was watching this girl.
He's been watching a lot of people.
You have evidence?
I went back to the crime stats ... pulled up all the reported peeping toms in a two-block radius over the last year.
He had 'raccoon eyes.' And that's about it. Plus, nobody called in any follow-up reports.
And I'm afraid our 'Tom' is on an escalated pace. Tonight was his first breaking and entering with an immediate second B&amp;E plus what appears to be his first sexual assault.
Yeah ... we better find him.
But they're in the predator's comfort zone which means he probably lives in the area, too. What else?
Blow dry it. It'll give us approximate height and shoe size.
All right, let's keep after it. This guy won't stop till he's caught.
Hey. So the owner of the pool company says he spends his lunch hour here every day.
Architecture. He has a 'Type'. All these buildings that recently reported peeping toms? Got floor plans from the management company. A-- second story, three bedroom. B-- ground floor, two bedrooms, center lots. C ... C-plans are all one bedroom on the end. Cheapest rent, highest foot traffic easiest to break in.
Yeah. And every apartment has sliding doors and windows. Not one sash, not one french.
You found his epicenter?
Predators usually widen their comfort zone in a spiral pattern outward.
My god, look at all the C-level apartments. P.D.'S going to have to triple their presence. 
He hit two apartments in one night. He's become compulsive.
Yeah, he's evolving ... perfecting ...
AV lab. Grissom.
Would you be exact, please?
Thank you.
You can handle it.
You look better on-camera.
De-escalating. I had figured Taylor Reed was branching out, widening his circle, but after last night, I think he's pulling in, going back to his original comfort zone. 
Five months ago. First floor. Broke in through a sliding door.
De-escalation. If we can't get to where he's going, we'll go where he's been.
I never think that.
The best intentions are fraught with disappointment.
Grissom.
What do you think?
Evidently. You got an I.D. on this guy?
Eyewitnesses?
It's amazing how the sight of blood can clear a room.
Wonder what made this wound? Looks like a puncture.
Proves the old adage.
You can't take it with you.
There's seminal fluid all over the place.
You guys smell that?
Smells like strawberries.
One of our 'freaks' wears pussycat pink.
Negative?
That's odd. It was a Den of Iniquity. 
What about the neck wound?
Any idea what caused it?
Anything else?
Looks like a bite. Spider bite or allergic reaction, maybe?
Gloves.
Okay, we're looking for any kind of blunt object that could've been used to stab our victim in the neck.
Size ten, double A.
Looks like murder to me.
Okay, this is the story. One of you lovely Cinderellas is missing a glass slipper and I'm playing the Prince. So would each of you remove your right shoe, please?
Doesn't fit.
Almost.
No.
Well, if the shoe fits ...
Excuse me, Jim. Am I interrupting something?
Miss ...
... I'm going to need a sample of your DNA.
I like your hair.
Are you a, uh, natural blonde?
Sorry. I needed a follicular tag.
Thank you.
Oh, yeah, we did. You'll need to fill out a form, though. The Captain will help you ...
... Surely.
Right after the murder.
So it's not a bug bite.
No needle?
Did you send a sample to tox?
Diabetic?
So cause of death was insulin shock.
He was staying at The Sphere.
Latex gloves, cotton swabs, specimen jars, other evidence-gathering stuff.
You tell us.
This room is registered to Trey Buchman. Who are you?
Not yet ...
Hey. 
Women's names. Hotels. Blocks of time.
Gigolo.
So was mine. Two victims, same profession.
What about the needle you found in the decomp?
Insulin dependents use needles that thin.
I think we're working the same case.
Employment history?
It's an observation.
Lady Heather, what services did they provide?
What would Aldous Huxley say?
Why?
You have lovely lips.
Hi, uh ... 
Yeah. Insulin poisoning.
I can't rule anybody out. Catherine ... I'm sorry about Eddie and your daughter. If, if you'd like to take some time off or ... 
You know, we found a dark hair in Trey Buchman's hotel room at the sphere.
Whoa. Stop.
You could tell us about your relationship with Croix Richards.
Which Mr. Richards helped you with?
We?
And these sessions were held at Lady Heather's?
He worked for Lady Heather as well. He's also dead.
Your wife does.
And the night you and I met at the Tangiers?
But her husband only knew about the guy he hired, Croix Richards. He had no idea that she hired Trey Buchman.
I guess you couldn't say no. I learned that Mr. McCormick is an investor in your internet site.
Did he ever tell you, specifically, what his wife's problem was?
A Pandora's box? All the evils of their marriage unleashed?
But he chose a woman who didn't understand the dynamics of a Dominant-submissive relationship.
No, in here, the submissive has the power. All he has to do is say the safety word and everything stops.
I'm just repeating what I've heard.
Part of the job.
Yes. But I value your insight.
I'm losing my balance.
No. I know who I am.
Yes, I do. 
You can always say stop.
What did you consider this? A little civility before work, I think?
Yeats ... 'Prayer For My Daughter.'
Cream?
Sugar?
Type 1?
Injections?
Recently?
Yes, I would ... 
... But I'm afraid I'll need a warrant. 
Excuse me. 
Greg! I need you to process these right away. Priority.
Or not.
The material we found in Rebecca McCormick's wound was nylon thread with fragments of ostrich feather.
I can take care of this myself.
I'd like to come in.
The, uh, submissive that was in here yesterday was wearing a feather boa.
Hmm. Same scent as Trey Buchman's crime scene. Remember the strawberry foam? Do these belong to Chloe?
I owe you an apology.
Thank you, Greg.
Look familiar?
Insulin was injected into Trey Buchman's shoulder at this end ... by you.
Your epithelials were found at the plunger end. Epithelials are skin cells filled with DNA - your genetic fingerprint.
So you started seeing each other outside of Lady Heather's?
Chloe thought that killing your wife's lovers would please you.
But she didn't obey you. She killed your wife. You couldn't make Chloe do what you wanted. All that time at Lady Heather's and you never learned that the submissive is the one in control?
Excuse us. Excuse me, sir. Thank You.
Yeah, it doesn't surprise me. You remember the MGM fire? We found people burned to their slot machines 'cause they wouldn't leave the action.
This guy's got a piece of wood sticking out of his head.
I once saw a guy walk fifteen blocks with three bullets in his face.
I don't much care where he was going. I want to know where he's been.
... and his wife.
Sharp force trauma.
I'm afraid if we try to remove it, we'll eradicate the prints.
I'm not going to get any prints off of this.
Yeah. I'm going to scrape his nails.
Hand me a bindle.
Yeah, only the wooden stake is in his head, not his heart.
Tamponading?
Yeah, but head trauma this severe, surgery would've probably killed him anyway.
I got scat.
Yep.
Yep.
No, Nick, it's not human. It's scat. Could be from a bat.
Bat 'guano'.
Is it sparkly?
Let me see.  I think it's quartz. Or fluorite.
All home to bats.
Not since Sam Braun ran the town.
A melting furnace.
Melting precious metals.
And the pawn tickets.
Topographical maps of the Sierra Nevada. Delamar Quadrangle, Lincoln County, La Madre Mountain ... Clark County.
Hey, Nick. Blood spatter and a bullet hole, maybe?
Except that our vic had a stake in his head. He wasn't shot.
We're looking for another body.
Dolomite, barite, calcite, antimony.
Do you have any idea how many mine shafts there are in the State of Nevada?
So, who was the last person he sold to?
Where is he now?
Where's the mine?
It's a bat gate. It keeps people out, lets the bats in.
Old mines are considered bat habitats and preserves.
Batman.
Insect chitin. It's usually found near the entrance of caves.
Guano. We got bats.
Probably California leaf-nosed bats.
They're like bees, Nick. You don't bother them, they won't bother you.
Are you seeing this? Gold.
I'm not so sure.
And these look like impact patterns.
But not with pellets.
You know, Lockwood said that James sold this parcel of land multiple times. I think he was running a scam.
Insect party.
Cockroaches, cave crickets. Carabid beetles. All heading deeper into the cave.
Maybe they got tired of eating bat guano.
Smells like trinitrotoluene.
Look familiar?
Fuse line. Dynamite.
Chest wound. Possibly from our .38. Just about two days old.
You know, wooden support beams, fuse line, TNT ... I think, uh, Alex James was trying to hide this body in the back of his mine.
Like most fuses, it probably burnt too quickly and he couldn't outrun the blast ... 
... Or the wooden stake.
Okay.  According to Greg, the blood on the bullet's a direct match to Joe McPherson. It's a done deal.
That figures.
Yup, and they all come to Vegas.
The car's dry. This must've happened right before the rain.
I think happy hour's over.
You and Catherine are running the evidence on this. Warrick just got done with Internal Affairs. He's on his way. 
You need to talk to the Restaurant Manager, too.
No.
I got gas.
Residential gas leak in Henderson.
We're cleared to go in?
Thanks. 
The gas company spikes its natural gas with mercaptan - smells like rotten eggs.
All's I smell is mothballs and stale tobacco.
Hello, David.
Makes our job easier.
No, but carbon monoxide's still gas.
Was Mr. Arnz in bed with her?
So why is she dead and he's alive?
I want to take a look at him.
Peter ... my name's Gil Grissom. I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
I'm very sorry about what happened to your mother.
Associated minerals?
Activated charcoal?
... and possibly a murder.
I just got a page from James Watson.
Nothing probative.
Mrs. Arnz was a smoker. Typically, a smoker's blood is already 10% saturated with C.O.
That still doesn't explain why one lived and one died.
Thanks, Greg.
Isaac Asimov-- one of my favorite writers. 'If knowledge can create problems, then it is not through ignorance that we will solve them.'
It's my job to figure out what happened to your mother.
... 'but that I have so much confidence in non-scientists being wrong.' You a scientist?
The, uh, prescription is in your name.
No. We're just telling you what we know.
I have one more question. When did you quit smoking? I noticed the, uh, nicotine patch on your arm.
You're not supposed to be in here.
Well, perhaps you didn't see the crime scene tape.
On the contrary. I heard you have an almost perfect 4.0 GPA. With the exception of a 'B' in English. Our detectives do complete background searches on all the principles at a crime scene. I understand you threatened your English teacher.
You might want to check your filter, too. You're out of charcoal.
In 1939, Isaac Asimov was an undergraduate studying zoology. As part of a course requirement, the students were asked to find a stray cat, kill it and dissect it. Isaac found his cat, he killed it, and then he promptly dropped out of zoology. Fifty years later, he wrote that the memory of killing that cat still haunted him.
Yeah, I do. Why didn't you fix the chimney damper in your parents' bedroom?
Nick, at what point is the saturation level of carbon monoxide in the bloodstream lethal?
Mmm. Well, his mother's level was in the range, but his father's level was low.
What about smoking?
Yeah, we didn't know he'd quit, either. The nicotine levels in his system were high but when we went to speak with him, he was wearing a nicotine patch.
You made a basic scientific mistake, Peter. You stopped observing the human element because you thought it was inferior.
I know why. They weren't going to let you go, were they?
Science isn't about the gratification, Peter. It's about the truth.
Yeah, whoa-ho.
Adipocere, a.k.a. Mortuary wax. This is what you get when fatty tissue decomposes in an alkaline environment with limited oxygen.
How do you know it's a he?
Signed, sealed and delivered.
It happens. When I was working in Minneapolis, we had two John Smiths come in on the same day. Sent the wrong one back to Canada. Anyway, our body's still in the morgue. David finally processed his ten card. Guy's name is Keith Mercer.
Eleven days ago. Found him in an alley off of Fremont in a pile of garbage next to the dumpster.
Initially, the police thought he was homeless. He hadn't bathed, no wallet, watch or keys, and he has scars on his lower legs.
Yeah, cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head.
Could have been a lot of things. 
Evidence without context is ambiguous at best.
Mrs. Mercer ... you have my attention. And I'd like to see your house.
It looks like someone was trying to clean up, too, but forgot to use their Murphy's oil soap. 
Luminol.
I may have blood here, too.
Did you touch or move this statue at any time in the last ten days?
Could you tell us what you kept in this box?
Yesterday?
Mr. Mercer's been in the morgue for ten days. So unless you were at a seance. 
Did you find that suit there as well?
With this credit card?
I wish these people would start checking IDs.
So, blood?
No blood on his clothing. 
The shoe treads don't match. And the guy's got no car.
And if you're robbing a house, why don't you take more stuff?
I think the killer knew what he was going to steal.
You ran it?
Are you a numismatist, Greg?
So, let's see, you surf, you scuba dive, you're into latex ... you like fashion models and Marilyn Manson. And you also have a coin collection. 
Well ... I raise cockroaches.
Does now.
There must be $50,000 worth of coins in there, isn't there, Greg?
You must have a record of the transaction.
Maybe it's in your car.
Trace amounts of sulfur. You don't artificially tone your coins, do you, Mr. Jones?
Well, you may have some authentic blood in your car as well.
Huh.
How's it look?
Keith Mercer made a bad call.
What happened to your enthusiasm, Greg?
Out there ... means a pay cut.
That's good to know.
This is the last art house left in Vegas. I saw Baraka here, on a double bill with Koyaanisqatsi.
Sure.
No.
Single puncture wound to the base of the skull.
They were watching the movie. Dark room. Loud music. Four exits. Everybody looking the other way.
... or a movie buff.
It was 'Out of the Past', with Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer.
Well, the killer could have stood over him, placed his hand over his mouth, stabbed him in the back of the head.
Anthony Quinn did it, too, in 'Guns of Navaronne'.
Small patterns; could have been a chain, maybe, huh?
Well, whoever called him didn't leave their number.
Is the gunfight loud?
Perfect moment to do it. Cover up any noise the victim might make.
Did she come back in?
Did anyone see her coming into the lobby?
They can do that now?
Ten-forty.
That sounds like a no answer.
Yeah, well, he was already dead by then.
That's when the gunfire erupted.
In the movie. I'll need an address for that number.
Audrey Hilden?
And why did you call him three times in a row, 40 minutes later?
Do you see a lot of movies at the art house theater?
I see they recently had a Hitchcock retrospective.
Jacqui, do you have anything for us?
Too consistent.  Looks like fine grain.
Well, a screwdriver's cheaper than an attorney.
Did you notice anything else?
Excuse me. Where'd you get those gloves?
I'll tell you what -- I'll buy you a new pair of gloves.
Well, Audrey called Dr. Sugarman's cell from her home at 11:26.
The mysterious redhead in the theater?
Hit woman.
Too convenient.
Catherine ... she's got a whole 'nother set of horizontal marks on her neck, below the cord. And postmortem bruising. I think she was strangled first and then hanged.
She was dragged. She's got carpet fibers on her heels.
When we were here earlier, there was a movie schedule pinned up there that had a handwritten note on it. I'm not sure she wanted me to see it. Now it's gone.
Well, maybe this will bring it up.
It's written above 'Strangers On A Train'
Two strangers meet on a train, make a pact to get rid of each other's problems. They figure since neither has a motive for the killings, they won't be caught.
In the movie, Robert Walker kills Farley Granger's wife. Granger didn't think he was serious, so when he refuses to kill walker's father, walker goes after him.
Who's playing Robert Walker's part?
It's not a hotel room, though.
... parking space, maybe.
Mr. Haines? 
It was open.
I'm with the crime lab. I'm a professional snoop. Do you, uh ... ever wear that wig en you go out?
Do you like the movies? I, uh, noticed you have an art house theater schedule on your mirror.
Ever seen 'Strangers On a Train'?
Yeah, it's good.  You use a lot of creams, huh?
Is that your own recipe?
I'm a scientist. 
No. I don't mind.
There's a lot of that going around.
Kelly Goodson?
You know, she had a business card in her locker -- Langly &amp; Langly, Attorneys-at-law. It'd be interesting to find out ... 
So, they liked the same movies ... they had the same problem ... and they hired the same lawyer?
The extension cord used to strangle Audrey Hilden. 
The dentist's gold chain. 
The murderer's gloves.
Only on the inside; not necessarily the outside. You use two hands to put on gloves.
Special recipe.
Or they could've met at the movie theater.
Boy, can't you see them watching 'Strangers On a Train' together?
I'm thinking that Audrey told her everything about her dentist, and she told Audrey everything about Haines.
After you stabbed Sugarman, you ripped the gold chain off of his neck as proof that you'd kept up your end of the bargain.
And then Audrey called Sugarman three times in a row to see if it was true.
But that's all she did, isn't it? 'Cause just like in the movie, she had no intention of killing Haines ... and that's when you started harassing her.
You couldn't let her betray you. So, unfortunately, she had to die, too.
So, you made it look like she'd committed suicide, and then you planted Sugarman's gold chain, in hopes that we would think that she killed him, too.
You're right. It's just a story ... 
... but the chemicals that we found on your gloves and on the extension cord that was used to kill Audrey, that's our proof. Menthol ... trolamine salicylate ... capsaicin ... 
... eucalyptabalm ... isorcreme ... capsaicin ointment -- a unique concoction -- your unique concoction ... ... and this stuff is all over the evidence. Yeah ... it's a pretty good movie. Well, the character that you've been playing, the character that Robert Walker played in the movie ... dies at the end.
Murder, seduction, deceit-- the usual.
Actually, I'm not a big fan of noir.
I like silent movies.
When was the last time a comedian died of natural causes?
He's awfully young for a heart attack.
Excuse me! Could someone turn down the house lights, and turn up the stage lights? Thank you.
I want to see what he saw ... right before he died.
Nothing.
A punchline?
Six bottles of Innoko water. Three partially filled, three unopened.
Laughter is an involuntary motor response triggered by survival issues: Food, s*x, body functions ... death.
C.O.D.?
Well, Dougie Max had more than comedy in his blood. Tox came back positive for coke.
All right, 'Alex'. What is: Snorting it, smoking it, or injecting it?
Continuing this childish metaphor ... what is: How did the drugs get into his system?
Cite your source.
That's why we did the tests. 
So what did?
The new migraine medication?
Consumables from the club that matched Dougie's stomach contents. We know that he had naratriptamine in his system, and we also know that the poison was ingested.
I'll take your word for it.
You've isolated the source of the poison?
What about the other bottles?
Okay. I need you to process that bottle for trace impurities.
We identify the source ... maybe we identify the killer.
To get a drink.
Modern version of the old hook.
Let's get back to the water. It was poisoned.
Mmm. The, uh, bottles you took out to the stage -- where'd they come from?
Do you get headaches?
We want all the Innoko water ... to go.
Warrick ... this just in. D.B. at a convenience store on Torrey Pines. You're all I got.
Naratriptamine.
No injection holes in the bottle from the Speedy Mart. Do you see anything?
Would you like to try one from the Comedy Hole?
I need to see the lot numbers of the bottles you pulled from the convenience store.
The tainted bottles didn't come from this lot.
Somebody may have just walked in and put it there, though. Where are the bottles from the comedy club?
These are a match.
Maybe the killer wanted us to think it was random product tampering.
Cover up one murder with another?
There were traces of caffeine with the naratriptamine.
Do you provide your comedians with or do they brew their own?
Doesn't the red light mean, 'Get off the stage?' 
So why were you giving Dougie Max the red light?
We're going to need a sample of everyone's DNA.
Still listening.
I like your coffee.
I know, the finest money can buy.
Okay, so you've identified the type of coffee.
Cat feces?
And leaves a unique chemical signature. 
Oh, I got it.  It just wasn't funny.
Gunshot, right temple. Women don't shoot themselves in the head, do they, Catherine?
Is the husband around?
The Newmans have kids?
We're missing something.
You're not. It's a crime scene. 
Erythrosine. 
Red dye number three. 
Doesn't mean someone wasn't out here. Grab the ALS.
I paged you two hours ago. SARA: Right. Uh, it's my day off. I was up in Pahrump at some vineyard. You told me to get a life, remember?
Did I? 
I'm sorry, but I needed you. Dispatch called in a 419 at Tuscadero High School. You're on your own.
Solo.
Process.
Now we just need to figure out if one of them was Mr. Newman.
Did someone check this pool?
Does that pool look clear to you?
One of you guys is going in.
No skin separation. Minimal gaseous buildup. This guy's been in here under 12 hours. 
It's an anti-vortex filter.
It's designed to keep his hand out of that pipe. But it's missing a few screws.
We found his right hand caught in a pool filter.
Any significance to the marks on his chest?
Or he could have been beaten.
How about the new wife?
You always tell me that.
She didn't shoot herself. 
She had help.
Anything from the pool?
Anything from his head wound?
Mildew.
Aureobasidium pullulans. One of the very few fungi that can withstand the desert temperature.
Exactly. And here's the basic chemistry of the transfer.
Add sugar water spoiled from the heat, ...
... mix in some human biofilm you got yourself an all-you-can-eat mildew buffet.
Cal Newman wore size tens. So assuming our killer wore the size twelve ...
Genetics only gives you one from each parent.
What about stutter?
Minor donor?
Major donor?
Yeah, we did. So, let's get Greg to compare the reference sample and see if we found our major donor.
So, how does a kid who can't swim drown his father?
: And his body at the bottom of the pool with abrasions on his chest.
With someone who can swim.
Tooth hurt?
You might, uh, need your filling which we found at the bottom of the Newmans' pool.
Or caveat venditor. Let the seller beware. Your prints came back military. Navy seal.
Berglund. That's a Scandinavian name, isn't it?
Greg.
I need you to take off your shoes and socks.
Your mother's maiden name is Hojem, correct? Hojem is Norwegian?
That's true. Right foot first, please.
Left foot.
Put these on. Come see me in six hours.
You had a reaction.
Your right foot, I swabbed with a placebo, regular tap water.
Left foot ... eumycotic dermatitis.
It's a mildew-induced skin rash.
Here. Hydrocortisone. Follow the directions, clear it right up.
It's called aureobasidium pullulans.
This is a warrant.
Yes, both of them. Take off your shoes and socks, please. 
Aureobasidium pullulans is a mildew. We found it around the Newmans' pool. It induces rashes in people of Scandinavian descent -- and it does so in a predictable progression which provides us with a valuable timeline.
You have the rash.
And size 12 feet.
Let me tell you how you did this.
... and then you went upstairs.
You ever been to the theater, Peter? There's a play called Six Degrees of Separation. It's about how all the people in the world are connected to each other by no more than six people. All it takes to connect you to the victims is one degree.
Good night, Sara.
Hey. Nice work on the high school case.
I have no idea. I was actually on a date.
My god, what am I looking at?
His insides are on the outside. Did you move this body, David?
Have you ever seen anything like this?
Well, how many hit-and-runs have you pulled?
How many times have you seen the victim's viscera exposed?
There's a first time for everything.
But in reality? 
Fiction is often more compelling.BRASS: We got the eyewitnesses lined up, ready to go.
Testimonials, Jim? I don't consider that evidence.
Keep them all together, David.
I don't want your autograph, but I would like a photo and a bit of your DNA.
Say, 'cheese.'
Open up, please. Thank you.
Do you have his clothes?
That's good. That'll help.
Did he say anything else?
Gene Rayburn.
Point of reference.
Greg, this is your DNA lab. You are the master. We serve you.
Individual DNA from a mob attack on a cabbie ... and the cabbie's clothes.
Okay, Doc, tell me something I don't know.
About the body.
So, no fractures, no bruising. Cause of death?
So he wasn't hit by the taxi; he was run over?
So how much time elapsed between when he was stabbed and when he encountered the taxi?
Well, I'm sorry, but everyone seems to have something to do today. I have a teenager who was run over by a taxi. He wasn't hit by it; that's not what killed him. He was stabbed, fatally. For now, I have no ID, no suspects and no primary crime scene. I need you.
Want to go for a walk?
Okay. So, where do we pick up the trail?
He crossed Lake Mead Boulevard at 8:15 and it gets dark at 5:00. 
And I don't see any lights.
So, maybe the killer tossed the knife. It's a big dump site.
You got the gloves on.
What is happening to our parks?
Officer ... 
Well they're related by geography ... but for now it's just a dead guy in the park.
Take a look at this.
I think maybe someone palmed the cylinder gap.
Burnt skin is useless for DNA.
17%?
I don't need one. I have you.  Swab the pistol grip; get it to DNA.
Albert, did you notice if Todd Branson had any burn marks on his palms?
What about this guy?
A specific injury.
An incised wound. Well, that's a common injury sustained by knife-wielding killers. 
So assuming that this is the man who stabbed Todd Branson, what killed this guy?
You reach in and pull it out.
Maybe a frangible bullet designed to fragment on impact?
Did he have a dislocated shoulder?
It happened postmortem?
Emerson once said 'The mob is man voluntarily descending to the nature of the beast.' The beast is up for murder.
Is that the frangible?
Oh, serendipity.
Ms. Branson we also found a dead body in the park -- a white male in his mid-30s.
We have no ID, but we have a photograph.
Where have you been?
Drag marks?
So you're thinking someone else was there? Now, the revolver was registered to the boy's biological father but they haven't seen each other in ten years.
Well, maybe dad gave it to him behind mom's back.
True. Presence of GSR only places Todd in the vicinity of the gunfire.
Which brings us back to dad.
May I see your hands, please?
Can you hold him?
For now.
What do you weigh?
Do I have to get a scale?
Warrick, would you lie down on the floor?
Please?
Sara, grab Warrick's right arm. See if you can drag him across the room.
You don't trust me?
Stay there a minute.
Excuse me. Hi.  Judy, would you like to be part of a little experiment?
You'll keep your shoes on, I promise.
No. Spin around. Judy, would you take Warrick by the right arm and try and drag him across the room?
Thank you, Judy. You've been a big help.
You can go back to the water cooler.
Stewart Bradley had a dislocated shoulder postmortem. He's about the same weight as you. How does your shoulder feel?
Especially if he was dragged by somebody with limited upper body strength.
Well, maybe Jan Branson. She's about Judy's size.
He stabbed her son.
I don't know. But mothers protect their children, don't they?
... so perhaps the evidence is in Mrs. Branson's hands.
Ms. Branson, may I see your hands?
Could be important. Palms up, please.
Hi, pal.
May I see your hands, please?
Palms up.
Eric ... I need to know how you burned your hand. 
We recovered a gun ... in the park. Your burn indicates that your hand was over this gap when the gun was fired.
We found gunshot residue on Todd's jacket. We assumed that Todd fired the gun. But I think maybe he was standing next to you when you fired the gun. You didn't go to the park to stop Todd, did you? He went to the park to stop you.
Where we at, Greg?
I was busy.
All I see is a sheet.
Very nice presentation, Greg. What about the others? They all participated. They even bragged about it.
The mob mentality ... relieves individuals from having to distinguish between right and wrong. 
Yeah, six of them, to be exact. 
Unfortunately, physical evidence is limited by human action.
Yeah, well ... this is as far as we can take it. It's up to you guys.
Her throat's been slit by what appears to have been a very sharp implement. 
The room is completely stripped. No bedding, no sheets. 
Alice Dominguez. 
She wasn't robbed.
Wedding ring. Where's the husband?
I think your cell phone's vibrating.
Mm-hmm.
Huh?
Yeah, usually when someone gets their throat cut, it's from behind.
I think whoever did this was sitting in that chair.
One print on the knife. One print on the exit door. Both belonging to the husband. But we have two victims.
So it's possible the husband killed the wife. Who killed the husband?
The other couple?
Lie about what?
I don't know how fighting works for your marriage, but it probably saved your lives.
Well, if it's our serials, they've downgraded.
Where's her husband?
False alarm. Apparently, the guy just drove in from Fresno. Fell asleep in his car, and didn't even check in yet. So ...
This one's different.  Something's not right.
Okay, be careful, David. The body's frozen, and it's in full rigor. You're going to have to tilt it.
Yeah. Downward 90-degree angle, then up, tilt, and out.
Put him back down carefully.
There. Now try.
We have to do this quickly. It's 120 degrees outside, and our crime scene is melting.
Hold on a second. I got something. 
Would you like to bag this for me, Warrick? My hands are little numb.
Sara?
Would you take a sample of this blood for me?
Warrick, help her process this. Nick?
Come with me.
Shut the door, Nick.
No. I want to see the room the way they left it.
We're still going to look.
Not in person, no.
Good for us. Given the killer's appetite for sexual persuasion, maybe they blew the circuit. Overloaded it with coins.
I think so.
What do you think, Nick?
I need 15 minutes to think.
So they lure their victims with the promise of s*x.
And then they get them to the room. And they say, 'just kidding. We don't want s*x. We want your life.'
Which still doesn't explain how they get the husband to kill his wife.
They had a gun to his head.
Maybe he was hoping to save his wife from something worse.
Rape, torture, then murder.
Why did he stick him in the ice machine?
So he had to improvise.
Well, knowing now there was an odd mixture of blood, it's safe to say that someone cut themselves.
Assume nothing, Nick.
There they are.
No. His feet, actually.
Shiny.
How much do you love your wife?
Shakespeare?
'... admit impediments love is not love ...
One of the sonnets. Love is conditional.
But not for you.
Okay, here we go. We've got a husband and wife serial team killing couples. So, let's see where we're at starting with the first double murder. Sara?
I found some on Mr. Klinefeld's shoes, so it's possible the Klinefeld's picked up their first couple at Shimmer.
What about prints on the ice machine knife?
DNA, if given a warrant, will clear or convict...
Your Honor, with all due respect, you've signed warrants for less.
We get it yet?
Where are the admixture results from the ice machine?
This should get us a warrant.
Twelve strangers ... stuck in a room with no exit. It's like Sartre said: 'Hell is other people.'
My early opinion? Blunt force.
He's got a, uh, medical alert bracelet. Allergy to penicillin.
Do you have one with blond hair?
There's no tag cells, and she's not a natural blonde, and it looks synthetic.
Homicide just called. They're reopening the Rita Westonson case based on new information from the eyewitness?
You think we missed something?
Does the witness seem credible to you?
At the time, you were a level two, I believe. So closing the case would have been my decision.
Let me know.
We sent a sample of his pants to trace. The area around the injection mark ... 
I don't know, but if Gibbons knew he was severely allergic, I bet he carried one of those auto-injector pens.
And another allergy.
Based on peanut butter in the chili? How does a juror benefit from Gibbons' death?
That's nuts. The risk isn't worth the reward.
Good. What are you working on?
So the soil doesn't support the eye witness testimony.
The river might have washed away all trace of hydrocarbons.
The ring from four years ago is thinner and distorted.
And distortion could mean evidence of a toxic event.
How are you going to prove it?
Be specific, Greg.
Did the assay test show any other food allergies?
And who?
Apis mellifera linnaeus. We're looking for another body.
Was Gibbons even aware that he had a bee allergy?
Or what's left of him.
Lost consciousness, fell forward, hit his head on the table.
Well, that explains it. It was an outside job.
Four years ago when I decided to close the case, did you agree with my decision?
And now?
Why?
It happens. And that's what the evidence was telling us.
I agree, Nick. But when you start to have feelings for the people involved, you risk your objectivity.
Good. We certainly don't need another me around here.
'735'?
That's a nasty head wound.
It's common to find something in blood. Uncommon to find something on blood.
Petechial hemorrhaging. Asphyxia.
An 'S'?
So, he swallows a tile and tries to give himself a Heimlich?
That's interesting.
Anagrams.
Do we know why he came to Vegas?
Is that like the elo system in chess?
Wilson Janek?
Gil Grissom. Nice to meet you.
So ... 
What do you hear about Adam Brenner?
Well, he was alive last night when he beat you.
Actually ... I'm from the Las Vegas crime lab. I'm just here to collect your DNA.
What's it used for?
Well, that narrows it down to just about everybody in the tournament.
How many words used the letters we found in Adam's body?
What's an 'exvin'?
Well, according to the rules, if you play a bluff and your opponent challenges, you have to take the tiles back, you lose a turn and a minute off your game clock. No points.
P-I-S-T-O-L? It's not the word we were looking for, but it's interesting.
It's got blood on it.
Hmm. A fake gun for a fake word?
How about after he fell down on the floor and stopped breathing?
You got a husband-and-wife serial team killing couples.
You've signed warrants for less.
Love is conditional.
But not for you.
Should get a warrant.
No.
Are those your guys?
How long they been sitting on the house?
Two undercover guys outside. Two dead bodies inside.
Not paranoid enough.
W ... what is that?
You know we're going to need to see your guns.
It wasn't a question.
So it seems.
Yesterday's suspects. Today's victims.
Take the inside.
Print the handle.
I don't know what that is. Make sure you get al though. You see any cartridge casings?
So T.O.D. was about 11:00 P.M.
We're going to bring everything back. 
Linens and towels from The Sphere on top of the washing machine, and what I believe to be sheets from the motel inside the dryer. Both positive presumptive for blood.
What does that say about whoever killed them?
If I'm not done, you're not done.
Which way is Harmon Hill?
And how'd he beat us to the killer?
No. We found a lot of this material at the crime scene.
Maybe he was shot through some sort of object. 
Who do we have around here that could find us a somewhat used soda bottle?
If the evidence points to cops, we chase cops.
Somebody knew we were looking at the Klinefelds. They knew where they lived. That's somebody inside.
Ha! In what city?
There was an eyewitness who saw a uniform at the front door.
So, now you're discrediting your own witness?
Just because they weren't the shooters doesn't mean they weren't involved.
Oh, please! You got a bogus 444 call two blocks away.
I'm not a cop.
That's not the way it works.
Not now.
This'll do.
Where exactly?
Meaning?
This collar's dry. It's hot out -- at least a buck twenty-five.
How'd you manage to lose your badge?
That's not the answer I was hoping for.
You referring to me?
This swab is your new priority.
Fill me in first. The sweat stain?
The shoe print?
How can you be doing that when you're standing here?
Where are we?
Old habits die hard. 
Yeah.
You're a suspect in an ongoing investigation. We're not allowed to have a conversation.
Well, if that's true, then your DNA sample will rule you out.
Is that how you do your job, officer?
Maybe he disguised his voice.
I messed up, Jim. I got ahead of the evidence. I made it personal, and I don't know why.
I still think it's somebody inside. 
Vigilantes?
So take the cops out. Who's left?
'All for our country.'
I'm not accusing you of murder. I just want to see your shoes.
We need to see all your shoes.
Not this pair.
Not those.
You a smoker?
It's not good for you.
I guess he'd just figured he'd take a shortcut. You've thought about it.
Pharaoh's Fever, yeah ... but my ride ended at the platform. What do you know?
Accident with injury.
It's also a Four-Eighteen-B.
A runaway train.
This is the first time a roller coaster has derailed in Clark County. Huge criminal and civil liabilities issues, so keep it quiet. Photograph the scene. Bag and tag all the detritus. Forklift anything bigger than Greg. We're going to put up a tent on the other side of the parking lot for accident reconstruction. Questions?
Curious, isn't it?
You responsible for maintaining this roller coaster?
You have any idea what would cause this train to go off the track?
So, you're an expert?
Do you know what that is?
Well, one loose screw ... couldn't cause a train to derail, could it?
'There are three things in human life that are important. The first is to be kind; the second one is to be kind; and the third one is to be kind.'
Very good. Author of one of the greatest horror stories ever written: Turn of the Screw. And I'm looking for one.
Yes.
Well, as long as you can screw a nut on it, it's a screw.
Well, it's only a mystery if you believe in ghosts.
End threads are stripped.
And the nuts would've popped off.
We got tool marks.
Vertical striations, evenly spaced. 
What about this guy?
According the ride operator, there were only five passengers on the roller coaster, and no employees.
So ... maybe Nevins was just an unfortunate bystander. Hit in the head by a falling roller coaster.
Albert... dead men don't ride roller coasters.
We're going to need to see the underside of the loading platform.
No.
Uh, Woody? We'd like to be alone.
Well, easy access. Wheels are in reach.
It's a funny place for lubricant. It's not even on the track.
Hey, look at that. 
Were you aware that that support beam was detached?
Woody, we'd like to requisition your pipe wrench.
Well, I promise we'll get it back to you.
Yeah?
Anything distinctive?
Well, we need to find a car with a red interior.
The release of epinephrine and adrenaline while riding a roller coaster can produce a stimulatory effect. It enhances ejaculation.
Greg, do we know who the R.O. of this t-bird is?
The dead employee.
Everything's relevant Greg, until it's not.
A pipe wrench.
Greg, may I?
Blood pool.
Camouflaged by the red carpet. That explains the autopsy findings. Nevins may have never been in the roller coaster. Possibly killed by that wrench and stuffed in his own trunk.
I'm just following the evidence.
Are you?
Perfect match.
Did you any prints off the wrench?
Thank you, Woody.
Quadratic equations? That's not easy.
Is your name really Cleopatra?
Lisa, we need to know what the two of you did when you got off the ride.
How many names on the list?
Ah, the lovely Cleopatra.
Your client had a prescription for doxepin. May we see your arms, please?
Do you know how you contracted the rash, Lisa?
Do you know if he contracted the rash, as well?
Zack, what do you have against roller coasters?
You're a smart guy, Zack. So, uh ... let's talk this out, logically. According to your previous statement, when you locked up on Thursday night, Jim Nevins' car was the only one in the parking lot, right?
And you knew he was staying in the park to ride the roller coaster.
Did you think that meant something?
But ... you didn't trust her.
Uh-huh. But you didn't loosen the wheels enough, did you?
So when the roller coaster didn't derail, you took things into your own hands.
What I don't understand is why you didn't go back and fix the roller coaster.
You're not to blame for this, Woody.
My first week in Vegas, I road the Desperado. 
Hmm. The steel phantom, Kennywood Park, Pennsylvania -- I actually hold the marathon record there.
Mm. I presented a paper at an entomology convention in Cincinnati just so I could ride Son of Beast. Head over heels on a wooden track.
No. Not really. For me, it's not about the track.  It's about the thrill.
Eventually.
Sun Tzu once said, 'If you wait by the river long enough, the bodies of your enemies will float by.'
But those were brutal times.
Four weeks of 100 degree days, zero percent humidity. Eventually, the body tissues sublimate ...
... cell fluids vaporize ...
Well, the desert was making mummies long before the Egyptians.
Take a look at this. 
And look at her fingers. 
Yeah. Which means she was alive when she was entombed.
With a big bite out of it?
Hopefully. Take it back to the lab.
So whoever boarded her up in the closet maybe didn't intend to kill her.
She lived alone. Only relative was a nephew. Brass is looking for him.
Three days must have felt like three years.
Yeah. Also need a dental impression.
We don't need an I.D ...
You have to prepare yourself for this. Your aunt was found in an advanced state of decomposition.
Dry mouth. Diaphoresis. Red eyes, dilated pupils.
Do you get the munchies?
When you're high.
Do you like cake?
How would you like to make a dental impression for us?
Warrick's getting sloppy.
Dessert.
Well, both victims were left alive, we think. I mean, the old lady's death was probably unintentional, and the girl's rape was ... 
The difference between burglary and home invasion -- infliction of terror.
Well, it was probably easier to subdue her in that position.
You okay?
The occlusal plane looks the same. And the lateral incisor overlaps the canine ...
... in both cases.
Definitely not the old lady's nephew.
Jansson's dental impression is consistent with the bite mark on the girl's shoulder.
We've given them no reason to stop.
Hi. My name's Gil Grissom. I'm with the Las Vegas crime lab.
I think you do. And I need you to speak for someone who can't speak for herself. Another victim.
Look, we know that two men broke into your house. We have one suspect in custody, but we can't hold him unless you talk to us.
Mr. Kirkwood, I've done all that I can. I need what you saw.
No.
And if I had a wife and children ...
You find any commonalities?
It's a connection. It's not enough to compel DNA.
No, we have a name, and we know where he works.
Listen, when she I.D.s Kelly James, we're going to need a DNA sample and an immediate hold, no bail.
He's a risk.
Mr. Kirkwood, I'm sorry. The other day, I thought you were saying that you 'wouldn't' help me, and now I realize that you 'couldn't'.
Mr. Kirkwood ... you didn't do anything wrong.
What do you think?
108 degrees outside.
This one makes twelve.
145 degrees inside the car.
I brought a sheet. All these Looky-loo's, I think we'd better treat this like the baby's still alive.
uhm ... nothing.
Well, maybe this wasn't the primary vehicle for transporting the baby.
What is that?
I don't get people.
I am now. Catherine's doing the baby case. It's hot in here.
It doesn't appear that robbery was a motive.
I had a case once where a soda can was the murder weapon. Suspect used it to bash in the victim's head.
He's got a workout schedule. And today? Three-mile run. Fat metabolizers containing ephedra. Scorching heat and ephedra? That's not good.
Yeah. Feel the burn.
You got another theory?
One point on the electrical path to ground.
Well, there's your conductor.
'Ice block.'
Inventive.
I heard you got some head.
I arranged house seats for David to see Celine, so he pages me the minute you get anything perishable.
Oh ... formaldehyde.
No ID through CODIS. Quite a bit of leaf litter. 
That looks like animal activity. 
That took skill.
The unkindest cut of all.
Good morning. I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab, and I ...
Gil Grissom, Las Vegas Crime Lab. May I?
Well, the Elko County Sheriff made the request. We were happy to respond. It's an interesting case.
Must have been a heck of a fall. His head's in a plastic jar.
Well, you do now.
Lieutenant, the preliminary autopsy revealed a single, straight, two-inch cut on the victim's jaw. It was a blade mark. So, there's not just a body out there, there's also a killer.
Grissom.
I'm sorry. I should've called. 
How can you think that? You wouldn't mind taking care of those for me, would you?
I'll make it up to you.
Good. Thanks. I owe you one.
Yeah. She hates it when we're apart.
So your dog found the head?
Is he okay?
All animals can smell rotting flesh. Studies have shown that when domestic pets bring back human body parts, usually the remains are within a half-mile radius.
It occurs more than you think. Have you noticed any buzzards or vultures around?
Thanks.
This slope faces north, doesn't it?
You know that old expression, 'heads will roll'? It's true -- especially downhill.
I'm hoping. Bodies make good fertilizer. You often see fresh, green shoots near a gravesite.
I prefer questions actually.
Step away from there, would you please, fellas? Don't disturb the scene.
Carabid beetles. Second instar maggots. 
Formica obscuripes.
Yeah, I do. They're perfect. They always do their jobs. 
This body's been here four to seven days.
How deep would you say this hole is, Lieutenant?
Takes a fair amount of dedication to dig a hole this deep up here, don't you think?
Maybe.
This blood's not from a cut. The drops imply directionality. The stellated circles imply ... 
... perpendicular impact. 
This spatter is in direct line with the victim's carotid. It's arterial spurt.
I think that the cut we found on his jaw ... was a lure to draw predators.
This wasn't just murder. It was torture.
You're going to have to be patient, Lieutenant. The scene hasn't been released yet. You know, this may be a variation on an old native American form of punishment. The body was bound and buried up to its neck. Tree sap was poured over the head to attract ants.
You see? That's a good question.
You are the coroner, I presume.
Well, we can't touch the body until you authorize it.
There may be evidence in the gravesite. We need to preserve it.
The site's already been compromised. We'll make do with what we have here. Now, for each foot of dirt that's removed, go on a separate bag. I'll sift through it later.
Hold on. Make sure your shovels don't get within six inches of that body.
Well, veterinary school's harder to get into than medical school. That's not what I was looking at. This is you and that gal from the diner.
Only a licensed pathologist can perform an autopsy. All we're allowed to do is search for evidence on the body.
Then we take it to Vegas. Tonight. We'll need someone to drive the body.
Our medical examiner will send you his report. You'll need to sign the death certificate as to cause and manner of death.
Well, I'm not sure yet.
No ligature marks.
Apparently not.
Well, maybe the killer had a gun on him.
That would imply premeditation.
Sylvia Rogers' dog got sick after chewing on the victim's head, correct?
Did you do blood work?
Call the lab. Have them do a full drug and tox panel on the blood. 
Maybe whatever was in this man's body is also in the dog's.
Hold on a second, fellows.
Okay.
Say cheese.
Souvenir.
I need a place to work.
What kind of car was it?
Lieutenant?
The victim was on his way out of town. We know he didn't get very far. So where's his vehicle?
If the killer was a local, he could have ditched the car somewhere near here.
It's a theory.
And like any theory, it doesn't mean anything unless you can prove it.
May I borrow this? 
The victim was last seen here, right?
We found his body here.
This is the only way out of town. The killer had to intercept him somewhere along this road. 
Hey, doc, I need to use some of your medical supplies and make a telephone call. It's local.
Did you tint these windows yourself?
Do you have any tinting film left?
May I use it?
Oh, good, the police. I'd like to report a crime.
Yeah, my vehicle was broken into and my field kit was stolen.
Not necessarily.
Would you keep an eye on this for me?
Thanks.
Excuse me.
You think that would help?
I, uh, found the victim's car.
It was, uh, ditched in an old barn up in the hills. 
I know you don't have any men to spare, so I called the highway patrol. They're sending troopers up there to secure the site.
Well, that should, uh, give you enough time to burn down the barn.
You going to just stand there, or are you coming in?
What does that mean exactly?
This barn had been broken into, which makes it a crime scene, even without the murder victim's car inside, so I don't need a warrant. Who owns this place?
Well, then who's responsible for the property?
Is that who you're protecting?
Hey, you think you can fix this window?
You know that kid that got murdered? We found his car up in the hills. In your uncle's old barn.
That's understandable. It's hard to get to. Not too many gas stations around here. You must do pretty good business.
You know, uh, the victim's car was full of gas. So you must've seen him, right, even though you said you didn't?
Grissom.
More or less.
Greg did?
Hopefully.
It is. It's also a powerful sedative. Could be what was used to subdue him. You know anybody in town that would use this?
Hey, Doc, take a look at the scope, will you? 
I found some hair in Ross Jenson's shirts.
You wouldn't happen to have any abyssinian patients?
Excuse me, Lieutenant. We need to talk.
Privately, please. 
Ross Jenson was having a romantic relationship with someone in this town.
Yes. I believe he was up here visiting that person. I found cat hairs on his t-shirts. From an abyssinian cat. The kind your brother owns.
Does your brother live alone?
Is he gay?
I realize that, but it's relevant to this investigation.
Was married?
Look, whether you like it or not, Leland is a suspect. But you already knew that. I'm giving you an opportunity, Lieutenant. So far, you're only guilty of being a good brother.
You're going to keep Leland in there, right?
He took at shot at me, and he tried to kill himself.
So I should be grateful that you showed restraint with me.
Thanks.  Hello, dear.
Well, that makes sense. From what I've been able to gather, this was his first and only visit up here.
Well, if I believe this was his first and only visit, how do we explain the leaves in his closet?
Does the roommate have a name?
Eric Brooks?
Eric must've known for a while. 
How did you intend to keep the relationship from your own son?
Mr. Brooks, your son killed Ross Jenson.
According to the evidence, it is.
I don't suppose that comes with a warranty?
Does he ever talk to you?
So you assumed your brother was capable of murder.
Questions, remember? Not asking them is what got everybody in trouble here in the first place.
I used to. I'm trying to change.
When exactly did war become a party?
Gunshot residue, close range.
How'd they get it through the metal detector?
This was burned.
Another murder.
You're hot.
You're emanating heat.  Did you get her blood yet?
So many reasons.
Catherine, have you met Chandra Moore? She'll be doing DNA while Greg's in the field.
Well, not now-- too much work. You have a suspicious death at the Palermo.
Warrick, trash call at a weekly at Fremont and 12th.
Nick, Sara, body in a shallow grave, dry lake bed, in Ely, off Groom Lake Road.
Greg, you're going to be with me, your final proficiency.
We leave in five minutes!
Certainly. Have you been seeing your P.E.A.P. Counselor?
How's it going?
Mmm.
Are you sure?
Thanks, David.
This is your proficiency test, Greg. You might want to work the scene. What do you see?
Look a little closer.
We haven't recovered the gun yet, so ... ?
Good.
Don't worry about me; worry about you. It's going to be a long night.
Yeah. I just scanned it in.
What's this blue stuff on the slide and the grip?
It's okay to say you don't know, Greg. That's why we have a trace lab.
Herpes.
There was a prescription for valacyclovin. I cross-referenced the pharmacy logo.
Same kind of wire I found in the first victim's car.
Bring me the head of John the Baptist.
Salome -- wanted proof that he was dead. They didn't have Polaroids back then.
So, you like her?
So, Greg, how do you explain adhesive and toilet bowl cleanser on the gun?
You inspected the toilet bowls for evidence?
At a crime scene, Greg? 
You go across the street or next-door, somewhere other than the scene, until you've cleared the restroom. Did you clear the restroom?
Well, you could've flushed away evidence, wiped away fingerprints from the handle. Make sure you include this in your field notes.
Echoes of Michael Corleone.
He wouldn't. So what are you gonna do now?
Are you aware that your fingerprints are in the Federal system?
You both took valacyclovin as well. We found your prints on some duct tape in the women's restroom.
The duct tape was used to hide Manny's gun.
Congratulations. You got both.
You committed a fatal error, Greg. You compromised evidence at a crime scene. A judgment like that can cost us a conviction. In order to solo in the field, you have to successfully complete three proficiencies. 
Yeah. 
But ... 
Since you found a suitable replacement in the lab, I'm going to give you one more chance.
Weird ... no sign of struggle.
Smells clean.
Ah, but here's the smell of the blood still, and all the perfumes in Arabia will not sweeten this little room.
Hand me my multi-tool, will ya, Greg? I need a Phillips.
Well, the stabbing was brutal, but the crime scene is clean. No cast-off, no spatter. So, I want to know if the killer washed blood down the drain.
Swab and phenol this, will ya?
Label it. Send it to DNA.
SAE kit?
Aren't they always? I don't know why people think that rape has anything to do with s*x.
What else?
Well done.
We don't usually run a panel for semen, Greg.
Wow. You guys are rendering me obsolete.
Maybe he's back in the game again, selling coke to out-of-town businessmen from the comfort and security of his hotel room.
Even cokeheads need a diversion now and then.
I'll talk to the judge.
Could you just keep him under surveillance for now, let Greg tag along with your guy? We might learn something.
It wasn't manipulated -- it was processed. That's what we do.
It's not my fault that the courts lag behind our technology.
Your honor, I need the warrant in order to find something else.
You called me?
That's it? A compromised wad of hair?
You sniffed it?
No, actually, it's the first time you've ever done anything to impress me.
Thanks, David.
Lucy, who else has access to your bleach?
Those your kids?
And the baby?
Is that your second wife?
So you must have had your vasectomy reversed.
You also have access to the bleach, so you won't mind if I take a DNA sample.
Mr. Michaels, in my work over the last twenty-five years, I've come to understand the kind of person who's a rapist-killer.
Well, a woman was murdered in your client's hotel. He has a right to hear our theory. The killer is clearly a psychopath. He's killed more than once. I'm sure that before his first rape and murder he fantasized about it for years.
During that time, he engaged in behavioral tryouts. Stalking women and attempting to coerce them sexually, each time moving closer and closer to the actual event.
I believe that after you consummated your first attack, you felt excitement greater than you anticipated. Your only regret was that she died too quickly.
But you took solace in the knowledge that, uh, you could do it again. In fact, your subsequent victim had similar characteristics to your first victim.
You see, what differentiates a psychopath from a 'heat of the moment' killer is forethought.
And you thought about this for a long time.
And now that we know where to find it, and we have your client on tape, I bet you we'll get a warrant.
Thank you.
Surely, you jest.
Yeah, but the present value of college tuition is about the same amount.
I guess it depends on what you learn.
'For never was a story of more woe than this of Juliet and her Romeo'
So much for safe s*x.
And you're thinking 'pink' skin tones are a common effect of carbon monoxide fumes.
We'll need a sample of that vomit.
You're running point.
Hello, Conrad.
We had a one-hour recess -- I'm on my way back now. And this must be Mr. Billmeyer. I'm so glad he's back.
You might want to have Hodges analyze that cigar. Oh, and the print tech is free. He could, uh, spray the party hat with ninhydrin.
I love it when you wear your gloves.
I didn't.
Maybe it's a message.
Two heads are better than one.
Spatter patterns are a match. One bullet, two victims.
How 'bout that? Our mystery vics are identical twins.
Technically, it's the same.
I just got it. It's a certificate of honorary ownership of Trigger, 'The Smartest Horse in the Movies,' issued by Roy Rogers to the Children of America. Roy felt that the children of America were the true owners of Trigger, so any kid that would write him, he'd send 'em one of those.
The Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Museum, which used to be in Victorville, California, and is now in Branson, Missouri.
King of the cowboys.  I wrote to him when I was four. He sent me one of those. I lost it, so I thought I'd replace it.
Yeah.
Take a look at this.
This seems contrived to me. The blood pool is too perfect. There's no splatter. Like somebody placed these entrails.
Thanks, Conrad.
What about Nick's camera?
I don't think we're gonna get lucky with this guy. He knows how to work clean.
I want to know anyone who had a grudge against him. Civilian complaints, death threats ...
There was a guy a couple of years ago that stalked him. He may be back.
At least we have a general direction.
People use what they know.
Sara, what about the coffee cup?
What are you doing, Hodges?
What trace?
Let me do this.
The space in that box looks like 2x2x6, which would be 24 cubic feet.
That would hold approximately 600 liters of air. If you figure half a liter per breath.
Slow breathing ...
Maybe 12 breaths per minute. Panic breathing would be, what, twice that much.
Well, if the math is right, he's got about an hour and 15 minutes of air left in that box.
The guy probably picked the house at random, 'cause he knew we'd chase it.
Archie's trying to narrow it down. The feed stays active for two minutes every time you press the 'WATCH' button. But I got to go. I got people to see.
Your honor. Mrs. Stokes. I'm, uh, sorry that we're meeting under these circumstances.
Judge Stokes ... 
I don't think that will help.
We're not sure who has your son ... or why.
Very little.
From where?
Catherine, if the press finds out about this, it'll look like Sam Braun bribed the lab.
Yeah, well, so do I, but nonetheless ...
All right. But I make the drop. You're hands off.
You can't be seen anywhere near this money. It was given to the lab anonymously. Agreed?
Las Vegas Crime Lab.
I've got your money.
Yes.
Normally, you'd be 100% right, but this time, you're
It is real. Where is Nick?
Are you a terrorist?
Look, I really don't want to talk to you. Where is my guy?
Yes, he is. Where is he buried?
That's none of your business.
He blew himself up and left us with nothing.
Well, at least Nicky's keeping it together. That's good. What about the web cam trace?
Neither was the Styrofoam cup.
No, you never did, Nick.
What is -- ?
Wait a minute.
Ants.
My God, he's being eaten alive.
As much.
Oh, come on, pal.
Yeah. That's it.
Come on. Little more.
Keep coming. Show me what you're made of. Come on, buddy.
Gotcha!
Solenopsis invicta.
They're fire ants, very rare in Nevada. They don't like our soil. The only places you find them around Vegas are in plant and tree nurseries.
You said on the phone you had a fire ant mound. Where is it?
All right, look. Fan out. Look for loose soil. Anything that might've been dug up recently.
Short bursts, Greg. Don't suffocate him!
Warrick, Catherine's right. Get out of the hole now.  I know what we're gonna do. Just trust me.
We need 200 pounds of dirt over here right now, and we're gonna use that backhoe to get it.
Nick!
Can you hear me?
It's gonna take us a minute to get you out of there, okay? Nick!
Pancho!
Listen to me.
Put your hand on my hand.
Good. Now listen. There may be explosives under the box. They're probably set on pressure switches.
We need to equalize your body weight before we can pull you out, okay?
Pancho, nod your head if you understand me.
Okay, we're gonna use the dirt from the backhoe to equalize his weight.  I need a rope and a caribiner.
All right, Pancho, we're gonna open the lid and get you out, but I need you to stay lying down. Okay? Or else you'll blow us all up.  You understand that?
Do you promise?
Pancho, say, 'I promise.'
Don't move.
All right, bring that over.
Okay, Pancho, I want you to close your eyes and hold your breath.
Now!
Ready? Go!
I want my guys back.
Well, we're doing everything we can.
Did you injure yourself, Mrs. Perez?
That's a lot of blood. I'm going to need to take your shirt.
If you like, I can have someone follow you home so that you can change.
I'm just collecting evidence.
Nick, you failed firearms qualification. You can't be here.
Not in the field.
You're in violation just carrying the weapon.
What is that? Homework research?
I don't know. I bet you were a pretty smart seventh grader.
Sara. 
'I hate mom &amp; dad.'
Gil Grissom, Sara Sidle, Las Vegas Crime Lab.
What's your sister like? Personable, friendly, outgoing, trusting, maybe?
Uh, Daniel... you're bleeding.
They're the ones most likely to plan an abduction and find the privacy for sexual assault and murder.
Photos of children on his phone, including Alicia.
She's been all over the news, non-stop. It's that why you shaved?
Her friend tells us that you were always looking at her. You went out in the morning and watched them go to school.
How does a six-year-old act hot?
It's not a disease. It's a compulsion.
We found a pair of boy's underwear in your bedroom. Explain that.
So you fantasize, and eventually, the fantasy's not enough and you relapse.
Well, if that's true, then you were in a store where little children were shopping with their mothers.
Medroxyprogesterone is inconclusive. It renders the subject incapable of erection, but it doesn't remove the drive. You would still be capable of sexual assault using other objects.
How many people have walked through the crime scene?
We're going to need some time here, Jim.
Protecting her against insects and carrion, maybe.
Somebody, uh, wanted her intact. 
All right. 360-degree grid search. Sometimes rapists like to relive the event. He may have wanted to watch her. So keep the body in view. We're looking for shoe prints, sperm clusters ... anything else you can find.
Well, today's temp, last night's weather ... may have had something to do with it.
No defensive wounds. No wounds of any kind.
Well, she was wrapped in a bloody blanket. Since there's no trauma, maybe the blood belongs to her killer.
Roll her.
Look at those marks. There was nothing underneath her at the crime scene that, uh, would've made those.
Yeah, but there's, uh, two impressions, and they're too long to be a lug wrench.
Yes.
Where was she going?
Was she buying drugs?
Well, if enough people knew what was out there hunting them, they'd never leave their house. I think you need to sit her down.
Catherine, there's a big difference between scaring her and preparing her. And all the reasons why you should are in that room.
What is all this bone scarring?
Marrow harvest?
Let me ask you: What most likely causes shortness of breath, obvious bruising, sudden nosebleeds, petechiae?
Alicia's cause of death?
Time of death?
Which means April Perez was lying about the abduction.
Well, it's not unheard of. Have a baby, get the undeveloped stem cells from cord blood. New parents are even storing it now.
Well, Daniel must have relapsed because they took bone marrow twice.
A living DNA factory.
Where's Greg?
I need the tox results for Alicia Perez.
Menstrual?
Well, the volume of blood that was found on the blanket suggests injury or some kind of trauma. 
Run it again, please.
I just expect things to be done correctly, Greg.
You're right. What about the handkerchief?
Was your sister afraid?
But then your kidneys failed, and they broke their word, huh?
This wasn't a mercy killing, Daniel. This was an execution. Bone marrow, transfusions ... that's her blood in your veins. 
It dripped out of your nose onto the blanket while you were killing her. If you cared so much for Alicia, why didn't you take your own life instead of hers?
But you believe your God forgives murder? If that's your defense, it won't keep you out of jail.
For what?
Any neural damage?
For, uh, medical purposes, I have his power of attorney.
Okay. 
DB in Henderson on the train tracks.
Pretty bad. They're trying to stabilize him.
Well, if scavengers nicked his clothes, they left a nice pair of riding boots.
Great.
Well, we don't know how far he was dragged. Where's the head?
Hey, Nick?
I think I found a toupee. Our vic may be bald.
What a waist.
David, are you getting the liver temp or performing acupuncture?
What do you think?
Well, he died with his boots on.
So what? Torture or self-inflicted?
I'm beginning to sense that COD was not decapitation.
It looks like lead. .44 caliber is my guess.
What are the options?
What are the risks?
And without surgery?
What are the odds?
Do it.
Ellie, this is Gil Grissom from the Las Vegas Crime Lab. I'm a friend of your father's. 
I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but your dad's been shot. 
And his condition is serious. 
I think you should come and see him. It would help him a lot. Please call me at 702-555-0141.
They're prepping him for surgery.
Where's McKeen?
We've worked together ever since he came from New Jersey.
We don't 'hang out,' Greg.
Excuse me, Ellie?
I'm Gil Grissom. Thanks for coming.
Probably a few hours.
No.
You know, there's a motel just down the street. I'll get you a room.
I'm okay.
Corset-training. A venerable practice.
In Victorian times, it was considered a staple of masculine attire. Students in British boarding schools were encouraged to lose an inch a year from the time they were 14 on.
Mmn. 
It's called a wasp-waist, which is revealing. A wasp is from the insect group hymenoptera. The notion of hymen indicates virginity. In predacious wasps, the genitalia no longer function as a reproductive organ. It's used as a stinger. 
The victim was shot, body dumped, clothes burned.
I have my sources.
How's he doing?
This fellow seems to have lost his way.
You into military history?
You were a lucky girl. 
Pickett's charge, I think. The Confederates advanced from this position to Cemetery Ridge. They marched to their doom, but kept their honor. Carson obviously was a son of the South. 
Well, he was into discipline and self-denial.
Seems to run in the family.
And real bullets?
Colt .44?
Is that your dueling pistol?
We're going to have to take that with us.
I, too, demand satisfaction.
Ready.
I got something here, too. This could be the blood that we didn't find at the train tracks -- it's a lot of blood.
Maybe Carson was killed here?
It sounds like you already are.
Thank you, Nick.
Did you compare the bullet from the victim to this pistol?
And you know this how?
What is that?
So he's a cereal killer.
Which would be perfect for Civil War re-enactments.
No.
Well, I'm sure he'd appreciate the offer, but I don't think he'd want you to do that.
Hi. Come in. 
This is your dad's office.
Have a seat.
Why not?
That's the reason we asked you to come in.
Hey. Have some water.
Your, uh, fan club is here.
I don't know. Most people want to die in their sleep, I suppose. Never know that it's happening. 
Like a crime scene. Surprise, you're dead. I'd prefer to know in advance that I was going to die. I'd like to be diagnosed with cancer, actually. Have some time to prepare.
Go back to the rain forest one more time. Re-read 'Moby Dick.'
At least have enough time to say good-bye to the people I love.
Well, maybe the killer brought his own pen. Or took it with him as a souvenir.
Looks like forced entry with a metal object.
Ecklie.
No, he just wants to yell at me because I'm late with the personnel evaluations. It can wait.
Mm-hmm. I'll do them as soon as I get back to the lab.
What are you doing here?
Why?
Thanks.
Conrad. Sheriff. It's always lovely to see you fellas, but I'm right in the middle of a crime scene.
Yeah, I know.  She was a friend of yours. I'm sorry.
Well, they say it's a slam dunk case.
Then what am I doing here?
He's a gun for hire.
And you want me to refute his testimony?
When does he take the stand?
I'll do my best.
Mm-hmm.
Well, he's still got to prove his timeline.
Have you seen this tape?
Send everything over to the lab. I'll be there.
Well, according to my experience and all three of these textbooks, the P. Regina would develop from egg to puparium in eleven days.
Yeah, but his demonstration speaks for itself. There's no visible puparia for fifteen days, just as Thayer asserts.
The science in these textbooks is sound, but the tape is more than enough to get reasonable doubt.
I've reviewed his documentation. He purchased the pig from a reputable dealer. He conducted the experiment at a private lab with eyewitnesses, controlled all variables to replicate the conditions at Lake Mead during the time in question--65 to 73 degrees, no precipitation, on and on.
Sure, if the judge will give me eleven days.
I'll have Archie review the video footage. Maybe he messed with the time code or something.  I'll let you know.
You're certain?
Did you blow up the frames?
Okay.
I just finished your eval.
In the comments section, I noted that if you had my job, these evaluations wouldn't be late.
He used to be a competent scientist. We actually co-authored a paper together ten years ago. I believe greed has gotten in his way.
He manipulates people. The public assumes that scientists are ethical, but many of us are no better than politicians, evidently.
I know he is. I just don't know how. Videotapes are clean. The science appears sound. How's your case going?
It's always good to know what you don't know.
Seems so.
I can't tell you what to do, Sheriff.
Circling blowflies.
'Cause dead flies tell no lies.
Because the spider spied her. Catherine's daughter told me that when she was three. Do we have results?
Thank you.
Yeah. A Dr. Ryan called and said that you verbally harassed her?
Which means?
You should have cited Leviticus 17:11. 'The life of the flesh is in the blood.' Taken literally, life doesn't begin when the sperm meets the egg, but 18 days later. When the embryo is infused with blood.
Well, if I were speaking with a woman who prefers theology to science, it's a position she'd find tough to refute.
I don't know. I got to go to court.
I certainly do.
Yes.
No.
Our crime lab analyzed fly larvae that was taken from the pig used by Dr. Thayer in his demonstration. Apparently, they digested dimethyldithiophosphate and t-mulz light aromatic. 
Yes. I believe the malathion was sprayed onto the pig's skin.
It would delay the time it takes for puparia to appear. Specifically, the malathion would delay oviposition.
Laying eggs. Without malathion, adult flies would immediately lay new eggs on the pig's flesh. But with malathion, oviposition would be delayed up to four days. 
Yes.
The only rationale I can think of would be jury manipulation. Every entomologist knows that early oviposition is undetectable because flies lay their first round of eggs inside body openings. Anyone reviewing the tape would assume that the eggs were being laid, when in fact they were not. If our lab had not tested the larvae for toxins, we would never have known that. Nor would the jury.
I have nothing to say to you.
What character?
I hope so.
Actually, the work was done in the lab.
You know Sheriff, you could help me. I'm late delivering my team's personnel evaluations.
Thank you.
You know, Oscar Wilde once said, 'Ambition is the last refuge of failure.' I'm fine. Thanks.
Did you, uh, pull his wallet?
Catherine ... Do you need a minute?
Who's your lady friend?
That's the fun part.
Hey. You're coming with me. We got another 419 out by Nellis.
They tell me it tastes just like chicken.
This basin is designed to transfer an electrical current.
How does he end up face down in the middle of the bath?
Not impossible, though.
If he hit the water when the current was on, his muscles could've contracted, making it impossible for him to get out.
Yeah.  Who?
Not if you have a poultry fetish.
Yeah, I think so.
One more chance.
Definitely some kind of doll.
Three different views of the same dead doll. Maybe this is more than a signature. Maybe there's something these victims have in common.
Yeah.
And unfortunately, this is the best lead we have for their killer.
Yeah, well, with the equipment we have here.
Whatever happened with that number we got off the disposable cell phone? Any luck with that?
Let me guess. It was paid for with cash.
What about it?
Where did you find this?
How bad did Mannleigh get hurt by this?
Thank you, Hodges. I can see that it's a train.
Penny Garden. You delivered a package to her house.
Do you have any idea how ... your work ended up at crime scenes from three different murders?
Well, he's associated peripherally with all the victims, and he certainly has the right skills.
I know what it's like to lose yourself in little things. After a while it gets to you.
A guy kills two people before breakfast that he had no intention of killing when he woke up that morning. By all accounts, he's led a meager life, an unnoticed life. And then all of a sudden, in a flash, it's over. And now, for him, the real suffering begins.
Yeah.
Mankind has reached a new evolutionary plateau, and starting tomorrow, no one will rape, murder or maim again.
Too bad.
Raymundo Suarez called it as well.
Catherine, layout room, right away!
It's been sitting in my office for the last four weeks.
Yeah, I watched him blow his brains out. But I think the package was postmarked after he killed himself.
The three other murders, the miniature was left at the scene. This one was addressed to me.
The victim appears to be a Caucasian female with lots of books. It could be an office, somebody's living room ... or a modern hotel lobby. When I was gone, did anybody work a scene like this?
Never mind.
Take a look at the early edition. 
This murder hasn't happened yet.
They won't find anything. 
No, I even went through her little purse.
Look at this.
It would seem so.
Methods change. Killers evolve.
What?
These books are all arranged by subject matter: art, religion, science ... The victim is apparently well-educated.
I don't know.
There's something on the surface. Looks like brush strokes.
You have a cat, don't you, Hodges?
Do you ever take him out of the house?
So if this is a house cat, then this must be somebody's home.
Yeah. Maybe the victim has as well. The previous murders have all involved the vic's habits and routines. So maybe this time, it's a little something extra in her afternoon tea.
She lays down for her usual nap, the cat sneaks a sip, and neither one ever wakes up again.
It doesn't matter how she dies if we can't figure out who she is or where she is.
I choose these two.
No, but I'm pretty sure she was scheduled to die today. In each of the previous cases, the killer was at the scene to commit the murder. So maybe he was planning to show up at the condo.
And we have nothing to link him to the other three murders?
Okay. Thanks.
Stop hovering, Hodges. You're in or you're out.
No. Hand me a scalpel.
Tweezers.
Grissom.
Carbon monoxide poisoning.
That I don't know.
That's why the killer felt safe enough to send me the miniature. He never intended to be at the scene. There was no danger of being caught.
No.
Look, Sofia, there weren't any carbon monoxide sensors in the apartment, so no one could have known.
And in fact, if I hadn't have gone away, we'd have had another month to work with; you'd have never been in that position.
It's not perfect, though. Officer Kamen was not the intended victim.
I'm still not sure it's perfect enough.
Okay.
Now, it's perfect.
It was inevitable. With the murder, the amount of information that could leak rose exponentially.
There's chlorine bleach in the samples. Why put bleach in vase water?
The one with the water retention problem.
Media's all over him. Which means he's all over the undersheriff, who's all over Ecklie, who's blaming me for not going public with the Izzy Delancy miniature like he told me to.
Lipocalin, lactoferrin, lysozyme. Tears.
The victim was crying?
At this birthday party?
Ernie Dell confessed and killed himself to protect someone he loved. And that someone has murdered five people.
Eenie, meeny, miney, mo. Catch a monster by the toe.
Primitive people refused to be photographed, fearing the camera would steal their soul. 
Like any good hunter, the photographer stalks, takes aim, and shoots an image. Who's to say that when the shutter traps that moment in time those primitive fears weren't well founded?
These two kids have only been missing for fourteen hours. They could have eloped to Mexico.
All right. But you owe me one for getting me out of bed on a Saturday morning.
Mitch?
What do you want me to test?
Did you have assigned parking when you were in high school?
Yeah, it's blood. I hope they're in Mexico.
Yeah, well, the world's become a very small place, Nick. All the vices are closer to home.
More polyfill.
Hey, Nick?
This looks like arterial spraying. Something bad happened here.
Some kind of broken glass.
Well, this was kicked in.
Any calls placed before they went missing?
How about Ryan?
It bends the light more.
Thank you, David.
Greg.
Looks like acceleration marks.
So far there's no reports of anyone fitting Megan's description being admitted to area hospitals.
Nick!
Straight ahead of you about twenty yards.
Is she still alive?
You okay?
Phthirus Pubis.
There's a hole in the metal to let the urine pass. So theoretically, she could still get them.
You know, the incidence of STDs in monogamous couples is slim.
So assuming they both have pubic lice, if either Megan or Ryan were assaulted, they would have given them to their attacker.
Yeah, but once they jump to the fresh host, crabs contain the DNA of the receiver and the giver. Did the parents agree to an SAE kit?
How recent was the injury?
Did her mother mention the injury?
Well, I can guess where she got those and who she gave them to. What is it that she swallowed?
Looks like a memory card from a camera.
What's a 'Hit List'?
Try 'Megan.'
Men are never as mysterious as women wish they were.
The fingerprint results on Ryan's van. No hits except on the back door handle, came back to Diane Kentner. She was arrested last year at a demonstration in support of an X-rated photography show.
Maybe she wanted a ride.
It proves s*x with a minor. Even if we can't get her for Megan's hit-and-run, it's enough for a search warrant.
Looks like she drew us a map.
No one could have predicted this.
Postmortem photography-- memento mori. In the 19th century, a photo of your dead loved one was a popular keepsake. Death remembered. One last look.
Hey.
Charlie told Nick that Sheila pushed Ryan.
Intimately.
I'm sure he had a good excuse.
Yeah.
Next bedroom. There's another body in there.
According to Brass, the boyfriend of one of the victims found the bodies. Said there were six roommates, all showgirls. Evidently, one didn't come home.
Sara!
Dispatch, this is CSI Grissom ...
Yeah. He took his time with her. The others were killed efficiently.
David, don't move any of the bodies just yet, okay?
Partial footprint. Whoever kicked in this window was barefoot.
Yeah, but some of the others weren't.
What else?
I think when he came to this house, he was unprepared. He had to use things that were already here. They say a disorganized killer is apt to obtain his victims by chance.
Luck of the draw.
The girl in this picture is the victim from my room.
Yeah. Well, not when she was onstage.
Killer herded them all into here. He used the sheets from that bed to tie them up, then dragged them all down the hallways to the other two bedrooms to kill them.
Maybe he wanted to get her alone. Maybe she excited him ... or pissed him off. Either way, he was brutal with her. She was the messiest kill.
Yeah. He had all the time he needed 'cause the neighbors couldn't hear a thing.
Yes, sir, I understand that, but, uh, we're still analyzing the evidence. As soon as we have something to report, we'll report it. Okay.
Bottom of the pile -- first victim, top of the pile-- last.
Both found in Warrick's bedroom.
She was found dead in Sara's bedroom.
She was found on the floor in Warrick's bedroom. There's no logic to any of this.
But why would he clean off the knife between victims?
So he forced them to tie each other up.
Thanks.
Hey, Greg. The, uh, civil suit that was filed by the Demitrius James family, DA decided not to go to trial. So the city's agreed to a payout; $2.5 million.
It's just political pragmatism. City wants to cut their losses.
Comes with the job.
Was the same knife used to stab Marlon Frost?
Smudges won't put the knife in Mullins' hands, though.
All the evidence at the house suggests that the killer was unfamiliar with the layout.
Sara, slow down. Frost isn't going anywhere.
Okay, one step at a time.
So his DNA should be on it.
Well, then there's a lot more to Barbie than just a pretty face, 'cause this is a perfect half-inch scale model of the room. And assuming that the killer is the same person who made the miniature ... 
Yeah, but take a look at the blood pools.
There's no predicting a blood pool; it's inherently random.
It's real blood.
It's his biggest hit.
Probably before your time.
Sometimes it only takes one hit.
Bleach was used in this kitchen but not to clean up the blood.
If only the who was as easy as the how.
Cause of death?
Sorry, Izzy. Now ... 
What is that?
The key to our mystery?
No. No prints, no hairs, no fibers. Materials are common hobby shop issue, but the blood matches the victim's.
Who inherits the music rights?
Its illegal to benefit from a criminal act. If either one of them committed the murder ...
Well, that's motive for her. But how does this fit in?
What's the point of gratifying the murderer with publicity?
Don't we all?
So the key could've been in his system anywhere from a few minutes to several days?
Thank God. These events have to be connected. We'll check your old cases for possible suspects. I'll ask Ecklie if he can kick in some help from day shift.
You've got to stay at arm's length, Catherine.
How's Lindsey?
Prints put him in the motel. Found them on the Polaroid paper slip.
Can you place him at the bar?
The accident was a two-man job. Can you remember anybody else?
And there's a test we can do to prove it.
We're using a tilt table and we're injecting him with isoproterenol. We're testing his sensitivity to his vagus nerve. Basically, we're looking to find out if the nerves that control his blood pressure are predisposed to short circuit when he gets an adrenaline rush.
Unless he was faking it.
Not necessarily. Could be anybody in town. Or anybody out of town for that matter. That's a lot of suspects.
I don't know.
I'll deal with it.
How you doing?
Twenty years ago, the county was still using typewriters. Did you find anything?
Good. I'll run it. I have to pull you off of this. Days is down to four CSI's. You're on loan-out.
Money, stress, Ecklie, maybe. Just help them with their backlog.
Grissom. Catherine.  I'm on my way.
Does it make a difference?
You had just lost your daughter.
Stop it!
If a client did this, and left you to die, why are you protecting him?
Tell me the truth. 
Did they check your glucose level when you came in? 
Heather?
She's diabetic. I think she's going into shock.
Any results on Heather Kessler?
Heather's not supposed to drink because of her diabetes, which could explain the hypoglycemia and shock.
She was sexually assaulted?
This makes no sense. She's very strong. And tough as nails. Why didn't she fight?
She was here ... with me.
It was a social call, that's all.
Yes.
Apparently so.
Look, I went to Heather's on a hunch. There's something not right with her.
Yeah. Keeps my hands busy.
I'm the only one Heather trusts.
Sara ...
Thank you, Judy.
This is your granddaughter. Did you take this picture?
No.
No, I'm just a friend of hers.
Not really.
That's Zoe's daughter, Heather's granddaughter.
I'm just trying to understand what's happening to her.
I'm aware that the court has denied her visitation rights.
I'm not sure.  Has Heather tried to give you any money for Alison?
Can you tell me how much?
I wonder if she calculated the exact amount it would cost to raise a child and put her through college, especially at Harvard. That's where she sent Zoe. But it wasn't her house that she sold.
I know. What am I supposed to do? I'm your friend. Besides, there's someone I want you to meet.
The detail is ...
Well, then there's a lot more to Barbie than just a pretty face. 'Cause this is a perfect half-inch-scale model of the room.
Three different views of the same dead doll.
Just got an e-mail. Raymond Dell. Died two years ago in some bizarre back hoe incident in Rapid City.
Grissom.
I'll meet you there.
Somebody likes it cold.
No. But I'm afraid the Miniature Killer was here first.
Air-conditioning would have slowed that and accelerated mummification. Body's been sealed in the apartment. There's no insect activity. So much for TOD.
It's hard to say. Haven't found a miniature of the scene yet. Just this.
Clothes match. The ... uh ... vic's a PT nurse, but there's no blood on the doll, and it's not posed like the body.
I don't think we can rule anything out. It's all yours, my dear.
Yeah.
I live by the Uncertainty Principle. The mere act of observing a phenomenon changes its nature.
I'm certain we have.
A fingerprint.
Maybe he's finally gotten careless.
Hodges ran fabric, paint, glue, and plastic samples of the Trevor doll. The materials were consistent with the previous minis.
It was only a partial, not enough to put through AFIS. But there were epithelials in the print. Wendy's running DNA.
I found a thriving miniature hobbyist community on line. Sites where people meet, chat, exchange building tips, list stores they shop in.
Items like Trevor Dell's metal bracelet are difficult to make, even for skilled craftsmen. I'm trying to find people who specialize in miniature metal work.
Female serial killers are rare enough. Delusional psychosis in women ... rarer still.
Family court judge was explicit: 'No fishing expeditions.' We need to go in with a name.
I'll be back. I have to go see the Shadowcaster of the Forgotten Realms.
Hello, Art.
Coming along, thank you. We found another one.
I think so. By any chance, did you make this bracelet?
She have a last name?
It's the same cell number we already have. Do you remember what she looked like?
Weird how?
Was that the last time you saw her?
Battery powered micro-motor?
Grissom.
Her birth name was Natalie Davis.
She would've been about seven when she came to you in 1982.
Do you take a photo of every child?
Do you use bleach, Mrs. Wetzel?
According to Child Services, she only stayed with you a week. Do you remember why?
Fired unglazed pottery. Her biological father was Christopher Davis, a ventriloquist.
I Googled him.
Natalie's younger sister. 1981, she fell out of a tree house and died. But her father's still alive---and still performing.
What happened?
How did Natalie deal with it?
Yeah, I was just wondering what it must've looked like to her.
Come on, Sara, pick up. Please pick up.
Who was in my office while I was gone?
Her name is Natalie Davis, and she works for our janitorial service.
For over a month. She's never been arrested, so there's nothing to flag on a security check. She used Ernie Dell's address on her work form. She has no home phone and no driver's license.
Pull up the case photos.
Oh, my God. She was at the crime scene.
It is different. 
This girl holds me responsible for the death of Ernie Dell. I took away the only person she ever loved, so she's going to do the same thing to me.
It's not about a psychotic reaction to bleach, or some dead sister or the doll. 
'NotUrLittleBisqueDoll...'
This is Gil Grissom at CSI. I need to get an Attorney General's Waiver.
I want to talk to her, Jim. Alone.
Hi, Natalie. My name's Gil. It's so nice to finally meet you. I ... uh ... probably shouldn't say this, but ... I'm a huge fan. 
I've been a crime scene investigator for 22 years. I've worked over two-thousand homicides, and you are by far ... the best I've ever seen. I mean ... 
... you're such a great artist. And to be so young and so talented and ... so pretty. I've thought about you every night for the last nine months. I even tried to do what you do. I built my own miniature. 
You saw it? 
How'd I do?
Do you play chess? 
I play as a hobby. It quiets my mind, you know? Soothes me. At one point, I became so consumed by it that whenever I closed my eyes, I could see the chess pieces moving all around the board. I was obsessed with correcting all my bad moves. I wondered if a game could ever be played without a mistake. I'd love to play you sometime. 
I'm so impressed by the way you embrace your passion. You'd make a great CSI. This last one was brilliant. You studied our crime scene so well. Tracking the car to the junkyard and then towing it all the way out to the desert where you knew we wouldn't find it. And then ... the way you killed Sara.
You didn't?
No, it isn't, Natalie. It's about you. 
Natalie, listen to me -- tell me where she is.
Natalie. Please tell me where Sara is.
STOP IT! Just stop this! Tell me where Sara is!
Generally, autopsies are performed in the morning. 
Hello, David.
David Phillips, everyone, our excellent assistant coroner and baseball trivia expert.
I'll introduce you to her later.  Afternoons are usually for paperwork and court.
So you get the clothes, you get your guy.
Did he push all the buttons?
A lot?
Well, there's plenty of physical evidence, but it's all ambiguous.
Well, you know, there's precedent for charging him with promoting a suicide attempt. It's reckless endangerment. There was a case in New York, but it's hard to make that charge stick.
How do you do that?
Well, the embalming fluid would make the marijuana burn slower, giving it more chance to be absorbed, creating a longer lasting high, I would imagine.
You got to tell her the truth.
Bacon and eggs?
Is he one of the victims?
Life imitates art.
Okay. You first.
What about all this mess, the furniture and appliances?
That's a workable theory for now.
I believe I said first opinions are crucial, but if the evidence changes, so must the theory.
We're still working our way in.
All chainsaws operate the same way, right?  Chain travels around the bar, teeth move away from the operator around the top and come back on the bottom.
So, if our guy, Lou, was attacked from the front, the teeth would hit him from a downward angle.
So ... what? He was attacked from behind?
Ray Gaynor. The neighbor.
Put him under the Lou Beltran spatter. And load him up.
Well, the body's in the correct relative position. But the angle's off.
I don't know, but it's very awkward to try and line this up.
Lou Beltran wore his watch on his right wrist. 
I bet he was left-handed.
Doc Robbins said that the cuts on Lou's body were made when the chain was traveling upwards.
Which means that the top of the chain had to be facing him.
An inexperienced left-handed operator with a dull chainsaw certainly increases the risk for injury.
So he chainsawed his wife's furniture and appliances, the metal dulled the blade, and the kickback from the chainsaw is what killed him.
How many of you are right-handed?
Left-handed?
Twenty-five hundred left-handed people die each year using products designed for right-handed people.
A third person would have left shoe impressions in the blood, various other sign -- there was none.
Part of being a CSI is learning to work in the absence of absolute certainty. Each and every case brings us a new opportunity to learn something. For instance, in the case of Donna Basset, we can see that there is no such thing as an insignificant detail.  And finally, if the evidence changes, your theory must change as well. Questions?
You get used to it.
Well, not everyone can.
Because the dead can't speak for themselves.
Surveillance?
Witnesses?
Even if this guy was walking out of here with a million dollars ... this is way more than excessive.
Do fists and feet count?
Could one person have done this?
Greg ... lose the monkey suit, you got a scene; liquor store robbery. Here's the address.
Could be -- Sofia's got one of the suspect's sweaters. I need you to seal it, bring it back here and anything you can find.
You're a big boy, Greg. You don't need a wingman for this.
Whoa! Pick on somebody you're own size.
No.
Could this be a woman's shoe?
'Cause Catherine found a broken female toenail in the vic's mouth.
Which suggests that they were on the ground for most of the beating.
Greg?
Just another day at the office, huh?
He's gonna be fine.
His name is Demitrius James. He's in surgery.
Actually ... he's a student at the university.
I don't know.
Has someone called your parents? We should let them know.
What's the matter?
Why do they think that?
I never would've guessed.
Well ... now would be the time to come clean.
You tell her that you risked your life to save someone else's ... and I think she'll be very proud of you.
Contact lenses? 
Great. Just a game to them.
What do you see?
Inconsistency.
The dishwasher, both tourists and Greg were attacked near the strip. Dean Harden claims that he was attacked all the way over here in southwest Las Vegas. Swarms don't backtrack.
Humans have always adapted strategies from insects. Swarming is an ancient military tactic. You surround your enemies, then attack from all directions simultaneously. Alexander the Great pioneered the maneuver 2,000 years ago. Although swarms consist of several individuals, they must be treated as a single entity, which lives, thinks and moves as one, built with an internal logic to continue forward, gain momentum and never backtrack.
Take a look at these clothes.
In contrast to the other beatings, I found only one type of shoe tread on Dean's clothing. The print matches a size 12 Nike Air. And this tennis shoe is ... his own.
The truth is ... 
... a moral compass can only point you in the right direction, can't make you go there. Our culture preaches that, uh, you shouldn't be ashamed of anything you do anymore. 
And unfortunately, this city was built on the principle that there's no such thing as guilt. 'Do whatever you want; we won't tell.' So without a conscience, there's nothing to stop you from killing someone. And evidently, ... 
... you don't even have to feel bad about it.
She may have served them drinks.
Unfortunately, these windows aren't tempered.
And she went through face first.
Maybe they went through the room after they killed her.
There used to be.
Man ... her cancer had cancer. I guess she liked smoking more than living, huh?
You know, Catherine found antidepressants, laxatives, acid-reflux meds in her house, but I don't think she found anything for pain.
Maybe the killer took it with him.
Possible serial killer.
Look at the blood on the doll's forehead.
Could be two different views of the same subject.
Yeah, but we have no context. It could mean or represent just about anything.
Izzy Delancy, 50-year-old white male, washed-up rock star. Penny Garden, cancer-stricken retiree.
Why wasn't this one left at the crime scene like that one?
Look carefully at the back of the doll and at the pillow on the chair. There appears to be remnants of glue on both.
I think the killer expected the victim to die in this chair.
Penny Garden was poisoned with nicotine.
She didn't smoke it. She drank it. Liquid nicotine. Truman Capote used it as a murder weapon in his story, 'Hand-Carved Coffins,' and our killer put it in Aunt Penny's liqueur bottle.
A cigarette introduces approximately one milligram of nicotine into the body. The liqueur contained over 60. A dose that massive can induce severe convulsions ...
... and evidently, mess up a meticulously crafted murder.
That's why the miniature wasn't at the crime scene. The killer was compelled to fix it, so that it would match what actually happened.
Yeah. Commonly available to just about anyone. Any luck with the vic's calls?
Yeah. Take off that suit, too.
And Greg ... you did a good job.
What is it, Archie?
Well, fortunately for us, this was a personal delivery ... right to our front door.
I have to trust the people I work with, Jim.
He was off the clock.
He's very passionate about this case.
What does that mean? You think Gedda's got 'friends' inside the department?
Did you talk to IA yet?
That's because it wasn't about Gedda. It was about you.
I hope you know that's not gonna happen. You're in the rotation as of tomorrow, so go home.
You know, you keep pursuing this, you're going to end up suspended.
Well, that's consistent with him putting the body in your car.
Okay, I'll have Brass check it out. You stay out of it, though.
Sorry.
Hey, Mitch.
Where did you get this?
No, you didn't.
We found her purse and the bloody murder weapon in the place where you were sleeping. We found her dead body inside this car.
Hey! As of right now, you're suspended for two weeks.
You've had all your chances. You take the suspension or you're fired.
So, who found him?
Gil Grissom, Crime Lab.
What about the bull?
Is this the rope they tie around the bull?
Is that rosin? 
Do all the riders wear a glove?
He's not wearing one.
Guy was living the American dream. Every kid wants to grow up to be a cowboy.
Do you own the bull?
Your bull gave Cody Latshaw a pretty brutal beating.
Is it true that some riders tie the bull's testicles to get them to buck more?
Could a guy get a bull out of this chute without any help?
And open the gate.
I'm going to need to process your bull.
And this is Wintwister? What, uh ...
What would be the safest way for me to handle his hooves?
Do you think I could get him to step on something?
Think you could get him to step on this?
'And I will be your hero, your cowboy in the sun.'
I'm actually a fan of cowboy poetry.
Yeah, it's just a way of organizing your thoughts and feelings so that you can make sense of them.
Yeah, well, poetry can help you with that, too.
Well we know that Cody was alone when he died because he couldn't have opened the bucking chute by himself.
Whoever that someone was knew how to get into the arena, and also how to use the equipment. 
And?
Yeah, it's exquisite.
How'd you like to go on a roundup?
We got a match! Dustin Lightfoot. 
He had a cervical fracture from his earlier ride. It didn't take much to snap his spine.
I don't think it's about either girl. 
Did you read Tiffany's autopsy report?
So were Nancy's.
Wintwister.
I think that's why he went back to the arena that night. Wordsworth once wrote, 'Through love we feel we are greater than we know.' My guess is, riding that bull, Cody felt like a greater man.
No, why?
Who?
Who's that?
What's the matter with you?
Go tell Catherine what you found, make sure that you pull all the old evidence out of storage in case she needs it.
How long have you been here?
Why haven't these bodies been released?
The FBI field office is right next to the Strip. What's taking them so long?
What's going on?
DNA will tell us if this is your kid. But it does look like your killer came to Vegas.
Looks like he hit his head on the table.
Well, we don't know that yet.
No birthmarks.
So the only way to confirm the identity ...
Well, then you'll just have to wait for your answer.  You know, maybe now would be a good time for you to brief us on the original case.
Maybe there isn't one.
Except in the US last year, there were almost a hundred. Some things are just random.
Yes, actually, I have.
I know. We ran his palm print. Doesn't match. 
And decided he'd bring his kid with him?
And while he's playing cards, they both get murdered.
Both single, with no kids.
If there is a pattern.
I'll call in some additional AV techs, help Archie get through the footage, ... 
... but you know, I've learned that sometimes you can go faster by going slow.
I gathered that from your interrogation technique. You know, maybe you should go back to your hotel, take a nap.
What's wrong with my office?
That's an irradiated fetal pig. I used it to determine the effects of radiation on tissue.
For fun.
No, no, it's fine. Jack Malone, FBI. Sara Sidle, CSI.
Thank you. I'll see you when I see you.
Hank's my dog. She walks him for me sometimes.
Really? And, uh ... how'd it work out for you?
The victim have circular indentations on her head?
My guess is, this is the hammer we didn't find at the Davis house.
Huh.
He lost the proceeds from the Vegas murders at the Tangiers. So, he probably needed more cash.
Driver's license is on top, like before.
Sara? You okay?
No. He picks houses with no security systems, or dogs. Enters at night when most people are asleep, through open doors or windows. Easy targets.
Grissom.
No, I'm at a railroad spur about a quarter of a mile from the house.
Carmen Davis's house was next to the tracks, too.
Freight trains carry bulk fertilizer. I think your killer is riding the rails.
All the previous murders were committed within about a mile of an active railroad spur.
You know, you have the authority to stop all the trains coming in and out of Nevada.
.45 auto. Same caliber as the one taken from the Boulder City double.
Was the waitress in the car with him?
That's a pretty good head start.
Grissom.
Listen, do me a favor. Take a look at the map, find the nearest railway spur to our location.
Any other trains pass through here in the last hour?
Can you stop that train?
No, I like a good field trip.
Where'd you get that hat?
Maybe, uh ... he came here to kill his ex-wife.
Grissom.
Yeah, there's a reason for that.
Thanks, Jim.
Hey, Jack. I don't think that trooper was waving at Gina.
You said the kid who was kidnapped was six years old when he was adopted, birth parents unknown.
Terry Wicker was looking for his ex-wife ... 
A family reunion.
You keeping tabs on her?
The one that got away?
Okay. I'll see if I can clear it with Ecklie. Catherine has to supervise, though. You report to her.
What are you doing?
Looks like it's backwards.
It's possible.
You know, Sara, some cases, some suspects can get under your skin. Like this tooth. But you can't let it make you feel bad. If you want, we can put Nick on this.
Okay.
Hey.
I was going to ask you the same question. Listen, I'm worried about you.
Hi.
Okay, what's up?
Judy, have you seen Sara?
Thank you.
I appreciate this. Everyone's out. I'm short.
She hasn't been dead long.
David, you want to take the, uh, jacket off her face?
What happened to you?
Usually when a killer covers the victim's face, it suggests familiarity. An act of contrition.
Great. Carjacked by a friend.
You go; I'll stay with the body. I'll meet you there. 
Well, that's small enough to be the weapon.
He could still be in there.
Did you hear the one about the cop and the monkey who walk into a bar?
Neither was the monkey.
Hmm. This is a .25 caliber.
We found a .22 in the victim's car. This just ruled that out as the murder weapon.
This could help identify the firearm.
This is an unusual point of entry.
Shooter would have to be standing over her.
So ... maybe she was kneeling.
Metals.
So you're saying our killer has metal balls?
Well, you can't track a static location. It has to be something mobile.
You were right. We found a GPS transmitter under the rear bumper of the girl's car.
Okay.
I got a problem in DNA.
First things first.
Well, it's unlikely that they're connected.
Cross contamination?
We don't have any choice. It's potentially all contaminated.  Document everything. 
Mr. Novak ... do you recognize this telephone number?
Did you write it on the matchbook?
Why didn't you write your name on it?
Why not your home number?
This is Alice Granger. Do you know her?
What else should we ask him, Catherine?
Yeah, but you didn't, so now I'm way behind. Is he telling the truth?
He hit you.
You have to recuse yourself from processing evidence. This guy's a lawyer. He could claim prejudicial treatment. Your whole life will become public record.
We all live in glass houses, Catherine. You gotta be careful where you take your shower.
Mr. Novak, would you stick out your tongue, please? 
Well, right now, it's about his tongue.
Open up, please.
Uh-uh. Once more.
Thank you. That's all I need.
You figured out the source of the contamination?
You have to collect everyone's swabs.
How long till the new shipment gets here?
I don't know, Catherine.
How many times have we heard a public defender say that?
I guess that's why I don't go out.
Well, out this far, it's probably a body dump.
Yeah, but he had a choice.
Yeah, David, shoe prints, tire treads -- all they are is ...
Looks like she was branded.
Maybe she was undergoing some kind of medical treatment.
What's in this?
Abortion?
Infection?
They're all abscessed.
What, some kind of flesh-eating disease?
Maybe the puncture wounds were used to put something in, rather than take something out.
Good. I'll come with you.
Who's that?
Freud, Goethe ... 
Rilke ... in German. Briefe an einen jungen Dichter.
How do you know she was at Harvard?
This looks like an appointment. 'Betz, 11-12, 7:00 P.M.'
Heterochromia. It appears Zoe had one blue eye and one brown eye.
Hi. I'm so sorry about your loss.
I'd like to know some things about your daughter. When was the last time you saw her?
So you weren't in contact with her?
Can you tell me why?
Did she have any medical conditions?
Because in November, she participated in a medical study at the Betz Clinic. Right after that, she went missing.
In the desert.
Off highway 55, near Sparks.
How many other people in the sleep study?
Zoe's car was found at an impound lot downtown. It was towed from Betz's parking lot on November 15th.
With Captain Jack?
'Left early' seems to be a euphemism.
Are you and Mr. Wolfowitz acquainted?
Why were you at his house?
Is that why we found this etching in your handbag? You were stealing it?
Why?
Which are?
However, if he refuses to press charges ...
Someone with something to hide.
Why, uh, steal this?
So?
So you think he stole it?
Even if all this is true, we still don't know if he killed your daughter.
You have to stay away from him.
Is that an acidic compound?
So it is from a manuscript? 
Even if this tests positive for DNA, I'm gonna need the book to match it.
Rambar checked the rare book collections. This guy likes to steal in his own backyard. UNLV library is missing plate 62. It's enough for us to get a warrant.
I guess I didn't need a warrant.
No signs of trauma or blood.
He's wet.
Looks like he's in rigor, which means he's been dead for at least six hours.
Still frozen? 
How long does it take to freeze an entire body?
Over the glands, too?
Test subject #1.
So what? They dunked him in liquid nitrogen? Cryogenically froze him?
You've got to find some explanation.
What are you doing here?
I'm listening.
And you didn't want him to screw it up.
Did she have her baby?
How did you get this?
When did you ...
He's already dead.
He's been dead for two days.
Her hand.
Thanks.
Revenge is an act of passion.
Who?
Looks like Wolfowitz, only younger.
Identical twins.
Same DNA, different prints. So all the DNA that we attributed to Wolfowitz, could be Sneller's.
Occam's razor, principle of parsimony. If you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not zebras.
Well, this isn't a torture chamber, it's a time capsule. 
Well.
It appears he was meticulously documenting experiments. This one looks like it deals with craniometry. I think he was measuring skulls to determine intelligence.
Work will set you free. These words hung over the gates at Auschwitz.
No numbers.
This one's dead.
Have you guys secured the entire perimeter? The house and the barn?
Heather! Stop it!
You cannot do this!
No! 
Stop.  Heather.
I'm saying stop.

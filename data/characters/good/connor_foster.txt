Yeah. I'm sorry I'm late. I got lost. 
Oh, this is messed up. This is really messed up. 
Whoa! She just moved. Did you see that? 
I'm telling you, she just moved.
That's not her. This lady's too thin. That's not her skin, either. My aunt always wore sunblock.
Huh?
I got to go.
At the YMCA off industrial, near the underpass.
I don't have a job. I used to.
She dropped those charges.
I don't call her much. We only have dinner on holidays. Whenever she sees me, it makes her kind of sad.
When?
No, I go for burgers. Sonic.
I'll do whatever you guys want.

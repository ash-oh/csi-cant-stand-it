I just spoke with McKeen. I heard it's bad.
The last train passed through here an hour ago. The engineer thought he saw a body on the track, but couldn't stop on time. He radioed dispatcher, who called 911.
Well, the engineer isn't saying anything else until his union rep gets here, which ... could be a while. I'll let you know.
Colonel Caleb 'C.C.' Carson. 1864.
These are civil war-era photos.
They didn't smile much back then.
Bet these hurt more.
It's the same caliber killed the vic.
Warrick just called from the hospital. They got the bullet.
He hasn't regained consciousness yet.
Is this Gettysburg?
My dad was. Used to spend the summer touring Pennsylvania in an RV, so I could learn things.
Looks comfortable.
How do you mean?
That's right. They were on one of Mr. Carson's corsets.
What did that entail?
So, you dressed him in rebel drag.
Did it hurt?
When was the last time you saw him?
At the house.
A duel? Where?
If all you do is Civil War recreations, why were you and Caleb Carson having a duel?
A man shoots you, and you don't call the police?
What about him?
Am I interrupting?
I just got a heads up from a friend in Payroll at PERS. Ellie Brass just called about Jim's pension. She wanted to know how much there was and was she a beneficiary. 
This girl is circling like a vulture. Jim doesn't need this kind of energy around him now. Now ... Ellie's been in a lot of trouble with the law. It wouldn't be difficult to chase her out of town.
I can think of one.
Depends on where you lose it.
Mr. Kimble, would you like to revise your prior statement?
Which part?
If it was an accident, you should have called 9-1-1.
Excuse me, have either of you two seen Grissom?
Hey, Catherine. Grissom, Ecklie's been looking for you. Is your cell not working?
Well, apparently, I was a CSI, then a detective, but now I'm a messenger. You're needed at the lab ASAP.
I have no idea. But the undersheriff's camped out in the break room.

: I'm up 1,500.
We've been blessed.
What? Hey! Stop it!
Let me ... let me go!
Let go of me! Stop it!
What?
Walter! My name is Walter!
What?
It's mine!
Yes, this is my sweater!
Huh?
Wha-- ?
No! No!
It's not my sweater.
Finders keepers. It wasn't always mine, though.
On a bench. By the basketball courts.
I was cold.
I'm not lying. I'm not lying!
Yesterday. No, um, a few days ago. I don't remember.

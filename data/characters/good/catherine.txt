Please. Cream with some of that fake stuff.
Hey, how's the body with the bugs?
What do you have for us?
Missing since last night. Last seen at home of Richard Zeigler in - ooh -- Summerlin.
Bye.
Is everything okay? You've been quiet all night.
I don't believe this.
Yes. He's pissed off because I won't let him back into my life so he sics Child Services on me.
I never expected they were going to talk to my friends. Well, what did they ask? What did you say?
Hi. Sir, we're with the Las Vegas Crime Lab. We're here about a Paul Sorenson.
Thank you.
Sorenson is a painting.
How dumb are we?
Right on.
Why don't we dust for prints?
Oh, yeah. Inside job. 
So ... was it a disaster with Child Services?
Well, my job does take me away from my daughter. Nobody knows that better than you.
Well, not intentionally.  They just, you know, know how to ask questions.
We're working on it, sir.
How many people have access to your home -- keys and security code?
Can you get them all here? They might be able to help us with evidence.
Helix, antihelix, helix rim, tragus, antitragus.
Come on. An earprint?
Yeah, I know, I know. I'd like to see that one on appeal. Well, photograph and lift. We'll have someone to compare it to soon enough.
It's just like a fingerprint ... for your ears.
Well, there's no forced entry. Someone shut off your alarm. That tells us that we eliminate the family first before we widen our investigation.
Thank you, sir.
You're a good sport.
We got a match.
What do you think?
Jason, do you still have the painting?
Well, that would be selling stolen property and you would be arrested, no matter what your dad says.
Thank you.
Nicky, how's it going?
If only her artwork brought in this kind of dough I wouldn't need to worry about her college tuition.
Keep walking.
Okay, now I know that these are rich people and it's just a painting and nobody died, but ... this just doesn't feel finished.
I know.
Court.
Yeah.
Hey, Warrick. Are you going to tell me?
About Child Services?
Really?
I was reading up on Sorenson, and I found a site that says that 15% of all museum art is fake.
You're so right, but if this is a forgery, we've got a new crime.
So, an authentic Sorenson would be titanium-free.
Okay, so if the owner purchased this painting from a reputable auction house, they would have run a similar test to this?
This kid's in college, right? Let's check his dorm room.
Hello, Mr. Zeigler.
Yes.
We'd like to ask a favor of you Mr. Zeigler. A private viewing of the painting.
Robbery checked with your school. They actually teach classes in how to copy the Masters.
But, the other night, his little scam was interrupted.
The police are going to want to know if you're pressing charges this time.
Yeah.
Hi.
Whoa, somebody likes their job.
Ex-girlfriend, Nick?
Oh, no. What are you going to do?
Heavy pastiosity?
Grissom.  I've got something you'll want to see.
You know how you're always pushing that holy trinity stuff?
Victim, suspect, crime scene.
Right. Well, we don't have a victim. We don't have a suspect. All we have is a crime scene -- the restroom at Marty's Market with the message, 'I killed five women.' So, I figured there had to be four others.
No. I found the four other crime scenes.
Brass ran our case through VICAP. 
I made a few calls ...
Five stall doors from five supermarket rest rooms. Five missing women, including Margaret Shorey.
Just like Marty's Market -- there was no physical evidence indicating that the women were killed there.
Interstate 15. God knows I've driven it enough times.
I'll flip you to see who drives.
Moapa.
Besides the I-15?
You two ladies done talking? It's hot out here.
Well, it's not Margaret. This one's a blonde.
Missing woman number one -- disappeared from a supermarket restroom last July.
I-15? Refrigerated?
What's his problem?
Brass got us a list of all the refrigerated trucks that made deliveries to the market yesterday. 
There's a female trucker on it.
Do yourself a favor.
'I've got a kite. Can you see the women? Kill the lights.'
Three times.
Caucasian female with only a high school education and left-handed.
I'll be right back.
She's not the one.
The right to keep on trucking.
Well, Ms. Hard-ass travels with her boyfriend. I bet you a lot of guys travel with their girlfriends.
No.
Eliminate all trucks that only travel in state.
Now eliminate the trucks that don't deliver to supermarkets along the I-15.
That's our guy. He delivered to all five towns -- all five supermarkets.
We got three.
Try this.
We're going to take you home.
Am I disturbing you?
Good.
Here they are.
Give him a perfect ten or your ass is out of here.
The prisoner plea. Brass told me about the video.
Wait a minute. Ecklie was the CSI on that arson. I see a bad moon rising.
Only if they're of equal rank and they're looking for trouble.
Yeah.
Hey, O'Riley, anyone put their meat hooks on this vehicle?
Still got to ask.
Just a baby. 
Tap city. Empty.
Killer was probably in the back seat waiting for him. 
Kid never stood a chance.
Maybe he was deaf.
You hungry, Nick? Got a burger. Extra lettuce.
'Giants ... negative nine.'
What does a kid doing walking around with a wad like that betting thirty grand on a football game? Who wrote the ticket?
So, it was found with the kid killed in your parking lot.
A runner?
Kid wasn't a day over sixteen. Isn't that illegal?
Well, does 517 have a name?
Well, you've been very helpful. Thank you.
Mrs. Hillman? Is this your son?
Mrs. Hillman? Was your son hearing-impaired? Joey was wearing a hearing aid.
I don't know.
Danny?
Well, the police will want to talk to your son Danny.
Well, that's more than a little something.
So, who was your boss then?
It's illegal to use two-way communication in the sportsbook.
You like the Lakers today?
So do I.
From a sneeze.
Mm-hmm, with the sniffles.
So what is the DNA like in mucus these days?
Thanks.
Oh, hi, David. What's up?
Detective?
Yeah, thanks. Did you call Nick?
Well, I can see why you ran.
You guys don't even know who your boss is, do you?
Danny ... do you have any idea who shot your brother?
Oh, one of you is going to win a trip, all right. Everybody clear this is voluntary?
So everyone is clear.
Yeah.
Well, if you're that confident it's not one of your guys you must know who it is.
Head back. 
Okay. You're all free to go.
Oh, these fire guys really know how to trash a crime scene.
It's not the size of the bomb. It's the overpressure in the air around it.
A perfectly symmetrical amputation. Means he was looking directly at the bomb when it went off.
Uh-huh. 
Gunpowder.
I'd love to.
Seat of the bomb is here. Victim was thrown ... three meters. His clothes are torn but not burnt, indicating a low-velocity propellant -- 6,000-
Time will tell.
Bombs explode. Weird thing is their components survive the explosion. If we can piece together this bomb, we're closer to finding who did this. So, Warrick, when you're photographing this debris can you, uh ... ?
F - P - 
Well, are his initials 'F.P.'?
I found this near the point of origin.
Whoever did this is playing with us.
Yep.
Vacuum effect. The air is being pushed out so fast ...
... when the bomb detonates ... 
... there's a calm at the center.
Well, except for when he lost his ears.
I ran it through ATF's bomb database. No profile.
Dominic the security guard? It's too soon to tell.
Looks like a balance wheel from a clock.
We're kind of busy here, Nick.
Hey, Nick ... I'm sorry to hear about your friend.
Word travels. It was the day shift coroner.
Not yet.
Bad idea. You and Ecklie ... oil and water. Just let me get into it.
If Nick's arrested. it's not going to matter that he's cleared later.
Eyes, no hands.
Look at those ligature marks.
Raccoon eyes excoriation around the neck. She didn't give up easy.
Ecklie find the murder weapon?
Did you check for fingerprints on the body?
Half-life of fingerprints on flesh ... they're disappearing as we speak.
Then that's what you report. Evidence, Doc ...  ... all we got.
Oh, hey, uh Conrad, Grissom's in the field.
And I need to speak with you ... about Nick Stokes.
Come on. The hooker was a person. Her name was Kristy Hopkins.
Nick, I don't think that you guys should be talking.
You know what? Nick's private life ...
Okay, look, I'm going to get O'Riley to track down this Jack guy for questioning. But I am out on a limb for you here, Nick. Just don't make it harder with Ecklie, okay?
I ran priors. The guy's got an '88 conviction for sexual assaults.
It's a load of crap, and you know it.
Sheriff, you arrest Nick now you end his career.
Nothing, except my gut and ten years of experience. He didn't do this.
So give me twelve hours, access to the crime scene and evidence without filing papers on Nick.
How you doing, Greg?
Yeah. I need to see his DNA from the crime scene. You have it, right?
That's my case for the next twelve hours. Ask the Sheriff.
Smart man.
Thanks, Greg. 
When did you say this sample was frozen?
These guys are all heads-- no tails.
The sperm found in the condom was frozen at 10:15 A.M. It's all heads, no tails.
It takes about seven hours for bacteria to eat away at the tails placing the time of ejaculation at around 2:00 A.M. But Kristy's time of death was 6:00 A.M.
You could be a little more supportive.
Kristy Hopkins was strangled with this sash. 
It's fingerprint-free, but the force of the pull would have scratched off epithelials from the killer's hands, right?
And can you extract DNA from epithelials?
Jack Willman has a prior for a sexual assault so his DNA is on file.
I think that you and I should head over to the police station.
Never have I seen such a clean match. Jack Willman killed her.
Hey ... hey, I'm just doing my job. Besides, if they'd sent you to jail I'd get stuck with all your cases.
O'Riley.
Get him out of here.
How long you think it's been out here?
And long enough for the elements to have washed away any evidence.
Well, it is a leg bone, and my guess is that it didn't walk out here by itself.
You see, that way, I'm never disappointed. You know, sometimes I'm nicely surprised. So, can we call it a crime scene?
Yes, professor, I, too, took Osteology.
Well, I feel it in every one of my 206 bones that this was a murder.
So we just talked with the academy. We're getting an entire class of cadets meeting us there.
Mm-hmm.
So we'll do a grid search and we really could use your friend Teri Miller.
Well, why not? She's a forensic anthropologist -- specializes in bones -- and, hello ... all we've got is a bone.
Okay.
Oh, yeah.
Stop!
What are you doing?
I-I hope you had your Hepatitis B shot. 
Did you?
Well, do you want to suck it ... to be sure?
Flag!
So ... you thinking what I'm thinking?
Mmm ... no. I-I was thinking that we have about 100 bone fragments. We could I.D. this body before the end of the shift.
Stars and trucks?
That's the femur.
That is correct. According to the book.
Hmm. Have we hit a wall yet?
Well, he was old-- there's some calcification on the rib cartilage.
Are the bones whispering to you?
Wait a minute. This guy was chopped up. That's murder.
A mulching machine? How long do you plan on ignoring the obvious? 
A 70-year-old man found in the mountains with clear evidence he was chopped to pieces. That's a ... homicide.
Thanks for coming, Teri.
I told you I was ... calling Teri ... ... didn't I? Anyway, what were you saying about hemorrhagic tissue?
And you don't bring in one, possibly compromise the case, because you two had a relationship?
Oh ... so I guess that dopey look in your eye when she's around is just that. Here's the deal -- we're using cliff notes to put that skeleton back together in there. Teri is availing her services. You said she's the best, but, hey, if you want me to send her away ...
Right.
Really?
No way. A local dentist. 
Move over. 
'Overlapping left incisors.' That's the front teeth, right?
'Gold fillings.' Well, I know that. He's got gold fillings in
And the winner is ...
Excuse me. Um ... the person's name is Mel Bennett. We just confirmed it. We're going to meet Brass at the widow's house.
Well, do you know where he is?
Is that because she just found out he's dead or because she got caught?
Oh, I don't know. These two were good with each other. 
It takes a bad marriage to recognize a good one.
Well, not even an aspirin. 
Look at this. The tub hasn't been used in a while.
Tub's the most obvious place to cut up a body but I don't see anything down there.
Give me a swab.
We found blood in the drain.
And this saw matches the one that Brass found in Mrs. Bennett's garage?
You mean Mrs. Bennett? 
Oh, right.  Reserve judgment.
But not so strong as to make clean cuts.
Well, I'm going to go check that out. Teri ...  ... You rule.
I do. There's no evidence of blood.
Which means he was already dead.
So what does that leave us?
Leaves me with a black widow.
Disassembled him? So she admits to taking an electric saw to her husband?
There's no law saying it's okay, either.
'Manageable'?
Well, Mrs. Bennett ... can you afford the burial now?
It's her husband's social security checks from the last two years.
It's also a motive.
Typical Vegas wife - off'ed her old man for the money and there's nothing we can do about it.
Right. There's always a clue except we don't have a body.
I try.
Ladyfriend? Hmm. Wouldn't know anything about that.
We are.
Digoxin?
She poisoned him.
Did you kill him for his pension checks?
Because a wife's benefits are cut in half when the husband dies.
So what do you think, Jim?
So that leaves us with one choice.
Golden rule.
I don't think she did it.
See you. 
Okay, so I was wrong. It wasn't murder. 
You want to go in with me? Give her the good news?
Sure.
I'll take the shallow end.
Can I get you a towel, sir?
Turquoise and silver. Breaks down the regionality to the southwest -- maybe Arizona, New Mexico, Texas.
Hey.
419 at the Sphere, glass elevator. You're on it.
Well, groove on down to The Strip.
I was probably saying that to get you to service my needs at the time.
Oh ...
Hi.
Private club fifty grand a year just to walk through the door.
And you're house-sitting? Or you're living in?
Could you put us in touch with someone who was close to her?
Close your mouth.
Did he have a name?
Turned on by the mystery and the s*x. I've been there.
What's with the smile?
Let me guess: You're wondering why Lacey Duvall had a music box engraved to Portia Richmond.
Maybe it's as simple as they knew each other and she gave it to her.
You know, when Eddie and I were first married -- when things were kind of good? On the anniversary of the day we first met, he'd always give me a lace teddy. Well, I mean, I know it's not a music box, but ... 
Right.
March 7, 1973.
March 7, 1956. 
March 7,1986.
She wouldn't give away a gift this sentimental. 
It's not 'waltz of the flowers.'
The seal on the door wasn't broken.
Caught in the act.
Oh, yeah.
A little late for that.
Big word.
Mm-hmm.
Let me see if Portia took her bathing suit with her. 
Here we go.
We've got a bathing suit, lingerie, jewels, wallet, bags ... I'm not so sure she's gone anywhere.
What?
Ugh. I guess now we have two cases. We've got a body without a murderer and a murder without a body.
Greg ... why don't you start the DNA profile on the tooth so that we can tell if it's Portia Richmond.
How about the toothbrush and the hairbrush that we took from her vanity?
Nothing. Hmm.
So, either she's extremely hygienic, or...
I can't believe I've been in this town twenty years and I've never seen the Liberace Museum.
I believe it.
Lovely.
Oh, yeah.
Yes, please.
Ow.
DNA heaven.
You want to take that thing off your head, Greg? It's evidence.
I wore nothing but skin.
Did you see that?
She took that fur from right under their noses.
Well, in addition to exchanging bodily fluids did you exchange gifts?
Well, according to her credit card statements Portia Richmond hasn't spent a dime since she's been in the Mediterranean.
Oh, not necessarily. Maybe she's been ... swept off her feet.
And what question is that, Nick?
Boys and girls, we've got ourselves a forgery.
Well, his name is 'Chad'.
All right, but ... I've had them on for a week. Can't account for what's on it.
Which leaves small indentations on the blank sheet. All you do now is connect the dots, then get rid of the evidence ... but, obviously, they didn't.
Suddenly a personal shredder sounds like a mighty find investment.
Me. I thought it would be nice.
Let's. I don't think a forged signature is a slam dunk for murder.
So is this.
Right, right, and we've got a cuff link with the initials C.M. Found in the bottom of the pool along with a floating showgirl.
Exactly. I mean, you know, you can change your name. You can't change your blueprint.
The Hayneses controlled Portia Richmond's bank account including the Burn Center Account but they had to stick around for the checks to clear.
Excellent question.
Uh, Brass, cough it up. Cover Nick's, too. He had that tiramisu.
Huh. Just like with Lacey Duvall.
Uh ... who wants to tell us about Portia Richmond?
Cholesterol is found in humans, not fish. So how does a fish acquire human cholesterol?
Surely.  So, you got our assignments?
This mess? You're not serious.
And why isn't the case CSI dealing with this?
And what did the DA charge?
Well, no pressure here.
Why would my bank be asking you about my employment record?
We didn't want to sell it until the market went back up and then we were going to split the profits. I can't believe he took a second out on the house. How can he do that without my signature?
I called Eddie about the loan. I got his voicemail. The guy's like ether. You going to answer my question?
All right, here's McCall's statement. If you can believe a guy who's looking at murder. Mccall says that he returned Hastings' motorcycle to him with the front end smashed up. They were standing in Hastings' backyard...
Mccall defends himself with an automatic that was down his pants.
Mm-hmm.
So, what? McCall lied. He really said that Hastings cam at him with a screwdriver so he can plead self-defense?
All right, which box?
The evidence is lost? In a murder case?
So, we know why Franovich left. He quit before we could fire his ass. 
So, you know who the DA will blame for this?
Well, now that we've exhausted all of our options let's start over.
Hi. Laurieane Hastings? We're with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
We're simply reviewing the evidence for the preliminary hearing.
You were home.
And you saw the shooting?
How long did you say they had been arguing before you heard the first shot?
And then you went out back?
Okay, thank you. This won't take very long.
She did a 'fill-in' back there in the garage. First, she said she saw both shots, but I just asked her and she said she heard the first shot and then came running out here.
Yeah.
Right. It took me 3.8 seconds to get out here. She didn't see any shot.
Right.
So, there's a good chance that McCall was telling the truth -- that he shot Hastings in self-defense.
Right.
Right. Let's go see McCall. No one lost him.
Can you circle the area in which the screwdriver entered your arm when Hastings attacked you? 
May I exam your client's wound?
Thanks. 
I think he's telling the truth. He's right-handed. I could tell when he took the pen.
And even if he'd tried to fool us and stabbed his right arm the entry scar would have been upward, not down.
Well, the coroner disagrees.
People don't realize just how many sets of hands a piece of evidence passes through. Losing evidence isn't about anything sneaky. It's just human error.
Yeah, tell me about it.
You get that loan canceled, and you do it now, Ed. Now! 
Well, this is progress. The shirt confirms what the coroner said: That the shots were fired back to front. Look at those entry holes.
Which happens when a gun is fired less than three feet from a victim.
McCall says that they were standing five paces apart. 
Mrs. Hastings says the exact same thing. So we have two eyewitnesses on opposite sides of the case ... saying the same thing.
Well, the DA's on my beeper. Would you, uh, explain this to him because I can't.
Figures. I just had a manicure.
Right.
Using the same firearm and ammo that McCall used in his backyard on Hastings. 
And according to Lauriane Hastings' statement he was running away. How can the second shot be closer than the first?
Can't happen when someone's facing you.
I think I know how we can figure this out. I saw this thing in my forensics catalog.
Oh, yeah. He's worth it.
Well, look at him. He's lifelike, he doesn't talk, and he's self-
Yeah. We make a mistake in our calculations we just start over.
All right. How's that?
All right.
And McCcall says that Hastings was facing him shot him in self-defense and he's got the wound ... to prove it.
Mm-hmm.
Warrick ... ?
I think maybe they were both telling the truth. 
Hey, baby.
He is?
Ed ...
Uh, I'll see you in a bit, honey. 
You set me up. Again.
Get over here.
You are so pathetic.
Just so pathetic.
Sucking up to our daughter 'cause I caught you robbing me.
No s*x is worth you, and you are not taking my daughter to a club with one of your music whores.
It was a job, Ed and it supported you, just like every job I've had including this one!
You're such a bast...!
Let go of me.
Just get him out of here.
Well ... bear with us.
I'm Hastings. I stab McCall in the right arm.
And Hastings charges again. This time he lunges at his midsection.
He shoots from two feet according to our firearms range test and the unburned powder on the victim's clothes.
The first shot is fired in self-defense. But then McCall shoots Hastings a second time. Now that shot ...
... Was not in self-defense.
We'll see you in court, Sam.
Um, well, uh, she's with my sister. Hey, thanks for helping me out there. 
I appreciate it. I ...
Robbery interruptus?
One way to beat the rap.
Can you tell us anything about the murder weapon?
Hey, Doc, you have a comb?
Gee, thanks, Nick.
That's what I'm doing although I don't think this is dirt. 
He's covered in spores. 
I think these are from a fern.
A fern plant deposits billions of spores in its lifetime. Most are just dust in the wind. In our case they're evidence. As good as fingerprints or fibers in placing a suspect at a crime scene.
Hey, you forget about the coroner?
Excuse me?
Why do I know that name?
Oh, that Melissa Marlowe. Wasn't she presumed dead?
I don't see a match.
You've got a perfect match. Wait. Is she a suspect in the homicide?
And Nick and I will cover the homicide.
He put you in the 'gray bar'? Sounds like motive to me.
He must have really pissed you off when he turned on you.
Looks authentic. Cactus Pine Cafe, Barstow, noon today.
At a pottery store on Stansberry Street. Tammy, we've already I.D.'D your father. If you don't want to see him, I'd understand.
Well, don't be surprised by some swelling and discoloration. 
You have any other family?
I can put you in touch with a counselor if you need to talk.
Is there anything you need?
Tammy ... were you at the pottery store with your father?
There's some plant spores on your sweater. We found them on your father, too, and matched them to some ferns behind the pottery store.
I'm taking these spores into evidence. They place you at the crime scene. Is there anything you want to tell me?
Why didn't you just tell me that?
Am I interrupting?
Oh, my god.
That's Tammy Felton and we've already met.
She was kidnapped 21 years ago and may have killed the man who raised her -- possibly the same man who kidnapped her.
Hey, Nick. So what's the word on the murder weapon?
Why don't you just talk with him?
Dr. Kane, this girl was kidnapped at age four. Would she have any recollection of her prior life?
That's got to be frustrating.
Such as?
Tammy Felton needs help. She may be a suspect, but she's also a victim.
Tell me about your mother.
Tammy, if you've got nothing to hide and you want me to find out who killed your father why don't you just answer my questions?
Your parents, were they close?
Do you have any siblings?
How was your childhood? Were you a happy child? Did you have any friends?
Sure.
Tammy -- Tammy Felton.
What?
Tammy referred to her mother as Mara, now deceased.
Of course. I didn't mean ...
What were you thinking?
That woman hasn't seen her daughter in 21 years. You actually thought a glass wall would keep them apart?
I know. You're not good with people.
Hi, Tammy. We just, uh, want to look around.
Tammy, could you step outside? This officer will keep you company.
Thanks.
Yellow paint.
Well, that's affirmative for uranium.
Tammy, I need your right index finger.
Who else was there?
Tammy ...
Who was with you?
But Melissa killed Joseph Felton -- Tammy's father.
Forensic psychology is a science.
Thank you. I got a call that Melissa wanted to see me.
Am I speaking to Melissa ... or Tammy?
I'm not an attorney. There are no privileges here. Whatever you say ...
The evidence is damaging.
You have a lawyer. Why are you asking me?
I'm not an expert.
Then you shouldn't have any memories of me ... Tammy. 
There is no Melissa, is there?
I'm gone.
Guard.
Hey, come on. We're going to be late for the prelim.
What? Why?
How much did the parents lose?
Right.
Brass, it's Catherine. I need a credit card purchase report on the Marlowes. The last 24 hours. Based on what? Based on the fact that the Marlowes are blind when it comes to their daughter and would do anything for her.
Look, you're here, she's not and we know that you helped her flee the jurisdiction.
Wherever you think she is -- wherever you're planning on meeting her -- she's not there. She played you. Now, if you'll just tell us where she is, we won't file charges, right?
Think about what you're doing.
Hey.
Thanks.
I was assigned. This is my case.
Right. That's why you were assigned -- a homicide detective. What happened?
Body count?
And you're not calling this a crime scene?
O'Riley ... it's a suspect.
Hi. District Engineer?
Ah. Follow the tie. 
Is that from the rain?
Are you hiding something, or am I not worth your time?
Well, you are the District Engineer of the city, right? You're responsible for the structural safety of this building.
Catherine Willows, Las Vegas Crime Lab.
Yeah. The building fell down. Three people were crushed to death. 
Why is the wood wet?
Then what am I looking at?
Drywall. But what about this layer right here?
What, was quarter inch on sale that day?
Catherine.
Don't say, 'sorry' just know who you're talking to.
It's noticeable now. Which District Engineer conducted the last inspection?
Then it looks bad for you.
Where's the point of origin of the collapse? 
Look, this is my crime scene. I can find it myself but that might mean lots of question to lots of people.
Then that's where I want to be.
No offense, but they work for you.
Well, so the victims' family deserves answers.
Somebody's responsible.
Well, maybe not intentionally, but if a ship sinks, the last person who checked for leaks is negligent.
Thanks for your input.
I'm going in.
Why is everybody asking me if I want to do my job?
And?
I know I have a job to do. Excuse me.
Am I almost at ground zero?
I feel like I'm crawling through a straw.
Sweet!
Are you getting this?
I'm not an entomologist, but I know one. He can tell us.
I thought this building was secure.
Nellis Air Force Base.
Anything else I should, uh be aware of?
Okay.
Okay. I'm in the laundry room ... what's left of it. You want to talk me through this?
Got it.
Yeah, it's wood, all right. 
And it looks like somebody took a sledgehammer to it.
He likes you, too. Now, tell me about him.
You assigned me the case. You already know that.
The frame's made of Douglas Fir.
I did find more than a bug. Dry rot, questionable repairs, a jittery Engineer. And check this out.
I know. Gives new meaning to 'home wrecker.'
Translation: We're opening a political can of worms. The mayor's involved, an election's around the corner and you could've clued me in a little earlier.
Sorry. It's evidence.
I know-- wood.
Nope.
How did you get in here?
A lot of factors contributed to the collapse. I'm focusing on the human element.
Now... if a sledgehammer was taken to this column recently there'd be evidence of discoloration. The damaged part would be lighter.
Hands off.
Yeah.
Public record? And you failed to indicate the damage in your inspection report?
Tell that to the women who were crushed to death.
Proving that you're not responsible for what happened to that building.
The damaged support column buckled. Why?
Good. We're on the same page. Now, I put a section of the floor assembly in the tank. I added a dozen or so of my daughter's rubber balls two sub-woofers ...
Exactly. Because I suspect that sound vibrations may be the ultimate cause of the collapse.
No, but, uh, maybe F-16s and whatever else they're flying out of Nellis Air Force Base.
Now, I ramped up the decibels on the stereo to maximize the vibrations.
Watch the bouncing balls. 
The nails are rotating. Like screws. Righty, tighty. Lefty, loosey.
Multiply that by 50 years of flybys.
No. You point one finger there's always going to be four pointing back at you. Beetles, sabotage, dry rot and time.
Yes. 
Anything you want to say to me?
You're welcome.
Oh ... god.
Yeah, considering there's only about six billion people in the world ... ah, thanks.
We want this one.
Right. 
Hey, remember about three months ago I applied to the American Academy meeting in Chicago? Well, the deadline for your approval is end of shift today.
There's important papers to be presented ...
Thank you.
Get ready to pull a double.
I count two -- where are the others?
Hey, I know this guy.
Oh, yeah. Too many dips in the chips.
Assuming Flynn was the target, and it was a hit the shooter followed Flynn ...
... in the front door ... shot the muscle first ...
... then Flynn ...
... and some poor kid minding his own business. 
The girls were last.
... four dead. One is still alive.
What do you know about Flynn?
Any bullets recovered?
Why?
Guess he got off easy.
I.D.?
Just keeps getting better. Someone notify the husband?
How far along was she?
She knew.
Need help with the measurements?
Shooting occurred around closing time. Is it customary for your employees to close up?
Grissom!
Grissom!
Grissom!
About what it's like to be deaf?
Sara told me that you spoke in sign and now you're putting plugs in your ears.
Mm-hmm. Is that why you forgot about the conference?
You missed the deadline. No Chicago for me.
This is the one meeting I needed to attend. I don't always want to be second banana. I can probably do your job. I know that I can do Ecklie's.
Make sure to submit the paperwork by the end of the day.
Well, I knew you'd forget so I upped the deadline -- gave you a buffer. Don't forget again.
Frankie Flynn.
Why don't you tell us about your CCW permit.
What kind?
Talk to me.
Bobby?
Well, what about the breach-face marks on the casings?
Hmm. 
Well, well ... looks like you got zip.
So we have no statements or physical evidence indicating it was a hit on Flynn.
Yeah ... why?
Not yet. 
Nick?
Headphones.
Ricochet. Through and through.
Flynn was closest to the door.
Me, too.
What if the shooter was here when he shot big Al?
If the shooter walked through the front door.
Erin McCarty-- the employee who was supposed to close up.
If she was headed towards the parking lot, how do you explain this ricochet?
The ricochet went out into the store.  There's no hole in the door. There's no hole in the door 'cause the door had to have been open.
He shot toward the parking lot first and then toward the front of the store.
So who was in the line of fire? What if we have it backwards? What if ... the shooting began back here ... with Erin?
The target was Erin ... the pregnant girl and the rest was damage control.
Twenty-year-old girl, living at home? She would have taken a test if she was five seconds late -- panic city.
Well, it's not immaculate conception. If the guy was Mr. Right she would have told her folks. Which means he was Mr. Wrong. Maybe Mr. Married.
You still have the pregnant girl?
Six weeks with half of someone else's DNA in her body.
You're the manager. Erin was the employee.
Maybe we do-- we all make mistakes-- but, just to be sure why don't you give us a sample of your DNA and you'll be on your way.
A bunter tool makes a unique mark.
They're identical. You came here that night ... to kill Erin.
You came in through the back. Erin was in the office.
But Alice saw so you shot her.
You thought that Erin had locked up but there was a kid drinking coffee 
... and then things got out of hand.
Is that why you brought your gun?
The carnival case. I'm taking it.
A six-year-old girl died on a ride at the carnival over on Washington. The paperwork's on your desk.
You think I overstepped?  These people come to town, they commit crimes and they leave. I just want to get there before the carnival moves on.
She's meeting me there.
Stop.
What are you doing? That bag's been used 100 times. Get her a new one.
What if it was your kid?
She gets this one.
She looks scared. No six-year-old should have to go through that.
Why don't you go find the mother and talk to her. I'll take the crime scene.
Not anymore. So you didn't know that anything was wrong until this car came out of the tunnel, right?
Seat belt's loose.
Did you check this one?
So do you strap the riders in, or do they do it themselves?
So you keep the belts loose on purpose. Loose enough for adults to get close or six-year-old kids to slide through?
Officer, give us a minute. 
You tampered with the evidence.
Spare me the hee haw routine. You run this nightmare on wheels. I found this in there. 
You sent one of your employees into that tunnel to fix the track where that little girl was killed to cover your ass?
Field test for drugs. I'm sure you've done this before.
Oh, before you came to Nevada you should have looked up the law. Mandatory drug testing wherever there's been an accident. Pee now, and don't tell me you're shy. 
Stay on him.
Yeah, well, there should be. And I don't have to wait for results to know that guy's coked out of his brain.
Oh ... crawling all under his skin.
So you did the tox screen on my carny?
Mm-hmm. So?
Great. What did he do? Try and mask it?
Oh, come on. That creep tested clean?
What?
Oldest trick in the book. Somebody else's urine. Probably keeps a stash in his trailer and that uniform was too green to look for it.
What a surprise.
Let's go.
What did you do?
If you so much as breathed on this child, the evidence will tell me. You can dope your urine change your name compare yourself to Elvis himself, but if you harmed Sandy Dantini, I'm going to get you.
No.
Pickens is a drug addict and s*x offender operating a two-ton kid magnet.
Did you take a look around that carnival?
Did you notice anything about those other rides? Ferris wheel-single cars in the open. Zipper-single cars in the open. Himalaya-group cars in the open. How come Pickens was hanging around the only ride that takes kids into the dark? 
What if he pulled that little girl out of the car?
How tall was the victim?
The water was a foot and a half deep. She could've easily climbed out, unless she was unconscious.
Spiral or straight?
Somebody twisted that little girl's arm hard enough to break it.
He's a s*x offender. He was going to take her someplace.
You read the OSHA report. How many emergency doors were operational?
He was trapped like a rat.
He did the only thing he could -- he hid the evidence.
You're going to enter this as a homicide, right?
It's a homicide. I'm going to get your proof. So write down that
I'm not a coroner. What's your daughter's name?
Oh, Mrs. Dantini. I'm Catherine Willows, from the Crime Lab. You've spoken with my colleague, Sara Sidle. I'm so sorry.
Actually, I'd like to ask you a few questions. Is it possible that someone reached into your car and pulled out your daughter?
Well, when you went in the water to try to save Sandy did you hear anything? Did you... sense that anyone was there... in the dark?
I'm not ruling anything out.
It's evidence. It's not going anywhere. Nothing is.
It's going to take a lot more than vegetable insults to get us to move.
Oh, I know exactly who you are, Mr. Pickens. And if you so much as look at me in the wrong way, I will personally lock you in a cell with someone who's going to do the same thing to you that you've been doing to those little girls.
What?
As compared to what?
I want four techs in there. Let's try to pull the girl out from every conceivable angle.
Mom was on the left. Where's my dummy? 
Forty-two pounds?
And, just like ... the loose seat belt.
The belt wasn't loose enough to yank the girl out. Forget Pickens.
Her eyes were pointing in the wrong direction.
Carla Dantini was looking left when she told me about the accident. 
When a person is remembering, they look right and when they're creating, they look left.
Call Brass and tell him to meet us at the mother's house.
You got the warrant, right?
We need to see the clothes that you wore the day that your daughter died.
No, it can't.
So this is everything that you wore at the carnival last night?
Your watch is waterlogged.
How come your shoes are dry?
The lining's blue. If they'd gotten wet the indigo dye would have bled onto your white socks.
If you didn't go into the water how did your watch get wet?
You reached for her all right.  To hold her under.
And you held her under while you sat in that car until you drowned her.
You took your daughter to the carnival 'cause 'kids get hurt there all the time'. You thought the blame would leave town with the ride. Well, you should have planned better. 
What did you actually think? That you and your boyfriend would run off like newlyweds? No kid? No cares?
She did.  Didn't you?
Arrest her, Jim.
Yeah.
I got to go home.  Thanks. Rain check?
It couldn't have come at a better time.
Sayonara.
Well, well, what a switch. You actually beat us here.
Hmm.
He's working spillover -- personal thing -- kid he knows who's in trouble.
Well, maybe we should be evaluating you.
Goody.
I'll meet you at the autopsy.  'Head'-topsy.
Kind of sounds like the daytime coroner.
It sucks.
Hey, I just filed for divorce. I'm feeling a little confident.
So, where's the head?
Man, look at those chopping wounds on the jawbone. 
They almost look like practice swings.
Definitely a crime of passion.
I could have.
Well, I'm out of here. I'm going to be with Brass ... see if I can get anything on those Victoria's Secret girls.
Now there's a start-- 'gross.' Gross negligence-- flying down I-15 in a stolen car. Gross anatomy-- a human bowling ball in the trunk. Gross details-- let's hear it.
Let me guess. You left your clothes in the van.
Sure. Why not?
Silk, silk, silk.
Water. Why?
Hey ... here's something new. 
The cousin of footprints. Sock prints ... look. That's not from a shoe. Look at the fabric impressions. The guy ran out of here in his socks.
He thought wrong.
Our head.
Well, this amount of blood suggests that the victim was killed here. Why don't I do the one-to-ones and you start looking for the weapon?
Paul Bunyan.
By the way, what about my evaluation?
They're tacky. 
Hmm, positive to positive.
Tabling the ax. Hammer time.
Um ... pretty close.
Wait a minute. Maybe it wasn't about hitting him in the head. Maybe it was about fitting him in the locker.
Exactly.
We found everything else in that shed. I don't know why we didn't find a gun.
That would explain the plastic.
I didn't? Oh. 
The victim was wrapped in a plastic sheet.
Really? Who's the painter?
Yet.
Okay, let's get right to it. What's your shoe size?
Okay ... step on the paper. 
Two sizes too big. You can go.
Okay, great. Now, Mr. Applewhite ... this time, I want you to do something different. 
This time ... run.
Don't bother. There aren't any. Just like the last time. The guy's Mr. Clean. Here, knock yourself out.
I'll tell Brass to check for s*x offenders in a two-mile radius.
So, we're looking at the same guy.
What's the red stuff?
Not blood?
So, what, this guy's got some strange chemical in his mutated DNA?
Freakiest semen I've seen in a while. Call me.
Oh.
Pertaining to the case?
Well, Sheriff, I'd say let's go to my office, but I don't have one.
Fast. I'm impressed.
This one of your jokes, Greg?
I'm sure this is meaningful.
Sugar, water, salt and tomato paste. Ketchup?
Well, does he add it after or is it organic?
When we zig, he zags.
All of which I'm sure you'll share with the FBI.
Hey ... is it so bad to avail our lab to the resources of the federal government?
I've been listening to our Sheriff. He says that you won't.
Well, no. He preferred someone from night shift and it may be more than just this case.
Gil ... learn to be more politic.
When we zig, he zags.
Starting to look like deja vu all over again.
Not?
It's there or it isn't.
Staged?
I don't think he made a deposit ... either.
I just talked with Brass. He said that Walden was having an affair with a dentist in his office.
Politics ...
That may have been the problem.
Hey!
Your door was open. You okay?
Migraine. It's been a while. 
You just don't like it when you can't solve a case or command your troops.
I told the Sheriff I'd pass.
Well, if I get a promotion, I want it to be on merit ... not because you're politically tone-deaf. 
So, our guys are outside in their Tahoes. If you're a civilian, we are.
Except we are putting in for overtime.
This guy showed up on the database.
Yeah, well, don't act like it's so simple. This guy could have gone another year without being picked up. What did they get him on?
Oh.  Suspended sentence, released two days ago. Call Grissom on his cell.
He is. Dial. Tell him to meet me at this guy's work address.
You think anything illegal goes on in here?
We're with the crime lab. Heard you just copped a plea for indecent exposure.
How do you explain your DNA on the bedsheets they were murdered in?
Any recent trick offer you money for something a little weird? Say a portable sample of your DNA?
I guess we should have known if our guy was planting hairs he was planting semen.
You all right?
Nick told me.
What position? Never doubt and never look back. That's how I live my life.
Very good.
I couldn't drive here fast enough to tell you how much I love you.
Sara Sidle?
How many hit-and-runs we had this year?
My daughter wants one of these scooters. Says she's the only kid in the world who doesn't have one.
You feeling all right, Warrick?
So this is what-- your new leaf?
Hey, relax. I'll play nice. Thank you for the offer. I'm okay. I can handle this one. 
It'd be nice if this paint transfer had just one special property.
And all we've got is some paint that's going to match up to about 20 million other vehicles.
b*st*rd.
Oh, my god. Plate numbers.
Yeah.
Call DMV.
I'll meet you out front.
Hello.
Mr. Charles Moore?  We're with the Las Vegas crime lab. We'd like to talk to you about your car.
That's why we have a search warrant, sir ... 
... so that we can look in your garage.
She died at the scene.
Is it me or did he give it up too easy?
When the spirit moves you, Sara. So, in your case, I guess, never.
I hope you can return it 'cause, uh, Lindsey doesn't want a party. 
My kid.
She isn't.
What do I have to do -- put it on the bulletin board? There is no party. My daughter doesn't want a party. Is everybody clear on that?
Six feet, I'd say.
Start the car.
Just do it.
Mr. Moore was not the last person to drive this car.
Uh, turn the music off.
Yeah.
Sir, that doesn't answer our question.
Your grandson is an approved driver on your insurance. We had him pulled out of school.
Did you hit that girl with your grandfather's car?
James. You have family? Someone you can call?
We can give you a lift home.
You know that James was riding solo that night.
It's just that we've got so much power in this job which we use to get the bad guys. Once in a while, I'd like to use it to help the good guys like Mr. Moore and his grandson.
No ... what I'm saying is that ... putting James away isn't going to bring her back. Mr. Moore is willing to do the time and the victim's family gets closure.
Yeah. I know it.
Yeah. Momentary lapse.
What are you talking about?
Oh, that. Yeah.  I'm just afraid that I'm making her weird, you know?
I work 24/7. I have no time for my friends. My daughter rarely sees me having any fun. And, all of a sudden, she doesn't want a party.
Yes. I'm her mother. She mimics me.
You're just saying that to make me feel better.
It shows.
When you want evidence, you can't find it. When you don't want it, it's as big as Dallas.
Can you tell what that is?
James ... we found a tooth chip embedded in the steering wheel of your grandfather's car. It doesn't appear to be, uh, from your grandfather's teeth.
I'm very sorry, Mr. Moore. James, I'm afraid you're going to have to be taken into custody.
I know you are, Mr. Moore. We can't let you do that.
He can explain all that to court. I'll be a witness. 
We both will.
Is this more of your new leaf?
I owe you.
So, did you have a good day at school?
They did?! Well, you have got some great friends. So, Lindsey ... how come you didn't want to have a party with them?
Oh ... wow ... well, I'm really glad to be alone with you, too. I like this more than you will ever know.
Uh, maybe when you're older.  Like 40.
Whatee?
I know it's not fair. Life isn't fair.
Femur. Strongest bone in the human body -- it's sliced clean through.
Well, that's good news.
Well, do you want to be alive when your leg's being cut off?
Well, she's wearing a wedding ring.
No. No way, use your own hand.
No!
Umm ...
Ugh!
She's a floater, Wendy Barger. Thirty-four, local, Green Valley.
Already did. Talked to the husband. Never reported her missing.
At the coroner's, I.D.-ing the body.
You confirming rape?
We need to ask you a few questions.
Is there anyone that you know of that might have wanted to harm your wife?
And when was the last time you had intercourse with your wife?
It's part of our investigation, sir.
Mr. Barger ...
We're still trying to piece it all together. A sample would be helpful.
DNA doesn't match.
Let me ask you something. Would you want to know everything?
Barger as much as told us that he and his wife were having problems. She was staying at the lake. It wasn't the first time. And what do you think the chances are she was seeing somebody else?
Very good to excellent.
Anybody seen her since Tuesday?
She had something on the side. I can tell you firsthand when you don't cheat, you don't suspect.
Not a chance.
Okay. Brass, you coming?
What does that give us?
Now tell me, why are we here?
And you know this because...?
Oh. Alone?
Do you recognize this woman?
Ordered the calamari.
Well, I don't care about everyone. I care about her.
Mr. Swelco, are you all right?
And... when she didn't, you got angry?
Scared? Why?
What happened once you got here?
Do you believe him?
Is that the husband?
We're interviewing a lot of people. Most of it's follow-up.
As soon as we know, you'll know. 
You know, eventually we're going to have to tell him that his wife was having an affair with somebody he knows.
When Eddie was cheating on me I sure wish somebody would have said something.
Who else?
New pet?
Yeah, well just keep the lid on it, okay?
If you're through amusing yourself I have some news on the boat.
What do you think?
Right. We need to find the boat.
It's me. I found it. Just South of Barring Point Bridge.
I took a walk.
It's white with lime green trim. Just like the splinters we found in Wendy Barger's head wound.
I think I may have found some skin. When Wendy hit her head. Did you hear what I said?
Blood? Well, you were at the autopsy. The head trauma wasn't a bleeder.
Damn, you're good.
Mr. Barger, why don't you, um come over here with me. Just walk over ...
Have a seat.
Oh, I'm sorry.
He deserved to know the truth.
I guess you just have to be on the wrong end of an affair to understand.
We bring ourselves to our cases. We can't help it. I knew how Barger felt. Would you just relax? I didn't give him chapter and verse.
You right, you know. I should be just like you. Alone in my hermetically sealed condo watching discovery on the big screen working genius-level crossword puzzles, but no relationships. No chance any will slop over into a case. Right. I want to be just like you.
Grissom ... what personal stuff?
Okay.
What?
Why?
There's no gas. It's not gonna start.
As long as there is one.
That's it. What's your point?
It's sore.  But you already knew that. 
It was just an accident.
Well ...  ... I guess we better go talk to the husband. I mean, unless you think I'm going to compromise the integrity of the case again.
I would love to.
He had to say it.
Okay. Hey, Warrick.
We just came from your house. We wanted to tell you that your wife's death was an accident.
Hey, you want to give us our assignments or do you want us to take... the night off?
Hey,  ... you could've turned the job down.
Well let's just hurry this up.
You really want to see flash paper flash? Walk in on a bookie.
Don't answer it. 
We've got work to do ... boss.
Did some kid off him with a silver spoon?
Where is he?
You're coming with me.
Hi.
What do you got?
With that, probably.
Yeah. Blows to the head, up close and personal. A lot of passion around this one.  How about the suspect?
A rock?
How many times did you hit him?
Miss Armstrong ... were you and the Dean having a personal relationship?
Then why did you hire him? You founded the school. It's your integrity on the line.
But you hit him more than once.
Well, you hit a man once, there's no blood. The first hit's free. You hit him more than that ...  The walls in his office look like the Dean went a couple rounds with Mike Tyson.
Will you excuse me? Officer. Thanks.
Heavy on B.S., zippo on truth.
Hell, no. I'm stoked.  We drew the best case, Nicky. I can feel it.
String it.
Wow. 
Now, there's a look I like to see-- confusion.
Cast-off from the weapon against the window.
The back wall ... void... against the back wall. 
The floor under the body?
There's an interruption -- a space where something or someone comes between the blood coming off the body and the wall.
Kate Armstrong is lying.
The blood evidence is telling us otherwise.
And when you were playing witness where were you standing?
You're sure?
Nick reenacted the crime using blood spatter.
Sure.
Okay, so this is what we've got so far on our dead dean. Blood spatter and blood cast-off on the walls. Kate Armstrong's confession, her clothes. Three void areas, and that's pretty much it. Anything else?
That's it.
The one thing we're missing.
On Julia's clothes.
We need the clothes that you were wearing the day that The Dean was killed.
Why?
Blood's funny that way. In fact, I bet there's lots of blood on Dean Woods' shirt.
Look at that void. What a beaut.
Talk about your unique attributes. What do you think -- a bandage?
Julia, make a fist for me with your right hand. I mean, count it down like so, starting with your thumb first. Five, four, three, two, one.
Dean woods' shirt.
Now, remember we said blood tells us everything? Well ... so does the absence of blood.
All because the guy was handsy? Seems a little severe.
No, no, this isn't over.
We still don't know why.
Hey, Nick.
Grissom's not always right. Do yourself a favor and think for yourself. I mean that as a friend, okay? Okay, detective, we got some more homework to do.
Mm-hmm.
Great.
$5,000. Another for $5,000. $3,000. 'Memo: Loans.' I don't think so. I think she was paying him off for something.
This is where Gris and I differ. Forensics is about more than science. Human behavior. The inconsistencies of human behavior. Yes, 'how' is crucially important, but so is 'why.'
Bigger 'why': Why did it have to come down to this?
Maybe they didn't.
A lose-lose situation.
So, what do you have for me? I could use a rush.
Because?
Because I used to be one, I'll be biased?
Just let me do the prelim.
Eddie.
According to the police report she's telling a different story. I wonder what the rape kit's going to say.
In the parking lot behind the club.
Melanie know about this?
You might want to call her anyway. She can loan you the money for an attorney.
A detective from s*x crimes has been assigned. I'm going to place another CSI.
What about her?
Hotlines ... hit or miss.
So I saw Eddie. He actually... seemed scared.
Um ... no. I'm not really sure what I ... feel.
Hi. 
Evans, I'm sorry I'm late. I'm Catherine ...  ... just Catherine. I'm a forensic scientist.
Thanks.
Yeah. 
Those bruises from last night?
Sexual assault nurse collect a kit yet?
Why don't you see if you can catch her. I'd like her to get a sample from under her fingernails.
Anything that might, show up from a ... a struggle.
Okay. I didn't hand it off.
I'm sorry, Warrick.
I know. 
I'm sorry. 
I'm doing this for Lindsey.
Eyes, no hands.
Skin samples from under the woman's fingernails are consistent with Ed's. I saw some bruises but Eddie's style has always been very ... involved ... vigorous.
Thank you, Warrick. Eddie said that she was into it.
Eddie.
What are you doing here?
You could be a detective. Thank you.
Well, you obviously made bail. Did you get a lawyer?
It wasn't all bad.
Well, let me give it a try. 
Excuse me, sir. 
Can we see your permits?
Okay, Ted.
I'm okay.
Can't seem to get off the night shift. 
If you want to call that dressed. Yeah, Evans. Hey, Ted, you heard about this thing with Eddie and April?
You mind if I look around?
Thanks, Ted.
So, Greg, what did the rape kit say?
Glycerin?
It's a contraceptive film. 
May I?
Thank you.
That's right.
Really?
Uh-huh.
Oh, I doubt it.
You would have remembered. 
So, this film-- it's kind of hard to detect because it dissolves with body heat. And, as you know, Greg, s*x can make a body pretty hot.
Which means that April inserted the film while she was still at work.
Like what -- marriage, kids?
And for that you set him up for rape?
Wait a minute. You think that Eddie's got money?
He reps some bands off-strip.
Nothing.
Morning. 
Please don't tell me that you're in trouble again already.
You're welcome. 
I don't think that's such a good idea, though.
What's to talk about? You cheated on me. I caught you. I've got a new life.
You got it.
I got the blood samples on the way to the lab.
You mean the blood swirls next to the father's body in the boys' room? 
I studied pictures of the Manson Murders. This isn't butter. It's imitation. 
What's your take?
Explains why the blood is confined to the bed and the floor under it.
Gave his life for the little girl. There should be more blood.
The first suspect.
Well, she'd need help. Maybe a boyfriend?
Linds.
Linds? Lindsey? 
Lindsey ... Lindsey.
Hi, honey!
Oh, am I glad to see you.
I know. I was just there. Your teacher told me daddy came to pick you up. Oh, you feel so good. 
Ed ... I'm working this quadruple. Time got away from me. I apologize.
Right.
Yeah. Thank you. I really, really ...
Yeah. 
Oh, god.
Yeah.
What?
You made pancakes?
For dinner?
That would be Grissom.
Ed.
Okay, I'll be right there. Just let me put on some clean clothes.
Eddie ...
She always does.
We're about to go ask her. Nick, what did you find out about that stuff that you collected at the back of the house?
But your statement says that you bent down and hugged your mother who was bleeding profusely. Then you ran out, tripping over your father's body in the upstairs hallway.
It's a little too late to start coaching her now.
The doctor says it's from trauma. What happened, Tina? Did you catch your boyfriend killing your family?
That they killed the family so they could be together?
Notes on mapping: Collins family murder. Case #00-398. Intruder killed mother. 
Father went to protect the little girl. Got nicked by knife. 
Killer subdued him as dad was entering the little girl's room to ... 
... save her. 
Grissom.
Who's asking?
You know, your department can't seem to get things straight. If you're looking for the little girl, she's already got a caseworker.
My Lindsey? Why? What are you talking about?
Is this Eddie's idea of a joke? What, are you in one of his bands?
It's me. Something's off on the map.
Uh ... I'm looking at dad's blood in the hall. I found an interesting drop. The droplet tells me that he wasn't running to the little girl's room. 
Yeah. 
I filled one of your holes, Grissom. 
The father was killed first -- then the mother. 
And the blood that we found in the hallway was from the knife.
Night, guys.
Tony Candlewell, age 30. Communications Company Manager from Atlanta, married ... no record.
I don't know but this sure must have looked scary at thirty thousand feet.
I'll start the interviews.
Sir, we realize this is an imposition, and we apologize for it. Nobody wants to see you on your way more than we do. We'll make this as quick and painless as we possibly can.
More flies with honey.
And he wouldn't let you?
Are you telling me this guy was kicking the back of your seat the entire flight?
May I see your hands?
And did you give him anything?
And, as far as you know did he complain of a headache when he boarded?
So what made the worm turn?
Right. Well, thanks for your time.
Nada. You?
I'm going to go out on a limb here ... and say ... they're hiding something?
And where were you when this was all going on, Mrs. Finn?
In the bathroom? For how long?
So, you ... slept through everything and you woke up next to a ... dead body.
All right, we're going to have to change tack here because what I said about getting more flies with honey -- I was wrong.
Why you telling me?
Well, why don't you tell them that? They're not giving me bupkus.
Shoes ... off. 
Now.
Hi.
Oh. Excellent.
That looks good.
Well, that's it then.
Okay, folks. I've got some good news ... and I've got some bad news.
Well, the good news would be that seven of you may be ... getting out of here very soon.
The bad news is that three of you may be staying in Vegas a lot longer than you planned. And that would be ... Mr. Lou Everett, Mr. Max Valdez ... and Dr. Kiera Behrle. Would you ... please come with me.
Dr. Behrle, we're going to be asking you some very sensitive questions -- questions that I know that I wouldn't want my daughter to hear.
How did you get that black eye?
Okay. 
I'm, uh ... just a little confused. Your heel impressions were found on the back of the victim's suede jacket. 
That's a little aggressive for a Good Samaritan.
And you're satisfied with that?
But you are trained to use the paddles in the event of an emergency and this was an emergency situation.
So, whatever it was he was going through it didn't look a heart attack.
All right, so let me get this straight. 2F is on the floor. His wife is in the aisle brandishing a broken wine bottle. What about 1A? He was closest to the action.
If you ask me, it's their spouses that are the dummies.
So is mine. These passengers are lying.
Lou -- the angry businessman. How about that?
Single mom. What an imagination you have.
What time was that?
Very good.
And my shoes end up on his back.
That's probably how the doctor got her black eye.
And, at this point we're not individuals anymore -- we're a mob.
And you can't perform CPR on a man's back. Dr. Behrle had to have rolled him over ... 
... probably just to cover for herself.
Well ... it's wicked serious in here.
All the way.
That's right. If it involves the protection of my child I fight to the death.
That's a cop-out. It's a simple question. What would you have done if you had been one of those passengers?
He was a threat.
Have you been inside?
What have you got?
Yeah, join the club.
Good morning, Gil. So, this is Tony Braun's house. Son of Sam Braun.
Oh, yeah, you bet your ass.  Sam came to Vegas when Vegas was dying. Built three casinos in a year. Had ties to Bugsy Siegel.
Chasing the dragon. A pinch of 'H.' Heat the foil. Inhale the fumes.
It sure seems that way.
Well, I'll tell you one thing -- if those were my dogs, I wouldn't be leaving this gate open.
Gardener said it was the first time in five years that he'd found this gate unlocked.
Last morning of Tony Braun's life? Well, either somebody inside the house opened it, or somebody had a key because this lock hasn't been forced. There's no pry marks. No metal shavings.
Who's this?
And, uh, where has she been the past 12 hours?
Right now, your house is our crime scene ... and we can do whatever we want and that includes fingerprinting you.
Thumb to pinkie.
Of course you are.
Yeah. Is Sam Braun in?
Would you let him know that Catherine Willows is here to see him?
Yeah, well, that was a long time ago.
I know, but you were married and I was a baby. It would've never worked. Sam ... how are you holding up?
: Yeah ... sounds like Tony.
Sam ... the bigger the pedestal the bigger the target.
Well, that's business. What about personal?
Did you ever talk to Tony about any of his girlfriends?
Janine Haywood.
Yeah, I do.
Okay, on the left, Braun prints we got from the coroner and on the right, gold digger prints I got from Janine Haywood.
And?
Good thing or ... bad thing?
I thought he inhaled it.
He ate it? 
Well, Braun was a heroin addict using heavy just before he died which means he was probably meek as a lamb.
And make him drink hemlock. It's a lot easier to pour liquid down a guy's throat than it is to make him swallow a hundred pills.
Not lately. We found fifty Xanax in Tony's stomach.
I'll tell you what you left -- your fingerprints all over the prescription bottle.
Oh, mind the dummy.
I figured. So why'd I bring the dummy?
Braun's shirt.
Is this part of the Sherlock Holmes Fan Club Kit?
So Braun would have been on his third or fourth balloon by then.
But when you're doing drugs, you're a slob; and when you're being manhandled, you're even sloppier. Like this.
He was 'burked'.
Maybe Janine had a helper.
That's a lot of motive.
Yep. Braun family. Long arms.
I thought you said that Ritten's wife lives in Carson City.
Or digging up silver.
Mrs. Ritten?
Criminalistics.
I don't have to ask you that question.
He's Tony Braun's brother. He's a pit boss at the Tangiers which is why his prints were on file -- gaming card.
Go figure. The more evidence that shows up the more this case doesn't make sense. We got two suspects in custody and neither of their prints are on the duct tape.
Mm-hmm.
It's been done. They're not Walt Braun's prints on the tape. Came back unknown.
Flimsy alibis don't prove murder. What else have we got?
Without Curt's prints on it.
Been there.
What've we got?
Now, Jim, that's just a little callous.
He is?
So, wait a second -- Janine, the stripper claims that half of everything is hers so that's actually more than just wishful thinking?
I just got the references off of Walt Braun gave the samples to Greg.
We got to test it against Janine.
Mm-hmm.
Are you finished? Open your mouth. 
What about the maid?
Wow. You got this whole thing down don't you?
The earring back was lost that day.
So, I guess rule number one was broken. There was a woman in the house.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
She lives in Carson City.
She has access to Curt's truck.
'Hell hath no fury ... '
If you don't wear earrings for a while the holes will close up.
You should've let your husband rot in jail. 
We lifted your thumbprint from the check that you posted for his bail.
Just like a pair of earrings-- identical.
What I don't get is ... you and Walt Braun didn't move in the same circles. How'd the two of you hook up?
It's not your fault.
It's human nature. We can't deny our feelings.
Hey, Sam ... you still got me.
Well, considering I was six months old when you guys lit the flame ... a lot of time has passed. You had plenty of chances.
Sorry.
I don't doubt that for a minute.
You're roach racing
Ah.
What do you feed those guys?
And who's ... supervising night shift?
Me? I am on the red-eye to Reno. The Braun Family is opening a new casino. I am Sam's date.
I told you once, memo'd you twice.
Better get somebody.
Do you think you're the only friend I've got in the police department? I'm just telling you, be careful.
Hey, look, we all get a little crazy when our kids are involved.
Okay. Hey, but listen. If you find the boyfriend, don't go it alone.
Mmm.
All yours, girl.
Oh, Nick, give it up. We got a death imminent to worry about.
Hand me that magnifier.  Thank you.
See those white specks? 
No, I don't think so.
Never you mind. 
Let's just get this to trace.
I gave this to trace. Why do you have 
This is skin.
Dandruff.
Had a bad case of seborrhea.
Thanks.
As long as you don't tell her it's a date.
House mogul caught with his pants on? Yeah, I'm just rolling to the hospital to get his clothes. Why?
You serious? For what?
Wow!
Let me know.
His property is part of our investigation. I'm afraid I have to take it.
Yeah, me, too. Did you work for the Fairmonts three years ago, when Mr. Fairmont was shot?
Interesting. 
You have dandruff.
It is when I'm on a case. Do you mind?
But you did redress him and place him in the elevator.
Well, that's dangerous to say to a scientist. 
Dandruff is nothing more than sloughed-off skin. It has a nucleus just like a cell on your arm or your big toe. 
These 13 DNA markers from this dandruff cell are a match to the dandruff that I recovered from your sweater. You were there. At that hotel.
Let me guess -- you snuck out down the stairwell.
Well, we won't mind if we compare your DNA to the vaginal contribution of a condom that we recovered from Mr. Fairmont's room?
Good. We'd like to show you something else -- about that accidental shooting three years ago at your boss' house.
We're thinking it was you.
Where was his wife?
So, you just sat there in the dark and aimed south of his belt.
Or both.
We just interviewed her. She copped to moving him. We're looking hard at the wife on the poisoning.
We know. Dermatomycoses seborrhea -- we got it.
She could be back from dinner at any moment. This shouldn't take long.
Shampoo full of the same poison found in Bob Fairmont's remains?
Cream cheese.
Garlic cream cheese ...
It explains away his bad breath.
We'll see.
This is yours ... and these are yours.  There's the door. We build a case before we make any arrests.
Hey, what's going on? We called the hospital. She's been released.
A dairy farm. 
'Gideon Dairy and Cheese.' Largest supplier of milk in Connecticut, in fact. Brass talked to a local chamber-of-commerce type about Claudia's husband. You want to know who his secretary was?
And you loved your husband Right up to the day he died ... of 240 milligrams of selenium.
Bravo. Ladies. You have got this down to a science.  Why did it happen the first time? Hubby ignored you or abused you or you got sick of him fooling around so you started slipping the ... 
... cow stuff into his chocolate milk? Julia must have caught you.
So the two of you struck a deal.
But the difference is that you actually loved Bob Fairmont. 
You shot him because he was cheating but that didn't get in the way of your long-term goals, did it?
It's down the hall to your right.
Well, no big surprise. We have proof of poison but no way to prove which one of them did it.
She-said/she-said defense? It's never going to fly. They'll raise each other as a viable suspect just like they did with us.
See you back at CSI.
He bled out.
So he died approximately ten hours ago.
Thanks, David. Okay, let's see who you are ... 
Nevada license.
James Jasper.
Well, you were right -- he should've been wearing his orange safety vest.
Hunter lays in wait, spots a deer. Hunter fires ...
... deer takes off ... but the bullet keeps going until it stops. 
It's got to be somewhere.
You find the bullet?
You know what the textbook says -- if you're not a hundred percent sure how to collect it, bring the whole thing in.
Nick.
Tell me what you got?
Trajectory?
And how was your husband handling that?
Mrs. Jasper, was your husband an experienced hunter?
You were?
That's cottonwood.
I did.
Ah, oxidation.
Well, we've got the wrong bullet but the case still seems like a write-off.
She bought it?
He's in the insurance business and she buys a policy behind his back.
Okay, the tree is a point of reference.
So the bullet should be somewhere between your rope and mine.
Congratulations to us. Still a needle in a haystack.
Nick.
Let's just pack it up. The bullet couldn't have gone this far.
Yeah, just tying up a few loose ends.
We haven't heard a single shot all day. Where are these hunters that you talked about?
No one hunts during the day but the coroner placed Jasper's time of death at 2:00 P.M.
Expect the unexpected. GSR on the clothing means the victim was shot at close range.
Or suicide.
Okay. But if he was murdered, we should've found some evidence of the killer at the crime scene.
All right.
She didn't kill her husband.
A pro would've shot him in the heart.
Right. But he never moved. He was standing in front of this tree when he was shot. He didn't try to get to his car, get help, he just ... sat down and waited to die.
Ninety-nine out of 100 suicides by gun ... muzzle to the mouth, bullet to the brain. But there's always just that one.
No, the weapon we found was never fired.
He shoots himself in the gut leaving himself time to hide the weapon.
How about the lake?
Hey.
Metal on metal.
Okay. Right there.
Well, we never found the bullet, but we found the gun.
Mr. Jasper committed suicide.
Mrs. Jasper, you purchased a life insurance policy on your husband in which you are the sole beneficiary.
We have the actual application for the policy with your signature.
Your husband staged his death to look like a homicide. As a beneficiary, if you knew of his intentions to take his own life, that would constitute fraud.
Hi.
You want to explain this?
Because he knew that if he had bought the insurance himself it would've sent up a red flag.
Long drive.
Anything else?
Pete Walker, California. Date of birth: August 17, 1957. It's got to be the work of Paul Millander. What do you think brought him back out?
Hasn't changed his M.O .-- Kills men whose birthdays are on the anniversary of his father's murder.
Ready for this?
Isn't your birthday in August?
Plan of attack -- split up. Nick, take the tape over to A-V. Break it down. Warrick, Sara -- examine the perimeter. We need to know how he got in and got out. We'll stay with the body.
Anytime.
He's got stippling on the side of his face. 
No entry wounds near his face.
Wait ... wait a minute. I got something.
Hello, Dolly. Dark hair, 12 inches. Female?
Well, the vic had light brown hair so we know it's not his.
So, back to that again. Another victim, or an accomplice?
What do you mean?
So Millander planted an aged hair? But once exposed, the tag would dry up and fall off, especially in transport.
Okay, so what's he trying to tell us? That he used to kill women?
Grounds?
Nevada state patrol found the victim's vehicle here. Found the body in good springs here.
And what time was sunrise this morning?
So in that time he had to get the recording and get rid of the body.
Are we sure he didn't kill him in the car? He was shot in the warehouse. He was incapacitated in the car.
Grissom, you want to add something to this?
Employment -- Dinners Delivered. Need a car for that.
Try Stuart Rampler.
Besides birth dates.
You mean court dates for speeding tickets?
Always the same judge?
Gil.
Any chance he's got a twin?
Why, you getting a cold?
Ah, fuming.  I'll lift it and get it to the lab.
You're never going to believe who Judge Mason's fingerprints match. Judge Mason. As printed when he was sworn before the bar Nevada State Superior Court.
Yeah, we know that. How do we prove it?
Well, that's the first thing Brass looked into. Apparently, the records building burned down in 1982.
Ruled arson. No suspects ever found.
Here's some good news. Brass went to the new records building looking for anything on a Millander. Found current property-tax accounts.
Mm-hmm.
Isabelle Millander? 
It's our understanding that your child witnessed your husband's murder.
Thank you.
I hope we're not interrupting. It looks as if you're expecting someone for dinner.
May I use your bathroom?
Thank you.
Oh ... I have a daughter myself. I was admiring the old clothes. 
She's beautiful.
I'm sorry. 
Mrs. Millander we're just trying to clarify ...
So, Paul Millander killed his sister.
It's a kid's fingerprint from the baseball card.
Brass found no prints from little Pauline no birth records, no death certificate. I'm going to use the prints from the only other kid who lived in the Millander house.
Ridge analysis proof. Judge Mason is ... 
So her brother planted it?
Millander. It's a female hair.
You know, when I was back at the house I saw several photographs of Pauline and nothing of Paul. In fact, the only proof of Paul is a hidden baseball card.
Oh, this is just ridiculous. I mean, you'd think they'd make an exception in this case -- three murders. This guy's telling me that Millander is representing himself. Pro pers are always last on the docket.
You going home?
I re-read the backgrounds of Millander's victims. I think that he slipped up. You know how every victim read the suicide note 'I'd like to say 'I love you' to my mother'? Well, Pete Walker had no mother.  She died in childbirth.
So how rich is this guy?
Who doesn't?
And he hasn't said a word to anyone?
Mr. Logan ... would you please put your hands out? Palms up.
I'm also going to need you to strip.
Thank you, Mr. Logan. You can put your shirt down. Left arm out, please. 
Right arm. 
No visible injuries.
Didn't Shakespeare say 'let's kill all the lawyers'?
Yeah. Hey, can you do me a favor and drop this off at the lab? I'm due at a nursery rhyme recital. Lindsey's going to play the girl in the moon.
He got the mumps.
Mr. Logan!
You forgot your sunglasses.
Service-oriented policing.
What? 
Hello
CSI three Willows. Who are you?
Criminalist.
Who would be dead?
Yes.
Who is this?
Let's talk in the car.
You never answered my question. Who's Amanda?
Somebody does. How did they make contact?
Got your attention. 
Yeah, I heard that part. I need a drink.
We don't know how long it's going to be before he calls. Why don't you order something?
I have the phone. Do us both a favor: Relax.
Um, two glasses: One with ice; one without. Roy?
So, let's get to know each other. You first. 
You were born; you came home from the hospital. Then what?
Give me the finger.
I got to preserve this evidence.
Hello.
Let's go.
Open the briefcase. I've got an idea. 
I use this to paint my daughter's face. She was playing the moon tonight in the school play. I missed it. Mark the edges of the money. 
Do you got any kids?
One more mile.
Sorry, it's been a while since I've driven a sports car. 
Thanks.
First we need to see Amanda.
No. We need something more than just your word.
He had a shot gun. If all he wanted was the money, we'd both be dead.
Give me the phone.
We're past that. Give me the phone!
Well... according to the map she should be somewhere around here.
Why don't you give me a hand?
There was a kidnapping.
You got my clues?
I bet she loved that.
I owe you. Thank you.
You're assuming it was a 'he.' Rabbit mask. Full-beam headlights. Truman Capote voice. Who can tell gender?
Bloody nose, ecchymosis. She took a beating. Cause of death?
I'm going to head over to the townhouse check out those blood spots with Nick.
Mr. Logan?
I wouldn't advise that.
You've got to give us time. Why don't you go home, get some sleep?
This town is full of hotels.
Marble.
Kidnapper probably broke in. She made a run for it. Got hit in the face. Went down.
And you know this from ... ?
So, how did the killer get the body out of the house?
Bedsheets?
Plastic, maybe. If she was murdered here her finger was severed here where are the knives?
Clever. Kidnapper washed all the knives.
Get those glasses to Greg.
He wrapped her in it.
Greg got saliva off the wine glasses. Ran the DNA. One was Amanda, and the other a woman.
Or fight about.
Mrs. Logan, do you know Amanda Freeman? Because she called you on your cell phone the day she was murdered.
We could compel a DNA sample which would confirm that you had a glass of wine with her that night.
You tore down the shower curtain wrapped the body in it.
You transported the body to the reservoir in the back of your SUV where some of your son's PB and J made it onto the shower curtain.
One more thing. Mrs. Logan, can you hold your hands out palms up? Jim, can you hit the lights?
You killed Amanda Freeman.
Your client?
What are you saying? That Mr. Logan paid you to dress up as a bunny rabbit?
So, basically, this was a stage play written by Mr. Logan.
I'll drive.
Mr. Logan? Open the door. Please.
Fat chance. Son of a bitch. He had me completely fooled.
I bet that locker's empty, too.
Amanda broke the only rule. Don't call the missus.
Everything from that point on was calculated. 
Blood on his hands ... 
... he's the last customer of the day at the bank Acting suspiciously ...
... driving recklessly.
You bet your ass. He didn't leave those sunglasses behind by accident. His cell phone rang on cue. The call's for me.
He practically forced that money into his lawyer's hands.
Sure, we wanted us to suspect the wife. That's why he used her SUV 
to transport the body. 
And he let me mark the money because he knew that eventually his lawyer would touch it.
So I did everything in my power to help him.
Willows.  Yeah.
Bravo. 
That's right. You're short one mistress. I got to hand it to you that was a brilliant performance. But then again, any man who juggles a wife and mistress and god knows what else has to be a pro.
Try explaining that to your son.
Body Farm; creepy.
Tell that to Slim hanging from the tree.
Can't just slip a card into the deck.
Well, look. One of your friends.
Vic seem more like a hardwood floors kind of guy to you?
Yeah.
Quiet.
Bugs or blood?
I gave the prints to identification. They're running through the bases now.
Oh, it's not a John Doe anymore. Database says that our victim is Mike Kimble age 38. He has a townhouse in Summerlin. Brass is going to meet us there along with the rest of the unit. My bet says that it's the primary crime scene.
Aren't you coming?
Sounds fascinating.
Is that Mike Kimble's house?
Seems like somebody beat us here.
Where's his neighbor now?
You and Mike were engaged?
Would you mind showing us your hands?
To see if there's any gun powder or evidence of a burn on them.
We have evidence that Mike may have had an inappropriate relationship with your daughter.
Things like this happen sometimes right under our noses. We're going to have to talk with your daughter.
Jody, we found pictures in Mike's house of you posing. 
In some of the pictures ... 
In some of the pictures you're wearing a bathing suit. Do you remember Mike taking them?
Jody ... anything that he did to you was not your fault. You can tell me if Mike took those pictures.
The daughter clammed up. Seems to be in the protect-the-abuser trap. I'm going to take her over to the hospital for a SART exam. 
I've seen it happen. As a mother, I hope not.
Sara's not going to be too happy with that experiment in the fridge. 
The doctor finished the exam on Jody Bradley. Physical findings: Scarring, chronic sexual abuse. 
Listen, there's a good chance the daughter's our arsonist. She had second-degree burns on her wrist.
Right. You coming with?
Right. Experiment.
That's the girl's nightgown.
Child Services will be remanding Jody to a foster home.
Jim?
Convenient timing.
It wasn't that you 'sensed' what was going on?
I'll believe the DNA.
So, whose is it, the father? 
Voluntary man, first offense. Out on bail. Free in four. No jury was going to convict a father for killing his daughter's abuser. What do you have?
Looks as if Jody was probably telling the truth. She did burn herself on a curling iron.
Jody? We know that Mike gave you his camera. We suspect that your father used it to take pictures of you on his boat. 
We believe that he then placed the camera back at Mike's to implicate him along with the pictures.
Did you ever tell your mom?
Jody, we have strong forensic evidence against your father. But cases like this are very difficult to prove. A victim testifying makes all the difference.
Jody, if you don't talk ...
What is this?
Yeah, 12.
Excuse me. Could I talk to you for a moment?
I owe you an apology. I have an eight-year-old daughter.
Just give me a straight-ahead murder any day.
I heard about you and ... uh ... Sara.
Are you in denial? No, that's ... no, no ... way too analytical. Wow, you got burned bad, huh? Welcome to the club. I got third-degree burns from my marriage. Happens to everybody. Everybody just moves on.
But you have to deal with it. You have to deal with it first. You got to deal with it before it goes away. You are the supervisor. You have responsibilities, and people are making a family around you whether you like it not, whether you give them permission or not. We don't have to go to the Grand Tetons together, just ... every now and then you got to lift your head up out of that microscope.
Well, I guess is must be from the third period. Looks like that other team worked him over pretty good.
So, why did you move the body?
Then Mr. Rivers was still breathing?
Did you also do the stitch work?
So, if he'd listened, he'd still be alive.
What do these guys play for? A little money? Imitation Stanley Cup?
And the joy of kicking ass. You are...?
Is that how you lost the, uh...? The sit spin? 
Which means?
That why your guy ended up dead?
Usually does.
What'd you get from area 51?
Every fire needs a match. So, I guess this is their equipment?
Okay.
Okay.
Ms. Gallagher?
Catherine Willows Crime Lab. I understand you play for area 51. Did you see much ice time during the game?
You know what? Been there, done that. Just asking a question here.
Oh ... you've got good peripheral vision. You see the ice really well.
You're a real teammate. Down the line, just one of the guys.
Any reason why?
Nice bike.
So, this is what being a stockbroker buys you.
How do men live like this?
Well, it's a cave with hardwood floors.
Well, how about a plant? Anything to makes it a little more ... human. I mean, it doesn't seem like this guy had any ... connection to anybody.
It's never a good sign when the number of women a guy sleeps with is more than the number of chairs he owns.
Well, uh, ballparking it, I'd say ... four women to every one piece of furniture he owns including the TV.
So... I guess our guy is about three things - pucks, bucks, and ... chicks.
Well, we know how he lived.
Yeah, I saw ten of them.
You got a match. To what?
So, what you're saying is whoever was in Jane Gallagher's bed was on the ice the night Terry Rivers died. 
So we just double-checked the search warrant returned from Terry Rivers apartment. There was no quinine found in the location. He never had a prescription for quinine.
Do you have his medical file?
Let me see it.
Somebody did. You can withhold medical information from your friends all you want but it's still going to be in your hospital record.
Aren't you on duty?
Hey.
Okay. How are you.
Whew. Attitude adjustment?
Ah. How is Mrs. Tadero?
Oh.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah?
Well ... I had a good teacher.
So, did you see it? The confession? 
And what do you think?
What if Kelso didn't kill Stephanie?
What if he didn't? I mean ...
Well ... maybe I'm just afraid that if I accept that he killed her that it's over, and Stephanie's really dead. 
I ... I don't know.
The evidence.
The statute says that once the convicted party is executed or dies, the evidence can be destroyed. I-it's not here.
Yeah, well, people make mistakes.
Yeah. Fifteen ...
Yeah. 
Yeah, that's it. 
This was my old life.
Stephanie was my best friend.
I got a gig. I promised him I'd be there. Forgive me?
I never saw her again.
Peace of mind that they got the killer.
Thank you, Greg. Thank you.
I'm taking this to Trace.
You see that?
Fifteen years ago, we figured, why light up something you can't analyze in the first place?
Priority.
Wow.
Found a third donor on the knife. Blood's from a male. Unknown.
Then you know why we're looking at the file.
Hey.
It is in the evidence log.
Jimmy Tadero. Booked two days after the murder. So why no photos?
He's my mentor. If he screwed up, I don't think he's going to want an audience.
Oh, uh ...
Some things do.
You were always nice to me, Ted.
Jimmy changed my life. And no funny stuff, just mentor and pupil. Guy delivered me into a whole new life.
Hey! Jimmy! What's the case of the week?
Mm-hmm?
Guy's spying on his ex. Has a heart attack when he sees her doing the nasty with the pool man.
Just my woman's intuition.
Yeah.
Wish I didn't know. You up for this?
This is where Stephanie was found.
Over there is where the beat cop grabbed Kelso as he was running out into the alley.
Now, do you remember where you found Kelso's bloody glove?
And then you logged it into evidence? No sketches, no photos. Just brought it in two days after the murder.
Arresting Officer never saw a glove, according to the file.
You always used to say if something doesn't feel right, it probably isn't.
Jimmy, you're not hiding anything, are you? You didn't try to make things fit ... ?
I got your beep. Did you run those tests?
From where he cut himself stabbing her?
Kelso's saliva?
Well, blood mixed with saliva sounds like a mouth injury.
Did you check the blood that Ecklie collected from the murder weapon?
Well, how did blood from Kelso's mouth end up on the glove as well as the knife?
Unless it was planted.
Jimmy. You set him up.
You don't know that.
Guys like Kelso brag all the time about things they didn't do, cat-and-mouse ... 
Good evidence doesn't need help. You taught me that one. I'm going to have to ask you for a sample of your blood.
New technology. We isolated male blood on the murder weapon. It doesn't belong to Kelso.
You were in love with her, Jimmy. That was no secret. But the ring was. 
Three karats and she turned you down. Same week she died. I never thought anything of it till now.
I'll get a warrant.
There was a shooting one night in the club and Jimmy pulls out his revolver and takes down the bad guy. The guy's on the floor, dying. Even though this was fifteen years ago, we still knew about aids. Jimmy then puts his gun away, he leans down -- he starts giving this guy mouth-to-mouth after having just shot him. 
Forget his own life, he's going to bring this guy back. And he did. 
You've been excluded on the murder weapon.
Yeah, I compared it to Ted. I compared it to every male in CODIS. There were no hits, nowhere. Have a seat, Jimmy.
Yeah, you were.
You know now what. 
You put a man away for life on planted evidence, Jimmy.
Scumbag or saint, what you did is a capital crime. You can't play with evidence, especially in a murder.
What do you want me to do? What do you want me to do? Do you want me to look the other way? Do you want me to dummy my report?
I earned my career and you did this to yourself. You fabricated evidence, Jimmy.
... because you sold the one thing a cop can't afford to sell: Your integrity. So you tell me, between the two of us who's the whore?
Arrest him.
You can hate me all you want. I'm going to see you through this.
It's still a rescue operation.
Got here quick. That should tell you something.
Parolee-At-Large.
And already over state lines.
I'm sure it was.
Fire department says the driver of the Camaro's dead.
Now that is a serious blowout. And the front left tire's still intact.
Not anymore.
Driver tried to maintain control. Veered to the left.
Putting pressure on the right front tire causing it to blow. The ... the bus then veers to the right and goes off the road.
I'm going to go see what's going on with that Camaro.
We're going to get you out of here, okay?. Rescue!
Can you tell me your name?
He's one of the victims in the bus crash. He was in the Camaro. He was driving the Camaro.
Excuse me. 
Catherine Willows with the Las Vegas Crime Lab. This will just take a second. Can you tell me your name?
Eric?
Eric Kevlin, 32. He was a resident at the UCLA Med Center. He was on his way to Vegas to surprise his girlfriend.
But he's rescued. Given a second chance on life. and, uh ... he signs this.
It's a pre-op DNR.
Hey, Nick. We making any progress?
We checked Kevlin's property at the hospital. There's no wallet. 
Literally.
Yeah, that's him.
Nice-looking girl.
He said he wanted to surprise you.
Is there any reason why Eric, in a medical crisis would refuse resuscitation?
Chloroform in the tire?
23 passengers, plus the driver.
Whoever tampered with that tire was playing Russian roulette with people's lives.
Right. You look hard enough everybody's got a skeleton.
Tracey Logan? Seat 8-B? Her boyfriend was Eric Kevlin, the camaro driver. He was a doctor. He followed her from L.A. They had an argument in Barstow. 
Wait a minute. Eric Kevlin was a nervous boyfriend. He wasn't a criminal.
I'll check for residue.
Listen I scanned Eric Kevlin's car and clothing with an ion detector. There was no chloroform. He was clean.
Any chance he was in Barstow yesterday?
There were security cameras behind the counter but none of them were pointed out here.
Forget about getting a usable print off that airhose.
Your prints were on the bus.
Front right wheel hub.
Uh ... Mr. Nolan, have you handled any chloroform lately?
You mind?
Would you turn around, please?
So, you figured, 'I'll just blow a couple of his tires.'
Well, I'd hate to be a juror on a case like this.
Reckless disregard for safety and human life mitigated by bad bolts.
Reading my mind.
It's definitely not blood. Wrong color, texture.
It's hair dye.
Who called it in?
There's no sign of forced entry. The bathroom window's nailed shut.
Dog bed, dog bowl, dog food ... no dog.
Triple locks on all the doors. Every shade drawn. State-of-the-art alarm system. As far as we know her place was perfectly hermetically sealed until the cops batter-rammed their way in.
So, how did he get in?
Keeps the sunlight out. GRISSOM: Keeps the eyeballs out, too.
No. I got it.
Tweeze me. Thank you.
So, what do you think?
No, I've seen them this thick.
Yeah.
Oh, and don't forget what's under the bed.
Something that you would have caught eventually ... 'Crime Stopper' ...
No. You know, now that you're a celebrity, you may want to think about getting a new shirt.
What are you looking at me for?
So, he murders her, poses her, yet he doesn't rob her or rape her.
Blood doesn't match our victim. The girlfriend of a Ricco Manzo filed the police report last night. It seems that Adam here put Ricco in the hospital with a broken nose from a fight at bar 9-1-1.
What about Jane's work history?
Medical records?
It's as if she's trying to make herself disappear.
And her boyfriend had an alibi?
Inside her house.
Hello?
Why?
Where are you?
Uh, Gil, there's a, uh ...
Right.
Then why kill her? And why ... leave all this stuff behind?
Interesting collection of toys.
Digital camera ... with a fiber-optic lens.
Digital recorder.
I'm guessing he's got microphones all over the house.
Same question -- how did he get in?
Thank you.
So. Who do we let into our homes every day?
So, we go through her bills and we see which utility companies worked on her house.
You know, Nick was alone. The Stalker could have killed him and didn't.
Not a stick of furniture ... except for a computer and a chair.
What the hell?!
Well ... you're going to love this.
Yup. Now what?
Well. Just think, this is only tape one.
Epic.
Archie, freeze it.
Do you see that behind him? To the left hand of the screen? Can you focus the pixels?
That's the 'Crime Stopper' article.
Do you think he knows Nick?
Well, we should get back to the lab.
Ex-chief of detectives. Left to make the big bucks. Consultant with security at every major casino in town and couldn't even protect himself.
And what about the rest of his family?
What about the daughter?
Assumed?
She's gone.
Found a shell casing. 
Looks like one of ours.
So where do you suppose the Chief keeps his gun safe?
Thank you, Scott.
Nice.
Still looking for that Nine .
So you think the Chief might've kept his signature piece someplace else?
Yeah.
So I'm thinking that the wife might be in on this.
What?
So, you saw a baseball cap and sunglasses.
Did you actually see the chief's face 
Any bodies, Joe?
Who is this?
What is his connection to the chief?
Catherine Willows.
All right, let's just be clear. This is a Las Vegas case. This is our victim and we do the processing.
I appreciate the respect.
Hi, Sasha. I'm Catherine Willows. And ... I need to ask you a few questions. Okay? 
My kit. Did the man touch you?
Did he hit you? Did he hurt you in any way?
Well, you know what always happens to bad people? They leave behind a part of themselves and that's how you can help us find your mommy. Now, I need to look underneath your fingernails.
You want to show me what's in your hand?
Where did you get that?
Catherine Willows. Southern ... Nevada.
We don't really work theories. Do we, Warrick?
Uh, no, the chief's little girl is with child services. We're still at the drop-off place.  Yeah, right. Will do, Brass.
Okay.
We got some tire treads on the shoulder. Made an easy stop.
I don't even know you.
Not very far.
If you're lucky, urethral cells with slough off with urine. 
The guy has B.O.?
All this because some showgirl said he smelled sweet?
Uh, yeah, we are. They picked the place. The Shore Club. Later. 
What's taking so long?
48?
Willows.
I don't understand. Why didn't the Feds put this out on NCIC?
Cover you for what?
Yeah, that's Mina Rittle.
Mina Rittle.
But somehow it got preserved in the water. My guess is the plastic was wrapped around her eyes at some point.
Adam Van Der Welk. Little girl saw a monster. Showgirl saw a husband. So this guy could be anybody.
You, too.
I'm sure he's making progress but Grissom rarely says anything until he's good and ready.
You say that like it means something.
Yum. This is where he got the idea.
Ready, honey?
Do you recognize this guy?
Look, you work the door. Anybody come in here in the last 48 hours that bought some of that very expensive tupelo this is Miami.
A limo driver?
Let me guess-- from Vegas.
We understand that another one of your customers bought some very expensive honey from a club.
This customer of yours have a name?
Well, did you notice anything unusual about him? Did he smell? Did he ... have an odor?
Well, we'd like to take a look.
Vodka.
Gin.
Sickly sweet. That's exactly how Grissom described it.
You found a medical condition.
Which I guess could easily be mistaken for whiskey breath. Hey, can you test for diabetic ketoacidosis off urine?
What would a doctor prescribe? 
Absence of c-peptide in the blood. Means the insulin in our guy's system isn't natural -- it's synthetic.
Gordon Daimler. That's the limo driver.
But the scent was still in the limo's AC system. Well, now we have this guy's address.
Who's the owner of record?
Sissy and Dylan Corwin. That's the couple he was picking up at the airport when we pulled him over.
So then maybe that's how he finds his victims -- driving a limo.
Hops over to Las Vegas. Visits the couple he met in Miami. Kills the husband...
...Brings the wife back here-- kills her.
No one's answering inside.
He wrapped her in plastic by the bed, raped her.
If Gordon's true to form, he's going to kill the Corwins.
The boat's missing and that's where he's killing them right now.
Identify the other players.
How? We haven't identified all the players.
Give us thirty seconds.
Gordon, did you drive your limo here? 
He's clean.
Like the lent you their boat?
The husband didn't die. He left us a witness and enough evidence to convict you in two states.
Nah, you got it. I'll have my D.A. call your D.A.
Thanks for yours, actually.
I always do.
Hello.
Nice suit. 
Yeah. Right.
Nothing. It's just ... unusual to see you dressed like that.
Missed me that much, huh?
Hey, O'Riley, we got the 419.
Well, good. Then you can fill us in.
You're a Therapist.
And why were you seeing Dylan?
We can always get a warrant to get your records.
Ten o'clock at night. You use your home?
Did you try to revive him.
I can see that.
Goat cheese, goat milk.
Angora.
Sheered, washed, spun and dyed. Angora's 100% goat. You didn't know that, Nick?
Yeah?
Who hasn't? Didn't save my marriage.
Rather I tell them to you?
Yeah, well, this time, maybe she will.
Linen closet, top shelf.
He resisted; you persisted. Then what?
s*x with an underage patient.
It doesn't make you any less guilty.
What's going on with you?
We're on a case.
How many swabs does it take to process a blanket?
The lab tested Dylan Buckley's blood for Creatine Kinase which would be elevated post-seizure ...
You're racing me, Nick. We're driving the same car. 
Nick! 
Nick, I'll have you removed from the case. 
You're confronting suspects before the evidence is processed. You're flying solo, cutting me out. What's going on?
I'm sorry.
Dylan Buckley's. Dr. Sapien's.
Familial DNA.
Naked kid under a blanket at his shrink's late at night and his mother's there.
Congratulations.
He was wrapped in that blanket.
Mrs. Buckley, we know that your son didn't have a seizure. We also know that you were at Dr. Sapien's house with Dylan the night that he died.
What is the blanket for?
So you wrapped Dylan up ... beat the hell out of him and hocus-pocus, he's supposed to love you again?
Somewhere in the middle of an angora birth canal?
So you pushed on him like a mother in labor?
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing?
There's been a murder here. Nothing gets cleaned.
Everything is Evidence. Policy of the Las Vegas Crime Lab. Should we call the Sheriff?
Thank you.
Worse.
Yeah. Till you caught me.
Hi. 
Brass said the victim had a can of spray paint, right? 
Paint from another source. I'm going to find out who belongs to that locker. 
And was this a first or has the deceased spray-painted his locker before? 
Well, that's obvious or a young man wouldn't be dead. Tell me what 'stick' means. 
And Miss Barrett says that a Dennis Fram had been bullied by the deceased all year. He spray-painted his locker many times always something to do with his build. 'Skinny,' 'shorty' ... that kind of thing.
Oh, I'll catch up to you.
Hey ... I need to talk to you.
It's not about that.
So how's your new toy working out?
Bummer. I know how you wanted to see that thing work.
So why did you need the expensive one in the first place?
I'll see you in homeroom.
I was what?
A bully? All right, I guess I was. But, I mean, not the kind that people want to take a gun out and shoot.
Like you, Nick, huh? 
Oh, Nick ... what were you in high school?
Dependable.
Dependable jock, Dependable stoner?
So that leaves you, Warrick. What were you?
You?
The girls didn't even notice your eyes?
Aww ... Well, what do they know? They're your best feature.
Yeah.
There's a reason. I can put him at the crime scene. Jim, can you call them from the car?
Oh ... well. I'll explain on the way.
Okay. But you'll miss all the fireworks.
We've placed him at the murder.
Proves a timeline. The alkyd particles in the victim's spray paint adhere and dry in 30 seconds.
Oxidation. Dennis had to have swiped the paint within seconds of Barry putting it on his locker for his print to take.
The janitor. 
He keeps timed records of graffiti. Job security. And Dennis left paint on the door jamb in the bathroom where Barry was shot.
And then someone killed Barry.
How tall are you?
No reason.
Grissom, we got a suspect. But it's not who you think.
How did you know?
Her perfume?
A high-end woman's perfume. It's doubtful that any other girl at the school wears it.
What about revenge for her little brother?
Wears her dead mother's perfume. Nice touch.
Yeah? Well, I smell a rat in the Fram family.
Dennis?
Well, Dennis, you haven't told us that you explicitly saw Kelsey shoot the victim.
He says that his sister did it.
Oh. At a motel with the high school coach. No wonder she wouldn't talk.
So why is he saying she did?
Hi.
How the hell he'd got up there?
You're serious?
That's a total urban legend. We're scientists, Nickie. No way that happened.
And I suppose you believe in Santa?
There's a consistent burn over this whole area.
Well, the chief said that the original fire was a class 'C.' Downed power line. Winds keep shifting hot spots breaking out all over.
Good eye.
Don't touch it. It'll disintegrate.
Hair spray. Extra hold?
It buys an arsonist a five-minute head start.
So you got an ID on the scuba guy?
Means he didn't inhale any carbon monoxide. 
There goes your theory, Nick. Good try, though. So what was the cause of death?
So, our scuba diver took one to the chest.
Hey, coffee boy. Where's my DNA? Cigarette butt? Match book time-delay device? Hair spray? Any of this sound familiar?
Did Grissom put his stuff in front of mine?
I just talked with your partner. Working this case without me, huh?
Greg Sanders?
Fissure. 
That explains a lot. Acid etching. Not bad.
Pretty smart thinking there, partner.
Okay, N-4-double oh-2, let's see what kind of lead you are.
I'm Catherine Willows, Las Vegas Crime Lab. Detective O'Riley. Is there a Jerry Walden lives here?
Are you missing a scuba tank?
So, let me get this straight, Mr. Walden. You lent Bruce Skeller a spare tank.
Well, he didn't exactly dive in the water.
Excuse me. You said that Mr. Skeller was an experienced diver. Why would he be borrowing a tank?
There used to be something here.
Interesting furniture. What is that, ash wood?
Is that what the coffee table was made out of?
Where is the coffee table?
I, uh ... ... think it needed a little more than that.
Did you bring the file? Well, there goes the foreplay.
Well, I know how you love a challenge. So, what'd the property sell for?
Whoa. Excuse me?
Hmm ... Capitalist's wet dream -- buy low, sell high. So they played it smart.
You can say that again.
I'll see you.
What about the land deed, Ronnie?
What can you testify to?
No.
Where'd it go?
What does it mean?
I'm going to forget that you called me that.
So, you've done your job. I got to go do mine. 
These ash wood splinters are from scuba guy's back?
They only get us something if they match Walden's ninja coffee table.
Radial chains align. Pores match. Two pieces of ash wood, one source. So, Walden and Skeller get into an argument probably over their land.
Walden pushes Skeller he falls back onto the ash wood table.
Which escalates to a punch.
Plenty. Why don't we just start from the beginning. Bruce Skeller didn't die in any fire. He was killed at your house.
He didn't pick up any ash splinters from that forest. It's all Telarosa and Oak out there.
You drove out to the lake, dumped the body ...
... and lit up. 
Not 'cause you wanted a cigarette. You lit up with a purpose.
You figured the fire department would label it a hot spot -- relate it to the original fire and the body would just burn up.
Yeah. Got to love this job.
'D.B. ... Mediterranean Casino ... Women's Spa.'
A young woman, healthy, just reading a magazine and all of a sudden she DFO'S?
Hey, Brass ... you touch this body?
Well, it looks as if the sash may have been tied by somebody else.
Miss ... you know anything about redressing the body?
Did you move the body here, too?
Actually, it is.
Ms. Marita, did the deceased use the jacuzzi facilities this evening?
It's, uh, not uncommon to drown in a jacuzzi. Hair gets caught in the whirl a person gets dragged under. The hotel wouldn't be considered unsafe.
Oh, I hope that's Shelley Danvers the woman from the hotel spa.
Well, it's about time. You guys finished with day-shift runover, huh?
Yeah, well, the victims' families hate it when we don't.
Good morning.
She didn't drown?
Anything probative?
From?
... cover-up. 
Brass, I need you to get records from that hotel spa -- a warrant, if we need it. Yep, that's right. Bye.
Yeah. Was our girl staying with anyone at that hotel?
We need someone to give us the truth about last night.
And you can verify that when Shelley went to the hotel spa last night, she was going to use the dry sauna?
You said you have proof that Shelley used the dry sauna.
Hotel surveillance would love that. You're sure she used that phone to make the appointment?
That's okay, 'cause we do. ESDA can read this blank paper ... see what's written on it. Up to 14 layers.
That's Miss Danvers' handwriting. We confirm that.
So, Shelley was in here from 8:00 until ... what time did you call 9-1-1?
You moved her into the locker room? Put the robe on her?
From negligent homicide.
I'm up for a shower and tucking my daughter in.
I thought we solved this case. What'd you get?
Don't ring her bell till we re-examine our case.
But the stroke covered up an underlying medical catastrophe.
She went into anaphylactic shock. Coroner says some of the indicators are the same as a stroke: renal failure, cerebral edema.
Because she didn't order it; you did.
We've got a machine known as the ESDA machine which can read pen imprints. 
Well, the machine isolated this. 'Jeremy, drinks, 10:00.' Shelley made that date. That's her handwriting. Were you in the room when Jeremy call?
Well, her allergy kicked in in the sauna under the worst possible conditions -- 
... trachea... larynx ... tongue swelled. 
Oh. You're going to be getting a call from the local papers about spa safety.
We had a victim die of an allergic reaction at the Mediterranean. Some foul play ... some negligence.
That it was an isolated incident ... that in no way should it be a mark against The Strip's other fine hotel-casinos.
Bottom line.
I think we got a van full of tools we can't use. Sand's a nightmare.
You get these haikus out of a book or do they just come to you?
We grab a trowel and some fine mesh screens and we just pretend like we're panning for gold ... Master.
I'm thinking trade-in. Some lowlife gets tired of beating on the old model so he punches her ticket and starts shopping around for a version 2.0.
Not to mention some serious breast augmentation. That is not a Tijuana boob job. Those puppies are top-of-the-line
... at least we've got a pair of saline leads.
Can you grab me one of those?
Dealer's choice.
Dr. Cornfeld? Catherine Willows, Las Vegas crime lab. I believe this is one of yours.
Spare me the sales pitch. We removed that from a homicide victim. I've got a photo.
I'm going to need her name.
I'll tell you what's a shame -- that she was so pretty and perfect and still thought she needed implants.
Trust me-- I've been in her shoes. I got out of them.
They were killing me.
No domestic has a $10,000 rack. Not even in Vegas.
How much business can one sugar daddy give a plastic surgeon?
'I'm for fun'. Right.
But she didn't drive home.
It's still locked.
Looks clean.
What's that?
Handy.
Bag it. We can get a mold and try and track it down.
Oh, there you are. Mona's car is in the driveway. It looks clean.
And you will be...?
I feel like I'm trapped in the Marquis De Sade's brain pan.
Waiting for recess.
Didn't Grissom say he found some flecks of silver on the victim's back?
I may have found the source.
Hmm?
People are just as twisted in their own living rooms. The props are different here. That's all.
Everybody, Nick. Wake up and smell the species.
Just because you never did it doesn't mean you never could.
Hey, relax, Nick. All I'm saying is you're human.
There's one thing you learn on this job is that human beings are capable of anything.
We don't technically have a warrant.
Oh, that's not what I was thinking. How much does this place clear a week?
I'm not with the IRS.
I don't make that in three months.
Plus, the outfits are cooler. 
You got a good thing going here. And the best part is that these guys think getting slapped around and getting humiliated is their fantasy.
You got a daughter?
Really? Mine's seven.
Yeah.
All my mother ever said to me was 'Cash up front.'
I take that as a compliment.
Well, death is still a man's business and I don't have to tell you about police work.
By knowing myself and working hard ... and by not taking any crap from powerful jerks who are used to giving it all day long.
These are the masks and straws I took out of the sink at Lady Heather's.
Oh, nice. Mmm. Yeah, that's the idea, Greg. Two straws per mask.
And not much more through straws.
Actually, I've got the yang and you've got the yin. This is as far as our watch will go. So that's on her wrist. No air bubbles. Good job.
Hm-mmm. That's from the trash can.
Wow. Looks like there's a few carats around that bezel. And the band. Major bucks. 
Oh, and, uh, computer graphics system keyed up the video system. Just hit it.
Yin and yang. Top and bottom. It's definitely not a man's watch, but unique.
Well, are you missing any personal property? Jewelry? Small valuables? A watch, perhaps?
Before you do, Mr. Nelson, in the last year, did you buy a diamond watch at Maarten's jewelers at the forum shops?
Why do men always make everything look so tough?
A $20,000 watch and he didn't discuss it? He's lying.
He tried.
Did you order a $20,000 custom made watch from a jeweler at the Forum shops?
No. We'd just like to see it.
Is that the trip you look to L.A. with your boss, Ronald? Let me refresh your memory. You shared a suite. Very cost-effective. What'd you save there, two-three hundred dollars?
Sometimes, that's all it takes.
Latex. Like Hansel and Gretel, we just followed the bread crumbs all the way home.
Too late.
Played in any sandboxes lately Mr. Nelson?
Mr. Nelson, you're very emotional right now. Why don't you just take a moment collect yourself. Let me get you a glass of water.
Psychologically, she was a surrogate. In fetish club terms, she was a slave. Cameron would put a mask on her face and cover her body in liquid latex.
Cameron couldn't dominate you, so he dominated Mona. Only his last appointment, he got carried away.
I just realized that you and I have a very healthy relationship.
Well, when we have a problem, I don't paint Greg Sanders in latex and stick a straw up his nose.
Gil ... you're supposed to say something revealing back to me.
Can you imagine living out here?
Peaceful? The town just lost five percent of its population.
Yeah, in a population of 20.
What's the rush? Crime scene's not going anywhere.
Not an expectorate. Potato. Blown to smithereens.
Now, why would an assailant need silencer way out here?
We just got the call. The place is open 24 seven. Why'd it take so long?
But now without getting his picture taken first.
You're joking.
Real or fake, it didn't work.
Hey, don't knock it. It's still the best tool for lifting prints off cardboard.
Blow and print.
Easy. Jump the counter.
Lay it out.
How old is the killer?
Shoe size is five, six tops. 
Fluorescent powders?
Protocol's black.
Assistant coroners is four hours late and we are stuck out here until he transports the body. And I haven't heard from Grissom ...
I should've never been sent to this remote scene in the first place. I've got seniority. I deserve -- no, I've earned the right to pick my cases.
If I start eating, I will shut up.
Since when do you care about your appearance?
Sorry. 
We can't touch it.
Oh, thank god. It's about time.
So, uh, what took you so long?
Anything on the shoe print?
Well, at least, we're not chasing a kid.
We ID'd on from the 'open/closed' sign.
No. Not so great. State trooper.
Yep. Well, I'll just beef him to his captain.
Tammy Felton.
A fugitive and clinical psychopath that Grissom and I put behind bars. She tried to play but I didn't bite. 
Her biological parents posted bail and then she bailed on them.
Tammy was kidnapped as a child. Raised by her kidnapper. When she found out the truth, she killed him. Hey, finish running the prints.
Tammy uses people. She wasn't alone.
Grissom!
You don't read memos. Do you remember Tammy Felton?
She's back.
She's been to Calnevari. She's a prime suspect in our convenience store homicide.
Just get to the point, Greg.
Wait a second. There was potato on the bullet?
There was potato on the bullet because there was potato inside the barrel of the gun.
Right. One of your armed robbers may have used a potato as a silencer prior to the heist.
Maybe.
He ran with Tammy's father, mostly from the law. 
A regular Bonnie and Clyde. Just what Vegas needs.
Same gun. Two crimes. One case.
What makes you think it's the right car?
Let's go.
It was dumped.
Detail ... pop the trunk.
Thanks.
It's Tammy.
Hey, Doc.
She didn't put up a fight, did she?
She was killed by the one person in life she trusted.
Darin Hanson stared her in the face and she never saw it coming.
I'll run them against Darin Hanson's DNA.
How did they sound?
They finally know where she is.
We found Darin and Tammy's prints at the convenience store. Hours before the heist, gets murdered.
Which explains why he killed Tammy.
Epithelials on her neck are a match to Darin's DNA.
Why kill a man for a few hundred bucks when you're about to steal a hundred thousand?
Play it again.
Let me guess. Laughlin, cottage casino?
I'll meet him at the station. Call you with an update.
You going somewhere?
Good idea.
Surveillance tape from the Tower Club Casino. You ducked before there was a reason to cover.
You forget about Darin Hanson? Your car was covered with gray dust-
And it still doesn't explain why you went to see Darin.
Darin Hanson shot Adam Brower but you might as well have pulled the trigger.
Yeah, me, too. He confirmed a fourth. Darin plus three. Just like Laughlin.
And he's still out there ... flush with cash and a .45 caliber.
Bobby D.
We need your help.
What else?
Narrow it further.
Just one. It's out of left field. About 75 miles out.
Where did you stash the cash?
I can answer that. It's all in a day's work.
A potato silencer muffles a bullet but won't silence it. You went in your gun drawn.
You should have arrested them. But something happened, didn't it? My bet, Tammy made you an offer.
They still had pockets full of cash from the Laughlin job. They offered you a finder's fee.
You patrol on 97.5 square miles. Is the calnevari mine a part of your jurisdiction?
That's right. We make the big bucks.
$250,000 turned a career cop bad.
We all do.
Body in a meat grinder. Sounds kind of 'mob-ish' except they left town in the '80s.
Good god...
One of the strongest bones in the body. Probably what jammed this grinder.
It's like that Morrissey album - 'Meat is Murder' ...
Blood's everywhere. Phenolphthalein and luminol are useless.
Yeah.
I think I can handle this.
Well, everything's pretty much plumbing. Male into female parts. Righty tighty, lefty loosey.
Grinder plate.
Blade.
The worm.
Except ... all the employees wear them.
It's 'Debreff.' 
It's a five-star restaurant. I've eaten there.
Excuse me, but you don't understand.
We know. He's dead. 
Coroner made a positive identification.
We found traces of aspic and olive oil under his fingernails. Means that he went into the meat grinder without showering. Possibly straight from this kitchen.
I don't know. Would you?
We can shut you down for hours or get a warrant and shut you down for good.
People always think that the show is out front. It wasn't till I waitressed I realized it's all in the back.
What are you looking at?
Yeah. What? Caused by a candle?
We have the owner's consent so, again, could you explain this blood?
Hey! We found blood spatter on the uniforms of several employees who worked the night that Chef Petrov died.
Macho.
Apparently not.
Lucky you.
Some things never change.
Cocaine.
Blood, coke, semen. These people were doing everything in this kitchen but cook.
Blood clot. What is that, sand around it?
Well, one thing's for sure: The blood got there before the sand.
Well, that depends on what we find.
25 knives in, and I'm bust.
Oh, now we're cooking.
It's not blood.
'Ground it up'. We're thinking that you did the actual filleting.
We have. They won't talk. Military calls it 'code red.'
Fierce loyalty to the top dog. I guess Petrov was that until somebody killed him.  His tragedy is your promotion?
I bet they'd forgive a murder, Les.
'Code red'?
Greg, how's the knife coming with that mysterious smudge on it?
Nail polish.
May I see your nails, please?
Oh. Well, I'm going to need a sample of that polish. A scraping.
Yeah. That'll do.
Okay, the, uh, three of you can go. Thank you, ladies.  And I've got a table for you. A five top. All by yourself. By the window. Someone will be with you shortly.
So that sample I collected matches the polish on this knife. 
You handled this knife.
Kitchen's first rule: Don't touch my knife; don't touch my Johnson.
Did you stab the chef?
I'm aware of that.  But when a transfer is made on a blade it's usually from slippage. Due to a stabbing motion.
No. But why don't you have a seat out in reception. Things could change.
What'd you find?
How did we miss that in trace?
Sand. Right -- for balance and precision.
Volcanic sand. Long way from home.
Never been to Japan, but I've seen this sand before ... on the blood clot.
I'm going to guess Shakespeare.
A murdered chef in your kitchen. Kiss of death for a restaurant.
Code red, in fact -- protect the kitchen.
Some people say that the most important part of preparing a meal is the cleanup.
While the fillet man disposed of the chef parts you got rid of your bloody woolen suit.
All in a day's work.
That's not all they're missing.
30 miles in every direction. Pi-r-squared. That means that we're looking at a ... 2,800 mile search area.
We're up a tree and you're quoting Poe. Give me something.
And what about the iris?
Color distinction means the body's been dead less than 48 hours.
Well, I've got foil ... a leaf ... a feather and plastic.
Seagull feathers.
But only when the fishing's good. And we got some ground limestone.
Means they know where to shop. 
We found the eye here. I bet she shopped here where limestone is used as ground cover.
The landfill manager says this is the active cell. Spotter says cell lift moves forward 20 feet a day. That puts the active cell right ... pretty much in front of us.
You are what you throw away. 
Well, this onion is our time line so peel back accordingly.
I think I may have something here!
Got a leg.
Obviously.
Okay, so, uh how hot do you think it is, underneath all this trash?
So this is yesterday's trash. Dead body. Minimum 18 hours in this heat.
Yeah, she's not.
Yeah, I think they only finished the job. How did she get here?
Heard you got to be superhero today.
Got anything on our lady of the dump?
So we've got no arms, no prints. What kind of identifying characteristics do we have?
Well, that narrows it down to more than half the women in this country who gave birth.
You're my hero, Al.
I thought, uh, disc replacement surgery involved fusing bone to bone.
Oh, well, I like those odds.
Tourist?
Yeah, every last one on storm cloud lane.
I talked to the president of the owner's association.
A return visit.
Well, that makes five.
Let's see if any of it's human.
And that's our house.
Any idea how it got there?
Do you know an Amy Ennis from Austin, Texas?
So, you have absolutely no idea what I'm talking about?
I'm just asking your father a few questions.
Divorced?
Well, we know that she had a kid.
So, what, we've got nothing?
According to Greg, the hairs and the DNA from the toothbrush are a match to the vic. What about the prints from her car?
Amy Ennis.
Well, Amy Ennis is our vic. It's her car.
Kelly Easton ... Easton ... 174 Storm Cloud Lane?
Leave town.
... Want to Mulligan on your first story? 'Divorced'?
Well, maybe you gave her a reason to leave. Spousal abuse, cheating...
Okay, you didn't kill her.  At least back then.
Could place Mrs. Easton at the house.
Did you know that she was back?
Yeah, sure. Nora, I'm sorry. I know this has got to be very hard on you and your brother.
Is your dad seeing anybody? Does he have a girlfriend?
Mrs. Easton was a brunette.
Lack of swelling, clean fractures ... she was frozen.
Skin and muscle would've lost elasticity. Fracture planes would've passed through in a straight line.
Well, the garbage tells us how she was killed. Now I want to know who.
That's what I figured.
Okay, this is all great, but, uh, why the 9-1-1 page?
The daughter. Dad did have a new girlfriend.
From your father. Diamonds and platinum, that's, uh, pretty fancy.
Why?
Everything?
Is that it?
Nora ... I'd really like to help you and your brother, but I can't unless you talk to me. 
We found evidence of you in your father's bed.
Are you lactating?
You're pregnant.
You sick son of a bitch. Did you think we weren't going to find out she was pregnant?
Oh, stop it. Your daughter.
Cut the clueless routine.
Your wife came back and saw what you were doing. So, you killed her, and you tried to buy off your daughter with a diamond bracelet.
Your daughter's telling a different story.
I'm going to nail you for murder.
More like the immaculate perception. Pseudocyesis -- imagined pregnancy.
Fantasizing. Wow.  'When the desire to become pregnant is so strong hormone levels can change, setting off all the biological signs of pregnancy.'
'Swollen abdomen, lack of menstruation, and sometimes bilateral galactorrhea.' Milk production in both breasts. Leaking can be brought on by stress.
'Emotional or physical stimuli cause prolactin to shoot through the endocrine system, ending in the mammary glands, and triggering the cells to lactate.'
About all the women in his life.
The bracelet was mom's. Greg checked the epithelials.
Nora, is this your shirt?
Can you explain to me how your mother's blood ended up on it?
Well, you told me that this bracelet was a gift from your father. He claims that he bought it for your mother.
I think you feel the same way about your father.
And then you put your mother in the freezer and you waited until trash day.
It's not a story. It's what the evidence tells us really happened.
I know. You take care of things.
And all you wanted was the one thing that you couldn't have.
You were innocent, Nora. You're not anymore.
Good defense.
How it manifested? No. But the cause?  People throw things away every day.
You think?
Okay.
Hey, guys. Catherine Willows from CSI. Could you all clear the residence, please?
The victim's well-being takes precedence over everything. Right now, this is Joanne Crooks' apartment, not our crime scene. So ... there's the door.
Thanks. Thank you. Appreciate it.
Joanne ... all the guys have left. 
It's just me. I'd like to ask ...
Well, I'm not a cop; I'm with the crime lab. I'd, uh, I'd like to process the bed sheets ...
Well, would you allow me to take samples from you?
Look, I know this is really horrible.
Washing away evidence hurts any chance of finding out who raped you.
If you let me recover that evidence, we can stop him from doing this to somebody else.
Well, then let's get him for what he did to you.
Greg ... get anywhere with the semen I recovered from Joanne Crooks' hair? I sent it back with an officer.
That's impossible.
Oh, the trailer before the movie.
Hey, Grissom, thanks for the lift.
Grissom, uh ...
Grissom?
That must be some good evidence. 
No. It turns out the semen in the vic's hair was pre-ejaculate, which, of course ...
... carries no sperm, therefore, no DNA.
So, I got this poor woman's hopes up for nothing. How about you?
Unsolved ... any of these women get a description?
Well, I guess half the problem's the name-- 'Peeping Tom.' It just sounds so innocuous when, in fact, 'peeping' is the first step in the evolution of a sexual predator.
Well, we know what road this guy's on. It's just a matter of time before he rapes and murders.
Victims' profile: Both women are single, under 30, live right next door to each other in a large apartment complex.
Uh, no crossover so far. Doreen Bainbridge works in the corporate field and Joanne Crooks is a dancer, so feels like completely different social circles.
Well, it's possible this guy's so new he doesn't even have a record.
Hey, how's it coming?
All right.
Hey, Jacqui. Grissom's print any good?
With one hand, anyway. Okay, well, that's a lot of distortion.
So can you enhance the ridges equal to the amount of the slippage?
Well, I'd run AFIS last. I doubt if he's in there; he wasn't in CODIS.
It's kind of looking like that.
Justin Lamond, 18. Non-gaming card.
Oh, and look at that. He lives one block from the crime scene. Thanks, Jacqui.
Hey.
Well, that's what he looks like.
I'll be this way.
Jim. There, that's him.
Justin Lamond?
It's a spy camera. What, you can't peep in apartments during the day so you come to the mall to sneak some thrills?
Put him in the car.
We found your fingerprints on her window.
Well, remind me to give you a medal. 
Stand up. Step down. Both feet.
It's not a match.
Three-size differential. He was obviously outside Doreen's apartment, but he's not our guy.
Try to keep it on ice.
What's up?
Yeah.
Yeah. With glass. Reflective glass.
So our suspect stepped in wet maintenance paint.
Which could tell us what direction he's coming from. Let me call my guy in the department of transpo.
Still charting recent toms?
He's a C-level man.
And he gets there on foot, from east of Avon.
Closing in on it. The city painted double yellows down Taylor Road last night. Started at 10:00 at Avon avenue. The paint crew goes three miles an hour. That puts them at Taylor and Cedar -- the victims' apartments-at approximately 20 after 10:00, just before the attacks.
Quadruple it.
Predators get smarter with every attack. It's been in the news. He may be wearing gloves this time.
Aren't you coming?
High profile case, technicalities ... that can't be why you do this, why you hang back and hide out.
Right. I didn't think so.
Supervising. So I'm listening to news radio on the way over here and they're calling him the sliding-door rapist.
Polite?
He's just more savvy. There's less evidence for us to work with. I know, exactly.
I just have a few questions. First off, what were you doing at those apartments?
Try me.
So you decide to start your search in the dead of night when there's a rapist on the loose.
Oh.
Well, Wendy did okay. Um, the problem I'm having is that those apartments there's always an availability so, um, kind of gives you a plausible excuse anytime, anywhere, doesn't it?
Oh, I like those shoes. What size are you?
Eight and a half, huh? Do you mind if I look at the soles?
Hey, how would you feel about allowing me to look at all your shoes from home? I mean, it'd be strictly voluntary.
A young, white male living in a targeted neighborhood -- I'd think you might want to, you know, help rule yourself out.
Of course you do.
Yeah. 
Oh. Uh, Mr. Reed. If Wendy attacked you and you're innocent, I'd think you might want to file charges against her. How come you didn't?
You sure? I wouldn't want you to do anything you didn't believe.
We'll take a report.
Agreed. May I please take that swab?
I'm going to need that jacket, too.
Wendy, I can't discuss an ongoing case, but what I can tell you is if we're going to get this guy, it'll be because of what you're giving us right now.
Really.
Greg, I don't want any other cases jumping mine. This is priority.
Mm.
Unknown subject, five months ago breaking and entering, burglary.
But we do now.
How's your chart of escalation?
Was one of your original burglaries located at 13200 Appian way?
Where our guy Taylor Reed cut himself on the glass. So, we've narrowed the epicenter down to a single block-- Appian way. I'm thinking if we find something overlooked at those early crime scenes on Appian, we can tie it to our sexual assaults.
You're the poet.
Looks like somebody is still awake.
We'd like to come in.
I'm going to take a guess here. This apartment came on the market five months ago. The old tenant was bothered by the breaking and entering, the bloodstain that you left behind. You moved into the apartment you committed your first crime in, didn't you? 
You weren't looking for another apartment. You were looking for ... 
... another victim. You got something to hide, Reed?
Jim?
Jim, we need an ambulance!
Miss, are you all right? It's over. It's over. It's okay.
You're late, Eddie.
You know how much this meant to Lindsey?
Nice perfume.
I'm sorry, baby. You did good, though.
Hey, and you know what? It's just a play.
I'm sorry, honey.
Okay. Let's go home.
You sure about that? 
Okay.
Eddie? Ed? Hello? Uh ... bad connection, Ed. Uh, I just entered a scene. I-I'll call you later.
D.U.N.S.
Mm-hmm.
Parchment changes of the skin. So what's the exposure to that window, south?
Right, all that spring break activity with the frat brothers ... 
Eddie? Ed?
Lindsey's with him. Maybe she's ready to come home.
Cash and a very busy passport ... designer threads. Ten-to-one, Croix Richards is a drug dealer. And that is no workout accident.
Eddie? Eddie, you've got to get to a land line. This connection sucks.
Lindsey?  I-I can't hear you.
You're alone? Well, honey, where's daddy?
Uh ...  uh, yeah, honey. Yes, yes, I'm coming.
It's going to be okay, honey. I'm on my way.  Do you know where you are.
Are you near a lake? Are you near grandma's house?
In the car?  Lindsey, can you get out?
It's going to be okay, honey. Just listen to me. Before the car crashed, where were you going?
On the way there, did you see any hotels?
Excalibur. Did you see, did you see the pyramid?
Industrial Road? Is that, is that it? Lindsey, is it industrial road?
Lindsey? Lindsey!
Lindsey? Lindsey!
Hang on, honey!
I'm here, honey.
I'm going to get you out. Hang on.
Okay. Listen. I have to break the window, okay? You've got to move to the front.
Okay, I'm going to come around, okay? I'm coming around.
I'm here, Lindsey. I'm going to go down. I'm going to go down.
You all right? You okay?
Yes? I got you. Hold on.
Never, never, never, no. He loves Lindsey. He'd never do that. Not willingly.
Be careful with my car, boys.
I don't know, baby. I ... I'm going to go look for him, though. I'm just going to be right over there.
I want you to stay here with Detective Vega. Okay?
Knowing Eddie's taste in women, I'd say that's a good bet.
Did he have anything to drink? Did he have a beer, a glass of wine?
You remember, Lindsey. Just think about it.
Why did you stop there?
You mean he left you in the car alone.
Willows.  Yeah.
Croix Richards and Trey Buchman. Same profession, same employer, same cause of death.
Not your typical male M.O. Lady Heather a suspect?
I'm okay. Lindsey's ...  ... We're okay.
Thanks, you guys. 
Why don't you catch us up.
Especially for repeat crimes.
No, thanks.
Extra-marital s*x to help your relationship problems?
Mrs. McCormick, did you meet Trey Buchman at Lady Heather's? 
Well, Mrs. McCormick, I'd like to get a sample of your hair and DNA for comparison.
So she lied to you guys at the hotel, she lied to us at the house. She's been with him, not just online.
You even think about my daughter again, I'll kill you. I will kill you. 
I will hunt you down and put ... I will put you in the ground!
I've been here a lot longer than you ... 
And I wouldn't have to be here if you were doing your job properly.
You're going to tell me what I want, huh?
Grissom!
We got a problem.
Stranglings are intimate. Crime of passion.
Mr. McCormick ... were you the one who found your wife?
On the stairs?
May I see your hands, please?
Other side. 
They look clean.
I don't know. If it were my spouse, I would've touched the body.
So you're calling it?
What a great bedtime story for my little girl.
Yeah, makes us VIPs tonight.
No, thanks. Oh, it's not luggage. Thank you, though.
You said you had a situation in your casino?
Well, until we know the victim was taken over state lines, the FBI has no jurisdiction. Do you have any contact from the kidnappers?
Whose five-year-old boy?
Mr. Tombs ... 
We're with the crime lab, and I'm assuming that that's our ransom note.
How many of you touched this letter?
Did this note come in an envelope?
We have a better chance of getting uncompromised prints off of this.
The casino's fronting the ransom money?
We strongly advise that you don't hand over that money.
Any unidentified prints?
So prints don't help.
Liquid extraction results.
Nicotine. So we're looking for a smoker -- menthol smoker.
Body's in an unnatural position.
His body's also coated. Makes me think whoever did this didn't even stop the car. 
Something had to have gone wrong.
Mr. Tombs, I'm sorry, but in a crime like this, an autopsy's mandatory. Evidence from your son's body may lead us to the suspect.
It's not your call anymore.
Hey. Why don't you let me handle this?
The foam around his mouth?
Well, that could be from roughhousing with his older brothers. What about this bruise?
We haven't found the scene.
We already have.
Tramelle.
Ms. Willis ... is Tramelle your only child?
Why wasn't she with Tavian's other kids at the carnival?
Oh, yes, I've been there. Works wonders on the disappointments of little girls.
Pill casings.
I see a USP number.
Looks that way.
So, our kidnapper had contact with dogs.
Hey, how about a vet?
Acepromazine maleate. Tranquilizer.
I'll call Brass. I'll have him check vet clinics, kennels, pet supply stores, and we'll extend the radius out from the dump site.
Or a guy who knows how to finish.
Visible match.
Tramelle, where's your mother?
So, Tavian was paying Bridget child support -- three grand a month.
Well, he made his deal with Bridget when Tramelle was born. Bad timing for her.
And it is his son. I'm sure he would have paid any amount. So, how does that dog kennel guy Price figure into all this, and was killing him part of the plan?
In her act of redemption, she gives Tramelle to Tavian.
How about the driver?
That's Sara's boyfriend.
Some happy hour, huh?
Hank.
Yeah, not your granny's oldsmobile.
So you going to tell me how it went?
Yeah, you don't answer their questions, you're looking at more days off without pay, and that blows.
Nobody mentioned it, but the camera's there. Big brother knows.
Motor oil. 
Hitting the curb could've caused the car to buck.
Traffic light, intersection, curb. Well, either the car wasn't working, or the driver wasn't. 
Looks like the newspaper dispenser used to be here.
She tried to stop, but it was too late.
Oh, hey. So, I got photos of the restaurant patrons off the DMV database and input the information per the restaurant seating chart and the police report. 
Who's Elaine Alcott?
Oh, well, she was seated with Hank. I just thought maybe that ... SARA: Oh. 
Anyway, um ... apparently, she told P.D. that she was returning from the ladies' room at the time of the impact.
Okay. 
Um ... okay, so, we've got 36 people in the restaurant. Twelve worked for Sillmont Healthcare, a block away. Another ten were from the brokerage firm across the street, a couple of regulars, a few out-of-towners and restaurant employees.
Wow. She sped through that intersection -- 52 miles per hour.
There's only one way to find out.
Hey, check this out. The red light camera clocked her speed at 52 miles per hour, right?
The computer software pegged her at 60 by the time she hits the newspaper dispenser. She accelerated into the building.
I'll call Brass. If Lambert had a grudge against the place, somebody there should know her.
Let's run it.
Okay ... top to bottom.  Cameron Black, deceased; from Jersey. First time in Vegas. Unlikely mark.
Table three: Hank and ... Elaine Alcott. Also works at the insurance company.
Yeah. Maybe you should.
Hey.
So, how did it go with Elaine Alcott?
Well, that's certainly more evidence to suggest that her actions were intentional.
Dial the number.
Right. The Checkerbox is at 16 North Meadows.
Well, GPS is hardly perfect. Maybe north was a directional default.
Well, did she have some kind of problem with her policy?
Well, this member is deceased. Not even the doctor-patient privilege extends postmortem.
You know what? Four people are dead. Don't waste our time. We can take this downtown.
Well, what exactly does that mean?
In other words, Mrs. Lambert's health was in limbo. She wasn't receiving treatment, but she couldn't file an appeal, since you hadn't officially denied her claim.
Time Mrs. Lambert didn't have.
.... and while you were following your 'procedure', and postponing a decision, her cancer cells were multiplying.
For what it's worth, that makes me sick.
Yeah.
If you were aware of your grandmother's intentions and programmed the GPS, you're guilty of aiding and abetting in the murder of three people.
Uh ... well ... Corey, homicide has informed us that your grandmother had a life insurance policy, in which you're the sole beneficiary.
I'll meet you at the car.
You got plans?
You want to get a beer?
Ugh!
Soap mummy.
All you need is a little moisture and enough time.
Anaerobic bacteria digest body fats, converting them into a waxy solid.
Kind of like the way they make vegetable shortening.
Five, six weeks, minimum.
I've seen it done.
Mmm.
What about the foot? It looks as though that's been sheared off.
Industrial accident?
How about an axe then?
Body in a drum in the middle of the mountains. Well, if the head and hands were missing, I'd be saying mob hit.
So, I.D. from dental records is out. How about DNA? Bone marrow may still be viable.
It's your kitchen.
Hey, Grissom bailed. You guys are with me.
Yeah. His name was Christian Cutler.
He wasn't in CODIS. Department of defense registry. He was in the army. An E-5 sergeant, honorably discharged three years ago. The guy drove tanks.
Hard-core mechie.
This place seems lively for a warehouse.
Hello.
Metal weapons, money, competition, testosterone.
Look available, be unobtainable.
He found his body stuffed in a chemical waste drum from this warehouse.
I take it this Chris was not well liked.
Is this a machine shop or a junkyard? 
I guess this is what passes for pinups with these guys.
So this must be Hammer of God. Or at least what's left of it.
I think we just got Ginger.
We traced the machine shop back through a holding corporation.
Well, we found this in Brian's station -- your fingernail.
Yeah, they also scratch. There were skin scrapings under the nail. We tested the epithelials. They're Christian Cutler's. Your shop, your fingernail, your waste drum with the dead guy in it.
And you didn't think this was worth mentioning?
So, that's the price of doing business?
Here's the way I'd call it ...
Cutler-Comma-Christian. 
Never went to college. That part wasn't in his service record.
They don't match. Okay, so when Christian died, Brian wasn't controlling the bot.
Well, we know it didn't. It was responding to a different control frequency.
If he did, he was protecting somebody.
Look available. Be unobtainable. Except when you're trying to beat a murder rap.
Well, you are the queen bee. The drones line up to service you.
Does it have a name or did it come with the wallet?
Puppet master. Somebody else was pulling the strings.
So, what's the range of those controllers anyway?
So, if somebody hijacked Brian's bot they'd have to be nearby, but ... obviously, out of sight.
Well, there's a good place to hide up there. Opportunity.
Ooh, proud papa. The man who built Hammer of God.
And look what's missing: 84.
So ... what happened?
You couldn't kill Christian's bot so you killed Christian.
The bot wasn't the only thing you manipulated, Luke.
Brian gave you up. 
I know what it must've been like for you. Having created something, only to lose it.
Yes, I have a daughter.
Uh-huh.
I guess the only flaw then was you.
Whoo! Theaters are like nightclubs; they should always keep the lights off.
Was there anyone else here?
With you?
Yeah, somebody beat him to it.
And nobody saw anything?
Professional killer?
Mr. Siskel, Mr. Ebert, may I have a Cause of Death, please?
Well, what movie did you see this in?
Or necklace. Oh!
Butterfingers.
Hey! I wasn't the only one who dropped something tonight.
Soda.
Popcorn.
It wasn't the cleanest theater in the world. I just want to match the blood to our victim.
Uh-huh.
We're with the Las Vegas crime lab. Do you know a Gus Sugarman?
Well, we know that Dr. Sugarman called you at home two minutes before the movie started, and that you didn't pick up.
And you were here alone?
Can anyone verify that?
Still screening?
We'll be in touch.
Don't tell me -- Greg won the bet.
Oh, great. Let's, uh, go back to Audrey's and see if we have a match.
And she was going on a date with this guy?
Did you happen to notice if she was wearing gloves?
Excuse me. 
What happened to the garbage that was in the can in the lobby?
So, the gloves match the palm print on the murder weapon as well as the pay phone in the theater lobby. Unfortunately, there was no epithelials inside the gloves because the cleaning woman had ammonia on her hands.
Well, obviously, she didn't make it home in one minute.
Well, if she couldn't afford a powerful attorney, how did she pay for a hit man?
She used an extension cord and tied it to the railing and must have jumped off.
Our only suspect apparently commits suicide.  Convenient.
No signs of a break-in ... or a struggle. She may have been killed by someone she knew.
Yeah, she was dragged over here, tied off and shoved over.
You got something?
Maybe she threw it away.
Well, there's an awful lot of water damage, but, um ... there's some kind of an impression.
'Strangers On A Train.' Is that the one with the perfect murder?
Life imitating art?
So if Audrey is Farley Granger ... 
'Sphere E4-117.' Well, that's got to be the Sphere Hotel.
Locker, safety deposit box ... 
Yeah.
E4-117. Your assigned parking space. It was written on a movie schedule we found in Ms. Hilden's home.
Have you ever seen any Hitchcock movies?  'Strangers On a Train'?
So, get this -- Anthony Haines had a sexual harassment suit filed against him recently.
Uh-huh, from one of the showgirls.
She claims that he threatened to fire her if she didn't perform certain sexual favors.
... if Audrey hired the same firm? She did.
Knees bothering you?
Well, any physical evidence on those gloves would've been compromised by the ammonia.
You're looking for transfer.
Langly &amp; Langly.
Oh, it's the law firm that both you and Audrey hired to deal with your problems -- Gus Sugarman and Anthony Haines.
Well, we're guessing that that's where the two of you first met, at the lawyers'.
Right. Right. I mean, either way, you ladies had a lot in common.
Oh, yeah.
You needed them both dead. 
So, right out of 'Strangers On A Train', if you swapped murders, no one could tie you to the victims, and then you started talking specifics -- where the best place would be to kill Haines. Someplace dark, secluded-- the parking lot right here at the sphere.
And then you walked out into the lobby and called Audrey on the pay phone, to say that the deed was done.
She was the one who picked the movie ... and made the date.
You'd killed for her. Now she wasn't holding up her end of the bargain.
The only thing that she had on you was that movie schedule. That had to go.
Hi. What'd I miss?
Mm. This one of your favorites?
Okay. Well, what do you like?
Buh-du-bum.
Maybe he slipped on a banana peel.
Hmm.
Hi, David.
Well, there's no foam on the mouth. No discoloration around the lips. Pupils aren't dilated. No overt evidence of a drug overdose.
What do you see?
What are you looking for?
Oh, china ...
So, who has access to the green room?
All right. I would like to see everyone's wallet. I don't need to see your identification. Just open your wallets.
Thank you.
Thanks.
That's more than I needed to know. Thank you.
When was the last time you used this credit card?
Well, that's between you and the D.A. The preliminary tox screen on Dougie Max came back positive for cocaine.
It was in his blood.
Cocaine on the foreskin, or any skin, for that matter, is not a stimulant; it's a numbing agent.
Sounds frustrating.
I don't have to run any tests. You cannot absorb enough cocaine through your pen1s to OD.
I don't have a source. 
Whatever.
Cocaine levels are less than .05 milligrams per liter. Way too low. That's not what killed him.
And what were the levels in the vic?
Ooh. Dougie Max was poisoned.
Because Spam can't be absorbed through the pen1s, and if you ask me to cite my source ... 
'Death by chocolate' again?
Hmm.
Information.
Dougie Max's Innoko water bottles that were on the stage his last performance -- who set them up?
Well, besides you and Dougie, who had access to it?
Well, you've got a temper ... and a record. Assault. Club in Tucson.
Oh, hey, listen. I checked the bartender's medical records. The guy's had six different prescriptions for migraines in the last two years. Guess which one he's on now.
Total recall. We pulled 140 bottles 
... of Innoko water off the shelves in this store alone. There's 500 convenience stores in Vegas. We need to get this product off the shelves now. Grocery stores, restaurants, wholesalers ... I mean not to mention the population of informing the people ... 
Yes, I know that we risk panic, chief, but I'd rather risk that than have another victim.
We need to find out what's in there.
Right.
So, we've got two bottles of poisoned Innoko water -- one from a comedy club on western, the other from a convenience store halfway across town.
There may not be one; it could just be random.
You know, they never caught the guy who put the cyanide in the Tylenol back in the '80s. They found out how the bottles were tampered with. That's where safety seals came from.
No, nothing yet.
Wait a minute. It's in the threads.
We've got a bigger problem than we thought we had.
I'm not looking at you.
We think that we nailed the tampering method. The poison wasn't inside the bottle. It was on the bottle cap.
We think that the killer dripped a solution of naratriptamine into the threads of the bottle cap.
Capillary action pulled the solution into the threads, where it dried into white crystals.
Right now, that's the way it looks.
Right. But how did it get there?
There was a coffee grinder in the green room at the Comedy Hole.
All right, gentleman. Good afternoon. Could you line up for me, please. Right up here, please.
Right, well, I can see you all know how to open your mouths, so ... good.  Ready? 
Just give me an 'O.'
Oh, well, then maybe I should use a rectal swab.
Good boy. 
Okay, who's next for some foreplay
Funny.
'Cause she's a babe and he's ...
.380 auto caliber.
Well, gunshots do a number of your face, so typically, women prefer pills.
Well, you do the math: Dead female spouse plus missing husband ... equals murder.
All right, look, I read rooms for a living. That closet was tossed. The carpet lit up. So I'm going to ask you again. What were you doing in there besides copulating?
Right. Well, we found this laptop on the vanity still on. You didn't play with it, too, did you?
And we have a right to protect the crime scene.
I can't tell you anything until I get all the details. I'm sorry.
Ms. Newman. Would you come with me, please?
Ms. Newman, is this your ex-husband?
Virtual tour. Right on, Archie. Before and after photos of the crime scene.
You know your art. You a collector?
Oh, I haven't been yet.
A docent. So, you think that's legit?
You'd be surprised. The rich go cheap to stay rich, you know what I mean?
Please.
And, uh, what happened to the sculpture?
You saying somebody lifted it?
Put your house on the market your privacy's up for grabs, too.
Quite the saleswoman. 
Down, boys.
Hey, Archie, freeze it.
Who's that in the background?
Like the Peter Croft sculpture.
Oh, it is. 
Oh, you're innocent in all this?
I'm going to need that DNA sample.
Great.
Say, 'ah.'
Her stepson, Max. Did you get any DNA off the cigarette butts?
Max, we found two sperm donors on the sample from your stepmother. Your father's and yours.
What's your shoe size, Max?
The kid didn't do it. Look, we found the father's blood on the underside of the pool ledge.
So there was a struggle in the water. 
Right.
Well, do you recall living in San Diego?
Oh, it just might help jog your memory. San Diego's a military town. Your sister married a guy in the navy, right?
Well, we could go someplace else if you'd like. 
How about your house? It's up for sale.
Well, you see, we didn't have enough evidence at this point to get a warrant, but you put your house on the internet. I didn't need a warrant. Gave me complete access via this virtual tour. And all with your permission.
That's you ... that's Peter Berglund ... and that's the Pacific.
Yeah. You hired him to kill your ex-husband and his new wife.
No, but it did give me access to Peter's financial information. 
Loan application. Two signatures -- Peter Berglund and yours. You cosigned for Peter because he couldn't qualify on his own. Payment for the hit. He gets your house you get your ex-husband's money.
The thing about murder for hire ... there's always a paper trail.
Hey.
I do, but I left these on my desk.  I'm on my way to Circus Circus with five nine-year-olds. It's Lindsey's birthday. Got to wrap a Bridal Barbie.
Funny. Oh, blue ... gun shot residue.
So it means that he may have fired the revolver that you and Grissom found in the park?
Right. Hmm ... but maybe Grissom can.
Yeah, I just passed him in ballistics. He was meditating on your revolver. Didn't even look up.
Mm-hmm. 
Thanks.
No towels, either. Someone took a few souvenirs. I'll check the surveillance tapes.
It's not her room, either. It was registered under the name of Parker.
You heard that?
You're back.
This is very weird.
Yeah, and it starts there, ends there. It's not very deep.
No ligature marks. No defensive wounds.
She sat there and allowed someone to slit her throat?
He sliced her gently?
And what did the tox report give us?
Double the legal limit.
Ecstasy? And alcohol? Party mix.
Well, maybe it explains why she was cut from the front.
Glitter?
You go, Doc.
So, they were George. 
Big tippers.
Watch.
Ordering clear drinks to keep the party going. What'd they order?
Guess who got the hard stuff.
Uh, I got to be at the courthouse. Apparently, there's a last-minute evidentiary hearing in the Sam Braun case. I need to be there.
He already is, sweetheart. Thanks.
Help with what?
That obvious, huh?
Oh ... Sam Braun.
I'm not.
Sam told me it takes a lifetime to establish a reputation and just a second to ruin it. When I suspected that Sam was my father, I didn't go to him. I didn't go to Grissom. I went to Greg and had him run a DNA test.
On me.
Blood evidence from his case.
Yup. And I'm just afraid.
A backlash.
Is that it? We're done?
Well, power's back on. So, why this place? How do you go from The Sphere to The Fez?
Oh, great. Help the bad guys. I'm sure the Laggermans appreciate that.
Enjoy.
They had to have been in some kind of situation where they couldn't say no.
They didn't think he was just going to walk away.
It's just so sick.
Well, I checked with the manager. The vic was not registered. No car.
Someone's got blood on their hands.
We suspect that Mr. Dominguez was forced to kill his wife for the promise of freedom.
Doc Robbins found evidence of glitter on Mrs. Dominguez.
We didn't know who they were at the time. Okay ... that's it for the first murder. What about the second?
Okay, so, uh, we're going to have to get into the Klinefelds' house. If they haven't tossed the towels and sheets ...  ... we may have something.
Funny, doesn't look like a doghouse.
Um, no, you ratted yourself out. Hey, Nick, I know you're proud of what you do. You're good at what you do, and you want people to know what you do, but once you open your mouth, it's all over 'cause what we say ends up in the news.
So, if that's the lure, where's the catch?
mm-hmm. Clear drinks. What do you want to bet the Rifkins are drinking vodka and the Klinefelds club soda.
So, if we're creatures of habit ... if she stuck her tongue in Mr. Rifkin's ear, chances are she stuck it in Mr. Dominguez's ear, too.
Mr. Dominguez has already been autopsied. Washed from head-to-toe.
Coroners.
He's not picking up.
Oh, hey, doc. Doc. Where's the ice man?
Drop the hose.
Did you go from head to toe or head to toe?
You run with it.
Excuse me. May I have your...?
Excuse me. May I have your attention, please?
Thank you. I'm Catherine Willows. I'm from the crime lab.
No. I'm sorry. No one is going anywhere. Ms. Davis. I'll start with you. Will you follow me, please?
Miss Davis, we found a synthetic blond hair on the victim's body. Care to explain?
Did he take you up on your offer?
Lucky for you. Attempting to influence is a category D Felony. It's up to four years in prison and a $5,000 fine.
Woman to woman? The pole is there for a reason. It's what you hang on to so the creeps don't pull you out of there. Smarten up.
Mr. Jervis. Why are your fingers bloodied?
Would you hold your hands up for me, please?
Mr. Jervis. I need to remind you that you're still under judge's orders not to discuss the case.
You sure it's lost?
Hey, Gil. 
So tox came back on Chris Gibbons. He may have been allergic to penicillin but didn't have any in his system.
Epinephrine. So maybe Mr. Gibbons had an allergic reaction to something else. Such as...?
So we're looking for a used hypodermic.
Greg, I'm the one that actually put you on a case, not just talked about it.
You know what? You started, and you gave me six strong innings, and I brought in the closer. What's wrong with that?
Fish -- that's a good place to start. I need you to check the victim's blood for shellfish, egg whites, nuts and soy.
Got to start somewhere.
Hey.
So you think it's a serial?
I think our arsonist just turned into a murderer.
Smoke inhalation happens really fast. I'm so sorry. I heard you say she wasn't supposed to be home tonight. Was she with her dad?
What time was that?
Mrs. Abernathy, do you have any idea what may have caused the fire?
Do you know anyone who might want to set fire to your home?
Her mother thought that she wasn't home.
But she wasn't asleep.
If you can explain the behavior of teenagers, more power to you.
Mrs. Abernathy said that she locked all the doors before bed.
Plus ... a bar full of liquid fire with a low flash point.
Couch?
This looks like a liquid pour pattern. High-intensity burn. You think this could be the point of origin?
How'd you do?
That's on the other side of the house.
Did they find an accelerant at the first scene?
So maybe part of the M.O. is that he uses accelerants that are present.
Well, how can that be? It was an obvious liquid pour pattern.
All it needed was a spark.
We've got no accelerant. We've got no match. We have no idea what started this fire.
Hmm, looks like a one hundred. Longer the cigarette, longer the filter.
It's fine.
Well, we found a cigarette filter in the remains of your couch. And we need a urine sample from each of you so that we can rule you out for nicotine.
Ritalin, valium, and grandma's a liar.
Mrs. Abernathy, did your daughter have attention deficit disorder?
Well, we found Ritalin in her system, and as I'm sure you're aware, ritalin is used to treat kids with ADD, but acts as a stimulant in older kids and adults. Teens use it as an upper.
As were you. Valium.
One with a teenage daughter.
Mrs. Abernathy ... are you covering for your mother?
Maybe after you went to bed, she came out into the living room.
But it's a possibility?
Any luck?
Did you try different variables?
I'm not following.
Mm-hmm.
Unless the fire didn't start on the living room couch.
An incandescent light bulb will soften at around 900 degrees, and distend in the direction of the original heat source.
How did we miss that?
Let's dig in.
Do you fondue?
The accelerant was ethanol, methanol and petroleum jelly. Chafing dish fuel, like sterno.
So it has gone from intentional to accidental to personal. Who have we got?
She's got no personal connection to the family.
Charming.
What about Cody?
What about suspects within the house?
She seems more frustrated than desperate. Frustration shows you still care.
I don't think so. 'Bitch.' It's such a teenage girl word. 
I might be willing to buy that, but how do we prove it?
This is old school hydrocarbon detection.
Chafing dish fuel is alcohol-based, but water would have washed away any trace.
Well, it's the only shot we've got, I guess.
Hmm. Take a look at this.
Oh.  Hit the jackpot.
Mom was locking the wrong door.
Mrs. Abernathy, would you come with me, please?
Mr. Dominguez was forced to kill his wife for the promise of freedom.
Rifkin's ear -- chances are she stuck it in Mr. Dominguez's ear, too.
Yeah, well, let me tell you how it ends. They die. 
Whoa, this isn't half bad for college kids.
Hey, how 'bout it: You, me, Warrick, Nick, Grissom ... 
What the hell is this?
Thanks. Where's the body?
It's raining man juice?
Yeah, if only the smell would.
It's like a sewer in here.
Oh, god.
How long has he been in here?
Well, any evidence on the floor's been washed away.
We got to take that body and get it through that door.
This drain hasn't been tampered with. It's just clogged. I think this is an accidental.
Well, I don't think that means much. Chances are he's not getting his drugs from a medicine cabinet.
Same place we were when we walked through the door -- with a bloated floater.
Hey. 
A backwards seven.
I don't know.
Some kind of greasepaint or makeup.
Rubs off your chest. Oh, what kind of guy paints his chest?
Sports freak.
Cause of death?
A slow leak in a tire?
Well, he had to have been in the water for a couple of days to look like this. Roommates last saw him Thursday. So I guess we start there and we work backwards. Thanks.
What about the away games?
Define ugly.
Did you notice anything? Did he ...feel okay?
How did Shirley take it?
Do you see any of those guys in here now?
Start with the Shirley Temples and go from there.
How?
Interesting ring you've got on. 
That's a college ring. Mind if I borrow it?
Yeah.
Jaws.
No, it was in Steven Spielberg's Jaws. They had this mechanical shark named Bruce. And he kept swimming round and round in circles.
His dorsal fin was bent.
Same way the kid's ring did. It hit something.
But he was already dying. And you're responsible.
Hi, David.
Now ... the body position is inconsistent with her lividity.
So she had been facedown.
How long has she been here?
Instar maggots.
Takes that long for blowfly eggs to hatch.
Let's just hope there's some evidence on her body.
I'm very sorry.
Officer, could you please escort Ms. Press ... to the morgue.
A single mother, working nights.
Ah, you do the best you can.
Hey.
Got your page. What's up?
Mm-hmm.
Wow. This place is crawling with kids. She remembers her?
Have we tracked down her friend, Carrie?
And was she supposed to sleep over the day that she was killed?
Warrick.
Yeah, you're not the only one.
Can you enlarge it?
And who's that with you?
You two were friends?
She was thirteen. How old are you?
In the photo, you're grabbing her arm.
Did she say who?
What's up?
Come again.
You're kidding?
Who knew? Uh, so can we track the source of ... ?
Zoodoo.
Hello.
May I?
At this point, we're just following a lead. How long have you known Justin?
And where's Tessa's father?
Have you ever left Tessa alone with Justin?
The blood on the blade matches your daughter's DNA.
You can help yourself here. You can avoid murder one by telling us what set you off.
Try me.
Why don't you tell us?
No. Your daughter was the best thing in your life.
I know she was thirteen years old. A child.
So, what do we have here?
Hmm. 
Okay, thanks.
Hey, Nathan. How's your foot?
Hmm. Yeah, I see that. Mrs. Timmel, does the gun belong to someone in the house?
Nathan, where did you find the gun?
Seymour?
So, you were playing with Seymour, and he found the gun where?
Well, where exactly?
Was it buried? Did you dig it up?
Will you ever play with guns again?
Hey, Rich. 
Found this somewhere where it didn't belong. 
Unregistered. No prints.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, light enough for a five year old to use.
He's okay. Thank god.
Well, that's a good thing.
Okay.
Frank Maddox. 47-year-old white male. Professional bounty hunter. Single .32 round in the side of his head. Bruises on his face and chest.
Warrick, your notes are great. Let the case speak for itself.
Maslow Park. All fun and games till the sun goes down.
So, the bounty hunter is here at 2:00 A.M.
Well, apparently, someone found him first.
Hunter becomes the hunted.
A dozen perfect dump sites within a mile of here. So, how does the gun end up across town in the hands of a five-year-old boy?
Doesn't make any sense.
Actually, no. Terrango killed two more people before another
Oh, yeah, it did. After that case, his recovery rate went down practically to zero.
What about suicide?
Maybe too textbook. A bounty hunter would know how to fake it. Let's check out his right sleeve. Very odd. It's unbuttoned - it's pulled way down. It would explain why there weren't any prints on the gun.
Maybe someone found it and grabbed it up.
We're always looking for a weapon. You'd think it'd be easier when the weapon finds us.
It's polypropylene film. It was found in the trigger guard. It's ribbon, for wrapping presents and ...
You got ten bucks?
Hi.
You here every day? 
Do you recognize this man?
Did he buy any balloons?
I'll take what he bought.
Hey. I'm sorry to hear about your case.
Well, he'll be back. We'll get him eventually.
Want to go for a ride?
Frank Maddox - bad-ass bounty hunter on his way down. Loses his rep, loses his edge ... 
Except maybe one thing: Going out with his boots on. 
He picks a known hot spot, and waits until it gets dark. 
Angles the gun down...
... and the balloons make it look like murder.
Until ... 
... you leave the city to get away from crime, and guns fall out of the sky.
When are parents going to learn a car is not a baby-sitter?
I lost count after ten.
If it's not babies in cars, it's babies in swimming pools. It's that time of year.
mm-hmm. Personal visit. Must be important.
We're working on it.
Based on the time of death, uh, we estimate roughly an hour. The 9-1-1 call came in 11:30 in the morning.
According to Captain Brass ... uh, ten a.m.
I know. It's a tragedy.
Is there any worse punishment than losing your child?
Doesn't change my job.
I always do.
Car seat's fastened correctly. Most aren't.
Hey, Gil. Look at this. What do you think?
Exactly. There's no indentations in the leather.
Yeah. Same thing the father said.
I don't know.
Negative for blood.
What are you thinking?
Hey, Greg.
How are we doing on that swab?
Not likely. Child endangerment. Child neglect. Child abuse.
You and the D.A. can shake hands.
Your print out's ready.
Cough syrup.
Mrs. Winston.
You flew to Los Angeles, Mrs. Winston?
I presume you have a babyseat in your vehicle.
Ms. Winston, did Joshua have a cold?
Did you give him anything for it?
How about this morning?
'Howard Aston Winston.'
When did he die?
Oh, that's incurable. Like MS, right?
The Winstons never mentioned they had another child.
I know it.
So, between the cough syrup and the heat, Joshua probably fell asleep and the father forgot that he was there.
Pesticides. 
What the hell's he doing with pesticides in his system?
Where do you keep your gardening supplies?
Night and day, compared to Joshua.
Quite a lot of vitreous fluid left. 
Run this?
Anti-inflammatory. Sometimes prescribed for Tay-Sachs. Well, it's the same principle of giving marijuana to glaucoma patients -- doesn't really cure the vision problems; it just buys you time.
Yeah.
So, they don't kill their first child, who's dying. Why kill the second child, who's healthy?
So, both Howard and Joshua Winston were patients of yours?
But Joshua dodged the bullet.
Had you seen Joshua recently?
It was a regular checkup, or ... ?
What are the odds?
And did you confirm it?
When you were in the garden, was Joshua with you?
Did you wash your hands?
Well, I met with your pediatrician, Dr. Garner. When you brought Joshua in on that emergency call, it was because you feared that he, too, had Tay-Sachs.
Did you know that repeated exposure to certain pesticides, even in small amounts, can have an adverse effect in infants? Even mimic the signs of Tay-Sachs?
You work with pesticides, Mrs. Winston, on your job and in your garden. And you handled Joshua -- we suspect that that's how the traces got into his system. I'm just speculating here, but I think this is what happened next:
You gave Joshua cough syrup, Mr. Winston. Why did you medicate him?
The shame of it is you didn't have to.
The enzyme test that dr. Garner ran came back negative. Joshua didn't have Tay-Sachs. You killed a perfectly healthy baby.
Any idea when Grissom'll be back?
Jackpot, Nevada. Where the hell is that?
Spruce and fir trees. Typical mountain forest.
Fire, roads or ... logging.
No manzanita leaves here.
Is the service actually bad out there or are you just keeping your phone off?
This trip wouldn't have anything to do with you ducking case reviews, now would it?
Oh, your job, my pay. Why would I care?
Yeah, you had better. 
Hodges ID'd your leaf litter.
Oh, no. Grissom's on a safari.
Oh, no. I'm trying to avoid that. His headless D.B. had a Western LVU bookstore receipt in his pocket. Grissom just unraveled it.
Wow! Some of these books are a hundred bucks a pop. Tuition, plus room and board -- that's at least another 10k.
Yeah, well, I missed that boat. So, most of these are freshman textbooks. Core curriculum.
Oh, wait. Hang on. 'Chiaroscuro Theory and Technique'. It's a sophomore-level fine arts text.
Narrows the field.
Are these Ross's shoes?
Aspen leaf. A little piece of the countryside. Has Ross spent a lot of time up in northern Nevada?
Everybody in Sleepy Hollow still drawing a blank on the victim?
Well, then somebody's lying. Ross Jenson was having a relationship with someone in jackpot. Greg traced a series of romantic I.M.s from your victim's computer.
Yeah, he knows stuff. Pretty hot, too. Sounds like he was in love. Brass is still working on a court order for the name. You ever coming back?
Oh. Thanks, Judy.
What is this?
Well, I didn't come here to talk. I came to give it back.
You're a murderer.
Lindsey's none of your business. You keep her out of this.
Yeah, well, nothing I can do about that.
And the next time you stab one of your showgirls and you need CSI to cover it, I'm supposed to help you out, right?
I don't need your Charity.
You're lucky Lindsey's too young to understand that.
Hey. What's up?
The day Ross Jenson left Vegas, he used MapQuest to get directions from his dorm to jackpot.
Well, that doesn't make sense. He was involved with someone in jackpot for several months. There were traces of aspen leaves in his dorm room closet. I just assumed he'd been there before.
He has a roommate.
Yeah, his name is ... Eric Brooks.
Was Ross?
We got your fingerprints from a former ROTC commander of yours, and ... they matched a print that we recovered from the steering wheel.
Could I see the bottom of your shoes, please?
Well, that's an unusual wear pattern. Matches the shoe print we recovered from the barn near the vehicle.
You were there.
We tested the thermos and found traces of GHB.
You used Ross' drugs to subdue him.
Why didn't you go the distance? Why didn't you finish him off yourself?
Because he was in love with your father? Or because he wasn't in love with you?
You can't possibly call that thing my office. It's a cupboard.
Hello, I'm Catherine.  We need to talk.
Hey.
With the worst hangover a guy could ever have.
Massive hemorrhaging.
Is this from a single wound? Cracked skull. Did you I.D. her?
Well, she's got some breast implants. That's for sure.
I'm going to guess stripper. She's got a locker room key.
We'll trace it back to the club.
You can say that again.
Looks like she went back into the bedroom to call for help.
Why is it you guys can never hit the bowl?
Right.
How does a guy fall asleep after killing a woman?
You sure it wasn't the booze?
Well, if she drugged you, sir, it'll still be in your system. A blood test would be in your best interest.
I know. Vartann called. Nicole Richards, 25. Her stage name is Raven. We traced the locker room key to the Embassy Strip Club. Your turn.
That's almost four times the legal limit.
That would explain why there was so much blood at the scene.
Well, you ever try shaking your ass in four-inch heels? 
Blood standard, unknown urine, tell me it's the same guy. Now, Greg mentioned to you that my stuff gets done first, right?
It's uh, quiet in here. Greg played music.
Carl Johnson?
Runs security at the Embassy Strip Club.
Thumbprint on the towel bar?
Yeah.
You let your girlfriend turn tricks?
Fresh wounds. You get those kicking guys out of the embassy, or ... kicking your girlfriend's ass? I don't think that you were cool with her ways. A big, strong guy like you, you're not gonna share her. She didn't tell you where she was going. You followed her, and you killed her.
I need your clothes.
Hi. Chris here?
I'm Catherine.
Hi.
I'm checking out an alibi. Was this guy in here last night?
I'm working late.
Yeah, and he didn't change his clothes from last night. I screened them for blood -- negative. And the tox report on Mr. Johnson confirms traces of triazelam in his blood.
No.
Hit the lights.
The victim had a swollen ankle. What if this bracelet is an anklet?
By then Johnson had passed out from the triazelam.
The more docile the john, the easier the job, except when you need him to save your life.
Try explaining this to your family back in Ohio.
You find a weapon?
Boy's not even safe in his own bed.
I'll take the inside.
Well, I bagged the bloody sheets from the bed. Found boxers, a t-shirt and a fitted sheet in the washer. ALS'd for blood, found urine.
Consistent with a pipe?
He's got no defense wounds.
Yeah, I got a hair off of Ty's t-shirt. Also consistent with Matt.
Yeah.
Uh, blue fibers. Got them off the vic's t-shirt.
No, but you know, could be from a blanket, a carpet, towel. I'll take them to Trace.
He can move as fast as wants. The D.A. won't file without the physical evidence. And right now, we got nothing.
Yeah?
Anything probative?
Yeah?
So we've got three suspects, three scenarios.
Or dad could have worn it and dumped it in the park.
Not our problem at the moment. Let's just stay focused on the sweater. It's tied to the victim and this scene. We need to tie it to the killer. Hey, how tall would you say Matt Hawkins?
Meet me in the garage in half an hour.
Okay, Warrick, you are approximately the height of Martin Hawkins. Nick, you and the homeless dude are about the same, and Judy, you're close to Matt.
The table is the same height as Ty's bed - forty-three and half inches from the floor to the top of the mattress. The white sweaters, which you all look so adorable in, are the same fabric as the bloody one.
The pipes are the same diameter as the wounds on Ty's face. I want each of you to take a whack at our victim.
Uh, spatter up.
Judy, your sweater -- killer.
Bill Bennett? Guy who owns the Sahara?
I thought you said you were a dork in high school.
I don't doubt that. Hey, Dave.
Pin the tail on the donkey gone wrong?
The only pathway is from the paramedics. How'd he end up in the middle of the circle?
Mm. You have C.O.D.?
A young man's heart stops, and you don't know why?
For every action, there is an opposite but equal reaction.
Hey, Archie.
Freeze the frame, Archie.
Let's see who owns it.
Are you Morgan Wendel?
That's right, yeah.
Kevin thought that he was being pushed out of a helicopter a thousand feet in the air, but ...
The pilot gave us the name of the cameraman, who supplied the tape voluntarily.
When you saw that he wasn't moving, you just took off. That sounds like guilt to me.
When the jury sees that tape, you'll be going all the way ... to jail. Second-degree murder. Twenty-five to life.
I got some white fibers on Nick's vest.
Smells like alcohol.
Why'd you bag that?
It's the wrong color tape. No initials on the seal. That's not Nick's evidence.
Oh, my two favorite guys. So, I've got an assault at Stripperama and a trash run at Flamingo and Koval. I'm too busy to play favorites, so duke it out.
Dumpster's clean. 
No apparent blood or body parts.
A lure. To grab Nick.
David, get this stuff to the doc.
We're going to get him back, David.
Dog entrails.
That's not going to help.
No, that would be my job.
Well, according to Hodges, the white fibers on Nick's vest were cotton with traces of ether ...
Yeah.
All right, so, where are we on possible suspects?
Well, that's possible. Because whoever staged the crime scene couldn't have known that Nick was going to respond.
Shut up.
Son of a bitch. He's screwing with us.
I don't think he knows we can see him.
But if they're going to keep him alive for 12 hours, it must mean that he's got an additional air supply.
Judge Stokes, Mrs. Stokes, Gil Grissom.
No, we haven't yet, but ... they should be contacting us in roughly four hours.
You've already done it by coming here, by showing your support ... 
Sam?
Sam, I need to talk to you.
Zip it, sweetheart. Sam ...
One of my guys is in trouble. He's been kidnapped. I need a million dollars in cash. Large bills. And I need it now.
No.
Considering the problems that you've had with the law, you could use some good publicity.
I'm not here as a cop.
I got the money.
Where do you think?
He's a casino owner. A leader of industry. Never convicted of any crime. And right now, I don't care about the integrity of the lab at the moment. I care about Nick.
Well, you're sitting here like Jack Handy with your deep thoughts, staring at a coffee cup. You got a better plan, I'm all ears.
That's my money.
Agreed.
Somebody bag this money, please? Don't get any funny ideas, either.
What I had to do to get this money and for what.
Sorry, Greg. I'll go talk to him.
Hey, Warrick, hey. Hey, how you holding up?
I know.
Hey, Nick is not inside a box because of the flip of a coin.
Hey, you know what? I know you. I don't believe that. Okay?
Greg, get some crowbars.
Yeah, but if he buried him lengthwise, and who's to say he didn't ... he could be.
It's Plexiglas.
Nick?
Nick?
It's a dog.  It's a dog.
This has got to be a prototype. It was probably built to test how long he could keep somebody alive inside.
There's eleven nurseries in the greater Las Vegas area.
He-e-ey! I'm picking up the web cam transmitter.
This is it! I found it! It's here.
I found it! This is it!
Nick! Nick, we're here. Hang on!
Nicky!
We got you, Nicky!
Willows.
We found him. We're getting him out now.
What? What?
You got to be kidding me.
Everyone out of the hole. That box is ready to explode!
Get out of there now!
There are charges under the box!
Bring it over. This way!
Probably used his fists. b*st*rd had to have hit her.
Hello.
Who's calling? Yes. Uh, yes. Speaking.
She's what? Uh - uhm ... 
Uh, Nick, let me catch a lift with you.  There's something going on with Lindsay.
I'm Catherine Willows. What's the trouble?
Thank you, Officer. I appreciate everything you've done. Let's go.
Okay, what or who is on Fremont Street that you would risk your life to get to? Mouthing off to teachers, slipping grades and now hitchhiking. I mean, what is next, Lindsay?
What did you just say?  Okay, no phone, no friends, no nothing.
A month.
Hey, you want to make it two?
Well, what do you expect, Lindsay, since he was always high.
She played soccer?
She told you about her brother?
How old would you say he is, Jimmy?
Well, her face is covered, that means remorse, guilt ... somebody cared.
She's been re-dressed.
Her panties are missing.
Have you been to bed?
Did you sleep?
Me neither. She was the same age as Lindsay. She was trying to hitchhike.
Fremont Street.
She's ... just so angry. She doesn't talk to me.
Well, I don't want to scare her. I don't want my daughter to be this ... frightened, paranoid kid who's always looking over her shoulder.
Daniel Perez was diagnosed with relapsing acute promyelocytic leukemia or APL when he was ten. It's rare, it's nasty, and it usually hits Hispanics.
His sister, Alicia was conceived in vitro to be a genetic match.
But when she was four, they took her blood for a transfusion.
At seven, they took her blood to remove stem cells.
It takes one to one-and-a-half liters of marrow for a successful harvest.
She is being charged and processed and the court will probably grant her bill.
Why?
She's refusing to talk about what happened to your youngest child, Mrs. Perez. 
I think it might be the best place for her.
Why don't we step in here, please? 
And, uh ... where did Alicia fit in, except for what she could give to your son?
I saw her medical records. I looked at her x-rays. I know what that little girl suffered, what you put her through.
You put one child over another.
Uh, I have a daughter.
No. You need to see for yourself why you can't ever hitchhike or go downtown or be careless with your safety. Are you ready?
She was waiting for a bus downtown when she was attacked. She's was 23. She was taller and stronger than you, Lindsay. She fought back and didn't win. Someone's gonna have to tell her family. Her parents are gonna have to see her like this. Do you get it now?
Well, with due respect, Doc, this doesn't concern you.
I honestly don't know!
Just stay here and shut up. I'll be back to take your prints, assuming they're not already in the system.
Which of the seven deadly sins are not represented here?
Or somebody threw it for him. Pillow or a hand on the face certainly could've done the trick.
You know what they say, it's not a real party till somebody breaks something.
I got blood.
Bullet holes.  Somebody shot out the mirror.
Let's get busy, boys.
You joking?
Maybe he suffocated during oral s*x.
Guess we're done with the appetizers.
Well, at least he went out in style, hmm?
... means he died with a smile on his face.
Remember that trick roll that you pled out last year?
Your DNA in our database says that you do. 
Funny, you don't look dead.
So, how did it go so bad?
No 'off' switch?
Well, that's a great story, but it doesn't sound like it was worth the ten g's that we found in your purse.
Don't take it personally, but you are not a $10,000-a-night girl.
Excuse me.  Hi, Lindsey. I know, I told you that I might be a little while. No, I said that we could try and see a movie. Hey, you know what? I've got a friend here who is fighting for his life. I would appreciate a little understanding. I will talk about this with you later. Good-bye.
Fourteen. Supposedly.
It feels pretty small to me right now, too.
Where's the father?
Wound pattern and GSR suggest a tight contact shot.
'Joey is better off without me. Christina Adalian.' Postpartum depression so bad, it leads to suicide?
She wanted to make sure that her baby was quickly found and fed.
Sara, check out the blood on her hand.
And what appears to be -- is not. 
Can't find a red pen anywhere.
Some black and white particles. Want to hand me a hinge lift?
Who do you keep avoiding?
Ah, that means you should answer it.
No, it can't. 
No one on your team receives cost-of-living adjustments until those evaluations are turned in.
Sofia.
I'll have Greg run down the gun's serial number. Nick is covering the autopsy.  Warrick and I will finish the processing here and I'll keep you posted.
What would you do without me?
Diorite granite.
Yes!
Actually, senior year I took 'rocks for jocks.' I dated the TA.
As a matter of fact, I did.
Her ex happen to be working today?
See, Mr. Peters, we know that you and Christina technically never had s*x, so when you found out that she was pregnant, I'm guessing that you felt that she cheated on you.
I mean, that had to have made you really angry, right?
Why did you lie to us? Claim that you hadn't seen her in months?
Well, it's too late for that, my friend. We need your DNA. Open wide.
Uh-huh. Yeah. That must've been nice for you. So ...
Is that why you paged me?
And Evan Peters isn't the father?
Surrogacy ... that would explain her hymen.
Her hymen was intact, which is consistent with in-vitro fertilization.
Yeah, that is a problem.
Oh, hi, Archie.
And?
Thank you. So I understand that you're going up against Mark Thayer. 
The guy's an ass.
Well, I've seen him on the stand. He manipulates evidence.
So do you think that Thayer is presenting the jury with faulty forensics?
Huh. I don't know who killed Christina Adalian, I don't know how she got pregnant and I don't know the identity of the baby's biological parents.
I now have to share this office with the day shift supervisor. She's got some kind of thing for waterfowl. What's up?
Abandoned embryos?
And Sunflower tries to find women willing to gestate and raise the leftovers?
I knew a stripper who claimed the exact same thing. So, is there any chance that you have a record of the baby's biological parents?
If I understand your program correctly, you take these embryos and you place them in available wombs.
Are you aware that throughout much of history, the official church position held that a child's life begins when the mother first becomes aware of movement?
In the 16th century, the pope proclaimed that embryos less than forty days old are not human. That is not my opinion.
Huh. No. Thank God I decided not to have one. But we are not talking about me, Dr. Ryan. Are you a medical doctor?
Oh, it's just a question. I take it that's a no?
We can get a court order.
Have you been able to analyze the ink?
You can match ink?
Uneven distribution?
Yeah.
A single woman adopts a leftover embryo from an infertile couple and upon her death agrees to give the child back to its biological parents?
You happen to have an address for this Mr. and Mrs. Johnson?
Oh, hey. How's the way of the gun?
Greg, never apologize for doing your job.
Where is your husband now?
No, thank you.
I'm so sorry. Can I ask you ... did you ever conceive a child?
Had you ever considered a surrogate?
Are you aware that one of those embryos was carried to term?
Well, if you don't mind, I'd like your permission to take a look at the clothing that you wore two nights ago.
It's protocol. The victim was shot at close range.
We're going to need to take all the laundry back to our lab.
Oh, hey, Ecklie said you wanted to see me.
I met Dr. Ryan in the course of my investigation. She runs an organization called Project Sunflower. Philosophically, I completely disagree with the organization. Perhaps I expressed myself.
I'm pro-choice. I'm in favor of stem cell research. I'm sorry she felt harassed, but my comments were in response to her statements. I don't think I was out of line.
Is that your position?
So are we having a philosophical discussion here, or am I being reprimanded?
What?
Tell me about the blouse, please.
It proves that she fired a gun, Carol.
Theoretically.
I'm sure that you did. But looking into Joey's eyes and seeing your husband must've torn you up inside. And the only person standing between you and your baby was the victim.
When was the last time you actually saw Christina?
What were you doing two nights ago, around 11:00 P.M.?
Can anyone verify that?
Mrs. Walkey, I need your help. Your daughter claims that two nights ago she was home watching television. Can you confirm that?
Thank you.
Four, maybe six.
There're two women that live at that house. Only one is a size
Would you mind emptying the contents of your purse?
No, it was probably transferred from your blouse, the one that you wore that night. I have a warrant to search your person and your home. Please empty the contents of your purse onto the table.
A red coda pen.
You knew that her sister was coming for a visit, so the baby would be okay. You killed her and then staged the scene.
Is this your husband?
He looks like a poker player.
Actually, it's ... the mole between his eyes that's his tell.
Because you used his gun. The gun he won in a poker game.
That's how it works.
I'm sure that Child Services will follow the dictates of Christina's will.
Did you ever consider that Christina Adalian is somebody's baby?
Officer, would you please escort Mrs. Walkey to lockup?
Yes, I'm ... Yes, I'm ...  I mean ... No, Gil. I'm good.
So, how's your day going?
Oh, I doubt that.
Uh, look, you're not going anywhere. It'll be a lot better for you if you just cooperate and tell us what happened.
Mm-hmm.
Okay, David. Let's roll her over together.
Hey! Hey! Hey!
You ready to give me a name?
You know, you are in a very deep hole, in every sense of the word, my friend. Think about that while we chisel you out. It's going to take a few hours ... assuming we're careful. See ya.
That looks like it could be a double-edged blade. It's pretty thick, too.
Upward thrust.
Okay. Any idea what the weapon might have been?
Thank you.
You take them out, he puts them back in.
It's acetic acid.
Takes your fingerprints.
No.
We're coming up goose eggs on 'cement boy' and his lady friend. 
No hits on AFIS, no hits on CODIS. Guy's got no work card, and his keys weren't a match for any vehicle in a three-block radius of the construction site.
Apparently, just a couple of law-abiding folk.
I'm sorry. It's horrible. But it's really funny. It's horrible and it's funny.
Are you okay?
You're tired.
Found it next to the tire impression.
Science can only do so much with a cold trail.
Is that why you're in Vegas?
Oh. We fake a crime scene.
Assuming they can be deceived, which they can't.
I'll remember.
Hey. I need you on a 411 tonight. 
PD recovered twenty stolen motorcycles. They're at the Dupont Towing Lot.
Take Warrick with you. It'll go faster.
Um, nothing I can talk about. Keep me posted on the 419. Greg's going to meet you at the scene.
Zamesca was shot three times with a nine millimeter. We've got two sets of shoe impressions. Two sets of tire impressions. A plastic 'Jumbo Cola' cup. Drugs were found in Zamesca's car, in plain view, but his tox was negative.
Crime scene was a remote location.
Car was a bloody mess.
Did Mr. Holstein also donate his brain matter and bone fragments?
Well, without actually shooting the guy, this scene is going to be slightly less than perfect, but it's just you and me out there.
Well, if we use one of my guys, they're going to figure it out.
I'm not used to faking it.
Hey, Henry.
Really?
Henry, I need you to step out and get a cup of coffee.
This is not a request.
It's all yours. You can get out now, Detective, and ...
You got it. Oh, and there's some fresh clothes in the back of the vehicle.
Sorry, man.
So, Mike, you said reverse forensics didn't work in Baltimore. How come?
You steal cars before you became a CSI?
Note to self.
Excuse me?
Plan A was the photograph. Anti-drug crusader doing lines. Career buster.
He was a hard man to kill. Simon panicked. Which explains why he left evidence behind this time.
Sorry. I'm at a 420. Similar MO to Zamesca.  Press is all over us. I need permission to get the body out of here ASAP.
Of course. Now, which mortuary's on call?
I'll take care of it. Thanks, Doc.
Called the morticians to get it out of here. Gunshot victim.
Yeah.
No, um, take the perimeter, get started on a diagram.
Thanks, Warrick.
Got a partial print off the straw from the soda cup. AFIS hit Edwin Dennison, aka 'Rat.'
Nick, we got a print from the Holstein case. Street dealer. We're bringing him in now. And he looks dirty for Zamesca, too.
Excuse me. I grew up in this town. I know about playing the odds. You are gambling with my team.
I'm not quitting. But I don't like it. And I hate lying to my guys.
Hey, Nick. 
What do you want it for?
We have evidence and a confession. You can't just come in here and take over my case. 
Nick, as your supervisor, I'm ordering you to back off.
Simon had to believe it when he saw it on the news.
I understand how you all feel. I am sorry. I did not have a choice.
Sara?
Okay, look. We can still get Simon. He only walked on Zamesca. He drove Monique Carter's vehicle out into the desert. Nick's established that. Did he kill her, too?
There's another half a dozen calls to Hugh Griffin, Bud Small, Frank Townsend. All known associates.
You are aware that you talk about the killer in the first person?
Where're you going? 
Gil, where's the fire?
But ... we caught the 'miniature serial killer'; he confessed.
So maybe he arranged to have it sent postmortem.
So, now it's personal?
No ... at least not on our shift. 
I'll check with days and swing, and see if anybody caught a case that matches.
Why not?
It's dated the day after tomorrow. 
Prints and DNA are going over the package and wrapping paper.
Return address was an empty lot. Any clue as to who the victim is?
Well, she's not wearing a wedding ring. She's probably single. Her eyes appear to be bloodshot. Petechial hemorrhaging, maybe?
Blue smudges on the pillow. Blue mascara on the victim. 
Our vic gets comfortable, grabs a little shut-eye ...
... and never wakes up.
She's going to be smothered.
If you interpret this headline literally, the doll is the victim. That's different than the others.
Keppler said something like that once.  He did come down on the right side.
That's from the Izzy Delancy miniature. What's it doing here?
It's deja vu all over again.
This could be the source.
Killer returns to ... complete the miniature the old-fashioned way. 
And things get a little messy. But in the end ...
-- he puts everything right back where it belongs.
Well, they appear to be consistent with the sofa pillow cushion at the scene.
Other than the fact that it's out of its skull? Pigmentation's unusual.
Nick and Warrick did say that she was a little ... spacey when they met her, but they didn't mention any shaking.
Would they have shown up on a poison tox panel?
Hey! How'd it go with the sheriff?
Well, I got the final trace report on the bleach water that spilled at the scene, but ... the fluid in the ear was biological. Water and proteins.
Mm-hmm.
The smudges are from the pillow. There were no tear tracks. I don't think the victim was crying. I think the killer was.
When you cry, your tears sometimes can pick up skin cells from your cheek.
The DNA in your tears that were found on your sister's body proves that you were there. I imagine it was the hardest thing you've ever done. But you did it.
There's no ... assisted suicide protection in Nevada.
I understand. You're under arrest.
Both kids have an ATM card. Neither's been used since they went missing. No calls were placed from either of their cell phones. There's an APB out on Ryan's van-- no hits. An APB has gone out to local hospitals-- nothing yet. I know. It sucks.
Where do I start? Megan and Sheila phoned each other about a dozen times. A handful of calls were placed to Charlie and Bonnie. They're both on the cheerleading squad. 'Hair up or down? Black socks or gold socks?'
Ryan, uh, and Megan exchanged a few calls. He phoned home twice. His last call was after the game to a Diane Kentner. She is the photography teacher at the high school. Warrick is following up and ... I'm going to collect DNA exemplars from the kids' houses. My favorite part.
There's a large rectangular blood pool at the center of the sleeping bag ... with several satellite transfers. At each corner ... a four-plus-one pattern consistent with transfer from bloody hands, indicating the body was carried on the sleeping bag.
Between ten and twenty semen stains. Some overlaid with blood.
Ugh.
Yeah, crabs. I am buying Lindsey a chastity belt.
You are so creepy sometimes.
Unless someone arrives at the party with them.
A s*x pervert with an STD? That's not going to narrow it down.
Yes.
Busy night.
When I first started doing this, everybody I worked on reminded me of someone.
Somehow, we all get past it.
I'll start with the bathroom.
He had a gun. I found grip and slide impressions in some powder on the bathroom counter.
Noise factor? You can't scream once your throat's been slit.
I may have something for you to feed to the monster. 
And the pattern on each is consistent with the knife being wiped off. I think that the killer cleaned off the knife after each kill.
First was Emily ...
-- then Lauren ...
Libby was next.
Then Cammie was attacked, followed by Jennifer. 
But you were right--Becca was attacked last. It was all of her blood that was tracked throughout the house.
He stepped in her blood, walks into the bathroom to clean off the knife, back out into the hallway, down the stairs.
To maintain control. I see a clean knife, I think that the others are still alive and ... I'm more compliant.
Maybe by the time he got to her, he was unable to ejaculate.
Did you get any prints on that knife?
And by his own admission, Mullins had been in that house at least a couple of nights.
Excuse me.
Did you see me last night?
Who was I with? Describe him. Was he white, black, tall? Hair color, car?
Who was room 229 registered to?
I may have been roofied and raped. I woke up here. 
I, uh, improvised my own rape kit. I've got pubic combing, nail scrapings, vaginal swab, urine samples ...
I called you.
Yeah, I know procedure. I didn't want an official investigation. I-
Uh ... I got to get this, uh, stuff to the lab. Room 229, it's right up there. Please print it. And keep it between us.
Thanks.
Yeah.
No. Thanks.
I said I didn't need your help.
It's a urine sample.
Get it to Tox. And ...  Check this for spermicide. Call me with the results.
Just do it.
Consider this a proficiency exam.
Sam. What are you doing here?
Oh, yeah. I heard about that, um ... I'm sorry I missed that. 
Monday.
Uh, yeah, I'll call you when she's had a chance to catch her breath.
Keep the change.
Excuse me.
You were working last night.
Do you remember me? I was ... I was here.
Well ... do you have any surveillance cameras in the place?
I'm with the Crime Lab.
So you've got nothing that covers the customers or the dance floor, or ... ?
I did the best I could, Lindsey.
Work just ... really got out of hand.
Lindsey. I really am sorry. I hate it when work gets in the way. I love to watch you dance.
You did? That's so great!
Fantast ...
Is my daughter okay?
Lindsey!
Lindsey!
Lindsey ... !
I don't need that. I'm fine.
No -- 
I'm refusing treatment. Just give me the release form.
Just give me the damn form!
They got Lindsey. Warrick: I know.
They took Lindsey.
It was an SUV. And it was silver or brown.
And they drove that direction. I never saw it coming.
They came from this direction.
These are acceleration marks. They were waiting for us.
I should've told you, but I didn't want a sermon. I did my own rape kit. Came back negative.
I appreciate that.
I-I know.
Any luck on the prints?
That's impossible.
Don't go there, Nick. They were gonna get to me, one way or another. It had to have been at least two guys -- one who was driving the Cougar, and the other in the SUV.
He reached through the window. Print the inside of that handle.
Sam?
It just happened. Who told you?
Well, I can't talk right now. I'll let you know when we find something out.
Sure, Sam.
Sam!
What do you know about what happened to Lindsey?
Who's using us to get to you? This is your granddaughter we're talking about. What the hell do you know?
'Can you guess what you're going to give me' What does that mean? Who's behind this?
Where is she? Who has her?
Like hell! I blame you! I blame you for this!
Business? You don't have a business. You're a thug in thousand dollar shoes! 
Thanks for not disappointing me, Sam.
What?
Lindsey!
Lindsey!
Where are you, Lindsey?!
Lindsey! Lindsey!
Lindsey!
All right.
I'm right here, Lindsey. Right here. I'm right here.
I'm right here. I'm right here. I'm right here.
Deep breaths.
Breathe easy. Deep breaths.
Okay. It's okay. I got you. I got you. Everything's okay.
It's okay. It's okay, baby. It's okay. Everything's okay.
I got you. Everything's okay.
She says she's fine. The doctor is assessing her now. We still don't have an ID.
Yeah. Yeah, he was there.
I can't get a face.
Did you get a name?
Thirteen alleles in common with Robert O'Brien?
The guy who grabbed Lindsey is Robert O'Brien's brother?
Joe Hirschoff. O'Brien's partner.
Hi, Sam.
Everybody in town knows you're here every Thursday night. And usually with my mother.
Just save it. I only came here to tell you to call off your guys.
Joe Hirschoff and his partner invested everything they had in the Eclipse. But it went bankrupt before you broke ground. You formed a new corporation to finish the project, leaving those guys with nothing.
Uh-huh. O'Brien and Hirschoff lost $20 million, right? O'Brien caved and stuck a gun in his mouth. Hirschoff wants you to pay him back. So, where is he?
Come on, Sam, this isn't old Vegas anymore. Let the police handle it. Or have you already killed him?
Sam? Sam?
Somebody help me!
Is she going to be okay?
Heather, I'm Catherine Willows. I don't know if you remember me. It's going to be all right.
Did you call Grissom?
Who found her?
You've got something to look forward to, Jim.
Chewing tobacco. Looks fresh.
Lady Heather has a house for this. Why take her show on the road?
Yeah.
Did she have ligature marks?
Well, that doesn't make any sense. She was a dominatrix. Not a submissive.
Or somebody didn't know the rules.
S &amp; M is a rich man's sport. Kind of like hockey -- a lot of equipment.
Heather told me, five years ago, she was clearing 20 grand a week.
Beautiful ... smart, intense ... charming. The only woman I've ever seen rattle Grissom. I mean, he kind of liked that forensic anthropologist, Terry Miller. Remember her?
But she wasn't enough of a challenge for him.
Heather, on the other hand ... uninhibited and can beat him at mental chess. 
They had chemistry. And he is a scientist.
I have no proof and I know he'd never tell me, but I'm certain they spent the night together. Wonder which one wore the chaps.
I mean, more power to him, really, to find somebody outside of work
My fantasy does not include costumes, or pain ...
-- and certainly not sawdust.
You?
The substance that I found under the saloon window was chewing tobacco.
Yeah, Vernon Porter. He was fired from the force back in Chicago.
Oh.
I'm thinking he had a front row seat.
Yeah.
There's no way that he could afford her. So why would Heather cover for him? Unless he's just a witness.
Gate's unlocked again.
Maybe.
Okay, come on, Jim, give it up. I know you know something about Grissom and Lady Heather.
Oh, yeah, he's dead.
Who shot the sheriff?
Ruger Single Six. Gun hasn't been fired.
Might have threatened her.
Well, the one that killed Porter's still inside him. Porter was shot in the back. He was facing away from the saloon.
To get to the window, this bullet had to be fired from the opposite direction.
Oh, wow. These look authentic. All revolvers.
I'll get the guns to ballistics.
We're investigating a homicide.
You were there all night. Want to explain why? Look, I know that you don't go home and cuddle your insects every single night, but why would you go there knowing that we're in the middle of an investigation? And now she's a prime suspect with you as her alibi.
So, when your personal life gets tangled up in a case, that's off limits?
Isn't that a little hypocritical? 
You know I'd slap you, but I think you'd enjoy it too much.
Your timing sucked.
What's this? So now you're building your own?
Well, the underwear that I pulled from the toilet was a 38-inch waist. Porter was a 34. He didn't attack Heather.
One of Heather's clients pays for a kinky Wild West fantasy only to discover he had an audience?
'Cause she's not talking. Her business is based on discretion. Couldn't count on Porter's discretion.
Oh, Mandy got a hit off the revolver and the ammo box.
Benjamin Oakley.
Yeah, I'm calling Brass.
Hey, Jim ...
You took a shot at Porter.
This is a warrant for your DNA.
To prove that you also attacked Heather Kessler.
Open up.
Comparing construction materials of the new doll to see if it's the same work as the others?
Is there any doubt?
So in trying to catch the killer, we've changed his behavior.
What?
Well, there was no physical trace on any of the other dolls or the miniatures.
Must be on a separate circuit than the lights. I just reset the breaker. That do the trick?
What you got?
The outlet doesn't look scorched.
Looks like some burned skin. The sink is still damp. Hey, hit that crack.
I think we may have found the Mini Killer's booby trap.
Sink is cracked, water pours in, touches the bracket ... Trevor touches the water ... zap.
You saying the killer's the next-door neighbor?
So the genius steals power from his neighbor and ends up electrifying Trevor's sink.
Doesn't explain what that doll was doing there, though.
'Great Rainone and His Little Bisque Doll.' Oh, that looks like the doll images from the miniatures. What's a bisque?
A grown man who sticks his hand up the back of a doll and speaks like a girl. Sounds healthy.
Who's Chloe?
Okay, we're in a David Lynch movie. Where's the dwarf?
So, being a performer and a parent had to have been hard at times.
Had the girls been fighting?
The Great Rainone is in great denial. Of course, losing a child at the hands of another could do that to you. You do agree that Natalie killed Chloe, right?
Let's just focus on the details. There's always something to go on.
Here in the lab?
I don't know. This just feels different.
Some white cotton fibers. Probably from the towel. Could be she was dragged into the elevator.
From any floor except this one.
Well, no 13th.  Yeah, unlucky numbers. Different countries, different superstitions. That was something Sam taught me.
And we just eliminated the one we're on.
Thirty-three floors.
That's all right, David. Why don't you help me turn the body? Examine her for injuries.
Wait a second. 
A rose petal. American Beauty.
Oh!
I'm gonna take a wild stab and guess drowning.
We got a dead cop.
I know these suites. This furniture's been moved.
What is this is, an eight-sided pattern? Feng shui?
Now we know how you drown in an elevator. You don't.
Don't step in. Just take a look around and do you notice anything missing or out of place?
And do all your infinity tubs come with rose petals?
When the water flows, the money flows?
I think that working helps. I mean, you know that.
Any chance it was an accident?
Oh, yeah. Someone held her down.
... put up a fight.
He knew there were cameras in the elevators, but not in the hallways or the service area.
His sleeve is wet.
Stop and smell the roses.
Mr. Hsing, I'm Catherine Willows, from the Crime Lab, and I need to see the suit that you wore last night.
A rose petal from the victim's body was found to contain traces of vitisvinifera -- grapeseed oil. The kind that this hotel puts in your tub. We know that the killer's shirt was wet, so I need to see your clothes.
Thank you.
Rose petals in the bathtub had traces of grapeseed oil. Killer's sleeves were wet.
Dry cleaner screwed us.
Yeah. Enough to keep that body moving, and leave me with a lot of partials.
By what?
Maybe it was his payday.
Personal.
Uh, David, hang on.
Well, it's not necessarily a woman's.
All right, slick. Now what's with the suit?
Today ended ...  ... an hour and a half ago.
Well, if that's the case, why don't you help my day end quicker and help me isolate some shoe treads.  Take the pants.
So ... ? How'd you do on the stand?
Female?
How many different patterns you have there?
Well, I've got three different ones on the t-shirt.
I mean, this one that looks like an athletic shoe sure got around. As did this pointed toe high-heeled one. Check out the heel mark.
What do you know about work boots? I'm guessing you haven't worked a day of hard labor in your life.
Yeah, for skinheads.
You know, one of the victims was Hispanic, the other was Jewish. Maybe this was a hate crime.
Is that your number, Cha Cha?
So tell me ... what does a dead guy sound like?
Oh, is that funny?
Someone called you from his phone-- who was it?
12:33 A.M., last night.
Who's this guy?
Farami, huh?
If it was real, I might.
When I swab that knockoff Farami buckle and I find this tourist's DNA on it, you're going down for murder.
No, but Mr. Ruiz did. And you were the last person that he called. That connects you to both crimes.
And what did Tara want?
Is that your idea of a party?
A what?
Why would you want to do that?
And you do this all the time?
What is Pig's name?
So if ... fannysmackin' is all about tourists, why'd you go after a dishwasher at the Golden Sapphire?
Oh ... the king swine.
It could be a mass text. Lindsey once sent everyone in her phonebook the same message at the same time. I got stuck with a $300 bill.
From Tara's phone? They'll know it's us.
We don't have Pig's phone.
Okay, but how do we get the pig?
Pig and the piglets are in the pigpen.
Did you know that Pig, aka Cole Tritt, was the only adult. The rest of them were under 18. One was 14.
I mean, they weren't all delinquents. Demitrius James was a college student.
Make me slit my wrists, why don't you? I'm raising a teenager here.
Hi. 
Grissom said you could use some help. What haven't you done?
Hope I die before I get old.
Bloody glass.
Any luck?
Drug panel on his urine came back negative. He's clean.
No pain meds in her system either.
Well, there wasn't any trace of Fentanyl in the nephew's system.
If that's the case, it's motive for both.
Hey, could you do me a favor? Um, bring me one of the swabs?
There's some white trace on the soles of her feet. You were at the scene. Did you happen to notice any white material that might have transferred?
Hmm. Excuse me.
Would you help me remove her dress?
Let's just roll her.
That look like a needle mark?
And she stayed?
So, that's a three-and-a-half-hour window.
Thank you.
Can you tell me anything about these bites?
So, it's unlikely it's coyotes.
Are you going to be okay with this one?
Mmm. She was found with a bunch of dead dogs. What about the husband's tux?
You just exonerated our only suspect.
It's called your salary. What have you got?
Phenytoin and pentobarbital. An anti-epileptic and a sedative hypnotic?
Dog bites, mass dog grave, euthanizing solution. Well, those drugs are controlled substances, so their sales should be registered.
Del Santos Kennel.
Yeah, Nicky, where are you?
We need to see your controlled substances; any records you have on a confiscated dog named Hannibal; and I'll have to print everyone who works here.
Anybody else have access?
Are you a licensed veterinarian?
Oh, I didn't realize that techs were allowed to perform surgeries.
What do you think that is?
There's a hidden camera in the medicine cabinet pointing right at it. It's an awful lot of blood.
We've got the victim's blood and hair at your kennel. She died of an overdose of the same drugs that were found in a medicine cabinet that only you had access to.
Mr. Card, I found this hidden camera in the exam room. Where's the receiver?
How do you figure? It was on the morning news that Lizzie was dead. And when I came into work ...
So instead of calling the police, you cleaned up the crime scene.
You cheated them out of $50,000?
Gee, I hate to see the sport tainted like that.
Okay ... what is this?
The victim was tied to that stand.
What's 'everything'?
Classic he said/he said.
There's no forced entry at the kennel. He has no alibi.
He has a good lawyer. Realized that we were onto his client and wanted to throw us off the scent.
Problem is, we don't have enough evidence to convict either one of them.
Well, you don't look like a guy who just got a confession.
You think he would have gone to the kennel with her?
Check the phone records.
Hi.
Yeah, it's a violent sport. Check out his hand. Riders live with constant injuries and pain.  They always get on that next bull and try like hell to hang on for the next eight seconds.
I used to date a bull rider. Cowboy up.
So there's just a few bills in his pockets. David, why don't you give me a hand here?
Some guys keep valuables in their boots.
That guy was a walking time bomb. Any trauma with sufficient force would snap that vertebra and sever the spinal cord.
Forget how to use the scissors?  Put your fingers in the holes and squeeze.
This looks like semen.
Oh, God, that movie made me cry.
You don't say.
Riding glove. So he wasn't planning on re-riding Wintwister when he left here.
Bed looks used. Maybe he partied with Tiffany.
Nobody ever wrote me a poem.
That's sweet.
Sounds like it was more than a money relationship.
Broken bones -- he gets up and rides again.
COD was multiple blunt force trauma.
Yellowish.
Maybe Cody had rejection issues. Could be why she was leaving him.
Well, that's over an hour after Cody's body was found. Thanks, Jim.
Hey.
Well, it is his truck.
So ... get this. There's a witness that puts Tiffany's TOD after Cody's. He didn't kill her.
So ... say this partner thought Tiffany knew something about the semen rustling and he ran her over to keep her quiet.
We've got Cody's phone. Find out who he's been talking to.
And we know that someone other than Cody put the electroejaculation equipment into the truck and drove away.
Now, that's the rope that I collected from Cody's room?
Jim?
We ran his ten-card against the prints from the truck and the equipment. They don't match.
Right. So now, I'm convinced that Cody Latshaw's death was not an accident.
It's kind of a lonely life, these cowboys, every weekend a different town.
Yeah, but no man is an island. I mean, obviously, he had feelings for Nancy or he wouldn't have written her that poem.
The bull?
Either that, or the killer's got a wicked sense of humor.
Oh, yeah, yeah. I know, Dave. Everybody knows that.
Looks like the Lady lost a heel.
No, it's ... uh ... it's the wrong color. It's too red.
And I am not seeing any prints. It's been wiped clean.
The vase is clean. I've got a spiral notebook filled with dates, times and weights. Looks like she was a bit concerned about her size.
That guy looks familiar. Oh, that's Vincent Lafoon. He and his brother own the place.
He's trying to make it look like somebody broke in. I think he's framing Zarco.
I don't know, but according to Brass's notes, he thought the system was down. So, we found no physical evidence linking Zarco to the scene. Vincent knew he had an easy fall guy. He's been playing us the whole time.
But if she had been gored first by another weapon and then axed, there would have been a lot more blood.
Her body came up light?
Well, we should go back, expand the search perimeter, try to find the actual murder site.
Okay.
Nick. Why don't you ... uh ... take the offices, and Ronnie and I will start in the storage area.
Hey, Nicky, what do you got?
Okay, I'll ... uh ... meet you back at the lab.
Busy.
No, thanks.
Sometimes, yeah.
I don't go out with persons of interest in an ongoing investigation.
Don't call me pookie.
Catherine.
Catherine.
If you're implying that you know something about Weatherly's death, and you're not giving it up, that makes you, at a minimum, an accessory after the fact, -- 
-- and that buys a long stretch for a stubby guy.
Here's my card.
If there's anything that you want to tell me as it pertains to the case ... 
Uh ... call me.
Hey, Ronnie, anything?
It's supposed to.
I think we just found our murder weapon. Hidden in plain sight.
Looks like Weatherly's missing heel.
This is where she died.
Ah, damn. 
Oh, good.
Auxiliary generator just kicked in.
And I don't have any service.
I'm going to get a dolly for you to move this thing. Photo it and get it back to the lab.
This is Catherine.
Yeah, you'd better. They're department issue. And if you lose it, you replace it.
Oh, yeah.
We found the pipe that killed Weatherly. It's in the print lab being processed. She was killed on the soundstage and then dragged over.
Okay. Let me know what you find out.
What do you want?
I know.
Okay, shoot.
Where are you?
I thought there was no phone transmission from there.
I just came from there. Why didn't you tell me then, you annoying little man?
If you're screwing with me, I will to string you up and beat you senseless.
Control, this is C-13 Willows, trying to contact C-147
Okay, thanks. Over and out.
Ronnie ... 
... uh ... I'm, I'm coming. 
Just ... just stay on the line. 
Ronnie? 
Ronn—
Dispatch, this is C-13 Willows requesting backup to meet me at Repulsion Pictures.
Ronnie! 
Good question. David was in Henderson on another call, so, when Greg and I got here, we just started processing the house. 
Found the victim in the bathroom, covered with a towel. We got a plastic print on the bathroom door. It's the strongest piece of evidence -- I photographed it and transmitted the image back to the lab; Mandy got a hit to an unknown palm; case info was in ViCAP. And then, Dispatch called, telling me to stop processing immediately, by order of the FBI.
Oh, beats the hell out of me.
Well, there may be a resemblance, but kids change a lot in six years.
Agent Malone, why don't I fill you in on what else we do know. There are no signs anywhere that the boy actually lived here. The sleeping bag on the couch indicates that he was probably a house guest. Why don't you follow me into the kitchen. 
Bring us up to speed, Greg. 
Which suggests that he was an experienced criminal. What do you know about this guy?
Well, this time, we think it's hammer.
The round indentation wounds are consistent with hammer blows. Do you see any similarities between this victim and the babysitter who was killed six years ago?
Covering a body usually indicates remorse on the part of the killer.
Maybe he knew Carmen Davis. There's three toothbrushes, two of them in travel cases. My guess: the killer was staying here with the little boy. There was no sign of forced entry.
So, I assume we'll be sending over the case evidence to Quantico?
Half an hour? 
Was she raped?
I'll get it to DNA.
And takes it with him.  Was the babysitter raped?
Most four-year-olds will do what you tell them. Most ten-year-olds will do what they want.
So, I cross-referenced similar-patterned unsolves in ViCAP by proximity to rail spurs. There's at least a dozen cases.
If these are the work of your guy, he's piled up one hell of a body count.
We ran the fingerprints that Nick lifted from the casino IRS form. Got an AFIS hit. Terry Lee Wicker. Served two years in Sing Sing for burglary. He got out four months before Jack's original kidnapping, and get this, when he was sent up, he was married to Gina Farentino. Brass put out a broadcast.
Meadowood. It's off the 93, and it looks to be about ... 16 miles northeast of your location.
It's okay. Brass has a line on the resident director.
Hey! Let her on through.
I saw this documentary once on suicides off the Golden Gate Bridge, and they interviewed a survivor and he said the moment that he let go of the railing, he realized that all of his problems were fixable, except for having jumped.
Uh, yeah, Nicky, what you got?
Well, the body landed close to the building, so if she didn't come from the roof, she must have come out of a room.
Hang on.
Yeah, there's a long perimortem abrasion on the lower back.
Hey. What do you think this might be?
Yeah. We think she was pushed. So, between her knuckles -- suggests a struggle?
There's no trauma, but the wet mount indicates that she definitely had s*x.
Yeah. Such a scary thing, sending your kid off to college.
Yeah. In fact, we looked at WLVU last month.
She's free on campus, might as well be a thousand miles away.
Oh, yes, I remember this case. A high school senior at age 12.
Well, we don't know that just yet. I mean, we don't have Marlon's DNA to compare with the semen that was found in the victim. All the old evidence was expunged with the verdict.
And no vaginal trauma because she was too numb to resist. It's possible.
You know, that just sounds like something a girl tells her parents in order to make them feel better. I mean, we know she had s*x. There was GHB in her system ... I think you just need to test everything in her room that she may have ingested.
Hi.
Husband and wife got into it.
She caught him with a hooker in their bed. She cut him. He killed her.
She grabbed his wallet and took off. I caught the guy just sitting on a curb. I swabbed his hands for blood spatter.
He's not going anywhere. Thanks, Mia.
Oh, hey, guys. I could really use a drink. You want to join me? I'm buying.
You did?
All right. 
Okay.
Bruised, but not broken.
No, I'm good, thanks.
You?
Uh, yes, I have a daughter.
If I don't get home soon, I will be in trouble. 
Thanks. I needed this.
I can't do this tonight. I ... I'll call you.
Go to hell.
Hello.
Mom, Mom. Grissom just called. I've got to go in. I'm backing up grave.
I brushed my teeth. 
Hey, listen, Lindsey's got a dentist appointment before school. I wrote all the information down in the kitchen.
Okay? Thank you.
You're welcome.
Clotted blood hasn't retracted yet.
We have an ID?
I walked into a door. Can we not talk about it?
No cartridge casings.
Maybe she knew her attacker.
Can you open it up?
Thank you.
I found a gun under the seat. 
.22 Beretta.
I'm not in the mood.
Did you see her leave with anyone?
Which cab company?
Doesn't explain the gun.
Thank you.
I thought judges were supposed to be color blind.
I found some particulate on the jacket. Not sure what it is. I'll get it to Hodges.
Can I see that?
You know, I've got to go pick up Lindsey. Could you cover for me?
Thanks.
Lindsey!
What happened to the trash?
Yeah, I'm great.
Can't get into this now, Mother. I'm in a jam.
Save the sermon.
There but for the grace of God ... 
Damn it.
I threw something away. It's gone.
Yeah? Uh ... yeah, just wait till I get there. Yeah. 
Mom ...
Oh. What do you have for me?
I know.
I know.
We found the .22 in Alice's car.
Is that when you gave her the gun?
You know where we can find Jeff Simon?
Look, we can get a court order.
I'm gonna check out his truck.
Gil, the suspect has a laptop in his vehicle that has a GPS unit that's honed in on the lab.
I know. That's why I'm calling.
Yeah.
Thanks.
He was tracking her car. Let's bring him in.
Is that your idea of love? Stalking her with a GPS unit?
Well, there's a problem with your story. She called a cab.
Cut the crap. We found trace amounts of automotive sheet metal on her clothing. You work around cars. If Alice picked it up from you, you were in violation of the T.R.O.
It was over, Jeff. She didn't want you to be her lover, her protector. She didn't want you within a hundred yards. Whatever trace from you we found on her was fresh.
You were living a fantasy, thinking you still had a chance. When reality set in, you killed her.
Do you have a minute?
Okay, uh, it really is only gonna take a minute. Um, I just need to have a conversation with you.
Right.
Two?
Are you saying that all the DNA evidence from the last two days has to be resubmitted and retested?
How the hell did that happen? 
It's proof he lost track of her.
Which they'll probably kick down to a misdemeanor because she's dead.
You got a name?
Mr. Novak ... I'm Catherine Willows, CSI.
We should ask for his clothes. Black leather jacket, black t-shirt, jeans.
This is what I was trying to tell you.
He's not lying about anything that pertains to me.
No, it was an accident. But ... by the time it happened, he wasn't who I thought he was, and ... that scared me.
I have nothing to be ashamed of.
I met Adam Novak in a bar called the Highball.
I had one cocktail, on his tab. He walked me out to my car. Things got physical.
I believe that I outlined the specifics in my memo.
I didn't have s*x with him, though he clearly wanted it.
I went out after shift to unwind. I even invited Warrick and Nick to come along. They had other plans.
Yeah. I got into my car. He went back inside.
This is just a theory, but ... she was drunk, probably more compliant than I was. He walked her outside. He waited with her for the taxi, offered her a ride ... 
We'll finish this later?
Yeah. Like the other night.
Can you remove the jacket?
Looks like a small-caliber gunshot wound ... like the first victim.
Grave is working a case with similarities. That victim left a bar called the Highball shortly before she was killed. I'm wondering if Holly went out last night.
Thanks.
There's two sets of shoe prints ... with a bit of distance between the strides. Which means they were both running.
Well, there's only one shot fired in Grissom's case.
I'm thinking that she was attacked near her house ... and then made a run for it.
Got a courthouse keycard. For the parking lot.
Adam Novak's a public defender. Let's run his prints against this.
Anyone write their number on a matchbook?
So ... you're having a good time and ... Holly had had enough.
When Holly left, did you see that man again?
Hell of a backlog, here, doc.
Holly Pearson?
.25 caliber. It's the same as the first victim.
She bit her attacker ... when he tried to kiss her.
Mom, Lindsey, go inside the house.
Mom, we're fine. Take Lindsey inside.
Lindsey.
No. I'm coming in. I want to hear about your day.
What the hell are you doing here?
I want you out of here.
You want to talk to me, call your lawyer. Set up an appointment down at PD.
Back off.
If you take one more step.
You came to my house.
Nick.
The center console. Was there a parking lot car key inside?
Suspect claims some incriminating evidence found at the second crime scene wasn't his. It looks like he was lying. We got him.
The Slim Jim.
And then locked the car back up. Novak wouldn't be the wiser until he drove into the courthouse again. Did you find any prints?
Run 'em.
Have you been in Adam Novak's car recently?
Then why did we find your prints in it?
No, but I think that you're familiar with the concept. You were obsessed with Alice, and when you saw Adam having at her, you flipped out.
I mean, here's a woman that you can't get any traction with, yet she's willing to do a stranger she picked up in a bar.
I mean, lucky for you, the Highball was Adam's second home.
The next night, you came back and saw his car in the parking lot. Creative justice. You could get them both.
It was just bad luck that Holly Pearson met Adam that night.
You had no reason to kill her, but you followed her home and worked up the nerve.
You made one mistake, though. The evidence that you used to frame him brought us back to you
Gil.
I'd ask you out for a drink, but under the circumstances, it's, uh ...
Okay, how long is this going to go on?
Gil, it was an act of omission.
I went out after work. Is it a crime to want a little human contact?
How did she get from Harvard to here?
Lady Heather told me. She was very proud of her.
Well, it looks as though she hasn't checked her mail in ten weeks. The postmark dates back to November 12th.
Betz Clinic?
Including the employees?
We'll need to see those testing rooms.
How do you monitor your patients?
What is your screening process?
No, I wouldn't.
Here's Zoe Kessler at the start of her session. 
And here she is at hour number four.
Except ... check it out.
Look at the bottom right hand corner.
See that shadow? Somebody opened the door.
Here's Jack Landers. 
Except he never returned. Wolfowitz works at the clinic. He has access to both victims. One victim was found less than mile from his house, which smells like human decomp.
How do we get to him?
Gil, I saw him. Yesterday. He wasn't frozen. I mean, maybe he knew too much, and someone at Betz sensed that we were getting to close and ... 
Well, I know what I saw.
I'm on it.
So, none of the fingerprints from the car belong to Jacob Wolfowitz. They're all a match to a Leon Sneller.
That's John Sneller.
Which explains how I saw and how Lady Heather ... did a dead guy. 
I thought that she killed him, too. I would've. I mean, I wouldn't have slept with him first, but ...
Which makes you wonder who's on the autopsy table. Sneller joined the army in 1985. He was stationed at a field hospital near Berlin until about a year ago.
At which point, I think that he came to Vegas, ... 
... put his brother on ice, started impersonating him.
I mean, I know this theory's a little out there, but given the evidence ... it's the only conclusion that makes any sense.
Given twins ... go with twins.
Love what he's done with the place.
I found a blue pill in the car. Tox came back, didn't match any known pharmaceutical.
Shabbat shalom.
I think this is a gynecological device from a hundred years ago.
Zoe Kessler would've made the perfect uber-woman except for her one brown eye.
Hey, check out the face of the clock.
Sir ... 
Massive blood loss was the cause of death.
Well, the other twin didn't make it.
That explains Judaica. I guess Jacob went nurture and Leon went nature.

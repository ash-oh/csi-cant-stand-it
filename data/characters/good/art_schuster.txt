Hello there. Can I help you?
Well, why don't you just check out our spaceship isle. Yeah. I just need to help this little fellow here.
Look, you really need to buy these polyhedral dice. Just in case. You're always losing them, man.
Come on down to Schuster's Hobby Shop. A whole world awaits you.
Well, hey, Dr. Grissom. How's the ... uh ... miniature going?
Oh, man. He struck again?
Oh, yeah, I made that. For a chick, man.
Uh ... let's see ... Natalie.
Uhâ€¦I-I didn't think to write it down. 'Paid cash. Call cell phone when ready.'
Late 20s, early 30s ... She's about yay high. Uh ... brown hair. Uh ... she's kind of a skinny chick. Weird.
I got guys who come in here trying to recreate Civil War battles hoping for a different outcome. I get the desperate housewives who are trying to build the perfect Thanksgiving dinner. Control freaks with social problems that's my bread and butter, but ... uh ... this chick, she had ... crazy eyes, you know.
You know what? She came in a few days ago.
She ... yeah! She bought one of these.
You just attach that to anything you want to animate. Just like, uh ... like this, see.
No one ever wins.

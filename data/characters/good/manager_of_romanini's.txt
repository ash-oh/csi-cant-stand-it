How can I help you people?
Crime Lab? What's going on?
Not that I recognize. No.
Oh, you mean 'Moses'. 
Yeah. Guy had a beard down to here, wore a robe, the army jacket. Stood out here scaring every patron I had.
Guy was ruining my business.
I tried to reason with him.
Hey! Hey, buddy, you've g t to leave my customers alone, okay? 
Here. Cash that and move on.
That's the last I saw of him.
I don't know. About two months ago.
Okay.
Back seat. Then I drove him out of town. I left him on the side of the road, out by Red Rock.
No.
Look, he was drunk. He was rolling all over my backseat. So I put him in a bag from my trunk. Once we got out of town, I just tipped him down the hill.
I figured he'd get out once he slept it off. The guy always shows up. What am I looking at?
Look, I was just doing my job.

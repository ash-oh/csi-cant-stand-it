You found blood ... in my trash can?
No.
No.
I'm fine.
Why don't you go inside and make some dinner?
Whatever you want. Charlie, homework.
Later.
Yeah. Five years.
What the hell was I supposed to say? My wife went out to get her hair done and never came home.
Aaww, you people. You know, you were here five years ago with your grid searches, your dogs, your cadets -- you came up empty. You give me a good reason why my wife left me, I'd love to hear it, because I tried the truth. I didn't know what happened. You know what I got for it? They all think I killed my wife. Her parents sued me for custody. I lost my job, my friends. Only thing I got left are those kids and this house.
She came back about a month ago. Doorbell rings ... 
huh, what do you say?
Well, they say time heals all wounds. It's crap. I hate her for what she did to us, but I swear, it was the first time I felt anything in five years.
I didn't even know she was dead. Thought she'd just left me again. 
I'm an adult.
It's a matter of public record. We've been filling out those forms for five years.
So what?
And she had one on me. We did that for the kids.
I did not kill my wife.
Who?
Nora is pregnant?
What are you accusing me of?
I bought that for my wife.
Nora? How could she even know about ...
You know you mean the world to me, don't you?

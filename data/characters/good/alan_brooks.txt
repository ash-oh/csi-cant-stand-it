Lieutenant Alan Brooks. This is my brother Leland.
Have a seat. Things must be pretty slow in Vegas to get one of you guys out here so quick.
Mmm, not particularly.
Listen, I filed the report. I sent in the head. Five'll get you ten, there's not much left of that body out there but coyote turds.
Look, nobody from this community's been reported missing. And I just don't have the resources to go searching for what might be left.
There'd better be a whole lot more of you out there.
Have a good one, Marty.
Trouble with the wife?
Or what's left of 'em. No offense, Sylvia, but he's not exactly a scent hound.
So, are we done here?
Yeah.
Barry, drop the doughnut. You're gonna earn your pay today.
Afraid you gonna trip over something?
Must be nice to know the answer to every little thing.
And I don't, I suppose. Remember that waitress, Doris? Well, she's got an ex-husband likes to smack her around every once in a while. High school's got a dozen meth-heads who like boosting motorcycles and then drag racing 'em down main street, when they think nobody's watching. Fire chief's a closet pyro, and so forth. See, I don't have a lot of time to ask questions about buzzards and such. 
That's an aspen tree, in case you were wondering.
Let me guess. You like bugs?
I'd say about four feet, depending on ... how he's stuffed in there.
Unless the killer had help.
It's like you said -- he was cut.
Are you saying he was alive when he was buried?
Hey, Einstein, we going to stand here all day or what?
Punishment for what?
It's about time, Dale.
Thanks, Doc. That's nice work. Can we get it out now?
Okay, so what do you want to do, call your lab? Have them send the right gear, the right guys, what?
All right. Out of the way, Doc. Pardon me.
Can we please get on with getting him out of there? We're losing light.
And then what?
Barry, it's your lucky day. Get your car. Come on.
Well, you can't dig a hole and hold a gun on an unbound victim all at the same time.
Or more than one killer.
Oh, what the hell was that for?
Why, is that French for 'evidence'? Straight drive, Barry. Stay out of the casinos.
You boys have a good night.
Yeah.
Anybody here seen a black or blue mystery vehicle?
Well, I'd say that car's long gone by now.
Do you have a local suspect?
Oh.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
Knock yourself out.
No kidding?
That's going to cramp your style.
Kip.
Listen, why don't you come on by and fill out a report about that kit.
It wouldn't hurt.
Well, I am impressed. Wh ... where was it?
Uh-huh. 
Oh, well, nearest station's in Elko. Should take 'em a couple hours to get here.
Oh, I don't want to disturb the scene. You carry on. 
Well, unless you've managed to improvise yourself a warrant as well, this is an illegal search.
Nobody. Owner died a few years ago.
His nephew. Marty Cooperman. 
Runs the gas station.
So talk. 
Just call them.
What?
And you can you prove that?
Just what the hell are you saying?
Yes.
That is nobody's business.
No, he was married. He has a kid.
She left him flat, ten years ago. So, what?
Get in.
What are you worried about? You do have a gun, don't you?
Look, um, just give me a minute with him.
Leland. We need to ask you a few ...
Never mind him. You and I need to have a talk.
What are you doing? You put that ... put that down!
Put that down!
Don't you...!
Leland!
Leland!
Yeah, until he's ready to go home.
That's not the way I saw it. FYI, Leland's always run pretty hot. Now, that's no secret. As a matter of fact, back in high school he and Marty Cooperman played football together. One Friday night, after a couple of beers, Marty started busting on Leland. And Leland just busts him back. And I helped. And we fractured Marty's leg in three places.
No, I didn't do it for you. A man shouldn't go through life ashamed of who he is.
Yeah ... I figured you'd tell me when you were ready. I saw you with Ross. I stopped by here last weekend. You and he were taking a walk.
You got nothing to be sorry about. Nothing.
Hey, Marty.
Not one word since high school. Listen, when we found that torso in the hole, on the crest of that hill ... I recognized the kid's shirt, and I knew he'd been with Leland, so ...
Didn't even ask him what happened.
You don't keep any secrets, Mr. Grissom? Not even from your wife?

It was the happiest time in my life. I had realized my dream.
I was working in the movies. Though I was only in an entry-level position, Weatherly and I were already an item.
Just like ...
... Julia Roberts and what's his name.
We were in love.
And then it was all over in an instant.
Oh, God!
Oh, my God!
I was in rehab for six months. That slime ball Lafoon convinced me not to file a Worker's Compensation claim. He said that he'd take care of me.
Yes. And then, when the deadline passed to file my claim, Vincent offered me two grand, take it or leave it, and then he fired my ass. And I could have lived with that, but ...
Weatherly ... dumped me. She felt we were no longer compatible. The truth was, she couldn't stand to look at me. She cried when she told me. Actresses can do that. The smell of her skin ... like fresh lemon poppy seed scones baking in the oven. Gold flecks that danced like Valkyries in the emerald depths of her eyes. Her hair-- oh, God ... Her hair ...
I brought her gifts from time to time, to let her know that I still loved her. Is that against the law?
They wouldn't let me in the front door.
Why would I kill her?
Do I know you?
I'm trying to explain to you. I haven't been near that place in over a year. You got the wrong guy. I don't do that anymore. I'm in therapy now. Lots of therapy. Freudian, Jungian, Gestaltian -- all that crap. I've let go of my anger.
What happened, Lafoon? She get too old, so you killed her for real?
I never touched her. You know it, I know it, and they know it. You killed her, and you're going down.
Can I go now?
So long, Lafoon. I hope they tear you a big one.
Are you okay?
I really loved her.

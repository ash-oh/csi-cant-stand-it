Excuse me, Your Honor. The question's quite relevant. Are we just going through the motions here, so it looks like someone actually asked whether or not it's okay to run over black kids in the street?
Yeah. Are you also going to be censoring verbal questions?
I have a question.
Did you actually see Demetrius James attacking you?
So this was a death at the hands of another?
And what do you call that kind of death?
According to who? This is the first we've even heard that Demetrius James had a weapon.
How do we know the cops didn't plant it there?
A rock against two tons of steel.
What's department policy in a situation like that?
So what makes it okay to start running over people?
Look, look, I got nothing against Mr. Sanders personally, but all these inquests ever really seem to do is protect the cops. ...

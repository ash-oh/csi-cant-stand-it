That body should be up in a few minutes, Mr. Grissom.
Catherine?
There's someone waiting for you in reception.
Where's the rest of the body?
Human fat. Well ... I can tell you that the malleolus -- the ankle bone -- is completely hollowed out.
Bone marrow was reduced to ash.
Which means that the foot was burned off the body, not severed. That's consistent with your theory of spontaneous combustion.
Word gets around.
No, that's why I wore a clean coat. I'm just reporting my observations. If the foot had been severed, the marrow would still be intact.
Not yet. I want to send a scraping down to toxicology.
Excuse me. 
I want to check for any flammable compounds in the blood. Don't expect much.
The quality of the sample may have been compromised by the heat.
Yes, sir.
Erin McCarty, 20.
Cop said she's single -- she lives at home with her mother.
About six weeks.
Well, here's the reason the skin was funny.
Close. Biotone arterial. Promotes high diffusion and fast drainage in skin tissue.
Yeah. Yeah, I already ran her prints through work here. Got an I.D. right here.
I, uh, I just want to say I-I ... well, I really admire the gusto with which you approach your job.
Uh ...
Uh ... Grissom, Dr. Robbins wants to see you. Something about your skeleton.
If there's something under all this blood you'll be the first to know.
Stand-up guy.
Can you imagine getting that phone call? What a shame.
Checking liver temperature. Estimating time of death.
88.6 -- ten degrees below normal.
Well, he's not in rigor. TSD is under six hours. I'll move him as soon as you're finished.
None.
Excuse me, sir? I'm sorry to interrupt.
You're all clear for tonight.
My dad's a Colonel out at Nellis. Grissom's requested a meeting.
Mine are lined up right over there.
Stokes.
No sweat.
I like to put that off till the last possible moment with decomps. 
Silver, whole.  I've done a few of these. 
It looks like a pin. It's a medical implant. 
Oh, and that's a plate in the skull. The head's been rolled.
Yeah, and by the sound of things he's been dead about two months. 
You weren't here when ESD brought this in. 
Let's go to the V.I.P. room ... I'll show you what I mean. 
Remember, breathe through your mouth.
Metal plate.
... and...
Pile of bones and that's it.
Add some bacteria, a couple gases, and... voila!
I'll cremate this.
A decomp this bad can stink up the entire building ... forever. The sooner we dispose of this, the better.
Yep, she's next.
I hate it when you CSI guys get territorial.
Yes, sir. 
Nice to see you, Catherine. Well, I smell the body. Where is he?
I know you better than that.
I made a wrong turn back at the fork.
Grissom. 
Yeah, we're all set, Dr. Robbins.
If the poison was administered orally I may know how it got into the bloodstream.
Gastric ulcer.
In a healthy, functioning stomach, ...
... mucosa lines the walls and prevents the hydrochloric acid from burning the organ itself. 
... But if H. Pylori gets in there, sends the whole system off-balance, stops the mucosa, and causes an ulcer. 
Opens a direct channel from your digestive tract straight into your bloodstream. I know a lot about stress-related ailments.
Nick. Cool enough in here for you?
Ambient here's about 65 degrees, which makes core temp drop roughly two degrees per hour. Figure he's been dead five to seven hours.
Uh, yeah. Said they found him face down, head towards the rack.
Blow came from an object roughly rectangular in shape, resulting in a depressed fracture of the parietal bone,
... with radiating linear fractures extending outward from the point of impact. 
Based on the fracture pattern, I'd say it was a single strike to the head.
First hit's free.
And, uh, take a look at this. Black plastic. Found it in the wound.
Hey. She's hot pink, like a maraschino.
Death was not the result of natural gas inhalation.
Uh, yeah. Paramedics said they found them both in here.
Yeah.
Doc, I'm not quite sure how to proceed.  First exhumation.
Okay.
Wow. She's pretty well-preserved.
... removes the blood, retards bacterial growth, and, uh, pickles the tissue.
Why?
Oh. Okay.
Hey.
Suburbs are encroaching on the hinterlands. We'll know more after the autopsy.
Didn't have to do much of a 'Y.' Attack did it for me.
Bled out. Trauma to her internal organs. Spleen, liver, heart they all sustained multiple mastications.
They're human.
You can see the bridgework on this impression of a premolar and an adjoining molar.
Well, I can't give you the exact age but wisdom teeth erupt between 15 and 30. And there's no evidence of a wisdom molar on this impression.
Oh, one more thing. I found an infection in the mucus overlying the large intestine. This girl suffered from the e-coli bacteria.
Or a bad burger.
Oh, yeah. Spiked temp, vomiting, lower GI problems, the works.
No, sir. 
Yeah, but supervised. No one's touched him.
My high school science teacher used to say that your small and large intestines could stretch across the Brooklyn Bridge. 
Only 25 feet combined.
I'll tuck the viscera in the bio-hazard bag.
Excuse me, I'm headed over to the hospital. Taxi driver didn't make it.
Tilt it, sir?
Okay. Uh ... 
All right, man. Um ... I'll take the shoulders, you take the feet. Okay?
You ready? On three. One, two, three, up. And now tilt. 
Come on. Up. DAVID PHILLIPS: Okay, now tilt.
Oh, god. Up more, tilt more. Now. DAVID PHILLIPS: Uh, god.
Oh, down, down, put him down. DAVID PHILLIPS: One more time.
Ready, one time. One ... two, three, up. DAVID PHILLIPS: Oh, god.
S-sir, we can't get him. Uh, his knee's bent.
What did I do?
Toe to head.
Choking.
With this guy, my money's on choking.
85.5.
Hey. Tessa Press. School I.D. was in her pocket. She's 13.
After she died, blood settled to her anterior and lividity fixed. 
Yeah.
I'll defer that question to the insects.
Given the ambient temperature and last night's rain, I'd estimate she's been out here twenty-four hours.
If you're going to drive all the way out here to dump a body, why not take another ten minutes and bury her?
X-rayed Tessa's neck. Blade appears to have perforated her fifth cervical intervertebral disc, lacerating the spinal cord. 
Type of trauma suggests we're looking at asphyxia due to diaphragmatic paralysis.
Well, we did find her outside.
Warrick?
All right, I'm not going anywhere.
Body's fully rigid. Normally, I'd say the infant's been dead for a couple of hours, but in this weather, it's possible the infant died no more than an hour ago. I'm all through, Catherine.
Hey, you ready for me?
I've had better.
Sara, take a look at this. What is that?
Hey, I went through his pockets. No wallet, no I.D. Uh ... just some cash and these car keys.
It's a rental.
Good. Yeah.
Yeah.
Arachnodactyly. Abnormally long fingers.
Her liver temp's 83 degrees. She's been dead approximately ten hours.
Oh, yeah. Grab her feet.
Defensive wounds.
Incised.
At least a dozen.
Liver temp makes T.O.D. around midnight.
Sara, do me a favor and open the window, please.
Yeah. 
Take a look at the skin coloration on both victims.  Their bodies are slightly pink.
Oh, hello. The path to the body was made by the paramedics. They pronounced and took off. ID'ed has Kevin Staniland, age 30 from Reno. I figured before I processed the body, you'd want to photograph the crop circle.
Well, it's a circle in the middle of a field. What would you call it?
Lividity is fixed.
I have an idea. 
I'll keep it to myself.
Given the circumstances, alien was not an unreasonable conclusion at the time.
I'm engaged, but thank you. Could you just check out his pants? There's grass stains on his knees.
His tighty whiteys were soaked in urine. Don't know if it's pre- or post-mortem. 
I've got to document this.
Sir?
I know. A body disappeared.
Sir, this isn't my fault.
Yes, sir.
Walk you through what?
Okay, um, I brought him into the washroom ... 
I photographed the body, took hair and fingernail cuttings, emptied his pockets, removed clothing, washed his body, tagged him. I put him into the cooler and ... 
I haven't seen him since.
What?
Sir, this really isn't my fault.
I didn't do anything.
What would you like me to do?
I don ...
Right, 'cause you never authorized a transfer.
Body snatcher?
If you wanted to steal a body, wouldn't it be a lot easier to go to a hospital or university facility?
Ah, yes-- the guy we left on the bench.
Look, I'm ... I'm really sorry I didn't get here sooner. Maybe if I had ... 
There's no ID on him.
I sure will miss him.
Do you think he suffered?
Uno ...
Well, 'Y' not?
90 degrees? Given the timeline, it should be higher. That-that can't be right.
No signs of sexual assault.
Were you expecting some?
Well, maybe she was moved. Trunk of car? Tire iron?
Whoa.
Well, his liver's not where it's supposed to be.
Do you think this is some kind of birth defect?
Yes. Got the liver.
Hey. Just came from the hospital.
Oh. No, no.  Traffic fatality. 
Sorry.
Lividity suggests she hasn't been moved. Liver temp is 92 degrees, which means she's been dead four to five hours. 
Better you than me.
Single stab wound, just below the sternum. It feels domestic. Crime of passion? CATHERINE: Maybe?
Good point.
Blunt-force trauma on the forehead, and on the base of the skull.
She's been dead at least twelve hours.
You know, we're getting kind of backed up in here.
We got third Instar maggots. 
With this smell, she's been dead at least 48 hours.
No ID on the body.
Needle marks are sclerotic. Chronic user. Probable OD.
Maybe it's a 'dwarf' sign. Like Pluto is, you know, a 'dwarf' planet now.
It looks like an impact from a weapon.
She's pale. No sign of trauma. COD'll have to wait till autopsy. Sorry.
I've been through all the bedrooms. She's the last. Rebecca Mayford. Boyfriend ID'd her. Neck's clean. The other five victims' throats were transected. There are at least a dozen stab wounds to the chest and abdomen. 
Liver temp is 95.6. Been dead at least two hours, which is consistent with four of the five other victims.
You got it.
Hey. 
Bullet entered through his back.
No exit wound. There's some swelling under his lip.
Ugh, disgusting. You get mouth cancer from this.
Sure.
Two distinct lacerations -- one on the forehead, one on the back of the skull. Lividity is fixed. Decomp is pretty well developed.
Could be a couple of days to a few weeks.
Hello, Grissom.
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late. 
Yeah. Twenty-one days and counting.
On three: one, two, three.
Looks like animal bites on her arms and legs.
No purse or ID.
Hey.
Sure. What's up?
Maybe. I can't say for sure. I mean, there were dead dogs and trash all over the place.
Sorry.
Sure.
I'll send samples to Tox.
Hey, Doc.
I heard your band killed last night.
My wife's second cousin. Works in the mayor's office for the budget and finance director. He was at the country club. Grooved to your moldy oldies all night.
Sorry.
What did I do?
Her name's Elizabeth Rodriguez. She and her husband Felix were honored last night by the Nevada Enterprise Association. Humanitarians of the Year. They opened that outreach center in the Alphabets. They were dancing right in front of me.
Here you go.
These are the ones I took.
Oh, sure.
Cody's little doggies are right fragrant.
Lividity is fixed along the anterior aspect, and ... she is still in full rigor.
No panties. I'll do an SAE kit.
'The horror.'
The horror ...
Huh? Huh? Bra-Brando?  Brando from Apocalypse Now?
Oh. I'll get the gurney.
You really don't recognize her?
You've ever seen Chop Chop, Fizz Fizz?
Can I Lick The Spoon? 
They're classics.
You know what I loved about her? She really made you feel the terror. When she was scared for her life, I was scared, too.
That's all you've got to say?
Epiglottis? What about the pathos? I mean ... what about the humanity? This may be Weatherly's finest performance.
Oh, just watch the movie.
Based on levidity and rigor, TOD is roughly 24 hours ago. And he's got perimortem bruising on the back of the neck. And a single sharp-force injury to the forehead.
Yes, sir.
Agent Malone?
We're read to take the boy out.
Sorry, no ID.
It's the third jumper on campus this year. Maybe it's contagious.
Well, there's this. 
Gunshot. Looks like a small caliber weapon.
Look familiar?
Well, her clothes and underwear are undisturbed.
Sure.
Location of the entry wound is different.
Slug's still inside her.
Hey, Grissom.
Conditions are less than ideal. Is it okay if we just do a scoop and run?
Couldn't get an accurate reading. You want me to pull vitreous from the eye?

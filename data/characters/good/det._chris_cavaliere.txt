Hey. Victim's in the bedroom. Ty Hawkins, 12.
Mother came in to wake him ... found him like this.
This many blows; it was personal. 
No sign of forced entry. Nothing's missing. All the doors and windows were locked except for the screen door. Parents claim they keep that locked.
Negative. Family's been transported down to the station. I'm gonna go down and take their statement. Hey, when you're done here, roll by. We'll ink them.
Now, your wife said that you both went to bed after the news.
Please, just let him do his job. Sir ...
You and your wife are free to go.
He has to stay here in protective custody until this is resolved.
Right.
Can't allow that.
Neither has a record, no motive. There's no blood on them.
Their grief is not an act.
Years of listening to the parents of dead children. Let's go talk to this kid.
You're not fooling me, kid. The second I laid eyes on you, I knew how it went down. You took a pipe from the backyard, you went into Ty's bedroom, and while he was sleeping, you beat his brains to a pulp.
Now, what the hell's wrong with you, kid? Your little brother is dead. What did he ever do to you?
Now, don't look at him. He can't help you. Nobody can help you. You're going to prison. And at fourteen, that means life. 
Well, what are you getting at?
I don't tell you how to collect the evidence.
Then get to the lab and get me something that I can use. 
Hi, Stokes. Solve the case?
Really? Well, you know, uh ... I got a signed confession.
Mm-hmm. Sort of kicks the crap out of your 'evidence,' now, doesn't it?
Signed. Check it.
No, I used science, kind of like you guys.
I put him on a computer voice stress analyzer. Once I caught him lying, he gave it right up. 
Well, check their web site. It's still used in 1,400 state and local agencies.
He didn't ask for his mommy and daddy. Long as he says he understands his rights, we don't have to have anyone there with him.
No, but he will. Hey, listen, Stokes, thanks for trying to help, but we got him.
Stokes.
What the hell are you doing? Are you trying to screw with my case?
What, are you trying to help the defense now?
Hey, man ... if you're lying ...
So when did you find it?
Put him in lockup -- maybe it'll help his memory. 
Stokes ... I got a signed confession. You got a bum in a bloody sweater. What are you gonna do about it?
You never told me why.
Hey.  You owe me an apology.

That's him. That's my boy.
How did something like this happen? He's only 14 years old.
Have you arrested that taxi driver?
How did he not see my son? That's a well-lit intersection. My son is five foot six!
No, I don't understand.
No, no, nothing like that. He's a ... he's a great kid. He's-he's athletic. He's popular. He's, uh, he's a good student. We-we moved here from Portland nine months ago. He fit right in.
No. I thought he was at a friend's for dinner. He was supposed to call me, but you know teenagers.
Uh, I've been on the run from my ex-husband. He's threatened to kill me and my boys. I just try and stay one step ahead of him.
In Portland. He showed up outside of Todd's school. The boys and I were on a bus that evening. You know, a couple days ago, the phone rang. I answered it. It was him. I don't know how he found us here ... but this weekend, the boys and I were going to disappear.
John's my ex. Is he in Las Vegas?
That's what I told both my boys. I told them that John was killed in a car accident. It's not easy to lie to them like that but every time I move I have to make up some crazy story. I just want them to be able to sleep at night.
You think it's John?
No ... no, this ... this isn't John. This isn't my ex. This is Stewart. It's Stewart Bradley. He's my boyfriend.
Uh, Eric and I are leaving town.
Good.
Excuse me?
We have to get going.
From me.
I, um ... I hid it in a lock box. And, uh, when I got that call from John a couple of days ago I took it out and I put in my nightstand. I didn't even know it was missing until this morning. And then, I thought that John must've gotten in the house and taken it. I was so sure that he was the one who killed Stewart. I've spent the last ten years looking over my shoulder every day.
He asked me what was wrong and I shouldn't have said anything. He panicked. He overreacted. He started carrying a knife. What's going to happen to Eric?
And then?

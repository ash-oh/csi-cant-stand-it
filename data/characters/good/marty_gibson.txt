I'm telling you, this is great. You're going to love this. 30 miles to the gallon, very low maintenance. Your people are going to love it. You know what? I want you to tell them to throw away the manuals. 
Call me for anything. Marty Gibson doesn't close a sale, he opens a relationship.
How right you are. Marty Gibson.
Sometimes it's not about what you need, sometimes it's about what you want.
Your lips.
Whoa, gentlemen, slow down. Can I get you a cup of coffee?  Nanci...?
Nanci.
Kaido computers. Software guys are nuts, into the kinky stuff. End of the day, they're driving Fred's cars.
Fred knew you got to spend money to make money.
Since I got the pet place to buy a mini-van from me. My cousin works there. You got kids? I could put you in a wagon way below sticker.
What do you care? You going to arrest me for blurring the lines?
Watch your step. You guys are completely overreacting. It's just a hobby.
See? Fuzzies. They're food.
You want anything?
Coming right up.
Nanci. Do you know what a syllogism is, Mr. Gibson?
A syllogism. Aristotelian logic. Two premises equal one conclusion.
I busted my ass out on this floor to get a desk up there, and for what? So Fred can make me his bitch?
Fred killed himself. Guy was like a goldfish. He would have eaten himself to death before he tossed me a client. And one good client breeds seven more. Without the one, I keep slipping. 
There's two directions in this business-- up and out. It's a numbers game. I'm 35 years old. I got six guys ready to move me out. Opportunity knocks, you open the door.
Who doesn't?

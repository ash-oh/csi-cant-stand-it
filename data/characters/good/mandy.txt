Still working on it, Warrick. I don't work one case a day.
You look terrible.
That doesn't sound like you.
That's virtually untraceable.
Hit man was a ghost.
Make that one thing.
It gets worse. Got a print off your quarter. Ran it through AFIS. Came back your dead man.
Pretty gruesome. 
Was your guy a gambler?
Well, if their names are Curt Ritten and Janine Haywood the answer's, 'no, it's not their prints.'
Maybe you have the wrong suspects.
Look, I'm not your beast of burden. Sara, this is your thing.
I'll give you something dandy. Your doggie-door prints. Good-bye, I have to go on a break now.
Come on. Do it. Just cut her throat, and you can walk out of here.
Should I be talking to you?
Well, no, actually all I got so far are your prints.
Wait, I got something.
Sara, I've got something really good on that defenestrated college kid.
No, no, no, you're really going to love this. A print on a lube tube matched a print on her windowsill. AFIS got a hit.
Ever think you'd see that guy again?

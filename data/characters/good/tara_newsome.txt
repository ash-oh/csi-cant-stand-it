Chris, can we please put this to another vote?
I'd kill for a candy bar right now.
Can we go home?
I'm getting married in five days.
I just wanted to go home, have my fittings. I spent my bridal shower with eleven strangers. My sister filled in for me. I'll never get to experience that.
We were on a break, and the lunch order came.
Don't worry, I'll pass it out.
I got the peanut butter out of the vending machine a couple days ago. I wanted to stuff it down the guy's throat, but I didn't.
But at the last minute, I couldn't do that.
Here's yours. 
Oh! Oh, I'm so sorry.
Then I cleaned up and I walked out.
No, I didn't know it was going to be lethal. When Bob was flicking peanut shells at him, it's not like he choked up. I swear, I didn't know it was going to kill him. I just thought that it would get him replaced with one of the alternates who would vote guilty.
Oh, I killed him.

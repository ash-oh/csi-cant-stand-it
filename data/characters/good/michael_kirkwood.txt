Who is it?
Hey.
Yeah, yeah,  My daughter, she had some friends over tonight without my permission, and, um, they started drinking. 
They got out of control. They broke some stuff. A couple of windows, but, uh, you know, we got it under control, we're cleaning it all up. So I apologize for the trouble.
Thanks.
Look, I thought we were done.
What did she tell you?
You can't. It's my house.
Suzanna, ... 
What do you want? I already told the police I have nothing more to say.
I don't care about another victim. 
Suzanna, please.
I can't help you. I'm shutting the door now.
Mr. Grissom, do you have a wife, children?
Then you can't possibly understand how I feel. All I am to you is a folder in a drawer.
Then you wouldn't be here. I can't help you.
I never got a good look at them.
She's 16. I only had two jobs left -- teach her to think for herself, keep her safe. I got one right.
You know, people say ... 
... you never forget. Truth is... you do forget. And then you remember. It makes it worse. It was like, uh, it's like my brain ... doesn't know where to put it.
You know, it must've run through a million times in my mind ... somebody breaks in. I get a baseball bat. Get everybody out the back door. Call the cops. My family's safe. And I just stood there ...
And when Suzanna was a little girl, Linda made me put those, um, the child-proof locks on all the kitchen cabinets. I complained. You know what she said to me? She said, uh, 'The least we can do is make her safe in her own house.'
Baby.
Oh, it's okay, it's okay. Shh.

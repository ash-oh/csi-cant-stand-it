Who doesn't once in a while?
Daniel Perez. And you are ... ?
I guess that's why you're pawing through my sister's private stuff.
Yeah, a boy from school. She liked him.
She's a giver - from the day she was born.
I'm sorry. 
You want to know my sister, you should check her diary under the mattress.
I didn't realize until ... today ... how lucky I am. I know pretty much ... how and when I'm gonna die. Most people don't. It's what they're afraid of.
Never. 
I'm 11 years older than her, and she took care of me. She was my best friend, and I miss her. 
As much pain as ... I caused her ... and she wouldn't give up, and she ... she wouldn't let me, either. That's why ... during the last relapse, I made my parents swear that it was the very last time.
They told me they ... swore not to fight the cancer, so this didn't count. I wasn't gonna lose this fight.
Here you go. Makes it better.
I couldn't watch her suffer anymore.
Suicide isn't an option. It's an unforgivable sin in the eyes of God.
But my death will. See, I've got about six more months. I'll be dead before there's even a trial.
I-I do want to thank you, though.
For speaking for Alicia. You're probably the first person in her life to think only of her. You know, you may not believe in God, sir, but you do his work.

The signature is definitely hers, and you're right, she wrote the note under duress.
Thin-layer chromatography tells us the red dye is consistent with a standard coda pen. But find the pen. I should be able to match it to the note.
I can match its flow.
What do you notice about the ink?
The pen socket that holds the ball in place was askew.
The cockeyed socket caused ink disruption as it flowed down to the paper.
The damaged socket is quite common in sheet-writing instruments. Lucky for us, the uneven distribution of the ink will be unique to the pen that wrote the note.

You use saliva. It's absorbed into the fabric of the paper and softens its fibers.

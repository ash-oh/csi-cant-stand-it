After all this time, she's in Vegas? That's a hundred miles from our home.
But you know she's alive.
It's been so long. Tell us the truth. What are our chances?
What do you mean?
Mr. Grissom, we want to see our daughter-- now.
Mara Felton was our baby-sitter. The police questioned Mara when Melissa disappeared.
We need a lawyer.
Not for us; for our daughter.
Melissa, I don't know what you've been told but you're our daughter. You were taken from us. We've spent the last 21 years looking for you.
Raising even ten percent won't be easy.
When are we due in court?
Then I'd better hurry with bail.
We have no idea where she is.
We know exactly what we're doing.

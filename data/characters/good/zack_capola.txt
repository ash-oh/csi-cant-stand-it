Yeah, I saw Susan banging on his door, so I used my pocketknife to jam it open.
Yeah. All the time. Whenever Trip would get drunk and lock himself out, he would bang on my door.
Me and Trip?
No. I'm not really the type of guy that Trip Wilmont would hang out with.
Yeah. But we had Spanish 102 together. Sometimes he'd roll over to my dorm, and I'd help him with his homework.
For a jock, it could have been a lot worse but, no, we weren't friends.
This is bunk. I was told my grievances were confidential. They said my name wasn't even on the form.
Ask him. You look like you were a jock in college.
Whatever. Look, if it had gotten around that I had ratted out Trip, the whole basketball team would have come down on me.
A handful of used condoms would have pissed you off, too. Look, what are you getting at?
Because I didn't see a need to badmouth the dead. But you want the truth, he was an ass, okay?
Hey.
Why?
I guess.
Uh, I don't know.
I didn't even know there was one.
I swear, I don't know how that hole got there. And if you think that I had anything to do with Trip's death, you're wrong. I was in L.A. for four days. I had just gotten back, and I saw Susan banging on his door.
Hey, are you all right?
Trip? 
Hey, man, we're coming in.
The whole dorm can verify it. I was visiting my boyfriend. It was his birthday. We went to the auto show.
No, I've got the only key, but like I said, it's easy enough to break in.
I'm not sure. I had just gotten back from my trip, and I saw something on the floor, so I picked it up. It kind of burned me or something.
I'm in college. A lot of things seem weird to me.
I tossed it.
It was there. I don't know what to tell you, man.
Okay. I'm late for ancient history. Can I go?
Thanks.

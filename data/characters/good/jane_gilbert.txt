I'm severely deaf, and I can communicate fine. I'd appreciate it if you'd look at me when you speak to me. I wear a hearing aid and I can read lips. You could have asked if I needed an interpreter.
There are 152 students at my school. We live together, we study together, we eat together. We're a family. And Brian is dead.
The crime didn't happen here -- it happened out there.
Neither am I, but there are more of you, right? Send someone else - someone with more understanding of this school of my students.
How can you solve a crime without understanding the victim?
Well, I'm kicking you out, too.
Your people can't solve this crime.
When a deaf person meets a hearing person the hearing person so much as says, 'I'm normal, you're not.'
If I agree to cooperate you will include me in your investigation?
I did nothing wrong.
Paul lost his hearing less than a year ago-- a tumor. He hasn't adjusted. He's angry.
There were no other available beds.
He doesn't read lips or sign.
May we go now? 
If you want to find the killer look outside the school.
You found the car that ran over Brian?
You kept your word.
I want to see him. 
Is that the coward who killed Brian?
What happened? He scare you? Talk a little funny? Make a lot of noises? Screamed? Or maybe he just looked at you the wrong way?
You make me sick.
You said you'd include me.
You found the killer.
Who will lie for him.
And now you do.
And that's why they killed Brian. Because he was different. You don't see us as different.
Who taught you to sign?
Tell me about her. And use your hands. You're a little rusty.
True.

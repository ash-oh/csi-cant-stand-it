Hello.
You're late. Not-not that I mind. 
There's two of you? 
What's in the kit?
Wait a minute. Uh, what's going on here?
Oh, my god. You guys are cops.  I'm, um ... I'm really embarrassed. I've never done anything like this before. I swear.
Do we have to do names?
Rebecca McCormick.  Am I under arrest?
Uh, they're Godiva.
Yes.
I met Trey on Lady Heather's web site. Our encounters were only on-line. 
Like this? Is this okay?
Croix was fun. Uh, I wanted more experience. Variation. I made a date with Trey. He never showed up.
Well, 'similar' doesn't mean me.
So ... since I pay for s*x, I must also be a murderer?
I don't like you.
Croix wasn't even half that good. Of course, that's still better than my husband.
Years ago.
All right. Mm-hmm. We've had our fun, but I'm stopping it now. Any other question you have can be directed to my lawyer.

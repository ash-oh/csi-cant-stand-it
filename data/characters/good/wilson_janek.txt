Hey, hey, hey, no flash drawing. 
Challenge. Challenge over here.
Time's up. Game over, baby.  Gabbons? 
Like I'm really not going to challenge that.
Yeah. Want to try your luck? Step up, baby.
And you are?
Nice to meet you, Gil Grissom.
Mr. 735? Heard he's dead.
Gil ... you think that trash talk's going to break my focus? 
You must be new.
You're a quick study. But if you think I killed Adam, why don't you go ask Uncle Sam for my DNA? I served my country. Gulf war senior. Memorized word lists for a sanity check. Some guys did ping pong; I did this. I saw enough killing over there. I'm a 'make words, not war' kind of guy now.

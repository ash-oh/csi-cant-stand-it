Ma'am ... put your hands behind your back, please.
Hey, O'Riley, Grissom wants to see you.
Come on.
That's a beautiful car, that SC-430. Don't get to see a nice car like that in these parts too often. So when I see one twice in two days, I notice. Especially when the driver's exceeding the speed limit.
Gun! OFFICER: Get down! Get down!
Put him down. OFFICER: Cuff him. OFFICER: Get him secured.

Sir. You, um, asked us to check on a stolen minivan?
You know, from the rec center? We located it.

Hey, people. Your lunch is getting cold.
Ma'am, you may want to take one of these.
Upstairs.
Yes.
You might want to wear those.
Couple of mountain bikers called in the body. Coroner just arrived.
Gentlemen, put your hands on your heads, please.
First thing we did when we saw this was call you guys. Didn't touch a thing.
So you going to open it?
This is going to take all day.
Well, boy was out playing, found the weapon, fired one shot, dropped the weapon. No one's touched it since.
Las Vegas police, sir.
We received a phone call from a neighbor about a break in.
No trouble at all, sir. You have a good night now.
Ready to kick your ass, Stokes.
You heard me.

That's it, boy. Here you go. Here you go.
They've lost the scent. Might be as far as it goes.

She said hands against the wall.
Las Vegas Police! You're under arrest!
Move! Move!

On the ground, now! 
Freeze!
Here you are, sir.
In the tunnel headed your way.

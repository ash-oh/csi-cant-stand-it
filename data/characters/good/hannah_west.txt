Marlon didn't kill Stacy. I did. And I was wearing this when I did it.
But you have to be really smart to make people think things happened that never did.
I didn't kill Stacy. Marlon did.
I assume you have a DNA warrant, Sara. Because if you don't, you certainly don't have his consent. Isn't that right, Marlon?
Graduate school. Excuse me. 
Are you sure you'd know if I had? You're welcome to stay. You might learn something. 
Please turn to page 187, the Clausius-Clapeyron equation. Oh, by the way, Professor Costin said it'll be on the exam.
He didn't kill Kira. He cared about her.
I suppose I'm an optimist. College has been a difficult adjustment for Marlon, especially after we lost our parents.
You're not really, though. When will Marlon be able to leave?
At least that's honest. It also seems a little vindictive. 
What's wrong, Sara? You're different than you used to be. You're angry. And a little sad, too. Why?
Marlon, Marlon, it's okay.
I think it was a gum wrapper. It's wrong to litter.
That's a highly unlikely series of events. You don't expect me to confess to something I didn't do?
I think I know why you're so angry, Sara. I did some research. I read about what that serial killer did to you out in the desert, under that car ...
It must've been so terrible being trapped like that all alone. Did your life flash in front of your eyes?
You must've been so sad knowing that you were gonna lose everyone who mattered to you. 
Look, I know how it feels. One moment my parents were alive, and the next they were gone.
My life changed in that moment. All that I have left is Marlon. Why would I do anything to hurt him?
You're the one who's playing games.
Marlon ... don't be sad. She doesn't deserve you.

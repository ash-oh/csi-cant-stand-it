My son's dead. Why are you fingerprinting me?
I already told you that. Twice. 
You know, I ... I got questions, too, you know. Why Ty?  Why not me?
How could my wife and I sleep ...  ... through it all?
Is this really necessary?
What now?
What about Matt?
Yvonne?  Hey.
I know. He'll be home soon. It's just procedure.  Right?
Can we at least speak to him?
Come on, let-let's go. Come on.
We called the detective, but no one will tell us anything.
But he's just a kid. I mean, he just lost his brother.
Ty saw him writing something on the window.
Yeah. I chased him away. Matt ... cleaned off the window.
I jog through that park every evening. Um, he's got this, uh ... makeshift tent thing set up by the playground.
Yeah ... it looks like my sweater. 
No, but I haven't seen it in a while, though. Why?
Do I need a lawyer?
I want to know why.
Why? Damn it.  Ty looked up to you. He ... he loved you.
That you wet the bed?

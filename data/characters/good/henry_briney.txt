You can't keep me out of there! This is where I live, man!
Look, I just want to see my Auntie Penny. Where is she?
I don't want to calm down!
Yeah, that's what I was just telling this guy. What's going on?
Henry. Henry Briney.
For what?
Movies.
Who else would I go with?
No. I don't have friends.
I sat in the Keno Lounge all night, hit the grocery store, and then came home to cops.
Because my parents threw me out.
Because they don't like me.
Not anymore, but I did for a while.
No, I didn't take them. She must have taken them. I don't touch them. I just got out of rehab. Haven't touched a pill, line or needle in six months.
My parents threw me out, and she took me in. I would not screw her over.
Excuse me.
Um ... I just found this on my porch -- I opened it and thought I should bring it down to you guys. It's ... pretty creepy.
I don't know. Maybe it was me, although I never would've taken them. Or maybe you should ask the guy next door.
Yeah, I had an idea. I figured it was how she was supporting her habit.
I guess I should've said 'habits.' Um, she loved her liqueur, and she loved her cigarettes, but what she really loved was video poker. She liked the sound the coins made when she hit a jackpot. She offered me a couple of bucks a week to keep the house clean, and ... and she paid me in nickels and quarters.
No. I lived with her for a couple of months, and ... and she never had anyone over but me.

How would you characterize your relationship with Kristy Hopkins?
Go on.
Could you I.D. this guy? 
And you saw him kill her?
And you didn't try to help the girl?
Yeah.
Heads up. The press is going to be all over this one.
Four dead: Mother, father, two teenage boys. The sisters were luckier. 
Teen girl heard a noise, hid in the closet. Alerted the neighbors after all the shouting was done. 
Younger sister's over there. They couldn't have killed their father tag team -- soaking wet.
They've been inside.
You want a barf bag?
It's okay. We'll give you clothes. The lab guys just want to see yours.
They said you were looking for me.
We got to hug the wall? This is the only room with no blood in it. There's nothing to disturb.
It's the only drawer open. The killer knew where they were going.
Best surface for what?
You guys got some toys ...
Okay ... 
News bim's waiting for you. Thinks you have an 'interesting look.'
Hey, Stokes. Your 'W. Cartsen'?
He's a second lieutenant William Cartsen. Served in the war, wounded in action. Got sent stateside after they put him back together. They put a pin in his spine and a plate in his head 31 years ago. Walked out of the hospital, hasn't been heard of since.
Valet guy said you're the Manager. Detective O'Riley, Las Vegas P.D. Stokes and Sidle from the Crime Lab.
This man a patron of your establishment? Name's William Cartsen.
So what'd you do?
We're going to want you to take a little ride with us.
Homicide. 
Hey. I don't even know where to start with this one. Take a look at that. A scuba diver ... up a tree.
He got up there somehow.
Maybe you should find out what we're selling first.
You guys were in business together?
But you just said he didn't have anything.
Hey, I'm just here to make the arrest.

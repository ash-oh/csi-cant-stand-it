They're keeping Matt.
We're not unfit parents. Please, we just want to speak with our son.
What?
Matt's sensitive. He doesn't handle stress well. If we-we-we could just talk to him.  He may need a change of clothes. 
Yeah.
You want to know about that homeless guy?
He's nuts. He-he scared the boys once or twice, but ... 
You're thinking that that guy had something to do with what happened?
Oh, God. I knew we should've called the cops.
Where'd you find it?
Oh, Matthew.

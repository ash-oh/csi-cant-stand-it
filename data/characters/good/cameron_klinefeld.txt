How much do you love your wife? 
Now that's not the cocktail waitress.
We were at The Fez last weekend. 
I got a hooker. She watched. She likes it. It gets her off. What's the problem?
'Love is not love'
'Let me not the marriage of true minds...'
... but bears it out till the edge of doom.' 
For most people.
It's almost over.
'Love is not love'.
For most people.
This is a joke. You can't arrest me.
What, wait a second ...
It's about trust. How much do you love your wife?
If you want to live, you kill her by your own hands, or you both die.
Tell me. Do you love your wife enough to spare her the suffering?
If you want to live, you kill her by your own hand. Or you both die.
Where's your car?

What?
What if I told you I sold it?
Okay. Painting's in the trunk of my car.
What?
My friends helped me out. They didn't know what I was doing with the copies.
And you never even knew the difference, did you, dad? You're right. You don't know me. Where are your pictures of me? You're too busy staring at your masterpieces, and they're not even real! I'm right here, dad. You don't even see me!
Oh... yeah. Do you know Warrick Brown?
Oh, he's probably working. He works really hard. If you see him could you just tell him that, uh, Jason says thanks?
Uh ... 
Better. Hey, thanks for busting me loose. My mom said she'll pay you back.
Oh, I won't
I know.
Yeah, every day after school.
Hey, I got to go. My mom's waiting for me.
Yeah.
Bye, Warrick. Uh ... see you next week.
Yeah.

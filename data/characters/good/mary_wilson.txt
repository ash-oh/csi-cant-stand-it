Warrick Brown. I remember you standing on my steps with those guilty green eyes, afraid to come in because you knew your grandma would size you up no matter what kind of trouble you got into.
Like when you were 13 years old and you took her new Buick out for a spin.
Mm-hmm. I haven't seen you since your grandma passed.
So why you here?
Oh.
That's 'cause they're making their own history.
You know, my daughter Chelsea died last August.
Mm-hmm. Lung cancer. She never smoked a day in her life, but her sorry husband did. He's healthy as an ox.
What, what, what, what?
The ones in the news?
No. No. Oh, oh, please, God ...  No!
Oh ...

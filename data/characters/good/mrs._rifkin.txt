Okay. Come on. MR. RIFKIN: Come on. MRS. RIFKIN: Let's go. Come on. MR. RIFKIN: Don't fail me. MRS. RIFKIN: Come on, baby. I'm feeling this one.
Yeah.
Give me my money.
Oh, my.
Let's cash out.
Come on ... I want to go dancing.
Mm-hmm.
What has gotten into you?
Why don't we, um ... take those up to the room? 
'Cause I'm feeling a little ... uh ...
... Frisky.

Why would you put me in that situation?
It was first names only. Mandy and ... Cameron?
No, not at all. They ... creeped us out.
It wasn't the question. It was ... the way he asked it. 
Sobered me right up. I mean, he didn't just ask it once. He asked it ... over and over again, and then Mandy asked how far we'd go to prove it.
Then she starts undoing his belt.
Yeah, but you liked it a lot.
You could've waited.

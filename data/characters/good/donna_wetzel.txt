Sorry, did I totally flake on an appointment?
Oh, geez. You can try. We've had about sixty.  Yeah, honey?
Mm-hmm. 
Well, Simon has TV privileges until 4:00, so tell him  that now it's your turn.
Nicely please, thank you.
Mm-hmm.
Oh, '82. My God ... Let's see.
Let's take a look.
What did you get? Oh! Good for you.
Congratulations.
Every single one, their first night here. I just feel like it gives them a sense of belonging right away. Most of them come to us so damaged they don't know what it's like to belong to anything.
Here we are.  Oh, Natalie. Yeah, shy as anything until I tried to do her laundry and then she screamed her little head off.
Have you ever even seen a load of kids' laundry? Of course I use bleach. Excuse me a second.
Yeah, a couple of nights into her stay, she climbed up to the top bunk and pushed another little girl out. Of course we talked to her about it, but she did it again the very next night; almost broke her collarbone.
After a few dozen kids, you get real good at knowing the difference between damaged and broken. And Natalie was broken.

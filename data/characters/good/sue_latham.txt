Sheila ...
Excuse me? Your best friend is missing and you're at a police station. Act accordingly. And sit up straight.
Were you drinking last night?
I know this sounds awful, but all I keep thinking is: thank God it wasn't Sheila.
Ah. I lost two dollars in there.
Thank you.
Look, I know you have questions for her, but, you know, Sheila almost lost her best friend yesterday and she's still a little out of it.
See, she's exhausted. Oh, poor baby. Sheila, honey. It's time to wake up. Captain Brass is here.
Sheila?
Sheila?
Sheila, honey!

Somebody took Alicia.
Mom, I don't know ...
I'm not sure.
I really didn't see Alicia all that much. Um, I don't get to. Her life sucks, so sometimes she would just, you know, play hooky and spend the day with me.
Yeah. Um ... I was just went in, and ... you know, to get something while she changed back into her uniform.
It's not that big of a deal. It's like, you know, the skirt over the jeans, and back to school before mom knows anything.
Alicia!
A black guy, uh ... He had a beard and he had a crappy black Buick. But, um ... I don't know, maybe it was blue.
I don't really ...
Okay.
Okay.
I didn't kill Alicia.
I'm invisible.
That's crazy, okay. I told you, I didn't kill my sister.
No.
I use now and then to take the edge off.
Why don't you make up your mind? No signs of rape. If I was selling my sister, there would be, wouldn't there?
What I need is a lawyer, which means this conversation is over.

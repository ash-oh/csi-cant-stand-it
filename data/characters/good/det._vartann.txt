Stokes.
Hey. You've got a minute?
Four years ago, you and Grissom worked a missing persons out in Moapa Valley? She lived on a farm with her husband?
Rita Westonson.
Rita's sister is in interrogation. She's claiming Rita was murdered.
Miss Minden? It's my duty to advise you of your right to counsel.
If that's true, Mr. Mathey is guilty of conspiracy after the fact.
Miss Minden ... how did you come across this information?
You sure?
Hey. You get anything?
I may know why. I ran a background. Faye had two sisters --
I'm Detective Vartan. This is Nick Stokes from the crime lab. Terry Minden?
And we have a warrant.
What are you looking at?
Aaron versus Rita? He's twice her size.
Smells like diesel. Why is it red?
I got your page. Who shot your dog?
Means the fuel on Aaron's farm was not used to cremate Rita's body. Maybe it pumped unleaded four years ago. Converted to diesel at some point since.
Mm-hmm.
Where does that leave us?
Isolate Moapa.
Aaron's farm's located at the cross streets of White Oak and Stansberry.
The burn spot is a half mile east along the river.
Who owns the other one?
And we continue to push forward. We need to take a sample of fuel from your pump.
Relax, relax. 
Let's just go over this again.
Tell me what you remember.
That's it?
Sir, wait here.
Hey. 
Housecleaning found Mr. Johnson passed out on the bed next to the victim. They alerted security and apparently he just came to.
Yeah. He's a golf ball salesman from Ohio.
No I.D. on her.
Quite a party last night.
Well, no calls were made from the room.
You know, if this guy took viagra, you're lucky he hit the floor and not the ceiling.
Sign of a struggle?
Anything you want to add?
You don't remember anything?
Okay.
How do you explain your fingerprint on the murder weapon?
Well, if Johnson was innocent, why'd he lie to us?
Conrad.
Homicide called you guys over an hour ago. 4-19 at the Tangiers. No one's responded. Not even the coroner.
Catherine's on a case, I think. Grissom ...
Oh. And Sofia's still on her task force leave. Both shifts are tapped.
I checked the board. No one's available ...
... except for you.
I know. But you're still qualified to process a scene, right?
Meet you there.
Finally. Yeah, well three hours. All right. Thanks.
Crime scene's getting cold.
I found a rental car agreement in the glove box. James Billmeyer. New Jersey. He's not registered at the hotel. Probably stopped by to lose a few bucks.
No. We're still waiting on him. That shoe print belongs to Mrs. Vivoldi.  She called it in. We been waiting on you to take her statement.
Yes, let's do it.
Thanks.
Ma'am, sorry to keep you waiting. I'm Detective Vartann. This is Conrad Ecklie from the crime lab. Do you mind if we ask you a few questions?
Yes. At the time, were you walking to or from the hotel?
That's good. To or from?
Uh ... ma'am, so you were walking to your car ...
What are we expecting to find here?
So you're a CSI now?
Really? Maybe you should just put together a list of everyone who had access to the morgue.
Yeah, that sounds good.
That tells me the guy was going to be staying in Vegas for two days.
Thank you.
Decedent probably met her on the flight, possibly hours before he died.
I'll run it down.
Well, your name was in his pocket.
Do you have any idea who may've killed him? Or who might want his body in its current condition?
L.V.P.D.
Are you Charlie Jackson?
Do you know a James Billmeyer?
Are you aware that he passed away?
Cut the act, Charlie. We know that Preston had access to the morgue. We believe he stole James Billmeyer's body, maybe brought it here. But what we don't know is why?
It's a class D felony to steal a corpse with the intent to sell or mutilate. I'm not really sure how to classify 'partying with the dead.'
You're still under arrest. Obstruction of justice and conspiracy to commit theft. You're looking at one to four years, Charlie.
Yeah, building manager took a peek. ID'd her as Alice Granger. Apartment 207. Moved here about a month ago.
No purse, no car. I put out a bolo. Possible car jacking.
We got a 20 on her car.
You see anybody get out of the car?
You checked the bar?
Okay, I'll see you inside.
So he shoots her, takes her car, and stops off for a drink. 
Let's find out.
Okay.
Hi. You recognize this girl?
How about last night?
You see anybody hassle her?
Around what time?
Well, that would explain why her car's still here.
Were you jealous, Mr. Granger? I mean, she was a beautiful girl.
You still own a lot of guns. A .22 pistol, Colt .25, among others.
I don't follow.
Then what? You shot her with your .25?
Excuse me, I'm looking for Jeff Simon.
Jeff Simon?
Are you Jeff Simon?
When's the last time you saw Alice Granger?
Come on.
Well, I'm glad you feel that way. You mind if we take a look in your truck?
Where is it?
Look, buddy, she's dead.
Get up.
You are a real prize. Jeff, your prints are all over that box, which means one count felony stalking. That's seven to ten. Murder two adds a quarter. Now, you plead out now, you'll live to see parole. 
So that restraining order she filed against you was because you're a nice guy.
Wait, wait. You ... you followed them?
What time was this?
What did this guy look like?
A homicide. That matchbook was found in a dead woman's pocket.
This will go much easier if you just answer our questions.
I'm a memorable guy. 
Okay, why don't you, uh, walk us through your evening? Start with 'I left the office...'
And then what?
Eyewitness claimed that a man matching your description left the bar with the victim. Drove off in a dark-colored, four-door sedan. What do you drive, Mr. Novak?
And two dead women. We believe the second victim, Holly Pearson, bit her attacker's tongue.
Have a seat.
You comfortable? We're going to be a while.
You're a mind reader.
Our evidence pertains to the second victim, killed last night with the same gun, and we believe that a portion of your client's tongue was in her stomach.
Oh? Really.
And what happened next?
Mr. Novak, have you ever been to Holly Pearson's house?
Then how do you explain your courthouse keycard which we found near her body? CSI matched the prints on the card. Only yours.
Well, that won't be hard to verify, because your car's already at CSI.
Let's run through the night Alice died again.
Your alibi only proves you lost track of her. You knew where Alice lived.
But you identified his vehicle as the car that Alice left the bar in.

Sir, I'm on your side. I just want to clear you.
I understand that. But the evidence is telling us something different. So I'm going to ask you again, just one more time -- before you shot the deceased did a struggle ensue?
Okay, go inside. Dust for prints. Make sure you take plenty of photographs ...
All right.
Cath, you want some coffee?
Summerlin ... rich folks.
Yeah, the DA asked me to testify on chain of custody.
I could do that in my sleep.
Yeah.
See you.
Yeah. I got a call earlier today from Child Services asking about you and Lindsey.
They told me they'd notified you -- some investigation -- that Eddie had made a charge or something.
Well, I ...
Thanks.
What's he know about the forensic analysis of a friction ridge?
Mr. Ziegler, one more thing. What about the security alarm?
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Disaster? What do you mean?
Yeah, but you think I'd say that?
Hey, Catherine. Check this out. 
You see that?
I think the thief must have pressed his head against the wall to check if the painting was wired.
Hey, a jury convicted a first-degree murderer based on a print just like this two years ago in Washington.
Well, we can get a warrant.
I'm just going to press this against your ear. See?
Jason?
The earprint talking.
Sir, are you going to want to press charges?
Hey.
What's up?
At least we solved our case.
Give me an evidence tag for this painting.
I know, every time you say that, I'm looking at more overtime.
You know what? I got to be somewhere.
Yeah, right. Can you handle this from here?
Cool. I'll see you later.
What?
Oh, I told them as far as mothers are concerned, you're the bomb.
Yeah. And I also told them your ex is pretty screwed up.  No worries.
This painting's a forgery? Where does it say that?
It's not our job to authenticate art. Case is closed.
So, the kid stole the original painting from his pop and gave us back a forgery.  No wonder he copped to it so easy.
Nice campus you got there, Jason.
We were by your dorm earlier with the police here.
That's not all, sir.
No, sir. The police recovered your originals from Jason's dorm room today.
What, did you have an art major do your fakes for you, Jason?
Your son stole all your originals replacing them with forgeries.
He didn't have time to make the switch.
If the hook hadn't dislodged from your Sorenson you would have spent the rest of your life admiring fakes.
You know what, I got to be somewhere. Can you handle this from here?
Hey. I missed assignments; I know. I'm running late. What did I pull?
I handed it off to Michovitch, from days. Uh, I told Sara.
Yeah. 
What's that?
What? I don't believe this. Now you're pulling up film on me?
We do.
I was at the casino. But I wasn't gambling.
Damn! Taking the whole window.
And you have a problem with that.
Hey! This has nothing to do with you. So are we going to work together ... or not?
You know what that means?
It means the glass on your pants and the glass from your living room window have equal densities.
The glass didn't come from any car window. That's science.
You're free to go.
We're not cops; we can't hold him.
Showed him all your cards. Sucker play.
Oh, you just don't let up, do you?
Yeah, passed up a chance to play semipro ball. Went to college instead.
That's the glass you 'sawzalled.'
Oh, now I'm worthy?
Maybe you did, maybe you didn't, but we think you murdered him.
The evidence.
When a window is broken from the outside which is what a burglar would do ...
... Haeckel marks form right angles to the inside of the window. 
But when a window is broken from the inside which is what a Peckerwood like you would do
... Haeckel marks form right angles to the outside of the window.
Well, we know he did it.
He needed the money.
We're back to how do we prove it?
And his computer is ... ?
Still at the house. Well, we got probable cause.
Why don't you go get a new warrant?
Well, we got a warrant so that should give us the room for the night.
Computers turn on. When they don't, it's for a reason. Did you plug it in?
Really?
Let me check it out.
Well, he's a sneaky S.O.B. I'll give him that.
All right.
Let me see that flashlight. There's scratches all over it.
And the hotshot takes another strike. Check it out. Not enough to cause even a small scratch on your finger, but more than enough to use as a basis of comparison.
One, two, three.
Left one is from the broken window the other one is from the gun both dropping at an identical rate. Glass is from the same source.
My theory ... the brother was the executor of the parents' estate. He controlled the family money.
I called the county clerk. With the brother out of the way, Kenny is the sole beneficiary.
Slam that jail door.  Makes you reconsider, doesn't it?
Hey, Jas, how you doing?
Gets you more attention than you want.
You still working on those moves I showed you?
How about that? How about that right there? Good.
Hey, come here.
Apologize to your mom, all right? Let her know she can trust you.
All right?
See you next week, jaws.
He needed my help. I didn't win anything, Sara. You're a CSI. You saw me enter a casino. Did you see me place a bet?
I don't have to tell you anything.  We're supposed to be working together. Next time, just try talking to me instead of going around behind my back.
I'll take a piece of that.
Can a CSI take over another CSIi's case?
Hey, what happened to that, uh, meeting the other day?
Yeah, the department heads were voting on an extra vacation day or something?
What do you think? The kid might have started it?
We don't rule anything out.
Well, fires take the path of least resistance. I mean, they feed off of oxygen and combustibles.
Firemen wear rubber gloves.
According to Ecklie's report, which was filed in record time, the point of origin for the fire was the closet. Gris, there's nothing left here.
Well, that confirms Ecklie's findings about the use of an accelerant.
Damon doused the closet floor with gasoline, lit it and got the hell out of dodge.
Who cares? The guy torched his wife and kid.
Runners, huh? I know a little something about that world.
It breaks down like this. There's about a half a dozen runners in town -- they're mostly kids -- and they make about two 'g's' a week. And they all work for the same guy.
I used to be a runner in college. It paid the bills. I had route five. Worked Boulder, Sunset, Vacation, and the bay -- all of that.
The Voice.
I knew it. That's Grissom. I got to bail.
You don't. He's not who you're looking for anyway. If you want to know who capped this kid? Then you should talk to another runner. I mean, they'll kill each other for a good route.
What's going on?
Same conditions in Damon's bedroom, night of the fire.
Flashover. So, that confirms the first part of Damon's story.
'Alligatoring'.
But that piece was a doorframe outside of the bedroom -- which was a contained site.
So what happens now?
You got me.
Sifting through this debris.
You mind?
Give me a hand with this mattress.
Or it was. I figure it must have burned up in the bedroom and the firemen threw it out here with the rest of this overhaul.
Or overload a house. 
Breaker box. 
Circuit overload. Master bedroom.
Yeah.
Yeah. Under the right conditions, any hydrocarbon can be an accelerant.
You ever worry about professional suicide?
Where do we start?
Uh, I know -- looky-loos.
Grissom was right: You do know a lot about bombs.
Dominic, I think you should go with your attorney. Thanks for your help, though.
Gris, can I get clear on something here?
Catherine gave me this 'FP' which was part of the Hansen bomb and I'm supposed to figure out what tool the bomber used to engrave it.
Yeah, but he could've used any number of things to initial it. I mean, screwdriver, a drill bit, a box cutter.
What are you guys doing?
Oh, I definitely got the wrong end of this investigation.
Yeah. I finally matched this 'FP.' To this electric etcher. Now, I made an exemplar. Boom! Identical type of striations. The manufacturer says that this etcher is only used for training purposes. And it's only sold in bulk. It was not sold to Norman Stirling.
Las Vegas School District. I called the district, and we traced it down to one high school -- summit high. 
Stirling's son goes there.
All you guys got to go on is a bone?
Maid found dead male body in a hotel room.
Guy's 23. No. Sounds like a live one. 
Let's go.
Looks like somebody had a par-tay.
'Darren Pyne.' Dead at 23.
Looks like he was whacked over the head with this lamp.
Unless each hit was to a different part on his dome. Who's the room registered to?
Hey, O'Riley, you think ... 
Lynn Henry?
I'm Warrick Brown, and this is Sara Sidle.
We're with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
Darren Pyne was found dead in your motel room at the Lucky Seven. Did you know him?
He didn't leave when you did?
All right. We'll probably have more questions after the coroner completes his autopsy. If we need to talk to you can we reach you here?
Multiple blows to the head?
No. Just lap dances-- nothing more.
Looks like fried eggs.
What's the estimated time of death?
What?! These ladies said he was alive when they left him at 3:00 A.M.
We have forensic proof that Darren Pyne had s*x with a woman just before he died.
Hey, tell us or tell the D.A. 
So he raped you.
Was Darren alive when you left?
It's just standard procedure for sexual assault.
What do you mean, 'it doesn't add up?'
For now, yeah.
Yeah, but maybe the materials didn't adhere. Doesn't mean he wasn't hit in the head with the lamp. 
What are you looking for?
Well, if you don't know, I can't help you.
What is this?
Something-something.
Right there.
Oh, you think so, huh? 
No. Diamonds cut glass. This is some cheap-ass cubic zirconia.
Let's go ask her.
They talk faster at the sports book.
In the old days.
Yeah. Not my wedding.
What?
She lied to us.
All right, let's call homicide and tell them to meet us there. Let's put this to bed before the honeymoon.
So you only hit him once?
Does your fianc√© have a zirconia ring?
May we see it?
You were in that motel room that night, weren't you, Luke?
What happened? You got wind of the party?
Bruised up Lynn's wrists.
You did what any guy in your position would do.
But you didn't stop with one hit.
And you didn't know that you had lost a piece of your ring.
Laws don't end when you come to Vegas.
Guess I'm going deep.
Polo.
Yeah, please.
Looks like a cuff link. Initials 'C.M.'
I'm going to be wet all night.
Hi.
This is a big case. I'm in a groove here.
Whatever happened to 'you cross the tape, you go the distance'?
Great.
Detective Conroy.
No. I do my best work solo.  On the clock, that is. What you got?
All around the ten-ring, once between the eyes. Entry wound give you anything? Small caliber?
Professional hit.
Times have changed since the canary days, huh?
Yeah. Brass used to tell me, back in the day when the mob would make a hit they'd leave a canary, 'cause the guy sang.
'Call someone who cares.'
When you leave a gun, you know it's clean. The gun just traces back to itself.
All I can do -- follow protocol.
It's like the circle bar on a friday night ... three million people on top of each other.
Cool. You got an I.D. for me?
Too bad he wasn't driving that elevator. 
Ooh! Chicago bankroll.
No, that's just a term. Old school. 
'Shrimp cocktail appetizer. Surf &amp; turf dinner. Two glasses of wine. All comped.
It ain't free, believe me.
Yeah. Yeah. 
Been a long time since I seen these.
Cool.
Yeah. Will you log these for me?
Mandy, you got any prints off of that quarter I found on the vic?
It's a good idea that, when your house is robbed you report that your registered gun was stolen.
We're going to keep your name on ice for a while. Thanks for your time.
Nobody kills anybody with their registered gun anymore.
I been spinning my wheels. I'm never going to solve this case. It was over before it began.
I got a dead man in a glass elevator with a bazillion prints and a .22 caliber bullet.
And he left the gun at the scene. You know what that means.
But I got two things left, right?
You got to be kidding me.
Want to share?
I was just thinking what old man Binion told Steve Wynn when he hit town: 'Always give a gambler an excuse to gamble and he'll thank you for it.'
A bunch of cash receipts in his pocket. Markers all over town. Once you get to that place there's no getting out.
These belong to Tyson Green. Just came to let you know he won't be paying up.
Yeah.
I won't let you down again.
Where's McCall now? He's being held?
Great.
Hey, are you just going to ignore my question?
All right, here's what we know from the arresting officer: 
Two 25-year-old guys Chuckie Hastings and Roy McCall, lifelong neighbors one step up from a trailer park got into a beef over a motorcycle in the owner's backyard.
All right, now, Hastings' wife said that McCall shot Hastings in the back. 
And the coroner's report substantiates that.
Well, we would need the screwdriver with McCall's blood on it to prove that, now, wouldn't we?
I have been through all these boxes twice. It's not there.
The gun is here, but there's no screwdriver. They even have crime scene photos of it. But no tests were run on it before it was misplaced.
Right.
Yeah, the same people homicide'll blame.
Ma'am, we're not cops. We're crime scene investigators. We've come to ask you a few questions about the day that your husband was killed. Maybe acquaint ourselves with the actual crime scene.
Out back here?
What's up?
Heard the first shot and then came running out here.
McCall had a semiautomatic. I mean, you could pull off a shot in two-tenths of a second.
So she just filled in what she thought happened -- that McCall shot her husband in cold blood.
Typical eyewitness.
Well, if we had the screwdriver that someone lost 
We'd be able to check for blood.
Mr. McCall, according to your statement you went over to your neighbor Hastings' house to return his motorcycle. You got into a dispute over a wrecked fender and he attacked you with a screwdriver.
So you're saying that if he'd inflicted the wound on himself he would have stabbed his left arm.
Mr. McCall, which direction was Hastings facing when you shot him?
Defense attorneys have made a whole career off that human error.
Doc, are you sure McCall shot Hastings in the back?
This guy McCall swears that he shot him straight ahead in self-defense.
Right. 
All right, look, I'm not doubting your findings. But when guys go at it they're not like gingerbread men, you know? They're, like, bobbing and weaving. It's like W.W.F. Smackdown. You know? All of these things could have changed what went down when Hastings and McCall tangled.
No doubt. When Catherine gets here can you tell her I went over to evidence to check out the victim's t-shirt?
Yeah, but look at that gunpowder. Unburned gunpowder.
Right.
In direct contradiction to our evidence.
Yeah, right.
Hey ... when's the last time you took target practice?
Okay, so we're doing this reconstruction and the best way is to measure the distance between the victim and the assailant during the time of the altercation, right?
Right.
Circumference of the gunpowder is the same. 
Looks like two feet for shot number one ...
...and one foot for shot number two.
It can't. It's not possible.
We just disproved their statement.
The truth is somewhere in the middle. How long do we have till the prelim?
What kind of 'thing'?
This dummy cost over $500?
Why?
He's 'self-healing'?
Cool. Um, the wound track is off. Do it two centimeters higher.
Good.
Now, the second shot was fired like so. Now, the coroner says that Hastings was shot just like this, from back to front and Hastings' wife says the same thing -- that her husband was running away.
Just like I said before, guys don't go at it and fight like gingerbread men, you know?
Check it out.
What if, um ... he was lunged ...
...just kind of like this?
Oh, you are wrong!
Yeah. I'm calling the DA.
Hey, Lindsey, I got some games on my computer. You want to see?
Let's play one. 
All right. I'm McCall. I have a gun.
I push him back off.
I shoot.
And the bullet enters through the back even though we are facing each other and exits ... out the front.
Boom.
Chalk it up to adrenaline or revenge, but Hastings was already going down. There was no reason to shoot him a second time.
That's our job.
Hey, how's Linds?
Right.
Catherine, you've got to get that divorce finalized, huh?
Oh, come on, now. Don't tell me you believe in that bs.
Come on, Sara. 
Spontaneous human combustion is science fiction.
There's no such thing as a human torch.
Sara, this is a crime scene. Stay with me here, okay? Don't lose it.
What's that?
Wow. Check that out.
It's as if the fire created a chimney for itself.
Yeah, right.
Good question.
Another good question.
So do you still think it's spontaneous combustion?
Yeah.
Okay, tell me everything you can about this foot.
How do you know about Sara's theory?
No. You're just siding with Sara 'cause you got a crush on her.
So your official 'observation' is spontaneous combustion?
No, no. We're a team. The only place we're going is back down to that crime scene.
What about the husband -- is he still a suspect?
What about, uh ... life insurance policies?
I'm not the one who's reaching here. 
That would be cool, but you've been jumping to conclusions from minute one.
Well, I brought the ion detector. This will pick up even the smallest traces of hydrocarbon fumes.
I don't care what the lab says. This puppy will reveal exactly what accelerant was used to start the fire.
Nothing.
What's that?
Really? It was actually for my girlfriend here - 
Miss Piggy.
Yeah.
Well, I tried for human volunteers, but no takers.
What are we going to do? We're disproving the existence of spontaneous human combustion.
Well, we're recreating the death of Nadine Winston, right? She was wearing a cotton nightgown -- thank you -- and she had a half a pack of smokes on her end table, which means she was probably smoking a cigarette.
Best part: Toxicology sample came back. Nadine had a high concentration of seconal in her blood.
Enough to knock out a horse.
All right.
We wait.
Yeah, we're disproving spontaneous human combustion. We dressed the pig up in a cotton dress and torched it with a cigarette.
The pig's been reduced to ash. The fat acted like candle wax; burned hot, slow and intense. 
Nothing spontaneous about it.
Of course.
The what?
Well, you can show your appreciation by, uh, cleaning up.
Two victims. She's on the sidewalk, a foot from the curb and he's in the middle of the street.
No car.
Well, rain screwed up all our chances of a good DNA profile.
You see him?
Well, that's why you got the badge and I got the syringe. 
I'm casting the stab wounds. From the molds, we can identify the murder weapons.
Did you want me to give Gris a message?
Forget Shepherd's wife. I can't match the slash marks. It's all about these stab wounds. So I concentrated on Kevin Shepherd.
Cool.
Well, I measured all the sharp points of entry on Kevin's body.
They're all identical. They're all made from the same murder weapon.
Identified murder weapon number one. Now we just need that second murder weapon.
Yeah, who stabs someone with a blunt instrument?
Yeah.
So he started with Kevin and then he went after Jessica and then the tip broke off.
Oh, yeah. I got three prints on this gearshift and they are beauties.
The images are printing.
So Jessica Hall was the last person to drive the shepherds' suv.
Lucky for us the rain missed that.
Who else had a flowing wound?
Man, why are you always trying to put me down?
All right, I'm bleeding from my abdomen.
Why would she do that?
By the positioning of her wound, I'd say it looked like her stabbing was an accident.
No. 
He just said check his clothes. Drying room. Six years in the job and it still freaks me out in here.
Yeah.
Here we go. Here we go. Justin Green. The eyewitness.
Here's another thing the rain ruined -- the blood pattern on Justin's jacket.
That looks like a handprint.
Right hand. Justin's?
So, it's not Justin's.
Holding down Kevin's feet.
So, whose handprint is that?
Yeah, but Kevin grabbed Justin's shirt so that means he was still breathing.
Whew. Curveball.
From?
Yes, that's affirmative. I can trump that. Wednesday, 3:00 P.M. Justin called Amy Shepherd.
People walk every day because of you.
Yeah.
No. I'm having a block party. I marked it where I found it -- over on the sidewalk over there.
So, Brian takes a walk crosses the street, doesn't hear the car, gets creamed.
You know what that means -- smackdown -- the kid was in a fight.
Was he having any difficulties?
Dr. Gilbert, we're just following protocol. We need to speak with Brian's friends; his roommates. 
But we're here now, and evidence is time-sensitive.
Hey.
Yeah, we didn't have a warrant, so she kicked us out.
She was kind of hostile.
The roommate's here.
Do you know what Grissom drinks when he goes out at night?
Exactly. Who knows anything about that guy? Hey, check that out. 
Brain printing. They call it a visual polygraph.
Yeah, back in '97 Grissom and I used one to interview this rapist. The guy was mute but his brain waves spoke loud and clear.
... then the oscillator will give him away.
Those the tire treads from the crime scene?
Any hits?
Yeah.
Checking out the dead guy's clothes.
Whoa. What are these?
They look like lice.
Wasn't our dead guy clean?
Well, he was in a fight, right? Maybe his attacker had lice and they crawled off on his sweater and they got comfy and the stray hair blew away.
You know anything about lice?
Little problem no one talks about, huh?
Yeah. Right behind you.
Why? What did you do? Let me guess. You ran a DNA profile on the blood from the dead guy's knuckles and you got a match.
You made it out of bed and you dressed yourself?
So what does that give us?
So the guy's a glow-stick. How does that help us track him down?
A suspect?
Hmm.
Creepy critters in the driver's seat.
You just don't like other women in his life.
Affirmative on the head lice.
Adam Walkey doesn't have lice?
Same as the blood we found on Brian's knuckle.
It's just like Dr. Gilbert said ... the killer came from out here.
That's the muffler. And this is the back of the car.
There's no way this car was moving forward when it ran over Brian Clemonds' body.
All right, Guy?
Look at those wounds.
Yeah. From what I hear they carved out a piece of this valley when they made the park. 
Some mountain lion probably didn't like getting relocated. Mountain lions are brutal.
So, Doc, how big of a cat are we actually dealing with here?
Yeah, but I bet Grissom did.
This sucks! 
But it's evidence, right?
Yeah, it's somebody's 'doody'.
How do you figure that?
Seminar?
Julie. Oh ... a CSI should not be that fine.
What is that?
Yeah, well, I'm taking it into evidence.
Yeah, well ... we'll see.
Only thirty more jars to go. 
This is rough, man. We should be pulling better cases by now. Millionaire murders, casino heists.
Uh, we're supposed to like scat patrol?
Yeah. 
Just coming to see you. You remember that ice we found at the crime scene?
It didn't melt. It evaporated.
The jogger was missing some organs.
It just so happens the dog's owner is a doctor.
Yeah.
Gris, can I show you something?
Surgery equipment. 'Emory Medical Supplies, Boston, Mass., 1875.' 
Antiques.
Exactly. What I find interesting is that she keeps them near the door, not in the office. In case she needs to break out and go do some work.
She gives me the willies.
Yeah, well, maybe we can link these to the crime. Her dog may have eaten that jogger but he can't harvest the organs.
Yeah. You want to hand me those filter papers right there?
So we got the right dog. Well, let's see if the owner cut the vic up. 
Reactive agents. One part leuko-malachite. 
One part hydrogen peroxide -- used by blondes everywhere. 
Blue.
What's that?
... turns the swab blue.
If the jogger's blood is in any of this stuff, we need to find it now.
I'm ready, Nick. You want to hit the lights?
Why would she do that?
I'd place a bet on it.
Mr. Moore.
I think James called me tonight because he thought I could help him.
James is all right but, uh, there was a big brawl at the detention center. James was at the wrong place at the wrong time.
If he talks, he'll be dead inside a month. Now, if he keeps quiet, the D.A. will put the squeeze on him. He'll probably end up in the big house you could lose your boy forever then.
He probably knew what your advice would be. To do the honorable thing.
Not without a price. Look, a crime occurred. CSI's got full jurisdiction. I got myself assigned to the case. I'll see if I can take James out of the middle.
Why don't you tell me?
That's a lot of education in a short time, huh?
James, why don't you take a deep breath and tell me what happened here.
Whose 'side' I'm on? Who reached out to you, man?
James, I'm trying to help you.
So it's your life versus time.
Nothing surprises me anymore.
Step back for Warrick.
Whew!
Whew!
Impressive.
Yeah. Son of a bitch was crafty -- I'll give him that. Melted the end of the toothbrush to insert the razor blade.
Concealment.
Yeah. Now all I got to do is put this shank in someone's hand.
Where's his attorney?
Where's your lawyer?
How's your plaque?
Your teeth. I mean, how many toothbrushes does a guy need? 
Apparently, for you it's as many as it takes to make the perfect shank.
Yeah.
The evidence will testify for you. Ronnie Connors ... bought a toothbrush and some rubber bands at the commissary. He didn't know it but that's the last shank he'll ever make.
Before he made the shank he shaved with the same razor. His DNA was all over the blade.
It's not me you have to thank.
I thought you said we were grabbing a beer.
Grissom, you know, this is your thing. 
Cleanses me? 
Whatever happened to my evaluation?
Oh, yes!
Peeping toms to murderers?
Nobody move. 
Mr. Clean needs a maid. I'm going to take this back to the lab.
What's up?
And you got a match microscopically but it doesn't mean a damn thing
Whoa, whoa, whoa. A girl defending herself against a guy is going to pull that hair out by the roots. 
I mean, you get scalp skin filled with DNA.
... shed?
Mine.
Shedding. He's trying to throw us off. What he doesn't realize, we got no DNA on the hairs so we can't chase down his other suspect.
Is there's no one you can appeal to?
Come on, this guy's on the loose and there's nothing you can do?
I got Audrey Hayes, but those fibers we found in the Snow lady's throat aren't going to give us anything. White cotton fibers are like oxygen -- they're everywhere ...
'If you can't prove uniqueness, prove abundance.'
Yeah.
Well, I went back Audrey Hayes' apartment and I paid particular attention to the point of entry. I found a small persistence of white cotton fibers.
Well, I remember what you said about signature guys and how they have low self-esteem. They're always going to the gym to work out so I'm thinking gym towels.
So ... I went back to see if any of them had tried out introductory offers.
But you do have to sign in. 
All three women went to Strong's Gym once in the last three months. So, I'm going back there, grab some towels bring them back to the lab see if I can get a match from the crime scene fibers.
Will do.
Aw, that's cool. We don't need props. At the end of the day, we know what time it is. 
Right behind you.
Yeah. Picture that.
I know.
Too many. One thing I can't stand is a punk coward.
You want me to take this case alone?
Oh, I'm fine. I'm ... I'm looking after you. 
It's made me think of who I am to my partners, you know?
You keep on busting on me, you won't see any kind of leaf.
Vehicle's humming down Rochester. The vic was on her scooter, heading eastbound. Car brakes here ...
... impact here. The vic was thrown -- what-- twenty meters?
Yeah.
Looks like a 'four' and a 'J.'
Not like he left us any evidence.
I'll get them to cross-check this partial within a five-mile radius see how many hits they come up with. You'll have those pictures for me?
All right.
We believe it may have been involved in a traffic collision earlier this evening.
You're going to be charged with manslaughter, Mr. Moore. Felony hit-and-run. Do you have a lawyer?
Catherine, I just got off the phone with the traffic guys. They've impounded Moore's car. Should be here any minute.
Old guy was scared.
Our car's here.
How tall you do you think Mr. Moore is?
Old people must love hugging that steering wheel 'cause this seat is pushed all the way forward.
Oh!
Oh ... well, I'm six feet and this mirror isn't helping me at all.
Why?
Whoo!
This?
It's good stuff.
Yeah.
Does anybody else drive your car, Mr. Moore?
So, James you like Mos Def?
James you want to add anything to that?
Will you please escort Mr. Moore back to his cell?
Like I know my middle name. Well, let's go back to the car and find the proof.
What?
And what-- forget about little Renda Harris?
Hey, you don't think I'm feeling this? But we got to follow the evidence even if we don't like where it takes us.  It's the job.
Hey, we start making deals with the devil and you don't get to walk away. You understand what I'm saying?
What you got?
My Aunt Bertha could tell, and she's legally blind.
A forensic investigation, sir.
James ... you have a chipped tooth? Must be an incisor, or we would have noticed.
Hey... why don't you run on home? I'll handle this.
Your daughter gets out of school in a half hour, right?  Why do you want to pick a fight with me now?
Don't think I won't collect.
Hold on. James ... the first couple days are going to be the toughest. Here. 
Here's my cell number. You run into any problems you call me. I'll be right there. All right? Keep your head up.
'My day.'  Reminds me of my grandmother. Yeah, I gave her a lot of rough nights, too. She used to call me her 'work in progress.'
Maybe.
I got a court date ... straight off of graveyard. It sucks.
Well, evidence vault opens in five. 
Hey, Judge. What's going on? I'm due in your court.
Well, nobody told me.
Judge, I thought we were even. How much longer am I under your thumb?
Damn. I knew you were in tight.
Just like that? 
We got a slam dunk on a three-time rapist and he's just going to walk?
I'm already on probation.
Yeah, I feel you back there, believe me.
I need to see the Henderson Rape case 4217.
Thanks, Mike.
Uh, damn case was continued. Clerk never called.
Nature of the beast.
Party?
More money, more problems.
Thanks.
I appreciate it.
Hey, Grissom.  You got a second? Uh, I'm in purgatory. Need some guidance.
Judge ... Warrick. Listen, uh, I got a little problem. No, I can't talk about it over the phone. We got to meet in person. There's something in the evidence I think you should see. Good.
Let me guess. Radiohead or Rage against the machine.
Right.
Oh, he's working that Wendy Barger case -- you know, the floater?
Only clue he's got is a missing boat which sucks, 'cause ... it's missing.
It's a simulation tank. He's re-creating the conditions the night she died. Body was dumped, like, a half mile from Calville Bay. They think the boat must have drifted with the currents.
Well, you know Grissom. Shortest distance between two points is science. And for Catherine, it's pounding the pavement.
Yeah. Something came up. See you.
I need some assurances.
I checked out the evidence, yeah. But I'm not sure about the rest.
Why don't you let me do that?
I told you ... nobody owns me.
Hey. 
Hey, Cath.
Yeah. Fine. Thanks for letting Brass handle it.
Yeah. That's what I'm afraid of.
Yeah, I know.
It's a long way out in the sticks just to drop dead.
He was looking over his shoulder when he was running. Think there was somebody else here?
Can I get this taped off here?
So you want to call it? How do you think he died?
Cool.
Can't make a ruling? Look at the bruise marks on John Doe here. I call that suffocation.
I'm going to take a mouth swab.
What the maggots?
Entomology is our friend.
Sorry, little buddy. 
Scalpel.
Talk about pulp fiction. 
It's all yours, doc. 
Fire up that gas chromatograph mass spectrometer thing, will you?
Cool.
No, I'm off that. 
I haven't made a bet in a month. I can't say I don't have that itch, though.
Hey, boss, I got something for you. 
I did the whole tox-the-maggots thing like you said. Found jimsonweed in their blood.
Jimsonweed in Eric's blood.
Really? Cite your sources.
I thought Brass just said that they weren't doing any drugs.
Yeah.
Fruit juice, half ice.
Or legal, for that matter.
Did you take the drug, too?
Did you get a stamp when you got in?
Well, mostly they use water-resistant pads so you don't sweat it off. Could you hit the lights, Gris?
Where did they stamp you? 
Yeah, that's DJ Masterband's stamp. He is the spinner in Vegas right now. Must have been playing at the rave these two were at.
The free papers, yeah. They have ads for all sorts of raves.
Gris, I got the prelims back on that swab I took off of our desert guy. Products trapped in nasal hairs.
Products found in mouth and nose: Mentholated nose spray, patchouli and aluminum.
Patchouli -- they burn it at music stores.
Yeah. I got trace putting together a list of products made with the stuff. Something tells me that's not lemonade.
Doesn't look like tea, either.
What's that?
Does that apply to our case?
Cheers.
Who?
It's ecstasy. It makes everyone fall in love. 
Don't take it personally, miss. He's kind of married to his job.
Come on. Let's go.
Now we just tie that to the dealer.
That's not what you were saying out at that rave all up in that guy's face.
The chemical compositions break down exactly the same.
Square one.
Thought I'd find you here.
Evidence ... a double-edged sword. 
How do you feel about this?
You don't really believe that, do you?
Dead.
I'll catch you later.
Hey, guys. This came back for the test on aluminum products from our kid in the desert.  Fireworks.
But you guys have never taken j-weed before so you weren't aware of the side effects of photophobia.
Photophobia. It's just a big word for lights freaking you out. You guys were hallucinating and whatever Eric was seeing was scaring him, big-time.
The coroner states that Eric's dose shot his temperature through the roof. He was boiling in his own skin. So he stripped which is why we found him naked.
We found traces of aluminum trapped in Eric's nostrils that are consistent with what we found in your client's hands and arms earlier today from his job at the fireworks plant.
Where you going?
I'll take a piece of that.
Will do. 
Picture that.
Officer Tyner.
Want to tell us what happened here tonight?
Why don't you tell us what happened here.
Officer, we're going to need your weapon, as well.
It's just standard procedure.
Were there any witnesses?
We're going to need to seal off this lot.
The officer told me a fleeing suspect committed suicide. I'm just verifying his account. You know how this works, Brass. Can we clear the jeep so I can do my job?
Can we get back to work?
Why would a guy speed it all the way down the strip just to pull over and cap himself?
Officer's weapon: Smith and Wesson 5906.
One bullet missing. Nothing standard about that.
I don't give a damn what Brass likes.
Yeah, it's war.
Can anyone confirm your story?
Do you? 
We're just having a talk with Officer Tyner here.
Five civilian complaints -- three for excessive force. Two I.A. investigations.
I'm sure you were.
I guess it's a good thing I sealed off that crime scene.
Bullets just don't disappear.
Have you talked to the police?
We're Crime Scene Investigators. We need to know what you saw.
And, just like that, the officer fired?
What thing?
Oh, good. Um ... we just put some stuff through the lab.
I was just about to.
If you want me to suave anyone, I got to know the shot.
She's trying to tell you Eddie likes it rough.
That's how you think I work?
What's he doing here?
Oh, you mean dealing with punk-ass cops who hide behind their union reps?
You're just a psycho! You don't deserve a badge!
It's not in the body. It's not at the crime scene. I like our odds.
Yeah. We've searched every piece of metal. 
Spare tire.
The tire sucked up the bullet and the treads covered its tracks.
There's a match.
We got Tyner. One bad cop going down.
So, check it out ... the laser is the path of the bullet. If you were Officer Tyner and you approached the suspect from the driver's side of the vehicle ... 
The laws of physics trump the eye witness. There's only one way this could've gone down.
Officer Tyner was telling the truth.
We work. We get paid. You don't owe me anything.
Media have it right? Four dead?
You got it.
I checked the sprinkler system. It goes off every night at zero-two hundred .
So somebody came out of the house and got on what looks to be a step down from a motorcycle and drove it across the lawn.
How's that hand?
I saw you beating up the door a little while ago. You all right?
Damn!
You need to tell somebody when you're cutting the lights.
Grissom, you remember those tire treads ... I found on the front lawn?
Well, I ran them through the FBI register and they belong to a '93
I DMV'd it. A kid four blocks away from the scene owns the same make.
I might have just blown open the case and all you give me is a 'that's very good'?
Yeah.
Lady Macbeth?
The tire treads from the scooter place you at the scene of the murders.
Tina's parents? So you know Tina Collins?
You mean sexually?
Where's your scooter now?
We got about four just on the tire prints alone. Homicide's grabbing them up.
Let me take a look.
I see.
Well, if you believe what you hear in the halls - Ecklie.
I'm with you there.
What do we know about the dead guy?
All this damage by one guy? Had to be on drugs.
Yeah.
Nice snow job.
What guy?
Well, alcohol does different things to different people ... at different altitudes.
And where was your husband?
Right. Where were you?
This is incredible. Ten people and no one's talking. My theory: The killer is in the group and the rest of them are afraid.
It all comes down to shoeprints.
Mr. Cash.
So, what did you see?
Sitting ringside, how do you not see what happened?
That's Lou.
Max.
That's Nate.
We need you to tell us everything you heard from the time the deceased banged on the cockpit door to the time he died.
Mile high club.
The stewardess.
Yeah, whatever. You're henpecked anyway.
Now, Lou, in 4B, said he was the peacemaker.
A CD swipe across the chops.
Yeah, go ahead, honey. Save my life.
Saved Nick's butt, as usual.
And, according to Preston, Max and Lou they got to Candlewell first.
He's messing with my man, so I get my licks in.
But they didn't let him.
Let it go, guys.
It's out of our hands. Our field ruling was overturned by the good old Sheriff and the Feds.
Oh, you think this is about justice?
I'm not discounting it. I mean, think about it -- is there anyplace more vulnerable than being at thirty thousand feet in a tin can?
Because their lives were threatened.
Human nature again. I mean, adrenaline doesn't come with an off switch.
If it was between him or me, I could. Nick?
See? We have four people here, all with different opinions. Think of how the passengers must have felt.
Well, if that's your stance how could it have been prevented?
A heroin addict's confetti. Nothing like going on a binge.
Black tar heroin. This is the difference between a Cadillac and a Pinto.
It's my job.  I count at least six balloons, and that's just in the bedroom. The dealer must have come down the chimney. It's like Christmas in July here.
Not that Braun even needed any more drugs.
I can get a print off the air.
Have you seen Brass?
Oh. 'Print off air.' Orange balloon. Cyanoacrylate. Dead bang, drug dealer.
You're Braun's grocery store.
Xanax?
Okay, three rolls of tape found in the truck owned by Curt Ritten.
No match!
'Cause he was smart. In the past 20 years the value of silver's gone to nothing and a commodity broker's going to charge you a storage fee per troy ounce and there's only one thing worse than losing seven to eight percent on silver a year and that's losing nine to ten percent because of some stupid storage fee.
Depends on who's doing the clipping.
Oh, we got a positive association. Roll to tape. Curt to Tony.
How can this be, Mandy? We found the duct tape in the guy's truck.
This thing must have a virus.
Well, that's easy for you to say. All you do is scan prints all day and hit 'enter.'
See what I mean?
Bet Walt wasn't too happy about that. It's 50-50 going 75-25 the wrong way.
'A' slash? Acting supervisor? What about Nick? He's got seniority. Or Sara -- she'd jump at the chance.
And if I ask why?
Hang on! Have you told NICK and SARA about this?
Hey.
Yeah, I'm sorry, I got detained. I guess you did a 'one-to-one' on these treads already?
Put together an evidence list?
You've got to do it.
Ah, I don't think so. I got to go back with the body. Sara, can you get back to the lab and put a rush on this analysis?
He's not exactly dead.
Anything you want to say?
Side roads. So ... this is our con artist?
Did it tell you anything?
Well. Probably when he was getting into the car.
He knew the driver.
You got any pictures of that?
Whoa.
Can you fish that out for me?
Wait a minute. 
There's something in his stomach.
How many more are there?
He's a mule. Why is a guy trafficking in big-pay drugs wasting his time on some nickel-and-dime chip scam?
It's great if you're a mule transporting drugs into the states.
We found balloons of cocaine in his stomach cavity.
Then he went out and got shot.
What?
No, what's strange is going into the evidence locker after post and not finding anything left.
If it was your job, you couldn't feel bad.
It's my case. Tonight, I'm the primary. I have to process it. If you have a problem with that, you can clock out now. Am I clear?
It couldn't be.
Hey.
You have a daughter?
Her prints came up on airline stubs relating to tonight's homicide.
Ellie Rebecca Brass. DOB 9/24/82. Essex County, New Jersey. Last known address 554 Applegate Way.
Well, I've got to bring her in. You know that.
You're hands off.
Just go right in here.
Excuse me?
Yeah.
It's a dummy chip. No casino logo.
So, you two fly down to Baja, pose as a married couple brought back home a stomach load of blow and then you run chip scams? Who's taking your drug profits?
Yeah, she was passing pellets of cocaine.
With your permission, we need to take some x-rays.
And what is his name?
His name.
You were behind the glass. This evidence against your daughter doesn't look good.
She mules drugs for a guy who ends up dead ten hours later? A BS chip scam, a lousy alibi?
Brass. It's a big city. Boyfriend could disappear. But, hey, it's your kid.
So you gave up your drugs to your boss, huh?
Do you realize every time you ingest one of those pellets that you risk dying from an overdose?
So you can just not eat?
I don't think I can handle this. I got to call Grissom.
But?
I heard it, bro -- a 'but' in there.
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
Sack up.
Treasury department?
Counterfeit?
What money?
On a federal case?
Hold up. I'm dealing with something.
Well, I'm not Grissom!
Sara, brief Special Agent Beckman on the funny money. Nick, the garage.
Proves one thing. This was the getaway car used in the murder.
We printed the vehicle your client was found driving. It puts the car at the scene of Vincent Avery's murder less than twelve hours ago.
Bought tickets for Victor Avery as well.
Vega?
We got bad news from the garage.
The tire evidence puts Ellie's car at the murder scene. We'll be pressing charges, murder of Vincent Avery.
Maybe so, but we don't have Driscoll.
Vega had to turn him loose after your gun episode.
That's what you cops think.
Grissom's office. CSI ... Warrick speaking.
Officer-involved shooting? Who?
Excuse me?
Ecklie, you're day shift. And you're here because ... 
Yeah, picture that.
What the hell happened?
There's one round missing.
Fifteen bullets left in brass's gun. There should be sixteen.
Hey. Look where I just located this blood? Back of the grip.
Slide bite. Man, Brass didn't shoot this guy.
I need you to show me your hands.
Your hands, Captain.
I'm going to need to take your badge.
Detective Vega.
They're nothing alike.
What, is she adopted?
What about the blood on Brass's gun?
Not Ellie's? 
With a pinch on his hand. All right. Where's that manifest?
Vincent Avery ...
Two-zero-three-four ... two-zero-three-four...
Marty Gillmore.
Game's over, Marty.
You know this guy?
You conned the captain. I got to shake your hand.
No, on the real.
You shot Driscoll ... ...with his firearm.
So you off'ed Driscoll to take over his drug op. What about Ellie?
You eat something?
Oh, god, he's going to OD. Can we get a medic?
Can we get a medic?
Brass?!
Brass. Hang on. 
I only took it to get Ellie's DNA off of it. That's it. 
We were checking out the blood from your gun. We compared your DNA to her DNA.
You never said anything about her being adopted.
Hey, Sara.
Hey ... I'm a little short on cash. Can you loan me a hundred?
Hey, Griss. How'd it go?
Well, the job is fine. It's the other stuff -- the personalities. 
Is that Einstein?
Charlie Brown. Figures. Is that why you put me in charge?
Yeah, you said 'A Ghost'. 
From the top?
I don't know where to start. It was wild.
Hey, Cath... are you on this Fairmont case?
You know the Fairmont house was one of my first calls three years ago?
Shots fired. He shot himself while he was cleaning his gun.
Yeah. And after hearing about tonight I'm wondering if that's what really happened. I'm going to pull his file and check it out.
I will.
In this reinactment, Fairmont shot himself while cleaning his gun? In this reenactment the story just doesn't add up. I think I fell for it because I was new and I wasn't too eager to talk to another guy about him almost shooting off his manhood. 
This is the room as it was then based off of my crime scene photos. This is crime scene reconstruction, new school. Works backward, reverse time. 
The bullet hit here.
The only logical place for that bullet to have been shot from is four meters away, one meter high. He didn't actually shoot himself. Someone shot him.
I'm presenting this case to the D.A., even if it is three years old.
I already did. 28 years old, blonde, blue eyes, 125 pounds, five-six ... sound familiar? 
Uniform's talking to a neighbor. Donna is Joan's older sister.
Genetics. House belonged to their mother. Donna's lived here alone since their mother died. Joan lived in Henderson. The real action's around back.
If the highway was the dump site, this is the primary.
No doubt. I'm going to collect the glass. And then I'll start with the doorframe.
You're the puzzle guy.
So the side that kissed up to the tin will fluoresce under UV.
I got some imprints on these blood spots here. 
Looks like the killer may have stepped in Donna's blood.
Hmm. That would place Joan at the house.
Hey.
Still putting it together. I'm just doing a trace on Donna Marks' clothing and I came across this fiber. Look at this cross section.
Yeah, short and coarse. Car upholstery?
Well, it's from black upholstery. What color was the boyfriend's missing thunderbird?
Really? What about the blood from Joan Marks' shoe?
Hey. Point of impact. It's, uh ...  ... sixty-... five inches from the base.
Well, Donna was five-six. If she was thrown through that glass, the point of impact would've been lower closer to the ground.
Are you saying it was an accident?
Thanks.
Hey. Is it true? Millander?
Yeah, what's up with that?
Well, I got some mud prints. Check these out.
He must've taken off his boots before he stepped in. 
Check out the depth of the impression compared to mine.
Shoot it.
Who flagged it?
Yeah, but how would Millander know that the guy who'd pick him up had a birthday August 17, 1957?
I found some G.S.R.
That's why Grissom didn't find a bullet.
It went out the window.
I'm going to call Nick, tell him we found out what that unidentified whir sound was -- the window going down.
We were thinking Millander posed as a hitchhiker overpowered Walker, and then faked a gunshot in the car.
No, he carried him into the warehouse.
Drives the same route all the time?
Maybe he wanted to confess. Take her to the body.
So what do we do now?
So, who's worth one mil?
State troopers just spotted Logan's car on the 582. Drove past him earlier this morning. Five minutes later, drove past him again other direction.
Looks like some kind of glow paint stick. I think Catherine dragged her heels a little bit here.
You mean like helium for balloons? You can also use it to change the pitch in your voice.
Then why hasn't Catherine contacted us yet?
She ate, but she didn't fall asleep till way late. We had her helping Greggo out in the lab.
Yeah.
Watch your step.
All right.
Looks more like a slice. Could've happened when he cut through her finger.
Does this look like blood to you?
Yeah.
With what?
Great.
Hey, Nick?
Have you been eating peanut butter in the layout room?
Well, we found it on the back of that shower curtain.
I need to take my car to this detailer. Not bad.
Two problems. His wife is going to leave him, take half his money and he was going to jail.
He knew he'd get hauled in to the cops.
So, he left these wine glasses for you to find.
A million dollars. Pretty tempting.
He didn't. He probably thought the bank marked it.
I hear Grissom goes there all the time. Like even on his nights off.
Oh, that's so not cool. That's a community fridge.
Way to go, Nick. You really told him.
Yeah.
That's it.
You think? Neighbor called it in. She smelled the smoke. Thought he was barbecuing in his living room.
Over there talking to Brass.
What up, doc? Oh, there you are.
Oh, it's all good. I'm just starting my walk-through.
There's a burn pattern for you. Fire burns upward. This is moving downward.
Check out the upstairs?
How do you know it's a guy? Why are you jumping the gun?
Yeah, that sounds like Sara.
It's the point of origin.
I don't smell any accelerant.
I don't know. It doesn't make any sense. A fire burning downward?
Furniture polish.
Oh, man. Something bad happened here.
Yeah?
A thousand points of light and I only need one to clear up this picture. The blur equals the length of the light. 
If I can compress this light back into a point then the rest of the picture gets clear. That's how they got Hinkley's image when he was shooting the prez.
Yeah, I think so.
Maybe his good hand was otherwise engaged. I'm going to work on that for a while and see if I can get some ridge detail. Maybe even a fat print.
There you are. I got something for you from trace.
Sara?
They isolated the accelerant used in the fire. It's alcohol based. 
Guess that's the six percent no one talks about. Female fire starters.
Greg, this is an abuse case involving a minor.
I'm still trying to enhance it. It's kind of frustrating, that, uh this picture puts us at the very moment of the crime but we can't see what she's seeing.
Yeah, my grandma used to say that all the time.
Well, maybe ... if I enhanced the reflection in her eye with the right combination of algorithms ...
Hey.
Back burner. I've been working on this reflection in her eye. You see what I'm seeing?
Come on, man. I've been working on this enhancement all night. Look closer.
Yeah. These pictures were taken on a boat.
Miss Bradley.
Warrick Brown. Your fianc√©, Mike, did he own a boat?
No? Did he borrow one or rent one?
Your ex-husband owned a boat?
Okay. Thank you.
Catherine.
Found it on the boat. DNA just ran it. She's under 14, right?
Whoo! There's a winner.
Yeah, after somebody wiped them down. Paramedics?
Just pronounced? 
He tied himself off.
All the signs of an O.D ... without any of the paraphernalia.
Coltrane, huh?
See if I can get this back to Gregor at the lab. He could tell us what we're dealing with. Two coasters, one glass?
Forgot this on the way out.
Whoa, whoa ... miss, you can't come in here.
I'm sorry, he's dead.
Miss ... why don't we step outside for a minute?
Potential killer?
Don't tell us you're wearing our evidence.
Mannitol-- that's that baby laxative used to cut heroin with.
91%? No wonder the guy O.D.'D. That's a death sentence.
Unless you're looking to kill someone.
Yeah, that victim was out of L.A. and I don't think the singer, Lillie met him before last night, so she may be in the clear.
: Right ... like you're going to take dumpster duty alone.
Man, I don't even know if I'm going there the odds haven't gone my way in a long time.
Same difference.
We're just doing our jobs here.
We won't know till we print you.
Well, that's fine. That's not the issue. You tampered with the evidence.
Could have lost your job.
So, you cleaned him up, threw away his works ... why Lillie's scarf?
Lillie's scarf was there?
Really? You mind rolling up your sleeves for us?
Thanks.
I don't like playing in front of an audience.
No, I just came by to ask you a few questions and I got a little carried away.
So, um, how well do you know these people you play with?
I thought I was the one asking questions here.
Warrick Brown.
So, that's what you're all about?
Then run.
Sounds like you're pretty dependent on him.
Great.
I don't know about all that.
I already do make a difference.
You do.
So ... knock 'em dead.
You're here.
New lead. The bartender. Purple.
Test for opiates.
Purple. You know what that means.
He sandwiched the drugs between the coasters. That's how he hid it. He was dealing from behind the bar.
When we found those two coasters in Stan Grevey's dressing room, we assumed that there was two people -- either a user or supplier. There weren't. Just our guy -- the victim.
What's wrong? 
What do you mean?
Yeah?
So what? There could be a hundred reasons why she ...
We got the dealer -- the bartender. Let's just take him out.
: What about her? Why don't you ... Why don't you just let me handle my business.
We know he's not the only guy you dealt it to.
Bad batch?
No.
I'm going to meet Lillie. I'll see you back at the lab. Okay? You don't know me.
You hiding from me?
Yeah.  I wanted to talk to you.
Yeah, you're right.
I'm sorry, Lillie. Life's too short. Good-bye.
What are you doing here?
Relax. They said it'd be here.
Well, that's why we have computer tracking. Fourteen ... it was fifteen, right?
Stephanie Watson, right?
Yeah? We all have a past, huh?
What exactly are we looking for?
Well, I'd start with this.
Hey.
Here's the good news. Look at his hands. The cut on his left index finger -- it's just like the evidence log says.
Kelso's glove is not in any of the crime scene photos, any of the sketches, anywhere.
You see who logged it in?
Want me to tag along?
Kelso's glove -- embedded in the fabric-- dog hair. I isolated motor oil on the thumb and the rest of the stains were bloodstains. Kelso's, just like in the report.
You'd think, but you kind of put me on a wild snipe hunt so I tested for all biologicals, and I ran amylase and I found saliva.
Yeah.
Also amylase.
Results on Jimmy Tadero's sample. I just got it back from DNA.
Not going to take a look at it?
You want me to open it?
We're not running the show.
All right.
Cadets?
Let's roll.
There's no doubt that this bus body-checked this k-rail.
You've got that 'Sara' look.
I got a theory. Grissom said the suspension gave on the bus, right? Broken rod arm.
Well, I'm thinking when that rod arm hit the pavement it made this great first impression here.
Crosses the highway slams into the k-rail.
Bus bounces off this k-rail ... 
... heads back towards us.
Yeah. Someone upstairs was looking out big-time.
Check this out.
Well, this one's sheared.
Three-quarter inch bolt. It matches the bolt on the specs for this suspension system. The hex head says it's a grade eight.
No, the bolts snapped midway through the skid after the bus hit the k-rail.
And the Camaro's skid marks place it behind the bus.
Until last night.
We have more questions about the accident but one thing we know: the suspension didn't hold.
We only care about the bolts.
The consequences of saving a buck.
Oh, that's original. What happened to slashing tires?
Right.
You know we need to document this for the journal of forensic science, right?
Yeah, this is the rear trailing tire of the crash bus. It has the same maintenance record as the tire that blew.
Gravity, huh?
Yeah. You used your left hand to prop yourself up. The perp may have done the same.
Warrick. Okay.  I'll be there.
Sara. She's at the print lab.  She needs me.
Checkmate.
So, why are you paging me?
Oh ... so he can drive a vehicle with over ten passengers.
Mm-hmm?
Well, I guess I'll grab a uniform and pay Mr. Maddox another visit.
Well, we're still going to need those maintenance records.
Thank you.
Sean Nolan was fired two months ago. Maddox says he's working in Barstow and since then three of Maddox's buses had blowouts. They all went through Barstow.
Yeah, only last night's bus had been serviced since Maddox changed suppliers.
Yeah, you do. See you.
Who wrote this?
'Nick Stokes, Crime Stopper.'
You went Hollywood on me, man.
Greg.
I do love a blond.
Hey, I wasn't done reading that.
How's that platinum blond coming?
Come on, Greg I'm not getting anything out of trace. I was hoping you could help me out here.
Not hair? Not human? What are you reading?
Bet I know someone who's hotter and I'm not talking about looks.
Yeah.
Watch your back.
Grissom, you got a second? I got a mystery.
Yeah.
Well, it's not a hair. It's a synthetic fiber. Glass-- what do you think, fiberglass?
This could be a lot of things.
What did your prom date say when you called her?
You think she's a suspect?
Stranger things have happened.
No.
No. You're tripping.
Change your password.
Warrick.
Fiberglass insulation -- comes in pink and yellow. But you already knew that. Is that why you're calling?
Yeah.
Hello. Hello? I-I can't hear you. H-hold on.
I can hardly hear you. We're at the, uh, satellite guy's house that installed Jane's cable.
Nick!
Patrol. Request immediate backup. Immediate backup. Officer down. I need emergency medical assistance! Eight-two-six ...
Nick! Nick.
But 's going to be all right?
Damn it. Grissom, this guy was right there. I could have had him.
Doesn't feel like the right thing.
I'm going with you.
Catherine thinks he might have got away with them. But, uh, Grissom did find some wacky video collection.
Yeah, relax, Ironside.
Gotten any clues as to where this guy might be?
He may know him well enough to read his e-mail.
Lunar Cable- a hundred and fifty channels.
I'll take the downstairs.
Brown.
Does she know about her father?
Well, I'd like to get started processing. Can you show me who you found?
Well, whoever this guy is, he's a lousy shot.
No, just evidence.
I got a pill. 
Looks like sedative.
Diazapam. Benzos..
Seems like a great place to ice someone.
Brown. 
I don't see this burgundy car. Where are you looking?
How did you find the disturbance? Drive up and down the canals all day?
Hey.
$500 for five dollars worth of honey? I don't think it's worth it.
I got a blood trail here. Leading to the garage.
He dragged the body to here ... 
... put her in that car.
This strike here. That one's all business.
Red. Is that our suspect?
Hey.
Good. I'm running it through AFIS right now. The good thing is that the jailhouse is a union gig and all the union guys are already in the database. What I did for the print was I lined up a ridge detail from the partial that I found on each handle.
So ... you think that guy fried before he fell?
Bobby Dawson's taking odds. Two to one, Grissom's wrong. Five to one, he gets suspended for shutting down that jailhouse. And ten to one ... 
Hey, Griss. How long you been standing there?
Robert Harris. Does that name mean anything?
Well, we heard the sheriff put the brakes on the investigation.
What? Do you want us to pay to see them?
Yeah, that's rough. And the significance of this evidence?
Trace amounts are odorless, tasteless.
So, where does this get us?
You want his blood?
Hey.
Cool.
Whatever happened with those metal cutters?
Roger Valenti's blood. Grissom wants it packaged in plastic. I don't know. Don't ask.
Later.
Hey, Gris. Valenti's blood. Packaged, ready to go.
You want to fill me in here? I mean, this wasn't covered in any science class I took.
That's far out.
That would explain that smell.
Just like Valenti's body. No evidence of electrocution.
And sodium is conductive, just like iron.
Roger Valenti's body offered up no resistance because of the excess iron in his blood.
Making his body one big wire -- path to ground.
So, you've just proved murder.
Twin moons of Venus.
Striations match.
Seems like a lot of work to kill a guy.
Hey, Griss. I think I can speak for both of us when I say I'm sorry that we let you down.
Bet you were like that in high school.
Oh, you were the girl I ran away from.
Construction on Flamingo. I'm sorry. 
Yeah.
A .38? 
Kind of weird being in a high school. 
What were you? A jock or a brain?
Reconstruction guys can give us a more precise angle measurement, but I'm thinking ... five-four ... maybe three. We got ourselves a shorty.
Cyranose 320. Company sent it to me, gratis for a week. They figure if it helps, CSI will buy one.
Yeah, well ... what if the shooter chews a certain kind of tobacco or has a unique halitosis and the e-nose picks up on it?
I thought it was our job to speak for the victim no matter what it took ... and to hell with the budgets.
Air pump. Cost about ten bucks.
Absorption agent?
It's been downsized.
Well, it's the same difference, really. 
Air is drawn into the last tube the chalk absorbs the chemicals from the air. And mass spec will break it down at the lab.
'Cause it was cool.
All right.
I saw her in action.
Yeah, she was.
I was just telling Nick how you were a big bully in high school.
No.
What Nick's trying to say he was unpopular.
What was wrong with those Members Only jackets? They were kind of cool back in the day.
Hey, Sara. What were you in high school?
Oh, I was short, I had big feet, thick glasses.
Yeah. I got pushed around by all the guys and never got any play from the girls ...
No, they used to tease me about my eyes. Called me names.
I didn't have a best feature in high school. Looking back on it now I can say I could see both sides of it thinking about this guy Barry Schickel, and how he was shot and whichever kid did it. I'm not saying it was right, but I kind understand, you know?
What's the matter, you don't trust me?
I got a boatload of chemical components here. Marijuana, bubble gum, cigars. It's like every guy's bathroom in America.
This... does not belong in a guy's bathroom. Can we prove this? I mean there's got to be a thousand different brands of this stuff out there.
Oh. Now you want my tricked-out toy.
That's all from one perfume?
We can narrow it down to one brand?
Well, aromas have fingerprints. They're like a unique combination of vapor molecules that linger in the air, long after the source has gone.
Paperwork. Later.
All right. Show time.
Check out these 'voids.' That's the real evidence.
Guys ... 
Looks like it could be an electric saw.
You check nosebleed's tools yet?
That's because he probably ditched them after using them on the victim. Now we've just got to figure out which one.
Twenty-four hours, then we've got to get them back. Clean.
Same short 'v' pattern, too.
This is on the real. You actually saw him do this?
Female blood.
We already know this beetle feeds only off of human blood, so why are we extracting its stomach contents?
Well, I hope he got his grub before you grabbed him up.
Let's go knock down some walls.
One wall down ... 15 to go.
Uh ... yeah.
I got a hollow section.
Damn. Are we in the wrong apartment again?
Miss?
We're from the Crime Lab. You found the deceased?
Makes us doubt the circumstances surrounding the victim's death.
'Shelley Danvers' -- appointment 8:00.
Well, you lied to us before.
Well, if she did, the coroner would find water in her lungs but it'd be worse hearing it from him than from you.
Oh, it's on.
Uh, yeah. Tina ... Tina Kolas. Best friends from Terre Haute, Indiana. Flew here in a package. Why?
Cath. Whose shirt is this?
When?
We're going to take this shirt, if you don't mind.
We're going to take this as well.
Well, that's okay. We do magic.
Sometimes a simple flashlight will do the trick.
She died of a heat stroke. The coroner just called in with the results of his final post. Your sauna's kept in the optimal condition for heat stroke -- 182 degrees. 
That could kill a person if you left them longer than two straight hours.
Football-- wide-screen.
She died of heat stroke.
We missed it until Captain Brass brought your room service records to our attention.
As her best friend, you would know that.
You killed her over a guy you two met at a bar?
Her pressure got so low her blood quit running through her organs. They shut down.
Cash business, huh?
He's either stupid or suicidal.
All right, I'll take the lot.
You run this car already?
Right here?
We're dealing with some criminal genius here. 
You forgot the 'leave the evidence on the ground.'
So, our victim breaks out of the store with a bag full of dough ...
Guess somebody was casing the joint, huh?
Ms. Delgado, how long have you been here?
You have insurance?
Thank you.
Well, I might bet my own paycheck on that one.
Check it out. What's the first thing you do when you see one of these on your windshield?
Exactly. But the only guy to chuck his was the victim. I found one on the ground next to his car.
I know, I know, it sucks. You couldn't get anything off of it, huh?
Wow.
So, that confirms what Sara's eyewitness said. What else you got?
Thanks.
Can you tell us anything about the tool that may have been used?
Like the insulation in my attic.
Hey.
Hey. 
Small world, huh?
Hey, that's ironic, Hector. We're investigating your brother-in-law's shooting and look where we end up.
We also have a tire print.
We're looking for a Honda, Hector.
You know it don't look good when you run, man. You want to tell us who that Honda belongs to?
I guess that makes everything okay.
You got that right.
These guys packed enough .45 caliber ammo for a small army.
Less than a year ago security couldn't even carry guns.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ski masks are played out. Red and blue teamed up together and took out the guards and their rolling cage.
Black shot down that chandelier.
No amount of makeup in the world could cover up that chunk of adam's apple. 
No honor among thieves.
No stubble ... no adam's apple.
Well, the manager's not in?
I got a key.
Yeah.
Anything that links Brower to his co-conspirators.
I'm thinking trace elements in the clothes could tell us where he was before the heist. I'm going to take it all back to the lab.
I found similar dust on Adam Brower's dirty clothes. Check it out.
What's the composition?
Yeah, um... what do you know about silica?
Shouldn't smell at all, if this place is abandoned.
Shot with a .45. Execution style.
I just got off the phone with the Laughlin CSI assigned to last month's cottage casino case. He told me the casino's cameras captured four assailants, not three.
Actually, it didn't. We did.
Tower casino surveillance. The screen on your left the camera's trained over where Tammy, Darin and Adam entered. The screen on your right is trained on the gaming tables. Okay, check it out.
What, you missed him? All right. I'll play it again ... slower, just for you.  Now, keep your eye trained on the pit boss and the chandelier.
Yeah. Pit boss' name is Max Duncan. Started working there about three weeks ago. Before that ... 
Empty? Maybe she was just broke.
Yeah.
Did someone move her?
You sure with all your life-saving efforts you didn't move her?
Well, someone moved her. She bled out her 
Is it recent?
Sara.
I think our suicide just became suspicious circs.
Different sole, different size. Thank you. Sorry for the inconvenience. This is just a standard procedure. 
Do you have any idea where your daughter's boyfriend works?
Uh, which one?
Yeah. Well, maybe the glass came from another windshield in this lot.
Business suit.
Underwear.
That looks like adhesive.
Like what else?
Well, she died yesterday. We think it may have been a suicide.
Yeah.
We used to call a guy like that a bean counter. Degenerates paying 25 cents a pop in the hopes of cracking a pattern.
It's his results. But that joker doesn't realize that the patterns can end up in the hundreds of millions.
This isn't gambling. This is the end of the line.
How long have you been here, sir?
How did you get the blood on your shirt?
You're coming with the shirt. We'll need your shoes, too.
Brody, we have your shoeprint in Linda's blood. We also have a sample of Linda's blood that we found on your t-shirt. Is there anything you'd like to tell us?
But you left her there, dead.
Oh, I get it. You and Linda are kind of on the same page, huh?
Yeah, you're right. It's not.
It's almost like bipolar boy is too high to even realize what went down.
Thank you.
No lithium, just like her parents said. She did have a huge dose of valium, ingested less than an hour before her time of death.
Yeah.
200 milligrams. That's more than five times the normal dosage.
That was quick.
Yeah. Thanks, Sully.
Mrs. Damen, our detective found this prescription in your name for valium.
Can you tell us anything about that?
And you last got a prescription ... this past monday. What does that mean?
May we have your permission to look through the current contents of your prescription?
No.
We're simply trying to determine ...
We can get a warrant to test your DNA sample against our sample.
Or someone else.
Reminds of what my grandmother said a long time ago. I would never believe her.
Crazy people make even sane people act crazy.
I hear David's resurrecting the dead now.
I just came from the hospital. That guy's in ICU with respiratory paralysis. I did get a prelim on his blood work -- looks like some sort of an organic poison.
That guy's a charmer.
I'm Warrick Brown, this is Gil Grissom. We're from the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
Poison could've come from any of these sources here.
In every way. This guy was like the monster closer. You ever buy a brand-new car, Griss?
It's not about logic. It's about that smell. There's nothing like the smell of a brand-new car.
Warrick Brown.
Fred Stearns just passed away. Again.
That unknown substance I collected from Marty Gibson's coat ...
How'd you know?
Fred Stearns dropped a dime at girls, girls, girls and wrote it off.
Neiman Marcus, jewelry department?
Well, here's a freaky one. Since when are two dozen mice a business expense?
You know it's illegal in the state of nevada to have venomous snakes?
What do you mean, 'none'?
So, Marty was telling the truth? It was just a coincidence that he owns poisonous snakes, and his co-worker was envenomated.
Hey.
Yeah, not too far away. My grandmother still lives down the block. Lot of familiar faces.
We're going to do our jobs.
What was he doing here?
Phelps?
What happened, man?
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry.
I got here as quick as I could. What happened?
You are making a difference. I'm living proof. I'm sorry.
I want this case.
Matt told me his house was broken into about a week ago. They took all of his awards, his medals. Everything in this case. I hope whoever took it, it meant as much to them as it did to him.
No doubt. All this damage.
Yeah?
You saw his girl. She was hot. They're probably macking on her.
And the bullets went from right to left.
Took that corner pretty hard, huh?
Yeah.
There's a silver paint transfer, though, right here.
Jay ... Jacobs?
Gene Jaycobs. I knew that kid. I went to school with him. He got kicked out.
Put your hands out in front of you.
I can process this now. It would tell me if you fired a gun within the last couple of hours. But I'm going to take this back to the lab, make you sweat it out.
We got him.
Oh, come on. That's it? That's his genius story?
He's lying.
Our shooter isn't only a liar, he's a thief. Found tons of electronic equipment in there, still in the boxes.
No guns or ammo. But I do have his car keys.
I may have something here. The shooter's vehicle took out a mailbox. The dent's in the right spot, and the car is the right silver color 
Nothing visible.
Hey.
It's not that simple.
We got all our guys on this, Matt, all right?
You still using them same old uniforms?
Yeah.
Hey, I ain't stupid. I know where I came from. I wouldn't be anywhere, if it weren't for this place.
Still do. I don't recognize this ugly-ass gang symbol.
Break-ins?!
I'll look into it for you, all right? We'll get them there. When's Aimee's service?
Matt, if there's anything I can do ...
Brown.
What?
If Jaycobs is going to slip through our fingers, I need someone else to explain to him what went wrong.
That's supposed to be his alibi?
Clothes he slept in, bloodshot eyes. The guy's a junkie, Grissom. You can see it, I can see it, and the jury will see it.
But what?
Come on.
Sports chalet is ten minutes away. That's no alibi.
So that's it? As easy as that, he walks.
Not here. C'mon.
C'mon. We're going to cool off.
This guy's been in Matt's house.
Matt's team won this three years ago. This trophy was given to the rec center last year. I found all this stuff in Jaycobs' car.
This is the same guy who shot Matt's daughter in the head. He's walking around laughing at us.
What is this? I've been putting guys away like this for years. And now that it matters, it's like you're holding me back here.
I'm so tired of hearing that. I've heard it a million times. I can't be like you. I'm not a robot, okay? 
I actually care about these people.
Keep it.
Assistant District Attorney Kelly's office, please. This is Warrick Brown.  Yeah, I know it's not standard procedure but, uh, I missed him at lockup, and I'm going to be in hot water if I don't get this stuff back to him, so ... good.
It's just me. Nobody here. Got no heater.
I just thought I'd come by and let you know we're going to get you for robbery, if not murder. By the time you get to lockup, every roughneck in the joint is going to know you off'ed a nine-year-old little girl.
Want to step outside, then?
What, you think I did this?
Well, I didn't.  I'd just to shake the hand of the guy that did, though. 
Where were you last night?
I'm going to need to see your hands.
Other side.
But I never touched the guy.
If he's guilty, we're going to put him away.
Eye for an eye and the whole world goes blind? You taught me that.
I've got no choice here. My hands are tied. I got to let them bring you in.
Of course.
Yeah.
Great, thanks.
Hey.
Yeah.
Grissom. 
Matt used to have this really harsh rule about no eating in the van.
Just see if you can get some DNA off of this stick, would you?
Tyrel Constantine. Arrested last June for joyriding. Date of birth '87? This guy's a juvie. He's only 15.
He used to?
So you threw him out?
When did this happen?
The vehicle that was used in that drive-by was the van that was stolen from your rec center.
He gave up on himself.
I blew it.
Have we had any luck on cross-referencing any of the guys in their lives?
We're still working on some shoe prints but the plaster's still wet.
Yeah, you'd know it, Spanky.
Yeah, not outside some poor woman's bedroom window.
Good. Looks like I got a size eight. Check back with me, I should have more in a bit.
Hey, this cast that poured into the shoe print that I found outside that victim's bedroom window ...
Pulled off some trace materials from it. It's like a yellow substance. It may be paint. Take a look and tell me what you think. Check it out.
Yeah, I'm thinking maybe road paint ... crosswalk ... lane markings maybe.
That stuff dries pretty fast. So he must've stepped in it on his way to the scene.
Hello. I'm Warrick Brown. I'm from the Las Vegas Crime Lab. We're investigating a disturbance a couple doors down. I wanted to ask you a few questions if I could.
Foam at the sinner's den ...
I hung out here a few times.
Your knucklehead boyfriend never took you on the party circuit?
That's cool about Vegas. It's Monday: Rain at the Palms; Tuesday: Eden at studio 54; Wednesday: Raw at the Luxor; Thursday's Baby's ...
A little of both. Don't you love this town?
It's the foam. 
Reminds me of the Mirage. Steve Wynn didn't like the smell of the volcano erupting, so he changed the fuel mixture. Now it smells like a pi√±a colada.
Got a long dark hair.
I was wondering where I put my nice silver satin thong.
Glow stick. Ball-point pen. Cell phone antenna. You have the luminol?
Thank you.
Nothing.
Are we sure it was a blunt object?
Stilettos, huh? Brings out the toes, accentuates the legs. Murder on the ankles, though.
Hello.
We work as a team.
Uh-huh.
Hey. We heard about what happened. I'm so sorry.
Yeah.
They're all ladies.
Killers usually don't stray too far from home. 
Yeah, I'm squeezing the Las Vegas search area.
I'll exclude everyone with light hair.
Huh. Rebecca McCormick. 235 Desert Ranch Road. 'First time', my ass.
Okay, the hair on the left is from Trey Buchman's room at The Sphere hotel. The hair on the right is a sample we took from Rebecca McCormick. Cuticles on both are shiny and smooth. Telltale signs the hair has been treated. 
The cortex isn't letting any light through. It lets us know the hair's been colored. The medullas are continuous. I can't be definitive without DNA, they look like Rebecca McCormick's.
Your hair has a similar morphology to the hair that we found in Mr. Buchman's hotel suite.
No, but the DNA we also recovered from under the sheets does mean you.
The same amount that we found in Croix Richards' apartment.
Like coming in the back way, huh?
It's okay.
I'm Warrick Brown. This is Catherine Willows.
Is it a high profile?
Who are we looking for here?
Tavian Tombs, professional basketball player. Very high profile.
We're here to find your son.
Look, I've seen you take out three guys on the glass and still finish. I'm not here to bang boards with you. I'm here to do my job.  It's your son; it's your call.
'I have Isaiah. Bring $5 million to the northwest corner of Telfair and Juniper, 4:00 A.M.'
You said that Captain Brass was here?
At least let us mark it.
8 x 11 plain white copy paper. It's mass-produced. You can get it anywhere. The envelope, unfortunately, is self-adhering.
No.
Nothing I can see.
They weren't lying. They all touched it. Everybody's who's got a piece of Tavian got a hand on that ransom note. Even the bellman and the desk clerk left prints on the envelope.
Just a few smudges, a couple of partials.
No.
Yeah, that was detected on the ransom note-menthol and nicotine. 
We're way past the drop time here.
No, I think it's just some freak with a nicotine habit and access to a laser printer.
Yeah, that money's not doing him any good now, huh?
It's just gone bad.
Hey! Hey!
What are you concerned about here -- the kid or your job?
It's him. I'll take the perimeter.
Thanks. I'm not ready to deal with another murdered kid. I'll process the evidence.
Thanks. Have you taken a look?
Well?
Sisal? Rope? Mostly likely from the restraint.
Take a look.
It's canine. Sweatshirt was riddled with dog hair. Many different breeds.
Kids love dogs. I know when I was a kid, I was all over them. That's a good start. Thanks.
What have you got?
He was drugged?
Well, we lifted dog hair from the sweatshirt we found near the body.
Multiple breeds.
Try the reference of Veterinary Pharmaceuticals and Biologicals.
It wasn't the money drop that went bad. The problem was Isaiah died.
Okay.
Cath?
Partner you think?
Okay. Sample from the kennel is on your right. Your bear on the left. 
Three grand a month? Tavian tombs has been a $12 million-a-year player for eight seasons, not including endorsements.
Motive for us. She was right to assume that Tavian would immediately pay that ransom. What's five million to a guy who makes hundreds of millions?
I don't know. I think that Bridget Willis killed him because he killed Isaiah.
Plenty of tire treads, but nothing looks fresh.
I got called in by Internal Affairs. How do you think it went? Too many questions.  Thanks.
Yeah.  It's a red light camera. Did any of the witnesses see the driver run the red light? 
I'll put in a call.
Now, that looks fresh.
Catherine.  Tire treads. That kills one theory. Car's brakes must've been working.
Do you know how long it takes to get in touch with anybody at the transportation safety bureau? It's way out of hand. Diane Lambert ran the light.
Well, the tread marks tell us that her brakes did work, so it must've been something else that malfunctioned, causing her to accelerate.
Hey. You have, uh ...
Don't worry about it. How's it going? You find anything?
Well, I did some more digging down at the TSB. I found out that the red light camera that photo'd our driver catches four times as many violators as any other camera in Vegas.
The building has mirrored glass on it. Lets in the light, but it keeps out the glare.
So you think the sun was a factor in the crash?
The accident was at 5:15, so the sun was still in the sky.
Yeah.  All right, well, there's 24 hours in a day, 360 degrees in the earth's rotation. 360 divided by 24 is ... 15?
Wow, you're fast. 3.75, huh?  Then the sun was behind the trees at the time of the accident, so it was not a factor.
Are you serious? David lost a body?
When did he come in?
Eleven days ago? I guess we've got no more crime scene to process.
And a nice laceration with ecchymosis on his left temple.
Could have been an accident.
Looks like his gear's all here. I don't see a sleeping bag, though.
You called it. Positive for blood.
Got a trail of bloody footprints.
Grissom. I think I might have just found our murder weapon.
Mrs. Mercer, we found this statue on your mantle. It had your fingerprints on it.
Well, we also found your husband's blood on the base of it. 
Really?
I guess the machine ate it, huh?
Wicked.
So these are Willy Reddington's original gear. This guy was classy. He goes into a store, buys new clothes, and leaves the old ones behind. And they tossed them in the dumpster.
This is Vegas, baby. Anybody can get lucky.
Not a drop.
Yeah, how do you dump a body with no car? What did he do, drag Mercer down the strip?
Everything was still there. Except the coin collection.
Who called it in?
We got an I.D. On the body?
Driver's permit.
Tell them to watch their step. There's casings and blood everywhere.
Divide and conquer. Inside or outside?
I'll take everything below the knees.
Got some shards of glass. Clear in color.  Mixed with small pieces of black plastic.
You almost finished with that? What's your count?
109 bullets?
Geez, what was this kid, tortured?
What do you think could've done this? Baseball bat?
Yeah. 
Shot from a distance. 
And at a downward angle ... it's, uh ... it's about 25 degrees. He was shot from above.
Rooftop angle is 45 degrees. This is 25 degrees? It's impossible.
What else you got?
There's nothing harmless about death.
This where the limbo party is? 
Can I come in?
Well, I've got your one-to-ones. The tire treads, there's nothing specific here.
But the shoe prints that you took, they look interesting. It looks like five suspects walked in, and four ran out.
No doubt. How's it coming with your big bamboo here?
You test for GSR? The place was riddled with bullets-- it wouldn't hurt.
Maybe this has nothing to do with the case. Maybe it was just a piece of debris left at the scene.
Where you going?
The mother. Tell them I'm on my way.
I'm very sorry for your loss, Mrs. McCallum.  Are you Timmy's brother?
We were able to identify Timmy by the driver's permit that we found at the scene. Had he been driving long?
What kind of car does Timmy drive?
Do you ever drive the mini-van, Kevin?
Did you drive Timmy to the warehouse the other night?
We have reason to believe that Kevin was at the warehouse that night. We found his DNA on some beer bottles.
I understand. We are going to need to keep Kevin here to ask him some more questions about that night. Do you object?
Hodges, how's it coming with that glass?
Looks like there's some kind of coating on it. 
You think someone has this murder on tape?
Venus and Serena. Perfect match.
I found a 12-pack container in the McCallum minivan. Sales slip said
Peel it back.
Skateboarding? Why don't you stand up and take off your shirt.
Geez, man, what happened to you? Turn around.
Those are the same markings your brother had. You want to tell us what went down here?
Kevin, who did this to you, man?
I'm sorry I'm late. What bullet are you on?
Yeah, hook it up.
The trajectory is all pointing in one uniform area. Looks like some kind of a pole.
The whole case has been like this. It's like you can't wrap your head around it, you know?
Camera glass, blood droplets everywhere, DNA that says five people were there, one boy's dead, one boy's injured, and he ain't sayin' nothin' ...
I'm on it.
I'm Warrick Brown from CSI. You want to tell me what happened here?
Where'd he start?
What'd he steal? 
Where?
This isn't funny anymore.
... right now, it looks like only your Innoko water product is involved. CSI is going to need the name of any recent firings, anyone with a lawsuit against the company, anyone who's made threats against the company -- anyone with an axe to grind.
If we have to, one bottle at a time until we find every tainted bottle.
Oh, so, each time Dougie Max and Casey Flynn took a sip, the liquid came in contact with the threads and washed back into the bottle.
Great.
I got all the stacks arranged by locations, so the convenience store is right here. 140 bottles-- NV6630.
Well, the bottle that killed Casey Flynn came from this store.
Over here.
So, the source of the poison bottles was the comedy club.
Why?
Yeah, somebody man-handled her pretty good before they killed her.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Tastes like sugar.
You've been watching way too much Discovery Channel.  This guy needs a girl. 
I'm going to check out the cabana.
Hey, fellas. Looks like the husband pulled a Clark Kent and left all his clothes behind. Couldn't have gone far. I got his wallet, credit card and keys.
You hear that? What is that?
Sounds like it's clogged.
You still harping on the solo thing? You know every time you work with me you learn something.
Yes.
You must get a lot of ass on a job like this, huh?
Yeah, I get it. The last time you were there did you happen to see anything out of the ordinary?
Maybe.
You mind if I take a look in your cab?
Well, that's a coincidence.
Newman's anti-vortex filter was missing three screws.
Oh, you mean, like, a 'leave-behind'?
The more she'd want you.
Well, the lab wants more of you, too. We're going to need your fingerprints and a DNA sample.
How's it coming?
Sometime this year.
All right, where do I stand?
Big steps? Little steps?
I go any further, I'll be in the closet.
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
How's this?
These slime will do anything to sell a house, huh?
Hey, John McEnroe, where's the game?
Prints came back to the pool boy.
All right, now, don't get your panties in a bunch.  Uh, so we got the blond hair, the tooth filling ... that's it, huh?
White neoprene.
Like in a wet suit neoprene? 
Was the vic a diver?
Let's think about that. Who wears a white wet suit in a pool?
A professional.
Yeah.
Hey, Sara.
You working that case where some mob beat up an Indian cab driver for hitting a kid?
You think it was racially motivated?
Yeah. We got to wait for the science, don't we?
That's the job. Good luck.
Uh, that's between me and my trainer.
A buck 95, give or take a doughnut.
I don't get paid enough to play dead.
You're such a drag.
Can I get up?
Hi, Judy.
Hey, I like it gentle, okay?
Thanks.
You want to tell me what's going on here?
You saw her dragging me around. You know, I'm glad I can help. I, uh, I'm late for the chiropractor's. I'll send you the bill.
There's only two reasons why people get murdered in a casino.
Quick escape. Murder Central. Security cameras?
I'll take the money trail.
Hey, girl.
What you got?
869? That's, like, two floors away from where she was found dead.
He's M.I.A., but he left a gambling paper trail.
I have a signature and a thumbprint from where Mr. Dominguez signed a
It was cash advance on a credit card. It's not cheap. It's, like $90 every thousand.
Not if you're desperate. He must have had a bad night.
Let's do it.
Yeah.
Stopped for gas in Barstow. Big tank. $43.
Ford explorer. California plates. Two-Paul-Charlie-Edward-329.
Yeah, this one looks like he was cut from the back.
What?
Who's that?
Don't tell me you opened your mouth to the guy.
Hey, man. You could lose your job over something like this.
Best thing you could do is go to Grissom and 'fess up.
Or what, you going to wait till he comes to you and then lie about it?
Need some help with that?
That weight on your shoulders.
Yeah. What's up?
Mm-hmm. I heard about that. He made his bones in Vegas. I mean, what do you expect? The guy's bulletproof.
Want to talk about it?
On who?
What'd you use as an exemplar?
That's why they kicked it.
Of what?
Do we have to do the inventory on all this?
Whoa.
I also found glitter on Mr. Dominguez.
Forget it. Ice destroyed it.
Hey, Sara. Any jurors have blood on their hands?
That was Catherine.
Nuts. Specifically those that begin with a 'P.'
Take me out to the ball game.
There's peanut skins under Mr. Durham's seat.
Mr. Gibbons couldn't eat peanuts. What are they doing under his seat?
One auto-injector... used.
What do you want to bet he only brought one of these with him.
Ah, he was later held defenseless against the attack of the killer peanut.
What about peanut butter? 
In an individually wrapped tube?
Yeah, that's more than just messing with a guy's head.
Not if you can't explain to me how your fingerprints ended up on this peanut butter tube.
Stuffed inside a soda can. We found it in the jury room.
Mr. Gibbons will never get to experience the rest of his life.
So you decided to put it in his chili instead?
You had to know it was going to kill him.
Well, Miss Newsome, you are officially off of jury duty.
Well, that does go along with what the bride-to-be said about the victim. That he had a dermatological response to the allergen and not a respiratory one.
So the cause of death is still anaphylactic shock.
Jack's an arson investigator. We were here on this same street ten days ago. 
I don't know, but I'm keeping my eyes peeled. Maybe they came back to take a look.
That would explain why the firemen didn't find her right away.
This door's unlocked.
Well, this could be how Sabrina got in. Comes home late, forgets to lock the door behind her. It's an opportunity waiting to happen.
Uh, couple of weak partials. What you got, partner?
You know the fire down the street was in the garage.
Lighter fluid from the garage.
This is home video from the first fire.
Well, they say arsonists often commit crimes where they feel most familiar. The last fire was set during the day in the garage when the family was out of town.
Or when the door was left unlocked.
Well, a match was found at the first fire. If we could find a match in the debris of the second fire, then we may know for sure.
Let's run her.
According to Catherine, Jessica Abernathy had major credit card debt but minimal insurance-not even enough to cover what she had. Besides, people tend to remove mementos when they know what's coming.
Why, what'd they do?
It makes sense if the fire was unintentional.
Well, we think we might have figured out what caused the fire. Ms. Abernathy, does anyone in your house smoke?
Sabrina maybe?
Ma'am, earlier you provided us with a urine sample. We found traces of nicotine in yours.
Really? Would you mind opening your purse for me?
Nick's girlfriend.
Well, who's there? Grandma? I mean aside from being on lockdown, she's arthritic. I don't see her writing on the floor. What about Jessica?
That brings us back to Sabrina.
What are you saying, she's on a kamikaze mission? Trying to take the whole family down with her?
Oh, yeah.
Let's just hope that whomever wrote it touched something else.
Well, that's good shooting.
I've got some smudges over here, too.
Hey, Sam. 
You okay?
So tell me, what kind of things you like to do on the weekends?
Like to play with matches?
Why is that?
Yeah.
You ever have trouble sleeping at night?
Is that what happened Saturday?
Couldn't go back to bed?
What'd you find?
Purple jelly?
Did you eat it?
That sounds like fun.
Oh ... that must've made you mad.
So, what happened next?
Then what?
You like when the firemen come?
You know, Sam ... that word that you wrote on the floor ... 
you know, that's a really bad word.
No sign of forced entry ... on this door, at least.
Yeah.
If the killer went out the back door, this may be his print.
Good thing Brass had cops watching the house. 
Either way, they were sick and dangerous.
I'll hear it when you give me a dub of the original caller's voice ... and his phone number.
Good.
Yeah.
Mm ... have you run a sample of this through the GCMS?
Polyethylene. I got the results back from Grissom's ant puddle.
Corn syrup, glucose, caramel and water.
On top of the file cabinet.
So, what's up? You and Bobby switched or what?
Hey, Rich, whatever happened with those bullets?
Consistent with officer commons and Officer Nowlin's weapons?
Well, thanks.
Yeah?
Polyethylene and corn syrup is... cola in a bottle.
So, that shooter was sitting on the house and the surveillance team. 
Empties out his bottle of soda... calls in an 'officer down' ... ...drops the phone and takes a walk.
Check it out.
I have never heard a citizen that calm. This 911 caller knew the drill. He's using Officers code. 'J' becomes john. 'O' becomes ocean. J.O.--
I'm only halfway home. I need a voice exemplar. Did you get a name off that badge?
Drinks?
Hold on.
Oh, no, no. Okay, okay. Drinks at my place.
Fromansky didn't make that call, Gris.
This guy's a nut job vigilante. He's making the whole department look bad.
Yeah, lots of times ... what about you?
I hate these cases.
And someone dumped her face up.
I guess the rain would've washed away any trace evidence: Tire prints, shoe impressions.
Guess it wasn't worth the killer's time.
Ma'am, the coroner believes that Tessa died over twenty-four hours ago. Had you reported her missing?
When was the last time that you saw her?
When's the last time you went twenty-four hours without talking to Lindsey?
I'm just saying, she didn't check on her own kid, you know?
It looks like there's soil inside of her wound.
Right. Should be soil around the wound. And on the wound, but not inside of it.
Hey.
Tessa Press took the bus to and from school, not far from here.
I showed her picture to the mini-mart manager. She remembers seeing her the day that she was killed.
She says she came in every afternoon and bought a little Debbie and a soda.
Officer Ray did speak with Carrie and her parents, and they confirmed that Tessa sleeps at least two nights a week over their place.
I don't think they had any kind of a schedule. She would just show up, and when she didn't, they'd assumed that she was at home.
I've already secured the footage.
I found Tessa.
Yeah.
I've been looking for you.
Hodges analyzed the trace from inside Tessa's wound.  It seems it was zoodoo.
Hoof stock. It's a combination of feces from rhinos, zebras, and bison.
They say that the smell of wild animal crap keeps the deer away.
There is a zoo in Auckland that exports it. And there's only one landscaping company in Clark County that imports it -- ADL. I contacted ADL, and guess what they told me? Couple of months back, they were hired by the victim's mother.
Hey. Could I have a word with you outside for a moment?
Why not?
Did you pick her up that afternoon?
You mind if I take a look in the back of your truck? 
Only if you deny me access.
Thanks.
In 1988, your client was arrested for a drunk and disorderly. Your fingerprints were then entered into our database. They match the fingerprints that we found on this shovel.
They were the only prints on the shovel.
That's possible. But your client's fingerprints provided a sufficient basis for a warrant to search her vehicle. 
The choice of weapon and the manner of disposal suggest that this was not a premeditated murder.
Smudges. Nothing but smudges. Doesn't anybody use formica anymore?
Hey, hold up.
Hey, David. Give me a minute and let me clear a path here, okay?
All right.
There's at least four weeks of mail here, Grissom.
Turns a grape into a raisin.
She tried to claw her way out.
Hey, Griss. 
Don't you think this is kind of odd? A woman who spends the time making tea like this leaves a chunk of chocolate cake on the counter.
Yeah. Some crack head brutalizes an old lady, leaves her in a closet, and grabs a snack on the way out.
Autopsy ruled those premortem. At least a day old. It was a close shot, non-contact, downward angle. No primer residue on the hands. T.O.D. was approximately 2:00 A.M. No one found the body until 7:00 A.M. A lot of wind ... 
I got to go see my mummy.
Yeah? You know what rolls downhill?
Come on, you got a lot of new skills to master. Field work's a little messier than your test tubes and your GCMS.
One continuous motion, nice and easy.
That's not bad. Keep practicing. Nine more to go.
Hey.
Nothing spells excitement like a B and E.
We don't.
If you're out to rob somebody's house, why would you do it when they're home?
Can you generate a composite?
The guy with the closet fixation is Steve Jansson.
Them's fightin' words. Did he get his man?
Well, that probably hurt business.
No. It's a non-contact wound at a downward angle. It's a textbook murder.
Doesn't explain how the gun left the scene.
Just to toss it in suburbia a week later?
What's in the scope?
You got a theory?
Yeah.
Hey, hey, hey.
What is that you just threw in there?
You know that piece of half-eaten shark with cake that Gris and I found at the old lady Maddie's house? This is from the same restaurant.
Same night as the home invasion. Signed by LINDA KIRKWOOD. Dinner for one.
Same Restaurant ...
So both women came in alone?
I kind of doubt that a clean-cut guy like Ryan is hanging out with snaggletooth Steve.
We know Jansson's partner knew the customers at the restaurant.
Jose Cortez. Worked at the Wilson Street Grill from '93 to '94.
We were so close, you don't even know.
Yeah.
Probably safer than anything else I had planned. Yeah.
Loses his manhood. Guess he thought he had nothing left to live for.
On a windy night, a balloon can go for miles.
You with me?
Oh, yeah.
Super came in and checked the a/c and he found him like this. Wesley Jones. 33. His massage chair. No signs of forced entry.
Small bruise on the fingertip, but no outward signs of trauma.
Diet shake, fitness magazines, cookie crumbs on a baking sheet. This guy's trying to start a diet or falling off one?
Sounds like a heat stroke to me.
There's no tenting. So he wasn't dehydrated. No, heat stroke.
What about drugs?
Heart attack?
I've run out of questions.
Oh, you sectioned off that fingertip bruise.
The skin cells look stressed out.
He was electrocuted. But how come there's no burn marks?
And a point of contact.
These wires are all insulated. No burn marks. Current didn't pass through this chair.
What you got?
Is there any sign of electrical surging?
I like surprises.
Bingo. Look at that. Current went through the phone.
Heat lightning. Storm rolls through the desert, sometimes it strikes in town.
This look like a myth to you?
Strike map from the national lightning detection network.
This is Vegas in yellow. 
Hasn't had a lightning strike in three days.
All I got is a fried phone.
If the phone wasn't the way in, maybe it was the way out.
Yes.
This about it?
Okay ... now, electricity is fickle, right?
One centimeter can mean the difference between a little zap and dead. 
So, let's assume that the current went out through his right index finger and the phone. For it to cross his heart, it must've come from the left side of his body, right?
His bare foot touched the floor.
Path of least resistance.
Found this mineral residue that led all the way from the massage chair to this burnt-out power strip across the room ... water stain.
I also found them on the cookie sheet and this water-damaged magazine right here. And I found this plastic bag in the kitchen garbage.
Add that with the fan, you got yourself a homemade swamp cooler.
Guy was just trying to stay cool.
Did I miss a memo or something?
He's got you pushing his paperwork, huh?
Really?
You got to have money to go to college these days.
Well, that's at least two thousand students. Maybe you'll get lucky with the victim's prints.
Freshman in a sophomore course?
It sucked. I hate lawyers, I hate court. They all need to dry up and die.  Hi.
Yeah.
Thank you. Thank you so much. And you are?
Good luck.
Nice to meet you.
Good luck.
All right.
Well, there's what blew your fuse.
Not always.
You think it's a suicide?
Yeah, he's got some old school suicide scars.
For inspiration or for last rites?
Pack of cigarettes, sweetener, and a hot dog wrapper.
I wouldn't be so sure.
You know how long I've played here and I've never gotten laid?
Good.
Tricks are for kids, man. I don't play games anymore.
I'm working on a case. Did anyone hit a big jackpot here yesterday?
50 g?
Did he look like this?
Do you remember about what time that was?
Really?
Funkier than James Brown, huh?
Good to see you, man.
What time did the super say the electricity went out?
12:30? How does a broke-ass guy like lance lose fifty grand in thirty minutes?
Well, they say gamblers are creatures of habit. I bet you lance did the same thing every day. Win or lose. I'm going to need to take a walk in this guy's shoes.
Hey, captain.
Do you sell Clark cigarettes?
Really?
Is this the other guy?
Hey, pop. Like the buddha said to the monk, make me one with everything.
Were you working last night?
Who does?
Really? Would you happen to know where this punk kid lives?
Clear!
Whoo! Would you look at the size of this flat screen? My lord, that's a whole month of my pay right there. A new playstation? A brand-new stereo?
You must have sold a lot of hot dogs last night, huh?
Did you get that from Lance? You know, your old friend. Did you sell a lot of hot dogs him?
Take this guy out of here.
I was testifying today. I ran into the D.A. He filled me in on your case.  Looks like Matt Hawkins' confession is gonna stand up in court.
So you think he's innocent?
Sounds like a suspect.
Need some help?
I'll meet you in the car.
In the meantime, if you could just answer the question.
Yeah.
How did he scare them?
When was the last time that you saw him?
Whose blood is it on your sweater, Walter?
We're gonna give you a nice warm place to sleep tonight, partner.
Or this sweater could have accidentally been left in the park, and Walter, the homeless guy, could have picked it up and worn it when he entered the house through the screen door and killed Ty. But none of the evidence goes to motive.
Mmm ... 5'10'. About Nick's height.
What you getting at?
Go ahead.
This land used to be part of the Bennett estate.
Yeah. Huh. We used to come out here when we were in high school. Used to be, like, a seven-acre lover's lane.
I was a dork in high school. I'm still a dork, but I had dimples. I got a little action.
Crop circle?
I guess it's a crop circle.
The guy has a blindfold on.
Lividity's fixed? So this wasn't a body dump? He died there?
That's odd, because the grass around the victim was undisturbed.
Oh! Now, that's alien. What is that?
Yeah, that cyst grows up to be nice fat tapeworm that attaches itself to the intestinal wall and sucks out all your nutrients.
I'm glad it picked the mouth.
Well, the tapeworm could have made the guy sick, but it didn't kill him.
We're from the crime lab. We have information that put your chopper at a crime scene yesterday, around noon.
... So I took my girl to that Ultimate Fight Championship on Saturday night.
Yeah. Almost ended up getting into a smackdown of my own.
You know, Tina doesn't like me carrying a gun. I play down the fact that I'm a cop when I'm with her anyway.
So, uh, we're standing out in front of the hotel, making out and this guy walks up to me, gets in my face, and asks me how she is.
I tell him to get lost. He says, 'Make me.'  So I took a step forward and out of nowhere his big, fat bodyguard, looking like wimpy from Popeye, walks up and starts to close in on me.
It was at the valet parking, which might as well be in Arizona, it's so far away from the lobby. This fat boy is looking like he's obviously carrying some sort of weapon. And I'm standing there naked as a p0rn star with my girl.
They didn't seem to care. One of the guys sounded Russian, like he was wanna-be Mafia.
Fat boy was obviously his bodyguard.
So, uh, you know, I wasn't physically afraid of the guys, but something was kind of sinister about them. They were provoking me, but they weren't making a move. It was almost like they were waiting for me to make a move. Say if I smacked big-mouth, fat boy would've came over and stabbed me or something. Even fat boy was vibing me not to take the bait.
Well, valet finally brought Tina's car up. So, I maneuver her around these guys and I put her in her car, and I turn my back to them and let 'em talk this smack. I'm calming Tina down. Tell her everything is fine. She drives off and I walk away. I called Tina later on and I tell her, uh, you know, if she got any problem with me being a cop, she needs to get over it, 'cause now I'm packing.
Scoured the hotel looking for these punks.
Yeah, you better flip that coin.
Heads.
Have fun at the trash run.
Hey. 
What do you need me to do?
Yeah, there was some sort of large vehicle here. 
All right, print it out.
I need you to bring up the traffic cameras in a three-block radius between Flamingo and Koval in the last 24 hours.
That's good enough. Our guy was taken around 11:00. 
Scan forward. We're looking for a big truck.
It's on the list.
Whoa, he's really moving.
Wait a minute. That one, the big Ford.
Follow it.
The Expedition truck left the area around 11:15. Definitely in a hurry. Took a right off Koval onto Tropicana, crossed Las Vegas Boulevard onto
Yeah, stuff is volatile. Flammable. Outside of meth cooks, no one uses it anymore.
Yeah, it was just bad luck he did.
We've got to assume that it is.
Looks like a live feed to me. I say we keep the light on.
That's the wrong box, Greg.
That one right there.
All right, let's go over it again. The diagnostic unit gets attached to that black box, which gives us the mileage of his last trip. Like an airplane.
Right.
Twenty-three miles. We know he was heading east on the 215.
How's he doing?
Yeah.
What are you doing, Nicky?
What are you doing, Nicky?
Don't do it, Nicky!
You son of a bitch!
Oh.
You're still alive.
No.
Maybe if we count up all the damn 'maybes,' maybe Nick will be alive!
You know what I'm saying?!
Damn.
I'm not.
I just can't help thinking that could have been me in that box, you know? We flipped a coin for that trash run.
If that was me, I would have ...
No. You're wrong. I wouldn't have lasted this far. Catherine, if something happens to Nick, if we don't bring him back in one piece ...
Oh, got an edge right here. All right.
I don't know, man. It would have to be at least six feet long.
I hit something.
Nick!
Nick! Hold on there, buddy!
All right, based on this battery and what's running off of it, and the fact that we kept the damn light on for as long as we did, I figure Nick's got another ninety minutes left, now.
Okay, I've got two nurseries within the overlap area. Here and here.
I hit something.
Hey!
Hey!
We got you, man! Hey, Nicky!
Nicky! Yeah. Hey, hold on there.
Hey, put that down. Put that down.
Put that down. We got you. We're gonna get you out of here. 
Hang in there.  Oh, my God. We need that fire extinguisher! Give me that fire extinguisher.
These ants are getting at him, man.
Oh.
Hang on, buddy. Hang on. Almost had him.
Hang on. Hang on. We'll kill those ants, okay? You listen to me.
Yeah.
One, two, three.
I'm not leaving without Nick.
I'm not leaving here without him.
I got you. I got you. 
Lay still. Lay still. It's okay. It's okay.
How'd you shoot, man?
You and I need to go practice some, huh?
Well, when they take your piece, you'll make time.
Easy. With a map and a smile.
Rolls up -- 'Hey, little girl, I'm lost. You from around here?'
Yeah.  What's missing?
Her sister said the victim changed back into her school uniform in the car. 
Hello.
Welcome.
The mother's bloody t-shirt.
It's on its way.
How so?
Phew! That's a lot of perverts.
That's still a lot of perverts.
What's up?
Epithelials?
That confirms his story that the briefs were never worn. Hair?
Great. That means we have to let the b*st*rd go. It's only a matter of time before he snatches up another kid.
Yeah, but they can't watch him indefinitely.
Or they'll kill him.
They found Alicia Perez.
She's wrapped up pretty tight.
Diazepam? That's a pretty hard-core antidepressant for a kid that small.
You think they didn't care about her?
Well, it must've been hard, trying to keep their son alive, keep the family together. Couldn't have been easy.
Yeah. Blue fibers.
I take it you qualified at the range.
What'd you shoot?
Where are you doing?
I have a confirmation. Those blue fibers are consistent with the blanket that the girl was wrapped in. And the shoe prints that I found at the scene, they're a match to the father's work boots. 
This guy was rolling on all cylinders. He was bound to throw a rod.
Wallet's empty.
I got a noisemaker.
Point two-eight?! That's barely conscious for most people. That's like falling down drunk. 
Wow. If it was illegal, fun or nasty, this guy was into it.
Was there enough for DNA?
Oh, I don't really know. I ... you know what? Let me call you back, okay?
Ellie?  Hey. You know your father's out of surgery.
It's a little too early to tell, but I know when he wakes up, he'll be happy to see you.
I know so. You look good.
That's not what I meant, but no.
Look, what do you want me to say, hmm? It's not really about you right now, okay? But the fact that you're here is saying a lot.
Are you finished processing those prints from Manny Rupert's apartment?
We're looking for anything the hooker might have touched. We're thinking she might have slipped him something that pushed him over the edge.
Hmm. Maybe she's not a killer.
Miss Rupert, as far as we can tell, your brother died from diabetic shock.
Well, it seems that he went on a bender. He consumed a great deal of alcohol, sugar and narcotics. Did he party like this a lot?
So he was aware of his condition.
Do you think that this was self-induced? 
Hmm.
So he just ... gave up? He quit?
No. You're right, I don't. 
But I've seen what it's like to not have a choice. And he did. He could have fought it, but he just chose not to.
I'm-I'm so very sorry for your loss.
Okay, guys. I swept the perimeter. I think someone jimmied the back kitchen door.
Now, I printed the doorknob. Nothing but smudges. Check out the fresh scrapings there on the doorjamb and the striker plate.
Good eyes.
Well, she kind of has a point. I do like to take the wife out to dinner every now and then.
Wow.
I'm sure you got an 'A.'
Mm-hmm.
No, I processed the bathroom and the countertops for some kind of plastic laminate.
Really? Was she dating one of your co-workers?
Well, we found marble particles in her house and we identified the stone. It came from this facility.
You followed her into the house?
What did you talk about?
Hey.
Yeah, smells like used diapers.
Maybe not. I mean, this apartment is neat as a pin. A lady this tidy wouldn't leave a broken dish in a rack like that, you know?
What do you make of this? A busted phone ...
-- with gray hairs in it.
I doubt very highly that those were self-induced.
Look at that: it's dented.
Looks like she may have been slammed into her own oven.
Sofia, you get a tenant's name for this apartment?
This place has a direct view of the old lady's apartment.
So, what, the guy's killing the old lady, -- 
-- he sees he's being watched, and he, what, comes back here and whacks the witness?
That's good.
Hi. I'm Warrick Brown from the Crime Lab.
Well, ma'am, we're going to need your daughter's clothes from yesterday.
And you're a princess.
Okay, Suzy, tell me about Max. What's Max like?
How come you didn't know that Paula Sullivan wasn't home?
A big mess? What color was the mess?
Hmm ... Did Max try to hug you or touch you?
Did Max seem surprised to see all that big mess there?
What did Max do next?
I bet you're right. You know what? Could you help me? I've got a picture right here. And I have some crayons, too. Could you draw where the red and the green is in the room?
So the green was all the way up here in the cabinets, too?
Did you help him clean up the mess?
And then what happened?
Hey, Mike.
In a perfect world. We hired this, uh, knucklehead named Mahoney. He had this dyslexic filing system. 
What? 
Oh ... I get it.
Hey, guys.
What'll go faster?
We're here to process those stolen motorcycles, man.
Okay, cut us some slack here, man. You think we really feel like being down here?
How do you want to handle this?
I'd love to bust a cap in his knee.
Brown. Hey, Cath. We'll see you there. Well, in that case ... I'll see you there.
Well, giddyup.
CSI coming through. 
Thank you.
Where's the body?
Got ID?
Hey, Cath, didn't you find Zamesca near here?
Got the 'Jumbo' cup. Shoe and tire impressions. Shot in his car. Think Simon's coming out of hiding?
Want me to take the backseat?
Okay, sarge. Not my first barbecue.
Small-time drug dealer with a big-time rap sheet.
Well, the Holstein scene bullet was fired from the same gun that you found in Rat's car.
I'm not so sure. If this bullet went through the window and a guy's head ... it would have pieces of glass and bits of bone in it.
This hollow point's clean. There's no sand-blasted effect.
There's still blood on it.
You'd better be able to back that one up, man.
Could have come from the same supplier. 
I did see Keppler checking out Zamesca's file yesterday. I didn't think anything strange about it then, but now ...
Catherine put it in a temporary locker.
The Holstein bullet was a little bit too clean, and Keppler didn't seem at all concerned about it. He said that we would see at autopsy.
We got the car.
Catherine sent it to the impound.
I'll run with you.
You?
Brown.
Never.
You know what? Sara's here. And she has the key. Got to go.
I hate being deceived.
Yes.
All right.
Anything I collected, we ignore.
This glass wasn't shot out. Take a look at that.
The only mark a spark plug makes is a nick at the center. Now, who would know about that? 
Means the blood didn't come from his head; it came from his arm.
Well, if Keppler is IA, Catherine can't tell us anything if she wanted to.
Maybe Brass can help us out. 
And your only option was to fabricate evidence and make me process it?
You want to, uh, get a drink or something?
Nick. Nick!
Let it go, man.
What's with the bloody dolls?
Or a disciple.
Classic cars.
Izzy Delancy ... he was a rock star. You know, famous brings out the nut jobs. Maybe we're just looking at a copycat.
Yeah, so, Ernie Dell takes the rap for three murders, and then eats a .38. Why?
Talk to me.
Probably, but whatever it is, it should match exactly. The killer's hyper-specific.
Hey.
Let's check it out.
She's got a cat.
That's her home.
Open it and stand clear.
Ms. Tallman ...
Dr. Tallman ... I need you to take a look at this.
It's a death threat.
No, Miss, no, but we think someone else has. Doctor, your life is in danger. We need you to get dressed and come with us, please.
Thank you.
Is she on something?
We'll get her to the hospital.
And any open food or drink.
Except for us showing up.
Warrick Brown from the Crime Lab.  Thanks for coming in on a Saturday.
You took these.
Well, that's a nice shot right there.
So I guess he's passionate about photography.
Yeah. Did you notice any drama yesterday in class between Megan and Ryan?
Hmm. Ms. Kentner, what kind of cameras do you use in class?
And what about your own personal collection?
Just following up on some evidence. And Ryan called you after the game last night.
And he called you on your cell?
No, thanks. I've ... I've already got it.
The keys are still in the ignition. There's no blood on the driver's seat.
Body dump?
Yeah, a bunch of minors that won't be in the system. That'll be helpful.
What you got?
I don't know.
I think he might be always thinking pink.
If these all belong to one girl, she's got nothing left to wear.
Ooh. How'd he explain that one?
Yeah, right.
Let's hope your taste in men has improved since then.
'I'm likin' basketball, virgin daiquiris, and sweet, sweet ladies.'
Well, he's not an assassin. His van was like a hot sheets motel, and he wants a password.
It's too obvious.
I'll try it anyway.
'Sheila L.-- couldn't move it. Bunny B. is a honey bee. Diane K. taught me a thing or two.' Diane K. Diane Kentner is his photography teacher.
Now, what's a photography teacher doing touching a student's van?
Ms. Kentner, the car that hit Megan Cooper left a broken turn signal light in the road. It's from a Saab. Isn't that the car that you drive?
Well, we're going to need to take a look at yours.
We also found your fingerprint on the door handle of the back of Ryan's van. Could you explain to me how that got there?
Your name came up on, uh, Ryan Lansco's FriendAgenda page, what was called a 'Hit List.' It's apparently a list of people that he slept with.
So, you are denying that you had any sexual relations with Ryan Lansco?
Well, we're going to need to take a DNA sample, and that I have a warrant for.
So, what you find at Diane's house?
There's our busted headlight.
What the hell is that?
I'm slipping, Grissom. I talked to this woman twice, and this body was here the whole time.
She was on a daily dose of lithium. Bipolar.
What is this, Grissom, Romeo and Juliet?
Charlie lied ... to protect Megan.
Hell of a way to spend your night off.
Three.
Grissom's down the hall, first door on your right. Just follow the blood.
She looks so familiar.
I'm not so sure that's a good thing.
Sounds like Becca was still a kid.
So, Grissom, I found beige carpet fibers on all three victims. It's consistent with the hallway carpet. I've also found rug burns on their knees.
What about Becca? Why wasn't she dragged somewhere else?
Well, a gun is one good way for crowd control. Why didn't he just shoot them?
Six girls, one lock.
'They pooled their money and lived the dream in style.'
Well, it says 'Green Valley,' it's got a photo of the house. If you looked hard enough, you could find it.
'Lewis' is the name on a custom wine label that we found at the crime scene. Do me a favor. Could you zoom in on that photo?
Oh, my God. I knew I recognized her. Emily Wilson.
No, last time I saw her, she was still wearing braces.
I don't remember any trouble.
Oh, and I banged the bumper trying to parallel park. I forgot about that one.
Yeah, the old neighborhood reminds me how much I miss her.
I came to see you.
Let me take that for you. New family painted right over my history.
Oh, God.
Mrs. Wilson ...
Um ...
I'm working this case. Those six showgirls ...
Emily listed you as the next of kin.
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
Well, DNA confirmed that Mullins had s*x with Emily and Lauren. Assuming he's the killer, why didn't we find any semen in Becca?
Whoever ... shanked Frost killed those girls.
I don't get it. He stabs the guy and walks back in the bar.
Well, that's also how he could've made the connection to Becca.
Hey, hey, hey. Catherine.
It's all over the radio. I heard.
We're gonna get Lindsey back, okay?
Okay.
Slow down, slow down.
Catherine, I know this is really hard, okay, but could you take a break or get a cup of tea or something here?
I got it.
Oh, this is from this couple from San Francisco. Bought a second home in Seven Hills, came back and found it tossed.
The chair.
Look at that. The chair.
Catherine! Don't touch her!
If you want a conviction, you have to let me do this, all right? Let me do it, all right?
Lindsey, you're gonna be fine.
Almost. Almost.
So how'd she get here?
He's probably at the 420 on Flamingo. They left their purse.
Oh! The thing is heavier than my kid. Ever get hit in the head with one of these? 
Keysha Sayrun?
Well, that's not her.
There's a whole bunch of wallets in here. Driver's permit. Kid's only 15 --
-- has got a credit card? She's got to be a pickpocket.
I got her.
Faith Maroney. Twenty-five ... from Southern Highlands.
Yeah? Well, I miss the days when we only had five homicides a week.
What's the matter, Doc; you been hitting it a little too hard?
No, if I stay up all night, it's not going to be because of a puppy. COD?
Any idea what kind of weapon might have been used?
Paint chips? Could she have been hit by a car?
So if she wasn't standing or lying down ...
She got noodles, hairpins, dish towels, a can of tuna.
You know, I was thinking. If she pinched my wallet, and I whacked her for it, I'd probably get back my wallet before I split.
A couple of loose receipts, all from last night, all paid in cash. A pack of gum from the Bargain Bin, a soda from Carlisa's, and a Bloody Mary from Diane's Steakhouse.
Yeah. At 9:52 p.m.
Steakhouse called Faith Maroney a cab. They have a direct line to this place.
Paint color's not going to help us narrow it down any, is it?
Around 10:00?
Well, we're going to need to see that cab and your trip sheet.
Hey, Nick, there's a camera in here. Maybe that'll be able to tell us if Princess Pickpocket was one of his fares.
You see him last night?
Can you clarify the background?
So Mr. Kambhatla was lying. That's nowhere near the Monte Carlo.
Go back to number two.
The wallet in her hand is ... black. And her wallet was white. 
And he ran her down and took it back.
Well, we have him in custody. We have his wallet. Let's, uh, go see if her prints are on it.
How small are we talking?
Paint samples from 75 cabs? Well, we'll be back in the lab by next week.
So the impact turns it on, huh?
7029 -- that's Dru's cab.
Well, he had to be staging, trying to steal Dru's fare.
Whoa.  Well, that's the corner.
Well, the airbags didn't deploy, so he must have been going under fifteen miles an hour.
You were in the wrong. You were the one who was staging. So why road rage Mr. Kambhatla?
-- show no activity for the past twelve days. So far, that's the best I can do for a time of death.
She has to make these in advance, right? But how do you plan a car wreck? There's no way to know how the car's going to land.
Unless you wreck the car first, and then put her under it.
What?
I don't get it. What does Sara have to do with bleach?
Hiking accident?
It's better than the express route she took.
Okay, Mr. Boy Scout.
Well, looks like she bounced around a lot up here at the top before she caught air.
You pay for 'hot,' believe me.
Oh, I see it. You're getting warm.
Hotter by the foot.
There you go.
That's amazing.
Sir, is that the camera that you used?
May I see it?
What did you do after she fell?
I'd say.
Well, I did find some blood on the rocks at the top of the cliff, as well as a piece of his shirt. Looks like it was a bumpy ride all the way down.
She tore up her hands grabbing on to anything she could.
Was that sustained during the fall ... or did someone step on her hand?
Tina, baby, can you give me a call when you get this? Listen, I know we haven't been spending quality time with each other, but I was thinking tonight we could ...
Work comes first. What's up?
That's a dangerous combination.
Well, would you let your wife drink if she was on medication?
So let me get this straight. You took your depressed wife to the top of Red Rock Canyon, shared a bottle of wine, and then you went on a nature hike?
Maybe it wasn't a suicide, but then again, you're the only one left. You can say anything you want.
According to the coroner, the evidence suggests that her hands may have been stepped on.
Well, if he is lying, somebody should give him an Emmy award.
Yeah. Ultimately, I think he is responsible, whether he meant harm or not.
Well, what if I can prove she tried to kill herself before?
Well, I have her phone. I could go through the most recent calls. If I know women, the husband's usually the last person to know anything.
We have a witness. Why did you kill your wife, Mr. McGill?
You got a name?
What about ID?
Cell phone?
Hey.
Well, we got a souvenir cup that screams 'tourist.'
I don't see a bar anywhere around here. She must've been either going to or coming from the strip.
You know these tourists don't know what they're getting when they book a trip to Vegas online. 
They think 'I got a room on the strip for 75 bucks. Whoo, what a deal.'
You know what? Grissom's crime scene is just five blocks from here. Both victims had their wallets and their cell phones stolen. And they were both beaten down in the same way.
I think I just found a piece of Sanders' hair.
You fellas want to keep it moving? We're trying to work here.
Hey, Nick ...
Nick.
Nick ... 
Nick. Come on!
That's a nice phone you got there, man. Real nice phone. Wonder how many drug dealers' numbers you got on this phone here.
Feel like going to jail tonight? Listen, I'm sorry about the little spill you had earlier, but that's why we got the crime tape up, so you could see it. Watch where you're going next time.  Get you home safely.
What are you doing? We beating people up now?
Then you're in the wrong town.
I'll take a ride with you, but I'm going to pass on the Mexican food at 10:00 in the morning.
It's about time. Finally, some good news.
Are you kidding? Who raises these kids?
Oh, you're doing a great job. Lindsey's gonna turn out to be a beautiful young woman. Besides, I grew up in Vegas. I didn't turn out so bad, did I?
Yeah, these kids need to beat people on the street to be entertained. They just need some good discipline.
They need their grandmother whupping their ass like, like I had.
Hey.
How'd it go in there?
Really?
You know, I know it was a hardcore situation that Greg ran up on, but you think it ever would have occurred to him to just put it in reverse and get the hell out of there?
I know Greg must have been scared as hell, man.
We'll put the jury behind the wheel of the car.
All right, the Denali's black box reports only five seconds before impact. Now, Greg was idling with his foot on the brake. And then he accelerated for no more than two seconds.
Want to give it a go?
Take it for a spin?
You ready?
Go.
Stop!
You think a jury will see it that way?
I already told you, yes.
Are you guys writing any of this down? I first met Candy in the parking lot of the strip club. Later on, I talked to her inside.
Three hundred bucks, but that was because it was part of an investigation.
Yes ...
No, I'm off them.
That part was personal.
Have you guys bothered to call the motel? I checked in with a credit card. I checked out around 5:00. I called a cab. Talk to the cab driver. When I woke up, Candy was gone. When I got back to the club to pick up my car, she was dead.
No-o-o!
Listen to me. I did not kill her. But I know damn well who did.
Hey, Grissom.
Yeah. They cleared me. They didn't seem to have much interest in Gedda.
It's everything to do with Gedda. Sending me a message. Murders an innocent young girl because I got too close to them. I want this case, Gris.
You got any print results from off my car?
Yeah, I've been cleared.
I know that guy.
Hey! I just want to talk to you.
His name is Richard Dorsey.
Dorsey's prints were found inside my car under the broken window.
Grissom, he's a homeless guy. He lives in the alley behind the strip club. Don't you get it? He's Gedda's fall guy. This is a frame job.
Come on. Tell the truth.
Tell the truth.
We'll take care of you. We'll get you into rehab. Come on.
Tell the truth!
Grissom, you and I both know that Gedda killed that girl and pinned it on that bum. They gave him drugs, got him high, and planted the evidence. You just got to give me a chance to prove it.
Dispatch, this is C-21 Brown. The pickup that you're looking for is on level 3 of the PD garage. Suspect is in the vehicle, armed and agitated.
I repeat: suspect is armed and agitated.
Hey, buddy. Hey. You must be Troy, huh?
Just be cool, okay?
All right?
You didn't go to summer camp.
Thanks.
Which, based on her wounds, you figure that was the murder weapon?
Kid starts asking the wrong questions, talking to the wrong people ... tons of possibilities.
Adoptive parents had no contact with the kidnappers? They were not given any ransom demands?
Hey, Greg, you see any books on the shelf over there on gambling or poker?
'Cause I got poker player stats, and multiple websites on online gambling. Seems kind of out of place to be the victim's. I think we got a mystery houseguest who is a card shark.
Got him!
Yeah, whatever.
We're not done yet.
All done here.
Oh, ooh!
Ooh, where's the fire? 
Yeah, it's to help me sleep. I've been having the hardest time lately.
Well, just coming off of grave after all these years, you know, takes a while to adjust.  You're a tough cookie. I'm not worried about you. Take care of yourself, huh?
Yeah.
Thank you.
I'd love a drink, but we made plans, though.
Tomorrow.
I hate to break up the party. Catherine, you got a 4-19 in Seven Hills. I'll grab the kits and meet you outside.
You got an ID on the vic?
Any indication of sexual assault?
Got some shell casings.
It was close contact. He couldn't miss.
I wonder where Holly Pearson works.
Yeah. Bullets from both homicides are from the same gun.
Well, let's call PD and bring him in.
A hand in the desert is worth two in the bush.
Okay, 'Grissom'. Come on. What are we doing here? What are the odds that this hand is not being eaten right now by a coyote?
Torture chamber?
I do.
You think the hand is in that pile?
Whoo!
Whew! The smell's coming from these plants.
'Amorphophallus titanum, corpse flower.' Now who's going to have a plant that smells like decomposing flesh?
You smell a warrant?
I'm in if you're in.
... unless we got the warrant to open it.
That's funny. You don't strike me as the delayed gratification type.
Right. There are some freaky-looking plants in here.
Well, if this is where they genetically modify the plants, there's got to be a house around here somewhere.
'Jacob Wolfowitz.'
Yeah.
We can hear you, sir. Just open the door.

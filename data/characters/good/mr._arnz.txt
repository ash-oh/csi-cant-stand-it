I wake up in the middle of the night sometimes, if I get cold. Vanessa steals the covers. Uh, I woke up and my head was spinning. I think I'm coming down with something. Then I look over at her ...
Vanessa.
Tell them my wife isn't breathing.
No, I don't remember hanging up the phone. I must've passed out. Next thing I know the paramedics are taking me out.
Wait a minute. What about my boy?
Peter? The boxes won't unload themselves.
Peter and I were hoping to get back into the house tonight.
Well ... Vanessa was having trouble sleeping.
Are you accusing me of something?
Look, uh ... ever since this discount chain opened a branch down the block, I've been working 16-hour days just trying to survive. And I'd go home and Vanessa would come at me.
She'd just go on and on and on talking. And when she'd finally let me get to sleep, she'd want what every woman wants. I-I don't mean just s*x. She'd want to talk and talk.  Next thing you know, it's 5:00 A.M., The alarm is screaming at me, and I got to go back to work.
Yeah. I put it in her ice cream. I know it was wrong, but ...
Yeah. Happened as an accident the first time. See, I got a problem swallowing pills, so I crush them up in the ice cream. One night, she grabbed the wrong bowl and was out like a light. Best night's sleep I'd had in a long time. Well, if you ... you got nothing else you want to ask, I got things I got to do.
Oh, uh, about three weeks. Doctor's orders. I got high blood pressure.
Why, did this have something to do with my wife's death? I mean, I asked Peter if he'd ...  is this my fault?

Come here, tough guy.
You mean like strategy? Chalk talk?
You're talking about those idiots from UNLV.
Dude, I don't even know those guys, okay? They came in, they tried to be funny, and we set them straight.
Gave them a little talking to.
Did that punk bitch rat us out? It was harmless. It was nothing.
What?
I didn't do anything. Hey, that guy left before we did, and he was fine. He was still running his mouth.
Yeah, they'll testify to that. Look, you can ask anybody who was in there.
The SMU sharks.
You want to borrow my ring?
Okay. Take it. I didn't do anything.
Come on!
Come on. Come on! WAYNE: Come on! FRIENDS: Forget it, man.
You got to be kidding me.
Look, I told you, that guy walked away.

This guy thinks it's some kind of joke using a voice like that.
You guys have listened to that tape like, twenty times. Will somebody please go out and find my wife?
I don't hear anything.
How'd you hear all that?
Uh, detective, wait. What are my chances here ... of-of Laura ... f-for Laura?
Will somebody just tell me the truth?
Then you guys have got to move.
Shady friends? No. Laura surrounds herself with quality people-- people of real substance.
No, no, no, nothing like that. 
She's a health nut -- we both are.
Look, I'm a rich man. How do we let this guy know I'll pay?
Are you ordering me not to pay the ransom?
After you told me she could already be dead? I don't believe you guys. This is my wife. I'm paying the ransom.
Does anyone on your team know where Laura is right now?
Yeah? Something tells me I'll see her before you do.
She's been through enough. Can we cut this short?
Come on, Grissom, you have the guy. Isn't that enough?
Okay, all right.
I believe my wife.
Laura?
Yeah.
You're my whole life.

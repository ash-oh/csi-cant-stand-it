Are you here about my husband? That happened over thirty years ago.
My child was only ten years old. So brave to testify against those men. But it didn't matter. The Judge ruled it a suicide and those men went free.
I always set an extra place for Paul.
My husband. My way of being together.
Those are from his best years. He started a company out in Hollywood in the 1930s.
Movie makeup. He used himself as a model. 
He made hand molds and masks, everything. Like a one-man company. 
Last door down the hall.
I kept only what's most sentimental.
Our child made it.
My husband used his own hand to imprint the center.
I was often curious about that.
What are you doing in my daughter's room?
She died.
A long time ago. A lifetime ago.
I think it's time for you to go now.
Please?
Pauline went away and came back a very strange man. 
And I wouldn't let him stay here -- not like that.

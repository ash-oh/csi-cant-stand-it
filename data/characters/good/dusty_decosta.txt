Let me in, I am his mother. 
I know, baby, I know. This is really hard. It's okay to be upset, okay. 
What's on your finger ...  Did you fingerprint my son?
Is he a suspect?
Sleeping with his father does not make her his mother, okay. I'm his mother.
I was taking a walk.
No.
Come on. Let's go.
Oh. Hi. Listen, you're going to have to follow me 'cause I'm late for a client.
What is it you want?
Oh, God. So I'm a suspect now? That's precious. Okay. The man makes a mint off of singing about our s*x life, barely offers a relationship to our son, kicks me out of a house we built together, leaves me with nothing, and now you want to put me in jail? Rich. Really rich.
What does that matter to me? Do I get royalty checks for being his muse.
I do.  It's just embarrassing to me. The 'new' Mrs. Delancy called a meeting. She tells me about the Olympia offer. Izzy's being difficult about the deal, so would I talk to him because he listens to me still.
Had he started sleeping with the nanny yet?
Did Madeline tell you that was her old job?
Look, I'd like to pin it on her, I really would, but I can't because I was with her at the Espresso Drop all afternoon. I really have to go.
Oh, those are Sven's. Some mothers get sport trophies; I get perfectly rendered skyscrapers. He wants to be an urban planner. He's kind of obsessed with models. You guys let yourself out, okay?
So, you're telling me that this could keep him out of jail?

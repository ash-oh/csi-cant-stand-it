No.
What? I don't know.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. I just have a headache.
Mom, no!  Look ... a couple of us went out for burgers and then I came home. Megan was supposed to call me on my cell ... and I was going to go downstairs and let her in.
No.
I thought it was just an overtime make-out session. I fell asleep. And now I'm here.
Hi, guys, this is Sheila. Guess you missed me, but if you leave me a message, I'll get you back.
Hi, guys, this is Sheila.
This is going up on YouTube.
Here! Here! 
Come on and get it Ryan! This what you want?  Huh? Ah, ah, ah. Ah, ah...
Jerk!
Ryan? Ryan!
Come on.
Shut up and just pull. We don't have time to think about that.
Look, let's just get him in the van. I'll drive; you follow.
Move. Move!

What's this about?
It's been like that forever.
My husband didn't do anything. Why are you harassing him?
That's right. He got a better job in Reno. Jason wasn't even in Vegas when Fay disappeared.
You still love her?
Yes. 
That's what I killed her with.
Jason was in Reno. I came here to tell Fay that we would be together again one day.
Do you know he was engaged to me when he met her?
Where are you going? FAY GREEN: Stop it!
There was blood ... everywhere. No one else could see it ... but I knew it was there. A dead body is so heavy.
I'm sorry.
But you arrested my husband.

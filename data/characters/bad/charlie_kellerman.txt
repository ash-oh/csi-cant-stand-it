Hospital food.
The best I could do. Any word?
You know Megan. She's a fighter. She'll pull through this.
Thank you.
We live next door to each other. I drive her to school every day, home after cheerleading practice.
No, I'm, I'm on the squad.
Cute girls, short skirts.
I don't usually see her after Friday night games. She catches a ride home with Ryan.
The only person who was ever rude to Megan was Ryan.
Ryan was a dog. And the only person that wouldn't believe that was Megan.
I don't know.
No. No, no, that's not what happened.
Okay. You're right. It started as a prank. Sheila and I wrote out that speech. Sheila brought her camera. We went down to the field house. We knew they'd be there fooling around.
Shut up!
Shut up!
We tied him up. We got him to read the speech. We were just gonna post it on YouTube.
He got loose, came tearing after us.
He's coming. He's coming. RYAN LANSCO: You two.
What the heck, man?
Next thing I know, blood was just gushing out of his neck. 
I haven't slept. I haven't eaten. I can't stop playing it over and over again in my head.  He just went down so fast. And-and I was looking at him. And it-it was like he wasn't Ryan anymore. Whatever made him Ryan was gone.
This is where I suck. We should have just called 911, but we panicked.
What are you doing? 
I just told you everything I know. We left him in the van.
The second we barged into that field house, she freaked out and took off. I-I didn't even know she was in the hospital until her parents called.
Uh-uh.
I-I was holding the light and the cue card.
It was just Sheila and me.
And now, it's just me.

Excuse me, ma'am.
I'm the neighbor from across the way and I just saw a cop car leave. Is everything okay?
Oh, okay.
Excuse me, miss.
Don't move.
Throw the gun down! 
All right now, yank the phone out of the wall. I'm taking my prints with me.
Hello.
Who's this? I just dialed my own damn beeper.
It ain't your beeper, girl. It's mine. 
I do a lot of business on that beeper.
You know -- slinging a little something-something.
So what you know about some bling-bling?
It's on. Three Aces Motel, Room 202.
See you soon.
That was you on the phone?
Don't move!

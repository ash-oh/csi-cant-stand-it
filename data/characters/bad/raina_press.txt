It's Tessa. I don't understand. How could this ... ? My baby.
She's beautiful, isn't she?
Couple nights a week, she'd sleep at her friend Carrie's. There's just the two of us. I'm a waitress. Work nights. That way I can ... make her breakfast and be there when she gets home from school.
Yesterday morning. I got home around 6:00. We made pancakes. I packed her lunch and kissed her good-bye. When she didn't come home from school, I just figured she was at Carrie's. I should have called, but I didn't want to be a nag. I want to see her.
Hi. I just left you a message. Any news? Honey, these guys are from the crime lab.  Justin Mack, my boyfriend.
How can you be sure it was Justin's truck?
Uh ... few months. Hired him to lay sod. Now we're in the midst of an outdoor overhaul.
L.A., maybe. I don't know. I haven't heard from him since the divorce. He'll find a way to blame me for this. 
Sure. He's over here all the time. He's a good man. He wouldn't hurt anybody, especially not Tessa.  Damn, I keep expecting her to walk through that door.
Justin wears work gloves.
You wouldn't understand.
I bought Tessa a bus pass, and that little slut still gets my guy to pick her up after school.
Shut up! We all know why. 
She was trying to steal him from me.
What the hell were you doing with him?
You think you got him wrapped around your little finger?
Were you nice back?
You don't talk to me like that, you little bitch.
Where the hell do you think you're going?  I've given you everything. 
Justin was the best thing in my life.
You didn't know her.

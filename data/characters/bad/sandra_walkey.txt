Are you sure I can't get you something?
You're welcome, baby.
What's going on in there? Kenli had nothing to do with this.
Well, of course. I was with her.
I don't need an attorney. I've done nothing wrong.
First you go after Kenli, now me. A few hours ago, you guys were saying there was gunshot powder on Kenli's blouse. You make a mistake?
Joey ... is ... better off ... without me.
Sign it. Sign it!
You have a wild imagination, Ms. Willows.
Arnold. He passed away. Two years ago, May.
You can tell that from his photo?
Why are we talking about Arnie?
Are you going to put me in jail?
And the baby -- he goes with Kenli, right?
Then it was all worth it. My baby has her baby. That's all that really matters.
We each protect our own. That's how it's done.

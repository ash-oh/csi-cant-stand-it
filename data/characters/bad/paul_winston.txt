Hey, that's my car. Look, what the hell is going on? Hey, that's my car. What are they doing? Did somebody break in to my car?
Oh, god! Joshua!
I was supposed to drop Joshua off at Day Care. My wife usually brings him on the way to work. It was a hectic morning. My cell phone was going off. Problems at the office.
Look, I don't care how much pressure we get from the finance here. Will you hold on a second, I have another call.
Yeah, sorry, I can't do this right now. I'm driving. Hold all the calls. Tell them, they have to wait.
I forgot he was in the backseat.
I'm not the one who drives him. Vicky does that.
I was distracted. My job consumes so much of my mind.
I'm an agent for the Gaming Commission. It's a twenty-five hour a day job, eight days a week.
She works as much as me. Joshua made it all worth while.
She's in L.A. on business. How am I going to tell her?
I'm guilty. I'm not a bad parent; I was negligent. I take full responsibility for what I did, but leave Howard out of it.
Vicky and I went through hell watching Howard deteriorate. Can't you let my boy rest in peace?
Yes, he was. We had a fight...
Vicky, it's your turn. I've had him for the past four hours.
Look, if you're not gardening here, then it's at work. I've had him all day. It's your turn. Here. 
Thank you.
We had the test before he was born. Dr. Garner said we were fine.
We'll wait for the enzyme tests.
We couldn't go through that again.

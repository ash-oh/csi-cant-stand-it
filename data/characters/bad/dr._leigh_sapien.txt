We were in the middle of a session.
Psychiatrist.
Doctor-Patient privilege.
No need. Dylan suffered from Reactive Attachment Disorder. He was with his mother and I've been treating him for sixteen months.
I see my patients whenever they need me. On weekends, at night. At the office or here ...
Dylan had an argument with his mother. He needed to unload. 
He was complaining about his curfew blaming his mother for problems at school. Suddenly, he began to convulse. I tried to stabilize his head. I thought it was grand mal seizure. Dylan was an epileptic. He hit his head. And when the convulsions stopped he was dead.
Of course, standard CPR. Cleared his airway, worked his chest.
He was diagnosed with epilepsy at age 3.
What are you doing?
Look, I dialed 9-1-1. I'm not hiding anything.
Angora fibers? What does that have to do with anything?
Excuse me. I don't appreciate being treated like a suspect.
Do you consider me a suspect? Because that's how I'm feeling.
Fine. Don't answer me. It's your choice.
Were you and Dylan under it?
Look, I don't know the basis of your allegations but I have never crossed the line with a patient.
'Rap sheet'?
I was a resident. He was 17. We were in ... look, no criminal charges were filed. It should have been expunged from my record.
Lady, I'm not a saint but I am not a killer or a child molester. Dylan Buckley was an epileptic. He had a seizure. He hit his head. That's the truth. You don't like it, you can leave.
It's called Re-Birthing.
It's a technique used to treat extreme behavioral disorders. Idea is to turn back the clock. Wipe the slate clean. Allow the child to re-bond with his mother.
It represents the birth canal.
Rebirthing may not be a recognized therapeutic procedure, but it's not illegal.
All other methods of therapy had failed. Dylan was becoming more belligerent, withdrawn, even dangerous.
Dylan was a willing participant.
I instructed Dylan to lie down on the floor. In a fetal position. As part of the process ... 
... I asked him if he wanted to be reborn to his mother. He said yes.
Now we're going to close the womb. And twist it.
It's time to be reborn. That's it, Dylan. Push harder, push harder! Harder ...
Push hard.
Do you want to be reborn or stay in there and die?
No, this is what happens. We can't stop now. Trust me. This is the normal response.
That's right. 
Come on. Push harder.
Push harder!  That's it.
When we opened the blanket, his eyes were closed. I thought he was pretending to be asleep.

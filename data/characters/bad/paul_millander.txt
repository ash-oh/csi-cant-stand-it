A staged suicide?. You're kidding, right? I swear on my kids I've never seen that man before in my life.
Sure.
No, why?
Well, yeah. Yeah, sure. At-at my job.
Yes, sir, everything from scratch. We mold, carve, shape, paint and authenticate.
Thanks.
Sure, we do, uh ... 
This is our best seller right here. Sold 10,000 of those units last Halloween. Even used my own hand for the mold.
Yeah, why? What does that mean?
It's not where I'm headed.
I-I-I call it 'good versus evil.'
Can't be too safe out there, can we, Mr. Grissom?
Hungry?

Dear. As a Judge, I don't want the outside world privy to my private life because they'll use it against me.

I am ... comfortable sharing this with you. My, uh ... my mother wouldn't hear it. Against her wishes, I cut off my hair. Started wearing big shirts. Big boots. If I got tough enough ... no one would ever hurt me. I went to the clinic ... and became a man.

Aren't you wondering about your birthday? August 17, 1956.
Why I didn't kill you, since you were next?
I've already picked my next victim, if you're curious.
My name is Paul Millander. I reside at 13891 Sand Creek Road. I'm 46 years of age and I'm going to kill myself. I'd like to say 'I love you' to my mother, Isabelle. 
I'm so sorry. I never wanted to put you through this. I just can't do it anymore. I've lost hope.

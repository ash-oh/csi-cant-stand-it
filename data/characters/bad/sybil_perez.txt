I'm fine. What's taking Alicia so long? We have a doctor's appointment in forty minutes.
Well, she has to be. I saw her leave for school this morning.
April, get off the phone. I can't talk right now.
What did you do?!  What the hell did you do?!
Where is she?!
Where is she?!
Get off of me! SYBIL PEREZ: Go find my daughter! Go find my daughter!
Oh, a nosebleed.
You think we had something to do with it? Our daughter is missing. She's out there somewhere alone and scared. What are you doing about that?!
Fine. Here! 
Take it! Go find her!
I do it.
There wasn't any after school stuff. Alicia isn't a joiner. She walks to school, I pick her up. That's it.
Because she wasn't welcome. We kicked her out. 
Serious illness takes a toll on a family.  She's used to the doctors. She has friends there -- people who understand -- go through the same hell.
It's all right, it's okay, sweetheart.
Excuse me. 
Um ... what happens to April now?
Do you know how much...?
She's my daughter. 
I can't leave her in jail.
This is my fault. I ... I was never there for her. I ...
I spent all my energy getting Daniel to the next ... thing -- the next pill, the next treatment, the next remission, hoping that this time ... 
You have no idea what it's like.
So you would let your child die and do nothing. Never. No, you'd talk to doctors and research. And then you'd find out that the national bone marrow registry can't help you 'cause your son is mixed race. And even if he wasn't, there aren't enough donors. Out of four million, only 205,000 are Latino. I did what I had to do.
I don't expect you to understand. You don't have kids.
So, what kind of mother are you? When do you see her? You work nights. You probably don't even know where she half the time. Alicia's life may not have been simple, but at least I knew her. Can you say the same?
He's at church. Why?
You don't have any proof I killed my daughter. 
Innocent? You trying to make me believe you really give a damn about a pedophile? Please.
So?
That's ridiculous.
Alicia got angry, sometimes. Just sick of it. We all did. But she'd have been devastated if Daniel had died and she did nothing to prevent it. She loved her brother.
Alicia? Time for your pills.
Wait. We have to do this right.
Oh my god! Please...
They'll put him in prison.

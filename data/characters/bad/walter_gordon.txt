Hi, CSI guy. You wondering why you're here? Because you followed the evidence. Because that's what CSIs do. So breathe quick, breathe slow, put your gun in your mouth and pull the trigger. Any way you like, you're going to die here. Okay.
Through the door.
Pretty quiet outside. Almost sounds like you came alone.
Put it down. 
Slide it over. 
You're telling me there's a million dollars in here.
Along with some cute little booby traps? Which is it -- a tracer, a dye pack?
This looks real.
You know, I was under the impression it was against departmental policy to negotiate with terrorists.
Depends. 
Are you terrified?
Oh, so ... he is 'your guy', huh?
Are you two close?
What does Nick Stokes mean to you? How do you feel when you see him in that coffin? Does your soul die every time you push that button? How do you feel, knowing that there's nothing you can do to get him out of that hell? Helpless ... useless ... impotent?
Good. Welcome to my world.
Uh, if I were you, I'd back up a little.

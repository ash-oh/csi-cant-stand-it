Yeah.
Sure. That'd be okay.
No. No, I'm very good. And I have exceptional attention to detail.
No. More like memory. I can see a room one time and remember where everything is.
Uh-huh.
There's a lavender orchid on the reception desk. It's top bloom is about to open. A glass coffee cup with a chip on the edge, a half inch of coffee still in the cup. Cut glass bowl full of chocolate kisses -- two gold, one purple. A glass vase with a rose etched in the glass, three leaves etched on its stalk.
I need to order a special part.
You didn't. 
Yes.
Yes ... that smell ...
Yes.
Your special girl?
I promise.
Sara?
I didn't kill her.
This is about her. Her, her, her! It's always about her!
It's always about her.

Can I help you?
Yes. 'Doctor' Hillridge.
Yes. Simba.
Oh, no. Not again.
What makes you think that Simba had anything to do with that jogger's death?
Oh, I get it now. You're talking about my old dog, Dickie. He was aggressive. That's why I put him down. Simba just gets out of the yard a lot.
Okay, he is missing a tooth. But he just gets out and wrestles with neighbors' garbage cans. He's not a violent dog.
You're making a mistake.
Nutrition. My patients are mostly professional athletes.
You mean like that jogger? What was his name?
Doesn't ring a bell. And I'm very good with names, Mr. Grissom. You'll let me know when I can pick up Simba.
So are you.
I have a patient coming in exactly twenty minutes so if you want to rifle around until then, fine but I will not leave my place of business.
You're very organized, Dr. Hillridge. I imagine you're upset about your dog -- having to put him down if it comes to that.
I don't hold onto things. I accept the evolution of change. We live, we die, we replenish the earth.
None of us gets out alive. I would think, in your job, you'd know that. 
But if we treat our bodies like a temple we can cheat time. 
Your eyes ... 
The lower rims are pale. You're deficient in folic acid. You're not eating your beets. Two beets have 54% percent of the RDA.
Will that help with your investigation?
No. I was in the CIA. Culinary Institute of America.
Tell me, Mr. Grissom, how does a man choose death as his profession?
Will, I guess one man's corpse is another man's candy.  Care for a sip? It's full of folacin.
Edwin. You look great today. How did the race go?
You can do better.
Hi. I have folic acid. I was worried about your eyes. 
I assume my surgical instruments came back clean, or relatively clean.
Actually, my house felt a little crowded -- all those men you sent.
But you dictated the scope of the warrant. They're taking everything from my kitchen and office.
And? What else do you know about me?
Is it a crime to like the mountains?
What?
You disappoint me. I thought you were smarter than that. Coenzyme q-10 could help with mental acuity. 
'The last act is bloody, however, fine the rest of the play.'
One request. Ask them not to leave my house a mess. You know how I like order.
Mr. Grissom. You're looking grim. I'm afraid I don't have a supplement for that.
It had to happen eventually.
You're the scientist. I should have thought you'd figured that out.
Think of the bugs, Grissom. Cycle of life. Angels versus insects. When we die the fable we tell ourselves is we go toward a white light and angels. But you and I both know the hard reality is that insects arrive immediately and begin turning us back to earth.
No. But they'd die if they didn't have bodies to feed off of. And so will I. 
Porphyria.
Or the Legend of the Vampire. Which makes it a real hard disease to have. But it's real for me.
The only thing my father ever gave me. The first time it presented was after a minor sunburn. My lips receded -- so did my gums. I increased my glucose intake and I was fine ... for a while. I began a drug regimen but they only treated the symptoms. I had my spleen removed because it absorbed my blood. But nothing helped. Lesions started forming on my face. That's when I bought my first dog. Bullets and poison leave residue in the blood. Dogs kill clean. Imagine what I'd look like by now without them.
Human blood is the richest source of heme.
If you lock me up, I'll go mad.
I'll die in prison.
You have one more question. How could I consume raw organs? Not morally -- aesthetically. I dried them and ground them into powder.
You want an empirical experience? There's a fresh shake in my fridge.

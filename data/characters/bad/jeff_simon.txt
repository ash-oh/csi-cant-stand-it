Yeah.
Before the restraining order kicked in.
This is just a big misunderstanding, officer.
What did Alice say I did now?
I don't get a break for another half hour.
You can look anywhere you want. Just give Alice a message for me. I love her, and I want her back.
What the ... I swear, I haven't been ... I haven't been anywhere near her since her brother broke us up.
I didn't kill Alice. I loved her.
I wasn't stalking her. I wo-worried about her.
Let me tell you about Alice. She ... liked to party ...
... barely ate, hardly slept, ... 
... didn't want to admit she had a drinking problem.
She needed me to look out for her.
I'm telling you, Alice got into a Chrysler or... a Buick? It was blue, maybe black. And the guy she was with, maniac driver. Complete moron.
I had to. But I was pulled over by the cops. They kept me on-on the side of the road for over an hour.
It was around 2:00. It was a buck-fifty ticket. I'm innocent.
Lady, until we broke up, we spent every waking minute together. She'd come over to my shop on her lunch break just to get some.
She worked around cars, too. I'm telling you, I'm innocent!
I only did one thing wrong. I didn't protect her from that guy.
Sleazy b*st*rd. Slight build, dark hair. I think he had a leather jacket.
We've been through this. I have an alibi.
No. I don't even know an Adam Novak.
I didn't know whose car it was.
Maybe somebody's trying to frame me.

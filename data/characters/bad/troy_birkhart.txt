Hey.
Thank you.
I'm Troy.
Excuse me, Miss, but we're having a private conversation here.
I think you owe her an apology.
Hey, hey! Hey!
Hold-hold-hold on! 
Hey! Tiffany! 
Tiffany, come on! 
Stay back!
I killed somebody!
I'm just ... I'm just doing the right thing. Making sure you know it was me. And I'll pay for what I did. Eye for an eye, man.
Stay back! I'll do it, I swear! I'll do it, I swear!
That Ricky. Thought he owned her.
He wouldn't let her come.

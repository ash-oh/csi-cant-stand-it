What does that one do?
To help people burning inside?
But not my sister.
It's okay.
Watch tv, hang out, play.
Sometimes.
Fire is cool.
Only when I got woken up.
I got a little bit hungry.
Purple jelly.
No. Mom uses it for the chocolate pot on our birthdays.
Yeah ... except stupid grandma isn't allowed to have chocolate, so we couldn't do it this year.
Ever since grandma moved in, we can't do anything fun.
I played for a while.
I went to bed ...  ... and then the firemen came and rescued us.
Yeah. They're so nice. They talked to me and showed me all their cool stuff. This one named George -- he said maybe someday I can meet his dog.
I hear it all the time. My grandma says it. 
My mom says it. 
And my sister says it. 
Well... she used to say it.

Chuck brought the weed, not me. This guy told him it was a really great high.
When Chuck and I went to the field ... we were hooking up ...
... behind Mandy's back. 
She showed up -- she was like, 'He's my player.'
I don't know what happened. I started to feel weird like my blood was surging through me.
It didn't make any sense I think I wanted to be her.
It felt ... it felt like somebody else walked over and did it. Like she was split from my body.
It's like out of a really bad dream.
What's going to happen to me?

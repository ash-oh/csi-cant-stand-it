I asked my husband to do one thing. One thing. I got up early, I fed Joshua, I got him changed, dressed. All he had to do was drop him off.
I had business in Anaheim. I'm in Horticulture. My company is designing a garden for a new hotel.
I drove my car.
Of course, it's the law. I put it in Paul's car before I left.
He had a slight cough. There was a bug going around in day care.
Cough syrup. Last night.
There's a rule in our house that only one parent medicates a child. But, I told Paul to go ahead and give it to Joshua if he was still coughing. Why?
What is wrong with you? How could you leave him in the car? What is wrong with you?
How dare you bring up Howard. I'm a mother in mourning. I've already buried one child. I have to bury another. One was in god's hands, the other in the incapable hands of my husband. Show some compassion. I'm not the guilty one here!
I was in the garden this weekend. Why are you so interested in everything we do? I mean, when did our lives become an open book?
No.
What, are you counting hours now? He's your son.
See the pretty flowers, Joshua?
I guess he was. But the moment he passed Joshua off to me I went inside.
Honestly, I don't remember. I'm in the garden a lot, so I'm sure I washed my hands.
No, Paul. I went through hell with Howard, I can't go through that with Joshua.
No. No more tests. No more drugs. No more kids. No more! I can't live through that again, and neither can you.
You have no idea what it's like to watch your child die.

Diane Kentner. I took these photographs of Megan and Ryan.
Yeah, I teach photography.
Thanks. That's Charlie Kellerman. I try to take pictures of what the kids are passionate about.
Yeah. That and Megan. Charlie's in love with her. She's in love with Ryan. Ryan's in love with his future. Ah, high school.
No. I mean, if a day goes by that a teenage girl doesn't cry in my class, it's a rarity. But yesterday, it wasn't Megan. And Ryan's head was already in the game. He's got a lot of pressure on him. He's oldest of six. His parents are already counting the money that he's gonna make from his first NBA contract.
We have a couple of junky ones. Students usually bring their own.
Well, I'm old school. I mean, I took these with a Hasselblaad, but ... otherwise, I use a Minolta I've had forever. Why?
Yeah, he wanted copies of the photos the photography club had taken.
Yeah, I put it on the syllabus. You can have it if you want.
Yeah, along with hundreds of thousands of other Americans.
Get a warrant and you can.
Well ... Ryan helped me move an enlarger I got for the photo lab for the school. My Saab wasn't big enough to move it.
Wow. If you're under 40 years old and you teach teenage boys, they all want to make you Mrs. Robinson. It's flattering, but it's fantasy.
I would never take advantage of a student.

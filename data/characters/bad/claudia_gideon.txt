Excuse me ... I'm Claudia Gideon, Bob Fairmont's secretary. I came to pick up his property.
Oh, fine. I was just doing my job.
I was out sick that day.
Is that really proper etiquette?
Where did you say you worked?
I was not, no.
You don't know what you're talking about.
Okay, Mr. Fairmont told me earlier that day to meet him in his hotel room at 9:00 to pick up some papers, okay? When I got there, he was in bed -- naked,
... unconscious.
He always told me reputation before health -- no scandals. I dragged him to the elevator.
I don't know.
Sure, go ahead.
I didn't shoot him.
I'm on call 24 hours a day, okay? Mr. Fairmont beeped me. I drove out to the house, and I took him in.
You'd have to ask her.
That's mine.
I don't know.
Maybe I pied it up at the pharmacy on lunch and put it there. I don't know.
I did not poison him.
I haven't done anything.
Poison? I'm the one who looked out for him.
Who made all of his dental appointments, huh? His haircuts? Who got his taxes in on time?
Why did he need mistresses?
I don't know how it happened. Maybe she poisoned herself.
Why would she hide my shampoo in my office?
Well, it wasn't her husband. He was already dead. She's trying to frame me for killing him.
She had his gold fillings removed. Doesn't that tell you something about her?
I had to wash his grungy coffee mug every night. I had to clean his toenail clippings off of his desktop. Why would I ever ask Bob Fairmont to leave anyone for me?
He always said she was crazy.
Then I hope she talks soon.

The cops won't tell us. What are the chances of finding our daughter?
That's what everyone keeps saying. No one will tell us anything.
Why?
A gardener and a pool man come in once a week.
Years.
We don't know. We ... we just found out ourselves.
April's a troubled girl. Problems with drugs, the police. You might as well know, she also did some time. Juvenile lockup.
Heroin possession. Intent to distribute.
Our daughter isn't sick. Our son's kidneys are failing. Alicia is his matching donor. Without her, he'd die.
What's going on?
I had to protect my family.
Guilty.
We have to call the police.

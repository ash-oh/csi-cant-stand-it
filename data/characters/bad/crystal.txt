No.
It wasn't my 'E.'
Ken Willard asked me to bring a bag back from L.A. For him. I didn't know what was in it.
We dated.
Manny didn't do anything. He's only tried to help me. The guy said he could solve my problem for ten grand. When the job was done, he said the price had doubled. I couldn't afford that ... and I didn't want to get Manny involved. So I stole the gun from his office.
I kept it in the bathroom overnight ...
... waited till that son of a bitch showed up, picked my moment.
Second I get arrested, Ken dumps me. He says he'll kill me if I roll over on him. The way I saw it, I had two choices: Either kill him or go to jail.

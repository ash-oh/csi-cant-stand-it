I knew something was wrong. Trip lived for basketball, and it was the semis, so there's no way he'd miss a game.
Trip, are you in there? Open up. If you can hear me, open the door. Please?
Yeah, Trip missed a game. I thought something's wrong.
I was his R.A. The guy lived for basketball, beer and girls. Didn't want much to do with dorm activities.
No.
He wrote that down?
We had s*x, I admit it. No big deal. I didn't tell you guys because I'm not exactly proud of it, okay?
This is crazy.
My thesis is on metallurgy. I use dry ice to test the physical constrains of certain metals.
I was an idiot. I had been consulting my female advisees not to take that kind of crap.
I didn't know Paula was there, and I never meant to kill Trip.
No, no, look. Trip's room is 16 feet by nine feet. I used exactly the right amount of ice just to make him sick. If he had been in the bed three feet above the ground and not on the floor ... I just wanted him to miss his basketball game. Trip only slept on the floor when he had girls over, and he never had s*x before a big game. He shouldn't have been on the floor.

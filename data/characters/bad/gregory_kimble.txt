I just can't believe it. I've been with Mr. Carson for years.
Nothing like that. I was his driver. I take it you got my fingerprints from my work card?
I was also Mr. Carson's dresser.
In the 19th century, a dresser's job was to help gentleman soldiers with their equipment.
If you're asking, did I lace his corset, of course. Every morning.
Absolutely. But he controlled the pain.
Yesterday morning. 
No. At a duel.
Gettysburg.
Guns at the ready and ... 
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
Please be careful. That's a very expensive piece. 
I don't understand why I'm here again. It's not a crime to lose your hair.
It was an accident.
I suppose mostly the part when I shot him. I could see the insanity in his eyes.
Mr. Carson, you shot him! You really shot him!
Don't shoot.
Please!
He was really going to kill that man.
I couldn't let him be found like that. His corseting was private.
His great-great-great grandfather died trying to stop a Yankee train from entering Virginia. Legend has it he stood square on the tracks firing at the engineer until the train ran him down. Mr. Carson spoke of it frequently. He said it was an honorable death. I was just trying to give him the same.

Two hours to drive 75 miles. You guys got lost.
Yeah, but I am. Body's behind the counter. Dustin Bale -- store clerk. Bullet through the chest. The register's empty.
Fourteen years as a state trooper. I know how to secure a crime scene without contaminating the evidence.
It's okay. Look, I cover 97.5 square miles. I got to book.
You're accusing me of murder?
I'm a state trooper.
Drop the weapon.
This isn't going to do it.
What are you doing?
No. I'm east of the mine.
More than I'd make in a lifetime.
You wouldn't understand.
Look -- I was never 'that' guy. You know, that guy that wins the jackpots gets promoted, catches the breaks? It was right there.

<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LOS ANGELES CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[HOLLYWOOD STREET SIGN]</p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO:</p>
<p>[EXT. VARIOUS HOLLYWOOD (STREET) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Various shots of prostitutes walking the street in front of various establishments.) </p>
<p><strong>Dakota</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p>&quot;JERSEY&quot; (ELLIE): Hey. You get anything?</p>
<p><strong>Dakota</strong>: No.</p>
<p>(A car pulls up alongside them.) </p>
<p>&quot;DAKOTA&quot;: My, uh, knight in shining German armor has arrived.</p>
<p>&quot;JERSEY&quot; (ELLIE): See if he has room for two.</p>
<p>(Dakota sighs. They lock pinkies as Dakota heads for the car.)</p>
<p>&quot;JERSEY&quot; (ELLIE): Careful.</p>
<p>(Dakota leans over the curb and looks into the car.) </p>
<p><strong>Dakota</strong>: Hey. You wanna party?</p>
<p>(Dakota looks back at &quot;Jersey&quot;. Dakota gets into the car and closes the door. She waves back at &quot;Jersey&quot;.) </p>
<p>(&quot;Jersey&quot; signals for Dakota to give her a call. The car drives away.) </p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - DESK - MORNING]</p>
<p>(&quot;Jersey&quot; is at the police station. The officer at the desk isn't too interested in what she's saying.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: It's only been a few hours. </p>
<p>&quot;JERSEY&quot; (ELLIE): Dakota always calls me. We have a system. Something is wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Why don't you go home, Jersey? Eat something for once, get some sleep.</p>
<p>(Disgusted, &quot;Jersey&quot; turns to leave. With a last look at the officer, she slaps her hand on the counter in frustration, then leaves.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY]</p>
<p>(Walking along the sidewalk, &quot;Jersey&quot; takes out her cell phone and dials.)</p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[INT. (LAS VEGAS) POLICE DEPARTMENT - BRASS' OFFICE - DAY]</p>
<p>(Brass is working when his phone rings. He puts the pen down and answers it.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (to phone) Hello.</p>
<p><strong>Ellie Brass</strong>: Hello, Dad?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Ellie. Are you okay?</p>
<p>SMASH CUT TO: END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Brass steps out of his office and looks both ways down the hallway. He sees the sheriff and heads over to him.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, hey, Sheriff. I'm glad I caught you.</p>
<p>(Brass stops in front of the sheriff.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Um ... I got to take some emergency leave. It's a ... it's a family matter.</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Burdick</strong>: I didn't know you had a family.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, you're new. We haven't had a chance to talk. Um ... I, uh, briefed my lieutenant on my cases. He'll cover for me for a couple of days.</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Burdick</strong>: This is not a good time for family problems. All the narco guys are at a HIDTA conference. I got no backup. I'm still learning the ropes here.</p>
<p>(Brass chuckles.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, it's never a good time to have a family problem, Sheriff. Look, I don't ask for time off normally. I'd appreciate the courtesy.</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Burdick</strong>: Do I have a choice here, Jim? </p>
<p>(The sheriff continues down the hallway.) </p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Burdick</strong>: (over his shoulder) Get back here as soon as you can.</p>
<p>(Brass watches the sheriff go.) </p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO:</p>
<p>[EXT. MIKE'S DINER (STOCK) -- DAY] </p>
<p>[INT. MIKE'S DINER - DAY] </p>
<p>(The waitress takes the money off the counter. Brass stands in front of the small counter-top display and picks up a cellophane-wrapped gift with a small pink bear near the ribbon tie on top.) </p>
<p>(Brass puts the small gift on the counter. He counts out the bills and pays the cashier.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[HIGHWAY]</p>
<p>(Top view down of the highway.) </p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - HIGHWAY - DAY]</p>
<p>[EXT. CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[EXT. POLICE DEPARTMENT BUILDING - DAY]</p>
<p>(Brass walks up to the front of the building.)</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - OFFICE - DAY]</p>
<p>(Brass and Annie Kramer hug.)</p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: You look good, Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You do, too, Annie.</p>
<p>(Annie Kramer goes to sit behind her desk.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: L.A. seems to agree with you.</p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: Oh, yeah, well, I couldn't take another Jersey winter.</p>
<p>(She sits down. Brass sits down across her desk.) </p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: Or another Jersey cop.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You stay in touch with the old crew?</p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: You know, dirty cops don't like to hang with clean ones.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So that's why they called me squeaky?</p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: I thought what you did took a lot of guts. Integrity is, um, hard to come by in vice.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, it's the only detail where you're told to drink, gamble and pick up hookers, all the while carrying a gun.</p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: Garden of Eden. Temptation kills you, or it compromises you.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, you got my message? My daughter Ellie and her friend Dakota were out partying and Dakota got in some guy's car. Ellie was able to pull a partial. Something about a whale tail.</p>
<p>(Brass hands Annie Kramer the notebook paper with:<br />
CA PLATE<br />
1TA )</p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: California Coastal Commission specialty plates. I'll run it through DMV. Cross reference with BMWs. In the meantime, I pulled Dakota's rap sheet.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: She has a sheet?</p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: They both do.</p>
<p>(Brass nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: She, uh, works a stretch on Hollywood Boulevard between Highland and Vine. </p>
<p>(She hands the file to Brass. He opens it and sees a photo of Dakota holding the ID numbers:<br />
POLICE DEPT<br />
4240 321 )</p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: When was the last time you saw Ellie, Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: About three years ago. Um, she got into some trouble in Vegas. Hanging around with a bad bunch.</p>
<p>(Brass looks at the rap sheet:<br />
REYNOLDS, SASHA<br />
DOB: 03/04/83 s*x/F RAC/C WGT/120 EYE/BRO<br />
AKA: 01 DAKOTA<br />
02: 188282811<br />
03: 199292939<br />
04: 399199292</p>
<p>KNOWN ASSOCIATES: BRASS, ELLIE<br />
AKA: JERSEY )</p>
<p>(Brass catches a glimpse of the name and looks away.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Looks like her taste in people hasn't changed much.</p>
<p>(He shuts the file. Annie hands Brass a slip of paper.) </p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: Here. Last known address. In case you don't have it.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. STREET -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Brass pulls up the front of a dingy apartment building. In the background, a dog barks. Brass gets out of the car and looks at the building. Graffiti litters the walls. He looks up and sees Ellie step up to the open window.) </p>
<p>(He reaches into the car and grabs his cell phone. We note the pink bear gift in the front seat. With his eye on the window, he makes the call.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Ellie, it's your dad.</p>
<p><strong>Ellie Brass</strong>: (to phone) How'd you get this number?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Relax, take it easy. I got it off caller I.D.</p>
<p><strong>Ellie Brass</strong>: (to phone) Oh, okay. So did you make the call?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah. LAPD's looking into it.</p>
<p><strong>Ellie Brass</strong>: (to phone) Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hey, how are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Ellie Brass</strong>: (to phone) Great, actually. Livin' at the beach, temping, waiting tables. Got some really good friends.</p>
<p>(As Brass watches, a man steps up to the window next to Ellie. He's smoking a pipe and offers it to her. She inhales. He also inhales.) </p>
<p><strong>Ellie Brass</strong>: (to phone) It's a big bowl of cherries.</p>
<p>(She smiles. The man puts his arm around her waist and lingers.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (to phone) Okay, um, I'll call you when I hear something, all right?</p>
<p>(Brass hangs up.) </p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO: </p>
<p>[EXT. (KOREATOWN) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Cops are parked around an area. Brass gets out of his car and meets with Annie Kramer.) </p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: Hey, Jim.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: We found the beemer. Found these two kids trying to hotwire it. Whale tail license plate starting with One-T-A.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Let's talk to them.</p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: I'll talk, you listen.</p>
<p>(Annie and Brass walk up to the two kids.) </p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: All right, what the hell's the matter with you? You looking to die young? 'Cause you can do it inside in lock-up or outside with this wanna-be gang banger stealing cars crap.</p>
<p><strong>Kid 1</strong>: We weren't stealing nothing. Window was already busted. Car wouldn't even start. We were just playing around.</p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: You like playing with cars, huh? LAPD's having a car wash fund-raiser on Saturday. You just signed yourselves up. You're welcome.</p>
<p>(She steps up and motions to the officer nearby.)</p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p>(The officer unlocks the kids' handcuffs.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, no Rudy Giuliani broken windows theory here, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: Jimmy, windows are already broken. Someone's got to fix 'em.</p>
<p>(They walk up to the BMW for a closer look. Brass notices a sticker on the broken windshield.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hey, check this out. B-H-G-C?</p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: Looks like a country club or something. Doesn't read like Koreatown. I'll have my guys run the plates.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Anybody checked the trunk?</p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p>(Brass opens the hood.) </p>
<p>(The spare tire is missing.) </p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: Doesn't look good for Ellie's friend.</p>
<p>(Annie takes out her cell phone and dials.) </p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[INT. LOBBY (HIDTA CONFERENCE) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Matt Glazer answers his phone.) </p>
<p><strong>Matt Glazer</strong>: (to phone) Glazer. Yeah, we're just finishing up. No traffic. I'll be there in about twenty minutes. Okay.</p>
<p>(He hangs up and taps Warrick on his shoulder.) </p>
<p><strong>Matt Glazer</strong>: Vegas?</p>
<p>(Warrick turns around.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>Matt Glazer</strong>: You know a Jim Brass?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. VARIOUS LOS ANGELES CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>[EXT. (KOREATOWN) -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Warrick and Matt Glazer arrive at the site.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Where he at? </p>
<p><strong>Matt Glazer</strong>: (points) (garbled) Over there.</p>
<p>(Warrick walks over to Brass.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Jim.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Rick. Rick, what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'm here for the HIDTA conference. Buddy of mine from L.A.P.D. told me there was a new captain in town, stirring things up. What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Ah, it's a long, sad story, man. </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Have anything to do with a feisty little blonde named Ellie?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: She's not a blonde anymore. Let's check out the car.</p>
<p>(Brass and Warrick head over to the car. Annie Kramer stands near the trunk. Brass makes the introductions.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Captain Annie Kramer, this is Warrick Brown from Las Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: Good to meet you.</p>
<p>(They shake hands.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Good to meet you.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Glazer</strong>: (to Brass) Matt Glazer, L.A.P.D. Crime lab.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hey, Jim Brass.</p>
<p>(They shake hands.) </p>
<p>(Warrick looks at the car.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, I thought L.A. was all about car culture. This reminds me of home.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Glazer</strong>: Trunk's been stripped clean.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Too clean.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Glazer</strong>: Oh, they missed a spot.</p>
<p>(Camera zooms in to the spot that was missed.) </p>
<p><strong>Matt Glazer</strong>: Looks like two large caliber bullet holes.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: But a bullet hole wouldn't make those markings. What is that?</p>
<p><strong>Matt Glazer</strong>: I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It looks like a tool marking.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: A crowbar-like tool is in the hole being jammed in and twisted around, leaving the area scratched up. End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Matt Glazer</strong>: Let's haul it back to impound and find out.</p>
<p>(Matt Glazer picks up his things and heads out. He looks at Annie Kramer.) </p>
<p><strong>Matt Glazer</strong>: I'll be in touch.</p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey, you know, uh, Jim, I'm here all weekend. If you need anything, don't hesitate to call. (to Annie) Pleasure meeting you.</p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: Same here.</p>
<p>(Warrick walks past Brass.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (to Brass) Remember, what happens in L.A., stays in L.A.</p>
<p>(Warrick leaves. Brass looks at Annie.) </p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: You still a scotch man?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'll take a rain check, okay. </p>
<p>(He smiles and winks at her. Brass turns and walks away.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. HOLLYWOOD (STREET) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(A car pulls up to the curb. Ellie gets out; the car leaves. She starts walking along the sidewalk.)</p>
<p>(Another car pulls up to the curb. She walks up to the car and knocks on the glass.)</p>
<p><strong>Ellie Brass</strong>: Hey, baby, you want to party?</p>
<p>(Brass rolls down the window. Ellie looks at her dad.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Ellie ...</p>
<p><strong>Ellie Brass</strong>: Oh, I can't ever trust you. All I did was ask you to make a call.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: How's the beach house?</p>
<p><strong>Ellie Brass</strong>: Go to hell.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I have information about your friend, Dakota. Get in.</p>
<p><strong>Ellie Brass</strong>: All right. But I'm not playing twenty questions with you.</p>
<p>(Ellie slips into the car.)</p>
<p>(Just then, a cop car passes, lights flashing.) </p>
<p><strong>Ellie Brass</strong>: So, did you find her body?</p>
<p>(Brass looks at Ellie.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No. But we found the car.</p>
<p><strong>Ellie Brass</strong>: So she could still be alive?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We found blood in the trunk.</p>
<p><strong>Ellie Brass</strong>: No, no, no, she's alive. I can feel it.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Look, do you have anything with her DNA on it, like a hair brush or toothbrush or ... ?</p>
<p><strong>Ellie Brass</strong>: No. We keep all that stuff in our purse.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: How about clothes or sheets or pillowcases, like that?</p>
<p><strong>Ellie Brass</strong>: We share everything else.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Even the bed?</p>
<p><strong>Ellie Brass</strong>: I told you I'm not playing that game.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: If the lab doesn't have anything to match the blood to, then we'll never know. That's it.</p>
<p>(She looks away and sniffs.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Come on, let's get some dinner, huh? You look hungry.</p>
<p><strong>Ellie Brass</strong>: Wait. Blood. We went and got tested last week at the free clinic on Ivar. Maybe they keep it.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Tested for what?</p>
<p><strong>Ellie Brass</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Don't you use protection?</p>
<p><strong>Ellie Brass</strong>: Guys pay extra for bareback.</p>
<p>(She looks away. Brass sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You're a lot smarter than that, Ellie. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>Ellie Brass</strong>: Yeah, well, just because you want me to be smarter and sweeter and safer doesn't mean I am. And I got to go. Guess you know how to find me if you hear anything.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Don't go away. Don't-don't leave, don't leave.</p>
<p><strong>Ellie Brass</strong>: You're one to talk. All my life, that's all you did, walk out. Now we're gonna Norman Rockwell it? Look around, Dad. It's too late.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Don't leave.</p>
<p>(Ellie gets out of the car.) </p>
<p><strong>Ellie Brass</strong>: Leave me alone.</p>
<p>(She slams the door and leaves.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Ellie. Ellie!</p>
<p>(Camera holds on Brass.) </p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. FREE CLINIC -- DAY] </p>
<p>[INT. FREE CLINIC - HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Brass and Annie talk with the doctor at the Free Clinic.) </p>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong>: Here at the clinic, we pride ourselves a confidential relationship with our patients. This is a highly unusual request.</p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: I understand, but we're investigating a possible homicide here.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We found blood in the trunk of a car. We have reason to believe it could be Sasha Reynolds', street name Dakota.</p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: We're not interested in whether it's positive or negative. We need it for the DNA.</p>
<p>(A young blonde woman walks up to the doctor.) </p>

<p><strong>Woman</strong>: Ten.</p>
<p>(The doctor looks at her. The woman looks sheepish.) </p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: Twelve.</p>
<p>(The doctor looks at the clerk who hands her the condoms. The doctor hands the condoms to the woman.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Is that all the help they get?</p>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong>: These kids come from all over the place with stars in their eyes. While they're waiting to be discovered, they still got to pay their rent. They do a bump to turn their first trick. Next they're turning tricks to get their next bump. We do what we can. You do what you do.</p>
<p>(Annie's phone rings.)</p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p>(She steps away to answer it. The clerk hands the doctor a zip-loc bag with the vial of blood in it. The doctor hands it to Brass.) </p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: (to phone) (o.s.) Yeah. Kramer.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Good luck to you, too, doctor.</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: They didn't take your wallet?</p>
<p><strong>Todd Piccone</strong>: Oh, the car was worth more than the cash. They knew what they were doing.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: It's a pretty sweet ride. I'm still hung up on why you didn't report it.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Piccone</strong>: Captain, maybe I should introduce myself. Todd Piccone, Assistant City Attorney. Let's just say that my reputation is worth more than my car.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Then maybe you should stop having dates in your front seat.</p>
<p>(Annie turns and looks at Brass.) </p>
<p><strong>Todd Piccone</strong>: You're right. Lesson learned. Thank you, officer.</p>
<p>(Todd turns back to Annie.) </p>
<p><strong>Todd Piccone</strong>: So the car was stripped, I'm sure, uh ... South Central? Koreatown? East L.A.?</p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: Koreatown.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: How would you know that?</p>
<p><strong>Todd Piccone</strong>: 'Cause, Captain, that's where good cars go to die in Los Angeles.</p>

<p><strong>Vic Patterson</strong>: Oh, you know what? Let me get you an autograph or something. Little something for me. And a little something for you.</p>
<p>(Vic Patterson reaches into his jacket pocket for a pen. Brass happens to catch the tie clip he's wearing with the letters B-H-G-C on it.) </p>
<p><strong>Judge Silvio Peters</strong>: If you had enough for a warrant, you wouldn't be here. You'd be on your cell phone, calling me from Tommy Burger.</p>

<p>(Quick flash of: The examiner collects the substance under the fingernails.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (V.O.) ... collected a green, waxy substance under her fingernails.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Also, looks like he found concrete chunks in a bag tied to her waist.</p>
<p>(Brass picks up a couple of photos.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Probably what they used to weigh her down in the lake.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: The bag around Dakota's waist.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>

[EXT. PICCONE'S DRIVE - DAY]</p>
<p>(Brass is looking at one of the concrete blocks dug up from Tony Piccone's drive. Annie Kramer is next to Brass.) </p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: You want to say I told you so?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No. I just want it to be over with and have a happy ending.</p>
<p>(Tony Piccone rushes out of the house escorted by two officers. He heads down the drive. Warrick and Matt Glazer are there. They stop talking and turn to watch.) </p>
<p><strong>Tony Piccone</strong>: What the hell's going on? What's up?</p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: Sorry, Todd. We got the warrant; we have to search.</p>
<p>(Annie and Brass head for the house. Tony tries to follow them, but the officers stop him.) </p>
<p><strong>Tony Piccone</strong>: You got to be kidding me. Wha ... ?</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Stay here.</p>
<p>(Warrick, Matt Glazer, Annie, and Brass head into the house.) </p>
<p><strong>Tony Piccone</strong>: I just had the floors polished. Will you at least take your shoes off, please?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I sleep in my shoes, Todd.</p>
<p>[INT. PICCONE'S RESIDENCE - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(They climb up the stairs to the second level.) </p>
<p><strong>Matt Glazer</strong>: This guy married?</p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Glazer</strong>: Mm-hmm. Anyone else's gaydar going off?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, he did have a female hooker in his ride.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, maybe he swings both ways.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Why, because he has this nice shag carpet?</p>
<p>(Warrick touches the carpet.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: This carpet's wet.</p>
<p>(Matt Glazer and Warrick remove the shag carpet. They find a large bloodstain underneath.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Oh, yeah. That's a lot of blood.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Glazer</strong>: How much, you figure?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I don't know -- two, three pints?</p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: Nobody loses that much blood and lives.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: She died in this room.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I don't think we'll be able to get any DNA off this. The carpet solvents probably compromised the sample.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: She was beaten multiple times. There must be some spatter or cast-off.</p>
<p>(Matt reaches into his kit. He sprays the nearest wall. He gets a blue glow, but the wall television is on.) </p>
<p><strong>Matt Glazer</strong>: I can't get a clean read.</p>
<p>(Warrick stands up near the wall television set.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You know what? It's this metal surface. It's giving us a false positive.</p>
<p>(Warrick puts his face to the side of the wall and looks at the television set.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Does anyone see a remote?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, got one right here.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Could you hit the input button until we find a blue screen?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(Brass changes the input to the blue screen. They find a large crack in the monitor glass. There's some blood in the crack.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Look at that.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Glazer</strong>: I'll get a sample for DNA.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. PICCONE RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Warrick and Brass walk through the kitchen.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Nice place.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Mmm.</p>
<p>(Warrick opens the trash bins in the kitchen.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Who needs three trash bins?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Someone with a lot of dirt.</p>
<p>(In the third trash bin, there are empty hard alcohol bottles.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Wow. Big party. Tequila. Whiskey. Gin. Absinthe.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The coroner found green wax under Dakota's fingernails.</p>
<p>(Camera zooms in for a close-up of the nail marks on the green neck on one of the bottles.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. (LOS ANGELES) POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(Annie Kramer interviews Tony Piccone.) </p>
<p><strong>Tony Piccone</strong>: (sighs) Yes, I solicited her.</p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: So, you admit to having sexual relations with Sasha Reynolds, A.K.A. Dakota?</p>
<p><strong>Tony Piccone</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: But money changed hands?</p>
<p><strong>Tony Piccone</strong>: I paid her $60.</p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>Tony Piccone</strong>: I drove her back to my house and introduced her to a friend.</p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: And then?</p>
<p><strong>Tony Piccone</strong>: I have no knowledge of what happened after that.</p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: Does this friend have a name?</p>
<p><strong>Tony Piccone</strong>: Mmm. A big one.</p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: You know, Todd, I think you're smart enough to recognize consciousness of guilt. (Todd swallows.) Blood in your house, in your car. All of which was cleaned up. This friend worth going to prison for?</p>
<p><strong>Tony Piccone</strong>: Turn off that mic.</p>
<p>(Annie gives Tony a look. She reaches for the switch and glances at the mirror behind her.)</p>
<p>[INT. OBSERVATION ROOM]</p>
<p>(Brass watches, but can't hear anything.) </p>
<p>(Annie turns the switch back on.) </p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: (loud) Officer.</p>
<p>(The interview room door opens and the officer outside steps into the room.) </p>
<p>(Tony Piccone stands up and goes with the officer. Annie watches him go.) </p>
<p>(She turns to Brass.) </p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: He invoked.</p>
<p>(Brass nods.) </p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Brass is out walking. A car pulls into the parking lot behind him, headlights gleaming directly at Brass.) </p>
<p>(The car comes to a stop in front of him, brakes squealing.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p>(It's Warrick.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I wanted to catch you before you left. I got a look at the print results from the bottles that we collected just before I was escorted out and asked to leave the lab.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: They say why?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No, but I think I know why.</p>
<p>(Brass nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It's like Chinatown, Jim.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So visiting hours are over, doctor. It's time to go.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What about Ellie?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What about her?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, she's the only one who can I.D. Todd Piccone as the driver.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, I couldn't get much out of Annie, but I don't think Piccone killed Dakota -- it wasn't his scene.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I don't know. He's involved. It's his house. It's his car. It's his party.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Who's going to believe a tweaker hooker?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You better hope nobody, or she'll be taking a dirt nap.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. ELLIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Ellie sits at her vanity putting on her make-up. The phone rings.) </p>
<p><strong>Ellie</strong>: (answering machine) Hey, it's Ellie. Leave a message and I'll get back at you when I can.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, uh, Ellie, it's, it's your dad. Listen, you were right about the guy; he's a pretty important person with pretty important friends. So, uh, do me a favor. Don't go out tonight. Okay? </p>
<p>(The answering machine beeps off.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLVD (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[INT. BRASS' MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Warrick picks up a bottle.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: If Dakota had wax under her fingernails, I think she must have been doing more than just pouring.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Self defense?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [NIGHT] Dakota screams. She grabs the bottle by the neck, her fingernails digging into the wax. She stands up and tries to swing at her attacker.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Who was she defending against?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: From the prints that we got off the bottle, I have a list of six suspects.</p>
<p>(Warrick takes out the notebook paper from his pocket and reads the list of names to Brass.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Silvio Peters, Joe Cohen ...</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Wait a minute. Silvio Peters? He's a judge. He's on the list?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah. Daniel Reichmann, Vic Patterson, Todd Piccone, Parker Smythe.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: They're all in AFIS?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah. I mean, you can be in AFIS for a lot of reasons. After 9-11, anyone who works in a government building.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Right. I mean, doctors, lawyers, right.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Or anyone who has a permit to carry a concealed weapon.</p>
<p>(Brass looks at Warrick just as Warrick gets an idea.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You know what?</p>
<p>(Warrick sits down in the nearest chair. He puts the phone on the table on speaker phone and dials.) </p>
<p>(The phone rings.)</p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[INT. (LAS VEGAS) CSI - LAB - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Nick is looking through a scope when his phone rings. He answers it.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hello!</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey, Nicky. Where are you? Are you near a computer? Can you do me a favor?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, sure. How's the conference going?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Uh, it's intense. I have a list of suspects, all in AFIS. I want to know if any of them have a permit to carry concealed.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay, shoot.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Silvio Peters, Parker Smythe, Daniel Reichmann,<br />
(Nick types in the names.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Todd Piccone, and Vic Patterson.</p>
<p>(The results read all NEGATIVE except for Vic Patterson who is AFFIRMATIVE.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Vic Patterson does. Are we talking about &quot;The Eagle&quot;? From that TV show?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah. What kind of gun?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: A .45, same kind he uses in all his cheeseball shoot-outs.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Can you give me anything else?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, I can run the serial number through Automated Firearms Service, give you the history.</p>
<p>(Nick types in the serial number: T8341.) </p>

<p>(Quick flashes of: The BHGC sticker on the broken BMW windshield. Vic Patterson's tie clip.) </p>
<p>(End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>

<p>[INT. BEVERLY HILLS GUN CLUB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Brass and Warrick step up to the main desk. Brass shows the man his badge.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know, I'm just in town for a couple of days. It's always been a dream of mine to shoot at the famous Beverly Hills Gun Club. I wonder if I could get a day pass?</p>
<p><strong>Gun Club Man</strong>: For Las Vegas's finest? Sure thing.</p>
<p>(Warrick walks over to the gun display.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Look, um ... tell me something. You know, is it, is it true that, uh, you know, the actor Vic Patterson shoots here? </p>
<p><strong>Gun Club Man</strong>: Not really supposed to give out member info. But between you and me? The man is a damn fine shot.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No kidding.</p>
<p><strong>Gun Club Man</strong>: Matter of fact, he won several of our competitions.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>Gun Club Man</strong>: You want to rent or shoot your own?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Um ... I'll shoot what Vic shoots.</p>
<p><strong>Gun Club Man</strong>: (to Warrick) You shooting, too?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Nah, I'm just going to hang back. Let him blow off some steam.</p>
<p>(Brass gives Warrick a look.)</p>
<p>(The Gun Club man notices that Warrick is looking at Vic Patterson's award, gun and bullets.) </p>
<p><strong>Gun Club Man</strong>: Ain't that something?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, it's something.</p>
<p><strong>Gun Club Man</strong>: Right this way.</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (to phone) You know, actually I did, and if you get me a match, you might be able to meet him at his trial.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (to phone) Do you think that would make his autograph worth more? Or less?</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (to phone) Great, great. Thanks for all your help. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (from phone) Sure.</p>
<p>(Warrick knocks and enters the room. Brass hangs up. Warrick sits down on the bed.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Was that Nick?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah. IBIS confirmed the match. We're good to go. So, where you been?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: In Hollywood, thinking. You know, even if Vic Patterson did shoot up the car with his gun, that doesn't mean he killed Dakota. Just means he helped clean up.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: She wasn't shot. She was beaten.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah. We need a murder weapon to nail his ass. I got these photos at a Hollywood memorabilia shop for ten bucks. </p>
<p>(Warrick hands Brass some photos.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Who do you see?</p>
<p>(The top-most photo is of Vic Patterson posing with his gun.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: A jackass.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Look closer. Look at the pistol grip ... and The Eagle. You know, these autopsy photos I saw all got me thinking. This one. Look at the pattern contusions.</p>
<p>(Warrick picks out a particular photo and shows it to Brass. The bruising pattern on the victim matches the raised eagle logo on the gun.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The gun is the murder weapon.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [NIGHT] Dakota struggles against Vic Patterson. She's screaming.) </p>
<p><strong>Dakota</strong>: Stop it! Stop it!</p>
<p>(He hits her with the handle of the gun.) </p>

<p>(Warrick nods.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. BAR - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Brass and Annie Kramer talk.) </p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: About six months ago, this strung-out hooker comes into the PD, beat to crap, screaming that Vic Patterson had done it, and her wounds looked a lot like this. I figured it was her pimp, she was sniffing around for a settlement. Sent her home with an ice pack.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh. I'm sorry. I knew you thought this guy was a winner.</p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: I worked my whole life to sit at the table with the big boys ... only to find out that the food is poisoned.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know, the only record of this investigation is in that envelope, and half the evidence collection won't stand up in court, so it's your call. (She's thinking.) How many years you got on? </p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: Eight back in Jersey, fifteen here.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, that's 23 combined. That's a lot of innings. I mean, the worse they can do is make you retire.</p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: What am I gonna do then? Knit? This is it, Jimmy. This is all I got.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, if it's all you got, then you got to do it right. Remember Mike O'Toole? From Vice?</p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: Of course I do. Broke my heart when I found out he was dirty. </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, he was a heartbreaker. Broke up my marriage.</p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: I thought I did that.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, Nancy used our affair because she was looking for a way out, but for me ... I mean, I guess I'm old-fashioned. You know, a bad marriage is better than no marriage ... I thought.</p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: And you thought a kid would help?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You see, that's the thing. I didn't have a kid.</p>
<p>(Annie turns and looks at Brass. She puts the palm of her hand on his cheek.) </p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: (gently) Yeah, you did. I don't see Mike O'Toole out here helping her.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well ... I spent a good chunk of my life looking the other way. I mean, so much so that my neck got tired. So I, you know, I got a divorce. I, uh ... turned Mike and his crew in. Started over in Vegas. Ellie. She's like the unfinished business of all that.</p>
<p><strong>Annie Cramer</strong>: So it's my neck now.</p>
<p>(Brass remains silent as he picks up his drink.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE ELLIE'S APARTMENT - DAY]</p>
<p>(Brass walks down the hallway. He comes to apartment 2-F and stops. He takes a deep breath and exhales. Brass puts the small pink bear gift on the floor in front of the door. He looks at the card in his hand for DREAM HARBOR, REHABILITATION FACILITY.) </p>
<p>(He flips the card over. On the back is a hand-written note: </p>
<p>Ellie -<br />

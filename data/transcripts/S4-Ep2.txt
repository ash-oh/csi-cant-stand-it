Grissom: You got a husband-and-wife serial team killing couples.

Catherine: Mr. Dominguez was forced to kill his wife for the promise of freedom.
(Cut to: Scenes of:
* The knife against ALICE DOMINGEZ' throat.
* Cameron and Mandy Klinefeld hold gun to MR. DOMINGUEZ' back as they walk toward his car.)

Sara: They were never going to let him go.


Kenny Richmond : Murder central?
(Scenes of:
* MR. LAGGERMAN in the ice machine
* WENDY LAGGERMAN with her throat cut in the motel room.)


 
(Scenes of:
* CAMERON and MANDY KLINEFLED in the casino
* SARA picks up the knife from the floor of the back seat of the SUV.)
Brass: We are this close to busting a pair of serial killers, and the judge won't issue a warrant?
Stuart Gardner : Hey, I'm just the messenger.


Judge Slater: The affidavit is standing.
Grissom: You've signed warrants for less.


Cameron Klinefeld: &quot;Love is not love&quot;.
Grissom: Love is conditional.
Cameron Klinefeld: For most people.
Grissom: But not for you.



Nick: Then she stuck her tongue in this jerk.

Catherine: Rifkin's ear -- chances are she stuck it in Mr. Dominguez's ear, too.

Grissom: Should get a warrant.

(Scenes of:
* The Rifkins and the Klinefelds passing lime wedges between them.
* GRISSOM scoops up bloodied ice from the ice machine.)

Brass: Mr. and Mrs. Klinefeld, Las Vegas police.

Brass: We got a problem. Somebody got to our killers before we did.

WHITE FLASH TO END OF PREVIOUSLY ON

 
 
Brass: Are you carrying?
Grissom:  No.
Brass: Then get the hell out of here while I secure the room.

 
 
Brass:  This is Brass. 



Brass:  Yeah. I'm at 11546 Blackbird lane. Got two gunshot victims. Send rescue. There's no rush.

Grissom: Are those your guys?
Brass: Yeah, they're UC.
Grissom: How long they been sitting on the house?
Brass: Oh, about the time that Judge Slater didn't sign the first warrant.
Grissom: Two undercover guys outside. Two dead bodies inside.
Brass: Makes you feel a little paranoid, huh?
Grissom: Not paranoid enough.
SMASH CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS





 
Bill Nowlins: All right, Captain. What do you want to know.
Brass: So, you guys been here the whole time?
Bill Nowlins: Almost.
Brass: What happened?
Bill Nowlins: Tell him.
Jesse Commons: Around 7:00, there was a 444 call ... 

Dispatch:  ... citizen reports officer down. 2529 Harmon Hill. All units in the vicinity respond.

Bill Nowlins: We met up with a couple black-and-whites. U.T.L.
Grissom: W ... what is that?
Brass: Unable to locate.
Jesse Commons: False alarm. We came right back. Observed no activity in the house until you guys got here.
Grissom: You know we're going to need to see your guns.
Jesse Commons: Why would we off two scumbags when we know you're coming back with a warrant?
Grissom: It wasn't a question.
Jesse Commons: And you're not my supervisor.
Brass: I am. I want your gun. Give me your gun.

Brass:  Hey, help me out here.

Brass:  And your backups, too.
Bill Nowlins: Come on.

Bill Nowlins: Satisfied?
Brass: Just doing my job.

Brass:  Okay? Let's go.


Nick: These our serials?
Grissom: So it seems.

Grissom: Yesterday's suspects. Today's victims.
Nick: We had 'em ... 

Grissom: Take the inside.

Warrick: No sign of forced entry ... on this door, at least.

Grissom:  Print the handle.
Warrick: Yeah.




Nick: What do you think?

Grissom: I don't know what that is. Make sure you get al though. You see any cartridge casings?
Nick: Not yet.


David Phillips: 85.5.

Grissom: So T.O.D. was about 11:00 P.M.



Nick: Grissom, I've got blood, but ... a lot of pheno-negative stains as well.
Grissom: We're going to bring everything back. 


Nick:  Hey, Dave, let's run a tox screen on both d.b.'s okay?

Nick: What do you got, Rick?
Warrick: If the killer went out the back door, this may be his print.


Warrick: Good thing Brass had cops watching the house. 
Grissom: Linens and towels from The Sphere on top of the washing machine, and what I believe to be sheets from the motel inside the dryer. Both positive presumptive for blood.
Nick: Think they were being smart taking the sheets, or did they just get off sleeping on 'em?
Warrick: Either way, they were sick and dangerous.
Grissom: What does that say about whoever killed them?


 
Jesse Commons: Wh-what's the big deal? There's no humans involved. 
Bill Nowlins: I mean, look, Captain. Come on. The way I see it, somebody did us a favor.
Brass: Yeah.
Bill Nowlins: They're dead. Case is closed.
Brass: Hey, this isn't a favor, Bill. This is a screw-up.
Bill Nowlins: Would've been a lot bigger screw-up if ... if we didn't break surveillance and had an officer down four blocks away.
Brass: All right, what else did you see? 
Jesse Commons: Kid in that house made us. Thought we were bad news.
Brass: You are bad news.


 
 
Sara: I can't believe Grissom pulled us off that serial murder case.
Catherine: Yeah, well, let me tell you how it ends. They die. 

Catherine: Whoa, this isn't half bad for college kids.
Sara: Yeah. Why live in a one-room flea bag when you can pool your resources and live like this.
Catherine: Hey, how 'bout it: You, me, Warrick, Nick, Grissom ... 
Sara:  Oh, nnn ... Not Grissom.


 
Catherine: What the hell is this?
Officer: Ma'am, you may want to take one of these.

Sara: Thank you. 
Catherine: Thanks. Where's the body?
Officer: Upstairs.
Sara: Upstairs?
Officer: Yes.

Catherine: It's raining man juice?
Sara: Hallelujah?
Officer: You might want to wear those.

Sara: Thank you.



Sara: Well, weather's clearing.
Catherine: Yeah, if only the smell would.
Sara: Yep.

Catherine: It's like a sewer in here.



Sara: Oh, my goodness.

Catherine: Oh, god.
O'Riley: Soup's on.
Catherine: How long has he been in here?
O'Riley: Roommates last saw him Thursday night. Took off for the weekend. Came home to this.
Sara: Guy goes to take a shower and DFOs. He never got to the cold water, did he?
O'Riley: Roommate said only the hot water faucet was on.
Sara: Must've been a steam bath in here.
O'Riley: Still is.
Catherine: Well, any evidence on the floor's been washed away.
Sara: There, uh ... : Could be something in the tub.
Catherine: We got to take that body and get it through that door.
Sara: There's another option.



Caller :  I'm at the corner of Harmon Hill and 25th, just east of the intersection. ...
 
 
Caller :  There's been a shooting. I think a cop got shot. John, oh ... just occurred. I heard the shots.
Jen: I received the call and issued the 444. Uniforms called back a few minutes later, said they checked the area, said it was a U.T.L. You want to hear that?
Warrick: I'll hear it when you give me a dub of the original caller's voice ... and his phone number.
Jen:  I can get that for you right now.
(JEN works on the computer and gets the results:
Telephone Number Identified:
555-0187
Loc: Harmon Hill/25th.)
Warrick: Good.


(GRISSOM checks his phone message:
GRIS. GOT THE 911
CALLER'S NUMBER:
555-0187.W. )

Jesse Commons:  I'm sick of this lock-down, man.
Bill Nowlins: Head's up.
Jesse Commons: Are we done?
Grissom: If I'm not done, you're not done.
Jesse Commons: We already gave you our footprints, and our fingerprints are on file, so what else do you need?
Grissom: Which way is Harmon Hill?




Brass: So, Bradley, you saw our police officer at that door?
Bradley: Yeah ... and I was watching these guys all night. See, the two bad guys drove away in the van, and then the policeman showed up, knocked on the door. Mr. Klinefeld let him in ... but he never came back out.
Brass: Did you see a police car?
Bradley: Must've walked here.
Brass: Did you hear any gunshots?
Bradley: Nope.
Brass: Okay, thanks, Bradley. Good job.
Bradley: No problem.

Brass: Ever see a beat cop anywhere but the strip?
Grissom: And how'd he beat us to the killer?




 


 
Robbins: Trace evidence. Definitely doesn't belong in the wound track. Did your guy get shot through a window?
Grissom: No. We found a lot of this material at the crime scene.
Robbins: Absence of gunshot residue.
Grissom: Maybe he was shot through some sort of object. 
Robbins: Well, Mr. Klinefeld was shot once in the front and Mrs. Klinefeld once in the back.


Robbins: Dare I say the couple that slays together, lays together?






Catherine:  This drain hasn't been tampered with. It's just clogged. I think this is an accidental.
Sara:  There's nothing but young people stuff. No meds, except some aspirin. No prescriptions.
Catherine: Well, I don't think that means much. Chances are he's not getting his drugs from a medicine cabinet.
Sara: There's no sign of struggle. Any prints would have been washed away. Where does that leave us?
Catherine: Same place we were when we walked through the door -- with a bloated floater.

 
 
Nick: Hey, you know that cell phone Grissom found at the crime scene?
Warrick: Yeah.
Nick: Traced it back to a Public Defender. Said she lost it. Made life hell for her while she was in DC.
Warrick: Mm ... have you run a sample of this through the GCMS?
Nick: Mm-hmm. Polyethylene. 
Warrick: Polyethylene. I got the results back from Grissom's ant puddle.
Nick: mm-hmm.
Warrick: Corn syrup, glucose, caramel and water.
Nick: Hang on a second. 

Nick: Where do you keep the sodium rhodizinate?
Warrick: On top of the file cabinet.

 Warrick: So, what's up? You and Bobby switched or what?
Warrick: Hey, Rich, whatever happened with those bullets?

Rich: Six right nine-millimeter. Beretta, amongst others. Consistent with an officer's duty weapon. 
Warrick: Consistent with officer commons and Officer Nowlin's weapons?
Rich: No match. That includes backups.
Warrick: Well, thanks.

Nick: Hey, Warrick.
Warrick: Yeah?
Nick: Polyethylene plus corn syrup plus GSR gives you what?
Warrick: Polyethylene and corn syrup is... cola in a bottle.
Nick: GSR on the inside of a plastic bottle means ... 
Rich: Soda silencer.

Nick: Poor man's silencer. Only good for a couple shots.
Warrick: So, that shooter was sitting on the house and the surveillance team. 

Warrick:  Empties out his bottle of soda... calls in an &quot;officer down&quot; ... ...drops the phone and takes a walk.



Nick: What do you think? 
Grissom: Who do we have around here that could find us a somewhat used soda bottle?







INTERCUT WITH VARIOUS LAB SHOTS
















Catherine: Hey. 
Sara: Floater's shirt. Took it off his bed. What does this look like to you?
Catherine: A backwards seven.
Sara: Yeah, that's what I got. What's it doing on a DB's shirt?
Catherine: I don't know.

Catherine: Some kind of greasepaint or makeup.
Sara: How do you get paint on the inside of your clothes?
Catherine: Rubs off your chest. Oh, what kind of guy paints his chest?
Sara: Performance artist? A clown maybe?
Catherine:  Sports freak.



 
Brass: Well, it's not like you to have a one-track mind.
Grissom: If the evidence points to cops, we chase cops.
Brass: Jesse Commons and Bill Nowlin were doing what I asked them to do. They were sitting on the house. Until you can get enough physical evidence to support a warrant.
Grissom: Somebody knew we were looking at the Klinefelds. They knew where they lived. That's somebody inside.
Brass: Cops don't take the law into their own hands.
Grissom: Ha! In what city?

Brass: Oh, you want to hit below the belt? You know, a lot of people had access to the Klinefelds. Who knows, maybe CSI III, Nicky Stokes opened up his mouth to another parking lot attendant.

Grissom: There was an eyewitness who saw a uniform at the front door.
Brass: Oh, come on, a ten-year-old insomniac kid, hyped up on sugar, going blind on x-box. Who knows what he saw?
Grissom: So, now you're discrediting your own witness?
Brass: All right, let's break it down. You got a public defender's cell phone, no prints. You got officers' weapons taken from the scene, not fired. You got officers' shoe prints, not matching the evidence print. You got three black-and-whites confirming that Commons and Nowlin responded to a 444. Give these guys a break.
Grissom: Just because they weren't the shooters doesn't mean they weren't involved.
Brass: Oh, what, so it's a conspiracy? 
Grissom: Oh, please! You got a bogus 444 call two blocks away.
Brass: Oh, come on, you know the deal. You know better than that. There's bogus calls come in every day. Well, maybe you don't, because you're the kind of guy who goes to serve a warrant without a gun.
Grissom: I'm not a cop.
Brass: Well, that's a distinction that could be lost when the suspect's still inside the house. Look, I had your back. Now I expect you to have mine.
Grissom: That's not the way it works.
Brass: In what city?

Greg: Hey, guys? I found something.
Grissom: Not now.
Greg: No. You need to see this. Both of you. Now!

Greg: Please.


 
 


Greg: Sorry I didn't find the soda bottle.
Grissom: This'll do.



;





Brass: Star-1 uniforms. It's the biggest uniform shop in town. From casino dealers to cops. Shirt's wet.
Greg: I found it in a storm drain.
Grissom: Where exactly?
Greg: Two blocks west of the house.
Brass:  Opposite direction from the 444.

Brass: uh ... Buttons.
Grissom: Meaning?
Brass: All the new uniforms have zippers.

Grissom: This collar's dry. It's hot out -- at least a buck twenty-five.
Brass: Let's hope whoever was wearing that shirt sweats.

Brass: The badge looks legit. I'll run the number.




 
Robbins: Roommates were unable to make a positive ID due to the accelerated decomposition, but dental records confirmed Daniel O'Hannissey. Laceration on the forehead -- macerated, but not significant. Contusion with a small laceration ... here, below the ear. That did some damage. There's an obvious hematoma in the subdural space consistent with a subdural bleed. Herniation of the uncinate process on the same side.
Sara: Doc, uh, why is his brain green?
Robbins: He was steamed. Turns the brain into lime gelatin.
Catherine: Cause of death?
Robbins: Ruled out drowning. There was no water in the lungs. He was dead before he hit the water. So, you are looking at it -- a blow to the back of the head. Resulted in a subdural hematoma. Sort of like a slow leak in a tire.
Catherine: A slow leak in a tire?
Robbins: Odds are Danny had no idea he was bleeding in his brain. He probably felt fine. Maybe a little woozy. Then out of nowhere, he drops.
Sara: How long do you think he lived after the blow?
Robbins: 12 to 24 hours.
Catherine: Well, he had to have been in the water for a couple of days to look like this. Roommates last saw him Thursday. So I guess we start there and we work backwards. Thanks.
Robbins: Yeah.

 
 
Fromansky: I lost my badge years ago. Filed a report. Got issued a new one.
Brass: Yeah, I'm aware of officers &quot;losing&quot; their badges.
Fromansky: Then we don't have a problem, do we?
Brass: No, we got a problem 'cause your badge was found in the proximity of a crime scene.
Grissom: How'd you manage to lose your badge?
Fromansky: Such is life.
Grissom: That's not the answer I was hoping for.
Brass: I've been looking at your jacket. Reads like a novel. You got a lot of entries in here. You got, uh ... beat-and-release. You got some stick therapy. What's up with this?
Fromansky: Show me a cop without a few entries in his jacket, I'll show you a pogue.
Grissom: You referring to me?
Fromansky: Guys like you get to sit on your ass behind a desk because guys like me are out there doing the real work.
Brass:  Okay, tough guy, tell me what you know.
Fromansky: I lost my badge. End of story.

Fromansky: If I ever find the guy that stole it, be--...

Fromansky: I want my union rep.
Brass: I'm it.
Fromansky: I want somebody impartial. 
Brass: Well, I was impartial. Now open up.


 
Nick: You went for a bottle and found a shirt?
Grissom:  This swab is your new priority.
Greg: I was just filling Nick in...
Grissom: Fill me in first. The sweat stain?
Greg: Uh, I was just getting started. I can do them both together.

Grissom: The shoe print?
Nick: Running it through limbic.
Grissom: How can you be doing that when you're standing here?

Caller :  I'm at the corner of Harmon Hill and 25th. Just east of the intersection. There's been a shooting. I think a cop got shot. John, oh ... just occurred. I heard shots.
Grissom: Where are we?
Warrick: Check it out.

Caller :  I think a cop got shot. John, oh ... just occurred. I heard shots.
Warrick: I have never heard a citizen that calm. This 911 caller knew the drill. He's using Officers code. 'J' becomes john. 'O' becomes ocean. J.O.--
Just occurred. 
Grissom: Old habits die hard. 
Warrick: I'm only halfway home. I need a voice exemplar. Did you get a name off that badge?
Grissom: Yeah.


 
Roommate: You know, Daniel was from Green Bay. Big-time diehard football fan. He tried to walk-on here, but, uh ... didn't make the team. But, hey, come game night, he was always at the stadium.
Catherine: What about the away games?
Roommate: He watched one game at home and lost all of his chill privileges. It was ugly.
Catherine: Define ugly.
Roommate: Busted the couch, jumping on it. Neighbors called the cops 'cause he was so loud. He was a real bluto.
Sara: Where else did he 'bluto'?


 
Waitress: Everybody knew Dan-O. He's the kind of guy that keeps a place like this in business. I'm going to miss him.
Sara: When was the last time you saw him?
Waitress: When was the last rebel game? Thursday.
Catherine: Did you notice anything? Did he ...feel okay?
Waitress: Better than okay. He was pumped. He was so pumped that him and some of his buddies got into it with some other guys.
Sara: Wh-what do you mean? He started a fight?
Waitress: No, Shirley Temple started the fight.

Daniel O'Hannissey: Right there! Right there! WOO!

Daniel O'Hannissey: Hey, see those four guys down there? Give them four Shirley Temples. Shirley temples -- extra cherries. Keep the change.


Waitress: Shirley temples all around.

Daniel O'Hannissey: Hey, Wayne, those are for you, buddy. Those are for you and your boys.

Catherine: How did Shirley take it?
Waitress: Not so good.

Wayne: Come here, tough guy.

Daniel O'Hannissey: Yeah!

Waitress: You know how guys are. They scrap until someone gets a touchdown.
Sara: Yeah. Yeah, right.
Catherine: Do you see any of those guys in here now?

Waitress: There's a couple of Shirleys over there by the big screen.



Brown:  Jen, I need a sample of Fromansky's voice.

 
Jen:  What's it worth to you?

Warrick: Drinks?
Jen: I don't think you understand.

Fromansky:  Officer in pursuit of late-model Honda civic. Possibly stolen. Heading northbound on Koval Lane.

Warrick: Hold on.

Jen: Now, I've got three full minutes of Officer Fromansky here. I was thinking of maybe taking it to the dispatch convention.
Warrick: Oh, no, no. Okay, okay. Drinks at my place.
Jen: I can make that dub for you. What time?



 
Fromansky: Got a second?
Grissom: You're a suspect in an ongoing investigation. We're not allowed to have a conversation.
Fromansky: I wouldn't waste my life on them.
Grissom: Well, if that's true, then your DNA sample will rule you out.
Fromansky: Someday, you're going to need me or my buddies at a scene ... and wouldn't you know it-- we all hit traffic on the way.
Grissom: Is that how you do your job, officer?
Fromansky: Have a safe night.



 
Fromansky:  Officer in pursuit of late-model honda civic ... 
Caller :  just occurred ... I heard shots . 
Fromansky:  Heading northbound ... 
Caller :  just east of the intersection. There's been a ... 
Archie: Pitch, speed, volume -- They're all different. It's not even close.
Grissom: Maybe he disguised his voice.
Archie: There's no distortion.
Warrick: Fromansky didn't make that call, Gris.

Greg: The, uh, sweat from the uniform not a match to officer Fromansky.






 
Brass: You're a hard guy to find.
Grissom: I messed up, Jim. I got ahead of the evidence. I made it personal, and I don't know why.
Brass: We both got a little stubborn. Did a little head-butting. I kind of liked it. You were like your old self there. Anyway ... 

Brass: Fromansky was my money, too.
Grissom: I still think it's somebody inside. 
Brass: Pull off a murder like this, it takes some practice. So... one thing I remembered. About six or seven months ago, we arrested a couple of gang-bangers. They were popping blackjack dealers on their way home from work, taking their toke envelopes. Because of some technicality, Judge Slater let them walk right out of the courtroom. I mean, they were talking about this in the precinct for weeks. Now this morality play has a very quick and unhappy ending. Somebody shot them.
Grissom: Vigilantes?
Brass: Maybe. But still, I don't like a cop for this.
Grissom: So take the cops out. Who's left?

 
(NICK has printed all the density levels onto clear plastic. He puts them together and comes up with one composite of the shoe print. He holds up the clear plastic sheets up as we: 
DISSOLVE TO:


 
Grissom: &quot;All for our country.&quot;
Brass: That's what he probably told himself.



 
Judge Slater: Like I told you before, if you're here for a warrant, you better have evidence to back it up.
Brass: We're not here to get a warrant, Judge. We're here to serve one.



 
O'Riley: Wayne, you want to tell us about the game Friday night?
Wayne: You mean like strategy? Chalk talk?
Catherine: Start with the Shirley Temples and go from there.

Wayne: You're talking about those idiots from UNLV.
O'Riley: We have a witness that said you guys had a beef. Specifically, you and number seven.
Wayne: Dude, I don't even know those guys, okay? They came in, they tried to be funny, and we set them straight.
Catherine: How?
Wayne: Gave them a little talking to.
Sara: Any blows exchanged? Physical contact?
Wayne: Did that punk bitch rat us out? It was harmless. It was nothing.
Sara: Punk bitch? A kid is dead.
Wayne:  What?
Sara: Dan O'Hannissey is dead.
Wayne: I didn't do anything. Hey, that guy left before we did, and he was fine. He was still running his mouth.
O'Riley: I suppose your buddies will testify to that?
Wayne: Yeah, they'll testify to that. Look, you can ask anybody who was in there.

Catherine: Interesting ring you've got on. 
Wayne: The SMU sharks.
Catherine: That's a college ring. Mind if I borrow it?
Wayne: You want to borrow my ring?
Catherine: Yeah.

Wayne: Okay. Take it. I didn't do anything.
O'Riley: You're not under arrest. You're free to go.


Judge Slater: You have a lot of nerve walking in my chambers accusing me of murder.
Grissom: I'm not accusing you of murder. I just want to see your shoes.
Judge Slater: You've a warrant to search my closet?
Grissom: We need to see all your shoes.
Brass: That goes for your bailiff and your clerk as well. Gentlemen, please remove your shoes. I'm sure you'd want to set an example for all court employees.
Judge Slater: The warrant is limited to me, my Clerk and the Bailiff?
Brass: The Klinefeld warrant was generated from this office, and only you three had access to their personal information, so ... yeah.
Judge Slater: I look forward to the day you return to my courtroom, Detective. 

Stuart Gardner: Who issued the warrant?
Brass: Judge Correll.
Stuart Gardner: Good Judge. Always count on him for paper.

Grissom: Not this pair.

Grissom: Not those.

Grissom: You a smoker?
Stuart Gardner: Is that a crime?
Grissom: It's not good for you.






 
Sara: What tipped you to the ring?
Catherine: Jaws.
Sara: Peter Benchley's Jaws?
Catherine: No, it was in Steven Spielberg's Jaws. They had this mechanical shark named Bruce. And he kept swimming round and round in circles.
Sara: How come?
Catherine: His dorsal fin was bent.

Sara: How did Bruce's fin get bent?
Catherine: Same way the kid's ring did. It hit something.

Daniel O'Hannissey: Don't be pushing, tough guy!

Wayne: Come on!




Wayne: Come on. Come on! WAYNE: Come on! FRIENDS: Forget it, man.


 
 
Wayne: You got to be kidding me.
Sara: You threw a punch. Probably a sucker punch.
Wayne: Look, I told you, that guy walked away.
Catherine: But he was already dying. And you're responsible.
Sara: Now who's the punk... bitch? 


 
Brass:  This is detective Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police Department. Interview room &quot;A.&quot; I'm with Stuart Gardner, County Court Clerk. Please, um, state your name.

Stuart Gardner: Stuart Gardner. G-A-R-D-N-E-R.
Brass: And spell it for the record. That's right. You used to be a cop.
Stuart Gardner: Once a cop, always a cop. You and I are brothers.

Brass:  I'm not your brother. 

Brass: You're a murderer. 

Stuart Gardner: I have a warrant to search these premises.
Cameron Klinefeld: This is a joke. You can't arrest me.

Stuart Gardner: I'm not here to arrest you.

Cameron Klinefeld: What, wait a second ...



Brass: We also found your old uniform shirt, with your DNA on the collar. What are you going to retire on? Psych? Medical? What?
Stuart Gardner: Weren't you close to retirement? After you shot that bystander?
Brass: Ah, you want to talk about me, huh? Oh, you're a clerk. Get your facts straight. He wasn't a bystander. He was a passenger in a felony pursuit.
Stuart Gardner: So how'd you get promoted to Captain after that?
Brass: Must be my good looks.
Stuart Gardner: You agreed to drive a desk ... at CSI ... with all the sleazy civilians.
Brass: Don't knock the CSI, Stuart. They put a lot of bad guys away. 

Brass: You know, I'm going to give you a little therapy for free. You know, if you had only shown a little restraint, they would have processed the DNA after Klinefelds'. Slam-dunk case.
Stuart Gardner: Lots of guys get off on slam-dunk cases.
Brass: Yeah, I bet you saw a lot of that working for Judge Slater, most liberal judge in the state. 


Brass:  Bet you saw a lot of good cases go south, while you just processed those release forms, huh? 


Stuart Gardner: Let me ask you something. Doesn't it piss you off to put all your hard work in the hands of twelve people too stupid to get off jury duty?


Brass:  Stuart, sit down.
Warrick: This guy's a nut job vigilante. He's making the whole department look bad.
Grissom: I guess he'd just figured he'd take a shortcut. You've thought about it.
Warrick: Yeah, lots of times ... what about you?

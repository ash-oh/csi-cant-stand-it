<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p>(Camera zooms in for a close up. Resume to normal.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I don't know what that is. Make sure you get al though. You see any cartridge casings?</p>

<p>(NICK takes off his gloves and walks into the room that WARRICK'S in.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What do you got, Rick?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: If the killer went out the back door, this may be his print.</p>
<p>(Quick camera close up of the print being lifted to the sheet. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM joins them in the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Good thing Brass had cops watching the house. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Linens and towels from The Sphere on top of the washing machine, and what I believe to be sheets from the motel inside the dryer. Both positive presumptive for blood.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Think they were being smart taking the sheets, or did they just get off sleeping on 'em?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Either way, they were sick and dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What does that say about whoever killed them?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />

<p><strong>Jesse Commons</strong>: Wh-what's the big deal? There's no humans involved. </p>
<p><strong>Bill Nowlins</strong>: I mean, look, Captain. Come on. The way I see it, somebody did us a favor.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Bill Nowlins</strong>: They're dead. Case is closed.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hey, this isn't a favor, Bill. This is a screw-up.</p>
<p><strong>Bill Nowlins</strong>: Would've been a lot bigger screw-up if ... if we didn't break surveillance and had an officer down four blocks away.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: All right, what else did you see? </p>
<p><strong>Jesse Commons</strong>: Kid in that house made us. Thought we were bad news.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You are bad news.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I can't believe Grissom pulled us off that serial murder case.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, well, let me tell you how it ends. They die. </p>
<p>(They both head toward the house.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Whoa, this isn't half bad for college kids.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah. Why live in a one-room flea bag when you can pool your resources and live like this.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, how 'bout it: You, me, Warrick, Nick, Grissom ... </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (shakes her head) Oh, nnn ... Not Grissom.</p>
<p>(They walk into the house.)</p>
<p>[INT. HOUSE - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(The first floor ceiling is completely soaked through. It looks as if it's raining on the inside.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What the hell is this?</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Ma'am, you may want to take one of these.</p>
<p>(He hands them an open umbrella.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Thank you. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Thanks. Where's the body?</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Upstairs.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Upstairs?</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p>(They get a good look at the first floor and the entire ceiling is leaking.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It's raining man juice?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hallelujah?</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: You might want to wear those.</p>
<p>(The OFFICER puts two pairs of rubber boots down on the floor in front of their feet.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[STAIRS - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(SARA folds up the umbrella and shakes it.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, weather's clearing.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, if only the smell would.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks around and sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It's like a sewer in here.</p>
<p>(They reach the first bedroom doorway and the bedroom is completely flooded. They make their way toward the bathroom.)</p>
<p>[INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(SARA'S the first to see it. There's a dead body floating in the tub completely bloated. SGT. O'RILEY stands next to the tub.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Oh, my goodness.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE steps to the doorway and sees the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, god.</p>
<p><strong>O'Riley</strong>: Soup's on.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: How long has he been in here?</p>
<p><strong>O'Riley</strong>: Roommates last saw him Thursday night. Took off for the weekend. Came home to this.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Guy goes to take a shower and DFOs. He never got to the cold water, did he?</p>
<p><strong>O'Riley</strong>: Roommate said only the hot water faucet was on.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Must've been a steam bath in here.</p>
<p><strong>O'Riley</strong>: Still is.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, any evidence on the floor's been washed away.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: There, uh ... (clears throat): Could be something in the tub.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We got to take that body and get it through that door.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: There's another option.</p>
<p>(SARA looks at the bathroom window.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p><strong>Caller (man)</strong>: (V.O.) (recording) I'm at the corner of Harmon Hill and 25th, just east of the intersection. ...</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - DISPATCH -- DAY] </p>
<p>(WARRICK is at dispatch collecting the recording.) </p>
<p><strong>Caller (man)</strong>: (recording) There's been a shooting. I think a cop got shot. John, oh ... just occurred. I heard the shots.</p>
<p><strong>Jen</strong>: I received the call and issued the 444. Uniforms called back a few minutes later, said they checked the area, said it was a U.T.L. You want to hear that?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'll hear it when you give me a dub of the original caller's voice ... and his phone number.</p>
<p><strong>Jen</strong>: (smiles) I can get that for you right now.</p>
<p>(JEN works on the computer and gets the results:<br />

Loc: Harmon Hill/25th.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Good.</p>

GRIS. GOT THE 911<br />
CALLER'S NUMBER:<br />

<p>(GRISSOM dials. He walks over to the two officers waiting for the phone to ring. He can hear his phone ring, but not the receiving phone.)</p>
<p><strong>Jesse Commons</strong>: (o.s.) I'm sick of this lock-down, man.</p>
<p><strong>Bill Nowlins</strong>: Head's up.</p>
<p><strong>Jesse Commons</strong>: Are we done?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: If I'm not done, you're not done.</p>
<p><strong>Jesse Commons</strong>: We already gave you our footprints, and our fingerprints are on file, so what else do you need?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Which way is Harmon Hill?</p>
<p>(BILL NOWLINS points. GRISSOM heads in that direction. When he gets just a short distance away, he hears a cell phone ring.)</p>
<p>(Off in the bushes to the side of the walkway, under the brush, GRISSOM finds the phone. He takes out a pair of gloves and picks it up.)</p>
<p>(The something catches his eye. He sees a large number of ants near a puddle of liquid on the sidewalk. He takes out a swab and takes a sample of the liquid.)</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Jesse Commons and Bill Nowlin were doing what I asked them to do. They were sitting on the house. Until you can get enough physical evidence to support a warrant.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Somebody knew we were looking at the Klinefelds. They knew where they lived. That's somebody inside.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So, now you're discrediting your own witness?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: All right, let's break it down. You got a public defender's cell phone, no prints. You got officers' weapons taken from the scene, not fired. You got officers' shoe prints, not matching the evidence print. You got three black-and-whites confirming that Commons and Nowlin responded to a 444. Give these guys a break.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Just because they weren't the shooters doesn't mean they weren't involved.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, what, so it's a conspiracy? </p>

Laceration on the forehead -- macerated, but not significant. Contusion with a small laceration ... here, below the ear. That did some damage. There's an obvious hematoma in the subdural space consistent with a subdural bleed. Herniation of the uncinate process on the same side.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Doc, uh, why is his brain green?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: He was steamed. Turns the brain into lime gelatin.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Cause of death?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Ruled out drowning. There was no water in the lungs. He was dead before he hit the water. So, you are looking at it -- a blow to the back of the head. Resulted in a subdural hematoma. Sort of like a slow leak in a tire.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: A slow leak in a tire?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Odds are Danny had no idea he was bleeding in his brain. He probably felt fine. Maybe a little woozy. Then out of nowhere, he drops.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: How long do you think he lived after the blow?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: 12 to 24 hours.</p>

<p>(Close up of the Nevada Seal: &quot;All for our country * Nevada)</p>
<p>(Camera pulls back to show the heavy seal on the ground in front of a column. GRISSOM and BRASS stand over the seal.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: &quot;All for our country.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: That's what he probably told himself.</p>
<p>(They head inside the County Courthouse Building.)</p>

[INT. JUDGE SLATER'S OFFICE -- DAY]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and BRASS face the JUDGE.) </p>
<p><strong>Judge Slater</strong>: Like I told you before, if you're here for a warrant, you better have evidence to back it up.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We're not here to get a warrant, Judge. We're here to serve one.</p>
<p>(BRASS hands the warrant to JUDGE SLATER.)</p>

[INT. CSI - INTERVIEW ROOM]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE, SARA and O'RILEY interview WAYNE.) </p>
<p><strong>O'Riley</strong>: Wayne, you want to tell us about the game Friday night?</p>
<p><strong>Wayne</strong>: You mean like strategy? Chalk talk?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Start with the Shirley Temples and go from there.</p>
<p>(WAYNE laughs.)</p>
<p><strong>Wayne</strong>: You're talking about those idiots from UNLV.</p>
<p><strong>O'Riley</strong>: We have a witness that said you guys had a beef. Specifically, you and number seven.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne</strong>: Dude, I don't even know those guys, okay? They came in, they tried to be funny, and we set them straight.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>Wayne</strong>: Gave them a little talking to.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Any blows exchanged? Physical contact?</p>
<p><strong>Wayne</strong>: Did that punk bitch rat us out? It was harmless. It was nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Punk bitch? A kid is dead.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne</strong>: (surprised) What?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Dan O'Hannissey is dead.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne</strong>: I didn't do anything. Hey, that guy left before we did, and he was fine. He was still running his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>O'Riley</strong>: I suppose your buddies will testify to that?</p>
<p><strong>Wayne</strong>: Yeah, they'll testify to that. Look, you can ask anybody who was in there.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE notices his ring.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Interesting ring you've got on. </p>
<p><strong>Wayne</strong>: The SMU sharks.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: That's a college ring. Mind if I borrow it?</p>
<p><strong>Wayne</strong>: You want to borrow my ring?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(He removes the ring and puts it on the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Wayne</strong>: Okay. Take it. I didn't do anything.</p>
<p><strong>O'Riley</strong>: You're not under arrest. You're free to go.</p>

[INT. JUDGE SLATER'S OFFICE]</p>
<p><strong>Judge Slater</strong>: You have a lot of nerve walking in my chambers accusing me of murder.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm not accusing you of murder. I just want to see your shoes.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Slater</strong>: You've a warrant to search my closet?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We need to see all your shoes.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: That goes for your bailiff and your clerk as well. Gentlemen, please remove your shoes. I'm sure you'd want to set an example for all court employees.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Slater</strong>: The warrant is limited to me, my Clerk and the Bailiff?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The Klinefeld warrant was generated from this office, and only you three had access to their personal information, so ... yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Slater</strong>: I look forward to the day you return to my courtroom, Detective. </p>
<p>(JUDGE SLATER sits in his seat and raises his shoes to be checked. BRASS sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Gardner</strong>: Who issued the warrant?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Judge Correll.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Gardner</strong>: Good Judge. Always count on him for paper.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM checks the bottom of the JUDGE'S shoes.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Not this pair.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM checks the bailiff's shoes.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Not those.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM sees the pack of cigarettes in STUART GARDNER'S shirt pocket.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You a smoker?</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Gardner</strong>: Is that a crime?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's not good for you.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM finds the pair of shoes.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: SUART GARDNER standing in front of the column and on the seal during his smoke break. Emphasis on his shoes when he steps away.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks up from the shoes to STUART GARDNER.)</p>

[INT. CSI -- LAB]</p>
<p>(SARA and CATHERINE are in the lab.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What tipped you to the ring?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Jaws.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Peter Benchley's Jaws?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No, it was in Steven Spielberg's Jaws. They had this mechanical shark named Bruce. And he kept swimming round and round in circles.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: How come?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: His dorsal fin was bent.</p>
<p>(Close up of the bent fin on the ring.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: How did Bruce's fin get bent?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Same way the kid's ring did. It hit something.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Back at the bar that night, WAYNE approaches DANIEL O'HANNISSEY.)</p>
<p><strong>Daniel O'Hannissey</strong>: Don't be pushing, tough guy!</p>
<p>(DANIEL turns around and pushes WAYNE back.)</p>
<p><strong>Wayne</strong>: Come on!</p>
<p>(Suddenly the shouting and cheering on the television has DANIEL'S attention and he turns to cheer and whoop along with the game, turning his back to WAYNE.)</p>
<p>(Rather than wait around, WAYNE swings and hits DANIEL in the back of the head.)</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV to: Inside DANIEL'S head, he starts bleeding. End of CGI POV.)</p>
<p>(DANIEL turns around and rushes WAYNE. His friends stop him.)</p>
<p><strong>Wayne</strong>: Come on. Come on! WAYNE: Come on! FRIENDS: Forget it, man.</p>

[INT. BAR -- DAY] </p>
<p>(SARA and CATHERINE re-interview WAYNE.) </p>
<p><strong>Wayne</strong>: You got to be kidding me.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You threw a punch. Probably a sucker punch.</p>
<p><strong>Wayne</strong>: Look, I told you, that guy walked away.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: But he was already dying. And you're responsible.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Now who's the punk... bitch? </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM A -- DAY]</p>
<p>(BRASS is starting his interview with STUART GARDNER.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (to tape recorder) This is detective Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police Department. Interview room &quot;A.&quot; I'm with Stuart Gardner, County Court Clerk. Please, um, state your name.</p>
<p>(He puts the recorder on the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Gardner</strong>: Stuart Gardner. G-A-R-D-N-E-R.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: And spell it for the record. That's right. You used to be a cop.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Gardner</strong>: Once a cop, always a cop. You and I are brothers.</p>
<p>(BRASS leans forward.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (quietly) I'm not your brother. </p>
<p>(BRASS straightens, turns and heads for the other end of the table where he takes a seat.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You're a murderer. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [THE KLINEFELD'S] CAMERON KLINEFELD looks at the bogus warrant.)</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Gardner</strong>: I have a warrant to search these premises.</p>
<p><strong>Cameron Klinefeld</strong>: This is a joke. You can't arrest me.</p>
<p>(CAMERON turns and walks into the house.)</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Gardner</strong>: I'm not here to arrest you.</p>
<p>(STUART GARDNER lifts up his gun with the plastic bottle silencer at the end of it and fires.)</p>
<p><strong>Cameron Klinefeld</strong>: What, wait a second ...</p>
<p>(MANDY sees the shot, stands and runs for the door. He fires and hits her in the back.)</p>
<p>(STUART GARDNER grabs a towel of the faucet to use to open the back door. The newspaper on the counter falls to the floor. He steps on it on his way out. He closes the door behind him.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We also found your old uniform shirt, with your DNA on the collar. What are you going to retire on? Psych? Medical? What?</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Gardner</strong>: Weren't you close to retirement? After you shot that bystander?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Ah, you want to talk about me, huh? Oh, you're a clerk. Get your facts straight. He wasn't a bystander. He was a passenger in a felony pursuit.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Gardner</strong>: So how'd you get promoted to Captain after that?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Must be my good looks.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Gardner</strong>: You agreed to drive a desk ... at CSI ... with all the sleazy civilians.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Don't knock the CSI, Stuart. They put a lot of bad guys away. </p>
<p>(BRASS stands up and walks toward the mirror.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know, I'm going to give you a little therapy for free. You know, if you had only shown a little restraint, they would have processed the DNA after Klinefelds'. Slam-dunk case.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Gardner</strong>: Lots of guys get off on slam-dunk cases.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, I bet you saw a lot of that working for Judge Slater, most liberal judge in the state. </p>
<p>[OBSERVATION ROOM]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM, WARRICK and NICK watch the interview.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (through speakers) Bet you saw a lot of good cases go south, while you just processed those release forms, huh? </p>
<p>[INTERVIEW ROOM]</p>
<p>(STUART stands up and moves to stand directly behind BRASS. The officer at the back of the room follows close behind.)</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Gardner</strong>: Let me ask you something. Doesn't it piss you off to put all your hard work in the hands of twelve people too stupid to get off jury duty?</p>
<p>[OBSERVATION ROOM]</p>
<p>(BRASS turns around.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (through speakers) Stuart, sit down.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: This guy's a nut job vigilante. He's making the whole department look bad.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I guess he'd just figured he'd take a shortcut. You've thought about it.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, lots of times ... what about you?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at WARRICK. Rather than answer the question, GRISSOM stands and leaves the room.)</p>
<p>(He walks out of the OBSERVATION ROOM and into the HALLWAY where he passes by OFFICER FROMANSKY walking in the opposite direction. OFFICER FROMANSKY looks at GRISSOM as he walks by.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM stops and turns back to look at OFFICER FROMANSKY. FROMANSKY doesn't spare him a backward glance.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[SHOOTING RANGE] </p>
<p>(GRISSOM is at the firing range with his gun. He empties the cartridge. When he's done, he brings the target up forward where we see that GRISSOM is an excellent shot. All bullets hit the 9-bullseye target center.)</p>
<p>(Camera holds on the target.)</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>

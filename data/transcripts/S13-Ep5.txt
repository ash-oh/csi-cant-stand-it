Shut your mouth and act like you got some sense, girl!
Are you sure you have the right address?
It's 1027 Washington Street.

I don't even see any numbers.
Well, it's got to be just... up there.
You better shut your mouth!
That guy has a gun.
It's... probably just part of his costume.
MAN: Yo.
Cheerleader.
Yeah, you.
Okay.
Forget the party.
Let's get a cab and go home.
MAN: Want to party with us?


What is that?





MAN: Come!
STOKES: Hey.
What's going on?
Well, the dog's freaking out.
Won't let us near the body.
It's like he's... guarding his kill.
STOKES: Who called it in?
BRASS: Tinker Bell and the cheerleader.
They got lost on the way to a party. At first, they thought the body was a fake.
Happy Halloween.
STOKES: Looks like the dog went for his throat.
Yeah.
BRASS: Animal instinct.
Well, his throat is completely ripped open.
Must've bled out.
STOKES: Any I.D.?
Yeah.
Smith &amp; Wesson.
Okay, well...
Gun hasn't been fired.
And a wallet.

STOKES: He's a cop.
K-9 Unit, Officer Mike Nelson.
So you think that's his dog?
So much for man's best friend.
Found something else.
Want to give me some light there?
Okay.
Oh, man.
Well, it looks like methamphetamines, Jim.
So, we got a cop out of uniform in a skanky part of town with a bag of ice.
Something stinks here and I don't think it's the dog.

STOKES: CSI Russell, Sergeant Varanski, chief trainer with the K-9 unit.
Sorry about Officer Nelson.
Is that dog always that aggressive?
Sam? No.
He and Mike were partners for eight years.
Best team in the department.
STOKES: Officer Nelson was out of uniform.
Was he working undercover?
No.
He was off duty last night.
If he was off duty, what was he doing in the alphabets with a bag full of meth?
Mike was a good cop.
They both were.
These dogs are trained to attack, am I right?
They only bite to hold a suspect or to defend themselves.
We're talking about more than just a bite here, Sergeant.
Nelson's throat was ripped open.
Can you think of anything that would set that dog off?
He could be sick.
That would make any dog lash out.
And he could've gotten into Nelson's stash. I mean, look at him.

I'll take him into custody, get him checked out by the vet.
No, no.
No, we have to process him first.
He's got evidence all over him.
STOKES: Yeah, when we're done I'll make sure he gets to you, okay?
Thank you very much.
Appreciate that.

STOKES: Hey.
Brass found Nelson's truck about a block from the crime scene.
Had it towed in.
Find anything?
Yeah.
A piece of the dog's nail, and some dried blood on the window.
Dog clawed his way out.

So, if Nelson was off duty, buying drugs, why bring the dog?
Sergeant told me that the dog lived with Nelson.
Went everywhere with him.
So... for protection?
Well, if that's the case, why would you leave the dog in the truck?
Maybe that's what he was trying to protect.
In a neighborhood like that, you leave your truck, you never know if it's gonna be there when you get back, especially on Halloween.
Department-issued envelope...
...full of cash.
Huh.
Must be at least five grand here.
Could've been stolen from Evidence.
Could be this dog wasn't just going after his partner, he was going after a dirty cop.
Meet Barry Sloan.
Big-shot lawyer.
Lived alone.
But I bet he wasn't lonely.
This place reeks of money.
Professionally decorated, impeccably clean... all to impress the ladies.
Yeah, I've spent some time in bedrooms like this. 
Thought you were into cops.
I do marry cops, but...
I've dated some lawyers.
They're fun to argue with.
Hm.
Boy, they can be sleazy sometimes, though.
Apparently, you're not the only one who thinks so.
Police responded to a 911 call, shots fired.
When they got here, the shower was still running, but Mr. Sloan is bone-dry.
GSW to the chest.
Blood is confined to this area, which means he must've been on the bed or nearby when he was shot.
Shooter missed at least once.
Found a bullet hole in the wall there.
Based on the trajectory, looks like it came from that direction.

Radial cracks indicate that the force must've originated from the outside.

Means our shooter was on the outside of the window.
Who called it in?


Mrs. Young?
Ms.
Ms.
I got tired of being a housewife.
Dumped the husband, kept the last name.
And his Jag.
Oh, lucky you.
I had to pay mine alimony.
FINLAY: So, what exactly did you hear?
Well, I get up early every morning to do my meditation.
I had just reached an elevated state of consciousness when I heard: bang, bang!
So two gunshots in all.
Yeah.
And what time was that?
I looked at the clock.
It was 6:05.
And did you see anything?
Anyone?
Nothing.
But then I had this really bad feeling it had something to do with Barry.
Why do you think it had something to do with Barry?
Mm. A lot of people hated him.
He was a real shark.
Divorce lawyer.
I've known quite a few of those.
One time a brick came flying through my window with a note attached.
It said, &quot;Burn in hell, you scumbag lawyer.&quot;
Meant for Barry but... they got my house by mistake.
So, I guess Mr. Sloan was not very popular in the neighborhood.
Listen, I feel bad about what happened to Barry, but... you ask me, our property values just went up.
That's a horrible thing to say.
The poor man just died.
And how exactly do you know Mr. Sloan?
Oh, um, we've been neighbors for 13 years.
Oh, uh, Marjorie Randall.
Look, when I had my hip replacement, Barry brought in my mail every day.
So you two were good friends?
Oh, yes.
Did he ever discuss his work with you?
Oh, he talked about it all the time.
He loved his job.
Especially when he won a case.
Do you know if he was in the middle of a particularly messy one?
Barry just always said that all divorces were messy.
Do you think that that could've had something to do with his death?
We will do everything we can to find out.

How you doing with Cujo?
I don't know.
He's still pretty riled up.
Well, why don't you wait for Varanski?
He's on his way back.
He'll help you muzzle the dog.
Then you can get your evidence.
By the time he gets here, all the evidence is gonna be gone. Look at him.
Look at him.
He's licking it all away.
Hey, if you're thinking about opening up that cage, we're gonna have another crime scene.
 Maybe he's just threatened by me, you know?
I mean, he's in there, he's cornered, I'm coming at him with sticks.
Open the gate, maybe he'll calm down.
Nick...
Hey, come on. Don't worry.
I had a bunch of dogs growing up-- know what I'm doing.

All right, look, I got Doc Robbins.
Nick, that dog killed somebody.
Wait for Varanski. Please.



Well, boy...


I'm not gonna let you destroy all my evidence.

I'm gonna process you, just like any other suspect, whether you like it or not.
So... here's how it's gonna go down.
I'm gonna let you out of this crate, and when I do, you're gonna be cool... and I'm gonna be cool.

Okay?


Easy.

Easy...
Easy, now.







How about one of these?
Huh?
Want a little treat?
Cooperate, now, okay?

Right in here.
Cooperate.
Right in here, bud.
Easy.

Easy.
You got something in your teeth there.
Easy.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

Well, it looks like you got your pound of flesh, eh?
ROBBINS: When the kids were little, I bought them a dog.
A mutt from the shelter.
He slept on my daughter's bed every night-- part of the family.
Yeah, it's easy to forget they're still animals.
ROBBINS: It's hard to make out the teeth marks.
May have to call in an odontologist.
Well, maybe the saliva will give us the dog's DNA.
You said our victim had drugs on him--
I don't see any needle marks.
Could be a new user.
Maybe the drugs haven't taken their toll yet.
I'll send blood and hair over to Tox.
Multiple cuts and bruises, defensive wounds.
Boy, this guy put up quite a fight.
Why didn't he pull his gun?
I think I know why.
When the dog attacked Nelson, he must have knocked him over.


The angle of the fall broke Nelson's arm in two places, rendering the arm useless.
Well, that explains why he didn't shoot the dog.
One mystery solved.
♪
♪
Hey.
Hit the jackpot.
Yeah?
.38 Special.
Just like the slug we took out of the wall.
That's not all I found: fingerprints on the windowsill.
Killer saw quite a show.
I found semen stains.
No way a guy like Sloan wouldn't wash his sheets, so they're fresh.
And he wasn't alone.
Lipstick?
Mm-hmm.
Maybe Mr. Sloan was sleeping with someone's wife.
Or girlfriend.
Yeah.
His job didn't get him killed, his pen1s did.
You're back from the vet?
Yeah. Yeah, they did a full workup.
The dog's healthy as an ox.
And his tox came back clean, too.
But if there's behavioral issues, there's not much they can do.
Well, I guess that makes him a dead dog walking.
Yeah, unfortunately.
Well, his tox wasn't the only one that came back clean.
No drugs in Officer Nelson's system, either.
Hair analysis proves that he wasn't a regular user.
If he wasn't buying drugs in that part of town, then what was he doing with all that cash in his truck?
I don't know.
But I can tell you that he didn't steal it from evidence.
Money came from his personal bank account.
He made a series of large withdrawals within the last six months.
Well, he was into something.
ANDREWS: Where's the dog?
Animal Control.
ANDREWS: What?
No, they're gonna put him down-- you have to stop them.
Why? What's going on?
The dog is innocent.
He didn't kill his partner.
The saliva on Nelson's throat, it isn't canine; it was human.

BRASS: Start of the zombie apocalypse.
You know, we had a case where a cheerleader, high on PCP, ate another cheerleader's stomach.
Nelson's killer was high on something.
Why was Nelson in a Cracktown, anyway?
He could've been setting someone up, you know, planting evidence to catch a bigger fish, things go south, he gets killed, I don't know.
But not before his partner took a piece out of the killer.
That flesh from the dog's teeth came back to... an unknown male.


I guess Nick sprung him from Animal Control.
Ah, there he is. Sam.
Hey, wha...?
Sorry, he just got away from me.
I can't have him walking around CSI.
I know. Come on.
STOKES: Sam, come on. Come. Hey.
Boy, you have a way with dogs, Stokes.
Hey, this pain in the ass may help us find Nelson's killer.
I mean, he is our only witness.
Aw, no, hey, come on, that's my anniversary gift!
Drop it, Sam.
RUSSELL: That is hand-carved.
One of a kind.
: Drop it!

BRASS: I know he's a highly trained police dog, but how the hell is he gonna help with the case?
He won't even drop an anniversary gift.




Sergeant Varanski.

Hey, Nick.
Hey, man, how's it going?
Good to see you.
Good to see you.
Thanks for clearing his name; you really saved his life.

What you got there?
Huh? What you got, boy?

Say, if it's all right with you, we'd like to hang on to him for a while, see if he can help us track down Officer Nelson's killer.
Sure. If anyone can, it's Sam.
Best nose in the department.
There is one problem, though.
I can't get him to do anything.
He won't even drop that stupid totem pole.
Maybe you're not speaking his language.
No?
What's that, &quot;dog&quot;? I could try barking or something.
French. Sammy was born just outside of Paris.
All the dogs come to us fully trained.
Laisser tomber!

There you go.
Go ahead, take his leash off.
Okay.

Venez!
♪
Asseyez-vous.
Fini.
Guess I better brush up on my French.
Well, that and, uh... earn his respect.
: Right.
Hey.
Hey.
So, you know those... fingerprints I collected outside the vic's windowsill?
Yeah.
Got a hit in AFIS.
Brent Walsh.
A casino worker in the middle of a divorce.
And Mr. Sloan was his lawyer.
MAN: That arrogant, despicable piece of crap.
I take it you weren't satisfied with his services.
I'll say.
He was too busy satisfying my wife.
They were sleeping together?
Sloan is supposed to protect my assets, not hand everything over to that bitch.
That's when I got suspicious.
So you went to Sloan's house last night.
Yeah. I snuck in the side yard and I peeked in the bedroom window.
That's when I saw that scumbag sleeping with the enemy.

BRODY: And then you waited for your ex-wife to leave, and you shot Sloan.
WALSH: No. I don't even own a gun.
I didn't want Sloan... dead. I wanted him... disbarred, unemployed, homeless.
But you were there.
You had motive.
I peeked in the window, and then I left.
Where'd you go?
I went to work.
I'm a blackjack dealer at the Tangiers, graveyard shift.
I checked in at midnight and finished my shift at 8:00.
You can check surveillance.
I will.
Where can I find Mrs. Walsh?
At my house.
With my cat.
And all my stuff.


;
You got something on Officer Nelson?
Yeah. I checked his phone records.
Couple of hours before he died, Nelson got a call from a pay phone around the corner from the crime scene.
Liquor store cam caught a glimpse of our mystery caller.
Judging by the outfit, I'd say she's a working girl.
What's that in her pocket?
RUSSELL: Yellow bandana.
Just like the one we found on Nelson.
I'm thinking he got the drugs from her.
DNA proved that a man killed Nelson, but if she was there, she could be involved, right?
Or, at the very least, a witness.
Okay.
I'll have Brass round up all the hookers in Cracktown that look anything like her; maybe our police dog can pick her out of a lineup.
: Oh, boy.
Ladies... can I have your attention for a second?
Hi. First of all, thank you for coming in.
Did we have a choice?
No, not really.
But I'll get you out of here as soon as I can.
Okay, open up your jars there.
Go ahead, open 'em up.
Yeah, reach in and pull out the pipe, and hold it in your hand.
I'd rather hold on to your pipe.
Uh, thank you, I appreciate that, but my wife frowns on that kind of thing.
Where do you want me to put this?
Just hold on to it.
By doing that, you're transferring your scent onto the pipe.
If I rub it, will it get bigger?
Young lady, as long as you're holding it, I'm happy.
All right, put 'em back in.
Thank you.
Put the lids on.
There you go. Come on.
Look, Sam, I know we got off to a bad start, and I know you miss your partner.
You guys were together a long time. 
But I want the same thing you do-- to catch his killer.
I can't do that without your help.
You understand?
So... want to go to work?
Hey, Sam. How you doing, boy?

Okay. Trouvez.




Recognize this?
Officer Nelson's partner did.
He identified you as the working girl who gave Nelson this bandana, which was full of methamphetamine, by the way.
Hey.
RUSSELL: Carly, we know you called Officer Nelson from a pay phone last night.
We know you met up with him and gave him the drugs.
And then you killed him.
Gave him the drugs, that was it.
Well, why would you do that?
He wasn't a user.
Ms. Green, we know all about you.
We know that Officer Nelson arrested you for possession and prostitution, and sent you to prison for nine months.
Must have hated him for that.
BRASS: So, last night, you lured him downtown and got one of your junkie friends to kill him.
No, that's bull.
Mike was the only person who gave a damn about me.
He even visited me in prison.
Okay, so why did you call him then?
Mike used to pay me for info.
When something new hit the streets, I'd turn it over to him.
Help him go after the dealers.
Are you telling me, you're a C.I.?
You were Officer Nelson's confidential informant?
Yeah.
It was Mike's way of giving me a second chance.
Look, I gave him the drugs, told him what I knew and beat it.
When I left, he was still alive.
What are you doing?
The GCMS is broken, and the repairman's on vacation.
So you're fixing it yourself?
Are you even qualified to do that?
I am a man of many talents.
I'm just saying, defense attorneys love to challenge our findings in court, and if this is not fixed exactly to code, you are gonna be in...
Okay, can... can we just forget the GCMS for a moment?
Can you and I talk about... you know?
No.
So, we're just gonna pretend like it never happened?
Yes.
Now, when you are up and running, I need results on the red smudge on my victim's shirt, please.
Okay.
Okay.

Thanks for stopping in.
Yeah.
So, you and Hodges doing it?
What? No.
I think it's great really.
He's funny, he's charming, smart.
He's like an awkward Jimmy Stewart.
Okay, you know what?
I kissed him.
Once.
Really?
I was at the hospital.
My dad had been shot.
It just happened.
And now things are all awkward between us.

Did you get anything off the gun?
Uh, did not get any prints, but it is definitely our murder weapon.
Striations matched the slug we pulled out of the wall.
And this is where it really gets good.
The gun was registered to Barry Sloan himself.
Shot by his own gun?
Mm.
So, Brent Walsh's alibi checked out.
But he claims that his ex was sleeping with the vic.

Which would give her access to Sloan's house and his gun.
Let's bring her in.
Hey, Doc, got your 911.
What's up?
Body was just brought in.
Fingerprints matched a person of interest in your dead cop case.
Okay, let's take a look.
That's Carly Green.
I interviewed her earlier today.
What-what happened to her?
Found her at the Blue Siren Motel with a needle in her arm.
Apparent overdose.
Yeah.
Heard Hooker Number Four OD'd.
Carly Green.
Detective just logged in the evidence from her motel room.
Lots of condoms, needles.
Live hard, die hard... so to speak.
Bloody bandage.
Did Russell say anything about Carly having other injuries?
No.
Doc's doing her autopsy right now.
But I did find this LVPD envelope.
It looks just like the one we found in Nelson's truck.
There's 800 bucks in there.
Carly Green said Nelson was paying her as a C.I., so I checked with Sergeant Varanski.
Said Nelson hadn't worked Narcotics in over a year.
Well, Nelson must have been paying her from his own pocket.
Unless he was paying her for something else.
I mean, she was a hooker.
She wasn't a thousand dollar a night hooker.
Something was going on between them.
ROBBINS: Carly Green didn't commit suicide.
D.B., take a look.
Needle didn't hit a vein.
RUSSELL: She has track marks.
She was a regular user.
You'd think she'd know how to find a vein.
That's what kept me looking.
Found this.
It's a needle mark right in the middle of her back.
She couldn't do that herself.
So Carly Green was murdered.
Well, there's more.
Ms. Green was also pregnant.
Based on the thickening of the uterus and the size of the fetus, I'd say about ten weeks.
You know, she told me that Officer Nelson was the only person in her life who ever cared for her.
You think he was the father?
Well, he spent a lot of time visiting her in prison, and he was giving her money.
All right.
Let's take a sample of the fetus's DNA.
Have Henry run it.
Absolutely.
All this time, I thought he was a dirty cop.
Well, maybe he just got involved with the wrong woman, trying to make things right.
I didn't have s*x with Barry Sloan.
Yeah, you did... the night he died.
We pulled your DNA off of his... pen1s.
Mrs. Walsh?
All right, I did.
I know it was wrong to sleep with my husband's attorney, but s*x with Barry was...
He just kept you coming back for more.
We have evidence that you were not the only woman who came back for more last night.
 Your DNA had company on his pen1s.
You know, the thing about a three-way is, someone usually ends up being the third wheel.
It wasn't like that.
I had wild s*x with Barry.
When I was looking for my clothes, I found lace panties in his bed.
Not mine.
Then whose?
Barry said he couldn't remember her name.
Some neighbor he was screwing.
And how'd that make you feel?
Not angry enough to kill him, if that's where you're going.
But you were angry.
Ooh, you bet your ass I was.
We got into a big fight.
Then I went home.
What time was that?
Around 5:30, 6:00.
Hm. That's right around the time he was killed.

If you're really hungry, I'll share half my sandwich with you.

No. It's for the dog.
He's not eating for some reason.
Well, he lost his partner, you know?
He's probably still grieving.
Yeah.
Okay, here's where we are.
Henry matched the DNA from the fetus to that piece of flesh that you pulled from your dog's teeth.
So Carly's baby daddy isn't Nelson.
It's the guy who killed him?
That's right. Yeah.
He killed Carly, too.
That bloodied bandage we found in her motel room?
Yup.
Also the killer's DNA.
And that's not all Henry found in the bandage.
Bacteria and leucocytes.
The killer's wound is infected.
From the dog taking a bite out of him.
He's going to need medical attention.
Robbins already checked all the local hospitals and free clinics in the area.
No dog bites reported in the last 24 hours.
Well, there are some back alley clinics near the Blue Siren motel.
What are you gonna do?
You don't have a name.
You don't know who you're looking for.
No... but Sam does.
Hey, Sam?
I got a little something for you... here.


Thank God. Hey, I don't know how he got in here, but you got to get him out.
I know, David.
I'm sorry.
Hey, boy.
Hey.

I should have known I'd find you in here.
You really loved him, huh?
It's hard when you lose a friend.
You know, I lost a friend once.
Partner in the line of duty.
I think it'll always hurt, 'cause... well, I know I'll never see him again.
But you know what you can do for Mike?
Together, you and me... we'll get a little justice.
Sound good?


Did you know that, in a lifetime, the average woman eats four pounds of lipstick?
And that helps our case how?
I confirmed the red smudge on Barry Sloan's shirt as lipstick.
We knew that.
Yes, but did you also know that lipstick, like food, can go bad?
And to preserve its shelf life, cosmetic companies used to use formaldehyde.
There's formaldehyde in my lipstick?
Formaldehyde is a carcinogen, so cosmetic companies these days use metheneamine, which is a different type of preservative.
Okay, so what about the lipstick in our case?
Well, the lipstick in our case contains straight formaldehyde, and was manufactured by a company that went out of business in 1972.
Are you sure the GCMS is working properly?
I fixed it myself.
Oh, whatever you say.
But who wears 40-year-old lipstick?
FINLAY: Mrs. Randall...
Oh, call me Marjorie.
Marjorie, you told me that you and Barry Sloan were good friends.
That's right.
Good enough to have left lipstick on his shirt?
CSI's are searching your house right now, and when they compare your lipstick to the smudge on Barry's shirt, I'm... betting it's gonna match.
Lots of women wear lipstick.
This sample was much older than all of the women that Barry was sleeping with.
Were the two of you intimately involved?
My husband left me ten years ago, for a younger woman.
I never thought I'd fall in love again.

Till I met Barry.
For years, I never told him how I felt.
He always had some beautiful woman on his arm.
But the other morning, I heard him arguing with one of them.
Look, I never said we were exclusive.
You made me think we were.
Come on, okay?
We've been having fun.
You really are a scumbag, you know that?
Go to hell.
She was so mean to him.
So you saw an opportunity to make your move.
Well, I wanted him to know that he was... appreciated.
That he was loved.
Marjorie.
Everything all right?
I heard you arguing with that woman.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.
Oh, no, no, you didn't.
I just wanted to make sure that you're okay.
You are so sweet.
I don't deserve you.
Mmm...
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What the hell are you doing!
I thought that...
You're kidding, right?
Hey, come on, you're old enough to be my mother. 
He humiliated me.
: Just like my husband.
And you've been carrying that anger and that pain for all those years since your husband left.
So when Barry rejected you... you snapped.


Marjorie, we know that the gun was Barry's.
How did you get it?
He gave it to me.
There'd been some break-ins in the neighborhood, and he wanted me to be safe.
I just wanted to be loved.
Is that so bad?

The clinics down here fly under the radar.
If you can call them that-- no licensed doctors, no nurses, no questions asked.
BRASS: Well, whatever you want to call it, we're down to our last two.
Only could be the dog's lost his mojo.
Well, he can do this.

That's it.
Trouvez.
Go on.


He's got something.

BRASS : Great, he wants a burrito.
No, no.
Hang on a second.





That's him!
Police! Stop!

STOKES: Move! Move!
BRASS : Shots fired!
Officer in pursuit! Send backup!



STOKES: Hey!




Get him off me!
I didn't do nothin'!
I don't know, I'm kind of new at this whole dog thing.
Let me see, uh, hmm-- release him.
 Get him off me!
STOKES: No, no-- drop him?
No, uh, it's...
STOKES: Hmm...

Laisser tomber.


You see, the dog over there thinks that you killed his partner, Officer Nelson.

You know what I think?
I think he's right.

You're under arrest for murder.
Take this scumbag to the hospital, then book him.
Good job, Fido.
STOKES: Hey, Sammy.


Oui. Tres bien.

Good boy.
Good...


I need a little help here, boys!

Okay, sign it.
Sign it.

Did you get a confession?
Vinnie was a regular songbird.
He wanted Carly to get rid of the baby, so she went to Nelson for help.
Well, Vinnie followed her.
He sees them.
He's loaded on meth amphetamine, he's tweaking out of his mind, he kills Nelson right in front of her.
Poor Carly.
Too scared to talk to us.
Vinnie couldn't take the chance, so he kills her.
And her baby.
STOKES: I don't know; I'm still waiting.
He's been in there for a couple hours.
Nah, nah, I'm okay.
Hey, listen, I got to go.
I'll call you back, okay?
All right.
So?
How's he doing?
Sam made it through surgery.
And?
Vet said he's going to be okay.

Wow.
Well, that's-that's good.
I didn't even know Sam had been shot.
He just kept going.
Mm. That's Sam for you.
Ah, here he is.
Hey, how you doing, boy?
Huh?
You did it, Sam.
You caught Mike's killer.
He's going to prison for a very long time.
And we got some justice.
But don't you ever scare me like that again, you hear me?
You know, uh...
Sam was going to retire at the end of the year, spend the rest of his days with Nelson, just being a dog.
Nelson didn't have any family, so, uh, Sam's going to need a new home.
Well, I guess he could come live with me.
That'd be nice.
What do you say, Sam?
I'll take good care of you.
Now, there's gonna be a few rules, okay?
No drinking out of the toilet, and, uh, we watch football on Sundays, and we root for the Cowboys.

Okay?
And when my girlfriend's over, you got to sleep on the floor.
All right? Is that a deal?

Okay, boy.
Ah, geez!

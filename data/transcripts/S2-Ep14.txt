[INT. BANK - DAY]</p>
<p>(ROY LOGAN walks into the bank. He takes off his sunglasses and looks around. He's carrying a metal briefcase and appears to be very nervous. He glances up at the security camera, then approaches the bank teller.)</p>
<p><strong>Teller</strong>: Good afternoon.</p>
<p>(ROY LOGAN puts his metal briefcase down.)</p>
<p><strong>Roy Logan</strong>: I need to ... uh ... make a withdrawal.</p>
<p>(He places a withdrawal slip on the counter. It's dated 1-30-02 and for the amount of one million dollars ($1,000,000). There's a red smudge of blood on the bottom right corner of the slip.)</p>
<p>(The teller takes the withdrawal slip.)</p>
<p><strong>Teller</strong>: I'll need to see some identification.</p>
<p>(ROY LOGAN nervously clears his throat and reaches for his wallet. He takes out a Nevada Driver's License and puts it on the counter. The teller glances down at the license. She picks it up and turns to her monitor.)</p>
<p><strong>Roy Logan</strong>: There's sufficient funds in my account.</p>
<p><strong>Teller</strong>: Just have to clear it with my manager.</p>
<p>(He picks up his metal briefcase and drops it flat on the counter, startling the teller.)</p>
<p><strong>Roy Logan</strong>: Is that going to take long?</p>
<p><strong>Teller</strong>: I'll be right back.</p>
<p>(The teller leaves ROY LOGAN and meets with her manager. She interrupts him while he meets with another client where they have an indistinct conversation in the back. The client walks away. The TELLER and the MANAGER glance over at ROY LOGAN. The conversation in the back continues. ROY LOGAN looks nervous and impatient.)</p>
<p><strong>Roy Logan</strong>: (yells) Is there a problem here?!</p>
<p><strong>Manager</strong>: It's a lot of money, Mr. Logan. It's going to take some time.</p>
<p>(ROY LOGAN nods his head and looks down at the ground. He's trying to be patient. He glances up at the bank's clock. 4:50 p.m. He breathes out. He glances at the security camera again.)</p>
<p>(Cut to Security Camera black and white POV of ROY LOGAN at the counter with a time stamp on the bottom right corner: 4:50 PM.)</p>
<p>(Dissolve to same Security Camera POV with time stamp reading: 5:14 PM. ROY LOGAN hands the metal briefcase to the manager over the counter.)</p>
<p>(Dissolve to time stamp reading: 5:22 PM. ROY LOGAN impatiently glances at his watch.)</p>
<p>(Dissolve to time stamp reading: 5:36 PM. ROY LOGAN is still waiting for the briefcase.)</p>
<p>(Dissolve to time stamp reading: 5:49 PM.)</p>
<p>RESUME TO REGULAR CAMERA VIEW:</p>
<p>(Cut to Close up of the MANAGER'S hands stacking the bills into the briefcase. He finishes and closes the case. ROY LOGAN sighs with relief. The MANAGER puts the case on the counter in front of ROY LOGAN.)</p>
<p><strong>Manager</strong>: Mr. Logan, would you like an escort to your car?</p>
<p>(ROY LOGAN doesn't say anything. He takes the case off the counter and leaves.)</p>
<p>(Cut to top view of ROY LOGAN walking toward the front door. The security guard opens the doors for him.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. PARKING LOT OUTSIDE BANK - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(ROY LOGAN walks out along the sidewalk and to his car. He's just about to get into his car when he turns and sees a police car in the background. We can hear the indistinct sounds of the police radio transmissions.)</p>
<p>(ROY LOGAN pauses for a moment, then opens his car door and gets inside. He puts the metal briefcase on the passenger seat next to him. He closes the door and starts his engine. The tires screech as he reverses out of the parking stall.)</p>
<p>(As he exits the parking lot, the police car in the background turns into the bank's parking lot. The sirens and lights turned on, the police car follows.)</p>
<p>(ROY LOGAN goes out the other exit and is blocked by a parked car in front of him. Sandwiched between the cars, one in front and the other behind him, he slams on the breaks. He hits his steering wheel with his hands in frustration.)</p>
<p>(The POLICE OFFICER gets out of his car and cautiously approaches ROY LOGAN.)</p>
<p><strong>Police Officer</strong>: Everything all right, sir?</p>
<p>(ROY LOGAN'S cell phone starts to ring. The POLICE OFFICER glances at the phone in the car.)</p>
<p><strong>Police Officer</strong>: Do you want to get that?</p>
<p>(ROY LOGAN doesn't move to answer the phone. The POLICE OFFICER looks inside the car and notices the blood on ROY LOGAN'S hands.)</p>
<p><strong>Police Officer</strong>: I think you should step out of the car. Keep your hands where I can see them. Let's go. </p>
<p>(The POLICE OFFICER opens ROY LOGAN'S car door. ROY LOGAN gets out of the car with his hands raised. He doesn't say anything and stands against the wire fence.)</p>
<p><strong>Police Officer</strong>: Up.</p>
<p>(Camera focuses briefly on ROY LOGAN'S frustrated look and then to the dried blood stains on the palms of his hands.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT -- HALLWAY]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and GRISSOM walk through the hallway to the interrogation room. They're both carrying their kits.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So how rich is this guy?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, he had a million dollars in his checking account.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Who doesn't?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He's a real estate developer. On the mayor's committee to revitalize downtown.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And he hasn't said a word to anyone?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Nope. That's why we're here.</p>
<p>(They open the door to the room.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(ROY LOGAN sits at the table. He looks up when the door opens. GRISSOM and CATHERINE walk in. They set their kits down at the back of the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Roy Logan</strong>: No... I'm not saying anything without my lawyer.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns around and continues to get ready.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You don't have to say anything.</p>
<p>(They both put on their latex gloves.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mr. Logan ... would you please put your hands out? Palms up.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE opens a bottle. ROY LOGAN puts the glasses that he was fiddling with down on the table. He nervously looks up at the wall clock. It reads 6:20 pm. He holds out his hands. Palms up.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE swabs his left palm then caps the swab tip.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm also going to need you to strip.</p>
<p><strong>Roy Logan</strong>: What?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks down at ROY LOGAN. ROY LOGAN looks over at GRISSOM. GRISSOM shrugs.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Vegas.</p>
<p>(Camera holds on ROY LOGAN'S confused look.)</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO: END OF TEASER. ROLL TITLE CREDITS.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT -- INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE snaps a photo of MR. LOGAN'S bare back.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Thank you, Mr. Logan. You can put your shirt down. Left arm out, please. </p>
<p>(ROY LOGAN sighs. He holds out his left arm. CATHERINE looks at it. She take a picture of it. Behind them, GRISSOM is looking through ROY LOGAN'S clothes.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Right arm. </p>
<p>(ROY LOGAN drops his left arm and holds out his right arm. CATHERINE again looks at it then takes a picture.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No visible injuries.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No blood on his clothes.</p>
<p><strong>Roy Logan</strong>: How long is this going to take?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM holds out ROY LOGAN'S clothes. ROY LOGAN takes them from him. The clock on the back wall reads: 6:30 PM.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sorry for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>(ROY LOGAN puts his clothes down on the table intending to put them back on. The door opens and PAUL, ROY LOGAN'S ATTORNEY, walks in.)</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: What the hell is going on here?</p>
<p><strong>Roy Logan</strong>: Paul, get me out of here, now.</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: Roy, put your clothes back on. Don't say another word to these people. (to the CSIs) I'm taking my complaint directly to the District Attorney. You had no grounds to detain Mr. Logan let alone disrobe him.</p>
<p>(PAUL hands GRISSOM a business card. ROY LOGAN hurriedly puts on his clothes. GRISSOM looks at the card.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: His hands were covered in blood and he had a million dollars in his briefcase.</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: It's not a crime to be rich.</p>
<p><strong>Roy Logan</strong>: Where's my car?</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: It's right up front. My secretary drove it here. </p>
<p>(ROY LOGAN grabs his cell phone, picks up the metal briefcase and follows PAUL out the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: (to GRISSOM) You're going to be hearing from us.</p>
<p>(The two men leave.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Didn't Shakespeare say &quot;let's kill all the lawyers&quot;?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah. Henry VI. Where is he when we need him?</p>
<p>[Quote Note: William Shakespeare's, The Second Part of King Henry the Sixth, Act IV, Scene 2: Dick the Butcher: The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers. ]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE puts on her coat. She hands something to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah. Hey, can you do me a favor and drop this off at the lab? I'm due at a nursery rhyme recital. Lindsey's going to play the girl in the moon.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What happen to the man in the moon?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: He got the mumps.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE picks up her case and heads toward the door. She glances back at the room and notices that ROY LOGAN left his sunglasses on the table.)</p>
<p>(She sighs and heads to pick them up.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - PARKING LOT -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE exits the building. She sees ROY LOGAN unlocking his car door and heads toward him.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mr. Logan!</p>
<p>(His car alarm chirps and he has his car door open. He puts his case down and turns around. CATHERINE waves his sunglasses at him.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You forgot your sunglasses.</p>
<p>(She walks over to him and holds it out.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Service-oriented policing.</p>
<p>(ROY LOGAN shuts the car door closed and turns angrily to CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Roy Logan</strong>: You don't understand. Get away from me.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE doesn't say anything. She puts the sunglasses in his left breast pocket and turns to leave. His cell phone rings. CATHERINE lingers.)</p>
<p>(ROY LOGAN reaches into his jacket and answers it.)</p>
<p><strong>Roy Logan</strong>: Hello. </p>
<p>(He pauses and listens. CATHERINE still hasn't moved. He turns to her and looks at her. He holds the phone out to her.)</p>
<p><strong>Roy Logan</strong>: It's for you.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What? </p>
<p>(CATHERINE takes the phone from ROY LOGAN.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (on phone) Hello</p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong>: (high-pitched and altered) Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to phone) CSI three Willows. Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong>: (over phone) Are you a cop?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to phone) Criminalist.</p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong>: (over phone) Good. Because if you had been a cop she'd already be dead.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to phone) Who would be dead?</p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong>: (over phone) Do you have a weapon?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to phone) Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong>: (over phone) Then put it on the ground, along with your pager, cell phone and that case you're holding.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to phone) Who is this?</p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong>: (over phone) Do it! We're watching you, CSI three Willows. Attempt to go back into the police station and we'll kill her. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks around and doesn't see anything or anyone. She slowly puts her kit down on the ground.)</p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong>: (over phone) Attempt to contact any coworkers and we'll kill her. Any false moves at all, and Amanda is dead. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE reaches into her coat pocket and takes out her cell phone and puts it on the case. She looks around again.)</p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong>: (over phone) Now get back in the car. You drive, anywhere but here and await my next call.</p>
<p>(The person on the other end hangs up. CATHERINE pulls the cell phone away from her ear and closes it.)</p>
<p><strong>Roy Logan</strong>: What did he say? Is Amanda all right?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE grabs the keys from ROY LOGAN.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Let's talk in the car.</p>
<p>(ROY LOGAN looks at CATHERINE for a very brief moment, then grabs his metal briefcase and heads for the passenger side of the car. CATHERINE opens the driver door. She gets in, starts the engine, then drives off.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM exits the building. He's surprised to see CATHERINE driving ROY LOGAN'S car. He watches the car exit the parking lot. He puts his kit down and pulls out his cell phone. He dials and listens as it rings.)</p>
<p>(From somewhere to the left of him, he hears the chirp of a cell phone. He turns and sees CATHERINE'S stuff on the parking lot ground. He pulls the phone away from his ear, thoroughly concerned.)</p>
<p>FLASH TO WHITE.</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI -- LAB]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM grabs his file from the reception area in the hallway and heads toward GREG. Through the glass, GREG sees GRISSOM and motions for him to come talk to him.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What'd you find?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: The blood's female. Definitely not Logan's.</p>

[INT. CSI - HALLWAY]</p>
<p>(BRASS and GRISSOM walk through the hallway.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I ran Roy Logan. No criminal record; no wants; no warrants.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The blood on his hand was female.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The guy's married. He lives in Summerlin. He bucks up; got a seven year-old son. But I'll check him out.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What about the car?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Code five: Keep vehicle under surveillance; do not make contact with occupants. You know, Catherine had a gun. She could've used it.</p>

<p>(The car speeds down the street.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You never answered my question. Who's Amanda?</p>

<p>(CATHERINE turns and looks over at ROY LOGAN, disapproval written all over her face.)</p>
<p><strong>Roy Logan</strong>: Yeah. I know, I know. My, uh, my wife doesn't know.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Somebody does. How did they make contact?</p>
<p>(ROY LOGAN opens something. CATHERINE watches.)</p>
<p><strong>Roy Logan</strong>: I, uh, I probably left a dozen messages for her and, um, she, uh, never called me back so I went over to the condo ... to the condo and, uh ... this was waiting for me on the bed. I ... uh ...</p>
<p>(ROY LOGAN holds out a small Altoid's shaped metal container with a severed index finger in it. CATHERINE looks at the finger for a long moment. A car horn beeps drawing CATHERINE'S attention back to driving.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Got your attention. </p>
<p><strong>Roy Logan</strong>: My cell phone rang; it was the kidnapper. He said, uh, he wanted a million dollars in cash by the end of the day, or he would ... he would send me the rest of her. He said if I ... talked to he cops ... </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, I heard that part. I need a drink.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: This is nice.</p>
<p><strong>Hank Peddigrew</strong>: I don't normally date women from work but there was ... something about you. And it definitely wasn't your perfume.</p>
<p>(SARA laughs and coughs.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I cannot believe you brought that up.</p>
<p>(Cut to CATHERINE and ROY LOGAN getting out of the car just outside the diner.)</p>
<p>(Cut back to SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah, that-that-that, uh, day we met that-that was, that was very gross. </p>
<p>(Cut to CATHERINE and ROY LOGAN crossing the street toward the diner.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Um... I mean, not for me but for everyone else ... for you ...</p>
<p>(The door to the diner opens. CATHERINE and ROY LOGAN walk in. SARA and HANK occupy the first booth closest to the door. SARA definitely notices that it's CATHERINE.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE doesn't acknowledge SARA. She and ROY LOGAN take two seats at the counter. SARA watches them walk by.)</p>
<p><strong>Hank Peddigrew</strong>: Isn't that one of your coworkers?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. DINER - COUNTER - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE grabs a menu off the counter.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We don't know how long it's going to be before he calls. Why don't you order something?</p>
<p><strong>Roy Logan</strong>: You expect me to eat? We should be in the car, waiting by the phone.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I have the phone. Do us both a favor: Relax.</p>

[INT. CSI - GRISSOM'S OFFICE]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM sits behind his desk. WARRICK and NICK stand in front of it.)</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Catherine wouldn't have left her stuff behind.</p>
<p>(BRASS appears in the doorway.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hey. I sent a patrolman to Logan's house. Talked to Mrs. Logan. She's in perfect health. She's not our vic.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: 'Cause I think your evidence got contaminated.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mrs. Logan, do you know Amanda Freeman? Because she called you on your cell phone the day she was murdered.</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: Could have been a wrong number.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Then, uh, what did you talk about for three minutes and fifty-five seconds?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We could compel a DNA sample which would confirm that you had a glass of wine with her that night.</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: Is it your intention to charge my client with Miss Freeman's kidnapping?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I think you went to your husband's townhouse -- a townhouse you probably didn't know he had - and a civilized drink turned into a violent brawl.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to the two women fighting. AMANDA FREEMAN gets hit and falls down. She hits her head on the table before hitting the floor. End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You tore down the shower curtain wrapped the body in it.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to AMANDA FREEMAN'S body on the shower curtain and DIANE LOGAN wrapping her up in it. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Cut off her finger, stuck it in a mint tin and left it for your husband.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You transported the body to the reservoir in the back of your SUV where some of your son's PB and J made it onto the shower curtain.</p>
<p><strong>Diane Logan</strong>: Are you finished?</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: Diane?</p>
<p><strong>Diane Logan</strong>: I had my drink with Miss Freeman. I listened to her rantings about how she and Roy were getting married.</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: That's enough, Diane.</p>
<p><strong>Diane Logan</strong>: And I set her straight. Roy was not going to leave me for her. He loved his money more than both of us. I told her I was going to evict her from that tacky little townhouse and then Roy came in. You should have seen the look on his face. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to DIANE LOGAN turning around to find ROY LOGAN in the doorway. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Diane Logan</strong>: And I-I left them there to work it out.</p>

<p>(BRASS turns off the room lights.)</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: We don't have time for these games. Okay, you satisfied?</p>
<p>(PAUL reaches up to pull DIANE LOGAN'S hands away from the table when GRISSOM immediately spots it.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Whoa!</p>
<p>(GRISSOM reaches over and pulls PAUL'S hand over the light where we see the glo-stick marker all over the palms of his hands.)</p>

<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>

[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT -- INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(The rabbit mask hits the table. PAUL nervously takes off his glasses.)</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: Look, I put on a mask I made some phone calls I took the money but I did not break any laws.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You killed Amanda Freeman.</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: Oh, no. I didn't kill anybody. I didn't even know she was dead. I'm a lawyer. I work for my client. I did what he asked me to do.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Your client?</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: Roy Logan.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What are you saying? That Mr. Logan paid you to dress up as a bunny rabbit?</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: That was my idea.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So, Roy Logan set this whole thing up?</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: Yes. It started with a phone call. I just did what my client asked. I just played a part.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to PAUL in his car putting on the rabbit mask and holding a presumably fake rifle. Flash to white. ROY LOGAN handing the metal briefcase to PAUL. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, basically, this was a stage play written by Mr. Logan.</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: That's right. Now you got it.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: During this elaborate farce you never thought to ask him why he was making you jump through these hoops?</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: I don't get paid to ask. I get paid to do. </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What about the money? A million dollars cash? </p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: Well, Roy was having marital problems so I figured he was just hiding his assets.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Where's the money now?</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: In a locker. </p>
<p>(PAUL puts the locker key on the table.)</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'll call down, see if his car's in the parking lot.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You got to admit, his solution was ingenious.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to AMANDA FREEMAN on the ground, dead. ROY LOGAN sitting on the couch thinking about his next move.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) Most killers take their time planning a murder. He took his time covering it up. </p>

<p>(ROY LOGAN taking down the shower curtain liner. ROY LOGAN kneeling down and cutting AMANDA FREEMAN'S finger off. Flash to white. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So Logan cleans up the crime scene and calls his lawyer. Asks him to help him with his little charade. I mean, what better way to protect your assets than to pay a kidnapper who's already on retainer?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Everything from that point on was calculated. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to ROY LOGAN making sure that there's blood on his hands. Flash to white.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) Blood on his hands ... </p>

<p>(Quick flashback to CATHERINE on the cell phone with the kidnapper. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: He practically forced that money into his lawyer's hands.</p>

<p>(Quick flashback to ROY LOGAN chasing after the kidnapper and handing the briefcase to him at Horseshoe Tavern. Resume to present.)</p>

<p>(Quick flashback to ROY LOGAN asking ... )</p>
<p><strong>Roy Logan</strong>: When? Where?</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Why make the map? Why lead Catherine to the body?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Because without the body, Logan would always be under suspicion.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: If not by the police, by his wife.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So, he left these wine glasses for you to find.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Sure, we wanted us to suspect the wife. That's why he used her SUV </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to AMANDA FREEMAN'S body wrapped in the shower curtain being dragged into the SUV'S back seat.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) to transport the body. </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And he let me mark the money because he knew that eventually his lawyer would touch it.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I saw the locker </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to inside the locker at the Country Club and to someone trying to fit the large metal briefcase into it. PAUL taking the money out of the briefcase and stacking it inside the locker. His hands are all over the money.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) ... and I saw Logan's briefcase. It was too big to fit inside. His lawyer had to remove the cash by hand.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: How could he possibly know that Catherine was going to mark the money?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: He didn't. He probably thought the bank marked it.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Besides, there's always fingerprints.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So I did everything in my power to help him.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, and he's probably long gone by now.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE'S cell phone starts ringing. She answers it.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Willows. (pause) Yeah.</p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH:</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: That's a beautiful car, that SC-430. Don't get to see a nice car like that in these parts too often. So when I see one twice in two days, I notice. Especially when the driver's exceeding the speed limit.</p>

<p><strong>Roy Logan</strong>: You know, with all that money on my lap we could've driven to Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: That's right. You're short one mistress. I got to hand it to you that was a brilliant performance. But then again, any man who juggles a wife and mistress and god knows what else has to be a pro.</p>
<p><strong>Roy Logan</strong>: I don't know. You get so used to lying you figure, what's one more?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Try explaining that to your son.</p>

Vasco Ruiz:  Sí, ya se, ya se. No me reganes mas. Sí, sí. Comida para el bebe. Sí, pan, leche. Mira, cariño, ahorita vengo.

Vasco Ruiz:  Te quiero. 
 

Drunk:  Danke schoen / Oh, darling / danke schoen / danke schoen, oh, darling / danke schoen / thank you for all the joy and pain ... 
 

 




 
 
 
Brass: The vic had nothing on him but his casino ID. Name is Vasco Ruiz. He's a dishwasher here at the Golden Sapphire.
 
Brass: My guess he got off his shift, went to his car, got whacked.
Catherine: By what?
Brass: A blender?
 
Grissom: Surveillance?
Brass: Not in the employee structure.
Grissom: Witnesses?
Brass: Well, we found a Wayne Newton impersonator, but all I could get him to do was sing a few bars of &quot;Danke Schoen&quot;. But no wallet no cash, no cell phone, no car keys. Smells like a robbery.
Catherine: Maybe it was his payday.
Grissom: Even if this guy was walking out of here with a million dollars ... this is way more than excessive.
Catherine: Personal.
Brass: Yeah, I'm gonna go get personal with his boss. See what he knows.
 

 
 
 



 

 
FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS




 
 
 

 
Dispatch:  
Officer: Got a 4-15, we gotta go.
 
 


 


 
Warrick:  You got a name?
Brass: She's not talking.
Warrick: What about ID?
Brass: He must've taken her wallet.
Warrick: Cell phone?
Brass: It's not here; they took it. Somebody had to see something.
 
Warrick: Hey.
Nick: Hi.
 
Warrick: Well, we got a souvenir cup that screams &quot;tourist.&quot;
Nick:  Yep.
Warrick: I don't see a bar anywhere around here. She must've been either going to or coming from the strip.
 
Nick: But she shouldn't have been walking around here, Warrick. Couldn't pick a shadier part of town, man.
Warrick: You know these tourists don't know what they're getting when they book a trip to Vegas online. 
 
Warrick: They think &quot;I got a room on the strip for 75 bucks. Whoo, what a deal.&quot;
Nick: Then they mosey through the naked city with their thousand dollar cameras.
 
Nick: Next thing you know, we're taking their picture.
Warrick: You know what? Grissom's crime scene is just five blocks from here. Both victims had their wallets and their cell phones stolen. And they were both beaten down in the same way.
Nick: Looks like someone's on a little crime spree.

 
 
Catherine: Uh, David, hang on.
 
David: Looks like a woman's toenail.
Catherine: Well, it's not necessarily a woman's.

 
 
 
 
Sara: Jessica ... this might hurt a little bit, but it's going to help us get the people who did this to you.
 
Sara: I'm sorry. Thank you.
 
Sara: Do you have any other injuries?
Jessica Hershbaum: Yeah. On my left side. Ow.

Sara: Could you lift your left arm for me, please?

Sara: Thank you.
 
Jessica Hershbaum: I just got out of a ten-year relationship. So I decided to take a solo trip to Vegas. You know, try the whole &quot;What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.&quot;
 
Sara: Been there.
Jessica Hershbaum: Yeah, well, I get to take this face back with me.

Jessica Hershbaum: Well, did anybody else get hurt?
Sara: Why do you ask?
Jessica Hershbaum: I heard them say that I was number two. Was there a number one?
Sara: There was.
Jessica Hershbaum: How are they doing?
Sara: He died.

 
 
 




 
 

Catherine: All right, slick. Now what's with the suit?
Greg:  Today was my first jury trial. 
Catherine: Today ended ...  ... an hour and a half ago.
Greg: Well, maybe I just don't want the day to end.
Catherine: Well, if that's the case, why don't you help my day end quicker and help me isolate some shoe treads.  Take the pants.
 
Catherine: So ... ? How'd you do on the stand?
Greg: So good the prosecutor took me to dinner.
Catherine: Female?
Greg: Yeah, she was icing.  I was just happy to finally see a case from the crime scene to the courtroom. We freakin' buried the guy. It was bad ass. I dropped the hammer ... he was squirming in his chair.
Catherine: How many different patterns you have there?
Greg: Five different patterns.
 
Catherine: Well, I've got three different ones on the t-shirt.
 
Catherine: I mean, this one that looks like an athletic shoe sure got around. As did this pointed toe high-heeled one. Check out the heel mark.
Greg: So did this work boot.
Catherine:  What do you know about work boots? I'm guessing you haven't worked a day of hard labor in your life.
Greg: I wore Doc Martens in high school. It was the style.
Catherine: Yeah, for skinheads.
Greg: Yeah, they kind of ruined it for everyone.
Catherine: You know, one of the victims was Hispanic, the other was Jewish. Maybe this was a hate crime.
 
Greg: Sure looks like hate to me.

 
 
Robbins: Vasco Ruiz was someone's punching bag. He suffered multiple abrasions, lacerations, contusions. I found no particular patterns, sharp edges or tool marks from any weapons.
Grissom: Do fists and feet count?
Robbins: He had too many bruises to count, one on top of another. And under the skin, things get even worse.
INSERT: CSI ENHANCEMENT
 
Robbins: Long bone fractures of the fingers, radius, ulna, humerus.
 
Robbins:  Rib fractures, flail chest. Fractures of the vault and base of skull. Almost every bone in his face.
 
BACK TO SCENE.
Robbins: Somewhere along the way, he took a shot to the head that resulted in a subdural hematoma. COD is multiple blunt force trauma.
Grissom: Could one person have done this?
Robbins:  Not even Mike Tyson.


 
 
Liquor Store Owner:  Okay, okay, okay, they took my good vodkas, my single-malt whiskies, they took vermouth, cognac, VSOP cognac. Am I going to get any of the stuff back? What are you guys going to do about this?
Sofia: Okay, slow down. You're talking too fast.
Liquor Store Owner: All right, you know what? Just let me know when you're ready.
Sofia: I'm ready, sir, I just, I just need you to talk slower.
Liquor Store Owner: Okay, I can do that. These creeps come flying in here -- they take a lot of my good stuff. And I chased one of them and I snatched the sweater right off his back.
Sofia: How many did you see?
Liquor Store Owner: I don't know. There was a bunch.
Sofia: A bunch. Two? Five? Ten?
Liquor Store Owner: Closer to the ten.
Sofia: Any descriptions?
Liquor Store Owner: They had hoods on. They were hooded.
Sofia: You took the sweater off one of them and you didn't get to see what he looked like?
Liquor Store Owner: He was on his way out the door. What I did see was really weird. Anyway.
Sofia: What does &quot;weird&quot; look like?
Liquor Store Owner: I don't know. His face. His nose was all deformed. The whole thing creeped me out.
Sofia: Thank you.

 
 
Tech: Way to go.
Greg: Thank you.
 
Grissom: Greg ... lose the monkey suit, you got a scene; liquor store robbery. Here's the address.
 
Greg: Related to the earlier 415s?
Grissom: Could be -- Sofia's got one of the suspect's sweaters. I need you to seal it, bring it back here and anything you can find.
Greg: All right. Who's my wingman?
Grissom: You're a big boy, Greg. You don't need a wingman for this.
 
Greg: Primary.  Nice.
 

 

 

 
 
Grissom: Whoa! Pick on somebody you're own size.
 
Sara: Are you volunteering?
 
Grissom: No.
 
Sara: The two scenes are related. I found two common treads on both vics: an athletic shoe and a boot. I ran them through the SoleMate database. The athletic shoe ... is a converse Chuck Taylor and the boot is a Doc Marten.
 
 
Grissom: Could this be a woman's shoe?
Sara: Yeah, I ran that through the SoleMate database, too. That is a Steve Madden Dynasti Stiletto. Open-toe shoe.
Grissom: 'Cause Catherine found a broken female toenail in the vic's mouth.
INSERT: FLASHBACK
 
BACK TO SCENE.
Sara: Most of the treads are on the sides and back of the victim's clothing.
Grissom: Which suggests that they were on the ground for most of the beating.
Sara: Kicked to death.

 
 
Lucita Ruiz: How am I going to feed my boys?! Pay the rent, gas, car? God ...
Brass: Mrs. Ruiz, I'll do the best I can. I'll put you in touch with state services that'll help you deal with these issues, okay? But right now I need your help to do my job. I need some information, okay?
Lucita Ruiz:  Whatever you need.
Brass: All right. When was the last time you talked to Vasco?
Lucita Ruiz: Midnight. He calls me every night after work.
Brass: Did he have any enemies that you know of?
Lucita Ruiz: No. He was a good man with a good heart. No one disliked him.
Brass: Okay. Did he carry a wallet or a cell phone?
Lucita Ruiz: He had both.
Brass: I want you to write down his cell phone number on this piece of paper, okay? I need to access his records.
 

 
Brass: Hey, guys, this officer's going to take you and your mom home, make sure you all get home safe, okay? 
Lucita Ruiz: Thank you.
 
Reporter:  I'm standing across from the Holiday Motel where a brutal beating just occurred a few hours ago. We have the footage which was recorded by an anonymous bystander's cell phone. 
 
Reporter:  Although the quality is poor, you can see several images assaulting the lone female victim. Anyone living near the strip is being told to stay at home until the assailant is caught. For anyone who has any information, please call 555-0155.
 
Brass: Get this reporter on the phone.


 
 
 

 
Greg:  Control, control, this is CSI Sanders. I need some help.
Control:  Control, go with your information.
Greg:  Okay, I got an assault in progress one alley south of Casino Central Drive, cross street Shane.
Control:  How many suspects involved?
Greg:  Multiple suspects. Could be the guys who've been doing it all night.
Control:  The closest unit has a five-minute ETA. Rolling code three. Are they armed?
 
Greg:  I don't know. I don't know. Ma'am, please, listen. You got to get here quicker than this.
Dispatch:  Copy that. We'll roll two additional units ASAP. Wait for backup.
 

 
Greg: Move!

Greg:  Get out of here!
 
 

 

 
SMASH!

CRASH!

Marla James: Please let me see Demetrius. I just want to talk to him.
Sofia: I'm sorry. It's a crime scene. I can't let you pass. I'm sorry.
Marla James:  He's not dead, is he?
 
Sofia: He's been badly injured, but he's being attended to, I promise you.
 
Sofia: Hey.
Sara: Hey. 
 
Sara: Why isn't there a medic on Greg?
Sofia: He's been stabilized. Sara, he's going to be okay.
 
 
Greg:  Sara ... 
Sara: I didn't think you could see me.
Greg: I can't ... but I know that Sidle scent.
Sara: I'm going to take that as a compliment.
 
Greg:  I scratched one of them.
 
Greg: And you should check my vest. I think the same guy s-spit on me. 
 
Greg: And one of their cars crashed into the Denali. I guarantee there's transfer on it. 
 
Greg: You should process the scene now. Me later.
Sara: I came here for you, Greg.

 
 
Brass: So how long you been in town, Mr. Tanner?
Stanley Tanner: About twenty hours, man.
Brass: You on vacation?
Stanley Tanner: Straight from Union City, Tennessee.
Brass: Okay, tell me what happened.
Stanley Tanner: Well, I was cutting through that alley trying to find a taxi off one of them side streets. Next thing I know I'm on the ground just getting pounded all to hell. I thought I was gonna die. Even give it up to the man. Then I heard that horn honking and engine revving toward me.
 
Brass: Can you give me any descriptions?
 
Brass: Okay. All right. You take it easy.
Stanley Tanner: Could you do me a favor?
Brass: Sure, I'll do my best.
Stanley Tanner: The man that saved my life, I'd like to meet him, give him a thank you.
Brass: His name is Greg Sanders. And I'm sure he'd appreciate it. I'll tell him.

 
 
 
Warrick: I think I just found a piece of Sanders' hair.
 
Cole Tritt: So what, did somebody else get a beat down?
 
Cole Tritt: You bitches haven't caught them cats yet?
Nick: Excuse me?
Warrick: You fellas want to keep it moving? We're trying to work here.
Kid 2: You call that working? Why is there an ass-whupping on every other block?
 
Nick: There's about to be an ass-whupping on this block.
Kid 2: Is that right?
Nick: That's right.
Warrick: Hey, Nick ...
Cole Tritt: Man, you're weak, weak, weak, weak.
 
Officer: Come on, man.
Kid 2: You can't do this. I'll say what I want.
 
Cole Tritt: I'm sorry. You're not weak.
 
Warrick:  Nick.
 
Warrick: Nick ... 
Cole Tritt: You're a joke.

 
Warrick: Nick. Come on!
Cole Tritt:  Anybody get that on video? Man, I'll take a picture myself.
 
Warrick: That's a nice phone you got there, man. Real nice phone. Wonder how many drug dealers' numbers you got on this phone here.
 
Warrick: Feel like going to jail tonight? Listen, I'm sorry about the little spill you had earlier, but that's why we got the crime tape up, so you could see it. Watch where you're going next time.  Get you home safely.
 
Warrick: What are you doing? We beating people up now?
Nick: I'm sick of these punks, man. I'm serious, I'm sick of it.
Warrick: Then you're in the wrong town.
Nick: Maybe.
 

 
 
Grissom: Greg?
 
Greg: Grissom.
Grissom: Just another day at the office, huh?
Greg: Well, at least I can see now. The guy they beat up ... how is he?
Grissom: He's gonna be fine.
Greg: What about the other guy? The guy I hit.
Grissom: His name is Demitrius James. He's in surgery.
Greg: Is he, like, a gangbanger or something?
Grissom: Actually ... he's a student at the university.
Greg: He gonna be okay?
Grissom: I don't know.

Grissom: Has someone called your parents? We should let them know.
Greg: Mmph.
Grissom: What's the matter?
Greg: They still think I'm in the lab.
Grissom:  Why do they think that?
Greg: When I was in high school ... I never played any sports. No football, no basketball. Definitely no hockey.
Grissom: I never would've guessed.
Greg: Well, it wasn't by choice. My mom wanted four kids. Ended up with only one. She always made sure I stayed close. If I got a nosebleed, she'd take me to the ER.
Grissom: Well ... now would be the time to come clean.
Greg:  My mom's gonna freak.
Grissom: You tell her that you risked your life to save someone else's ... and I think she'll be very proud of you.

 
 
Sara: Hey.
 
Sara: Doctor found these on Demitrius James.
 
Grissom: Contact lenses? 
Sara: Special kind. They're called Halloween lenses. They're wearing costumes.
Grissom: Great. Just a game to them.


 
(The fax machine prints out a sheet. Catherine looks at it. It reads:
TEL NEVADA
CELLULAR PHONE RECORD
VASCO RUIZ
702-555-0102
 
Catherine:  Is that your number, Cha Cha?
 
 
Cha Cha Romero: Yeah, that's my number.
Catherine: So tell me ... what does a dead guy sound like?
 
Catherine: Oh, is that funny?
Cha Cha Romero: Oh, man, I mean, isn't it supposed to be?
Catherine: Someone called you from his phone-- who was it?
Cha Cha Romero: When'd they call again?
Catherine: 12:33 A.M., last night.
Cha Cha Romero: Man, you know how many people blow me up at that time? Shoot, that's like prime time. Finding-the-right-party time. Half my calls go to voice mail my line's so busy.
Catherine: Who's this guy?

Cha Cha Romero:  M-maybe I seen him before, I don't know.

 
INSERT: FLASHBACK
 
BACK TO SCENE.
Catherine: Farami, huh?
Cha Cha Romero: Yeah. You like?
Catherine: If it was real, I might.
Cha Cha Romero: Whatever.  Can I go now? 
 
Catherine: When I swab that knockoff Farami buckle and I find this tourist's DNA on it, you're going down for murder.
Cha Cha Romero:  She didn't die.
Catherine: No, but Mr. Ruiz did. And you were the last person that he called. That connects you to both crimes.
Cha Cha Romero:  Thought it was this hot boy.
Catherine: And what did Tara want?
Cha Cha Romero: Her boyfriend Pig invited her to a party at a motel. She invited me, so I rolled.
 
Tara Miller: Go get a piece. It's fun.

 
Catherine: Is that your idea of a party?
Cha Cha Romero: Man, everyone loves a good fannysmackin' session.
Catherine: A what?
Cha Cha Romero: Beating up fannypackers. You know, tourists.
Catherine: Why would you want to do that?
Cha Cha Romero:  Nothing else to do.
Catherine: And you do this all the time?
Cha Cha Romero: Yeah, but this was the first time I ever heard of anyone dying.
Catherine: What is Pig's name?
Cha Cha Romero: I just know &quot;Pig.&quot;
Catherine: So if ... fannysmackin' is all about tourists, why'd you go after a dishwasher at the Golden Sapphire?
Cha Cha Romero: I don't know. Maybe he was just practice.
 




 
 
Brass: So, you think we're out of the woods yet? 
 
Sofia: Well, the beatings were occurring every half hour, and it's been three hours since the last one, so maybe.
 
Officer: You need to sign in.
Dean Harden: Do I look like I want to sign in? I want to talk to a cop, okay?  Somebody get me a cop! I want to talk to a cop now!
 
Sofia:  He's a cop.
Brass:  She's a cop.
 
Anthony Himmer: Hey, my friend, he got beat up and robbed.
Brass: I can see that. 
Sofia: Where?
Dean Harden: On the corner of Decatur and Jones. They-they took the ten g's that I had on me, they took my watch, they took my cell phone.
Anthony Himmer: And look at his face. They beat him up, too.
Brass: Did you get a good look at 'em?
Dean Harden: Not really -- they were wearing hoodies.
 

 
 

 

 

 
 
Hodges: Processed the sweater found at the liquor store. Found blood. 
 
Hodges: Sent it to DNA. Wendy found two types, matched both to your vics. She also ran saliva on Greg's jacket. Came back unknown male. Same unknown male that Greg scratched.
 
Hodges: Nice map.
Grissom: What do you see?
Hodges: My old neighborhood. What do you see?
Grissom: Inconsistency.
Hodges: In what?
Grissom: The dishwasher, both tourists and Greg were attacked near the strip. Dean Harden claims that he was attacked all the way over here in southwest Las Vegas. Swarms don't backtrack.
Hodges: We're talking about humans here, not bugs.
Grissom: Humans have always adapted strategies from insects. Swarming is an ancient military tactic. You surround your enemies, then attack from all directions simultaneously. Alexander the Great pioneered the maneuver 2,000 years ago. Although swarms consist of several individuals, they must be treated as a single entity, which lives, thinks and moves as one, built with an internal logic to continue forward, gain momentum and never backtrack.
Hodges: So this guy Dean probably was not a victim of this swarm, or he's lying.
Grissom: Take a look at these clothes.
 
Grissom: In contrast to the other beatings, I found only one type of shoe tread on Dean's clothing. The print matches a size 12 Nike Air. And this tennis shoe is ... his own.
Hodges: He swarmed himself?

 
 
Dean Harden: I owe my Uncle Lenny ten g's. And I don't got it, all right?
Sofia: Am I supposed to know who Uncle Lenny is?
Anthony Himmer: Uncle Lenny? Lenny G. The famous sports handicapper.
Sofia:  Yeah, it's not ringing any bells.
Anthony Himmer: He's black-booked from the casinos.
Dean Harden: But he still likes to bet.
Sofia: And you bet for him.
Dean Harden: Yeah, he gave me five dimes to bet the Eagles this past Sunday. You see, me and Ant, we're hurting for cash right now.
Anthony Himmer: We didn't think the Eagles had a chance, so we thought we would just pocket the cash.
Sofia: But they won and now you owe Uncle Lenny G. ten gs.
Dean Harden: Yeah. And when we saw these beatings on TV and ... just thought it was a great idea.
 
 
Dean Harden: Don't go near the package.
Anthony Himmer: Why am I going to go near your package?
Dean Harden: All right. All right.
Anthony Himmer: It'll be like Pesci did it to De Niro in &quot;Raging Bull.&quot;
Remember that?
Dean Harden: Yeah, all right, just do it, man, come on.
Anthony Himmer: Okay.
Dean Harden: All right, just do it, man!
Anthony Himmer: I'm doing it!
 
Anthony Himmer: What, are you crying?
Dean Harden: Shut up, man! It's not funny, all right?!
 
Anthony Himmer: I figured if Dean said we got beat up and robbed, we wouldn't have to pay up.
Sofia: Yeah, well, now you're eleven g's in the hole. The ten thousand you owe Uncle Lenny for the bet, and the thousand you owe us for filing a false police report.

Nick: Hey, Catherine. I think I'm on to something. Check this out.
 
Catherine: Oh ... the king swine.
Nick: Now, &quot;y'all&quot; is plural. Believe me, I used the word a lot, so I have a feeling he sent that to more than one person.
Catherine: It could be a mass text. Lindsey once sent everyone in her phonebook the same message at the same time. I got stuck with a $300 bill.
Nick: Hmm, we got this punk's phone number. All we have to do is subpoena his phone records. We'll get every one he sent the message to. We'll text him, we'll tell him to meet us somewhere.
Catherine: From Tara's phone? They'll know it's us.
Nick: No, from Pig's phone.
Catherine: We don't have Pig's phone.
Nick: Don't need it. When you text from a computer, you put in the number that you're calling from. We'll just use Mister Piggy's.
Catherine: Okay, but how do we get the pig?
 

 
(Brass talks with Tara Miller. 
Brass: Look, I'm not going to play you, Tara. So let's not waste each other's time. I have enough evidence to try you for first-degree murder. But I'm greedy. I want the rest of the Mickey Mouse Club. So you have a choice. You can either spend a very, very long time in jail or you can help me out. 
 
Tara Miller: I'm not saying nothing.
Brass: You don't have to say anything. 

Brass: Write a text message. Something Pig would send to his buddies to gather them all up for another fannysmackin' party. Look, Tara, I don't think that beating these people up was your idea, so why should you and Cha Cha take the fall? These guys don't care about you. I mean, let's face it. You're just a piece of tail to them. Right? So what's it going to be? Are you going to let a guy with the colorful but unfortunate name of &quot;Pig&quot; run free while you go to jail? You know, it's funky in there. No Posh Spice. No parties, no purses or pedicures or pasta primavera. So you decide.  Decide.

Hooded Kid #1: Pig text you?
Hooded Kid #2:  Yeah.
 
Hooded Kid #3: Hey, Pig, thanks for that text. I'm ready for some smackin'.
&quot;PIG&quot;: I didn't text you.
Hooded Kid #3: You didn't?
&quot;PIG&quot;: Nah. Did you text me.
Hooded Kid #3: I didn't text you.
 
 
 
Brass:  Everybody out of the car, now. Get out of the car.
 
Brass:  Let's see those hands. Put them on the top of the car.
 
Officer: Put ‘em where I can see ‘em.
 
Sofia: Turn off the truck. Get out. And put your hands above your head.

Brass:  Get out of the car!
 
Sofia: You're going to jail.
 
&quot;PIG&quot;: Free shower, free food, free sleep.

Nick: Let me in there.
 
Cole Tritt : This little piggy went, &quot;wee, wee, wee,&quot; all the way home.


 
 
 
Nurse Lizzy: I think this is the room, sir. 
Stanley Tanner: There he is.
 
Stanley Tanner: Mr. Sanders? 
Greg: Hey. How you doing?
Stanley Tanner: Better than dead. Get me over here, Lizzy, where I can shake this man's hand.
 
Stanley Tanner: You're a brave man. Thank you.
Greg: You're welcome. 
Stanley Tanner:  Home, Elizabeth.
Nurse Lizzy: Okay.
 
Stanley Tanner: I cook some mean barbeque, if you ever get yourself to Union City, Tennessee.
Greg: I'll look you up.
Stanley Tanner: You do that.

 
 


 
 
Sara: I am going to pick up some Roberto's, take it over to Greg. I'm sure he's sick of that hospital food -- anybody want to come?
Warrick: I'll take a ride with you, but I'm going to pass on the Mexican food at 10:00 in the morning.
Nick:  No, I'd like to see Greg. I'm definitely in, yeah.
 
Catherine: Pig and the piglets are in the pigpen.
Warrick: It's about time. Finally, some good news.
Catherine: Did you know that Pig, aka Cole Tritt, was the only adult. The rest of them were under 18. One was 14.
Warrick: Are you kidding? Who raises these kids?
Catherine: I mean, they weren't all delinquents. Demitrius James was a college student.
Nick: Hanging out with the wrong crowd in the wrong town. I'm telling you ... 

 
Nick:  ... a fake ID in Las Vegas is like having a free ticket on the hell train. s*x, drugs, gambling, no adult supervision, 24/7. 
 
Nick:  By the time they're 21, they've done and seen it all.
BACK TO SCENE.
 
Catherine: Make me slit my wrists, why don't you? I'm raising a teenager here.
Warrick: Oh, you're doing a great job. Lindsey's gonna turn out to be a beautiful young woman. Besides, I grew up in Vegas. I didn't turn out so bad, did I?
Nick: Yeah, that was pre-Mirage, back when you were a little squirt going to the casino playing the arcade games.

 
Nick:  No, Vegas is a different animal now.
Warrick:  Yeah, these kids need to beat people on the street to be entertained. They just need some good discipline.
BACK TO SCENE
 
Warrick: They need their grandmother whupping their ass like, like I had.
Nick:  Yeah, a good slap.
Sara: You know, it kind of sounds like you guys are blaming everybody but these kids. I mean, you don't get a bye just 'cause you grew up here or your parents are on drugs. Those kids are perfectly capable of telling the difference between a wild night out and ... beating somebody to death.
Grissom:  The truth is ... 
 
Grissom: ... a moral compass can only point you in the right direction, can't make you go there. Our culture preaches that, uh, you shouldn't be ashamed of anything you do anymore. 

Grissom:  And unfortunately, this city was built on the principle that there's no such thing as guilt. &quot;Do whatever you want; we won't tell.&quot; So without a conscience, there's nothing to stop you from killing someone. And evidently, ... 
BACK TO SCENE.
Grissom: ... you don't even have to feel bad about it.

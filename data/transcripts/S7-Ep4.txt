							<p>FLASH IN: </p>
<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>[CU: CLOCK]</p>
<p>(The time clock reads midnight. Vasco Ruiz punches out. He takes his name tag off and puts it in his pocket and walks through the hallway.)</p>
<p>[INT. GOLDEN SAPPHIRE -- GARAGE – CORRIDOR -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Vasco Ruiz takes out his cell phone and dials.) </p>
<p><strong>Vasco Ruiz</strong>: (to phone) Hola, cariño. Todo bien? Estan mis bebes durmiendo como bebes?</p>
<p>(He continues walking through the corridor and heads for the garage. He passes by a man dressed for work walking in the opposite direction.) </p>
<p><strong>Vasco Ruiz</strong>: (to phone) Sí, ya se, ya se. No me reganes mas. Sí, sí. Comida para el bebe. Sí, pan, leche. Mira, cariño, ahorita vengo.</p>
<p>(He reaches the garage and continues walking. A car slowly drives down the ramp. He doesn't pay any attention to it.)</p>
<p><strong>Vasco Ruiz</strong>: (to phone) Te quiero. </p>
<p>(He hangs up with a smile on his face. He kisses the phone, folds it and continues walking through the dark garage.) </p>
<p>(Vasco Ruiz walks down the ramp and passes by a drunk singing in the dark.)</p>
<p><strong>Drunk</strong>: (singing) Danke schoen / Oh, darling / danke schoen / danke schoen, oh, darling / danke schoen / thank you for all the joy and pain ... </p>
<p>(He continues through the garage.) </p>
<p>(A figure moves swiftly across the camera and disappears back into the darkness.)</p>
<p>(Vasco Ruiz continues walking. The drunk's singing fades into the background. Vasco has his keys in his hand. He turns when he hears clanking behind him.) </p>
<p>(He continues walking.)</p>
<p>(Suddenly, a masked figure runs up to him from behind, grabs him and punches him hard. Vasco drops his phone and falls to the ground. The masked figure continues to punch and beat up Vasco.)</p>
<p>(As the beatings continue, we hold on the photo image of Vasco and his wife Lucita on the phone.)</p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
[INT. GOLDEN SAPPHIRE HOTEL – GARAGE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Grissom and Catherine shine their flashlights on Vasco Ruiz's body. His face is bloody.) </p>
<p>(Brass walks up to them carrying an ID badge.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The vic had nothing on him but his casino ID. Name is Vasco Ruiz. He's a dishwasher here at the Golden Sapphire.</p>
<p>(Grissom snaps photos. Catherine kneels down next to the body.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: My guess he got off his shift, went to his car, got whacked.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: By what?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: A blender?</p>
<p>(Grissom snaps more photos.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Surveillance?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Not in the employee structure.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Witnesses?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, we found a Wayne Newton impersonator, but all I could get him to do was sing a few bars of &quot;Danke Schoen&quot;. But no wallet no cash, no cell phone, no car keys. Smells like a robbery.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Maybe it was his payday.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Even if this guy was walking out of here with a million dollars ... this is way more than excessive.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Personal.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, I'm gonna go get personal with his boss. See what he knows.</p>
<p>(Brass hands the phone to Catherine. He turns and leaves the area.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. MOTEL -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(A young woman steps out of her motel room and starts walking across the dark parking lot. She's alone and dressed to have a night out on the town. In her hands, she has her drink and her bag.) </p>
<p>(She reaches the end of the parking lot and sees the strip off in the distance several blocks away from her. She smiles, takes a sip of her drink, and starts walking.) </p>
<p>[EXT. SIDEWALK – NIGHT – CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(A man rides past her on a bike. He rings the bike bell. The young woman continues walking down the sidewalk. Sirens wail in the distance.)</p>
<p>(She turns the corner and walks through an unlit parking area.)</p>
<p>(She takes out a small pocket mirror and checks her lipstick. She turns the mirror and sees a hooded figure standing behind her.) </p>
<p>(She puts the mirror down and finds a hooded figure standing in front of her.)</p>
<p>(She screams.) </p>
<p>FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>

<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) – NIGHT]</p>
<p>[INT. GOLDEN SAPPHIRE HOTEL – GARAGE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(The area in the parking garage is taped off. Grissom walks down the aisles looking for evidence. He stops and finds a set of keys near a side pillar. He picks it up and looks at it.) </p>
<p>(Grissom looks around the area at a car parked nearby. He gets up and walks over to the parked car. He tries the key and opens the door. He kneels down and sees two dice hanging from the rear-view mirror. On the dice are pictures of Vasco Ruiz's two kids, one on each fuzzy block.) </p>
<p>(He looks around the car.)</p>
<p>(In the background, Grissom hears dispatch over the police radio. He looks up and sees the police scrambling for their cars. The next call is only a few blocks away from their present location.) </p>
<p><strong>Dispatch</strong>: (muffled) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Got a 4-15, we gotta go.</p>
<p>(Grissom stands up. The police officers start their car engines, turn their sirens on and head up the parking garage ramp.) </p>
<p>(Grissom goes back to looking at the car.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Sirens wail in the distance.) </p>
<p>[EXT. PARKING LOT – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Jessica is wheeled out on a gurney, her head in a brace. She is badly beaten and bruised.)</p>
<p>(The gurney passes Warrick and Brass on their way in.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (to Brass) You got a name?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: She's not talking.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What about ID?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: He must've taken her wallet.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Cell phone?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: It's not here; they took it. Somebody had to see something.</p>
<p>(Brass walks away. Warrick reaches Nick at the site.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p>(Warrick looks at her things on the ground, most stained with blood.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, we got a souvenir cup that screams &quot;tourist.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (nods) Yep.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I don't see a bar anywhere around here. She must've been either going to or coming from the strip.</p>
<p>(Nick looks around the area. It's isolated, dark and dangerous-looking.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: But she shouldn't have been walking around here, Warrick. Couldn't pick a shadier part of town, man.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You know these tourists don't know what they're getting when they book a trip to Vegas online. </p>
<p>(Warrick kneels down and looks around.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: They think &quot;I got a room on the strip for 75 bucks. Whoo, what a deal.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Then they mosey through the naked city with their thousand dollar cameras.</p>
<p>(Warrick nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Next thing you know, we're taking their picture.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You know what? Grissom's crime scene is just five blocks from here. Both victims had their wallets and their cell phones stolen. And they were both beaten down in the same way.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Looks like someone's on a little crime spree.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(David Phillips washes down the victim's head as Catherine watches.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Uh, David, hang on.</p>
<p>(She stops David. She finds a piece of toenail in the victim's mouth and removes it. She holds it up.) </p>
<p><strong>David</strong>: Looks like a woman's toenail.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, it's not necessarily a woman's.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. HOSPITAL – ROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(In the hospital room, Sara snaps photos of Jessica's cuts and bruises. Jessica is in a neck brace. She flinches from the camera flashes.) </p>
<p>(Sara moves in closer and snaps more photos.) </p>
<p>(Sara sets the camera down, then picks up forceps and a bindle.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Jessica ... this might hurt a little bit, but it's going to help us get the people who did this to you.</p>
<p>(Sara picks off trace she finds on Jessica's facial cuts and puts it in the bindle. Jessica flinches and groans.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'm sorry. Thank you.</p>
<p>(Sara sets the bindle aside and picks up the camera again.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Do you have any other injuries?</p>
<p><strong>Jessica Hershbaum</strong>: Yeah. On my left side. Ow.</p>
<p>(Jessica rolls over on her side, her back to Sara. Sara leans in and looks.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Could you lift your left arm for me, please?</p>
<p>(With a lot of pain and difficulty, Jessica raises her arm. She cries from the effort. Sara snaps a photo of the bruised indention on her side. It's in the shape of an &quot;F.&quot;)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>(Sara steps away. Jessica lowers her arm and rolls back.) </p>
<p><strong>Jessica Hershbaum</strong>: I just got out of a ten-year relationship. So I decided to take a solo trip to Vegas. You know, try the whole &quot;What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas.&quot;</p>
<p>(Sara picks more trace out of Jessica's facial cuts and places it in a bindle.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Been there.</p>
<p><strong>Jessica Hershbaum</strong>: Yeah, well, I get to take this face back with me.</p>
<p>(Jessica cries. Sara picks up a pen to mark the bindle.)</p>
<p><strong>Jessica Hershbaum</strong>: Well, did anybody else get hurt?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Why do you ask?</p>
<p><strong>Jessica Hershbaum</strong>: I heard them say that I was number two. Was there a number one?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: There was.</p>
<p><strong>Jessica Hershbaum</strong>: How are they doing?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: He died.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. ALLEYWAY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(The pack of hooded people moves swiftly through the dark alleyway. Someone violently kicks something in their way and laughs.) </p>

<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[INT. CSI – LAB -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Catherine is marking the various shoe prints on the victim's shirt. She sticks a sticker next to each print as she identifies it.) </p>
<p>(Greg walks in. He's dressed in a suit and looking snazzy. There's a gait in his step and his spirits are up. Catherine looks up and he poses for her, turning this way and that to show off his threads.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: All right, slick. Now what's with the suit?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (proudly) Today was my first jury trial. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Today ended ... (she checks her watch) ... an hour and a half ago.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, maybe I just don't want the day to end.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, if that's the case, why don't you help my day end quicker and help me isolate some shoe treads. (She tosses the roll of stickers to him. He catches it.) Take the pants.</p>
<p>(Greg walks around the table and grabs some latex gloves from the box. He puts them on.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So ... ? How'd you do on the stand?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: So good the prosecutor took me to dinner.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Female?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yeah, she was icing. (Greg puts a sticker on the pants near a shoe print.) I was just happy to finally see a case from the crime scene to the courtroom. We freakin' buried the guy. It was bad ass. I dropped the hammer ... he was squirming in his chair.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: How many different patterns you have there?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Five different patterns.</p>
<p>(Greg walks around the table and moves the pants closer to Catherine's shirt so she can see and compare the patterns herself.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, I've got three different ones on the t-shirt.</p>
<p>(She points out the different shoe patterns.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I mean, this one that looks like an athletic shoe sure got around. As did this pointed toe high-heeled one. Check out the heel mark.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: So did this work boot.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (teases) What do you know about work boots? I'm guessing you haven't worked a day of hard labor in your life.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I wore Doc Martens in high school. It was the style.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, for skinheads.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yeah, they kind of ruined it for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You know, one of the victims was Hispanic, the other was Jewish. Maybe this was a hate crime.</p>
<p>(Greg picks up a photo of the victim's bashed-in face.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Sure looks like hate to me.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Robbins looks at the body as he shares his findings with Grissom. Grissom writes on the clipboard.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Vasco Ruiz was someone's punching bag. He suffered multiple abrasions, lacerations, contusions. I found no particular patterns, sharp edges or tool marks from any weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Do fists and feet count?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: He had too many bruises to count, one on top of another. And under the skin, things get even worse.</p>
<p>INSERT: CSI ENHANCEMENT</p>
<p>(Camera zooms in to the bones in the victim's hands. As Robbins speaks, the bones snap and break.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Long bone fractures of the fingers, radius, ulna, humerus.</p>
<p>(Camera zooms in to the chest cavity. The bones break there as well.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (V.O.) Rib fractures, flail chest. Fractures of the vault and base of skull. Almost every bone in his face.</p>
<p>(The skull bones break as well.) </p>
<p>BACK TO SCENE.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Somewhere along the way, he took a shot to the head that resulted in a subdural hematoma. COD is multiple blunt force trauma.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Could one person have done this?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (shakes his head and sighs) Not even Mike Tyson.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) – NIGHT]</p>
<p>[INT. LIQUOR STORE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(The liquor store owner rattles off the damage to Sofia.) </p>
<p><strong>Liquor Store Owner</strong>: (rambles quickly) Okay, okay, okay, they took my good vodkas, my single-malt whiskies, they took vermouth, cognac, VSOP cognac. Am I going to get any of the stuff back? What are you guys going to do about this?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Okay, slow down. You're talking too fast.</p>
<p><strong>Liquor Store Owner</strong>: All right, you know what? Just let me know when you're ready.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: I'm ready, sir, I just, I just need you to talk slower.</p>
<p><strong>Liquor Store Owner</strong>: Okay, I can do that. These creeps come flying in here -- they take a lot of my good stuff. And I chased one of them and I snatched the sweater right off his back.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: How many did you see?</p>
<p><strong>Liquor Store Owner</strong>: I don't know. There was a bunch.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: A bunch. Two? Five? Ten?</p>
<p><strong>Liquor Store Owner</strong>: Closer to the ten.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Any descriptions?</p>
<p><strong>Liquor Store Owner</strong>: They had hoods on. They were hooded.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: You took the sweater off one of them and you didn't get to see what he looked like?</p>
<p><strong>Liquor Store Owner</strong>: He was on his way out the door. What I did see was really weird. Anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: What does &quot;weird&quot; look like?</p>
<p><strong>Liquor Store Owner</strong>: I don't know. His face. His nose was all deformed. The whole thing creeped me out.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – HALLWAY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Greg walks through the hallway. He passes a tech, who smiles and high-fives him.) </p>
<p><strong>Tech</strong>: Way to go.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>(Greg continues down the hallway. Grissom steps out of his office, his face buried in the clipboard he's writing on.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Greg ... lose the monkey suit, you got a scene; liquor store robbery. Here's the address.</p>
<p>(Greg takes the slip of paper from Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Related to the earlier 415s?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Could be -- Sofia's got one of the suspect's sweaters. I need you to seal it, bring it back here and anything you can find.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: All right. Who's my wingman?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You're a big boy, Greg. You don't need a wingman for this.</p>
<p>(Grissom turns and leaves.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Primary. (smiles) Nice.</p>
<p>(Greg heads out.) </p>

<p>(Sara dips the toe of her shoe in a pan of dark-colored dirt. She kicks the dummy on the ground. The dummy's wearing a white jumpsuit.)</p>
<p>(With her back to the doorway, Sara kicks the dummy again and again.) </p>
<p>(She moves the dummy to get a bigger area to kick. She pulls back and kicks again and again.)</p>
<p>(She dips the toe of her shoe in the pan of dirt again. She continues to kick the crap out of the white-suited dummy on the ground.) </p>
<p>(Grissom walks in from the hallway and watches her. Sara pulls back and kicks the dummy hard.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Whoa! Pick on somebody you're own size.</p>
<p>(Sara turns around and looks at Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Are you volunteering?</p>
<p>(Grissom looks at Sara. He raises his eyebrow at her.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No.</p>
<p>(Sara wipes her forehead with the towel. She points to the two dummies wearing the victim's clothes.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The two scenes are related. I found two common treads on both vics: an athletic shoe and a boot. I ran them through the SoleMate database. The athletic shoe ... is a converse Chuck Taylor and the boot is a Doc Marten.</p>
<p>(She shows Grissom the printouts.) </p>

<p>(The gang continues to kick and beat up the man on the ground.) </p>

<p>(Greg struggles. The rest of the gang returns. They take up where they left off ... this time with Greg as their victim.) </p>
<p>(They turn on him, kicking and beating him up. Greg tries to stay on his feet. They push him into the nearby chain-linked fence, laughing as they kick and punch him in the back.)</p>
<p>(They pull him away from the fence and toss him back to the center of the alleyway. Greg lands on his hands and knees. He tries to get up and crawl away, but they keep kicking and punching him in the back.)</p>
<p>(Finally, Greg collapses on the cold ground.)</p>
<p>(They kick him over onto his back ... and they continue beating, kicking and punching him.)</p>
<p>(Greg is senseless, barely taking in anything anymore. His vision's blurred; sounds of his attackers' laughter echo around him. The kicks and punches don't stop.) </p>
<p>(One of the attackers spits on Greg's vest. He steps over Greg and walks away. Greg reaches up and grabs the attacker's ankle as he leaves.)</p>

<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: We're talking about humans here, not bugs.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Humans have always adapted strategies from insects. Swarming is an ancient military tactic. You surround your enemies, then attack from all directions simultaneously. Alexander the Great pioneered the maneuver 2,000 years ago. Although swarms consist of several individuals, they must be treated as a single entity, which lives, thinks and moves as one, built with an internal logic to continue forward, gain momentum and never backtrack.</p>

<p><strong>Anthony Himmer</strong>: We didn't think the Eagles had a chance, so we thought we would just pocket the cash.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: But they won and now you owe Uncle Lenny G. ten gs.</p>
<p><strong>Dean Harden</strong>: Yeah. And when we saw these beatings on TV and ... just thought it was a great idea.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [EXT – NIGHT] ) </p>
<p>(Dean and Anthony discuss the beatings.) </p>
<p><strong>Dean Harden</strong>: Don't go near the package.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Himmer</strong>: Why am I going to go near your package?</p>
<p><strong>Dean Harden</strong>: All right. All right.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Himmer</strong>: It'll be like Pesci did it to De Niro in &quot;Raging Bull.&quot;<br />
Remember that?</p>
<p><strong>Dean Harden</strong>: Yeah, all right, just do it, man, come on.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Himmer</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Dean Harden</strong>: All right, just do it, man!</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Himmer</strong>: I'm doing it!</p>
<p>(Anthony punches Dean in the face. Dean yells and groans. He starts crying from the pain.) </p>
<p><strong>Anthony Himmer</strong>: What, are you crying?</p>
<p><strong>Dean Harden</strong>: Shut up, man! It's not funny, all right?!</p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Anthony Himmer</strong>: I figured if Dean said we got beat up and robbed, we wouldn't have to pay up.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Yeah, well, now you're eleven g's in the hole. The ten thousand you owe Uncle Lenny for the bet, and the thousand you owe us for filing a false police report.</p>
<p>(Sofia turns and leaves the room. Dean shakes his head and exhales.) </p>

[INT. CSI – LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Nick empties out handbag contents on the table. He picks up the cell phone and checks the messages. There is one new text message.<br />
CALLBACK #: 702-555-0165<br />
MESSAGE: FROM PIGMAN. WHERE DA HELL U @</p>
<p>CALLBACK #: 702-555-0165<br />
MESSAGE: U ROLLIN OUT TONIGHT<br />
SENT ON: SEP 11, 06 8:58 PM</p>
<p>1 NEW TEXT MESSAGE</p>
<p>MESSAGE: PIGMAN: HEY Y'ALL. GOLDEN SAPPHIRE FANNYSMACKIN' SESSION. 11. MESSAGE SENT 9:33 PM</p>
<p>(Nick continues to check the messages when Catherine walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, Catherine. I think I'm on to something. Check this out.</p>
<p>(Catherine takes a latex glove and uses it to hold the phone as she reads the text message.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh ... the king swine.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Now, &quot;y'all&quot; is plural. Believe me, I used the word a lot, so I have a feeling he sent that to more than one person.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It could be a mass text. Lindsey once sent everyone in her phonebook the same message at the same time. I got stuck with a $300 bill.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hmm, we got this punk's phone number. All we have to do is subpoena his phone records. We'll get every one he sent the message to. We'll text him, we'll tell him to meet us somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: From Tara's phone? They'll know it's us.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No, from Pig's phone.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We don't have Pig's phone.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Don't need it. When you text from a computer, you put in the number that you're calling from. We'll just use Mister Piggy's.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay, but how do we get the pig?</p>
<p>(Nick turns and looks at Catherine.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – INTERVIEW ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Brass talks with Tara Miller. </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Look, I'm not going to play you, Tara. So let's not waste each other's time. I have enough evidence to try you for first-degree murder. But I'm greedy. I want the rest of the Mickey Mouse Club. So you have a choice. You can either spend a very, very long time in jail or you can help me out. </p>
<p>(Tara holds her wrists out for him to handcuff. She bobs her head from side to side. Brass looks at her and bobs his head from side to side in the same manner.) </p>
<p><strong>Tara Miller</strong>: I'm not saying nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You don't have to say anything. </p>
<p>(Brass slides a pad and pen toward her.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Write a text message. Something Pig would send to his buddies to gather them all up for another fannysmackin' party. Look, Tara, I don't think that beating these people up was your idea, so why should you and Cha Cha take the fall? These guys don't care about you. I mean, let's face it. You're just a piece of tail to them. Right? So what's it going to be? Are you going to let a guy with the colorful but unfortunate name of &quot;Pig&quot; run free while you go to jail? You know, it's funky in there. No Posh Spice. No parties, no purses or pedicures or pasta primavera. So you decide. (firmly) Decide.</p>
<p>(She grabs the pen and starts writing.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />

PM</p>
<p>[INT. DA SPOT – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(A couple of guys wearing masks sit in their car. A second car pulls up along side theirs.) </p>
<p><strong>Hooded Kid #1</strong>: Pig text you?</p>
<p><strong>Hooded Kid #2</strong>: (nods) Yeah.</p>
<p>(Several more cars pull into the warehouse and park.) </p>
<p><strong>Hooded Kid #3</strong>: Hey, Pig, thanks for that text. I'm ready for some smackin'.</p>
<p>&quot;PIG&quot;: I didn't text you.</p>
<p><strong>Hooded Kid #3</strong>: You didn't?</p>
<p>&quot;PIG&quot;: Nah. Did you text me.</p>
<p><strong>Hooded Kid #3</strong>: I didn't text you.</p>
<p>(Suddenly several officer cars pull into the warehouse, their sirens pulse on and off, lights flashing.) </p>
<p>(Brass parks his car.) </p>
<p>(Sofia parks and gets out of her car, a shotgun in her hands. Nick parks and gets out of his car, his gun out and leveled at the kids. More cars pull in, surrounding the kids.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (over bullhorn) Everybody out of the car, now. Get out of the car.</p>
<p>(One-by-one, the kids get out of their cars.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (over bullhorn) Let's see those hands. Put them on the top of the car.</p>
<p>(The officers move forward.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Put ‘em where I can see ‘em.</p>
<p>(Nick takes special notice of a kid who hasn't moved from his car. Sofia heads forward toward the car. She cocks her shotgun on her way to the car.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Turn off the truck. Get out. And put your hands above your head.</p>
<p>(The kid doesn't move.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (over bull horn) Get out of the car!</p>
<p>(&quot;Pig&quot; gets out of the car. The officer steps forward and slams him face-down onto the hood of the car.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: You're going to jail.</p>
<p>(He looks at her.) </p>
<p>&quot;PIG&quot;: Free shower, free food, free sleep.</p>
<p>(&quot;Pig&quot; chuckles. Nick pushes his way toward &quot;Pig.&quot; He tucks his gun away.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Let me in there.</p>
<p>(Nick pulls the mask off and finds it's the guy from the alleyway crime scene.) </p>
<p><strong>Cole Tritt (Pig)</strong>: This little piggy went, &quot;wee, wee, wee,&quot; all the way home.</p>
<p>(Nick knocks the cap off Cole's head. Cole looks at Nick and snorts like a pig as the officers pull him away.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. HOSPITAL – GREG'S ROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Greg is feeding himself. He lifts his head and through the glass window between the two rooms, he sees Demetrius' mother and brother standing over Demetrius' bed.) </p>
<p>(He hears voices and turns to find Nurse Lizzy pushing Stanley Tanner in a wheelchair. They enter his room.) </p>
<p><strong>Nurse Lizzy</strong>: I think this is the room, sir. </p>
<p><strong>Stanley Tanner</strong>: There he is.</p>
<p>(Greg pushes the bedside table away and gets to his feet.) </p>
<p><strong>Stanley Tanner</strong>: Mr. Sanders? </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Hey. How you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Stanley Tanner</strong>: Better than dead. Get me over here, Lizzy, where I can shake this man's hand.</p>
<p>(Lizzy pushes his wheelchair closer. Greg holds up his bandaged hand. Stanley holds up his arm in a cast. It's a little awkward, but Stanley grabs Greg's left hand with his right in a firm grip.) </p>
<p><strong>Stanley Tanner</strong>: You're a brave man. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: You're welcome. </p>
<p><strong>Stanley Tanner</strong>: (to the nurse) Home, Elizabeth.</p>
<p><strong>Nurse Lizzy</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(Nurse Lizzy backs Stanley toward the door.) </p>
<p><strong>Stanley Tanner</strong>: I cook some mean barbeque, if you ever get yourself to Union City, Tennessee.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I'll look you up.</p>
<p><strong>Stanley Tanner</strong>: You do that.</p>
<p>(In the next room, Marla James cries hysterically over her dead son's body. Greg turns and steps closer to the window. She drapes herself over her son and sobs loudly.)</p>
<p>(Her other son Aaron stands helplessly on the side. He looks up and sees Greg watching them. He glares at Greg. Greg looks down and steps away from the window.) </p>
<p>(He continues to glare at Greg.) </p>

[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) – MORNING]</p>
<p>[INT. CSI – LOCKER ROOM -- MORNING] </p>
<p>(Sara removes the lock from her locker and opens it. She turns and addresses Warrick, who is sitting on the locker bench, and Nick, who removes the cartridge from his gun before tucking it back into his locker.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I am going to pick up some Roberto's, take it over to Greg. I'm sure he's sick of that hospital food -- anybody want to come?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'll take a ride with you, but I'm going to pass on the Mexican food at 10:00 in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (chuckles) No, I'd like to see Greg. I'm definitely in, yeah.</p>
<p>(Catherine walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Pig and the piglets are in the pigpen.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It's about time. Finally, some good news.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Did you know that Pig, aka Cole Tritt, was the only adult. The rest of them were under 18. One was 14.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Are you kidding? Who raises these kids?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I mean, they weren't all delinquents. Demitrius James was a college student.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hanging out with the wrong crowd in the wrong town. I'm telling you ... </p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – BOOKING – DAY]</p>
<p>(The kids are being processed. One is outside the holding cell while the others wait inside, sitting on benches.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (V.O.) ... a fake ID in Las Vegas is like having a free ticket on the hell train. s*x, drugs, gambling, no adult supervision, 24/7. </p>
<p>(The officer grabs the next kid and lead him to the holding cell door.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (V.O.) By the time they're 21, they've done and seen it all.</p>
<p>BACK TO SCENE.</p>
<p>(Catherine looks shocked by their assessment of today's young people.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Make me slit my wrists, why don't you? I'm raising a teenager here.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Oh, you're doing a great job. Lindsey's gonna turn out to be a beautiful young woman. Besides, I grew up in Vegas. I didn't turn out so bad, did I?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, that was pre-Mirage, back when you were a little squirt going to the casino playing the arcade games.</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – BOOKING – DAY]</p>
<p>(Camera moves down the line of bored kids sitting on the benches inside holding cells as they wait to be processed. There's no fear on their faces. No remorse. Nothing.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (V.O.) No, Vegas is a different animal now.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (V.O.) Yeah, these kids need to beat people on the street to be entertained. They just need some good discipline.</p>
<p>BACK TO SCENE</p>
<p>(Sara finishes and turns to listen. Warrick tucks his things in his pockets as he smiles at Nick.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: They need their grandmother whupping their ass like, like I had.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (nods) Yeah, a good slap.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You know, it kind of sounds like you guys are blaming everybody but these kids. I mean, you don't get a bye just 'cause you grew up here or your parents are on drugs. Those kids are perfectly capable of telling the difference between a wild night out and ... beating somebody to death.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (o.s.) The truth is ... </p>
<p>(Grissom, who has been unnoticed in the room all this time, shuts his locker closed. He has everyone's attention.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: ... a moral compass can only point you in the right direction, can't make you go there. Our culture preaches that, uh, you shouldn't be ashamed of anything you do anymore. </p>
<p>INSERT: VARIOUS FLASHES OF THE KIDS HAVING THEIR MUG SHOTS TAKEN.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) And unfortunately, this city was built on the principle that there's no such thing as guilt. &quot;Do whatever you want; we won't tell.&quot; So without a conscience, there's nothing to stop you from killing someone. And evidently, ... </p>
<p>BACK TO SCENE.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: ... you don't even have to feel bad about it.</p>
<p>FLASH TO BLACK.</p>

<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. THE BUS - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GWEN MURRAY sits behind the driver, MARTIN DRAPER, talking to him.)</p>
<p><strong>Gwen Murray</strong>: (black woman) So, what do you think? Come on, I earned this vacation. You ever been married? When it's good, it's great. When it's over, it's even better, hmm?</p>
<p><strong>Man (light tan suit &amp; tie)</strong>: I'm telling you, the seven comes up every six rolls. I've got a system.</p>
<p><strong>Man (dark brown jacket)</strong>: You know what the casinos say about guys with systems?</p>
<p><strong>Man (light tan suit &amp; tie)</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Man (dark brown jacket)</strong>: Welcome.</p>
<p><strong>Heavy-set Man</strong>: He doesn't know what he's talking about. Everything you need to know about craps is right in this book.</p>
<p><strong>Woman (in red)</strong>: I was talking to Shirley -- she said the only way to make money in that town is slots.</p>
<p>(Cut to the &quot;Mojave Express&quot; bus driving on the roadway.)</p>
<p>(Cut back to inside the bus where a kid is listening to rock music on his walk-man.)</p>
<p><strong>Walter</strong>: (old white haired man): I'm up 1,500.</p>
<p><strong>Old Woman (red-haired)</strong>: That's nice, dear. Oh, now. I've found the pictures. Now look at this. </p>
<p>(The young women around her gasp when they see the pictures.)</p>
<p><strong>Blonde-haired Woman</strong>: Oh, look at him.</p>
<p><strong>Old Woman (red-haired)</strong>: He's just learning how to walk. Here's another one with his sister. </p>
<p>(Camera cut back to the photo album and a picture of two blonde-haired children.)</p>
<p><strong>Old Woman (red-haired)</strong>: Oh, there it is.</p>
<p><strong>Tracy Logan</strong>: (dark-haired young woman): You have a beautiful family.</p>
<p><strong>Old Woman (red-haired)</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Walter</strong>: We've been blessed.</p>
<p><strong>Old Woman (red-haired)</strong>: Yes, we sure have been blessed.</p>
<p>(Couple necking at the back of the bus. Dark-haired, bearded man comes out of the lavatory and makes his way to the front of the bus.)</p>
<p><strong>Martin Draper</strong>: (driver) Well, folks, we just hit mountain pass. </p>
<p>(CALVIN McBRIDE, the man drinking, walks up the aisle. He bumps into the young blonde-haired woman. She looks up at him annoyed.)</p>
<p><strong>Martin Draper</strong>: (driver): (o.s.) Means we're about 40 miles outside of Vegas. Some of you are going to be driving back with me. </p>
<p>(The camera continues to follow the drinking man as he continues up to the front of the bus.)</p>
<p><strong>Martin Draper</strong>: (driver): Some of you are going to be flying back with all the money you're going to win. In any case you just sit back, relax, we'll see if we can't get you there ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>(The drinking man makes it to his seat. He sits down and puts his earphones on. The driver puts the hand-held mike away. The drinking man takes a drink of the bottle in the paper package. He looks across the aisle at the driver.)</p>
<p><strong>Calvin McBride</strong>: (drinker) Hey. Want a nip?</p>
<p>(The driver looks at the man, he smiles and shakes his head, no.)</p>
<p><strong>Martin Draper</strong>: (driver): No, I know my limits.</p>
<p>(The driver continues to drive. The man watches him. The driver steps on the gas and the bus increases speed. The odometer reads 65 mph. 70 mph.)</p>
<p>(The bus starts to shake. The driver holds on to the bus. He looks down at the odometer which reads 75+ MPH. The steering wheel shakes some more. The passengers look up at the driver as they notice that something's wrong.)</p>
<p>(Cut to the outside of the bus with the camera on the tires.)</p>
<p>(Cut to a long angle of the bus as the wheel pops and the bus swerves out of control.)</p>
<p>(Cut to inside the bus with the passengers screaming.)</p>
<p>(The bus turns as the driver struggles to regain control of the bus.)</p>
<p>(The passengers scream.)</p>
<p>(The bus hits the guard rail and sparks fly.)</p>
<p>(The passengers inside the bus are being tossed around.)</p>
<p>(The bus continues to drive the guard rail.)</p>
<p>(The bus driver hits the brakes trying to stop the bus.)</p>
<p>(The bus drives over the side of the road.)</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK:</p>
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<hr />
[EXT. CRASH SCENE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Camera close up of the red road-side flare burning behind the CSIs standing on the edge of the roadway looking down upon the crash site below. Large generators power bright lights as the rescue team works to find any survivors.)</p>
<p>(The CSIs stand aside and watch. Down below, a rescue worker instructs the other workers.)</p>
<p><strong>Rescue Worker 1</strong>: Everybody stand by. We do not touch this car until every victim is off the bus.</p>
<p><strong>Rescue Worker 2</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p>(The CSIs watch as a rescue workers helps an injured man to the make-shift first aide area. A woman sits on the gurney comforting another woman. A rescue worker assists a woman to the aide area. Another rescue worker puts a body bag down among the many already piling up on the side.)</p>
<p>(The CSIs continue to stand on the side ... and watch.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I feel so useless.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It's still a rescue operation.</p>
<p>(Down below a group of rescue workers carry an injured survivor strapped tightly in a basket.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We're not running the show.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah. Not yet.</p>
<p>(The basket carrying the injured man is being carried and pulled up the hillside. As it passes, the CSIs see that it's a dark-haired young man.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: They do their job and then we do ours.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO BLACK. END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<hr />
[EXT. CRASH SITE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The rescue workers are in the bus still removing bodies. They have the old man, WALTER, strapped to a basket and they struggle to get him out of the bus. DAVID PHILLIPS stands just outside the bus' broken window.)</p>
<p><strong>Rescue Worker 1</strong>: Okay, you got him there?</p>
<p><strong>Rescue Worker 2</strong>: Yeah</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Mine are lined up right over there.</p>
<p>(DAVID points to somewhere over behind him.)</p>
<p><strong>Rescue Worker 1</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(A second set of rescue workers carry a basket with the old woman strapped in it.)</p>
<p><strong>Rescue Worker 2</strong>: Let me get under. All right. There we go.</p>
<p><strong>Old Woman</strong>: Walt? Where's my husband? (calls out) Walter? Walter...</p>
<p>(The old woman cries out for her husband as they carry her off in the basket. The camera moves to the side and we now note that the CSIs are down in the crash site area. GRISSOM, SARA, and WARRICK watch as she's carried away.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: All right, I want everybody thinking worst case scenario. The highway's finally ours. Cones and pictures, skid marks, ice patches, loose asphalt, anything and everything.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It's a pretty wide area up there. Are we clear to call in for help?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Every Las Vegas CSI is on their way here.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Cadets?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Call them.</p>
<p>(And with that, WARRICK and SARA pick up their kits and head back up the hill to the highway.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM starts walking around. He hears women crying. He sees an old man lying with the other dead bodies as someone puts a tag around his neck. He sees a woman crying over a dead body in a bag.)</p>
<p><strong>Woman (over radio)</strong>: ... 1-25 roger ...</p>
<p>(GRISSOM continues to survey the site area. Off in the distance, he sees the survivors being tended to by the medics.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You the only trauma doc?</p>
<p><strong>Trauma Doctor</strong>: That's right. Lucky me. I personally black-tagged six. Excuse me. My line of work, that's a bad night.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, mine, too. (NICK glances over at the large man on the gurney.)<br />
That the bus driver over there?</p>
<p><strong>Trauma Doctor</strong>: Big surprise. The only person on the bus wearing a seat-belt.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Only one on a tour bus required to wear one. Thank you.</p>
<p>(GREG appears next to NICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Hey. Got here as soon as I could.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Whoa, what are you doing here, Greg?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: All hands on deck. That was the call, right? Crims on the scene.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Crims with &quot;field training&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (to GRISSOM) Come on. I'm capable.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to NICK) He does no collection.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks away. NICK reaches into his jacket pocket and pulls out a notepad and pen. He gives it to GREG.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You're taking my notes. You didn't bring a warmer jacket?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: No.</p>
<p>(NICK doesn't say anything. He walks away from GREG who has a concerned look on his face. In the background, we hear indistinct voices over the radio.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(LARRY MADDOX talks with BRASS.)</p>
<p><strong>Larry Maddox</strong>: Listen, I'll, uh ... I'll do anything that I can. I just want to help. Please.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No, sir, just, uh, uh, stick around.</p>
<p><strong>Larry Maddox</strong>: I'll be right here. Thank you.</p>
<p>(BRASS walks away. In the distance, CATHERINE makes her way toward BRASS.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hey. Uh, Larry Maddox. Owns the bus company.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Got here quick. That should tell you something.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, he coughed up the passenger manifest including the driver, Martin Draper. Twenty-four passengers, one PAL. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Parolee-At-Large.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Calvin McBride. Seat one-C. California state pen, two years aggravated assault. He was paroled last week.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And already over state lines.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: It was news to his parole officer.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm sure it was.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know, my guys are matching names to faces both here and at the hospital. McBride tops the list. I'm going to talk to Maddox.</p>
<p>(BRASS walks away leaving CATHERINE standing there.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Back up the highway, SARA, WARRICK and two others search the roadway for evidence.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Four-point sweep.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Let's roll.</p>
<p>(WARRICK signals and they start walking. As they walk, they mark the evidence with markers.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. CRASH SITE - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks up to GRISSOM who is looking at the tire.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Fire department says the driver of the Camaro's dead.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, I heard, but I think I know why the bus pulled to the right.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Now that is a serious blowout. And the front left tire's still intact.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Newton's third law: &quot;For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Tire to rim. Rim to axle. Axle to suspension. Suspension to frame. And the lower radius rod arm ... which connects the axle to the frame.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Not anymore.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: View of under the bus as the car tires screech. The rod iron falls and drags along the road. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So, if the rod arm broke while he was driving ...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Driver tried to maintain control. Veered to the left.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: But turning the wheel was probably going to make things worse.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Putting pressure on the right front tire causing it to blow. The ... the bus then veers to the right and goes off the road.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And we're back to Newton. The Theory's correct if the rod arm was the first action.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm going to go see what's going on with that Camaro.</p>
<p>(CATHEIRNE leaves. GRISSOM continues to look at the bus.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(CATHERINE walks to the smashed Camaro around the bus #65326. She walks around the camaro looking around. She leans in and sees a male body inside the back seat of the car.)</p>
<p><strong>Woman (b.g. on radio)</strong>: ... 1-41 north ... </p>
<p>(As she looks inside, the MAN'S hand reaches up. CATHERINE'S eyes widen with shock that he's still alive. She reaches out and grabs the man's hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We're going to get you out of here, okay?. Rescue!</p>
<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS RESIDENCE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The man is on the gurney and is being pushed to the medic area. He's holding on tightly to CATHERINE'S hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (loudly) Can you tell me your name?</p>
<p>(They begin working on the man.)</p>
<p><strong>Rescue Worker</strong>: Miss, you need to let him go. </p>
<p>(The rescue worker pulls the grip apart.)</p>
<p><strong>Rescue Worker</strong>: Let's go on three. RESCUE WORKER: One, two, three, in.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE watches as they put the man in the ambulance and close the doors shut. She stands there and stares at her hands covered with the man's blood.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
(NICK questions MARTIN DRAPER, the bus driver, while GREG takes notes.)</p>
<p><strong>Martin Draper (bus driver)</strong>: This never happened to me before. The wheel just s-s-sh-shook right out of my hands.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: How long after your scheduled stop in Barstow?</p>
<p><strong>Martin Draper</strong>: We, uh, we-we always stop in Barstow. </p>
<p>(He takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes. GREG watches and takes notes.)</p>
<p><strong>Martin Draper</strong>: Uh, McDonald's the, uh, the train station one.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I understand that, Mr. Draper, but how long after that did the wheel start to shake on you?</p>
<p><strong>Martin Draper</strong>: (confused) Uh. (shakes his head) I don't, uh ... I don't ... </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Sir, are you okay? </p>
<p><strong>Martin Draper</strong>: (shakes his head) No. We're behind schedule. I got to get back to the bus.</p>
<p>(MARTIN DRAPER stands up and puts a hand out on GREG. Both GREG and NICK takes steps forward to catch MARTIN DRAPER.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hold on, hold on. Wait a second. Mr. Draper ... </p>
<p>(NICK looks at MARTIN DRAPER'S eyes.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mr. Draper, have you had anything to drink tonight? (pause) I'm going to do a preliminary field breath test. (to GREG) Keep an eye on Mr. Draper, will you, for me? Mr. Draper, you sit tight.</p>
<p><strong>Martin Draper</strong>: I, uh, I got to go.</p>
<p>(NICK moves aside to get the things.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Won't take a minute. I understand. I understand. Hang tight.</p>
<p><strong>Martin Draper</strong>: See, uh, there's people ...</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I understand. I want you to take a deep breath, and I want you to blow into the end of this for me, okay?</p>
<p>(NICK holds out the breathalizer and puts it toward MARTIN DRAPER'S mouth.)</p>
<p>(Martin Draper coughs up blood. He collapses against NICK who catches him and holds him up.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I need a doctor over here. Greg, get some help.</p>
<p>(GREG doesn't move; he's frozen. His eyes are glued to MARTIN DRAPER.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Greg!</p>
<p>(NICK struggles with MARTIN DRAPER who continues to cough. He looks up at GREG.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Greg! Get some help!</p>
<p>(Camera holds on GREG.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<hr />
[EXT. HIGHWAY HILLSIDE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(NICK and GREG walk down the hill.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: It's all right, man. Stop apologizing.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Oh, I feel bad. I just froze up.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: That's why we have fielding training, Greg. No disrespect, but you're not qualified to be out here.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I guess I just wasn't expecting blood to look like that. Pre-collection, so different.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yup. I remember my first time in the field. CSI One. Green as could be. Initial call was a robbery. I get there, triple homicide. Blood all over the place, mother and two kids.</p>
<p>(NICK puts on his gloves as they reach the bottom of the hill, GREG close behind him.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: How do you deal?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You just do.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM is standing hear the front of the overturned bus. He's looking at the passenger list on a clipboard when NICK and GREG join him.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay, what's next?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, we're missing a passenger. The only one unaccounted for is an ex-con named Calvin McBride. According to Brass, he wasn't admitted to the hospital and he's not in any of the body bags.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What about the rest stop in Barstow </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: CHP and the Barstow P.D. are looking.</p>
<p>(NICK nods.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Anybody check the bus?</p>
<p>(NICK and GRISSOM look at each other.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I'll find out.</p>
<p>(NICK takes off his jacket and walks inside the bus. He pulls out his flashlight and looks around. He sees the embroidery on the floor, blood spattered on it. A row behind that, he sees the magazines. A row behind that, he sees a photo album. He also sees a lot of blood on the bus.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: GRISSOM and GREG as they wait outside.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Firefighters only look in the obvious spots.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Just out of curiosity, what are the unobvious spots?</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Snapped in half?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Bolts are graded according to their hardness. The higher the grade, the stronger the steel.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: A grade eight bolt shouldn't snap like a toothpick.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did you do a Rockwell hardness test?</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, that's what we're going to find out. We need a treadmill -- a big one.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: All right, to do what?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Exercise a bus. Warrick, tell Larry Maddox it's in his best interest to lend us one of his ... </p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What was her skeleton?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Tracey Logan? Seat 8-B? Her boyfriend was Eric Kevlin, the camaro driver. He was a doctor. He followed her from L.A. They had an argument in Barstow. </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: He didn't want her in Vegas. First step to stopping her is stopping the bus.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And he has access to chloroform.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Chloroform can be picked up at any chemical supply store. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Wait a minute. Eric Kevlin was a nervous boyfriend. He wasn't a criminal.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Still possible. Motive, access, opportunity.</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, this is the rear trailing tire of the crash bus. It has the same maintenance record as the tire that blew.</p>
<p>(SARA gets her supplies and walks toward them.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Chloroform, glass rod, valve core remover .... (SARA kneels next to the bus tire.) according to Vincent and Trace, it's like pissing down a rope.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Gravity, huh?</p>
<p>(SARA shakes her head at the comparison. She demonstrates how the chloroform was added to the tire.)</p>

<p><strong>Sean Nolan</strong>: Yeah. I smoke one joint on the weekend... my time. Now I got a jacket as a junkie. Can't get a job driving a bus to save my life.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, you figured, &quot;I'll just blow a couple of his tires.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Sean Nolan</strong>: Even if a tire blows the suspension system should keep the bus on the road. I been driving buses for ten years. I've never seen a flat take out a bus.</p>

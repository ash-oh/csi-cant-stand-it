<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[EXT. STREET OUTSIDE THE SIXTH SENSE OCCULT SHOP - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Sirens wail in the distance. There's low to medium traffic on the street - a car parks and people get out. People walk on the sidewalk on both sides of the street.)</p>
<p>(Camera focuses on the neon sign on the occult shop's window - a neon eye on a neon yellow triangle in the center of the shop name: SIXTH SENSE.)</p>
<p>(We slowly push in toward the sign, through the center of the eye's pupil as we enter through the window and into the ... </p>
<p>[INT. THE SIXTH SENSE OCCULT SHOP - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(The shop is dimly lit with lamps and low lighting. We push further into the shop past a shelf with skulls and a crystal ball on a stand.) </p>
<p>CUE <strong>Voices</strong>:</p>
<p>(Sounds of conversation filter from the back room. We move completely through the crystal ball and past the shelves of different colored bottles filed with various items.)</p>
<p><strong>Sedona Wiley</strong>: (o.s.) Focus all your intention on the crystal for your highest truth.</p>
<p>(We pass hanging baskets with a sign that reads &quot;CHICKEN FEET&quot;, across the countertop with various colored bottlesand a wall with various photos as we move to the back of the shop.)</p>
<p>[INT. SIXTH SENSE - BACK ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p><strong>Sedona Wiley</strong>: (o.s.) What is your first question?</p>
<p>(We continue past a cabinet and stop in front of the entryway to the back room. The voices are clearer.) </p>
<p><strong>Lori</strong>: I want to know if he loves me.</p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
[CRYSTAL BALL]</p>
<p>(We see the reflection of two women in the glass.) </p>
<p><strong>Sedona Wiley</strong>: I see red.</p>
<p>(Sedona Wiley sits across a small table from two young women - the same two women from 1X22: Evaluation Day.)</p>
<p><strong>Sedona Wiley</strong>: That can be passion. The connection between you is very strong.</p>
<p>(Lori smiles, pleased with the answer. Anna Leah watches Sedona skeptically. Sedona takes a breath and closes her eyes.) </p>
<p><strong>Sedona Wiley</strong>: I see blood. There's danger around you.</p>
<p><strong>Lori</strong>: Well, my parents do hate him.</p>
<p><strong>Sedona Wiley</strong>: I'm getting a name Ray. Ray. And a letter &quot;B.&quot;</p>
<p>(She opens her eyes.) </p>
<p><strong>Sedona Wiley</strong>: Uh, when, when we put the name Ray with the letter &quot;B,&quot; does anything come up for you?</p>
<p><strong>Anna Leah</strong>: We don't know anyone named Ray. And my boyfriend's name is Stuart.</p>
<p>(Sedona looks at the clear marble in her hands.) </p>
<p><strong>Sedona Wiley</strong>: There's something else -- &quot;R.&quot; Ro-ro ... rode, rode, rodeo. Is he connected to a rodeo? Is he taking you to a rodeo?</p>
<p><strong>Lori</strong>: I don't think so.</p>
<p>(Sedona appears upset, as if she's doing this reluctantly.) </p>
<p><strong>Sedona Wiley</strong>: I'm getting another image. Um ... an arm. It's a one-armed cactus, but it's not in the ground. And then it's cold. </p>
<p>(She opens her eyes and looks at them.) </p>
<p><strong>Sedona Wiley</strong>: I don't usually tell people when I see bad things, but the danger is so strong I can feel it. </p>
<p>(Spooked, Anna Leah gets to her feet.) </p>
<p><strong>Anna Leah</strong>: Okay, this is stupid. You're scaring us.</p>
<p>(Concerned, Lori gets to her feet. Sedona grabs her hands.) </p>
<p><strong>Sedona Wiley</strong>: Don't ... go.</p>
<p>(Anna Leah grabs Lori and the two head for the door.) </p>
<p><strong>Anna Leah</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>Sedona Wiley</strong>: Don't!</p>
<p>(Anna Leah and Lori leave.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. STREET OUTSIDE SIXTH SENSE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(The doorbell jingles as Anna Leah and Lori leave the shop. They head across the street. As soon as Anna Leah steps off the curb, a car stops, tires screeching.)</p>
<p>(She whacks the car hood with the palm of her hand.) </p>
<p><strong>Anna Leah</strong>: Jerk!</p>
<p>[DRIVER POV]</p>
<p>(Anna Leah and Lori continue walking down the street in front of the car, their images blurring.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. STREET OUTSIDE SIXTH SENSE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The area is crowded with officer cars, lights flashing. Grissom exits the SUV and joins Brass.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Say hello to Anna Leah and Lori. You may remember them. A few years ago they stole a car and found a severed head in the trunk.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How could I forget that?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, now they found a dead psychic, Sedona Wiley, in the occult shop.</p>
<p><strong>Lori</strong>: She said there was danger all around us. I mean, we almost got hit by a car right here, and then she's dead.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Wait, I'm confused. You left and then you came back?</p>
<p><strong>Lori</strong>: Yeah. I forgot my sunglasses. Two hundred bucks.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: This officer will take you downtown to take your statement, okay?</p>
<p>(Anna Leah rolls her eyes.) </p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
[INT. SIXTH SENSE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Sedona Wiley is dead, faced-up on the floor, her arms away from her body.)</p>
<p>(Grissom enters the shop. Photo flashes snap as someone takes pictures of the body. The entire room is trashed.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Greg?</p>
<p>(Crouched near the body alongside David Phillips, Greg looks up at Grissom. Greg stands up.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I thought I paged Warrick on this.</p>
<p>(Grissom puts his kit down.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yeah, about that, uh, we traded days.</p>
<p>(Grissom shines his flashlight on Greg.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Because?</p>
<p>(Greg puts a hand up to block the light.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, uh, it's a long story, but the short answer is I have an expertise in the occult.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Huh. Hello, David. What do you know? </p>
<p>(Grissom heads toward them. Sedona's body is located near the backroom entryway.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Gunshot to the chest. Liver temp is 98 degrees which is odd unless she's running a fever. It means I can't give you an accurate TOD. Sorry.</p>
<p>(Greg continues taking photos. David rolls the body over.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Bullet was a through-and-through. Based on lividity, the body wasn't moved.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What's in the back room?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: A small office. Probably where she did the readings. There's, uh, incense, pendulum, jar of marbles. They're used for divining. It's hipper than the old crystal ball.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Where did you say your expertise comes from?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Oh, my grandmother, Nana Olaf. She was a psychic. She didn't have a store. She just had a kitchen table and she prognosticated for free. She had a sixth sense. And the family thinks that I might have inherited it.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Okay. What am I thinking?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: That I'm due for a promotion?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm thinking you should focus on your other five senses.</p>
<p>SMASH CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[INT. SIXTH SENSE - DAY]</p>
<p>(Greg snaps photos of blood drops on a skeleton-decorated stool. He turns and snaps more photos of the broken jars and bottles on the shelves and countertops. He finds more blood drops.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (puzzled) Got some blood drops over here.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Connected to the blood pool?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: No.</p>
<p>(Grissom snaps a photo of the floor near evidence marker B.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Maybe the killer cut himself?</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: Someone swings his arm, knocking the jars and bottles off the countertop. Blood drops fall on the surface. End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p>(Greg puts his camera down and digs into his pocket for a swab.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I'll swab it.</p>
<p>(then)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: You ever been to a psychic?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Would it surprise you if I had?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Surprise. So go ahead and run it for me.</p>
<p>(Greg looks around and points to the cash register.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Sure. Uh, cash register's empty, which could mean robbery gone bad.</p>
<p>(He turns to the bullet hole in the wall.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: The shot was a through-and-through. Bullet went into this wall. Haven't extracted it yet. Shot was fired along this line.</p>
<p>(Greg places his back to the wall, aligning himself in line with the bullet trajectory.) </p>
<p>(Quick flash to: The killer stands in the same position, raises a gun and fires. The bullet heads straight for Sedona Wiley.)</p>
<p>(We hear her grunt as the bullet hits flesh.) </p>
<p>(End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p>(Greg straightens.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Which puts the shooter on the far side of the body.</p>
<p>(Grissom looks around at the damage to the shop.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, if it was a robbery, why'd they trash the place?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, I can think of two reasons: One, the shooter was on drugs and did it just to do it. Or there wasn't enough money in the register and he decided to look for more.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p>(Grissom heads for the back room.) </p>
<p>[INT. SIXTH SENSE - BACK ROOM - DAY -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Grissom pushes the hanging bead divider and looks in the room as he listens to Greg talk.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (o.s.) Well, uh, he figured that the victim must have had a purse or a safe somewhere ... </p>
<p>(Grissom steps into the room and looks around.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (o.s.) and terrorizing her is one way to get her to give it up.</p>
<p>(Grissom picks up a book on the counter nearby. There's a five-point star in a circle on cover. The book is labeled &quot;DEATH&quot;. He puts the book down and notices Sedona's purse on the counter. He looks through the purse and takes out her wallet. He opens it, sees the driver's ID, credit cards and cash inside.) </p>

WILEY, SEDONA<br />
32 POINT VIEW<br />
LAS VEGAS, NV 89101</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: They didn't take her purse.</p>
<p>(Greg snaps more photos. Grissom finds a tape recorder. He turns it on and rewinds it a little.</p>
<p><strong>Sedona Wiley</strong>: (from tape) I'm getting a name: Ray. Ray. And a letter &quot;B.&quot;<br />
Um, when, when we put the name Ray with the letter &quot;B,&quot; does anything come up for you?</p>
<p>(Greg enters the back room and listens to the tape. He looks down on the table and sees a pair of sunglasses.) </p>
<p><strong>Anna Leah</strong>: (from tape) We don't know anyone named Ray, and my boyfriend's name is Stuart.</p>
<p>(Greg picks up the sunglasses and looks at Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Ray Bans -- &quot;Ray B.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Sedona Wiley</strong>: (from tape) There's something else. &quot;R,&quot; ro, rode. Rodeo. Is it connected to a rodeo? Is he taking you to a rodeo?</p>
<p><strong>Lori</strong>: (from tape) I don't think so.</p>
<p>(Greg steps out of the back room.) </p>
<p><strong>Sedona Wiley</strong>: (from tape) I'm gettin another image, an arm. </p>
<p>(He looks out the window.) </p>
<p><strong>Sedona Wiley</strong>: (from tape) A one-armed cactus, ... </p>
<p>(And sees a one-armed cactus sign on the building across the street.) </p>
<p><strong>Sedona Wiley</strong>: (from tape) ... but it's not in the ground. And then it's cold ... </p>
<p>(Greg looks down at the broken glass on the floor. Something catches his eye. He kneels down and the partially covered label on the broken glass reads: RHODE--. The other partially-covered label on the broken glass reads: LAEO--.) </p>
<p><strong>Sedona Wiley</strong>: (from tape) I usually tell people when I see bad things, but the danger ...</p>
<p>(Greg looks at the labels ... then up at the partially covered one-armed cactus sign on the building across the street. </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Grissom?</p>
<p><strong>Sedona Wiley</strong>: (from tape) ... is so strong, I ...</p>
<p>(Grissom appears in the doorway, pushing the hanging beads to the side.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (points) Take a look out there. What do you see?</p>
<p>(Grissom looks at the sign.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: A one-armed cactus. And take a look at these labels. &quot;Rhode ... eo.&quot;<br />
They spell rodeo.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Power of suggestion, Greg.</p>
<p>(Greg stands up.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I think that the victim saw images of the crime scene. Grissom, I think she foresaw her own death.</p>
<p>(Grissom smiles slightly, then closes the hanging beads.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY - DAY]</p>
<p>(Robbins is standing next to the body on the autopsy table when Grissom enters.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Before you ask, no, I did not find her third eye.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What did you find?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Center-mass shot front to back. Large caliber bullet. Clipped her aorta. COD was exsanguination. She bled out.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: David said she was running hot.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: There's no signs of infection but I did find trace amounts of a white powder in her nasal cavities and lungs. Possibly cocaine-induced hyperthermia. I ordered a full drug panel and sent a sample to Hodges. It could be a hallucinogen. In some native cultures, shamans use peyote to call forth visions.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Al, when someone sells love potions and magic spells, the only visions they see are dollar signs.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. SIXTH SENSE OCCULT SHOP -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Greg prints the cash register. He finds some prints and tapes them. He puts the tape on the others on the counter.) </p>
<p>(He looks in the cash register and finds some gold-colored flecks. He takes a tape sample of the flecks.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Grissom and Warrick are moving through the hallway. Grissom is holding a file folder.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Five right 44, consistent with a Smith &amp; Wesson, but no hits in IBIS.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Whew, somebody used some heavy artillery on that psychic.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And remind me again why you didn't show up at the crime scene?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: 'Cause your former lab boy begged me for it. He offered to take my next holiday on-call. I thought he was nuts, but I wasn't going to pass him up. To be honest with you, Grissom, my wife's having a hard time with my schedule. She's spending a lot of time alone. I didn't think it would be that big of a deal.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, you should have cleared it with me. And by the way, you're still on the case.</p>
<p>(Grissom hands the file folder to Warrick.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: All right.</p>
<p>(Grissom and Warrick enter the Print Lab.)</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - PRINT LAB - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Mandy Webster reports her findings to Grissom and Warrick.) </p>
<p><strong>Mandy Webster</strong>: I paged Greg. I don't know where he is.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's okay, 'cause Warrick is now backing him up.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What do you got?</p>
<p><strong>Mandy Webster</strong>: There's too many prints and there's too many hits. I need some help. Can you talk to Ecklie, please?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'll do what I can. What about the cash register?</p>
<p><strong>Mandy Webster</strong>: I ran those per Greg ... per you. All the prints belonged to the victim except for two. Both of which were a match to a Reese Bingham. His work card's in the system.</p>
<p>(She points to the monitor which reads:<br />

<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(Warrick and Brass interview Reese Bingham.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The state has a law that murder committed during the commission of a felony buys you the death penalty. Do you understand that?</p>
<p><strong>Reese Bingham</strong>: This has to be a mistake. I don't even eat meat. Or cheese. I won't even hire an exterminator.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Your prints were found at the crime scene.</p>
<p><strong>Reese Bingham</strong>: I haven't been to any crime scenes.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You been to any occult shops lately?</p>
<p><strong>Reese Bingham</strong>: Yeah, I work next door to one.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You want to explain to me why your prints were found on the cash register?</p>
<p><strong>Reese Bingham</strong>: The owner's my friend. Did something happen to her?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You don't know that she's dead?</p>
<p>(He sighs, saddened.) </p>
<p><strong>Reese Bingham</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: She was killed and then robbed, and your prints are on her cash register.</p>
<p><strong>Reese Bingham</strong>: Okay, yeah, wait ... I can explain that.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Start explaining.</p>
<p><strong>Reese Bingham</strong>: I work at a vegetarian restaurant. We make these soy burgers. Sedona was hooked on them. So, you know, she'd order, I'd deliver.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So you're a soy-burger-making, vegetarian delivery boy, hmm?</p>
<p><strong>Reese Bingham</strong>: Look, she's always busy doing a reading or whipping up some kind of potion. She told me to take the money out of the drawer.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Give yourself a tip?</p>
<p><strong>Reese Bingham</strong>: Soy burger and fries was $6.95 plus tax. I'd take a ten.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You delivered to her last night?</p>
<p><strong>Reese Bingham</strong>: (shakes his head) No.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Was it your day off?</p>
<p><strong>Reese Bingham</strong>: Like most nights, I work until six and then I like ... to go to the Stripperama.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I thought you didn't like meat?</p>
<p>(He chuckles unsure.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Is there anyone who can confirm that?</p>
<p><strong>Reese Bingham</strong>: Well, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: She got a name?</p>
<p><strong>Reese Bingham</strong>: Girls aren't allowed to tell you their real names, but I call her Star 'cause she has these ... blue stars tattooed on her hips. And it kind of looks like a meteor shower when she dances.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Would you stand up, please.</p>

Still burns me he used to be one of us. I really wanted to catch Wallace before I retired.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So you talked to a psychic.</p>
<p>(Brass sits behind his desk. Packey remains standing.) </p>
<p><strong>Packey Jameson</strong>: Jim, she told me things that she couldn't possibly know about this case. She also told me that Claire Wallace was murdered by her husband and he buried the body in Summerlin.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Too bad she didn't give you an address.</p>
<p>(Brass chuckles. Packey watches him, not pleased at being laughed at. He turns to leave. Brass stops him.) </p>
<p><strong>Packey Jameson</strong>: Forget it.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No, hey, come on, Packey. Come on, come on. Sit down. Sit down.</p>
<p>(Packey sits down.) </p>
<p><strong>Packey Jameson</strong>: Look, Jim, I interrogated him at least a dozen times. And I never got a rise from the smug b*st*rd until the last time -- until I repeated what this psychic told me.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So you think Wallace killed her because ...</p>
<p><strong>Packey Jameson</strong>: He was afraid she'd eventually lead me to the body. I even scheduled another reading with her, but ...</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Did he know her?</p>
<p>(Packey shakes his head, no.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Did you tell him her name?</p>
<p><strong>Packey Jameson</strong>: Of course not.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, if he didn't know who she was ...</p>
<p><strong>Packey Jameson</strong>: All right, all right. At least do me the courtesy of running Gordon Wallace's prints against any prints found at the crime scene.</p>
<p>(Packey stands up.) </p>
<p><strong>Packey Jameson</strong>: Check the case file. The last interrogation tape's still in there. You'll see.</p>

<p><strong>Greg</strong>: So, what's with the ghetto?</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: I was with Conrad and the mayor at the City Council budget meeting, requesting more funds for you slackers.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: So you probably didn't have any time to get some work done?</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Au contraire. </p>
<p>(He turns and motions them to follow him.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Multitasking is my forte. In fact, I shared your results with the City Council. (to Greg) Fine crime fighting, courtesy of your Trace Lab. </p>
<p>(They enter the Trace Lab.) </p>
<p>[INT. CSI - TRACE LAB - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Hodges goes over the results with them.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: The gold flecks that you pulled from the cash register was iron pyrite, commonly known as 'fool's gold.'</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What was it doing in the cash register?</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: It's also known as 'prosperity dust.' It could be for good luck.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Didn't work for Sedona Wiley.</p>

<p>(Brass and Grissom walk up to Gordon Wallace standing in the center of the stage. Grissom is carrying a file folder. Gordon Wallace oversees the work going on around him. He turns around and sees them.) </p>
<p><strong>Gordon Wallace</strong>: Jim Brass. Been a long time. </p>
<p>(They don't shake hands.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: How's it going, Gordon? This is Gil Grissom from the Crime Lab. So, Gordon, where were you the night before last between six-thirty and ten?</p>
<p><strong>Gordon Wallace</strong>: Well, I'm working 24-7 for Joslynn Raines ... (He turns to point her out.) ... while she's in town, so I was here with my crew until ten. Raced over to the airport, picked up my brother. Flew in from Florida, landed around ten-thirty. Brought him back here for the last show.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You ever been to the Sixth Sense Occult Shop?</p>
<p>(Gordon Wallace scoffs.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What? That's funny?</p>
<p><strong>Gordon Wallace</strong>: Nah, it's just, I ... I thought you were busting my chops for your boy, Jameson. Yeah, I was there, earlier this week. Joslynn wanted to buy a love potion. Despite her killer looks, the young lady is unlucky in the romance department. (off their looks) You don't believe me? Let's go ask her.</p>
<p>(He turns around and heads over to Joslynn Raines.) </p>
<p><strong>Gordon Wallace</strong>: Hey, Joslynn can you spare a minute for the, uh, boys in blue?</p>
<p>(She turns around as Gordon sits down on a speaker and crosses his feet.) </p>
<p><strong>Joslynn Raines</strong>: Friends of yours? Sure. Nice to meet you. Love your city. So you got a pen, or ... ?</p>
<p>(Puzzled, Grissom gives her his pen. She takes the pen ... and the file folder in his hand. She signs the folder for him.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Um, Miss Raines, were you at the Sixth Sense Occult Shop earlier this week?</p>
<p>(She hands the signed file folder and pen back to Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Joslynn Raines</strong>: Yeah. Gordie took me. I got a reading, picked up a few things.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Uh-huh. Did, uh, did Gordie go inside the shop with you?</p>
<p><strong>Joslynn Raines</strong>: Mm-hmm. He goes where I go.</p>
<p>(Grissom notices the underside of Gordon's shoes. There's a piece of red glass stuck in the rubber.) </p>
<p><strong>Joslynn Raines</strong>: I offered to pay to clear his aura, but he wasn't in to it. It's good for his soul.</p>
<p>(Gordon stands up.) </p>
<p><strong>Gordon Wallace</strong>: Are we done? You're going to need to ... exit out the front.</p>
<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO: </p>
<p>(Brass and Grissom are making their way to the front.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Maybe we can get a warrant and match the glass in Wallace's shoe to the glass we found at the scene, and then tie him to the murder.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I don't know how. Glass breaks all the time. It's not a unique event. Plus, he admits to being in the shop, which accounts for his prints.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know, maybe Packey was right -- maybe Wallace did kill that psychic.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, he'd only kill her if he also killed his wife.</p>

<p>[INT. CSI - LAYOUT ROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Packey Jameson opens the map on the table between him, Greg and Warrick.) </p>
<p><strong>Packey Jameson</strong>: This is the map I've been working off of, and each of these red stickers represents a hole I dug based on different information.</p>
<p>(He points to the red dots on the map over and near SUNRISE MANOR.) </p>
<p><strong>Packey Jameson</strong>: Now, most were around the house he owned in Sunrise Manor. These were near his, uh, brother's place, and a few near his sister's place. That's where they grew up, in Henderson.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: So you never looked in Summerlin?</p>
<p><strong>Packey Jameson</strong>: No reason to.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, it says here, when Wallace was a cop, he worked the northwest substation, that includes Summerlin.</p>
<p><strong>Packey Jameson</strong>: Yeah, but he hadn't been on the job that long, and Summerlin is out of his comfort zone and a long way from where they live. No, he ... he had better options closer to home.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So, where would his parameters be?</p>
<p><strong>Packey Jameson</strong>: Well, he'd pick a place where people don't normally go. </p>
<p>(Warrick looks at Gordon Wallace's work log.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Wallace worked northwest from January 1990 to August '92. He responded to like 20 crime scenes in Summerlin. If we just limit it down to the remote location ...</p>
<p><strong>Packey Jameson</strong>: Yeah. Let me look at that.</p>
<p>(He looks at the list of calls: </p>
<p>Illegal Dumping<br />

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Summerlin's changed a lot over the last ten years.</p>
<p><strong>Packey Jameson</strong>: Yeah, but there's two ...</p>
<p>(He looks back up the list.) </p>
<p><strong>Packey Jameson</strong>: ... three, possibilities. I got an idea.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. SUMMERLIN -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Various personnel are looking around the area. They each are pushing equipment to look at what's buried underground.) </p>
<p>(Grissom and Packey Jameson are standing behind an open SUV.) </p>
<p><strong>Packey Jameson</strong>: Back in the day, squatters were always camping their RVs in this area. That's what brought Wallace up here. Illegal dumping of human waste on public lands.</p>
<p>(Warrick finds something.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Grissom! I've got something!</p>
<p>(He turns and looks at the monitor.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's a metallic signature. This could be the abandoned septic tank.</p>
<p><strong>Packey Jameson</strong>: Time to find out.</p>
<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO: </p>
<p>(Warrick, Greg and others are digging in the area. Packey watches from the side.) </p>
<p>(They find the septic tank lid and clear it.)</p>
<p>(Greg hooks the wires to the lid. Warrick hooks the wires together.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Clear!</p>
<p>(He activates the pulley and the lid is dragged off the septic tank.) </p>
<p>(Grissom and Packey Jameson turn on their flashlights and look inside. They find a wrapped body on the bottom.) </p>
<p>[INT. TANK - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Greg goes down into the tank and unwraps the body. Sure enough, there's a skeleton. It's a grim find.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mrs. Wallace, I presume.</p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[EXT. SUMMERLIN -- DAY] </p>
<p>(It's day. Grissom, Packey and other personnel are still out at the site. Grissom looks in the tank and sees something.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hey, Greg. (Greg looks at him.) You missed some.</p>
<p>(Greg sighs and gets to his feet. He heads over to the tank.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (mutters) Well, one more spider bite won't make a difference. But you, being the bug guy, would probably enjoy being bitten.</p>
<p>[INT. TANK - DAY -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Greg enters the tank. He sees the bone just under the dirt and picks it up. It's a small curved bone. He looks at it, then heads back up.) </p>
<p>(He hands the bone to Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (o.s.) Could be rib.</p>
<p>(Grissom looks at the bone.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's too small.</p>
<p>(Greg brushes the dirt away from more bones in the ground.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to Packey) Did the Wallaces have a kid?</p>
<p><strong>Packey Jameson</strong>: No. That was part of the marital discord.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Check this out.</p>
<p>(Greg hands a small skull and some spine to Grissom. Grissom looks at it.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Claire Wallace did have a dog.</p>
<p><strong>Packey Jameson</strong>: Yeah. Yeah, I interviewed her sister. Said Claire had a little bulldog named, uh ... think it was Sneakers.</p>
<p>(Warrick stands up and snaps a photo of the bones.) </p>
<p><strong>Packey Jameson</strong>: Took him everywhere with her.</p>
<p>(Warrick notice something.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What's this around the neck?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's a wire.</p>
<p><strong>Packey Jameson</strong>: Killed the dog. He had to kill the dog to make it look like Claire took Sneakers with her. Otherwise, nobody'd believe his story.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: No collar or tags down here, but I found this ... whatever it is.</p>
<p>(Greg hands Warrick the metal contraption. It looks like a small brace with two tires.) </p>
<p>(Grissom looks at the item.)</p>

<p>[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Robbins and David Phillips stand around the table. David is holding a clipboard. Grissom walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (to David) Really thin, high-bridge nose. All indicate caucasoid.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Any chance at an ID?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Well, so far, everything's consistent with Claire Wallace. Unfortunately, because she was in a metal box in the desert, DNA's not likely viable. I sent samples of the long bones to Wendy anyway, but I don't expect results.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Dental records?</p>
<p>(Robbins picks up the skull.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (sighs) The, uh, killer knocked out most of her teeth. Roots are still in the bone. She was brutalized.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Cause of death?</p>
<p>(He points to the holes in the skull.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: I noted three separate and distinct fractures: One on the right side ... and two distinct fractures on the left side. We were able to identify the missing skull fragments, but when I tried to fit them back together, I couldn't. There was deformation of the bones. Pre- or peri-mortem, the human skull has an elastic quality, so when there's a fracture, the pieces will change shape. But post-mortem, the bone is brittle, and when it's fractured, the pieces retain their shape. It's not unlike breaking a vase or a bowl.</p>
<p>INSERT: CGI EFX:</p>
<p>(The pieces fit in perfectly in the hole in the skull.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (V.O.) The pieces all fit together like a jigsaw puzzle.</p>
<p>RESUME SCENE: </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: So based on the fractures to her skull, it appears she was struck in the head three separate times, and since the pieces won't fit back together, blunt force trauma to her skull is your COD.</p>

[INT. CSI - LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Greg and Warrick stand over the table with the dog bones on it.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Did you know that there are approximately 280 bones in a dog's body?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, the, uh, forensic vet should be here soon. Hopefully, he'll be able to determine whether this is a French Bulldog.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'm thinking this dog was an amputee.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Based on what?</p>
<p>(He picks up the metal contraption.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: This contraption. Looks like the, uh, canine equivalent of a wheelchair. My grandmother had a neighbor whose dog was hit by a car. The dog lived, but the doctor had to amputate the hind legs mid-femur.</p>
<p>(He picks up a bone.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: This is the hind femur, or what's left of it. You see how it was cut?</p>
<p>(Greg takes the bone and looks at it under the magnifying glass.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You know, if Sneakers here was a handicapped dog, ID-ing it just became a whole lot easier.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY -DAY]</p>
<p>(Grissom and Brass talk as they walk through the hallway.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: If we can ID the dog, it'd at least give us a compelling argument that the body found was Claire Wallace.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, but even with a cause of death of blunt force trauma, we still don't have enough to arrest him.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So, we re-focus on Sedona Wiley?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, it's like a Chinese puzzle. She knew who Wallace was, but Wallace didn't know her.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Greg's suspect, Damon Mitchell, claims that she tried to extort money from him.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So maybe she hit up Wallace, too.</p>

<p><strong>Archie Johnson</strong>: She called that number three times in the last week or so.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: She was reaching out to him.</p>

<p>(Sedona looks up and sees Gordon Wallace there. She doesn't appear pleased to see him.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) Maybe he went there to intimidate her.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume scene.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So she was shaking him down when he went in the store to shake her up. You know, Wallace said it was the singer's idea to go in there, not his.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, he also said he didn't murder his wife.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know, the girls said something curious -- the two that found the body. I didn't think it was important at the time. When they left the store, a car almost ran them down.</p>

<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, I'm going to need an impression of your palm and your fingerprints.</p>
<p><strong>Anna Leah</strong>: If it helps nail the guy, sure.</p>
<p>(She holds out her right palm. Greg rolls black ink on it.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Do you remember anything about the vehicle? Was it a car, a truck, SUV?</p>
<p><strong>Lori</strong>: I think it was a car.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What color was it?</p>
<p><strong>Lori</strong>: It was red. Stuck in my head after what the psychic said. Blood red.</p>

<p>(Greg does a visual comparison. Both he and Grissom are satisfied it's a match.) </p>

<p><strong>Gordon Wallace</strong>: You sad old man. Is this all you have to live for?</p>
<p>(Greg and Grissom join them.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Palm print on the hood of the car appears to be a solid match to Anna Leah.</p>
<p><strong>Gordon Wallace</strong>: Who's that?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: She's a good witness who places your car outside the shop on the night of the murder.</p>
<p><strong>Gordon Wallace</strong>: (shrugs) Maybe I was in the neighborhood. It's not a crime to drive around Vegas. I was only in that shop once, and I got my own witness. You got nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Our warrant also includes your shoes.</p>
<p>(Grissom holds up the warrant.) </p>
<p><strong>Gordon Wallace</strong>: You like 'em? They're new. Threw the old ones away.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: May I take a look at your wallet, please?</p>
<p><strong>Gordon Wallace</strong>: What for?</p>
<p>(Grissom holds up the warrant.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Because I can.</p>
<p>(Gordon Wallace takes out his wallet and gives it to Grissom. Grissom tucks the warrant in his jacket pocket and takes the wallet. He opens the wallet and pulls out some of the bills a little to look inside.) </p>
<p>(Gordon Wallace watches him smugly. Grissom turns on his flashlight and finds gold flecks on the bills.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You didn't make a purchase at that shop, did you?</p>
<p><strong>Gordon Wallace</strong>: Already told you that.</p>

<p>(Packey looks at Gordon Wallace.) </p>

<p><strong>Greg</strong>: You have to admit, it's, uh, pretty eerie -- Sedona's visions of her own death.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah. Maybe you should ask Nana Olaf to contact her, see how she's doing.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yeah, I know you're a cynic. I just think that you can have beliefs and still be a scientist.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I agree. The problems arise when people mistake their beliefs for the science. </p>
<p>(Greg nods. He looks pointedly at the book in Grissom's hand.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I've been reading her notebooks.</p>
<p>(Grissom opens the notebook and shows Greg the title: DEATH.) </p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sedona said Claire Wallace was &quot;In Summerland,&quot; not buried in Summerlin.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: What's Summerland?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Pagans believe it's a mystical place where souls go to rest before they reincarnate.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: So Jameson heard Summerlin ...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Because he was desperate to solve the case. Then when Wallace heard Summerlin ... he assumed Sedona was the real deal.</p>

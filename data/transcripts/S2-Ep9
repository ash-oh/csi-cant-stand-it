[INT. CASINO - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The camera gives us various shots inside the casino - of the gaming tables, of the people at the slots, of the craps table.)</p>
<p><strong>Craps Player</strong>: Five! Baby, go!</p>
<p><strong>Craps Player</strong>: Seven. Whoo!</p>
<p>(A player puts a bill flat on the table and slides it over to the DEALER. The DEALER looks over at the manager who is standing nearby. She calls out to him.)</p>
<p><strong>Dealer</strong>: Changing $100.</p>
<p>(The Manager, MAX DUNCAN, gives his approval.)</p>
<p><strong>Max Duncan</strong>: Change $100, go ahead.</p>
<p>(The DEALER puts the hundred in the table slot. The MANAGER stands off to the side watching the casino proceedings.)</p>
<p>(A SECURITY OFFICER pushes the cashbox equipment to the table. They remove the table's cash box and puts it on the metal rack. A cash box is removed and put under the DEALER'S table. The SECURITY OFFICER looks up at the surveillance camera, raises his hand and signals.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(Camera POV of the SECURITY OFFICER signaling to the camera.)</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong>: Section G-3 all clear. On route to H-4. And then soft count.</p>
<p>(Cut to: Camera view of the entrance stairs into the casino area.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(Three women walk into the casino: One blonde, One brunette, and One red-head. The blonde stops near the entrance. The brunette and red-head continue on into the casino.)</p>
<p>(The SECURITY OFFICERS continue to push the metal cart full of cash boxes through the casino.)</p>
<p>(The blonde woman pulls out a gun and shoots at the huge chandelier hanging from the ceiling, hitting it and making it crash to the floor below.)</p>
<p>(Customers start screaming and scrambling for cover.)</p>
<p>(The brunette and the red-headed woman both pull out their guns and start to fire. They both manage to hit the two SECURITY OFFICERS.)</p>
<p>(The two women continue to the metal cart with the cash boxes. They start to put the cash boxes into a bag. The woman at the entrance continues to watch their escape route.)</p>
<p>(Another SECURITY OFFICER rushes down the entrance stairs. The red-haired woman shoots and hits the SECURITY OFFICER.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(In the security camera office, SECURITY OFFICERS call for additional help as all hell breaks loose on the multiple monitors in front of them.)</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong>: Section G-4. SECURITY: Security three intersect at G-5. SECURITY: Where the hell is metro?!</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(The three women have their cash boxes and start to leave. The gunfire increases exponentially as they make their way to the exit. Additional SECURITY OFFICERS start to fire from behind the bar.)</p>
<p>(The red-headed woman gets shot and falls to the ground. The other two escape.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. HOTEL CASINO -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and BRASS walk down the entrance stairs into the casino. GRISSOM carries his kit while BRASS fills him in.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And the body count?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Five guards, three civilians wounded. One dead bad guy. Armed robbers snatched the lock boxes from the two high-stakes tables right off the rolling cage.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Cash on wheels.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Busiest time of night. Three women-organized and muscled.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Small time crooks, Jim.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hey, they got away with 250K.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah? That's a mere pittance to a Vegas casino. Cashiers alone are sitting on a million and change.</p>
<p>(They reach the red-haired woman.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Small time or not these ladies are dangerous.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM glances down a the body. He puts his kit down and kneels down next to the body. The looks up at BRASS.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Dangerous, yes. Ladies ...</p>
<p>(GRISSOM reaches over and pulls the red-haired wig off of the &quot;woman&quot;. He holds it up to BRASS and shakes his head.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: ... no.</p>
<p>(BRASS shrugs.)</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />

[INT CASINO - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The wounded are being tended to. WARRICK and NICK go through the scene. WARRICK is kneeling on the floor looking through a small instrument measuring the base of a discarded bullet.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: These guys packed enough .45 caliber ammo for a small army.</p>
<p>(NICK picks up a bullet from the floor near marker #6.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Security managed to return a few rounds. Nine millimeter.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Less than a year ago security couldn't even carry guns.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Times have changed.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
(BRASS and GRISSOM talk in the casino.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The same M.O. as Laughlin. Last month, cottage casino, men dressed as women shot the place to hell. In and out in under five.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: My bet was that that was the practice run.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: And the more you practice ...</p>
<p>(BRASS and GRISSOM walk up to MAX DUNCAN talking with an OFFICER. They overhear part of what he says.)</p>
<p><strong>Max Duncan</strong>: I don't know what the hell's going on with the world. Everything's crazy. I risk my life just coming into work. Makes you miss the mob days, huh? Back then, this never would've happened. And if it did, those scumbags, they'd be dead, every last one of them and we would never know about it.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Mr ... Mr. Duncan -- take a deep breath and tell us what happened.</p>
<p><strong>Max Duncan</strong>: We'd just made a money transfer to the rolling cages. Then, bang-- the chandelier comes crashing down. Sounded like an explosion. So I dropped to my knees-- I took cover.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>Max Duncan</strong>: Yeah, I started praying for the gunfire to stop.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Okay. Thanks a lot. And check in with triage before you leave. </p>
<p>(MAX DUNCAN leaves.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, that was helpful.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (looking at the chandelier) Actually, it was. Gives us a starting point.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The chandelier flares and starts to fall from the ceiling. People run for cover. The &quot;woman&quot; in red pulls out her gun and shoots the guards.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) The falling chandelier distracts the guards. Makes them easy targets.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The armed robbers load up, head for the exits.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Quick escape.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Chaos moving in one direction, the money moving in the other.</p>

[INT. CAR - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and SARA drive to the crime scene.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Can you imagine living out here?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It's peaceful.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Peaceful? The town just lost five percent of its population.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I thought you said this was a single homicide.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, in a population of 20.</p>
<p>(SARA smiles. The car turns into the parking lot.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We made it. State trooper.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE parks the car. They get out of the car.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer Spencer</strong>: Two hours to drive 75 miles. You guys got lost.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What's the rush? Crime scene's not going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Spencer</strong>: Yeah, but I am. Body's behind the counter. Dustin Bale -- store clerk. Bullet through the chest. The register's empty.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Officer Spencer, did you touch anything?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Spencer</strong>: Fourteen years as a state trooper. I know how to secure a crime scene without contaminating the evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Spencer</strong>: It's okay. Look, I cover 97.5 square miles. I got to book.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and SARA head for the store.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. GENERAL STORE - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(They enter the store and look around. The sign in the door says &quot;Closed&quot;. They put their kits down and look at the stuff on the floor.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Vomit?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE picks up a sample and smells it. She shakes her head.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Not an expectorate. Potato. Blown to smithereens.</p>
<p>(SARA thinks about it.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: A poor man's silencer.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV to: A side view of a gun firing through a potato and the potato shattering into bits. End of CGI POV.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Now, why would an assailant need silencer way out here?</p>
<p>(SARA stands up and picks up a potato from the stand. She goes behind the counter. She sees the body on the floor. She steps over the body and checks the cash register slip.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Last paying customer -- eight hours ago.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We just got the call. The place is open 24 seven. Why'd it take so long?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: A person leaving the store and turning the sign in the door over.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (V.O.) The assailant flipped the sign on the way out, buying him time to get away.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks up and sees the security camera high in the ceiling.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: But now without getting his picture taken first.</p>
<p>(SARA steps up and checks the camera.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It's plastic.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You're joking.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Nine volt attached to a blinking light.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Real or fake, it didn't work.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>

[INT. CASINO -- NIGHT]</p>

<p><strong>Elderly Woman</strong>: There were four of those lunatics. They were everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>Elderly Woman</strong>: (insistent) Write it down.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I got it. Thank you very much. Excuse me.</p>
<p>(BRASS walks away from the ELDERLY WOMAN. GRISSOM walks up to BRASS.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (clears throat) I've interviewed 17 people. No two accounts are alike.</p>
<p>(He puts his notebook away.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: A Harvard Professor conducted an experiment. Asked a bunch of students to watch a basketball game -- count the number of times the ball was passed. </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, groundbreaking.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: During the game a person dressed in a gorilla suit ran across the court. Afterwards, the professor asked his students if they noticed the gorilla. Fifty percent responded, &quot;What gorilla?&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Valet</strong>: The car was sitting right here.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Did you get a good look at it? Make, model?</p>
<p><strong>Valet</strong>: No. It was beige, beat up. Hazards flashing. People leave their cars here all the time. I wait ten minutes then call for a tow.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Car peel out?</p>
<p><strong>Valet</strong>: No. The driver gunned it but I didn't hear a screech.</p>
<p>(NICK looks at the small oil spill on the ground. He smells it.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Smells like burnt wood.</p>
<p><strong>Valet</strong>: Motor oil? </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No. No, transmission fluid. But it's brown, not red.</p>
<p><strong>Valet</strong>: Which means?</p>

<p>(ROBBINS removes the bullet from the body. GRISSOM walks into the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Extraction is an art, Albert.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: I like to think so. So this is our cross-dresser in thee ? I.D.'d as Adam Brower, shot in the back with a hollow point -- close range. Mushroomed upon impact maximizing trauma.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV to: The bullet enters the flesh and opens up. End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Caliber?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Forty-five. </p>
<p>(He puts the bullet in the tin.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The guards were armed with nine millimeters and they weren't hollow point. So ... he was shot in the back by one of his own partners?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Someone didn't want to share.</p>
<p>(Camera holds on GRISSOM.)</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Wow. A fumette. Did you get that out of some museum?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, don't knock it. It's still the best tool for lifting prints off cardboard.</p>
<p>(The sign shows many prints.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (quietly) Blow and print.</p>
<p>(SARA finishes clearing the counter and kneels down to look at it closely.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: If you were in a hurry how would you get back there?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Easy. Jump the counter.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Exactly what I'm thinking.</p>
<p>(SARA pulls out a machine and checks the counter.)</p>

<p>(On the monitor, the frame is on pause and the picture of the woman in Red is enlarged.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No amount of makeup in the world could cover up that chunk of adam's apple. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That must be the one that killed Brower. .45 in the back at close range. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The Red shooting the Blue in the back.)</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (picks up a power container and looks at it) You know, I've never tried green ...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I should've never been sent to this remote scene in the first place. I've got seniority. I deserve -- no, I've earned the right to pick my cases.</p>
<p>(Without a word, SARA walks over to the front of the counter and hands CATHERINE a candy bar. CATHERINE opens it.)</p>

<p><strong>Archie Johnson</strong>: I've divided the photo into segments removed the disguise and rebuilt the original image based on male physiological norms. Now, it's not exact but you'll have an idea of what your guy looks like.</p>
<p>(SARA recognizes the man on screen.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: That's Dustin Bale. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The clerk from the convenience store.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Whoa. Hold on. He was killed hours before the tower club heist. In on Laughlin, out on Vegas. So, Darin took him out first. They cleared the register just to make it look like a robbery.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: But the pit boss said it was Darin plus three.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Because he knew there were four at the Laughlin heist.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, maybe he didn't know that the clerk wasn't there. He wasn't counting wigs. He was hiding under a blackjack table.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: And we're back to who killed Darin Hanson.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>

[INT. CSI - BALLISTICS LAB]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and NICK walk into the lab.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Bobby D.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We need your help.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: Another round from the casino heist?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Indirectly, yeah.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE hands BOBBY the envelope. He takes the bullet out and looks at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: Well, tip didn't blossom. Not a hollow point, so it's not from Darin Hanson's gun.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No, it's from his head.</p>
<p>(BOBBY DAWSON looks at NICK, surprised. He weighs the bullet.)</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: All right, 230 grains gives us a .45 automatic.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What else?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: Okay, normally, lands and grooves are highly delineated. (The monitor shows the side of the bullet.) These are smooth, polished, which means that your projectile was fired from a polygonal barrel. Be right back.</p>
<p>(BOBBY goes into the cage and takes out two gun samples.)</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: These are the only types of .45 automatics with polygonal barrels. So, the gun that fired your bullet was either a Heckler &amp; Koch USP or a Glock.</p>
<p>(BOBBY looks at the bullet again.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Narrow it further.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: (smiling) Well, that's what I'm doing: Dissecting your bullet.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: Hey, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>(BOBBY steps back and lets NICK count the stripes on the monitor.)</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: Count the stripes.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: One, two, three, four, five, six.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: Six lands angroves with a right-hand twist.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: Glock's got eight; Heckler and Koch-- six. You got your gun.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Let's run ATF.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: Pretty unique weapon. Expensive. Not exactly what you'd buy out of the back of a van.</p>
<p>(He inputs the information into the database.)</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: Only take a second.</p>
<p>(The printer beeps and prints the results.)</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: (smiling) See? Can I call it? Only 18 registered in-state. Ten in Clark County; seven of them still in circulation.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks at the results.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Any names jumping off the page?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Just one. It's out of left field. About 75 miles out.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks at NICK.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. CLARK COUNTY - NIGHT]</p>
<hr />
[INT. -- DAY]</p>
<p>(BRASS, GRISSOM and CATHERINE question the State Trooper, OFFICER SPENCER.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer Spencer</strong>: You're accusing me of murder?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: And absconding with a quarter of mill stolen money.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Where did you stash the cash?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Spencer</strong>: I'm a state trooper.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: How does a cop hook up with an ex-con like Darin?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I can answer that. It's all in a day's work.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: OFFICER SPENCER rides in his vehicle and sees the car parked outside the store. He hears the gunshot. He gets out of his vehicle and draws his gun. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: A potato silencer muffles a bullet but won't silence it. You went in your gun drawn.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: OFFICER SPENCER enters the store with his gun drawn. He sees TAMMY FELTON behind the counter and DARIN HANSON points his gun at OFFICER SPENCER.)</p>
<p><strong>Darin Hanson</strong>: Take it easy, pal.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You should have arrested them. But something happened, didn't it? My bet, Tammy made you an offer.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: TAMMY FELTON walks around the counter carrying some cash.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer Spencer</strong>: Drop the weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Tammy Felton</strong>: Hey, uh, let's be smart about this. You can take us in or we can cut you in.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: They still had pockets full of cash from the Laughlin job. They offered you a finder's fee.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: SPENCER looks at the cash that TAMMY FELTON holds out to him.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer Spencer</strong>: This isn't going to do it.</p>
<p><strong>Darin Hanson</strong>: It'll hold you over ... till tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>Tammy Felton</strong>: Deal?</p>
<p>(Cut to: TAMMY and DARIN walk across the parking lot toward their car. SPENCER leaves the store and flips the sign over on his way out. The door closes behind him.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE kneels and looks at SPENCER'S shoes and pants.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer Spencer</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You patrol on 97.5 square miles. Is the calnevari mine a part of your jurisdiction?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Spencer</strong>: No. I'm east of the mine.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: But you've been there haven't you?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: At the Calnevari mine, OFFICER SPENCER looks at the motorcycle. He draws his gun and approaches the shed. He opens the shed door and catches DARIN HANSON inside. He aims and shoots. He closes the door and looks around. He puts his gun back in his holster and leaves.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Where is the cash?</p>
<p>(OFFICER SPENCER doesn't say anything.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Jim, hit the overhead, will you?</p>
<p>(BRASS turns the lights off.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Silica is a crystal. It reflects the light. Even trace amounts will show up. (chuckles) Huh. How about that?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM follows the silica trail into the hallway and into the locker room. He pushes the door open and follows it to the locker.)</p>
<p>(He opens the locker. OFFICER SPENCER still doesn't say anything. He watches as GRISSOM finds the false bottom on the locker floor. He removes the locker and pulls out the bag with the money inside.)</p>
<p>(SPENCER kneels down.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer Spencer</strong>: More than I'd make in a lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Was it worth it?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Spencer</strong>: You wouldn't understand.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: That's right. We make the big bucks.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Spencer</strong>: Look -- I was never &quot;that&quot; guy. You know, that guy that wins the jackpots gets promoted, catches the breaks? It was right there.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, well, you're still not that guy. Get him out of here.</p>
<p>(The OFFICER escorts SPENCER out of the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: $250,000 turned a career cop bad.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, well, he had his price.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We all do.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns to look at CATHERINE. She smiles at him. Camera holds on GRISSOM.)</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>

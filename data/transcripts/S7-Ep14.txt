<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) – NIGHT]</p>
<p>[EXT. ROAD -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(The road is busy, crowded with cars. Sirens wail in the distance. Keppler walks toward the scene with his kit.) </p>
<p>(He nods to Sofia and ducks under the tape the officer holds up for him. He meets up with Nick. Together, they head toward the burned house.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: The vic is Ross Neddy. Ex-con. Spent a couple years in Jean for domestic assault. Just got paroled.</p>
<p>(They look at the dead body.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Shop foreman says he's only been working here a few days.</p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: Out of the frying pan into the fire.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: He is a crispy critter. I'd say the point of origin was him.</p>
<p>(Keppler kneels.) </p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: He should have stayed in prison.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mmm-hmm.</p>
<p>(Keppler sees the burned gasoline can next to the body.) </p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: Sloppy shop. This whole place is a fire hazard.</p>
<p>(David walks up to Nick.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Okay if I move him out?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, he's all yours, Super Dave.</p>
<p>(Inside the room, Greg sweeps the floor with a hand-held device. It beeps.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: There was a lot of gasoline over here. (Keppler joins Greg.) Which explains this V-pattern.</p>
<p>(Greg indicates the burn on the wall.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Accelerant, a second point of origin. Most likely arson.</p>
<p>(Nick snaps a photo.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Ex-con.</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: Someone douses the place with gasoline and lights a torch.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (V.O.) Enemies on the outside ... two points of origin ... maybe we're looking at a little payback. </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(Nick turns to Keppler.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What do you think, Keppler?</p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: I think I'd better head back to the body.</p>
<p>(Keppler steps past Nick and heads out. Nick calls out after him.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey ... you know what Grissom would say here, don't you?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Something ironic, I'm sure.</p>
<p>(David and the coroner pass by with the body. Nick nods.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Keppler and David Phillips roll the body on the table onto its side. Keppler looks at the back and cuts the shirt down the middle. He peels the material apart and finds the body's back is stapled together down the middle.) </p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: Looks like somebody took a staple gun to him.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[CU: X-RAY]</p>
<p>(X-ray images of the bones in the body's legs appear on the monitor as Dr. Robbins and Keppler look at the images on screen. They reach the thighs and they know they're not looking at bones.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Those aren't bones.</p>
<p>(Keppler leans forward and looks at the monitor.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(Robbins removes the stables in the body's back. He reaches in and pulls out a pipe.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(Robbins opens the back of the body's upper right thigh while Keppler opens the back of the body's upper left thigh. Robbins removes another pipe.) </p>
<p>(Keppler removes an umbrella. The umbrella pops open.) </p>
<p>(oops.)</p>
<p>(Keppler moves the umbrella aside and finds Robbins spattered with blood. Robbins looks drolly back at Keppler as he wipes the blood from his scrubs top.)</p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: That's bad luck, isn't it?</p>
<p>SMASH TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[INT. CSI – FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Robbins goes over his findings with Keppler, Nick and Greg.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: ABC piping is sometimes used to replace bones that have been donated for transplants.</p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: So that the body looks right at open casket?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: They use umbrellas and broomsticks for that, too?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Not that I've seen.</p>
<p>(Greg looks at the bottom of the umbrella and notices a distinct logo.) </p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: Wait a minute, they killed the guy and torched him; there's no open casket. What's the point of stuffing the body?</p>
<p>(Nick has his hands in the body.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Looks like the long bones are gone ... ditto for the spine ... tendons and cartilage ... most major veins ... phew.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: They took the heart valves, too.</p>
<p>(Nick looks at the part of the heart that's left.) </p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: So somebody murders an ex-con, then commits arson to make it look like an accident just so that they can harvest his bones and tissues?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: That's big business -- disc replacement, joint replacement, bypasses-- more demand than supply.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Why leave the kidneys, the heart and the liver? They're worth big money, too.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Organ donation is heavily regulated. Bone and tissue aren't.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: COD?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: At this point, indeterminate. All I can say right now is based on the level of decomp, he's been dead at least a week.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – BULLPEN – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Sofia talks with Joe Boony.) </p>
<p><strong>Joe Boony</strong>: You think I'm selling body parts? Come on, you're wasting your time. I sell refurbished engines. I don't know jack about body parts.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: No one's looking for a down-and-out ex-con. It's less risky than drugs.</p>
<p>(He points to the photo of Ross Neddy.) </p>
<p><strong>Joe Boony</strong>: I hired Ross to weld metal together. Even if I killed him -- not saying I did -- but if even if I did, I'd just burn the body as is, not re-pipe the guy. And I definitely wouldn't burn him at work. Fire station's a block away.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: How do you know Ross? You meet him in the joint?</p>
<p><strong>Joe Boony</strong>: I was out before he even went in. I picked Ross up with a bunch of other guys looking for work outside that big hardware store on Herrick four days ago.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: When was the last time you saw him?</p>
<p><strong>Joe Boony</strong>: Four days ago. He'd been working nights.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Really? 'Cause the coroner said he's been dead at least a week.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Boony</strong>: You calling me a liar?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: I'd believe a dead guy over an ex-con.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Boony</strong>: Ouch.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS (STOCK) – DAY]</p>
<p>[EXT. NORTON RESIDENCE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Brass, Warrick and Sara duck under the crime scene tape on their way to the large plush house.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Living large.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Mm.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Place this big in MacDonald Ranch -- what's the occupation?</p>
<p>(Brass looks over his shoulder at the man leaning against the car.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: That's, uh, Bill Dorton. You know, Dorton Homes. Biggest homebuilder in town. He built mine. </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p>(They reach the front door.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, uh ... you'd better throw on some booties.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. DORTON RESIDENCE – LIVING ROOM – DAY]</p>
<p>(The body is on the carpeted floor between the coffee table and the couch. The carpet is soaked with blood.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Margo Dorton, age 39.</p>
<p>(Sara puts her kit down. Warrick snaps photos of the body and surrounding areas.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Her husband said he returned from a business trip and found her like this. No sign of a forced entry. My guys are gonna go talk to the neighbors, see what they say about their relationship.</p>
<p>(Brass turns to leave.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What did he say?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: According to him, it was a honeymoon every day.</p>
<p>(Brass leaves. Warrick turns and looks at Sara. Sara shrugs.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Maybe ... she was having a honeymoon with someone else.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: That'll be good motive for the husband.</p>
<p>(Sara notices the patch of blood-free couch.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: There's a void here. Maybe someone was sitting on the couch, or someone was sitting on the floor in front of the couch.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: But then where's the &quot;someone else&quot;? I mean, why kill her and not the lover?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Bill Dorton sits on the couch and is kissing someone else. His wife walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (V.O.) Maybe the husband was the one having the honeymoon and the ... the wife walks in.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: He kills her, tells his lover to beat it.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'd buy it. Unless the husband's alibi checks out.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. DORTON RESIDENCE – FRONT – DAY]</p>
<p>(Brass talks with Bill Dorton.) </p>
<p><strong>Bill Dorton</strong>: Airport. I was coming home from the airport. It's a business trip. Caught an early flight to surprise Margo. I want your best cops on this. I contributed a lot to this community.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Absolutely. Let's establish a timeline. What time did your plane land?</p>
<p><strong>Bill Dorton</strong>: Around 10:30.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: 10:30. And you arrived here at ...</p>
<p><strong>Bill Dorton</strong>: Midnight.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, it took you an hour and a half at that time of night to get from McKaren to here?</p>
<p><strong>Bill Dorton</strong>: (crying) A half an hour waiting for baggage check, and half an hour to find my driver, and a half an hour to get home.</p>
<p>[INT. DORTON RESIDENCE]</p>
<p>(Warrick finds a ticket and key in Margo's purse.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Look at this. Valet ticket. Nice purse. Nice dress. Maybe safe to say she went out last night. Maybe this will tell where.</p>
<p>(Sara finds some hair.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Maybe this ... will tell us who.</p>
<p>(Warrick snaps a photo. He looks down and sees the trail of blood.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'm gonna follow a little lead I got.</p>
<p>(Warrick follows the blood drops into the bathroom. The blood drops lead to the toilet. There's a drop on the seat. He takes a swab sample of it. There's also a stain on the floor. He tests the stain. It's positive for blood.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (V.O.) Well, I found a circular blood transfer in the bathroom ... </p>
<p>(Warrick reports his findings with Sara.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: ... about three inches in diameter.</p>
<p>(They look around and see the bottle on the table.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara/Warrick</strong>: Champagne bottle.</p>
<p>(Sara checks it.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Looks like it's been wiped down.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Looks like we found our murder weapon.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – FORENSIC AUTOPSY] </p>
<p>(Keppler cuts off a finger and sticks it in a liquid-filled sample container. He adds some powder to the container and shakes it.) </p>
<p>[INT. CSI – PRINT LAB]</p>
<p>(Back at the lab, he injects the solution into the finger, then takes a print off the finger.)</p>
<p>(He runs the finger through the database and finds a match to a ROGER LAPINSKY.) </p>
<p>(He runs the name ROGER LAPINSKY through SPYDER FINDER. He finds an obituary.) </p>
<p>[CU: HEADLINE]</p>
<p>(The online headline reads: Roger Lapinsky Dies at age 37.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (V.O.) So the crispy critter isn't Ross Neddy?</p>
<p>[INT. CSI – HALLWAY -- DAY]</p>
<p>(Keppler shares his findings with Nick.) </p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Let me get this straight. The ex-con digs up a corpse, scoops out a few body parts to sell, then fills it back up with PVC and umbrellas, then torches the body where he works to make it look like he's the victim?</p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: Cops don't come looking for you if you're already dead.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: But if this Lapinsky guy was already dead, then how come the doc didn't find traces of embalming fluid?</p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: He's Jewish.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So what?</p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: Observant Jews don't believe in embalming or donating organs. It's part of their faith. They think the body should go out the way it came in.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So, this isn't just about desecration of the body, but of the family as well.</p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: Mmm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I'll get a court order for the exhumation.</p>
<p>(Nick heads off in one direction, Keppler heads off in the other. We stay with Keppler.) </p>
<p>[INT. CSI – KEPPLER'S OFFICE – DAY – CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Keppler walks into his office and puts his cup down on the desk. He looks through his mail and stops on a particular envelope. He opens the envelope.) </p>
<p>(Inside is a funeral program for:<br />
AMY MCCARTY<br />
JUNE 28, 1969 – JANUARY 22, 1983</p>
<p>You are cordially invited to a celebration of life in remembrance of Amy.</p>
<p>January 22, 2007<br />
7:00 pm</p>
<p>St. Martine's Church<br />
5689 Gelson Way, Trenton, New Jersey</p>
<p>(Keppler sits down. He flips the program over and finds a note:<br />
We missed you this year kiddo.<br />
Be well.<br />
Fr. Anthony</p>
<p>(Keppler takes a deep breath. He looks at Amy's photo on the cover.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – TRACE LAB] </p>
<p>(Hodges is looking through the scope when Warrick walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What you got?</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Well, looks like your killer wigged out on your vic.</p>
<p>(He steps aside and Warrick looks through the scope.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Use the polarizer. The pink fiber's modacrylic with low birefringence. Most likely made of elura.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Synthetic hair. So much for DNA.</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: And the substance you found in the toilet -- if it looks like vomit and smells like vomit, it is.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – HALLWAY – DAY]</p>
<p>(Sara reports her findings to Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The champagne glasses were negative for DNA, and Mandy found nothing but smears and partials on them. And the blood from the champagne bottle just came back to the vic.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Any good news?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, I called the phone number on the valet stub. It was a company called Chariot Parking. They operate the parking lots at thirty restaurants and nightclubs.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, well, that narrows it down.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Actually, it does. The ticket on Margo Dorton's key ring came from a batch at the Over-Under Cabaret.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. OVER-UNDER CABARET] </p>
<p>(Warrick and Sara enter the club. Warrick stops a dancer and shows her a photo.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Excuse me, have you seen this man?</p>
<p>(She looks at the photo and shakes her head.) </p>
<p><strong>Dancer</strong>: No. <strong>Warrick</strong>: No. Thank you.</p>
<p>(Warrick and Sara continue through the club.) </p>
<p><strong>Announcer (over speakers)</strong>: All right, guys! Listen up! Get ready for tonight's panty auction!</p>
<p>(The crowd applauds.) </p>
<p>(Sara walks up to a worker and shows her the photo.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hello. Have you seen this man?</p>
<p><strong>Dancer</strong>: No.</p>
<p>(Dancer leaves.) </p>
<p><strong>Announcer</strong>: All right. For our first pair, starting at the low price of $50, Cotton Candy! Doesn't accept checks, just cold, hard cash.</p>
<p>(The first dancer appears on stage. She's wearing pink underwear and a pink wig.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Check out the pink wig.</p>
<p>(The crowd goes wild. Sara holds up her badge just as the dancer takes her panties off.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Bid!</p>
<p>(Cotton Candy stops. Sara smiles at her.) </p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>

<p>(The officers hold Cotton Candy as Warrick handles her pink wig.) </p>
<p><strong>Cotton Candy</strong>: Come on, come on. Why you got to take the wig? Wig's part of my act.</p>
<p>(Warrick hands the pink wig to Sara.) </p>
<p><strong>Cotton Candy</strong>: Y'all are straight stealing from me right now! Hello!</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'm crying for you.</p>
<p>(Sara examines the wig.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Synthetic. Same color and texture as the one that we collected off the vic.</p>
<p>(Warrick motions to the officer, who puts handcuffs on Cotton Candy.) </p>
<p><strong>Cotton Candy</strong>: Whoa, wh ... Hey, hey, hey! Look, look, look, look, look. Look, we didn't even have s*x, okay? It was all touchy feely. Jerky treats.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>Cotton Candy</strong>: The guy I took into VIP right before panty auction. Look, man, all we did was touch.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Why do you think you're being arrested?</p>
<p><strong>Cotton Candy</strong>: Solicitation, right?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No, actually. We found this hair on this woman's dead body.</p>
<p><strong>Cotton Candy</strong>: Margo? She's dead? And you think I killed her?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: With or without the help of her husband.</p>
<p><strong>Cotton Candy</strong>: No, no, no. Look, man, I never seen dude in that picture. And Margo, yeah, I'll admit, I slapped the ho around last night, but I didn't kill her.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You slapped her around?</p>
<p><strong>Cotton Candy</strong>: She's always hanging out with my fiancé, okay? I couldn't take it anymore, so ... yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What's your fiancé's name?</p>
<p><strong>Cotton Candy</strong>: Jesse.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(Warrick walks away.) </p>
<p>(The head host walks up to Sara.) </p>
<p><strong>Head Host</strong>: Would you like a Meet Book or do you have a steady host?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Uh, actually, it's my first time. What exactly goes on here?</p>
<p><strong>Head Host</strong>: This is a host club, a place where men entertain women. It's the first of its kind in Las Vegas. They started in Japan. Take your pick.</p>
<p>(He offers her a thick binder. Sara takes it and looks through it.) </p>
<p><strong>Head Host</strong>: Hosts get paid by the bottle. There's a two-bottle minimum. Bottles range from $50 to $5,000.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What's a $5,000 bottle of champagne taste like?</p>
<p><strong>Head Host</strong>: We only sell one brand of champagne. It's the host attached to the bottle that determines price.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Oh. Everything is legal in Clark County.</p>
<p><strong>Head Host</strong>: Miss, we don't sell s*x here.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What do you sell?</p>
<p><strong>Head Host</strong>: A relationship. Isn't that what most women want?</p>
<p>(She flips through the book and stops at a photo.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I don't know. But I know what I want. I want Jesse.</p>
<p><strong>Head Host</strong>: Who doesn't? Let me see if he's avail.</p>
<p>(He takes the binder from her, turns and leaves Sara. Sara looks inside the room where one man sits with three women. The host approaches the man and talks to him. It's Jesse.) </p>

<p>(Meanwhile, Warrick has a chat with the bus boy.) </p>
<p><strong>Bus Boy</strong>: Never seen the old guy before, but the lady, a bunch. Last night, she got blasted on by one of the strippers downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Really?</p>
<p>(Someone retches. Warrick turns and sees two men run into the men's room.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Are they doing what I think they're doing?</p>
<p><strong>Bus Boy</strong>: Hosts get paid by the bottle. So they drink more than their stomachs can handle. Always see blood in those toilets.</p>
<p>(Warrick nods.) </p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Do you know this woman?</p>
<p><strong>Jesse Hottman</strong>: Ah. Lady Dorton. Yeah, she's one of my relationships.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Could I ask you a few questions about her?</p>
<p><strong>Jesse Hottman</strong>: Okay. Um, I don't like to talk about my relationships out here. Let's take it someplace a little more intimate, yeah?</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: The coffin had only been in the ground for about a week. Dirt and sod were pretty loose, so it was relatively easy to take out and put back in.</p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: You guys sure do a lot of exhumations here.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: As many as we have to.</p>
<p>(Keppler and Nick each grab a cover. They open the coffin and find it empty of a body.) </p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: Nobody home.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No surprise.</p>
<p>(Keppler takes out his flashlight while Nick snaps photos of the inside of the coffin.) </p>
<p>(Keppler finds a piece of cloth caught in the wood.) </p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: Look at this. (He picks it up.) Lapinsky may have been burned in this shirt, but I doubt he was buried in it. </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Dead men don't wear plaid. (Nick finds something.) Wait a minute. Is this blood?</p>
<p>(Nick points to the red spots at the bottom of the box.) </p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: And then what?</p>
<p><strong>Jesse Hottman</strong>: Uh, she wanted what most women want.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What's that?</p>
<p>(He offers her a drink. She declines.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Jesse Hottman</strong>: The dream.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: And that's you.</p>
<p><strong>Jesse Hottman</strong>: 50 G's I make a month says I am. Who doesn't want to be swept off their feet?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I am not sure it's something that I would pay for.</p>
<p><strong>Jesse Hottman</strong>: Yeah, but you don't want to spend your whole life waiting for it either. Right here, right now, a woman can have a relationship with a man who only wants to please her -- who can make her laugh, wipe away her tears, give her the confidence to be herself.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: And how many of these relationships do you have?</p>
<p><strong>Jesse Hottman</strong>: I can handle about twenty-five at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Is a woman named Cotton Candy one of them?</p>
<p><strong>Jesse Hottman</strong>: Yeah. She's been financially worshipping me for a while.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Now, she says that she is your fiancée.</p>
<p><strong>Jesse Hottman</strong>: That's good. Means I'm doing my job.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: She told me that she and Margo had a scuffle.</p>
<p><strong>Jesse Hottman</strong>: Yeah. Um ... my relationships do get jealous sometimes, especially when one has more money than the other and can monopolize my time. Is that why you're here, because of that little catfight?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No. Um, Margo Dorton was ... bludgeoned to death with a bottle of champagne.</p>
<p><strong>Jesse Hottman</strong>: Margo was ... killed?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah. </p>
<p><strong>Jesse Hottman</strong>: And you think Cotton Candy killed Margo?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Jesse Hottman</strong>: Um ... I wouldn't know.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Would you know if Margo took you home the other night?</p>
<p><strong>Jesse Hottman</strong>: I don't see my relationships outside of here. You know, if it does happen, it marks the end of the relationship. I mean, by having s*x with me, a woman's reached her goal. There's nothing more I can give her.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Did Margo's husband know about you?</p>
<p><strong>Jesse Hottman</strong>: She told me she was divorced.</p>

<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: So he's got a partner.</p>
<p>(Wendy sits at the computer.) </p>
<p><strong>Wendy Simms</strong>: Well, DNA matches a Heidi Sultz, who did time for domestic assault and is currently out on parole.</p>

<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: Where'd you get this, the dollar store? Have a seat, Ross.</p>
<p>(Ross Neddy sits down.) </p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: This is your third strike, pal. Right now you're looking at a minimum of 25 years. You want to talk to us? We can make sure it doesn't get any worse. What do you say?</p>
<p>(The baby fusses in the playpen.)</p>
<p><strong>Ross Neddy</strong>: Daddy will be right there, sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: It's ten more for falsifying an ID. Fifteen for grave robbing. Arson, that's another ten.</p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: Desecrating a corpse, ten; another twenty for trafficking body parts.</p>
<p><strong>Ross Neddy</strong>: Body parts? No way. I thought those cuts were from, like, an autopsy.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: So you admit to digging up Roger Lapinsky?</p>
<p><strong>Ross Neddy</strong>: I've been out two months and the best job I can get is five bucks an hour welding engine parts together. They wouldn't even let me flip burgers. Heidi just had the baby. It wasn't like it was gonna hurt anyone.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Ross and Heidi dig up a corpse and set it on fire.) </p>
<p><strong>Ross Neddy</strong>: (V.O.) We dug up someone my age, took him to work. Made him look like me. And then we torched it.</p>

<p><strong>Cotton Candy</strong>: He doesn't care about them.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Now you know this is not a real relationship. It's a business transaction.</p>

<p>(He goes to the filing cabinet and opens the drawer. Keppler follows him and notices the stack of umbrellas from Longevity Tissue Services.) </p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: I take it you do a lot a work with, uh ... Longevity Tissue Services?</p>
<p><strong>Salvatore Heinz</strong>: Some.</p>
<p>(He looks back and notices Keppler looking at the umbrellas.) </p>
<p><strong>Salvatore Heinz</strong>: Those are just promotional items. </p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: Handy in a pinch, huh?</p>
<p>(Keppler sees the death certificates on the desk. The filing cabinet drawer closes and Salvatore Heinz hands Keppler the file.) </p>
<p><strong>Salvatore Heinz</strong>: Lapinsky, Roger. It's all yours. I got copies.</p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Salvatore Heinz</strong>: COD, cardiac arrest.</p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: Everything seems to be in order here.</p>
<p><strong>Salvatore Heinz</strong>: Like I said.</p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: Thanks for your time.</p>
<p>(As Keppler heads for the door, his phone rings. He answers it.) </p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: (to phone) Keppler.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (from phone) Robbins here. Want a COD on your Frankenstein?</p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: (to phone) Beat you to it -- cardiac arrest.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (from phone) Not according to histology. Roger Lapinsky died of leukemia. </p>
<p>(Keppler puts his phone on speaker mode and holds it out so Salvatore Heinz can hear.) </p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: You want to repeat that, Doc?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (from phone) Sure. Roger Lapinksy died of leukemia.</p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: Thanks. (He hangs up.) If you don't mind, I'll, uh ... stick around here till the warrant comes.</p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[INT. CSI – LAYOUT ROOM] </p>
<p>(Keppler shows Nick the two death certificates.) </p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: I got a copy of Roger Lapinsky's death certificate from Carson City. This is the one we got from the mortician, that old nut job, see? Changed the COD.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: It turns out, Ty Miloni ... is a bit of a hustler as well.</p>
<p>(Nick shows Keppler a copy of a LAS VEGAS GLOBE article.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Those umbrellas were a promotional gift for a vitamin telemarketing company he ran a few years back. </p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: This guy isn't even a doctor. </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: He did drop out of chiropractic school.</p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: You're telling me that any Tom, Dick, or Harry with a sign can open up a tissue bank?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, if you're FDA registered, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: How do you get FDA registered?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You just fill out a form. In the last three years, 37 of the bone and tissue donors were from Silver Hills Mortuary that went to this Longevity clinic.</p>
<p>(Nick shows Keppler the database list with the items highlighted.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: COD in 23 of those cases was cardiac arrest. And most of those decedents were in their thirties and forties.</p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: That's a lot of young heart attacks. We're going to go through all these COD's and match them up against the official death certificates.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: And do more exhumations.</p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: The only thing I'm wondering -- is the mortician hustling the tissue bank guy or they're working together.</p>
<p>[CU: EVIDENCE/PROPERTY BAG LABEL]</p>
<p>(It reads:<br />
AGENCY: CSI CASE NO. 1716<br />
ITEM NO. OFFENSE.<br />
SUSPECT: LVPD 0702011716NS<br />
VICTIM<br />
DATE AND TIME OF RECOVERY: 2-1-07<br />
RECOVERED BY: NS<br />
DESCRIPTION AND/OR LOCATION<br />
DESKTOP EVIDENCE<br />
S. HEINZ<br />
SEALED BY: NS DATE: 2-1-07</p>
<p>(Keppler puts the items down on the table. He looks at the two death certificates and then notices the desktop calendar. He takes the calendar out of the box and looks at the indentions on the paper.) </p>
<p>(He scans the paper in the computer, then dusts the paper to bring out the indentions.)</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: Salvatore Heinz writes over the signature, then flips to the death certificate to forge the signature. End of flashback.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – INTERVIEW ROOM 1]</p>
<p>(Keppler shows Salvatore Heinz a photocopy of the various signature indentions found on his desktop calendar.) </p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: Dr. Stewart, Dr. Klein, Dr. Combs, Dr. Jones.</p>
<p><strong>Salvatore Heinz</strong>: That's not my handwriting.</p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: Well that's the point of forgery, isn't it, Mr. Heinz? A man dies of leukemia, and his body comes into your mortuary, and you decide to ... sell his spare parts for a few extra bucks. Only problem is, nobody wants to buy diseased body parts, so you make a new death certificate, change the COD, sign off with a legit doctor's signature, and cash a check from Ty Miloni.</p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – INTERVIEW ROOM 2]</p>
<p>(Sofia interviews Ty Miloni.) </p>
<p><strong>Ty Miloni</strong>: I'm so disappointed with Mr. Heinz. He always seemed so honest.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Have you ever followed up on any of the patients who received parts from the Silver Hills Mortuary?</p>
<p><strong>Ty Miloni</strong>: No. That's the hospital's job. But as far as I know, none of the recipients have ever complained.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Maybe that's 'cause they're not around anymore. We followed up on several patients who received Silver Hills bone and tissue from your clinic and now seven of them are dead. Three from hepatitis, three from cancer, and one AIDS-related. The same thing ironically killed the donors.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: One of those victims was a 15-year-old healthy high school soccer player. You gave him a contaminated kneecap.</p>
<p><strong>Ty Miloni</strong>: Oh, my God. </p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – INTERVIEW ROOM 1]</p>
<p><strong>Salvatore Heinz</strong>: He came to me!</p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: You harvested diseased body parts and sold them under false pretenses.</p>
<p><strong>Salvatore Heinz</strong>: He told me what to do. He ... he said it was safe!</p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: But you didn't have to do it, did you, Mr. Heinz? You took money, and people died. Now, whether or not we got him -- we got you.</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – INTERVIEW ROOM 2]</p>
<p><strong>Ty Miloni</strong>: You've got nothing on me. I don't care what that .. little body snatcher tells you.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: The families are going to sue you and your company into bankruptcy.</p>
<p><strong>Ty Miloni</strong>: They can try. That is what signed release forms are for. </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You're reopening a very nasty, old wound for them, now.</p>
<p><strong>Ty Miloni</strong>: Uh-uh. I didn't do anything.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Because of you ... they're going to have to rebury their mother, their father, their son, their daughter.</p>
<p>(Ty scoffs.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Ty ... let me tell you something. I'm gonna come down to that clinic ... and I'm going to go through it piece by piece by piece. And if something doesn't jibe, I can assure you, sir, I will find it.</p>
<p><strong>Ty Miloni</strong>: Well, that is your job, isn't it?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yes, it is.</p>
<p><strong>Ty Miloni</strong>: And you'll have my full cooperation.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) – DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. CSI – HALLWAY – DAY]</p>
<p>(Sara reads a file and shares her findings with Warrick.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I did a little background on Jesse, the host. He was in and out of eleven different foster homes. Brass accessed his juvie records. He had multiple arrests for prostitution, and drug possession.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Kid had a hard life if he had to take it to the streets to make a buck.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We still need his DNA, and if he did kill Margo, he's not just gonna give it up.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What about the vomit that we found in the toilet at the crime scene?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What about it?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, the hosts drink a lot and throw up a lot. Busboy says he always finds blood in the toilets. If Jesse's a host, chances are he's throwing up blood, too.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – INTERVIEW ROOM – DAY]</p>
<p>(Sara interviews Jesse Hottman. She shows him the DNA results.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Jesse, we found your DNA in Margo Dorton's toilet. I thought that you said that you didn't see your relationships outside of the club.</p>
<p><strong>Jesse Hottman</strong>: Unless, of course, the relationship is ending.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh yeah, that's a cold word for it -- for murder.</p>
<p><strong>Jesse Hottman</strong>: I didn't kill her, all right? I ended the relationship and I bounced. Champagne got me sick.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No, I don't think it was the champagne, Jesse. I think it was Margo. She was coming to see you for a couple of months, spending a lot of money, you were running your pro-game, you know, doing the host thing. Holding her hand, touching, consoling her. Laying on the old Jesse magic. But then she laid some pretty heavy information on you.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Margot talks with Jesse.) </p>
<p><strong>Margot Dorton</strong>: I want you to come home with me.</p>
<p><strong>Jesse Hottman</strong>: So you want to end the relationship? </p>
<p>BACK TO SCENE.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I guess you thought, you know ... here's Margo, this cougar ... wants to take me back to the love pit, end the relationship. Sexy time. But it didn't turn out that way, did it?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Margot and Jesse are sitting on her couch. Jesse tries to kiss her. She pulls away.) </p>
<p><strong>Margot Dorton</strong>: Jesse, I ...</p>
<p>(He tries to kiss her again.) </p>
<p><strong>Jesse Hottman</strong>: Shh ...</p>
<p>(She pushes him away.) </p>
<p><strong>Margot Dorton</strong>: Jesse, no.</p>
<p>(She smiles at him.) </p>
<p><strong>Margot Dorton</strong>: Look, um ... I have something I need to show you. Okay? </p>
<p>(She stands up and gets the photo album. She shows him photos of her with the baby.) </p>
<p><strong>Margot Dorton</strong>: This is you. I'm your mother, Jesse. I've waited my entire life to tell you this. I love you. I'm sorry.</p>
<p>(He picks up the champagne bottle and beats her.) </p>
<p><strong>Margot Dorton</strong>: No!</p>
<p>(She falls to the couch.)</p>
<p>(CUT TO: Margot is dead on the floor, the photo album under her. Jesse looks around. He runs to the bathroom, puts the champagne bottle on the floor and throws up in the toilet.) </p>
<p>(He picks up the bottle and wipes it.) </p>
<p>BACK TO SCENE.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You look a little pale, Jesse. Are you getting this?</p>
<p><strong>Jesse Hottman</strong>: She lied to me. Said she hired some private investigator to find me. Said she'd been building up the nerve to tell me the truth. Said she had a lot to make up for. And that, uh ... I could have her car. And that I didn't have to work anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You thought those were lies?</p>
<p><strong>Jesse Hottman</strong>: (nods) Yeah, lies to get closer to me. All my clients have their tactics. But hers was ... insane.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: She wasn't lying to you, Jesse. You have 13 alleles in common. You killed your mother.</p>
<p><strong>Jesse Hottman</strong>: (upset) Then take me to jail. You know, call me a killer ... a murderer, whatever, but don't tell me I have a mother ... because I don't. I never did. And I never will.</p>

<p>[INT. CSI – KEPPLER'S OFFICE] </p>

<p>(He shakes himself and slips the program back into his folder. He gets up and leaves the office.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – HALLWAY OUTSIDE FORENSIC AUTOPSY] </p>
<p>(Keppler heads for autopsy. Nick walks out, his arms full of evidence bags from the Longevity Tissue Services.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: Need some help?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Aren't you off shift?</p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: Yeah. Are you?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah. Yeah, thanks. I'll be back in a minute.</p>
<p>(Nick leaves.) </p>
<p>[INT. CSI – FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(Keppler walks into Autopsy. There's a dark-haired woman on the table. When Keppler looks at her, he sees AMY McCARTY in her white nightgown.)</p>
<p>(We hold on Keppler.) </p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong>: (o.s.) (whisper) Keppler?</p>
<p>(Keppler turns around and looks behind him.) </p>

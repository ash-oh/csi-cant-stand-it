<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) – NIGHT]</p>
<p>[CU: TWO WOMEN KISS]</p>
<p>[EXT. HOTEL FRONT – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Miss Tangiers pushes Miss Palermo away.) </p>
<p><strong>Miss Tangiers</strong>: Okay, back that thing up. I wanted to steal some gloss off my lips.</p>
<p>(Miss Palermo giggles.) </p>
<p><strong>Miss Palermo</strong>: Yeah, and you bought it. Hey. You are hotter than anyone in there.</p>
<p>(Just then, a young woman and a man walk past.) </p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: For $1,000, I'll take you around the world. MAN: I think I love you.</p>
<p><strong>Miss Tangiers</strong>: God should just flush this city down the toilet. Look, hey ... I'm going to go find our limo. </p>
<p>(Miss Lucky Dragon sits on the side smoking.) </p>
<p><strong>Miss Tangiers</strong>: (disgusted) Where it's safe.</p>
<p>(Miss Tangiers puts her jacket on as she heads for the valet. In the distance, gunshots and tire screeching sounds. Miss Tangiers turns her back for a moment. An out-of–control limo turns the corner and heads straight for the lobby.)</p>
<p>(People scream and run to get out of the way. The limo rams through the front drive and stops when it hits a parked car.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. HOTEL FRONT – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Brass gets out of his car. OFFICER BAILEY HUSKINS is already there.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Huskins, you first responding?</p>
<p><strong>Bailey Huskins</strong>: Yes, sir. We got one dead guy in the limo; the rest are cuts and bruises.</p>
<p>(They duck under the crime scene tape on their way to the limo.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, what's the story?</p>
<p><strong>Bailey Huskins</strong>: Witnesses are pretty much in sync. They heard, uh, several gunshots from down the street, they saw the limo and everybody started hightailin' it.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (chuckles) Right. Running the Bulls, Las Vegas style. So, I got a feeling the driver didn't see anything.</p>
<p><strong>Bailey Huskins</strong>: No, sir.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Make sure you do Nystagmus before we pound him through the FSTs. Limo equals drugs and whatnot. And collect all the cell phones.</p>
<p><strong>Bailey Huskins</strong>: Are we authorized to do that, sir?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No. (loudly) Hey, anybody have any photos or video of the crash? If you do, I promise to get them on Channel 8 News.</p>
<p>(Suddenly, everyone in the crowd holds out their phone for him.) </p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong>: I do. VOICE: I do. VOICE: I do.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong>: I got it.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (to Huskins) You better wear gloves before you do the collection. There's a lot of interrupted lap dances out there.</p>
<p><strong>Bailey Huskins</strong>: Yes, sir. We got one on the guy in the limo. A passenger. Paramedics are working on him now. Name's Kellen Tyford.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, Kellen. I know Kellen. Calls himself &quot;Drops.&quot;</p>
<p>VARIOUS FLASHES OF THE BULLET HOLES IN THE LIMO GLASS</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(Greg is examining the back of the limo. He sees the blood on the seat and the dead body on the floor.) </p>
<p>(Grissom is looking over David Phillips' shoulder.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This is what happens when you don't wear your seatbelt.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: That's why I always do.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: It's the law. Even in limos.</p>
<p>(Greg notes the champagne bottle on the limo floor.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Found a wallet.</p>
<p>(He checks it.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Got a license. Vic's name is &quot;Champ Landley.&quot;</p>
<p>(The NEVADA DRIVER LICENSE reads:<br />
LIC # 1825588741<br />
EXPIRES: 10-04-2010<br />
SSN: 502-45-195 CLASS: C<br />
BIRTHDATE: 10-04-1978 s*x: M<br />
HEIGHT: 6'2&quot; WEIGHT: 195<br />
EYES: BRN HAIR: BRN</p>
<p>CHAMP LANDLEY<br />
332 CALLE MATRIA RD.<br />
LAS VEGAS, NV 89109</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Open champagne bottle. White powder residue. I'll guess coke.</p>
<p>(Grissom sees the blood spatter and other material on the limo seats.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, then that must be ... his brain on drugs.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Party till you drop.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Or get shot, whichever comes first.</p>
<p>SMASH TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) – MORNING] </p>
<p>[EXT. CASINO/MOTEL – FRONT DRIVE -- MORNING] </p>
<p>(Brass walks up to Drops who leans up against a parked car and is holding a cloth pressed to the back top of his head. He's also a mess, stained with a lot of blood.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Konnichiwa.</p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: Konnichiwa. Look. I ain't in the mood, man.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, let me guess--you don't have any blood on your hands. Oh, look at that, you do.</p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: Yeah, I got blood on my face, too. How about that?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, who's the dead guy?</p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: It's Champ.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, we know that, but who's he to you? Huh?</p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: It's family, man.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, he's your &quot;cuz&quot;, he's your gang buddy.</p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: Look, B, I ain't no Blud and I ain't no Crip. Champ's just a cool kid I knew from around the way. I met his ass over two decades ago riding my Big Wheel. We go back like your hairline. That's family.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, how did his B-L-U-D end up on your face?</p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: We was parlayin', chillin', slidin' to the strip club, mindin' our own.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: [INT. LIMO] Drops and Camps clink champagne glasses. A gunshot fires.) </p>
<p>(Quick CGI of: SLOW MOTION. The bullet bursts through the glass and hits Champs in the head. Champs goes down immediately against Drops.)</p>
<p>(End of CGI. End of Flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, what'd you do, piss off some rapper band again? </p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: The only bands I'm playin' with now is the one's I'm ripping off stacks of green. And I ain't talking about weed, B.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You're the big cheese maker. What's your secret, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: I promote events, parties. I help the club life pop.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, you must be throwing some pretty crappy parties for someone to want you and your buddy dead. Huh? So, tell me. Who lit you up?</p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: I don't know, okay? Could be everybody, man, could be nobody.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Okay. Let's start with everybody.</p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: I know a lot of people -- friends and foes. They know I come here late night. Or maybe, maybe the limo driver cut somebody off and we're the victims of road rage. How about that?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Look, we're going to take you down to the station.</p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: You can't be ser ... I'm the one that got shot at! </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know the rigamarole: we need an official statement, we need your clothes, we need your prints, we need your DNA. Because you're a concerned citizen. You want to help us find out who did this ... unless you already know.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. HOTEL/CASINO – FRONT ROAD – DAY]</p>
<p>(The officers and techs check the road for evidence and mark them as they find them.) </p>
<p><strong>CSI Tech #1</strong>: Got a nine mill over here.</p>
<p><strong>CSI Tech #2</strong>: .45 auto casing.</p>
<p>(Grissom and Hodges walk over to Greg, who has his kit open on the ground at his feet. Hodges is carrying a kit.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: This neighborhood rains lead.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, and we have to process every last drop of it.</p>
<p>(Greg is digging out a bullet from the stone wall.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (mutters) We're going to make Bobby Dawson's boat payment this month.</p>
<p>(Hodges takes his sunglasses off.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: I was right. This is a lot like garbage colleting.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: You're not helping, Hodges.</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: I have no intention to. Field rotation for the lab techs was Ecklie's idea. He was very explicit that I was only allowed to observe.</p>
<p>(Hodges turns his attention to observing the techs on the street.) </p>
<p>(Greg manages to get the bullet out of the stone wall.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Looks like a .38, maybe a .357.</p>
<p>(Hodges looks down at the street.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's a little small for those golf-ball size holes we found in that limo.</p>
<p>(Hodges finds something. He clears his throat loudly and motions for someone.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: A little help?</p>
<p>(Grissom gives Greg a look before they head toward Hodges to see what he wants. Hodges points to the road.) </p>
<p>(Grissom picks up the bullet casing.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: .50 caliber. Casing looks new. I bet it's from a Desert Eagle.</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Or a coffee shop. I could drink an espresso out of that thing.</p>
<p>(Grissom looks at Hodges.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS COMMUNITY (STOCK) – DAY]</p>
<p>[EXT. RESIDENCE – FRONT LAWN -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Sofia, Catherine and Warrick stand around a dead woman's body on a front lawn.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Residential area. Not much traffic. Landscaper found the body, called<br />
911. Driver's license is in her purse. Her name's Melissa Gentry, lives off Nellis. We're trying to contact the family.</p>
<p>(Sofia hands the wallet to Catherine. She takes out the NEVADA DRIVER LICENSE for:<br />
MELISSA GENTRY<br />
247 DUNPHY ROAD<br />
LAS VEGAS, NV 89109 )</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Little bit outside of her neighborhood, isn't it?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Definitely.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Party clothes shredded. Breaded abrasions. Must've hit the ground moving.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No car keys and no unaccounted for ... cars in the vicinity.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: You thinking she got jacked?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: She gets taken along for the ride, jumps out trying to escape.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: [NIGHT] The car drives by. The door opens and the body hits the ground rolling. End of flash.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Maybe she was killed first, and this is a body dump at high speed.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: I'm going to go bang on some doors, see if anyone heard anything.</p>
<p>(Sofia leaves Warrick and Catherine with the body.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'm gonna go see if I can figure out where this started.</p>
<p>(Warrick stands up and starts down the road. Catherine snaps photos of the body.) </p>
<p>(Warrick puts evidence marker #2 next to a shoe. Catherine snaps a photo of a particular deep mark on the body.)</p>
<p>(Warrick puts evidence marker #3 next to a blue piece of cloth. Catherine snaps more photos of the scrapes on the body.) </p>
<p>(Warrick finds a black broken part with a partial VIN number on it. He takes a photo and picks it up. Warrick looks around the area.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT -- INTERVIEW ROOM – DAY]</p>
<p>(The officer in the room opens the door for Nick. Drops is waiting inside.) </p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: Whoa! &quot;Crime Lab Nick Stokes!&quot; I see we're in between bad haircuts.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Drops. Told you I'd see you later. (He opens his kit.) It's called criminal activity. Stand up and hold your hands up for me, please.</p>
<p>(Drops stands up and holds out his hands, palms down. Drops smiles at Nick.) </p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: Now, come on, Crime Lab, I thought we was old buddies.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: The only thing we have in common, Kellen, are the dead bodies that seem to keep piling up around you. (He snaps a photo.) Turn around, please.</p>
<p>(Drops turns around.) </p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: Well, first of all ... I ain't never killed nobody in my life. Second, I don't have a record. (Nick snaps another photo.) Never even done a day in jail.</p>
<p>(Drops turns to face Nick.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, you keep heading down this road and, unfortunately, that's where you're going to end up.</p>
<p>(Drops looks at his bloodied clothes.) </p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: Yeah, well ... this, this ain't me. I'm not used to this. As a matter of fact, I don't even know what that is.</p>
<p>(He points to the item in Nick's hand.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: It's a test for gunshot residue. Hands up.</p>
<p>(Nick takes a sample.) </p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: Oh, yeah, uh ... the powder from a gun. You ain't gonna find none of that.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Maybe not. Okay, now, I need you to remove all of your clothing, including your shoes.</p>
<p>(Nick gives him some red clothes.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You can put these on for now and I'll come back to get them when you're done.</p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: No, thanks. Uh, I got one of my queens bringing me a suit. I will not be throwing on these nasty ass scrubs.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You are covered in blood. Your clothes are evidence now and I'm going to come back in here and I'm going to get them. If not, you're just going to be standing here in your underwear.</p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: What underwear? I don't wear drawers.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: This is not a compromise, Kellen.</p>
<p>(Nick grabs his kit and things off the table and heads for the door. He passes Officer Mitchell standing inside the room.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You might want to close your eyes or turn around or something.</p>
<p>(Nick leaves. Officer Mitchell crosses his arms. He's not budging. Drops glances at him, then turns his back to him.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – GARAGE – DAY]</p>
<p>(Greg motions as the limo is backed into the garage and parked.) </p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[INT. CSI – FORENSIC AUTOPSY]</p>
<p>(David Phillips hangs Champ Landley's bloodied jacket on a hanger and puts it next to his other clothes.) </p>
<p>(Greg examines the back of the limo carefully. He notes the blood and glass on the floor and he finds something flattened on the floor, half tucked under the carpeting.) </p>
<p>(David washes the blood off the body.) </p>
<p>(Greg gathers pieces of glass off the limo floor.)</p>
<p>(In the layout room, Nick puts the pieces of broken glass together.) </p>
<p>(In the limo, Greg picks up small pieces he finds.) </p>
<p>(Champs Landley is on the table with a rod in his head while Robbins reconstructs the skull pieces on a dummy head.) </p>
<p>(In the limo, Greg finds a rolled up bill with white powder residue. He leans forward and sees the white circular markings.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – GRISSOM'S OFFICE – DAY]</p>
<p>(Greg reports his findings to Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Fifty AE casings came back clean on IBIS, but Ballistics was able to pull type and caliber from the copper jacket fragments inside the limo. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Consistent with .50 caliber Desert Eagle handgun.</p>
<p>(Greg shows Grissom the diagram.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yeah. Blood on the seats suggests that the victim was sitting here, on the left, with Drops somewhere to the right.</p>
<p>(Grissom counts the bullet lines on the diagram.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Six shots into the limo. Autopsy reports cause of death was single gunshot wound to the head with variable trajectory, so one of those was the kill shot.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yeah, it's just hard to say which one. The crash tossed everything all over the place. And it's basically one big mess now.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sounds like Drops' story is holding up, though.</p>
<p>(Nick appears in the doorway. He motions to them.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Gentlemen. Follow me.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – LAYOUT ROOM – CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(Greg shows the reconstructed window findings to Greg and Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: There were two shots fired through the glass, but as you can see, different sizes, different calibers.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Big one's consistent with the .50.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, but check out the beveling on the impacts.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, based on the beveling, these shots were fired from opposite directions.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Tinting film is applied to the inside of a window, so the small-caliber round was fired from inside the limo.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, I analyzed the radial cracks from both holes. The cracks from the shot that was fired out was terminated by the cracks from the shot that was fired in.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI flash of: A gun fires. The bullet hits the glass and enters the limo. A second gun fires inside the limo. The second bullet hits the glass on its way out the limo. The cracks in the glass overlap each other. End of CGI flash.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Someone inside the limo had a gun.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And, evidently, Drops wasn't telling us the whole story after all.</p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[EXT. PRICY COMMUNITY (STOCK) – DAY]</p>
<p>[EXT. DROPS' HOME – POOLSIDE – DAY] </p>
<p>(Women in lacy underwear serve drinks. Brass talks with Drops.) </p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: Look, I didn't lie, all right? I just left a couple of things out.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, you want to fill in the blanks before I ship you for obstruction?</p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: We shot back; it's that simple.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We? You both had guns?</p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: Nah, man, just one of us.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, I bet I can guess which one. 'Cause you're the only person in the limo with a registered .38 revolver.</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You're telling me that you didn't shoot a gun from inside the limo? You're blaming it on a dead guy, a dead guy who just happens to have the same gun as you.</p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: What can I say, man? .38's back in style. Besides, man, Champ always had heat. Everybody know that. He got my back. </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know, I know everything about you, Kellen. You're just a small-time street thug and drug dealer from Northtown. You got the nickname &quot;Drops&quot; 'cause when you sold the chronic, you made a lot of drops.</p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: Wow, and here I was thinking that I got that name based off my boxing skills, seeing as how I used to drop fools in the squared circle.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I don't know, you're a little slow behind the jab. And all you do is a lot of bobbing and weaving. So get me the gun, and I'll let you have your massage.</p>

<p>(Sofia is standing at the drinking fountain dabbing at the wine stain on her blouse. The undersheriff turns the corner and walks up to her.) </p>
<p><strong>Jeff McKeen</strong>: I hear soda water works better.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: What'd work better is if I took it out and shot it.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff McKeen</strong>: So long as I don't see it on the 11:00 news.</p>
<p>(She chuckles.)</p>
<p><strong>Jeff McKeen</strong>: The James kid, he lawyered up?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Yeah. Yeah, his attorney's on his way. You holding a press conference?</p>
<p><strong>Jeff McKeen</strong>: Yeah, I'm on my way there now. How do I look?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Like fresh meat.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff McKeen</strong>: Oh. Hope I hold my temper as well as you. You've got a big future in this department. Send the dry cleaning bill to my office.</p>
<p>(He walks away. Sofia turns and watches him go.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. JAMES' RESIDENCE – BILLIARDS ROOM – DAY]</p>
<p>(Nick checks the cabinets. Sara walks in carrying some clothes and a pair of shoes.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I checked the mom's room and the guest rooms, no sign of any weapons, but ... I did find these in the laundry room. Look familiar?</p>
<p>(She holds up the pair of jeans. There's a button pattern on the back pocket that matches the pattern on the bloodied leather in the limo.) </p>
<p>(Quick flash to: Someone standing up and leaving the imprint on the limo seat. End of flash.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah. Any trace of blood?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Nothing obvious. They were just washed.</p>
<p>(She smells them.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: They smell like bleach.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Great. What about the, uh, the hoodie in that cell phone picture? It looked like Aaron was wearing one.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah, it's still wet. Aaron wears his clothes baggy. He probably keeps them out of the dryer so they won't shrink.</p>
<p>(She hands the hoodie to Nick, who feels around and finds something.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Looks like the little hood left us something.</p>
<p>(He holds up the piece he found.) </p>
<p>(Quick flash to: [LIMO] The bullet breaks through the glass and hits Champ Landley in the head. A piece of his skull flies out and lands on Aaron, who is sitting next to him. Aaron breathes in panic. End of flash.) </p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) – NIGHT]</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – INTERVIEW ROOM – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Sofia interviews Aaron with his attorney Duane McWane.) </p>
<p><strong>Duane McWane</strong>: You're right. My client is guilty of partying in Las Vegas. But with this de minimus amount, you wouldn't be able to hold him for possession.</p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[INT. OBSERVATION ROOM]</p>
<p>(Greg enters the observation room to watch the interview.) </p>
<p><strong>Duane McWane</strong>: (scoffs) Those jeans? Come on. You'd probably find that same pattern on at least a couple thousand asses in this town. There's nothing here that places my client in that limo at the time of the shooting.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: How about this?</p>
<p>(Sofia puts a photo of the bone fragment on the table.)</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: Nick places the piece of skull in the reconstruction that Robbins worked on. The piece fits perfectly.)</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: (V.O.) A piece of Champ Landley's skull in the hood of your sweater.</p>
<p>(End of flash.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: I'd say you were definitely there.</p>
<p>(Duane whispers to Aaron. When he finishes, he answers Sofia.) </p>
<p>(Greg watches in the next room.) </p>
<p><strong>Duane McWane</strong>: Look, scared kid makes a couple of mistakes. It's peer pressure, all right? It's a misdemeanor, at best. You want to put LVPD through PR hell for that?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: No. Not just that. Simone Molinez was dragged to death from your limo before the shoot-out.</p>
<p>(Sofia puts Simone's morgue photo on the table.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Aaron was in the car when she was being dragged. I'd say that makes him a prime suspect.</p>
<p><strong>Aaron James</strong>: No, no, no, hold it, hold it. I don't know this girl. Okay, she came up to Drops at the Gold Square.</p>
<p><strong>Duane McWane</strong>: Aaron, don't say ...</p>
<p><strong>Aaron James</strong>: No, hold up, man. I didn't kill anybody.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: What's a guy like Drops doing at a dump like the Gold Square?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron James</strong>: Drops grew up in that 'hood. Guess he, uh ... wanted to claim his old territory.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: [GOLD SQUARE – NIGHT] Drops, Champ and Aaron walk into the bar.) </p>
<p><strong>Aaron James</strong>: (V.O.) We own that place. Picking up a girl in there was like stealing. </p>
<p>(Carey Corville and Scott Brittington leave a table. Drops and Aaron sit down at the table.) </p>
<p><strong>Aaron James</strong>: (V.O.) Drops trying to open up his own club. Asked me to invest. Before I got my money, guy like Drops wouldn't have &quot;What up?&quot; to me, let alone ask me out to talk business. </p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Aaron James</strong>: I felt like a big shot. What's the big deal?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: We think it's that big shot attitude that's exactly what got you shot.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Simone leaves Corville at the bar and sits with Drops at the table. Scotty and Corville don't like it. End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Taking that girl out of the Gold Square, you pissed off a couple of locals.</p>
<p>(Greg continues to watch the interview.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Everyone knows Drops ends his nights at the strip club. They were waiting for you.</p>
<p><strong>Aaron James</strong>: Look, I had nothing to do with that. And I definitely didn't kick her out of that limo.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: So who did then?</p>
<p><strong>Duane McWane</strong>: (interrupts) Aaron, unless you want to go to jail, son, don't say another word.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – HALLWAY – DAY]</p>
<p>(Sara and Greg walk through the hallway.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You observed the interview? If the undersheriff had seen you, he would've gone ballistic.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, I'm still off the case. Besides, I just happened to be listening, and I heard Aaron say that he didn't kick the girl out of the limo.</p>
<p>(Sara looks at Greg.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You want me to check the body?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, bruises get more distinguished as a body decomposes, so just see if there's anything we missed.</p>
<p>(As they talk, they don't notice the commotion going on at reception.) </p>
<p><strong>Marla James</strong>: (b.g.) That's the one I want to talk to.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (to Greg) I'm on it.</p>
<p><strong>Marla James</strong>: (b.g.) That's the one I'm looking for.</p>
<p>(Marla James steps into the hallway.) </p>
<p><strong>Judy Tremont (receptionist)</strong>: Miss, excuse me. You're not allowed back there!</p>
<p>(She heads over toward Greg.) </p>
<p><strong>Marla James</strong>: Taking one of my boys wasn't good enough for you, was it? Now you've got to take both? What did we ever do to you?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Mrs. James, I don't have anything against you or your family.</p>
<p><strong>Marla James</strong>: Then what is it? Is it about the money? Then take it! I just want my boy back!</p>
<p>(An officer runs into the hallway.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Mrs. James, you need to calm down ...</p>
<p><strong>Marla James</strong>: I'm not talking to you!</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, you're going to get yourself into trouble here.</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Ma'am ... you're going to have to leave.</p>
<p><strong>Marla James</strong>: (scoffs) Protecting the nice white boy from the mean black lady.<br />
(The officer leads her back out to reception.) You've got to help me. You owe me. You owe me!</p>
<p>(The officer escorts Marla James back to reception.) </p>
<p>(Greg turns the hallway and follows her.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: What do I owe you?</p>
<p><strong>Marla James</strong>: Yeah, like you don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I'll tell you what I know: I know that Demitrius was a killer. And Aaron -- Aaron made the decision to hang out with Drops. He made the decision to do drugs, and to bring that girl into the limo. That's not on me. It's on him, and you.</p>
<p>(She turns and looks at Greg.) </p>
<p><strong>Marla James</strong>: Aaron is all I have left.</p>
<p>(Marla turns and leaves.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – FORENSIC AUTOPSY – DAY]</p>
<p>(Sara is with the assistant coroner as she checks Simone Molinez's body. The assistant coroner turns over her body while Sara checks her back. They switch sides and check the other side of the body.)</p>
<p>(Sara finds a shoeprint on her back. She takes a photo of it.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – INTERVIEW ROOM – DAY]</p>
<p>(Brass interviews Drops with his lawyer, Brad Lewis.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: This bruise on Simone Molinez's body matches the heel of your buddy Champ's dress shoe.</p>
<p>(Drops and his lawyer confer.) </p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: Man, forensics be jammin' a brother up.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No doubt. And you saw him do it.</p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: Look, he was just trying to show a potential investor a good time, that's all. The boy got a short fuse.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: [INT. LIMO] Simone sits next to Aaron in the back of the limo.) </p>
<p><strong>Aaron James</strong>: All right. Whatever.</p>
<p><strong>Champ Landley</strong>: Why don't you really hook up my man?</p>
<p><strong>Simone Molinez</strong>: Hey! </p>
<p>(Champ smiles at Drops. Drops hides his laugh.) </p>
<p><strong>Aaron James</strong>: Champ, come on, man. What's wrong with you, man? She's a lady.</p>
<p><strong>Simone Molinez</strong>: Let me out the car!</p>
<p><strong>Champ Landley</strong>: Oh, you want out?</p>
<p>(He opens the door.) </p>
<p><strong>Champ Landley</strong>: Get out.</p>
<p><strong>Simone Molinez</strong>: Tell the driver to stop.</p>
<p><strong>Champ Landley</strong>: We're in a hurry! You want out, you get out now!</p>
<p><strong>Simone Molinez</strong>: No!</p>
<p>(He kicks her out of the car.) </p>
<p><strong>Aaron James</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, what, he pushed her out of the car because she wouldn't have s*x with Aaron?</p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: Champ thought it was a bad look.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Bad? Bad for what?</p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: Champ gets a bonus when business is good.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You got booze, bling, girls, guns and drugs in a limo. Would you call that doing legitimate business?</p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: Yeah. So, um ... what's a few scrapes and bruises on this girl got to do with me?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, a few scrapes and bruises, a broken wrist dislocated shoulder, broken neck -- add it up: it equals death.</p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: Death? Wait a minute, no way. See, first of all, that limo was turtle stepping' it down the block. It's like fallin' off a bike.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, maybe so, if she wasn't tangled up in the seat belt. What, you didn't hear her dragging on the street?</p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: (shakes his head) The speakers were on blast. I couldn't even hear my cell phone and that was on vibrate.</p>
<p><strong>Brad Lewis</strong>: My client has corroborated your evidence. Are we free to go?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What? No! I'm charging you with the murder of Scott Brittington.</p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: Scott ... Who?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The guy you shot.</p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: Okay, we already went over that. Champ was the shooter.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, so you say. But you're the only one in the limo with a registered .38. And you didn't toss that gun after you used it; you gave it to Aaron.</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: [INT. LIMO] Champs is dead and leaning on Aaron.) </p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: Trust me, son, you don't want to be here when the cops come, okay? Here, take the ratchet, and make it disappear. </p>
<p>(He hands the gun to Aaron.) </p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: Take the ratchet! Don't worry about it; I got you covered.</p>
<p>(The car door opens and Aaron leaves with the gun.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (V.O.) Aaron leaves the scene with your murder weapon. Your gun. </p>
<p>(Drops sits in Aaron's seat.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (V.O.) And you take his spot like he was never there.</p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Brad Lewis</strong>: Captain Brass, I've seen the ballistics report. The shots fired from inside the limo were fired second. That's textbook self-defense.</p>
<p>(Brass looks at Drops. Suddenly, Drops smiles.) </p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: &quot;Textbook self-defense.&quot; Told you, forensics be jammin' a brother up.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'll take my chances with the jury. I'm going to see your arms behind your back sooner than you think. Counselor.</p>
<p>(Brass stands up and leaves. Drops doesn't look worried at all.) </p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: And all this time I thought I was paying you too much. Give me some.</p>
<p>(They knock fists.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) – DAY] </p>
<p>[INT. CSI – LOCKER ROOM – DAY]</p>
<p>(Greg is at his locker. Grissom appears in the doorway.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The DA tells me you requested he go easy on Aaron James.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He's getting a suspended sentence. Released on his own recognizance.</p>
<p>(Greg nods.) </p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – HALLWAY /WAITING ROOM – DAY]</p>
<p>(Aaron James walks through the hallway. Drops walks out and meets him. He smiles and holds out his hand to Aaron. Aaron doesn't smile and doesn't shake his hand. He pats Drops on the shoulder and continues down the hallway toward his mom.)</p>
<p>(Marla James stands up from her hallway chair. Aaron walks over to her.) </p>
<p>[INT. CSI – LOCKER ROOM – DAY]</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: If the kid's brother hadn't died, would you have done the same?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (shrugs) I don't know. I just, uh ... you think it's wrong?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Doesn't matter what I think.</p>
<p>(Grissom looks at Greg, then leaves.) </p>
<p>(We hold on Greg.) </p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>

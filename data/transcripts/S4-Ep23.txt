Linley Parker:  Help me! Please somebody help me!

Linley Parker:  Somebody help me!

 
 
Voice Of EMT:  Victim's stable. We're transporting her to Desert Palms. Over.


Brass: Nobody knows who she is. The Andersons, they called the Security Company.  They thought somebody was trying to break in their back door. Southern Highlands is a new development. There's really not much around here. Some of my guys are talking to everybody, trying to find out what's going on.
Grissom: She has severe lacerations on her feet. She was running hard from somewhere.









(GRISSOM looks inside the front seat and finds an open wallet, driver's license and a couple of twenty dollar bills hanging out of the pocket. He notes the license for :
PARKER, LINLEY

FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS



 
 
Nick:  No skid marks, no signs of another vehicle.
Grissom: The engine's running, no flat tires. Why'd she stop?

 
 




Sara: I'm going to take the SAE kit to Greg.
Catherine: You don't want to take the statement?
Sara: Do you mind?
Catherine: No.

Nurse: She's ready.
Sara: Thanks. 

Catherine: Linley Parker, I'm Catherine Willows. I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab. I know that you've been through a horrific ordeal.
Linley Parker: 4-4-6. That's all I got. Nevada plates. Some kind of SUV. Black, I think.
Catherine: Can you start from the beginning?
Linley Parker: I was, um, driving home from work.



Linley Parker:  There's hardly any traffic once you cross horizon ranch. He was tailgating.

Linley Parker:  I slowed down to let him pass ...

Linley Parker: ... and he hit me.


Linley Parker:  I wasn't going to stop, but he did, so I ... 

Linley Parker: ... pulled over. You're not supposed to leave the scene of an accident. He looked like a normal guy. He asked if I was okay. Apologized. He went to his car to get his insurance information. I was looking at my bumper.


Linley Parker:  He punched me in the face, threw me over his shoulder.

Linley Parker:  I lost my shoes.

Linley Parker:  He threw me on the ground, took off my jacket, ripped open my shirt.

Linley Parker: He kept trying to kiss me on the mouth, and I kept turning away. So he bit my ear.



Linley Parker: He wanted me to look at him. He was going to kill me.


Linley Parker:  He ripped off my skirt. He raped me.

Linley Parker: He didn't use a condom. He got up to zip, and I kicked him in the groin and I ran. And the rest, I guess you know.
Catherine: Thank you. That was very specific. You said that you looked at him. Could you describe him to a forensic artist?
Linley Parker: Yes.



 
 
Forensic Artist : What do you remember most about the face?
Linley Parker: He had bright eyes.
Forensic Artist : What about the shape of the eyes?
Linley Parker: Almond. Tiny pupils.
Forensic Artist : What about the rest of the face?
Linley Parker: He had a baby face. High forehead, thin lips, clean-shaven.

: Like a crewcut?
 LINLEY PARKER: No, like he had a regular haircut.


Sara: What?
Grissom: How many vacation days do you have on the books?
Sara: About ...  ... ten weeks, I guess. Why?
Grissom: I think you should take a week or two.
Sara: I-I'm still on the case. I just didn't do the interview for once in my life.

Sara: When was the last time you took vacation?  Never, right?
Grissom: Okay.


 
 





Greg: Grissom, I have some information that will be of use to you. But, before you get it, I need a decision.
Grissom: What?
Greg: I'm tired of being on the fence here. Either I'm in the lab or I'm in the field. Which is it?
Grissom: Well, as soon as you can find and train a replacement, you can be in the field. Until then, I need you in the lab. Now give.
Greg: I got a CODIS hit off the semen from your victim. DNA matches a rape-murder case from a year ago.
Grissom: Still open?
Greg: Warrick's pulling the file.

Grissom: Thanks.
Greg: No, thank you.



 
 
Warrick: Victim was a 32-year-old Caucasian female, Emma Dobbins. Sexually assaulted.  Cause of death, strangulation. They used her pantyhose.
Grissom: Where'd they find the body?
Warrick: Off of Blue Diamond Road, Southern Highlands. 
Grissom: That's not far from where Linley Parker was assaulted.
Warrick: Other than the semen, the only evidence at the scene was a shoe print-- man's size nine. I talked to Nick. They also found a print-- size nine.
Grissom: Did she have a car?
Warrick: A Vintage Pontiac. Registered in her name, never recovered.
Grissom: So apart from geography and age, what else did they have in common?
Warrick: Emma Dobbins ran a movie memorabilia place downtown.
Grissom: My vic was a pit boss at the Palms.
Warrick:  Emma was married.
Grissom: Linley Parker was single. Blonde.
Warrick: She was brunette. The only thing in common: the guy who raped them.

 
 
Linley Parker: There's something wrong with the nose.

Forensic Artist : Which one looks right.

Linley Parker: That one.
Forensic Artist :  This one?
Linley Parker: Yeah.

Forensic Artist : Now, close your eyes, and tell me everything up until the time he raped you.



Voice: I'm so sorry


Attacker:  Look at me.

Attacker: Yeah, look at me.


Forensic Artist : Open your eyes.



 
 
Woman :  My husband keeps dropping hints about my anniversary present. Says he hopes I like calypso music. I think it's a cruise.
Todd Coombs: You don't like cruises?
Woman : I feel guilty.
Todd Coombs: Because you don't love him anymore, or because you think he can't handle knowing?
Crystal Coombs:  Sir!

Brass: Dr. Todd Coombs.
Todd Coombs: Excuse me, I'm with a patient.
Crystal Coombs: Honey, I told him to wait ... 
Todd Coombs: Crystal, what's going on here?

Brass: Las Vegas police. Sir, we need to talk.
 
(Through the camera shutter, CATHERINE sees that the vehicle's NEVADA plates are
446-RMV.)

Todd Coombs: This is insane -- you've got the wrong guy.
Brass: Well, if that's true, you got nothing to worry about.
Crystal Coombs: I-I'm going with him.
Brass: No, you're not. This is where he'll be.

Todd Coombs: I'm gonna need a lawyer.
Crystal Coombs: Who do I call?
Todd Coombs: I don't know, call Roger -- he'll know what to do.
Crystal Coombs: Roger?

Brass: The victim said the car was black.
Catherine: Well, blue looks black at night.



 
 
Man:  Single file, stop at your number on the floor. When I tell you to turn, you're gonna face the mirror. When you hear your number called, step forward.

Man:  Number one, step forward.

Man:  Step back.

Man:  Number two, step forward.

Man:  Step back.

Man:  Number three, step forward.

Linley Parker: It's number three. 

Linley Parker: That's the guy who raped me.
FADE OUT



 
 
Officer: He's been like that since the lineup. You know, the guilty ones always fall asleep.

Grissom: Dr. Coombs, my name's Gil Grissom. I'm with the crime lab. I'm here to collect a DNA sample, so if you'd open your mouth?
Todd Coombs: DNA? I-I think I should talk to my lawyer.
Grissom: Well, we have a warrant, so we can compel a sample. Either way I'm gonna get it.
Todd Coombs: I haven't done anything.
Grissom: The good news: If you're innocent, this'll prove it. 

Grissom: Thank you.


 
 










Nick: I compared the eight pairs of shoes we collected at Todd Coombs' house to the shoe print at the crime scene.
Catherine: Mm-hmm.
Nick: No matches.
Catherine: Well, he could've ditched the shoes anywhere.
Nick: Yeah, true. 

Catherine: So, uh, what do you got, Greg?
Greg: Well, according to the DNA results, Todd Coombs is not your rapist.
Catherine: You're kidding.
Greg: There's only seven out of thirteen, which means we're looking for a sibling. 
Grissom: I believe the semen would indicate a brother.
Nick: Could explain why she picked Todd out of a lineup -- strong family resemblance.
Catherine: She was so sure.

 
 
Brass: Dr. Coombs. You're free to go.
Todd Coombs: So that's it?
Brass: Yeah.
Crystal Coombs: You people think you can do whatever you want -- come into our homes, turn our lives upside down. Who's gonna explain this to our neighbors, our friends?

Todd Coombs: Come on, honey, let's get out of here.




Linley Parker: You're letting him go? Why?
Catherine: He's not the man that assaulted you.
Linley Parker: Yes, he is. I identified him.
Catherine: DNA ruled him out.
Linley Parker: Then you made a mistake. That man raped me.
Catherine: We have some additional leads, and we're working on them. I promise to keep you informed.
Linley Parker: I saw him. He wanted me to see his face.
Catherine: Linley, it was dark. You were under attack. Under those conditions ...

Catherine:  ... pupils dilate, it's hard to focus.
Voice: Look at me --

Catherine: You can't always trust your eyes. 
Linley Parker: He wanted me to see his face because he was going to kill me, and now you're letting him go?
Catherine: This is my cell phone number. Call me if you need anything.
Linley Parker: This isn't gonna keep him away from me. What I need is protection. I need a gun.
Catherine: If you don't feel safe in your home, stay with a friend.


 
 
Sara: I hear you're looking for Todd Coombs' brother.
Grissom: Or brothers.
Sara: I'll work out the family tree.

Larry Coombs: Yeah, I read all about it in the paper. I'm just sorry our parents weren't alive to see it.
Brass: Hey, your brother's being hauled in on a rape charge. Does that seem funny to you?
Larry Coombs: A little. Todd was due.
Warrick: Due for what?
Larry Coombs: A reality check. Most people go through life, suffer the ups and downs. Todd only got the ups till now.

Roger Coombs: I'm Roger Coombs. What's going on here?
Larry Coombs: They're cops -- they want our DNA. 
I'm gonna need the May Hustler and a cup.

Grissom: Hey.
Catherine: There's no new damage except for the window.

Catherine: Blood is probably from whoever broke the glass, not the victim.

Brass: Okay, the pawn shop owner ID'd her, she was looking to buy a gun, and she wasn't in the mood to wait.
Catherine: Anybody see what happened here?
Brass: Well, the problem is that when the light show starts, everyone's looking up. I mean, what's the chance that this crime is unrelated to the first attack?
Catherine: It's the same guy. He's getting rid of the witness.
Brass: Who identified the wrong man.
Grissom: Soon as the DNA comes back, we'll know which brother it is.
Catherine: And until then we wait?
Brass: Well, I got every police officer downtown looking for her.
Catherine: Yeah, you should have had eyes on the brothers.
Brass: Yeah, in a perfect world, yeah.
Grissom: Didn't you say that you were on the phone with her and you heard the window break?
Catherine: Yes.
Grissom: Did you find her phone?
Catherine: I looked everywhere.

Catherine: So where's her phone?




Dispatch:  The is dispatch. We have 20's confirmed on Roger Coombs. Monaco Casino, last four hours.
[INT. COOMBS BROTHERS CARS -- NIGHT

Dispatch:  Suspect Larry Coombs at his place of employment.
[EXT. SEVEN HILLS -- STREET -- NIGHT

Dispatch:  And Bailey Coombs, on shift, seven hills.


Crystal Coombs: All right, fine, fine. Search the whole house if you want to. I'm telling you, Todd's not here.
Brass: His car was in the driveway.
Crystal Coombs: That's because he took my car to the house company. You going to arrest him for that, too?
Brass: I'm going to need your license number and a full description of your vehicle.


Nick:  How'd you guys know Linley Parker's cell was e-911 capable?
Catherine: We just took a shot. She's got a lot of new gadgets in her car, most new cell phones are imbedded with a GPS chip.



Nick: Her carrier accepted the Attorney General waiver. I'm accessing her site now. If her phone's on, it should show up.
Catherine: Okay.

Nick: Okay, got it. Nearest cross streets, uh, Warm Springs and Durango.
Catherine: That's the middle of nowhere. 
Nick: Hey, Catherine. She's moving.

Catherine: We got a location!


Brass: Put out a BOLO on a beige, 2004 Ford Taurus. Registration, Nevada, 3-9-
6-R-G-F. The driver's name is Todd Coombs. He's a white male, 38 years old. I'm on my way to the house company in Green Valley.



 
 
Brass: You make a mess?
Todd Coombs: That's your job. Unless you've got a warrant, you can't even touch this car.
Brass: I'm just looking.
Todd Coombs: For what?

Brass: So how was Wal-Mart?
Todd Coombs: I was at the house company buying some plants for my wife, to cheer her up.
Brass: Oh, you think that's going to work?
Todd Coombs: A gesture goes a long way.
Brass: Never worked for me. Hey, do you mind turning that thing off?
Todd Coombs: When the quarters run out.
Brass: So when were you at the store?
Todd Coombs: Why don't you ask my brothers? I've got a cousin in Phoenix, maybe he knows.

Todd Coombs: Last time I cooperated with you guys, you put me in a lineup and I spent the night in jail.

Brass: That's right, that's right. Hey, let me tell you something. Twelve hours after Linley Parker ID'd you as her rapist, she gets dragged out of her car on Fremont Street. Now she's missing.
Todd Coombs: Then why are you wasting time talking to me?
(TODD COOMBS gets in his car and drives off.

Sara: Checked with county records. Crime scenes on a 20-acre plot. Guess who owns the property.
Det. Vartann: One of the Coombs Brothers.
Sara: Coombs Brother's company. Guy's an artist.
Det. Vartann: You call that art?
Sara: Black SUV.

Kevin Coombs: You're on my property!

Det. Vartann: Put the weapon down.
Kevin Coombs: You're on my property!
Det. Vartann: Las Vegas Police, drop it or we shoot.

Det. Vartann: Turn around.
Sara: Are you Kevin Coombs?
Det. Vartann: I can see the family resemblance. Come on.


 
 
Robbins: 'Cause of death, asphyxia due to strangulation. Victim has a hairline fracture of the right third metacarpal with some soft tissue swelling.

Grissom: Defensive wounds.
Robbins: She was a fighter. There's also fresh contusions of the right labia.
Grissom:  She was raped again?
Robbins: I did a wet mount of the vaginal secretion with a Christmas Tree stain. Slide's under the scope.



Grissom: Sperm.
Robbins: If he was trying to silence a witness, why not just kill her, why rape her again?
Grissom: Maybe rape was just foreplay for this guy. Maybe what he really gets off on is killing.

 
 
Det. Vartann: What do you got?
Sara: Maybe a missing Pontiac Tempest.




Det. Vartann: So, you were home last night? 

Det. Vartann: Okay, well, doesn't really matter. Your DNA will do the talking.
Kevin Coombs: You know what happens when the government gets your DNA?
Det. Vartann: Enlighten me.
Kevin Coombs:  They put it in the database. Then they look at your driver's license picture and then all those cameras -- traffic lights, parking lots, grocery stores ... they can find you. Whenever they want.

 
 
Grissom: Dr. Coombs.
Todd Coombs: Mr. Grissom. I suppose you're compelling a DNA sample from my brother now.
Grissom: We are. Why are you here?
Todd Coombs: Are you an only child?
Grissom: I am. Why?
Todd Coombs: You've got my brother in that room, he's family. I didn't want him to be alone.
Grissom: Well, what about your other brothers?
Todd Coombs: Bailey only looks out for number one. Roger and Larry, they do their best to avoid Kevin. They don't understand him.
Grissom: And you do?
Todd Coombs: He's harmless. He chooses to live alone. He lives off the grid. He spends all his time turning junk into art.
Grissom: Where does he get his &quot;junk&quot;?
Todd Coombs: Mostly from my brother's garage. Every once in a while, Roger lets Kevin take his pick of the wrecks. Beats inviting him over for Thanksgiving, you know?
Grissom: Dr. Coombs, we found a 1968 Pontiac outside your brother's house. The VIN matched a car belonging to a victim who was raped and murdered by the same person who raped Linley Parker. And we found Linley Parker's dead body on your Brother's property.
Todd Coombs:  You guys have been wrong before.

 
 


Warrick: Whew, man. Guys like Brass have it easy. All they got to do is call it in.
Nick: Hey, check this out. I just found it in the hose. It's from a potted plant purchased at the house company. Confirms Todd Coombs' alibi.

Warrick: You saw this? A pin from the Palms. Linley Parker worked at the Palms.

Nick: A lot of people work at the Palms. And it doesn't nail Todd Coombs.

 
 
Grissom: According to the DNA, the blood from Linley Parker's smashed window matches the semen from all the rapes.
Catherine: Which means it doesn't match Todd Coombs.
Grissom: Or Kevin Coombs. Or any of the rest of the brothers Grimm.

Catherine: Linley was absolutely certain that Todd Coombs raped her.
Grissom: That's not what the evidence says.
Catherine: Well, maybe the evidence is wrong.
Grissom: You can be wrong, I can be wrong, the evidence is just the evidence.
Catherine: Deep down, tell me you don't think this guy is good for this.

Greg: I got the DNA on the hair you lifted off Linley Parker's body. Get this. It's Todd Coombs.
Catherine: Puts him with the body.
Grissom: It doesn't prove rape.
Catherine: I'll have Brass bring him in.


 
 
Grissom: Would you strip down to your shorts, please, doctor?
Todd Coombs: Why?
Grissom: I'm going to examine your clothing for any trace evidence, and we're going to document your body for any injuries that may have been sustained during a recent struggle.
Todd Coombs: I don't have any injuries.
Grissom: If you'd like, this officer will assist you.

Todd Coombs: I did not rape that woman. I did not kill her. You guys proved that and you let me go.


Todd Coombs: That's from moving boxes.
Grissom: Thank you. Turn around, please.

Todd Coombs: That's an old scar. I was a bone marrow donor. My youngest brother Joss had leukemia.
Grissom: Hold still please.


Grissom: Turn off the lights, would you, please, officer?

Todd Coombs: What are you looking at? 


 
 
(It reads:
Mosaicism causes Blaschko's lines ...
Patterns are caused by Chimericism ... 
(He continues to read:
Fraternal twins  collapsing ... 

Tissues from two different embryos can fuse into one.

Chimera
Human Genetics: Dual Identities




 
 
Todd Coombs: This is harassment. I've already given you guys a DNA sample.
Grissom: You know that bone marrow donation you gave your brother?  I checked your medical records. His body rejected it and he died. My guess is that's when you first found out about your unique condition.

Todd Coombs: The doctors explained it. I'm a creature of myth. 
Grissom: A chimera. Head of a lion, body of a goat, tail of a dragon. You're a genetic anomaly. One person, two completely different sets of DNA.


 
 
Brass: State your name for the record.
Todd Coombs: My name is Todd Coombs. I raped and murdered Emma Dobbins and Linley Parker. There are more, but we'll talk about those later.
Brass: How'd you pick your victims?
Todd Coombs: They picked me.

Grissom: Sometimes fraternal twins, two separately fertilized eggs, develop into only one person.

Grissom:  In effect, one twin dies in embryo, but its DNA survives in the other.

Grissom: That's why the DNA from his buccal swab matched his hair but not his semen.
Catherine: So he had two strains of DNA in his body.
Grissom: Yeah, and the DNA in his semen, was evidently from his dead twin brother.
Brass: You never met Emma Dobbins or Linley Parker. 
Todd Coombs: I didn't have to meet 'em. You go to a bar, you see an attractive woman, make your move, she shoots you down. You go home, you m*st*rb*t*. You get on with it. But when I see a woman who arouses me ... the whole world disappears ... except for her. She can't say no.

 
Warrick:  What a night. You guys hungry? Want to get something to eat?

 
Sara: No, I think I'm going to call it a night.
Nick: Yeah, me, too.
Warrick: I feel ya. Get some rest.

Nick: All right, I'll see you.

Sara: Hey, hey, Nick, congratulations on your almost promotion. Seriously, you deserve it.
Nick:  Wow. That's really hard for you, isn't it?

Sara: Yeah, it is.


 
 
Grissom:  

Grissom: Is she all right?
 

Officer:  she was lucky she wasn't on the strip. That's highway patrol's jurisdiction. 

Officer:  She blew .09.


 
 
Officer: Technically, she's over, but they just lowered the limit, so we cut her a break and didn't book her. But we did have to call the supervisor.

Grissom: Well, thank you. I appreciate the courtesy.
Officer: No problem.


Grissom: Come on. I'll take you home.

FADE TO BLACK

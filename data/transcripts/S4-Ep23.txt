<p>(GRISSOM finishes taking pictures and puts the camera down as BRASS makes his way toward him.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Nobody knows who she is. The Andersons, they called the Security Company. (He indicates the couple talking with the officer.) They thought somebody was trying to break in their back door. Southern Highlands is a new development. There's really not much around here. Some of my guys are talking to everybody, trying to find out what's going on.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: She has severe lacerations on her feet. She was running hard from somewhere.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Do you mind?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No.</p>
<p>(The NURSE steps out from behind the curtain and gives the box to SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Nurse</strong>: She's ready.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Thanks. </p>
<p>(SARA takes the box and leaves. CATHERINE follows the NURSE back to LINLEY who is sitting on the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Linley Parker, I'm Catherine Willows. I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab. I know that you've been through a horrific ordeal.</p>

<p><strong>Linley Parker</strong>: (V.O.) I wasn't going to stop, but he did, so I ... </p>
<p>[DESERT PALMS HOSPITAL]</p>
<p><strong>Linley Parker</strong>: ... pulled over. You're not supposed to leave the scene of an accident. He looked like a normal guy. He asked if I was okay. Apologized. He went to his car to get his insurance information. I was looking at my bumper.</p>
<p>[CRIME SCENE]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and NICK look in the bushes.)</p>

<p><strong>Linley Parker</strong>: He didn't use a condom. He got up to zip, and I kicked him in the groin and I ran. And the rest, I guess you know.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Thank you. That was very specific. You said that you looked at him. Could you describe him to a forensic artist?</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How many vacation days do you have on the books?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: About ... (She turns to look at him.) ... ten weeks, I guess. Why?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I think you should take a week or two.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I-I'm still on the case. I just didn't do the interview for once in my life.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I'm tired of being on the fence here. Either I'm in the lab or I'm in the field. Which is it?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, as soon as you can find and train a replacement, you can be in the field. Until then, I need you in the lab. Now give.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I got a CODIS hit off the semen from your victim. DNA matches a rape-murder case from a year ago.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Still open?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Warrick's pulling the file.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM winks, turns and walks away.)</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's not far from where Linley Parker was assaulted.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Other than the semen, the only evidence at the scene was a shoe print-- man's size nine. I talked to Nick. They also found a print-- size nine.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did she have a car?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: A Vintage Pontiac. Registered in her name, never recovered.</p>

<p>(LINLEY screams.)</p>
<p><strong>Attacker</strong>: Yeah, look at me.</p>
<p>[INT. CSI]</p>

<p><strong>Woman (patient)</strong>: (o.s.) My husband keeps dropping hints about my anniversary present. Says he hopes I like calypso music. I think it's a cruise.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Coombs</strong>: You don't like cruises?</p>
<p><strong>Woman (patient)</strong>: I feel guilty.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Coombs</strong>: Because you don't love him anymore, or because you think he can't handle knowing?</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, if that's true, you got nothing to worry about.</p>
<p><strong>Crystal Coombs</strong>: I-I'm going with him.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No, you're not. This is where he'll be.</p>

<p><strong>Kevin Coombs</strong>: (neurotic) They put it in the database. Then they look at your driver's license picture and then all those cameras -- traffic lights, parking lots, grocery stores ... they can find you. Whenever they want.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(GRISSOM steps out and finds TODD COOMBS sitting the hallway. He stops to talk with him.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Dr. Coombs.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Coombs</strong>: Mr. Grissom. I suppose you're compelling a DNA sample from my brother now.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We are. Why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>Todd Coombs</strong>: Are you an only child?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I am. Why?</p>
<p><strong>Todd Coombs</strong>: You've got my brother in that room, he's family. I didn't want him to be alone.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, what about your other brothers?</p>
<p><strong>Todd Coombs</strong>: Bailey only looks out for number one. Roger and Larry, they do their best to avoid Kevin. They don't understand him.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And you do?</p>
<p><strong>Todd Coombs</strong>: He's harmless. He chooses to live alone. He lives off the grid. He spends all his time turning junk into art.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Where does he get his &quot;junk&quot;?</p>
<p><strong>Todd Coombs</strong>: Mostly from my brother's garage. Every once in a while, Roger lets Kevin take his pick of the wrecks. Beats inviting him over for Thanksgiving, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Dr. Coombs, we found a 1968 Pontiac outside your brother's house. The VIN matched a car belonging to a victim who was raped and murdered by the same person who raped Linley Parker. And we found Linley Parker's dead body on your Brother's property.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Coombs</strong>: (scoffs) You guys have been wrong before.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI -- LAB] </p>
<p>(Maskless NICK goes through the contents of the vacuum bin. He separates them by HAIRS, METAL, ORGANICS, and PAPER.) </p>
<p>(Abandoning that for a moment, NICK looks around and sees the tubing. He pulls off the nozzle and looks into the long tube. He sees something stuck. He reaches in and pulls it out.)</p>
<p>(WARRICK walks into the lab.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Whew, man. Guys like Brass have it easy. All they got to do is call it in.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, check this out. I just found it in the hose. It's from a potted plant purchased at the house company. Confirms Todd Coombs' alibi.</p>
<p>(WARRICK nods, turns and immediately pulls out a pin from the METAL tray.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You saw this? A pin from the Palms. Linley Parker worked at the Palms.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [TRUNK] LINLEY'S body is put into the trunk; her pin falls off. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: A lot of people work at the Palms. And it doesn't nail Todd Coombs.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI -- LAB] </p>
<p>(CATHERINE stares a the wall covered with LINLEY PARKER'S crime scene photos. GRISSOM stands next to her and reads her the DNA report.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: According to the DNA, the blood from Linley Parker's smashed window matches the semen from all the rapes.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Which means it doesn't match Todd Coombs.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Or Kevin Coombs. Or any of the rest of the brothers Grimm.</p>
<p>(They turn to the BOARD with the photos of all the suspects on it.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Linley was absolutely certain that Todd Coombs raped her.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's not what the evidence says.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, maybe the evidence is wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You can be wrong, I can be wrong, the evidence is just the evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Deep down, tell me you don't think this guy is good for this.</p>
<p>(GREG opens the sliding door and gives his report.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I got the DNA on the hair you lifted off Linley Parker's body. Get this. It's Todd Coombs.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Puts him with the body.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It doesn't prove rape.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'll have Brass bring him in.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE leaves.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM] </p>
<p>(TODD COOMBS is standing in the waiting room when GRISSOM walks in. He puts his kit down on the table along with the other things he's carrying.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Would you strip down to your shorts, please, doctor?</p>
<p><strong>Todd Coombs</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm going to examine your clothing for any trace evidence, and we're going to document your body for any injuries that may have been sustained during a recent struggle.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Coombs</strong>: I don't have any injuries.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: If you'd like, this officer will assist you.</p>
<p>(He turns and removes his shirt.)</p>
<p><strong>Todd Coombs</strong>: I did not rape that woman. I did not kill her. You guys proved that and you let me go.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM opens a package to take the shirt. He puts the shirt in the package. TODD COOMBS removes his pants and hands that to GRISSOM also. GRISSOM puts it in a second bag.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM sees the bruises on TODD'S wrists. He takes a photo of the bruises.)</p>
<p><strong>Todd Coombs</strong>: That's from moving boxes.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Thank you. Turn around, please.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM finds a scar at the base of his spine.)</p>
<p><strong>Todd Coombs</strong>: That's an old scar. I was a bone marrow donor. My youngest brother Joss had leukemia.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hold still please.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes a photo of the scar. The flash from the photo reveals a pattern on TODD'S back. GRISSOM looks up, unsure that he even saw what he thought he saw. He raises the camera and snaps another photo. Sure enough, the branching pattern is there.)</p>
<p>(Thinking about it, GRISSOM goes to his kit to get the ALS.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Turn off the lights, would you, please, officer?</p>
<p>(The OFFICER shuts the lights off. GRISSOM puts on the goggles and turns the ALS on. On his back there is V-pattern markings.)</p>
<p><strong>Todd Coombs</strong>: What are you looking at? </p>
<p>(Stunned, GRISSOM removes his goggles.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - GRISSOM'S OFFICE] </p>
<p>(GRISSOM does some research into TODD COOMBS' condition. He turns the page and finds a photo of the pattern nearly like those on TODD'S back.) </p>
<p>(It reads:<br />
Mosaicism causes Blaschko's lines ...<br />
Patterns are caused by Chimericism ... </p>
<p>(He continues to read:<br />
Fraternal twins (two separately fertilized eggs) collapsing ... </p>
<p>(There's a photo of the collapsed egg.)<br />
Tissues from two different embryos can fuse into one.</p>
<p>(He reads something else)<br />
Chimera<br />
Human Genetics: Dual Identities</p>
<p>(Camera lingers on a picture of the mythical Chimera.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM thinks about it for a moment, then pulls out the case file. He goes through the photos and finds a photo of a Chimera on TODD COOMBS' desk.)</p>
<p>(Grissom takes off his glasses and pulls out a magnifying glass just to be absolutely certain that it is a Chimera.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM] </p>
<p>(GRISSOM ties a tube around TODD COOMBS' arm to draw blood. TODD'S wearing the orange clothes that GRISSOM left for him.) </p>
<p><strong>Todd Coombs</strong>: This is harassment. I've already given you guys a DNA sample.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You know that bone marrow donation you gave your brother? (GRISSOM draws the blood.) I checked your medical records. His body rejected it and he died. My guess is that's when you first found out about your unique condition.</p>
<p>(Busted, TODD COOMBS gives it up. He turns and glares, almost smirks at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Todd Coombs</strong>: The doctors explained it. I'm a creature of myth. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: A chimera. Head of a lion, body of a goat, tail of a dragon. You're a genetic anomaly. One person, two completely different sets of DNA.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes the blood-filled tube and holds it up.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM] </p>
<p>(BRASS interviews TODD COOMBS. A camera records the session.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: State your name for the record.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Coombs</strong>: My name is Todd Coombs. I raped and murdered Emma Dobbins and Linley Parker. There are more, but we'll talk about those later.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: How'd you pick your victims?</p>
<p><strong>Todd Coombs</strong>: They picked me.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE watches the interview from the observation room. GRISSOM explains.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sometimes fraternal twins, two separately fertilized eggs, develop into only one person.</p>
<p>(Quick Scope View of one embryo incorporates into the other.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) In effect, one twin dies in embryo, but its DNA survives in the other.</p>
<p>(End of Scope view. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's why the DNA from his buccal swab matched his hair but not his semen.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So he had two strains of DNA in his body.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, and the DNA in his semen, was evidently from his dead twin brother.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You never met Emma Dobbins or Linley Parker. </p>
<p><strong>Todd Coombs</strong>: I didn't have to meet 'em. You go to a bar, you see an attractive woman, make your move, she shoots you down. You go home, you m*st*rb*t*. You get on with it. But when I see a woman who arouses me ... the whole world disappears ... except for her. She can't say no.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) -- NIGHT] </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (V.O.) What a night. You guys hungry? Want to get something to eat?</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS STRIP - SIDEWALK - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(WARRICK, NICK and SARA walk along the sidewalk.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No, I think I'm going to call it a night.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, me, too.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I feel ya. Get some rest.</p>
<p>(WARRICK leaves.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: All right, I'll see you.</p>
<p>(SARA grabs NICK'S arm as they continue walking down the sidewalk.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey, hey, Nick, congratulations on your almost promotion. Seriously, you deserve it.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (teasing) Wow. That's really hard for you, isn't it?</p>
<p>(She pushes him away and smiles.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah, it is.</p>
<p>(NICK smiles. SARA continues walking.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - GRISSOM'S OFFICE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(GRISSOM is at his desk when the phone rings. He answers it.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to phone) Grissom. (pause) Yes. (pause) </p>
<p>(He takes off his glasses as he listens.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Is she all right?</p>
<p>[FLASHBACK] </p>
<p>(SARA is driving on the road. The police officer turns the corner and sounds his siren.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: (V.O.) she was lucky she wasn't on the strip. That's highway patrol's jurisdiction. </p>
<p>(Cut to: SARA takes a breathalyzer test.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: (V.O.) She blew .09.</p>
<p>(SARA looks around.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY / WAITING ROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(The OFFICER escorts GRISSOM through the hallway.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Technically, she's over, but they just lowered the limit, so we cut her a break and didn't book her. But we did have to call the supervisor.</p>
<p>(They turn into the WAITING ROOM. The OFFICER points to SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, thank you. I appreciate the courtesy.</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p>(The OFFICER leaves. GRISSOM walks over to SARA and sits down next to her. She stares out straight in front of her.)</p>
<p>(He looks at her and sighs. He reaches over and takes her hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Come on. I'll take you home.</p>
<p>(SARA lowers her head.)</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK</p>
<p><strong>End</strong></p>

[INT. CONDO - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Camera Close-Up of: Various colored perfume bottles.)</p>
<p>(Fade to black.)</p>
<p>(Fade In to: Camera moves across room; past trash cans with a towel on it; past an exercise machine in front of a door.)</p>
<p>(Dissolve to: A Woman sleeps in bed.)</p>
<p>(Fade to black.)</p>
<p>(Fade In to: Close up of woman sleeping. Her eyes flutter open and she turns her head.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: The Woman gets up and walks down the stairs into her living room. She turns on the light. She looks around.)</p>
<p>(Close up of: Wind turning the pages of a magazine on the table.)</p>
<p>(The woman feels the breeze. The fan overhead is turned on. She turns around to look at the light switch. There's fingerprint smudges on the light switch. She turns around and looks around.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: The woman looks down at something. Camera refocuses and shows a glass of water on the table and its condensation pooling on the glass table top.)</p>
<p>(Something's not right. The woman can feel it.)</p>
<p>(Camera lingers on the woman's front door. It zooms toward the lock; through the keyhole; down the front walkway; turns the corner into the next door neighbor's door.)</p>
<p>(Camera zooms through the keyhole; and into the woman's bedroom where there's a woman screaming. There's a man straddled on top of her on her bed.)</p>
<p>(She continues to scream. The man gets up and off of her. He runs away.)</p>
<p>FLASH TO WHITE:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(BRASS escorts GRISSOM and CATHERINE to the crime scenes.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Dispatch said breaking and entering and sexual assault?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, he never touched the first girl. The bedroom door was blocked.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What do you mean, &quot;blocked&quot;?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: With a treadmill. We've got two apartments here; 1213 and 1214. We think the girl in 1214 has physical findings.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You think?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, she locked herself in her bedroom, won't let anyone with a y chromosome within fifty feet of her.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE heads for apartment 1214.)</p>
<p>(BRASS walks past a woman in her robe talking to a female officer.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (to GRISSOM) That's the lucky one.<br />
(They walk into apartment 1213.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. APARTMENT 1214 - LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks into the apartment. There are several officers there.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, guys. Catherine Willows from CSI. Could you all clear the residence, please?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE takes her cap off.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: I'm first officer, ma'am. I can't leave a crime scene unless I get orders from my C.O.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The victim's well-being takes precedence over everything. Right now, this is Joanne Crooks' apartment, not our crime scene. So ... there's the door.</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: All right, come on.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Thanks. Thank you. Appreciate it.</p>
<p>(The door to the bedroom opens a bit. CATHERINE heads for the bedroom.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. APARTMENT 1213 - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Inside, BRASS shows GRISSOM how the person broke into the apartment.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Doreen Bainbridge locks her doors every night. Says the girl next does the same. It's a twist lock. It allows for five inches of night air. Very secure ... unless you reach in ... three seconds. (BRASS pushes the glass door open.) Crime of opportunity, huh?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM shines his flashlight on the glass door. There are smudges outside the glass.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah ... except somebody was watching this girl.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO: END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<hr />
[INT. APARTMENT 1214 - BEDROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE knocks on the bedroom door. JOANNE CROOKS sits on her bed.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Joanne ... all the guys have left. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE sticks her head through the open door and pushes it open.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It's just me. I'd like to ask ...</p>
<p>(JOANNE CROOKS stands and starts to change the bedsheets.)</p>
<p><strong>Joanne Crooks</strong>: (interrupts) I told you guys, I don't know what he looked like, okay? It was pitch black.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, I'm not a cop; I'm with the crime lab. I'd, uh, I'd like to process the bed sheets ...</p>
<p><strong>Joanne Crooks</strong>: I don't think so.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, would you allow me to take samples from you?</p>
<p><strong>Joanne Crooks</strong>: Sorry. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Look, I know this is really horrible.</p>
<p><strong>Joanne Crooks</strong>: I want to get the b*st*rd off of me, okay? Off of my things. Don't you get that?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Washing away evidence hurts any chance of finding out who raped you.</p>
<p><strong>Joanne Crooks</strong>: He didn't rape me, okay? I woke up and he was on my chest.<br />
(She shows CATHERINE her sticky hair.) Look at this. It's not hair gel.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: If you let me recover that evidence, we can stop him from doing this to somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>Joanne Crooks</strong>: Maybe I'm selfish. I don't know; I don't really care about anybody else right now.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, then let's get him for what he did to you.</p>
<p>(This stops JOANNE CROOKS. She turns around to look at CATHERINE and nods.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. APARTMENTS -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(WARRICK places a measuring ruler around a shoe print in the dirt. He takes a picture of it.)</p>
<p>(He puts the camera aside and takes out a measuring tape.)</p>
<p>(Dissolve to: WARRICK puts a metal frame around the imprint to take a cast of it.)</p>
<p>(Dissolve to: WARRICK picks up the tub of paste and starts mixing it. He pours it into the metal frame around the shoe print.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. APARTMENT 1213 - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM lifts prints off of the glass sliding door.) </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Someone looking through the window and watching the woman inside.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: Someone watching another window and watching the woman inside. He touches the glass and leaves behind fingerprints.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM presses the tape down on the glass and lifts the prints.)</p>
<p>(NICK is next to GRISSOM examining the ledge under the window next to the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, Grissom. (They both kneel to look at what NICK'S found.) Got what looks like a semen stain. It's crusted, it's not fresh. Still, it confirms your theory that he's been watching her for awhile. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM stands and leaves. After a moment, NICK looks up and finds GRISSOM gone.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey ...</p>
<p>(NICK walks through the path and finds GRISSOM in front of the glass door of the next apartment. He's staring at the glass door.)</p>
<p>(NICK walks up to him.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He's been watching a lot of people.</p>
<p>(NICK looks around.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, there are hedges outside of every one of these apartment windows -- that's built-in concealment. </p>
<p>(For the second time, GRISSOM walks away.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, this guy was having his own little private peep show. I ...</p>
<p>(NICK turns around and notices that GRISSOM'S gone. Over at the next apartment, WARRICK continues to process evidence. He looks over at NICK and lifts his hands. I don't know. NICK sees WARRICK and shrugs back.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. COURTROOM -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The doors open and SARA walks in. Court is in session.)</p>
<p><strong>Melissa Winters (prosecutor)</strong>: Last, I would like to thank you for working late into the night. During this trial, you have heard people portray the defendant in glowing terms. He may be all of these things. He certainly seems likable. That doesn't change the fact that he got behind the wheel of his car legally drunk, and drove through an intersection, killing Shelley Daniels, a 12-year-old child. </p>
<p>(SARA takes a seat and listens to The Prosecutor's closing remarks.)</p>
<p><strong>Melissa Winters (prosecutor)</strong>: When you go into that jury room, I ask that you seek justice and return with a verdict of guilty. Not for me, not for his honor, not even for Shelley Daniels. I ask because Justice itself demands it. Justice is greater than our personal feelings. Than ... revenge, than ... than pity. Do not shrink, do not disappoint, but rather ... embrace it. Thank you.</p>
<p>(SARA smiles, impressed by what she just heard. The Prosecutor wheels herself back to her place behind the table. She leans in and speaks with the lawyer next to her.)</p>
<p><strong>Judge</strong>: The jury may retire to the jury room. I'll advise counsel when the jury has reached a verdict.</p>
<p>(The JUDGE hits the gavel against the desk. The people in the courtroom start to disburse. SARA approaches the Prosecution's table.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Where do I sign up?</p>
<p><strong>Melissa Winters</strong>: I wish you could. I'm sorry. Thank you for coming on such short notice.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Your message said it was important.</p>
<p><strong>Melissa Winters</strong>: Yes, People v. Archer. Trial's on deck this Thursday. I prepped all weekend. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It should be a slam dunk.</p>
<p><strong>Melissa Winters</strong>: Great. I've handed the case over to another D.A., Greg Rubio.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Melissa Winters</strong>: He's quick on forensics, he's great on game day.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Melissa, we've been building this case together for six months. What's going on?</p>
<p><strong>Melissa Winters</strong>: I'll be dead.</p>
<p>(The news comes as a complete shock to SARA.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. OUTSIDE COURTROOM -- MORNING]</p>
<p>(SARA and MELISSA WINTERS talk.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I never felt comfortable asking you about your, uh ... </p>
<p><strong>Melissa Winters</strong>: My wheels?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I mean, I know somebody broke into your house, shot you and your husband.</p>
<p><strong>Melissa Winters</strong>: Made me a widow, left me a souvenir. </p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV to: The bullet travelling through the skin and muscle and lodging there. End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Melissa Winters</strong>: At the time, the doctors said if they removed it, I'd die. But in the last few years, the bullet has meandered. Last week, my voice gives out during a cross. I have trouble swallowing. Hand starts to shake. My neuro calls it &quot;Traumatic Basilar Artery Aneurysm.&quot; Um, he has to &quot;clip&quot; the artery.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, if they're fixing the artery, that's good.</p>
<p><strong>Melissa Winters</strong>: The operation's delicate. The odds are, well ... low. I've really enjoyed working with you, Sara.</p>
<p>(She holds her hand out. SARA takes it.)</p>
<p>(MELISSA WINTERS leaves.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI -- DNA LAB]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE enters the DNA lab.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Greg ... get anywhere with the semen I recovered from Joanne Crooks' hair? I sent it back with an officer.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Uh, low volume, no sperm.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: That's impossible.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yeah, I knew you'd say that. </p>
<p>(GREG gives CATHERINE the test results and goes back to what he's working on. CATHERINE examines the results.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, the trailer before the movie.</p>
<p>(GREG lifts his head and looks at CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE leaves the lab.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI -- A/V LAB]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks into the Audio/Visual lab.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, Grissom, thanks for the lift.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE stops next to GRISSOM who is working on the computers.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Grissom, uh ...</p>
<p>(GRISSOM doesn't look up at CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (louder) Grissom?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM is startled. He turns to look at CATHERINE. He's having difficulty hearing her and must see her to read her lips.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (soft, distorted) That must be some good evidence. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (misunderstanding) You have evidence?</p>
<p>(The distortion continues.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No. It turns out the semen in the vic's hair was pre-ejaculate, which, of course ...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (louder and clearer) ... carries no sperm, therefore, no DNA.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (normal voice) So, I got this poor woman's hopes up for nothing. How about you?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns back to the computer in front of him.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I went back to the crime stats ... pulled up all the reported peeping toms in a two-block radius over the last year.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (looking at the wall monitor) Unsolved ... any of these women get a description?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He had &quot;raccoon eyes.&quot; And that's about it. Plus, nobody called in any follow-up reports.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, I guess half the problem's the name-- &quot;Peeping Tom.&quot; It just sounds so innocuous when, in fact, &quot;peeping&quot; is the first step in the evolution of a sexual predator.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And I'm afraid our &quot;Tom&quot; is on an escalated pace. Tonight was his first breaking and entering with an immediate second B&amp;E plus what appears to be his first sexual assault.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, we know what road this guy's on. It's just a matter of time before he rapes and murders.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah ... we better find him.</p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI -- A/V LAB]</p>
<p>(Everyone working on the case meets to share information.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Victims' profile: Both women are single, under 30, live right next door to each other in a large apartment complex.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Have we had any luck on cross-referencing any of the guys in their lives?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Uh, no crossover so far. Doreen Bainbridge works in the corporate field and Joanne Crooks is a dancer, so feels like completely different social circles.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: But they're in the predator's comfort zone which means he probably lives in the area, too. What else?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We're still working on some shoe prints but the plaster's still wet.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Blow dry it. It'll give us approximate height and shoe size.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, and the semen sample I recovered is still being processed in DNA.</p>
<p>(GREG walks into the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Not anymore. I'm done. And no jokes about me being fast in this department. The ejaculate outside the first girl's window -- spank high. Good news: It does have DNA.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Whose?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I don't know. Ran it through CODIS, nothing kicked out.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, it's possible this guy's so new he doesn't even have a record.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, I can tell you this about him: Really low sperm count. Sample hardly had any swimmers.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: That's probably from excessive masturbation. Guy's been outpacing his ... (WARRICK turns to look at NICK.) ... ability to produce ... (NICK looks up and notices everyone looking at him.) ... sperm ...</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, you'd know it, Spanky.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: It's just a hunch.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Hey, that can happen to any guy.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, not outside some poor woman's bedroom window.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: All right, let's keep after it. This guy won't stop till he's caught.</p>
<p>(WARRICK closes the file folder in front of him.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI -- FORENSIX AUTOPSY]</p>
<p>(DOC ROBBINS pushes a body back in the storage unit. He closes the door. SARA enters the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey, Doc. You got a minute?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Sure, just finishing. Some people actually do die of natural causes in Vegas you know.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So I hear.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: So what's on your mind?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Um ... a friend of mine's going in for surgery. Traumatic Basilar Artery Aneurysm. You, uh, mind walking me through it?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: It's a rough procedure. The basilar is the chief blood supplier to the brain stem. Here, I'll show you.</p>
<p>(He reaches up on the shelf for a thick book and walks toward his desk.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: They put the patient under hypothermic arrest, meaning the heart will be stopped and blood artificially circulated.</p>
<p>(He opens the book to a diagram and shows it to SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: The objective is to decrease blood pressure so the aneurysm can be clipped. Imagine taking a knife to a balloon.</p>
<p>(Quick Flash to: MELISSA WINTERS is face down on the operating table as the surgeon works on her. Camera moves to the surgeon's POV, through the machinery and to the muscles in her neck. The camera moves past the bullet and to the machine as it works on the artery.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (V.O.) The neurosurgeon has just under an hour. One slip, the artery ruptures causing a catastrophic brain hemorrhage.</p>
<p>(Flash to white. End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: She said she was going to die.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Nine out of ten times, Sara. I'm sure her doctor told her.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. HOSPITAL]</p>
<p>(SARA walks onto the floor. DR. STEWART is at the nurses desk filling out a form.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (to nurse) Excuse me, do you know where I can find Dr. Stewart?</p>

<p>(TAYLOR REED pulls out a folded piece of newspaper from his pocket and shows it to CATHERINE as if that slip of paper explains it all.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>Taylor Reed</strong>: Besides, what, what's he going to do to me?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, Wendy did okay. Um, the problem I'm having is that those apartments there's always an availability so, um, kind of gives you a plausible excuse anytime, anywhere, doesn't it?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, I like those shoes. What size are you?</p>
<p><strong>Taylor Reed</strong>: Eight and a half.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Eight and a half, huh? Do you mind if I look at the soles?</p>
<p>(TAYLOR REED puts his feet up on the table. CATHERINE examines the shoes.)</p>
<p><strong>Taylor Reed</strong>: You seem disappointed.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, how would you feel about allowing me to look at all your shoes from home? I mean, it'd be strictly voluntary.</p>
<p><strong>Taylor Reed</strong>: I don't know if I'd be comfortable with that.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: A young, white male living in a targeted neighborhood -- I'd think you might want to, you know, help rule yourself out.</p>
<p><strong>Taylor Reed</strong>: I value my privacy.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Of course you do.</p>
<p>(TAYLOR REED stands up and looks at CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Taylor Reed</strong>: Am I free to go?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah. </p>
<p>(TAYLOR REED starts walking toward the door. CATHERINE stops him.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh. Uh, Mr. Reed. If Wendy attacked you and you're innocent, I'd think you might want to file charges against her. How come you didn't?</p>
<p>(TAYLOR REED takes a step toward CATHERINE and nods his head.)</p>
<p><strong>Taylor Reed</strong>: Uh, no. I do. Want to. File charges, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You sure? I wouldn't want you to do anything you didn't believe.</p>
<p><strong>Taylor Reed</strong>: No, she assaulted me. I want to file.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We'll take a report.</p>

[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - BRASS' OFFICE]</p>
<p>(TAYLOR REED sits in BRASS' office behind his desk. BRASS pushes a piece of paper toward TAYLOR REED.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I want you to know once you sign that complaint, it becomes a binding legal document, all right?</p>
<p>(Through the hallway glass window, CATHERINE watches TAYLOR REED sign the paper. BRASS looks up at CATHERINE and subtly nods his head. CATHERINE leaves and walks down the hallway.)</p>

<p>(WENDY looks at the blood stain on her sweater sleeve. She can't believe what she's hearing.)</p>
<p><strong>Wendy</strong>: He's filing charges on me? This is ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Agreed. May I please take that swab?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE takes a swab of WENDY'S mouth.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm going to need that jacket, too.</p>
<p><strong>Wendy</strong>: That's great, you know? The guy's out there raping women and I end up getting strip-searched by the police.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Wendy, I can't discuss an ongoing case, but what I can tell you is if we're going to get this guy, it'll be because of what you're giving us right now.</p>
<p><strong>Wendy</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>Wendy</strong>: Okay.</p>

[INT. CSI -- LAB]</p>
<p>(SARA works on the computer looking through various photographs of blood stains from the WINTERS' crime scene.)</p>
<p>(She pages through eight photograph of blood stains and the ninth photo of VICTOR WINTERS, shot and lying on the couch. She looks at the blood stain on the shirt.)</p>
<p>(Something doesn't add up.)</p>
<p>(She goes back to the report:</p>

[INT. CSI - HALLWAY]</p>
<p>(Carrying the photo, SARA heads out the room and down the hallway. She meets NICK along the way. NICK turns around from wherever he's going and follows her.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Roger Wilder said he was inside Melissa's house which is true. He described the exact layout of the room. But he said he found the gun when he destroyed the coffee table and I have no evidence to disprove that.</p>
<p>(They enter the lab.)</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - LAB]</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, go for logic. Some guy breaks into the Winters' house shoots 'em both and leaves his gun behind? Why?</p>
<p>(SARA picks up a box from the floor and opens it. Inside is VICTOR WINTERS' shirt in an evidence bag.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I don't know.</p>
<p>(SARA takes the shirt out of the bag.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, if it was really there, how come CSI didn't find it?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: That's a very good question. I knew something was off when we saw that shored wound. It didn't match up with Melissa's account. If her husband was standing up like Melissa said when he was shot blood would have dripped down from the entry wound to the belt buckle.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah. Gravity only runs one way.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: A gun is fired. The bullet pierces the shirt and the blood run down and seeps through the shirt making a stain that runs downward. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(SARA spreads the shirt out and looks at the blood flow. This blood stain runs from the bullet hole to the right. The conclusions are obvious.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: This blood trail ... the only way it's going ... south ... he was laying down. </p>
<p>(SARA looks at NICK. NICK doesn't say anything. The evidence speaks loud and clear. NICK leaves the room. He leaves SARA alone with the shirt and her thoughts.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (quietly) She lied.</p>

[INT. CSI - HALLWAY]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks rapidly through the hallway. GREG jumps out of his lab and intercepts her. He carries a file folder with her test results.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: He-ya! About the blood on kung fu lady's clothes.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Greg, I don't want any other cases jumping mine. This is priority.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Eh ... If I had a dime ... anticipating that, I skipped dinner and ran the DNA through CODIS.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mm.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Turns out that your apartment hunter, that girly man, left his double helix behind at another crime scene.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE'S eyes widen. She takes the results from GREG and looks at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (reading) Unknown subject, five months ago breaking and entering, burglary.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: They had nothing to compare it to at the time.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: But we do now.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>(GREG turns his head to the side and taps his finger to his cheek as if expecting CATHERINE to plant him one there. CATHERINE, thrilled with the results, walks past GREG and back down the hallway.)</p>

[INT. HOSPITAL - MELISSA WINTERS' ROOM -- DAY]</p>
<p>(SARA knocks lightly on the door. She opens it and walks inside. She sees her friend awake in bed.)</p>
<p><strong>Melissa Winters</strong>: (hoarsely): Sara, hey.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (smiling) Hey. You did it.</p>
<p><strong>Melissa Winters</strong>: Yeah. I beat the odds. I got lucky.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Lucky and smart. </p>
<p>(SARA stands at the foot of her bed and looks a bit awkward.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (quietly) I reopened your case.</p>
<p><strong>Melissa Winters</strong>: Yeah, my doctor mentioned it. He said that he gave you the bullet.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I know what you did, Melissa. I examined the evidence. Your husband wasn't-standing in front of the couch struggling with some stranger.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: VICTOR WINTERS is asleep on the couch with the television on. MELISSA WINTERS walks up to him carrying the gun.)</p>
<p><strong>TV Sports Announcer</strong>: ...And the wildcats hang on...<br />
(She points the gun at her husband and fires.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: There was no stranger. He was, uh, asleep, wasn't he? On the couch?</p>
<p><strong>Melissa Winters</strong>: You're the one with the evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You had a CSI who was about to retire who was predisposed to believe the testimony of an honest prosecutor like you. Especially since you got shot, too?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: MELISSA WINTERS standing over her husband with the smoking gun. In shock at what she's done, she drops the gun on the floor and takes a step back. She sits down on the floor, she covers her face with her hands and cries.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: See, he leaned up from a prone position.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: VICTOR WINTERS wakes up and looks at MELISSA who is on the floor crying. He leans over the edge of the sofa and picks up the discarded gun. He points it at his wife. She slowly raises her head. He fires.)</p>
<p>(He drops the gun and falls back on the couch. Dead.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The directionality of the blood tells the story.</p>
<p><strong>Melissa Winters</strong>: I didn't understand why I couldn't move my legs.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: And you couldn't let anyone find that gun. They would have tested your hands for GSR.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: MELISSA WINTERS struggling to sit up. She reaches over for the gun. She grabs the gun and falls backward on the floor.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: MELISSA WINTERS under the glass coffee table tucking the gun inside the wooden beam. That done, she falls back to the floor, unconscious.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Melissa Winters</strong>: I thought I could go back. That I could get rid of it.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Somebody else did that for you. I almost had him arrested for a murder you committed. </p>
<p><strong>Melissa Winters</strong>: You would think that an attorney could come up with a great case against an abusive husband, but I was ashamed. I didn't want people to know what he did to me.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: All your closing arguments, all your big talk about Justice. I fell for all of it.</p>
<p><strong>Melissa Winters</strong>: I've always believed in Justice. I still do.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (quietly) You never expected to live, did you?</p>
<p><strong>Melissa Wilder</strong>: No. Out of all the CSIs, I knew I could depend on you.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I guess I'll be seeing you in court. Good-bye, Melissa.</p>
<p>(SARA turns and leaves the hospital room. She closes the door and looks up at the officer standing outside. She nods to him and he enters the hospital room as she walks away.)</p>

[INT. CSI - AUDIO/VISUAL LAB]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks through the hallway and into the Audio/Visual Lab where GRISSOM is sitting behind the computer.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: How's your chart of escalation?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: De-escalating. I had figured Taylor Reed was branching out, widening his circle, but after last night, I think he's pulling in, going back to his original comfort zone. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Was one of your original burglaries located at 13200 Appian way?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM types in the address into the computer. The following results show:</p>
<p>[Summary for 13200 Appian Way Crime Scene Report<br />

Case: Breaking &amp; Entering<br />
... Offender broke through a sliding glass door on the first floor.<br />
...CB: Case File (48377-587) ]</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Five months ago. First floor. Broke in through a sliding door.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Where our guy Taylor Reed cut himself on the glass. So, we've narrowed the epicenter down to a single block-- Appian way. I'm thinking if we find something overlooked at those early crime scenes on Appian, we can tie it to our sexual assaults.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: De-escalation. If we can't get to where he's going, we'll go where he's been.</p>

<p>(A WOMAN answers the front door. NICK is on the front porch)</p>

<p>(BRASS and CATHERINE walk up to the next door.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So help me out. What's a delicate way to say this? I'd like to barge in, tear your apartment upside down look for five-month-old evidence?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You're the poet.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'm glad you noticed.</p>
<p>(They reach the front door. Through the window they see the lights on inside.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Looks like somebody is still awake.</p>
<p>(BRASS knocks on the door. The front door opens ... )</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Las Vegas Police ...</p>
<p>(... and they come face-to-face with TAYLOR REED.)</p>
<p><strong>Taylor Reed</strong>: Detective. Ma'am.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>Taylor Reed</strong>: I live here.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: This is not the address on your driver's license.</p>
<p><strong>Taylor Reed</strong>: People move.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Right. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We'd like to come in.</p>
<p><strong>Taylor Reed</strong>: Sure. </p>
<p>(He stands aside and they walk into the apartment. CATHERINE turns her flashlight on and starts to look around.)</p>
<p><strong>Taylor Reed</strong>: Pardon the mess.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm going to take a guess here. This apartment came on the market five months ago. The old tenant was bothered by the breaking and entering, the bloodstain that you left behind. You moved into the apartment you committed your first crime in, didn't you? </p>
<p>(CATHERINE turns her flashlight on TAYLOR REED and starts to examine him.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Now you're ready to move again, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You weren't looking for another apartment. You were looking for ... </p>
<p>(CATHERINE sees a part of hair torn off from the back of his head. Her eyes widen.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: ... another victim. You got something to hide, Reed?</p>
<p>(TAYLOR REED doesn't respond. CATHERINE starts to examine the floors.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Jim?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE leaves the living room area and starts walking down the hallway. She's looking for something.)</p>
<p>(Almost near the end of the hallway, she sees it. A piece of bloodied hair with torn scalp in the middle of the hallway floor.)</p>
<p>(TAYLOR REED notices that CATHERINE sees the hair. He turns to run, but BRASS is there to stop him.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE opens the door and finds a bound woman on the floor.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Jim, we need an ambulance!</p>
<p>(CATHERINE kneels down next to the woman.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Miss, are you all right? It's over. It's over. It's okay.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>

[EXT. - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The woman is being wheeled away on a gurney. CATHERINE stands nearby. She peers into the window of the police car and looks at TAYLOR REED who's sitting inside. They look at each other. CATHERINE walks away.)</p>

[INT. CSI - LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(SARA sits on the locker room bench. GRISSOM stands near the door looking through a locker.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The cop read Melissa her rights right there in the hospital room. You think you know somebody.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I never think that.</p>
<p>(SARA looks up at him.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Ever? </p>
<p>(After a moment, she turns away and stares at the locker in front of her.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: When I was a kid I was playing hide-and-seek one day and I found this plastic bag under my big brother's bed. I thought it was a bag of dirt so I took it to my mom. Turned out it was his bag of weed. He was grounded for a year.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The best intentions are fraught with disappointment.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Emerson?</p>
<p>(He closes the locker door and looks at SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Grissom.</p>
<p>(SARA turns to look at GRISSOM. He lifts an eyebrow. She turns back to look at the lockers in front of her.)</p>
<p>(Looking back at SARA, GRISSOM slowly leaves the locker room. SARA closes her eyes and lowers her head, her silence as heavy as her thoughts. The camera moves away from SARA ... )</p>

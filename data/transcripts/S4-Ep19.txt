<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT] </p>
<p>[EXT. ABERNATHY RESIDENCE - DRIVEWAY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(The lamp post light over the driveway flickers out then goes back on again.)</p>
<p>[INT. ABERNATHY RESIDENCE - MASTER BEDROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Open on a framed photo on the bedside table of a man and a woman smiling. Camera moves over and across the bed to the closed bedroom door. Under the door through the crack we see swirling smoke seeping into the bedroom.) </p>
<p>[MARTHA JAMES' BEDROOM]</p>
<p>(MARTHA JAMES sleeps quietly in her bed.)</p>
<p>[SAM ABERNATHY'S BEDROOM]</p>
<p>(Camera sweeps low across the floor - along the thrown puzzle pieces littering the carpet and over to the bunk bed ladder. It rises up and finds SAM ABERNATHY sleeping in bed.)</p>
<p>FADE TO:</p>
<p>[SABRINA'S BEDROOM]</p>
<p>(The focus is on the neatly made bed and the stuffed animal on it. Smoke rises up from the floor to cover the bed like a cloud completely obscuring it from our vision.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. ABERNATHY RESIDENCE - FRONT YARD - NIGHT - LATER]</p>
<p>(The bedroom windows explode and a stream of fire bursts out of the house. A fireman walking across the lawn ducks instinctively.)</p>
<p><strong>Fireman</strong>: Go pull a line towards the garage.</p>
<p>(The house is on fire and fire fighters are attempting to put it out.)</p>
<p>(Two firemen assist MARTHA JAMES and JESSICA ABERNATHY out of the house.</p>
<p><strong>Jessica Abernathy</strong>: Sam?</p>
<p><strong>Fireman</strong>: (o.s.) Knock it down.</p>
<p><strong>Jessica Abernathy</strong>: (hysterical) Sam? Where is Sam?</p>
<p><strong>Fireman</strong>: You're going to be all right.</p>
<p>(The firemen lead MARTHA JAMES and JESSICA ABERNATHY across the lawn and away from the house fire.)</p>
<p><strong>Jessica Abernathy</strong>: What about Sam?! Sam!</p>
<p><strong>Fireman</strong>: I'm going to need you to stay right here, ma'am.</p>
<p><strong>Jessica Abernathy</strong>: Sam. Where is he? Where is...?</p>
<p>(A FIREMAN pushes the door open and exits the house. He's carrying SAM ABERNATHY in his arms.)</p>
<p><strong>Fireman</strong>: Hey, I got one more!</p>
<p>(The FIREMAN carries SAM over to his mom and the medic.)</p>
<p><strong>Fireman</strong>: Here you go, pal. You stay right here with your mom.</p>
<p>(The MEDIC takes SAM'S hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Fireman</strong>: Ma'am, is there anybody else in there?</p>
<p><strong>Jessica Abernathy</strong>: No.</p>
<p>(The FIREMEN open another hose and aim it at the house. The house is on fire.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(CATHERINE and NICK carry their kits and walk toward WARRICK who is standing on the side on the driveway next to the Arson Investigator, JACK. They're both watching the fire.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p>(WARRICK and JACK turn around.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What's with the 911 page? Fire's not even out yet.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Jack's an arson investigator. We were here on this same street ten days ago. </p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: Garage fire a few houses down. Deemed intentional.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So you think it's a serial?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I don't know, but I'm keeping my eyes peeled. Maybe they came back to take a look.</p>
<p><strong>Fireman</strong>: (o.s.) We got another one. </p>
<p>(A FIREMAN comes out of the burning house carrying a body.)</p>
<p><strong>Fireman</strong>: Got another one.</p>
<p>(He makes his way toward the medics. JESSICA ABERNATHY is completely confused, but she recognizes her own daughter.)</p>
<p><strong>Jessica Abernathy</strong>: Sabrina?</p>
<p><strong>Fireman</strong>: We need a paramedic right now. She's not breathing.</p>
<p>(JESSICA kneels down next to her daughter.)</p>
<p><strong>Jessica Abernathy</strong>: Sabrina, what are you doing here? You weren't supposed to be here. Sabrina?</p>
<p>(The MEDICS work on SABRINA, but she's already gone.)</p>
<p><strong>Jessica Abernathy</strong>: (sobbing) Please help me. Please.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I think our arsonist just turned into a murderer.</p>
<p>(Camera rises up above the scene of the PARAMEDIC working on SABRINA as sounds of her mother sobbing are heard.)</p>
<p>FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN</p>
<p>[EXT. ABERNATHY RESIDENCE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(The CORONERS zip up the body bag with SABRINA ABERNATHY inside and put the gurney in the back of the CORONERS' van. CATHERINE and JESSICA ABERNATHY stand off to the side watching.)</p>
<p><strong>Jessica Abernathy</strong>: She wasn't even burned.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Smoke inhalation happens really fast. I'm so sorry. I heard you say she wasn't supposed to be home tonight. Was she with her dad?</p>
<p><strong>Jessica Abernathy</strong>: My husband died five years ago in a car accident. She ... was at her friend Molly's house for a sleep-over. At least she was when I went to bed.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What time was that?</p>
<p><strong>Jessica Abernathy</strong>: I don't know, 11:00, 11:30.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mrs. Abernathy, do you have any idea what may have caused the fire?</p>
<p><strong>Jessica Abernathy</strong>: I go to bed, I make sure the lights are off, lock the doors.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Do you know anyone who might want to set fire to your home?</p>
<p><strong>Jessica Abernathy</strong>: I go to work. I take care of my kids and my mother, and that's my life.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[FRONT YARD - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(NICK faces the crowd and takes photos of the curious onlookers.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Thanks a lot.</p>
<p>(He snaps more photos, then puts the camera down.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay, folks, any information you feel like you may have...</p>
<p>(MARTHA JAMES taps NICK on his shoulder.)</p>
<p><strong>Martha James</strong>: How am I going to get my fosamax?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Oh, well, I'll make sure you have your medications by breakfast, okay? You're going to be all right. Everything's okay.</p>
<p>(A FIREMAN appears and pulls MARTHA JAMES off to the side.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: This man will take care of you, okay? </p>
<p>[FIRETRUCK (PARKED) - FRONT SEAT - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(SAM ABERNATHY points to something up above expecting the FIREMAN sitting next to him to explain it to him. WARRICK stands just outside the open passenger seat door and listens.) </p>
<p><strong>Sam Abernathy</strong>: What does that one do?</p>
<p><strong>Fireman</strong>: That one? That turns on the siren, so we can get to places really fast. </p>
<p><strong>Sam Abernathy</strong>: To help people burning inside?</p>
<p><strong>Fireman</strong>: That's right.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Abernathy</strong>: But not my sister.</p>
<p><strong>Fireman</strong>: Yeah. (He puts a hand on the little boy's shoulder.) I'm sorry, buddy. </p>
<p><strong>Sam Abernathy</strong>: It's okay.</p>
<p>(SAM looks at the FIREMAN who looks past SAM at WARRICK.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[INT. CASINO - BATHROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(In the middle of the bathroom floor is a very large dead man wearing a red shirt with &quot;735&quot; in white on the front.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So the morning cleaning crew found him. No ID, but this was in his pocket.</p>
<p>(BRASS explains what he knows to SARA and GRISSOM. He shows the paper to SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Looks like some kind of code.</p>
<p>(She looks at the wordlist.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: &quot;735&quot;?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: His goal weight? (BRASS shrugs. He gives up while he's ahead.) I'm going to talk to housekeeping.</p>
<p>(He turns and leaves the rest room. SARA and GRISSOM step forward to get to work. GRISSOM puts his kit down on the floor next to the body.)</p>
<p>(He opens his kit and removes a camera. He takes a photo of the head wound.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's a nasty head wound.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It's always reassuring to see an empty soap dispenser in a public bathroom.</p>
<p>(SARA hands the bagged note to GRISSOM. She leans in close over the bathroom counter and looks at the cracked mirror with blood running down the front.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So I'm thinking this is how the vic got his head smashed in.</p>
<p>(Through the reflection in the mirror, we see GRISSOM stand up behind SARA to look at the mirror.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [BATHROOM - EARLIER] ADAM BRENNER hits his forehead against the mirror. The mirror cracks and ADAM falls back to the floor. Someone standing behind him steps aside.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM holds out a swab. SARA takes it from him.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>(She takes a sample of the blood on the mirror.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM puts on his latex gloves while staring at the blood stain on the floor. He sees something on the blood.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's common to find something in blood. Uncommon to find something on blood.</p>
<p>(SARA watches him as he picks up the black thing. He looks down at the body and checks the eyes.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Petechial hemorrhaging. Asphyxia.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Head bashed in and asphyxiated. No soap was the least of his problems.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM glances up at SARA.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS COMMUNITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p><strong>Jack (arson Investigator)</strong>: (V.O.) The smoke detectors' batteries are all dead. </p>
<p>[INT. ABERNATHY RESIDENCE - SABRINA'S BEDROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(JACK, the arson investigator, shows CATHERINE, WARRICK and NICK through the house.) </p>
<p><strong>Jack (arson Investigator)</strong>: Sabrina's was the only bedroom that sustained any fire damage at all.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Her mother thought that she wasn't home.</p>
<p>(WARRICK takes a photo.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: But she wasn't asleep.</p>
<p><strong>Jack (arson Investigator)</strong>: Not in her bed.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks over to the small space and finds SABRINA'S hide-away - books and other junk - evidence that a teenager had been there.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: SABRINA sits in the small space reading the book while music blares in the background.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: That would explain why the firemen didn't find her right away.</p>
<p>(WARRICK takes a photo.)</p>
<p><strong>Jack (arson Investigator)</strong>: But it doesn't explain what she was doing down there.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: If you can explain the behavior of teenagers, more power to you.</p>
<p>[KITCHEN]</p>
<p>(JACK kicks at the burned linoleum on the floor.)</p>
<p><strong>Jack (arson Investigator)</strong>: Adhesive they use to put this stuff down is highly flammable. Crack in the linoleum, the fire will just seek it out and go for it.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks up at the fluorescent lights on the ceiling. WARRICK takes a photo of the things on the floor.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks at the burned stove. WARRICK tries the back door. He opens it and closes it.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (to JACK) This door's unlocked.</p>
<p><strong>Jack (arson Investigator)</strong>: The firemen said they only used one point of entry and exit: The front door.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mrs. Abernathy said that she locked all the doors before bed.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, this could be how Sabrina got in. Comes home late, forgets to lock the door behind her. It's an opportunity waiting to happen.</p>
<p><strong>Jack (arson Investigator)</strong>: Let's check out the living room.</p>
<p>(He turns and leads them into the next room.)</p>
<p>[LIVING ROOM]</p>
<p><strong>Jack (arson Investigator)</strong>: A few cheap, wood panel walls. Polyester curtains, couple of fake plants. All highly flammable.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE picks up an unburned bottle of alcohol.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Plus ... a bar full of liquid fire with a low flash point.</p>
<p>(She throws the bottle aside. JACK sees the broken table on the floor.)</p>
<p><strong>Jack (arson Investigator)</strong>: Coffee table.</p>
<p>(They both approach the remains of the sofa.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Couch?</p>
<p><strong>Jack (arson Investigator)</strong>: At some point, I think this was a couch.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: This looks like a liquid pour pattern. High-intensity burn. You think this could be the point of origin?</p>
<p>(Quick CGI flash to: The couch is on fire and burning. End of flash. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Jack (arson Investigator)</strong>: I think this is the area of heaviest damage. The fire spread up and out towards the kitchen.</p>
<p>(JACK takes out a tape measure. His voice fades into the background.)</p>
<p>[DOOR]</p>
<p>(WARRICK kneels in front of the back door and fingerprints the door knob.)</p>
<p>[DRIVEWAY]</p>
<p>(Meanwhile out in the car port, NICK looks around and finds a stack of newspapers only slightly burned. He moves the papers and looks at the concrete burns under it.)</p>
<p>[LIVING ROOM]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE works on the sofa when WARRICK approaches her. He puts his kit down.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: How'd you do?</p>
<p>(NICK walks into the room carrying the stack of newspapers.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Uh, couple of weak partials. What you got, partner?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Newspapers. I found them in the carport.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: That's on the other side of the house.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, it's kind of weird. Completely out of the path of the fire and the firemen said they didn't put them there.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You know the fire down the street was in the garage.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, maybe he started in the carport, Sabrina came home, provided access to the inside of the house.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Did they find an accelerant at the first scene?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Lighter fluid from the garage.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So maybe part of the M.O. is that he uses accelerants that are present.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Let's hope he stuck around long enough to witness the damage.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - A/V LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(NICK and WARRICK go through the video of the observers in the crowd.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: This is home video from the first fire.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: It looks like everybody's neighbor.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, they say arsonists often commit crimes where they feel most familiar. The last fire was set during the day in the garage when the family was out of town.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: A neighbor would know when people were out of town.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Or when the door was left unlocked.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: If this is a serial situation, to go from an empty garage to a whole house full of people, we're talking about a major escalation here.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, a match was found at the first fire. If we could find a match in the debris of the second fire, then we may know for sure.</p>
<p>(On the monitor, a woman stands near the fire truck.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Oh, she looks familiar. Hang on. I may have something.</p>
<p>(He goes to the next video.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: She was at both fires. I got her name off the canvas.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Let's run her.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(NICK does a name check and finds something. She is:<br />
Name: VIVA CHARLES<br />
Address: 22 SUTTER STREET<br />
LAS VEGAS, NV<br />
s*x: FEMALE</p>
<p>Criminal Records: ATTEMPTED ARSON<br />

[INT. CSI - INTERVIEW ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(NICK interviews VIVA CHARLES.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You were arrested for attempted arson?</p>
<p><strong>Viva Charles</strong>: I was exonerated.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I have you on film at both fires on cell crook road.</p>
<p><strong>Viva Charles</strong>: I am not an arsonist.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: That's not what your file says.</p>
<p><strong>Viva Charles</strong>: The law doesn't make much of a distinction between arsonists and pyromaniacs.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What is the distinction?</p>
<p><strong>Viva Charles</strong>: I don't set fires for money or with the intent to cause damage.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: But you do set fires?</p>
<p><strong>Viva Charles</strong>: Mmm. You go home at night, and you feel a little lonely, you put in a racy video.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No, no, no. We're not talking about me.</p>
<p><strong>Viva Charles</strong>: I go home, I rip open my junk mail, and I put it in the fireplace. It's an impulse control disorder ... but it's private. I don't burn down houses and kill children.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Maybe not on purpose, but accidents do happen.</p>

<p><strong>Greg</strong>: You rang?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah. Greg, how'd you like to be listed as an assist on an arson case?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Is that a rhetorical question?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Cool. I collected these matchbooks from the pyromaniac's house, who was ... kind of hot, actually.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Really? You dig chicks who dig fire?</p>
<p>(NICK smiles and doesn't answer the comment.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah. This, uh ... this match was used to start a garage fire a couple of weeks ago. See if you can find a match to ... (NICK empties the pack onto the table. Dozens of matchbooks spill out.) ... one of those. Thanks, pal.</p>

<p>(Quick flash to: [KITCHEN] Someone paints the letters on the floor. The word is on fire. The entire kitchen burns. End of flash. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE opens the fridge and looks inside.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So it has gone from intentional to accidental to personal. Who have we got?</p>
<p>(She takes out a water and heads back to take a seat at the table.)</p>
<p>(WARRICK whips out the photo of VIVA CHARLES.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Nick's girlfriend.</p>
<p>(NICK laughs.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: She's got no personal connection to the family.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, Rick Chilson did call Sabrina a bitch when we were talking.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Charming.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, he's an ass, but his alibi checks out. Surveillance at the Mirage has him playing poker the night of the fire.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What about Cody?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: He was right there with him. But I don't think that kid takes a breath without daddy's nod of approval.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What about suspects within the house?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, who's there? Grandma? I mean aside from being on lockdown, she's arthritic. I don't see her writing on the floor. What about Jessica?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: She seems more frustrated than desperate. Frustration shows you still care.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: And the son, Sam?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I don't think so. &quot;Bitch.&quot; It's such a teenage girl word. </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: That brings us back to Sabrina.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, she did think the baseball team had it in for her. Her family life was no picnic.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What are you saying, she's on a kamikaze mission? Trying to take the whole family down with her?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I might be willing to buy that, but how do we prove it?</p>

<p>(SARA reconstructs the game. She studies ADAM BRENNER'S word list notes.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - A/V LAB] </p>
<p>(SARA shares her findings with GRISSOM. On the overhead projector, she has ADAM BRENNER'S word list up on the wall.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Adam Brenner was a meticulous note-taker. He documented every turn of every game he ever played.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How many words used the letters we found in Adam's body?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: None, actually, at least none with that exact combination. But here's the weird part. One the games didn't add up. </p>
<p>(SARA puts the word list and a photo of CRAIG up on the overhead.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: When Adam played Craig, he had 60 points written down that I couldn't account for. And on that same page of his notebook, I noticed that something had been erased. </p>
<p>(She points to the word: RESIFT (3).)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So I ran it through ESDA. Adam played &quot;exvin.&quot; Everything but the &quot;S,&quot;<br />
60 points.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What's an &quot;exvin&quot;?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You know, I was kind of hoping you'd know. It's not in the OED.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, according to the rules, if you play a bluff and your opponent challenges, you have to take the tiles back, you lose a turn and a minute off your game clock. No points.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Right, and later in that same game, Craig played an &quot;X.&quot; Loxodrome. Now there's only one &quot;X&quot; per game. How did he get it?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CRAIG'S HOTEL ROOM] </p>
<p>(SARA goes through CRAIG'S LOGOS set.) </p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: What are you looking for?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: A six-letter word.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM goes through CRAIG'S things and finds a gun. He picks it up and holds it up.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: P-I-S-T-O-L? It's not the word we were looking for, but it's interesting.</p>
<p>(Near the tip of the gun, GRISSOM sees some dried blood.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's got blood on it.</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: It's a replica. I belong to a communist club. We collect replicas from the fall of the soviet union. And I found that tokarev downtown at a pawn shop.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hmm. A fake gun for a fake word?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [TOURNAMENT] ADAM BRENNER plays a word: EXVIN. He stops the clock.)</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: Exvin?</p>
<p><strong>Adam Brenner</strong>: A wine afficionado who no longer drinks. Exvin.</p>
<p>(CRAIG adds an S to the word. He smiles.)</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: Exvin-S.</p>
<p>(ADAM BRENNER immediately raises his hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Adam Brenner</strong>: Challenge!</p>
<p>(Realizing that he's been set-up, CRAIG glares at ADAM.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: There are six letters missing from your game box. E-X-V I-N-S. You made Adam eat his word.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [BATHROOM] ADAM flushes the toilet and turns around. CRAIG walks up to him and hits him in the mouth.)</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: Yeah, huh? You think you're so clever? I'll let you have some Exvins for dinner.</p>
<p>(He shoves the gun into his stomach and forces the letter pieces down his throat.)</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: Here. Huh!</p>
<p>(He continues to shove the letters down his throat. Then ADAM chokes.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: I just wanted to make it as hard for him to swallow as it was for me. Karmic retribution.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Did you do anything to help him after he started choking?</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: No. I thought it was another fake-out.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How about after he fell down on the floor and stopped breathing?<br />
(CRAIG says nothing.) Out of words?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. ABERNATHY RESIDENCE - KITCHEN -- DAY] </p>
<p>(CATHERINE and WARRICK are back at the house. They each have an ALS and are looking through the house.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: This is old school hydrocarbon detection.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Chafing dish fuel is alcohol-based, but water would have washed away any trace.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Let's just hope that whomever wrote it touched something else.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, it's the only shot we've got, I guess.</p>
<p>(They find something on the bedroom door knob.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hmm. Take a look at this.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, that's good shooting.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE opens the bedroom door and walks into SAM'S room.)</p>
<p>(They use the ALS inside the bedroom and find something in the trash.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh. (She looks at WARRICK.) Hit the jackpot.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I've got some smudges over here, too.</p>
<p>(He shines the light on the bed. Hidden under the mattress, they find dozens of matchbooks and a plastic lizard.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mom was locking the wrong door.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(JESSICA talks with her son.) </p>
<p><strong>Jessica Abernathy</strong>: They're going to ask you some questions about the fire at our house. And you'd better start talking, mister.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE opens the door and calls JESSICA out of the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mrs. Abernathy, would you come with me, please?</p>
<p>(JESSICA ABERNATHY stands up and leaves SAM. The door closes behind her.)</p>
<p>(The door opens and WARRICK enters the room carrying a file folder and a mug. He sits at the table opposite SAM.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey, Sam. </p>
<p>(WARRICK puts the mug down on the table in front of SAM. He opens the file folder.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p>(SAM stares at WARRICK.)</p>
<p>(WARRICK reaches into his jacket pocket and takes out a box of matches.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So tell me, what kind of things you like to do on the weekends?</p>
<p>(WARRICK empties the box of matches onto the table in front of SAM.)</p>
<p><strong>Sam Abernathy</strong>: Watch tv, hang out, play.</p>
<p>(WARRICK lights a match and holds it up in front of SAM.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Like to play with matches?</p>
<p><strong>Sam Abernathy</strong>: Sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Why is that?</p>
<p><strong>Sam Abernathy</strong>: Fire is cool.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(WARRICK throws the match into the mug of water, extinguishing it.)</p>
<p>(SAM looks expectantly at WARRICK. WARRICK nods. SAM picks up the box of matches. He picks up a match and lights it. He puts it out in the mug of water.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You ever have trouble sleeping at night?</p>
<p><strong>Sam Abernathy</strong>: Only when I got woken up.</p>
<p>(SAM picks up and lights another match.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Is that what happened Saturday?</p>
<p>(SAM nods.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [BEDROOM] SABRINA knocks on the back door. SAM looks outside.)</p>
<p><strong>Sabrina Abernathy</strong>: I lost my key. Let me in.</p>
<p>(SAM opens the back door for SABRINA.)</p>
<p><strong>Sabrina Abernathy</strong>: Thanks, dude.</p>
<p>(She walks into the room. SAM shuts the door behind her.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(SAM strikes another match and puts it out in the mug.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Couldn't go back to bed?</p>
<p><strong>Sam Abernathy</strong>: I got a little bit hungry.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback: [KITCHEN] SAM looks through the cupboards and takes out a box of something. In the back of the same shelf is the CHAFING DISH FUEL in a small container.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What'd you find?</p>
<p><strong>Sam Abernathy</strong>: Purple jelly.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Purple jelly?</p>
<p>(SAM strikes another match and puts it out in the mug.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Did you eat it?</p>
<p><strong>Sam Abernathy</strong>: No. Mom uses it for the chocolate pot on our birthdays.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: That sounds like fun.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Abernathy</strong>: Yeah ... except stupid grandma isn't allowed to have chocolate, so we couldn't do it this year.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Oh ... that must've made you mad.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Abernathy</strong>: Ever since grandma moved in, we can't do anything fun.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So, what happened next?</p>
<p><strong>Sam Abernathy</strong>: I played for a while.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [KITCHEN] SAM takes a handful of the fuel and writes on the kitchen floor: BITCH.)</p>
<p>(He lights a match and sets the word on fire. SAM gets up and leaves.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Then what?</p>
<p><strong>Sam Abernathy</strong>: I went to bed ... (SAM perks up) ... and then the firemen came and rescued us.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You like when the firemen come?</p>
<p><strong>Sam Abernathy</strong>: (excited) Yeah. They're so nice. They talked to me and showed me all their cool stuff. This one named George -- he said maybe someday I can meet his dog.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You know, Sam ... that word that you wrote on the floor ... </p>
<p>[OBSERVATION ROOM]</p>
<p>(JESSICA listens and cries.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: you know, that's a really bad word.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Abernathy</strong>: I hear it all the time. My grandma says it. </p>
<p>(In the interview room, SAM strikes a match and puts it out in the mug.) </p>
<p><strong>Sam Abernathy</strong>: My mom says it. </p>
<p>(SAM strikes another match and puts it out in the mug.) </p>
<p><strong>Sam Abernathy</strong>: And my sister says it. </p>
<p>(He strikes another match.)</p>
<p><strong>Sam Abernathy</strong>: Well... she used to say it.</p>
<p>(He blows the match out and watches the smoke rise up from the burned match. He drops it into the mug.)</p>

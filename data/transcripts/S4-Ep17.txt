<p>[EXT. HIGHWAY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[EXT. ROADWAY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[EXT. ROADWAY - DAY]</p>
<p>(A bus travels along the roadway. A car with a young couple in it follows closely behind. The car horn beeps impatiently. The bus continues to travel at its current speed which is apparently way too slow for the car behind it.)</p>
<p>(The driver of the car behind the bus continues to beep his car horn.)</p>
<p><strong>Man (driver)</strong>: (shouts) Come on!</p>
<p>(The man in the car behind the bus continues to beep his car horn in frustration.)</p>
<p><strong>Woman (passenger)</strong>: Honey, just pass him.</p>
<p>(He pulls the car a little toward the center line to see if there's room enough to pass.)</p>
<p><strong>Man (driver)</strong>: (shouts) Move it!</p>
<p><strong>Woman (passenger)</strong>: Calm down and just pass him.</p>
<p>(The man takes her advice and speeds up to overtake the bus but an oncoming SUV stops him. He pulls back into his lane behind the bus to avoid an accident.)</p>
<p>(The bus hits a bump in the road and a human appendage from under the bus flies out and hits the car in the windshield leaving a trail of goo on the glass.)</p>
<p>(The MAN and the WOMAN in the car scream.)</p>
<p>(He hits the brakes and pulls the car over to the side of the road.)</p>
<p>[EXT. ROADWAY - DAY - LATER]</p>
<p>(BRASS looks at the mess on the car's windshield.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (o.s.) Hey, Jim!</p>
<p>(BRASS turns around to see CATHERINE and NICK walk toward him.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We got a call. A possible 4-19. Is there a dead body or not?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: That arm crash-landed on the windshield of the car. According to the driver, it shot out from under the bus. Generally speaking, where there's an arm, there's a body.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What say we check out the bus?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Good call.</p>
<p>(NICK heads over to the bus, passing the female inmates along the way.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Now, the, uh, passengers were on their way to St. Matthew's Church in Pioche. They were from a work release program at Nevada Correctional Institution.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks at the wheels.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay, well, I got some blood on the wheel well.</p>
<p>(She kneels down to look under the bus.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, yeah, that's a definite on the 4-19. </p>
<p>(Under the bus, they see torn bloodied sheets and what's left of the body hanging from the underside rails.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Um, well ... appears to be female. Caucasian.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Tied to the undercarriage ... maybe.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hitch a ride under a bus. Well, that's one way to get out jail.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, and I bet this big boy spit out body parts all the way down the road.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So ... the bus is traveling sixty-five miles per hour. What's the distance from the tip of her nose to the tip of her toes?</p>
<p>FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. ROADSIDE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(CATHERINE climbs out from under the bus. NICK walks over to her.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, looks like she used strips from a white cotton sheet.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, use whatever's available when you're breaking out of prison, I guess.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY] Under the bus, the female inmate hangs on to the sheets. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks at the cotton sheet.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Low thread count. Average tensile strength wasn't strong enough to support her weight.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [UNDER THE BUS] The prison inmate hangs by the cotton sheets under the bus. As the tires spin, she falls to the road. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: The torque of the spinning axle ripped her apart like the rubber off a bad retread.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yep. If she'd used a nylon rope, she'd be on her way to Tijuana.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Right. I'll call auto detail, have the bus sent to the garage, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, hey, after that, grab Sara and go directly to jail. I'm going to supervise this body part collection.</p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
(CATHERINE takes photos while DAVID PHILLIPS collects the body parts.)</p>
<p>(Various flash cuts of the various body parts being collected: The leg, a finger, what looks like an ear, another body part, and even more body parts.)</p>
<p>(Finished, CATHERINE looks around.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay, David, I think that's it.</p>
<p>(DAVID fills out the evidence bag info sheets.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: I'll get these parts to Dr. Robbins. He'll start putting her back together.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(A siren wails in the distance.) </p>
<p>[INT. ADAMS' RESIDENCE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks around and sees the bloodied mess on the floor leading up to the dead body. The knife, presumably the murder weapon, is on the floor next to the body.)</p>
<p>(WARRICK snaps a photo of the body. From where he stands, GRISSOM looks around the apartment.)</p>
<p>(WARRICK snaps a photo of the knife.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM spots more blood on the sofa.)</p>
<p>(WARRICK looks up from the camera and sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Helter-skelter.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah ... except there's no blood spatter on the walls or the ceiling.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We have the murder weapon. He was stabbed in the chest.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [CLOSE UP] of the knife in someone's hand. He stabs the man in the chest. The man grunts. Blood falls to the floor. He falls down. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashes of the body.)</p>
<p>[INT. ADAMS' APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(DET. VARTANN interviews the LANDLORD.)</p>
<p><strong>Landlord</strong>: There's two of them in that apartment. The name's Adanto Adams. He don't live in that apartment. He's visiting from out of town. That's Zero's little brother.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: 'Zero'?</p>
<p><strong>Landlord</strong>: Zero Adams. He's the one who lives there.</p>
<p>[INT. ADAMS' APARTMENT - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks over to the sofa. He looks from the blood spot on the sofa cushion over to the body on the floor.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, unless he was bending over the sofa with his chest pushed against this cushion, this bloodstain is inconsistent with that wound.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Paul, would you turn him over for us?</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(The CORONER standing nearby walks over and moves the body for GRISSOM. On the victim's back, they find more stab wounds. WARRICK and GRISSOM both kneel down to look at the wounds.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Oh, yeah. Stabbed in the chest and the back.</p>
<p>(WARRICK snaps more photos of the wounds.)</p>
<p>[INT. ADAMS' APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The LANDLORD tries to look at the body inside the apartment. DET. VARTANN turns him back to answer the questions.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: So, uh, where is this Zero now?</p>
<p><strong>Landlord</strong>: I don't know. I'm not his mother. I'm his landlord.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Well, if you see him, give me a call.</p>
<p>(DET. VARTANN gives the LANDLORD his card. The LANDLORD takes it.)</p>
<p><strong>Landlord</strong>: Yeah, yeah, sure.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(DR. ROBBINS goes over the preliminary findings with CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: When I do a jigsaw puzzle, I like to start with a corner piece.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: When the puzzle's a body, the corner piece is the pelvis. Oh, uh, Nick ID'd your vic. She missed her last bed check. Convict number sixty-nine twenty.</p>
<p>(ROBBINS hands CATHERINE the file with information and photo. She reads through it.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Antoinette Stella. Two-year sentence for identity theft. She was due for release next month. Guess she was in a hurry.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: No, she wasn't trying to escape. She was murdered. </p>
<p>(ROBBINS picks up the arm off the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: I dissected her arm.</p>
<p>(Camera zooms in for a close up of inside the arm.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: The blood in the brachial artery is clotted, which is indicative of a post-mortem laceration.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Have you determined the cause of death?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Yep. Cranio-cerebral injury...</p>
<p>(He peels back the hair on the head to show the injury underneath.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: ... due to blunt-force trauma. Depressed skull fracture imbedded with tiny white fibers. Given the depth and position of the, uh, fracture, I'd say she was hit on the head with something hard on the inside and white and fuzzy on the outside.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'd like a clean look at that fracture.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Sure. I'll start her bath.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Well, you might want to check out her left forearm.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks but doesn't see anything.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Birthmark?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Rap sheet's referenced &quot;dermatological anomalies.&quot; According to her, she didn't have any. I'll take a slice down to histology.</p>
<p>(ROBBINS grabs a knife off the table and prepares to cut off the skin.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. FALLBROOK WOMEN'S CORRECTIONAL FACILITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. FALLBROOK WOMEN'S CORRECTIONAL FACILITY - CORRIDOR -- DAY]</p>
<p>(WARDEN HUTTON escorts SARA and NICK through the facility to the victim's cell.)</p>
<p><strong>Warden Hutton</strong>: We locked down as soon as we got the call. We do bed checks six times a day. All inmates were accounted for at thirteen hours.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What time did the bus leave for church?</p>
<p><strong>Warden Hutton</strong>: Thirteen-thirty.</p>
<p><strong>Harris (inmate)</strong>: Hey, sexy, how 'bout you come back here on your day off? </p>
<p>(NICK turns and sees HARRIS hanging out through the bars. She tapes the bottom of her chin with the back of her hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Harris (inmate)</strong>: No gag reflex.</p>
<p><strong>Warden Hutton</strong>: Watch it, Harris. Got a drawer full of C-9s with your name on<br />
'em.</p>
<p>(They continue through the hallway to the victim's cell. As they pass a cell, the inmate yells out to them.)</p>
<p><strong>Inmate</strong>: What are you lookin' at?</p>
<p>(They stop in front of the victim's cell where CHRISTINE stands inside.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What can you tell us about the vic?</p>
<p><strong>Warden Hutton</strong>: Antoinette? She was popular with the other inmates. No enemies to speak of.</p>
<p>(The cell door opens.)</p>
<p><strong>Warden Hutton</strong>: This was Antoinette's cell. Christine, you're going to step out. Officer.</p>
<p>(The OFFICER steps forward to escort CHRISTINE out of the cell. SARA and NICK walk into the cell.)</p>
<p><strong>Warden Hutton</strong>: When's the last time you saw baby girl?</p>
<p><strong>Christine</strong>: I'll need to check my calendar.</p>
<p><strong>Warden Hutton</strong>: Don't get stupid on me, Christine.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Baby girl -- was that a street name?</p>
<p><strong>Warden Hutton</strong>: Yes. That's what everyone called her. Christine?</p>
<p><strong>Christine</strong>: I saw baby girl at lunch 'bout an hour before we got on the bus.</p>
<p>(The WARDEN steps into the cell and unlocks the lock on a locker.)</p>
<p><strong>Christine</strong>: Hey, that's my locker. I didn't take none of Baby's stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Warden Hutton</strong>: Didn't say you did.</p>
<p><strong>Christine</strong>: Look ... I didn't hardly know baby girl. She only lived up in here eight days.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Eight days?</p>
<p><strong>Warden Hutton</strong>: In this cell. Few weeks ago, I found her smuggling contraband.</p>
<p><strong>Christine</strong>: It was just a silver necklace.</p>
<p><strong>Warden Hutton</strong>: Inmates aren't allowed jewelry. It wasn't a major infraction, but I transferred her cell.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Makeup, deodorant, shampoo.</p>
<p><strong>Warden Hutton</strong>: Inmates are allowed commissary visits once a month, unless they rack up two weeks in nights.</p>
<p>(SARA finds the shoes at the bottom of the locker and checks it.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Do you keep track of purchases?</p>
<p><strong>Warden Hutton</strong>: I can get you a list. And just for the record, in the state of Nevada, there's never been a homicide in a Female Correctional Facility.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Until now.</p>
<p>(NICK uses the ALS on CHRISTINE'S bed. She sees him and appears alarmed.)</p>
<p><strong>Christine</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I'm ruling you out as a suspect, ma'am.</p>
<p>(He finishes, straightens and sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No evidence of blood.</p>
<p><strong>Christine</strong>: I could've told you that.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Warden, could you show us where the bus was parked before it left the facility?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. FALLBROOK WOMEN'S CORRECTIONAL FACILITY - GARAGE - DAY]</p>
<p>(DOUG HANSON, the bus driver and prison guard at the facility, escorts SARA to the bus.)</p>
<p><strong>Doug Hanson</strong>: The bus was stationed right here.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Are you the only driver?</p>
<p><strong>Doug Hanson</strong>: Only bus driver. Got my CDLC last May.</p>
<p>MAN (over P.A. System) Attention, inmates ...</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Officer, before you drove out of here, did you inspect the vehicle?</p>
<p><strong>Doug Hanson</strong>: Miss ... Sidle, I don't get time to scratch my ass. I haven't had a junior officer in my department in two years. Now, usually, I work the road, and when the warden asks, I take inmates on field trips.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Did you know the dead woman, baby girl, Antoinette Stella?</p>
<p><strong>Doug Hanson</strong>: Start seeing 'em as real people, start carin' when they go back to their pimp dealer scumbag boyfriend?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: That's enlightened.</p>
<p><strong>Doug Hanson</strong>: That's reality.</p>
<p>(NICK joins them.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No sign of a struggle, no evidence of a body drag. If the attack didn't happen in her cell or in here, maybe it happened on the bus.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Who maintains your transpo fleet?</p>
<p>(Off to the side, JUANITA peers around the wire fence. She has a bucket in her hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Doug Hanson</strong>: Fleet? We got three antique buses. Inmates do all the work.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You allow inmates to service your prison vehicles?</p>
<p><strong>Doug Hanson</strong>: You bet. On Saturday, I even bring in my SUV. Juanita washes it.</p>
<p>(He nods over to her.)</p>
<p><strong>Doug Hanson</strong>: Ain't that right, Juan'a? I've got to get something on top of my<br />
$11.65 an hour. (NICK walks away.) Look, we're in the middle of the desert. We're a hundred miles from the pit of nowhere.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Is that gate always unlocked?</p>
<p><strong>Doug Hanson</strong>: It's not like someone's going to hot-wire the bus and hightail it out of here.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Right, so essentially anyone in the prison population could have walked into the garage, onto the bus and no one would have said boo?</p>
<p><strong>Doug Hanson</strong>: Boo.</p>

<p>(DET. VARTANN steps away from FRANK SAMUELS and heads for WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Hey, we were canvassing the area when Mr. Samuels showed up. He says he's the tenant's guardian. He's got questions.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So do I.</p>
<p>(They both turn back to FRANK SAMUELS.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Mr. Samuels, I'm Warrick Brown. I'm from the crime lab.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Samuels</strong>: What happened to Zero? There's crime tape on his door. These guys won't let me in.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: His brother was murdered.</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'm afraid so.</p>
<p><strong>Zero Adams</strong>: No. Why would he do that?</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Your brother took out an insurance policy with an accidental death clause. It means that if he was murdered, the beneficiary would be entitled to a million dollars. You're the beneficiary.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Unfortunately, the coroner is going to rule the case a suicide ... and not a homicide, which makes that policy worthless.</p>
<p><strong>Zero Adams</strong>: I-I was just trying to help my brother. Oh ... (groans) I want Frank.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Listen to me. Frank will be facing charges of obstructing justice. Do you understand? The court will appoint you another guardian.</p>

<p>(The monitor shows the 3-d image of the skull.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Inner arc is impressed just a little bit deeper into the skull. Check it out.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Like a crater in a crater.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah.</p>

<p>(JUANITA looks at CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Tattoo. Baby Girl had the other half.</p>
<p><strong>Juanita Roya</strong>: I'm not ... like that.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It wouldn't be the first time to cross gender lines in search of some ... affection.</p>
<p><strong>Juanita Roya</strong>: It was the first time I felt that way about anyone.</p>

<p><strong>Juanita Roya</strong>: If there's one thing I learned in prison ... it's to stick up for myself ... because nobody else will.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I think that you should know that Baby Girl was telling the truth about the transfer. It wasn't her request. It was Warden Hutton's decision. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE shows JUANITA the necklace.)</p>

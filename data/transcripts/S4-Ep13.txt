							<p>COLD OPEN:</p>
<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Camera pulls back across the city's building tops during the voice over announcement.)</p>
<p><strong>Ty Caulfield</strong>: (V.O.) People say that Las Vegas has no culture, ... no history-- that we emulate, ... not create.</p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO:</p>
<p>[EXT./INT. CASINO - POOL SIDE / EXHIBITION HALL - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(TY CAULFIELD, the casino owner, makes the grand formal announcement to the small gathering in front of him.)</p>
<p><strong>Ty Caulfield</strong>: They forget that this was once a desert from which this city was created. </p>
<p>(Waitresses dressed in kimono and obis -- dressed up like geisha -- pass out drinks to the crowd.)</p>
<p><strong>Ty Caulfield</strong>: Millions come every week and share their money with us. Well, tonight, we give back.</p>
<p>(Cut to: Inside the exhibition hall, glass cases display the various Japanese antiquities. The camera moves in slowly toward the centerpiece, a katana. The guard walks around the display case.)</p>
<p><strong>Ty Caulfield</strong>: (V.O.) An exhibition of rare and valuable japanese antiquities.</p>
<p>(Cut to: A Japanese statue of a soldier on a horse.)</p>
<p><strong>Ty Caulfield</strong>: (V.O.) Shown in the us for the first time,<br />
(Cut to: A close up of the katana's intricate sheath design.)</p>
<p><strong>Ty Caulfield</strong>: (V.O.) ... this 17th century samurai collection ... </p>
<p>(Cut to: Camera is focused on the full Japanese armor in the background. The camera refocuses to the statue in the foreground.)</p>
<p><strong>Ty Caulfield</strong>: (V.O.) ... is owned by one of the Mediterranean's most special guests, Mr. Yuri Yamamoto, who sadly can't be here with us tonight.</p>
<p>(TY CAULFIELD raises his glass to the crowd.)</p>
<p><strong>Ty Caulfield</strong>: To his impeccable taste. On behalf of my hotel and the City of Las Vegas, I thank him.</p>
<p>(The audience cheers. TY CAULFIELD takes a sip of his glass.)</p>
<p>(A woman's screams pierces through the applause. Everyone turns around.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[POOL SIDE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(VANESSA GREEN stares at something horrible in front of her and screams. TY CAULFIELD rushes over to see what the commotion is about.)</p>
<p>(She waves him near as she looks at the live wire cable near the pool.)</p>
<p><strong>Vanessa Green</strong>: The cable fell. He was electrocuted.</p>
<p>(In the center of the swimming pool, there is a body floating face down.)</p>
<p><strong>Vanessa Green</strong>: Oh, my god.</p>
<p>(She turns and buries her face in the shoulder of the man standing there.)</p>
<p>(TY CAULFIELD and the crowd of curious party goers rush toward the pool.)</p>
<p>(The SECURITY GUARD steps forward and motions everyone to a safe distance away from the pool side.)</p>
<p><strong>Security Guard</strong>: Excuse me. Okay, folks. I need everyone to stay back. There's a live wire in the pool, okay? Everybody stand back.</p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO:</p>
<p>[EXT. POOL SIDE - NIGHT - LATER]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and SARA head toward the pool. As they near, they take the scene in. GRISSOM stands next to BRASS who is looking at the body in the water. SARA heads for the live wire.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Watch yourself Gil.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM steps even closer to the pool side, his eyes on the body in the water. He takes the scene in.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This is odd. Arms and legs become deadweight in the water. He should have sunk to the bottom of the pool. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: He wouldn't float until after putrefaction.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sara, would you see where the source of that cable is?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(SARA heads toward the cable. She follows it to the bushes. GRISSOM picks up the pool pole. SARA steps into the bushes as she finds the cable source: a car battery. She picks it up carries it back to GRISSOM.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Found the power source. Car battery.</p>
<p>(She disconnects the cable.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM uses the pole and pulls the body toward him. He picks up the head of the body and finds a CPR dummy. GRISSOM looks at BRASS.)</p>
<p>(BRASS shakes his head.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This is not a crime scene.</p>
<p>(The hotel security alarm blares. GRISSOM and BRASS turn to look at the exhibition room entryway.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. EXHIBITION ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(BRASS pushes the doors open and walks into the room followed closely by GRISSOM, SARA and the SECURITY GUARD.)</p>
<p>(The glass case housing the 17th century Japanese katana is broken. The sword is gone.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks down at the SECURITY GUARD duct taped on the side. He turns and looks at the broken glass case.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: THIS is a crime scene.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[INT. HOTEL/CASINO - EXHIBITION ROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(The alarm blares. GRISSOM looks at the taped up SECURITY GUARD explaining what he's about to do.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm sorry, but there's really no gentle way to do this.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM reaches out and rips the tape off of BRANDON MILLER'S mouth.)</p>
<p>(BRASS walks into the room past all the curious on-lookers and hotel security standing on the side.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Keep these people out. And turn that damn thing off, will you?</p>
<p>(He heads for SARA who stands in front of the broken glass case.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: They only took the one piece. Samurai sword, 17th century.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: They say how much it was worth?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Worth the risk of walking past 100 guests into a guarded room.</p>
<p>(The alarm stops. BRASS turns around and looks at BRANDON MILLER.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hey, buddy, you see anything?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM crouches behind BRANDON MILLER trying to cut the tape off of him.)</p>
<p><strong>Brandon Miller</strong>: No. I got hit from nowhere. Next thing I know, I'm taped up.</p>
<p>(BRASS looks at GRISSOM. GRISSOM nods at the desk.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Blood smear on the desk.</p>
<p>(Camera close up of the blood smear.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Someone clubs BRANDON MILLER behind his head. He falls unconscious, the intruder forcibly hitting his head against the desk.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Brandon Miller</strong>: I feel like an idiot.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, you may have a concussion.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Let's get you checked out.</p>
<p>(BRASS looks at the door and shouts.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Paramedics out there?</p>
<p>(A couple of paramedics walk into the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Check him up.</p>
<p>(SARA continues to examine the room. She walks up to the Japanese armour in the glass case and looks at it. She looks at the display card: SUIT OF ARMOR, 17TH c. She continues looking down and notices some clear liquid at the base of the show case.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: The paramedics escort BRANDON MILLER out of the room as the HOTEL SECURITY walks in.)</p>
<p><strong>Head of Hotel Security</strong>: Well, none of my men saw anyone suspicious enter or exit.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The surveillance cameras?</p>
<p>(They stop and both look at the broken, empty case.)</p>
<p><strong>Head of Hotel Security</strong>: Our cameras only watch the money and the exits. Not rooms like these. Damn, they got the sword. Most expensive piece in the collection. This is all Mr. Caulfield needs right now.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM pauses and looks up as he listens.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Why is that?</p>
<p><strong>Head of Hotel Security</strong>: 9/11, the depressed Asian economy, Indian gaming in California. Every casino on the strip's taken a hit.</p>
<p>(BRASS nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'm going to want to talk to the girl who found the body.</p>
<p>(BRASS steps out of the room.)</p>
<p>(Meanwhile, SARA takes a swab sample of the clear liquid. She looks at it and smells it.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Smells sweet. The sign over there says no food or drink in this room, right?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Make sure you take it back to Greg.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks around and notices the empty tape roll on the stand. He removes the tape roll and looks at it.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. VACANT HOUSE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(CATHERINE and WARRICK walk up the sidewalk toward the front of the house. They meet up with the officer at the scene.) </p>
<p><strong>Woman Officer</strong>: My third time at this address. Two suicides a few years ago, and now a 419. This house is cursed.</p>
<p>(She leads them up the front walk toward the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You don't strike me as the type who believes in curses.</p>
<p>(She turns around.)</p>
<p><strong>Woman Officer</strong>: Yeah, well, I'm not the type to believe in coincidences, either.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Is this house abandoned?</p>
<p><strong>Woman Officer</strong>: Bank foreclosed four years ago. Been vacant ever since. </p>
<p>(She turns and continues to lead them under the crime scene tape toward the front entrance.)</p>
<p><strong>Woman Officer</strong>: Neighbor heard a scream. I was the responding officer.</p>
<p>[INT. VACANT HOUSE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks into the house, her flashlight on. WARRICK follows her as she heads inside. They turn around to look at the WOMAN OFFICER who declines and stays outside the house.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE continues forward through the house. In one of the bedrooms, they find DAVID with the body. He's engrossed with filling out the clipboard and doesn't notice them.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Uh ... oh, hey, David.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: (startled) Yeah! (He looks up.) Oh, hey. Uh, jugular's been punctured. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE steps closer for a better look.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Two marks. (points to the marks) Possibly bite marks.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Bite marks?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE kneels down for a better look.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Punctures are 32 millimeters apart. That's the average distance between the eyeteeth in an adult male's mouth.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Right, but those punctures aren't consistent with human teeth.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Yeah, well, what about fangs?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Fangs? Come on.</p>
<p>(DAVID opens the woman's mouth to show her pierced tongue and ... fangs.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Wounds are deep. She bled out.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Then where's all the blood?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Lividity tells me she wasn't moved postmortem, so, I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'm going to take a look around.</p>
<p>(WARRICK stands up and leaves the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: David, I don't know a whole lot about vampires, but if she was bit, there's spit, and if there's spit, there's DNA, so swab the neck.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (o.s.) Catherine, take a look at this. </p>
<p>[MAIN HALL -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(WARRICK looks down at something on the floor. CATHERINE joins him. He's found a red-painted insignia on the wooden floor.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Please tell me that's not blood.</p>
<p>(They step into the room. CATHERINE takes a sample and tests for blood.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Negative. It's probably just house paint.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, we know one thing for sure. This place wasn't vacant. </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. HOTEL/CASINO -- POOL SIDE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(BRASS talks with the HEAD OF HOTEL SECRUTIY. Behind them near the pool, NICK is examining the CPR dummy.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Come on, nobody should have been allowed to leave.</p>
<p><strong>Head of Hotel Security</strong>: Your officers didn't say anything about detaining Mr. Caulfield's guests.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Just give me a list of names, okay?</p>
<p><strong>Head of Hotel Security</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(HOTEL SECURITY leaves.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Weird night.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (points to the dummy) That's not the only dummy here.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, it's a CPR demonstration dummy. Fully articulated.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah. You know, paramedics, firemen -- they use these things to teach lifesaving techniques.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Any prints?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Oh, no, no, no. Been in the water way too long, man. Sorry.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(DOC ROBBINS goes over the body. CATHERINE and WARRICK walk into the room.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: David says you found evidence of vampires in North Las Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, let's just say evidence at the crime scene suggests occult, ritualistic activity.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm not sure what we found. Did you ID the Vic?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Angela Sommerville, 20, from Henderson. License was in her pocket. Cause of death: Exsanguination.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You check out her fangs?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Well, her bark was worse than her bite.</p>
<p>(ROBBINS opens the body's mouth.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: There we go.</p>
<p>(He removes the fangs from her teeth.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Ah. They're acrylic. Check out her gum line.</p>
<p>(Camera zooms in for a close-up of the gum line.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Thin grooves carved into the canine's enamel. Fangs are clip-ons. Multiple bite marks on the tongue suggest she was still breaking them in.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Warrick, the symbol on her ankle -- it's similar to the one that was painted on the floor of the crime scene.</p>
<p>(WARRICK looks.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: The ankh. Egyptian symbol for eternal life. I went on-line and found out it's also the universal insignia for vampires.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Dracula didn't drink all her blood. I sent a sample to tox. I'm not sure if it's probative. </p>
<p>(He points to the markings on her shoulders.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Multiple incised wounds on the anterior of both shoulders. Some are fresh.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, the shoulder area is rich in blood, right? Heals quickly?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Yeah. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks at WARRICK and shakes her head.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Relevance?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I figure, if you're going to drink someone's blood, it's a good place to start.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Then why switch to the jugular?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - LAB -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(GRISSOM works on the tape removed from BRANDON MILLER'S mouth. SARA walks into the lab.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey. Got anything?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: A partial thumb, perhaps, on the tape that was used to cover the security guard's mouth. Not torn, either. Both ends were cut.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Pre-cut, in fact. Indicates planning.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How about you? </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Trace analyzed the liquid we found near the suit of armor: Glucose syrup.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sugar water. Why just the sword?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, it is the one piece from the exhibit you could hide on your person. Down a pant leg, maybe, or ... </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, but if you're going to steal from a casino, why take an antique? Why not take cash?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Good point.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How's your knowledge of Japanese history, particularly, antiquities?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (smiles and shakes her head) Not good. Why?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: To find the hunter ... know the game.</p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) -- DAY] </p>
<p>[INT. SOMMERVILLE RESIDENCE - ANGELA'S ROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(The bedroom door opens; CATHERINE and WARRICK walk in followed by the SOMMERVILLES.) </p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Sommerville</strong>: Angela was the sweetest child. She actually liked spending time with us. Her friends were always over here, and then ... puberty hit and everything changed. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks around the room and notices a framed prom photo.)</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Sommerville</strong>: She shaved her head, then she grew dreads. </p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Sommerville</strong>: It was like she couldn't get comfortable in her own skin.</p>
<p>(On the bedside table are some candles.)</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Sommerville</strong>: About, um, six months ago, Angela went Goth. Black clothing ... she only went out at night ... </p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Sommerville</strong>: We tried to support Angela the best we could. We only wanted her to be happy.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE picks up a book and reads the title and looks through the book.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: &quot;The Black Veil: 13 Rules of Community.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Sommerville</strong>: Guidelines for Vampires. She wrote them down in there, along with all her thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So you've read what's in here? </p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks at MRS. SOMMERVILLE who nods slightly.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Your daughter believed that she was a vampire?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Sommerville</strong>: She was 18. She wanted to stand out, to be special. I tried not to judge her, but I also wanted to know what was going on in her head.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Sommerville</strong>: She snooped.</p>
<p>(MRS. SOMMERVILLE sighs and continues.)</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Sommerville</strong>: Each time Angela tried something new, I would take a crash course.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE reaches into the bookshelf and pulls out a piece of paper. She looks at it:</p>
<p>HIV TEST RESULTS<br />
--NAME: ANGELA SOMMERVILLE<br />
--ID: 3759060X<br />
--AGE: 20<br />
--SEX: F<br />
--E ID NO: 6729-BAMI</p>
<p>--SESSION NO. 716885 20<br />
--ER ID NO. 70722345</p>
<p>RESULT UNITS<br />
NEGATIVE COPIES ... </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Lab results.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Sommerville</strong>: Angela's HIV test. It was negative. That was the one thing we insisted upon, not that it matters now.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We believe this collection is worthless. Well-made, historically accurate, ... probably worthless.</p>
<p>(TY CAULFIELD steps out of the vault and sits down thoughtfully on the table just outside. GRISSOM steps outside also.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Your head of security said that Mr. Yamamoto's collection was documented by an internal registrar.</p>
<p><strong>Ty Caulfield</strong>: Vanessa Green. I-I thought you spoke to her yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: She was on vacation ... but even though she's not an official appraiser, she should've been able to tell these were fakes, don't you think?</p>
<p>(CAULFIELD presses his fingertips against the bridge of his nose.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. HOTEL - HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(The HEAD OF SECURITY leads TY CAULFIELD and GRISSOM to YURI YAMAMOTO'S room.) </p>
<p>(He opens the doors.)</p>
<p><strong>Ty Caulfield</strong>: Mr. Yamamoto? Mr. Yamamoto? I'd like a word with you. Mr. Yamamoto?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It seems he's left.</p>
<p><strong>Head of Security</strong>: Gentlemen, no luggage. Nothing. </p>
<p>(CAULFIELD grabs the vase off the table and smashes it to the floor in anger.)</p>
<p><strong>Ty Caulfield</strong>: Son of a bitch! He made a fool out of me.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, we have that in common.</p>
<p><strong>Ty Caulfield</strong>: Find out when he checked out.</p>
<p><strong>Head of Security</strong>: I'm on it.</p>
<p><strong>Ty Caulfield</strong>: And Vanessa Green. Where did she go?</p>
<p>(The HEAD OF SECURITY picks up the phone.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Brandon Miller, Nathan Pollard, Vanessa Green, and Yuri Yamamoto. Three of your employees and one whale ... all evidently disappear.</p>
<p><strong>Ty Caulfield</strong>: Along with my $10 million.</p>
<p>(The HEAD OF SECURITY hangs up.)</p>
<p><strong>Head of Security</strong>: Yamamoto never checked out. Vanessa Green made reservations at the Princeville in Kauai. She never checked in.</p>
<p><strong>Ty Caulfield</strong>: And he left without his antiques.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well ... he knew they were worthless.</p>

<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[INT. ADMINALAB CLINIC] </p>
<p>(The technician, BOBBY JONES, draws blood from an older woman. CATHERINE and WARRICK step in the doorway.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Um ... </p>
<p><strong>Bobby Jones</strong>: I'll be right with you. (to the woman) The tests will be mailed to you in seven days, and they'll include a toll-free number if you have any questions.</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: Thank you. I didn't feel a thing.</p>
<p>(The WOMAN leaves. CATHERINE and WARRICK walk into the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Jones</strong>: Walk-ins? Or do you have an appointment?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We're from the crime lab. We're here about a Miss Angela Sommerville. Last month, your clinic tested her blood.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Jones</strong>: Actually, we don't do the testing. Common mistake. I'm contracted by Adminalab to withdraw blood, and the lab processes. And the whole thing is confidential, so ...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, we've already seen her results. She's dead, so, the confidentiality privilege no longer applies. We need to know which tech withdrew her blood.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Jones</strong>: I'm the only tech here.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh. Well, there was a pendant with her blood inside it.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Jones</strong>: What does that have to do with me?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Her blood was mixed with a polyester base. I think you know what that means.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Jones</strong>: I ... know who you're talking about.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: BOBBY JONES withdraws ANGELA SOMMERVILLE'S blood.)</p>
<p><strong>Angela Sommerville</strong>: I have a favor to ask you.</p>
<p>(She holds up the pendant.)</p>
<p><strong>Angela Sommerville</strong>: Do you want to help?</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Jones</strong>: I'd taken more than enough for testing purposes, so, I figured it's her blood. Why not just give it to her?</p>
<p>(WARRICK walks around CATHERINE and looks around the lab.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: My bet is that it's against your lab's policy.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Jones</strong>: Great. You going to report me? </p>
<p>(WARRICK opens the refrigerator.) </p>
<p><strong>Bobby Jones</strong>: Uh, you can't go in there.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We have a warrant.</p>
<p>(WARRICK hands the warrant to BOBBY JONES.)</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Jones</strong>: Th-th-that's my personal fridge.</p>
<p>(WARRICK finds a container of blood in the fridge.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Now, what's this blood doing in there?</p>
<p>(BOBBY JONES doesn't say anything.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mr. Jones ... I'm going to need a sample of your DNA.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Jones</strong>: I bet you don't have a warrant for that.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (looking at the container) Catherine, I think we have all we need here.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) -- DAY] </p>
<p>[INT. CSI - BREAK ROOM- DAY]</p>
<p>(SARA carries the sword to GRISSOM.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Handle is molded plastic fiber. Materials are used by hundreds of manufacturers throughout the country. It's impossible to trace.</p>
<p>Nick: Vintage cherry red leathers, bronze pvc fabric, aged. Countless furniture and clothing suppliers. Nothing really unique.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: But the ivory on the sword's scabbard is unique. In fact it's not ivory. It's treated bone from an emu. Inexpensive, but not widely used.</p>
<p>(She gives the sword to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Only about half a dozen us importers. One did recently make a sale to a business in Las Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: That same business also bought vintage leather, molded plastics and everything else he used to make this collection.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Chen's scenic prop house -- owned by Graeme Chen of 1 Engelfield Road, Las Vegas, Nevada. Also his place of business.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: As of five minutes ago, no one's answering the phone.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Call Brass. Get a warrant.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM whips out his mighty sword and startles SARA.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CHEN'S SCENIC PROP HOUSE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(The warehouse doors open. BRASS, GRISSOM, SARA and NICK enter and look around.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know, I always imagined your house would look like this, Gil.</p>
<p>(NICK grins at the comment and heads for the back of the room while the others examine the other items along the way.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, Grissom, check this out.</p>
<p>(On the table are swords in various stages of completion. GRISSOM and SARA join him as they examine the swords.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Prototypes, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, definitely.</p>
<p>(In the back, BRASS continues to search the warehouse. He finds the sleeping area. He walks past a large Mikado showboard with a huge ladder leaning up against it pretty much blocking it.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Looks like Mr. Chen tried a few times before committing.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, he certainly does beautiful work.</p>
<p>(BRASS puts on his latex gloves and moves aside the pants on the bed only to find a wallet just tossed there. And still, the showboard is in the background with the ladder leaning against it.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Want to see a picture of Mr. Chen?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks over to BRASS to find him holding up a NEVADA DRIVER LICENSE for:</p>
<p>CHEN, GRAEME<br />
55 VISTA COURT<br />
LAS VEGAS, NEVADA</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I guess he lived here, too.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mr. Chen is Mr. Yamamoto. He's not even Japanese.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, this is how Ty Caulfield's high rollers live -- a cot in a warehouse.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, I'm guessing he spent all his money on the baccarat tables, buying himself a reputation. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: GRAEME CHEN at the gambling tables. TY CAULFIELD whispers over to the HEAD of SECURITY as GRAEME CHEN fans open his stack of bills. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You got to spend money to make money.</p>
<p>(NICK moves the ladder covering the showboard.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey. Take a look at this.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns around and walks over to SARA who's staring at the Mikado's showboard. On the front are large photos of the actors of THE 33 THEATRE in LAS VEGAS, NV.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Brandon Miller, the security guard, the lifeguard, Nathan Pollard, and I'm guessing the registrar, Vanessa Green.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So, Mr. Chen made their costumes, their props and their scenery.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at the title of the show, Gilbert and Sullivan's &quot;The Mikado&quot;.)</p>
<p>[CUE BACKGROUND: WOMEN CHORUS SINGING]</p>
<p><strong>Women</strong>: (echoy) Three little maids from school are we ... </p>
<p>(GRISSOM starts singing the same phrase.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (singing) ... three little maids from school are we ... </p>
<p>[CUE BACKGROUND: DIGITAL RECORDING TONES BEEPING]</p>
<p>(We hear the faint echoing combination of the digital recording beeps that opened the CAULFIELD vault.)</p>
<p>(He puts it together.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You ever listen to Gilbert and Sullivan?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (nods) No.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Ty Caulfield does.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The code from his digital vault.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Coincidence?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I don't think so. How much does $10 million in cash weigh, I wonder?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: A lot.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sara, I'm going to need the money bands you collected. Nick, you get to do the math.</p>

[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(CATHERINE re-interviews BOBBY JONES. She shows him photos of the container of blood.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The blood in your personal fridge belonged to Angela Sommerville.<br />
(She shows a second photo of the bloody lip print.) We found a lip print on the rim of the container we confiscated.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [INT. CLINIC] BOBBY JONES opens the refrigerator and drinks the blood straight out of the container. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Jones</strong>: It's not a crime to drink someone's blood.</p>
<p>(They're interviewing BOBBY JONES in a weird looking white room.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: How did her blood end up in your fridge?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Jones</strong>: When Angela came in for her HIV test, she asked me to withdraw an extra unit. She paid me twenty bucks to store it, and never came back to pick it up.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And what, you just got thirsty? Angela's test date was 32 days ago, and our lab determined that the blood from your fridge was less than a week old. Would you explain that?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Jones</strong>: Most girls turn away when I stick the needle in.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback of: BOBBY JONES drawing ANGELA'S blood as she watches. He notices that she's not afraid of the blood ... or of the pain.)</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Jones</strong>: (V.O.) She was into it.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Jones</strong>: I started watching over her. She was dating this wannabe total hollywood freak show.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Oh, so you're the real thing?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Jones</strong>: These don't come </p>
<p>(He points to his fangs as he smiles proudly at WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (o.s.) Mr. Jones, give me a file, and I could sharpen my teeth into fangs.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Jones</strong>: I was born with these.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mm-hmm. The night that Angela was murdered, you were &quot;watching over her.&quot;</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [VIEW THROUGH THE WINDOW] ANGELA begs LAZARUS.)</p>
<p><strong>Lazarus Kane</strong>: I will not be tied down.</p>
<p><strong>Angela Sommerville</strong>: No, Lazarus, please don't go.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Jones</strong>: (V.O.) The poser just took off.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Jones</strong>: She ... invited me in.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: ANGELA opens the door to find BOBBY on the doorstep.)</p>
<p><strong>Angela Sommerville</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Jones</strong>: She was glad to see me.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: BOBBY steps into the house.)</p>
<p><strong>Angela Sommerville</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Jones</strong>: We kissed.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: BOBBY kisses ANGELA as she struggles against him.)</p>
<p><strong>Angela Sommerville</strong>: Get off me!</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Jones</strong>: She, um ... &quot;offered&quot; herself to me.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: BOBBY bites ANGELA.)</p>
<p><strong>Angela Sommerville</strong>: Stop it!</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You mean she offered her blood to you?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Jones</strong>: (smiling at the memory) Yeah.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: BOBBY bites ANGELA as she screams and struggles. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: She may have offered her blood to you, but you took her life. You murdered her.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: BOBBY pulls back and takes her blood. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(BOBBY smiles.)</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Jones</strong>: You can't prove that.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: DNA from your saliva was on the rim of the container. It's consistent with the saliva surrounding the puncture marks on Angela's neck.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Jones</strong>: I released Angela from her body. She's inside of me now. A part of me. And she's very much alive.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - EVENING]</p>
<p>[INT. HOTEL / CASINO - CAULFIELD'S OFFICE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(GRISSOM tosses a bag of money on CAULFIELD'S desk.) </p>
<p><strong>Ty Caulfield</strong>: What's this?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This is what's left of your $10 million.</p>
<p><strong>Ty Caulfield</strong>: Thank you for reminding me.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Do you know how much $10 million weighs? </p>
<p>(CAULFIELD shakes his head.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: 220 pounds. Your lifeguard, Nathan Pollard-- 5'6&quot;, 140 pounds. </p>
<p><strong>Ty Caulfield</strong>: Strong little b*st*rd.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mmm. Say, could I borrow $10,000 in $100 bills?</p>
<p><strong>Ty Caulfield</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Only for a demonstration.</p>
<p><strong>Ty Caulfield</strong>: I'm sorry. I'm all out.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's okay. I brought my own. (GRISSOM shows him the blank money bills.) It's only paper, but it's the same size, weight and density. (He puts it down on the table to continue the demonstration.) Did you know ... money bands are wrapped tightly around stacks of bills? They're very difficult to slip off. In fact, the only way you can get them off is to tear them.</p>
<p><strong>Ty Caulfield</strong>: What's your point?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: None of your money bands were torn. Now, I don't know how much money you had in your vault, Mr. Caulfield, but I'm pretty sure I know how much you're going to be asking your insurance company for. You see, that's why you had your<br />
&quot;thief&quot; leave the money bands behind. You hired Mr. Chen and his merry band of actors to rip you off. I'm sure you paid them, but nothing close to $10 million. </p>
<p><strong>Ty Caulfield</strong>: &quot;Your notions, though many, are not worth a penny.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mmm. &quot;The Mikado&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Ty Caulfield</strong>: Notions are all you have. Otherwise, we'd be downtown instead of here in my office. You know, I've always been a big supporter of the arts. Hence, Mr. Yamamoto ... </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Uh, Mr. Chen's ... </p>
<p><strong>Ty Caulfield</strong>: hence, the exhibition. Over the years, I've financed theatrical productions.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Including The Mikado? Well, you know, one of your &quot;partners&quot; is going to come back again someday. He's going to miss his family, friends, the ensemble. He'll be back. And I'm guessing he'll tell us all about your latest production.</p>
<p><strong>Ty Caulfield</strong>: Yes, well, until then, Mr. Grissom.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Until then.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM stands up and collects his things.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm going to hand my findings over to your insurance company. I wouldn't count on receiving a payment.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM picks up his kit and heads out the door ... whistling.)</p>

<p>CSI Season09 Episode15</p>
<p>Kill Me If You Can Wealthy art dealer comes out for a late-night swim.</p>
<p>Somebody's there who shouldn't be.</p>
<p>That is a whole lot of face smashing.</p>
<p>You think it was a crime of passion?</p>
<p>That is what it takes to make great art.</p>
<p>Can you think of anybody who wanted to hurt your fianc?</p>
<p>Carsten was an art dealer.</p>
<p>He dedicated his life to bringing beauty into the world, inspiring people.</p>
<p>Everybody loved him.</p>
<p>$5 million property, 50 cent lock.</p>
<p>Easy access for anyone who wanted to get in.</p>
<p>Thank you for helping out today, Wendy.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm happy to.</p>
<p>We had a lot of bodies today.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, I'm not happy that we had a lot of bodies today.</p>
<p>There's a blood trail here.</p>
<p>I have absolutely no idea how I could have missed that.</p>
<p>Right here... and here.</p>
<p>And here.</p>
<p>It was him!</p>
<p>I didn't think I missed it.</p>
<p>&quot;Gareth.&quot;</p>
<p>He must have snuck in while I was processing the pool.</p>
<p>Well, it is actually his house.</p>
<p>When was the last time you saw Carsten?</p>
<p>After everybody left, he went outside to have a relaxing swim to calm down.</p>
<p>Why did he need to calm down?</p>
<p>I'm not really sure.</p>
<p>Uh, but during the party, I saw him go into his office with a client I hadn't seen before.</p>
<p>The next thing I know...</p>
<p>I want everybody out of here!</p>
<p>Out, out, out!</p>
<p>Party's over!</p>
<p>Carsten was so upset.</p>
<p>But he wouldn't ll me what happened, so I went to bed alone.</p>
<p>The next thing, it was morning and the pool guy was shouting to call the police.</p>
<p>The office should be right up ahead.</p>
<p>Is Brass getting the surveillance?</p>
<p>Yes, but there doesn't appear to be any camera with a clear view of the pool.</p>
<p>Well, I doubt Hef has them in the grotto either.</p>
<p>Obvious signs of a struggle.</p>
<p>I'll swab the usual places for touch DNA.</p>
<p>These are Mesopotamian vases circa 700 B.C.E.</p>
<p>These should be in a museum.</p>
<p>Yes, they're trophies.</p>
<p>Collecting's pathological whether you're a rich man or a serial killer.</p>
<p>Oh, hey, no, Gareth!</p>
<p>No, no, no, no!</p>
<p>Don't lick the evidence.</p>
<p>Go! Go!</p>
<p>And I thought dogs would eat anything.</p>
<p>This is the video surveillance from Carsten Pennington's party.</p>
<p>This all seems consistent with what Carsten's fiance told Brass.</p>
<p>Do we have any idea what prompted his outburst?</p>
<p>I don't know what, but... maybe who.</p>
<p>See, the vic was alone in his office with that guy for approximately seven minutes before buzzkill.</p>
<p>So, now all we need to do is figure out who that guy is.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let me see what I can do.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Are you trying to do my job?</p>
<p>Yes, a little.</p>
<p>Mandy had dusted everything for fingerprints, and unfortunately, she came up empty.</p>
<p>But look at this.</p>
<p>I think that these fragments, the ones that Gareth found so delicious, I think that they used to be a vase that was actually stolen from the Iraqi National Museum.</p>
<p>I think it was smuggled in, like drug-dealer style because basically, all you have to do is take an antique vase, and you wrap it up in a bunch of cellophane, right?</p>
<p>You fill it with some little plastic doodads and candy and slap a &quot;Made in China&quot; sticker on there, and that priceless piece of art can just sail though US Customs like a Tijuana piata.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>{6}P.D.request DNA sample.</p>
<p>Warning: suspect is an actor.</p>
<p>I hate actors.</p>
<p>Okay, I have to go, but I would love to finish putting that back together when I'm done, if it's okay with you.</p>
<p>I love jigsaw puzzles.</p>
<p>So when was the last time you saw Mr. Pennington?</p>
<p>Uh, the other night at his party.</p>
<p>I've been acquiring Mesopotamian antiquities on behalf of the Marrakesh for an exhibit at our casino museum.</p>
<p>I purchased a piece from Mr. Pennington last month.</p>
<p>He called me and said he had a new Babylonian piece for sale, so I went to go see it.</p>
<p>It wasn't what I was looking for.</p>
<p>Why, because it was stolen?</p>
<p>Like from the National Museum of Iraq?</p>
<p>Before... after.</p>
<p>Trafficking in stolen antiquities is illegal, and from what I hear, dangerous.</p>
<p>Which is why people get off on it.</p>
<p>Not me.</p>
<p>Do you know who I work for?</p>
<p>Yeah, Bruce Curtis, CEO of Marrakesh Corporation. I've met him.</p>
<p>Then you know if he found out I compromised his reputation with something like this...</p>
<p>You'd be ancient history.</p>
<p>Look, I don't know who killed Mr. Pennington, but it wasn't me.</p>
<p>And if he was dealing with the black market, then maybe he got what was coming to him.</p>
<p>Stupid lousy jigsaw puzzle.</p>
<p>It's one stupid piece.</p>
<p>You looking for this, Wendy?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>It's done.</p>
<p>It's fake.</p>
<p>How do you know?</p>
<p>The cat told me.</p>
<p>You take a replica vase, you smear it with yogurt, you let it soak in.</p>
<p>Then you mix in mine you're trying to fake.</p>
<p>You let it sit in a hot, dry place.</p>
<p>You let the Lactococcus lactis go to work...</p>
<p>This process visibly ages the piece and creates a true mineral match, which, according to my research, can fool experts and spectrographic analysis alike.</p>
<p>But not a hungry cat?</p>
<p>I have a man in Dubai whose brother is a curator.</p>
<p>The casino guy realized he'd been conned, and was terrified his boss would find out.</p>
<p>What have you done?</p>
<p>Nothing, compared to what I'm going to do to you.</p>
<p>I want my money back!</p>
<p>He was a lot more cooperative as a victim of art fraud than he is as a suspect.</p>
<p>Killing Carsten wouldn't get his boss's money back.</p>
<p>No, so I checked Pennington's bank.</p>
<p>He withdrew over $100,000 the day before he died.</p>
<p>Sounds like Carsten was about to skip town.</p>
<p>That's funny his fiance didn't mention that.</p>
<p>So, what's this about?</p>
<p>Ms.Farrell, were you aware that Mr. Pennington withdrew over $100,000 from his bank accounts yesterday?</p>
<p>Why? Uh, no, I didn't know anything about that.</p>
<p>Then this'll be a short visit.</p>
<p>I found blood stains on Ms.Farrell's party dress.</p>
<p>It's been washed.</p>
<p>I look great in that dress.</p>
<p>I wanted to wear it out tonight, so I had to clean it-- it was dirty.</p>
<p>Those incriminating DNA stains can be so hard to get out.</p>
<p>Which is why professional criminals prefer chlorine bleach.</p>
<p>You use a nonenzymatic detergent.</p>
<p>Good for the environment... and DNA retrieval.</p>
<p>I want an attorney.</p>
<p>Sure, that's your right.</p>
<p>This is how I clean up the planet.</p>
<p>So you think she just didn't know that her fianc was an art faker?</p>
<p>She was living in a swanky house having swell parties and holding court with fine friends.</p>
<p>I don't think she really cared.</p>
<p>Nice work, Doctor.</p>
<p>Nice work to you, too, Simms.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Ray, excuse me.</p>
<p>Could you come in here for a minute?</p>
<p>You need to see this.</p>
<p>It's a person of interes in that motel murder I was working on.</p>
<p>That looks like my 419, Carsten Pennington.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>And it isn't.</p>
<p>Second stage instar.</p>
<p>And since liver is fixed, she's been dead no more than 48 hours.</p>
<p>So Jena Mackin from Hollywood might have died on her 31st birthday.</p>
<p>No cell phone.</p>
<p>But if she has a number, we'll get the records from the carer.</p>
<p>Bullets entered under the chin and exited the top of the skull.</p>
<p>Blood spatter and two holes in the ceiling.</p>
<p>Suggests that she was sitting up when she was shot.</p>
<p>Bullets look like .38s.</p>
<p>Probably a revolver.</p>
<p>No casings.</p>
<p>And they're oxidized.</p>
<p>Our killer doesn't know how to store ammunition.</p>
<p>Though it looks like he knows how to cover his tracks.</p>
<p>Got a coupleossible wine glass stains here, but I don't remember seeing any wine or glasses in the room.</p>
<p>Strange looking void.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>A witness.</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>COD's no mystery-- two GSWs to the head.</p>
<p>But I did find some abrasions in the vaginal vault.</p>
<p>Could indicate rape.</p>
<p>Or rough consensual s*x.</p>
<p>Either way, the, uh, wet mount was negative for semen.</p>
<p>How considerate.</p>
<p>He wore a condom.</p>
<p>Busy night.</p>
<p>Well, the blood void means that the tortoise was there during the shooting.</p>
<p>And this print has got to belong to the killer.</p>
<p>Mandy, what are you thinking?</p>
<p>The ASPCA is gonna shut us down.</p>
<p>Mandy?</p>
<p>The Amido black.</p>
<p>It's minimally toxic; it won't hurt him.</p>
<p>I'll be gentle.</p>
<p>Wonder if he's a rare species.</p>
<p>'Cause I read that African tortoises can be worth as much as $10,000.</p>
<p>Just please hurry, okay?</p>
<p>'Cause he's been traumatized enough already.</p>
<p>He's a material witness in a homicide investigation.</p>
<p>I meant traumatized by you.</p>
<p>So who brings a tortoise to a gunfight?</p>
<p>If the killer was trying to take it with him after he killed the girl, then it stands to reason that the killer brought it in the first place.</p>
<p>Or maybe it was hers, which is why he killed her.</p>
<p>You just said they're valuable.</p>
<p>I got a hit.</p>
<p>Uh, Mickey Ross.</p>
<p>The Mickey Ross?</p>
<p>Who's Mickey Ross?</p>
<p>Mickey Ross is only the star of the Crimson Orchid film franchise.</p>
<p>Ross plays Dr. Harley Copen, physician by day, vigilante by night.</p>
<p>But he doesn't kill anyone; he shoots them in the street and then he fixes them up in the E.R.</p>
<p>Rumor had it that Ross had actual intercourse with his co-star Ginger Snuff.</p>
<p>But a frame-by-frame analysis unfortunately disproved that.</p>
<p>I'll call LAPD.</p>
<p>I wonder if actor man owns a .38</p>
<p>Okay, I just need you to open your... mouth.</p>
<p>That tickles.</p>
<p>They searched his place in Hollywood, no gun.</p>
<p>But they found these.</p>
<p>They don't make that ammo anymore.</p>
<p>It's the same caliber, same brand, same oxidation.</p>
<p>He's a triple threat.</p>
<p>You let me know what comes back from the... electrophoresis gel.</p>
<p>It's how they blood type DNA.</p>
<p>I played a medical examiner in Killer Instinct 3.</p>
<p>Well, I'll catch that on the History Channel, 'cause we stopped blood typing about 15 years ago.</p>
<p>Is he hitting on you?</p>
<p>Yeah, but not very well.</p>
<p>Mm, and luckily I have to go, 'cause somebody lost a contact lens.</p>
<p>Look, this is just a big misunderstanding, Detective.</p>
<p>I ved Jena; I would ner hurt her.</p>
<p>Where were you two nights ago?</p>
<p>I was in LA.</p>
<p>Wrong.</p>
<p>You were with Jena in her motel room.</p>
<p>No, I was in LA.</p>
<p>Save it.</p>
<p>The tortoise gave you up, man.</p>
<p>We found your prints on his shell in Jena's blood.</p>
<p>Wait a minute, you have Gareth?Is he okay?Can I see him?</p>
<p>That puts you at the murder, jackass.</p>
<p>All right, okay.</p>
<p>Yeah, I-I was there.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But I didn't kill her.</p>
<p>Jena was going through some stuff.</p>
<p>Okay?So she wanted to go to Vegas to, uh... pick herself up, have a little fun.</p>
<p>You know?So I thought I'd just drop in on her, and I brought Gareth.</p>
<p>She loved that tortoise.</p>
<p>But when I got to the... room, I found her dead with a gun in her hand.</p>
<p>And instead of calling the police, you cleaned up the scene, you took the gun and her cell phone, and you went back to LA.</p>
<p>Yes, because I knew how bad it looked.</p>
<p>Do you have any idea... any idea at all how... this makes me feel?</p>
<p>To not know that my wife was suicidal... my own wife!</p>
<p>But I was too self-absorbed to even recognize her pain.</p>
<p>Jena was the one real thing in my life.</p>
<p>Jena!Jena!</p>
<p>You think I'm just gonna let you play me like a bitch while you run off with that piece of crap?</p>
<p>You know me better than that, you whore!</p>
<p>See, you can ditch a gun, you can toss a cell phone, but voice mails are forever.</p>
<p>Even when you delete them off your own phone, huh?</p>
<p>She didn't kill herself, Mickey.</p>
<p>Give it up. You're nailed.</p>
<p>This is all because of Tripp.</p>
<p>No, this is all because of you.</p>
<p>Tripp Linson-- he's a producer I met four years ago.</p>
<p>He was gonna produce my comeback feature, Enemy of the People.</p>
<p>It was written up in Variety, maybe you saw it.</p>
<p>Come on, Mickey!</p>
<p>This guy talks me out of 200 Gs to invest in his little movie, okay?</p>
<p>And then he talks his way into my wife's pants.</p>
<p>They become a thing.</p>
<p>But I forgive her.</p>
<p>Then a couple of days ago, I go to the house and I get this little note.</p>
<p>The note says, We're done.</p>
<p>She's gonna run off with Tripp.</p>
<p>So I check the credit card company, find out where she is.</p>
<p>I go to the motel, and I find her.</p>
<p>She's in there, and she's just crying her eyes out.</p>
<p>She found Tripp, but he... the b*st*rd pretended he didn't even know who she was.</p>
<p>Gareth cheered her up.</p>
<p>And then we... we recommitted to each other.</p>
<p>You recommitted?</p>
<p>The ME called it rape-murder.</p>
<p>Rather than be with me... my wife killed herself.</p>
<p>This is our second chance.</p>
<p>You and me, baby! Forever!</p>
<p>That's a nice try, Mickey.</p>
<p>But when people blow their brains out, they only pull the trigger once.</p>
<p>Now, Jena... was shot twice.</p>
<p>No, that's not possible. I was there-- I only heard one shot.</p>
<p>One shot.</p>
<p>Sometimes the gunpowder in old ammunition doesn't burn completely.</p>
<p>This results in shalw rifling marks on the bullet, which only gets partway down the barrel.</p>
<p>If you don't realize what's happened and you try again, the second bullet impacts the first, leaving an indentation in the base and forcing both bullets out of the barrel.</p>
<p>And that... is how you get a twofer.</p>
<p>This is our second chance.</p>
<p>You and me, baby! Forever!</p>
<p>What do you know.</p>
<p>Mickey Ross was telling the truth.</p>

<p>Tripp, can you give us a second?</p>
<p>Look, you know what you get when you have... you have the perfect actor in the perfect part in the perfect script?</p>
<p>One word, dude: immortality.</p>
<p>I'm not gonna even have to ask Mickey to act-- this guy has lived this.</p>
<p>Tripp Linson is awesome.</p>
<p>Jena, what have you got there?</p>
<p>Not &quot;what.&quot; Who. Say hello, Gareth.</p>
<p>He's a gift. For Mickey.</p>
<p>Um, slow and steady wins the race, dude.</p>
<p>We start filming this summer. Go see this movie.</p>
<p>You're never going to regret it.</p>
<p>Ray, excuse me.</p>
<p>Could you come in here for a minute? You need to see this.</p>
<p>It's a person of interest in that motel murder I was working on.</p>
<p>That looks like my 419, Carsten Pennington.</p>
<p>It is. And it isn't.</p>
<p>Hey, do either one of you recognize this guy-- Ryan Morton?</p>
<p>He kind of looks... familiar.</p>
<p>I think I just threw out my back.</p>
<p>Seriously?</p>
<p>I'm good.</p>
<p>No, no, come on out of there, Super Dave. Take a break; we'll get him.</p>
<p>Jimmy, get him out of there for me, will ya?</p>
<p>You all right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Easy. There you go.</p>
<p>There's a body shoved under the steering column.</p>
<p>So, I think it's safe to say somebody didn't want him to be found.</p>
<p>No shell casings, no apparent blood.</p>
<p>Phone.</p>
<p>Did you get an ID on him?</p>
<p>Here you go.</p>
<p>His name's Shawn Hagan.</p>
<p>He's a PI from Tahoe.</p>
<p>Rigor is fully developed.</p>
<p>Makes TOD at least six to 12 hours ago.</p>
<p>No petechial hemorrhaging.</p>
<p>And no bruising on the neck.</p>
<p>So maybe a heart attack?</p>
<p>Or an OD?</p>
<p>But I don't see any drug paraphernalia around here.</p>
<p>The rental agreement said he picked up the car four days ago in LA.</p>
<p>Yeah, and it looks like he was expensing it at $160 a day to a client.</p>
<p>Well, if he bills clients like that for heaps like these, we're gonna have a lot of suspects.</p>
<p><em>******</em></p>
<p>Lucky you were visiting Vegas, Dr. Anton.</p>
<p>What's your business with Shawn Hagan?</p>
<p>It's a personal matter.</p>
<p>Why do you want to know?</p>
<p>Mr. Hagan's case files are on their way down from Tahoe.</p>
<p>So nothing's gonna rein personal very long.</p>
<p>Mr. Hagan is helping me find a former business associate.</p>
<p>That's personal?</p>
<p>It's a private matter.</p>
<p>Have a seat.</p>
<p>Shawn Hagan was murdered last night.</p>
<p>Where were you?</p>
<p>In my hotel room, all night, watching movies.</p>
<p>If Shawn Hagan is dead, Ryan Morton had something to do with it.</p>
<p>Let me guess, that would be your business associate, right?</p>
<p>You know where we might find him?</p>
<p>No. That's what Mr. Hagan was supposed to find out.</p>
<p>Here. That's as much as I know.</p>
<p>I doubt it'll do you any good.</p>
<p>This reminds me of David's back.</p>
<p>Hang on a second.</p>
<p>Looks like a contact lens.</p>
<p>He's not wearing the other one.</p>
<p>Could be from the killer.</p>
<p>I'll get it to Wendy, have her run the clothes for touch DNA as well.</p>
<p>Nick, this is a gunshot wound.</p>
<p>Palm-side entry.</p>
<p>Sooting says that it'a contact wound.</p>
<p>Through and through?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Then why didn't we find the bullet anywhere? Or blood.</p>
<p>Hagan grabs the gun in the course of the struggle.</p>
<p>The bullet tracks along the skin inside the sleeve, reenters the torso, and deflects off a rib into both lungs, then off another rib into the diaphragm... finally coming to rest in the spleen.</p>
<p>Ballistic pinball.</p>
<p>More or less.</p>
<p>Brass-washed .22</p>
<p>High-penetration round.</p>
<p>Bullets sometimes take a long and winding road before they reach their ultimate destination.</p>
<p>Some people, too.</p>
<p>Lake Tahoe-- the Golden West.</p>
<p>This is where fortunes are made.</p>
<p>My name is Ryan Morton, and I want to make you rich.</p>
<p>This country was forged by wildcat entrepreneurs who struck out across an untamed continent to find mountains of timber and rivers of gold.</p>
<p>Those mother lodes are still out there waiting for those who dare to dream.</p>
<p>Looks like Gareth thinks so, too.</p>
<p>Your investment in Royal Tahoe property can yield a 24% return, or even higher.</p>
<p>For a taste of the frontier spirit that made America great, give me a call.</p>
<p>It's hard to believe people actually fall for this crap.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Have you ever known anyone to hit a royal flush playing video poker?</p>
<p>Oh, of course. So... then it could happen to you, right?</p>
<p>You know, there's something about this guy that looks familiar.</p>
<p>Look what Sanitation turned up in a Dumpster two blocks from Shawn Hagan's murder scene.</p>
<p>.22 liber?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Nice. Same as the bullet.</p>
<p>Did you run ballistics?</p>
<p>Oh, I will. But it's got a serial number.</p>
<p>Guess who it's registered to.</p>
<p>Ballistics confirms your gun fired the bullet that killed Shawn Hagan.</p>
<p>This gun hasn't been in my possession for years.</p>
<p>So, what, you misplaced it?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I gave it to Ryan Morton. It was a gift.</p>
<p>Can you prove that?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Have you found him yet?</p>
<p>We got a broadcast out. And he'll turn up.</p>
<p>Hagan said he found him.</p>
<p>Here's what I think happened.</p>
<p>I think Hagan told you he found Ryan in Las Vegas, but then he decided he wanted more money than you agreed upon for delivery.</p>
<p>So you arranged to meet Hagan in his car, but you weren't gonna be jerked around anymore.</p>
<p>That's why you decided to bring your gun.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>There's a struggle. He grabs the gun, and bam!</p>
<p>I had nothing to do with that!</p>
<p>We understand that sometimes things just get out of control.</p>
<p>But you need to be truthful.</p>
<p>If you did not intend to shoot him...</p>
<p>I did not shoot him!</p>
<p>Then you tell me what happened.</p>
<p>Look, I t Ryan... at a tennis club in Tahoe.</p>
<p>He grew up in Tonopah not far from where I did.</p>
<p>He was developing a lot of real estate.</p>
<p>He was very ambitious.</p>
<p>I lost my boy years ago in a divorce, and Ryan told me that his father had abandoned his family before he was born.</p>
<p>I gave him theun for his birthday.</p>
<p>And then he got you to give him some real money.</p>
<p>He said he needed a completion loan for a house he was gonna flip.</p>
<p>175000.</p>
<p>And I find out one day he left town.</p>
<p>Didn't even have a title to the house.</p>
<p>Why didn't you go to the police?</p>
<p>I'm a cardiac surgeon.</p>
<p>My patients, my staff-- they have to have confidence in my judgment.</p>
<p>If they'd heard that I've been played like a rube...</p>
<p>Do you wear contact lenses?</p>
<p>Yes. Why?</p>
<p>DNA sample. I'm gonna need one.</p>
<p>Take whatever you need.</p>
<p>Ray, excuse me. Could you come in here for a minute? You need to see this.</p>
<p>It's a person of interest in that motel murder I was working on.</p>
<p>That looks like my 419, Carsten Pennington.</p>
<p>It is. And it isn't.</p>
<p>Hey, do either one of you recognize this guy-- Ryan Morton?</p>
<p>Hey, Nick.</p>
<p>Yeah?</p>
<p>The DNA from the doctor didn't match the sample from the contact lens, and then CODIS drew a blank, so just to be thorough, I ran it against all the other case profiles.</p>
<p>And you got a match?</p>
<p>I got a sibling match.</p>
<p>That contact lens DNA had seven alleles in common with Carsten Pennington.</p>
<p>AKA Tripp Linson.</p>
<p>AKA Ryan Morton. He's got a brother.</p>
<p>Who just might be our killer.</p>
<p>Gareth Morton? The brher's name is Gareth?</p>
<p>Yes, like the cat.</p>
<p>And the tortoise.</p>
<p>And the dog.</p>
<p>Some people. It's no surprise when they end up dead.</p>
<p>We checked the local records in Tonopah.</p>
<p>Ryan and Gareth Morton own a house that was left to them by their mother.</p>
<p>We tried to contact Gareth there. No answer.</p>
<p>Local PD couldn't find him.</p>
<p>I had Archie go back over the surveillance at Carsten's cocktail party and guess what?</p>
<p>We found Gareth.</p>
<p><em>******</em></p>
<p>That places Gareth in Las Vegas the night of Carsten's murder.</p>
<p>Okay. Quick timeline...</p>
<p>Jena Mackin sees her old flame Tripp in a Vegas magazine.</p>
<p>She makes a last-ditch attempt for love.</p>
<p>She finds Tripp and throws herself at him.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he's not Tripp anymore.</p>
<p>He's Carsten Pennington, art dealer, living in a rented mansion, so he claims he doesn't recognize her.</p>
<p>And Jena goes back to the motel and blows her brains out.</p>
<p>A day later, a PI tracking down real estate fraudster Ryan Morton meets his brother Gareth and probably by accident, Gareth kills the PI in his car.</p>
<p>Then, later that night, Gareth shows up at Carsten's party-- uninvited, no doubt-- smashes his head in, dumps him in the pool.</p>
<p>And brother Gareth's in the wind.</p>
<p>His description's out on broadcast.</p>
<p>But right now, that's about all we can do.</p>
<p>If he's smart, he's not in the country.</p>
<p>Apparently, he's not that smart.</p>
<p>Speeding, Gareth, is a crime.</p>
<p>And when you have a bench warrant for a couple unpaid parking tickets, thatets you a couple of days lockup in Pahrump.</p>
<p>What do you think this gets you?</p>
<p>Check this out. Look closely.</p>
<p>That's your contact lens.</p>
<p>That's your DNA on a dead guy.</p>
<p>Want to tell me how it got there?</p>
<p>Hagan came to see me in Tonopah, four days ago.</p>
<p>He slapped me.</p>
<p>Now, why would he go and do a mean thing like that?</p>
<p>'Cause he wanted 175K that Ryan stole from his client.</p>
<p>I told Hagan I hadn't heard from Ryan in years.</p>
<p>That his debts weren't my problem.</p>
<p>And he said, oh, well, they were now because Ma left him half of the house.</p>
<p>They put a lien on it.</p>
<p>He told me that Ryan was living in Vegas under the name Carsten Pennington and he was living in a mansion and rolling in dough.</p>
<p>So there you are, sitting up in a shack in Tonopah, in a house you don't even own free and clear because of your brother and Mr. Hagan.</p>
<p>That must have chapped your ass, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah, that house should have been mine.</p>
<p>31 years I lived in that house with Ma.</p>
<p>Hauled her to church, to the beauty parlor, even changed her diapers in the end.</p>
<p>And all she ever talked about was Ryan.</p>
<p>Sure, okay. So you left for Vegas, you know, with the Mom always loved you best rage, right?</p>
<p>Then what? You found Hagan and killed him?</p>
<p>I didn't kill Hagan.</p>
<p>Look, I went tsee Ryan.</p>
<p>I hung outside his-his party until all the other guests had left, and then I asked him to quitclaim the house to me.</p>
<p>Why the hell should I?</p>
<p>Mom wanted me to have half. I'm not gonna deny her dying wish.</p>
<p>You never gave a rat's ass about her.</p>
<p>Every-Every birthday, every Christmas she was waiting for a card or a phone call or something.</p>
<p>And never, not one word from you.</p>
<p>And still, you were all she was thinking about.</p>
<p>So I'm supposed to feel guilty because you decided to chain yourself to that sadistic bitch?</p>
<p>After all the things she did to us?</p>
<p>You want to know why I was her favorite?</p>
<p>Because I had the guts to get out. To live my own life.</p>
<p>Hell, I've lived five lives.</p>
<p>You didn't have the guts to live one.</p>
<p>Then what?</p>
<p>And then... left.</p>
<p>You left? You just walked away? Why?</p>
<p>Because he was right about me-- I'm weak.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>When we were growing up, you know, all the kids in the neighborhood crowded around him, and...</p>
<p>I just faded into his shadow.</p>
<p>He had this charisma.</p>
<p>He was electric.</p>
<p>And even after all this went down, I still...</p>
<p>I still loved him.</p>
<p>I just didn't have the courage to tell him.</p>
<p>Isn't this sweet?</p>
<p>He drives Mommy's old Cutlass to go commit murder.</p>
<p>Okay, this is everything Gareth had on him or with him at the time he was arrested.</p>
<p>One contact lens missing.</p>
<p>That's bad news for Gareth.</p>
<p>What do we have here?</p>
<p>This is about a hundred grand.</p>
<p>Maybe he figures a car trunk is safer than a 401(k).</p>
<p>These days, he's probably right.</p>
<p>These are Burberrys.</p>
<p>Everything else here is from Dempsey's bargain basement.</p>
<p>What's a half-broke kid from Tonopah doing in a $50 pair underwear?</p>
<p>I think I can answer that.</p>
<p>Because the body we fished out of Carsten Pennington's pool was wearing Dempsey's underwear.</p>
<p>We found a hundred grand in your car.</p>
<p>Ryan gave it to me.</p>
<p>Why didn't you tell us about it?</p>
<p>Taxes.</p>
<p>I didn't want to pay taxes on it.</p>
<p>I'm sure Ryan didn't.</p>
<p>Ryan wouldn't sign a quitclaim for the house, and he gives you $100,000 free and clear?</p>
<p>That sounds a tad inconsistent.</p>
<p>Look, I don't pretend to understand my brother. All right?</p>
<p>But why-why would I kill him when he gave me that money?</p>
<p>Look, all brothers fight. I threw my brother through a screen door.</p>
<p>He broke a bowl of oatmeal on my head.</p>
<p>But I can't imagine killing him.</p>
<p>So, help me understand.</p>
<p>I think this thing started in the house in Tonopah, and ended in that swimming pool.</p>
<p>He's going to go down for this, Darcy.</p>
<p>The only question is, are you going to go down with him?</p>
<p>I were you, I would take a hard look at that bimbo of his.</p>
<p>What's her name, Darcy?</p>
<p>When Ryan gave me the cash, she freaked out.</p>
<p>She was really pissed and there was murder in her eyes.</p>
<p>You guys should check her out.</p>
<p>That's not Gareth. It's Carsten.</p>
<p>Every Christmas and birthday she'd wait for a card or a phone call, something.</p>
<p>Not one word, ever. And still... you were all she thought about at the end.</p>
<p>I said shut up!</p>
<p>Carsten?</p>
<p>He said that Gareth threatened to kill us both.</p>
<p>That there was no other way out.</p>
<p>He took Gareth's identity and said he'd come back for me.</p>
<p>And I believed him.</p>
<p>It's not true what my brother says about me.</p>
<p>I tried to make amends, but he wouldn't let me.</p>
<p>Here, Ma. I want you to have this.</p>
<p>Ryan, I can't.</p>
<p>What theell ishat?</p>
<p>We don't need your help.</p>
<p>We're getting by just fine.</p>
<p>What, on your-your lousy, uh, $450 a week?</p>
<p>You're lky Mom's here, or I'd...</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Boys, don't fight.</p>
<p>You haven't changed a bit.</p>
<p>Don't forget your money. You need it more than us. It's the, uh... only thing you ever loved.</p>
<p>That is so... sad.</p>
<p>What old movie did you steal it from?</p>
<p>Well, you're just one lie wrapped in another, huh?</p>
<p>It's the truth. I swear to God.</p>
<p>Even if it never happened.</p>

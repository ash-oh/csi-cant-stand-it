<p>WHITE FLASH TO:</p>
<p>[INT. LAS VEGAS MAGIC SHOW - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(ZEPHYR walks out on stage, pulls out two show swords from a rack. He holds them up. His assistant presents him.)</p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO:</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Overhead view of a large intersection on the strip taped in high-speed showing cars traveling at the intersection.)</p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO:</p>
<p>[INT. LAS VEGAS MAGIC SHOW - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(ZEPHYR is on stage holding up the two swords in front of a large glass case. Cut to a scene of the audience clapping.)</p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO:</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT</p>
<p>(Close up of an overhead view of a large intersection on the strip taped in high-speed showing cars traveling at the intersection.)</p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. LAS VEGAS MAGIC SHOW - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Back to ZEPHYR on stage. He holds up the two swords and hits them against each other to show that they're real.)</p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO:</p>
<p>(ZEPHYR on stage looks out on the audience.)</p>
<p><strong>Zephyr</strong>: I need one volunteer from the audience.</p>
<p><strong>Audience (woman)</strong>: Here! Here!</p>
<p>(The assistant looks out into the audience looking for a volunteer. ZEPHYR points to someone.)</p>
<p><strong>Zephyr</strong>: You. In the blue dress.</p>
<p>(Sitting in the audience with her head slightly turned away from the stage is a red-haired woman in a dark blue dress. She's sitting in the seat nearest the aisle.)</p>
<p>(She turns around, looks around and stands. She walks to the stage as the audience applauds. The assistant escorts the woman volunteer up onto the stage. She opens the glass chamber door. ZEPHYR puts one of the swords he's carrying forcibly back into the piece of wood.)</p>
<p><strong>Zephyr</strong>: Step into the box. Hands by your sides. Don't move.</p>
<p>(The woman steps into the chamber. The assistant closes the chamber door and it starts to fill with a white cloud of gas.)</p>
<p>(ZEPHYR puts the sword he's carrying through the slots in the chamber. The audience gasps. He moves to get another sword. He walks to the other side of the chamber and puts a sword through the slots. The audience gasps.)</p>
<p>(The Magician's Assistant hands the final sword to ZEPHYR. He takes the sword and plunges it through the slot in the side of the chamber facing the audience. The sword meets some resistance, but he forces it through. The audience gasps.)</p>
<p>(ZEPHYR turns around, stretches his arms and presents the chamber. The audience applauds. The gas dissipates inside the chamber revealing that it's completely empty.)</p>
<p><strong>Zephyr</strong>: And ladies and gentleman I assure you she's quite all right. In fact, she's ... spotlight, please.</p>
<p>(The magician's assistant walks through the audience and stops next to a seat. She presents the seat where the woman should be just as the spotlight hits the seat.)</p>
<p>(It's empty.)</p>
<p>(The assistant looks around. ZEPHYR himself starts looking around the stage. He walks around the chamber to the front of the stage where his assistant meets with him.)</p>
<p><strong>Matilda</strong>: (whispering): I don't know where she is.</p>
<p>(ZEPHYR looks out into the audience. He takes off his mask and addresses them.)</p>
<p><strong>Zephyr</strong>: Ladies and gentlemen ... I can't quite explain ... </p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO:</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<hr />
[INT. CASINO - MAGIC SHOW - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Grissom enters the auditorium carrying his kit. He walks toward the stage where BRASS is waiting on the steps.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Welcome to the house of illusion. This is bizarre. You're not going to believe this. Female volunteer goes on the stage, disappears and doesn't come back.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Was she supposed to ... reappear?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The Amazing Zephyr won't say. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM climbs onto the stage and approaches the glass case with the three swords still in it.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know magicians, they never reveal their tricks, but we're working on him.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks closely at the swords in the chamber.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, I can understand why he doesn't want to reveal his trick ... but would he like to explain this blood?</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS HOTEL &amp; CASINO (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<hr />
[INT. LAS VEGAS HOTEL &amp; CASINO - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(BRASS fills GRISSOM in on what they've discovered in their initial investigation.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I got a bunch of police officers, uh canvassing the theater right now. No sign yet, but we have traced the woman back to her aisle seat, 8A. Paid cash.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Magic is fun, Jim, but it's not real. The woman is somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Thanks for that. Thanks.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM leaves BRASS. A tourist being detained by the police approaches BRASS.)</p>
<p><strong>Tourist (woman)</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah? </p>
<p><strong>Tourist (woman)</strong>: Um, hi, are we finished here?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No. You were sitting in front of the volunteer, is that right?</p>
<p><strong>Tourist (woman)</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You take any photos during the show?</p>
<p><strong>Tourist (woman)</strong>: Uh ...</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We're going to need your camera.</p>
<p><strong>Tourist (woman)</strong>: But our whole trip's on there.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We'll get the negatives back to you. (to the officer behind them)<br />
Michael. (to the tourist woman) Excuse me. Thanks for your help.</p>
<p>(BRASS leaves the tourist couple to the other officer.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. LAS VEGAS HOTEL &amp; CASINO - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Up on stage, SARA is examining the swords from the glass chamber. She pulls one out just as GRISSOM arrives to check it out. He checks the edge of the sword.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Dull as a spoon. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: From a distance, it looks razor-sharp.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's the point. So is it real blood?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, let's see. </p>
<p>(SARA checks.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: That's real blood, all right.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. LAS VEGAS HOTEL &amp; CASINO - BACK STAGE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(ZEPHYR is taking off his make-up in his dressing room. GRISSOM is there questioning him.)</p>
<p><strong>Zephyr</strong>: Nothing is as it seems, is it?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's the conflict of magic -- the burden of knowledge versus the mystique of wonder. </p>
<p><strong>Zephyr</strong>: And you're wondering right now -- I can hear your mind ticking-- &quot;Was she a plant? Was it real?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, there are no secrets, are there? Only hidden answers.</p>
<p><strong>Zephyr</strong>: I'm an honest liar, sir. In my line of work it's accepted. You could say it was my livelihood.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, my livelihood is dispelling lies and finding the truth.</p>
<p>(ZEPHYR points to the box of tissues in front of GRISSOM. GRISSOM pulls out a tissue and hands it to ZEPHYR.)</p>
<p><strong>Zephyr</strong>: My secrets can't be revealed by any microscope.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah ... but there's a woman missing.</p>
<p>(ZEPHYR reaches behind GRISSOM'S right ear and pulls out a large coin. He shows it to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Zephyr</strong>: The only thing missing ... </p>
<p>(ZEPHYR holds the coin in the palm of his left hand and uses his right hand to elaborately grab the coin from his left hand. He holds it loosely in a fist, shakes it a couple of times and opens it to reveal that the coin is missing.)</p>
<p><strong>Zephyr</strong>: ... is this.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Very nice. So, where'd she go?</p>
<p><strong>Zephyr</strong>: From the salt in my marrow, I don't know. I mean, I can't give you this </p>
<p>(ZEPHYR holds out his empty right hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Zephyr</strong>: ... but I can give you... </p>
<p>(ZEPHYR looks back at his left hand holding the coin.)</p>
<p><strong>Zephyr</strong>: ... that. </p>
<p>(Amused, GRISSOM picks up the coin and looks at it. ZEPHYR resumes removing his make-up.)</p>
<p><strong>Zephyr</strong>: It's as real as my answer. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM hands the coin back to ZEPHYR.)</p>
<p><strong>Zephyr</strong>: No, you can keep it.</p>
<p>(ZEPHYR smiles.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. NEAR PARKED BUS -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and NICK make their way to the crime scene.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What's the name of the band again?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Pekinpah. Back in '93, first album was a moderate hit. Don't you remember that song, it was pretty popular-- uh... &quot;Symphony of Epiphanies&quot;? </p>
<p><strong>Both Humming</strong>: &quot;Na, na, na, na, na, na come here, come here... &quot;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, that was good to dance to.</p>
<p>(On the side is the ROAD MANAGER speaking with an officer.)</p>
<p><strong>Road Manager</strong>: (to the officer) He's been laying in the back of the bus for half an hour now.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (o.s. to NICK) I'm guessing that's the road manager.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and NICK continue to walk to the bus.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: He does not look too happy.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, he just lost a lead singer.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and NICK reach the bus. CATHERINE opens the trailer door.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. BUS - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE enters the bus first, her flashlight held out so she can see inside. NICK walks in behind her. On the chair inside the bus is an electric guitar.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Ooh ... rock and roll, baby.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks on to the back of the bus where GUS KENYON is dead on the bed with a needle sticking out of his right arm.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Gus Kenyon.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: It's a shame, man. He had a good voice.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE leans in to look at the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Heroin. If this was an overdose, why leave some in the syringe?</p>
<p>(NICK looks down at the floor around the bed.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No vomit around, either. That's a first for me.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE reaches out and notices something black-ish on the tip of GUS KENYON'S right index finger.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Wait a second, what's this? Doesn't look like a bruise.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: How'd he do that?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What's that?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: The tourniquet. He's obviously left-handed if he shot up in the right arm. If he tied it off himself he would have pulled it towards him, like so. It's tied the other way, pulled away from him.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to someone tying the red tourniquet around a well-muscled bicep. Flash to white. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: By someone else standing over him?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE stands up and notices an empty BR Black Rush irish whiskey bottle next to the bed. She picks it up.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Easy ... if you're capacitated.</p>
<p>(Behind them, the manager of the band walks into the bus. He yells out from the doorway to them.)</p>
<p><strong>Manager</strong>: You people seen enough? When can I put him to rest?</p>
<p>(NICK warns the manager.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You really shouldn't be in here, sir.</p>
<p>(The manager takes a few more steps into the bus.)</p>
<p><strong>Manager</strong>: Hey, look, I'm sorry. You know, this is a tragedy for all of us, and his family. I just don't want the press to see him like this.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We understand that, sir, but this is a crime scene.</p>
<p><strong>Manager</strong>: Crime scene? It's an O.D., Right? He killed himself.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Then you knew he was a drug user?</p>
<p><strong>Manager</strong>: Well, he was a drug user. I mean, he's been clean for a long time. A health freak, actually. It's a shock to us all.</p>
<p>(Camera holds on CATHERINE.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. THEATRE - ON STAGE]</p>
<p>(WARRICK and SARA continue to process the glass box.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Big glass box and all I got is a partial thumb print.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks up to them and looks at the box.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Is this processed yet?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah. Want me to bag it for you?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Let's take it back to the lab. Maybe we can make Greg disappear.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Who controls this stage, do we know?</p>
<p><strong>Punky Dillinger</strong>: (o.s.) I do.</p>
<p>(They all turn toward the voice coming from behind them. Off to the side of the stage, a young man appears.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And you are ... ?</p>
<p><strong>Punky Dillinger</strong>: Punky Dillinger. I'm Zephyr's stagehand.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, Mr. Dillinger do you know how this trick works?</p>
<p><strong>Punky Dillinger</strong>: I only control the stage part.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at PUNKY DILLINGER without responding. He doesn't believe it for a moment.)</p>
<p><strong>Punky Dillinger</strong>: (relents) Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Good. Make me disappear.</p>
<p>(SARA and WARRICK who had been doing their own thing in the background, suddenly look up at GRISSOM. PUNKY DILLINGER laughs.)</p>
<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO:<br />
(GRISSOM is standing inside the glass box. The lights inside the box flash several times and with a hiss, a white cloud fills the box, slowly obscuring GRISSOM from SARA and WARRICK who watch from the audience aisle.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (waving) Bye-bye.</p>
<p>(The white cloud fills the box. The lights inside the box continue to flash. The cloud slowly dissipates and the lights stop flashing. The box is empty.)</p>
<p>(SARA and WARRICK look at each other for a moment. They both approach the stage to look for GRISSOM. SARA looks a big perplexed. WARRICK looks down and sees it. He walks to the side of the box. SARA follows him.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Oh, I get it. There's a chute inside the steps.</p>
<p>(WARRICK pushes the steps leading to the box aside. GRISSOM looks up at them from under the stage.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Still here.</p>
<p>(Camera cuts to SARA and WARRICK look down at GRISSOM from the stage above.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. THEATRE - UNDER THE STAGE - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Everyone is under the stage looking around. PUNKY DILLINGER shows them around the place while explaining how the trick works in the show.)</p>
<p><strong>Punky Dillinger</strong>: At this point of the trick, I'm supposed to escort the volunteer out of the basement. Now I only turned my back for a second and she was gone.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Is there any other way out of here besides that door?</p>
<p><strong>Punky Dillinger</strong>: No, that's the thing. Stage left's the only exit. I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You have any lights in here besides red? We're looking for blood.</p>
<p>(SARA and WARRICK start looking around and walking in separate directions.)</p>
<p><strong>Punky Dillinger</strong>: Mm-hmm. </p>
<p>(PUNKY DILLINGER reaches up above him and turns on the lights. He notices that SARA is almost to the end of the aisle where there's a locked wire cage.)</p>
<p><strong>Punky Dillinger</strong>: Oh, hey? Hey?! Those are Zephyr's tricks in the corner. No one's allowed to go near them not even me.</p>
<p>(For a moment, SARA has her hand on the cage door. They all look at PUNKY.)</p>
<p>(Cut to SARA and WARRICK continuing to examine the area by the cage. SARA is looking inside the cage from the outside and WARRICK is examining the ground. He kneels down when he finds something.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I've got ovoid blood drops leading towards the wall.</p>
<p><strong>Punky Dillinger</strong>: You guys want more lights?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No. Turn them off. </p>
<p>(PUNKY turns the lights off. Using their flashlights, the team follows the blood trail. They follow the trail around a stack of crates, directly to a second door.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. BACK STAGE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The door opens and GRISSOM walks out onto the catwalk. WARRICK follows.)</p>
<p>(Cut to SARA as she stays behind and examines the door and door frame.)</p>
<p>(Cut back to GRISSOM following the blood trail through the catwalk.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Magicians of Zephyr's caliber belong to a very secluded society. They barnstorm from city to city ... no contact with the outside world, no association with other magicians. They're like ghosts with skin.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and WARRICK walk down the stairs and to the loading zone below. At the bottom of the steps, GRISSOM finds something. WARRICK walks down to the road level loading zone and examines the ground.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This looks like an admixture of blood and some sort of clear liquid.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Someone bolted out of here pretty fast.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM raises his flashlight to look at what WARRICK is talking about.)</p>
<p>(Cut to SARA dusting the door and lifting a print from the door. She looks at the clear print she has on the sheet.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (to herself) I'm no psychic, but I have been known to read palms.</p>
<p>(She smiles and yells out.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey! </p>
<p>(Cut to outside where WARRICK and GRISSOM look up when they hear SARA yell.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (o.s.) I got a print.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and DR. ROBBINS stand around the deceased on the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You're kidding me.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Nope. No heroin in his system. Lots of bourbon, but no heroin at all.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So what killed him?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Embolism to the heart.</p>

<p>(With the piece of finger tip that GRISSOM cut off from the body, he pulls the bone out of the skin casing. He places the skin shell on his own right hand pinky finger. He then proceeds to take a fingerprint of the body they have down at the morgue. He rolls the finger tip onto an ink pad and rolls it again on a piece of paper.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - PRINT LAB]</p>
<p>(Close up of the computer screen. The finger print they're matching appears on the right with identifiers. It runs it against the prints in the database and a match is found immediately.)</p>
<p>(The computer screen reads: &quot;PRINT MATCH: PUNKY DILLINGER&quot; which is a direct match to the reference print.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He fooled us. It was Punky burning in that box. Zephyr murdered his son.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: The little boy from the picture.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: They pulled a switch.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback as one masked man in black walks away from the stage and past another masked man in black walking back on stage.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM tosses the coin up and catches it. He holds it out for SARA and WARRICK to see. He flips it over so that they can see both sides of the coin.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: See this coin?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It's two-headed.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Two heads as one. One and the same. Zephyr and his son are interchangeable in physical appearance like the IO moth. You know what that means? </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Zephyr's still out there.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So, if you're a master of deception where do you hide? </p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns his head to SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Or do you?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<hr />
[INT. ZOE CLEIN'S RESIDENCE - HIDDEN ROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks cautiously down the spiral staircase. His flashlight the only light in the dark room. He reaches the bottom and looks around the room. He sighs and looks around some more. He sees it.)</p>
<p>(On the ground under the window, he sees the hook broken. It's a curious sight. He walks over to it and picks it up. He looks at it carefully and definitely recognizes it.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to GRISSOM grabbing on to the wall hook to hoist himself up to the window sill to look at the IO moth. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at the hook. He looks at the wall. He tries to match the hook to it's place on the wall, but doesn't find it. He looks at the large wall in front of him from side to top and makes an amazing assessment.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I think this room is shrinking.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM places his two hands flat against the wall and starts to push the wall back. With some effort, the entire wall moves slightly back. As it does, a doorway appears on his right.)</p>
<p>(Another hidden passage.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. ZOE CLEIN'S RESIDENCE - HIDDEN PASSAGEWAY- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks through the passageway. It's a corridor that leads him to another lit room. He turns the corner and sees ZEPHYR sitting at the far table working on something, his back to the doorway.)</p>
<p>[INT. ZOE CLEIN'S RESIDENCE - HIDDEN ROOM 2 - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p><strong>Zephyr</strong>: Nothing is what it seems. But I fooled them all. Even that ungrateful masochist.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to the night of ZOE CLEIN'S purported disappearance.)</p>
<p>&quot;ZEPHYR&quot;: (o.s.) You, in the blue dress.</p>
<p>(Cut to ZEPHYR in disguise, dressed in the blue dress, red wig and dark sunglasses, looking up and smiling.)</p>
<p>(Cut to TONY ARCANE sitting at the back table between two women.)</p>
<p><strong>Toby Arcane</strong>: Who's he kidding? That's a plant.</p>
<p><strong>Zephyr</strong>: (V.O.) His arrogance blinded his perception.</p>
<p>(Cut to the ZEPHYR in his disguise smiling and standing up to do the trick.)</p>
<p>(Cut back to TOBY ARCANE pointing and muttering.)</p>
<p><strong>Toby Arcane</strong>: That was a plant.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Zephyr</strong>: It-it's amazing what you can do with a stagehand and a masquerade mask. You know, not to mention a prop like a packet full of Zoe's blood. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback and close camera angle of the tip of the sword blade sliding through the glass box slots from the outside; then into the box where we see ZEPHYR lift up the blue dress where he has a packet of blood taped underneath. The sword then pierces through the packet to deliberately leave behind the blood evidence that was eventually found.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Zephyr</strong>: You know, lucky for me she let me have some before she mysteriously disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You made her disappear.</p>
<p>(ZEPHYR turns around to look at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Zephyr</strong>: No, I &quot;assumed&quot; her.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to the night of the trick. ZEPHYR jumps down through the trap door and starts removing his wig. He tosses it aside. He tears off the dress. He tosses that aside also. All the while on the move. Cut to one masked man in black walking away from the stage and past another masked man in black walking back on stage. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Zephyr</strong>: (proudly) Quick-change artistry. A magical transformation. With a good seamstress and some velcro, you ...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (interrupting) We know that you switched with your son, Punky to set up Toby Arcane for your murder. That trick didn't work so well, did it?</p>
<p><strong>Zephyr</strong>: (confesses and sounding slightly disappointed) Not as planned. And your finding me here has thwarted my transmutation. </p>
<p>(He turns to GRISSOM and smiles.)</p>
<p><strong>Zephyr</strong>: Abracadabra.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: &quot;Abracadabra&quot;. That's a cabalistic charm said to be made up from three Hebrew words meaning, father, son and the holy spirit. You're the father who took his son's life ... so that you could disappear and become the holy spirit?</p>
<p><strong>Zephyr</strong>: No. </p>
<p>(ZEPHYR stands and walks to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Zephyr</strong>: From caterpillar to cocoon. From cocoon ... </p>
<p>(ZEPHYR reaches out and grabs something from GRISSOM. It's a magic trick, but instead of the coin, he reveals the IO moth.)</p>
<p><strong>Zephyr</strong>: ... to moth. And from moth ... </p>
<p>(ZEPHYR puts the moth in his hand and shakes it. He tips his closed fist over and a stream of gold glitter pours out.)</p>
<p><strong>Zephyr</strong>: ... to dust.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM is unamused and doesn't crack a smile. ZEPHYR finds his trick humorous and smiles. He even chuckles slightly.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Your son aspired to be a great magician, didn't he?</p>
<p><strong>Zephyr</strong>: Yeah, but he served better as a prop.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You're about to be arrested for his murder.</p>
<p><strong>Zephyr</strong>: You don't want to know how I did that trick?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No. Magicians shouldn't reveal their tricks.</p>
<p><strong>Zephyr</strong>: And they say, they save their best trick for last.</p>
<p>(And with that, ZEPHYR smiles.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. ZOE CLEIN'S RESIDENCE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(ZEPHYR is handcuffed behind his back and being escorted by an officer to the waiting car. GRISSOM rushes to catch up to the pair. He's putting on a pair of latex gloves.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Officer? </p>
<p>(GRISSOM catches up to the pair.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Officer, wait a minute. Turn him around, please. </p>
<p>(ZEPHYR turns around. He looks at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Open your mouth, please.</p>
<p>(ZEPHYR opens his mouth. GRISSOM uses his flashlight and checks ZEPHYR'S mouth. He checks thoroughly. He finds nothing.)</p>
<p><strong>Zephyr</strong>: Satisfied?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(ZEPHYR looks at GRISSOM and nods slightly. He turns around and goes into the police car. GRISSOM watches as the car door is closed. He takes off his latex gloves and turns away as the car drives off.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Sitting in the back seat of the car, ZEPHYR makes a face. He works his throat muscles and swallows several times. He continues to work the muscles in his upper chest area.)</p>
<p>(After a moment, ZEPHYR opens his mouth and exposes a black key sitting on his tongue.)</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>

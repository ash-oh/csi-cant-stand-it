<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>XCU: THE TIP OF A KNIFE AS IT CUTS THROUGH A STITCH</p>
<p>(The same knife tip pulls the thread through the material. Another stitch is cut.) </p>
<p>REVEAL – SARA</p>
<p>Sara sits in the dark locker room as she works on removing the stitching.</p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[EXT. WLVU – COURTYARD – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The campus courtyard is crowded with people headed toward the dorms. Loud music plays.) </p>
<p>PULL BACK INTO – </p>
<p>[INT. DORM ROOM – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The party is in progress, music blares and the frat boys with plastic cups in their hands chant loudly.) </p>
<p><strong>Frat Boys</strong>: (shouting) Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!</p>
<p>(The boys are in their dorm room cheering another boy standing on his head on a keg and drinking beer.) </p>
<p><strong>Frat Boys</strong>: (shouting) Yeah! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink!</p>
<p>(The chanting continues. The frat boy standing on his head has his sneakered feet up against the ceiling. He stomps his foot in time to the chanting.) </p>
<p><strong>Frat Boys</strong>: (shouting) Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink! Drink ... !</p>
<p>(CAMERA MOVES UP THROUGH THE CEILING and up into the dorm room just above where three frat boys are standing up with their heads lifted toward the ceiling. They're listening to a woman moaning in ecstasy and the rhythmic creaking of old bedsprings.)</p>
<p>(CAMERA CONTINUES TO MOVE UP THROUGH THE CEILING and into the dorm room just above where the lights are dimmed and two bodies are under the bedsheet. The woman moans and giggles.)</p>
<p>(The man lies back on the bed. The woman rests on him.) </p>
<p>PUSH FORWARD through the open window where a girl FALLS fast</p>
<p>FADE TO:</p>
<p>[EXT. WLVU CAMPUS -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(VARIOUS CAMERA FLASHES of the dead girl on the concrete in a pool of blood.) </p>
<p>(Police car lights flash, sirens blurb on and off. The place is now a crime scene, cordoned off with a large crowd of college students gathered around.) </p>
<p>(Catherine takes photos of the girl on the ground. David Phillips looks at her.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Sorry, no ID.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It's okay. Brass has a line on the resident director.</p>
<p><strong>Monica</strong>: (o.s.) Lanie! Oh, my God, no!</p>
<p>(Catherine looks up and sees a woman on the outside of the tape crying. She struggles against the police officer who tries to keep her there.) </p>
<p><strong>Monica</strong>: My God, Lanie, I can't believe it. You really did it.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey! Let her on through.</p>
<p>(The officer lets Monica through. Monica ducks under the tape and runs toward the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Lanie</strong>: Monica!</p>
<p>(A second woman runs under the tape.) </p>
<p><strong>Monica</strong>: Lanie! Don't you ever die on me! Promise!</p>
<p><strong>Lanie</strong>: I won't. I promise.</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Okay, come on.</p>
<p>(The officer leads both Monica and Lanie back behind the tape.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: It's the third jumper on campus this year. Maybe it's contagious.</p>
<p>(Catherine takes a photo of something in the blood.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I saw this documentary once on suicides off the Golden Gate Bridge, and they interviewed a survivor and he said the moment that he let go of the railing, he realized that all of his problems were fixable, except for having jumped.</p>
<p>FADE TO: </p>
<p>[INT. DORM ROOM – STAIRS TO ROOF]</p>
<p>(Nick tries the door and finds it locked.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (to radio) Hey, Catherine.</p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[EXT. WLVU CAMPUS -- NIGHT] </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to radio) Uh, yeah, Nicky, what you got?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (to radio) Chains and padlocks. There's no roof access from the dorm.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to radio) Well, the body landed close to the building, so if she didn't come from the roof, she must have come out of a room.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (to radio) Okay, I'll work my way down.</p>
<p>(Nick starts to head down the stairs.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (over radio) Nick, you in the dorm?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (to radio) That's affirmative.</p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[EXT. WLVU CAMPUS -- NIGHT] </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (to radio) I'm with the resident director. He's ID'd the victim as Kira Dellinger. She's in Room 807. She's a freshman from McLean, Virginia. I guess I'm going to go notify the parents.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (from radio) Perks of the job.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (grimly) Yeah.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. DORM ROOM 807 – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The door opens and Nick enters the room. He looks around and puts his kit down. It's a typical dorm room – photos on the bulletin board, posters on the wall. The bed is nearly made.) </p>
<p>(Nick tries the window and finds it open. He looks out the window and sees the body down below. He waves to Catherine. Catherine waves back.) </p>
<p>(Nick examines the window and finds some blood and fibers on a screw.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (to radio) Hey, Catherine, do you see any wounds on the body inconsistent with the fall?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hang on.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Well, there's this. </p>
<p>(David shows Catherine the wound.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to phone) Yeah, there's a long perimortem abrasion on the lower back.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (to radio) I think I know how it got there.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Kira struggles with someone who pushes her backward out the window. She rips her dress against the screw sticking out of the window.) </p>
<p><strong>Kira Dellinger</strong>: No!</p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (to radio) Drag 'n' drop.</p>
<p>SMASH TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[SARA WALKING] </p>
<p>MUSIC: &quot;Carousel&quot; by Iron &amp; Wine</p>
<p>(Sara is listening to music as she walks. The background around her is black – isolated in her own world.) </p>
<p>FADE IN: BACKGROUND</p>
<p>[INT. CSI – HALLWAY / LOCKER ROOM – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Sara opens the locker room door and promptly bumps into Warrick, who is on his way out. He drops a prescription pill bottle and her pager on the floor.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Oh, ooh!</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Oh ...</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Ooh, where's the fire? </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (sighs) Oh, sorry.</p>
<p>(She kneels and picks up the bottle and pager for him.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: &quot;Zopidem&quot;? That's good stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, it's to help me sleep. I've been having the hardest time lately.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Me, too.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, just coming off of grave after all these years, you know, takes a while to adjust. (He rubs her shoulder.) You're a tough cookie. I'm not worried about you. Take care of yourself, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(He leaves. Sara turns around.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Sweet dreams.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (o.s.) Thank you.</p>
<p>(Sara looks down and sees some blood on the tips of her shoes.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Oh ...</p>
<p>(She sits down on the locker bench. Ronnie appears in the doorway.) </p>
<p><strong>Ronnie</strong>: Hey. Sara, you done with your scene?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Ronnie</strong>: Great, because we just caught another one: 425 off Craig Road.</p>
<p>(Sara nods. She doesn't look as thrilled as Ronnie does.) </p>
<p><strong>Ronnie</strong>: Busy shift, but you know I like that. I'll see you outside, okay?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(Ronnie leaves.) </p>
<p>(Sara removes her shoes and puts them in the trash bin.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) – MORNING]</p>
<p>[EXT/INT. JIMINEZ RESIDENCE – MORNING]</p>
<p>(Ronnie and Sara walk up the front porch toward the officer standing in front of the open door.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What do you got? </p>
<p><strong>Officer Akers</strong>: Neighbors called in a domestic disturbance between Adam and Kim Jimenez. I responded, knocked and didn't get any answer, so I looked through the window, and this is what I saw. Nobody's home, so I called you guys.</p>
<p>(From where they stand, the room is trashed and there's blood on the floor.) </p>
<p>(Sara looks at Ronnie, who nods.) </p>
<p>(Sara pushes the door open and steps inside the house. She takes her dark glasses off and starts following the blood on the floor.) </p>
<p>(The inside of the house is dark. They look around.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Blood but no body. No sign of the couple.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Akers</strong>: No. Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Lots of blood activity here.</p>
<p>(Sara puts her kit down. Ronnie looks around.) </p>
<p><strong>Ronnie</strong>: Then someone ran out the door.</p>
<p>(A disheveled woman appears at the door. She walks inside. Officer Akers takes his gun out, surprising both Sara and Ronnie.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer Akers</strong>: Stop right there. Hands where I can see 'em.</p>
<p>(The woman holds her hands up. She appears disoriented.) </p>
<p><strong>Kim Jiminez</strong>: This is my house.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Mrs. Jimenez?</p>
<p>(The woman nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Where have you been?</p>
<p><strong>Kim Jiminez</strong>: My husband and I had an argument. I went on a walk.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Where's your husband now?</p>
<p>(Officer Akers continues to hold his gun on her.) </p>
<p><strong>Kim Jiminez</strong>: I, uh ... I don't know.</p>
<p>(Ronnie finds blood on Kim Jiminez's pants.) </p>
<p><strong>Ronnie</strong>: Mrs. Jimenez, are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>Kim Jiminez</strong>: Bad back.</p>
<p>(Ronnie finds a knife sticking out of Kim Jimenez's back.) </p>
<p><strong>Ronnie</strong>: Sara, she's got a very bad back. (to radio) Dispatch, this is CSI Lake. We need paramedics right away on location.</p>
<p>(Kim Jimenez turns around and Sara sees the knife. The sight affects Sara.) </p>
<p><strong>Dispatch</strong>: (from radio) Copy, CSI. Will notify.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Catherine snaps photos of Kira Dellinger's body on the table.) </p>
<p>(She finds something in Kira's hand, puts the camera down and picks up a magnifying glass to look at it. Robbins walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey. What do you think this might be?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Well, possibly a tooth fragment. High fall?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah. We think she was pushed. So, between her knuckles -- suggests a struggle?</p>
<p>(Catherine removes the fragment.) </p>
<p>(Quick flash to: [DORM ROOM] Kira struggles with someone. She punches him. The person grabs her hair and pulls her toward the window.) </p>
<p><strong>Kira</strong>: No!</p>
<p>(End flash.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Was she raped?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: There's no trauma, but the wet mount indicates that she definitely had s*x.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Oh, no condom. Good for us.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah. Such a scary thing, sending your kid off to college.</p>
<p>(Catherine takes more photos.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Is Lindsey looking already?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah. In fact, we looked at WLVU last month.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Well, at least she'd be close to home.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: She's free on campus, might as well be a thousand miles away.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. WLVU – DORM ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Nick has the fingerprint cards on the windowsill. He scans them with a hand-held device, then goes to the computer. Greg walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey. Any luck with dorm security? </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Nope. There's no cameras, only key cards, but according to the residence director, the door's propped open all the time anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(Nick has the prints in the computer. Greg looks around the dorm room.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Kind of hard to tell the difference between a struggle and a typical college dorm room.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah. You should have seen mine. It was really bad.</p>
<p>(Greg feels around under the bed and sifts through the clothes on the floor. He finds a white tee.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Hmm. &quot;X&quot; marks the girl. Symbol for a &quot;straight edge&quot; lifestyle. Abstinence from drugs, tobacco, alcohol ...</p>
<p>(He finds a tube of lubricant.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: ... but not s*x.</p>
<p>(He holds up the tube: PLEASURE MATE, Erotic Lubrication.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Sexual lubricant. Give me that.</p>
<p>(Greg hands Nick the lubricant.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: So, pretty brave for college.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, or just another way to get attention.</p>
<p>(Nick dusts the tube.) </p>
<p>(Greg looks at the photos on the bulletin board.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Looks like our vic was in a Goth band. You know, I used to be Goth.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yeah, the Goth thing was just an act. Chicks dug it.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: How does that work?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: You act depressed to get chicks, you get depressed chicks.</p>
<p>(Nick finds a print.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) – DAY] </p>
<p>[INT. JIMENEZ RESIDENCE – DAY]</p>
<p>(The paramedics tend to Kim Jimenez, binding her around the knife. Sara stands aside and watches.) </p>
<p><strong>Adam Jimenez</strong>: (o.s.) Just let me in.</p>
<p>(Adam Jimenez walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Adam Jimenez</strong>: Baby, are you okay?</p>
<p>(He walks up to Kim.) </p>
<p><strong>Adam Jimenez</strong>: Are you all right? You doing okay, huh? You all right? You okay? Yeah? Did you call these cops on me?</p>
<p><strong>Kim Jiminez</strong>: No ... No.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Jimenez</strong>: Huh? </p>
<p>(He puts a hand near her neck and starts choking her.) </p>
<p><strong>Adam Jimenez</strong>: (shouts) Did you call the cops on me?!</p>
<p>(Sara stares at them, completely out of it.)</p>
<p><strong>Kim Jiminez</strong>: (shouts) I didn't call the cops!</p>
<p>(SLOW MOTION. There's a commotion. Officer Ackers pushes Adam Jimenez away from Kim, who gets up. The officers pull Adam away from her. Ronnie pulls Kim away from him. Sara remains completely out of it as she watches.) </p>
<p>(Ronnie sits Kim down in the seat.) </p>
<p><strong>Ronnie</strong>: (no audio) (to Kim) It's okay now. (She looks at Sara) Sara?</p>
<p>(Sara heads out. Kim Jimenez is still shouting for the officers to let her husband go.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Why don't you finish up here?</p>
<p>(Ronnie starts after her.) </p>
<p><strong>Ronnie</strong>: Wait a minute. How are we going to handle this?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, the guy's under arrest.</p>
<p><strong>Ronnie</strong>: He'll be free by tomorrow. Her husband is obviously abusing her.<br />
(sighs) There's got to be something we can do.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We'll be back for her body next month. Or his. Or both. There is nothing you can do about this, Ronnie. Don't kid yourself.</p>
<p>(Sara heads out of the house.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Sara walks through the hallway. She stops at the doorway to Grissom's office and she smiles as she watches him work. He looks up and sees her. She smiles at him.) </p>
<p>(He waves to her, then motions for her to come inside.) </p>
<p>(She lingers on his desk nameplate.) </p>
<p>(Sara turns and leaves.) </p>
<p>(Grissom looks up and sees Sara gone.) </p>
<p>[INT. CSI – HALLWAY – DAY]</p>
<p>(Mandy finds Sara.) </p>
<p><strong>Mandy</strong>: Sara, I've got something really good on that defenestrated college kid.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Oh, that's Catherine's case. Or, you know what, talk to Nick.</p>
<p><strong>Mandy</strong>: No, no, no, you're really going to love this. A print on a lube tube matched a print on her windowsill. AFIS got a hit.</p>
<p>(Mandy shows the results to Sara.) </p>
<p><strong>Mandy</strong>: Ever think you'd see that guy again?</p>
<p>(Mandy leaves.) </p>
<p>CU: INFORMATION SHEET and photo on Marlon West.</p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
[Various Scenes from 6X18: Unusual Suspect]</p>
<p>(Marlon West is in his science class.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (V.O.) Marlon West was on trial for the murder of Stacy Vollmer.</p>
<p>(Stacy Vollmer is in the showers. She turns the knob and it explodes. She falls to the ground, dead.) </p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – LAYOUT ROOM – DAY]</p>
<p>(Grissom, Catherine, Nick and Sara stand around the layout table with the different photos on it.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: He confessed. It was later thrown out on a technicality. We really didn't need it. The prosecution's case against Marlon was very strong.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Until Marlon's little sister Hannah got on the stand and confessed to the murder herself.</p>
<p>FLASH TO: [Scene from 6X18: Unusual Suspect]</p>
<p>(Hannah West is on the stand.) </p>
<p><strong>Hannah West</strong>: Marlon didn't kill Stacy. I did. And I was wearing this when I did it.</p>
<p>(She unzips her jacket to show her stained t-shirt.) </p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
<strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, yes, I remember this case. A high school senior at age 12.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What do you mean exactly?</p>
<p><strong>Hannah West</strong>: (whispers) I didn't kill Stacy. Marlon did.</p>
<p>BACK TO SCENE.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: She claimed that she did it because she loved Marlon. Some warped sense of justice ... She graduated later that summer, became legally emancipated from her parents and went off to Harvard--pre-med.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You keeping tabs on her?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Not recently. Look, accident or no accident, Marlon killed before. Hannah sunk this case, Marlon got a free pass, and now he's killed again.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, we don't know that just yet. I mean, we don't have Marlon's DNA to compare with the semen that was found in the victim. All the old evidence was expunged with the verdict.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I want this case.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The one that got away?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We're not supposed to let them get away, right?</p>

<p><strong>Marlon West</strong>: What are you guys doing here?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We're here to talk to you about Kira Dellinger.</p>
<p><strong>Marlon West</strong>: Kira committed suicide.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Actually, she was murdered.</p>
<p><strong>Marlon West</strong>: Somebody I know ends up dead and I'm automatically a suspect?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: History has a way of repeating itself, Marlon. You've killed before, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Marlon West</strong>: That was an accident. And I admitted I was responsible from day one.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Kira was forced out her dorm window. Your prints were there.</p>
<p><strong>Marlon West</strong>: My prints were there because I've been in there a million times. Kira and I were in a band.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Your prints were also found on a tube of sexual lubricant. </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Were you having s*x with her, Marlon?</p>
<p><strong>Marlon West</strong>: Yeah, we were having s*x. </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Last night?</p>
<p><strong>Marlon West</strong>: No, we had a gig last night. We ... we got into a fight.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Did she give you that fat lip?</p>

<p><strong>Marlon West</strong>: Kira! Kira!</p>
<p>(He climbs down and rushes over to them.) </p>
<p><strong>Marlon West</strong>: Keep your hands off her!</p>
<p>(He pushes the boy away from her. The boy gets up and punches Marlon in the face.) </p>

<p><strong>Marlon West</strong>: I don't know who the guy was. I had never seen him before. After that, I just ... wandered the campus most of the night by myself.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So you don't have an alibi.</p>
<p><strong>Marlon West</strong>: I guess I don't.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, I'll tell you what. We will give you the benefit of the doubt in exchange for this.</p>
<p>(Sara takes out a swab.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You remember this.</p>
<p>(Hannah walks up to them.) </p>
<p><strong>Hannah West</strong>: I assume you have a DNA warrant, Sara. Because if you don't, you certainly don't have his consent. Isn't that right, Marlon?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hannah, I heard you were studying back East--what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>Hannah West</strong>: Graduate school. Excuse me. </p>
<p>(She walks past Sara and heads for the front.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Excuse me.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I need Marlon West's DNA. If his semen is in Kira Dellinger, it puts him at the murder.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Look, they had a known sexual relationship, so there's no evidence of rape. And I don't know if you know this, but Marlon's mother and father were killed in a car accident last year. Judge Bowman is going to be very sensitive to that. It could look like harassment.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Jim, are you going to talk to the judge or not?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Wow, you really got it out for this kid. What's the deal here, Sara?</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: GHB does occur naturally in the body. You sure she was drugged?</p>
<p><strong>Henry Andrews</strong>: Pretty sure. Started to metabolize in her blood and urine when she died. That typically indicates dosing.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay, so then maybe she was roofied, raped, then murdered.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And no vaginal trauma because she was too numb to resist. It's possible.</p>
<p><strong>Henry Andrews</strong>: You know, some people take GHB recreationally.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I didn't find any drug paraphernalia in her room. It was pretty consistent with a &quot;straight edge&quot; lifestyle.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You know, that just sounds like something a girl tells her parents in order to make them feel better. I mean, we know she had s*x. There was GHB in her system ... I think you just need to test everything in her room that she may have ingested.</p>

<p><strong>Greg</strong>: With the last post a couple hours before she died.</p>
<p><strong>Archie Johnson</strong>: What made you think to check her Twitter page?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, most date rape victims know their assailants, and Kira was an active blogger, so I figured if she was having trouble with anyone, she'd probably talk about it online. Some people just don't value privacy.</p>
<p><strong>Archie Johnson</strong>: They don't expect privacy. They value openness.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Whatever.</p>
<p>(They find an entry.) </p>
<p><strong>Archie Johnson</strong>: Hmm. &quot;It shouldn't suck when two boys fight over you, but it does. Drummerboy19 won't be a man. And TorchX wants what he can't have. They both bug.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Jordan Rockwell</strong>: We used to date in high school. Then we reconnected online, and, uh ... I came down to the campus to check out her band.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So she gave you a roll for old times' sake.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan Rockwell</strong>: Well, I ... uh ... I kind of helped her out with a boyfriend problem.</p>

<p>(Brass shows him a photo of MARLON WEST.) </p>
<p><strong>Jordan Rockwell</strong>: Yeah. Yeah, that's the guy. He was ... uh ... he was into her, you know, but she ... she was not into him. And he started giving her static, so ... I knocked the little douche's teeth out. I guess she kind of liked it, because she took me back to her place after that.</p>

<p><strong>Jordan Rockwell</strong>: She fell asleep ... and then I started feeling sick, so I ... uh ... got my car to drive home. Then I got really dizzy and ... uh ... wham. That's it.</p>

<p><strong>Marlon</strong>: We both know I didn't do that.</p>
<p>(Hannah looks at Marlon.</p>
<p><strong>Hannah</strong>: You look a little flushed, Marlon. (A bead of sweat runs down Marlon's face.) Are you feeling all right?</p>
<p><strong>Marlon</strong>: No, I'm not feeling all right.</p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – BRASS'S OFFICE – CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Brass and Sara listen to Hannah and Marlon over the speakers.) </p>
<p><strong>Hannah</strong>: (over speaker) Kira always brought out the worst in you.</p>
<p><strong>Marlon</strong>: Hannah, they're going to put me away for the rest of my life.</p>
<p><strong>Hannah</strong>: The evidence is against you, particularly given your history of violence.</p>
<p><strong>Marlon</strong>: Please ... after everything I've done for you, after everything we've done for each other, at least tell me why.</p>
<p><strong>Hannah</strong>: Because I love you.</p>
<p><strong>Marlon</strong>: And I love you, too.</p>
<p><strong>Hannah</strong>: No. You don't. But you will. I promise, I'll visit you every week.</p>
<p>(Hannah stands up and looks at the guard.) </p>
<p><strong>Hannah</strong>: We're done.</p>
<p>(The guard puts the chair back and leads Hannah out. Marlon is left alone in the cell.) </p>
<p>(Brass sighs.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, he gave it a shot, but she is way out of his league.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p>(Sara steps forward. She appears ready to talk. She smiles at him.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Okay, what's up?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'm sorry. I've been ... uh ...</p>
<p>(Sara's cell phone rings. Grissom waits. Sara answers her phone.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (to phone) This is Sara. (She pauses, then looks at Grissom.) (to phone) I'll be right there.</p>

<p>(Sara waits by a tree for Hannah.) </p>
<p><strong>Hannah</strong>: You need to talk to me again?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I do. I know that you killed Kira Dellinger. I just can't prove it.</p>
<p><strong>Hannah</strong>: That must be frustrating for you.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hannah, Marlon's dead.</p>
<p><strong>Hannah</strong>: Wow. That's a really sad and desperate ploy, Sara. It's beneath you.</p>
<p>(Sara shows Hannah the photo of Marlon hanging at the windowsill.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: He was doing well here, wasn't he? Making friends, joining a band, falling in love. But you're still a freak, just like high school.</p>
<p><strong>Hannah</strong>: You're lying. No. This is a lie.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: His world got bigger, and yours stayed the same, and you killed Kira so you could keep him all to yourself, didn't you?</p>
<p><strong>Hannah</strong>: (screams) It's a lie! No ... it's a lie! It's a lie! This is a ... lie!</p>
<p>(She drops her backpack and grabs Sara's hands. Sara struggles with her and kneels as Hannah cries.) </p>

<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: (o.s.) Look at this. I didn't think my results were inconclusive and that I'll just have to wait till I get the tox results back from Henry.</p>
<p>(She turns the corner and walks up to Grissom, who is getting a report back from Hodges.) </p>

<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS STRIP – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(A taxi moves down the strip.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (V.O.) I haven't been feeling very well. Truth be told, I'm tired.</p>
<p>(SARA is in the cab.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (V.O.) Out in the desert, under that car that night, I realized something, and I haven't been able to shake it. Since my father died, I've spent almost my entire life with ghosts. We'd been like close friends, and out there in the desert, it occurred to me that it was time for me to bury them. I can't do that here. I'm so sorry. No matter how hard I try to fight it off, I'm left with the feeling that ... I have to go. I have no idea where I'm going, but I know I have to do this. If I don't, I'm afraid I'll self-destruct, and worse, you'll be there to see it happen. Be safe. Know that I tried very hard to stay. Know that you are my one and only. I will miss you with every beat of my heart. Our life together was the only home I've ever really had. I wouldn't trade it for anything.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (V.O.) I love you.</p>
<p>(Grissom takes his glasses off.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (V.O.) I always will.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (V.O.) Good-bye.</p>
<p>ON: GRISSOM</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>

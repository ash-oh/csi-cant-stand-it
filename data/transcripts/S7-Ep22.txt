<p>[EXT. DESERT ROAD – DAY]</p>
<p>CU: LIZARD ON A ROCK</p>
<p>(A lizard is on a rock in the middle of the road.) </p>
<p>(Officer cars rush down the road and are headed toward the lizard. Sirens blare. The lead car suddenly turns right and smashes through the wooden fence. The other cars follow.) </p>
<p>[EXT. CONNORS RESIDENCE – DAY]</p>
<p>(The officer cars rush down the long driveway and stop in front of a house complete with pigs in a sty out front. Car doors open and officers with their guns out take position behind the doors. The SWAT team moves out toward the house. Brass gets out of the car and yells through the bullhorn.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hank Connors, Las Vegas Police. Come out with your hands above your head. Come out slowly.</p>
<p>(Gunfire erupts from the house. Officers duck as bullets shatter car glass.) </p>
<p>(The officers return fire.) </p>
<p>(A couple of SWAT move in closer and take cover behind an old tractor.)</p>
<p>(The gunfire from the house continues.) </p>
<p>(The two SWAT officers move in closer to the house. One of them is hit.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Officer down!</p>
<p>(They continue to exchange gunfire.) </p>
<p><strong>Hank Connors</strong>: (shouts) Go back where you came from! You're not taking me!</p>
<p>(He continues to fire on the officers outside.) </p>
<p>(He stops and looks outside.)</p>
<p>SLOW MOTION: Three SWAT officers move in toward the house.</p>
<p>(Hank Connors takes a moment, then he runs into the house.)</p>
<p>(The officers reach the front porch.)</p>
<p>[INT. CONNORS RESIDENCE – HALLWAY – CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Hank Connors makes his way through the hallway to the door in the back.) </p>
<p>[EXT. CONNORS RESIDENCE – FRONT PORCH –C ONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(One of the officers kicks the front door in.) </p>
<p>[INT. CONNORS RESIDENCE – BACK DOOR – CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Hank Connors stops in front of the back door and turns around to look inside, his back to the door.) </p>
<p>[INT. CONNORS RESIDENCE – LIVING ROOM – CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(SWAT officers enter the house and head for the hallway.) </p>
<p>REVERSE VIEW</p>
<p>(The SWAT officers appear in the hallway entrance and make their way toward the back door.) </p>
<p>(Hank Connor appears to stand in front of the back door.) </p>
<p>(SWAT officers continue to make their way toward him.) </p>
<p>(Hank Connor grabs a gun, puts it under his chin and -- </p>
<p>BANG!</p>
<p>(Blood spatters on the back door window.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CONNORS RESIDENCE – LIVING ROOM / HALLWAY – CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(The guns found in the house are on the table. Nick walks in and heads for the hallway where Hank Connor's body is slumped up against the back door.) </p>
<p>(Along the hallway walls, Nick notes the guns and ammunition stacked on the side. He stops in front of the body and notes the handgun in the victim's grip. He also notes the large water bottles in the room beyond the back door.) </p>
<p>(Brass enters the hallway.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: MREs, automatic weapons, ammo, water -- this guy Connors was ready for the end of days.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Which, in his case, was today. Bomb squad find any booby traps?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No, he liked it mano a mano.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Any sign of Chyna De Vere?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. CONNORS RESIDENCE – FRONT YARD -- DAY]</p>
<p>(Grissom and Warrick walk along the side of the house where the pigs in the pen are.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You know, there's some food, you just shouldn't see where it comes from.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did you know that pigs are very intelligent animals, right behind chimps, dolphins and elephants?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Ahead of dogs?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And certain politicians.</p>
<p>(Warrick chuckles.)</p>
<p>(They look around.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I don't see Connors' truck anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Let's look in the barn.</p>
<p>(They head for the barn.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CONNORS RESIDENCE – BARN -- DAY]</p>
<p>(The cat runs down the steps and out the door as it opens. Grissom and Warrick walk in.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: There's the truck.</p>
<p>(Warrick steps up to the area where the blue truck is parked. He and Grissom look at the truck. They find bloodstains in the bed.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: If this is Chyna De Vere's blood, we're getting warmer.</p>
<p>(Warrick snaps photos of the blood. Grissom turns and looks around the barn. They note the items on the desk and the stuffed animals on the side.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Looks like he had a hobby -- stuffed animals.</p>
<p>(Warrick stops near the table and looks at the items on it while Grissom continues toward the other side of the barn. He looks at the various stuffed animal heads up on the wall.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hey, Warrick.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I feel like Marco Polo.</p>
<p>(Warrick heads over toward Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Why's that?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I just discovered Chyna.</p>
<p>(Chyna's head is mounted up on the wall.) </p>

<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[INT. CONNORS RESIDENCE – BARN -- DAY]</p>
<p>(David Phillips is standing up on a chair and looking at Chyna's head up on the wall.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: This is a career first.</p>
<p>(Warrick is working on the table in the back.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: A little tip for you: The new Mrs. Phillips doesn't need to hear about this.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Are you kidding me? She'll want to hear every detail. Why do you think I married her?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. CONNORS RESIDENCE – FRONT YARD -- DAY]</p>
<p>(Sara walks around the house and finds Nick in the sty with the pigs and the mud. He's trying to round them up.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Come on, pretty girl, come on.</p>
<p>(The pigs squeal. Sara watches him.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, I read about this farmer in Canada who killed a bunch of women and fed them to his pigs.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, their health department had to put out a bulletin that said, &quot;Warning: your pork may be contaminated with human.&quot;</p>
<p>(Nick pushes a pig toward the container opening.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'm so glad I'm a vegetarian.</p>
<p>(The pig snorts as Nick grabs him and pushes him through the opening.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Get through there!</p>
<p>(The pig goes through the opening.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, no one has seen or heard from the victim's husband, so ... I kind of figured he may have been dessert.</p>
<p>(Nick herds another pig to the opening.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I think the fat one likes you.</p>
<p>(Nick smiles and sighs at Sara.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: They always do.</p>

[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) – DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. CSI – GARAGE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Greg and Catherine walk into the lab.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: We went to Connors' ranch because a week ago, Chyna De Vere went missing. She just separated from her husband, got her own place.</p>
<p>(They stop in front of a large piece of carpeting on the floor.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: This is a large section of her living room carpet -- wet to the touch, pheno confirmed a blood pool.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, it's certainly enough blood to suggest foul play.</p>
<p>(Greg looks through the file.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: There were also traces of perchloroethylene, phosphates, alcohol, ethers and sodium hypocholorite.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Used a steam cleaner. Would've denatured any DNA.</p>
<p>(She stands up and walks around the carpeting.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yeah, we checked all the local places that rent them. Connors' name didn't come up.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: How about the husband's?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Nope. And he's still missing.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So what's this?</p>
<p>(She points to a circle on the carpet marked GS 102.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: That is a single, distinct blood drop -- not from the victim, not from the husband. They didn't clean the whole carpet. Unknown female. We also found soil trace, identified as scheelite, a tungsten ore. Apparently, Connors' ranch is near old tungsten mines by McCade.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (shakes her head) How is Connors, this pig farmer, connected to the victim?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Oh, he's in kind of a club with the victim's husband.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Kind of a club?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CONNORS RESIDENCE – BACK ROOM -- DAY]</p>
<p>(Grissom flips through a book of drawings of aliens, UFOs and other unidentified creatures. He closes the book to look at the title, &quot;To Walk Among Us.&quot;) </p>
<p>(He puts the book down. The next book on the bookshelf is, &quot;Serpents of the Universe: A Comprehensive Account of the Reptilian Conspiracy.&quot;) </p>
<p>(He turns and looks at the various items on the table – UFO magazines, a photo, tin foil, tape. He picks up the photo of two men and a woman. He puts the photo down and opens a magazine to a yellow flyer. It reads:<br />
APRIL 15, 2006<br />

BASED ON THE WORK OF DR. SIDNEY BUCKMAN<br />
WE ARE NOT ALONE. COME HEAR THE TRUTH. )</p>
<p>(He picks up the flyer and looks at it.) </p>
<p>[INT. CONNORS RESIDENCE – LIVING ROOM / BACK ROOM -- DAY]</p>
<p>(Sara walks into the house as the coroners are wheeling out the body. She walks through the hallway and into the back room where Grissom is.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Want me to take the living room? Looks like Armageddon came on a Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Do you believe that intelligent life exists on other planets?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'm not sure there's intelligent life on this planet.</p>
<p>(He gives her a look.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'll get started.</p>

<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – INTERVIEW ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Brass walks in and talks with Shannon Turner.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Ms. Turner.</p>
<p><strong>Shannon Turner</strong>: I already went through this a week ago.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know, you're right. But let's go through it again. Chyna De Vere is dead. And her remains were found on your boyfriend's ranch.</p>
<p><strong>Shannon Turner</strong>: Yeah, not my boyfriend -- my friend. And furthermore, I never knew Chyna De Vere.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: She wasn't a member of your club?</p>
<p><strong>Shannon Turner</strong>: No. If she was, I would have known her, and I didn't.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Her husband was. And he's MIA. You know, the club's getting smaller and smaller by the minute. This morning, Hank Connors died. </p>
<p>(Shannon Turner appears shocked and upset by the news.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: When we went up there to arrest your friend, he shot himself. And I'm getting the feeling that you're going to be missing a meeting, too. Look, Shannon, you alibied a killer. You're already an accessory to one murder. If Hank Connors killed Chyna's husband, too ...</p>
<p><strong>Shannon Turner</strong>: Oh. Oh, is that what you think happened?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Tell me where he is. Hmm? You know, this can work in your favor with the DA.</p>
<p><strong>Shannon Turner</strong>: Oh, you know what? I'm not really worried about that.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CONNORS RESIDENCE – BACK ROOM -- DAY]</p>
<p>(Grissom is looking at the notices and clippings pinned to the bulletin board. He looks around and notices the pull-down projector screen up on the ceiling. He pulls down the projector screen and looks around for the projector.) </p>
<p>(At the end of the room, the projector is set up in the closet. Grissom turns the closet light on and switches on the projector.) </p>
<p>(The image of Dr. Sidney Buckman appears on the screen.) </p>
<p><strong>Sidney Buckman</strong>: Adam and Eve were not only the first humans on the Earth, they were bait ... for intelligent life forms elsewhere in the cosmos, refugees from planets that could no longer sustain them. But why Earth? Deoxyribonucleic acid. DNA. The blueprint of human life is the key to their survival. Without it, they will perish.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – INTERVIEW ROOM – DAY]</p>
<p>(The door opens and Greg walks in with his kit.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Hi, Ms. Turner. My name's Greg Sanders; I'm with the Crime Lab. I have a warrant to take a sample of your DNA.</p>
<p>(He puts his kit on the table and gives the warrant to her.) </p>
<p><strong>Shannon Turner</strong>: You're not touching me.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, ma'am, this is standard procedure.</p>
<p>(Greg opens his kit and takes out a swab.) </p>
<p><strong>Shannon Turner</strong>: I know who you are. </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I'm just going to swab the inside of ...</p>
<p>(He approaches her with the swab. She stands up and violently pushes him away from her.) </p>
<p><strong>Shannon Turner</strong>: Hey! Not!</p>
<p>(The woman officer grabs her and holds her as she struggles.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Calm down.</p>
<p><strong>Shannon Turner</strong>: Get off of me!</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Calm down, ma'am. Calm down.</p>
<p><strong>Shannon Turner</strong>: All of you get away from me! Get him away from ... !</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Calm down.</p>
<p>(They force her to sit down on the floor.) </p>
<p><strong>Shannon Turner</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Let's try this again.</p>
<p>(He tries to get the swab in her mouth and she bites down on his hand.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Let go of his hand! Let go of his hand, ma'am.</p>
<p>(Greg looks at the bite mark on his hand.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: That bitch bit me.</p>
<p>(Greg turns and swabs her saliva from his hand.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I got my sample.</p>
<p>(He turns and heads back to his kit.) </p>

[INT. CONNORS RESIDENCE – BACK ROOM -- DAY]</p>
<p>(Grissom continues to watch the film.) </p>
<p><strong>Sidney Buckman</strong>: (on film) The first encounters between humans and extraterrestrials took place over a hundred thousand years ago in Atlantis, and in its sister civilization in the Pacific, Lemuria. Ancient civilizations on every continent have recorded evidence of these encounters. These visitors were highly advanced and did not appear in human form. Now, the Mayans called them Chanes -- people of the serpents-- and in Hebrew legend, the snake represented knowledge. Of course it did. It was not human. Not of this Earth.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. TURNER RESIDENCE – DAY]</p>
<p>(Catherine and Brass walk into the living room. Catherine puts her kit down while Brass looks at the books on the shelf.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Shannon sure has a lot of books.</p>
<p>(There are titles for ‘Foundation for &quot;A Course in Miracles&quot;', ‘Flying Saucers: Top Secret,' ‘The Handbook of Artificial Intelligence,' ‘Astronomy: The Cosmic Journey,' and A Different Approach to Cosmology. )</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: UFO's, alien abduction ...</p>
<p>(Catherine is looking at the mail on the desk. She flips the card over. The address on the other side is to:<br />

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Chyna was a dealer at the Palermo. Looks like Shannon was a player. Gold level.</p>
<p>(The card is for PALERMO PLAYER'S CLUB, LOOSEST SLOTS IN VEGAS.<br />

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, tell me they never met. We'll check the Palermo security.</p>
<p>(Catherine opens the desk drawer and takes out a sketchbook. Brass walks over as Catherine flips through it. She sees sketches of various designs and reptilian creatures.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Reptiles ... UFOs ...</p>
<p>(She turns the page over to a sketch of a warrior woman.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Xena, Warrior Princess.</p>

[INT. CONNORS RESIDENCE – BACK ROOM -- DAY]</p>
<p>(Grissom continues to watch the film.) </p>
<p><strong>Sidney Buckman</strong>: (on film) History is replete with stories of the heroic destruction of serpents: Perseus and Medusa, St. George and the Dragon, St. Patrick and the Snakes of Ireland.</p>
<p>(Sara walks in and stops to watch the film with Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Sidney Buckman</strong>: (on film) But these are not merely legends ...</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I think their UFO club is based on the teachings of this guy.</p>
<p><strong>Sidney Buckman</strong>: (on film) ... and the natural form of these invaders is not human. They are described in ancient accounts as serpents and dragons. And man's weapon against them is the sword. Cut off the tail, the serpent lives. Cut off its head, and it dies.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So Connors cut off her head because he thought she was a serpent from outer space?</p>
<p>(Grissom turns and looks at her. The film ends.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. TURNER RESIDENCE – DAY]</p>
<p>(Catherine continues to flip through the sketchbook to show more reptilian creatures. Brass is in the kitchen.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Catherine ... check this out.</p>
<p>(Catherine heads for the kitchen. Brass shows her a mug with a photo of Preston De Vere and Shannon Turner. The caption reads: Chillin' in Cabo.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Chyna De Vere's husband, Preston.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What's Shannon doing with him?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: &quot;Chillin' in Cabo.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm still working on the &quot;how.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: That, I can tell you. Mounted one myself. A deer-- Dad was a hunter. First, our guy had to separate the head from the body. For that, he used a serrated-edge knife.</p>
<p>(Robbins shows Grissom the pattern on the bottom of the skin.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Dad used a carving knife, same one we used at Thanksgiving. When mom found out, she almost killed him with it.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's like we're witnessing some form of mass hallucination. You know, they think the cops are part of this reptilian conspiracy as well. That's why Shannon attacked Greg.</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: [INT. P.D. -- INTERVIEW ROOM] The officers hold Shannon down while Greg stands over her.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Let's try this again.</p>
<p>(As she looks at him, his hand turns scaly and green with webbed fingers.) </p>
<p>(Shannon looks at Greg and his face turns reptilian.) </p>
<p>(End of flash.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: And why Hank Connors shot himself.</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: [EXT. CONNORS RESIDENCE] Hank looks out his window. The officers are advancing toward the house with their guns. A cloud of dust blocks his view. When it clears, Hank sees reptilians dressed as officers and carrying guns as they advance toward the house.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(Hank stands in front of the door to his back room. He sees a reptilian advancing toward him down the hallway. He puts the gun under his chin and shoots himself.) </p>
<p>(End of flashes.) </p>
<p>(Brass steps into the room and holds up his badge.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Sorry to interrupt.</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: Don't make eye contact with them.</p>
<p>(Everyone in the group looks away.) </p>
<p>(Brass looks at Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Please, we come in peace.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Which one of you is Clarissa Niles?</p>
<p>(The man looks at Clarissa and shakes his head.)</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: Don't.</p>
<p>(Clarissa raises her hand.) </p>
<p><strong>Clarissa Niles</strong>: It's all right. I'm not afraid.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) – SUNSET]</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (V.O.) Got a warrant to tow in Clarissa Niles' car.</p>
<p>[INT. CSI – GARAGE] </p>
<p>(Greg shows Catherine what he's found on the tires under the ALS.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Blue fluorescence is one of the properties of scheelite.</p>
<p>(Catherine puts her gloves on.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Which was found in the soil at Hank Connors' ranch.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (nods) And Preston beamed down in the same area.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Have you looked inside yet?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Naw. I was just about to.</p>
<p>(Catherine opens the back door and looks inside. She finds men's shoes and clothing.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Preston was found naked, right?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yeah, it's a recurrent theme in tales of alien abduction. I practically grew up on ‘The X-Files.'</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Preston's wallet. Somehow I doubt aliens would have folded his clothes when they abducted him. </p>
<p>(Greg pops the trunk.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So Clarissa drove him out there and he left his stuff in her car.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: That's not all he left.</p>
<p>(Catherine joins Greg and she chuckles at the contents in the trunk.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Steam cleaner. Just what every estranged husband needs to clean up his dead wife's blood.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: This case just came down to Earth.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – INTERVIEW ROOM]</p>
<p>(Brass interviews Clarissa Niles.) </p>
<p><strong>Clarissa Niles</strong>: Yes, Preston was at my home in Summerlin. We were asleep and suddenly the room turned very cold. Freezing. I woke up and looked over and Preston was gone. I ... I searched the house, outside ... It was as if he evaporated.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (SIGHS) Come on, Clarissa, you're a smart woman, I mean, really. I mean, you have a beautiful home, you're a good citizen, you pay your taxes, you vote, you even play a little golf. You got way too much on the ball to fall for this con man.</p>
<p><strong>Clarissa Niles</strong>: Con man? You think I'm gullible? He's a brilliant man. He saved my life. When we first met, I was very ill. It was cancer and he cured it.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Really? How'd he do that?</p>
<p><strong>Clarissa Niles</strong>: He knows how to prevent human cells from dying. He has injections; they're, they're radioactive. Hospitals won't do it because it would make everyone well. It would put them out of business.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Do you really think he's four thousand years old? Here. Let me show you something. (He opens a file folder. She puts on her glasses.) Look at this. He's 42. He claims he's a nutritionist. He's not. And look. Look at all these schools and labs he said he went to. They never heard of him. He has no place of business, no job. He just preys on vulnerable women. He got Shannon Turner to kill his wife for him. Got you to give him money.</p>
<p><strong>Clarissa Niles</strong>: He never asked for it. I wanted to give it to him.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You would have done anything for him, whether he asked for it or not.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Preston talks with Clarissa at a group meeting.) </p>
<p><strong>Preston De Vere</strong>: Do you have any idea how beautiful you are? (She blushes.) I mean really, really, really beautiful. More so every day.</p>
<p><strong>Clarissa Niles</strong>: That's because you cured me. I-I-I've never felt better or happier.</p>
<p><strong>Preston De Vere</strong>: You know, I didn't want to alarm you, but they put an implant in you. They do it while you're sleeping so they can manipulate your thoughts. My injections disabled it. You're not only cancer-free, you're free of their control.</p>
<p><strong>Clarissa Niles</strong>: Oh, my God. How am I ever going to be able to thank you?</p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You drove him out to McCade, you dropped him off, you brought back his clothes. The evidence is all over your car.</p>
<p><strong>Clarissa Niles</strong>: He loved me.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: He used you just like he used everybody.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – TRACE LAB]</p>
<p>(Hodges opens the steam cleaner and finds a single strand of hair in the bristles. He removes the hair.) </p>
<p>[INT. CSI – FORENSIC AUTOPSY]</p>
<p>(David opens the drawer and takes a single strand of Chyna's hair.) </p>
<p>[INT. CSI – GARAGE]</p>
<p>(Greg dusts the plastic steam cleaner water container and finds a print under the cover. He lifts it and scans it into the database.) </p>
<p>[INT. CSI – HALLWAY/ DNA LAB]</p>
<p>(Hodges shares his findings with Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: If they were trying to clean up all the blood, they did a good job. Steam cleaner tested positive for blood, but there wasn't enough for DNA.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Did you find anything?</p>
<p>(They enter the DNA Lab.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Funny you should ask. Found a hair in the brushes.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: It's on the left.</p>
<p>(Catherine looks in the scope at the two strands of hair.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: The one on the right is Chyna De Vere's.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: They're both Chyna's.</p>
<p>(Hodges nods. Greg bursts into the lab.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Hey. So, that steam cleaner was completely wiped down, couldn't find any prints. But then I remembered this story about a CSI down in LA. Nobody could find any prints on a gas can from an arson, but he realized that you got to grip it underneath in order to pour out the gas. And you know what? He broke the case.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So whose prints are on the steam cleaner?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I just got an AFIS hit: Preston De Vere.</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: [INT. CONNORS RESIDENCE] Chyna is on the floor. Hank paces nearby. Preston talks with Shannon.) </p>
<p><strong>Preston De Vere</strong>: You have a destiny. You were chosen. You are a Protector of Mankind. Have no fear. (to Hank) Cut off her tail, she lives. Cut off her head, she dies.</p>
<p><strong>Hank Connors</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p>(Hank picks Chyna up. There's a large bloodstain on the carpet.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(Preston steam cleans the carpet.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(Preston removes the plastic water container and empties the bloodied water down the drain.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Men are snakes.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – HALLWAY]</p>
<p>(The officers lead Preston out through the hallway. Preston smiles and nods to everyone. Brass follows behind him.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So we checked Chyna's bank account. She had a tidy little inheritance until she met you.</p>
<p><strong>Preston De Vere</strong>: Chyna was sucking the life out of me. She deserved none of what she wanted and all of what she got in the end. I'm glad it took a long time for her to die. I can only imagine the pain.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know, every time I think about leaving this job, a guy like you comes along and reminds me why I can't.</p>
<p>(Brass leaves. Preston turns and sees Clarissa Niles walk up to him. She spits on his face. The officer leads her away.) </p>

<p>[INT. GRISSOM'S RESIDENCE – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Grissom works on constructing his miniature scene while Bruno slobbers at his feet.) </p>
<p><strong>Sidney Buckman</strong>: (V.O.) These are not merely legends. These are accounts of battles for the survival of the human race -- a battle we will lose unless we stop killing one another and focus on the real enemies. </p>
<p>(Grissom applies glue to a piece and puts it on the grid of the room he's constructing.) </p>
<p><strong>Sidney Buckman</strong>: (V.O.) They are among us.</p>

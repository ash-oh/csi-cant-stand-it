[EXT. CLUB - ENTRANCE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CLUB SECURITY is running a hand-held metal detector on every person who wants to enter the club. Currently, they check a man at the door. The line behind him is long.)</p>
<p><strong>Club Security</strong>: Go ahead. CLUB SECURITY: Turn around. CLUB SECURITY: Go ahead. CLUB SECURITY: Next.</p>
<p>(CLUB SECURITY motions for the man to go. The man leaves. Next up is a woman. CLUB SECURITY runs the hand-held metal detector on her back, from top to bottom.)</p>
<p><strong>Club Security</strong>: Turn around.</p>
<p>(The woman turns around. The metal detector beeps.)</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: My kitty's pierced. </p>
<p>(CLUB SECURITY stares at her without comment.)</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: Want to see?</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Camera travels low to the ground following The WOMAN into the club. She stops at the railing to watch what's happening in the pit.)</p>
<p><strong>DJ</strong>: (over speakers) Party people ... Brothers and Sisters ... Angels and devils ... Virgins and Sinners ... let the foam take you away to your deepest desires. Cleanse yourself. There's no turning back now.</p>
<p>(Inside the pit, men and women dance as they are being covered with foam.) </p>
<p>(From inside the foam pit, a woman stands and starts screaming, her voice heard above the pulsating music.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. THE CLUB - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Camera opens on the pit, foam dissipated. In the center of the pit is a dead body sprawled out on the floor. BRASS stands over the body while looking through the victim's wallet.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM carries his CSI kit and makes his way down the steps into the pit toward BRASS. BRASS holds the victim's ID card.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Ever been to a foam party?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Things can get pretty wild.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (looking at the body) Evidently. You got an I.D. on this guy?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, the deceased is Trey Buchman. Age 21. I got a Vegas I.D.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Eyewitnesses?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Uh, too much foam. The party was over. Most of the &quot;responsible&quot; young adults had split.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's amazing how the sight of blood can clear a room.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM puts his kit down and kneels to look at the victim.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah. I'll tell you what we got. My guys are talking with the girl who found the body, but even sober, she's not going to be much help.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Wonder what made this wound? Looks like a puncture.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Ice pick, maybe? </p>
<p>(BRASS riffles through the man's wallet, counting the money inside.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, wow. Tell you it's not for the money. I got about three grand here, all in c-notes.</p>
<p>(He holds the money up for GRISSOM to see.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (looks up) Proves the old adage.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Which adage is that?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You can't take it with you.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>WHITE FLASH IN:</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (V.O.) Foam at the sinner's den ...</p>
<hr />
[INT. CLUB -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(WARRICK and SARA walk across the club toward the steps to the pit.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I hung out here a few times.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Never been.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Your knucklehead boyfriend never took you on the party circuit?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Uh, pass.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: That's cool about Vegas. It's Monday: Rain at the Palms; Tuesday: Eden at studio 54; Wednesday: Raw at the Luxor; Thursday's Baby's ...</p>
<p>(WARRICK and SARA pass the guard at the top of the stairs and make their way down the stairs into the pit.)</p>
<p>CAMERA PANS TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CLUB - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(BRASS is interviewing the OWNER of The Dance Club.)</p>
<p><strong>Owner</strong>: Hey, look. Some kid dropped dead. It's a shame. Kids O.D. all the time in nightclubs. They're big boys and girls. This ain't church.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I understand that.</p>
<p><strong>Owner</strong>: You understand. You know the kind of rent I pay on a joint like this? Rain or shine, I owe the landlord fifty thou ($50,000).</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You're breaking my heart, pal. Look, here's how this works. The more you cooperate, the sooner you'll be up and running.</p>
<p><strong>Owner</strong>: You don't get it.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No, I get it. I got a daughter who's twenty, she hangs out. I don't want her to die in a place like this, so do me a favor, get me the VIP list for tonight ... and smarten up.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CLUB - THE PIT - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Camera opens on body fluid spatter on underwear left on the floor of the pit as seen through tinted glass and an ALS. GRISSOM moves the light away and continues to look around.)</p>
<p>(SARA opens her kit and removes a pair of gloves to put on.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM continues to look around the floor of the pit and sees more body fluid spatter ... on the floor ... on discarded underwear ... on everything and everywhere.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: There's seminal fluid all over the place.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Is this a dance club or a s*x club?</p>
<p>(WARRICK picks up a discarded underwire bra.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: A little of both. Don't you love this town?</p>
<p>(He holds it up and bags it.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Whatever you say, Superfly.</p>
<p>(WARRICK snorts.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You guys smell that?</p>
<p>(WARRICK picks up discarded underwear next to marker #10.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Smells like strawberries.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It's the foam. </p>
<p>(He puts the underwear in a bag.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Reminds me of the Mirage. Steve Wynn didn't like the smell of the volcano erupting, so he changed the fuel mixture. Now it smells like a piña colada.</p>
<p>(WARRICK moves to item #11 and picks up a clear stiletto-heeled shoe.)</p>
<p>(BRASS walks into the pit.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hey. I got a line on our vic. Trey Buchman, booked a room at The Sphere. E-wing, room 937.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - MORNING]</p>
<hr />
[INT. THE SPHERE - ROOM 937 -- DAY]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM stands near the room window and looks around the inside of the main room/bedroom.)</p>
<p>(In one smooth, continuous movement, the camera slowly moves over to SARA looking around from the bed to the walls on the opposite side of the room. She examines a pair of large cuffs dangling from the bedroom wall lights.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: These people are freaks.</p>
<p>(Camera moves through the bathroom door to WARRICK who is examining the bathroom. He picks up a strand of hair.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (calls out) Got a long dark hair.</p>
<p>(Camera moves back through the bathroom door to SARA who turns away from the cuffs and starts examining the floor.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Vic had short hair.</p>
<p>(Camera moves back to GRISSOM who is holding up a champagne glass with a lipstick smudge on the lip.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: One of our &quot;freaks&quot; wears pussycat pink.</p>
<p>(Cut to close up of the champagne glass with lipstick smudge.)</p>
<p>CUE: (PRELAP) PLAY NARRATOR: The battle was fierce ...</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM -- DAY]</p>
<p>(LINDSEY is dressed in Sleeping Beauty blue and lying on a make-shift bed in the middle of the stage. CATHERINE sits in the middle of the audience near the aisle, the proud parent holding a digital video camera, recording the play. LINDSEY turns her head and opens one of her eyes to look at her mom. She shuts her eyes and turns back to 'sleeping'.)</p>
<p><strong>Play Narrator</strong>: (o.s.) ... The Evil Sorceress had powerful magic, but the Prince was brave and true. </p>
<p>(On stage, the &quot;Prince&quot; battles a &quot;Dragon&quot;. CATHERINE smiles as she gets everything on camera.)</p>
<p>(EDDIE walks down the aisle from the back of the auditorium. He slips into the seat next to CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Play Narrator</strong>: (o.s.) Finally, the brave Prince slew the Sorceress-dragon and went to awaken his beloved Princess.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE puts the camera down. She sighs and shakes her head.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You're late, Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>Eddie</strong>: Don't start.</p>
<p><strong>Play Narrator</strong>: (o.s.) He climbed the many stairs to the top ...</p>
<p>(On stage, the &quot;Prince&quot; makes his way toward LINDSEY.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You know how much this meant to Lindsey?</p>
<p><strong>Eddie</strong>: Can we argue about this later, okay?</p>
<p>(On stage, the &quot;Prince&quot; kisses LINSEY on the cheek. Her eyes open.)</p>
<p><strong>Play Narrator</strong>: (o.s.) Her eyes would open with true love's kiss.</p>
<p><strong>Eddie</strong>: (smiling) Hey! She's so beautiful. Give me that.</p>
<p>(He reaches for the camera. CATHERINE hands it to him. He resumes recording the plan.)</p>
<p><strong>Play Narrator</strong>: (o.s.) The evil spell was finally broken.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Nice perfume.</p>
<p>(EDDIE puts the camera down and sighs.)</p>
<p>(On stage, LINDSEY sits up ready to delivery her lines.)</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey</strong>: My ...</p>
<p>(At that moment, EDDIE has had enough.)</p>
<p><strong>Eddie</strong>: (loudly) Okay ... </p>
<p>(He stands up and looks down at CATHERINE.)</p>
<p>(LINDSEY and everyone else turns to look at EDDIE.)</p>
<p><strong>Eddie</strong>: Fine. Is this okay?</p>
<p><strong>Play Narrator</strong>: (o.s.) (prompting) My prince ...</p>
<p>(EDDIE pulls back a chair one row in front of CATHERINE. He sits down.)</p>
<p>(LINDSEY swallows.)</p>
<p><strong>Play Narrator</strong>: (o.s.) (prompting) My prince ... at long last, you've come for me.</p>
<p>(EDDIE raises the camera and resumes recording.)</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey</strong>: (upset) My ... my - my prince ...</p>
<p><strong>Play Narrator</strong>: (o.s.) (prompting) ... at long last, you've come for me ...</p>
<p>(LINDSEY turns to look at her parents in the audience. CATHERINE nods at her and smiles encouragingly. But it's way too late. LINDSEY'S more than hurt. She starts to cry.)</p>
<p>(LINDSEY slides off of the bed and runs off stage.)</p>
<p>(Camera holds on CATHERINE and EDDIE.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - HALLWAY -- DAY]</p>
<p>(LINDSEY sits next to EDDIE on the bench in the hallway. CATHERINE kneels in front of LINDSEY.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm sorry, baby. You did good, though.</p>
<p><strong>Eddie</strong>: Yeah, you were fine, Linds. Good.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, and you know what? It's just a play.</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey</strong>: No, it's not just a play. I was Sleeping Beauty and you guys ruined it.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm sorry, honey.</p>
<p><strong>Eddie</strong>: Hey, I'll bet if you ask Mrs. Parker, she'd let you keep that blue dress.</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey</strong>: I want to go home.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE nods and stands up.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay. Let's go home.</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey</strong>: No, mom. I want to go with dad.</p>
<p>(EDDIE looks up surprised at LINDSEY.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You sure about that? </p>
<p>(LINDSEY nods.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(EDDIE turns to look at CATHERINE.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- DAY]</p>
<p>(ROBBINS goes over his preliminary findings with GRISSOM. TREY BUCHMAN'S body is on the table between them.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Tox report on your foam guy came back negative.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Negative?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: No drugs, no alcohol, no medication, not even an aspirin.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's odd. It was a Den of Iniquity. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM thinks about it for a moment and shakes his head a little. He nods down at the body.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What about the neck wound?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: The sternocleidomastoid muscle and the jugular vein were lacerated. </p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV as the camera moves in toward the neck wound. It goes through the skin and down into the muscle below, piercing through the vein, blood splashing onto the lens.)</p>
<p>(Flash to white. End of CGI POV. Resume on ROBBINS.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: The wound was a bloody mess, probably lethal.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Any idea what caused it?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Hard to say. Definitely an odd entry wound. Not a knife or sharp object ... probably something blunt, like a pen or a stake of some sort.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Check this out.</p>
<p>(ROBBINS points to something on the body's right shoulder. GRISSOM leans in to look at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Looks like a bite. Spider bite or allergic reaction, maybe?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Stand by. I'll process the tissue in histopath, see if it's worth writing home about.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - LAB]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM is examining a silver thong. WARRICK walks in.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I was wondering where I put my nice silver satin thong.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks up at WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Gloves.</p>
<p>(WARRICK grabs a latex pair and puts it on. GRISSOM puts the thong back in its bag.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Okay, we're looking for any kind of blunt object that could've been used to stab our victim in the neck.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM picks up the photo of the injury and hands it to WARRICK. WARRICK takes a moment to look at the photo before scanning the items on the table, gathering them as he goes.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Glow stick. Ball-point pen. Cell phone antenna. You have the luminol?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM hands WARRICK the spray bottle.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>(WARRICK turns the lights off. He takes the items out of the bags and sprays them.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM picks up the bag with the clear stiletto-heeled shoe. He looks at the shoe heel.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Are we sure it was a blunt object?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes the shoe out of the bag to examine the heel.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to someone swinging the shoe and stabbing the victim in the neck with the heel. Close up of heel in the neck. End of flashback.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Size ten, double A.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Stilettos, huh? Brings out the toes, accentuates the legs. Murder on the ankles, though.</p>
<p>(WARRICK sprays luminol on the heel. It glows in the dark.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Looks like murder to me.</p>

<p>(BRASS accompanies a WOMAN. He holds the umbrella for her as they walk.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, you got lucky. You're on my list now.</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: I don't want to be on your list.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Here, hold this.</p>
<p>(The WOMAN scoffs. BRASS hands the umbrella to her.)</p>

<hr />
[INT. THE CLUB -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(In a room full of women, GRISSOM makes an announcement.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Okay, this is the story. One of you lovely Cinderellas is missing a glass slipper and I'm playing the Prince. So would each of you remove your right shoe, please?</p>
<p>(Dissolve to GRISSOM kneeling as he tries the shoe on the women. A group of four-five women sit in the high stools as he tries the shoe on. Another group of three women stand on the side and wait their turn.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Doesn't fit.</p>
<p>(Dissolve to GRISSOM continuing to try the shoe on more women's feet.)</p>
<p>(Dissolve to women standing and sitting, moving around and waiting their turn to try on the shoe.)</p>
<p>(Close up of a foot that doesn't fit the shoe. GRISSOM looks up.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Almost.</p>
<p>(The woman stands up and another woman takes her seat.)</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM tries the shoe on another foot.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No.</p>
<p>(The next foot GRISSOM fits the shoe on is a perfect match. He looks up at the blonde woman. She smiles down at him.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, if the shoe fits ...</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: ... wear it.</p>
<p>(The woman glances at BRASS, then turns to look at GRISSOM.)</p>

[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERROGATION ROOM -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(BRASS is questioning the Blonde-Haired Woman whose foot fit the shoe.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Comfortable?</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: So far. Thanks for asking. </p>

<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: Not p0rn. Voyeurism in a Brave New World.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What would Aldous Huxley say?</p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: Well ... if his credit card were valid, he could say anything he wanted at $3.95 per minute.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You could tell us about your relationship with Croix Richards.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No, thanks.</p>
<p>(STEVEN takes a chocolate from the tray and pops it into his mouth.)</p>

<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: That's a matter of public record.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did he ever tell you, specifically, what his wife's problem was?</p>

<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: Unfortunately, the language we speak in here doesn't necessarily translate to the world out there.</p>
<p>(She takes a match and lights the candle.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No, in here, the submissive has the power. All he has to do is say the safety word and everything stops.</p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: Very good, Mr. Grissom.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yes. But I value your insight.</p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: (smiles) I'm flattered. But you already seem to know the answers to your questions. You keep me in proximity when I walk away and when I'm close ... (she takes a step closer to GRISSOM) .... you watch my lips. Are you losing your hearing?</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: See, that's where it gets a little less heroic -- we found Lindsey alone in a sinking car.</p>
<p><strong>Candeece</strong>: I tried to get Eddie out. He was unconscious, and that ... that kid kept screaming ... and ... the current was really strong and we got swept downstream. What was I supposed to do?</p>

[INT. WILLOWS' RESIDENCE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(LINDSEY walks out of her room and down the hallway to her mother's room.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE is crying on her bed.)</p>
<p><strong>Lyric</strong>: ... stay tonight / we'll watch the full moon rising ...</p>
<p>(LINDSEY sits on the bed and puts her cheek on her mother's shoulder. She wraps her arms around her mom and brushes her hair soothingly with her fingers.)</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey</strong>: (softly) It's okay, mommy. It's okay. It's okay.</p>
<p><strong>Lyric</strong>: ... hold on tight ...</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>

[EXT. LADY HEATHER'S DOMINION - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT]</p>
<p><strong>Lyric</strong>: ... the sky is breaking ...</p>
<p>(The camera opens on the driveway outside The Dominion. The camera pans over to show a car parked in the driveway. GRISSOM sits inside his parked car. He looks at LADY HEATHER'S front door.)</p>
<p><strong>Lyric</strong>: ... I don't ever want to be alone ...</p>
<p>(He sits there behind the wheel looking at the front door. He sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Lyric</strong>: ... with all my darkest dreaming ... hold me close ...</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>

(Dissolve to: CATHERINE runs the next leg of the race to sounds of Vangeliss'
&quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;. She glances over at GRISSOM driving the car next to her.)
Catherine:  What the hell kind of music is that?
Grissom: Inspiration.
Catherine: Sedative.
Grissom: Okay.

Lyric: Sitting single / drinking double ... 
Grissom: How's this?
Catherine: How about something that doesn't twang?

Lyric: I said are you gonna be my girl? 
Catherine: Better.

Lyric: one, two, three, take my hand and come with me / because you look so fine / that I really wanna make you mine / I say you look so fine... 
 
Catherine:  Hey, Grissom!

Catherine: Grissom!


Catherine: Grissom!

Catherine:  Gris-s-som!

Catherine: God! What, are you taking a leak? 

Catherine:  The follow car is supposed to stay with the runner. We've been training for months, man. Twenty CSIs. A hundred twenty miles.
Grissom: Don't blame me. Blame him.

Grissom: I saw his flasher from the road.

Catherine: Good call.
Grissom: Fresh cut on his forehead. But the corneas usually take days to gloss over.
Catherine: Weird. The race just started. 
 
Catherine: L.A. County PD. Special Enforcement Squad. Badass. Hardcore badass. Give me some more light here.

Catherine: That looks like a recent injury. There's no scab. Fight?
Grissom: Maybe.
Catherine: Would you give me your phone?

Catherine:  Uh ... Uh, this is CSI Willows. 

Catherine:  I'm at highway 160, halfway through leg 16 of the Desert Relay. We got a 419, officer down. Notify Captain Brass.

Catherine: Barehanded, huh?
Grissom: Well, collect it or lose it. Ten years ago nobody would've known the difference.
Catherine: Ten years ago we wouldn't have been able to get DNA off that fiber.
Grissom: I'll find something in the car to bindle it.
Catherine: Time of discovery: 4:32. I'll put it in the report.

Catherine: So much for the race.
Grissom: Well, at least we didn't come in last.
HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS



 
 
 
(GREG stands nearby as he draws the crime scene noting the &quot;power tower&quot;, the
&quot;clearing&quot; and the distance from the road 


Catherine: So much for that shoe print.

Grissom: This could be blood on this rock.

Catherine: How many cops are in town this weekend?
Grissom: Twenty thousand. And the road is closed to civilians.
Catherine: Spring break with a badge.  Well, this ought to be fun. Every suspect's in law enforcement.

David Phillips: So, how was your run?
Greg: I'm still alive.
David Phillips: That's everything. 
(DAVID PHILLIPS hands the bag of contents to GREG. GREG takes the bag and looks at the receipt for a $300.00 ATM withdrawal on 04/27/04 from: 
FIRST MONUMENT BANK
Greg: ATM receipt. No card, no cash?
David Phillips: Well, he was in a race.
Greg: Maybe someone took his wallet.

Brass: So, Lieutenant Mendez, tell me about your teammate.
Mendez: Tim Coleman. Newest boot. Two months in. Came right out of patrol. Best cop at Carson Station.
Brass: Well, I mean, he's got to be in shape. I heard your training's as tough as SWAT.
Mendez: SWAT's LAPD. We're S-E-S. We're better. Better conditioned, better prepared.  Those the best you got?
Brass: Yeah. Yeah. You got lucky.
Mendez:  Well, if they're not, I'll fly mine in.

Brass: Let me put it to you this way, I'd want them investigating my murder.


 
 
Robbins: Other than the fact that he's deceased, this guy is in excellent physical condition.
Grissom:  Except for that head wound.
Robbins: Eh, superficial. Could be from a fall. Your bloody rock may be incidental.
Grissom:  What about the bloody knuckles?
Robbins: Injury on the back of his hand. Maybe an altercation of some sort.
Grissom: So cause of death?
Robbins: No cerebral issues. No primary indicators.
Grissom: We go to the fallback position.
Robbins: Cardiac arrest.
Grissom: This guy was 25 years old.
Robbins: Didn't say I was finished. Clouded corneas tipped me off. Look at the liver.  His serosal surfaces are unusually dry. His urine was minimal and dark brown.
Grissom: Dehydration.
Robbins: Well, the race isn't the only reason these guys come to town. It's a good party.
Grissom: Too much running, too much partying?
Robbins: L.A. S-E-S. They go all out.
Grissom: Work hard, play hard, die young, leave a good-looking corpse.




Catherine: Grissom. 

Catherine: Tox came in. Tim Coleman had 75 mics per mil of furosemide in his system.
Grissom: Blood pressure medication? There's no history of that in his medical records.
Catherine: And it was a high dose, but not a lethal one.



Grissom: But it is a diuretic. Could explain the dehydration.
Catherine: And the drug can also cause muscle cramps, ... 

Catherine:  ... dizziness, confusion, blurred vision, restlessness.

Catherine: That could explain how Tim Coleman ended up where he did.
Grissom: How'd the furosemide get in his system in the first place?



Announcer:  Listen up, people. ... Are one hour out and the party's raging here at the finish line.

Will Warshall: Too bad you guys bet on the wrong horse.

Mendez: Maybe you forgot. One of our own died out there in the dirt.
Will Warshall: Yeah, I'll drink to his memory. You want to make the toast?
Catherine: Am I interrupting something?
Mendez: No.
Will Warshall: Later, Pogue.

Catherine: Um, are those bags brought in from the race?
Mendez: Yeah.
Catherine: I'm going to need Tim Coleman's.
Mendez: Sure. On the job, we come across a scene like this, we call them a bunch of degenerates. We'd be rounding half these guys up. I am not going to miss this.

Catherine: You're not going to miss the competition?
Mendez: I just made lieutenant. I got nothing to prove anymore.
Catherine: A man with nothing to prove. Now that would be a first.



Greg: Got a second?
Nick: Sure, what's up?
Greg: On a hunch, I ran a bank trace on Tim Coleman. I got a hit. A three hundred dollar withdrawal on his ATM card, 4:06 A.M. today.
Nick: That's about nine hours after he died. Good hunch, Greg-o.

Greg: Thanks.  I also got surveillance video from the bank.




Greg: This ATM's on the corner of Holyfield and Maryland parkway. Since that's definitely not Tim Coleman, maybe it's our killer.
Nick: Or at least, a thief. 
Greg: Well, all we got to do now is match a name with the face. Write up a description, send it off to dispatch for broadcast.

Nick: There might be an easier way.
Greg: Huh?

Greg: Fast 'n Fresh Burgers.





David Hodges:  This is the thread you pulled off the runner's body.
Grissom: Natural fiber?
David Hodges: Mercerized cotton. Extremely strong.

David Hodges:  Fibers are placed in a caustic solution, splitting the fibers apart and providing an increased surface area to absorb the dye. Once it dries, it's exponentially stronger.

David Hodges: This kind of thread is used in machine quilting and embroidery.
Grissom: Like on a sports uniforms.



Announcer:  Here they come, folks! It's still SWAT and SES fighting for the lead. 

Announcer:  It's down to SWAT and SES!

Announcer:  LAPD SWAT wins the first time in eight years. Coming in at 13 hours, 24 minutes.


FADE OUT



 
 
Runner #3: For the last six years, I ran the toughest leg of the relay ... against the same guy from SES.
Brass: But this year, there was a new guy.
Runner #3: Yeah, this cocky kid shows up.

Tim Coleman: You're my competition? I thought this was supposed to be the hardest leg.

Runner #3: Typical SES, all mouth.
Brass: What'd you do?
Runner #3: Ignored him.

Grissom: Looks like you got in a fight?
Runner #3: Hey, I was here to race. He cold-cocked me. I never threw a punch.
Grissom: We found red fibers on him that may match your jacket.
Runner #3: I'm SWAT. I subdued him.

Grissom: Mind if we take your jacket to confirm?

Runner #3: Knock yourself out. Not going to find any blood on it.





Nick: Had a real good talk with your manager, Clyde. How's Fast 'n Fresh treating you?
Clyde Grimes: I'm up to $8.75 an hour.
Nick: I guess this kind of beats saving up, huh?

Clyde Grimes: Look ... is my wife here?  Is she behind the glass or something?
Nick: I'll be talking to her soon enough.
Clyde Grimes: Oh, come on, now. Is that really necessary? I mean, I'm just a regular guy ...
Nick: Hey, regular guys don't steal $300 with a dead cop's ATM card, man!
Clyde Grimes: Dead cop?! What are you talking about? Those three bills -- that's-that's my money. All right, technically, it's my wife's, but ... I was about to go on my break anyway. My wife's not behind that glass, right?




Det. Vartann: Hotel security came up on a noise complaint. Found two DBs. Room's registered to a uniform officer, Manny Senteno.
Sara: One of ours?
Det. Vartann: Laughlin PD, but he carries tin, so that makes him family.



Det. Vartann: Female vic's Patricia Fielding. Also PD. Bakersfield.

Warrick: He check in alone?
Det. Vartann: Yeah, day before yesterday. Issued one key, but his itemized bill shows lots of room service for two.
Sara: A wife or girlfriend would probably be on the register.

Warrick: Looks like it's all his stuff. I don't see a purse around here. Guy's away from home, unwinds with some opportunity s*x ...  Looks like he came before he went.

Sara: Glock 19, standard police issue.

Sara: There's something on the slide.

Sara: Fourteen rounds left. Fifteen-round magazine.
Warrick: Any good cop keeps one racked in the chamber. Two bullets, two bodies.
(Quick flash to:  PATRICIA FIELDING points the gun at MANNY SENTENO.
Manny Senteno: Put it down!
Patricia Fielding: You dare me?! Put it down!


Warrick: I'm thinking straight-up murder/suicide.




Catherine: Tim Coleman's gear bag. Gym clothes, towel, vitamins, pocket knife.
Grissom: Protein bar wrapper, empty water bottle, banana peel. Why the trash?
Catherine: Well, you know, there's a five-minute penalty if you litter the race course.
Grissom: Oh. What's the best way to get chemicals into your system?
Catherine: Injection.
Grissom: But there was no evidence of that. Second best?
Catherine: Ingestion.





Grissom: Trace amounts of furosemide in his water bottle.
Catherine: Someone spiked his drink.



Catherine: Jim.
Brass: Will Warshall, this is Catherine Willows from the crime lab. 
Will Warshall: Hi. There is something very wrong in the world if a woman like you is only handling test tubes.
Catherine: Well, if you think that's all I handle, you're not as smart as you think. So, you're the L.A. County team medic, right? That means you're responsible for making sure that all your team mates are well hydrated.
Will Warshall: Yeah.
Catherine: Including Tim Coleman.
Will Warshall: Yeah. Hell of a thing, that. 
Brass: You're currently #1 on the SES's transfer list. Same spot you were two months ago when they bypassed you to transfer in Tim Coleman, right?
Will Warshall: Six months I'm on the top of the list. January 31 comes, and they reach over me and take Coleman.
Brass: That's the cutoff date to run in the race. Coleman was a ringer.
Will Warshall: Ding-ding. SES transferred him in for speed, not skill. Might not be another opening for years. I'm not getting any younger. And after all of that, Coleman doesn't even run.
Catherine: He had a good excuse. Did you give it to him?
Will Warshall: If I'm going to kill a guy, I'm not going to do it with twenty thousand cops around.
Catherine: Well ... sounds like you've been giving it some serious thought.
Will Warshall: Well, every cop does. My way? A sniper shot ... two hundred meters out. Coleman'd never even hear the &quot;am&quot; in &quot;blam.&quot;





Det. Vartann: Okay?

Det. Vartann: Mrs. Senteno, is this your husband?
Mrs. Senteno: He doesn't wear his hair like that.

Det. Vartann: There's some forms for you to sign, then we can talk in the lounge.

Mrs. Senteno: What happened?
Sara: Mrs. Senteno, we haven't finished our investigation yet, but your husband died from a gunshot wound.
Mrs. Senteno: Who shot him?
Sara: We don't know.
Mrs. Senteno: Where was he found?
Sara: In his hotel room.

Mrs. Senteno: He wasn't alone, was he?
Sara: No.
Mrs. Senteno: I married a cop. With that comes alcohol and women to take the edge off. First time ... he said it meant nothing. He promised never to do it again. By the third time ... I told him to stop confessing. I wasn't going anywhere.
Sara: Don't ask, don't tell.
Mrs. Senteno: I wasn't willing to trade my family for the flavor of the month. That doesn't make me pathetic.



Warrick: What happened? Break the bad news to the wife?
Sara: Oh, I didn't have to.
Warrick: Women always know, huh?
Sara: Not always.
Warrick: I think so. Women always know when the man is straying.
Sara: What are you, the voice of experience?
Warrick:  No. I'm a really nice guy.
Sara: Oh, I believe you.

Warrick: Well, you need to believe this. There was one bullet in each of the bodies. They both came from the glock. And the prints on the glock are from a female, so it's still looking like a murder/suicide.

Sara: All right. 


Sara: Hey. You anywhere on my fibers?

David Hodges: I'm dealing with a lot of things today. My phone has been ringing off the hook. CSI is taking a ton of crap because we didn't finish the race. 
Sara: There was a dead cop in the desert.
David Hodges: That's what I kept telling them, and they tell me, &quot;good excuse.&quot;
 The white fibers found on the gun slide is tissue: The common nose-picking variety with gun oil residue.
Sara: Are you saying that the gun was wiped down and the prints were planted?

David Hodges: No, you're saying that. I don't get to say that. But somebody else could've pulled the trigger.

FADE OUT


;



 
 
Jacqui Franco: Manny Senteno's prints are all over the room, including the champagne bottle and one of the glasses.
Sara: What about Patricia Fielding's?
Jacqui Franco: Hotel room door, inside knob. And the murder weapon.
Sara: That's it?  Are you sure?
 
Sara: I-I'm sorry. It just doesn't make any sense. The s*x kits came back negative, and now this. I mean, that room reeked of musk.
Jacqui Franco: Well, maybe he swapped fluids with someone else. There was a third set of prints. I ran it through AFIS. Got a hit on a cop. Another one.
Sara: Lydia Lopez, Bakersfield PD. That's the same division as Patricia Fielding's.



Catherine: Well, according to histology, Tim Coleman's muscle cells were hyper-hydrated, yet his body was dehydrated.
Grissom: Well, that condition's normally associated with drug abuse.
Catherine: Right. But apart from the furosemide, his tox was negative. So, I took another look at the guy.
 
Catherine: Buff, cut, aggressive. Made me think steroids.
Grissom: Kind of risky for a cop, considering they're subject to random drug tests.
Catherine: Well, steroids are controlled, but creatine isn't. It's a legal way to bulk up.

Drugs Level
Analyses Found
-------- ------
Steroids Negative
Creatine Positive
Catherine: Tim Coleman was using it. Creatine pulls the potassium from the blood and moves it into the muscles.

Grissom: Dehydrating the body in the process.
Catherine: Exactly. And you add furosemide to it, and you get a severe electrolyte imbalance.
Grissom: Leading to arrhythmia, and consequently cardiac arrest.

Grissom: So, what's our problem?
Catherine: The dose.  There wasn't enough furosemide in the water to make that happen.



Warrick: Lydia Lopez -- the girl next door.

Sara: CSI. Hello.  Her division captain wants every professional courtesy extended to her.

Sara: Interesting.

Warrick: Yeah. Her clothes are still here. But I guess if you offed two people, you're not going to stick around to pack.

Sara: Adjoining door's open. Maybe they wanted it that way.
Warrick: So, Manny and Lydia were boning. How does Patricia Fielding fit in?
Sara: I don't know. Isn't the prevailing male fantasy two on one?
Warrick:  So, let's say three of them were going at it. How did two out of three end up dead?
Sara: Well, if Lydia said no, and Manny went for it anyway ...

Warrick: Well, someone was pissed. This is, like, a two- $300 la Perla Nightie, ripped to shreds.
Sara: Oh, looks comfortable.
Warrick: It's not designed to stay on that long.

Sara: This is a man's wedding ring.

Warrick: Yeah.

Warrick: Manny was wearing a ring. Was Lydia Lopez married?
Sara: I'll ask her. She walked into LVPD ten minutes ago.



Lydia Lopez: My C.O. calls and tells me that Patty Fielding's been murdered, and you're about to broadcast a citywide for my twenty. What the hell's going on in this town?
Det. Vartann: That's what we'd like to know. I hope you've got your story straight.
Lydia Lopez: Didn't know I needed one.

Sara: Patricia Fielding was killed in the room adjoining yours.
Lydia Lopez: Manny's room? Where's Manny?
Sara: Manny's on a slab next to Patricia.

Sara: Look, we know that you and Manny were together.
Lydia Lopez: Once a year for seven years running. Desert relay is our time together. Then we go back to our lives.
Det. Vartann: That's sweet. What was Sergeant Fielding doing in your lover's room?
Lydia Lopez: I don't know.
Det. Vartann: You don't know. You know, I heard that Manny Senteno was a real player. Maybe he moved on, and you didn't like that.
Lydia Lopez: Who told you that? Manny doesn't mess around.
Sara: Except with you.
Lydia Lopez: Yes.
Sara: How could you know that if the only part you know is his body?
Lydia Lopez: Pedestal's a little high, don't you think?
Sara: Your best friend, your lover are dead. What do you expect me to think?
Lydia Lopez: I don't know what happened. I do know that Manny loves his wife just like I love my husband. It's just an itch we scratched every twelve months. It doesn't mean anything.
Sara: It meant enough to someone to trash your room.
Lydia Lopez: Archie.
Det. Vartann: Archie -- your husband.
Lydia Lopez: Mm-hmm.
Det. Vartann: Did he catch the two of you together?
Lydia Lopez: No. He wasn't even supposed to be in Vegas. This is my time. And I heard he was looking for me. He must've got a key from the front desk. Probably took one look at the room and went ballistic. Did you see what he did to my teddy? That was Archie's gift to me.
Det. Vartann: Hey, most husbands who buy lingerie expect that they're the ones who're going to be enjoying it.
Lydia Lopez: I look good in it. Archie didn't do this. He couldn't.



Nick: The manager says Clyde Grimes took a break around three. That's consistent with bank records. Three hundred dollar withdraw to Clyde's account registered at 3:06.
Greg: But the video shows him using Tim Coleman's card at 4:06.
Nick: Yeah, one hour later.
Greg: Well, maybe I'm not the only one who gets screwed up by daylight savings time. What if the ATM and the camera were out of synch?
Nick: How? The camera's part of the ATM.
Greg: Video is controlled by the branch office. ATM connects to the national network. Separate systems. If the clocks weren't synchronized ...
Nick: Then the guy who used Tim Coleman's card should be on video one hour later.


Nick: He's, uh, emptying the ATM.

Nick: Well, Mr. Drake. I suppose this is one way to make eight years in an injection molding factory pay off. You're certainly good with plastics.


(Quick flashback to:  Someone inserts an ATM card in the slot.
Nick:  It was a good scam. Your reader transmits the card number to you, and the camera records the sucker's pin number.


Mr. Drake: I should have used better transmitters. I wouldn't have had to stick so close.
Nick: You raked in over $13,000 off 62 skimmed accounts.
Mr. Drake: That was just the first two days.
Nick: And I checked the bank records. All of the cards you stole belonged to cops.
Mr. Drake: I know. You know, I'm facing multiple felony counts here. Comprehensive theft, card fraud. I'm going away for years. But when I got booked, they wrote me up for two moving violations. I hate cops.




Det. Vartann: I picked up Lydia Lopez's husband at Cheetah's. He was groping the strippers. Classic drunk-and-disorderly. When I got there, the bouncer was just about to tune him up.
Warrick: For what?
Det. Vartann: Yakking on his suit.



Det. Vartann: Archie Lopez.
Archie Lopez: So what?
Warrick: Your prints were found in your wife's hotel room, including the doorknob to the adjoining room.
Archie Lopez: Yeah.
Det. Vartann: Patricia Fielding was killed in that room. So was Manny Senteno.
Archie Lopez: Hmm. My heart bleeds.
Warrick: Are you still drunk?

Archie Lopez: Yeah, I'm probably still drunk, yeah. Must have been the tequila. I don't drink that much.
Warrick: Well, it takes a lot of drinking to forget a murder. I didn't kill anyone.

Archie Lopez:  I wanted to surprise Lydia. Manager gave me a key.


Archie Lopez: And then I left.
Det. Vartann: Where did you go?
Archie Lopez: I went to the hotel bar.

Archie Lopez:  That's where I saw Patty.

Archie Lopez: That woman's been to my house. She's eaten my food. She smiled in my face, all the time ... all the time knowing that Lydia was banging someone else.
Warrick: So, where did you go then?
Archie Lopez: I went somewhere else. I drank some more. I drank ... a lot, I guess. I don't ... I don't remember anything.
Warrick: We're going to need your clothes.

Catherine: Backwash.

 
 





Mendez: You know, I don't appreciate being kept in the dark this long.
Brass: We don't release details of our investigation until we're sure of our facts. Now we're sure. 
Catherine: Tim Coleman died of a drug-induced cardiac arrest.
Mendez: If I'd known he was on drugs, he'd never have gotten into SES.
Catherine: Actually, he was only on one drug. Creatine. You made it plural. You gave him a protein bar that was laced with furosemide.

Mendez: Hey, you got to keep up your strength. Don't make us look bad.

Catherine: The combination of the two drugs is what killed him.
Mendez: I want my union rep.
Brass: That's your right.
Catherine: We're going to need to see your pocketknife.
Brass: On the table, please.

Sara: It must be very hard to hear that your husband's been cheating on you.

Mrs. Senteno: We've been through this. I didn't care about Manny's indiscretions.
Sara: Even when you hear about it from the other woman's husband? Archie Lopez called you.
Mrs. Senteno: So I talked to him on the phone. He was drunk. He was raving. I didn't understand half of what he said.
Sara: I think you heard him loud and clear. You got in your car, and you tore ass to Vegas.
Mrs. Senteno: I was in Laughlin with my son.
Det. Vartann: Highway patrol caught you speeding on interstate 15. Southbound. Most cops won't issue tickets to fellow cops families. Professional courtesy.
Sara: But your tag still gets logged. You were leaving Las Vegas before you even found out that your husband was dead.
Mrs. Senteno: I don't understand what you're talking about.
Sara: Yeah, you do.
(Quick flashback to:  PATRICIA FIELDING is standing near the door when MRS. SENTENO rushes into the room. She sees her husband standing bare-chested near the bed.
Mrs. Senteno: Oh, you b*st*rd!
Manny Senteno: It's not what you think.

Manny Senteno: Wait. Wait.


Mrs. Senteno: You can't prove that.
Sara: Well, that's why we got a warrant to search your house.

Sara: And we found Patricia Fielding's blood in the lining of your purse. From the tissue that you used to wipe the gun.
 


Mrs. Senteno: She was nothing. He jeopardized our family for that?
Det. Vartann: Not for her.
Sara: Patricia wasn't the one having the affair with your husband.
Mrs. Senteno: Oh.  I caught her with him. She answered the door like she belonged there.
Sara: Mrs. Senteno, you killed the wrong woman.

Manny Senteno:  Wendy, it's not what you think.






Mendez: Where's your kit?
Grissom: Actually, we have all the evidence we need.
Mendez: Then what the hell are you doing here?
Grissom: I have a question. Off the record.

Grissom: Sooner or later, everybody gets replaced.
Mendez: Talk to me when it happens to you.

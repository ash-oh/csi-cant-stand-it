<p>[EXT. DESERT -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Open on a dark screen.)</p>
<p>CUE MUSIC</p>
<p>(Off in the distance, we make out the horizon. Just beyond that is the faint impression of lights approaching in the distance.)</p>
<p>(The lights arrive. They bounce up and down in the night. More lights appear showing us a group of people far off in the distance carrying flashlights and running.) </p>
<p>(From up above, a search light from a flying helicopter appears to be shining down on the approaching group of people. As the people get closer, we see added red and blue lights in the background from police officer cars slowly following them.) </p>
<p>(Leading the way are two police officers on motor bikes. Following the motorbikes is the group of runners.) </p>
<p>(They get closer to the camera, we see that they are Desert runners out on a competitive run. The first wave of runners pass the camera. The middle of the group approaches. Taking up the rear are eight police cars. The last plane car carries a sign on its roof: THE LAW ENFORCEMENT DESERT RELAY.) </p>
<p>(It's a healthy group of people running a relay. The approaching group heads toward the second group, in the runners grips are their batons.) </p>
<p>(In this current group, SARA holds the baton as she runs.) </p>
<p>(One by one, runners hand off their baton to the next runner up on deck.) </p>
<p>(SARA hands off to NICK, #88. He grabs the baton and takes off. SARA finishes her leg of the race and catches GREG in a hug as she comes to a stop.) </p>
<p>(NICK takes off. Several dissolves shows him running, grabbing a water bottle off the water stand for hydration and continuing his run.) </p>
<p>(Dissolve to: WARRICK runs the next leg.) </p>
<p>(Dissolve to: An overhead shot of the race as it continues.) </p>
<p>(The opening music fades and the sounds of the helicopter flying overhead takes over.)</p>
<p>(Dissolve to: CATHERINE runs the next leg of the race to sounds of Vangeliss'<br />
&quot;Chariots of Fire&quot;. She glances over at GRISSOM driving the car next to her.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (irritated) What the hell kind of music is that?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Inspiration.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Sedative.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(He changes the radio station and a country song plays.)</p>
<p><strong>Lyric</strong>: Sitting single / drinking double ... </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How's this?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: How about something that doesn't twang?</p>
<p>(He changes the station once more.)</p>
<p><strong>Lyric</strong>: I said are you gonna be my girl? </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Better.</p>
<p>(Rock music plays and CATHERINE continues to run. Off in the distance, a flashing red light catches GRISSOM'S attention.)</p>
<p><strong>Lyric</strong>: one, two, three, take my hand and come with me / because you look so fine / that I really wanna make you mine / I say you look so fine... </p>
<p>(CATHERINE continues to run straight ahead as GRISSOM turns the car and makes his way toward the flashing red light. CATHERINE stops) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (shouts) Hey, Grissom!</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes off.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Grissom!</p>
<p>(CATHERINE stops running and watches as GRISSOM speeds off and away, a cloud of dust in his wake.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE sighs and takes off after him.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Grissom!</p>
<p>(Cut to: GRISSOM stands just outside his parked car. He shines his flashlight down on the ground in front of his feet looking at something.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (panting) Gris-s-som!</p>
<p>(She falls against the park car, pissed more than ever at him.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: God! What, are you taking a leak? </p>
<p>(She limps over to him, still not seeing what he's looking at.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (angry) The follow car is supposed to stay with the runner. We've been training for months, man. Twenty CSIs. A hundred twenty miles.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Don't blame me. Blame him.</p>
<p>(He points to the dead body in front of him.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I saw his flasher from the road.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE immediately goes into work mode.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Good call.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Fresh cut on his forehead. But the corneas usually take days to gloss over.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Weird. The race just started. </p>
<p>(They both kneel next to the body. CATHERINE reads the badge patch on the dead runner's jacket.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: L.A. County PD. Special Enforcement Squad. Badass. Hardcore badass. Give me some more light here.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM shines the flashlight on the dead body's knuckles.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: That looks like a recent injury. There's no scab. Fight?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Would you give me your phone?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM hands CATHERINE his cell phone. She makes a call.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to phone) Uh ... Uh, this is CSI Willows. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM notes the dead body's runner's number plate, 3.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to phone) I'm at highway 160, halfway through leg 16 of the Desert Relay. We got a 419, officer down. Notify Captain Brass.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM sees a fiber just barely latched onto the dead body's outfit and flapping in the wind. GRISSOM grabs it and looks at it in his flashlight. She hangs up.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Barehanded, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, collect it or lose it. Ten years ago nobody would've known the difference.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Ten years ago we wouldn't have been able to get DNA off that fiber.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'll find something in the car to bindle it.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Time of discovery: 4:32. I'll put it in the report.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE exhales.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So much for the race.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, at least we didn't come in last.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. DESERT -- DAY] </p>
<p>(The wind blows the sand away from a shoe print as CATHERINE tries to take a picture of it. DAVID PHILLIPS is with the body logging in the necessary information.) </p>
<p>(Down below on the main road, runners continue to pass by.) </p>
<p>(GREG stands nearby as he draws the crime scene noting the &quot;power tower&quot;, the<br />
&quot;clearing&quot; and the distance from the road (69'-3&quot;).)</p>
<p>(On the side, BRASS talks with DET. VARTAN.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE tries to snap the photo of the shoe print. She lifts the camera, looks at the print, puts the camera down and sighs. GRISSOM is looking at something on the ground nearby.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So much for that shoe print.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM notes the red stain on the underside of a rock.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This could be blood on this rock.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM reaches for a bag.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: How many cops are in town this weekend?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Twenty thousand. And the road is closed to civilians.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Spring break with a badge. (GRISSOM bags the rock.) Well, this ought to be fun. Every suspect's in law enforcement.</p>
<p>(Meanwhile, DAVID PHILLIPS finds a receipt in the dead body's pants pocket. He tucks it in a plastic bag. GREG continues drawing the scene. Next to them is LT. MENDEZ. He stands over them watching them processes the crime scene.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: So, how was your run?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I'm still alive.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: That's everything. </p>
<p>(DAVID PHILLIPS hands the bag of contents to GREG. GREG takes the bag and looks at the receipt for a $300.00 ATM withdrawal on 04/27/04 from: </p>
<p>FIRST MONUMENT BANK</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: ATM receipt. No card, no cash?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Well, he was in a race.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Maybe someone took his wallet.</p>
<p>(BRASS talks with LT. MENDEZ.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, Lieutenant Mendez, tell me about your teammate.</p>
<p><strong>Mendez</strong>: Tim Coleman. Newest boot. Two months in. Came right out of patrol. Best cop at Carson Station.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, I mean, he's got to be in shape. I heard your training's as tough as SWAT.</p>
<p><strong>Mendez</strong>: SWAT's LAPD. We're S-E-S. We're better. Better conditioned, better prepared. (He points to GRISSOM &amp; his team working the crime scene.) Those the best you got?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah. Yeah. You got lucky.</p>
<p><strong>Mendez</strong>: (helpfully offers) Well, if they're not, I'll fly mine in.</p>
<p>(BRASS chuckles.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Let me put it to you this way, I'd want them investigating my murder.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(DR. ROBBINS goes over his preliminary findings with GRISSOM as they both stand around the body on the table.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Other than the fact that he's deceased, this guy is in excellent physical condition.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (points) Except for that head wound.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Eh, superficial. Could be from a fall. Your bloody rock may be incidental.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (points) What about the bloody knuckles?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Injury on the back of his hand. Maybe an altercation of some sort.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So cause of death?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: No cerebral issues. No primary indicators.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We go to the fallback position.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Cardiac arrest.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This guy was 25 years old.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Didn't say I was finished. Clouded corneas tipped me off. Look at the liver. (He hands the metal dish with the organ inside to GRISSOM. Camera zooms in for a close up.) His serosal surfaces are unusually dry. His urine was minimal and dark brown.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Dehydration.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Well, the race isn't the only reason these guys come to town. It's a good party.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Too much running, too much partying?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: L.A. S-E-S. They go all out.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Work hard, play hard, die young, leave a good-looking corpse.</p>
<p>(Camera holds on the body on the table.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY - DAY]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM enters the hallway looking through a file folder.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Grissom. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE joins him and they continue walking down the hall.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Tox came in. Tim Coleman had 75 mics per mil of furosemide in his system.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Blood pressure medication? There's no history of that in his medical records.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And it was a high dose, but not a lethal one.</p>
<p>(They walk into GRISSOM'S office.)</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - GRISSOM'S OFFICE - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM leans back against his desk.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: But it is a diuretic. Could explain the dehydration.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And the drug can also cause muscle cramps, ... </p>
<p>(Quick flash to: [EXT. DESERT - NIGHT] A lone runner is confused and running in the desert.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) ... dizziness, confusion, blurred vision, restlessness.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: That could explain how Tim Coleman ended up where he did.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How'd the furosemide get in his system in the first place?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE shrugs.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. - DAY]</p>
<p><strong>Announcer</strong>: (over P.A.) Listen up, people. ... Are one hour out and the party's raging here at the finish line.</p>
<p>(WILL WARSHALL walks up to MENDEZ.)</p>
<p><strong>Will Warshall</strong>: Too bad you guys bet on the wrong horse.</p>
<p>(MENDEZ throws his drink to the side, offended.)</p>
<p><strong>Mendez</strong>: Maybe you forgot. One of our own died out there in the dirt.</p>
<p><strong>Will Warshall</strong>: Yeah, I'll drink to his memory. You want to make the toast?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Am I interrupting something?</p>
<p><strong>Mendez</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Will Warshall</strong>: Later, Pogue.</p>
<p>(WILL WARSHALL walks away. CATHERINE nods toward the bags.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Um, are those bags brought in from the race?</p>
<p><strong>Mendez</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm going to need Tim Coleman's.</p>
<p><strong>Mendez</strong>: Sure. On the job, we come across a scene like this, we call them a bunch of degenerates. We'd be rounding half these guys up. I am not going to miss this.</p>
<p>(He takes a drink out of his beer bottle.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You're not going to miss the competition?</p>
<p><strong>Mendez</strong>: I just made lieutenant. I got nothing to prove anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: A man with nothing to prove. Now that would be a first.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY - DAY]</p>
<p>(NICK is walking through the hallway when GREG catches up with him.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Got a second?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Sure, what's up?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: On a hunch, I ran a bank trace on Tim Coleman. I got a hit. A three hundred dollar withdrawal on his ATM card, 4:06 A.M. today.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: That's about nine hours after he died. Good hunch, Greg-o.</p>
<p>(GREG stops walking; NICK continues down the hallway.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Thanks. (beat) I also got surveillance video from the bank.</p>
<p>(NICK stops in his tracks.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - AUDIO/VISUAL LAB - LATER]</p>
<p>(GREG shows NICK the video of ATM #94286 from Holyfield/Maryland Pkwy at 4:06 a.m.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: This ATM's on the corner of Holyfield and Maryland parkway. Since that's definitely not Tim Coleman, maybe it's our killer.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Or at least, a thief. </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, all we got to do now is match a name with the face. Write up a description, send it off to dispatch for broadcast.</p>
<p>(GREG starts to write out the forms. NICK looks at the video and sees something in the background.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: There might be an easier way.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p>(NICK points to the sign at the establishment across the street.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Fast 'n Fresh Burgers.</p>
<p>(NICK then points to the MAN'S shirt with the matching logo.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - TRACE LAB - DAY]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks through the scope.)</p>
<p>(Scope view. Camera pushes in through the scope at the fiber magnified.)</p>
<p><strong>David Hodges</strong>: (V.O.) This is the thread you pulled off the runner's body.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Natural fiber?</p>
<p><strong>David Hodges</strong>: Mercerized cotton. Extremely strong.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV to: A close up of the fiber in a red background liquid solution which is drawn into the fiber.)</p>
<p><strong>David Hodges</strong>: (V.O.) Fibers are placed in a caustic solution, splitting the fibers apart and providing an increased surface area to absorb the dye. Once it dries, it's exponentially stronger.</p>
<p>(End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>David Hodges</strong>: This kind of thread is used in machine quilting and embroidery.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Like on a sports uniforms.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY]</p>
<p>(The crowd cheers as the runners slowly reach the finish line.)</p>
<p><strong>Announcer</strong>: (over P.A.) Here they come, folks! It's still SWAT and SES fighting for the lead. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM makes his way through the crowd. He watches as two runners, numbers 3 and 2, race to be the first over the finish line.)</p>
<p><strong>Announcer</strong>: (over P.A.) It's down to SWAT and SES!</p>
<p>(The crowd cheers as runner #3 makes it over the finish line first. The time clock reads: 13:24:00.52.)</p>
<p><strong>Announcer</strong>: (over P.A.) LAPD SWAT wins the first time in eight years. Coming in at 13 hours, 24 minutes.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM watches as runner #3 celebrates with his team mates and other people from the division. He looks carefully at the runner's jacket and notes the red embroidery.)</p>
<p>(He smiles.)</p>
<p>FADE OUT</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. PARKING LOT -- DAY] </p>
<p>(GRISSOM interviews RUNNER #3.) </p>
<p><strong>Runner #3</strong>: For the last six years, I ran the toughest leg of the relay ... against the same guy from SES.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: But this year, there was a new guy.</p>
<p><strong>Runner #3</strong>: Yeah, this cocky kid shows up.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [NIGHT] As RUNNER #3 warms up, TIM COLEMAN walks up to him to psych him out.)</p>
<p><strong>Tim Coleman</strong>: You're my competition? I thought this was supposed to be the hardest leg.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Runner #3</strong>: Typical SES, all mouth.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What'd you do?</p>
<p><strong>Runner #3</strong>: Ignored him.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM notes RUNNER #3's head wound.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Looks like you got in a fight?</p>
<p><strong>Runner #3</strong>: Hey, I was here to race. He cold-cocked me. I never threw a punch.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We found red fibers on him that may match your jacket.</p>
<p><strong>Runner #3</strong>: I'm SWAT. I subdued him.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [EXT. NIGHT] RUNNER #3 and TIM COLEMAN are fist fighting. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mind if we take your jacket to confirm?</p>
<p>(He removes his jacket and gives it to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Runner #3</strong>: Knock yourself out. Not going to find any blood on it.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM notes the frayed embroidery on the jacket.)</p>

<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: I picked up Lydia Lopez's husband at Cheetah's. He was groping the strippers. Classic drunk-and-disorderly. When I got there, the bouncer was just about to tune him up.</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Are you still drunk?</p>
<p>(He laughs.)</p>
<p><strong>Archie Lopez</strong>: Yeah, I'm probably still drunk, yeah. Must have been the tequila. I don't drink that much.</p>

<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So, where did you go then?</p>
<p><strong>Archie Lopez</strong>: I went somewhere else. I drank some more. I drank ... a lot, I guess. I don't ... I don't remember anything.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Tim Coleman died of a drug-induced cardiac arrest.</p>
<p><strong>Mendez</strong>: If I'd known he was on drugs, he'd never have gotten into SES.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Actually, he was only on one drug. Creatine. You made it plural. You gave him a protein bar that was laced with furosemide.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [RACE NIGHT] LT MENDEZ walks up to TIM COLEMAN and gives him the candy bar.)</p>
<p><strong>Mendez</strong>: Hey, you got to keep up your strength. Don't make us look bad.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Archie Lopez's clothes are negative for GSR and blood.</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What do guys do when they're drunk, and they have a number burning a hole in their pocket?</p>

<p>(MRS. SENTENO glances from SARA to DET. VARTAN.)</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Senteno</strong>: We've been through this. I didn't care about Manny's indiscretions.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Even when you hear about it from the other woman's husband? Archie Lopez called you.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Senteno</strong>: So I talked to him on the phone. He was drunk. He was raving. I didn't understand half of what he said.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I think you heard him loud and clear. You got in your car, and you tore ass to Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Senteno</strong>: I was in Laughlin with my son.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Highway patrol caught you speeding on interstate 15. Southbound. Most cops won't issue tickets to fellow cops families. Professional courtesy.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: But your tag still gets logged. You were leaving Las Vegas before you even found out that your husband was dead.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I have a question. Off the record.</p>
<p><strong>Mendez</strong>: I wasn't trying to kill him.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Then why did you do this?</p>
<p><strong>Mendez</strong>: Leg 16 was mine. I ran it eight years in a row. I won every time. Then the bosses transfer in that kid, kick me upstairs, and give him my race. No way I was going to let him do better than me.</p>

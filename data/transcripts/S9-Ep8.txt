<p>Stop! Stop! You're killing me!</p>
<p>* All who love... *</p>
<p>Are you freaking deaf?!</p>
<p>I said stop! Kill the playback!</p>
<p>Look, this might win second prize at the talent contest at Spiro Agnew High School in Bad Limp, Arkansas.</p>
<p>Hey, Drew.</p>
<p>It's not my kid's fault.</p>
<p>Who let Daddy Dearest on the stage?</p>
<p>I gave specific orders...</p>
<p>Everybody's moving around like there's nothing important going on!</p>
<p>How about a little respect, okay?</p>
<p>Except for your kid doesn't deserve respect.</p>
<p>Lazy little prima donna.</p>
<p>Maybe you should sit with the losers.</p>
<p>Let me try it again.</p>
<p>You don't care.</p>
<p>I do so care.</p>
<p>This isn't a game to me, all right?</p>
<p>I'm a good singer.</p>
<p>It's all I ever wanted to do, and you have no right to...</p>
<p>There! That passion.</p>
<p>That's what I want to see when you sing.</p>
<p>Now, let's do it again.</p>
<p>And watch your pitch, baby.</p>
<p>Too early in the day to be that flat.</p>
<p>I know I wasn't flat.</p>
<p>Hang in there.</p>
<p>Oh, yes, you were.</p>
<p>The name of this show is Overnight Sensation.</p>
<p>For God sakes, show me something sensational!</p>
<p>Playback!</p>
<p>♪ When you're... ♪</p>
<p>Flat!</p>

♪ Smoke gets in your eyes... ♪</p>

<p>I can't take this!</p>
<p>You tell us to feel everything, but you don't feel anything.</p>
<p>I can't... I can't do this.</p>
<p>Layla.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Rehearsal's not over.</p>
<p>Layla! Layla, wait!</p>
<p>Playback!</p>
<p>♪ They asked me how I knew ♪<br />
♪ My true love was true ♪<br />
♪ Oh... ♪</p>
<p>Liver temp puts T.O.D. between 2:00 and 4:00 a.m.</p>
<p>She was Lindsey's favorite on the show.</p>
<p>We voted for her six times last week.</p>
<p>They make it to Vegas for the finals.</p>
<p>Every kid watching wants to be them. It just...</p>
<p>It shouldn't end like this.</p>
<p>Glamorous makeup.</p>
<p>Fancy lingerie.</p>
<p>s*x fetish that went too far?</p>
<p>Perverted idol worship?</p>
<p>Wholesome all-American girl.</p>
<p>Did you do an SAE kit?</p>
<p>Not yet.</p>
<p>Shmay have gotten what she wished for-- she's an overnight sensation now.</p>
<p>?????? perversity of this business that the ratings will be through the roof on our final show.</p>
<p>So, as a tribute to Layla, let's do what she'd want us to do.</p>
<p>Let's make it our best show ever, okay?</p>
<p>Rehearsal!</p>
<p>Excuse me?</p>
<p>You're Drew Rich, the producer?</p>
<p>Who are you?</p>
<p>I'm Detective Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police.</p>
<p>We're trying to confirm the whereabouts of Layla Wells last night.</p>
<p>Can you help us?</p>
<p>She left rehearsal last night around 7:00.</p>
<p>Went back to her room, as far as I know.</p>
<p>Chaperone says she called at midnight, said she was going to bed.</p>
<p>Where's the chaperone?</p>
<p>Fired her this morning.</p>
<p>Obviously, she wasn't doing her job.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Layla's an emancipated minor, but her chaperone's supposed to be looking out for her, not pumping per diem into a slot machine all night.</p>
<p>This means you won, Kip.</p>
<p>You're the champion.</p>
<p>No, he's not.</p>
<p>Ajaya!</p>
<p>Last one voted off.</p>
<p>You're back on against Kip.</p>
<p>We're gonna need contact information from Miss Wells's family.</p>
<p>Michelle can get it to you.</p>
<p>Now, I have a show to produce.</p>
<p>Call editing.</p>
<p>I want a DVD of every frame we have on Layla on my desk, one hour.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>If this was a killer that fetishized her, why not just dump the body?</p>
<p>Why bother to wrap her up?</p>
<p>To conceal the body during transport from the primary.</p>
<p>It's consistent with those knots being tied into a handle.</p>
<p>You know, the looping here looks like a reef knot.</p>
<p>Might be looking for somebody with some sailing experience.</p>
<p>&quot;Rancho Linen Service.&quot;</p>
<p>They deliver to every hotel on the Strip.</p>
<p>Been around since Bugsy Siegel's days.</p>
<p>Which is probably the last time this tablecloth was washed.</p>
<p>These discolorations suggest that this has been on somebody's table a long time.</p>
<p>What was Layla doing here?</p>
<p>She had a great room at the Palermo, people waiting on her day and night.</p>
<p>You ever been in one of those suites?</p>
<p>Just to get evidence.</p>
<p>I sure wouldn't leave there for... whatever this is.</p>
<p>Couple of blood drops.</p>
<p>There's no trail.</p>
<p>Probably dripped through the cloth.</p>
<p>These wheel tracks are 11 inches apart.</p>
<p>It couldn't have been a grocery cart.</p>
<p>The front wheels are narrower than the back, so it would've left two different sets of tracks.</p>
<p>Something tells me a guy pushing any kind of cart in this area wouldn't be that unusual.</p>
<p>That blunt-force trauma just below the rib cage is your C.O.D.</p>
<p>Lacerated the liver.</p>
<p>Hangs lower when the body's upright.</p>
<p>Since no ribs were impacted, she was standing when the blow occurred.</p>
<p>Death would have occurred fairly quickly.</p>
<p>Any indication of sexual assault?</p>
<p>No. However, when I was doing the internal exam, I found an embryo implanted in the uterine wall, maybe 20 millimeters long.</p>
<p>She was pregnant.</p>
<p>About eight weeks.</p>
<p>I sent cord tissue to DNA.</p>
<p>So maybe this isn't just a case of negligent chaperone.</p>
<p>Maybe it's motive.</p>
<p>Got a reading?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, the Lock Interrogator says that Layla last used her key card to enter her room at 7:12 p.m.</p>
<p>That's right after she walked out of rehearsal.</p>
<p>Hm.</p>
<p>Now, according to the hotel phone records, she made two calls-- one to Drew Rich's room around 7:34 p.m.</p>
<p>Probably to apologize.</p>
<p>And the other one to her chaperone to say good night around midnight.</p>
<p>Went to voice mail.</p>
<p>Casino surveillance says that the chaperone stayed up all night trying to win a progressive.</p>
<p>From about 8:00 on, she was looking up abortion clinics.</p>
<p>It looks like she had a change of heart; started checking out adoption agencies.</p>
<p>Huh.</p>
<p>Sounds like a confused kid.</p>
<p>?????</p>
<p>Well, it looks like they're a cute couple, I'll give you that, but what I don't get is why anybody wants to watch that show-- I don't.</p>
<p>It's a talent contest?</p>
<p>It's more like a humiliation ritual.</p>
<p>Well, you'd know about that.</p>
<p>All right. So, you want to know why that kid Ajaya with the fluffy hair, sings like a hinge, why he got into the semifinals?</p>
<p>Me and 10,000 other guys vote for him every week on the Internet.</p>
<p>But if you don't watch, how do you know about him?</p>
<p>Oh, you know, water cooler talk, gossip.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Here's something the gossips don't have.</p>
<p>Okay, there's the humiliator.</p>
<p>Layla left the Palermo, too, just after midnight.</p>
<p>Two minutes later...</p>
<p>Kip follows.</p>
<p>It must've been pretty hard for you and Layla to find some time together.</p>
<p>You know, can't get your mojo workin' when Daddy's lurkin'.</p>
<p>So what did you do?</p>
<p>You waited till midnight, Dad's asleep, and you take separate elevators down... then what?</p>
<p>Layla was found in a pretty tough neighborhood.</p>
<p>What were you doing over there, scoring drugs?</p>
<p>He doesn't do drugs.</p>
<p>Or maybe it was to get a back-alley abortion.</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>Layla was eight weeks pregnant-- am I right?</p>
<p>And who's the daddy?</p>
<p>You?</p>
<p>The hell it was.</p>
<p>I'm not talking to you.</p>
<p>Kip...</p>
<p>Just shut up. Just... shut up.</p>
<p>We're going to need a DNA sample.</p>
<p>No way.</p>
<p>You're done abusing my kid.</p>
<p>And so are you. Sit down.</p>
<p>Take him out in the hall.</p>
<p>You can't do this.</p>
<p>Dad... check it out.</p>
<p>I've got you and Kip returning to the hotel after the time of the murder.</p>
<p>You're like a team, right?</p>
<p>You're in it together, 50-50.</p>
<p>You know, the contest, the career, and future earnings.</p>
<p>It's a lot of money.</p>
<p>And that's what this is about, right? The money?</p>
<p>30 million people tune in to hear my kid sing every week.</p>
<p>How many people want to watch you?</p>
<p>So you're on the road four months?</p>
<p>How'd you work that out with your job?</p>
<p>I took aeave of absence.</p>
<p>Come on, sailor, you abandoned ship.</p>
<p>You quit your job, got a second mortgage on your house.</p>
<p>If Kip screws up, you're wiped out, so I can understand how you'd cover up for him, and maybe you're even desperate enough to kill her yourself.</p>
<p>♪♪♪♪♪</p>
<p>I subtracted out the mother's profile, leaving what has to be the father's contribution, and it didn't match the sample from Kip Westerman.</p>
<p>So he's not the father of Layla's baby.</p>
<p>No, but then I ran those alleles through CODIS and...</p>
<p>I got a hit.</p>
<p>Marvin Fleck.</p>
<p>In the system from charges in North Carolina in 2002.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Do you recognize Marvin?</p>
<p>Drew Rich?</p>
<p>Yeah, he had s*x with a minor-- she was 15 years old-- but then she changed her story, so the charges were dropped.</p>
<p>Want to bet he paid her off?</p>
<p>Talent and ambition ran in Layla Wells's family.</p>
<p>Her grandmother Jasmine was a Las Vegas showgirl who gave Layla her first figure-skating classes.</p>
<p>Sadly, Layla's grandmother didn't live to see her come so close to becoming America's next Overnight Sensation.</p>
<p>My mama didn't approve of show business.</p>
<p>We were always fighting about it, so I went to live with my grandma.</p>
<p>Trim the ice ballet, give me some more shots where she's crying.</p>
<p>We need to see some more emotion, man.</p>
<p>Mr. Rich.</p>
<p>Later.</p>
<p>Marvin.</p>
<p>I left rehearsal around 7:15.</p>
<p>I went back to my room alone.</p>
<p>I needed some time to think.</p>
<p>Is thinking what got Layla pregnant?</p>
<p>These kids might seem like innocents, but they're not.</p>
<p>They are first-class manipulators with the survival instincts of a coyote.</p>
<p>I told Layla I'd pay for an abortion, and shagreed, as long as she won the competition.</p>
<p>I don't like being blackmailed.</p>
<p>Sounds like motive.</p>
<p>Doesn't mean I killed her.</p>
<p>We know you left the Palermo around midnight.</p>
<p>About 20 minutes later, your credit card was used at the Blue Madonna Motel.</p>
<p>I wasn't with Layla.</p>
<p>Her body was found three blocks from there.</p>
<p>You beat rape charges once.</p>
<p>Maybe you thought you wouldn't be so lucky a second time.</p>
<p>This is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Look...</p>
<p>I was with a hooker.</p>
<p>All right?</p>
<p>Layla was pregnant with your child.</p>
<p>That's statutory rape.</p>
<p>Age of consent in Nevada is 16.</p>
<p>No, have your lawyer look at the statute again.</p>
<p>There's an exception when a person is in a position of authority with a teenager-- like &quot;executive producer.&quot;</p>
<p>Come on, let's go.</p>
<p>Spermaceti.</p>
<p>An oil found in the heads of sperm whales.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm, and when it cools, it becomes a wax.</p>
<p>The lipstick that the dead girl was wearing had a spermaceti wax base.</p>
<p>There's been a ban on sperm whaling for 20 years.</p>
<p>Yeah, which means that the lipstick is very old.</p>
<p>You know, spermaceti is not the weirdest thing found in lipstick.</p>
<p>The ancient Greeks made theirs out of saliva, sheep sweat, and crocodile excrement.</p>
<p>Did any of the makeup in her hotel room contain spermaceti?</p>
<p>No, but there were intriguingly analogous results from, believe it or not... the tablecloth Take a look.</p>
<p>Asbestos?</p>
<p>Specific type of asbestos called amocite.</p>
<p>Its particles are bound together by vermiculite and cellulose, a combination found in spray-on ceilings.</p>
<p>That type of ceiling material hasn't been used in 20 or 30 years.</p>
<p>You know, it's as if your victim found a hole in the time-space continuum and was murdered decades ago.</p>
<p>Brilliant theory, Dave.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>So this was the Strip 50 years ago.</p>
<p>The Vegas my dad came to.</p>
<p>Now, any one of the big hotels has more rooms than all these put together.</p>
<p>Nearly all the old casinos that Rancho Linen serviced have been torn down.</p>
<p>Except for this one, on the west side.</p>
<p>Where Layla's body was found.</p>
<p>Le Chateau Rouge.</p>
<p>Man, last time I was this deep in the hood, I was on a case with Warrick.</p>
<p>Got some track marks here.</p>
<p>11 inches apart.</p>
<p>Same as the other ones I found.</p>
<p>Layla was wearing a pink sweater when she left the Palermo.</p>
<p>We have a crime scene.</p>
<p>No warrant needed.</p>
<p>If Layla did get inside, somebody locked up after her.</p>
<p>It's like someone yelled &quot;fire&quot; 50 years ago, and nobody came back.</p>
<p>Yeah. You can still feel it in the air.</p>
<p>Legends walked here.</p>
<p>Louis Armstrong, Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole, Dinah Washington.</p>
<p>First integrated casino in town.</p>
<p>Place was smoking so hot every night, they added a 2:30 a.m. show.</p>
<p>Sinatra, the Rat Pack-- all the white headliners and tourists came down from the Strip.</p>
<p>Place was swinging till dawn.</p>
<p>Then, six months after it opened, the joint closed overnight.</p>
<p>How come?</p>
<p>Rumor has it the Kansas City Mob didn't like the East Coast boys poaching their pigeons.</p>
<p>Back then, there were only eight or nine casinos on the Strip.</p>
<p>700 or 800 people were here instead of there, well, do the math.</p>
<p>This cart can match the tracks I found.</p>
<p>Rancho Linen Service.</p>
<p>Hey give me some light over here, will you?</p>
<p>That's the only table without a tablecloth.</p>
<p>We've got blood.</p>
<p>Better call P.D., track down the owner of the building.</p>
<p>♪♪♪♪♪</p>
<p>Whose car is that, man?</p>
<p>Building owner.</p>
<p>Château Rouge, man.</p>
<p>My parents came here.</p>
<p>They still talk about it.</p>
<p>Good evening.</p>
<p>My name's Gil Grissom.</p>
<p>I'm with the Crime Lab.</p>
<p>Well, I hope your people are taking care with my property.</p>
<p>I understand it has quite a history.</p>
<p>You're too young to remember.</p>
<p>I've heard stories.</p>
<p>Wasn't there a night when Sammy Davis sang, and the only way they'd let him off the stage was if he took the whole crowd to breakfast?</p>
<p>More than once.</p>

<p>Well, then you can watch me drink.</p>
<p>In Rome, they illuminate the ruins every night.</p>
<p>The Italians see beauty in what... what used to be.</p>
<p>It's been 50 years since I've seen lights on the Rouge.</p>
<p>She walks in beauty, like the night.</p>

<p>Oh, he liked making money.</p>
<p>He gave it the best of everything.</p>
<p>The decor, the food, the music.</p>
<p>It was exciting.</p>
<p>Magical, really.</p>
<p>As long as it lasted.</p>
<p>But it died with him.</p>
<p>I haven't been inside since... since he was murdered there.</p>
<p>Why didn't you sell the property?</p>
<p>There's no such thing as sentiment in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>They would have torn it down, and I... I couldn't, I couldn't bear that.</p>
<p>Would you like to go in now?</p>
<p>Mm-mm.</p>
<p>You can only wake up once from a dream.</p>
<p>Wow, you know I have a glitter fetish, don't you?</p>
<p>Lots of recent activity over here.</p>
<p>&quot;Jasmine.&quot;</p>
<p>Wasn't Layla's grandmother's name Jasmine?</p>
<p>I think so, yeah.</p>
<p>I think that Layla was trying to connect with her roots.</p>
<p>I think I got a bullet in the floor.</p>
<p>Impact blew the dust back, so it must be recent.</p>
<p>Got something else that wasn't here 50 years ago.</p>
<p>Cell phone.</p>
<p>It's Layla's.</p>
<p>That explains why we didn't find one on her or in her room.</p>
<p>Last function was &quot;video camera.&quot;</p>
<p>Hey, Greg.</p>
<p>Check this out.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Layla Wells will now be singing for you.</p>
<p>♪ Here I go again ♪<br />
♪ I hear the trumpets blow again ♪</p>
<p>That costume's in the dressing room.</p>
<p>Looks like Kip's working the flashlight and the came.</p>
<p>♪ About the beats... ♪</p>
<p>Surprised by the sax man?</p>
<p>So he kills her, wraps her up, pulls her body out of here on a cart, comes back, puts the cart back.</p>
<p>Puts the costume back.</p>
<p>Put erything back the way it was 50 years ago.</p>
<p>Sir...</p>
<p>You're in custody at Desert Palm Hospital.</p>
<p>You're being treated for dehydration and malnutrition.</p>
<p>Could you tell us your name, please?</p>
<p>Don't matter.</p>
<p>How long have you lived at the Château Rouge?</p>
<p>Everybody wants a piece of you.</p>
<p>Drew and, and... managers and fans.</p>
<p>But...</p>
<p>But Layla and me, we just... we just gave to each other.</p>
<p>She, uh, I looked out for her.</p>
<p>I cared about her.</p>
<p>I, I tried to make her feel... safe.</p>
<p>Nobody else loved her.</p>
<p>Not like me.</p>
<p>Nobody.</p>
<p>I, uh...</p>
<p>I found out online about where her grandma danced.</p>
<p>I thought it'd be a cool surprise to take her.</p>
<p>Didn't you read that part where it says, &quot;Don't go in after dark&quot;?</p>
<p>I just wanted to get a picture of her in front of the place and get back in the cab, but she... she was, like, insane to get in there.</p>
<p>She pulled apart a fence.</p>
<p>She found some door that wasn't locked.</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, Miss Layla Wells will now sing for you.</p>
<p>She was so beautiful.</p>
<p>We were making sweet music.</p>
<p>Sweet music.</p>
<p>He was jealous.</p>
<p>Came at me.</p>
<p>Shoved her.</p>
<p>So you ran away not knowing if Layla was dead or alive?</p>
<p>I looked for her for hours.</p>
<p>All around that place, and up and down every street in that neighborhood for blocks, but... she wasn't anywhere.</p>
<p>Guess she was still inside.</p>
<p>With him.</p>
<p>A young girl is dead.</p>
<p>I did it.</p>
<p>You got me.</p>
<p>♪♪♪♪♪</p>
<p>Inspired by Harlem's famed Cotton Club, New York restaurateur Jules Rosenthal created Le Château Rouge.</p>
<p>The casino flourished until tragedy struck.</p>
<p>Former Sheriff Claude Montgomery recalls what happened.</p>
<p>Mrs. Rosenthal said she thought she heard a ruckus in the musicians' dressing room.</p>
<p>She went in there, found her husband, shot.</p>
<p>There were rumors it was a Mob hit.</p>
<p>That's a good story, but no.</p>
<p>He was killed by one of his employees.</p>
<p>A musician-- a guy named Melchior Wilson, a drug addict.</p>
<p>Took the money and ran.</p>
<p>Found his prints all over the wallet.</p>
<p>Confessed to the whole thing.</p>
<p>You actually found a file this old that rodents hadn't nested in, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The guy they arrested evidently died in prison.</p>
<p>♪♪♪♪♪</p>
<p>&quot;Melchior Wilson.&quot;</p>
<p>Tenor saxophone player.</p>
<p>Yeah, the old guy we caught had a .32 Long Colt.</p>
<p>Nick ran it through IBIS.</p>
<p>Matched it to the bullet from the Rosenthal homicide.</p>
<p>Maybe Melchior Wilson ditched the gun at the Rouge, and our squatter discovered it 50 years later.</p>
<p>You know what we need?</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>Exemplar wallets made from reptile skin.</p>
<p>Somewhere a swamp is in mourning.</p>
<p>Lizard, snake...</p>
<p>Alligator.</p>
<p>In the 1958 case, Sheriff Montgomery lifted a print from an alligator wallet.</p>
<p>He matched it to a print from a suspect named Melchior Wilson.</p>
<p>That's the lift card from his file.</p>
<p>That's a nice, clean print.</p>
<p>No serious flaws.</p>
<p>Compare it to this one.</p>
<p>Well, the one you just lifted has voids from the alligator skin.</p>
<p>The old one doesn't.</p>
<p>That print was never on that wallet.</p>
<p>Melchior Wilson was a musician Château Rouge.</p>
<p>His prints could have been lifted from anywhere in that room.</p>
<p>♪♪♪♪</p>
<p>Hey, Grissom.</p>
<p>Where on earth have you been, stranger?</p>
<p>Hey, Nicole.</p>
<p>Hey, look who's here.</p>
<p>Heo, fellas.</p>
<p>Well, I'll be damned.</p>
<p>You're two years late.</p>
<p>George, deal him in.</p>
<p>Feeling lucky?</p>
<p>No, I can't, Sheriff, I'm working.</p>
<p>What are you doing here?</p>
<p>I was hoping to talk to you actually.</p>
<p>About the Château Rouge.</p>
<p>One hand, you win, I'll talk.</p>
<p>$500 will buy you in.</p>
<p>Big blind's $20.</p>
<p>Chateau Rouge...</p>
<p>When I was playing the lounge at the Dunes, I used to make that my last stop on the way home.</p>
<p>Lived on the west side, then, huh?</p>
<p>Yeah, Sheriff, you know.</p>
<p>We had to.</p>
<p>Vegas was known as &quot;Mississippi of the West.&quot;</p>
<p>Pearl Bailey, Nat King Cole, Sammy Davis, Lena Horne, the Mills Brothers--</p>
<p>I booked them all into the big rooms on the Strip.</p>
<p>But they could not stay in the hotels.</p>
<p>They couldn't even gamble in the casinos.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, they came in and out through the kitchen.</p>
<p>You remember beautiful Dorothy Dandridge?</p>
<p>There was something about her going in for a swim at one of the hotels.</p>
<p>They drained the whole damn pool.</p>
<p>Sheriff, it's up to you.</p>
<p>Twenty.</p>
<p>I'm gone.</p>
<p>Grissom?</p>
<p>The women at the Château Rouge-- mm-mm-mm!</p>
<p>They had such tiny waists.</p>
<p>And cakes, too.</p>
<p>Ponytails was the big thing then.</p>
<p>They all had cute little ponytails.</p>
<p>Lord have mercy.</p>
<p>And the flop.</p>
<p>Check.</p>
<p>No $20?</p>
<p>Raise to $50.</p>
<p>Matter of fact, when they whacked Jules Rosenthal, they shuttered that place so fast, they paid the stagehands in sugar bags full of quarters and nickels, and they were gone.</p>
<p>Melchior Wilson's arrest must have set a speed record for closing a homicide, huh, Sheriff?</p>
<p>Those were the days.</p>
<p>Turns a five.</p>
<p>I fold.</p>
<p>Sheriff?</p>
<p>Twenty.</p>
<p>You in or out?</p>
<p>Check.</p>
<p>Twenty.</p>
<p>You haven't raised once.</p>
<p>Either the county's still not paying you enough, or you're bluffing.</p>
<p>All in.</p>
<p>Call.</p>
<p>Now is when you show your hand, Sheriff.</p>
<p>Dead man's hand-- aces and eights.</p>
<p>A straight.</p>
<p>Hell...</p>
<p>I used to be able to bluff better.</p>
<p>Wilson signed a confession.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>But they say some of you guys used to drive suspects out into the dessert, show them a hole in the ground, give them a choice to sign a confession or get in the hole.</p>
<p>We got a good, clean print.</p>
<p>The file says that you lifted the print from Rosenthal's alligator wallet.</p>
<p>Now I examined it.</p>
<p>Alligator skin would've left voids.</p>
<p>You know, in the old days, the criminals were afraid of us, now it's the other way around.</p>
<p>Does he look familiar to you?</p>
<p>He's been squatting at the Château Rouge.</p>
<p>Now, I ran his prints against the unidentifieds that you lifted from the scene in '58.</p>
<p>This man was all over the place.</p>
<p>With all the crime that's going on in Vegas these days, you got time to poke around in my old cases.</p>
<p>Good to see you, son.</p>
<p>Thanks for the drink.</p>
<p>And we know Drew Rich didn't do it... his alibi checks out.</p>
<p>Apparently, he's a big spender on the hookers.</p>
<p>So, how did Layla get punched in the gut?</p>
<p>She came out of the dressing room, sang for Kip on the stage.</p>
<p>Then the old man came out from somewhere behind you.</p>
<p>To the left.</p>
<p>Layla screamed and ran this direction.</p>
<p>Then Kip dropped the flashlight, so she probably uldn't see where she was going.</p>
<p>Matches her costume.</p>
<p>I think she ran into this.</p>
<p>It does match her bruises.</p>
<p>♪ About to beat the band... ♪</p>
<p>Her death was accident?</p>
<p>Why did the old man confess to it?</p>
<p>Why won't he tell us who he is?</p>
<p>What you doing?</p>
<p>These are from the souvenir program you collected.</p>
<p>We still don't have an I.D. on the suspect.</p>
<p>But I'm thinking, given his age, and the fact that he plays the sax-- maybe he worked there back in the day.</p>
<p>Melchior Wilson died in prison.</p>
<p>Which leaves these two--</p>
<p>Harry Bastille and Stanley Brown.</p>
<p>We don't have anything on either of these guys after '58.</p>
<p>No recordings, no credits, no death records.</p>
<p>♪♪♪♪<br />
♪♪♪♪♪♪♪♪</p>
<p>Well, hello, Harry.</p>
<p>Mr. Bastille, we know you didn't kill the girl.</p>
<p>But why did you move her body?</p>
<p>Why didn't you call for help?</p>
<p>Didn't want anybody coming in my space.</p>
<p>Wanted to spend my time in the last place I was ever happy.</p>
<p>We were all like a family back there.</p>
<p>A beautiful moment in time.</p>
<p>Right this way, please.</p>
<p>Thank you for coming, Mrs. Rosenthal.</p>
<p>Is the name Harry Bastille familiar to you?</p>
<p>Um...</p>
<p>There was a musician...</p>
<p>Would you take a look at the man in this room, and tell us if you think it could be Harry?</p>
<p>Well, that was a very long time ago.</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>That's not Harry.</p>
<p>I'm sorry I couldn't help you.</p>
<p>Mrs. Rosenthal, that is Harry Bastille.</p>
<p>Well, you knew.</p>
<p>Why did you ask me to go and look at him?</p>
<p>We think he may be the man that murdered your husband.</p>
<p>He didn't shoot Jules.</p>
<p>I know, because I was there.</p>
<p>Do you know Sheriff Montgomery?</p>
<p>Very well.</p>
<p>Well, I promise you there is no evidence incriminating Harry.</p>
<p>You seem to me to be a woman who doesn't change her tastes very often.</p>
<p>I noticed last night you had a fine bottle of pink champagne in your car.</p>
<p>It's the same rare champagne that was found in the room where your husband was murdered.</p>
<p>Now... champagne usually suggests a celebration.</p>
<p>Or, maybe, in this case... a romance.</p>
<p>We had nowhere to be together.</p>
<p>So we took a chance after the last show.</p>
<p>Baby, you sure we're safe?</p>
<p>Everybody's gone home.</p>
<p>We were making sweet music.</p>
<p>Sweet music.</p>
<p>He was jealous.</p>
<p>You son of a bitch!</p>
<p>Came at me...</p>
<p>This is how you repay me?!</p>
<p>No! No!</p>
<p>Shoved her.</p>
<p>Harry wanted to say that he did it.</p>
<p>And I... I couldn't let that happen.</p>
<p>I took the cash out of Jules' wallet and gave it to him and told him to run... and never come back.</p>
<p>And then you and Sheriff Montgomery framed Melchior Wilson.</p>
<p>No...</p>
<p>I confessed.</p>
<p>The town was very different then.</p>
<p>And the men who ran it forced the sheriff to arrest Melchior.</p>
<p>You see... a white woman could get away with murder... but she couldn't love a black man.</p>
<p>♪ They asked me ♪<br />
♪ How I knew ♪<br />
♪ My true love was true ♪<br />
♪ Oh, oh, oh! ♪<br />
♪ I, of course, replied... ♪</p>
<p>There's the people who come to Vegas wanting to become rich or famous, and then there's the people that are from here.</p>
<p>And we know that the odds are always in favor of the house.</p>
<p>It's what built this town.</p>
<p>You didn't come here to become famous, did you?</p>
<p>I came to play cards.</p>
<p>No, for real.</p>
<p>I did-- I came to play cards.</p>
<p>I needed the money.</p>
<p>I thought I was in love with this girl, in college, but I kept getting into debt buying cadavers and fetal pigs.</p>
<p>There was no money left for the girl.</p>
<p>Science took the pot.</p>
<p>Well, maybe it just wasn't the right girl.</p>
<p>Plus, poker allowed me to be a loner and still make money.</p>
<p>Oh. Right.</p>
<p>When was the last time you played?</p>
<p>I can't remember.</p>
<p>You know, to most people, risk is a bad thing, but in Vegas, it's a good thing.</p>
<p>See? You paid for your pigs, you got roots, friends, family...</p>
<p>Well, a work family anyway.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Maybe it's time to up the ante.</p>

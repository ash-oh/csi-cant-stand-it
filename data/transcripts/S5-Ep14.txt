<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Camera pulls back from the city.)</p>
<p>[EXT. BOULDER HIGHWAY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Parked along the stretch of empty road, officer car lights flash. Brass and Grissom walk toward the abandoned car where Sofia Curtis is examining the possible crime scene.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (to Grissom) Bolo out on the vehicle. Missing persons: Lori Kyman. Husband said she went out with some girlfriends earlier this evening, and never came home.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: F-O-S.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What's an F-O-S?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Friend of the sheriff. How else do you get listed as a missing person so quickly?</p>
<p>(Grissom tries the door handle.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Doors are locked. No key in the ignition. No sign of struggle or foul play.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Flat tire. Couple of smudges. Okay, pop it.</p>
<p>(Sofia steps aside. The tech steps forward and pops the trunk open. It's empty.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: So, she gets a flat. There's no gas station around. It's a Lexus, so there's no On-Star. She must have had some kind of emergency roadside service.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I ran her cell phone log. She made one call to her husband at 9:30. Said she was coming home at eleven; that's it.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Maybe some good samaritan offered her a lift.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, and evidently didn't take her where she wanted to go.</p>
<p>FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS COMMUNITY (STOCK) - DAY] </p>
<p>[INT. KYMAN RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Sara and Brass interview Mark Kyman. Lori Kyman's best friend, Amy Maynard, is there carrying the baby, Joey.)</p>
<p><strong>Mark Kyman</strong>: Lori hadn't gotten out much since Joey was born. She needed some time away from the baby, and from me.</p>
<p><strong>Amy Maynard</strong>: Girls' night out. We've been best friends since high school.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Where'd you go?</p>
<p><strong>Amy Maynard</strong>: The Top Floor. </p>
<p>(Brass and Sara turn to look at each other.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: That's right next to O'Shea's.</p>
<p>(He winks at her.) </p>
<p>(Sara gets it. She stands up.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Amy, why don't you and I go into the other room?</p>
<p><strong>Amy Maynard</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(They turn to leave. Mark looks at Amy.) </p>
<p><strong>Mark Kyman</strong>: (to Amy) He's going to need his bottle soon.</p>
<p><strong>Amy Maynard</strong>: I'll take care of it.</p>
<p>(Amy and Sara leave the room. Brass resumes the interview.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, Mark, you were home alone with the baby last night?</p>
<p><strong>Mark Kyman</strong>: No. Uh, I, uh, I manage the steakhouse at the Tangiers. I got home around nine. My mother-in-law was taking care of Joey.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Your mother-in-law. I'll need to speak with her.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Kyman</strong>: Yeah, she's on her way over.</p>
<p>MEANWHILE:</p>
<p>(Sara talks with Amy Maynard in the other room. Joey is playing with a teething toy and cooing.)</p>
<p><strong>Amy Maynard</strong>: She's in love with her baby. She wouldn't go anywhere without him.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What about Mark?</p>
<p><strong>Amy Maynard</strong>: Mark loves Lori. He would never hurt her.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: When a wife disappears, it's protocol to look at the husband.</p>
<p>(Amy sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Amy Maynard</strong>: I promised I would never say anything. Before the baby was born, she suspected he was cheating. (Sara nods.) But then Joey came, and last night at the club, Lori said things were great.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Did anything unusual happen last night?</p>
<p><strong>Amy Maynard</strong>: There was this one guy who kept moving in on Lori.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [THE TOP FLOOR - BAR - NIGHT] Amy and Lori are sitting at the bar nursing their drinks when Brad Himmel walks up to Lori and starts talking with her.) </p>
<p><strong>Brad Himmel</strong>: Hi. Could I ask you a question? It's critical.</p>
<p><strong>Lori Kyman</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Brad Himmel</strong>: Am I your type?</p>
<p><strong>Lori Kyman</strong>: I'm married.</p>
<p><strong>Brad Himmel</strong>: Oh, yeah? Nice try. (He points to her bare ring finger on her left hand.) Ring.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Amy Maynard</strong>: I think his name is Brad.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Does Lori always go out without a ring? </p>
<p><strong>Amy Maynard</strong>: She had lost some weight. It was being resized.</p>
<p>[INT. KYMAN RESIDENCE -- LIVING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, Lori calls you at 9:30 to check on the baby.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Kyman</strong>: Yeah. Said she missed him. Said she was going to be home at eleven. I, uh, passed out on the couch waiting for her.</p>
<p>[SARA AND AMY]</p>
<p><strong>Amy Maynard</strong>: We stopped drinking at ten. Left about an hour later.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What about the guy -- Brad?</p>
<p><strong>Amy Maynard</strong>: He didn't get the hint. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [EXT. TOP FLOOR - PARKING LOT - NIGHT] Lori closes her car door. Brad leans over the open window.) </p>
<p><strong>Brad Himmel</strong>: Last chance.</p>
<p>(He steps away; Amy rolls her eyes and leaves.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Amy Maynard</strong>: He seemed harmless. Horny ... but harmless.</p>
<p>[BRASS AND MARK KYMAN]</p>
<p><strong>Mark Kyman</strong>: I, uh, I woke up, must have been about 2:00. I called her on her cell. No answer. And then I called Amy. (He swallows.) And then I called you guys.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, you haven't left the house since you got home last night?</p>
<p><strong>Mark Kyman</strong>: We, uh, only have one car right now. My lease ran out.</p>
<p>(In the background, the front door opens and closes. Diane Hoyt, Lori Kyman's mother, rushes down the stairs.) </p>
<p><strong>Diane Hoyt</strong>: Any news?</p>
<p>(Mark stands up and hugs Diane. Brass clears his throat. They pull apart and Mark explains.) </p>
<p><strong>Mark Kyman</strong>: They found her car off Boulder Highway.</p>
<p><strong>Diane Hoyt</strong>: Oh, my God.</p>
<p>(Mark makes the introduction.) </p>
<p><strong>Mark Kyman</strong>: This is Diane, Lori's mom.</p>
<p><strong>Diane Hoyt</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Diane, I want you to know we have every available officer out looking for your daughter.</p>
<p><strong>Diane Hoyt</strong>: Thank you. (to Mark) Where's Joey?</p>
<p><strong>Mark Kyman</strong>: He's with Amy.</p>
<p>(Diane puts her handbag down on the dining room seat intending to go check on the baby. Brass stops her for a moment.) </p>
<p><strong>Diane Hoyt</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know, I just got a quick couple of questions. Can you confirm you were here last night when Mark came home from work?</p>
<p><strong>Diane Hoyt</strong>: Yes. I was baby-sitting.</p>
<p>(Diane removes her coat.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What time was that?</p>
<p><strong>Diane Hoyt</strong>: Uh ... I'd just put Joey down. A little after 9:00.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: And when did your daughter call?</p>
<p><strong>Diane Hoyt</strong>: About half an hour later. We both talked to her.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So 9:30. Thanks. That's all for now, thank you.</p>
<p>(Mark nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Diane Hoyt</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p>(Diane leaves the room.) </p>
<p><strong>Mark Kyman</strong>: What do I do?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'd take care of your family, Mark. And if Ms. Sidle asks, volunteer your fingerprints and DNA.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAKE (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[EXT. WOODS -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(The Ranger shows Nick and Warrick to the body where David Phillips is already there gathering his data.) </p>
<p><strong>Ranger</strong>: I was making my 16:45 scan when I saw the body. I confirmed he was deceased. Then I called you guys.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Hey. There's no I.D. on the vic. Lividity is set. Rigidity is still present. Dead no more than twenty-four hours.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Look at those claw marks.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: His carotid artery is ripped to shreds.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: He's got a high-powered rifle. He's obviously a hunter, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Safe to say he was mauled by a wild animal?</p>
<p><strong>Ranger</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Your call came in as &quot;suspicious circs.&quot; Is there something else we should know about?</p>
<p>(She points off to the side.) </p>
<p><strong>Ranger</strong>: Yeah, that would be the other body. Um -- Follow me.</p>
<p>(The Ranger leads Warrick, Nick and David Phillips to the second body: A large Kodiak bear.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p><strong>Ranger</strong>: It's a Kodiak. It's nonnative to the continental US. Shot twice in the head. The stomach's been cut open.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: That's a pretty deep cut. You think the hunter was just trying to defend himself?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Well, I didn't find a blade on the decedent.</p>
<p><strong>Ranger</strong>: And there's no way a person can come this close to a live bear.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Got some broken branches over here. </p>
<p>(Nick is checking out the bushes nearby.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Directionality faces away from the victim and the animal. </p>
<p>(He finds and picks a piece of torn material stuck on the branches.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Looks like someone even tore their pants. Khakis. Vic's wearing jeans and a nylon vest. I bet somebody else was out here, and they were running for their life.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Catherine walks in and grabs her lab coat. She walks over to Dr. Robbins' examining table where the large Kodiak bear is.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I had to see with my own eyes. You're actually autopsying a bear.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: It's called a necropsy. And as the head M.E., it falls under my purview. I'm going to write an article for the journal. They love this sort of stuff.</p>
<p>(Catherine looks over at the other table with the dead hunter on it.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah. You have a cause of death on him?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: I can confirm he was killed by an angry bear. As for the bear -- two bullets to the head. The first, nonfatal, was a straight-on shot. Bears' foreheads are sloped, so the bullet ricocheted off the skull, leaving a copper jacket, which peeled away and embedded in the hide.</p>
<p>(He removes the bullet and puts it in the pan.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: The, uh, fatal bullet entered through the ear, lodged in the brain. I removed it already.</p>
<p>(She picks up the bullet from the tray and looks at it.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It's lead. No copper jacket. So, the copper jacket had to have come from his rifle. But this is from a handgun.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: So, he shot one bullet with his rifle and another with his pistol.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Except he didn't have a pistol. Or a knife, for that matter. And his stomach has been slashed open.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Yeah, and the gallbladder removed.</p>
<p>(Robbins points to the cut.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Postmortem. I can't tell you why.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - LAB - NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Warrick snaps photos of the victim's clothes.) </p>
<p>(He documents in the file whatever he finds on the clothes. He cuts a piece of something off the clothes and looks at it.) </p>
<p>(Nick walks into the lab.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, man. I ran the vic's prints. Didn't get a hit.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We found this guy twenty-five miles from civilization. Where'd he come from?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: We know someone else was out there. Maybe he drove.</p>
<p>(Warrick picks up the watch and hands it to Nick.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Check out this guy's watch. It's pretty high-end.</p>
<p>(Nick puts it against his wrist to look at the watch face.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah. Hunting's not exactly a poor man's sport. U.S. presidents still hold up dead ducks for photo ops.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: But it just doesn't match with the guy's clothes. They're kind of raggedy. He's got dirt stains. I could smell the B.O. from the guy's shirt from here.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Some hunters think soap and deodorant tip off their prey. Truth is, body odor's much more pungent.</p>
<p>(Catherine joins them.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, Robbins confirmed that our vic was killed by the bear.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay. Case closed.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Uh, not quite. I spoke with the Ranger. There's no way that a Kodiak bear just wanders into Nevada, so whoever smuggled him in could be charged with homicide.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: How's that?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The bear could be considered a lethal weapon.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - GARAGE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Greg is checking out the screw on the car's tire. Sofia walks into the garage.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Screw.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Tire's valve stem was unscrewed. Two full turns.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: A slow leaker. Print around the fender.</p>
<p>(Greg prints around the fender and finds a print.)</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: The person braces himself against the fender as they unscrew the tire. End of flash. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(Sofia smiles.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI -- PRINT LAB - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Greg runs the print through the database. He finds a match to BRAD HIMMEL, previously arrested for a 462.2 &quot;Drunk and Disorderly&quot;.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM]</p>
<p>(Brass and Greg interview Brad Himmel.) </p>
<p><strong>Brad Himmel</strong>: Yeah, I was at The Top Floor. I hit on a lot of girls. You can't arrest me for that, right?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Tell us about Lori Kyman.</p>
<p><strong>Brad Himmel</strong>: Yeah, I remember a Lori. Said she was married. Yeah, right. You dress up like that and go to a club ... you're looking to get some.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I found your fingerprints on her car's fender.</p>
<p><strong>Brad Himmel</strong>: So? I walked her back to her car. I am a gentleman.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Is that when you messed with her tire? </p>
<p><strong>Brad Himmel</strong>: Is that what this is about?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I don't get out much. Why would you do that?</p>
<p><strong>Brad Himmel</strong>: I was hoping it would go flat on her way back home, and I'd come along and fix it for her.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: And then she'd be appropriately grateful, and what, sleep with you?</p>
<p><strong>Brad Himmel</strong>: Seemed like a good idea at the time, yeah. 'Course I was tanked.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Okay, so Lori's tire went flat.</p>
<p><strong>Brad Himmel</strong>: Well, that's the thing: It didn't. I mean, I followed her for like twenty minutes. Way off strip. And, come on, how long can you follow someone for, right?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: She never made it home.</p>
<p><strong>Brad Himmel</strong>: I don't know anything about that.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: We're going to need a sample of your DNA. Any objections?</p>
<p>(Brad Himmel shakes his head, no.) </p>
<p>(An officer enters the room.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Excuse me. Excuse me, Captain.</p>
<p>(Brass walks over to the officer.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: (loud whisper) Found a dead female in Sutor. Description matches Lori Kyman.</p>
<p>(Brass looks at Brad.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Make yourself comfortable.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. HIGHWAY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[EXT. (SUTOR) HIGHWAY - DAY]</p>
<p>(Brass and Sofia walk over to David Phillips, who is taking down the body stats.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Guy walking his dog found her.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Liver temp's 71 degrees. Given the ambient temperature, her T.O.D's roughly thirty-six to forty hours ago.</p>
<p>(Sofia looks up at the white birch trees near the body.) </p>
<p>(She kneels down next to the body and brushes the hair away from the victim's neck.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Bruises on the neck suggest strangulation.</p>
<p>(She snaps a couple of photos.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: No attempt to hide the body.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Maybe the suspect was in a hurry. Or he just didn't give a damn.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Are you gonna tell the family?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, how do you tell a little boy he'll never know his mother?</p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Grissom and Sofia are collecting evidence off of the body. Sofia combs out the debris from the victim's hair.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: She was dumped under a white birch. Her hair was full of pollen and tree vegetation.</p>
<p>(Grissom tape lifts fibers off the clothes. Sofia picks up a tree pollen and looks at it.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Red fibers and blue fibers on her dress.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: White powder on both palms.</p>
<p>(Grissom finds a strand of hair with a tag on it. He looks at it under the magnifying glass.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: A brown hair with a follicular tag. A person's entire identity balled up in a few nanograms of matter.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Assuming one's identity can be wholly quantified by our DNA.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, genetically, it can. We're completely programmed as soon as the sperm hits the egg.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: So we're defined at a cellular level?</p>

<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Excuse me?</p>

<p><strong>Carol Allred (lawyer)</strong>: Okay, I'm sorry. You don't have a DNA sample of my client's for comparison purposes.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: No, but we have her daughter's. You're not Lori's biological mother, are you?</p>
<p><strong>Diane Hoyt</strong>: I'm her stepmom. That's not a secret. (chokes) I couldn't have children of my own. Ever since Lori's father died a few months ago, she's all I had. </p>
<p>(Sofia stands up.) </p>
<p><strong>Diane Hoyt</strong>: Look, Mark is devastated. I really should get back to my grandson.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Before you go, could we take a DNA sample?</p>
<p><strong>Carol Allred (lawyer)</strong>: You do not have to do that.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, but if she has nothing to hide, it's no big deal.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Could you open your mouth?</p>
<p>(Sofia takes a swab.) </p>
<p><strong>Carol Allred (lawyer)</strong>: All right. That's it. We're finished here. Let's go.</p>
<p>(Carol stands up and leads Diane Hoyt out of the interview room.) </p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT -- HALLWAY -CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(The interview room door opens. Carol Allred and Diane Hoyt leave the room.)</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(Brass remains sitting in the chair.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: What are you thinking?</p>
<p>(Brass sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We have nothing to arrest her on.</p>
<p>(He gets up and leaves the room.) </p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT -- HALLWAY -CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(Brass steps out into the hallway and stands in the doorway. Sofia steps out of the room.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: And we have unexplained evidence placing Lori back at the house after her night out.</p>
<p>(They start walking down the hallway.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: That's why I like the husband. Maybe they're in it together.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Well, when two people of the opposite s*x conspire to kill one of their partners, s*x or money is almost always involved. Now, Lori's friend, Amy, did say Mark was a player.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hello, Mrs. Robinson.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: I had this boyfriend back in college, and when he got his first Harley, well, let's just say we sat face-to-face and went for a ride.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: A Bentley is a lot more comfortable than a bike.</p>
<p>(She chuckles. They continue down the hallway.)</p>

[INT. CSI - GARAGE]</p>
<p>(Sofia is using the ALS on the Bentley's upholstery. She finds something. She takes a swab of it.) </p>

[INT. CSI - QUESTIONED DOCUMENTS LAB]</p>
<p>(Ronnie Litre goes over his findings with Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Ronnie Litre</strong>: Document was forged by taking an official license issued by the Department of Agriculture and scraping away the top layer of information. Document was then photocopied, and the bogus info was typed in. Take a look.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mm-hmm. A simple forgery, but it doesn't get us any closer to our suspect.</p>
<p><strong>Ronnie Litre</strong>: Actually, it does. See, a couple years back, some photocopier companies started imbedding their machines with serial numbers less than a millimeter in size and visible only under a blue L-E-D light.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p>(Ronnie shines the light and exposes the number: 2407270313.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (smiles) I see it.</p>
<p><strong>Ronnie Litre</strong>: It's as good as fingerprint.</p>

[EXT. CLARK COUNTY ZOO -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Warrick and Catherine re-question Sam Tracy.) </p>
<p><strong>Sam Tracy</strong>: And you think the broker's documentation was forged here on my copier?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We know it was.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Mr. Tracy, tell us about canned hunts.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Tracy</strong>: Uh, a wild animal is released into a controlled area where a hunter pays a fee to kill it. The promoters guarantee a trophy, so no kill, no pay. They're illegal in Nevada. Is that what happened to my bear?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Aaron Colite worked here, right?</p>
<p><strong>Sam Tracy</strong>: Yeah. Maintenance.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You fired him?</p>
<p><strong>Sam Tracy</strong>: About six months ago. We let a lot people go. Cutbacks.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, the evidence places Aaron at the crime scene.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Tracy</strong>: Wait, so you're thinking he forged the broker's document and took Tippy under false pretenses?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No. We spoke to your distributor. Your copy machine was only installed two months ago. We think you created the false document.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We suspect that Aaron figured out a way to make a buck, and he asked for your help.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So Aaron organizes this canned hunt. A few days ago, you guys meet up with Rod Hollis up at Lake Mead .</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: [WOODS - NIGHT] Rod Hollis, Aaron Colite and Sam Tracy walk through the woods. Aaron Colite points out the bear to Rod Hollis.) </p>
<p><strong>Aaron Colite</strong>: Rod, Rod, Rod, Rod!</p>
<p><strong>Aaron Colite</strong>: Right there. You see him?</p>
<p>(Rod sees the bear.) </p>
<p><strong>Rod Hollis</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p>(He shoots and hits the bear in the head. The bear goes down.) </p>
<p><strong>Rod Hollis</strong>: Yes! I got him!</p>
<p><strong>Aaron Colite</strong>: Yep, you got him.</p>
<p>(End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mr. Hollis probably thought that he had killed the bear, and he raced over to claim his trophy.</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: [WOODS - NIGHT] Rod Hollis walks over to the bear. The bear gets up and whacks Rod on the side of his head. Sam Tracy stares in shock. He turns and runs. The bear attacks Rod.)</p>
<p>(Aaron takes out his gun.) </p>
<p><strong>Rod Hollis</strong>: Help! Help! Help me! Help!</p>
<p>(Aaron fires.)</p>
<p>(End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: His shot only stunned the bear. It was Aaron's shot that killed it.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Tracy</strong>: You can't prove I was there.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Would you lift up your pants legs, please, sir?</p>
<p><strong>Sam Tracy</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I have the judge on speed dial. You want to save me some time here?</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: [WOODS - NIGHT] Sam Tracy turns and runs. In his panic, he bumps into the bushes and scrapes his leg on the branches.)</p>
<p><strong>Rod Hollis</strong>: Help! Help! Help me!</p>
<p>(Aaron fires.) </p>
<p>(End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Sam Tracy</strong>: I got this gardening.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We subpoenaed Aaron's bank records. Rod Hollis sent Aaron a check for<br />
$16,000. Aaron sent you a check for $8,000. That's a 50-50 split.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You're looking at grand larceny and obtaining property under false pretenses.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: That's about twenty years right there.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm recommending to the DA that he add another charge: Second degree murder ... </p>
<p>(In the background, we hear the sounds of a vehicle and of dispatch over a police band radio. Sam Tracy turns around and sees the officer get out of the car. He closes the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: ... for the death of the hunter.</p>
<p>(Sam Tracy closes his eyes and shakes his head.)</p>

[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM 1 - DAY]</p>
<p>(Sara interviews Brad Himmel with his attorney, Margaret Finn.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We found your client's semen mixed with a vaginal contribution from Diane Hoyt in the back of her rental car. You said you had nothing to do with Lori's murder. Would you like to revise that statement?</p>
<p><strong>Brad Himmel</strong>: No. I met Diane, uh, two weeks ago at Rain. Banged the cougar that night, but I had no idea she was anybody's mother.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So you haven't spoken to her since?</p>
<p><strong>Brad Himmel</strong>: Well, that's the whole point of banging a cougar -- you never got to see 'em again.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: One lie after another.</p>
<p><strong>Margaret Finn (lawyer)</strong>: Are you questioning my client's veracity?</p>
<p>(Sara puts the phone record on the table.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: These are your client's cell phone records. Semen in the car was enough to get a warrant. On the night that Lori was murdered, he called Ms. Hoyt on her cell phone at 11:23 P.M.</p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM 2 - DAY]</p>
<p>(Sofia interviews Diane Hoyt with her attorney, Carol Allred.) </p>
<p><strong>Diane Hoyt</strong>: No, I don't know him.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: You've never seen or spoken to this man?</p>
<p><strong>Diane Hoyt</strong>: No, not that I remember.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Hmm. Do you remember the men you have s*x with?</p>
<p><strong>Carol Allred (lawyer)</strong>: Ms. Curtis, that is uncalled for.</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM 1 - DAY]</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Here's the deal. Lori left the club around eleven. By your client's own admission, he followed her for about twenty minutes, waiting for the tire to go flat. When it didn't, you called her mother.</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM 2 - DAY]</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: It was all a setup. Brad was going to strike up a conversation with Lori at the club, and on her way home, abduct her. And then, one or both of you were going to kill her.</p>
<p>(Diane bursts out laughing. Her lawyer chuckles along.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: But when you got his call ... You went to plan B.</p>
<p><strong>Diane Hoyt</strong>: I left Lori's house, drove home and went to bed.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: You never left. Mark fell asleep in the living room, and you waited for Lori to come home.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [NURSERY - NIGHT] Lori is changing Joey's diaper when Diane walks into the room. She grabs Lori from behind and starts choking her. End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Lori's body was too heavy for you to carry, so you called for help ... on Mark and Lori's phone.</p>
<p>(Sofia shows the phone log to the lawyer.) </p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM 1 - DAY]</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You got her call at 1:17 A.M. Coroner puts Lori's death at some time between 12:00 and 1:00 A.M.</p>
<p><strong>Brad Himmel</strong>: Well, which means I didn't kill her, like I told you.</p>
<p><strong>Margaret Finn (lawyer)</strong>: Brad, be quiet.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Oh, I never thought you did kill her, but you did help get rid of the body, and that is conspiracy after the fact.</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM 2 - DAY]</p>
<p><strong>Carol Allred (lawyer)</strong>: Now, Mark would've heard something, and if he's claiming he didn't, I'd be looking at him.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: The living room's at the other end of the house. He was asleep.</p>
<p><strong>Carol Allred (lawyer)</strong>: Prove it.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: I don't need to. We found something of Lori's on the rental exhaust pipe: Her skin.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: [SUTOR - NIGHT] Diane backs up the car. Brad is in the passenger seat. She backs up too much and bumps into Lori's dead body, skinning her leg with the exhaust pipe and searing the flesh at the same time. End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Your client's on record. The vehicle was never out of her possession.</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM 1 - DAY]</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You drove back to the house, picked up Lori's Lexus, drove back into town. Tire went flat off Boulder Highway.</p>
<p><strong>Margaret Finn (lawyer)</strong>: You can't prove that.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: When we suspected Brad's involvement, we printed the interior of the Lexus. Your prints are on the steering wheel.</p>
<p>(Margaret Finn whispers to Brad Himmel.) </p>
<p><strong>Margaret Finn (lawyer)</strong>: Is there a deal to be made?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Why did Diane Hoyt want Lori dead?</p>
<p><strong>Brad Himmel</strong>: I don't know. The lady paid me 2,000 bucks. Um ... said she was having a fight with her daughter and wanted to make good ... um, only Lori wouldn't return her calls, so it was my job to get 'em together. When she called me and asked me for my help later that night, she said she'd pay me<br />
$2,000 more.</p>

[INT. CSI - HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Sofia and Sara are walking down the hallway when Greg walks up to them from behind.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I know why she did it. While you two were at P.D., I called the family lawyer. He faxed over a copy of Lori's father's trust. Estate's worth $50 million.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: He left it all to Lori?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: No, to her son. Lori was the trustee with a stipend of $2.5 mil a year. If anything were to happen to Lori, guess who takes her place?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Her stepmom.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yup.</p>
<p>(Sofia chuckles.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Listen, you guys, I'll catch up later.</p>

<p>(Grissom turns around and looks at Sofia.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, I've enjoyed working with you as well.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: No, it's time I made a change. I don't like the direction the lab's headed.</p>
<p>(Grissom takes off his glasses.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You mean Ecklie? You can't pay any attention to him.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: No, you got a good team, but I was a supervisor. My demotion was undeserved, and every day I'm here, I'm reminded of that.</p>
<p>(Grissom thinks about it. He looks at Sofia.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, someone once said, &quot;What we are never changes, but who we are ... never stops changing.&quot; </p>

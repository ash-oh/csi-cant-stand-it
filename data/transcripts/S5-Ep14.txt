Sofia Curtis: F-O-S.
Grissom: What's an F-O-S?
Sofia Curtis: Friend of the sheriff. How else do you get listed as a missing person so quickly?
 
Grissom: Doors are locked. No key in the ignition. No sign of struggle or foul play.
Sofia Curtis: Flat tire. Couple of smudges. Okay, pop it.
 
Sofia Curtis: So, she gets a flat. There's no gas station around. It's a Lexus, so there's no On-Star. She must have had some kind of emergency roadside service.
Brass: I ran her cell phone log. She made one call to her husband at 9:30. Said she was coming home at eleven; that's it.
Sofia Curtis: Maybe some good samaritan offered her a lift.
Grissom: Yeah, and evidently didn't take her where she wanted to go.
FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS



 
 

Mark Kyman: Lori hadn't gotten out much since Joey was born. She needed some time away from the baby, and from me.
Amy Maynard: Girls' night out. We've been best friends since high school.
Brass: Where'd you go?
Amy Maynard: The Top Floor. 
 
Brass: That's right next to O'Shea's.
 
 
Sara: Amy, why don't you and I go into the other room?
Amy Maynard: Okay.
 
Mark Kyman:  He's going to need his bottle soon.
Amy Maynard: I'll take care of it.
 
Brass: So, Mark, you were home alone with the baby last night?
Mark Kyman: No. Uh, I, uh, I manage the steakhouse at the Tangiers. I got home around nine. My mother-in-law was taking care of Joey.
Brass: Your mother-in-law. I'll need to speak with her.
Mark Kyman: Yeah, she's on her way over.
MEANWHILE:

Amy Maynard: She's in love with her baby. She wouldn't go anywhere without him.
Sara: What about Mark?
Amy Maynard: Mark loves Lori. He would never hurt her.
Sara: When a wife disappears, it's protocol to look at the husband.

Amy Maynard: I promised I would never say anything. Before the baby was born, she suspected he was cheating.  But then Joey came, and last night at the club, Lori said things were great.
Sara: Did anything unusual happen last night?
Amy Maynard: There was this one guy who kept moving in on Lori.
 
Brad Himmel: Hi. Could I ask you a question? It's critical.
Lori Kyman: Okay.
Brad Himmel: Am I your type?
Lori Kyman: I'm married.
Brad Himmel: Oh, yeah? Nice try.  Ring.
 
Amy Maynard: I think his name is Brad.
Sara: Does Lori always go out without a ring? 
Amy Maynard: She had lost some weight. It was being resized.

Brass: So, Lori calls you at 9:30 to check on the baby.
Mark Kyman: Yeah. Said she missed him. Said she was going to be home at eleven. I, uh, passed out on the couch waiting for her.

Amy Maynard: We stopped drinking at ten. Left about an hour later.
Sara: What about the guy -- Brad?
Amy Maynard: He didn't get the hint. 
 
Brad Himmel: Last chance.
 
 
Amy Maynard: He seemed harmless. Horny ... but harmless.

Mark Kyman: I, uh, I woke up, must have been about 2:00. I called her on her cell. No answer. And then I called Amy.  And then I called you guys.
Brass: So, you haven't left the house since you got home last night?
Mark Kyman: We, uh, only have one car right now. My lease ran out.
 
Diane Hoyt: Any news?
 
Mark Kyman: They found her car off Boulder Highway.
Diane Hoyt: Oh, my God.
 
Mark Kyman: This is Diane, Lori's mom.
Diane Hoyt: Hi.
Brass: Diane, I want you to know we have every available officer out looking for your daughter.
Diane Hoyt: Thank you.  Where's Joey?
Mark Kyman: He's with Amy.
 
Diane Hoyt: Okay.
Brass: You know, I just got a quick couple of questions. Can you confirm you were here last night when Mark came home from work?
Diane Hoyt: Yes. I was baby-sitting.
 
Brass: What time was that?
Diane Hoyt: Uh ... I'd just put Joey down. A little after 9:00.
Brass: And when did your daughter call?
Diane Hoyt: About half an hour later. We both talked to her.
Brass: So 9:30. Thanks. That's all for now, thank you.
 
Diane Hoyt: Excuse me.
 
Mark Kyman: What do I do?
Brass: I'd take care of your family, Mark. And if Ms. Sidle asks, volunteer your fingerprints and DNA.


 
 
Ranger: I was making my 16:45 scan when I saw the body. I confirmed he was deceased. Then I called you guys.
David Phillips: Hey. There's no I.D. on the vic. Lividity is set. Rigidity is still present. Dead no more than twenty-four hours.
Warrick: Look at those claw marks.
David Phillips: His carotid artery is ripped to shreds.
Warrick: He's got a high-powered rifle. He's obviously a hunter, huh?
Nick: Safe to say he was mauled by a wild animal?
Ranger: Yeah.
Nick: Your call came in as &quot;suspicious circs.&quot; Is there something else we should know about?
 
Ranger: Yeah, that would be the other body. Um -- Follow me.
 
Warrick: Damn.
Ranger: It's a Kodiak. It's nonnative to the continental US. Shot twice in the head. The stomach's been cut open.
Warrick: That's a pretty deep cut. You think the hunter was just trying to defend himself?
David Phillips: Well, I didn't find a blade on the decedent.
Ranger: And there's no way a person can come this close to a live bear.
Nick: Got some broken branches over here. 
 
Nick: Directionality faces away from the victim and the animal. 
 
Nick: Looks like someone even tore their pants. Khakis. Vic's wearing jeans and a nylon vest. I bet somebody else was out here, and they were running for their life.

 
 
Catherine: I had to see with my own eyes. You're actually autopsying a bear.
Robbins: It's called a necropsy. And as the head M.E., it falls under my purview. I'm going to write an article for the journal. They love this sort of stuff.
 
Catherine: Yeah. You have a cause of death on him?
Robbins: I can confirm he was killed by an angry bear. As for the bear -- two bullets to the head. The first, nonfatal, was a straight-on shot. Bears' foreheads are sloped, so the bullet ricocheted off the skull, leaving a copper jacket, which peeled away and embedded in the hide.
 
Robbins: The, uh, fatal bullet entered through the ear, lodged in the brain. I removed it already.
 
Catherine: It's lead. No copper jacket. So, the copper jacket had to have come from his rifle. But this is from a handgun.
Robbins: So, he shot one bullet with his rifle and another with his pistol.
Catherine: Except he didn't have a pistol. Or a knife, for that matter. And his stomach has been slashed open.
Robbins: Yeah, and the gallbladder removed.
 
Catherine: Really?
Robbins: Postmortem. I can't tell you why.

 
 
 
 
Nick: Hey, man. I ran the vic's prints. Didn't get a hit.
Warrick: We found this guy twenty-five miles from civilization. Where'd he come from?
Nick: We know someone else was out there. Maybe he drove.
 
Warrick: Check out this guy's watch. It's pretty high-end.
 
Nick: Yeah. Hunting's not exactly a poor man's sport. U.S. presidents still hold up dead ducks for photo ops.
Warrick: But it just doesn't match with the guy's clothes. They're kind of raggedy. He's got dirt stains. I could smell the B.O. from the guy's shirt from here.
Nick: Some hunters think soap and deodorant tip off their prey. Truth is, body odor's much more pungent.
 
Catherine: So, Robbins confirmed that our vic was killed by the bear.
Nick: Okay. Case closed.
Catherine: Uh, not quite. I spoke with the Ranger. There's no way that a Kodiak bear just wanders into Nevada, so whoever smuggled him in could be charged with homicide.
Warrick: How's that?
Catherine: The bear could be considered a lethal weapon.

 
 
Greg: Screw.
Sofia Curtis: Excuse me?
Greg: Tire's valve stem was unscrewed. Two full turns.
Sofia Curtis: A slow leaker. Print around the fender.





 


 
Brad Himmel: Yeah, I was at The Top Floor. I hit on a lot of girls. You can't arrest me for that, right?
Brass: Tell us about Lori Kyman.
Brad Himmel: Yeah, I remember a Lori. Said she was married. Yeah, right. You dress up like that and go to a club ... you're looking to get some.
Greg: I found your fingerprints on her car's fender.
Brad Himmel: So? I walked her back to her car. I am a gentleman.
Greg: Is that when you messed with her tire? 
Brad Himmel: Is that what this is about?
Brass: I don't get out much. Why would you do that?
Brad Himmel: I was hoping it would go flat on her way back home, and I'd come along and fix it for her.
Brass: And then she'd be appropriately grateful, and what, sleep with you?
Brad Himmel: Seemed like a good idea at the time, yeah. 'Course I was tanked.
Greg: Okay, so Lori's tire went flat.
Brad Himmel: Well, that's the thing: It didn't. I mean, I followed her for like twenty minutes. Way off strip. And, come on, how long can you follow someone for, right?
Brass: She never made it home.
Brad Himmel: I don't know anything about that.
Greg: We're going to need a sample of your DNA. Any objections?
 
 
Officer: Excuse me. Excuse me, Captain.
 
Officer:  Found a dead female in Sutor. Description matches Lori Kyman.
 
Brass: Make yourself comfortable.



 
Brass: Guy walking his dog found her.
David Phillips: Liver temp's 71 degrees. Given the ambient temperature, her T.O.D's roughly thirty-six to forty hours ago.
 
 
Sofia Curtis: Bruises on the neck suggest strangulation.
 
Sofia Curtis: No attempt to hide the body.
Brass: Maybe the suspect was in a hurry. Or he just didn't give a damn.
Sofia Curtis: Are you gonna tell the family?
Brass: Yeah, how do you tell a little boy he'll never know his mother?




 
 
Sofia Curtis: She was dumped under a white birch. Her hair was full of pollen and tree vegetation.
 
Grissom: Red fibers and blue fibers on her dress.
Sofia Curtis: White powder on both palms.
 
Grissom: A brown hair with a follicular tag. A person's entire identity balled up in a few nanograms of matter.
Sofia Curtis: Assuming one's identity can be wholly quantified by our DNA.
Grissom: Well, genetically, it can. We're completely programmed as soon as the sperm hits the egg.
Sofia Curtis: So we're defined at a cellular level?
Grissom: More or less.
Sofia Curtis: No. Identity is the totality of our life experiences and our brain neurons process our relationship to the world and each other.
Grissom: I stand corrected. DNA is what we are, not who we are.
Sofia Curtis: What we are never changes. Who we are never stops changing.
Grissom: Yeah. Whether we like it or not.

 
 
Catherine: What's up?
Robbins: Well, when I fluoroscoped the bear, looking for other bullets, I noticed a microchip between his shoulder blades.
 
Catherine: I see.
Robbins: I removed it, called animal control to borrow a magnetic reader. Check it out.

Robbins: I tracked it down: Clark County Zoo.

 
 
Sam Tracy: Are you sure the bear came from our zoo?
Catherine: Well, the microchip was registered to you. Take a look.
 
Sam Tracy: Oh, God. It's Tippy. What happened?
Warrick: You mean you didn't know he was missing?
Sam Tracy: We sold him to a broker a few weeks ago. He said he found him a home at the Columbus Zoo.
Catherine: A broker?
Sam Tracy: Animal broker. Visitors want to see babies. The brokers find other zoos to purchase our surplus adult animals. You know, Tippy was so gentle, he'd eat grapes right out of my hand.
Catherine: Well, we're going to need to see some paperwork.
Sam Tracy: Yeah, I'll pull the file, but ... I remember the broker's name. It's Ken Bovitz. Out of Chicago. He mailed me his broker's license and documentation. The board approved the sale last fall.  They'll want to know what went wrong.
Catherine: Yeah, so do we.

 
 
Greg: You giving the car a workout?
Sara: Well, you know how you said that the suspect admitted to following Lori, but when the tire didn't go flat, he gave up? Grissom wants me to disprove his account.
Greg: How long has the wheel been going round and round?
Sara: Three hours and nine minutes.
Greg: She left the club around eleven. Time of death was between midnight and
1:00 A.M.
Sara: Lori died before the tire went flat.


 
Warrick: I think I know why someone snagged that bear's gallbladder. Apparently, in the southeast Asian community, some men believe it enhances their virility. It contains some chemical called ursodeoxycholic acid. These gallbladders are going for $500 a pop.
Catherine: I, uh, talked to the zoo in Columbus. They never heard of Tippy.
Warrick: Hmm. Any luck with the broker?
Catherine: The Department of Agriculture never issued a license for a Ken Bovitz. Documents are fake. I sent them to Q.D. for analysis.
 
Nick: We may have an ID on our hunter. Uniforms found an abandoned Mercedes. Plates came back to a Mr. Rod Hollis, who had hunting permits that included tags for wild goats, deer, and bighorn sheep.
Catherine: And what about Kodiaks? NICK: That would be a no. Mr. Hollis's wife's on her way to P.D., so I'm gonna head over there right now.

 
 
Faith Hollis: To be honest, I haven't seen my husband in over a year.
Nick: You were separated?
Faith Hollis: He made it big in venture capital. Retired at 32. That's when we started having problems. The officer said Rod died while hunting. Can I ask what happened?
Nick: He was mauled by a bear. Ms. Hollis, I have reason to believe there was somebody else out there with him. Any idea who?
Faith Hollis: No. In our circle of friends, he was the only one who owned a gun. We used to fight about his sport. I showed him studies about how the animals suffer, how even the best hunters don't always get center shots. Well ... I guess brutality begets brutality.

 
 
Robbins: C.O.D. is asphyxia due to manual strangulation. Petechiae in the eyes and mouth and extensive bruising in the strap muscles of the neck.
Grissom: Sexual assault?
Robbins: No abrasions or contusions to the v*g1n*. No semen on the SART exam.
Grissom: Is this a burn?
Robbins: No tissue reaction means it's post-mortem. If she were alive at the time, it'd have a red edge. This one's bland. Burn extends subcutaneously, so the skin made contact with something hotter than 150 degrees.

 
 
Sofia Curtis: Talk to me, Hodges.
David Hodges: Well, you kind of inundated me with work. I should be cranky. But, uh, I don't get cranky. Let's start with the white powder you found on your victim's hands. It's talcum power without the talc.
Sofia Curtis: Excuse me?
David Hodges: Talcum powder can contain asbestos fibers. Who wants to put asbestos on their baby? So, today's baby powders are made from cornstarch, and are technically talc-free. Did your victim have her baby with her at the club?
Sofia Curtis: No, he was at home.
David Hodges: So maybe the baby powder was on her hands when she left the house.
Sofia Curtis: Well, we know she was drinking, so she was probably peeing.
Dave Hodges: And unlike some of the men in this lab, whose initials are Greg Sanders, she probably washes her hands. So the baby powder shouldn't even be there. 
Sofia Curtis: Tell me about the fibers we collected from her clothing.
 
David Hodges: Blue ones have a high twist rate and are composed of nylon and polyester olefins. I'd say synthetic berber. And the red ones are under the scope.


Sofia Curtis: Trilobal. From a car. Vic's clothing was covered in them.
David Hodges: My guess, she was rolling around in someone's trunk.
Sofia Curtis: Can you be more specific?
David Hodges: You bet. It's Wilton wool. Very high-end. And given the unique shade of red, I'd say that you're looking at the world's fastest four-seat coupe: the Bentley Continental GT.
Sofia Curtis: Thank you.
 

 

 
Valet: Yeah, I was here last night.
Sofia Curtis: You park a Bentley?
Valet: Oh, man, my memory's not so good since, um ... well, I can't really remember.
Brass: You don't remember a Bentley?
Valet: Let me see what I got.
 
Brass: Yeah.
Valet: Yeah, here you go. One Bentley. Came in at 8:32. Parked it in spot
19C.
Brass: Do you remember, uh, what the driver looked like?
Sofia Curtis: Male? Female? Black? Caucasian?
Brass: Young? Old? He have a hat on?
Valet:  Sorry. 
Brass: Okay.
Valet: Sorry ... 



Sara: Amy.  Thanks for coming.
Amy Maynard: Of course. How can I help?
Sara: The other night at the club, I was wondering if you happened to notice anyone driving a Bentley.
Amy Maynard: That would be me. Birthday gift from my father.
Sara: Would you mind if I took a look at it?
Amy Maynard: You want to see my car? Why?
Sara: We found fibers from a Bentley on Lori's clothing.
Amy Maynard: Lori was in my car all the time, especially last week.  Mark was using hers.
Sara: The fibers we found are from the floor or a trunk.
 
Amy Maynard: It's in the lot. I'll call my father. He'll pick me up.

Sara: Amy ... did Lori use the ladies' room at the club?
 
Amy Maynard: Yeah. We both did.
Sara: Do you know if she washed her hands?
Amy Maynard: Why are you asking me all these questions?
Sara: We're pursuing a lead.
Amy Maynard: Lori was like a sister to me. Investigate me all you want, but when you're done, you should take a look at Mark.
Sara: Mark. I thought you said ...
Amy Maynard:  I know what I said. That was before she turned up dead. And I'm not saying he did it, and Lori ... she never said anything. It's just sometimes, um ... he can get rough.

Sara: And you know this because ... ? 
You were the other woman.
Amy Maynard: One of them. I'm not proud of it.
Sara: Did Mark get rough with you?
Amy Maynard: That's why I ended it.



;



 
 
 
Greg: You started without me.
Sara: Actually, I finished without you. Take a look.
Greg: Carpet's black. Fibers on the vic's clothing were red.
Sara: Obviously, we can rule out this car.
Greg: I don't mean to pry, but you want to talk about what happened with you and Ecklie?
Sara: Not really.
Greg: I don't know if you know this about me, but I'm a good listener.
Sara: I blew up at Ecklie. It was very unprofessional. And very satisfying, and now I'm moving on. Thanks for asking.
 


 
 
Mark Kyman:  Joey just fell asleep, so please, keep your voices down.
Sofia Curtis: All we need is a sample of baby powder.
 
Grissom:  This is Berber carpet, isn't it?
Mark Kyman: Yeah, Lori thought it'd be good for a boy's room.
 
Grissom: I'd like to take a small sample.
 
Mark Kyman: What's going on?
Grissom: Just collecting evidence.
Mark Kyman: You're coming after me? Because I've cooperated. I've let you swab my mouth and let you take my prints. I love my wife. I miss her.
 

 
 
 
Sara: DNA from Lori's shirt came back. It matches her husband.
Sofia Curtis: That could be probative.
 
Grissom: Or casual transfer unrelated to the case.
Sara: I also picked up your trace results.
(She hands the print results to Grissom. The findings read:
CORNSTARCH, ZINC OXIDE, TOCOPHERYLZ
SAMPLE IS CONSISTENT WITH EVIDENCE COLLECTED
FROM LORI KYMAN AUTOPSY )
Grissom: Baby powder on Lori's palms is consistent with the baby powder we found at the Kymans' residence.
Sara: According to her girlfriend, Lori washed her hands at the club.
Sofia Curtis: Which suggests that Lori came home before she was killed.
Grissom: Which contradicts the husband's account.
Sara: I hate to state the obvious, but maybe the husband is lying.
Sofia Curtis: All right, well, let's say she came home first.
 
Sofia Curtis: Mark killed her, drove her out to Sutor, and dumped the body.
Grissom: One problem. Mark doesn't have a car and the carpet fibers we found on Lori's clothing are inconsistent with her Lexus.
Sara: Or, maybe Lori came home, she and Mark had a fight. Maybe she found out he was fooling around again.
 
Sara:  She takes off, drives around.
 
Sara:  Tire eventually goes flat.
 
Sara:  She pulls over to the side of the road and a stranger comes along and abducts her.
 
Sofia Curtis:  A stranger driving a Bentley?
 
Grissom:  Hey, the rich are just as deviant as the poor.

BULLET FRAGMENT
2-10-05
DB
C. WILLOWS
 
DISSOLVE TO:

 
Warrick: Hey, Dawson.
Bobby Dawson: Yo.
Warrick: Any progress on those bullets? Well, the copper jacket came from your vic's rifle there. A .30-caliber Winchester, model 70.
Warrick: What about the fatal bullet?
Bobby Dawson: That came from a .357 magnum revolver.
Warrick: A .357?
Bobby Dawson: Ran the baby through IBIS and get this: The gun was used in a '98 robbery. The suspect was arrested but released on insufficient evidence and the gun was returned.
Warrick: You got a name for him?
Bobby Dawson: Aaron Colite, from Henderson.


 
 
Warrick: Why don't you just stand up by the counter, sir? Here's your warrant that we have here for your .357 magnum revolver. We know you once used it in a '98 robbery. Serial number ML5684. We don't want you to get it. Why don't you just point and show us where it is.
Aaron Colite: What's this about?
Nick: Where's the gun, sir?
Aaron Colite: Right under the TV.
 
Nick: Okay, Mr. Colite, this gun is going into evidence.
Aaron Colite: Look, I was cleared in that robbery years ago.
Nick: You know, someone killed a Kodiak bear up in the Black Mountains the day before yesterday. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?
Aaron Colite: Yeah, I did. I killed it.
Nick: Excuse me?
Aaron Colite: I killed it. Look, I was ... I was out hunting.
 
Rod Hollis: Help! Help me! ROD HOLLIS: Stop! Help! ROD HOLLIS: Help me! Help! ROD HOLLIS: Help!

 
Aaron Colite: By the time I shot the bear, the guy was already dead.
Nick: You mind if I have a look around?
Aaron Colite: Yeah, I do, actually.
Warrick: You just admitted a felony of killing a bear. Why didn't you report it?
 
Aaron Colite: I've been through the wringer with you guys once before. I figured a guy was dead. There was nothing I could do about it. I took off.
 
Aaron Colite: Look, I've got a hunting license with tags. I was out hunting deer. Tried to save a guy's life. That's it.
 
Nick: Whoa, Mr. Colite. I just have one more question for you. How long have you been storing gallbladders with your ice cream?
Aaron Colite: It ain't illegal to cut up a dead animal as long as it's already dead. That's the law.
Warrick: Could you lift your pants leg for me, please, sir?
Aaron Colite: For what?
Warrick: Someone snagged their pant leg on a tree, probably cut themselves. I wanted to see if it was you.
 
Aaron Colite: Take a look. Wasn't me.


 
 
Catherine: So Robbins sent the bear's blood to tox. It turns out there were elevated levels of ketamine in its system.
Nick: Barbiturates?
Catherine:  Yeah.
 
Nick: I think I know what's going on here, Catherine.



Nick: They're called canned hunts. Going on all over the country.
Catherine: I'm sorry. There's just no sport in that. It's just sick.
Nick: Well, you got that right. Point is, you don't have to go to Africa to hunt wild game anymore. If you've got the money, Africa comes to you.
Catherine: And they drug the animals?
Nick: To guarantee a kill, yeah.
Catherine: But in our case, both the hunter and the prey ended up dead.
Nick: Something went wrong.


 
Sara: Hey. Oh, filling out reports?
 
Grissom: They tell me it's my job.  You doing okay?
Sara: Yeah. Thanks. I, uh, did a DMV search. There are only five Bentleys with red interior registered in Clark County. Two are leased. Two are privately owned. I ran the ROs. Nothing suspicious. PD is following up.
Grissom: What about the fifth one?
Sara: Well, that one is owned by a Boutique Rental Car Agency. I subpoenaed the rental history. Diane Hoyt, Lori's mother, had the car for the last two weeks. She returned it the day after Lori disappeared.
Grissom: Where is it now?

 
 
Greg: If you've added up every cent I've made in my entire life, I still wouldn't be able to afford half this car.
 
Sara: Yeah, but why would you want it? The insurance premiums are sky-high. Not to mention theft, scratches.
Greg: It's art. And I'd have every girl in the neighborhood after me.
Sofia Curtis: Not when they saw your apartment.
Sara: You've been to Greg's apartment?
Sofia Curtis: Who hasn't?
 
Greg: Red carpet. Same as the interior.
Sara: Recently vacuumed.
Sofia Curtis: We got better vacuums.
VARIOUS CUTS OF THE CAR BEING PROCESSED

 


 
Sara: You found pods in the victim's hair, right?
 
Sofia Curtis: Same shape, size, color. Too bad we can't ID this pod and tie it to that tree.
Greg: Who says we can't? Plant DNA is no different than human DNA. In fact, a plant genome is larger. I'm on it.
Sofia Curtis: If we can prove the pod came from that dump site, you know what that means?
Sara: Lori's mother is a viable suspect.




 

 

 
 
Carol Allred : Why are you asking my client about a rental car?
Brass: It may be probative to our investigation of her daughter's death.
Diane Hoyt: I'll answer anything they want. I backed my car into a telephone pole. So I put it in the shop. I had to rent a car.
Brass: At a grand a day, a Bentley's a little extravagant. I mean, I usually rent a Taurus.
Diane Hoyt: It's a fantasy car. Ever since Amy got hers, I've wanted one, so I splurged.
Brass: Was the vehicle ever out of your possession?
Diane Hoyt: You mean, did I let anybody drive it?
Brass: That's what I mean, yeah.
Diane Hoyt: Lori and Mark both did. But I was always with them.
Brass: Ms. Hoyt, did you drive your car to Sutor, Nevada?
Diane Hoyt: No.
Carol Allred : Where are you going with this?
Sofia Curtis: On the hood of the vehicle, which affirmatively matched the plant material we found in Lori's hair. All of which came from the same tree in Sutor.
Carol Allred : Okay, but my client returned the Bentley the day before yesterday. It was washed and then rented again, so perhaps that individual drove through Sutor on his or her way out of town. Or, as you know, that &quot;pod&quot; could be weeks or months old.
Sofia Curtis: We also collected a number of errant hairs from the vehicle. Several are consistent with Mark and Lori's DNA and also Joey's, but not yours.
Carol Allred : Okay, I'm sorry. You don't have a DNA sample of my client's for comparison purposes.
Sofia Curtis: No, but we have her daughter's. You're not Lori's biological mother, are you?
Diane Hoyt: I'm her stepmom. That's not a secret.  I couldn't have children of my own. Ever since Lori's father died a few months ago, she's all I had. 
 
Diane Hoyt: Look, Mark is devastated. I really should get back to my grandson.
Sofia Curtis: Before you go, could we take a DNA sample?
Carol Allred : You do not have to do that.
Brass: Yeah, but if she has nothing to hide, it's no big deal.
Sofia Curtis: Could you open your mouth?
 
Carol Allred : All right. That's it. We're finished here. Let's go.
 
 

 
 
Sofia Curtis: What are you thinking?

Brass: We have nothing to arrest her on.
 
 
 
Sofia Curtis: And we have unexplained evidence placing Lori back at the house after her night out.
 
Brass: That's why I like the husband. Maybe they're in it together.
Sofia Curtis: Well, when two people of the opposite s*x conspire to kill one of their partners, s*x or money is almost always involved. Now, Lori's friend, Amy, did say Mark was a player.
Brass: Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
Sofia Curtis: I had this boyfriend back in college, and when he got his first Harley, well, let's just say we sat face-to-face and went for a ride.
Brass: A Bentley is a lot more comfortable than a bike.



 
 


 
Ronnie Litre: Document was forged by taking an official license issued by the Department of Agriculture and scraping away the top layer of information. Document was then photocopied, and the bogus info was typed in. Take a look.
Catherine: Mm-hmm. A simple forgery, but it doesn't get us any closer to our suspect.
Ronnie Litre: Actually, it does. See, a couple years back, some photocopier companies started imbedding their machines with serial numbers less than a millimeter in size and visible only under a blue L-E-D light.
Catherine: Of course.
 
Catherine:  I see it.
Ronnie Litre: It's as good as fingerprint.
Catherine: Thanks.

 
 
Sam Tracy: And you think the broker's documentation was forged here on my copier?
Catherine: We know it was.
Warrick: Mr. Tracy, tell us about canned hunts.
Sam Tracy: Uh, a wild animal is released into a controlled area where a hunter pays a fee to kill it. The promoters guarantee a trophy, so no kill, no pay. They're illegal in Nevada. Is that what happened to my bear?
Catherine: Aaron Colite worked here, right?
Sam Tracy: Yeah. Maintenance.
Catherine: You fired him?
Sam Tracy: About six months ago. We let a lot people go. Cutbacks.
Warrick: Well, the evidence places Aaron at the crime scene.
Sam Tracy: Wait, so you're thinking he forged the broker's document and took Tippy under false pretenses?
Warrick: No. We spoke to your distributor. Your copy machine was only installed two months ago. We think you created the false document.
Catherine: We suspect that Aaron figured out a way to make a buck, and he asked for your help.
Warrick: So Aaron organizes this canned hunt. A few days ago, you guys meet up with Rod Hollis up at Lake Mead .
 
Aaron Colite: Rod, Rod, Rod, Rod!
Aaron Colite: Right there. You see him?
 
Rod Hollis: Yes!
 
Rod Hollis: Yes! I got him!
Aaron Colite: Yep, you got him.
 
Catherine: Mr. Hollis probably thought that he had killed the bear, and he raced over to claim his trophy.

 
Rod Hollis: Help! Help! Help me! Help!

 
Catherine: His shot only stunned the bear. It was Aaron's shot that killed it.
Sam Tracy: You can't prove I was there.
Warrick: Would you lift up your pants legs, please, sir?
Sam Tracy: What?
Warrick: I have the judge on speed dial. You want to save me some time here?

Rod Hollis: Help! Help! Help me!
 
 
Sam Tracy: I got this gardening.
Warrick: We subpoenaed Aaron's bank records. Rod Hollis sent Aaron a check for
$16,000. Aaron sent you a check for $8,000. That's a 50-50 split.
Catherine: You're looking at grand larceny and obtaining property under false pretenses.
Warrick: That's about twenty years right there.
Catherine: I'm recommending to the DA that he add another charge: Second degree murder ... 

Catherine: ... for the death of the hunter.



 
Sara: We found your client's semen mixed with a vaginal contribution from Diane Hoyt in the back of her rental car. You said you had nothing to do with Lori's murder. Would you like to revise that statement?
Brad Himmel: No. I met Diane, uh, two weeks ago at Rain. Banged the cougar that night, but I had no idea she was anybody's mother.
Sara: So you haven't spoken to her since?
Brad Himmel: Well, that's the whole point of banging a cougar -- you never got to see 'em again.
Sara: One lie after another.
Margaret Finn : Are you questioning my client's veracity?
 
Sara: These are your client's cell phone records. Semen in the car was enough to get a warrant. On the night that Lori was murdered, he called Ms. Hoyt on her cell phone at 11:23 P.M.


 
Diane Hoyt: No, I don't know him.
Sofia Curtis: You've never seen or spoken to this man?
Diane Hoyt: No, not that I remember.
Sofia Curtis: Hmm. Do you remember the men you have s*x with?
Carol Allred : Ms. Curtis, that is uncalled for.

Sara: Here's the deal. Lori left the club around eleven. By your client's own admission, he followed her for about twenty minutes, waiting for the tire to go flat. When it didn't, you called her mother.

Sofia Curtis: It was all a setup. Brad was going to strike up a conversation with Lori at the club, and on her way home, abduct her. And then, one or both of you were going to kill her.
 
Sofia Curtis: But when you got his call ... You went to plan B.
Diane Hoyt: I left Lori's house, drove home and went to bed.
Sofia Curtis: You never left. Mark fell asleep in the living room, and you waited for Lori to come home.
 
Sofia Curtis: Lori's body was too heavy for you to carry, so you called for help ... on Mark and Lori's phone.
 

Sara: You got her call at 1:17 A.M. Coroner puts Lori's death at some time between 12:00 and 1:00 A.M.
Brad Himmel: Well, which means I didn't kill her, like I told you.
Margaret Finn : Brad, be quiet.
Sara: Oh, I never thought you did kill her, but you did help get rid of the body, and that is conspiracy after the fact.

Carol Allred : Now, Mark would've heard something, and if he's claiming he didn't, I'd be looking at him.
Sofia Curtis: The living room's at the other end of the house. He was asleep.
Carol Allred : Prove it.
Sofia Curtis: I don't need to. We found something of Lori's on the rental exhaust pipe: Her skin.
 
Sofia Curtis: Your client's on record. The vehicle was never out of her possession.

Sara: You drove back to the house, picked up Lori's Lexus, drove back into town. Tire went flat off Boulder Highway.
Margaret Finn : You can't prove that.
Sara: When we suspected Brad's involvement, we printed the interior of the Lexus. Your prints are on the steering wheel.
 
Margaret Finn : Is there a deal to be made?
Sara: Why did Diane Hoyt want Lori dead?
Brad Himmel: I don't know. The lady paid me 2,000 bucks. Um ... said she was having a fight with her daughter and wanted to make good ... um, only Lori wouldn't return her calls, so it was my job to get 'em together. When she called me and asked me for my help later that night, she said she'd pay me
$2,000 more.

 
 
Greg: I know why she did it. While you two were at P.D., I called the family lawyer. He faxed over a copy of Lori's father's trust. Estate's worth $50 million.
Sofia Curtis: He left it all to Lori?
Greg: No, to her son. Lori was the trustee with a stipend of $2.5 mil a year. If anything were to happen to Lori, guess who takes her place?
Sara: Her stepmom.
Greg: Yup.
 
Sofia Curtis: Listen, you guys, I'll catch up later.
 
Greg: Hmm. She's fitting in pretty well, huh?
 


 
Sofia Curtis: You got a minute?
Grissom: Sure. You did a nice job on the case.
Sofia Curtis: I, uh ... I just wanted you to know that I've enjoyed working with you.
 
Grissom: Well, I've enjoyed working with you as well.
Sofia Curtis: No, it's time I made a change. I don't like the direction the lab's headed.
 
Grissom: You mean Ecklie? You can't pay any attention to him.
Sofia Curtis: No, you got a good team, but I was a supervisor. My demotion was undeserved, and every day I'm here, I'm reminded of that.
 
Sofia Curtis: What?
Grissom: Well, someone once said, &quot;What we are never changes, but who we are ... never stops changing.&quot; 
 
Grissom: Let's have dinner, shall we?

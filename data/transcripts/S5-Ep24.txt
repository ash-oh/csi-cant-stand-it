Nick: 
It was Christmas in Las Vegas / when the locals take the town
Theresa hit a streak / and laid her waitress apron down 

 
Nick:  she was playing penny poker 

 
Nick: 
over at the old Gold Spike
she's tired of Texas hold 'em
so she switched to let it ride 
 
Nick: 
then over on Fremont Street
six pits won her a car
she rode it up the strip to where the flashy hotels are 


 
 
Nick: 
at first, she hit a royal
not a dirty one this time
and then she drew four deuces ... 
 
 
 
D.A. :  Nick.
 
Nick: D.A. What's going on out here?
D.A. : Well, anonymous 9-1-1 caller reported body parts in this area. I rolled and found this.
 
Nick: Hmm. Tasty.
 
D.A. : Have any idea how long it's going to take you to get this stuff out of here?
Nick: Well ... I can't move the, uh ... the &quot;body&quot; until the coroner releases the scene. It's a busy night. It's probably gonna take a while, man.
 
D.A. : Great. Hey, you mind if I step away for a second? I need to get some fresher air.
Nick: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, take your time.


 

 
Nick: Whew!
 
Nick: Hey, you, uh ... want some gum?
D.A. : No, thank you.
 
 

 

 

 
 

 



 



 
 
Nick: Hey ...
 
 
Nick: Well, that's peculiar.


 
 
Brass: Think! Did you see anybody else in the area?
D.A. : 
I mean, I only took my eyes off him for a couple seconds ... 
Brass: You're not supposed to take your eyes off him ever.

Brass: He's been gone maybe twenty-five minutes.


(Continuing the evidence trail, they pass more tire marks and evidence marker
#3.) 
 
 
Catherine: I got some white fibers on Nick's vest.
 
Catherine: Smells like alcohol.
 
 
 

 
 
Catherine: Why'd you bag that?
Grissom: I didn't.
 
Catherine: It's the wrong color tape. No initials on the seal. That's not Nick's evidence.
Grissom: Maybe it's a message.

LEGEND: EARLIER THAT NIGHT
 

 
 
Grissom: Two heads are better than one.


 
Grissom: Spatter patterns are a match. One bullet, two victims.
 

 
Sara: No, no, no, no. Grissom, that isn't possible. I sampled every square inch of that scene, and there was only one DNA type on the bloodstains.
Grissom: How 'bout that? Our mystery vics are identical twins.
Sara:  Twins?
 
Sara: Well, that's different.
Grissom: Technically, it's the same.
 
Sara: What's this?
 
Grissom:  I just got it. It's a certificate of honorary ownership of Trigger, &quot;The Smartest Horse in the Movies,&quot; issued by Roy Rogers to the Children of America. Roy felt that the children of America were the true owners of Trigger, so any kid that would write him, he'd send 'em one of those.
Sara: And where did you get it?
Grissom: The Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Museum, which used to be in Victorville, California, and is now in Branson, Missouri.
Sara: Roy Rogers, the cowboy?
Grissom: King of the cowboys.  I wrote to him when I was four. He sent me one of those. I lost it, so I thought I'd replace it.
Sara:  And then you thought you would frame it.
Grissom: Yeah.
 


 
Hodges: The object of the game is to be the first one to make it to Uncle Jesse's farm without running into Roscoe. Now, there's two ways to do that. You can either take the dirt road or the highway. Dirt road is slower because you can only roll with one dice, but it's safe because you don't run into any of the Hazzard cards that you would find on the highway, right? 
 
Hodges: But when you are on the highway, you get to roll two dice, which makes you go faster. 
 
Hodges: Pretend I'm gonna take the highway, so I'm gonna move General Lee eight spaces.  One, two, three, four, five ... eight. 
 
Hodges: I hit a Hazzard card.  &quot;Cooter splashes mud on your windshield.&quot;
You lose one turn, all right?
 
Hodges: Think you got it?
Greg: I think I got it.
Hodges: All right, cool.
Greg: All right, well, I've never been one to take the path of least resistance, so I'm going for the dirt road. One dice.
Hodges: You know, far be it from me to wax nostalgic, but, uh, I kind of miss the old Greg. Ugly t-shirts, goofy hair, semi-pornographic magazines ...
Greg: Yeah, well, at least I had a style to change.  One, two, three, four. &quot;Take a Duke card.&quot; What's a Duke card?
Hodges: Duke cards are good. You want one of those 'cause it gets you through the dirt road a lot faster.
Greg: Okay, so Duke cards, good; Hazzard cards, bad.
Hodges: Correct.
 
Greg:  &quot;You jumped over a pile of rocks. Move five extra spaces.&quot;
Hodges: Nice.
Greg: Yeah-hoo.
 
Hodges: Oh, and by the way, uh ... this is just the work me. You haven't had the full David Hodges experience.

Greg: I think I'm having it right now.

 
 
Archie Johnson: Aw, come on, you can't unfund me now. I ... I'm committed to presenting the paper at SWAFS next month.
Conrad Ecklie: If it means that much to you, pay your own way. Show a little dedication to your discipline.
 
Archie Johnson: Oh, yeah. Tragically, my banking account isn't as dedicated as I am.
Conrad Ecklie: One word: Plastic.
Archie Johnson: Wait. How 'bout you kick me a little overtime under the table, huh?
Conrad Ecklie: Over my dead body. Have you been to Grissom's office? You think the City of Las Vegas pays for his etymology library, his insect collection, his shrunken head collection? No. Take initiative. People notice.
 

 
 
Warrick: ... So I took my girl to that Ultimate Fight Championship on Saturday night.
 
Nick: Oh, yeah, yeah, down over at the, uh, Spur?
Warrick: Yeah. Almost ended up getting into a smackdown of my own.
Nick: No way. You almost got into a beef?
Warrick: You know, Tina doesn't like me carrying a gun. I play down the fact that I'm a cop when I'm with her anyway.
Nick: Yeah, yeah, you play the scientist card.  You're a &quot;copologist.&quot;
 
Warrick: So, uh, we're standing out in front of the hotel, making out and this guy walks up to me, gets in my face, and asks me how she is.
 
Nick: No, he didn't.
 
Nick: So?
Warrick: I tell him to get lost. He says, &quot;Make me.&quot;  So I took a step forward and out of nowhere his big, fat bodyguard, looking like wimpy from Popeye, walks up and starts to close in on me.
Nick: So, this is out in front of the hotel?
Warrick: It was at the valet parking, which might as well be in Arizona, it's so far away from the lobby. This fat boy is looking like he's obviously carrying some sort of weapon. And I'm standing there naked as a p0rn star with my girl.
Nick: Did you tell them you're a &quot;cop&quot;?
Warrick: They didn't seem to care. One of the guys sounded Russian, like he was wanna-be Mafia.
Nick: Mm-hmm.
Warrick: Fat boy was obviously his bodyguard.
Nick: Mm-hmm.
Warrick: So, uh, you know, I wasn't physically afraid of the guys, but something was kind of sinister about them. They were provoking me, but they weren't making a move. It was almost like they were waiting for me to make a move. Say if I smacked big-mouth, fat boy would've came over and stabbed me or something. Even fat boy was vibing me not to take the bait.
 
Nick: So what happened?
Warrick: Well, valet finally brought Tina's car up. So, I maneuver her around these guys and I put her in her car, and I turn my back to them and let 'em talk this smack. I'm calming Tina down. Tell her everything is fine. She drives off and I walk away. I called Tina later on and I tell her, uh, you know, if she got any problem with me being a cop, she needs to get over it, 'cause now I'm packing.
Nick: Yeah. Yeah. What'd you do on Sunday?
Warrick: Scoured the hotel looking for these punks.

 
 
 
Catherine: Oh, my two favorite guys. So, I've got an assault at Stripperama and a trash run at Flamingo and Koval. I'm too busy to play favorites, so duke it out.
 
Nick: Duke it out.
 
Nick: Boy! Better flip a coin. I'll hurt you.
 
Warrick: Yeah, you better flip that coin.
 
Nick: Call it in the air.
Warrick: Heads.
 
Warrick: Have fun at the trash run.

Nick: You know, I'd do two out of three, but you got a gambling problem.
 
Nick: No, hey, you know what?  You keep this. It's bad luck.
 







 








 
 
 
 
Catherine: Dumpster's clean. 
 
Catherine: No apparent blood or body parts.
Grissom:  Take a look at this.
 
Grissom: This seems contrived to me. The blood pool is too perfect. There's no splatter. Like somebody placed these entrails.
 
Catherine: A lure. To grab Nick.
 
Catherine: David, get this stuff to the doc.
David Phillips: Look, I'm ... I'm really sorry I didn't get here sooner. Maybe if I had ... 
Catherine: We're going to get him back, David.
 
Conrad Ecklie: Gil, Catherine. I want you to know, as far as I'm concerned, lab's only got one case tonight. Same for the rest of the department.
 
Grissom: Thanks, Conrad.
 
Warrick: Hey. 
 
Warrick: What do you need me to do?
 
 
Officer: That's it, boy. Here you go. Here you go.
 
Voice:  That's it. Whatcha got. Here you go.
 
Officer: They've lost the scent. Might be as far as it goes.
 
Warrick: Yeah, there was some sort of large vehicle here. 
 

 
 
 
 


 
Robbins: Well, there are a lot of intestines here, but no appendix, which made sense when I saw this. A cecum.
Catherine: Dog entrails.
Robbins: Yeah.
Catherine: That's not going to help.
 
Robbins: I'm sorry. Catherine ... has Nick's family been informed?
Catherine: No, that would be my job.


 
 
Sara: I swabbed the seal for epithelials, but there were no prints on the outside of the bag.
Grissom: What about Nick's camera?
Sara: No fingerprints. There were some photographs, mostly generals. There were a few detail shots of entrails and trash. But no lucky grabs of anybody else at the scene.
Grissom: I don't think we're gonna get lucky with this guy. He knows how to work clean.

Greg: Grissom, I pulled all of Nick's active and recent cases.
Grissom: I want to know anyone who had a grudge against him. Civilian complaints, death threats ...
Greg: Got it.
Grissom: There was a guy a couple of years ago that stalked him. He may be back.
Greg: I remember. Top of the pile.
 
 
 
Hodges: I'm using your track and wheelbase measurements plus or minus five percent to account for rain-shadowing and/or drying effects.

Warrick: All right, print it out.

 
 
Warrick: I need you to bring up the traffic cameras in a three-block radius between Flamingo and Koval in the last 24 hours.
Dispatch Officer: We only buffer the video for the past few hours. I can take you back as far as 10:37 P.M.
 
Warrick: That's good enough. Our guy was taken around 11:00. 
 
Warrick: Scan forward. We're looking for a big truck.
 
Dispatch Officer: How about that one? Looks like a Suburban.
 
Warrick: It's on the list.
 
Warrick: Whoa, he's really moving.
 
Warrick: Wait a minute. That one, the big Ford.
 
Warrick: Follow it.




 
 

 
 
 

 
 
Warrick: The Expedition truck left the area around 11:15. Definitely in a hurry. Took a right off Koval onto Tropicana, crossed Las Vegas Boulevard onto
215 east. And then it drove off the grid.
Grissom: At least we have a general direction.
Sara: Great, so Nick could be anywhere from Green Valley to Seven Hills to Arizona.
Greg: Assuming he was in that truck.
Catherine: Well, according to Hodges, the white fibers on Nick's vest were cotton with traces of ether ...
 
Sara: Ether?
Catherine: Yeah.
Sara: That's old school.
Warrick: Yeah, stuff is volatile. Flammable. Outside of meth cooks, no one uses it anymore.
Grissom: People use what they know.
Catherine: All right, so, where are we on possible suspects?
Greg: So far, none of Nick's active or recent cases stands out. And his old stalker's still bend bars.
Sara: Maybe it's a random act.
Catherine: Well, that's possible. Because whoever staged the crime scene couldn't have known that Nick was going to respond.
Warrick: Yeah, it was just bad luck he did.
 
Grissom: Sara, what about the coffee cup?
Sara: No DNA or prints on the cup or in the bag.
 
Hodges:  Don't touch the edge of it!
Delivery Man:  You got to sign ...
Hodges:  Security! Security!


 
Delivery Man:  Get your freakin' hands off me, man!
 
Hodges: Hold still. Hold still. Hold still.
 
Delivery Man:  Hey, I told you, you got to sign for that!
 
Grissom: What are you doing, Hodges?
Hodges: Guy comes in here with a package with no return address.
Delivery Man:  You're violating my rights! I want a lawyer!
Catherine: Shut up.
Hodges: Way the guy was pawing that envelope, I figure I better get it away from him before he wipes off all the trace.
Grissom: What trace?
Hodges:  It's about Nick.
(Hodges steps back and shows Grissom the envelope. The label reads:
CRIME LAB
3657 WESTFALL AVE
LAS VEGAS, NV 89109
RE: STOKES
 
Grissom: Let me do this.
 

 

 

 
 
 
 

 




 
 
 

 
 
 
 
Walter Gordon :  Hi, CSI guy. You wondering why you're here? Because you followed the evidence. Because that's what CSIs do. So breathe quick, breathe slow, put your gun in your mouth and pull the trigger. Any way you like, you're going to die here. Okay.

Catherine: I don't think he knows we can see him.
Sara: How can we be sure it's a live feed?
Warrick: We've got to assume that it is.
Grissom: The space in that box looks like 2x2x6, which would be 24 cubic feet.
 
Grissom: That would hold approximately 600 liters of air. If you figure half a liter per breath.
 
Grissom: Slow breathing ...

Grissom: Maybe 12 breaths per minute. Panic breathing would be, what, twice that much.
 
Grissom: Well, if the math is right, he's got about an hour and 15 minutes of air left in that box.
Catherine: But if they're going to keep him alive for 12 hours, it must mean that he's got an additional air supply.

 
 
 
(The feed ends and it returns to the screen:
&quot;YOU CAN ONLY WATCH&quot;
Archie Johnson: We lost the feed.

 
 

Warrick: Looks like a live feed to me. I say we keep the light on.



 
 
Brass: I'm gonna get right to it, because time is of the essence here.  Where'd you get that package, bud?
Lawyer:  I'd like to advise my client. Careful how you answer that, son. This man here's slicker than a snake in the curly green grass.
Brass: He's right, so you better be careful.
Delivery Man: I got called out to a pickup on Viking Circle. W-when I got there, I didn't talk to an actual person. I just found an abandoned package with some cash taped to it.
Brass: How much cash?
Lawyer: Whoa, whoa, whoa. That's confidential business 'tween me and this here buckaroo.
Brass: Easy, boots. I'm gonna need those bills.
Delivery Man: It was a hundred bucks. If you want it back, you're gonna have to ask Steve Wynn.
Brass: What's the address?


 
 
Brass: Code four. Code four.
 


 
Brass:  Yeah, the address was a waste of time. Nothing here but a fat drunk and a bad smell.


 
Grissom:  The guy probably picked the house at random, 'cause he knew we'd chase it.
Brass:  Any news on the web cam location?
Grissom:  Archie's trying to narrow it down. The feed stays active for two minutes every time you press the &quot;WATCH&quot; button. But I got to go. I got people to see.
Brass:  Okay.
 
Conrad Ecklie: Everybody, I have some bad news. Uh, a little while ago, I spoke with the mayor directly. The City of Las Vegas is not going to finance a ransom. It's-it's against department policy to negotiate with terrorists. No exceptions.


 
Catherine: Judge Stokes, Mrs. Stokes, Gil Grissom.
Grissom: Your honor. Mrs. Stokes. I'm, uh, sorry that we're meeting under these circumstances.
Judge Bill Stokes: Have you been able to make contact with the animals who took my son?
 
Catherine: No, we haven't yet, but ... they should be contacting us in roughly four hours.
Jillian Stokes: We were able to rustle up $20,000 cash. Our bank's prepared to wire another $100,000. Now, we can sell the cars. We can hock the ranch ... we can make the number, but it's gonna take at least another day.
Grissom: Judge Stokes ... 
 
Jillian Stokes:  Can we give them ... the money we have now, try to buy more time?
 
Grissom: I don't think that will help.
Judge Bill Stokes: There's got to be something we can do.
Catherine: You've already done it by coming here, by showing your support ... 
Jillian Stokes: We're not here to show support. We're here to get Nick home.
Grissom: We're not sure who has your son ... or why.
Judge Stokes: Well ... what the hell do you know?
Grissom: Very little.
Judge Bill Stokes: Let's just cut to the gist. What proof do you have that my boy's still alive?



 
 

 
 
 
Judge Bill Stokes: Pancho ... What the hell you got yourself into?

 

 



 





 
 
Undersheriff McKeen:  If the mayor wants a briefing, tell him I'll give him one after the press conference so I don't have to brief him twice, okay? Set it up.
 
Conrad Ecklie: Sir. 
Undersheriff McKeen: Tell me you found him so I can tell the sheriff when his plane lands.
Conrad Ecklie: I wish I could. Listen, I've been looking over my budget. There are a number of things we can do within the lab itself to raise the ransom.
Undersheriff McKeen: There's no way -- not even a situation like this -- that's going to make the sheriff cut back on services to our taxpayers.
Conrad Ecklie: We wouldn't have to. I'm proposing we eliminate all overtime on lab work except for priority cases, stop hiring based on attrition, reassign existing personnel based on peak staffing needs. Over the next fiscal year, that should clear at least a million.
Undersheriff McKeen: Assuming any of those measures actually saves money, which isn't really the issue here, is it?
Conrad Ecklie: I'll take the heat.
Undersheriff McKeen:  You want to do something for your people? Get 'em ready for a funeral.
 


 
Tony Curtis: You should have seen this town in the early '70s. Gamblers were kings.
Frank Gorshin: Yeah, not the same anymore.
Tony Curtis: Showgirls were showgirls. Everybody knew your name in those days.
Frank Gorshin: You could dress up in drag, huh?
Tony Curtis: Me, dress up in drag? Who do you think you're talking to, Jack Lemmon?
 
Frank Gorshin: That's good.
Tony Curtis: Anyway, we had a good time in those days, you know? You could walk down the streets in this town 15, 20 years ago with 50,000 bucks stacked on the top of your head in singles, and nobody would bother you.  Except this guy. He would bother you.
Sam Braun: It's either your money or it's my money.
Frank Gorshin: Hey, w-w-w-w-w-w ... I gave you that line. It's bad enough you're on top of that casino saying, &quot;come into my place.&quot; That's the other guy -- the richer one.
Tony Curtis: Take it easy.
Frank Gorshin: Easy? What do you mean easy? You talking about yourself?  &quot;I'd rather stick needles in my eyes.&quot;

 
Frank Gorshin:  What do you think of that?
Tony Curtis: Weren't we in the Vikings together?
Frank Gorshin:  Oh, I remember it well, Tony.
 
Tony Curtis: That's the best Burt Lancaster I ever heard.

Catherine: Sam?
Frank Gorshin:  Oh, miss, I like my coffee with cream and sugar, and I want you to give the r-r-really big check to really big Sam over here.
Catherine: Sam, I need to talk to you.
Showgirl: He's already got someone to talk to, ma'am.
Catherine: Zip it, sweetheart. Sam ...
Sam Braun: Everyone, I'd like for you to meet my daughter, Catherine.
Frank Gorshin:  Well, you can cancel the coffee.
Sam Braun: Excuse us for a minute, all right?
 
Tony Curtis: Certainly.


 
Catherine: One of my guys is in trouble. He's been kidnapped. I need a million dollars in cash. Large bills. And I need it now.
Sam Braun: Let me guess, Mugs. The department won't pay the ransom.
Catherine: No.
Sam Braun: Why should I?
Catherine: Considering the problems that you've had with the law, you could use some good publicity.
Sam Braun: Do I look like a man that needs publicity? If you're coming to me like a cop with a tin cup in your hand, the answer is no.
Catherine: I'm not here as a cop.
Sam Braun: Then ask me like you were my daughter.


 
Catherine: I got the money.
Grissom: From where?
Catherine: Where do you think?
 
Grissom: Catherine, if the press finds out about this, it'll look like Sam Braun bribed the lab.
Catherine: He's a casino owner. A leader of industry. Never convicted of any crime. And right now, I don't care about the integrity of the lab at the moment. I care about Nick.
Grissom: Yeah, well, so do I, but nonetheless ...
Catherine:  Well, you're sitting here like Jack Handy with your deep thoughts, staring at a coffee cup. You got a better plan, I'm all ears.
 
Grissom: All right. But I make the drop. You're hands off.
Catherine: That's my money.
Grissom: You can't be seen anywhere near this money. It was given to the lab anonymously. Agreed?
Catherine:  Agreed.

Grissom: Las Vegas Crime Lab.
Walter Gordon:  Through the door.
 

 
Walter Gordon: Pretty quiet outside. Almost sounds like you came alone.
Grissom: I've got your money.
 
Walter Gordon: Put it down. 
 
Walter Gordon: Slide it over. 
 
 
Walter Gordon: You're telling me there's a million dollars in here.
Grissom: Yes.
Walter Gordon: Along with some cute little booby traps? Which is it -- a tracer, a dye pack?
Grissom:  Normally, you'd be 100% right, but this time, you're
100% wrong. We want Nick back, no tricks.

Walter Gordon: This looks real.
Grissom: It is real. Where is Nick?
 
Walter Gordon: You know, I was under the impression it was against departmental policy to negotiate with terrorists.
Grissom: Are you a terrorist?
Walter Gordon: Depends. 
 
Walter Gordon: Are you terrified?
Grissom: Look, I really don't want to talk to you. Where is my guy?
Walter Gordon: Oh, so ... he is 'your guy', huh?
Grissom: Yes, he is. Where is he buried?
Walter Gordon: Are you two close?
Grissom: That's none of your business.
Walter Gordon: What does Nick Stokes mean to you? How do you feel when you see him in that coffin? Does your soul die every time you push that button? How do you feel, knowing that there's nothing you can do to get him out of that hell? Helpless ... useless ... impotent?
 
Walter Gordon: Good. Welcome to my world.
(Walter unbuttons his jacket and shows the two red bars of HIGH EXPLOSIVES /
SEMTEX hooked up around his waist, his thumb over the detonator.) 
Walter Gordon: Uh, if I were you, I'd back up a little.

EMT: Pupils are even.
Grissom:  He blew himself up and left us with nothing.
EMT: Sir, are you experiencing any ringing in your ears?
 
Brass:  We got the kidnapper's truck. Nevada tags: 374-Robert-
Charlie-David. Run the plate.
 
Warrick: That's the wrong box, Greg.
Greg: Well, pick one. There's three.
Warrick:  That one right there.
Greg: Give me a break. I haven't done this before.
Warrick: All right, let's go over it again. The diagnostic unit gets attached to that black box, which gives us the mileage of his last trip. Like an airplane.
Greg: That gives us the radius for the search area.
Warrick: Right.
Greg: Got it.
 
Warrick: Twenty-three miles. We know he was heading east on the 215.
Greg: I'll get a map.

 
Catherine: Somebody bag this money, please? Don't get any funny ideas, either.
 
Catherine:  What I had to do to get this money and for what.
 
David Phillips: There's no ID on him.
 
Sara: I got a thumb.



 
Warrick: How's he doing?
 
Archie Johnson:  Hard to say. About the same, I guess. 
 
Archie Johnson: I'm gonna get some coffee.
Warrick: Yeah.
 



 
 

 
Nick:  Enough ... enough with the damn light!

 
 
 
Nick:  No.
 
Nick:  The fan's connected ... the fan's connected to the light.


 
 

 
NO MATCH FOUND
 


 



 
Nick: No.
 
 
 
 
 
Warrick: What are you doing, Nicky?
 
 
Warrick:  What are you doing, Nicky?
 
Warrick:  Don't do it, Nicky!

 
 
 

 
Warrick:  You son of a bitch!
 

 
 

 
Warrick: Oh.

Warrick: You're still alive.


 
 
 
Warrick:  No.
 


 
Archie Johnson: The light and the fan must have been running off the same battery.
Grissom: Well, at least Nicky's keeping it together. That's good. What about the web cam trace?
Archie Johnson: Signal's running through an anonymizer. Different ISP each time we click the button. But I think I've got a handle on the pattern. I'm getting closer.


 
 
 
 
Mia Dickerson: Sara?  I got something off your thumb.
 


 
Mia Dickerson: So when you struck out on prints, I ran DNA through CODIS, hoping maybe the guy was in the system off an open case or a prior felony. I got no straight-up match, but ...
Sara: ... but you got a moderate stringency match for a Kelly Gordon.
Mia Dickerson: Yeah, seven alleles in common, and based on the age, I'd say it was his daughter.
Sara: Good work, Mia.

*DISPO-CONVICTED
SEN: 2 YR SUMM PROB W/OUT SUPV, 90 DS JL 7--
 
Sara: Kelly Gordon is currently in state prison serving year three of a five-year sentence for accessory to murder.
 
Sara: The address of her crime scene is 625 Viking Circle. That's the same place where the messenger picked up the package. It wasn't random.
(Grissom looks through his file. He finds it:
EVIDENCE
ITEM #66 ELECTRICAL CORD
PACKAGE #4531-7
ITEM #67 STYROFOAM CUP WITH LID, PROCESS FOR DNA
ITEM #68 TELEPHONE BILL
ITEM #69 HAIRBRUSH
ITEM #70 TOOTHBRUSH

 
Man: Hey, baby, let's go.
 
 
Man 2: Hiya. How ya doing?

 
 
 
Grissom: Neither was the Styrofoam cup.

 
 
Brass: So at trial, you testified that you went with your boyfriend to visit a buddy of his. And when you went in the house, your boyfriend blew the guy away.
Kelly Gordon: He wasn't my boyfriend. I knew the guy two weeks. Why am I here?
Sara: A Styrofoam cup with your DNA on it was found in that house. You claimed you dropped it running for your life.
 

 
Kelly Gordon: My word against a cup, and the next five years, I'm being traded for cigarettes by my cellmate.
 
Kelly Gordon: You're not reopening my case. What do you want?
Sara: Your father took it pretty hard.
Brass: He was an aerospace engineer, right? Good with explosives?
Kelly Gordon: So, this is about my dad?
Brass:  You know, we had your visitor's log. Your father stopped coming to see you six weeks into your sentence.
Kelly Gordon: Seeing your daughter turned into some ... hood rat's lesbian s*x slave can be rather emotional.
Sara: Why did he come see you last week? Did you know what he was planning to do?
Kelly Gordon: I don't know. What did he do?
Brass: He kidnapped a friend of mine. A CSI. And then he blew himself up. Tried to take some cops with him.
Kelly Gordon: How many did he get?
Brass: Hey, we're all still here.
Sara:  Nick is still missing.
Kelly Gordon: Who's Nick?
Sara: The CSI is still missing. Do you know where he is?
Kelly Gordon: That's pretty funny -- you guys not being able to find something.
Brass: Yeah, look, if you cooperate, we can get your sentence reduced.
Kelly Gordon:  You know what I used to do before this? Back when I was alive? I used to grow things. Outside. I was studying horticulture. Flowers. My cellmate, Trish, gave me one for Valentine's Day. 
 
Kelly Gordon: Want to smell it?  I hope your friend dies.
 




 
 

Nick: It was Christmas in Las Vegas / when the locals take the town / Teresa hit a streak / and laid her waitress apron down / she was playing penny poker / over at the old Gold Spike / she tired of Texas hold 'em / so she switched to let it ride ... 


 

 

 
 

 
Greg:  Hey, I found a trigger wire. Maybe ... once we reassemble all the components, we'll be able to tell where the bomb came from. Maybe that ...
Warrick:  Maybe if we count up all the damn &quot;maybes,&quot; maybe Nick will be alive!
 
Warrick:  You know what I'm saying?!
 
Greg:  Was that necessary? Never mind my clothes. Look at the evidence.
 
Warrick: Damn.
 
 
Catherine: Sorry, Greg. I'll go talk to him.
 
Catherine: Hey, Warrick, hey. Hey, how you holding up?
Warrick: I'm not.
Catherine: I know.
Warrick: I just can't help thinking that could have been me in that box, you know? We flipped a coin for that trash run.
Catherine: Hey, Nick is not inside a box because of the flip of a coin.
Warrick: If that was me, I would have ...
 
Catherine:  Hey, you know what? I know you. I don't believe that. Okay?
Warrick:  No. You're wrong. I wouldn't have lasted this far. Catherine, if something happens to Nick, if we don't bring him back in one piece ...
 
Greg:  Hey, guys, come here. I found something.
 
Greg: Look at this.
 
Greg: There's something underneath there.
 
Warrick: Oh, got an edge right here. All right.
Greg: Another over here.
Catherine: Greg, get some crowbars.
 
 
Greg: Do you think Nick could be under here?
Warrick: I don't know, man. It would have to be at least six feet long.
 
Catherine: Yeah, but if he buried him lengthwise, and who's to say he didn't ... he could be.
 

 

 
 

Nick:  Hey!

 

 
Nick:  I'm in here!

Nick:  Hey!
 
Nick:  It was Christmas in Las Vegas / when the locals take the town ... Teresa hit a streak / and laid her waitress apron down ... 

 
Warrick: I hit something.
 

 
Nick:  She was playing penny poker / over at the old Gold Spike ... 

 


Nick: The air.

 
Catherine: It's Plexiglas.
 
Warrick: Nick!
Catherine: Nick?

 
Nick:  Hey, I'm right here!
 
 
 
Warrick: Nick! Hold on there, buddy!
 
Catherine: Nick?
 

 
Catherine: It's a dog.  It's a dog.
 

 
 
Nick:  Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
 
Nick: Oh, my God.



 
 
 

 

 
 

 
 
 
Nick: My name is Nick Stokes. If anybody finds this tape, turn it in to the Las Vegas ... PD. There should be a reward.


 

Nick: Mom ...  ... Cisco ... well, this is a lousy way to say good-bye, but it's all I've got.
 
Nick: I love you. You raised me right ... and I'm going to miss you.
 As for the rest of you guys, I know you did the best you could to find me.
 
Nick: Grissom ...


 
Grissom:  No, you never did, Nick.
 
 
Sara: He's going into convulsions.  He's losing it.
 
 
Sara: What's going on?
 
Grissom: What is -- ?
 
Grissom: Wait a minute.
 
 
Grissom: Ants.
 
Grissom: My God, he's being eaten alive.


 




 
 





 
 
Grissom:  As much.


 
Catherine: This has got to be a prototype. It was probably built to test how long he could keep somebody alive inside.
 
Hodges: Now, what are those?
Greg: I don't know.
Hodges: Hmm.
 
Warrick: All right, based on this battery and what's running off of it, and the fact that we kept the damn light on for as long as we did, I figure Nick's got another ninety minutes left, now.




 
Grissom:  Oh, come on, pal.
 
Grissom: Yeah. That's it.
 
Grissom: Come on. Little more.
 
Grissom:  Keep coming. Show me what you're made of. Come on, buddy.
 

 
Grissom: Gotcha!
 


 
 
Grissom: Solenopsis invicta.


 
Grissom:  They're fire ants, very rare in Nevada. They don't like our soil. The only places you find them around Vegas are in plant and tree nurseries.
 
Catherine: There's eleven nurseries in the greater Las Vegas area.
 
Archie Johnson: Okay, I've got the web cam trace down to here.
 
Greg: And the data from the black box in Walter Gordon's truck gave us a 23-mile travel radius.
 
Warrick: Okay, I've got two nurseries within the overlap area. Here and here.
 
Sara: Wait, wait. Wait, wait. Kelly Gordon, the daughter, worked with plants. Hold on. Hold on.
 
Sara: You guys, Nick is here.
 


 

 
 
 


 
Grissom: You said on the phone you had a fire ant mound. Where is it?
Nursery Owner: People usually prefer to stay away from it.
 
Grissom: All right, look. Fan out. Look for loose soil. Anything that might've been dug up recently.
 
Brass: That's the whole place.
 

Voice: Right down there. Let's go! Right now.

 
Catherine:  He-e-ey! I'm picking up the web cam transmitter.
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Catherine:  This is it! I found it! It's here.
 
Catherine:  I found it! This is it!
 
Catherine: Nick! Nick, we're here. Hang on!

Catherine:  Nicky!
 



 




 
 
Robbins:  It's a damn shame they didn't get to him sooner.
TOP VIEW DOWN
David Phillips: I sure will miss him.
 
Robbins: You know, David, I've seen fire ant bites in my time, but never anything like this.
 
David Phillips: Do you think he suffered?
Robbins: Do I think he suffered? Yes. Definitely.



Cue Sound:  HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER


 
Robbins: All right. On three.
David Phillips:  Uno ...

Robbins: Dos ...
Robbins &amp; David Phillips: Tres!


Lyric: It was Christmas in Las Vegas when the locals take the town ... 
 
Robbins: Would you care to do the &quot;y&quot; incision?
 
David Phillips: Well, &quot;Y&quot; not?


 
 

Robbins:  Mind your hands and feet.
 
 
 
 

 

Robbins:  Yes.
 
 

Robbins: He won't be needing this anymore.
 

 
Robbins:  Nice.

Robbins: Lung. 
 

 
Judge Bill Stokes:  So, Doctor. How did my son die? Anaphylactic shock?
Robbins: No, no, he didn't live long enough for that. COD was asphyxiation.
Judge Bill Stokes: Oh.
Robbins:  When the blood oxygen drops to less than 16% and the CO2 builds up, there's a rapid loss of consciousness. Death within minutes with no disfiguring physical findings.
Judge Bill Stokes: He'll look great at the funeral.
Robbins: Oh, yes.
Judge Bill Stokes: His mother will appreciate that.
Robbins: Good.
 


 
Robbins: Your son had a good heart.
Judge Bill Stokes: Hmm.



 

 


 

 
 

 
Nick:  Oh, my God. No, no, no, no.
 


 
Warrick: I hit something.
Catherine:  We got you, Nicky!
 


 

 
 

Warrick:  Hey!

Warrick:  Hey!
 
 
Warrick: We got you, man! Hey, Nicky!

Warrick: Nicky! Yeah. Hey, hold on there.
 
Warrick: Hey, put that down. Put that down.
 
Warrick: Put that down. We got you. We're gonna get you out of here. 
 
Warrick: Hang in there.  Oh, my God. We need that fire extinguisher! Give me that fire extinguisher.

 
Warrick:  These ants are getting at him, man.
 


 
Warrick: Oh.
Grissom: Short bursts, Greg. Don't suffocate him!
 
 
Warrick: Hang on, buddy. Hang on. Almost had him.
 
 
Sara: Get the paramedics!
Warrick:  Hang on. Hang on. We'll kill those ants, okay? You listen to me.
 
Warrick: Yeah.
 
Catherine:  Willows.


 
Hodges:  Yeah. Hey, boss ...
Catherine:  We found him. We're getting him out now.
Hodges:  That's great. Wai-wait. Don't-don't hang up. Just-just listen.
Catherine:  What? What?
Hodges:  Those dimples on the bottom of the prototype. GCMS found traces of semtex on each one.
Catherine:  You got to be kidding me.
 
Warrick: One, two, three.
 
Catherine:  Everyone out of the hole. That box is ready to explode!
Brass: Are you kidding?
Catherine: Get out of there now!
 
Warrick: I'm not leaving without Nick.
Catherine: There are charges under the box!
 
Warrick:  I'm not leaving here without him.

 
Grissom: Warrick, Catherine's right. Get out of the hole now.  I know what we're gonna do. Just trust me.

 
Nick: Help!
 
 
Grissom: We need 200 pounds of dirt over here right now, and we're gonna use that backhoe to get it.
 
 
 
Grissom: Nick!
 
Grissom: Can you hear me?
 
Grissom: It's gonna take us a minute to get you out of there, okay? Nick!
 
Grissom: Pancho!
 
Grissom: Listen to me.
 
Grissom: Put your hand on my hand.
 
Grissom: Good. Now listen. There may be explosives under the box. They're probably set on pressure switches.

 
Grissom: We need to equalize your body weight before we can pull you out, okay?
 
Grissom: Pancho, nod your head if you understand me.

 
Grissom: Okay, we're gonna use the dirt from the backhoe to equalize his weight.  I need a rope and a caribiner.
 
Voice: You got it.
 
Grissom: All right, Pancho, we're gonna open the lid and get you out, but I need you to stay lying down. Okay? Or else you'll blow us all up.  You understand that?
Nick:  Yeah, yeah.
Grissom: Do you promise?
 
Grissom: Pancho, say, &quot;I promise.&quot;
Nick:  I promise.
 
Catherine:  Bring it over. This way!
 
Grissom:  Don't move.
 
 
 
Warrick:  I got you. I got you. 
 
Warrick:  Lay still. Lay still. It's okay. It's okay.

Nick:  Okay, okay.
 
Grissom: All right, bring that over.
 
 
Grissom: Okay, Pancho, I want you to close your eyes and hold your breath.
 
Grissom:  Now!
 
 
Grissom: Ready? Go!
 
 

 

 
 
 
 
 
Grissom: I want my guys back.
 




 


 
 
Kelly Gordon: You the one?
Nick:  Yeah, back at you.
Kelly Gordon: What do you want me to say? I'm sorry?
Nick: No, you didn't do anything to me. And what your dad did, I ... I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much.
 
Nick: Hey, Kelly. Kelly.
 
Nick: Pick it up.
 
Nick: In a few years ... when you get out of here ... don't take it with you.
Kelly Gordon: That's it?
Nick: Yeah. Yeah, that's it.
 
Kelly Gordon: We're done.
 
Nick: That's it.
 
Nick:  That's it.

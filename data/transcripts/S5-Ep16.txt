<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[EXT. DESERT - DAY]</p>
<p>[EXT. RAINBOW CANYON -- WOODS - DAY]</p>
<p>(A fly flies into camera frame. The camera follows the fly.)</p>
<p>[FLY POV]</p>
<p>(The fly flies, then zooms down into the trees. It burrows into some flesh.)</p>
<p>(Resume POV. The camera pulls back out of the flesh and we hear the buzzing of flies and see dozens of beetles on the open chest wound of a dead body.)</p>
<p>(Camera pulls back and we see the face of the person has been completely blown off.) </p>
<p>[TIME LAPSE]</p>
<p>(Fast forward time through multiple nights and days. The flesh of the decomposing body melts away.)</p>
<p>(Wild animals stop at the body.)</p>
<p>(The flesh of the body rapidly melts away from the bone. Bugs and beetles feast on the flesh.) </p>
<p>[EXT. RAINBOW CANYON -- WOODS -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Close-up: Grissom picks up a single beetle off the decomposing flesh where the head of the victim used to be. He holds it up and looks at it.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hide beetle.</p>
<p>(FAR SHOT of Grissom and David Phillips kneeling next to the body. Multiple officers roam the area, possibly securing the scene.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This guy's been here at least two weeks.</p>
<p>(Grissom picks up a bullet from out of the decomposing flesh where the head of the victim used to be. He looks at it.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Number four buckshot, maybe?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Well, his pockets are empty. There's no wallet or any other kind of ID.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What'd be the point of blowing someone's face off if you're going to leave their driver's license?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Well, he's all yours.</p>
<p>(David Phillips stands up and leaves. Catherine crosses the crime scene tape on the way to the body. Brass is talking with someone on the side.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Hey, Cath.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to David) Hey. (to Grissom) Grissom. </p>
<p>(Grissom looks up. Catherine walks over to the body.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What's the deal? You're coming to my crime scenes before I get to them now?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Weren't you on a 4-19 in north town? </p>
<p>(Grissom stands up.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Guess you missed me.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm just documenting, then I'm leaving.</p>
<p>(He snaps a photo of the body. Catherine puts her kit down and gets a look at the body.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh. Ew.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Lot of animal activity.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, out here, I guess there's, uh, rodents, coyote, buzzards ...</p>
<p>(Grissom snaps more photos as Catherine kneels down next to the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: ... occasional mountain lion.</p>
<p>(She picks up the victim's hand and notices his ring.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What do we have here? A little ice?</p>
<p>(Brass kneels down next to Catherine and looks at the victim's ring.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The end of Rainbow Canyon. And this must be the pot of gold.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (reading) Las Vegas ... greenbacks?</p>
<p>(Brass reaches over and moves the ring with the tip of his pen to look at the writing on its side: AFFA 12) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: American Football Franchise Association. That league folded about twenty years ago.</p>
<p>(Catherine looks at the shotgun hole in the victim's chest.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Now, that's what I call a rat hole. (Grissom snaps a photo.)<br />
Shotgun wounds tend to be separate hits from individual pellets. But only if the shooter's far enough away from the target. This guy was shot at close range.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV: A shotgun is fired. The bullet exits the barrel. The pellet cluster hits the chest in a single large hole.)</p>
<p>(A man grunts.)</p>
<p>(The barrel of the rifle flares.)</p>
<p>(End of CGI POV. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Right between the numbers.</p>
<p>FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. RAINBOW CANYON -- WOODS -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Catherine is walking along the crime scene. Nick is standing at the edge near the trees. He's holding a camera and looking perplexed.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I don't get it. Grissom calls me up, I come out here, and I find you. Things were a hell of a lot simpler when we were all on the same shift.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You saying you don't like me as your boss?</p>
<p>(Catherine snaps a photo.) </p>
<p>(Nick doesn't know where this came from.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Whatever.</p>
<p>(He snaps a photo of something. Catherine glances back at him, then goes back to what she found.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I got a shot cup. (She holds it up and looks at it.) Doesn't make any sense, 'cause our vic was definitely shot point blank.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, a shot cup coming out of a shell is like throwing a potato chip. It doesn't really go that far.</p>
<p>(She looks at the shot cup.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (quietly) Yeah.</p>
<p>(She puts it down as she thinks about it.) </p>
<p>(Cut to: Nick removes a bullet out from the bark of a tree. He looks at it and puts it in a bindle.) </p>
<p>(He looks around.) </p>
<p>(Catherine snaps a photo of a mark on a rock.) </p>
<p>(Nick kneels down to pick something up from the ground.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Another casing. (He walks over to Catherine.) That's got to account for at least two more shots.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Typical pump-action. Holds four in the mag, one in the pipe.</p>
<p>(She picks up another shot cup.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: This was a chase.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: The victim runs through the woods in the night. The killer is behind him and fires. The victim runs. The bullet misses and ricochets off the tree. A second bullet is fired and it ricochets off the rock. The victim continues to run.) </p>
<p>(The victim falls. The killer stands over the victim, cocks the rifle and fires.)</p>
<p>(End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p>(Nick nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We know where it ended, so ... let's find where it began.</p>
<p>(Catherine and Nick look out across the area.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: There's not much out here to do for a couple of guys, other than hike or hunt.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And the vic wasn't dressed for either.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So they were up to no good. (Nick sees something in the distance.) Is that a trail over there?</p>
<p>(They wade through the water and head over to the trail.) </p>
<p>(Nick stops at the small dam and sees a hundred dollar bill with the twigs. He chuckles.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What you got?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: C-note in a Beaver Dam.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hang on.</p>
<p>(Catherine snaps a photo of it.) </p>
<p>(Nick cuts the twigs and takes out the bill. He looks at it.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Damn. This beaver's doing nice work.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: They should do a commercial for the city.</p>
<p>(Nick kneels down and looks inside the hole in the beaver dam. Camera pulls back and we see that there are more bills - lots of fifty dollar bills -- lining the inside of the hole.) </p>
<p>(Nick straightens.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Las Vegas -- where even the beaver can strike it rich.</p>
<p>(Catherine gives Nick a look.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. TANGIERS - HALLWAY/ROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(Det. Vartann is looking through his notes when Greg and Grissom walk up to him.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Please tell me I finally got a hooker roll.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Sorry. Maybe next time.</p>
<p>(They all step inside the hotel room. They stand around the bed where the dead body is.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Coroner was just here. Maurice Hudson, 37, lives in Tahoe.</p>
<p>(Grissom puts his kit down. Det. Vartann hands him the plastic bag with the victim's wallet and money.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: $14,000 in cash, and credit cards are accounted for.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: That much cash? Guy must have been a gambler.</p>
<p>(Grissom looks down at the table and sees a couple of 2005 W-2 forms.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Casino W-2's. Looks like we got a winner.</p>
<p>(He picks up a name tag.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Name tag printed at the Tangiers. Probably a convention.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: I'll check it out.</p>
<p>(Det. Vartann leaves.) </p>
<p>(Grissom walks up to the bed with the dead body on it. The man is on the right side of the bed. The left side of the bed has a huge sweat stain on it.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So tell me about the body.</p>
<p>(Greg leans forward and looks at the victim's right side.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, uh, livor mortis is settled, which means the body's been laying in this position for a while. Pronounced petechiae on the chest from lack of oxygen. Guy was struggling to breathe, pressure built up, and it popped the blood vessels.</p>
<p>(Grissom remains quiet. He looks at the body, noticing something else.) </p>
<p>(Grissom takes out a strand of something purple near the victim's mouth.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yeah, I saw that purple fiber. I was going to collect it. I just work on my own rhythm. (Greg takes the fiber and looks around.) I don't see anything purple in the room.</p>
<p>(Grissom looks around. He focuses in on the table against the far wall. Greg puts the envelope with the fiber in his pocket.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This table's cracked.</p>
<p>(Greg looks at Grissom. Grissom kneels down and finds something else on the table.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And we have what appears to be ejaculate.</p>
<p>(Greg looks around. He sees some stains on the bed sheets.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Me, too. This guy was a machine.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And he got around.</p>
<p>(Greg shrugs. Grissom stands up.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Have Sara process the sheets, and then pull the hotel surveillance.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Got you. We want to see who came ... and went.</p>
<p>(Grissom turns around and raises an eyebrow at Greg.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - LAB]</p>
<p>(The sheets are spread out on the table. Sara uses an ALS to examine the sheets.) </p>
<p>(She uses a marker to outline the impression on the sheets.) </p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[INT. CSI - A/V LAB] </p>
<p>(Greg reviews the security video.) </p>
<p>(Sara continues to examine the sheet, marking the body fluid stains with a marker.)</p>
<p>(Greg continues to review the video footage. He finds the video of the victim stepping into the elevator.) </p>
<p>(Sara cuts out the portion of the sheet with the body fluid stains on it. She puts the material in a container and caps it with a label for DNA.)</p>
<p>(Greg views video footage of the victim leaving the elevator.) </p>
<p>[INT. CSI - A/V LAB]</p>
<p>(Sara walks into the lab.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Any luck?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Hotel gave us copies of the surveillance tapes from the time Hudson checked in.</p>
<p>(Sara sits down next to Greg.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I'm all the way up to last night, and he's always solo.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Until Mia processes the sheet, there's no way to know whether the semen is the result of self-service only.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: No way. Soft p0rn couldn't crack that table.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Okay. If he had a partner, that would explain the unusually large sweat stain I found on the sheet.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: No cell phone. No calls out. Always alone. Who was he with?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY]</p>
<p>(Robbins goes over the body with Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Maurice Hudson is a perplexing subject. Check out his eyes.</p>
<p>(Robbins pulls apart the victim's eyelids to show Grissom the eyes.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Bulbar hemorrhages.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (nods and points) And petechial hemorrhages on the chest.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Asphyxiation.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Yep. Lividity, dark blue-purple, settled in the posterior area.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, that makes sense. We found him face-up.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Yeah? So then explain the additional blanching patterns on the chest and thighs.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Blanching happens when something's pressed against the area, displacing the blood.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Yeah, I know what you're thinking, but the body wasn't moved. And these two lividity patterns taken together are consistent with him being on his back.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So there was something on top of him?</p>
<p>(Robbins nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Compression asphyxia?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: It took at least two to three very long minutes to kill him. And whatever was on him remained there until livor set, about eight to ten hours.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, whatever it was was gone when we got there.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI -- LAB] </p>
<p>(The tech removes the money from the beaver hole relocated to the lab. Catherine instructs the techs) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I want two people in the room at all times, double counts, every pile. If you don't agree, do it all again.</p>
<p><strong>Tech</strong>: I know the drill, boss.</p>
<p>(Catherine turns and leaves the room. She walks down the hallway.) </p>
<p>[INT. CSI - HALLWAY - DAY -CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Catherine walks through the hallway when Warrick finds her.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey, Cath.</p>
<p>(She turns around when Warrick steps out of a lab.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I think I've got an ID off the victim's ring. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Let's hear it.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: The AFFA. It only lasted a few years, and only one player wore the number 12 for the Greenbacks. He was a wide receiver.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay, what's his name?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Gabe Miller. Fits the general description.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: All right, well, give it to Brass. We'll follow up.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY]</p>
<p>(Robbins goes over the body with Nick. Nick is wearing a face mask.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Minimal hemorrhage around the head wounds suggests the heart was destroyed first. Close-to-contact SGW caused extensive pulpification on the heart and bilateral hemothraces.</p>
<p>(Nick removes his face mask as he holds out the shot cup.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Yeah, and that was embedded in the back of his skull. Not uncommon for a close-range shot.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I think the guy used a sawed-off shotgun.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: How can you tell?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Check out the stria.</p>
<p>(Quick zoom to the markings on the shot cup.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Hmm? Yeah, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Impatience.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV: Someone saws off the barrel of a shotgun.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (V.O.) Sawing off the barrel of a shotgun is hard work.</p>
<p>(Cut to: The person breaks off the end of the barrel.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (V.O.) Those that do it are usually in a rush in to get it done. It leaves a burr on the edge of the barrel.</p>
<p>(The person cocks the rifle.)</p>
<p>(End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(Nick holds the shot cup.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So every time the weapon fired, the burr on the barrel raked the shot cup ...</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV: The gun fires. The shot cup explodes out of the barrel, scraping up against the burr as it exits.) </p>
<p>(End of CGI POV. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: ... before the pellets blasted holes into Mr. Gabe Miller, here.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: That's the vic's name?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, why? Is it that funny?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: It's the same name as our new councilman from ward seven. Interesting story. The guy played pro football ...</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, wide receiver for the Vegas Greenbacks, right?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, his team ring was on this guy's finger.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Yeah, then you mis-ID'd the vic. Gabe Miller's still alive. As much as a politician can be.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. - HALLWAY - DAY]</p>
<p>(Brass walks and talks with Gabe Miller down the hallway. He shows Gabe Miller a photo of the AFFA ring.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, this is your ring, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Gabe Miller</strong>: Yeah, that's my old number. Haven't seen that ring in a long time.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Why is that?</p>
<p><strong>Gabe Miller</strong>: Every cent I earned playing ball went up my nose or on some dog at Las Vegas Downs. I was a real mess until I accepted Jesus Christ as my personal savior. </p>
<p>(Brass makes a sound of disbelief. They stop walking.) </p>
<p><strong>Gabe Miller</strong>: Do you got a problem with that, Captain?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No. No, no. No, I ... no, I'm just listening.</p>
<p><strong>Gabe Miller</strong>: Well, there's no need to keep talking unless you're gonna speak your mind.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Okay, Councilman. Say you're an alcoholic. One day you decide to give up the bottle. And, more often than not, you're gonna trade in the shot glass for a dozen Krispy Kremes and start pounding them away with both hands. You know what I mean?</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So if I were to place a bet on Duke, they would have to win by more than 15 in order for me to win the bet.</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, here's why. (Warrick maps it out on a piece of paper for Catherine.) Our vic had Lou Barnes lay 17 points with Duke, and take 23 with Louisville. And the game ... landed 22. How do you think he did it?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: He got more than 17 and less than . He won both bets.</p>

<p><strong>Brenda Morgan</strong>: I didn't want to get involved. I still don't.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You were in his bed. I'd call that involved.</p>
<p><strong>Brenda Morgan</strong>: Look ... Maurice wasn't a nice guy, but I slept with him anyway. I could service him all night, and he wouldn't even ride the elevator with me.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I bet that hurt. Enough to kill him?</p>

<p><strong>Regina Owens</strong>: I went to his room around seven. Stayed just long enough to get mine and go.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [HOTEL ROOM] Regina laughs. She bumps into the table. She laughs.) </p>

<p><strong>Brenda Morgan</strong>: I'm fat, Ms. Sidle. I am a fat woman. I've tried diet after diet, joined gym after gym, done obesity programs, obsessed about drastic surgery, and I'm still fat. I didn't get my high school crush. I did his homework. Didn't get the one in college, either. He became my &quot;friend.&quot; But Maurice left a note in my slot on the message wall. And he made me feel special ... sexy ... wanted. </p>
<p>(She cries.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Did you know about the other woman?</p>
<p><strong>Brenda Morgan</strong>: When I went up to his room, she was leaving.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: And you slept with him anyway?</p>
<p><strong>Brenda Morgan</strong>: I thought about turning around, but it's not like I've had a lot of chances. It wasn't till afterwards ... that I started to feel ... angry. At myself. For letting him take advantage of me.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Did you argue with him? Was there a fight?</p>
<p><strong>Brenda Morgan</strong>: No. I waited for him to fall asleep. Then I smothered him with a pillow and held him down until he stopped moving.</p>

<p>(Warrick walks over toward Brass who waits in the middle of the road. Three officer cars line the road near an abandoned vehicle.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Across town on a homicide, you guys call me out here for an abandoned vehicle?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The car was reported stolen last week. The R.O. is Mitch Urbana. It's been picked clean.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You guys popped the trunk?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Waiting for you; pop it.</p>
<p>(The tech opens the trunk.) </p>
<p>(Inside the trunk is a small pile of metal shavings. Warrick touches it.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What do you got?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Feels like metal.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: Mitch Urbana saws off the barrel of a rifle. The metal shavings fall into the back of his car.)</p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Brass slides a photo of the car's trunk across the table toward Mitch Urbana.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The dust in your trunk is high carbon steel mixed with chrome - consistent with a shotgun barrel, like the weapon used to kill Kelvin Russell.</p>
<p>(Mitch puts his glasses on to look at the photos. He shakes his head and takes his glasses off.) </p>
<p><strong>Mitch Urbana</strong>: Look, uh, my car was stolen, and I reported it, okay? End of story. I don't know nothing about no shotgun. Maybe the punk who stole my car must have put it there.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You and Kelvin weren't on the best terms, eh?</p>
<p><strong>Mitch Urbana</strong>: (shrugs) Oddsmaking's a little art and a little science, you know? Russell was ... he was all mouth.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hey, he nailed the Duke game.</p>
<p><strong>Mitch Urbana</strong>: He got lucky. You know, there's about thirty games a day, and ... look, let me try to explain it to you, okay? Inside each game is a number. Once in a while, I'm, I'm a little off. But most of the time, I'm right. I work very hard to be right. I chisel through stacks of statistics, I sweep away all the irrelevancies. I try to get to the bottom -- you know, where the truth is. And yeah, I want to know what the quarterback had to eat that day, and if the point guard's going through a messy divorce. All these things, they come together, and all of a sudden, bang -- a number just jumps out at you. And within an hour, every sports book in Vegas got that number up on their board. My hard work displayed up there in lights. That's what I do.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Let me tell you what I think. Kelvin made you look bad. He made you look stupid. And for a guy who thinks highly of himself, who clearly needs to be right, where there's a tremendous amount of ego involved, that's motivation for murder.</p>
<p><strong>Mitch Urbana</strong>: Kelvin Russell didn't know what hard work was, okay? He was a loudmouth major pain in the ass. You think I killed him? </p>
<p>(Brass raises his eyebrows at him.) </p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He wasn't killed with a pillow. C.O.D. was compressed asphyxia.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: She admits guilt, but she's hiding something.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Maybe she's covering for someone else.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We know that Regina Owens was in the room. She claims she left the victim alive, and Brenda is backing her up.</p>

<p>(On the monitor, Brenda leaves the elevator while Regina steps into the elevator. The time stamp reads: 07:24.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The tape confirms Brenda's account. What time did she leave?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Spent the night. She didn't leave till the next morning.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Doc Robbins ball-parked the victim's death at sometime between 9:00 P.M. And midnight.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: That means she slept with a dead guy. She's not only a killer, she's a necrophiliac. That's what I call enjoying your work.</p>
<p>(Sara shakes her head.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hold on, hold on. Uh, back up the tape, please.</p>
<p>(Greg rewinds the tape.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: There. Stop.</p>
<p>(Time stamp is 07:23. On the monitor, Brenda puts her hand on the panel to steady herself.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: She's trashed. Maybe she passed out.</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Who do you like?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Uh, Charlotte. My mom grew up in North Carolina.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: All right, I'll give you Charlotte plus two.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What do I get if I win?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: How about a fabulous dinner?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (smiles) I'll take your action.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (smiles) All right.</p>
<p>(The game continues.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, unless we find our murder weapon, the case against Urbana is circumstantial at best.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: But he's involved. I feel it. Those sports betting types -- they'll lie to their own kids about a game that hasn't been played yet.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You were a sports betting guy.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, and I lied when I was.</p>
<p><strong>Announcer</strong>: Scott making his move. (The shooter shoots and misses the basket. Charlotte gets the ball.) No good! Charlotte looking for one last shot. (The buzzer blares.) He can't get it - buzzard! (The shooter shoots.) Final score: Hartford 89. Charlotte 88. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (groans) Oh!</p>
<p>(Warrick smiles.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: My team loses, but I still win that bet.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well ...</p>
<p>(Warrick's phone rings. He answers it.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (nods) Ah. (to phone) Brown. Really? Well, thank you. (He hangs up.) That was the manager of The Sports Book. Says a guy filed a lost ticket claim for the tickets that you found at the beaver dam.</p>

<strong>Bartender</strong>: 1992-1999<br />
<strong>Handyman</strong>: 2000-2004</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah. (reading) Professional boxer from '79 to '85. After that, he spent a lot of time in Vegas as a bouncer, bartender, handyman. Just another one of those broken down, punch-drunk bums.</p>
<p>(Warrick runs Cesar Dabo through Google and finds 15,800 matches. The first four main titles read:<br />

Archer vs. Dabo</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It says Dabo was a welterweight contender. A title match against Archie Archman was his biggest fight. Lost by a split decision.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh. So maybe Urbana hired his former boxing buddy to do his dirty work.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Dabo takes them out to Rainbow Canyon. Murders Russell, but Barnes gets away.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Dabo grabs most of the cash, goes back to Russell's body, takes the wallet, ID, takes off his face.</p>

<p><strong>Cesar Dabo</strong>: Yeah. I won that fight. Mitch was the only judge that got it right.</p>

<p><strong>Cesar Dabo</strong>: What, was I supposed to take the bus? My ride's been out all month.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: All right, how much you get paid for the hit?</p>
<p><strong>Cesar Dabo</strong>: It wasn't a hit. I did it on my own. I saw the money that runner was taking out of those books. Making Mitch look bad. He deserved it.</p>

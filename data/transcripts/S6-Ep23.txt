<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>[INT. LUCKY DRAGON - CASINO FLOOR -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Card tables. Slot machines. Coins jingling as they come out of the machines. A white ball on a roulette wheel. Another card flipped over - an Ace of Diamonds to go with the King of Clubs --- twenty-one. A new stack of chips is placed on the table.) Card tables. Chips in a holder. The casino is buzzing.)</p>
<p>(Camera rises up above the casino room. Officer Boatwright patrols the room.) </p>
<p><strong>Director of Surveillance</strong>: (from radio) Does anybody have eyes on our mystery guy?</p>
<p>(He walks and looks around the casino.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer Boatwright</strong>: (to radio) Unit one, negative. I'm on the main casino floor. I'm heading over to BJ pit three.</p>
<p><strong>Director of Surveillance</strong>: (from radio) Copy that, unit one.</p>
<p>(He continues walking through the casino and looking for someone.)</p>
<p>(CAMERA rises and focuses on the ceiling camera.)</p>
<p>[INT. THE LUCKY DRAGON - CASINO SURVEILLANCE ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Security personnel monitor the security cameras.)</p>
<p>[INT. THE LUCKY DRAGON - MAIN CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Officer Boatwright makes his way to the blackjack table. He hears an argument in progress.) </p>
<p><strong>Willie Cutler</strong>: Get out of my way.</p>
<p><strong>Voice 2</strong>: Make me get out of the way.</p>
<p><strong>Willie Cutler</strong>: Just get out of my way.</p>
<p><strong>Voice 2</strong>: What does this have to do -- ?</p>
<p>(Officer Boatwright sees two men pushing and shoving each other in the middle of the casino pit. Officer Boatwright runs over to break up the two men.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer Boatwright</strong>: Break it up! Break it up!</p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong>: You're the guy -- !</p>
<p>(Suddenly, one of the men grabs Officer Boatwright's gun and fires, shooting him in the stomach. Officer Boatwright goes down.) </p>
<p>[INT. THE LUCKY DRAGON - CASINO SURVEILLANCE ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(In the surveillance room, the Director of Surveillance sees the shots on the monitors. He talks into a microphone, relaying directions to casino security.) </p>
<p><strong>Director of Surveillance</strong>: (to radio) Shots fired. Main floor. BJ pit three.<br />
(hits switch) Dispatch, shooter is on the run.</p>
<p>[INT. THE LUCKY DRAGON - MAIN CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Officer Boatwright's on the floor, bleeding from the gunshot wound in his stomach.) </p>
<p><strong>Director of Surveillance</strong>: (from radio) All available security to BJ pit three.</p>
<p>[INT. THE LUCKY DRAGON - CASINO SURVEILLANCE ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p><strong>Director of Surveillance</strong>: (to radio) Boatwright's down. Get an ambulance. </p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong>: (o.s.) Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>Director of Surveillance</strong>: (to radio) Zoom in. Find the shooter. Find the shooter.</p>
<p>(In the surveillance room, surveillance uses the trackball to quickly shift cameras throughout the casino, looking for their shooter.) </p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong>: (o.s.) -- the eye in the sky.</p>
<p><strong>Director of Surveillance</strong>: (to radio) I got him. Shooter's headed for the slot carousel.</p>
<p>(On the monitor, they see the shooter running across the casino floor.) </p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong>: (o.s.) All right. Left to right.</p>
<p><strong>Director of Surveillance</strong>: (to radio) There he goes. He's headed for the guest elevators.</p>
<p>(They quickly shift cameras to keep an eye on the shooter.)</p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong>: (o.s.) Seven to eleven. Here we go.</p>
<p>(On the monitors, the shooter runs to the elevator just as the elevator doors open. He grabs the woman just stepping out and pulls her back into the elevator with him.) </p>
<p><strong>Director of Surveillance</strong>: (to radio) He's got a hostage.</p>
<p>(The elevator doors shut quickly.) </p>
<p><strong>Director of Surveillance</strong>: (to radio) Give me the whole tower. Three across the board.</p>
<p>(The camera monitors quickly shift to the camera inside the elevators and stop on ELEVATOR 2 on the shooter with the hostage.) </p>
<p>(One of the surveillance men grabs the phone and dials.) </p>
<p><strong>Director of Surveillance</strong>: (to radio) Get the police. We need SWAT. Now!</p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO: </p>
<p>[INT. THE LUCKY DRAGON - MAIN CASINO FLOOR - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Police officers file through the casino floor.) </p>
<p>(The officer in charge briefs Brass.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: We got the suspect holed up on three. Floors above and below evacuated.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Where's the negotiator?</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: En route. At least an hour away.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (sighs) Well, I'm here now.</p>
<p>(They enter the elevators.) </p>
<p>(The elevator doors close.) </p>
<p>[INT. THE LUCKY DRAGON - THIRD FLOOR - NIGHT]</p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong>: (o.s.) All right, let's clear the floor.</p>
<p>(Officers escort a man and a woman off the floor.) </p>
<p>(Brass waits on the side as the officers clear the rooms nearby.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Clear. </p>
<p><strong>Officer 2</strong>: (o.s.) Clear.</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Clear.</p>
<p><strong>Officer 2</strong>: (o.s.) Clear.</p>
<p>(The officer knocks on the room door.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Las Vegas Police. Open the door.</p>
<p>(Brass steps forward.)</p>
<p>(The officer slides the room key through the lock and he opens the door.)</p>
<p>(A gunshot fires at the door.)</p>
<p>(Everyone pulls their guns out and pauses.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (dryly) Well, I guess this is the place.</p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO: </p>
<p>[EXT. CUTLER RESIDENCE - FRONT - NIGHT]</p>
<p>LEGEND:<br />
15 HOURS EARLIER</p>
<p>(Lower middle class neighborhood on a quiet street. Officer cars are parked along the street, their lights flashing.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (V.O.) Just another domestic violence case. I wish I had a nickel -- </p>
<p>[INT. CUTLER RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - LATER]</p>
<p>(Dr. Robbins, in booties, stands over Janice Cutler, dead on the living room floor in a short robe with a nightgown underneath. Her head rests in a large pool of blood-soaked carpet. Brass, Grissom and Warrick enter the room.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Janice Cutler. Shot in the mouth.</p>
<p>(David Phillips pulls her jaw down.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Single boy's the only smart one.</p>
<p>(Warrick snaps photos of the scene.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Judy and I deal with our marital problems a little differently -- counseling, separate vacations once a year. </p>
<p>(Warrick snaps a photo of the bullet casing on the carpet.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: She's never pulled a gun on me yet.</p>
<p>(Warrick picks up the casing and looks at it.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I got a shell casing. Nine millimeter.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: That accounts for the high-velocity spatter.</p>
<p>(Grissom notes the blood-spattered wedding photo on the counter.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Where's the husband?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, there was no car in the garage. We can broadcast out for him.</p>
<p>(Grissom looks around the room.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: There's no other signs of disturbance in here. What about the rest of the house?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Nothing obvious.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How many domestics have you seen where someone got shot in the face and nothing else was disturbed?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What are you thinking?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That you married people take things too personally.</p>
<p>(Warrick raises his camera and snaps a photo of Janice Cutler.) </p>
<p>SMASH CUT TO: END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Robbins and Grissom stand around Janice Cutler's body on the autopsy table.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: She's only been dead a few hours. Signs of s*x prior to death. No vaginal trauma to suggest it wasn't amicable.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Assuming the husband had s*x with her and then murdered her, he went from amorous to murderous in near record time.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Well, maybe you were right. It wasn't the husband. But no semen, so I'd only be speculating.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What about the bullet?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Single gunshot wound. Based on powder burns and stipling, ... </p>
<p>(He opens her jaw.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: ... muzzle was placed inside the mouth ...</p>
<p>(Camera zooms into the mouth and pauses on the tongue. Then angles upward to the roof of the mouth. A gunshot is fired, then flash to a view of the woman's head just behind her ear.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Bullet then fragmented in her head.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Explains why Warrick couldn't find it at the scene.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Yeah, shooter wanted to make sure he didn't miss.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This was somebody who was emotionally close to her.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Gil ... have you ever even been close to getting married?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Once. When I was younger. Her name was Nicole Daley. I asked her to marry me. We were classmates. She liked bugs, too. I gave her my grandmother's ring, but my mother made me get it back. </p>
<p>(Robbins nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Second grade.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CUTLER RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Sara is looking at the blood-spattered wedding photo on the counter.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (to Warrick) Was it the happiest day of your life?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Me and Tina? Happened so fast. Time will tell. Why don't you take a look at this phone here and tell me what you think.</p>
<p>(Warrick shows Sara the phone with blood on the #1.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Blood on the keypad, away from the spatter.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: A neighbor called it in. If someone was in the house, they'd have dialed 9-1-1.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Dispatch never got a call. Maybe the husband started to dial ... changed his mind and took off.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Maybe. I just wish it was a print and not a smudge.</p>
<p>(Sara looks around.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Okay. Bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: All right.</p>
<p>(Sara starts backing away and heading toward the bedroom. Warrick raises the camera and snaps a photo of the phone keypad.) </p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO: </p>
<p>[INT. CUTLER RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - DAY -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(Sara enters the bedroom and looks around.) </p>
<p>(She looks at the windows.) </p>
<p>(She snaps photos of the bedsheets. She peels away the covers and snaps more photos.) </p>
<p>(She steps into the closet and looks around. She kneels down on the floor and notices the grass clippings on the floor.)</p>
<p>(She picks up the nearest pair of shoes and looks at them. They're both clean and clear of any signs of grass or dirt.) </p>
<p>(From her position on the floor, Sara notices a sock sticking out from under the bed.) </p>
<p>(She picks it up and bags the sock.) </p>
<p>(Warrick enters the bedroom.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey. I found these in his jacket.</p>
<p>(He shows her some brochures for THE GIRLS.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Looks like the husband was planning a little vacation. A little recreation on the side.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (re: sock) I found this under the bed. And grass -- not the kind you smoke -- on the floor and in the closet, but all the shoes in the closet were clean.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So someone was walking around here with grass on their shoes?</p>
<p>(Sara nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Maybe it was the missing husband, or a desperate gardener.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Who was mowing more than the lawn?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Brass and Sara walk through the hallway on their way to the interview room.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Good call on the grass stains. Police officers brought in your guy. He was mowing a lawn down the street.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, he must be a great gardener, because Mrs. Cutler was paying him way too much.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well ... (chuckles) Wait till you see him.</p>
<p>(Brass opens the door and they enter the interview room.) </p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Timothy Johnson sits at the table.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Mr. Johnson? It's Timmy, right? (Timmy nods.) This is Sara Sidle from the Crime Lab.</p>
<p>(Brass and Sara both sit down at the table opposite Timmy.) </p>
<p><strong>Timothy Johnson</strong>: (worried) I didn't kill Mrs. Cutler, if that's what you're thinking.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: How well do you know her?</p>
<p><strong>Timothy Johnson</strong>: We live across the street from the Cutlers.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We?</p>
<p><strong>Timothy Johnson</strong>: My family. Mother, father, and brothers.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So you still live at home?</p>
<p><strong>Timothy Johnson</strong>: Until I graduate next month.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So mowing lawns is just your sideline?</p>
<p><strong>Timothy Johnson</strong>: I don't play sports. Helps with the tuition.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Did Mr. or Mrs. Cutler ever invite you in their house?</p>
<p><strong>Timothy Johnson</strong>: On a cold day, yeah. Sometimes she'd make me coffee.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: But she writes you a check every month, like yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>Timothy Johnson</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Did she hand you the check in her closet? </p>
<p>(She shows him the photo of the grass-stained sock he left behind.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Or in her bedroom? You forgot your sock.</p>
<p><strong>Timothy Johnson</strong>: Okay. Yeah, I was there. I was hitting the wife.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You had s*x with her?</p>
<p><strong>Timothy Johnson</strong>: Yeah. But it wasn't my idea, all right? She was ... she was really unhappy in her marriage. Me and Mrs. Cutler were in the middle of it when ... when Mr. Cutler came home early.</p>
<p>FLASHBACK TO: </p>
<p>[INT. CUTLER HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK)]</p>
<p>(Janice Cutler and Timothy Johnson are in bed when they hear the front door open. She gets out of bed.) </p>
<p><strong>Janice Cutler</strong>: He was supposed to be at work all night. Hide!</p>
<p>(Janice Cutler ties her robe and exits the bedroom. Timothy jumps out of bed and quickly fumbles for his clothes.)</p>
<p><strong>Timothy Johnson</strong>: (V.O.) I guess that's when I lost my sock.</p>
<p>(He looks around, then quickly hides in the closet, shutting the door behind him.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INSIDE THE CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER]</p>
<p>(Timothy is dressed as Willie Cutler opens the door. He grabs Timothy and slams him back against the wall.) </p>
<p><strong>Willie Cutler</strong>: How was she, you little son of a bitch? Now get out of here.</p>
<p>(He pushes him out.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Back to scene.) </p>
<p><strong>Timothy Johnson</strong>: Mr. Cutler was ... was so pissed, I ... I barely even recognized him.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You hear a gunshot?</p>
<p><strong>Timothy Johnson</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So Mrs. Cutler was still alive when you left the house?</p>
<p><strong>Timothy Johnson</strong>: I don't know. I think so. I didn't see anything else.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - LAYOUT ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Warrick sprays the hooker flyer and hangs it inside the super glue fuming tank. He ignites the super glue and closes the lid.) </p>
<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO: </p>
<p>(A large print appears on the photo for &quot;SALLY&quot;. He flips the flyer over and finds four prints on the back.)</p>
<p>(Nick walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So, I hear your marriage is on the rocks, and you're shopping for hookers?</p>
<p>(Warrick laughs.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No, but I think I found one that Mr. Cutler likes. (He points to SALLY.) Thumb print on the front. Four fingerprints on the back.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: &quot;Sally. Sweet apple pie.&quot; Hmm. Do you really think it's a good idea to sleep with a girl who advertises in a flyer?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, I don't really think there's any sleeping involved.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Don't be shy, though. Give her a call.</p>
<p>(Nick looks at Warrick. Really? Warrick smiles. Nick's game.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: All right, for your enjoyment.</p>
<p>(Nick picks up the speaker phone and dials the number, (702) 555-0190. A ring or two later, someone answers.)</p>
<p><strong>Sally</strong>: (from phone) This is Sally. Who's this?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (to phone) Hi. This is, uh ... Dirk ... Diggler. I'm looking for a date.</p>
<p><strong>Sally</strong>: (from phone) What kind of date?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (to phone) I'm taking a trip around the world. Want to go?</p>
<p><strong>Sally</strong>: (from phone) Yeah, I'll come with you. You sure you can afford the airfare, darlin'?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (to phone) Is two g's enough?</p>
<p><strong>Sally</strong>: (from phone) Where you at?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (to phone) 3057 Westfall. It's right off of Charleston. </p>
<p>(Warrick points. Here? Nick motions him to be quiet.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (to phone) It's a single level building, all the way in the back.</p>
<p><strong>Sally</strong>: (from phone) What do you look like?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (to phone) Um ... I have a little Tom Cruise thing going.</p>
<p><strong>Sally</strong>: (from phone) All right, half an hour, and I'll be there.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (to phone) All right.</p>
<p>(Nick hangs up. Warrick groans.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, right.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (pleasantly amused) Ah, sweet apple pie! The Cruiser.</p>
<p>(Nick leaves the lab.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS SKYLINE - DAY (STOCK)]</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Nick and an officer escort SALLY down the hall to an interview room.) </p>

<p><strong>Sally</strong>: Do you got a present for me, baby?</p>
<p>(Willie takes out a wad of cash from his pants pocket and hands it to her.) </p>
<p><strong>Sally</strong>: (V.O.) He must have won some big jackpot or something -- I can tell when money's new. He pulled this big wad out of his Wal-Mart pants. </p>

<p>(He rips the gauze bandage off the wound. Willie Cutler groans. Dr. Franks looks at the wound.) </p>
<p><strong>Dr. Franks</strong>: Irregular laceration, subcutaneous tissue only. A few millimeters deeper, it would have nicked the intercostal artery.</p>
<p><strong>Willie Cutler</strong>: That sounds bad.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Franks</strong>: Yeah. Would've been a real mess. You're a lucky man. Flush out the wound, dress it with 4 x 4 gauze, start an IV, hang cefazolin and get some blood work done. Oh, and get him a tetanus shot.</p>
<p>(And with that, Dr. Franks leaves the room. Sara steps forward with the camera.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Ah, the warm fuzzy feeling of modern medicine.</p>
<p><strong>Willie Cutler</strong>: Can I get something to wear?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Uh, yes, in a few minutes. I need to document your wound. Do you think you could lift your arms for me like this?</p>
<p>(He lifts his arms.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Thank you. That's perfect.</p>
<p>(Sara snaps a photo of the wound.) </p>
<p><strong>Vartann</strong>: Why don't you tell us what happened.</p>
<p><strong>Willie Cutler</strong>: Um. Not much to tell, really. Uh ... Cowboy Dan had the office working round the clock for the last week. We were putting together a campaign for a new tour. I just got back from breakfast.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [INT. NEON CITY EXCURSIONS (COWBOY DAN'S) - HALLWAY --<br />

<p>(He stands up. There's multiple gunshots coming from the next room. People groan.) </p>
<p>(Suddenly, he staggers backward, shot on the side. He looks around and ducks under the desk.) </p>

<p>(Willie Cutler hides under the desk. The door closes.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Back to scene.) </p>
<p><strong>Willie Cutler</strong>: I was so scared, I couldn't move. So I just played dead.</p>
<p>(Sara hands him a blanket. He covers himself.) </p>
<p><strong>Willie Cutler</strong>: Ow. I don't even know how long I was there. And then you guys came in and found me.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Do you think that you could indicate on this diagram where you were standing when you were shot?</p>
<p>(She shows him an office layout. He points to the office area between the desk and the door.) </p>
<p><strong>Willie Cutler</strong>: Um ... I guess I was standing somewhere around here.</p>
<p>(Sara marks it with an 'X'.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Willie Cutler</strong>: Look, I need to call my wife. I should have been home by now, and she's probably worried.</p>
<p><strong>Vartann</strong>: Um .... Mr. Cutler, when was the last time you were home?</p>
<p><strong>Willie Cutler</strong>: Um ... I guess it was, uh ... probably yesterday morning. Why?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Mr. Cutler. I am very sorry, but ... your wife is dead. She was found shot last night in your home.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So they're all accounted for.</p>
<p>(Greg nods.) </p>
<p>(Catherine walks over to the closed door with the pink rod sticking out of the bullet hole.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So Willie Cutler must have been standing along this line when he was grazed by the bullet.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It's consistent with his statement.</p>
<p>(Catherine opens the office door and looks inside as Greg snaps photos of Roger Banks' desk. He snaps a photo of the phone.) </p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, the way I see it, somebody's out to kill you and a lot of innocent people are getting in the way.</p>
<p><strong>Willie Cutler</strong>: Yeah. That's got to be it.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah. Who'd want to kill you?</p>
<p><strong>Willie Cutler</strong>: I don't know. Maybe it's just some nutcase. A guy sees me on the street, and I remind him of somebody he hates.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, that's ... that's a pretty good theory. Want to hear another one?</p>
<p><strong>Willie Cutler</strong>: Sure.</p>

<p><strong>Willie Cutler</strong>: Hmm? Timmy? </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Timmy. What, you didn't know?</p>
<p><strong>Willie Cutler</strong>: No.</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Willie Cutler</strong>: I was getting a promotion at work. At least I thought I was. So I threw myself a little celebration.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I guess that makes you a premature celebrator. Tell me about that work-promotion thing. Why were you passed up?</p>
<p><strong>Willie Cutler</strong>: Cowboy Dan just couldn't bring himself to promote a felon.</p>

<p><strong>Tina</strong>: Warrick ...</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Man, and I didn't even have to call that show 'Cheaters.' </p>
<p><strong>Tina</strong>: You think you know what you're talking about? </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Don't even bother coming home tonight. I'll just text you the storage space your stuff'll be in.</p>
<p><strong>Tina</strong>: You want to know what's up, huh? What's really up? </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I can see what's up. </p>

<p><strong>Wendy Simms</strong>: Well, hey. What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Serology.</p>
<p><strong>Wendy Simms</strong>: Serology? Now, I read about that in my history of forensic science classes. So, what exactly is it you're trying to do?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Lattes crust method for determining blood type.</p>
<p><strong>Wendy Simms</strong>: You know, for you, I clear the decks. I mean, I can just rush your samples through DNA.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I need it faster than DNA. And I don't need a full profile anyway, just ABO type.</p>
<p><strong>Wendy Simms</strong>: You mind if I stick around and watch?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Don't you have something better to do?</p>
<p><strong>Wendy Simms</strong>: Yeah, I do, but some guy's using my lab.</p>
<p>(Grissom puts drops of liquid on the materials.) </p>
<p><strong>Wendy Simms</strong>: Okay, now as I recall, the reagents have to be fresh. Right? So, where did you get those?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I keep some in my fridge for emergencies.</p>
<p><strong>Wendy Simms</strong>: You got anything else in there? Bottle of tequila, perhaps? Severed head?</p>

<p>(Brass is sitting behind his desk.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Willie got loose. He slipped our surveillance. What's up?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We found high velocity spatter consistent with the wife on his shirt. He was in the room when she was shot. He could have been holding the gun. Maybe they were working together.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: That would explain what Sammy was doing at The Lucky Dragon. Willie lost a lot of money there. So either he did it, or he's covering for his brother.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah. Maybe he's got unfinished business there.</p>

<p>(It's a full-on scuffle.)</p>
<p>(Officer Boatwright rushes over to break it up.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer Boatwright</strong>: Hey, break it up, break it up!</p>
<p>(Willie grabs Officer Boatwright's gun and pulls away, giving him enough room for Officer Boatwright to get a look at him.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer Boatwright</strong>: Hey, aren't you ... ?</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Look through the peephole.</p>
<p><strong>Willie Cutler</strong>: Why do you want to come in here?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Just to talk to you, Willie. I mean, you're a smart guy, I think maybe you and I, we can figure a way out of this. Come on, check me out. Okay, look, I'm going to put the phone down now, so you can see me, okay?</p>

<p>(Brass closes the door.) </p>

<p><strong>Willie Cutler</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: He's in the holding room, which is in the basement of the casino.</p>
<p><strong>Willie Cutler</strong>: He was just trying to help me.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Look, I'm just trying to help you too, Willie. So, point the gun at me, not at her, and let this nice young woman go, come on.</p>
<p><strong>Willie Cutler</strong>: No way.</p>
<p>(He points the gun at Jackie.) </p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yes, I'm with him, and he'd like to speak with his brother.</p>

&quot;passed over.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So now you're five large in the hole, hmm?</p>
<p><strong>Willie Cutler</strong>: Well, way I saw it, I was fifteen in the hole. So I went to a cash machine and I wired myself 50-K. Every cent I own. For a second I was up, I was killing 'em. They were serving me cocktails, and calling me &quot;sir.&quot;<br />
And then the pit boss got involved and I hit a bad streak. So I called Sammy.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So the pit boss gives Willie the heave-ho, with chips still on the table.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, that's about a $10,000 marker. Casino owed him money; that's why Willie went back.</p>

<p><strong>Willie Cutler</strong>: I tried to find him myself. I figured I could get him to Mexico or something. I drove around for hours. Nothing. So I went back to my office, and that's when I saw Cowboy Dan and Roger. And I knew what Sammy meant when he said he was going to take care of me. He was going to give me a clean slate. He was going to kill everyone that wronged me.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: But she hasn't wronged you. Jackie hasn't done anything to hurt you. So why would you want to hurt her? Let's cut her loose.</p>
<p><strong>Willie Cutler</strong>: I don't want to hurt anybody.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: That's right, Willie. You don't want to hurt anybody. You kill somebody, even by accident, you can never take it back. People never look at you the same again. And you know what? You can't look at yourself the same way again, either.</p>

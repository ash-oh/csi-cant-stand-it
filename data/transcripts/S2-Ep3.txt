<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS (STOCK) - CONSTRUCTION OVERHEAD -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The site is active. Construction workers are busy. The camera starts about floor three then pans downward through the second floor and down to the first floor where a white truck with a worker wearing a white hard hat arrives on the premises. It stops by a man in a green hard hat, the supervisor.)</p>
<p><strong>Construction Supervisor</strong>: You're late</p>
<p><strong>Construction Worker (in truck)</strong>: Thursday night. Traffic on the strip.</p>
<p><strong>Construction Supervisor</strong>: Yeah. Every night. Traffic on the Strip. We're on a deadline, let's go.</p>
<p>(A yellow hard hat his the truck's windshield, cracking it. The CONSTRUCTION SUPERVISOR looks up. Following the hard hat is a body free falling the same path. Upon impact ... )</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CLOSE UP of the man on the ground in a pool of blood. GRISSOM walks up to the body and looks straight up.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Man versus Gravity. </p>
<p>(He looks down at the body and shakes his head.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Man lost.</p>
<p><strong>Robert Harris</strong>: I think that was his point.</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: Hello, Bob.</p>
<p><strong>Robert Harris</strong>: Hello, Brian.</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: Grissom, what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: I didn't use the word &quot;homicide.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Dispatch called. The body's on county property.</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: We're not looking at a crime here. Bob explained it to me on the phone. His guy was alone up there. He jumped. It was suicide.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Then why are you here, Sheriff?</p>
<p><strong>Robert Harris</strong>: Look. Roger Valenti was an unhappy guy. Money problems. Family problems. He took the easy way out.</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: It's a tragedy, but it's not a crime.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Suicide, huh? I don't know, Brian. On the day you decide to end your life, why would you go to work?</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
[INT. CONSTRUCTION SITE -ELEVATOR - NIGHT]</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: Fourteen hundred new beds means 1,400 criminals off the street. That old jail's maxed. Prisoner population's increased by ten percent in one year. If this place isn't built soon, you do the math </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You look like the Sheriff, but you talk like the Mayor. Mr. Harris, you get an extra bonus for early completion? </p>
<p><strong>Robert Harris</strong>: Twenty grand a day. I'm ten days ahead. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Wow, $200,000. You must work your guys pretty hard, huh?</p>
<p>(The elevator stops and everyone gets off.)</p>
<p>[INT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - 12TH FLOOR - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Where exactly was Valenti's work station?</p>
<p><strong>Robert Harris</strong>: He had the whole floor to himself. Valenti was usually my first guy up. He would drill the holes for the safety cables. No one walks a new slab until the cables are looped around the perimeter.</p>
<p>(Quick Flashback showing Valenti drilling in the holes for the cables. Flash to white. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Terminal velocity's 9.8 meters per second, squared. He would've hit the ground at under five seconds.</p>
<p>(A Siren wails in the background.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM, wearing a white visitor's hard hat, walks to the edge of the floor. He puts his kit down and kneels on the ground to look over the edge.)</p>
<p>(FLASH POV: As he peers over the edge, the figure of VALENTI'S body falls past him and straight down to the impact point on the ground beneath them. End of Flash. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks around and notices the drill hanging off the side of the floor. He pulls it up.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did this belong to Mr. Valenti</p>
<p><strong>Robert Harris</strong>: Well, like I said he was the only one up here.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM examines the drill and notices that the metal housing is charred.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This drill is shorted out. Do you think he &quot;jumped&quot; before or after he got the shock of his life?</p>
<p><strong>Robert Harris</strong>: GFCI would have prevented shock.</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: What is GFCI? </p>
<p><strong>Robert Harris</strong>: The Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Big words meaning you won't get electrocuted.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM grabs his kit and notices the outlet. He moves to examine the plug and notices that the third prong of the plug is cut in half.)</p>
<p><strong>Robert Harris</strong>: You see, if there's and electrical imbalance the GFCI trips the circuit and the tools are suppose to shut itself off.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: But if the third prong of the plug is compromised, the interrupter won't work. Will it, Bob? </p>
<p><strong>Robert Harris</strong>: The third prong grounds the drill. Without it, the interrupter's useless.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: These prongs don't usually snap off by themselves.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks around and sees a pair of metal cutters on the floor nearby.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Are all your workers this careless with their tools?</p>
<p>(He reaches into his CSI kit and pulls out pexi-glass, portable evidence box and begins to set up a chamber to super-glue the prints into the handle of the tool.)</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: You mind telling me what you're doing?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: These cutters may have been used to tamper with the grounding prong.</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: What happened to good old-fashioned dusting for prints?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: When your crime scene is twelve stories up ... I don't want to take any chances. I'm going to lock in these prints.</p>
<p>(The gas heats up and fills the containers. Fingerprints appear on the tool's handle.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. DR. LEIGH SAPIEN'S RESIDENCE - DAY]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and NICK walk up to the house. They're met by DETECTIVE O'RILEY.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, O'Riley, we got the 419.</p>
<p><strong>O'Riley</strong>: Dylan Buckley-- 14 years old.</p>
<p>(They enter the house where the boy's body is on the floor.)</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. O'Riley</strong>: Paramedics pronounced. Coroner's on his way.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Was he home alone?</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. O'Riley</strong>: Not alone. And not his home. (From behind him, a woman dressed in white approaches.) Catherine Willows, Nick Stokes, crime lab. Dr. Leigh Sapien. This is her residence.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, good. Then you can fill us in.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Leigh Sapien</strong>: We were in the middle of a session.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You're a Therapist.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Leigh Sapien</strong>: Psychiatrist.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And why were you seeing Dylan?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Leigh Sapien</strong>: Doctor-Patient privilege.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Privilege doesn't extend post-mortem.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We can always get a warrant to get your records.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Leigh Sapien</strong>: No need. Dylan suffered from Reactive Attachment Disorder. He was with his mother and I've been treating him for sixteen months.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Ten o'clock at night. You use your home?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Leigh Sapien</strong>: I see my patients whenever they need me. On weekends, at night. At the office or here ...</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (interrupting) Why don't you ... just tell us what happened.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Leigh Sapien</strong>: Dylan had an argument with his mother. He needed to unload. </p>
<p>(Quick Flashback during v.o. showing DYLAN BUCKLEY sitting on the couch across from DR. LEIGH SAPIEN talking to her. White Flash to DYLAN BUCKLEY convulsing on the couch and falling to the floor. DR. LEIGH SAPIEN trying to hold his head still. DYLAN BUCKLEY hitting his head multiple times on the floor while seizing.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Leigh Sapien</strong>: He was complaining about his curfew blaming his mother for problems at school. Suddenly, he began to convulse. I tried to stabilize his head. I thought it was grand mal seizure. Dylan was an epileptic. He hit his head. And when the convulsions stopped he was dead.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Did you try to revive him.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Leigh Sapien</strong>: Of course, standard CPR. Cleared his airway, worked his chest.</p>
<p>(NICK sees something on DR. LEIGH SAPIEN'S white sweater.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I take it this wasn't his first convulsion.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Leigh Sapien</strong>: He was diagnosed with epilepsy at age 3.</p>
<p>(NICK slowly approaches DR. LEIGH SAPIEN in a manner that startles her.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Leigh Sapien</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Catherine, we need to get a tape-lift here, please.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE conducts the tape-lift and NICK moves behind DR. SAPIEN looking for anything else they may need.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Leigh Sapien</strong>: Look, I dialed 9-1-1. I'm not hiding anything.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I can see that.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI -- FORENSIC AUTOPSY BAY]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM enters the morgue. ROBBINS is there to brief him over the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Quick. Name three human bones that can stand a twelve story drop.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Bones of the inner ear: Malleus, Incus, Stapes. High cellular density, completely protected by the skull. Why?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: They appear to be the only bones not fractured or broken.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I want to see the entry and exit wounds.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Gil, he wasn't shot. This is the guy that fell of the new jailhouse. Are we talking about the same case here?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He fell after he was electrocuted.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: News to me. I didn't find any physical evidence of electrocution.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Faulty drill. There should be burn marks on one of his palms.</p>
<p>(Flash CGI POV of the current deceased's right hand (without burn marks) morphing to a hand with burn marks as an electric sizzle moves from the palm up the deceased's arm. The electric sizzle moves back down the deceased's arm toward the palm leaving the current unmarked skin behind. End of Flash.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Negative on the burn marks. In most electrocution cases, capillaries rupture, hemoglobin leaks into the perivascular tissue.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Right. creating a fern-like pattern on the chest.</p>
<p>(Flash CGI POV of the current deceased's unmarked chest. An electric sizzle moves from the deceased's lower right side up and across the chest leaving the pattern behind. The electric sizzle moves back down the deceased's chest leaving the current unmarked skin behind. Flash to white and back to the present.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: His body contradicts your crime scene.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I don't care what the body says, this guy was electrocuted. It was not an accident.</p>
<p>FLASH TO WHITE:</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI -- TRACE LAB]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM is working on the drill, trying to get the outside casing off so that he can look at its insides. On the same table some distance away, SARA is staring at the pair of boots from the deceased. She stares at them some more. She looks up. She sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I don't know what I'm looking for.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Signs of charring or melting. You've done this before.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah. But we always go back to the body. The body tells a story and in this case, the body says there was no crime and you're not listening. Why?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Every now and then, we have to break the rules. Start with a conclusion and work our way backwards.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Like, for instance, when we don't agree with the coroner's report?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Like, for instance ... in the 1800s, when surgery was Russian roulette and patients were dying on the tables.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Germs.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Until Louis Pasteur theorized that something we could not see, microscopic organisms were attacking the patients.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Relevance ...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Bodies tell a story because we interpret them the way our predecessors taught us to. Just because we don't see something we're supposed to see doesn't mean that it's not there.</p>
<p>(SARA goes back to work on the boots. GRISSOM gets the drill open and starts digging through it. He immediately notices that someone crossed the hot wire with the neutral wire.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Wires were crossed. (This gets SARA's attention.) Polarity's been reversed. This confirms that someone tampered with Valenti's drill.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The rubber soles of his boots should have protected him from the electrical shock. That is why you're safe when you're in a car during a lightening storm. You're insulated by the rubber tires.</p>
<p>(SARA picks up the boots and holds it up. From GRISSOM'S POV, he can see the bottom of the shoes. He also sees something else on the bottom of the right boot.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Rubber's an insulator, but metal's a conductor. What form of metal hides in plain view at a construction site?</p>
<p>(Flash POV close up to the nail in the bottom of the boot.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: A nail.</p>
<p>(SARA and GRISSOM smile at the find.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - PRINT LAB]</p>
<p>(CLOSE UP of computer screen as the palm print on the left is compared to the palm print on the right. SARA enters the lab. WARRICK is seated at the computer. He's running the print through the database.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: How's that palm print Grissom got off those cutters?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Good. I'm running it through AFIS right now. The good thing is that the jailhouse is a union gig and all the union guys are already in the database. What I did for the print was I lined up a ridge detail from the partial that I found on each handle.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p>(WARRICK sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So ... you think that guy fried before he fell?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I don't know. We found a nail in his boot. It could have pierced the protective rubber. It might have allowed electricity to course through his body.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Bobby Dawson's taking odds. Two to one, Grissom's wrong. Five to one, he gets suspended for shutting down that jailhouse. And ten to one ... </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Fired?</p>
<p>(Computer beeps. WARRICK manually lines up the two palm prints. The computer screen reads: </p>
<p>&quot;FILE HR_145406 AT6501(?)&quot; in green with the words: &quot;MATCH FOUND&quot; (blinking in red)</p>
<p>(The Union ID Card of the person identified pops up on screen along with a picture with the following information. It belongs to ROBERT HARRIS, night-shift project manager for the new Clark County Jailhouse.)</p>
<p>[UNION IDENTIFICATION<br />
(Name) ROBERT HARRIS<br />
(Union ID) ELE2908-3492-0982-EEC<br />
(Soc. Sec #:) 1291-555-3528<br />
(Classification:) Class 4F<br />
(s*x) M<br />
(Endorse) M<br />
(Insured) 12-1990]</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) Sounds like you got a match.</p>
<p>(WARRICK and SARA are both surprised to see GRISSOM leaning against the open door. Neither one knew he was standing there. Both wondering ... )</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey, Griss. How long you been standing there?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (interrupting) Yeah, yeah, we do. The, um ... it's a former union guy turned night shift project manager.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Robert Harris. Does that name mean anything?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah. Especially if you bet against me.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks away leaving SARA and WARRICK wondering just how much he heard.)</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
[INT. POLICE DEPTARTMENT - MAIN HALLWAY]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM is talking with ROBERT HARRIS. SHERIFF BRIAN MOBLEY is also there.)</p>
<p><strong>Robert Harris</strong>: My prints are on the metal cutters because my prints are all over everything at the site. I'm the project manager.</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: There's no mystery here.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You're the project manager but you don't actually use all the tools, right?</p>
<p><strong>Robert Harris</strong>: I'm vigilant about safety. I'm always inspecting the equipment, tools ...</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: Look, this is what's going to happen here. The construction site is going to reopen and the investigation goes away.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sure. After the lab processes all the evidence.</p>
<p>(Behind the group, through the glass wall, BRASS is standing there. He taps on the window to get GRISSOM'S attention.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and BRASS talk out in the hallway.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: For the record, I don't like being put in the middle.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Who does?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I did a little homework on the guy who took a nosedive after he was electrocuted. Three days ago, he was voted union rep. Demanded more overtime pay, pressed for a walkout.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Motive?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Right. (he turns to leave, then stops.) Well, in case you're interested Bob Harris was the sheriff's best man.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns to go back to meet with ROBERT HARRIS and THE SHERIFF.)</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: Well, what was that about?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Ah, we're in a bowling league together.</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: Can we wrap this up?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sure. Someone tampered with Roger Valenti's drill. And I have only one suspect. (He looks at ROBERT HARRIS.)</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: I read the coroner's prelim. There is nothing in it about electrocution.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's why they call it a prelim. Mr. Harris, were you opposed to Roger Valenti's union activities?</p>

<p><strong>Randy Gesek</strong>: That's a good idea, but no. I'm starting a new business. Crime scene cleanup. I'm going to want some referrals.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'll put you on the list. </p>

<p><strong>Randy Gesek</strong>: Poor guy.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, that's rough. And the significance of this evidence?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hemochromatosis. Valenti had elevated levels of iron in his blood. Yellow pallor, shrunken testicles ... I think he's been ingesting trace amounts of iron over a long period of time.</p>
<p><strong>Randy Gesek</strong>: Why'd he eat iron?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Trace amounts are odorless, tasteless.</p>
<p><strong>Randy Gesek</strong>: He probably didn't even know. You're saying he was poisoned?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No. Iron molecules take a long time to build up. Could have been his diet repeated blood transfusions, excessive smoking possibly hereditary abnormalities.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So, where does this get us?</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: How many swabs does it take to process a blanket?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I'm thorough.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The lab tested Dylan Buckley's blood for Creatine Kinase which would be elevated post-seizure ...</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: ... but Dylan Buckley's levels were normal. I just got my own copy of the report. Dr. Sapien lied.</p>
<p>(NICK walks out of the lab. CATHERINE calls after him.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You're racing me, Nick. We're driving the same car. </p>
<p>(NICK doesn't stop walking down the hallway. He doesn't respond to CATHERINE'S question.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Nick! </p>
<p>(NICK still doesn't respond. He keeps walking down the hallway.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Nick, I'll have you removed from the case. </p>
<p>(NICK stops. He turns around as CATHERINE approaches him.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You're confronting suspects before the evidence is processed. You're flying solo, cutting me out. What's going on?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (he takes a deep breath) Okay. There are some people you're supposed to be able to trust, you know? I was nine. And she was a last-minute baby-sitter. (CATHERINE'S stunned.) All I can remember doing afterwards is sitting in my room in the dark, staring at the door waiting for my mom to get home. But I've never told anyone before.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: It's what makes a person, I guess.</p>
<p>(NICK apologizes.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I'm sorry, Catherine.</p>
<p>(He walks away. Camera holds on CATHERINE.)</p>

[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT INTERROGATION ROOM]</p>
<p>(BRASS is questioning IAN WOLF. GRISSOM is sitting in the back.)</p>
<p><strong>Ian Wolf</strong>: You checked me out. So what? Worst thing I've done is get a speeding ticket.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: And take a pipe to Roger Valenti's head four days before he died. No, it wasn't on the foreman's report. Valenti's widow told me.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks over at IAN WOLF'S tool belt on the table next to him.)</p>
<p><strong>Ian Wolf</strong>: It's a work site. Guys get in beefs all the time. </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: But this guy died and Bob Harris had nothing to do with it. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Despite your efforts to make it seem that way.</p>
<p><strong>Ian Wolf</strong>: Look, I'm not saying another word till I talk to a union lawyer. I pay my dues and these guys play hardball.</p>
<p>(IAN WOLF stands, picks up his hard hat and tool belt, and leaves the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: He's guilty.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Let's not make the same mistake twice.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>

[INT. GREG'S LAB]</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: FYI. Thirty swabs in six hours? Not realistic, all right? Even for me.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Come on, Greg, I thought you liked a challenge. What are we looking at here?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Lots and lots of epithelials. There were skin cells shed all over the blanket.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Dylan Buckley's. Dr. Sapien's.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: You're two-thirds of the way there. I also isolated a set of cells from another individual. Identity unknown. But when it's important to Nick here, I push further. Seven of the 13 markers matched your dead kid.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Familial DNA.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Father's dead, means we're looking at mom.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Naked kid under a blanket at his shrink's late at night and his mother's there.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yeah, your case just entered a whole new dimension of weird.</p>
<p>(Camera holds on NICK'S thoughtful look. Behind him, we see GRISSOM walk into the hallway his nose in a file, the camera follows GRISSOM.)</p>

<p>[INT. CSI - PRINT LAB]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM enters the room and sees SARA at the computer.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Where's Mandy?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: She's cross-eyed from running our partial. I didn't want to lose any time, so I took over. The database is 70,000. It could still take a while.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What if I narrowed the scope? To one.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We got a suspect?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Ian Wolf. Like the animal not the authors.</p>
<p>(SARA makes the entry and hits enter. The computer lines up the prints and beeps with the results.)</p>

<p>(DOC ROBBINS is eating when NICK and CATHERINE walk in.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Doc? The kid in his underwear ... Tell us about the Y-incision. </p>
<p><strong>Doc Robbins</strong>: Leftovers from my anniversary dinner.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>Doc Robbins</strong>: Thanks. Same tan fibers I found on the outside I found on the inside. Mouth, nasal passages, both lungs.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: He was wrapped in that blanket.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mm-hmm. Head-to-toe.</p>
<p>(Flash to White: CGI Flash POV showing us DYLAN BUCKLEY wrapped in the tan-colored angora blanket. The blanket covers his entire head and body. Camera starts from above the blanket. DYLAN opens his mouth and the camera dives in and down through his air passages carrying some of the blanket fibers with it.)</p>
<p>FLASH TO WHTE:</p>
<hr />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT INTERROGATION ROOM]</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mrs. Buckley, we know that your son didn't have a seizure. We also know that you were at Dr. Sapien's house with Dylan the night that he died.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: He was in his underwear wrapped in a blanket fighting for every breath.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Buckley</strong>: I loved my son.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: That's what every parent says.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Buckley</strong>: This ... this was therapy. I had tried everything else. Taken him to so many specialists. But I couldn't reach him. So we ... we tried the ... (she looks at DR. SAPIEN) I have to tell them.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Leigh Sapien</strong>: It's called Re-Birthing.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Re-Birthing?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Leigh Sapien</strong>: It's a technique used to treat extreme behavioral disorders. Idea is to turn back the clock. Wipe the slate clean. Allow the child to re-bond with his mother.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What is the blanket for?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Leigh Sapien</strong>: It represents the birth canal.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So you wrapped Dylan up ... beat the hell out of him and hocus-pocus, he's supposed to love you again?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Leigh Sapien</strong>: Rebirthing may not be a recognized therapeutic procedure, but it's not illegal.</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. O'Riley</strong>: Last time I checked, murder is.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Buckley</strong>: I begged her to do it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Leigh Sapien</strong>: All other methods of therapy had failed. Dylan was becoming more belligerent, withdrawn, even dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Buckley</strong>: I just wanted my son to love me. That's all.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Leigh Sapien</strong>: Dylan was a willing participant.</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. O'Riley</strong>: He was 14.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Leigh Sapien</strong>: I instructed Dylan to lie down on the floor. In a fetal position. As part of the process ... </p>
<p>(Flashback during (V.O.): DYLAN BUCKLEY in his boxers. DR. SAPIEN and MRS. BUCKLEY are in the living room also. Flash to white. DYLAN BUCKLEY on the tan-colored blanket. Flash to white to present. Camera hold on CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Leigh Sapien</strong>: ... I asked him if he wanted to be reborn to his mother. He said yes.</p>
<p>(Flashback: DR. SAPIEN and MRS. BUCKLEY gathering the edges of the blanket and effectively wrapping the blanket around DYLAN.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Leigh Sapien</strong>: Now we're going to close the womb. And twist it.</p>
<p>(End of Flashback. Resume Present. Camera on NICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So, then what happened? Things got out of hand? He changed his mind?</p>
<p>(MRS. BUCKLEY covers her eyes as she begins to cry.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Somewhere in the middle of an angora birth canal?</p>
<p>(Flashback: DR. SAPIEN and MRS. BUCKLEY hold the blanket closed as DYLAN begins to struggle inside.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Leigh Sapien</strong>: It's time to be reborn. That's it, Dylan. Push harder, push harder! Harder ...</p>
<p><strong>Dylan Buckley</strong>: Mom, stop it! I can't breathe!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Leigh Sapien</strong>: Push hard.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan Buckley</strong>: Mom, please just stop!</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Leigh Sapien</strong>: Do you want to be reborn or stay in there and die?</p>
<p><strong>Dylan Buckley</strong>: Quit pushing on me, please! Mom, please, I want this to stop.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Buckley</strong>: ... maybe we should ... </p>
<p><strong>Dr. Leigh Sapien</strong>: No, this is what happens. We can't stop now. Trust me. This is the normal response.</p>
<p>(End of Flashback. Resume Present. Camera on MRS. BUCKLEY.)</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Buckley</strong>: I thought it was part of the process. She told me that that's what he was supposed to say. That babies don't want to come out.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Leigh Sapien</strong>: That's right. </p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Buckley</strong>: That that's why it's such an ordeal for the woman.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So you pushed on him like a mother in labor?</p>
<p>(Flashback: DR. SAPIEN and MRS. BUCKLEY hold the blanket closed as DYLAN continues to struggle inside.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Leigh Sapien</strong>: Come on. Push harder.</p>
<p><strong>Dylan Buckley</strong>: No, mom, I can't breathe!</p>
<p>(DR. SAPIEN and MRS. BUCKLEY hold the blanket closed as DYLAN continues to struggle inside.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Leigh Sapien</strong>: Push harder! (DYLAN continues to fight against them.) That's it.</p>
<p>(DYLAN'S stops struggling. DR. SAPIEN and MRS. BUCKLEY open the blanket. DYLAN'S not moving.)</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Buckley</strong>: Dylan? DYLAN? HONEY?</p>
<p>(End of Flashback. Resume Present. Camera on MRS. BUCKLEY.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Leigh Sapien</strong>: When we opened the blanket, his eyes were closed. I thought he was pretending to be asleep.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So much for your ... therapy.</p>
<p>(Both DR. SAPIEN and MRS. BUCKLEY look at NICK. NICK stands and leaves the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Excuse me.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Wolf stuck a nail in Valenti's boot, compromised the drill and cut the grounding prong with his own cutters.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Seems like a lot of work to kill a guy.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Not for an electrician I'm going to find Brass.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM starts to leave the room. WARRICK stops him.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey, Griss. I think I can speak for both of us when I say I'm sorry that we let you down.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: They're just part of the story.</p>
<p>(Flash to white: FLASHBACK POV showing us IAN WOLF opening ROGER VALENTI'S locker, pulling out his right boot and sticking a nail on the bottom, pressing it in with his thumb.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) You spiked Roger's boot with the nail -- compromised the insulation. </p>
<p>(Flash to white. Resume Present. Camera on GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You reversed the polarity in his drill. </p>
<p>(Flash to white: Flashback POV showing us IAN WOLF on the floor cutting the drill's grounding prong with his wire cutters. Flash to white. A pair of wire cutters slipping out of a plastic thermos being placed on the ground.)</p>

<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: You got the bad apple.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, how about that? Just in time for my big &quot;public apology&quot;.</p>

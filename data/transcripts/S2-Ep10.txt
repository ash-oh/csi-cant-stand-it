[EXT. JUST OUTSIDE CASINO - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(A man and a woman walking by sees a young man just outside a casino in distress. They look at each other and decide to try to help him.)</p>
<p><strong>Matthew Orton</strong>: You all right?</p>
<p><strong>Vincent Avery</strong>: I'm barred. I've got, like, ten thousand dollars in chips and I cannot cash it. Look, if I kept my eye on you two, could you please just go in there and claim my money?</p>
<p><strong>Cindy Orton</strong>: Sure, we can do that for you, but you don't have to keep your eye on us ...</p>
<p><strong>Matthew Orton</strong>: We're honest people.</p>
<p><strong>Vincent Avery</strong>: I'm sure you are, but ... come on. If I'm going to be giving you ten grand in chips, I've just got to know that you're coming back.</p>
<p><strong>Cindy Orton</strong>: We could give you a deposit.</p>
<p><strong>Matthew Orton</strong>: What kind of deposit?</p>
<p><strong>Vincent Avery</strong>: Two thousand dollars ... would give me peace of mind. Tell you what, you two come back and I will give you back your deposit plus another thousand?</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CASINO - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The hotel cashier holds up the $500 blue dummy chip and examines it.)</p>
<p><strong>Cashier</strong>: I'm sorry sir, I can't cash this for you.</p>
<p><strong>Matthew Orton</strong>: What? Why?</p>
<p><strong>Cashier</strong>: (he shakes his head) They're worthless.</p>
<p>(The couple run out of the hotel to look for the young man.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. CASINO - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(The couple exit the hotel looking for the man, but he's long gone. They look up and down the strip. There's no sign of him.)</p>
<p>(Sound of a gun shot coming from the parking structure followed by sounds of car tires screeching can be heard.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. TROPICANA -- PARKING GARAGE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(As they walk toward the crime scene, BRASS fills GRISSOM in.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Guy was running one of the oldest scams in Vegas. Would have gotten away with it, to until the getaway driver put a nickel in the guy's jukebox. </p>
<p>(BRASS turns around and indicates the couple talking to DET. SAM VEGA. He's showing the couple an evidence bag. CINDY ORTON nods her head, yes.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: That's the Ortons from Florida. The, uh, couple ID'd the deceased as the con man.</p>
<p>(They both arrive at the crime scene. GRISSOM puts his CSI kit down and crouches low to get a better look. He notices three hundred dollar bills next to the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: That's the Ortons' money. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks up at BRASS.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's mine now. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks around.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Surveillance?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Not in the garage.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Banana skids and fresh blood -- that helps. Oil slick doesn't hurt us either.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Sam Vega</strong>: Hey, Jim. Got these from the cage.</p>
<p>(DET. SAM VEGA hands BRASS the evidence bag full of dummy gambling chips.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Thanks, Sam. The chip clip. Haven't seen that one in a while. </p>
<p>(He hands the bag to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Striking resemblance to Judas.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: How's that?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Both men lost their lives over a worthless bag of chips.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS.</p>

[INT. CSI -- HALLWAY]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM maneuvers his way through the hallway traffic while carrying a plastic bottle of cockroaches and a large pexi-glass container. He's also sporting a traveling bag over his shoulder.)</p>
<p>(He passes by GREG'S LAB. GREG is busy at work while punk rock music plays loudly inside. GRISSOM opens the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hey, Sanders, no punk rock.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: What about black flag?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM glances down at his container full of cockroaches.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Are you nuts?</p>
<p>(He closes the door and continues down the hallway. As he hurries to his office, he nearly runs into CATHERINE who just turns the corner in front of him.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Whoa. Careful. Livestock.</p>
<p>(He holds up the container of cockroaches.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hissing roaches from Madagascar.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: These babies run two and a half miles an hour.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I don't doubt that for a minute.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Fifth annual entomological convention in Duluth. Cockroach racing finals.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM pushes the door to his office open and walks in. CATHERINE follows.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You're roach racing</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Actually, I'm giving a tutorial in preserving mass crime scenes. The sideshow is racing these guys.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Ah.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I mean, to have a chance to run against legendary roaches like Cocky Balboa; The Drain Lover; Priscilla, Queen of the Gutters. It's huge.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What do you feed those guys?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Dog food.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And who's ... supervising night shift?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You are.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Me? I am on the red-eye to Reno. The Braun Family is opening a new casino. I am Sam's date.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's tonight?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I told you once, memo'd you twice.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE sighs. GRISSOM is distracted by the roaches in the container.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Man, these guys are primed.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE leaves the room. On her way out, she reminds him ... )</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Better get somebody.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - LOCKER ROOM]</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: &quot;A&quot; slash? Acting supervisor? What about Nick? He's got seniority. Or Sara -- she'd jump at the chance.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: If it was about seniority, I'd ask Nick. If I needed someone to stay up for three straight days I'd ask Sara. Instead, I want you.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: And if I ask why?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Your curiosity would be better served on the case.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM hands the assignment sheet to WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The shooting death of a con man at the Tropicana. Our guys are already there.</p>
<p>(He turns to leave the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hang on! Have you told NICK and SARA about this?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No.</p>
<p>(WARRICK sighs. Camera holds on WARRICK.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>

[INT. TROPICANA - PARKING GARAGE - LEVEL 5 -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(NICK sets up a camera on a tripod. SARA walks around the crime scene looking for evidence.)</p>
<p>(Camera cuts to an oil spot on an oil spill on the ground. Two evidence markers #1 and #3 are coned next to the spill. Cut to NICK snapping a picture of a white strip. Flash to white. Cut to SARA still looking for evidence. She sees something.)</p>
<p>(Cut to NICK moving the tripod over to another spot. He sets up the camera pointing it straight downward over the tire treadmarks. He snaps a picture. Flash to white. He takes another photo of the treadmarks. He moves the tripod over to another spot along the treadmark. He does this several times to get one continuous picture of the treadmark.)</p>
<p>(SARA notices the film container under the car. She kneels in low to get a better look at it. She picks it up.)</p>
<p>(Cut to NICK continues to snap pictures of the treadmark.)</p>
<p>(Cut to SARA notices that there's something inside the film container. She opens it and empties it out into the palm of her gloved hand. Out pours nine pill-sized black capsules. She smells it.)</p>
<p>(WARRICK pulls up to the crime scene in his car. He exits the car and approaches the crime scene.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I got one left. Smile. (He snaps the camera.) Lovely.</p>
<p>(SARA sees WARRICK approach. He steps over the crime scene tape.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Nice of you to show up.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, we're done here, brother.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, I'm sorry, I got detained. I guess you did a &quot;one-to-one&quot; on these treads already?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, I just finished it.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Put together an evidence list?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You've got to do it.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You were late.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Ah, I don't think so. I got to go back with the body. Sara, can you get back to the lab and put a rush on this analysis?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Who died and made you boss?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: He's not exactly dead.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Grissom gave you shift tonight.</p>
<p>(SARA goes back to the body to finish up.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (to NICK) Anything you want to say?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah. Good luck.</p>
<p>(NICK snaps the empty camera and it flashes at WARRICK. He leaves. Camera holds on WARRICK.)</p>

[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(WARRICK enters the room. He tosses on his scrubs and puts his gloves on.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Get a speeding ticket?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Side roads. So ... this is our con artist?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Vincent Thomas Avery. I.D.'d him from his prints.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Did it tell you anything?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: No mystery in cause of death. Gunshot wound to the outer ear.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV to the left side of VINCENT AVERY'S head. Camera moves in for a close up of the entry wound. Flash to white. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Left ear at that.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well. Probably when he was getting into the car.</p>
<p>(Quick Flashback to VINCENT AVERY running up to the car. Getting into the front passenger seat.)</p>
<p><strong>Vincent Avery</strong>: All right, go, go, go!</p>
<p>(Cut to close up of a shadowed figure holding the gun to VINCENT AVERY'S head (left side). Flash to white. Resume to WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: He knew the driver.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Soot depiction on the skin surrounding the entry wound tells the story.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV of the left side of VA's outer ear. Camera moves in closer, through the outer ear, into the ear, following the path of the bullet. The bullet stops. Flash to white. Resume to ROBBINS.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (V.O.) Bullet entered the external auditory meatus fracturing the skull base. Cracked the hardest bone of the skull.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You got any pictures of that?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Hot off the fluoroscope. Haven't had the pleasure yet.</p>
<p>(ROBBINS holds up the film. They both see the location of the bullet.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Whoa.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: There is your bullet. Deformed projectile in the right side of the calvarium.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Can you fish that out for me?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: You bet.</p>
<p>(WARRICK glances at the other x-ray film. He sees something.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Wait a minute. </p>
<p>(WARRICK walks over to the light board and snaps the film in place. Several small balloon-shaped figures show on the film.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: There's something in his stomach.</p>
<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO:<br />
(ROBBINS starts the Y-incision and opens the chest to extract the stomach contents.)</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV from inside the stomach looking up and out at both WARRICK and ROBBINS. The camera swings around inside the stomach to show several small white balloon-like capsules coated with green goo. One white balloon is ruptured. The forceps extracts the ruptured white balloon. End CGI POV.)</p>
<p>(ROBBINS holds up the white balloon.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Something tells me, this isn't filled with white sugar.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: How many more are there?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: I'd say about 50 balloons. Green dye you see here is probably from lime flavored gelatin. Makes them much easier to swallow.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: He's a mule. Why is a guy trafficking in big-pay drugs wasting his time on some nickel-and-dime chip scam?</p>

[INT CSI -- LAB]</p>
<p>(NICK is using a magifying glass to examine the developed photos of the tire treadmarks from the garage. BRASS walks in.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hey, I got the horsepower on your Vic. Vincent Avery. Age 28, con man out of Atlantic City. Got enough petty thefts and grand larcenies on his record to choke a hippo.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, Jim ... what do you make of that void? Nail?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Either that or a spot on your lens.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Don't say that.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>

[INT. CSI -- LAB]</p>
<p>(GREG carefully puts a black powder from a mortar into a test tube. SARA walks in.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey. Are you baking a cake? What's the hold up on my pills?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Process. Just because you got passed over, don't take it out on me.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: He didn't pass me over.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Really? What would you call it, then?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Grissom.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Ah. </p>
<p>(GREG puts a sample on the card. Sample A is placed ON THE SPECTRATECH CARD (PTFE) then placed in the machine. It's closed, then processed.)</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV of blue light passing through the sample for analysis. End of CGI POV.)</p>
<p>(The following results show on screen: </p>
<p>COAL [b289372] with short write-up and chemical break-down on the bottom. )</p>

<p>COCONUT SHELLS [cpd_93-049-023]</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: And ... coconut shells.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Activated carbon. Activated charcoal pills. Best antacid in the world. Coats the stomach and absorbs all impurities.</p>
<p>(WARRICK enters the lab.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It's great if you're a mule transporting drugs into the states.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Our con man's a mule?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We found balloons of cocaine in his stomach cavity.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV of a see-through x-ray like skeleton swallowing several balloon-shaped items. It goes down its throat and into the stomach where a white cloud of gastric acid fills the stomach. End of CGI POV.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Without the pills, one bite of a chocolate bar would produce enough gastric acid in his stomach to eat away the balloon. Causing him to O.D.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Then he went out and got shot.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Speaking of which I found airline stubs in Avery's shirt.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Vincent Avery was four-A, Ellie Rebecca was four-B. Strange, right, using two first names?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No, what's strange is going into the evidence locker after post and not finding anything left.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey, don't make me feel bad for doing my job.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: If it was your job, you couldn't feel bad.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, I think I hear some coffee perking.</p>
<p>(GREG stands up and leaves the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What do you want from me? I'm working the case, the case is hot.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It's my case. Tonight, I'm the primary. I have to process it. If you have a problem with that, you can clock out now. Am I clear?</p>

<p>(NICK slowly walks out of the lab. WARRICK stops him.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey. Look where I just located this blood? Back of the grip.</p>

<p><strong>Special Agent Beckman</strong>: We put bait money in the hands of bad people. In this case, a reputed con. Our directive is to see how the money leads to law enforcement. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What if Vincent Avery wasn't murdered in that parking lot?</p>
<p><strong>Special Agent Tessari (Cindy Orton/Duffy)</strong>: Murder wasn't on the agenda.</p>
<p><strong>Special Agent Beckman</strong>: However, in light of unpredictable events this sting still upheld. It came to you, Sidle, and you didn't take. You should be very proud.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Wow. I don't feel that at all.</p>
<p><strong>Special Agent Beckman</strong>: It never feels right when it works. Only feels wrong when it doesn't.</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: They're nothing alike.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: From parent to child seven of thirteen markers should match up minimum. In this case there's not a single marker in common. I don't have Ellie's mother's DNA on file but my guess is ... </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What, is she adopted?</p>
<p>(WARRICK sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What about the blood on Brass's gun?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Not Brass's, not Ellie's. </p>

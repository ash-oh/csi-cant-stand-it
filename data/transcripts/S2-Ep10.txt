CUT TO:



Matthew Orton: You all right?
Vincent Avery: I'm barred. I've got, like, ten thousand dollars in chips and I cannot cash it. Look, if I kept my eye on you two, could you please just go in there and claim my money?
Cindy Orton: Sure, we can do that for you, but you don't have to keep your eye on us ...
Matthew Orton: We're honest people.
Vincent Avery: I'm sure you are, but ... come on. If I'm going to be giving you ten grand in chips, I've just got to know that you're coming back.
Cindy Orton: We could give you a deposit.
Matthew Orton: What kind of deposit?
Vincent Avery: Two thousand dollars ... would give me peace of mind. Tell you what, you two come back and I will give you back your deposit plus another thousand?
CUT TO:



Cashier: I'm sorry sir, I can't cash this for you.
Matthew Orton: What? Why?
Cashier:  They're worthless.
 
CUT TO:



CUT TO:



Brass: Guy was running one of the oldest scams in Vegas. Would have gotten away with it, to until the getaway driver put a nickel in the guy's jukebox. 

Brass: That's the Ortons from Florida. The, uh, couple ID'd the deceased as the con man.

Brass: That's the Ortons' money. 

Grissom: It's mine now. 

Grissom: Surveillance?
Brass: Not in the garage.
Grissom: Banana skids and fresh blood -- that helps. Oil slick doesn't hurt us either.
Det. Sam Vega: Hey, Jim. Got these from the cage.

Brass: Thanks, Sam. The chip clip. Haven't seen that one in a while. 

Grissom: Striking resemblance to Judas.
Brass: How's that?
Grissom: Both men lost their lives over a worthless bag of chips.
HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS.






Grissom: Hey, Sanders, no punk rock.
Greg: What about black flag?

Grissom: Are you nuts?

Grissom: Whoa. Careful. Livestock.

Grissom: Hissing roaches from Madagascar.
Catherine: Sorry.
Grissom: These babies run two and a half miles an hour.
Catherine: I don't doubt that for a minute.
Grissom: Fifth annual entomological convention in Duluth. Cockroach racing finals.

Catherine: You're roach racing
Grissom: Actually, I'm giving a tutorial in preserving mass crime scenes. The sideshow is racing these guys.
Catherine: Ah.
Grissom: I mean, to have a chance to run against legendary roaches like Cocky Balboa; The Drain Lover; Priscilla, Queen of the Gutters. It's huge.
Catherine: What do you feed those guys?
Grissom: Dog food.
Catherine: And who's ... supervising night shift?
Grissom: You are.
Catherine: Me? I am on the red-eye to Reno. The Braun Family is opening a new casino. I am Sam's date.
Grissom: That's tonight?
Catherine: I told you once, memo'd you twice.

Grissom: Man, these guys are primed.

Catherine: Better get somebody.
CUT TO:


Warrick: &quot;A&quot; slash? Acting supervisor? What about Nick? He's got seniority. Or Sara -- she'd jump at the chance.
Grissom: If it was about seniority, I'd ask Nick. If I needed someone to stay up for three straight days I'd ask Sara. Instead, I want you.
Warrick: And if I ask why?
Grissom: Your curiosity would be better served on the case.

Grissom: The shooting death of a con man at the Tropicana. Our guys are already there.

Warrick: Hang on! Have you told NICK and SARA about this?
Grissom: No.

CUT TO:









Nick: I got one left. Smile.  Lovely.

Sara: Hey.
Warrick: Hey.
Sara: Nice of you to show up.
Nick: Yeah, we're done here, brother.
Warrick: Yeah, I'm sorry, I got detained. I guess you did a &quot;one-to-one&quot; on these treads already?
Nick: Yeah, I just finished it.
Warrick: Put together an evidence list?
Sara: No.
Warrick: You've got to do it.
Nick: You were late.
Warrick: Ah, I don't think so. I got to go back with the body. Sara, can you get back to the lab and put a rush on this analysis?
Sara: Who died and made you boss?
Warrick: He's not exactly dead.
Sara: Grissom gave you shift tonight.

Warrick:  Anything you want to say?
Nick: Yeah. Good luck.

CUT TO:




Robbins: Get a speeding ticket?
Warrick: Side roads. So ... this is our con artist?
Robbins: Vincent Thomas Avery. I.D.'d him from his prints.
Warrick: Did it tell you anything?
Robbins: No mystery in cause of death. Gunshot wound to the outer ear.

Robbins: Left ear at that.
Warrick: Well. Probably when he was getting into the car.

Vincent Avery: All right, go, go, go!

Warrick: He knew the driver.
Robbins: Soot depiction on the skin surrounding the entry wound tells the story.

Robbins:  Bullet entered the external auditory meatus fracturing the skull base. Cracked the hardest bone of the skull.
Warrick: You got any pictures of that?
Robbins: Hot off the fluoroscope. Haven't had the pleasure yet.

Warrick: Whoa.
Robbins: There is your bullet. Deformed projectile in the right side of the calvarium.
Warrick: Can you fish that out for me?
Robbins: You bet.

Warrick: Wait a minute. 

Warrick: There's something in his stomach.
SHORT TIME CUT TO:



Robbins: Something tells me, this isn't filled with white sugar.
Warrick: How many more are there?
Robbins: I'd say about 50 balloons. Green dye you see here is probably from lime flavored gelatin. Makes them much easier to swallow.
Warrick: He's a mule. Why is a guy trafficking in big-pay drugs wasting his time on some nickel-and-dime chip scam?
CUT TO:



Brass: Hey, I got the horsepower on your Vic. Vincent Avery. Age 28, con man out of Atlantic City. Got enough petty thefts and grand larcenies on his record to choke a hippo.
Nick: Hey, Jim ... what do you make of that void? Nail?
Brass: Either that or a spot on your lens.
Nick: Don't say that.
CUT TO:



Sara: Hey. Are you baking a cake? What's the hold up on my pills?
Greg: Process. Just because you got passed over, don't take it out on me.
Sara: He didn't pass me over.
Greg: Really? What would you call it, then?
Sara: Grissom.
Greg: Ah. 


(The following results show on screen: 
COAL  with short write-up and chemical break-down on the bottom. )
Greg:  Coal.

WOOD  with short write-up and chemical break-down on the bottom.
Greg:  Wood.

COCONUT SHELLS 
Greg: And ... coconut shells.
Sara: Activated carbon. Activated charcoal pills. Best antacid in the world. Coats the stomach and absorbs all impurities.

Warrick: It's great if you're a mule transporting drugs into the states.
Sara: Our con man's a mule?
Warrick: We found balloons of cocaine in his stomach cavity.

Sara: Without the pills, one bite of a chocolate bar would produce enough gastric acid in his stomach to eat away the balloon. Causing him to O.D.
Warrick: Then he went out and got shot.
Sara: Speaking of which I found airline stubs in Avery's shirt.
Warrick: What?
Sara: Vincent Avery was four-A, Ellie Rebecca was four-B. Strange, right, using two first names?
Warrick: No, what's strange is going into the evidence locker after post and not finding anything left.
Sara: Hey, don't make me feel bad for doing my job.
Warrick: If it was your job, you couldn't feel bad.
Greg: Well, I think I hear some coffee perking.

Sara: What do you want from me? I'm working the case, the case is hot.
Warrick: It's my case. Tonight, I'm the primary. I have to process it. If you have a problem with that, you can clock out now. Am I clear?
Sara: Clear.

Warrick: It couldn't be.
CUT TO:



Warrick: Hey.
Brass: Hey.
Warrick: You have a daughter?
Brass: Where you going with this?
Warrick: Her prints came up on airline stubs relating to tonight's homicide.
Brass: Well, there's got to be more than one Ellie Brass in the world. 
Warrick: Ellie Rebecca Brass. DOB 9/24/82. Essex County, New Jersey. Last known address 554 Applegate Way.
 
Brass: Okay, you told me.
Warrick: Well, I've got to bring her in. You know that.
Brass: PD brings in suspects. I'll put Vega on it.

Warrick: You're hands off.

Brass: Of course.
CUT TO:



Warrick: Just go right in here.



Brass: I'm fine. I'm fine.

Brass:  So, we're going to pick up right where we left off huh, Ellie?
FADE TO BLACK.




Ronnie Litre: You still documenting the money from the con man?
Sara: Every serial number -- evidence.  bills have traces of cocaine on them?
Ronnie Litre: I was the one that told you that.
Sara: Oh, yeah.

Sara: Hey, Ronnie you know what the intaglio script is.
Ronnie Litre: Engraving on Ben Franklin's collar?
Sara: I don't see it on this bill. Do you?

CUT TO:


Ellie Brass: Everyone I sleep with dies.

Warrick: Excuse me?
Ellie Brass: I slept with this sailor once when I was fourteen. He died overseas somewhere.
Det. Sam Vega: What was your relationship to Vincent Avery?
Ellie Brass: There was no relationship. I barely knew him.
Det. Sam Vega: You knew him enough to fly to Baja with him.
Ellie Brass: He invited me for the weekend. I figured as long as he didn't chop me up I'd have some fun.

Ellie Brass: Mind if I smoke?
 
Warrick: Yeah.
Det. Sam Vega: Plain sight.

Warrick: It's a dummy chip. No casino logo.
Det. Sam Vega: Exactly the same kind of chips Vincent Avery used to scam the casinos. 

Det. Sam Vega: Before he got shot.
Warrick: So, you two fly down to Baja, pose as a married couple brought back home a stomach load of blow and then you run chip scams? Who's taking your drug profits?
Ellie Brass: Man, I wish I knew what you were talking about.
Det. Sam Vega: Someone catch you and Vincent working on the side? Shoot him?
Ellie Brass: I wasn't even there.
Det. Sam Vega: Where were you?
Ellie Brass: Home. In the bathroom.
Warrick: Yeah, she was passing pellets of cocaine.
Ellie Brass: I'm out of here.

Det. Sam Vega: Sit down.

Det. Sam Vega: Thank you.
Warrick: With your permission, we need to take some x-rays.
Ellie Brass: As long as you're the one doing them.
Det. Sam Vega: We'd also like to take a look at your car.
Ellie Brass: I lent it to my boyfriend.
Warrick: And what is his name?
Ellie Brass: You know, you have this whole Lenny Kravitz thing going on. I'm not one for brothers, but ... damn.
Warrick: His name.

Ellie Brass: Keith Driscoll.
CUT TO:


Brass: Now you're telling me to get involved.
Warrick: You were behind the glass. This evidence against your daughter doesn't look good.
Brass: Hey, listen, nothing places her at the murder.
Warrick: She mules drugs for a guy who ends up dead ten hours later? A BS chip scam, a lousy alibi?
Brass: Vega's on it, he'll find her boyfriend and if I know my daughter, that's your shooter.

Warrick: Brass. It's a big city. Boyfriend could disappear. But, hey, it's your kid.

CUT TO:



Ronnie Litre: Left scope is a government- issued $100 bill. Right scope is the money from your tourists. Scope confirms what you saw with the naked eye.
Sara: On a genuine bill, the words &quot;United States of America&quot; are written on the border of Ben Franklin's portrait. On the Ortons' bill the intaglio script is blacked out.

Ronnie Litre: It's called microprinting. A little trick treasury uses to thwart photocopying a U.S. bill.
Sara: What about pigmentation? Treasury seals and serial numbers are the same color, right?
Ronnie Litre: They are ... on the bill on your left.

Ronnie Litre: No printer on the market can make a true green. Blue and yellow hues always bleed in. Our monetary system depends on it.
Sara: Who do we notify? Treasury?
Ronnie Litre: Secret Service branch. They've got a field office in Vegas.
Sara: I'll put these back in the evidence room.

Sara: Wait till the Ortons find out what we do with counterfeit money.
CUT TO:


 
FADE INTO:



X-ray Technician: Nothing.
Ellie Brass: Told you I was clean.
Warrick: So you gave up your drugs to your boss, huh?
Ellie Brass: Boss?
Warrick: Do you realize every time you ingest one of those pellets that you risk dying from an overdose?
Ellie Brass: Only if I eat. Releases gastric acids, blah, blah, blah...
Warrick: So you can just not eat?
Ellie Brass: Well, you see, the thing with me is I'm mind over matter. I can imagine a hamburger, and I'm full. Will you fill me up, Warrick?

CUT TO:


Warrick: I don't think I can handle this. I got to call Grissom.

Nick: Then call him.
Warrick: But?
Nick: I didn't say anything.
Warrick: I heard it, bro -- a &quot;but&quot; in there.
Nick: You know how Grissom is. If you ask him for the keys to the car he's going to ask you if you've done your homework.
Warrick: Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
Nick: It's like a multiple choice question. You know? Go with your first choice.
Warrick: Sack up.
Nick: Sack up.

Brass:  So, what, did Warrick tell you to call me?
Catherine: Do you think you're the only friend I've got in the police department? I'm just telling you, be careful.

Brass: What am I supposed to do? Hold my breath and count to ten?
Catherine: Hey, look, we all get a little crazy when our kids are involved.
Brass: Look. I go on the job, it's standard police work. Enjoy Reno. I got this.
Catherine: Okay. Hey, but listen. If you find the boyfriend, don't go it alone.

Hitchhiker : I was just hitchhiking. I told the guy to let me out. I begged him.
Brass: Get lost.


Keith Driscoll: Easy man.
Brass: I'm only going to ask you once. What are you and Ellie into?
Keith Driscoll: What do you mean?
Brass: You got her muling in drugs from Mexico. You got her mixed up in homicide over at the ...
Keith Driscoll: No, you got it backwards, man. She turned me on to coke so I could stud for her.

Keith Driscoll: Hey, you can't just shoot me, man.
 
CUT TO:
Det. Sam Vega: Brass! Yo, Jim we got it.
Brass: Everything's cool.
Keith Driscoll: Hey, this guy was going to kill me, man. He pulled his gun.
Det. Sam Vega:  I'm sure the officer felt his life was in imminent danger, sir. We're detaining you for questioning related to the murder of Vincent Avery.
Keith Driscoll: I'm not riding with him.
Det. Sam Vega: You're right. You're not.

FADE TO BLACK.

Matthew Orton: What do you mean, you can't give it back? That's all the money we have for our vacation.
Sara: Well, it's counterfeit. We have to take it out of circulation.
Cindy Orton: What?
Sara: Mr. Orton, you don't look so surprised.
Cindy Orton: Matt? Honey?
Matthew Orton: I went to the gas station. The attendant told me the hundred I gave him was phony so I went to our branch bank here and I tried to exchange the bad money for the good but they said we couldn't do it. I mean, why would anybody turn in bad money if they can't get reimbursed for it?
Sara: Because it's in violation of Title 18, Section 473 of the United States Code punishable by up to fifteen years for knowingly passing on bad money.
Cindy Orton: Oh, my! God.
Matthew Orton: I just didn't want to get stuck holding the bag.
Sara: Do you have a $20 bill? 
Cindy Orton: No, our wallets are up in the room. 
Sara: Uh, I may have something. You see that ghost? Right there on the right? 

Cindy Orton: Oh, yeah.
Sara: Government embeds them in all bills. Protects against forgeries. You should see Lincoln on the five; he looks really stressed out.

Matthew Orton: Wish I had met you last week.
Sara: A Special Agent from Secret Service is going to want to talk to you about the final disposition of this case.

CUT TO:



Special Agent Beckman: Warrick Brown? Special Agent Beckman, Treasury Department. You're subbing in tonight, right?
Warrick: Treasury department?
Special Agent Beckman: Wanted to be sure CSI's on the same page on this counterfeit case.
Warrick: Counterfeit?
Special Agent Beckman: Our lab's going to want to analyze that money, too.
Warrick: What money?

Sara: You were with Brass's daughter. I didn't want to interrupt you.
Warrick: On a federal case?
Sara: Agent Beckman? I'm Sara Sidle. We spoke on the phone. Could you excuse us for a minute?

Sara: Warrick ... 

Nick: You got to turn on your pager. I got Brass' daughter's car in the garage.
Warrick: Hold up. I'm dealing with something.
Sara: This is why I didn't bring this to you.
Nick: Hey, Vega says we won't be able to hold the suspect more than half an hour.

Special Agent Beckman: Did Sidle hold back information on this money?
Sara: I didn't not tell him. I ran with the case. I do it with Grissom all the time.
Warrick: Well, I'm not Grissom!
Nick: Guys ... 
Sara: I didn't say it.
Warrick: Sara, brief Special Agent Beckman on the funny money. Nick, the garage.

Nick: Tire plug. That's a nail in sheep's clothing. 

Nick: Treads from the crime scene.

Nick: The void on the one-to-one matches the void on Ellie's left rear tire. Siamese twins.
Warrick: Proves one thing. This was the getaway car used in the murder.
Nick: Yeah.
CUT TO:



Warrick: We printed the vehicle your client was found driving. It puts the car at the scene of Vincent Avery's murder less than twelve hours ago.
Lawyer: Come off it. The car's not even registered to him.
Det. Sam Vega: Right. It's registered to the girl he bought tickets to Baja for.
Warrick: Bought tickets for Victor Avery as well.
Det. Sam Vega: Tickets were bought with your credit card but we have no proof he ever went down there.
Lawyer: He's a generous guy.
Det. Sam Vega: Till Avery made him mad.
Lawyer: You want to talk out the gun your captain pulled on my client -- an unarmed man? That's got P.D. brutality written all over it.
Warrick: Vega?
Det. Sam Vega: Safety precaution only. We're done.
Lawyer: Let's go.

CUT TO:


Special Agent Beckman: They don't have any money in their bathing suits so you suspect them of a high-end counterfeit operation.
Sara: No, but it did get me thinking. If something doesn't feel right it probably isn't. Take a look. This is the money we got from the con man. See the serial numbers? Each one is different.

Special Agent Beckman: Just like real money.
Sara: That's what threw Ronnie and I off the scent. This couple didn't make one bill and run off 100 copies with the same serial number. 

Sara: They had to burn separate plates for each serial number. 

Sara: Much harder to catch.
Special Agent Beckman: Very high-end. The Duffys are major counterfeiters.
Sara: You mean the Ortons.
Special Agent Beckman: Our investigators tell me they're the Duffys from Las Vegas County. Orton's their assumed names.
Sara: How long have you known that?
Special Agent Beckman: As soon as you phoned me I went on a T-Department Database. They've each done time for interstate fraud. And, yes, high-end counterfeiting.
Sara: You federal guys are sneaky.
Special Agent Beckman: Access. So, what do you want to do with the money?
Sara: It's your money now. Well, the Treasury's.
Special Agent Beckman: Thanks. I'll take it from here. Find their operation and shut it down.

Sara: Hey! I'm still part of this.
Special Agent Beckman: Not really. But you're making me look good to my superiors so if you want to tag along ...
Sara: I don't &quot;tag&quot; along.
Special Agent Beckman: Suit yourself.
CUT TO:

Warrick:  We got bad news from the garage.


Brass: Give it to me.
Warrick: The tire evidence puts Ellie's car at the murder scene. We'll be pressing charges, murder of Vincent Avery.
Brass: Oh, come on -- you know she didn't kill him. Keith Driscoll did.
Warrick: Maybe so, but we don't have Driscoll.
Brass: What?
Warrick: Vega had to turn him loose after your gun episode.
Brass: Oh, I get it. So Vega thinks she'll eventually rat out Driscoll.
Warrick: That's what you cops think.
Brass: Yeah, well, let me tell you something about my daughter.

Brass: Never happened.

CUT TO:



Ellie Brass: Are they arresting me? 
Brass: I'm going to bail you out. You can stay at my place.
Ellie Brass: I have a place. 
Brass: You have a place? 
Ellie Brass: Keith and I do. We share everything.

Brass: Ellie, why do you do this to yourself? You're better than that. You're better than him.
Ellie Brass: No, I'm not.

CUT TO:




Warrick:  Grissom's office. CSI ... Warrick speaking.
Det. Sam Vega: Warrick. It's Vega. We've got a four-forty-four.
Warrick: Officer-involved shooting? Who?
Det. Sam Vega: One guess.

CUT TO:




Ecklie: Congratulations, Brown. You just bounced off the glass ceiling.
Warrick: Excuse me?
Ecklie: Brass buys his daughter a get out of jail free card and her boyfriend ends up on a gurney. Good call.
Warrick: Ecklie, you're day shift. And you're here because ... 
Ecklie: I'm dedicated.
Warrick: Yeah, picture that.

Warrick: What the hell happened?
Det Sam Vega: Keith Driscoll shot in the throat. First officer here found Brass in the apartment, woozy. Keith Driscoll on the floor, lights out.
Nick: Where's his daughter?
Det. Sam Vega: No one knows. I got guys out looking for her right now.
Nick: Check his weapon?
Det. Sam Vega: Waiting on you guys.

Warrick: There's one round missing.

FADE TO BLACK.




Det Sam Vega: It's just you and me talking now, Jim. Off the record. You went to the apartment?
Brass: Yeah.
Det Sam Vega: You notify dispatch?
Brass: It was a personal visit.
Det. Sam Vega: You went looking for Keith Driscoll?
Brass: No. I went looking for Ellie.

Brass: Where is she?! 
Driscoll: She's not here, man! Hey, you got a warrant?


Brass: Everything's a blur after that.
Det Sam Vega: Do you remember drawing your gun?
Brass: No.
Det Sam Vega: But you're leaving something out.

Driscoll: Hey, you got a warrant?!

Brass: Ellie, are you here?

Brass: I'm not leaving anything out.
Det. Sam Vega: Your daughter lives there. She probably saw what happened. We're going to pick her up eventually.
Brass: Careful, she spits.

CUT TO:



Nick: One shot?
Warrick: Fifteen bullets left in brass's gun. There should be sixteen.
Nick: What kind of cop doesn't empty his magazine? They're trained to shoot to kill.

Warrick: Hey. Look where I just located this blood? Back of the grip.
Nick: Novice shooters get their hands pinched in the slide.

Warrick: Slide bite. Man, Brass didn't shoot this guy.
CUT TO:


Warrick: I need you to show me your hands.
Brass: You going to test for gunshot residue? It's a little late for that.
Warrick: Your hands, Captain.

Brass: Satisfied?
Warrick: I'm going to need to take your badge.
Brass: It not your job to take my stripes. In this case it is.
Warrick: Detective Vega.

Brass: No.

Sara: AB Dick forty-nine ten  offsets this is the Rolls Royce of printers. Closest thing to what the government uses. Multiple inks. Disaperf computer paper.
Special Agent Beckman: Heavy rag. Twenty-five percent  content. Makes for durability.
Sara: Mr. Duffy, can Agent Beckman and I see your burn plates please.

Sara: Press, ink, paper, burn plates ... the only question now is ... where's the money? Mr. and Mrs. Duffy?
Cindy Orton : There isn't any.
Sara: Oh, come on. You can print a million dollars a day with this operation. Where is it?
Special Agent Beckman: There is no money.
Sara: Excuse me? I don't get this. Beckman ... 
Special Agent Beckman: Congratulations, Sidle. You passed.
Sara: Passed?
Special Agent Beckman: Duffy is their code alias. This is Special Agent Conners. This is Special Agent Tessari. We're all with service. Quality control.
Sara: I don't ... 
Special Agent Beckman: We put bait money in the hands of bad people. In this case, a reputed con. Our directive is to see how the money leads to law enforcement. 
Sara: What if Vincent Avery wasn't murdered in that parking lot?
Special Agent Tessari : Murder wasn't on the agenda.
Special Agent Beckman: However, in light of unpredictable events this sting still upheld. It came to you, Sidle, and you didn't take. You should be very proud.
Sara: Wow. I don't feel that at all.
Special Agent Beckman: It never feels right when it works. Only feels wrong when it doesn't.
CUT TO:


Greg: First, I have the saliva sample taken from captain Brass's badge. Better known as Ellie's DNA. Take a good look at her markers. Second, blood sample from Jim Brass.
Warrick: They're nothing alike.
Greg: From parent to child seven of thirteen markers should match up minimum. In this case there's not a single marker in common. I don't have Ellie's mother's DNA on file but my guess is ... 
Warrick: What, is she adopted?

Warrick: What about the blood on Brass's gun?
Greg: Not Brass's, not Ellie's. 
Warrick: Not Ellie's? 
Greg: No, or her boyfriend Keith Driscoll. You still got a shooter out there.
Warrick: With a pinch on his hand. All right. Where's that manifest?

Keith Driscoll: I think I killed him.

Marty Gillmore: Wrong ... he killed you.

Warrick: So you off'ed Driscoll to take over his drug op. What about Ellie?

Marty Gillmore: She's supposed to be in jail for shooting Avery at the casino.
Warrick: You eat something?
Marty Gilmore: I took a laxative.
Warrick: Oh, god, he's going to OD. Can we get a medic?

Warrick: Can we get a medic?

Warrick: Brass?!

Brass:  I need rescue. 826 Herrick Lane. Overdose. Send an ambulance.
Marty Gillmore: Oh, my god, I'm going to die.
Brass: No, worse-- you're going to live.

(BRASS walks through the double doors. WARRICK runs to catch up to him.
Warrick: Brass. Hang on. 

Warrick: I only took it to get Ellie's DNA off of it. That's it. 
Brass: A man's got to do ... 

Brass: What is it, Rick?
Warrick: We were checking out the blood from your gun. We compared your DNA to her DNA.
Brass: Yeah?
Warrick: You never said anything about her being adopted.

Brass: She's not. Call it the mailman. Ellie doesn't know.

CUT TO:



Brass: Ellie.

Ellie Brass: How'd you find me?
Brass: I'm a detective. Listen, I heard that you never went back to Driscoll's apartment that night.
Ellie Brass: It's true.
Brass: I could have sworn I heard you in that other room.
Ellie Brass: No, dad. I was never there. Never.
Brass: I guess I've been doing that since you've been born. I mean, I know I was never around, but ... you know, no matter where I am ... no matter what I'm doing ... I always think that you're there. Even if you're not. Come back to me, Ellie.
Ellie Brass: Dad, it's way too late. I got to catch a flight to Jersey. Midnight. Mom says that I can stay with her for awhile.
Brass: Sure. Okay. You need a ride to the airport? I can get you there fast.
Ellie Brass: Thanks. I'm taking the shuttle.
Brass: Oh. Yeah. Okay.

Brass: Catch you later.

Warrick: Hey, Sara.
Sara: Hey.

Warrick: Hey ... I'm a little short on cash. Can you loan me a hundred?
Sara: Funny, very funny. 

Sara: Oh, look, shift's over. Guess you're one of us again.

Warrick: Hey, Griss. How'd it go?

Grissom: The seminar was fine. Every one of my roaches got stage fright. They came in fourth, third, second and dead last. How about you? How'd you do?

Warrick: Well, the job is fine. It's the other stuff -- the personalities. 
Grissom: &quot;I love mankind, it's people I can't stand.&quot;
Warrick: Is that Einstein?
Grissom: Linus.
Warrick: Charlie Brown. Figures. Is that why you put me in charge?
Grissom: You think I like dealing with people? Remember when you asked me what I was in high school? 
Warrick: Yeah, you said &quot;A Ghost&quot;. 

Grissom: When I leave CSI, there won't be any cake in the break room. I'll just be gone. So I wanted to see if you could step in. 

Grissom: Tell me ... all of it, from the top.
Warrick: From the top?
 
Warrick: I don't know where to start. It was wild.
Grissom: Couldn't have been that bad.

FADE TO BLACK.

							<p>THIS EPISODE CONTAINS ADULT CONTENT. PARENTAL DISCRETION IS ADVISED.</p>
<p>COLD OPEN: </p>
<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) – NIGHT]</p>
<p>[EXT. RESIDENTIAL SIDEWALK – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Libby Cooperson and Cammie Brookston walk home. They're dressed in sweats and carry their duffle bags with them.) </p>
<p><strong>Libby</strong>: (laughs) Oh, you were so on tonight, Cammie.</p>
<p><strong>Cammie</strong>: I was channeling my nerves in a positive way. Somebody's got to hold it together.</p>
<p>(They head inside.) </p>
<p>[INT. HOUSE – NIGHT – CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(The women laugh as they enter the house.) </p>
<p><strong>Cammie</strong>: I swear, Janice can't dance a straight line.</p>
<p><strong>Libby</strong>: Pigeon-toed. Should have stayed on the bluebell line. BG.</p>
<p>(They put their bags down on the hallway chair in the living room. They take their jackets off.) </p>
<p><strong>Cammie</strong>: Well, you know how she scored that principal role, right? Bad on her feet, good on her back.</p>
<p>(They laugh. Cammie stops and looks at the mess in the kitchen. On the center counter is a bottle of wine and two glasses.) </p>
<p><strong>Cammie</strong>: Oh, Libby, can you believe this? I am so sick of this pig sty.</p>
<p><strong>Libby</strong>: Been like this ever since Lauren got her creepy new boyfriend. </p>
<p>(Libby puts the car keys back on the hook. Cammie washes her hands in the sink.) </p>
<p><strong>Libby</strong>: He's a musician. My mom dated a musician -- total freeloaders.</p>
<p>(Libby stacks used pots on the stove as Cammie wipes her hands.) </p>
<p><strong>Cammie</strong>: If I get bumped to principal this week, I am so out of here.</p>
<p><strong>Libby</strong>: Take me with you.</p>
<p>(She turns and points to the burning cigarette in the ashtray on the table.) </p>
<p><strong>Libby</strong>: Becca fell off the wagon again.</p>
<p><strong>Cammie</strong>: The nicotine dancer diet.</p>
<p>(Suddenly, they hear loud music blasting from upstairs. The two girls look at each other and smile.) </p>
<p>(They head upstairs.) </p>
<p>FLASH TO PRESENT: </p>
<p>[INT. HOUSE – NIGHT – PRESENT]</p>
<p>(The cigarette in the ashtray on the table is burned out completely to the edge of the filter.) </p>
<p>(Sara notes it and continues looking around in the kitchen on her way to the living room. The house is eerily quiet. She shines her light back into the kitchen – there's half a six-pack of soda on the counter near the stove. There's the empty wine bottle on the kitchen floor.) </p>
<p>(Sara turns and slowly walks through the living room. She carries her kit and looks around as she goes.) </p>
<p>(The phone rings, startling Sara. The answering machine kicks on.) </p>
<p><strong>Roommates</strong>: (on machine) Hey! You've reached Showgirl Heaven. Please leave a message at the tone. Thanks. Bye.</p>
<p><strong>Agent (woman)</strong>: Cammie, great audition today. You made it, girl. You're principal. Call me for the details. Congrats!</p>
<p>(Sara passes the line of duffle bags on the floor against the wall. The machine beeps off. Sara heads for the stairs.)</p>
<p>(On the step, she notes a bloodied shoeprint. She looks up at the second floor, then cautiously makes her way up the stairs.)</p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO: </p>
<p>[INT. HOUSE – SECOND FLOOR -- NIGHT – FLASHBACK]</p>
<p>(Libby and Cammie reach the second floor.) </p>
<p><strong>Libby</strong>: Everyone's in my room. Follow the music.</p>
<p>(Cammie pauses to pick up some clothes hanging on the stairway bannister.)</p>
<p><strong>Cammie</strong>: Be right there.</p>
<p>(Libby hurries to her room. She pushes the door open -- </p>
<p><strong>Libby</strong>: Hey, guys.</p>
<p>(As Cammie turns to her own room, she smiles and glances at Libby long enough to hear a muffled scream and see Libby disappear into the room.) </p>
<p>(The bedroom door slams shut.) </p>
<p><strong>Cammie</strong>: Libby?</p>
<p>(Cammie takes a couple steps toward the room.) </p>
<p><strong>Cammie</strong>: Libby!</p>
<p>FLASH BACK TO PRESENT: </p>
<p>[INT. HOUSE – SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY / BEDROOM 1-- NIGHT – PRESENT]</p>
<p>(Sara reaches the second floor. On the carpet are bloodied shoe prints between the rooms.)</p>
<p>(We hear the snap of a camera shutter. Sara turns to Cammie's room and finds Warrick snapping photos. Warrick turns and looks at Sara. Sara nods back to him.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hell of a way to spend your night off.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: How many bodies do you have in there?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Three.</p>
<p>(PHOTO FLASHES of the three girls – one on the floor and one on each bed. They are all tied with their hands behind their backs and gagged.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Grissom's down the hall, first door on your right. Just follow the blood.</p>
<p>(Sara turns and heads for the hallway bedroom. She looks down at the bloodied shoeprints on the carpet.) </p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
[INT. HOUSE – SECOND FLOOR -- NIGHT – FLASHBACK]</p>
<p>(Cammie makes her way slowly to Libby's room. The music is loud. She comes up even to the door when someone reaches out and grabs her, pulling her into the room.)</p>
<p>(There are four other girls sitting on the floor, their hands tied behind their backs and gags in the mouths.)</p>
<p>WHITE FLASH BACK TO: </p>
<p>[INT. HOUSE – SECOND FLOOR BEDROOM 2 -- NIGHT – PRESENT]</p>
<p>(Sara shines her flashlight into the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: My date got canceled.</p>
<p>(An answering light shines back on Sara. Grissom looks at her.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm sure he had a good excuse.</p>
<p>(Sara steps cautiously into the bedroom. Grissom is kneeling next to the bed with a dead body on it.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Looks like sexual assault. Bound, pants pulled down.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Where do you want me?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Next bedroom. There's another body in there.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, that makes five. The dispatch said there were six.</p>
<p>(Grissom stands up.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: According to Brass, the boyfriend of one of the victims found the bodies. Said there were six roommates, all showgirls. Evidently, one didn't come home.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: She picked the right night.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. HOUSE – SECOND FLOOR BEDROOM 3 -- NIGHT – PRESENT]</p>
<p>(Sara walks into the third bedroom. There's a dead girl on the bed. She pauses a beat by the doorway and looks inside. She walks in.)</p>
<p>(Sara puts her kit down and steps closer to the bed, studying the scene. She looks around and notices some blood smeared on the floor next to the second bed in the room.)</p>
<p>(She walks over and kneels down to look under the bed. She shines her flashlight.)</p>
<p>(Suddenly, a BLOODY HAND SWIPES AT HER, SCRATCHING SARA'S FACE – </p>
<p>(Sara pulls back and reaches for her gun while shouting.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hot scene! Suspect under the bed!</p>
<p>(Grissom appears in the doorway.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sara!</p>
<p>(Sara looks under the bed and sees Cammie huddled in a pool of blood, her hands tied in front of her.) </p>
<p><strong>Cammie</strong>: (gasps) Please ... please help me. Please.</p>
<p>(Sara puts her gun aside and reaches for Cammie.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hold on. Victim down! Call an ambulance!</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (o.s.) Dispatch, this is CSI Grissom ...</p>
<p>(Sara holds Cammie's hand.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You're safe now, okay? You're safe now. It's going to be okay.</p>
<p><strong>Cammie</strong>: (gasps) Help me. Help me.</p>
<p>(We hold on Sara.) </p>
<p>SMASH CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) – NIGHT]</p>
<p>[EXT. SHOWGIRL HEAVEN RESIDENCE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(The street outside the residence is cluttered with officers, emergency personnel and news reporters.) </p>
<p><strong>News Repoter (man)</strong>: Up until a few hours ago, this was considered one of the safest neighborhoods in Las Vegas. But with the discovery of six young women brutally slain in their beds ...</p>
<p>(Nearer the house inside the taped-off area, Brass talks with Jonathan Alaniz, Becca's musician boyfriend.) </p>
<p><strong>Jonathan Alaniz</strong>: I got here at 3:45. I've been dating Becca about a month. When I saw all that blood on the stairs, I just ... I just knew.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Jonathan, do you have a key to the house?</p>
<p><strong>Jonathan Alaniz</strong>: Becca gave it to me. I usually try to come over and say good night, but I was ... I was late. Had a couple clients in town. But I didn't need the key. Front door was open.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: If we brought you some photos, would you be able to ID the girls for us?</p>
<p>(He nods.)</p>
<p>(Greg walks past them. An officer lifts up the tape for Greg to duck under. We STAY WITH Greg. He walks up to Brass and Sara waiting outside. There's a large scratch on Sara's left cheek. She has a jacket draped over her.)</p>
<p>(Greg doesn't say anything and continues on to the house.) </p>
<p>(We stay with Brass as he talks with Sara.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Look, I know this is tough, but did she give you anything?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: She told me her name. When I went into the room, she thought that I was him.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (shakes her head) It didn't make any sense.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: Sara holds Cammie.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Can you tell me your name?</p>
<p><strong>Cammie</strong>: Ca ... Cam ... Cammie.</p>
<p>(Sara sits on the floor and holds Cammie.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Cammie, I'm Sara. Who did this to you, Cammie?</p>
<p><strong>Cammie</strong>: Mm-an.... mm-an.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The man, what did he look like?</p>
<p><strong>Cammie</strong>: Poor w ... Poor wine ...</p>
<p>(Sara shakes her head. It makes no sense to her.) </p>
<p><strong>Cammie</strong>: Breast ... Breast ... knife ...</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: He-he stabbed you in the chest?</p>
<p>(Cammie grunts and shakes her head.) </p>
<p><strong>Cammie</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (shouts) I need some help here!</p>
<p><strong>Cammie</strong>: Bye ... Fin ... </p>
<p>(And Cammie dies.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No, no. No.</p>
<p>END OF FLASHBACK</p>
<p>[INT. SHOWGIRL HEAVEN RESIDENCE – STAIRS – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Nick snaps photos of the bloodied shoe print on the stairs.) </p>
<p>(Greg walks in and starts climbing the stairs.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Looks like he was about a size 11.</p>
<p>(Greg stops and looks at Nick.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: You been up there yet?</p>
<p>(Nick looks at Greg and raises his eyebrows. Greg nods back. Greg continues up the stairs, around Nick's shoe prints.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. SHOWGIRL HEAVEN – BEDROOM 2 – NIGHT] </p>
<p>(As David Phillips reports, Grissom tries to take a photo of the window while holding the ALS in his hand.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: I've been through all the bedrooms. She's the last. Rebecca Mayford. Boyfriend ID'd her. Neck's clean. The other five victims' throats were transected. There are at least a dozen stab wounds to the chest and abdomen. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah. He took his time with her. The others were killed efficiently.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Liver temp is 95.6. Been dead at least two hours, which is consistent with four of the five other victims.</p>
<p>(CAMERA POV: Grissom finds footprints on the window and is taking a photo of them.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: David, don't move any of the bodies just yet, okay?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p>(David leaves the room. Greg walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: (to Greg) Hey. </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: What did you find?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Partial footprint. Whoever kicked in this window was barefoot.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: She's wearing socks.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, but some of the others weren't.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Means one of them must have been in here at some point.</p>
<p>(Greg looks at the photos in the bedroom.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I don't think this was her room.</p>
<p>(Grissom looks around.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What else?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Looks like the bindings were cut from the sheets.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: The killer rips the sheets. End of flash.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: It takes at least a few minutes to cut up a sheet.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I think when he came to this house, he was unprepared. He had to use things that were already here. They say a disorganized killer is apt to obtain his victims by chance.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. SHOWGIRL HEAVEN – BEDROOM 1 – NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Warrick is gathering evidence from the body on the bed.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) Luck of the draw.</p>
<p>(He puts it in a bindle. Catherine walks in. She stops in front of the body on the floor.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Busy night.</p>
<p>(Warrick stops gathering evidence as he pauses to really look at the face of the girl on the bed.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: She looks so familiar.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: When I first started doing this, everybody I worked on reminded me of someone.</p>
<p>(Warrick stands up.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Somehow, we all get past it.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'm not so sure that's a good thing.</p>
<p>(Catherine heads for the bathroom.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'll start with the bathroom.</p>
<p>[INT. SHOWGIRL HEAVEN – SECOND FLOOR BATHROOM – CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(Catherine walks in. There are photos tucked in the mirror frame and a long-white feather boa draped on a second wall mirror.)</p>
<p>(Two evidence markers are near two shoe prints leading up to the bathroom sink.) </p>
<p>(Catherine looks at the spilled powder on the counter. There are impressions in the powder. She snaps several photos.) </p>
<p>(In the trash bin she finds a bloodied paper towel. She snaps photos of it, then picks it up and puts it in a paper package. She puts the evidence package on the side.) </p>
<p>(She snaps more photos of the tissues in the trash bin and bags them.)</p>
<p>(There are many paper evidence bags on the side.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. SHOWGIRL HEAVEN – BEDROOM 1 – NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Grissom finds a picture of Becca.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The girl in this picture is the victim from my room.</p>
<p>(He picks up the picture and the recording in the bear activates.) </p>
<p>(Warrick looks up.) </p>
<p><strong>Jonathan Alaniz's Voice</strong>: (recorded) Becca, I'm so crazy about you. I just wanted to tell you happy three-week anniversary! You're awesome! And I love you bear-y much. (chuckles) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Sounds like Becca was still a kid.</p>
<p>(Grissom puts the photo back on the shelf. He looks at another set of photos of Becca in her showgirl costume.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah. Well, not when she was onstage.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So, Grissom, I found beige carpet fibers on all three victims. It's consistent with the hallway carpet. I've also found rug burns on their knees.</p>
<p>(ZOOM for CU of the abrasions on one of the victim's knees and the carpet fibers caught inside.) </p>
<p>[INT. SHOWGIRL HEAVEN – HALLWAY– NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Grissom and Warrick walk outside the bedroom. They follow the bloodied shoe prints on the carpet.) </p>
<p>(They follow the shoe prints to the second bedroom.) </p>
<p>[INT. SHOWGIRL HEAVEN – BEDROOM 2 – CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(They look inside where the sheets have been pulled off the beddings.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Killer herded them all into here. He used the sheets from that bed to tie them up, then dragged them all down the hallways to the other two bedrooms to kill them.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The killer ties the girls up.)</p>
<p>(CUT TO: The killer grabs the girls down the hallway.)</p>
<p>(CUT TO: The girls are dead on the bed.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What about Becca? Why wasn't she dragged somewhere else?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Maybe he wanted to get her alone. Maybe she excited him ... or pissed him off. Either way, he was brutal with her. She was the messiest kill.</p>
<p>(Catherine walks into the room.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: He had a gun. I found grip and slide impressions in some powder on the bathroom counter.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, a gun is one good way for crowd control. Why didn't he just shoot them?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Noise factor? You can't scream once your throat's been slit.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah. He had all the time he needed 'cause the neighbors couldn't hear a thing.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. SHOWGIRL HEAVEN – BACKYARD – NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Sara walks around the side to the back of the house. She sees a porch chair jammed under the back door knob.) </p>
<p>(Sara puts her kit down and snaps several photos of the chair. She dusts the chair arm rests for prints and finds several.) </p>
<p>(Quick flash of: SOMEONE jams the chair under the knob. End of flash.) </p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) – DAY] </p>
<p>[INT. SHOWGIRL HEAVEN – KITCHEN – DAY] </p>
<p>(Nick snaps pictures of the photos pinned to the bulletin board in the kitchen. He pauses a moment to really look at the faces of the women who lived in the house. He continues to take photos.) </p>
<p>(He stops when the back door opens.) </p>
<p>(Sara opens the door and nods to him. She walks into the house, closing the door behind her.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: He used a chair to jam this door.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I heard about what happened. You okay?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'm fine.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: There's a custom-made label on a wine bottle over there.</p>
<p>(Nick points to the wine bottle on the kitchen floor. Sara kneels down and reads the label.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: &quot;Love, Lewis.&quot;</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: Sara holds Cammie.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Who did this to you, Cammie?</p>
<p><strong>Cammie</strong>: Mm-an .... mm-an. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The man. What did he look like?</p>
<p><strong>Cammie</strong>: Poor w ... Poor wine.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: How did Cammie Brookston survive until we got there?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Well, in her case, there was only a partial transection of the jugular. Shallower cut, slower bleed.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I found her at least two hours after the attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: She must've applied pressure to her wound. That would've bought her some time.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So if we'd have found her sooner, she would still be alive.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Sara, there's nothing you could've done.</p>

<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Well, she has a C-section uterine scar. Hairline, almost invisible.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: She has a child.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Well, she gave birth some time ago.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Any signs of sexual assault?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Not with Cammie. I found semen in the vaginas of Emily Wilson and Lauren Walderson. Both had mild reddening and some superficial abrasion at the vaginal introitus. They could have had consensual s*x in the hours prior to the attack. This young lady was raped.</p>
<p>(He turns to the body on the table set aside.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Rebecca Mayford had lacerations at three o'clock. Contusions extended from four to eight and ten to twelve.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Any semen?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: No. But, uh, look at these puncture wounds. Stab wounds have a large cutting component to the margins. Several of these stabs have additional tracks through the organ, suggesting a partial withdrawal and re-thrust of the blade.</p>

<p><strong>Chris Mullins</strong>: Was she blonde? I didn't meet all the roommates.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Boy, you have an answer for everything, huh? What about the guy in the bar? What about him, what did he do, look at you the wrong way, bum a smoke? Or did he want you to give it to him, too?</p>
<p><strong>Chris Mullins</strong>: You know what? Lawyer. Now.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – LAYOUT ROOM – DAY]</p>
<p>(Grissom, Warrick, Catherine and Nick meet.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, DNA confirmed that Mullins had s*x with Emily and Lauren. Assuming he's the killer, why didn't we find any semen in Becca?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Maybe by the time he got to her, he was unable to ejaculate.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I was able to make a physical match between the broken tip in Becca and the knife recovered from outside the bar.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Was the same knife used to stab Marlon Frost?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: We don't know yet. Sara's at the hospital now -- she's bringing back a DNA sample to compare.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Whoever ... shanked Frost killed those girls.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Did you get any prints on that knife?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah. No ridge detail. Same smudges were found on the wine bottles and in the bedrooms.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Smudges won't put the knife in Mullins' hands, though.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I don't get it. He stabs the guy and walks back in the bar.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: All the evidence at the house suggests that the killer was unfamiliar with the layout.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And by his own admission, Mullins had been in that house at least a couple of nights.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, that's also how he could've made the connection to Becca.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. HOSPITAL – MARLON'S ROOM – DAY]</p>
<p>(Sara snaps photos of Marlon Frost's wounds.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Mr. Frost, I'll be out of your way soon. I'm sure you want to get some sleep.</p>
<p>(Sara turns to get the ink and paper.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I just need to get your fingerprints. It's routine. I promise it won't hurt.</p>
<p>(She takes his prints. He watches her.) </p>
<p>(She notices the smudges on his fingertips. When she finishes printing him, she turns his hands over to look at his fingertips. The skin is callused.)</p>
<p>(She turns and looks at Marlon Frost. He stares back at her.)</p>
<p>(Suddenly, he grabs her hard with both hands. Sara tries to get away.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (grunting) Get off me! Get off me!</p>
<p>(She frees herself from him. In the struggle, his gown slips off his shoulders, revealing a large discoloration – a birthmark.) </p>
<p>(Quick flash to: [BEDROOM] Cammie sees the birthmark on Marlon Frost's shoulder as he cuts her neck. There's a noise from the other room and he gets up to check it out, leaving her on the floor.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
<strong>Cammie</strong>: Port... port wine... port wine.</p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p>[INT. CSI – HALLWAY – DAY]</p>
<p>(Sara reports her findings to Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: He has a vascular birthmark, a port wine stain, on his upper chest -- that's what Cammie was trying to tell me. We can get DNA off his bloody clothes, but we have no blood or semen at the scene to compare it to. His prints are useless -- they're all calluses. They only leave smudges, like the kind we found on the broken knife. I think the b*st*rd tried to kill himself.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sara, slow down. Frost isn't going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I am going to nail this son of a bitch, and I don't want him to think for a single second that he is going to get away with this.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Okay, one step at a time.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Frost smelled like alcohol when they took him into the ER so they ran a tox. His BAC came back .34 -- only a chronic alcoholic can function at those levels. You know what I think? I think he polished off the wine at the scene straight from the bottle.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So his DNA should be on it.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[DNA RESULTS]</p>
<p>(The DNA results are a MATCH.) </p>
<p>(The suspect is ID'd as DAVID MARLON.) </p>
<p>(The view REFOCUSES, revealing Sara's reflection in the monitor.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (from conference) The suspect's name is David Marlon. M-A-R-L-O-N. </p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – INTERVIEW ROOM – DAY]</p>
<p>(Brass is talking with the press.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (from conference) Also known as Marlon Frost. Released from California State Penitentiary where he served time for sexual assault. Mr. Marlon is also wanted in the questioning of the assault of an elderly woman in North Lake Tahoe one week ago. We believe he stole her vehicle and then fled to Las Vegas.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – GARAGE – DAY]</p>
<p>(Nick and Sara are in the garage with the elderly woman's vehicle.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Where'd Brass find it?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: A block away from the bar. Guy didn't even bother to switch plates.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Smart.</p>
<p>(Nick opens the trunk and looks at Sara. He snaps photos of the garbage bags in the back.) </p>
<p>(CUT TO: Nick and Sara open the garbage bags and find various articles inside.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Whoa. One, two ... three, four, five, six.. . ladies' handbags.</p>
<p>(He opens one and finds REBECCA MAYFORD's driver's license inside.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Rebecca Mayford. Becca.</p>
<p>(He finds nicotine gum.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mm. Looks like she was trying to quit smoking.</p>
<p>(He also finds a pack of cigarettes.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: And failing. Miserably.</p>
<p>(He opens the cigarette pack and checks it.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: There is only one missing.</p>
<p>(He puts the cigarettes aside and looks in the wallet. He finds a receipt.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Here we go. Bought at the Trip Wire Bar at 12:48 a.m. same night as the murders.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: That's where Marlon and Becca crossed paths.</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: [TRIP WIRE BAR – NIGHT] The bartender puts a pack of cigarettes on the bar for Becca. She smiles. Marlon sits at the other end of the bar and watches her.) </p>
<p><strong>Bartender</strong>: There you go.</p>
<p><strong>Becca</strong>: Appreciate it. Bye.</p>
<p>(She leaves the bar. Marlon watches her leave.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(Becca is walking home. Marlon follows her.) </p>
<p>(End of flash.)</p>
<p>(Sara continues to search through the clothes. She finds a gun.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I got a gun.</p>
<p>(Sara picks it up.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It's plastic. It's a toy.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Looks real to me. Imagine if you're petrified.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) – DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. CSI – ROOM – DAY]</p>
<p>(Sara is looking at photos of a baby. Corey Archfield sits at the table.) </p>
<p><strong>Corey Archfield</strong>: How'd you find me?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Cammie had these in her wallet. We tracked you from the birth certificate. She's a cutie. What's her name?</p>
<p><strong>Corey Archfield</strong>: Fin. After Cammie's grandmother. But her adoptive parents call her Annabelle.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: She kept in touch with them?</p>
<p><strong>Corey Archfield</strong>: They're pretty cool. We didn't have contact, but ... they would send Cammie a photo every year on Fin's birthday. And every year, Cammie and I would get together, have a beer, look at it. Biggest regret of my life is not marrying Cammie and raising Fin together. I wanted to, but ... she said we were too young. Maybe if we had ...</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (interrupts) Corey ... you can't blame yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Corey Archfield</strong>: Were you with her when she died?</p>
<p>(Sara nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Corey Archfield</strong>: At least Cammie died knowing kindness.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: Cammie struggles to breathe.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Stay with me, Cammie.</p>
<p><strong>Cammie</strong>: Bye ... Fin ...</p>
<p>(Cammie gasps and her eyes grow blank.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. HOSPITAL – MARLON'S ROOM – DAY]</p>
<p>(Marlon talks with Brass.) </p>
<p><strong>David Marlon</strong>: I watched the life go out of their eyes. Um, life drains. That's ... that's how you can tell they're dead. They have, uh, empty eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: That's not what I asked you. What I asked you was, why did you kill them?</p>
<p><strong>David Marlon</strong>: I saw this girl I liked at the bar.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: Becca smiling at the bartender at the bar. End of flash.) </p>
<p><strong>David Marlon</strong>: I followed her home. I knew she wanted to party. I chose her. Girls act ... sometimes like they don't want what they want ... because they want you to take it. They like that. But this girl ... she was flirting with me. </p>
<p>(Quick flash of: Becca smiling at the bartender at the bar. End of flash.) </p>
<p><strong>David Marlon</strong>: And I ... I just gave her the party of her life.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know, there's something I don't understand, Marlon. Why are you smiling? You feel good about this?</p>
<p><strong>David Marlon</strong>: I don't feel anything. Nothing.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – BREAKROOM – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The news report is on the monitor.) </p>
<p><strong>Reporter</strong>: (on TV) Las Vegas PD has confirmed that David Marlon confessed earlier today to the murders of the six Green Valley showgirls. </p>
<p>(Grissom and Sara watch the report.) </p>
<p><strong>Reporter</strong>: (on TV) He was found within a block of the crime scene in an apparent suicide attempt. I've just been informed ...</p>
<p>(The report continues in the background.) </p>
<p><strong>Reporter</strong>: (b.g. on TV) ... has confirmed the names of the six victims. They are Cammie ... Libby Cooperson 22, Becca Mayfield, 20 ...</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I held his hand.</p>
<p>(Sara is crying. She glances back at Grissom, who is standing just behind her.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Just like I held hers. I lost perspective.</p>
<p>(Grissom wipes the tear off her cheek. Sara turns and looks at Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Reporter</strong>: (b.g. on TV) ... Lauren Walderson 21 and Emily Wilson, 19. Their families have organized a candlelight vigil that will begin here tonight.</p>
<p>(He looks at her. She nods.)</p>

Sofia Curtis:  Stacy Vollmer was last seen practicing alone on the school tennis court that Friday at around 9:00 P.M.

 
Sofia Curtis:  The clothes she was wearing were found in her locker.
 
 
 
 



 
Sofia Curtis:  Her body was discovered near the football field by the landscaping crew the following Monday morning.
 


 
ADA Jeffrey Sinclair: Can you tell us the exact location of the body?
Sofia Curtis: She was dumped in a flower bed, wrapped in a shower curtain.


 
Sofia Curtis:  CSI arrived an hour later, excavated the body and began processing the scene.
 
ADA Jeffrey Sinclair:  Dr. Robbins, will you explain how Stacy died?
Robbins:  Beneath this laceration, ... 

 
Robbins: ... I found a complex fracture of the occipital bone. Multiple shards of bone were driven into the occipital lobe of the brain, resulting in massive bleeding. The cause of death was cerebral hemorrhage, consistent with a single, sharp blow to her head.
INSERT: CGI POV: 

 
END OF CGI POV: RESUME TO COURTROOM:

 
Nick: A search of the defendant's house yielded a laundry hamper containing the clothes he wore the night of the murder.
 
ADA Jeffrey Sinclair: Did you find any blood or DNA on the clothes?
Nick: No. We determined they had been bleached. 
ADA Jeffrey Sinclair: Isn't bleach used to destroy blood and DNA evidence?
Carol Allred : Objection: Argumentative.
ADA Jeffrey Sinclair: Withdrawn. What else did you find in the house?
Nick: Human hairs consistent with the victim -  -- were discovered in the drain of the bathroom sink. DNA was extracted and was also matched to the victim.
ADA Jeffrey Sinclair: And based on this evidence, police arrested Marlon West.
 
Nick: That's correct.
ADA Jeffrey Sinclair: Thank you, Mr. Stokes. No further questions.
 
ADA Jeffrey Sinclair: The state now calls Hannah West.
 
Carol Allred : Your honor, defense reiterates our objection. She's a
12-year-old girl.
Judge Crawford: We've been through this already, counsel.  Be nice.
 

 
ADA Jeffrey Sinclair: Now, Hannah, isn't it a fact that on the night of Friday, December 2, 2005, your parents left you and your brother, the defendant, home alone?
Hannah West: They went away for a ...
ADA Jeffrey Sinclair: Yes or no, please.
Hannah West: Yes.
ADA Jeffrey Sinclair: And isn't it also a fact that you and your brother were not together between the hours of 6:00 and 10:00 P.M.?
Hannah West: Well, Marlon -- he didn't really...
ADA Jeffrey Sinclair: Yes or no?
Hannah West: Yes.
ADA Jeffrey Sinclair: Thank you, Hannah.
Hannah West: I'd like to say something ...
ADA Jeffrey Sinclair: No further questions, your honor.
Judge Crawford: Cross-examination?
 
Carol Allred: Absolutely, your honor. Uh, Hannah, wh-what were you trying to say?
ADA Jeffrey Sinclair: Objection: Calls for a narrative.
Judge Crawford: Overruled.
Carol Allred: You go ahead, Hannah. You say what you need to say.
Hannah West: Marlon didn't kill Stacy. I did.

Judge Crawford: Ladies and gentlemen. Order in the court.
 
Hannah West: And I was wearing this when I did it.
 
 
Judge Crawford: Order in the court. Please - 
 
FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS



 
 
Conrad Ecklie: Good news is Judge Crawford denied the defense's motion to dismiss.
Nick: Of course he did. She's just a mixed-up kid trying to protect her older brother. All the evidence points to Marlon.
Conrad Ecklie: Yeah, and all the jury's going to remember is a little girl in a bloody shirt confessing to murder. That's reasonable doubt on a silver platter.
Nick: All right, then we have to prove that Hannah could not have done this.
Conrad Ecklie: Exactly.
Nick: We'll need a week to reexamine the evidence.
Conrad Ecklie: Judge gave the DA a 72-hour continuance.
Nick: Come on ...
Conrad Ecklie: Best he could do, Nick. Now you go do your best.
 

 
 

 
 
Marlon West:  Everybody thought Stacy was so ...

 
 
Marlon West: ... special. She thought so, too. She wasn't. Stacy was a stuck-up bitch and a miserable person. I just put her out of her misery.
 
Marlon West: I killed her and I put her in the ground. That's all I've got to say.
 

LEGEND:
68 HOURS TO TRIAL
 
Nick: The judge suppressed the video because the child advocate was never brought in, even though Marlon had waived his rights. We really didn't need a confession out of him. The case against this kid was solid.
INSERT: FLASHBACK

(Stacy Vollmer, a towel wrapped around her, passes by a string of OUT OF ORDER signs blocking the various shower stalls.
Nick:  It started out as a prank: A sabotaged showerhead.



 
Nick: pH tests later revealed the presence of a strong base substance, which was later identified as sodium hydroxide. 
Sara: Sounds like Marlon packed the showerhead with elemental sodium.
Nick: A high school chemistry favorite, yeah. Just add water, and instant kaboom.
Warrick: Those out-of-order signs must've been part of his game. You funnel the victim to the right showerhead. Did you process these?
Nick: Yeah, I matched the spindle marks on the paper to a laser printer in the high school library.
Sara: Accessible to any student.
Nick:  Mm-hmm.
Catherine:  &quot;Multiple fragments of metal penetrating skin and dermis as deep as the superficial musculature of the back and neck.&quot; The showerhead explosion didn't kill her.
Nick: No, no, it did not.
 
Catherine: What happened to the shower curtain?
Nick: Well, the vic was injured, disoriented. She grabbed the first thing she could to cover up and ran.
INSERT: FLASHBACK


 
Nick: The intermittent blood trail started in the locker room and headed down a hall.
 
END OF FLASHBACK - RESUME PRESENT
Warrick: So Marlon followed her out just to hear her squeal?
Nick: Or chased her out, yeah. There's no way to know. Either way, she ended up at the bottom of the stairs. The size of the blood pool indicates that the fatal wound occurred there.
 
Sara: Do you have any physical evidence that would conclusively rule Hannah out as a suspect?
Nick: Well, yeah -- she's four-foot-three and 65 pounds. The crime just required more strength than she's got.
Catherine: How old is she?
Nick: Twelve.
Warrick: In high school?
Nick: She's a high school senior. She skipped six grades. She's a prodigy.
Sara: Which means she has the brains for murder.
Nick: Yeah, but not the brawn. The body was moved from the high school building across a football field and then hastily buried. The vic's car was then driven two miles from campus and parked in front of the house of a kid named Scott Baird, Stacy's boyfriend -- I think possibly to frame him.
Warrick: Was he ever a suspect?
Nick: No. He plays varsity hoops. He was out of town on an away game.
 
Nick: I found blades of grass with blood on them near the vic's car -- nondescript tracks headed towards the next-door neighbor's house.
Catherine: Marlon West.
Nick: Yeah. This kid's been in trouble before. Multiple fights, threats. It just got out of hand this time. Marlon West killed Stacy Vollmer. His little sister's just trying to exonerate him.

 
 
 


 

 
 
Hodges: Hey, Nick.
 
Nick: Hodges, did you get the soil analysis back on Hannah's shirt?
Hodges: Matches the site of the body dump.
Nick: Really!
Hodges: So does this make Doogie Howser-ette your killer?
Nick: Uh, I kind of doubt it.
Hodges: Don't be so sure. It's not easy.
Nick: What isn't easy, Hodges?
Hodges:  Being profoundly gifted, knowing that everybody knows that you're always ten steps ahead of them. It's a lot of pressure.
 
Hodges: Some days you feel like you're just going to snap.
Nick:  I know the feeling.


 
LEGEND:
61 HOURS TO TRIAL
 
Sara: In his confession, Marlon basically said that Stacy deserved to die.
Sofia Curtis: He was alone in that opinion. Everybody liked Stacy -- parents and students. 4.0 GPA, varsity tennis team, homecoming queen. She even took a public virginity pledge with some of her classmates. Did they have those in your high school?
Sara: No. Do you believe that Marlon killed her?
Sofia Curtis: I was looking right into his eyes when he told me he did it. There's no doubt in my mind.
 

 
 
 
Sofia Curtis: Two confessions, one crime. We don't get that a lot. When did you last speak with Marlon?
Hannah West: The day the police came to my house and arrested him.
Sara: You don't visit him?
Hannah West: My parents won't let me see him in jail. Bad environment. Marlon didn't put me up to this. He was trying to protect me. It would've been wrong to let him be punished for something I did.
 
Hannah West: You don't think I could have done it. Neither one of you.
Sara: That's a big job for a little girl.
Hannah West: Not if you have the right tools.
Sara: Smart kid like you ... knows your brother's suffering. You feel bad, you want to help, so you fabricate some evidence.
Hannah West: If you thought that the evidence was fake, I wouldn't still be in jail.
 
Hannah West: Aren't you going to ask me why I did it?
Sara: Would you like to tell us?
Hannah West: I throw off the curve. When I'm in a class, people who usually get A's, suddenly get C's. Stacy was applying to Harvard. She wanted me to dumb myself down. I said no. She didn't like that.

Stacy Vollmer: Uh ... babies use the wall dryer.

Sofia Curtis: So you killed her because she messed up your hair?
Hannah West: No. I'm used to pranks like that. I get them most every day. But Stacy ... didn't stop there. She had to take it to another level. And she used Scott to do it. 
Sofia Curtis: Scott Baird, Stacy's boyfriend. 
Hannah West: I was his tutor.
INSERT: FLASHBACK

 
Scott Baird: You know, I was really pissed off at Stacy when I heard about the whole ... hair dryer thing, but her ... her friends had put her up to it. Stacy wanted me to give you something.

Hannah West: The pictures were up on my space that night. I got a ton of e-mails.
Sara: You put sodium in the showerhead to get back at her?
Hannah West:  A prank for a prank. I thought that there'd be a few sparks, that she'd freak out and that'd be it, but the nozzle exploded. Stacy ran ... and fell down the stairs ... and died. 
 
Hannah West: I tried to cover it up. 
Sara: You miscalculated.
 
Hannah West: I guess I did.




 
 
Warrick: You rang? 
Catherine: Got the DNA results on the blood from Hannah's sweater.
Warrick: Stacy.
Catherine: Hannah.
Warrick: So she fabricated evidence, and put her own blood on the shirt.
Catherine: Maybe, maybe not. The soil on the shirt was consistent with the dumpsite. Hannah could've been at the scene.
INSERT: FLASHBACK

 
Catherine:  She could have cut herself burying the body.

END OF FLASHBACK - RESUME PRESENT
Warrick: Or she could have gone back to the field at any time within the last four months and rubbed her shirt in the same kind of dirt.
Catherine: And counted on us to make the match? Well, that's just plain scary smart. I mean, my daughter's a few years older than her, and the most important thing on her mind right now is how much belly button to show off at the mall.
 
Catherine: Never thought I'd be grateful for that.

Jim West: Marlon's from my wife's first marriage.
Sally West: He's more like his father.
 

Nick: This is Marlon's room.
Sara: No kidding.
Nick: It's pretty much the way I left it. The bleached clothes were in the hamper.
 
Nick: But the real action ... was in here.
 

 
Sara: Shared bathroom. Very Brady.
Nick: Pulled Stacy's hairs out of the sink trap the first through. And I found some burn marks around the bathtub drain. pH tested positive for sodium hydroxide, so ... I figured Marlon probably did a test run.
 

 
 
 
 
Nick: The scope of the warrant only covered Marlon's room and other common areas of the house. I popped my head in here. Nothing in plain sight at the time.
 
Sara: Was this here before?
Nick: It wasn't in plain sight. I didn't check it.
 
Sara: Looks like Hannah won the science fair with a project about sodium.
 


 
Sally West: Hannah's just trying to help Marlon.
Sofia Curtis: So they're close?
Jim West: No, not really. Sometimes I think if they didn't share a bathroom, they wouldn't see each other at all.
Sofia Curtis: What do you mean?
Sally West: They're on different academic tracks. Never take any of the same classes, and travel in completely different social circles.
Sofia Curtis: From what we understand, Hannah doesn't really have a social circle.
Sally West:  The other students bore her. Hannah spends most of her time with her teachers.
Sofia Curtis: And Marlon?
 
Jim West: I guess ... I guess he spends most of his time alone.


 
 
 
Sara: &quot;Rainbow party&quot;?!
Nick: Yeah, it's a party game where boys get the girls to wear different colored lipsticks while they have oral s*x. Boy with the most colors wins. Supposed to be trendy.
Sara: So much for &quot;Spin the Bottle.&quot;
Nick: Carrie. &quot;Weird high school girl gets humiliated at the prom, only to exact her revenge.&quot; Hannah wanted us to find this.
Sara: Maybe. Question is: did she read the book before ... or after the murder?

 
Jim West: We had Hannah's IQ tested when she was eight. It's 177.
Sofia Curtis: She really is one in a million.
Jim West: Hannah's special.
Sally West: She's an indigo child.
Sofia Curtis: Indigo child?
Sally West: A new breed. Hannah doesn't just see the world, she sees through it, through people, with an intuition none of us can comprehend. She's compelled to help others, whether they're worth helping or not.

Nick: Yeah, I had Mandy run the unknowns from the original case against Hannah's prints. She got a match.
Catherine: Okay. But Hannah uses those showers after gym class.
Nick: This curtain was used in the handicapped shower. Why would she do that?
Catherine: Probably hiding her body. She's twelve. She hasn't reached puberty. Undeveloped teen girls are very self-conscious.

Sara: Do you think it's possible that Hannah could have stolen it?
Mr. Estrin: Hannah would never do that.
Sara: I'm just wondering if it's possible. She obviously has access to this room.
Mr. Estrin: Ms. Sidle ... I've had my share of good students over the years, but Hannah ... sometimes, right in the middle of a lecture, I'll catch her staring at some little thing in the yard -- a tree, a squirrel ... and all I can think about is how much I wish I could see it the way she does. If Hannah came up and asked me for a chunk of sodium, I'd give it to her, just to see what she would do with it.

Nick: You moved the body, you buried it ... 
Marlon West: I know I did; I was there. What's the problem?
Nick: Well, the problem is what happened in the locker room. I mean, you're not the kind of guy who puts sodium in a showerhead to get back at somebody. You just trip them in the hallway.
Marlon West: So you think I'm too stupid to have done it. Great, join the club.
Nick: I don't think you're stupid, Marlon; I didn't say you were stupid. But this is Hannah's game. The whole way.

Conrad Ecklie: Another trial? You sure you want to go through all this again?
 
DA Jeffrey Sinclair: Stacy's parents and the community will have my ass if I don't.
Sara: Well, then maybe this is good news. I was just going over Sofia's notes from the original investigation. The night of the murder, Hannah and Marlon's parents had left them alone in the house. A pizza was delivered to the residence around 9:00 P.M.
Nick: That's right around Stacy's TOD. 
DA Jeffrey Sinclair: So, did anybody talk to the delivery guy?
Sara: Yes, and at the point that Sofia did, a month had passed. Now, the delivery guy's at the house all the time. He recognized photos of both kids, but he could not be sure which one answered the door that night.
Nick: But one of them did answer the door.  So that means they were not together at the time Stacy was killed.
Conrad Ecklie: Yeah. So much for conspiracy. We're right back where we started.
DA Jeffrey Sinclair: Where we are is in the crapper. Look, I have to disclose the cart. Defense is going to eat me alive.

Carol Allred:  Access to sodium?! Marlon couldn't find sodium on a periodic table of the elements, let alone a locked supply closet.
 
Carol Allred:  Access to library printers? Do you really think a kid like Marlon spends any time in a library?
 
Carol Allred:  The showerhead. Yes, Marlon's tall enough. 
 
Carol Allred:  He could reach it, but he still would have had to have handled a volatile chemical with expert safety precautions in order to orchestrate an explosion.
 

 
Carol Allred: I mean, ladies and gentlemen, do you know how to do that? I don't know how to do that. Right? You'd have to be ... a genius. 
 
Carol Allred: Marlon? Not a genius. You know, one of the underpinnings of our justice system is that it is better to send a hundred guilty men free than to imprison even one who's innocent. Marlon West is an innocent man.

 
Carol Allred:  Reasonable doubt compels you to find him not guilty.
 
 
 
 
 

 
Judge Crawford: Thank you.
 
Bailiff: Defendant shall rise.
 
Judge Crawford: Madam Foreman, what is the jury's verdict?
Foreman: On the sole count of murder in the first degree, we, the jury, find the defendant, Marlon West ... not guilty.
 

Judge Crawford: So noted. Court orders the defendant released from custody. Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, thank you for your service. Court is adjourned.
 
 
 
 


 
 
Jim West: Can you sign this as well? 
 
Sarah: Hey, there.
Hannah West: Did you come to say bye?
Sara: No. Actually, you and I are going to be seeing a lot of each other. If you thought the DA wouldn't prosecute a twelve-year-old for murder, you were wrong. He wants justice for Stacy and her family.
Hannah West: Of course. He's a totally linear thinker. Most of you guys are. 
Sally West: Shame on you, Ms. Sidle. Come on, Hannah. You don't need to listen to this.
Hannah West: Mom, just give us a second.
 
Hannah West: You were saying?
 
Sara: Here.
 
Sara: Hannah, with your gifts, you could've done anything you wanted, and you picked murder. You can't take that back.
Hannah West: You're worried how I'm going turn out.
Sara: Of course I am. I know it seems like a really long time, but ... in five years, the Stacies of the world would've been behind you.
Hannah West: Let me guess. You were a smart kid in school. Maybe you feel we're a little bit alike.
Sara: There aren't many people like you.
Hannah West: That's what my parents always say, too. The last four months, all they cared about was the effect of the trial on me ... not Marlon. It's been that way ever since I was 14 months old and started spelling words with plastic letters. It's so unfair, and nobody ever sees it. He doesn't deserve to go to jail. If I get convicted, what's the worst-case scenario? I mean, I'll be out in five years with an undergraduate degree. There's no &quot;Son of Sam&quot; law in Nevada -- that was ruled unconstitutional -- so I'm free to write a book about all this.  The story'll be worth millions. Freaks are always good box office.
Sara: You're not a freak.
Hannah West:  When's the last time you had to sit down to be eye-level with a murder suspect who was standing up?
Sara: Hannah, you are smart.
Hannah West: So I've been told. 
Sara: But you're not smart enough to get away with murder.
Hannah West: I think I am. A lot of people are smart enough to get away with murder. You probably are, too. But you have to be really smart to make people think things happened that never did.
Sara: What do you mean, exactly?
Hannah West: Please don't worry about me. I'm going to be fine.
 
Hannah West:  I didn't kill Stacy. Marlon did.

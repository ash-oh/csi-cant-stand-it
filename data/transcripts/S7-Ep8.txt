<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Establish. We start in the city, then pull out to the suburban community.) </p>
<p>[INT. SINCLAIR RESIDENCE – KITCHEN -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Amanda Sinclair stares at the kitchen window at her own reflection. After a moment, she goes back to washing the dinner dishes. Her mind is elsewhere.) </p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[INT. CASE APARTMENT – BATHROOM – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Jill Case wipes the steam off the shower door with the palm of her hand. She opens and pushes the door open, grabs a towel and steps out of the shower stall as she wipes herself.)</p>
<p>(She walks over to the bathroom sink and picks up the wine glass on the counter. She drinks.)</p>
<p>[INT. SINCLAIR RESIDENCE – KITCHEN -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Amanda Sinclair drinks from her baby's sippy cup before she opens it and adds it to the dishes to wash.)</p>
<p>(Her son, Henry, runs into the kitchen and holds his arms up to her.) </p>
<p><strong>Henry Sinclair</strong>: Mommy, up. Up, Mommy, up.</p>
<p><strong>Amanda Sinclair</strong>: Not now, baby, Mommy's busy. Go find Daddy.</p>
<p>(Henry turns and runs out of the kitchen. Gary, Amanda's husband, steps out into the hallway and scoops Henry into his arms.) </p>
<p><strong>Gary Sinclair</strong>: Aah ...</p>
<p>(He enters the kitchen.) </p>
<p><strong>Gary Sinclair</strong>: Honey, I cannot find my navy suit.</p>
<p><strong>Amanda Sinclair</strong>: Oh, I'm sorry, shoot. I meant to get it this morning, but Henry was doing his ear-itchy thing, so I took him to Dr. Neilsen. I'll get it first thing tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>Gary Sinclair</strong>: Oh, I have an early meeting, sweetie.</p>
<p><strong>Amanda Sinclair</strong>: So go get it. </p>
<p><strong>Gary Sinclair</strong>: Oh ... all right.</p>
<p>(He tries to put Henry down on the floor, but Henry complains.) </p>
<p><strong>Henry Sinclair</strong>: Daddy, no leave. Daddy, no leave.</p>
<p><strong>Gary Sinclair</strong>: Aw ... Daddy no leave.</p>
<p>(Henry giggles.) </p>
<p><strong>Amanda Sinclair</strong>: You give him a bath, I'll go.</p>
<p>(She looks at her watch – its 7:45.) </p>
<p>[INT. CASE APARTMENT – BATHROOM – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Jill Case adjusts her watch. Her radio is on.) </p>
<p><strong>Disk Jockey</strong>: (from radio) Welcome to LVRP, Rat Pack Radio. Here's an oldie but a goodie by two salty dogs of stage and screen, Bobby Darin and Johnny Mercer.</p>
<p>(She sings along with the radio.) </p>
<p><strong>Lyric</strong>: (singing) Two of a kind / For your information, we're two of a kind ...</p>
<p>[INT. AMANDA'S CAR – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Amanda backs out of her driveway. She sings along with the radio.) </p>
<p><strong>Lyric</strong>: (singing) Like peas in a pod and birds of a feather, alone or together you'll find that we are two-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo of a kind.</p>
<p>(She puts her hair up in a ponytail with a scrunchie.) </p>
<p>[INT. CASE APARTMENT – BATHROOM – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Jill puts her hair down.)</p>
<p><strong>Lyric</strong>: (singing) Now, who's to say if we're going the whole way? At least we got this far.</p>
<p>[INT. CASE APARTMENT – LIVING ROOM – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The television set is on to channel 19 with BREAKING NEWS coverage. The volume is off.</p>
<p><strong>Lyric</strong>: (singing) Sharin' our lives, our vittles, and viands, we're two of an ilk. Say, what if we've got rare Chateaubriands or crackers and milk? Makin' it plain. Explainin' it fully. We're similarly inclined, -- </p>
<p>(Jill is in her black slip and secures her thigh stockings. She gets up and pulls her black dress out of the plastic covering. She tosses the hanger on the bed. The advert on the hanger is for CHEN'S ONE HOUR CLEANERS.) </p>
<p><strong>Lyric</strong>: (singing) Because we're -- </p>
<p>[EXT. CHEN'S ONE HOUR CLEANERS – NIGHT]</p>
<p><strong>Lyric</strong>: (singing) – two-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo of a kind.</p>
<p>(Amanda pulls into the lot and parks her car. She gets out of the car and opens the back door. She gathers the laundry and notices a lipstick print on her husband's white shirt collar. She smiles.)</p>
<p>[INT. CASE APARTMENT – LIVING ROOM – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Jill Case blots her lipstick. She does a last look-over in the mirror, then heads out of her apartment. The door slams shut behind her.) </p>
<p>[EXT. CHEN'S ONE HOUR CLEANERS – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Amanda Sinclair closes the car door and activates the car alarm. She turns toward the cleaners. Two gunshots fire and hit her square in the chest.) </p>
<p>[CU: SHOES]</p>
<p>(A pair of black high-heeled shoes hit the ground.)</p>
<p>[AMANDA]</p>
<p>(Amanda falls backward and hits the concrete ground. Her eyes dilate.) </p>
<p>[JILL]</p>
<p>(Jill's eyes are clouded over as she hangs from a dog leash, her feet bare and shoes on the floor.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. CHEN'S ONE HOUR CLEANERS – PARKING LOT -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Police radio chatter is in the background. A flashlight shines on Amanda Sinclair, dead on the pavement.) </p>
<p>(Catherine and Nick walk up to the body.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (sighs) Bad day when you can't even run a simple errand.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Everybody's got dirty laundry. Sometimes it gets you killed.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CASE APARTMENT – LIVING ROOM – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Warrick and Grissom walk into the apartment and find Jill Case hanging in the middle of the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What would she have done if she didn't have a second story?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Every death has at least two stories.</p>

<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[INT. CASE APARTMENT – LIVING ROOM – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The coroners cut the body down and place it on the gurney. They cover her face with a white sheet.) </p>
<p>[EXT. CHEN'S ONE HOUR CLEANERS – PARKING LOT -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(David covers Amanda Sinclair with a white sheet. He turns and talks with Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Two GSWs to the chest. Rigor hasn't set. Probably been dead less than four hours.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Thanks, David.</p>
<p>(David leaves. Catherine looks at the blood on the concrete. Nick walks up to her.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mr. Chen works here alone with his wife, and English is not their first language. I'm not even real sure that it's their second, but what I did gather is that the steam machines are very noisy, so neither one of them really heard anything. Mr. Chen found the body when he was closing up around 9:00. Said she's a regular customer.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, I got a phone and keys, but no purse.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mugging?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Take the purse, leave the Lexus?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, that's not real savvy, is it?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hmm. Car's been keyed. </p>
<p>(She opens the front door, climbs inside and checks the registration. It's for:<br />
DR. GARY SINCLAIR<br />
143 SHADY OAK LANE<br />
LAS VEGAS, NV 89101</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Registered to a Dr. Gary Sinclair.</p>
<p>(Nick is looking at Amanda's cell phone record of missed calls.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, that's gonna probably be the husband. &quot;Gary Home&quot; has called her six times in the last hour.</p>
<p>(Catherine looks at the clothes and car seat in the back.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Wife and mother.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I'll check the trashcans for the complex, see if I can find her purse. Maybe they dumped what they couldn't liquidate.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CASE APARTMENT – LIVING ROOM – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Warrick looks around the living room.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, she obviously doesn't have any kids. Place is like a museum. This chick hung out with some big wigs.</p>
<p>(He looks at framed photos of Jill with some famous political people.) </p>
<p>(Grissom is in the kitchen looking at the LAS VEGAS GLOBE and NEVADA Driver's License.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: She was a big wig. Jill Case, Editor-in-Chief of the Las Vegas Globe. She was a wunderkind. One of the youngest women in history to run a newspaper.</p>
<p>(Brass walks into the kitchen.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, I've been all around the house, --no sign of a forced entry.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Consistent with suicide.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So is this.</p>
<p>(Warrick shows them the hand-written note: &quot;I apologize to everyone.&quot;)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You can't even use a whole sheet of paper on your suicide note?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, I don't know. Maybe if you feel like you don't deserve to take up space on the planet, you don't deserve a whole piece of paper.</p>
<p>(Warrick snaps photos of the note under a foiled doggie bag in the shape of a swan.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: She obviously ate at Joie de Vive. It's the only place that still serves old school swan doggie bags.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, dressed in a fancy outfit, having a fancy meal.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: If you're planning on killing yourself, why do you bring home a doggie bag?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (shrugs) It's human nature. We continue to perform the routine motions of our life until the moment of our death.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. CHERI'S ONE HOUR CLEANERS – PARKING LOT -- DAY]</p>
<p>(Nick goes through the trash on the side of the building.) </p>
<p>(He goes through the smaller bins, then heads over to the large garbage bin. He looks inside and finds the purse under a garbage bag.) </p>
<p>(He snaps a couple of photos.)</p>
<p>(Nick dives into the bin and pulls out the bag. On the bag is a stocking.)</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: The killer wears a stocking over his face. End flash.)</p>
<p>(Nick takes out the wallet and looks at the driver's license inside:<br />
AMANDA SINCLAIR<br />
143 SHADY OAK LANE<br />
LAS VEGAS, NV 89101</p>
<p>(He takes out a datebook and finds an envelope. Inside the envelope, he finds a hand-written note, &quot;Please do not ever contact me again. Sincerely, Dora.&quot;)</p>

<p>(On the next table is another body with another TOE TAG for JILL CASE.)</p>
<p>(The two women are side-by-side on two tables in the room.)</p>
<p>(The door opens. Catherine, Warrick and Robbins walk in.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: DNA's been sent out, but this is one case where I don't need to wait for results.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Identical twins? You got to be kidding me.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: They're even wearing the same toenail polish.</p>
<p>(He hands Warrick the evidence bags.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: And both ... wore the same watch, too.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Oh, it's just too much.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well ... eight-year-olds dressing alike I kind of get, but grown women? That's weird.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Some people like it. I'm a twin.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Well, I was. My twin died in utero. My mother didn't tell me about it until I was an adult. When I decided to become a coroner, she blamed herself. She said it was because I'd spent so many days living next to a dead body.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, speaking of dead bodies, uh ...</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Right. Right. Jill has petechia around the eyes, bruising around the neck, and a broken clavicle. All consistent with a hanging. And I extracted these from Amanda.</p>
<p>(He shows them the two bullets.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: One went straight to the heart. The other penetrated the right lung. Sharp shooter or close range.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Don't tell me they died at the same moment.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Not quite. Amanda was a couple hours ahead of her sister.</p>

[INT. CSI – GRISSOM'S OFFICE – DAY]</p>
<p>(Grissom is reading a letter from: </p>
<p>WILLIAMS COLLEGE OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATION<br />
450 CASTLE AVENUE, 3RD FLOOR<br />
WILLIAMSTOWN, MA 01265</p>
<p>NOVEMBER 9, 2006</p>
<p>DEAR MR. GRISSOM, As an accomplished entomologist in the field-- invite you to join us for an interdisciplinary-- </p>
<p>VARIOUS CU OF THE LETTER WITH FOCUS ON:</p>
<p>* &quot;interdisciplinary&quot;<br />
* &quot;Walden Pond&quot;<br />
* &quot;term graduate seminar&quot;<br />
* &quot;specialists&quot;<br />
* &quot;entomology,&quot;<br />
* &quot;consider taking&quot;<br />
* &quot;sabbatical&quot;</p>
<p>(Catherine knocks on the door before walking in. Grissom looks up and puts the letter away.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Our two cases have become one.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Could still be two cases.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What happened to Mr. No-Such-Thing-As-Coincidence? Simplest hypothesis is usually the correct one. If you hear hooves, think horses not zebras.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What would the horses be in this case?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Murder/suicide. Jill killed Amanda. Felt guilty, then killed herself.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And, uh, what do you got to support that?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Did you notice any photos of Amanda or her family in Jill's house?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Right. And I looked through Amanda's phone book. Jill was not even in it. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, maybe she had her number memorized.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Brass spoke with Jill's attorney for next of kin. None existed. She's leaving a small fortune to various charities. It just sounds to me like estrangement. Okay, even if that's not the exact way it went down, I'll bet you a dollar that the twins' deaths are related.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Two women found dead on opposite sides of town. If they didn't look alike, would you still link them?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: If they're relatives, yes: sisters, husband and wife, father and son.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay, what?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'll take the bet.</p>

<p>(Sofia sits down.) </p>
<p><strong>Gary Sinclair</strong>: Jill who?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Her twin sister, Jill Case.</p>
<p><strong>Gary Sinclair</strong>: Amanda didn't have a sister.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: DNA tells us otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Gary Sinclair</strong>: My wife was an only child. Sh-she was adopted, but ... </p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Is it possible that ... your wife knew she had a twin, but she hadn't told you?</p>

<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: True?</p>
<p><strong>Gary Sinclair</strong>: A marriage. Married, Detective?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: No.</p>

Every night I drive home from the hospital and I think of twelve things I want to tell Amanda. And then I get home and, uh ... she's cooking. And we read stories to Henry and then ... the phone rings, so I -- you know, you say, &quot;Oh, I'll just tell her tomorrow. Tomorrow.&quot; I'd like to meet her. Jill.</p>

<p>(Dora opens the gate and leads her horse through it. Sofia and Nick follow her.) </p>

<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: We were just curious about the circumstances under which they were adopted.</p>
<p>(She tethers her horse.) </p>
<p><strong>Dora Pomerantz</strong>: I was eighteen years old when I got pregnant. Charlie said he'd stay with me. Then he got drafted to Vietnam. Came home six months later ... in a box. These two chirping birds. &quot;Waa, waa, waa.&quot; I couldn't get them to stop. I couldn't take it. So one day I just ... Boop ... snapped. That was it. No more babies. I spent ten years in a state facility, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: We were aware. How have you been since?</p>
<p><strong>Dora Pomerantz</strong>: Oh ... fine. A smart doctor put me in touch with an equine assisted therapy program. Saved my life. Horses don't have judgments. They have needs. Meet the needs, the horse is happy. Helped retrain my brain. </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Healthy enough to get back in touch with your daughters?</p>
<p><strong>Dora Pomerantz</strong>: Oh, no. Uh ... not recommended. Sometimes you just can't go back.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Is that why you wrote Amanda this letter saying, &quot;Please do not ever contact me again?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Dora Pomerantz</strong>: Who's Amanda?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: One of your daughters.</p>
<p><strong>Dora Pomerantz</strong>: We keep envelopes loose in a desk drawer. I must've touched it before she sent it.</p>

<p><strong>Tiffany Hughes</strong>: Yeah. My dad and I have a system. We screen all her mail.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Why's that?</p>
<p><strong>Tiffany Hughes</strong>: She's got this problem. Any time a children's charity solicitation comes, she donates and not just a little. Half my college fund was gone before we realized what was going on.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: So you thought Amanda had her hand out?</p>
<p><strong>Tiffany Hughes</strong>: Wasn't worth the risk. The anti-depressants and the horses help, but my mom's barely hanging on. And I only have a year left before I go to college. I just need her to hang on one more year. So, I sent the polite response and hoped it was over.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, based on the contents of her purse, she's more the lip balm type.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: They don't put victim's DNA in the database.</p>
<p><strong>Wendy Simms</strong>: No, they don't. Yeah, I had to know, so I called a friend of mine at L.A. Sheriff's Department, and apparently, Natal was a nurse at a Hollywood hospital. And she went to the annual Christmas party, she fed this doctor a bunch of cocktails, slipped him a Prevalis, and then took him up to a hotel room. And rumor has it, it was in order to have unprotected, you know ... baby-making s*x. So he pressed charges, she was arrested, and then they settled out of court.

<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Okay. So what?</p>
<p>(Archie puts a series of photos up on screen.) </p>
<p><strong>Archie</strong>: These are Jake Lenoir's photographs taken in Iraq last summer. Watch this.</p>
<p>(He puts components of the photos together to make the winning photo.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: The front-page news was actually a composite?</p>
<p><strong>Archie</strong>: Well, it's a ... essentially an art project.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: And Jill printed it. I assume she didn't realize it until it was too late. And before she died, she was trying to figure out how to handle it.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: The only thing standing between Jake and the rest of his career was the truth.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: And Jill Case.</p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – BRASS' OFFICE] </p>
<p>(Brass holds a printout of the photo and talks with Jake Lenoir.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Got a job that takes you around the world, get to meet some great girls, even win some awards. So why would an adrenaline junkie like you waste his time with Photoshopping?</p>
<p><strong>Jake Lenoir</strong>: Let me tell you something that the, um ... newspapers, TV stations don't want to hear. There's nothing over there to photograph. Insurgents? They fire off their outdated weapons, then run the other way. When we do midnight raids in the villages, you know what the people tell us? &quot;Ali Baba not here.&quot; We are fighting a fictional character. And you got thousands of soldiers over there, kids, 18 years old, pumped up on testosterone, full of nicotine, and caffeine, waiting for something to bloody well happen. And you know what? You pray for a roadside bomb because it feels like action. But you can't photograph the taste of gasoline. It just looks like smoke. So one day, yeah, I'm screwing around on my computer. Couple of soldiers come by, took a look at what I'm doing. You know what they say? They say, &quot;Yeah, yeah, that's our war. That's what it's like waiting and bodyhauling.&quot; So I had it. I had the image that said it all. So yes, I used a lie to tell the truth.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, thanks for the insight. But I'm looking for another kind of confession. I'm here to bust you for the murder of Jill Case.</p>
<p><strong>Jake Lenoir</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Come on, she was hip to your, uh, you know cut-and-paste scheme and she was going to blow the whistle on you.</p>
<p><strong>Jake Lenoir</strong>: Yeah, yeah, yeah, well, I heard she committed suicide and look --</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, is that what you heard?</p>
<p><strong>Jake Lenoir</strong>: Yeah. Me and her, we-we had a history, okay. We dated. But if she felt like outing me for this all I had to do was accuse her of sexual harassment and we both go down.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Maybe ethical journalism was worth the price for her.</p>
<p><strong>Jake Lenoir</strong>: Doubtful. Without her job, she had nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, for a while, she had you.</p>
<p><strong>Jake Lenoir</strong>: Yeah, but not for long. Bird was rigid in everything she did. Having s*x with her was like ... eating glass.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The lab did a DNA test. Your skin cells are all over the dog leash that was used to hang her.</p>
<p><strong>Jake Lenoir</strong>: Well, I was probably the last person to actually walk that dog. God knows she never did.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. LENOIR APARTMENT – DAY]</p>
<p>(Greg and Warrick enter the apartment and look around.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Guess this is more like his crash pad between foreign assignments.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'm sorry, I just don't see Miss Neat Knickers and this guy making it as a couple, you know.</p>
<p>(They look around. Warrick looks in the satchel.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Still no laptop.</p>
<p>(Greg finds an empty software box in the trash.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Steal it, scrub it and lose it.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: This guy's smart. This is all just circumstantial.</p>
<p>(Warrick finds a note pad with some writing on it. </p>
<p>&quot;On behalf of the Las Vegas Globe, I apologize for the mistakes I made.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I apologize to the readers of this paper.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;My deepest apologies&quot; )</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Now we know how he got her to write the suicide note. She wasn't sorry to be living. She was sorry that Jake was such a liar.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, this is more like what we need.</p>
<p>(Greg puts the pad down and looks around the area. He finds a vent with a blue stocking on it.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Hey, Warrick. Didn't Nick's case have a blue thigh high stocking?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(Greg checks the dryer and takes out a shirt.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Even if he was the one that strangled Jill, there was no blood at the crime scene.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, with two gunshots to the chest, Jill's twin sister was a bloody mess.</p>
<p>(Greg tests the shirt for blood. It tests positive.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Checkmate?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So he killed them both.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – INTERVIEW ROOM]</p>
<p>(Brass talks with Jake Lenoir.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You must have thought you were losing your mind? Let me run it for you.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: Amanda pulls into Chen's parking lot. Jake is waiting for her, thinking it's Jill.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (V.O.) Jill always picked up her dry cleaning on Thursday nights. So right place, right time, right car, looks like the right woman.</p>
<p>(He puts the stocking on, walks up to her and shoots her twice in the chest.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (V.O.) You thought it was done. So you go to the house, get the computer files and you think you're seeing your conscious walk through the door.</p>
<p>(Jake is inside Jill's apartment when Jill comes home. She goes to her computer, turns around and sees Jake in the house. He is surprised to see her and reaches out to touch her arm.) </p>
<p><strong>Jill Case</strong>: Don't touch me!</p>
<p>(She fights him and he chokes her. She falls to the floor, dead.) </p>
<p>(He carries her up the stairs to the second floor.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (V.O.) The first time you had a plan. Try to make it look like a mugging. The second time, you had to improvise.</p>
<p>(Jake secures the leash around Jill's neck and tosses her off the second floor balcony.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Jake Lenoir</strong>: So there were two of them. I dated Jill. She kept the most rigid schedule of anyone I've ever met, you know. It was always Thursday night pick up the dry cleaning night. And I mean, God forbid I wanted to see a movie or catch a show or something. Leave it to Jill to be so thorough. Makes me have to kill her twice.</p>
<p>(Brass stands up and leaves the room.) </p>
<p>[OBSERVATION ROOM] </p>
<p>(Catherine and Grissom are watching Jake in the interview room. Catherine rips the bill in half and offers it to Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We were both right.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's a federal offense, you know.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – GRISSOM'S OFFICE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Grissom is reading &quot;Walden&quot; when Sara walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I heard the guys solved a double murder.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I spent the day sitting on a bench outside the courtroom; they never got to me.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That sucks.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Feeling transcendental?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Thoreau. I, uh, I haven't read him since college.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Me, neither. It holds up. &quot;I would rather sit on a pumpkin and have it all to myself, than be crowded on a velvet cushion.&quot;</p>
<p>(Sara turns and picks up the clipboard with the crossword puzzle on it.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Oh, look, you missed one. Sixty-three down. &quot;Misanthrope.&quot; </p>
<p>(Grissom looks at her. She puts the clipboard down.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I won't wait up.</p>
<p>(She turns and leaves the room. Grissom closes the book.) </p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>
<p><strong>End</strong></p>

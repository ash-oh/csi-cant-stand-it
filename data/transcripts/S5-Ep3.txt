							<p>COLD OPEN:</p>
<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[EXT. ST. ANDREW'S SCHOOL - DAY]</p>
<p>(Open on the statue of St. Andrew. The school bell rings marking the end of the day.)</p>
<p>[FRONT DOOR]</p>
<p>(Slow motion. The double doors to the school open and children run out of the school, whooping and cheering that school is over.)</p>
<p>(Resume motion. School boys and school girls walk along the front of the school.)</p>
<p>(A car horn honks.)</p>
<p>(Sister Teresa, talking with another Nun, looks up at the source of the blaring car horn.)</p>
<p><strong>Sister Teresa</strong>: Could you excuse me?</p>
<p>(Sister Teresa walks over to the parked car on the side of the road. Inside the car, Sybil Perez waits impatiently for her daughter.)</p>
<p>(Sister Teresa knocks on the passenger-side window. Sybil rolls the window down.) </p>
<p><strong>Sister Teresa</strong>: Everything all right, Sybil?</p>
<p><strong>Sybil Perez</strong>: I'm fine. What's taking Alicia so long? We have a doctor's appointment in forty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Sister Teresa</strong>: She's not here.</p>
<p><strong>Sybil Perez</strong>: Well, she has to be. I saw her leave for school this morning.</p>
<p><strong>Sister Teresa</strong>: Alicia hasn't been in any of her classes.</p>
<p>(Sybil's phone rings. She answers it.)</p>
<p><strong>Sybil Perez</strong>: (to phone) April, get off the phone. I can't talk right now.</p>
<p><strong>April Perez</strong>: (from phone) Somebody took Alicia.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - PARKING LOT - DAY]</p>
<p>(Sybil Perez parks in the parking lot. She gets out of the car and rushes over to her daughter.)</p>
<p><strong>Sybil Perez</strong>: What did you do?! (yells) What the hell did you do?!</p>
<p>(April turns from the Officer toward her mom.) </p>
<p><strong>April Perez</strong>: Mom, I don't know ...</p>
<p>(Sybil slaps April hard across the face.) </p>
<p><strong>Sybil Perez</strong>: Where is she?!</p>
<p><strong>April Perez</strong>: I'm not sure.</p>
<p>(Two officers keep the two women apart.) </p>
<p><strong>Sybil Perez</strong>: (screams) Where is she?!</p>
<p>(Sybil Perez fights the officer, pounding on his chest with her fists and screaming.)</p>
<p><strong>Sybil Perez</strong>: Get off of me! SYBIL PEREZ: Go find my daughter! Go find my daughter!</p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
[EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - PARKING LOT - DAY -- LATER]</p>
<p>(Brass interviews April Perez.) </p>
<p><strong>April Perez</strong>: I really didn't see Alicia all that much. Um, I don't get to. Her life sucks, so sometimes she would just, you know, play hooky and spend the day with me.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: After girls' day out, you, uh, stopped here for a snack.</p>
<p>(Off screen, we hear Sybil crying. Brass turns around at the sounds of sobbing. As he watches, Carlos Perez walks up and hugs Sybil.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Is that your father?</p>
<p><strong>April Perez</strong>: Yeah. Um ... I was just went in, and ... you know, to get something while she changed back into her uniform.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: In the car?</p>
<p><strong>April Perez</strong>: It's not that big of a deal. It's like, you know, the skirt over the jeans, and back to school before mom knows anything.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So what did he look like? What kind of car did he drive?</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: [EARLIER] April runs out of the convenience store.)</p>
<p><strong>April Perez</strong>: Alicia!</p>
<p>(She sees Alicia in the passenger seat of a black car. The car is driving out of the parking lot.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>April Perez</strong>: A black guy, uh ... He had a beard and he had a crappy black Buick. But, um ... I don't know, maybe it was blue.</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: [EARLIER] April is in the car looking out the window and screaming. The car drives away.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>April Perez</strong>: I don't really ...</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No, that's ... that's good. </p>
<p><strong>April Perez</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You did good. That's good. Thank you. </p>
<p><strong>April Perez</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(Cut to: A police siren blurbs off and on. Grissom leans forward looking into April's red car through the window. He snaps a photo.) </p>
<p>(Carols and Sybil Perez walk up to Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Carlos Perez</strong>: The cops won't tell us. What are the chances of finding our daughter?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, we're doing everything we can.</p>
<p><strong>Carlos Perez</strong>: That's what everyone keeps saying. No one will tell us anything.</p>
<p>(Grissom sees something.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did you injure yourself, Mrs. Perez?</p>
<p>(On the edge of her blouse is a large blood stain.)</p>
<p><strong>Sybil Perez</strong>: Oh, a nosebleed.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's a lot of blood. I'm going to need to take your shirt.</p>
<p><strong>Carlos Perez</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: If you like, I can have someone follow you home so that you can change.</p>
<p><strong>Sybil Perez</strong>: (getting angry) You think we had something to do with it? Our daughter is missing. She's out there somewhere alone and scared. What are you doing about that?!</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm just collecting evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Sybil Perez</strong>: Fine. Here! </p>
<p>(She removes her shirt and throws it at Grissom.)</p>
<p><strong>Sybil Perez</strong>: Take it! Go find her!</p>

<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS SCENES (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - PARKING LOT -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Brass is calling in the alert.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: This is Captain Jim Brass. I want to issue a Missing Persons Emergency Alert Amber. Notify all radio and casino signatories. The description is as follows ...</p>
<p>[DISPATCH]</p>
<p>(Dispatch types in the Alert.)</p>
<p>[TELEVISION SET]</p>
<p>(Programs are interrupted as BREAKING NEWS is reported.)</p>
<p><strong>News Anchorman</strong>: We have breaking news from the channel 8 newsroom right now. An Amber Alert has been issued for missing 13-year-old Alicia Perez.</p>
<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS HIGHWAYS (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p><strong>News Anchorman</strong>: (V.O.) The suspect in Alicia's abduction is described as an African American man, 35 to 45 years old, about six feet tall.</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS HIGHWAYS (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>(The highway sign on the side of the road flashes:<br />

NEV LIC. -----CA</p>
<p>[EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - PARKING LOT - DAY]</p>
<p>(Warrick and Nick are going through April's red car.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: How'd you shoot, man?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Rusty. They say I have a flinch.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You and I need to go practice some, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, when do we have time to do that?</p>
<p>(Nick dusts the door for prints.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: If we're not processing a scene or working evidence, we're in court. </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, when they take your piece, you'll make time.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: This girl seemed a little old to be lured by a lost puppy. So how'd this guy pull this off in a lot this public?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Easy. With a map and a smile.</p>
<p>(Over by the front of the convenience store, Warrick watches as Catherine measures the distance.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Rolls up -- &quot;Hey, little girl, I'm lost. You from around here?&quot;<br />
(Nick nods.) She gets close enough he pulls her out of her sister's car, into his car ... Bam, she's done.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I bet he had a weapon. Threatened her, so he could drive.</p>
<p>(Catherine continues to measure the distance into the parking lot toward the car.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Probably used his fists. b*st*rd had to have hit her.</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: [EARLIER] Alicia screams. The blurred figure pulls her into the car and hits her as she kicks and screams.)</p>
<p>(The car door slams shut.)</p>
<p>(End of flash. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>[INT. CONVENIENCE STORE - DAY]</p>
<p>(Brass interviews the Convenience Store Clerk as he carries a box of drinks.) </p>
<p><strong>Clerk</strong>: Look, dude, I didn't see it.</p>
<p>(The Clerk puts the box down on the side.) </p>
<p><strong>Clerk</strong>: Chica had a nice, round ass and that's what I was scoping.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What time was that?</p>
<p><strong>Clerk</strong>: About three. She comes in, grabs some candy, looks outside, waves at somebody. The next thing I know, she flips her wig. She's screaming about her sister. I didn't see the girl or a car. Besides, there's a lot of traffic out there.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Was it busy?</p>
<p><strong>Clerk</strong>: Kind of.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: How many surveillance cameras do you have in here?</p>
<p><strong>Clerk</strong>: Inside we got five. They're all state-of-the-art. Place gets hit a lot. Outside they're all dummies.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, I'm glad to see you're so concerned about your customers after they leave the store.</p>
<p>[EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE - PARKING LOT - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Catherine's phone rings. She answers it and her side of the conversation fades into the background.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to phone) Hello.</p>
<p>(Camera follows Grissom as he walks out of the convenience store.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to phone) (o.s.) Who's calling? Yes. Uh, yes. Speaking.</p>
<p>(Grissom heads toward Nick.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Nick, you failed firearms qualification. You can't be here.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Oh, yeah. Well, I'm taking it again day after tomorrow, so I figured I could work.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Not in the field.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You're serious?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You're in violation just carrying the weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to phone) (o.s.) She's what? Uh - uhm ... </p>
<p>(Nick turns and looks at Warrick. Warrick looks away.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Copy that. I'll be in the lab.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Uh, Nick, let me catch a lift with you. (to Grissom) There's something going on with Lindsay.</p>
<p>(Catherine follows Nick back to his car.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - WAITING ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Catherine walks up to the Officer watching Lindsay.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm Catherine Willows. What's the trouble?</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: With the Amber Alert, we've been keeping an eye out. Found your daughter up on Boulder Highway trying to hitch a ride downtown. (Catherine glares at Lindsay who rolls her eyes at her mom.) Now, kids this age, they need a firm hand at home, and ... </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (interrupts) Thank you, Officer. I appreciate everything you've done. Let's go.</p>
<p>(Catherine leads Lindsay away.) </p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Catherine and Lindsay go into an empty room. They both sit down.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay, what or who is on Fremont Street that you would risk your life to get to? Mouthing off to teachers, slipping grades and now hitchhiking. I mean, what is next, Lindsay?</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Willows</strong>: (mutters) Stripping.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What did you just say? (exasperated chuckle) Okay, no phone, no friends, no nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Willows</strong>: For how long?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: A month.</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Willows</strong>: (rolls her eyes) Whatever.</p>
<p>(Lindsay gets up.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, you want to make it two?</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Willows</strong>: Dad always said you were a drama queen.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, what do you expect, Lindsay, since he was always high.</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Willows</strong>: I'd take dad high over you any day! Nana's coming to pick me up. I'll be out front.</p>
<p>(Lindsay grabs her backpack and leaves the room.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Greg and Mia Dickerson, the new DNA Technician, walk into the lab. Warrick is sitting at the table with an array of items on it.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: You paged.</p>
<p>(He doesn't look up.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah. (Points to the items on the table.) What's missing?</p>
<p>(Greg takes a moment and looks at the various school books and bags on the table.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I give up.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Her sister said the victim changed back into her school uniform in the car. </p>
<p><strong>Mia Dickerson</strong>: So? Where are the clothes she changed out of? </p>
<p>(At the sound of a new voce, Warrick looks up.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p>(Greg makes the introductions.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Mia Dickerson, Warrick Brown.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Welcome.</p>
<p><strong>Mia Dickerson</strong>: Look, I already know you have a running bet with another CSI over how long the new hire lasts, so let's skip it. You got something for DNA?</p>
<p>(Warrick grabs the evidence bag and tosses it toward her.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: The mother's bloody t-shirt.</p>
<p><strong>Mia Dickerson</strong>: Exemplar?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It's on its way.</p>
<p><strong>Mia Dickerson</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>(Mia leaves the room. Warrick watches her. He looks sufficiently impressed. Greg turns and looks at Warrick.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (smiles) Just hedging my bets.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: How so?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, I need field experience, but before I get that, I need to find a replacement. So far, I'm oh-for-one. Plus, she's hot and thinks you're a tool, so I'm way ahead.</p>
<p>(Greg turns and leaves Warrick chuckling.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. PEREZ RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Camera slowly pans across the counter of framed photos. Every photo is of a little boy in various stages of growth. There is one photo with April in it standing next to the little boy, but none of Alicia that we can see.) </p>
<p>(In the living room, Brass interviews Carlos and Sybil Perez.) </p>
<p><strong>Carlos Perez</strong>: A gardener and a pool man come in once a week.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: How long have they worked for you?</p>
<p><strong>Carlos Perez</strong>: Years.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: How about a housekeeper or a maid?</p>
<p><strong>Sybil Perez</strong>: I do it.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Let's talk about your daughter's routines. Her routes to and from school, any extra-curricular activities, a list of friends. </p>
<p><strong>Sybil Perez</strong>: There wasn't any after school stuff. Alicia isn't a joiner. She walks to school, I pick her up. That's it.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: How often did April get her sister to skip school?</p>
<p>(They look at each other.) </p>
<p><strong>Carlos Perez</strong>: We don't know. We ... we just found out ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'm curious because April said she hardly ever gets to see Alicia. Why didn't she just come here?</p>
<p><strong>Sybil Perez</strong>: Because she wasn't welcome. We kicked her out. </p>
<p><strong>Carlos Perez</strong>: April's a troubled girl. Problems with drugs, the police. You might as well know, she also did some time. Juvenile lockup.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>Carlos Perez</strong>: Heroin possession. Intent to distribute.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. PEREZ RESIDENCE - ALICIA'S BEDROOM - DAY -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(Sara sits at Alicia's desk looking at the contents on her computer. Grissom examines the rest of the room for evidence.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: There's nothing suspicious on the server. Only hits are music downloads. Wait a minute. An organ transplant site. For kidneys, heart, lungs and liver.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What is that? Homework research?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Maybe. These are pretty detailed biochem and immunosuppressant citations. It's a little over a seventh grader's head, don't you think?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I don't know. I bet you were a pretty smart seventh grader.</p>
<p>(Sara can't help but smile. Grissom picks up a purple and blue plastic backpack and looks at it.) </p>
<p>(Sara opens Alicia's notebook where she finds doodling of &quot;Mrs. Jimmy Jones&quot;, &quot;Mrs. Alicia Jones&quot;, &quot;Love Jimmy&quot;, red hearts and flowers.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: She has a serious crush on a boy named Jimmy Jones.</p>
<p>(Grissom looks around and finds &quot;I Hate Mom &amp; Dad&quot; written on the edge of the linens.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sara. </p>
<p>(Sara turns.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (reads) &quot;I hate mom &amp; dad.&quot;</p>
<p>(Daniel Perez appears in the doorway.) </p>
<p><strong>Daniel Perez</strong>: Who doesn't once in a while?</p>
<p>(Grissom and Sara look up. He introduces himself.) </p>
<p><strong>Daniel Perez</strong>: Daniel Perez. And you are ... ?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Gil Grissom, Sara Sidle, Las Vegas Crime Lab.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Perez</strong>: I guess that's why you're pawing through my sister's private stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It's going to help us find her. Do you know a Jimmy Jones?</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Perez</strong>: Yeah, a boy from school. She liked him.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What's your sister like? Personable, friendly, outgoing, trusting, maybe?</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Perez</strong>: She's a giver - from the day she was born.</p>
<p>(Daniel's nose starts to bleed.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Uh, Daniel... you're bleeding.</p>
<p>(Grissom points to his own nose.) </p>
<p><strong>Daniel Perez</strong>: I'm sorry. </p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: She played soccer?</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy Jones</strong>: Yeah, for awhile. She quit before she got cut. She missed a lot of practice 'cause she was always going to the doctor, and you can't really play with one kidney anyway, so ...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: She told you about her brother?</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy Jones</strong>: Yeah, on the way to school. Hell, I thought that it was cool that she was saving his life, but she seemed pretty pissed.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Jones</strong>: Jimmy ... language.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy Jones</strong>: Sorry. Anyway, uh, she didn't seem too happy. Said she had no life and never would.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, Jimmy, on your way to and from school, did anyone ever bother you or approach you in any way?</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy Jones</strong>: Um ... there was this one guy, with a track suit, he's supposed to be running. He gave me the creeps.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What gave you the creeps?</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy Jones</strong>: Well, start with his gear. I mean, nobody runs in velour. And he never had any water and he was always on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What'd he look like?</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy Jones</strong>: Black guy. He was not a runner, but he was in shape. Bald, mustache, beard.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: How old would you say he is, Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy Jones</strong>: Qld ... like 30. (He glances unsure at Catherine.) ... I just ... never liked the way he looked at Alicia.</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No, I did. I know that your recent preference is for little boys, but, uh, your first time was with a female cousin. Let me read what you said. &quot;I couldn't help myself 'cause she was acting so hot. It was her fault; she was really hot.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Marlon Waylord</strong>: Hey, they're mine. I bought the underwear!</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, if that's true, then you were in a store where little children were shopping with their mothers.</p>
<p><strong>Marlon Waylord</strong>: And what would you have me do, huh, man? What?! I mean, I even thought about chemical castration.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Medroxyprogesterone is inconclusive. It renders the subject incapable of erection, but it doesn't remove the drive. You would still be capable of sexual assault using other objects.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And, uh ... where did Alicia fit in, except for what she could give to your son?</p>
<p><strong>Sybil Perez</strong>: You have no idea what it's like.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I saw her medical records. I looked at her x-rays. I know what that little girl suffered, what you put her through.</p>
<p><strong>Sybil Perez</strong>: So you would let your child die and do nothing. Never. No, you'd talk to doctors and research. And then you'd find out that the national bone marrow registry can't help you 'cause your son is mixed race. And even if he wasn't, there aren't enough donors. Out of four million, only 205,000 are Latino. I did what I had to do.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You put one child over another.</p>
<p><strong>Sybil Perez</strong>: (scoffs) I don't expect you to understand. You don't have kids.</p>
<p>(Sybil stands up.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Uh, I have a daughter.</p>
<p><strong>Sybil Perez</strong>: (chuckles wryly) So, what kind of mother are you? When do you see her? You work nights. You probably don't even know where she half the time. Alicia's life may not have been simple, but at least I knew her. Can you say the same?</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Where's Greg?</p>
<p><strong>Mia Dickerson</strong>: Helping, uh ... Sara.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I need the tox results for Alicia Perez.</p>
<p><strong>Mia Dickerson</strong>: The report is still pending, but the blood on the mother's t-shirt matches the blood on the blanket. (She hands the results to him.) Belongs to the victim.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Menstrual?</p>
<p><strong>Mia Dickerson</strong>: Negative.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, the volume of blood that was found on the blanket suggests injury or some kind of trauma. </p>
<p><strong>Mia Dickerson</strong>: (nods, considers) Nevertheless ...</p>
<p>(Grissom looks at her doubtfully.) </p>
<p><strong>Mia Dickerson</strong>: I was very thorough.</p>

<p>(Sara and Greg stand at opposite ends of the trace table. On it are two boxes filled with bags of evidence.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Greg, you said you wanted to help out.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, yeah, with searching April's apartment, maybe finding the bad guy.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: This counts as field work, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Oh, I'm smiling on the inside.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Dirty laundry or garbage. (Greg starts to answer, but Sara makes the choice.) You know what? You take the garbage.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>(They each grab their box. They place it in front of themselves and open the bags inside.) </p>
<p>(Sara goes through the clothes' pockets. Greg picks through the garbage.) </p>
<p>(Greg pulls out a scrunched up piece of paper. It's of a map.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: April own a computer?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No. Why?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, she MapQuest the directions to the convenience store from the pedophile's address.</p>

<p>(The doors to the morgue open. Catherine leads Lindsay into the morgue where the bodies are kept.) </p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Willows</strong>: I already told you, mom, I heard you. Can we go now?</p>
<p>(Catherine leads Lindsay to the storage area.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No. You need to see for yourself why you can't ever hitchhike or go downtown or be careless with your safety. Are you ready?</p>
<p><strong>Lindsay Willows</strong>: Just do it. I'm not scared.</p>
<p>(Catherine opens the container door and pulls out the body of the dead woman. It's not a pretty sight.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (softly) She was waiting for a bus downtown when she was attacked. She's was 23. She was taller and stronger than you, Lindsay. She fought back and didn't win. Someone's gonna have to tell her family. Her parents are gonna have to see her like this. Do you get it now?</p>
<p>(Lindsay looks at Catherine, then runs out of the morgue. Robbins walks into the morgue.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Kids don't belong in the coroner's office unless they're in a drawer. You should've found a different way to deal with your daughter's rebellion.</p>
<p>(He walks up to Catherine as she puts the drawer back.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, with due respect, Doc, this doesn't concern you.</p>
<p>(Catherine turns to follow her daughter.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Ever notice how childhood keeps getting shorter and shorter? Whose fault is that?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (whirls around) I honestly don't know!</p>
<p>(Catherine leaves. Dr. Robbins watches her go.) </p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The suspect doesn't have a computer, but she could've gone to the library or used a service.</p>
<p><strong>Archie Johnson</strong>: No, physical location doesn't matter. What we do is a reversal process.</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Mr. and Mrs. Perez...</p>

<p><strong>Carlos Perez</strong>: What's going on?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'll tell you on the way to the police station - where's your son?</p>
<p><strong>Sybil Perez</strong>: He's at church. Why?</p>

<p>[EXT. PEREZ RESIDENCE - FRONT DRIVE - DAY]</p>
<p>(Nick is out by the Perez' car. He's looking at the back trunk and looks at the various items.)</p>
<p>[INT. PEREZ RESIDENCE - BED ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Warrick walks into the bedroom and looks around. He finds the bloody handkerchief on the night stand. He picks it up and puts his kit down. As he kneels next to the bed, he finds some blue fibers on the bedsheet.) </p>
<p>(He picks it up and looks at it.) </p>
<p>(Quick flashes of: [WOODS] Various flashes of Alicia Perez's body and the blanket wrapped around her.) </p>
<p>(End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p>(Sara walks into the bedroom.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Daniel Perez is taking oxycodone for pain, and Alicia was on diazepam.</p>
<p>(Sara looks a the prescription bottles.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Diazepam? That's a pretty hard-core antidepressant for a kid that small.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I guess they didn't want her complaining while they were mining her body for healthy cells.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You think they didn't care about her?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, it must've been hard, trying to keep their son alive, keep the family together. Couldn't have been easy.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It wasn't for Alicia.</p>
<p>(Warrick looks at Sara.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Did you find anything?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (sighs) Yeah. Blue fibers.</p>
<p>[EXT. PEREZ RESIDENCE - FRONT DRIVE - DAY]</p>
<p>(Sara and Warrick step out of the house and see Nick on the Front Drive. Nick has a tripod set up just outside the car.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I take it you qualified at the range.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You take it right.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What'd you shoot?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: 260 out of 300. 225's passing, which, I believe, was your high score.</p>
<p>(Warrick chuckles.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Where are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, this is dad's car. You ever see those guys out in the street, with the scope, measuring distances? Always thought they were nuts for standing out in traffic, but ... </p>
<p>(Nick closes the tripod and shows them the leg rods together.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Look familiar?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [FORENSIC AUTOPSY] The long double parallel marks down Alicia's back. End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Looks like the lividity marks on Alicia's body.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(Brass interviews Carlos Perez.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I don't get you, man. I mean, even if you could explain it, I would never understand how you could stuff your daughter in the trunk of your car and dump her body in the woods!</p>
<p><strong>Carlos Perez</strong>: I had to protect my family.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Wasn't Alicia part of your family? You're her father, you dumb b*st*rd! You're supposed to protect her. What kind of man are you?</p>
<p><strong>Carlos Perez</strong>: Guilty.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM B - DAY]</p>
<p>(Brass interviews Sybil Perez.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know, we got enough evidence to charge you with premeditated murder.</p>
<p><strong>Sybil Perez</strong>: You don't have any proof I killed my daughter. </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You helped your husband move the body. You know, I really don't see him taking her underpants off, so that job was left to you. Then you or your daughter, April, checked the s*x offenders' registry, and you tried to frame an innocent man.</p>
<p><strong>Sybil Perez</strong>: (scoffs) Innocent? You trying to make me believe you really give a damn about a pedophile? Please.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Forget about that; this is about you. You're the tough one. You run the house. You run the family. People do what you say in a crisis.</p>
<p><strong>Sybil Perez</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So this time Alicia said no. She wanted to keep her kidney, and that pissed you off. So you killed her.</p>
<p><strong>Sybil Perez</strong>: That's ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: She was angry -- she wanted to play on the soccer team, she wanted a life. </p>
<p><strong>Sybil Perez</strong>: Alicia got angry, sometimes. Just sick of it. We all did. But she'd have been devastated if Daniel had died and she did nothing to prevent it. She loved her brother.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: And you're just the type of woman that would never let her forget it. Come on, Alicia wanted out of this game, and you couldn't let that happen. Not to Daniel, not to your only son, your favorite child.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [INT. PEREZ RESIDENCE - KITCHEN] Sybil takes some Oxycodone and grinds it in a mortar.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (V.O.) You slipped Alicia some of Daniel's oxycodone.</p>
<p>(She puts the ground-up pills in a glass and pours some milk in it.) </p>
<p><strong>Sybil Perez</strong>: Alicia? Time for your pills.</p>
<p>(She gives Alicia her pills with the milk. Alicia drinks the milk.)</p>
<p>(End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So now you got a problem -- you had a dead body in the house and no plausible explanation. What are you gonna do? So you call your daughter April. You make up a story, you play your roles, and put on a show.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [NIGHT] April and Carlos carry Alicia wrapped in a blanket out from the house and into the back of Carlos' car.)</p>
<p><strong>Sybil Perez</strong>: Wait. We have to do this right.</p>
<p>(Sybil removes Alicia's panties.)</p>
<p>(End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, you know, I-I thought the, uh, the slap was a nice touch.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Warrick finds Grissom in the hallway. He hands him the results.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I have a confirmation. Those blue fibers are consistent with the blanket that the girl was wrapped in. And the shoe prints that I found at the scene, they're a match to the father's work boots. </p>
<p>(Greg walks up to Grissom and Warrick.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I re-tested the t-shirt and the blanket. The blood still matches Alicia Perez. The evidence supports this ... unless you'd like to second-guess that also.</p>
<p>(Warrick's eyes widen. He quietly steps away from the two.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I just expect things to be done correctly, Greg.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (carefully) We all have to learn how to accept change. Mia's doing a great job. It would be nice if someone other than me said so.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You're right. What about the handkerchief?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I compared that to the other blood evidence. It's also match to the victim.</p>
<p>(Grissom realizes what it means.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CHURCH -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Grissom walks down the aisle toward the front of the church where Daniel Perez sits. Grissom sits in the pew behind Daniel.) </p>
<p><strong>Daniel Perez</strong>: I didn't realize until ... today ... how lucky I am. I know pretty much ... how and when I'm gonna die. Most people don't. It's what they're afraid of.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Was your sister afraid?</p>
<p>(Daniel turns to look at Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Daniel Perez</strong>: Never. </p>
<p>(He looks back at the front of the church.) </p>
<p><strong>Daniel Perez</strong>: I'm 11 years older than her, and she took care of me. She was my best friend, and I miss her. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [HOSPITAL] Daniel is on the bed hooked up to the machine. Next to him, Alicia holds his hand.)</p>
<p>(End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Daniel Perez</strong>: As much pain as ... I caused her ... and she wouldn't give up, and she ... she wouldn't let me, either. That's why ... during the last relapse, I made my parents swear that it was the very last time.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: But then your kidneys failed, and they broke their word, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Perez</strong>: They told me they ... swore not to fight the cancer, so this didn't count. I wasn't gonna lose this fight.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [DANIEL] He pours the ground up Oxycodone into Alicia's milk. He gives the milk to Alicia.)</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Perez</strong>: (o.s.) Here you go. Makes it better.</p>
<p>(Alicia drinks it.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: Alicia drops the empty milk glass.) </p>
<p><strong>Sybil Perez</strong>: (V.O.) Oh my god! Please...</p>
<p>(Sybil and Carlos finds Alicia dead.)</p>
<p><strong>Carlos Perez</strong>: We have to call the police.</p>
<p><strong>Sybil Perez</strong>: They'll put him in prison.</p>
<p>(End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Daniel Perez</strong>: I couldn't watch her suffer anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This wasn't a mercy killing, Daniel. This was an execution. Bone marrow, transfusions ... that's her blood in your veins. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [HOSPITAL] Daniel's on the bed receiving a transfusion.)</p>
<p>(End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It dripped out of your nose onto the blanket while you were killing her. If you cared so much for Alicia, why didn't you take your own life instead of hers?</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Perez</strong>: Suicide isn't an option. It's an unforgivable sin in the eyes of God.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: But you believe your God forgives murder? If that's your defense, it won't keep you out of jail.</p>
<p>(Daniel turns around to look at Grissom. His cheeks are stained with tears.) </p>
<p><strong>Daniel Perez</strong>: (crying) But my death will. See, I've got about six more months. I'll be dead before there's even a trial.</p>
<p>(Daniel stands up.)</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Perez</strong>: I-I do want to thank you, though.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Perez</strong>: For speaking for Alicia. You're probably the first person in her life to think only of her. You know, you may not believe in God, sir, but you do his work.</p>
<p>(Daniel nods and leaves. He walks up to the officer who handcuffs him.)</p>
<p>(Grissom remains behind in the pew. He looks up at the statue of Jesus on the wall with his arms outstretched.)</p>
<p>(Camera holds on Grissom.) </p>

							<p>COLD OPEN:</p>
<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY INTERSECTION (STOCK) -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Time Lapse Fast Forward. Focus on the street intersection below. The cars zoom quickly, their lights simple streaks of light on the street. In the center of the screen is the back of the Statue of Liberty.) </p>
<p>[EXT. TACO STAND - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(A young man makes a purchase and takes his tacos with him as he leaves. A woman nearby giggles.) </p>
<p>(The young man heads for his car, gets inside and starts the engine.)</p>
<p>(The headlights flip open.) </p>
<p>(The car moves forward and pulls out of the parked area.)</p>
<p>(Inside the car, the young man takes a bite from his taco. He grabs the steering wheel and turns his car out onto the main road.) </p>
<p>(He drives away while eating his taco. He takes another bite, looks up when bright lights shine straight toward him. He slams on the car breaks.)</p>
<p>(The car screeches to a halt as a large Hummer heads straight for his car.) </p>
<p>(The Hummer doesn't stop and rolls right over his car.) </p>
<p>(The windshield glass breaks. The man grunts as he's thrown side-to-side. He squishes his taco into the side window.) </p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
[EXT. STREET - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The officers lift the crime scene tape as Grissom ducks under it. He walks past Officer Metcalf, who drops the tape behind him, a large taco clutched in his other hand.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer Metcalf</strong>: This is the best taco I ever had.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm happy for you both.</p>
<p>(Grissom heads toward Brass, who turns around and appears surprised to see Grissom there.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What, did you piss off Ecklie again? This is a hit-and-run. I was expecting Greg Sanders.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We're slammed. Everybody's on a case.</p>
<p>(Grissom puts his kit down on the road near the car; the Hummer partially covers the front half of the sleek car.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Is this a Fiero?</p>
<p>(Brass leads Grissom around the two cars.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, the old Fiero. Kind of makes you nostalgic for a &quot;members only&quot; jacket. Anyway, the Hummer was going the wrong way on a one-way street. The guy in the Fiero, lucky to be alive. Nobody saw the driver get out.</p>
<p>(Grissom puts his gloves on.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: People who drive $100,000 vehicles don't usually run away from them.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, you obviously haven't met any paroled rappers.</p>
<p>(Brass stops. Grissom sees the tread marks on the road.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Tread-mark shapes indicate acceleration. </p>
<p>(Grissom looks up. We hear the sounds of an engine gunning and tires screeching. Grissom visualizes the Hummer coming straight toward them from down the street.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Pedal to the metal. Maybe a getaway.</p>
<p>(Grissom and Brass turn, their eyes following the path of the imaginary Hummer as it comes to stop on top of the Fiero.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Or maybe a joyride.</p>
<p>(Brass and Grissom walk over to the Hummer's open driver's door.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: There's a red smear on the door. Somebody's got blood on their hands.</p>
<p>(Brass shows Grissom the bloodstains.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p>(Grissom looks inside the driver's seat and notes the air bag.)</p>
<p>(Camera zooms to show the powder residue on the air bag. Grissom looks at the air bag.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, at least we know one thing about the driver. </p>
<p>(Quick flash to: Slow motion. The air bag releases and fills as the driver's face slams into the air bag. End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He's had a face lift.</p>
<p>FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(A phone rings as Grissom walks through the hallway. He heads toward reception.) </p>
<p><strong>Judy Tremont</strong>: (o.s.) (to phone) Crime Lab, how can I help you?</p>
<p>(Grissom walks past a woman. As Greg and Sara return to the office, Grissom catches a bit of their conversation.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Sara, I just want you to know that when we were in the shower, I didn't see anything.<br />
(Grissom turns around and watches them go, surprise etched on his face.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Really? Gosh, I saw everything.</p>
<p><strong>Judy Tremont</strong>: (o.s.) Mr. Grissom. (Grissom turns to look back in Judy's direction.) PD just called. Apparently, the Humvee from your hit-and-run was carjacked earlier tonight.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - BRASS' OFFICE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Brass interviews Wilma and Kyle Shaw.) </p>
<p><strong>Wilma Shaw</strong>: Yeah, it was our Hummer ... for all of twenty minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Kyle Shaw</strong>: We ... we won it in a raffle.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, what happened?</p>
<p><strong>Kyle Shaw</strong>: All of a sudden, this fat guy comes out of nowhere and ...</p>
<p><strong>Wilma Shaw</strong>: (interrupts) Fat guy?! No, that's you.</p>
<p><strong>Kyle Shaw</strong>: What's me?</p>
<p><strong>Wilma Shaw</strong>: (scoffs) Fat guy ...</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, um, how do you see it, Mrs. Shaw?</p>
<p><strong>Wilma Shaw</strong>: The kid who took the car was skinny.</p>
<p><strong>Kyle Shaw</strong>: Well, maybe he wasn't as big as me, but he was definitely fat.</p>
<p><strong>Wilma Shaw</strong>: I'm going to sock you one. He was not.</p>
<p><strong>Kyle Shaw</strong>: He pulled me out of the car!</p>
<p><strong>Wilma Shaw</strong>: He was as skinny as a stickman!</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah ...</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. ROAD - DAY]</p>
<p>(Officer Metcalf accompanies Grissom on a road back.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer Metcalf</strong>: According to the, uh, witness statement, the carjacker was hanging over there by the fence.</p>
<p>(He points over to the wire fence lining the lot nearby.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What are we, about three blocks from the crash site?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Metcalf</strong>: Uh, yeah.</p>
<p>(Grissom looks at the fence.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer Metcalf</strong>: Nice freakin' neighborhood.</p>
<p>(Grissom raises his camera and takes photos of the smudges of blood on the fence post.) </p>
<p>(Grissom looks around. He looks down on the ground and sees some blood drops. He continues walking. A little farther down, he finds a handkerchief with some blood on it thrown in the grass on the side of the road.) </p>
<p>(He snaps a photo of it. He takes out a scissors and picks it up.) </p>
<p>(Sirens wail in the distance. A police car rushes toward them down the road, then turns to the right. Grissom looks up and notices the car. Off screen, we hear tires screeching.) </p>
<p>(A short while later, we see a detective car following the officer car.) </p>
<p>(Grissom goes back to the bloody handkerchief. He takes out a plastic bag from his pocket and opens it.) </p>
<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO: </p>
<p>[EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE FRONT -- DAY] </p>
<p>(An officer drags a man toward their car, the perturbed convenience store owner following them.) </p>
<p><strong>Vernon</strong>: Come on, man! I didn't do nothing! Let me go!</p>
<p><strong>Store Owner</strong>: Try to steal from me, you miserable lowlife! This time, I get justice! You're going to jail! You are going to jail!</p>
<p><strong>Vernon</strong>: Man, you just a damn racist.</p>
<p>(Brass stops the officers.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hold up. This guy matches the description of a suspect in a carjack hit-and-run.</p>
<p><strong>Vernon</strong>: Naw, Dawgs, yo, I jacked a 40, not no car, a'ight?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, a'ight ... One Cent, let's go.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Brass and Grissom walk through the hallway.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So the kid denies jacking the Hummer. Says he's never even been in one.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We matched his blood on the gearshift and on the headband I found in the alley.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: And he's skinny, which matches one of the descriptions. I'm charging him.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. TRACE LAB - DAY]</p>
<p>(Hodges reports his findings to Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: The oily stain you collected from the Hummer's air bag was, ironically enough, oil. More specifically, lard. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It looks like there's tissue fibers mixed into it.</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Several different types, actually, so I ran an ELISA to differentiate. Pork, beef, chicken and possibly human flesh. A real taste treat. It's all been cooked up, so I doubt we'll get any DNA.</p>
<p>(As he talks, something occurs to Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: What are you thinking about?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Tacos.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. TACO STAND -- DAY] </p>
<p>(The taco stand owner cooks up the next batch of meat and onions on the grill. Grissom walks up to him.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hola.</p>
<p>TACO STAND <strong>Owner</strong>: Hola. Chicken, beef or pork, boss?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Los carnitas, por favor.</p>
<p>TACO STAND <strong>Owner</strong>: Carnitas.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Say, uh ... </p>
<p>(Grissom shows the owner his ID card.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Have you had any trouble around here recently?</p>
<p>TACO STAND <strong>Owner</strong>: Just a little scuffle yesterday. Nothing I couldn't handle.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [NIGHT] The taco stand owner checks his cash and shoves it in his pocket as two young men, Vernon and Lawrence Lafontaine, walk up to him.) </p>
<p><strong>Vernon</strong>: Yo, pops, give me the loot!</p>
<p>(Vernon and Lawrence Lafontaine walk up to him intending on taking the money from him. The taco stand owner turns, deflects Vernon's arm from grabbing him, picks up the knife on the counter and stabs the kid in the leg. The kid screams.)</p>
<p>(With his other hand, the taco stand owner picks up the hot pan of oil on the grill and throws it at Lawrence Lafontaine.)</p>
<p>(Both men turn and run screaming.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Didn't you file a police report?</p>
<p>TACO STAND <strong>Owner</strong>: Bother you guys with something like that? (He scoffs.) I was a kid once. Those guys just needed someone to set 'em straight. Here you go.</p>
<p>(He gives Grissom his tacos.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Gracias.</p>
<p>TACO STAND <strong>Owner</strong>: Denada. Oh, it's on the house.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Muchas gracias.</p>
<p>(The taco stand owner smiles. Grissom takes out his cell phone and starts dialing.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to phone) Jim, we need to go back to the hospitals. </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) We may be looking for a burn patient. </p>
<p>[INT. HOSPITAL -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Lawrence Lafontaine sits on the bed. Brass, Grissom and a couple of officers step into the room. Lawrence turns and gets to his feet.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Lawrence Lafontaine, you're under arrest.</p>
<p><strong>Lawrence Lafontaine</strong>: Vernon rat me out?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No, the taco did.</p>
<p><strong>Lawrence Lafontaine</strong>: Everyone around my hood knows that taco guy. To get whooped by his old ass and not do anything about it?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [NIGHT] Vernon and Lawrence Lafontaine are running down the side street.) </p>
<p><strong>Vernon</strong>: For real, stop, yo!</p>
<p>(Vernon collapses to the ground. Lawrence takes off his headband and ties it around Vernon's thigh.) </p>
<p><strong>Vernon</strong>: Man, dawgs, it hurts for real, man.</p>
<p><strong>Lawrence Lafontaine</strong>: Here, now, you straight? Stop being such a little baby.</p>
<p><strong>Vernon</strong>: I need some medicine -- I ain't talking about going to no hospital, either.</p>
<p><strong>Lawrence Lafontaine</strong>: Well, have fun then, man. I'm-a get me some payback.</p>
<p>(Lawrence takes off.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Lawrence Lafontaine</strong>: Vern just bitched out, wanted to forget it ever happened. Not me.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So you stole the Hummer for revenge.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [NIGHT] Wilma and Kyle Shaw are in their new Humvee. Wilma looks at the map and shakes her head.) </p>
<p><strong>Wilma Shaw</strong>: I knew we should've asked for directions.</p>
<p>(Lawrence runs up, opens the door and grabs Kyle Shaw, pulling him out of the car.) </p>
<p><strong>Lawrence Lafontaine</strong>: Out of the car, man!</p>
<p><strong>Kyle Shaw</strong>: Hey, hey, hey!</p>
<p><strong>Lawrence Lafontaine</strong>: Get the hell out of the car!</p>
<p>CUT TO: [TACO STAND] </p>
<p>(The taco stand owner talks with the Fiero owner as he prepares his order.) </p>
<p>TACO STAND <strong>Owner</strong>: (to Fiero owner) They just needed someone to set them straight. </p>
<p>(The Humvee rushes down the street. Lawrence is behind the wheel. His eyes are solely on the taco stand and he doesn't see the Fiero pull out in front of him.) </p>
<p>(He sees the car too late. He tries to brake; the tries to turn. The Humvee rolls right on top of the Fiero.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Let me get this straight, Larry. An old man refuses to let you steal his money, so you jack a Hummer and try to run over his taco stand?</p>
<p><strong>Lawrence Lafontaine</strong>: (sighs) Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I think this is the dumbest thing we've ever heard.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY INTERSECTION (STOCK) -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Time Lapse Quick Rewind. Focus on the street intersection below. The cars zoom backward quickly, their lights simple streaks of light on the street. In the center of the screen is the back of the Statue of Liberty.) </p>
<p>[INT. CSI - HALLWAY - DAY]</p>
<p>(Rewind. Sara and Greg walk backward as they pass Grissom in the hallway in front of reception. The sound is on rewind.) </p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Camera pulls away from the city lights.)</p>
<p>[EXT. ROAD - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Rewind. The Hummer on top of the Fiero rolls off, backward.)</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - EVENING TO AFTERNOON]</p>
<p>(Rewind. Evening rewinds back into day.) </p>
<p>[INT. INTERNATIONAL VEHICLE EXPO - DAY]</p>
<p>(Various shots of the Expo in full swing. With each display is a beautiful woman presenting the latest product.) </p>
<p>(At the main stage is Mr. Daluca standing in front of a closed curtain fronted by several beautiful women.) </p>
<p><strong>Mr. Daluca</strong>: It's a beach house, a ski lodge, a state-of-the-art office, your home on the road ... ladies and gentlemen, Daluca Motorcoaches is proud to present the g-4700!</p>
<p>(The crowd cheers. The women standing in front of the stage pull the curtain open. On the floor, center stage, is a dead woman.) </p>
<p>(Mr. Daluca turns around. The crowd's cheers fade. Cameras snap.) </p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO: </p>
<p>[INT. INTERNATIONAL VEHICLE EXPO - DAY] </p>
<p>(Warrick steps on stage.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Gentlemen.</p>
<p>(Det. Vartann looks at Warrick as David Phillips kneels next to the dead body.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p>(Warrick puts his kit down on the ground and steps closer.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What's going on here?</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Lisa Schumacher, 29.</p>
<p>(Det. Vartann hands Warrick Lisa Schumacher's ID tag.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: There's no surveillance on the floor, and none of the rent-a-cops remember the last time they saw her.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: A convention girl.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: A what?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You know, a model, stripper or a showgirl working the convention for extra cash. You got a T.O.D. yet?</p>
<p>(David puts his clipboard down and rolls the body to check out the woman's back.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Well, based on lividity, I'd say around 4:00 A.M. (David notes the cut on her mouth.) Laceration on the lower lip. Contusions on the neck.<br />
(He checks her eyes.) Petechiae in the eyes. </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: So she got slapped around, strangled. Maybe somewhere in between, she was raped.</p>
<p>(Warrick kneels down next to the body and notes the off-colored makeup smudges on her skin.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: These streaks right here. They don't look like blood.</p>
<p>(He looks at her nails.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Possible hair fragments and some skin under her nails.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: She fought back.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It'd be good for us.</p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[INT. INTERNATIONAL VEHICLE EXPO - DAY] </p>
<p>(The coroners wheel out the body wrapped on a gurney. The crowd murmurs as they move out from behind the display) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. INTERNATIONAL VEHICLE EXPO - MOTORCOACH DISPLAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Warrick checks out the motorcoach the body was found in. He opens the door to the bathroom and looks around.) </p>
<p>(He looks at the things on the counter. He opens the cell phone, closes it and sets it back down on the counter.)</p>
<p>(He looks in the toilet and flips on the ALS. He finds some stains inside and takes a swab of it. He closes the swab. He flips open the flush unit and finds some used condoms inside.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So that's why they call it a &quot;recreational vehicle.&quot;</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY - DAY]</p>
<p>(Robbins goes over the preliminary report on Lisa Schumacher with Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: C.O.D. is asphyxia due to manual strangulation. Whoever did this used a lot more force than they needed to. There's bleeding in the neck muscles. Fractures in the cornu of the thyroid cartilage and hyoid bone.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Did you do a wet mount?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Sure did. Found motile sperm in the vaginal cavity.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, Warrick found several used condoms at the scene. Killer must have run out, and started riding bareback.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Eh, I'm not sure he rode anything at all. There's an absence of trauma in the vaginal cavity.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Enough to rule out rape?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Yeah. The semen was found at a depth not indicative of penile penetration. In this case, only a couple inches in.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Maybe that's all the killer had to work with.</p>

<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Well, we're only interested in Lisa Schumacher.</p>
<p><strong>Donny Drummer</strong>: She's one of my girls. I represent her. They call her &quot;Cris,&quot; as in Cristal, the champagne. She can't get enough of it.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: She likes to party?</p>
<p><strong>Donny Drummer</strong>: She likes to make money. Girls who party make the money. This ain't L.A., where you get up at 10:00 A.M. for an audition. At 10:00 A.M., My girls are still at Drai's partying with the client. What's this about?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: She was found dead this morning.</p>
<p><strong>Donny Drummer</strong>: No. Come on, she's over there working the Daluca account.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: You didn't hear?</p>
<p><strong>Donny Drummer</strong>: There's two million square feet of exhibits here, man. Forty thousand people. This place is a mini-city. That RV exhibit's across town. </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I was told that the doors close at ten. Any idea why she was here after hours?</p>
<p><strong>Donny Drummer</strong>: Look, she worked behind a booth, yapping her mouth. Can't really throw her in a bikini no more. She's getting up there. Three-oh, uh-oh.<br />
(He chuckles.) I didn't really keep tabs.</p>
<p>(Gwen rushes up to Donny, interrupting them.) </p>
<p><strong>Gwen</strong>: Donny.</p>
<p><strong>Donny Drummer</strong>: You're late. And you're not dressed. What's the deal, girl?!</p>
<p><strong>Gwen</strong>: Please, Donny, I just had the worst morning.</p>
<p><strong>Donny Drummer</strong>: Oh, you think you had it bad? Well, Cris is dead.</p>
<p><strong>Gwen</strong>: Oh, my God.</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: The results, Hodges, from the swabs I gave you? From Lisa Schumacher's fingertips?</p>
<p>(Hodges stands up and pushes his face mask down. He goes over to get Warrick his results.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Fine. I found several substances. Nonoxynol-9 spermicide.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Spermicide. So she did handle a condom.</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Also found traces of pvp, sorbitol, carbomer, hydroxypropylcellulose -- probably a hair gel.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, she did have skin under her fingernails, so she could've scratched her attacker's scalp.</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Not my job. And last, the brownish-orange substance on the vic's fingers, chest and shoulders: instant tanning lotion.</p>

<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: It's not just the print that makes you look bad, it's you. You're raffling off a Hummer hours after your roommate turns up dead.</p>
<p><strong>Candice Mosti</strong>: What am I supposed to do? I'm broke and my car insurance is due.</p>
<p>(As she talks, Warrick notices the makeup smudges on her arm.) </p>

<p><strong>Candice Mosti</strong>: Forgot to rub it in, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Razor-tight girl like you forgetting to rub tanning lotion in? Doesn't sound right to me. You know, the funny thing is, is your girlfriend Lisa had streaks of tanner on her body, too. Were you girls together last night?</p>

<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: &quot;With it&quot; where?</p>
<p><strong>Candice Mosti</strong>: We had dinner at Fix. Partied at Mix. Gambled a little. Then he took us back to the convention center. Hammered and horny.</p>

<p>(Hodges steps into the room.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Did you say rhizopus oryzae?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We spent hours in that house.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: You're not at risk. You both have healthy immune systems. I suspect that's not the case with your vic.</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Copy that. Trace on the syringes was deca-durabolin, sustanon and oxandrolone.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Steroids. That guy was &quot;stacking&quot; to get bigger.</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Immune suppression is a common side effect.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So, how does a mold infection make it look like someone smashed him across the face?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: His face collapsed from the inside. Mucor causes deterioration of the bones around the sinuses and eye sockets. You remember the swollen eyeball? The pus was pushing it out, while the bones that held it in place were getting eaten away.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: Paul Charles is working out.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (V.O.) The airborne mold spores enter the nasal cavity ... </p>
<p>(As Paul Charles breathes in, the camera zooms into his nose.)</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV of: The camera zooms into the nasal cavity. The spores latches onto the sinuses and turn the walls from pink to black as it grows.) </p>

<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (points) Here? A whole lot of blood.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We're getting warmer. (points) Open it up.</p>
<p>(Greg cuts through the wall. They peel back the drywall and find a thick coat of black mold growing along the pipes and wall inside. The pipe is leaking.) </p>
<p>(Sara turns on her flashlight and looks at the growth.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Looks like we found the source of the mold.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Okay. So, how does human tissue get inside a wall?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Good question.</p>
<p>(Sara looks further.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: There's a hole in the air duct.</p>
<p>(She finds a bullet.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: A bullet hole ... (She takes out the bullet.) It's a nine mil.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Same as the handgun I found in the bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Copper-jacketed. It's good penetrating power. I think somebody was shot here.</p>

<p>(Camera zooms in through the bullet hole in the blood-spattered wall.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (V.O.) Bullet pushed blood and tissue through the wall.</p>
<p>(Camera pushes into the bullet lodged just under the leaky pipe.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (V.O.) And water from the pipe leak fed the mold growth.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV of: Time lapse. The mold grows around the bullet.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (V.O.) Eventually, the mold released spores, ... </p>
<p>(The mold lets off spores that float through the air.) </p>

<p>(Grissom looks at them.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Very good.</p>

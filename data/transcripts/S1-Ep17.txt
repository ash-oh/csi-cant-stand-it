Marc: Not again.
Ann: We are buying that alarm system.
Marc: No argument from me.

Ann: I'm serious. They got the cash. Why did they have to be such a mess?

Marc: Oh, my god...
Ann: What? What's wrong?
Marc: Call 911.

Grissom: Introductions?
Brass: Joseph Felton, 44. Not an employee; no reason to be here.
Grissom: Mind if he and I have a moment together?
Brass: No. 






Brass: Burn marks?
Nick: Unusual way to penetrate a safe.

Brass: Hmm ...
Nick:  How much was taken? 
Brass: Three hundred and something, small bills.
Grissom:  Multiple contusions to the back of the skull. Might've been taken by surprise.
Catherine: Robbery interruptus?
Grissom: Yeah, I think our robbery suspect is a homicide victim.
Catherine: One way to beat the rap.
HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS


FADE IN.


 
Dr. Albert Robbins: This is an easy one. The guy from the pottery store has got three hits to the head. Trauma to the brain stem was fatal. Death was instantaneous.
Catherine: Can you tell us anything about the murder weapon?
Dr. Albert Robbins: Nothing definite. But I swabbed the points of impact. Slide's under the microscope.


Nick: Yellow looks like transfer from the murder weapon but what's with the glitter?

Dr. Albert Robbins: Unidentified mineral. I sent a sample to trace for analysis.
Catherine: Hey, Doc, you have a comb?

Nick: Your hair looks great, Cath.
Catherine: Gee, thanks, Nick.

Dr. Albert Robbins: Guy's still dirty. They don't get a bath till evidence is collected.
Catherine: That's what I'm doing although I don't think this is dirt. 

Catherine: He's covered in spores. 

Catherine: I think these are from a fern.
Nick: Well, the back entrance was overgrown with them.

Catherine: A fern plant deposits billions of spores in its lifetime. Most are just dust in the wind. In our case they're evidence. As good as fingerprints or fibers in placing a suspect at a crime scene.
CUT TO:


 
Catherine: Hey, you forget about the coroner?
Grissom: Melissa Marlowe.
Catherine: Excuse me?

Grissom: You lifted 38 prints from the pottery store. I scanned them through AFIS. One came back. Melissa Marlowe.

Catherine: Why do I know that name?
Grissom: Kidnapping - Colorado -- 21 years ago ... the little girl.
Catherine: Oh, that Melissa Marlowe. Wasn't she presumed dead?
Grissom: Well, not anymore on the left is Melissa Marlowe's print, age four -- preschool fingerprinting initiative. On the right is a print that you lifted from the crime scene.
Catherine: I don't see a match.
Grissom: Neither did I but since fingerprints are set for life during the fourth month of fetal development I looked beyond the size differential. 

Grissom: Now, both prints are ulnar loops. Bifurcation, recurve and ridge endings are identical. 

Grissom: I've aligned the prints along the delta.

Catherine: You've got a perfect match. Wait. Is she a suspect in the homicide?
Grissom: No. Her print wasn't fresh. There was dust on it. Has to be a few weeks old. I think we have two separate cases. So I'm going to take the new lead in the old kidnapping case.
Catherine: And Nick and I will cover the homicide.

Sara: Nadine Winston falls asleep in that chair and incinerates. We can make history.

Warrick: Oh, come on, now. Don't tell me you believe in that bs.

Sara: No. Of course not. I'm a scientist. I just ... 

Sara: She has been reduced to ashes.

Warrick:  Come on, Sara. 

Warrick: Spontaneous human combustion is science fiction.
Sara: I know.
Warrick: There's no such thing as a human torch.
Sara: What if it is real, and we've uncovered it?
Warrick: Sara, this is a crime scene. Stay with me here, okay? Don't lose it.
Sara: I'm not. I'm just open to all theories.
Warrick: What's that?
Sara: Looks like cotton fiber ... possibly from a nightgown. It's barely scorched. Weird. It's like the body burned, but ... the clothing was fire retardant.

Warrick: Wow. Check that out.

Sara: Fire practically burned a hole in the roof but it's isolated in one spot.
Warrick: It's as if the fire created a chimney for itself.
Sara: The victim -- she live alone?
Officer Arvington: Husband's already at the station.

Larry Winston: I am telling you, I have no idea what happened to my wife.


Sgt. O'Riley: Were you having marital problems?

Larry Winston: No. We were like newlyweds.
Sgt. O'Riley: If I understand you correctly you went to bed. Nadine fell asleep in the easy chair. Ten hours later, you woke up, walked into the living room and she was a pile of ash.

Sara: A human torch.
Warrick:  Yeah, right.
Sgt. O'Riley: You say you were like newlyweds?
Larry Winston: Yeah.
Sgt. O'Riley: But the two of you weren't sleeping in the same bed.
Warrick: Good question.
Larry Winston: She snored. It was a problem, but ... A small one.
Sgt. O'Riley: Mr. Winston ... do you know how to use a blowtorch?
Warrick: Another good question.
Larry Winston:  Look, I came down to this station on my own. If I can be helpful, let me know!

Warrick: So do you still think it's spontaneous combustion?
Sara: Theories give way to conclusions once all the evidence is in. I am merely thinking about the next piece of evidence.
Warrick:  Yeah.
CUT TO:

 
 
Brass: Yeah. Hey, Nicky, you paged me?
Nick: Yeah. Yeah, Jim, hi. I took these photos at the crime scene. 

Nick: Safe was cracked with a plasma lance.
BRASS Okay, I'll bite.
Nick: It's a high-powered electric blaster. It could cut through that hard plate with extreme precision. It's not common, but effective. 
Brass: Yeah.
Nick: Crime scene photo from a robbery case in '99. 

Nick: Joseph Felton our dead guy, was arrested but granted immunity in exchange for his testimony against his partner, Darin Hanson who used a plasma lance to crack that safe. Darin Hanson ...

Nick: ... was released from prison last month. His last known address -Vegas.
Brass: I see where you're going. So Hanson gets out of jail, hooks up with our dead guy.
Nick: Yeah, they hook it up.

Nick:  ... break through the rear entrance of the pottery store.

Nick:  Hanson lances the safe ...

Nick:  Once the safe is cracked, Hanson steps back allowing Felton to collect the cash.

Nick:  With Felton's attention diverted Hanson seizes the moment ... kills him.

Nick: Revenge for testifying against him and putting him in prison.
Brass: That's not bad. Any chance you guys found the murder weapon?
Nick: No, no ... but I think we know who to ask.
CUT TO:


 
Darin Hanson: I haven't seen Joseph Felton since the trial two years ago.
Nick: So it's a coincidence that he was killed shortly after you were released from prison.
Darin Hanson: Yeah. Guy put me in jail. I had no reason to see him again.
Catherine: He put you in the &quot;gray bar&quot;? Sounds like motive to me.
Brass: Darin ... you and Felton, you go back, huh?
Darin Hanson: Mm-hmm. Knew the guy fifteen years. My folks lived across the street from him. We'd barbecue together with his wife and daughter.
Catherine: He must have really pissed you off when he turned on you.
Nick: The transcript from your trial says that you used a plasma lance in that
'99 burglary, and there it is again, Darin.
Darin Hanson: Joe was the lance guy. He taught me how to break into safes. That's why the M.O.'S the same.
Brass: Where were you this morning early A.M.?
Darin Hanson: I was in Barstow all week. Just got back this afternoon. 

Darin Hanson: Okay ... here you go ... receipts from the trip. Go ahead.

Catherine: Looks authentic. Cactus Pine Cafe, Barstow, noon today.

Brass: We can't hold him.

Mrs. Marlowe: 21 years ago, the chief of police sat in our living room told us our daughter was dead.
Hank Marlowe: After all this time, she's in Vegas? That's a hundred miles from our home.
Grissom: Well, we still don't know where she is. Her prints in the pottery store tell us that she was here possibly a few weeks ago, but Vegas is a tourist town.
Hank Marlowe: But you know she's alive.
Grissom: I'm still not sure we can find her.
Mrs. Marlowe: She's our only child. We never gave up hope. We're not giving up now.
Teri Miller:  Excuse me.

Grissom: Teri ... come in.
Teri Miller: Hi.

Grissom: Teri Miller, Mr. and Mrs. Marlowe.
Teri Miller: Hello.
Mrs. Marlowe: Hi.
Grissom: Teri is a forensic artist. I called her to help us.
Teri Miller: Did you bring the photographs of Melissa?
Mrs. Marlowe: Yes, but I don't see how they can help. In some of those, she's just an infant.
Teri Miller: It doesn't matter. Do you remember her eyes?
Mrs. Marlowe: I could never forget.
Teri Miller: As we age, our eyes don't change. That's where we'll start.
Grissom: Using computer software Teri can age Melissa's picture so that we can determine what she looks like today at age 25. Then we send it off to every law enforcement agency in the state.
Hank Marlowe: It's been so long. Tell us the truth. What are our chances?
Grissom: Well, 21 years ago, they told you that your daughter was dead. Now we're moving in the right direction.
FADE OUT.

Tammy Felton: Where did you find him?
Catherine: At a pottery store on Stansberry Street. Tammy, we've already I.D.'D your father. If you don't want to see him, I'd understand.
Tammy Felton: No. I want to say good-bye.
Catherine: Well, don't be surprised by some swelling and discoloration. 

Catherine: You have any other family?
Tammy Felton: No.
Catherine: I can put you in touch with a counselor if you need to talk.
Tammy Felton: No, thank you.

Catherine: Is there anything you need?

Catherine: Tammy ... were you at the pottery store with your father?
Tammy Felton: What are you talking about?

Catherine: There's some plant spores on your sweater. We found them on your father, too, and matched them to some ferns behind the pottery store.
Tammy Felton: I don't understand. 

Tammy Felton: What are you doing?
Catherine: I'm taking these spores into evidence. They place you at the crime scene. Is there anything you want to tell me?
Tammy Felton: Okay, I was there.

Tammy Felton: Dad! Dad, don't do this. I'll get a job. We don't need the money. Not like this.
Joseph Felton: Tammy, go home.


Tammy Felton: And I don't know what happened after that.
Catherine: Why didn't you just tell me that?
Tammy Felton: I wanted to preserve the good memories not remember my dad as a thief.  I didn't kill him. I loved him. I need a release from your office ... so I can bury my father.

CUT TO:



Warrick: Okay, tell me everything you can about this foot.
David Phillips: Where's the rest of the body?
Sara: Incinerated. Lab results from the ashes came back negative for accelerant. Nothing flammable but sebaceous glutamate.
David Phillips: Human fat. Well ... I can tell you that the malleolus -- the ankle bone -- is completely hollowed out.

David Phillips:  Bone marrow was reduced to ash.

David Phillips: Which means that the foot was burned off the body, not severed. That's consistent with your theory of spontaneous combustion.
Warrick: How do you know about Sara's theory?
David Phillips: Word gets around.
Warrick: No. You're just siding with Sara 'cause you got a crush on her.
David Phillips:  No, that's why I wore a clean coat. I'm just reporting my observations. If the foot had been severed, the marrow would still be intact.
Warrick: So your official &quot;observation&quot; is spontaneous combustion?
David Phillips: Not yet. I want to send a scraping down to toxicology.

David Phillips: Excuse me. 
 
David Phillips: I want to check for any flammable compounds in the blood. Don't expect much.

David Phillips: The quality of the sample may have been compromised by the heat.
Sara: I'm going to go talk to Grissom -- see what he thinks.
Warrick: No, no. We're a team. The only place we're going is back down to that crime scene.
CUT TO:


 
Teri Miller: Okay, software's loaded.
Grissom: It's preprogrammed with developmental averages?
Teri Miller: Exactly. Aging is about predictable craniofacial growth. Faces grow down and out. So the first step is to stretch the bottom half of the face.

Teri Miller: You try.

Teri Miller:  Go ahead.

Grissom: No, no. Maybe you should drive.
Teri Miller: Good idea. Here we go. So, at age four, the bridge of the nose is taking shape and the interorbital distance is established. And baby teeth are visible.

Grissom: I have a question.
Teri Miller: Okay.
Grissom: Since I screwed up our last date, will we ever have dinner again?
Teri Miller:  Oh, we'll have dinner ... just not together. So the ears are low and large in proportion to the head.

Grissom: You know, I did apologize.
Teri Miller: And you're forgiven. 

Teri Miller: So over the next ten years, the face elongates the skin thickens, the hair pattern is set and the small deciduous teeth are replaced by the secondary dentition.

Teri Miller: Once the face is aged I look to the mother to fill in the blanks.

Grissom: Is that Mrs. Marlowe?
Teri Miller: Uh-huh. Most daughters at age 25 age quite similar to their mothers.

Teri Miller: A network of grids allows me to fine-tune the tiniest facial characteristics one section at a time. I'm just softening a few edges, growing the hair ... and we're done.

Grissom: Wow. Hello, Melissa.

Catherine: Am I interrupting?
Teri Miller: Not at all. You're just in time.
Grissom: Catherine, say hello to Melissa Marlowe.

Catherine: Oh, my god.
Grissom: What?
Catherine: That's Tammy Felton and we've already met.

FADE OUT.

Nick: Tammy Felton's our murder suspect?
Catherine: She was kidnapped 21 years ago and may have killed the man who raised her -- possibly the same man who kidnapped her.
Nick: Whoa, wait. I thought her prints from the crime scene -- they weren't fresh.
Grissom: Yeah, well, she could've cased the place weeks ago and then remembered to wear gloves on the big night.
Catherine: Hey, Nick. So what's the word on the murder weapon?
Nick: Well, the swab from the head wound's at trace.
Grissom: And?
Nick: I'm on it.

Grissom: You and I have an appointment with our shrink.

Dr. Phillip Kane: Here. You twirl, I'll talk.

Dr. Phillip Kane: My son has little league in an hour. He's scared of the ball.
Grissom: You think this new bat's going to do the trick?

Catherine: Why don't you just talk with him?

Catherine: Dr. Kane, this girl was kidnapped at age four. Would she have any recollection of her prior life?
Dr. Phillip Kane: The theory of infantile amnesia suggests that we have no cognitive memory before the age of three but since Tammy -- or Melissa -- was taken from her biological parents at age four she may remember something of her former life.
Grissom: But these memories would be ... tenuous?
Dr. Phillip Kane: A sound or a smell might awaken some latent image or feeling but she'd have difficulty contextualizing these sensations.
Catherine: That's got to be frustrating.

Dr. Phillip Kane: And it's precisely that frustration which dominates this woman's present state of mind. Kidnapped children at that age tend to exhibit some degree of sociopathy as adults.
Catherine: Such as?
Grissom: Inability to feel guilt, compassion or love, right?
Dr. Phillip Kane: Correct. But the most defining characteristic is their instinct for survival. There's nothing that they won't do.
Catherine: Tammy Felton needs help. She may be a suspect, but she's also a victim.
Grissom: Cath, meet with her again. Ask open questions. 

Grissom: Thanks for your insights, Philip. I'll let you know how this unfolds.
Dr. Phillip Kane: Gil ... be careful. Sociopaths are dangerous because they don't function by the same... moral code as the rest of us.
Grissom: Welcome to my world.
CUT TO:

 
 
Sara: I checked with homicide again. They found no evidence of foul play.
Warrick: What about the husband -- is he still a suspect?
Sara: No motive. O'Riley spoke with friends and relatives. They were a loving couple.
Warrick: What about, uh ... life insurance policies?
Sara: No, and you're reaching.
Warrick: I'm not the one who's reaching here. 
Sara: We're scientists, right? We want answers, the satisfaction of certainty. I'm not ignoring scientific method. I'm just keeping an open mind. If we eliminate all the alternatives we're left with spontaneous combustion. That's exciting!
Warrick: That would be cool, but you've been jumping to conclusions from minute one.
Sara: She's a pile of ash.

Warrick: Well, I brought the ion detector. This will pick up even the smallest traces of hydrocarbon fumes.
Sara: Great.
Warrick: I don't care what the lab says. This puppy will reveal exactly what accelerant was used to start the fire.

Sara: Well?

Warrick: Nothing.

Greg Sanders:  Bye, baby.

Nick: Do you have the results on the swab yet?
Greg Sanders: Uh ...
Nick: Uh... from the dead guy at the pottery store? The coroner sent over a sample. You were supposed to analyze the mineral content.
Greg Sanders: Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. Grissom has just been running me around like a lapdog. I haven't had a chance.
Nick: Grissom's on a missing persons-- he hasn't sent you anything.
Greg Sanders: Did I say Grissom? No, I meant Catherine.
Nick: Oh, yeah. Catherine's working with me.
Greg Sanders: Oh. Well, what do you say we check out that swab then, huh?
Nick: Great.

Greg Sanders: Don't you ever goof off, huh? Do you ever get a little lost in life?
Nick: No.
Greg Sanders: Well, you should.

Greg Sanders: Okay...


Nick: Do you see the sparkly bits?
Greg Sanders: Fluorescent minerals. Interesting.

Greg Sanders: Here, do me a favor, will you? 

Greg Sanders: Put your nose down the scope. And, when you see the sparkling bits glow give a shout. 


Greg Sanders: Okay, ready?
Nick: Yeah, ready.


Greg Sanders: Lead.

Greg Sanders: Zinc.


Greg Sanders: Lithium. Anything?
Nick: Nothing yet.


Greg Sanders: Manganese.

Greg Sanders: Petroleum.


Greg Sanders: All right, how about this?
Nick: Whoa, whoa, whoa ... stop.
Greg Sanders: It's uranium.

Nick: Are you serious?
Greg Sanders: Simple quantum mechanics. When the molecule is bombarded with energy at a specific level the electrons excite, causing the mineral to glow. And, at this wavelength, it's definitely uranium.
Nick: Which is radioactive. Do we need to evacuate the building or anything?
Greg Sanders: The amount is trace. We should be fine.
Nick: You sure?
Greg Sanders: No.

Greg Sanders: But I can tell you one thing for sure -- there is definitely uranium on your murder weapon.
CUT TO:

 
 
Grissom: I hear that, uh, Greg found uranium on the swab from Felton's skull.
Nick: Yeah. He says I'm okay, but you know Greg. Tell me, am I radiating a green glow?
Grissom: You'll be fine, silkwood.
Nick: What's uranium doing on a murder weapon anyway?
Grissom: Well, before Peter Parker was bit by that radioactive spider and became spider-man back in the '50s oxidized uranium flecks were used as color enhancers.
Nick: Color enhancers?
Grissom: Like paint? Paints, dyes, glazes... since our guy was killed in a pottery store...
Nick: Say no more.

Mrs. Marlowe: What kind of crime?
Grissom: A homicide.
Mrs. Marlowe: This can't be happening.
Hank Marlowe: Mr. Grissom, we want to see our daughter-- now.

Melissa Marlowe/Tammy Felton: Only child.

Warrick: Miss Piggy.

Sara: We're experimenting on a pig again?
Warrick: Yeah.

Sara:  You know, I-I-I haven't eaten meat since Grissom used one to estimate postmortem insect growth.
Warrick: Well, I tried for human volunteers, but no takers.
Sara: What are you going to do, exactly?

Warrick: What are we going to do? We're disproving the existence of spontaneous human combustion.
Sara:  You do not give up.
Warrick: Well, we're recreating the death of Nadine Winston, right? She was wearing a cotton nightgown -- thank you -- and she had a half a pack of smokes on her end table, which means she was probably smoking a cigarette.
Sara: If she burned herself with the cigarette, she would've woken up, not burned up.
Warrick: Best part: Toxicology sample came back. Nadine had a high concentration of seconal in her blood.

Dr. Phillip Kane: Quite possible. Two personalities in one.
Brass: Is there any scientific evidence that supports this disorder?
Grissom: Brain scans have documented changes in the hippocampus of individuals shifting from one personality to another. But would these two personalities be aware of each other?
Dr. Phillip Kane: Well, usually the dominant personality is aware of everything. The subjugated personality is only aware of itself.
Grissom: Tammy's the dominant personality.
Catherine: But Melissa killed Joseph Felton -- Tammy's father.
Grissom: Who was also Melissa's kidnapper.
Brass: Revenge for a kidnapping 21 years after the fact?

Grissom: I just got back to the lab, saw the smoke. What's up?
Sara: We're just working the case.
Warrick: Yeah, we're disproving spontaneous human combustion. We dressed the pig up in a cotton dress and torched it with a cigarette.
Grissom: And what happened?
Warrick: The pig's been reduced to ash. The fat acted like candle wax; burned hot, slow and intense. 

Warrick: Nothing spontaneous about it.
Grissom: You both knew that there'd be a scientific explanation for the human torch though, right?

Warrick: Of course.

Grissom: Did you find the wick?

Sara: The wick?
Warrick: The what?
Grissom: A piece of fabric that's scorched but not completely burned ... like possibly from the nightgown.

Sara: We found the same thing at the crime scene.
Grissom: It's called the wick effect. It's like an inside-out candle. The fabric acts like a wick, and the body burns inward explaining the high temperatures which destroy the bone. The fabric ends up scorched, but not completely burned.
Sara: You knew about the ashes? Why didn't you say something when you gave us the case?
Grissom: Well, in science we learn through experimentation, right? Sometimes we need to see it to believe it. You guys did a nice job. Now you have to clean it up.

Catherine: You have a lawyer. Why are you asking me?
Melissa Marlowe/Tammy Felton: You wanted to help me. When I I.D.'d Joe, you were kind. I need you to testify that I was not sane at the time that I killed Joe. My lawyer says that would go a really long way with a jury.
Catherine:  I'm not an expert.
Melissa Marlowe/Tammy Felton: But it doesn't matter. You spent time with me. You could answer questions the right way. I can't explain what happened in that room today but it's like ... the only memories I have are of being a little kid. The last 21 years are blank -- like they never happened. 
Catherine: Then you shouldn't have any memories of me ... Tammy. 

Catherine: There is no Melissa, is there?
Melissa Marlowe/Tammy Felton:  Get the hell out of here.
Catherine: I'm gone.

Melissa Marlowe/Tammy Felton:  Don't go! 

Melissa Marlowe/Tammy Felton:  Don't leave me here with her. 

Melissa Marlowe/Tammy Felton:  Just practicing for court. Not bad, huh?

Catherine: Guard.

CUT TO:


 
 
Catherine: Hey, come on. We're going to be late for the prelim.

Grissom: Tammy Felton's prelim has been postponed indefinitely.
Catherine: What? Why?
Grissom: She left town. Skipped bail.
Catherine:  How much did the parents lose?
Grissom: Their house and their life savings. 

Grissom: It's over. Case closed. We move on.

Catherine: Right.

CUT TO:

 
 
Catherine: Brass, it's Catherine. I need a credit card purchase report on the Marlowes. The last 24 hours. Based on what? Based on the fact that the Marlowes are blind when it comes to their daughter and would do anything for her.

CUT TO:



Hank Marlowe: We have no idea where she is.
Catherine: Look, you're here, she's not and we know that you helped her flee the jurisdiction.
Mrs. Marlowe: What?
Brass: 22 bus tickets bought with your credit card to 22 different states? You made sure that we couldn't track her. Now, that's aiding and abetting the flight of a suspected felon.
Catherine: Wherever you think she is -- wherever you're planning on meeting her -- she's not there. She played you. Now, if you'll just tell us where she is, we won't file charges, right?
Brass: Well, if she's apprehended, yes. Otherwise it's a felony. You're going to jail.

Mrs. Marlowe: Arrest us.
Catherine: Think about what you're doing.
Hank Marlowe: We know exactly what we're doing.
Mrs. Marlowe: Melissa's free. That's all that matters.
 
Brass: Frankie? 

Brass: You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.
CUT TO:





Darin Hanson: Am I late?
Melissa Marlowe/Tammy Felton: Oh, you're worth waiting for. 

Melissa Marlowe/Tammy Felton: You owe me one, Darin.
Darin Hanson: Owe you? I'm the one that told you the truth about your father.
Melissa Marlowe/Tammy Felton: And you knew exactly what I'd do about it.

Darin Hanson: Where to?
Melissa Marlowe/Tammy Felton: Does it matter?
Darin Hanson: Not in the least.
FADE TO BLACK.

<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>VARIOUS INTERCUT FLASHES OF</p>
<p>[INT. DANCE CLUB - DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[INT. DANCE CLUB - DANCE FLOOR -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(The club is filled with people at the bar, on the dance floor.) </p>
<p>[INT. PALERMO -- HOTEL ROOM - BEDROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The woman walks out of the bathroom in her underwear. The man sits on the bed in his shirts and shorts. The woman walks purposefully toward the man. She smiles at him.)</p>
<p>(She pushes him back on the bed and kisses him.) </p>
<p>[INT. DANCE CLUB - DANCE FLOOR -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(The club is rocking. At the front door, a man walks through and the metal detector beeps. The Security Guard stops him.)</p>
<p><strong>Security Guard</strong>: Whoa-whoa-whoa. What the hell is that?</p>
<p>(The Security Guard searches the Man and finds a switchblade knife on him. He opens it to show him. He confiscates the knife and lets the man through.)</p>
<p>(The Security Guard motions to the next man in line.)</p>
<p><strong>Security Guard</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p>(The Next Man in Line walks through the metal detector. The Security Guard motions to the next person in line.)</p>
<p><strong>Security Guard</strong>: All right. Keep coming.</p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
[EXT. DESERT - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Two people on motor bikes stop. They take off their helmets. One Man takes out a gun and fires three shots at the nearest sign. The sign reads:</p>
<p>WARNING<br />
RESTRICTED AREA<br />
It is unlawful to enter this area without permission of the installation commander. While on this installation, all persons and the property under their control are subject to search.<br />
MILITARY INSTALLATION<br />
Sec 27. Internal Security Act of 1957: U.S.C. 797 )</p>
<p>(The second man takes out his gun to fire. He aims and takes a couple steps forward and bumps into a body on the ground.)</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: What the -- ?</p>
<p>(They both look down and see the body on the ground.)</p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[INT. HOTEL ROOM - BEDROOM -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(A man sits down on the bed. He's crying.)</p>
<p>(In the bathroom, the faucet is on filling the tub up with water.)</p>
<p>(The man continues to cry.)</p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
[INT. DANCE CLUB - DANCE FLOOR -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(A person lights a match and sets a Polaroid photo on fire. He holds it up and lets the photo burn.)</p>
<p>(A man in a cap walks up to the doorway and greets the Man in a Suit familiarly.) </p>
<p><strong>Manny Brazil</strong>: Yo, Space! </p>
<p><strong>Space</strong>: My brother!</p>
<p><strong>Manny Brazil (club Owner)</strong>: Yo, yo, Man!</p>
<p>(Sirens start to blare.)</p>
<p><strong>Space</strong>: Yo, man. When's the blitz?</p>
<p>(Sirens in the club blare and get louder. The Man in the Suit turns around and smiles.)</p>
<p><strong>Manny Brazil (club Owner)</strong>: Right on time.</p>
<p>(The stage lights turn on and the club is filled with music. The crowd starts to dance where they stand.)</p>
<p>(As the music plays, the GUNMAN holding the burning photo takes out a gun, points it at a man nearby and shoots.)</p>
<p>(The Man falls down to the club floor.) </p>
<p>(The GUNMAN raises the gun and fires at the disco ball up above. He puts a hole in it. It bursts and sparks. The women in the club start screaming.)</p>
<p>[BULLET IN FLESH]</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV of: The bullet embedded in flesh. The camera moves slowly backward out from the bullet and pulls back out through the flesh and out through the DEAD MAN'S forehead.)</p>
<p>(Camera holds on the dead man on the floor with a single bullet gunshot hole in the center of his forehead.)</p>
<p>[RESUME VIEW]</p>
<p>(Brass looks down at the body and reports to Grissom also standing nearby looking down at the body.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So witnesses heard multiple gunshots. (He looks at Grissom.) They think. Because if it was during the Blitz. You know, the lights were out, sirens were going off, search lights, the whole world war ii experience.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: When exactly did war become a party?</p>
<p>(Brass shrugs.)</p>
<p>(Someone's pager beeps. Both Brass and Grissom check their pagers. Grissom's pager beeps. He checks it and sees:<br />
N419PC<br />
5311 SEPHILL RD.<br />
LAS VEGAS, NV<br />
BODY FOUND</p>
<p>(Grissom and Brass kneel down next to the body. Grissom points to the burn mark near the skin.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Gunshot residue, close range.</p>
<p>(Brass picks up the discarded shell off the floor.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: .32 auto. Belly got it.</p>
<p>(The metal detector beeps. Grissom looks back and sees an Officer stepping through the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How'd they get it through the metal detector?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, uh ... </p>
<p>(Brass's phone rings.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, geez.</p>
<p>(He checks his phone.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'll tell you, it's a busy night.</p>
<p>(Grissom finds the burned photo under the dead body. He smells the photo.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This was burned.</p>
<p>(He looks at the photo and sees that it's the photo of a dead body - with the head part burned off. Grissom shows the photo to Brass.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Another body?</p>
<p>(Grissom looks at the photo and notes the blood on the floor in the room near the body's feet.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Another murder.</p>
<p>SMASH CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - HALLWAY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Greg walks through the hallway with Chandra Moore, the new DNA Technician - his replacement.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: So, there's good news and there's bad news. The bad news is this is the busiest lab in the country.</p>
<p><strong>Chandra Moore</strong>: That's why I'm here.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Oh, I've waited for you forever. I love you!</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (o.s.) Man, if I ever have to search another torched car ... </p>
<p>(Nick walks into the hallway. He's wearing coveralls and irritated as heck.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Nick! </p>
<p>(Nick stops and looks back. Greg makes the introductions.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: This is Chandra. </p>
<p><strong>Chandra Moore</strong>: Chandra Moore.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Oh, yeah. Yeah, the new DNA girl. Right?</p>
<p>(He holds out his hand. She holds out hers. He bumps fists with her. A strange, new ritual for her.)</p>
<p><strong>Chandra Moore</strong>: B.S. in bio-chem. M.S. in molecular biology. Five years of service in DNA at the CCL.</p>
<p>(She smiles. Nick doesn't appear all that impressed.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: O-kay, well, I'm going to go use the no-pressure, no-AC, stinks-of-feet shower. So ... welcome.</p>
<p>(Nick turns and leaves.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - LOCKER ROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>[CLOSE-UP: SARA]</p>
<p>(Sara sighs.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So I had some time to think while I was away. Enough time to figure out why I made such a stupid mistake. I-I do not have a drinking problem. I have a, uh, me problem. </p>
<p>(Different angle. We see Sara talking to her reflection in the locker mirror - &quot;rehearsing&quot;.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: My P.E.A.P. Counselor suggested that it would be a good idea for me to talk to my supervisor and that's you, Grissom, so ... I never told you about my family. I never told anyone about my family, why would I ...</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (interrupts) Sara? </p>
<p>(Sara turns around and finds Greg and Chandra standing outside the locker room looking in from the hallway. Sara stands up.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I want you to meet my replacement. This is Chandra.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Nice to meet you, Chandra.</p>
<p><strong>Chandra Moore</strong>: Likewise.</p>
<p>(But not really. After a beat, Greg smiles at Sara. Chandra starts looking around the area waiting for Greg to move on.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (to Sara) So, how was it?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: How was what?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, you took some vacation time, right?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah, right. It was great.</p>
<p>(Chandra looks completely bored and not interested in Sara.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yeah? Okay.</p>
<p>(Greg motions for Chandra to follow him. Chandra nods at Sara - then follows.)</p>
<p>(Sara smiles back somewhat.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Greg walks up to someone.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Hey, how was it?</p>
<p>(Warrick walks up to them. He's wearing a suit, the tie loosened as if he's just come back from court.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It sucked. I hate lawyers, I hate court. They all need to dry up and die. (He looks at Chandra.) Hi.</p>
<p>(Chandra perks up.) </p>
<p><strong>Chandra Moore</strong>: Warrick, right?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Chandra Moore</strong>: I saw your presentation on longitudinal striations of the toenail in Dallas, A.A.F.S.? Really good work.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Thank you. Thank you so much. And you are?</p>
<p><strong>Chandra Moore</strong>: Oh, I'm Chandra. Chandra Moore. (Warrick glances at Greg.)<br />
I'm the new DNA person.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, that's the plan anyway. Would you like to see the boss's office?</p>
<p>(Greg leads Chandra away. She lingers wanting to talk more with Warrick, completely impressed by him.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>Chandra Moore</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Nice to meet you.</p>
<p>(Warrick walks away.) </p>
<p><strong>Chandra Moore</strong>: Same.</p>
<p>(Greg heads over to Grissom's office.) </p>
<p>[INT. CSI - GRISSOM'S OFFICE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Grissom ... I'd like to introduce you to Chandra Moore.</p>
<p>(Grissom turns around. He's wearing a hard hat-type of gizmo with a eye-glass piece attachment on the left side so he can look through it.)</p>
<p><strong>Chandra Moore</strong>: Pleased to meet you, sir. I'm a fan.</p>
<p>(Grissom looks up and down at Chandra through the eye piece.)</p>
<p>(Quick POV of: Grissom is looking at Chandra's heat print. Resume back to Grissom.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You're hot.</p>
<p><strong>Chandra Moore</strong>: (startled) I-I'm sorry?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You're emanating heat. (Grissom takes the hat off.) This is a new infrared camera. It's good for looking at evidence in the dark. (to Greg) Did you get her blood yet?</p>
<p><strong>Chandra Moore</strong>: My... (startled) ... why?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So many reasons.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (o.s.) Grissom! (Catherine walks into the office, walks past Greg and Chandra and straight up to Grissom.) (exasperated) You can't possibly call that thing my office. It's a cupboard.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Catherine, have you met Chandra Moore? She'll be doing DNA while Greg's in the field.</p>
<p>(Catherine hardly glances back at Chandra.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hello, I'm Catherine. (to Grissom) We need to talk.</p>
<p>(Grissom puts his glasses on and picks up a stack of assignment sheets.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, not now-- too much work. You have a suspicious death at the Palermo.</p>
<p>(He hands the assignment sheet to Catherine. She glares at him, grabs the sheet, turns and walks out of the office. Warrick walks into the office.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Warrick, trash call at a weekly at Fremont and 12th.</p>
<p>(Nick and Sara wait in the doorway for their assignments.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Nick, Sara, body in a shallow grave, dry lake bed, in Ely, off Groom Lake Road.</p>
<p>(Grissom hands the assignment sheet to Nick. He takes it and looks at it.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: All right. (to Sara) I'll meet you there. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Greg, you're going to be with me, your final proficiency.</p>
<p>(Grissom holds out the assignment sheet to Greg.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Great. (to Chandra) Let me show you to your new digs.</p>
<p>(Greg leads Chandra out of the office. As he passes by, Warrick wishes him luck.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (to Greg) Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to Greg) We leave in five minutes!</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (o.s.) Okay.</p>
<p>(Sara lingers just outside the doorway.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Can I talk to you real quick?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Certainly. Have you been seeing your P.E.A.P. Counselor?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (nods) Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How's it going?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, it's been interesting.</p>
<p>(There's a loud crash from the DNA lab. Glass breaks. Sara and Grissom look back at the lab and Greg looks sheepishly back at them through the glass wall. He points back at the mess.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (to Grissom) It's going to be a busy night, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mmm.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We'll talk later.</p>
<p>(Sara starts to leave. Oh, look, the white assignment board is back.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (nods) Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>(Sara leaves.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>[INT. PALERMO - HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Catherine pushes the hotel room door open and walks in. The suspect is covered in blood and yelling at Det. Vartann and an officer as Forensics tries to take a picture of the blood-soaked clothes.) </p>
<p><strong>Carl Johnson</strong>: I don't remember, okay? Why don't you believe me? CARL JOHNSON: I swear to god! I did nothing to that woman. I have never seen her before.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Relax, relax. </p>
<p>(Catherine looks into the bedroom and sees the dead woman on the bed. There's blood everywhere.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Let's just go over this again.</p>
<p><strong>Carl Johnson</strong>: All right, let's go over it again.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Tell me what you remember.</p>
<p><strong>Carl Johnson</strong>: Nothing. That's what I remember -- nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: That's it?</p>
<p><strong>Carl Johnson</strong>: (to Forensics) Stop taking my picture!</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Sir, wait here.</p>
<p>(Det. Vartann leaves the suspect and walks over to Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Hey. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Housecleaning found Mr. Johnson passed out on the bed next to the victim. They alerted security and apparently he just came to.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: With the worst hangover a guy could ever have.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Yeah. He's a golf ball salesman from Ohio.</p>
<p>(Catherine steps closer to the bed.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Massive hemorrhaging.</p>
<p>(She puts her kit down on the floor.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Is this from a single wound? Cracked skull. Did you I.D. her?</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: No I.D. on her.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, she's got some breast implants. That's for sure.</p>
<p>(Catherine picks up the clear, see-through hand bag on the bed-side table.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm going to guess stripper. She's got a locker room key.</p>
<p>(The key number is #323.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We'll trace it back to the club.</p>
<p>(Det. Vartann looks around the room and notes the open refrigerator and alcohol.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Quite a party last night.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You can say that again.</p>
<p>(Catherine walks into the bathroom and sees more blood on the wall. She also finds the bathrod with some hair stuck to the bloodied tip.)</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: [EARLIER] Carl Johnson and The Stripper fight. Carl Johnson swings and hits the Stripper across the head. She staggers out of the bathroom, her head bloodied.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(Catherine looks around the room and back to the body on the bed.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Looks like she went back into the bedroom to call for help.</p>
<p>(Det. Vartann checks his notes.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Well, no calls were made from the room.</p>
<p>(Catherine looks around and takes a closer look at the toilet. She finds the urine on the floor in front of the bowl.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Why is it you guys can never hit the bowl?</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: You know, if this guy took viagra, you're lucky he hit the floor and not the ceiling.</p>
<p>(Det. Vartann looks up at the ceiling.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Right.</p>
<p>(Catherine picks up the bracelet found in the urine puddle. She holds it up.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Sign of a struggle?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: How does a guy fall asleep after killing a woman?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. DANCE CLUB -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Brass questions the Club Manager as the Coroners put the body on the gurney.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: How does somebody get into your club with a gun?</p>
<p><strong>Manny Brazil (club Owner)</strong>: Don't ask me; ask the metal detector. It's supposed to work.</p>
<p>(He takes a sip of his drink.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Ever see the dead guy before?</p>
<p><strong>Manny Brazil (club Owner)</strong>: No, not me. (He turns around and looks at the girl talking with the two officers.) Hey, Crystal! Hey, baby, you talk to the guy that got capped in your section tonight?</p>

<p>(Det. Travis leads them to the site. Sara turns back and looks at the people protesting. A couple of them are dressed in silver space suits complete with helmets.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. Travis</strong>: The weather's been pretty bad out here. I don't know if you're going to find much. A couple of teenagers were out here last night shooting off their dads' guns. One of them ... tripped over this thing.</p>
<p>(They reach the grave site.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: These kids thought they'd found a real space alien.</p>

<p><strong>Det. Travis</strong>: From what I understand, they're always out here. See this guy in the silver lamé? He put it on the &quot;watch the skies&quot; web site. It's been a freaking free-for-all ever since then. You know where you are, right?</p>
<p>(He points to his right, a vast expanse of dry land.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Area 51.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: That's almost four times the legal limit.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Chronic drinking tends to cause a reduction in platelets. It thins out the blood and retards clotting.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: That would explain why there was so much blood at the scene.</p>

<p><strong>Chandra Moore</strong>: They all want ... they all want you, and I can't be you. </p>
<p>(Chandra turns and leaves.)</p>
<p><strong>Chandra Moore</strong>: (o.s.) I'm going back to Connecticut.</p>
<p>(From the lab doorway, Warrick holds out a bill. Nick takes it.)</p>
<p>(Greg glances over at the two of them. Warrick shrugs at him.)</p>
<p>(Greg nods knowingly and looks down. What a day.)</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK</p>

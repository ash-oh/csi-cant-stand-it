<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS STREETS (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[INT. CASINO - MAIN FLOOR - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(A large man in a leather jacket and sporting a beard walks into the casino. He stops in the aisle and looks around. Most of the people continue about their business without sparing him a second glance.)</p>
<p>(He sees something across the room and heads straight for it. He turns through the aisle and barrels into an elderly man, pushing him aside.)</p>
<p><strong>Tony Sciarra</strong>: (mutters) Get out of the way!</p>
<p>(The man continues walking across the room and we see that he's following someone who really isn't noticing that he's being targeted.) </p>
<p>(The MAN in the blue shirt walks past the various displays.)</p>
<p>The MAN in the leather jacket continues to follow him. He turns the corner and sees the door &quot;TO PARKING&quot; closing shut. He pauses a moment getting angrier by the second. Suddenly he moves forward, kicks the door open and walks through into the parking structure.)</p>
<p>FLASH TO BLACK.</p>
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>(BRASS and GRISSOM kneel over the body of the late TONY SCIARRA, the man in the leather jacket.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Wow, that had to hurt.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM reaches into the leather jacket pocket and pulls out several chips.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, robbery wasn't a motive.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: His eyes took the brunt of the punishment.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: If you can't see, you can't fight back.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM notices the blood under the man's finger nails along with several strands of light-colored hair.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No. But he may have tried.</p>
<p>(BRASS reaches into the jacket pocket and pulls out a PENNSYLVANIA DRIVER'S LICENSE. It reads:</p>
<p>TONY SCIARRA<br />
7259 W. PORT ST.<br />
PHILADELPHIA PA 19078</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Tony Sciarra. From Philadelphia.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So much for brotherly love.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks up at BRASS.)</p>
<p>FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[INT. CASINO PARKING STRUCTURE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(The camera flashes. WARRICK snaps photos while CATHERINE gathers evidence. She picks up a tooth off the floor and puts it in a bindle. She picks up the second tooth and puts it in another bindle. They work quietly and efficiently.) </p>
<p>[CASINO HALLWAY TO PARKING LOT -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(GRISSOM stands just inside the doorway to the parking lot looking out through the open door over the crime scene tape to where the body is. He turns when BRASS starts to report his findings.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Our victim Tony just checked into the hotel. He hadn't even unpacked.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He made enemies fast.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, old man at the casino, who he knocked down, said the same thing. He was hauling ass.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Why?</p>
<p>[PARKING STRUCTURE]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE shines her flashlight on the blood-spattered wall. She turns and gets a swab to take a sample of the blood on the floor next to TONY SCIARRA'S head.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Blood drops are medium to large. Low-velocity spatter. No castoff.</p>
<p>(WARRICK watches from the side.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Maybe he wasn't beaten with a weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hand to hand?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I know this guy's yoked. He's what? 6'2&quot;? 6'3&quot;?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Size doesn't matter when you're outnumbered.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: TONY SCIARRA'S on the floor being held while he's being punched repeatedly in the face.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(WARRICK leans over and gets a good look at the battered face.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p>(He leans over and snaps a photo.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CASINO - SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(SARA and NICK review the security camera video. On it, they see TONY SCIARRA bump into an old man and push him aside. He continues down the aisle.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Here's our vic. Leaving the floor.</p>
<p><strong>Surveillance Tech</strong>: And the cameras. No eyes in the corridors or the rest rooms.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, well, we know where he went. Just show us where he came from, please.</p>
<p>(The SURVEILLANCE TECH rewinds the tape and they see TONY SCIARRA over at the crap table. He stands next to a man in a blue shirt.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Whoa. Whoa. That's good. Start it from right there.</p>
<p>(They stop rewinding the tape. The tape plays and they watch as the man in the blue shirt grabs a chip off TONY SCIARRA'S pile.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Did you see that?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, the little guy on the right just snaked him.</p>
<p>(They watch as TONY SCIARRA rolls again and the man in the blue shirt grabs another chip off of his pile.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You've got to be kidding me. He just did it again.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Two for two.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: That guy has got stones going after a mark as big as Tony.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: He knows he has backup. Is the third time a charm?</p>
<p>(The tape continues and they watch as the man in the blue shirt lifts another chip off of TONY'S pile.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yes, it is.</p>
<p>(TONY notices the slight.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Busted.</p>
<p>(On the monitor, they watch as the two men have words with each other.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Accusations from Tony. He's getting hot.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Some kind of denial from the little guy.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Tony got worked. Just wanted his money back.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We're going to need a still of the little guy's face, if you could.</p>
<p><strong>Surveillance Tech</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p>(Camera moves in on the man in the blue shirt standing at the craps table.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Open on the monitor of TONY SCIARRA'S beaten face. DR. ALBERT ROBBINS goes over the preliminary findings with GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Fractures to the zygomatic, ethmoidal, nasal bones. Also the mandible and maxilla. How many teeth did you find at the scene? </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Two.</p>
<p>(DR. ALBERT ROBBINS pries open the lips and shows the missing teeth to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: He's missing six. I found one in the back of his mouth. He probably swallowed the other three. I'll check his stomach.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Blood evidence at the scene suggests that his attackers did not use a weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Contusions are nondescript. No foreign tool marks.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Bare knuckles?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: That's what I'm thinking. Multiple blows to the head produced angular acceleration and deceleration in the brain.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI flashback to: TONY SCIARRA'S on the floor. The man hits his head with his fist. A CGI view of TONY'S brains jiggle upon impact.)</p>
<p>(Slow motion of another hit to TONY'S head. Blood spurts from his mouth.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: (V.O.) Twisting of the brain causes the bridging veins to rip. From there it's all downhill. The axons within the white matter of the brain begin to snap.</p>
<p>(Camera zooms into TONY'S head to show us a lovely graphic shot of the bridging veins ripping. Lovely.)</p>
<p>(End of CGI flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Officially, COD is diffuse axonal injury. Unofficially ... it's the most brutal beating I've ever seen.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM places his left hand over the bruise pattern on the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Neck bruises were made by a left hand?</p>
<p>(He points to another set of bruises.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What about these bruises?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Well, there's no defensive wounds on the hands or forearm. So I'm guessing it was restrained. Bruises could be somebody's knees on his chest.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So a hand on his throat, knees on his chest, his head was butted up against a wall, and all the blows were directed at his face.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: That doesn't leave much room for any other attackers to get their licks in.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Maybe there were no other attackers.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: A hallway view of one man beating the crap out of TONY SCIARRA while holding him down on the floor. TONY grunts and groans with each hit.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: One guy did all this?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. HOTEL / CASINO - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(BRASS questions HOUSEKEEPER. He shows her the surveillance video photo of the man in the blue shirt at the craps table.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So you're sure this was the man you saw?</p>
<p><strong>Housekeeper</strong>: Yes. I was in the bathroom.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [BATHROOM] The MAN IN THE BLUE SHIRT walks past the bathroom. He goes over to the sink and washes his hands. Standing on the side, she watches him.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Housekeeper</strong>: I waited for him to leave. Then I called security.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Do you see this man now?</p>
<p>(She hesitates.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: All you have to do is nod.</p>
<p>(She looks around the room and sees the back of the man's head. He's wearing a white shirt and sitting at the table. She nods.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>(They turn and look at the man at the table immediately recognizing him. NICK whispers to BRASS.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: ID's off. We're looking for a blue shirt and jeans.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: He could have ditched the clothes. Let's be smart about this.</p>
<p>[COFFEE SHOP - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(BRASS opens the door to the coffee shop and walks inside. NICK and a couple of officers follow him. They walk up to the man. They notice the missing hair and blood smears on his skin behind his ear.)</p>
<p>(BRASS stops behind them man.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Las Vegas Police. Put your hands behind your head and stand up.</p>
<p>(The man pauses from taking a bite of his burger. He doesn't move.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p>(The man puts his burger down. He stands up and puts his hands behind his head. The OFFICER grabs him and puts the cuffs on him.)</p>
<p>(In the process he turns the man around. He looks at BRASS and sneers.)</p>
<p>(The officer leads the MAN away. BRASS watches them go.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(BRASS interviews WALTER DARIAN. GRISSOM stands on the side and watches. BRASS walks up to WALTER DARIAN and speaks in a low voice into the DARIAN'S ear.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You're not much of a talker, are you, Walter?</p>
<p>(He leans in close and continues talking. WALKTER DARIAN doesn't move.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'll tell you. You must be a pretty tough guy to take on Tony. A guy as big as that? He's huge. That's his name, you know? Tony Sciarro from Philadelphia.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM watches the exchange.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Do you know Tony? How come you left his wallet and $500 in chips in his pocket, huh? That makes me think that this was about something else.</p>
<p>(WALTER DARIAN clenches his handcuffed fists. BRASS continues.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Did he ... wrong you in some way? He hurt you?</p>
<p>(WALTER DARIAN doesn't answer.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p>(BRASS steps back.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Maybe it was just a ... lover's quarrel.</p>
<p><strong>Walter Darian</strong>: I'm not soft.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: That's okay. This is Vegas. But that's not what we saw on the video. You're at the crap table. You swiped his chips. And then you whispered sweet nothings in his ear. What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>Walter Darian</strong>: Give me a reason.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: That a confession?</p>
<p><strong>Walter Darian</strong>: No. (He turns to look at BRASS.) That's what I said.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: That stare doesn't work on me. But save it. Because they're going to love you in prison.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mr. Darian, may I see your fingers?</p>
<p><strong>Walter Darian</strong>: Why?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM steps forward and places a clean sheet of paper under WALTER DARIAN'S hands.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, because you may have evidence underneath the fingernails, and I'd like to collect it.</p>
<p>(He reaches out and grabs his hand and suddenly lets go as if burned. GRISSOM takes a step back. WALTER DARIAN glances at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at BRASS who edges closer to WALTER DARIAN just in case something happens.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM cautiously reaches out again and takes ahold of WALTER DARIAN'S hand as he prepares to scrape under his fingernails.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mr. Darian, do you have a fever?</p>
<p>(WALTER DARIAN'S eyes grow wide as GRISSOM scrapes under his fingernails. GRISSOM glances at him several times and continues to scrape.)</p>
<p>(Suddenly, DARIAN yells and lunges out of his seat. He goes for GRISSOM'S neck, pushing him back all the way to the wall.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hey! Hey! WALTER DARIAN: I'll kill you.</p>
<p>(BRASS pries DARIAN off of GRISSOM. The other OFFICERS join in trying to subdue DARIAN. He pushes back and one of the OFFICERS hits the glass wall shattering it. He pushes another OFFICER off of him and down to the floor.)</p>
<p>(WALTER DARIAN puts up a fight. There's an OFFICER holding him from behind, but he still manages to hit and push away the other THREE OFFICERS. He screams and grunts.)</p>
<p>(Finally, an OFFICER takes out his club and starts hitting him into submission.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Down. Down. OFFICER: Down. Down.</p>
<p>(BRASS stands to the side and watches. GRISSOM stands in the back and watches. WALTER DARIAN slowly goes down to the floor, grunting along the way. Finally, he's quiet.)</p>
<p>(BRASS checks DARIAN'S neck for a pulse.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Jeez.</p>
<p>(He can't find any.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM watches from the back.)</p>
<p>FADE OUT</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM] </p>
<p>(DAVID PHILLIPS sticks the meat thermometer into the deceased's liver. The temperature reads 101.5. CATHERINE glances at DAVID.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You might want to check that.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: I did.</p>
<p>(He picks up his pen and notates the final findings on the paper. CATHERINE sees something and stands up. She sees GRISSOM standing quietly to the side, leaning against the wall, a hand rubbing the back of his neck. Quietly freaked.)</p>
<p>[HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(SHERIFF RORY ATWATER arrives. He's also rubbing the back of his own neck. He heads toward BRASS who's leaning a shoulder up against the wall.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: It's not as bad as it looks.</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Rory Atwater</strong>: It never looks too good when a suspects dies in custody.</p>
<p>(The SHERIFF sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What are you saying, Rory? You'd rather it be one of us?</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Rory Atwater</strong>: No, that's not what I'm saying. If I was here, I'd have been in there with you, you know that. (He paces the floor.) I assume we're going to come out looking like the bad guy again.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE steps out into the hallway. She notes the SHERIFF talking with BRASS. They both note her as she looks at them. She heads over to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p>(He stops rubbing his neck and waves away her concern.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm fine.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE reaches out and looks at the reddish-burn/bruise on GRISSOM'S neck.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Nasty. That kind of looks like a hickey. (She sighs.) You want to tell me what got this party started?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I scraped his nails.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: That's it?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What was his liver temp?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: 101.5.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He's been dead an hour. That means his body temperature was 103. I touched his skin, Catherine. He felt like he was on fire.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - GARAGE]</p>
<p>(SARA and NICK stand just outside WALTER DARIAN'S car. It is packed with stuff. Stuff, stuff and more stuff.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: How did Walter Darian even drive this thing?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Where there's a will, there's a way. PD found it in the Orpheus parking lot.</p>
<p>(They open the car door and sees the blood-stained clothes.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Blue shirt and jeans right on top. (She picks it up.) He didn't even try to hide them.</p>
<p>(She tests the blood for blood.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Positive for blood. I'll get it to Greg.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So this scumbag, Walter Darian, he beats a guy to death, goes out to his car, changes clothes and then goes back into the casino, washes his hands and just gets something to eat.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Just another day.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p>(NICK turns and looks inside a box in the car. It's filled with chips. NICK'S impressed.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Whoa ... yahtzee.</p>
<p>(He takes the box out of the car and puts it on the table. He opens it and looks at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Whoa. Must be a few thousand dollars' worth of chips here.</p>
<p>(He picks up a couple of chips.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So, he grifts, but doesn't cash in?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Maybe it wasn't about the money. I got gloves, a t-shirt and a jacket all with the tags still on them. Maybe he just likes to steal things.</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Caucasian.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Mm. Around 5'4&quot;. I estimated her height from the length of the femur.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: How old are we talking?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Well ... third molars haven't erupted. No wisdom teeth.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So that would put her in her late teens, early 20s.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Eh, it's a safe estimate.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Did Walter give you those burns?</p>
<p><strong>Beth Darian</strong>: No, that was, uh ... an accident on the job many, many years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: When you used to be a waitress, Libby?</p>
<p><strong>Beth Darian</strong>: Nobody's called me that in years. How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We found your old waitress uniform in Walter's car.</p>
<p><strong>Beth Darian</strong>: I, I had that job for one day. I was a lousy waitress. Why would he keep that?</p>
<p>(Outside, the bus stops in front of the house, the door opens and kids exit the bus. A cute blonde-haired kid runs out of the bus and into the house.)</p>
<p><strong>Martin Darian</strong>: Hi, mom.</p>
<p><strong>Beth Darian</strong>: Hey, baby. </p>
<p>(MARTIN DARIAN gives his mom a hug; she kisses him on the cheek.)</p>
<p><strong>Beth Darian</strong>: Why don't you take your stuff and put it in your room? I'll make you a snack.</p>
<p>(He turns and looks at the CSIs.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How old is that little guy?</p>
<p><strong>Beth Darian</strong>: He's going to be nine next month.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE takes a swab sample from MARTIN.)</p>
<p>[HALLWAY]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes a swab sample from SEAN CLEARY. GRISSOM caps the sample and steps aside. SEAN CLEARY looks into the room at MARTIN who turns and looks at him.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE puts the test results on the table as she and GRISSOM re-interview BETH DARIAN.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You're not his mother.</p>
<p><strong>Beth Darian</strong>: I'm the only mother he's ever known. I raised him; I had to.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [BETH'S HOUSE] She's sitting in the living room reading a book when WALTER pounds on the door. She can hear a baby crying.)</p>
<p>(She opens the door and WALTER walks in carrying the baby. He gives the baby to her, then walks out.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Middle of the night, your brother shows up and hands you a baby. You don't ask any questions. You don't report it.</p>
<p><strong>Beth Darian</strong>: Walter said that the mother was a runaway, and that she didn't want the baby. I took him in. I love him.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How did Martin get the scar on his forehead?</p>
<p><strong>Beth Darian</strong>: I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Or you didn't want to know.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [MOTEL ROOM] MARISSA'S on the bed, her eyes wide-open. WALTER holds the knife up high.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE shows BETH the note.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Marissa Cleary didn't sign that note.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And we don't think Walter wrote it, either.</p>
<p><strong>Beth Darian</strong>: I'm not like Walter. When I opened the suitcase, and I saw the photograph ... I didn't want the father to suffer. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [BETH'S PLACE] BETH is sitting at her desk typing out a note on the computer. She looks down at both halves of the photo on the desk along with MARISSA'S driver's license..)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The suitcase was in Walter's closet. </p>
<p><strong>Beth Darian</strong>: I took it back. I didn't want it around me. I knew that he would never notice. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE gives GRISSOM a &quot;I can't believe this&quot; look.)</p>
<p><strong>Beth Darian</strong>: Giving me Martin ... was the only good thing that Walter ever did. I don't know why he did it. But it wasn't out of the goodness of his heart.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY/ LAB]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM rounds the corner. He's reading a file folder on his way to the lab. He walks into the lab now cluttered with boxed and packaged evidence from WALTER DARIAN'S MOTEL.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM puts the file folder down on the table. He picks up a pair of latex gloves and puts them on. He opens the first package and removes a white bloody shirt and starts examining it.)</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>

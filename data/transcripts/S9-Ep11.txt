							<p>That's quite a kit you got there, Ray.</p>
<p>Well, it's my first official shift. I want to be prepared.</p>
<p>Your training coordinator said that you were very thorough.</p>
<p>Add this to your checklist-- whenever you're on call, keep a pen and paper near your bed, along with a change of clothes, a ball cap, bottled water, sunblock, and make sure you got a Thomas Guide inside your vehicle, in case your GPS crashes.</p>
<p>You don't want your evidence degrading as you're scrambling to get your act together.</p>
<p>Got it.</p>
<p>Ready to roll?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Dr. Langston, welcome aboard.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>406 on the east side. Ray's with you.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Enjoy.</p>
<p>406-- burglary.</p>
<p>Yeah, a little bread and butter crime'll be the perfect thing to get your feet wet. Come on.</p>
<p>You know you're not reqred to wear a tie unless you're in court, right?</p>
<p>Yes, I know.</p>
<p>Something wrong with wearing a tie?</p>
<p>No, no.</p>
<p>What's going on, Akers?</p>
<p>Owner got home from work an hour ago, found the window smashed.</p>
<p>His wife's jewelry is gone, along with a laptop and his watch.</p>
<p>Where's the wife?</p>
<p>Out of town with their daughter.</p>
<p>The husband's inside.</p>
<p>What the hell was that?</p>
<p>You'll know as soon as I do.</p>
<p>Why don't you, uh, go ahead inside and get started on the overalls, yeah?</p>
<p>Repeat the 20 on the 445 call.</p>
<p>Dispatch, this is Charlie 0-5 Stokes.</p>
<p>No, no, there's nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>I'm fine.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I do, I feel violated, but the police are taking care of everything.</p>
<p>That fireball was a private residence near Sunrise Mountain.</p>
<p>Arson-Explosives is already on the way.</p>
<p>Are we on our way there, too?</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, we'll be done with this before the fire's even out.</p>
<p>Just, uh, print the point of entry and collect everything else.</p>
<p>I love you, too, honey.</p>
<p>Sir, you want to show me where those stolen items were taken from?</p>
<p>I got to go. Right this way.</p>
<p>My laptop was right here, my watch right there, and my wife's jewelry box-- they completely cleaned that out.</p>
<p>They didn't even bother to ransack the place.</p>
<p>Just went straight for the good stuff.</p>
<p>And my wife's grandmother's ring was in there, her mother's cameo.</p>
<p>They really cleaned the thing out.</p>
<p>Write down everything that was stolen and fax that form back to us.</p>
<p>Be sure and keep a copy for your insurance, okay?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What'd you do, try to use all of 'em?</p>
<p>In the field, you really only need three powders: black, magnetic, and dragon's blood.</p>
<p>If you can't get a print off one of those, you're better off just taking it back to the lab.</p>
<p>It just kept breaking up.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Doorknob's already toast; let's work on the glass.</p>
<p>Now, don't do this if you ever need touch DNA, but in a pinch...</p>
<p>The water vapor from your breath will adhere to the salt and lipids in a latent print.</p>
<p>It revitalizes it.</p>
<p>Then you take a little dust-- just a little.</p>
<p>Gently.</p>
<p>It's all in the wrist.</p>
<p>A colleague of mine once told me if I found myself in this part of town, I should drive very fast.</p>
<p>Well, that's pretty good advice.</p>
<p>We get about half a dozen calls out here a week.</p>
<p>There is a little no-tell motel around here somewhere.</p>
<p>We found a corpse underneath a bed.</p>
<p>It'd been there for about four days.</p>
<p>People just went right on using the room till it was too ripe to ignore.</p>
<p>Did you catch the guy who did it?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, we did eventually.</p>
<p>Then that's a good story.</p>
<p>Dispatch, Charlie 0-5 Stokes and Charlie 0-8</p>
<p>Langston, reporting 402-419 Sunrise Mountain.</p>
<p>How's the first day of school going, Professor?</p>
<p>I'll, uh, tell you at recess.</p>
<p>The arson investigator ran dogs through the scene.</p>
<p>They didn't find any accelerant.</p>
<p>Doesn't rule out arson.</p>
<p>What's with the construction equipment out front?</p>
<p>Were the owners remodeling or something?</p>
<p>Well, the place belongs to Don and Paulla Kingsley.</p>
<p>They live here alone.</p>
<p>I got a call out to both of them.</p>
<p>I bet only one of them calls me back.</p>
<p>CSI Season09</p>
<p>Episode11 The Grave Shift So where'd it all go?</p>
<p>I can't imagine Grissom being entirely happy without his irradiated fetal pig.</p>
<p>He asked me to send a couple things to the research station in Costa Rica, and... the rest is just going into storage at his place.</p>
<p>Hmm, so he didn't sell his home?</p>
<p>A condo in Vegas? That's 50 cents on the dollar at this point.</p>
<p>Ye, tell me about it.</p>
<p>Well, you got a blank canvas.</p>
<p>You're senior supervisor.</p>
<p>It's your office now.</p>
<p>Oh, I like the one I have.</p>
<p>Catherine, if you don't want it, fine.</p>
<p>But you can't leave it empty, all right?</p>
<p>We don't have the space for a shrine.</p>
<p>Paulla Kingsley?</p>
<p>It's gone. It's all gone.</p>
<p>Paulla Kingsley?</p>
<p>I'm Mrs. Kingsley's assistant Carla Banks.</p>
<p>I didn't want her to drive herself.</p>
<p>I need Don. W-Where's Don?</p>
<p>We're not sure, mam.</p>
<p>He's, he's not-- was he inside?</p>
<p>We found someone inside. It's going to take a while before we find out who that is.</p>
<p>Mrs. Kingsley, I'm Detective Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police.</p>
<p>Do you mind if I ask you a qution?</p>
<p>According to the fire department, this isn't their first time out here.</p>
<p>You called 911 about six weeks ago when your husband overdosed on secobarbital. Is that right?</p>
<p>Oh, my God. Don.</p>
<p>This looks like it was the laundry room.</p>
<p>Everything's displaced outward... from this point.</p>
<p>Blast originated here.</p>
<p>Sooting indicates the water heater inlet was unhooked during the fire.</p>
<p>Maybe it got torn off by the blast.</p>
<p>If that were the case, the threads would be stripped and they're not.</p>
<p>That's the natural gas line hookup right there.</p>
<p>See if that valve's open or closed for me, would you?</p>
<p>It's open.</p>
<p>If at first you don't succeed...</p>
<p>So would you say that Don Kingsley was having emotional problems?</p>
<p>Yeah, Mr. Kingsley was depressed.</p>
<p>They'd been having some difficulties.</p>
<p>What kind of difficulties?</p>
<p>Financial.</p>
<p>Where was Mrs. Kingsley last night?</p>
<p>At the gym. Buff &amp; Tuff Fitness Center.</p>
<p>Well, the fire started just after midnight.</p>
<p>Does she usually work out that late?</p>
<p>No. She owns the franchise.</p>
<p>Six locations in Las Vegas. Open 24/7.</p>
<p>So we're going to need the name of Mr. Kingsley's dentist.</p>
<p>Can you help me with that?</p>
<p>Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>Aren't we required to run DNA on the victim?</p>
<p>We're only required to confirm I.D.</p>
<p>Fires sometimes destroy known exemplars.</p>
<p>Dental records are just quicker.</p>
<p>Well, I bet you've never seen one of those in the hospital before, huh?</p>
<p>Once. He was still screaming.</p>
<p>Okay, we're ready.</p>
<p>Now remember, lift with your legs. On three.</p>
<p>One, two, three.</p>
<p>Here you go. I'll take that.</p>
<p>You okay?</p>
<p>I'm fine.</p>
<p>Again?</p>
<p>Let's go.</p>
<p>One, two, three.</p>
<p>Whoa, the bones feel... crumbly.</p>
<p>Like they were... shattered.</p>
<p>That's what happens when they're in the oven too long.</p>
<p>What should we do about that?</p>
<p>It could have trace from the body?</p>
<p>Yes, sir.</p>
<p>It's evidence?</p>
<p>Do you have a pair of scissors I could borrow?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p><em>WILL BE BACK IN 1 HOUR</em></p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>David Hodges, right?</p>
<p>I need to, um...</p>
<p>You need to log that in with the evidence clerk first.</p>
<p>And then he will distribute it to the appropriate lab.</p>
<p>Right-- the evidence clerk isn't there.</p>
<p>Yeah, he never is.</p>
<p>And that's your problem.</p>
<p>Okay... fine.</p>
<p>So, now, I'll do his job.</p>
<p>May I help you?</p>
<p>Just check it in.</p>
<p>Fill out this form.</p>
<p>Well, you certainly have a doctor's handwriting.</p>
<p>Next time, print.</p>
<p>There you are, Professor.</p>
<p>Nick stuck me with your 406.</p>
<p>Doesn't get you off of it.</p>
<p>I'll meet you in the A.V.Lab.</p>
<p>The laptop on the stolen property list has a cell phone card in it with G.P.S.</p>
<p>That means we can track it.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, we are in luck.</p>
<p>This laptop's on a mesh network right now.</p>
<p>You bought my book.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Did you read it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Guess that makes you one of the few.</p>
<p>I got an address.</p>
<p>If you're looking for drugs, you're not going to find any.</p>
<p>My sons not into that stuff. Right, Alex?</p>
<p>We're not looking for drugs, sir.</p>
<p>Mr. Palento, what's back here?</p>
<p>His bedroom.</p>
<p>Yes, it's on the list.</p>
<p>Where'd it come from?</p>
<p>I don't know; I found it.</p>
<p>Where?</p>
<p>I can't remember exactly.</p>
<p>Alex, if you're screwing with me, you're in serious trouble.</p>
<p>You find these things, too?</p>
<p>Some kids in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>They gave them to me.</p>
<p>Like who?</p>
<p>I can't remember.</p>
<p>Your son could easily be going out at night and having other people come in without your knowledge.</p>
<p>No, no, no, I keep that alley gate locked. He doesn't have a key.</p>
<p>Where'd you get that stuff?</p>
<p>What difference does it make?</p>
<p>That's not an answer!</p>
<p>That's not necessary.</p>
<p>Oh, you don't approve?</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, I don't.</p>
<p>Do you have any idea what it's like to be a single father in this town?</p>
<p>I got two friends who had their kids O.D.on them.</p>
<p>Don't you tell m how to handle my son.</p>
<p>We wouldn't dream of it, sir.</p>
<p>I apologize if we overstepped.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>What, it's not our job to protect him?</p>
<p>His father let us in here without a warrant, and he wasn't breaking any laws.</p>
<p>We're here to collect evidence.</p>
<p>We're not social workers.</p>
<p>You see the &quot;Ma...&quot;?</p>
<p>My guess is the glass came from a Mason jar.</p>
<p>My wife uses them to make fruit preserves.</p>
<p>Oh, well, I doubt this guy was canning explosive peaches.</p>
<p>I hope I haven't missed all the fun stuff.</p>
<p>Hello, Doctor.My name is-- - Ray Langston, I know. Albert Robbins.</p>
<p>Always happy to meet a fellow sawbones.</p>
<p>You've already met Don Kingsley.</p>
<p>And that is shrapnel from the explosion.</p>
<p>And what's this yellow residue?</p>
<p>That's not my department. I sent a sample to Hodges. He's in Trace.</p>
<p>We've met.</p>
<p>Glass shards are only his feet and lower legs.</p>
<p>I was just about to dissect his trachea.</p>
<p>Care to do the honors?</p>
<p>It's been a while since I cut.</p>
<p>Eh, it's like destroying a bicycle-- come on.</p>
<p>No soot.</p>
<p>This man wasn't breathing while the fire was burning.</p>
<p>So, he croaked before he cooked.</p>
<p>Well, that would explain the calvarium.</p>
<p>It's cracked along the sutures. Is that from the fire?</p>
<p>Well, it gets hot enough to boil a brain, the, uh, steam has to get out somehow.</p>
<p>That's not what I was going to show you.</p>
<p>Subdural hematoma.</p>
<p>So, he was clocked before he croaked and cooked.</p>
<p>Congratulations, Ray.</p>
<p>Your first arson has become your first homicide.</p>
<p>Somebody could've hit him with this.</p>
<p>Yeah? Add about just anything else in here that didn't get burned up or washed away.</p>
<p>Okay, we should bag everything that might have been used as a weapon or a remote or a delayed ignition source.</p>
<p>Since it's pretty obvious the arsonist wasn't in here when this place went up.</p>
<p>All right. Piece of cake.</p>

<p>Excuse me, sir?</p>
<p>You, uh, mind if I ask what you're doing here?</p>
<p>Documenting my losses.</p>
<p>Your losses?</p>
<p>I'm Josh Barston. The Kingsleys' contractor. All that gear is mine.</p>
<p>Luckily, it's insured.</p>
<p>Did you do all the construction here?</p>
<p>Yep. Everything's up to code. I got all the permits.</p>
<p>Well, that's good, 'cause I'm going to need copies of all your plans and construction photos.</p>
<p>As well as contact information for you and your crew, if you don't mind.</p>
<p>Sure, whatever you want.</p>
<p>That's a lot of concentration for a property crime.</p>
<p>I think it just paid off.</p>
<p>This is a pawn shop receipt for an antique cameo and a diamond ring-- the only two items left missing.</p>
<p>Our suspect is, what, 14 years old?</p>
<p>He didn't pawn these things by himself.</p>
<p>You sure you don't want to give this a shot?</p>
<p>I'd prefer to watch you.</p>
<p>Magnetic powder works best on porous surfaces, because it doesn't smear.</p>
<p>I hear it's all in the wrist.</p>
<p>Actually, I think it's in the fingers, but that's me.</p>
<p>Nice!</p>
<p>The scanner's behind us.</p>
<p>Diane Palento?</p>
<p>The kid's mother.</p>
<p>Priors for shoplifting and... ah, narcotics possession.</p>
<p>That's your mother pawning stolen property.</p>
<p>You didn't get that stuff from the neighborhood kids.</p>
<p>Your mother gave it to you, didn't she, Alex?</p>
<p>She didn't steal it.</p>
<p>She bought it from a garage sale.</p>
<p>You've been seeing her?</p>
<p>Taking presents from her and lying to me about it?</p>
<p>So what? You lied to me.</p>
<p>Said that she moved to New York. She didn't love me anymore.</p>
<p>I did it to protect...</p>
<p>It's not true!</p>
<p>I did it to protect you, Alex.</p>
<p>Your mother has problems, - and she's not doing anything to help herself!</p>
<p>Yes, she is. Yes, she is!</p>
<p>She's getting her act together, okay?</p>
<p>Saving up for a nice apartment so she and I can live together.</p>
<p>You are not going anywhere except juvenile hall, because receiving stolen property, that's a crime.</p>
<p>Stealing is a bigger crime.</p>
<p>I know you're not a thief, Alex.</p>
<p>You're a good kid. You made some bad decisions.</p>
<p>I know you two love each other, but your mom made some bad decisions, too, and I can't help her unless you help me.</p>
<p>That duffel bag is hers, isn't it?</p>
<p>When does she come around?</p>
<p>She sleeps there at night.</p>
<p>She stays on the floor.</p>
<p>Look, it's just for a while, okay?</p>
<p>She's gonna get her own place.</p>
<p>We're gonna live together.</p>
<p>It won't be much of a stakeout.</p>
<p>I doubt we'll have to set up on her more than one night.</p>
<p>She'll show up.</p>
<p>Bad parents crave unconditional love.</p>
<p>Well, I know I do.</p>
<p>I'll put a couple of guys on it.</p>
<p>I really think you broke through to him.</p>
<p>I was just trying to get him to give up his mother.</p>
<p>Thanks for the uni's, Captain.</p>
<p>Sure thing, no problem.</p>
<p>Hey, Jim. I got the crispy critter's cell phone records.</p>
<p>And get this-- the wife's assistant called 23 times in the 48 hours prior to his death.</p>
<p>Sounds like more than a working relationship.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'd say so. You're gonna love the voice mails she left him.</p>
<p>That's impressive, Carla.</p>
<p>So, tell me, where were you on the night of the fire?</p>
<p>I was here working.</p>
<p>You don't have to take my word for it.</p>
<p>There's surveillance all over this place.</p>
<p>No, I'm not going to take your word for it-- check this out.</p>
<p>Don, I'm standing outside your house, and once again, you're not here.</p>
<p>I warned you not to pull another no-show, you gutless son of a bitch.</p>
<p>I want to see you tonight.</p>
<p>Okay, I was at Don's house last night a little before 11:00, but I left right after that.</p>
<p>What were you doing at my house last night?</p>
<p>Trying to get the 20</p>
<p>Gs your husband owed me.</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>You know those herbal supplements he tried to get you to sell here?</p>
<p>Yeah, the ones that give you diarrhea?</p>
<p>I fronted him the money for that.</p>
<p>He said it might be a good way for us to earn some money on the side, and like an idiot, I believed him.</p>
<p>Did you sleep with him?</p>
<p>I don't sleep with losers.</p>
<p>Don wasn't a loser.</p>
<p>Come on, Paulla.</p>
<p>He was a nice guy...Complete airhead You outgrew him years ago.</p>
<p>You just couldn't admit it.</p>
<p>L-L-Ladies, ladies... - Bitch!</p>
<p>What's wrong with you?</p>
<p>Let's go down to the police station.</p>
<p>We can make your statements on record, okay?</p>
<p>I'll give you a ride.</p>
<p>A power cord to nowhere.</p>
<p>I don't remember seeing any appliances missing their cords.</p>
<p>Greg, will you come take a look at this, please?</p>
<p>We found residue like that on glass shards taken out of Don Kingsley's body.</p>
<p>Looks like galvanized metal.</p>
<p>Maybe a piece of roof flashing.</p>
<p>Did you I.D.the residue on the glass?</p>
<p>Hodges is working on it, I hope.</p>
<p>Grid 13.</p>
<p>Well, we found it about seven feet from the origin.</p>
<p>These marks look like the result of an electrical arc.</p>
<p>And in a room filled with gas, an arc is as good as a spark.</p>
<p>Okay. But there's got to be more to a timed detonator than this.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>Looks like we're working a double.</p>
<p>The residue on the metal disc is indeed what was found on the glass shards.</p>
<p>Zea mays.</p>
<p>Well, my botany's a little rusty, but I'd say... corn.</p>
<p>I call it maize.</p>
<p>Are you trying to impress me?</p>
<p>Did I?</p>
<p>So, we've got corn, a Mason jar, a piece of metal roof flashing and an electrical cord. How do you make a detonator out of that?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>You don't know.</p>
<p>That's not your reputation, Mr. Hodges.</p>
<p>I'm telling you, every time I turn around, one of these uni's is giving us the stink eye.</p>
<p>Come on now, you're imagining that.</p>
<p>No, I'm not.</p>
<p>That's what happens when you make a lab geek undersheriff.</p>
<p>Oh, that job is punishment enough.</p>
<p>I actually feel sorry for Ecklie.</p>
<p>You like burned toast, Ray?</p>
<p>Occasionally, but, uh... I've seen enough charcoal for one day.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Look at that.</p>
<p>You see that?</p>
<p>Yeah, I do.</p>
<p>See that?</p>
<p>No wonder why Grissom loves this place.</p>
<p>You didn't just do that, did you?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Check, please.</p>
<p>It's on me.</p>
<p>The new guy pays, right?</p>
<p>Only if he's smart.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>It's my shift on the Palento stakeout. You coming?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Oh, hey, Ray, I'll, uh, I'll give you a lift.</p>
<p>Okay, thanks.</p>
<p>So, Nicky, Mr.</p>
<p>Eater-of-Flies...</p>
<p>I want you to have Grissom's office.</p>
<p>I thought you were gonna use it.</p>
<p>I hate moving.</p>
<p>I don't know about that.</p>
<p>Doesn't really feel right.</p>
<p>Well, it may not for a while, but...</p>
<p>Make it your own.</p>
<p>Maybe she won't show up.</p>
<p>Kind of sounds like you're hoping she won't.</p>
<p>She's not helping her son.</p>
<p>Maybe not.</p>
<p>But... he's making choices here, too.</p>
<p>Yes, he is.</p>
<p>Mommy's home.</p>
<p>We're moving now.</p>
<p>LVPD. Hold it right there.</p>
<p>Leave me alone!</p>
<p>Get her!</p>
<p>Leave me alone!</p>
<p>Ray?</p>
<p>No! No! Let me see my kid!</p>
<p>Diane Palento, you're under arrest.</p>
<p>Let me... Let me see my kid!</p>
<p>Alex! Alex!</p>
<p>Don't take her! It was me! I took that stuff! Don't take her!</p>
<p>Alex, baby!</p>
<p>Get off her!</p>
<p>I'm coming back.</p>
<p>I love you, Mom.</p>
<p>I love you, Alex!</p>
<p>I love you!</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>Corn, glass jar, metal disk-- a chance to salvage your reputation.</p>
<p>What the hell is this?</p>
<p>A corn meal bomb.</p>
<p>Apparently, it's an old military trick.</p>
<p>As the corn meal absorbs the water, it expands, pushing up the metal disc.</p>
<p>But the process is pretty slow, which gives you time to fill the room with gas and leave.</p>
<p>Eventually, the metal disc touches the two exposed wires and...</p>
<p>An explosion and an alibi.</p>
<p>All in one.</p>
<p>Okay...</p>
<p>I'm impressed.</p>
<p>I had to cut the metal disc by hand to get it to fit in the Mason jar, which means the suspect did, too.</p>
<p>I think we should go back through the evidence from the Kingsley garage and do tool mark comparisons on anything that could have been used to cut the disc.</p>
<p>Well, that can take a couple of weeks, assuming the tool's even there.</p>
<p>And even if it is there, you still have to connect it directly to a suspect.</p>
<p>Well, one step at a time, right?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Let's see what Archie has for us.</p>
<p>Hey, man, I got your text. What's going on?</p>
<p>Check this out.</p>
<p>This is earlier, the day of the murder.</p>
<p>Where did you get this?</p>
<p>Brass pulled it from Paulla Kingsley's gym.</p>
<p>10:07.</p>
<p>That's about two hours before the fire.</p>
<p>You know what that means...</p>
<p>Yeah, it means he had motive, and time to set the detonator.</p>
<p>It's always sad when a husband gets in the way of his wife's blossoming relationship with their contractor, hmm?</p>
<p>It was strictly platonic.</p>
<p>I was in crisis, and Josh was a good listener.</p>
<p>Oh, I'm sure he was.</p>
<p>I'm sure he listened to you complain about your financial situation, and what a loser your airhead husband is.</p>
<p>So, whose idea was it to kill Don? Was it yours or Josh's?</p>
<p>What are you saying, that Josh killed my husband?</p>
<p>Oh, my God.</p>
<p>I'm going to be sick.</p>
<p>We were in love.</p>
<p>She was going to leave him, so we could be together.</p>
<p>She lost her nerve.</p>
<p>I told Josh that I couldn't leave Don.</p>
<p>That I... That I still loved him despite his flaws.</p>
<p>That loser.</p>
<p>He was taking her down with him.</p>
<p>I realized there was only one way to save her.</p>
<p>So I built the detonator.</p>
<p>And after I took her to work, I took care of the problem.</p>
<p>Told Donald there was a problem with the gas line in the garage.</p>
<p>Check out the pilot light.</p>
<p>He was holding her hostage.</p>
<p>And I set her free.</p>
<p>Brass just closed your arson-murder.</p>
<p>Contractor confessed. Nice work.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>I thought that this one was closed, too.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>Then why are you wasting the taxpayers' money?</p>
<p>I'm kidding.</p>
<p>A rock... through a window.</p>
<p>Don't you think Diane Palento was a little too street smart to make that much noise breaking in?</p>
<p>The owner came home, said he... discovered he had been robbed.</p>
<p>So why was his laptop still in the house?</p>
<p>Wouldn't that have been at work with him? And look-- his watch.</p>
<p>Most guys take their watches off to shower, or to... to swim, to, uh...</p>
<p>Have s*x.</p>
<p>Except his wife was out of town that weekend.</p>
<p>So, I checked his web history. Take a look at this.</p>
<p>Diamond.</p>
<p>AKA Diane Palento.</p>
<p>Very classy.</p>
<p>The husband hires himself a hooker, and after, when he passes out or takes a shower, she rips him off.</p>
<p>He might be able to explain away the laptop and the watch, but not his wife's jewelry.</p>
<p>I think he decided to stage a... fake break-in.</p>
<p>Shall we go bust him now?</p>
<p>The only thing that we could get him for is filing a false report.</p>
<p>It's a misdemeanor, and the D.A.would never prosecute, so, you got to just return the property and call it a day.</p>
<p>A good day.</p>
<p>My grandfather gave this to my grandmother in McKeesport, Pennsylvania, in 1914.</p>
<p>Never thought that I'd see it again. I can't thank you enough.</p>
<p>Tell him how you lost it.</p>
<p>What, does that matter?</p>
<p>Tell him.</p>
<p>That's not really necessary, ma'am. Would you...</p>
<p>Can we please just go?</p>
<p>Don't you touch me, you diseased pervert.</p>
<p>Oh, come on, I made a mistake, honey.</p>
<p>A mistake?You brought a whore into our bedroom, and you had disgusting s*x with her on my bed.</p>
<p>No, I did not have disgusting sex-- I told you--</p>
<p>I got drunk and passed out, because subconsciously, honey, I could not go through with it.</p>
<p>Well, subconsciously, I can't stay married to a degenerate sleazeball.</p>
<p>I've never done anything like this before.</p>
<p>I've never done anything like...</p>
<p>How can I even trust you?</p>
<p>Come on! I didn't even get to do anything.</p>
<p>Oh, so now you're disappointed you didn't get to foul our sheets...</p>
<p>Alex, listen, I know you feel as if you betrayed your mother, but believe me, it may be the best thing that ever happened to her.</p>
<p>Your mother's going to need your help.</p>
<p>You may be the only person that she'll listen to.</p>
<p>I know it's not a fair thing to ask of a 14-year-old kid, but you've got to be strong for her.</p>
<p>Y to get her to go to a rehab program.</p>
<p>I can get you a list of places, if you like.</p>
<p>You sure you're okay with this?</p>
<p>You can still change your mind.</p>
<p>No, you can't.</p>
<p>I said I'd kill for an office, and I meant it. Even a shared one.</p>
<p>This is a very classy move, Nick.</p>
<p>Very classy.</p>
<p>Seriously.</p>
<p>Well, you're welcome.</p>
<p>There's go energy in here.</p>
<p>It'll be nice to share it.</p>
<p>This belongs here.</p>
<p>We're off the clock.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>I'll see you tomorrow.</p>

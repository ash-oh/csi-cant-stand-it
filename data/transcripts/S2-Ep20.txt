<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Camera moves fast and low to the ground. Flash to white.)</p>
<p>[EXT. RESIDENTIAL AREA (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Camera moves swiftly past residential homes. Past a home with a rickety wooden fence. The number painted on the sidewalk indicates that it's property lot #302. The camera turns into the driveway of this home, moving low to the ground. Flash to white.)</p>
<p>(The camera moves along the path past the lawn and the trash can. The camera moves along the sidewalk, still, low to the ground. It passes by an old car tire and turns up the porch stairs. The camera climbs up the porch stairs and heads straight into the house through the kitty door.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. MRS. RUTH ELLIOT'S HOUSE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Camera cuts into the house where we see a cat burst in through the kitty door. All during the intro, we were traveling through the eyes of the cat. The cat runs into the house and down the hallway.)</p>
<p>(The house is dark and unkempt. There are more cats. in the house. The cat we've been following heads to the living room where there are other cats also gathered. Cats meowing. They're gathered at the center of the living room. Growling. Hissing. Feeding.)</p>
<p>(The camera moves up along and we see that the cats are feeding on a dead body.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. MRS. RUTH ELLIOT'S HOUSE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Close up on the back of SGT. O'RILEY'S neck. The camera follows behind him as he makes his way toward GRISSOM and CATHERINE, both carrying their CSI kits. Indistinct radio transmissions can be heard in the background.)</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. O'Riley</strong>: Welcome to the wild kingdom. Vic's Ruth Elliot, 80 years old. Had at least 20 roommates, all of them feline. Animal control's rounding them up now.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Who alerted homicide?</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. O'Riley</strong>: Mail was piling up. Mailman looked in the window and called 9-1-1.</p>
<p>(SGT. O'RILEY turns around and heads back into the house. He calls behind him ... )</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. O'Riley</strong>: Take a deep breath before you go inside.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and CATHERINE follow. As they walk up the pathway, several animal control personnel carry cages with cats in them.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. MRS. RUTH ELLIOT'S HOUSE - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and GRISSOM enter the house. CATHERINE'S reaction is instantaneous.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, god! Ugh! I didn't think anything could mask the smell of a decomp.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Male cat urine ... to us, smelly. To a female cat, it must be like aftershave.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Me-ow.</p>
<p>(DAVID PHILLIPS walks up to them to give them his report.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: David.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You don't look so good.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Allergic to cats.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, bummer.</p>
<p>(DAVID PHILLIPS blows his nose.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Rigor mortis has passed. Lividity is fixed. Extensive marbling on her limbs. She's been dead three or four days and I need a Benadryl. Excuse me.</p>
<p>(DAVID PHILLIPS walks out of the house past CATHERINE and GRISSOM.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM hands the camera he was carrying to CATHERINE and turns on his flashlight. They approach the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Whoa.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: She could have died of natural causes. Three or four days, pets could have been looking for their next meal.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sure. Meat is meat.</p>
<p>(Behind them, a cat meows and hisses. They turn around to see Animal Control catch a white cat.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Or maybe they turned on her.</p>
<p>(They both crouch low to get a better look at the body. There are bloody injuries to the body's head and left side, the major feeding sites. Then GRISSOM sees it.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Whoa. Look at this. Flowing wound. </p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV from inside the wound as GRISSOM pulls it open with his fingers. The camera is inside the wound and pulls back to show us GRISSOM looking down through the wound. End of CGI POV. Resume on GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's a deep wound track. This woman was stabbed. I guess the cats are off the hook.</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK. END OF TEASER. ROLL TITLE CREDITS.</p>

[EXT./INT. MRS. RUTH ELLIOT'S HOUSE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE finds a single footprint on the hardwood floor. She dusts it and takes a print of it. GRISSOM enters the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Floor's covered with trash. Lots of partials. Mostly from animal control boots. But ... I got something here.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Distinctive heel and toe. What, a high heel?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well ... an old lady wears flats or slippers. I can't imagine that this vic entertained.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You got to be careful with isolation. It can escalate. Before you know it, you're the crazy cat lady living in the rundown house. People stop coming by to visit. You go outside, your neighbors run across the street to get away from you. Eventually, you stop going out altogether.</p>
<p>(WARRICK enters.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Whoo, man! It reeks in here. Who lives like this?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Cat lover.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You think? So, what do we know?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, there's no signs of forced entry anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, I can see why somebody would want to rob this place. I'll start in the bedroom.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM nods.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(WARRICK turns the corner and slowly makes his way to the bedroom. He pushes the door open and looks in on the messy bathroom. He turns and notices the bedroom closet. The large wall safe in the closet bears a large black scorch mark. He opens the safe door. It's empty.)</p>
<p>(Cut to WARRICK dusting the door for prints. He finds a set.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. MRS. RUTH ELLIOT'S HOUSE - KITCHEN -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM holds out a large kitchen knife for CATHERINE to test. She swabs both sides of the knife.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No reaction. Knives are clean.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, killer could have brought his own ... took it with him when he left.</p>
<p>(WARRICK enters the kitchen holding the prints he lifted from the bedroom safe.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We might want to reconsider &quot;burglary gone bad.&quot; I found a busted safe in the bedroom. Empty. I lifted prints.</p>
<p><strong>Willows</strong>: A high-heeled thief who knew exactly what to look for and killed the only obstacle in their path.</p>
<p>(Camera holds on GRISSOM.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT./INT. GARAGE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(NICK and SARA make their way to the garage. They meet up with BRASS who fills them in.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Welcome to a 4-45.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Explosives. It's been a while.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Fatalities?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Just this $50,000 Beemer. Marcie Tobin. Her car. And Marcus Remmick, mechanic, an eyewitness. So, divide and conquer?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, I'll take the rig.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'll take the grease monkey.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I guess I got the driver.</p>
<p>(SARA makes her way to MARCIE TOBIN who is already speaking with a police officer.)</p>
<p><strong>Marcie Tobin</strong>: (to the officer) How does that make any sense? I mean, why would somebody put a bomb in my car?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Ms. Tobin? Hi. I'm with the Crime Lab. Mind if I ask you a few questions?</p>
<p><strong>Marcie Tobin</strong>: Have you reached my husband?</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: I'll check on it, ma'am.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Thanks. Can you tell me what happened?</p>
<p><strong>Marcie Tobin</strong>: I was on my way to my father's office. </p>
<p>(FLASHBACK of MARCIE TOBIN driving her car along the street.)</p>
<p><strong>Marcie Tobin</strong>: (V.O.) On Thursdays we have dinner and then I help him with his payroll.</p>
<p>(Flash to white as MARCIE TOBIN drives, her car begins clanging. Flash to white as MARCIE TOBIN pulls into a garage. She gets out of the car and approaches MARCUS REMMICK, the mechanic.)</p>
<p><strong>Marcie Tobin</strong>: Excuse me? </p>
<p><strong>Marcus Remmick</strong>: We're closed.</p>
<p><strong>Marcie Tobin</strong>: My car is making a really strange noise.</p>
<p><strong>Marcus Remmick</strong>: Take it to the dealership in the morning.</p>
<p>(End of MARCIE TOBIN'S Flashback. Resume to MARCUS REMMICK talking with BRASS.)</p>
<p><strong>Marcus Remmick</strong>: Lady's driving a brand-new Beemer. First service is 15,000 miles. Things don't go wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah. But you checked it out anyway, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Marcus Remmick</strong>: You know how women get.</p>
<p>(Flashback to MARCUS REMMICK and MARCIE TOBIN at the garage.)</p>
<p><strong>Marcus Remmick</strong>: Go ahead, pop the hood.</p>
<p>(Flash to white as the hood is up and MARCUS REMMICK checking the car out. MARCUS REMMICK sees the timer. He turns to MARCIE TOBIN.)</p>
<p><strong>Marcus Remmick</strong>: Back away.</p>
<p><strong>Marcie Tobin</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>Marcus Remmick</strong>: Run, run!</p>
<p><strong>Marcie Tobin</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>Marcus Remmick</strong>: Run!</p>
<p>(Car explodes. End of flashback. Resume on MARCIE TOBIN.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Ms. Tobin, where did you last park your car?</p>
<p><strong>Marcie Tobin</strong>: In my house, in my garage.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: And who would have access?</p>
<p><strong>Marcie Tobin</strong>: Just me... and my husband. But Johnny had nothing to do with this. He's been at work all day. You can ask him as soon as he gets here.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. THE GARAGE - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Still at the same crime scene, NICK is examining the damaged car ... back seat ... front seat. SARA approaches to lend a hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Anything probative?</p>
<p>(NICK signals to her.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Check out this displacement. Detritus blew backwards. </p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV Flashback of the car exploding from the perspective of the driver's front seat. The explosion blows outward disintegrating the driver's seat. End of CGI POV Flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Right into the driver.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p>(NICK sighs. They both stand.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: That's intentional.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Bombs are personal.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So ... assuming Mrs. Tobin was the intended target the bomber knew what he was doing.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah, a hired hit on a housewife.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY]</p>
<p>(Camera top view down on MRS. RUTH ELLIOT'S sheet-covered body. ROBBINS, GRISSOM and CATHERINE stand near the table.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Glad I'm a dog person.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You know, house cats have only been domesticated for 4,000 years. They still have predatory instincts.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Only 4,000?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: But a cat didn't kill her.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: You're right. No vital reactions around the bite marks. Predation is all postmortem. Cause of death: cardiac trauma. She was stabbed lateral to the sternal border, just below the fifth intercostal space </p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV that starts with a top view of the wound and goes straight down into the wound. Down, down, down into the flesh and past the bone and to the heart. Flash to white. End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: ... Straight into the right ventricle. Muscle layers decrease with age. Fascia and tissue layers are easy to penetrate. Can't tell you much about the weapon but the wound track is slick. </p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV that again starts with a top view of the wound and goes straight down into the wound. It stops mid-way and shows muscles slick with dripping clear-colored liquid. Flash to white. End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: I swabbed the foreign substance sent it to Greg.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Well, vic's lungs were full of fluid. Probably not relevant to your investigation, but the lab cultured her blood. She had a severe staph infection.</p>
<p>(A cell phone rings. GRISSOM answers it.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Grissom. (pause) We'll be right there. </p>
<p>(He closes his phone.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Homicide has a witness.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>

[EXT. TRENT'S HOME - PORCH -- DAY]</p>
<p>(On the porch of home #223, SGT. O'RILEY, GRISSOM and CATHERINE question MRS. JANET TRENT'S two daughters.)</p>
<p><strong>Janet Trent</strong>: (prompting) Tell them what you told me. Come on, Jessica. What did you see?</p>
<p><strong>Jessica Trent</strong>: Oh, the lady over there the one that died, she was nice. She had cats. Lots of them. </p>
<p><strong>Jackie Trent</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: My name's Catherine. What is your name again?</p>
<p><strong>Jessica Trent</strong>: Jessica Rachel Trent. I'm eight and a half.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, eight and a half. So, I bet you're in the third grade?</p>
<p><strong>Jessica Trent</strong>: Yeah. My teacher's Mrs. Armstrong. She's really nice. Except I hate multiplication especially the eight's.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You know, I have a daughter. She hates the eight's, too. So, Jessica, can you tell me what you told your mom?</p>
<p><strong>Jackie Trent</strong>: I can. Jessica and I were playing handball against the garage door. We saw Mrs. Stein go into Mrs. Elliot's house and they were yelling.</p>
<p><strong>Jessica Trent</strong>: When Mrs. Stein came out she looked really angry. K-Kind of like when mommy's boyfriend is late for dinner. She hates that.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And, uh ... who is Mrs. Stein?</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. O'Riley</strong>: Mrs. Elliot's next-door neighbor. Ran a background check. The good neighbor filed three nuisance complaints against the victim.</p>
<p>(In the house across the street, a woman stands in the window looking out at the crowd on the porch. She moves away when she sees them looking at her.)</p>
<p>(JESSICA TRENT and JACKIE TRENT whisper in each other's ears.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, are you girls sharing secrets? Can you share it with me?</p>
<p><strong>Jessica Trent</strong>: All right.</p>
<p>(JESSICA TRENT motions for CATHERINE to lean in close. She whispers something into her ear. CATHERINE smiles when done.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (smiles) Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Jessica Trent</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to GRISSOM) I think that we're done here.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Okay. Thanks for your help.</p>
<p><strong>Janet Trent</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p>(MRS. TRENT and her two daughters go back into the house. SGT. O'RILEY, GRISSOM and CATHERINE move off of the porch to discuss the case.)</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. O'Riley</strong>: I'll get a warrant for Mrs. Stein's shoes. See if we can place her at the crime scene.</p>
<p>(O'RILEY walks away and out of screen presumably back to his car to get the warrant. GRISSOM and CATHERINE follow behind at a more leisurely pace.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Don't you have a secret to share with me now?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, uh, Mrs. Stein? She hates cats.</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>

[INT. CSI - GARAGE -- DAY]</p>
<p>(NICK and SARA work on the car. SARA picks up a package full of evidence or rather, parts of evidence and empties it all over the table. NICK helps spread it around as they go through it. NICK picks something up.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Another spring.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Did you know there's a dozen moving parts inside a ticking clock?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I do now.</p>
<p>(NICK finds something else.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hmm ... hello, sweetheart.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: End cap?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Pipe bomb.</p>
<p>(He examines it under a hand-held magnifying light.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: End cap at both ends. Either one could have come in contact with the explosive inside the pipe. I'll swab it see if trace can identify it.</p>
<p>(SARA also found something.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I will see your end cap and raise you a grommet.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: A grommet? Inside a pipe bomb?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Not in the bomb, itself, but embedded in the end cap. The wires from the timing device enter the pipe through a hole in the grommet.</p>
<p>(Flash to white. CGI-POV of a pipe bomb with end caps on both ends. There's the grommit in one of the end caps with a wire running through the hole, along the side, to the alarm clock attached to the side of the pipe. The clock has a nail where the 12 should be and when the clock alarm hits 12, an electrical pulse emits from the alarm clock, along the wire, in to the pipe through the grommit. The pipe bomb explodes. Flash to white. End of CGI-POV. Resume to NICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (V.O.) When the timing device is activated, it sets off an electrical charge that detonates the explosives inside the pipe.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yet the grommet's fully intact. How did it survive the blast?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I don't know, but they always do.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: And just when I thought you knew everything.</p>
<p>(SARA smiles, embarrassed. BRASS enters.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: How's the puzzle?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey. Pieces are small, but it's coming together.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, I got a corner piece. The 4-1-1 on Marcie Tobin's husband? Junior foreman on Tobin C &amp; D, Incorporated. The &quot;C&quot; stands for &quot;Construction&quot; the &quot;D&quot; is for &quot;Demolition.&quot;</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. TOBIN C &amp; D -- DAY]</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Mr. Claddon are you a Demolitions expert?</p>
<p><strong>Jonathon Claddon</strong>: That's what we do. You must have seen our work on TV. We imploded most of the old strip hotels.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Do you personally know how to make a bomb?</p>
<p><strong>Jonathon Claddon</strong>: It's not hard. Anybody here could show you how.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So, I take that as a &quot;yes&quot;?</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Can you tell us about your son-in-law?</p>
<p><strong>Barclay Tobin</strong>: Well, I got him his first and only job when he married Marcie.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You, uh ... you don't think too much of him, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Barclay Tobin</strong>: Even less these days. Marcie says that he's cheating on her but I don't think he has the stones.</p>

<p><strong>Barclay Tobin</strong>: But after last night ... </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Does Johnny have access to explosives?</p>
<p><strong>Barclay Tobin</strong>: All my foremen have access to dynamite.</p>

<p><strong>Janet Trent</strong>: Thank you. See you later.</p>
<p>(MRS. TRENT heads back to the house.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: One thing about my mother even though she was deaf, she was always the boss.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Huh. Well ... single mom ... juggling a job, a boyfriend. It's just easier to say yes than no and then eventually, they just keep asking for permission. You want to tell me why I swabbed their cat?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That cat has an open sore and a missing patch of fur -- both indicative of possible staph infection.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And we know that our victim had a staph infection.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Staphylococcus bacteria can jump the species barrier -- be passed from human to animal.</p>

[INT. MARCUS REMMICK'S GARAGE]</p>
<p><strong>Marcus Remmick</strong>: (o. s.) Guess I must have shut it, then. I wasn't thinking; I was reacting, you know? No harm, no foul.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No prints.</p>
<p><strong>Marcus Remmick</strong>: Come again?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, if you were pawing all over the hood then your prints should be on it.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: And they're not.</p>
<p><strong>Marcus Remmick</strong>: I wear gloves.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You're not wearing them now.</p>
<p><strong>Marcus Remmick</strong>: I wear them most of the time.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Mind if we take a look around the garage?</p>
<p><strong>Marcus Remmick</strong>: Knock yourselves out.</p>
<p>(NICK and SARA look around the garage. They spot the vice grips on the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Are you thinking what I'm thinking?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Mechanics use vice grips?</p>
<p>(NICK picks up the vice grips from the tool chest and looks at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You got any clay?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well... we can't just take the tool without a warrant.</p>
<p>(SARA looks down into the trash bin and picks up a sandwich thrown in there.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: But ... we can improvise. Trash is trash.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Cheese. Nice.</p>
<p>(SARA hands the sandwich to NICK who works on making an imprint on the cheese.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I'll compare this with our case toolmark.</p>
<p>(Behind him, MARCUS REMMICK reaches over the table to pick up a clipboard. He glances at what NICK is doing. He walks away.)</p>
<p><strong>Marcus Remmick</strong>: You guys having fun?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: A blast. Hey, man ... these yours?</p>
<p><strong>Marcus Remmick</strong>: Don't use vice grips -- pipe wrench has a better feel. Must belong to one of my mechanics.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Thanks ... I'll take the prints on those.</p>
<p>(SARA takes the cheese and walks over to her CSI kit.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Boy, you just have an answer for everything, don't you?</p>
<p><strong>Marcus Remmick</strong>: Yeah, I guess I do.</p>
<p>(MARCUS REMMICK turns and walks away. Camera holds on NICK.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />

[INT. CSI -- LAB]</p>
<p>(NICK takes the cheese out of the plastic baggie and puts it under the microscope for comparison with their existing cast of the end cap. The prints match perfectly. NICK looks up. He walks over to the next lab where SARA is at the computer.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Striae are identical. Auto body vice grip was definitely used to tighten the end cap. Mechanic's prints on file?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Marcus Remmick. Arrested for fraud in 1994. He was selling used parts as new. Prints are in AFIS, but they don't match the vice grip. And, in fact, AFIS drew a blank.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hmmm. Then what are you running?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'm running a Tobin C&amp;D database.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Oh. Shot in the dark.</p>
<p>(The computer beeps as it runs a print comparison from their existing print to the prints in the database.)</p>
<p>(It finds a match.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Even a shot in the dark hits sometimes.</p>
<p>(SARA smiles.)</p>

<p><strong>Marcie Tobin</strong>: Why would I put a bomb in my car?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Not only did you put a bomb in your car -- you made it yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Marcie Tobin</strong>: Why would I do that?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The business registration shows that you own 25% of your father's company. So Nevada's a community property State-- you divorce Johnny he becomes a part-owner of Tobin Construction. That wouldn't sit too well with dad, would it?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: But if Johnny goes down for attempted murder, he goes to jail and you get to keep everything, because a criminal can't benefit from his own malfeasance.</p>
<p><strong>Marcie Tobin</strong>: This is absurd. </p>
<p>(MARCIE TOBINS stands to leave. She stops at the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know, for your information, um ... your mechanic friend lawyered up. Guys with records roll fast.</p>
<p><strong>Marcie Tobin</strong>: He's not my friend.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Really? Because we found your prints on a tool at the body shop. It was the same tool we know was used to make the pipe bomb.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (quietly) Sit down.</p>
<p>(MARCIE TOBIN sits back down at the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You and Marcus tag-teamed us. You never popped the hood; he never shut it-- it was latched.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Fortunately for you, you only worked Thursday nights, because your little plan took a lot of extra time and effort.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to MARCIE TOBIN taking the one stick of dynamite out of her husband's car. She's wearing thick, black gloves to do the deed. Flash to white as MARCIE TOBIN removes an end cap from the box on the shelf. Flash to white. MARCIE TOBIN and MARCUS REMMICK standing at the work table in the back of his garage. Flash to white. MARCIE TOBIN tightening the end cap to the bomb with the vice grips. Flash to white. The end cap on the pipe bomb. Flash to white. End flashback. Resume on MARCIE TOBIN.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (V.O.) You snagged a stick of dynamite out of Johnny's SUV, took an end cap out of inventory, knowing we'd trace it back to Johnny if we found it. And then at the body shop, you put it all together.</p>
<p><strong>Marcie Tobin</strong>: So what if I made a bomb? That's not a crime.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Really? You sure about that?</p>
<p>(MARCIE TOBIN swallows nervously.)</p>
<p>(Quick Flashback to MARCUS REMMICK putting the finished pipe bomb in the engine. Flash to white as MARCUS REMMICK shuts the hood of the car. Flash to white as MARCUS REMMICK leans over the driver window.</p>
<p><strong>Marcus Remmick</strong>: Ready.</p>
<p>(Flash to white as MARCIE TOBIN turns on the car's CD player (Track 12). She smiles.)</p>

Resume on MARCIE TOBIN.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You used to own a '92 volvo. I ran your credit card. You owe $20,000 in auto body repairs. Your dad kicked in $30,000. I ran his credit card, too. That's 50 g's for a leaky transmission.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You needed Marcus' help to wire the bomb and substantiate your story. So the two of you paid him $50,000 for services rendered.</p>
<p><strong>Marcie Tobin</strong>: Look, I'm fine, and my husband is fine, and it was my car that exploded so does this ... really need to go any further?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Ma'am, you and your father conspired to frame your husband for attempted murder.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So, you're both looking at, what, uh ... twenty-plus.</p>

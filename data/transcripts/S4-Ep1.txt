<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. HOTEL/CASINO - ROULETTE TABLE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Open on a roulette ball being put into play, then a top view of a roulette wheel in play. MRS. RIFKIN and her husband are playing.)</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Rifkin</strong>: Okay. Come on. MR. RIFKIN: Come on. MRS. RIFKIN: Let's go. Come on. MR. RIFKIN: Don't fail me. MRS. RIFKIN: Come on, baby. I'm feeling this one.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Rifkin</strong>: Don't fail me. MRS. RIFKIN: Don't you let me down. MR. RIFKIN: Come on now. MRS. RIFKIN: All right. Black 22.</p>
<p>(MRS. RIFKIN reaches out a puts a stack of red chips on the number. They watch the ball on the wheel.)</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Rifkin</strong>: If this happens, I'm buying you a shot.</p>
<p><strong>House</strong>: No more bets.</p>
<p>(The ball stops on Black 22.)</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Rifkin</strong>: Yes!</p>
<p>(The couple cheers, hug and kiss each other in celebration.)</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Rifkin</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(The house pushes their win toward the couple. MRS. RIFKIN reaches for ward to grab the chips. Her husband glances over at the bar and sees a WOMAN IN RED leaning against the counter and standing next to a man.)</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Rifkin</strong>: Give me my money.</p>
<p>(She grabs the chips and pulls it toward her.)</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Rifkin</strong>: Oh, my.</p>
<p>(She turns to her husband and drapes her arms around his neck to hold him close.)</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Rifkin</strong>: Let's cash out.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Rifkin</strong>: Why? I, uh, I thought we were going to take some risks tonight.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Rifkin</strong>: (suggestively) Come on ... I want to go dancing.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Rifkin</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Rifkin</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Rifkin</strong>: Okay. As long as it's lap dancing.</p>
<p>(Her jaw drops in surprise.)</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Rifkin</strong>: What has gotten into you?</p>
<p>(He smiles back, then they hug. Over her shoulder, MR. RIFKIN glances over at the bar to look at the woman in red, but she's gone.)</p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO:</p>
<p>[INT. BAR -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(MRS. RIFKIN and her husband sit at the bar.) </p>
<p><strong>Mr. Dominguez</strong>: Hey, buddy, when you get a chance, can I get a couple more of these martinis? One with an olive, one with a twist. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Rifkin</strong>: Why don't we, um ... take those up to the room? </p>
<p>(She smiles, laughs and kisses him.)</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Rifkin</strong>: 'Cause I'm feeling a little ... uh ...</p>
<p>(She kisses him again as her husband looks beyond her to the WOMAN IN RED in the back of the room with her husband.)</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Rifkin</strong>: (whispering) ... Frisky.</p>
<p>(MRS. RIFKIN turns around to look at who he's looking at. She sees the couple, then turns back to her husband.)</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Rifkin</strong>: Do you know them?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Rifkin</strong>: (chuckles and shakes his head) No, but how frisky do you feel?</p>
<p>(They both turn and glance over at the couple. Her husband points over at them.)</p>
<p>(The Rifkin's stand up and head for the other couple.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS DESERT (STOCK) - SUNRISE]</p>
<p>[INT. THE SPHERE - TENTH FLOOR -- MORNING] </p>
<p>(CAMERA LOW TO THE GROUND as the hotel housekeeper pushes her cart through the hallway. She pauses at the next room door and knocks.) </p>
<p><strong>Housekeeper</strong>: Housekeeping. Coming in.</p>
<p>(She opens the door, pushes it wide open and walks into the darkened room. She reaches out and flips the switch to open the curtains, but after a moment, they only open part of the way. She stops, turns back and tries the curtain switch again. After hitting it several times, she gives up and heads for the curtains to open them herself.)</p>
<p>(She walks across the bedroom and jiggles the drapes. Suddenly, she stops, turns around slowly ... and screams.)</p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO:</p>
<p>[INT. THE SPHERE - TENTH FLOOR -- MORNING] </p>
<p>(Several quick flashes of ALICE DOMINGUEZ'S slashed throat. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(ALICE DOMINGUEZ is slumped back in her seat at the table. There is blood spattered all along the table, the vase on the table and along the wall.)</p>
<p>(Camera moves rapidly around and stops on ...</p>
<p>(GRISSOM stares at the scene. He steps forward and examines the injury. CATHERINE walks into the room and examines the blood spatter on the walls.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Her throat's been slit by what appears to have been a very sharp implement. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM straightens and looks around the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The room is completely stripped. No bedding, no sheets. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No towels, either. Someone took a few souvenirs. I'll check the surveillance tapes.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks out of the bathroom and into the bedroom. GRISSOM goes back to examining the body.)</p>
<p>(He takes out her driver's license and looks at it:</p>
<p>CALIFORNIA DRIVER LICENSE<br />
EXPIRES: 7/13/07<br />
CLASS:</p>
<p>ALICE DOMINGUEZ<br />
311 SEPHILL<br />
LOS ANGELES, CA 90078</p>
<p>s*x: F HAIR: BRN EYES: BRN<br />
HT: 5'7&quot; WT: 130 DOB: 7-13-72<br />
RSTR: NONE<br />
{signature}</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Alice Dominguez. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM shows CATHERINE the wallet.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: She wasn't robbed.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It's not her room, either. It was registered under the name of Parker.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM shines his flashlight on ALICE DOMINGUEZ' left hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Wedding ring. Where's the husband?</p>
<p>(Off screen, we hear a faint, electronic whirring sound. The camera cuts to CATHERINE'S black bag and kit on the floor off to the side. GRISSOM looks over to her things.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE turns to answer it.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I think your cell phone's vibrating.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (turns back to look at GRISSOM) You heard that?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM goes back to looking at the wallet.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE reaches for her phone and smiles at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You're back.</p>
<p>(Distracted, GRISSOM doesn't hear her.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE smiles as she answers her phone. GRISSOM squints ... or winks at her.)</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) -- DAY] </p>
<p>[INT. THE SPHERE - TENTH FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY]</p>
<p>(BRASS, WARRICK and NICK walk through the hallway on the way to the hotel room.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: There's only two reasons why people get murdered in a casino.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: s*x or money. Well, on the money side, the room was booked yesterday, under a stolen credit card belonging to a Mrs. Parker. She's a 75-year-old living alone in Henderson. As far as s*x goes, well, I want to be a believer.</p>
<p>(They stop in front of the taped-off room. NICK looks beyond that to the stairs just next to it.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Room closest to the exit. Imagine that.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Quick escape. Murder Central. Security cameras?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Uh, not in the hallway. Only in the elevator. We're on it.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Take the exit.</p>
<p>(NICK walks over to the stairway door.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'll take the money trail.</p>
<p>(WARRICK leaves.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: And I'll, uh ... go door-to-door.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. THE SPHERE - TENTH FLOOR ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(GRISSOM and CATHERINE study the dead body. CATHERINE stands in front of the body, while GRISSOM stands behind it. He moves around to the front.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: This is very weird.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, usually when someone gets their throat cut, it's from behind.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, and it starts there, ends there. It's not very deep.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE checks the woman's hands.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No ligature marks. No defensive wounds.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I think whoever did this was sitting in that chair.</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: Close up of the knife and ALICE DOMINGUEZ'S reflection in the knife as it's being held up against her neck.)</p>
<p>(End of quick flash. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: She sat there and allowed someone to slit her throat?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks back at CATHERINE.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. HOTEL -- CASINO -- DAY] </p>
<p>(SARA leans up against the counter looking at a piece of paper. WARRICK walks up to her. They both turn and walk through the casino.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey, girl.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What you got?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Not much. Mrs. Dominguez checked in with her husband yesterday. Room<br />
869.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: 869? That's, like, two floors away from where she was found dead.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Anybody heard from the husband yet?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: He's M.I.A., but he left a gambling paper trail.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I have a signature and a thumbprint from where Mr. Dominguez signed a<br />
$5,000 cash-advance check.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Cash advance, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It was cash advance on a credit card. It's not cheap. It's, like $90 every thousand.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: That's a rip-off.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Not if you're desperate. He must have had a bad night.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah, and Mrs. Dominguez had a worse night. You know, nobody's checked their suite yet. Would you care to join me?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Let's do it.</p>
<p>(They walk off camera frame.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. TENTH FLOOR HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(BRASS talks with a man in the hotel room directly next door to the crime scene room.) </p>
<p><strong>Guest (man)</strong>: I heard some voices raised and a door slamming.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Mm. How many voices?</p>
<p><strong>Guest (man)</strong>: Two. No, wait. Uh, maybe it was three. (He shrugs.) Definitely a man and a woman.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What were they saying?</p>
<p><strong>Guest (man)</strong>: Uh, it was hard to tell. You know, the walls in these joints are pretty thick. They were definitely arguing about something.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Did you get a look at them?</p>
<p><strong>Guest (man)</strong>: Uh, just through the spy hole.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The GUEST looks through the peephole and sees a man and a woman arguing loudly as they're walking away from the room. These are the two people in the teaser who were in front of the roulette wheel.)</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Rifkin</strong>: Obviously he's insane. They're both crazy.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Rifkin</strong>: Why would you put me in that situation?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Rifkin</strong>: I didn't put you in that position with ...</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What time was that?</p>
<p><strong>Guest (man)</strong>: 10:35.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: 10:35? You seem to be pretty sure about that.</p>
<p><strong>Guest (man)</strong>: Well, I-I had just ordered a pay-per-view movie, and it was just about to begin.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, yeah? Which one was that?</p>
<p><strong>Guest (man)</strong>: Arma-get-it-on.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You mean, Armageddon?</p>
<p><strong>Guest (man)</strong>: No. Arma-get-it-on.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh. (beat) Good movie?</p>
<p><strong>Guest (man)</strong>: Worked for me.</p>
<p>(BRASS leaves.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. HALLWAY/STAIRWELL - DAY] </p>
<p>(NICK takes a print off of the door. He walks inside the stairwell. He peers over and above the railing.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. PARKING - DAY -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(NICK opens the door and walks outside. He puts his sunglasses on and rounds the corner. He heads for the group of valets. As he approaches, most of them disburse.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, guys. How you doing? Uh, I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab, and I'm ...</p>
<p><strong>Kenny Richmond</strong>: Nick Stokes?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(NICK turns around to look at a valet who's smiling at him in recognition.)</p>
<p><strong>Kenny Richmond</strong>: What's up? It's Kenny! Kenny Richmond. Rebel baseball. I played backup catcher.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Kenny. </p>
<p><strong>Kenny Richmond</strong>: Yeah! </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hi, Kenny!</p>
<p><strong>Kenny Richmond</strong>: Yeah!</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: How you doing, man?</p>
<p><strong>Kenny Richmond</strong>: How you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Good to see you.</p>
<p><strong>Kenny Richmond</strong>: Good to see you! Look at you, man.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Kenny Richmond</strong>: What are you doing here? You a cop now?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Uh, Crime Scene Investigator. I'm on a case.</p>
<p><strong>Kenny Richmond</strong>: Crime scene? Rock on, man. You're here on the tenth floor thing, right?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>Kenny Richmond</strong>: Yeah. I heard about that, man. Everybody's talking about it. Somebody, uh, bashed some chick's brains in, I think, right?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, actually, uh, she had her throat slit and bled out all over the room. I'll know more when I check the surveillance camera.</p>
<p><strong>Kenny Richmond</strong>: Well, what are you doing down here?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Uh, I'm just checking possible escape routes. She was murdered in the room closest to the exit. Murder Central.</p>
<p>(NICK looks up at the hotel building. KENNY glances up, too.)</p>
<p><strong>Kenny Richmond</strong>: Murder Central, huh? Cool.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Camera opens on ALICE DOMINGUEZ'S slit throat. ROBBINS goes over his findings with CATHERINE.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Cut began at the right carotid. Severed the artery and the jugular vein and terminated at the trachea. It's not as deep as I would expect for this kind of crime.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: He sliced her gently?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Well, yeah. Oftentimes, the only thing intact is the spinal column. This did the job and nothing more.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And what did the tox report give us?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Alcohol count was .20.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Double the legal limit.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: There was no limit to Mrs. Dominguez. Blood work showed heavy traces of M.D.M.A.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Ecstasy? And alcohol? Party mix.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Yeah, it might have made her docile.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, maybe it explains why she was cut from the front.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: That may explain her head. Now let's move down to the toes.</p>
<p>(ROBBINS removes a piece of glitter from her toes. Camera zooms in to show that it's purple and has a S-shaped cut out in the middle of the square piece.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Glitter?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Yeah. There is a ... a strip club, um, named Shimmer on industrial. I, uh, recognized the &quot;s&quot; almost immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You go, Doc.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. THE SPHERE - ROOM 869 -- DAY]</p>
<p>(SARA knocks on the door lightly, then opens it. She and WARRICK walk into the room.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hello? Mr. Dominguez?</p>
<p>(They walk into the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Looks like the bed wasn't slept in.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(SARA looks through the suitcase.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Stopped for gas in Barstow. Big tank. $43.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Clothes are still here.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Ford explorer. California plates. Two-Paul-Charlie-Edward-329.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Really?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. THE SPHERE - PARKING GARAGE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(WARRICK, SARA and NICK each walk along the individual garage floors looking for the car.) </p>
<p>(Cut to: NICK approaches a bronco with the license plate 2PCE329. He looks inside the car and sees Mr. Dominguez.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS (STOCK) -- DAY] </p>
<p>[INT. THE SPHERE - PARKING GARAGE - DAY - SHORT TIME LATER]</p>
<p>(The area around the car is taped off. WARRICK, NICK and SARA check the car for evidence.) </p>
<p>(NICK is looking at the dead body in the driver's seat. WARRICK is checking the passenger seat while SARA examines the back.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, Warrick. Take a look at this wound. It's different than the wife's. She was cut from the front.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, this one looks like he was cut from the back.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Mr. Dominguez getting his throat cut from the back. Blood spatters on the rear view mirror.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(SARA opens the back seat and finds the knife on the floor. She picks it up.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey, guys? I got a knife.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - PRINT LAB -- DAY] </p>

<p>(GRISSOM looks around, then they both turn and walk over to the ice machine.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Why did he stick him in the ice machine?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, I checked with the manager. The vic was not registered. No car.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So he had to improvise.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: CAMERON and the husband are out in the parking lot looking for his car.)</p>
<p><strong>Cameron</strong>: Where's your car?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Laggerman</strong>: We took a taxi. Please don't kill me.</p>
<p>(They knock him out, put him in the ice machine, then cut his throat.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, knowing now there was an odd mixture of blood, it's safe to say that someone cut themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Someone's got blood on their hands.</p>
<p>(Camera holds on the print on the ice machine.)</p>

[INT. CSI - HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(NICK rushes through the hallway and bumps into GRISSOM.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mandy and Cameron Klinefeld. I just pulled their license photos off the DMV. Brass showed them to the motel manager. Couldn't I.D., so ... APBs are on the horn.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at the DMV photo but doesn't say anything.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Come on, Grissom. It's got to be them. Who stays at a motel when you live here?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Assume nothing, Nick.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks out of camera frame.)</p>

[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[EXT. HOTEL -- DAY] </p>
<p>(The OFFICER leads BRASS and GRISSOM toward the pool area.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Who found the car?</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Green valley ranch security guard, the one that actually bothers to check the APB list.</p>
<p>(They stop and look around.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Let's see, cabana number four.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: There they are.</p>
<p>(The men head for the couple.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Cameron Klinefeld and Mandy Klinefeld?</p>
<p><strong>Cameron Klinefeld</strong>: (to the other couple) Now that's not the cocktail waitress.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (to the other couple in the cabana) You and you go with this officer, please. Thank you. Thank you. (the couple leaves) You checked into The Fez last night under a false name. We also suspect you of identity theft and felony fraud at The Sphere hotel as well. They don't have the magic fingers bed there, do they?</p>
<p><strong>Cameron Klinefeld</strong>: We were at The Fez last weekend. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks around.)</p>
<p><strong>Cameron Klinefeld</strong>: I got a hooker. She watched. She likes it. It gets her off. What's the problem?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The problem is, people keep showing up dead in your hotel rooms.</p>
<p><strong>Mandy Klinefeld</strong>: (to GRISSOM) What are you looking at, my feet?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No. His feet, actually.</p>
<p>(Camera close up of a piece of glitter stuck to the bottom of his shoe. GRISSOM reaches out and removes it. He holds it out to show them the glitter. Camera zooms in on the glitter piece from &quot;Shimmer&quot;.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Shiny.</p>
<p><strong>Mandy Klinefeld</strong>: Isn't this harassment?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks over and sees the knife cut on her hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How much do you love your wife?</p>
<p>(CAMERON turns to look at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Cameron Klinefeld</strong>: &quot;Love is not love&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Shakespeare?</p>
<p><strong>Cameron Klinefeld</strong>: &quot;Let me not the marriage of true minds...&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: &quot;... admit impediments love is not love ...</p>
<p><strong>Cameron Klinefeld</strong>: ... but bears it out till the edge of doom.&quot; </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: One of the sonnets. Love is conditional.</p>
<p><strong>Cameron Klinefeld</strong>: For most people.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: But not for you.</p>
<p>(CAMERON to turns to look at GRISSOM. They smile at each other.)</p>

<p>(GRISSOM and the other CSIs meet around the conference table.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Okay, here we go. We've got a husband and wife serial team killing couples. So, let's see where we're at starting with the first double murder. Sara?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Bloody knife linking back to Alice Dominguez.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We suspect that Mr. Dominguez was forced to kill his wife for the promise of freedom.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The scenario where the husband holds the knife against his wife's neck while MANDY KLINEFELD stands nearby urging him on.)</p>
<p><strong>Mandy</strong>: Come on. Do it. Just cut her throat, and you can walk out of here.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: That explains the thumbprint I found on the exit door leading to the garage. What, they take him for a walk?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: They were never going to let him go.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: MANDY backs out of the motel room as she looks around to see if it's clear. CAMERON and MR. LAGGERMAN follow. They head for the ice machine.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: MANDY walks out of the hotel room followed by CAMERON and MR. DOMINGUEZ.</p>
<p><strong>Mandy Klinefeld</strong>: Open the door.</p>
<p>(MR. DOMINGUEZ opens the door leaving his thumb print on the door.)</p>

<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Doc Robbins found evidence of glitter on Mrs. Dominguez.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I also found glitter on Mr. Dominguez.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I found some on Mr. Klinefeld's shoes, so it's possible the Klinefeld's picked up their first couple at Shimmer.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Did anyone at Shimmer I.D. the Klinefelds?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to their interview with the DANCER.)</p>
<p><strong>Dancer</strong>: I didn't get a good look at the other two.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We didn't know who they were at the time. Okay ... that's it for the first murder. What about the second?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Uh, we've got prints on quarters.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We do have an admixture of blood off the ice machine.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What about prints on the ice machine knife?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Forget it. Ice destroyed it.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay, so, uh, we're going to have to get into the Klinefelds' house. If they haven't tossed the towels and sheets ... (sighs) ... we may have something.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. COURTROOM -- DAY]</p>
<p>(BRASS and GRISSOM stand in front of the CLERK.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No. Uh, look, there's got to be some mistake. We are this close to busting a pair of serial killers and the Judge won't issue a warrant?</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Gardner (court clerk)</strong>: Hey, I'm just the messenger.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Is he back there? I'm going to talk to him.</p>
<p>(He hands the unsigned affidavit to BRASS.)</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Gardner (court clerk)</strong>: He won't sign it. It's not the first time. Sorry.</p>
<p>(BRASS and GRISSOM head back to the Judge's offices.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[JUDGE SLATER'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(JUDGE SLATER looks at the affidavit.) </p>
<p><strong>Judge Slater</strong>: Look, I have signed hundreds of search warrants for Captain Brass, but ... this affidavit lacks probable cause. Prints on quarters, an admixture of DNA ...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: DNA, if given a warrant, will clear or convict...</p>
<p><strong>Judge Slater</strong>: ... are not enough for me to invade the Klinefelds' right to privacy.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Your Honor, with all due respect, you've signed warrants for less.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Slater</strong>: Yes... and where did it get me? Just last week, the appeals court overturned one of our convictions, based on a search warrant I gave to one of your sidekicks. We make a habit of this, I'm never going to get to the Foley building. Federal appointment. What if they kill again?</p>
<p><strong>Judge Slater</strong>: (continues) All the more reason we need to get this right. Unappealable. The affidavit is thin. You give me more ... I'll give you more.</p>

[INT. CSI - AUDIO/VISUAL LAB] </p>
<p>(NICK is in the lab looking over the video tapes from the bar. CATHERINE walks in from the hallway.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Funny, doesn't look like a doghouse.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Grissom ratted me out, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Um, no, you ratted yourself out. Hey, Nick, I know you're proud of what you do. You're good at what you do, and you want people to know what you do, but once you open your mouth, it's all over 'cause what we say ends up in the news.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I guess I'm learning that the hard way, huh? (They smile at each other.)<br />
All right, (he clears his throat), let's take a look. You see, it looks like something got a little bit more interesting than roulette here.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, if that's the lure, where's the catch?</p>
<p>(NICK fast forwards the video.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: mm-hmm. Clear drinks. What do you want to bet the Rifkins are drinking vodka and the Klinefelds club soda.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hmm. Did you see that? That was a little tongue action right there.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, if we're creatures of habit ... if she stuck her tongue in Mr. Rifkin's ear, chances are she stuck it in Mr. Dominguez's ear, too.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mr. Dominguez has already been autopsied. Washed from head-to-toe.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What about the ice man?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (softly) Coroners.</p>

<p>(DAVID drops the hose.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: What did I do?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Did you go from head to toe or head to toe?</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Any minute now.</p>
<p>(The printer prints the results. GREG looks at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Here it is. Affirmative for female DNA.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Where are the admixture results from the ice machine?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Right here.</p>
<p>(GREG shows GRISSOM the results.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: This is the same woman.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Whoever was in his ear was on that ice machine. She's the killer.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: FRED LAGGERMAN begs for his life.)</p>
<p><strong>Fred Laggerman</strong>: Please, let me go. Please, let me go.</p>

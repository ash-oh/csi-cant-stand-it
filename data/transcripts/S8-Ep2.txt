<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) – NIGHT]</p>
<p>[INT. CSI – HALLWAY – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Sara walks through the hallway. Her arm is in a sling. She walks past the Print Lab. Mandy looks up from her worktable and watches her go.) </p>
<p>(Sara continues through the hallway.) </p>
<p>(She walks past the Trace Lab. Hodges looks up from his work and watches her go.) </p>
<p>[INT. CSI – ECKLIE'S OFFICE – CONTINUING]</p>
<p>(Ecklie closes the file folder. He's on the phone waiting for someone to pick up.) </p>
<p>(Sara appears in the doorway and knocks lightly on the door to get Ecklie's attention. He looks up and motions her inside as he stands up at his desk.) </p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: (to Sara) Have a seat.</p>
<p>(The line clicks and the recorded message switches on.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (answering machine) This is Grissom.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: (to Sara) How's the arm?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (answering machine) Please leave a detailed message after the tone.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Fractured in two places.</p>
<p>(Sara sits down.) </p>
<p>(The machine beeps.)</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: (to phone) Gil, Conrad again. Um ... message number three. Call me back please.</p>
<p>(He smiles at her and hangs up.) </p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: It's feeling better?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Good.</p>
<p>(beat) </p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: So, you must know where he is.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Actually, I don't.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Really?</p>
<p>(He picks up his folder.) </p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Okay ... um ... Look, I don't want to play any games here. This is as difficult for me as it is for you.</p>
<p>(He closes the office door.)</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: So let's just ... uh ... get this over with, shall we? </p>
<p>(He sits down on the other side of his desk and opens his notebook.) </p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Okay then ... uh ... this is an administrative inquiry. You and your supervisor were in direct violation of lab policy ...</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (corrects) &quot;Are.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: &quot;Are&quot; in direct violation of lab policy, which states that members of the same forensic team may not engage in a romantic relationship. So when did you and Supervisor Grissom begin your relationship?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We've always had a relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: I mean, when did you become intimate?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Two years ago. I think it was a Sunday.</p>
<p>(HOLD on ECKLIE.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. ROAD – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(SLOW MOTION. VIEW of the desert road at a SLOW 360 degree turn. For the moment, WE are the OBJECT turning.) </p>
<p>MUSIC STARTS: &quot;An der Schonen Blauden Donau,&quot; Op. 314 (On the Beautiful Blue Danube&quot;) by Johann Strauss</p>
<p>(A round object comes into view. It rolls and turns as it bounces off the pavement and continues down the road.) </p>
<p>(The round object bounces along the pavement, leaving dark, circular splotches on the road.)</p>
<p>(A truck heads its way and it hits the bouncing object.) </p>
<p>SIDE VIEW</p>
<p>(Like a basketball, the bouncing object bounces against the truck and the pavement until the truck passes over it.) </p>
<p>TOP VIEW DOWN</p>
<p>(The object stops in the middle of the road.) </p>
<p>-- AND NIGHT TURNS INTO DAY – </p>
<p>(The object hasn't moved.) </p>
<p>(Another truck passes by, knocking the round object off the road.) </p>
<p>(The object skips and hits the pavement as it heads over to a group of highwaymen in orange vests cleaning the roadside.) </p>
<p>(The object bounces off the pavement and onto the dirt, where it rolls to a STOP right in front of one of the men.) </p>
<p>(He looks and sees that it's a HEAD in a football HELMET.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. ROADSIDE – DAY]</p>
<p>(Grissom leans forward and looks at the head closely. Yep, it's a head. The helmet is for the SVHS cobras.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Ezekiel Holstein</strong>: (o.s.) Sagebrush Valley High School.</p>
<p>(Detective Ezekiel Holstein and Nick look closely at the head in the helmet.) </p>
<p><strong>Ezekiel Holstein</strong>: The Cobras.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: He looks like he could still be in high school. Boy, football's gotten a lot more brutal since my playing days.</p>
<p><strong>Ezekiel Holstein</strong>: Yeah, where's the rest of him, still on the field?</p>
<p>(Nick looks down the long stretch of highway before them.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: There's no high school football fields around here anyway. What do you think, Grissom?</p>
<p>(Grissom studies the head.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: &quot;Ichabod was horror-struck on perceiving that he was headless.&quot;</p>
<p>[Note: &quot;The Legend of Sleepy Hollow,&quot; by Washington Irving]</p>
<p>(Nick grins and looks at Holstein.) </p>
<p>HOLD on the HEAD.</p>
<p>SMASH CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[EXT. ROADSIDE – DAY]</p>
<p>(Grissom's phone rings. He's still at the crime scene and he steps away to check it.)<br />
INCOMING CALL<br />
CONRAD ECKLIE</p>
<p>(Grissom shuts his phone without answering it. He walks over to Nick who is in the middle of the road looking at the bloodstain.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Blood pool tells me the helmet must've been here for a while.</p>
<p>(Grissom looks at the stain.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Vehicle tire rolled through it. Helmet has black abrasions on it consistent with being hit by a tire.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Probably got pinballed down the road.</p>
<p>(Greg joins them.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I checked with Traffic. No reports of any traffic accidents near here. Uh, Holstein's getting an absentee list from the high school.</p>
<p>(Nick nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Head's over there. Blood trail leads up from here. We follow the blood.</p>
<p>(Grissom starts walking.) </p>
<p>(Greg walks up to Nick.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (low whisper) He say anything about what's happening with Sara?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (shakes his head) No.</p>
<p>(They turn and follow Grissom down the road.) </p>
<p>(Nick stops, puts an evidence marker down on the road. Greg raises the camera and takes a photo.) </p>
<p>VARIOUS DISSOLVES: </p>
<p>(Grissom continues looking at the blood trail.) </p>
<p>(A camera clicks.) </p>
<p>(Grissom points to something.) </p>
<p>(The camera shutter clicks again.) </p>
<p>(Grissom continues further down the road. Nick and Greg are a little ways behind documenting the blood trail.) </p>
<p>(Nick looks out at Grissom, a good distance away from them.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (to Greg) Hey, did Sara ever say anything to you about her and Grissom?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Not in so many words.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So you knew about the two of them?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (shrugs) Yeah.</p>
<p>(Greg continues down the road. Nick spreads his arms wide.) </p>
<p>(Meanwhile, Grissom finds more bloodstains on the road. This one veers off to the side. He follows the fluid trail in the dirt. He heads for the bushes and finds a body without a head.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p>(Nick and Greg appear.) </p>
<p>(Nick takes his glasses off and sighs from the smell.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Where's the uniform? (He kneels next to the body.) If he's not a player, what's with the helmet?</p>
<p>(They note that the left hand is missing.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Maybe he's a rabid fan. There were all kinds of high school games last night.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Where's his hand?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (o.s.) Got to be around here somewhere.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – AUTOPSY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Nick takes prints off the dead man's hand. The door opens and Robbins walks in.) </p>
<p>(In the foreground, David Phillips is struggling to get the helmet off the body.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: The hand -- where did you find it?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Twenty yards away, two hours later.</p>
<p>(David isn't having any success with getting the head out of the helmet. Robbins goes to check on him.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: David, he doesn't look prepped. What's taking so long?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: I can't get the helmet off.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I better get this ten-card to Mandy right away.</p>
<p>(Nick leaves with the print card. Robbins puts his cane aside and assists.) </p>
<p>(Robbins holds the head; David holds the helmet and they pull.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Hold it.</p>
<p>(They get the head out of the helmet. Robbins sighs.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: His face looks like hamburger.</p>
<p>(Robbins snaps photos of the victim's face.) </p>
<p>(He picks up the envelope and comb. He combs the debris from the hair into the envelope. Some black powder falls into the envelope.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: I found the same black powder on his clothes.</p>
<p>(Robbins looks at him.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – HALLWAY/ PRINT LAB – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Nick walks into the print lab and gives the card to Mandy.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, Mandy. I got a ten-card on our John Doe.</p>
<p><strong>Mandy</strong>: Well, let's see if it matches the safe-kit that Holstein brought in. Only have one more kid unaccounted for at that high school.</p>
<p>(Mandy takes the envelope from Nick and heads into her lab.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, if you had a kid, would you collect a safe-kit on them?</p>
<p><strong>Mandy</strong>: Why not? It's better to be prepared. Think of it as a cheap insurance policy.</p>
<p>(Mandy visually checks the two sets of prints.) </p>
<p><strong>Mandy</strong>: It's just a print card, a cheek swab and a photo.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Then go to bed every night hoping you don't have to use it.</p>
<p><strong>Mandy</strong>: Mm ... well, there's a match. Your John Doe is Vincent Bartley.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Mandy</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(She hands Vincent Bartley's file to Nick.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay, good. Thanks.</p>
<p>(He heads out.) </p>
<p><strong>Mandy</strong>: You're welcome.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) – NIGHT]</p>
<p>[INT. BLIND – LOBBY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(The place is quiet as people speak in hushed tones. Techs snap photos and officers take statements. An officer talks with two women.) </p>
<p><strong>Shasta McCloud</strong>: Well, nothing. I mean, it was dark.</p>
<p><strong>April Kissimee</strong>: It was really dark.</p>
<p>(Warrick and Catherine walk in with their kits.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: One minute we're married, and the next ...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You know what? Good for you. Divorces should be like Band-Aids, one quick yank and done.</p>
<p>(They note the people sitting at the tables.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You think?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, what do I know? Eddie and I stayed together way too long. Every decision was an act of Congress.</p>
<p>(Warrick and Catherine leave the main room and turn into the dining area.) </p>
<p>[INT. BLIND – DINING ROOM – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The officer at the door lets them in. Catherine and Warrick note the food and the tables. They find Brass standing next to the dead body on the floor.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: It's the end of an era, ladies and gentlemen. Hampton Huxley, publisher of Hux magazine -- where boys became men, and men became more manly -- has died. </p>
<p>(Catherine puts her kit down as she waits for David Phillips to finish with the body.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: That magazine got me through Vietnam.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Oh, that would explain the lookers out front. They were Kitties.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yes, Kitties, indeed. He was dining with a couple of them when he bought the farm. Miss Summer and Miss Winter, I believe.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Every male in the Phillips family gets a lifetime subscription to Hux for his Bar Mitzvah. </p>
<p>(He turns and looks at the dead body.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: I guess my sons will have to settle for a Cross pen.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm sure the magazine will go on without him, Dave.</p>
<p>(David nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What are we looking at?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Puncture wound. Um ... no abrasion ring. But I can re-approximate the skin.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So it's probably not a gunshot. (David nods.) Stabbing?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Maybe. Right through the temple, into the brain. Be lights out in seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It's a crowded restaurant. Somebody must have seen something.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Not exactly. Welcome to the latest fad. Dining in the dark.</p>
<p>(Brass holds up the remote. He presses the button and the lights go out. The shades on the windows lower.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Waiters are blind. No one sees anything. Piece of cake, huh?</p>
<p>(The blinds close. Everyone is in the dark.) </p>
<p>[BLACK SCREEN]</p>
<p>(They hear the soft sounds of footfalls as someone leaves.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) Did he just leave?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (V.O.) I think so.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: (V.O.) Guys? I-I have a dead body here.</p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[INT. BLIND – LOBBY – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(TOP VIEW DOWN. A waiter dressed in black walks on screen. The tray of food is illuminated like a work of art. As he walks, the waiter vanishes ... only the food remains as it is carried across the room.) </p>
<p><strong>Pippa Sanchez</strong>: (V.O.) Dining should be an experience, like opera or art. It should feed the soul as well as the belly. You should smell it, touch it and let it rest on your tongue. </p>
<p>VARIOUS IMAGES OF WOMEN EATING</p>
<p><strong>Pippa Sanchez</strong>: (V.O.) I'm selling sensuality here. I encourage eating with your hands. Texture is crucial. The salty, meaty flesh of lobster drenched in creamy, clarified French butter. The pulpy seeded flesh and firm skin of a fresh fig dipped in honey. The tongue understands four major taste groups – </p>
<p>CGI ZOOM INTO THE MOUTH AND HIGH POWERED IMAGE OF THE TASTE BUDS ON THE TONGUE</p>
<p><strong>Pippa Sanchez</strong>: (V.O.) -- salty, sweet, sour, bitter -- and has over 10,000 taste buds, -- </p>
<p>CGI ZAP! PULSES TRAVEL FROM THE NERVES TO THE BRAIN</p>
<p><strong>Pippa Sanchez</strong>: (V.O.) -- each with a direct connection to the pleasure center of the brain, triggering endorphins. The anticipation and the release of eating good food is chemically quite similar -- </p>
<p>END CGI</p>
<p>(The chef, Pippa Sanchez, talks with Brass.) </p>
<p><strong>Pippa Sanchez</strong>: -- to getting high on drugs.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: And apparently just as dangerous.</p>
<p>(As they talk, a CSI tech takes Pippa's prints.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So tell me what happened.</p>
<p><strong>Pippa Sanchez</strong>: I don't know. Each one of the waiters has one of those clickers. If there's an emergency, the houselights come up and a red light goes off in the kitchen.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: A woman screams. The alarm buzzes and Pippa Sanchez comes running out of the kitchen.) </p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: Somebody help! WOMAN: Help! Help him!</p>
<p>(Pippa reaches the room and finds the screaming woman standing next to Hampton Huxley on the floor.) </p>
<p><strong>Pippa Sanchez</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>April Kissimee</strong>: Hux!</p>
<p><strong>Pippa Sanchez</strong>: Call 9-1-1.</p>
<p>(End flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, so you didn't see anything?</p>
<p><strong>Pippa Sanchez</strong>: I'm in the kitchen. I have two sittings a night, at 7:00 and<br />
10:00, average 25 heads, ten courses per. I have no time to pee.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. BLIND – DINING ROOM – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Catherine has a floor map of the room and a seating chart.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: April was here ... and Huxley was here.</p>
<p>(She and Warrick are putting name place cards down on the table. They finish with the Huxley table. Catherine puts the chart down. Warrick puts his goggles on and turns on the ALS.) </p>
<p>(He checks the overturned chair.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Okay. Got blood on the chair.</p>
<p>(Catherine picks up a discarded napkin off the floor and looks at it. Warrick finds more blood drops.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Blood on the tablecloth.</p>
<p>(He works his way around the table.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Blood drops on the floor, leading away from Hux's chair.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Stab him. Extract the weapon—drip, drip, drip.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: And they end here.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Near Ms. Shasta.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. BLIND – LOBBY – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Brass talks with Shasta McCloud, the woman in the black dress, while the woman in the pink dress is there.) </p>
<p><strong>Shasta McCloud</strong>: Shasta McCloud -- big &quot;M,&quot; little &quot;c,&quot; big &quot;C,&quot; plus &quot;loud.&quot;<br />
McCloud.</p>
<p><strong>April Kissimee</strong>: On TV, they never show anyone bleeding from a heart attack.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Is that what you think happened?</p>
<p><strong>April Kissimee</strong>: Well, yeah. I mean, all that Prevalis and diet soda. I just figured ...</p>
<p><strong>Shasta McCloud</strong>: April, shh! He was an animal until the day he died, sir.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>April Kissimee</strong>: Wait a minute. What did happen?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well-well, you're the one with blood on you. Maybe you can tell me.</p>
<p><strong>April Kissimee</strong>: I thought he just fell asleep like he always does at the end of meals.</p>

<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Oh ... uh ... it had something sticky on it, so I bagged it for Trace. (He holds up the bag.) But if you want, we could put it back on for the photo op.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: No, that's okay; let's get to cutting.</p>
<p>(David picks up the bone saw.) </p>
<p>(He turns the saw on as Robbins makes the initial cut on Hampton Huxley's skull.) </p>
<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO: </p>
<p>(Robbins examines Huxley's brain.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Embedded horizontally in the parenchyma of the right temporal lobe is a linear, silver-toned, metal tube that tapers to a point. And in this case, David, the pen may be mightier than the sword.</p>
<p>INSERT: CGI</p>
<p>(The pen punctures through the head into the brain where the tip breaks off as it's extracted.) </p>
<p>(The blood and ink drip out.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. PD – BRASS'S OFFICE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(He empties Shasta's bag onto the desk and finds her cell phone, wallet and other items stained with leaky ink.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Shasta McCloud</strong>: Okay, that pen's not mine.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah. Nice try, sweetheart.</p>
<p>(Shasta sighs and sits down.) </p>
<p><strong>Shasta McCloud</strong>: Excuse me. Can I be Lucy Logic for a bit? First of all, that purse is designer. There's no way I'm ruining it with ink.</p>
<p>(April shakes her head at Brass in agreement.) </p>
<p><strong>Shasta McCloud</strong>: Second of all, I know where my bread is buttered. Hux was my meal ticket -- kill him, go hungry.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Unless you're in the will.</p>
<p>(Both April and Shasta laugh.) </p>
<p><strong>Shasta McCloud</strong>: Kitties don't get in the will. Besides, if I had touched that thing, wouldn't I have ink on my hands?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Shasta McCloud</strong>: Whoever did it ditched the pen in my bag. It was on the back of my chair the whole time. It could have been anyone.</p>
<p><strong>April Kissime</strong>: What about the guy who assaulted me?</p>
<p><strong>Shasta McCloud</strong>: Look, if you really want a suspect, you need to check out little Miss Chef Lady.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Little Miss Chef Lady? Why is that?</p>
<p><strong>April Kissime</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>Shasta McCloud</strong>: Duh, she's ... Winter Issue? 1995.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. PD – INTERVIEW ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Brass sits at the table looking at a magazine centerfold.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You certainly weren't hiding anything back then. Hmm?</p>
<p>(He closes the magazine and looks at Pippa Sanchez.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Ms. Sanchez, according to your fellow Kitties, you and Huxley had a falling out. It's curious that you didn't mention that.</p>
<p><strong>Pippa Sanchez</strong>: I didn't mention it, because it's ancient history. Twelve years ago, a misogynist told me I should eat less. And today, I now have a hot restaurant on the Strip and two contracts for spots in LA and Chicago. &quot;Food Seduction&quot; is a best-seller. I think I won that battle already.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, did you and Huxley speak to each other last night?</p>
<p><strong>Pippa Sanchez</strong>: His reservation was booked under a pseudonym. I didn't even know he was there. Mr. Brass, do you know why I started my restaurant?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No. Tell me.</p>
<p><strong>Pippa Sanchez</strong>: Because I fell in love with a blind man. He would turn off the lights and feed me. When you deprive one sense, other senses are heightened. My only focus was on my tongue. It was brilliant. And then he died. And this restaurant is an homage to him—to our love affair.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: How nice for you. </p>
<p><strong>Pippa Sanchez</strong>: I don't mean to be crude, but a murder is, quite frankly, bad for business.</p>

<p>[INT. CSI – LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Warrick takes one of the napkins out of the package and puts it in the video spectral comparator.) </p>
<p>VARIOUS DISSOLVES.</p>
<p>(He takes the napkin out and grabs the next package where he does the same for the next napkin and the next napkin.) </p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[INT. CSI – LAYOUT ROOM – DAY]</p>
<p>(Catherine looks at the morgue photos and spreads them out on the table. She opens the file folder and looks at the photos of various items -- of a watch, wallet and toupee.) </p>
<p>(In the file, she sees:<br />
8) TOUPEE AUTOPSY – D. HODGES TRACE. IDENTIFY UNKNOWN STICKY SUBSTANCE</p>
<p>(Warrick finishes the napkins. He looks at the napkins under various lights in the VSC and finds a print on one of them.) </p>
<p>(Catherine finds the analysis for the sticky substance: HONEY.) </p>
<p>(Warrick walks into the room with his results.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, Huxley had honey on his hairpiece, ink in his brain and blood all over. There were three people who had honey on their hands: the frisky couple and Michael. Two people who had blood on their clothing: April and Michael. And there was a total of five people moving around the room: two Manducci brothers and all three waiters. Now, that's a lot of lists for Michael to turn up on. He does work there, so there's reason for it, but ...</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, there's no reason for this: Michael's print in ink, on a napkin.</p>
<p>(He shows her the print.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What would he have against Huxley?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: His prints hit back to an old work card. The guy used to be a chef.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: A blind chef?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: He lost his sight a few years back. But before that, guess who was his sous-chef?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. PD – INTERVIEW ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Catherine reads to Michael Bowie from Pippa Sanchez's book) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (reads) &quot;The man knew his way around a kitchen, and his way into my heart. Michael would spend hours teaching me, feeding me ... loving me.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, you're the dead guy?</p>
<p><strong>Michael Bowie</strong>: She seduces me, steals my recipes, my ideas, my investors. And then she hires me as a freaking waiter. Night after night, I listen to her tell stories of the tragic love affair, of the poor, dead blind guy. Last night, I finally confronted her. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Michael talks with Pippa.) </p>
<p><strong>Michael Bowie</strong>: I deserve a piece of the action.</p>
<p><strong>Pippa Sanchez</strong>: At $200 a head, you're clearing at least $1,000 in tips at night. That's a lot of action for a blind man.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Bowie</strong>: I made you.</p>
<p><strong>Pippa Sanchez</strong>: You're fired. We're done.</p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: But why kill Huxley? Why not just her?</p>
<p><strong>Michael Bowie</strong>: I'm blind. She's not. But in that dining room, everybody else is blind, too. And when Huxley walked in with his Kitties, it was like a sign from the gods. I knew I could destroy her and the restaurant.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Hampton Huxley eats an oyster.) </p>
<p><strong>Michael Bowie</strong>: (V.O.) I waited till the oyster course. The shells clanging, and slurping, the &quot;oohing,&quot; the &quot;aahing, I knew it would cover any noise I was going to make.</p>
<p>(As they eat, Michael stabs him with the pen.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Michael Bowie</strong>: I wanted her rotting in jail, eating bologna sandwiches.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: If you wanted to frame Pippa, why did you plant the pen in Shasta's purse?</p>
<p><strong>Michael Bowie</strong>: I tell everyone to put their purses and jackets on the back of the chairs, so I knew exactly where her purse was.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Michael puts the dripping pen in the purse. He wipes his hands on the napkin and drops the napkin on the floor.) </p>
<p><strong>Michael Bowie</strong>: Old cat frames young Kitty. Kind of perfect.</p>

<p>[INT. CSI – GRISSOM'S OFFICE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Greg and Nick report back to Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: We found high velocity blood spatter inside the rear wheel well of the victim's cart, which means he lost his head at high speed.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So how did Hot Rod decapitate Vinnie while racing down a highway at 60 miles an hour?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Maybe he didn't.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, people's heads just don't fly off for no reason. Well, I mean, maybe we should check the scene for some wires or branches, or something he could've run into.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: If it would've happened that way, we would've found trace from whatever did it. The only trace in the neck and arm wounds was rubber from truck tires.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Which was present on both sides of his wounds but not on his clothing.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: There were blown-out tire fragments all over the road.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: But we found his body off the road. There shouldn't be any transfer from truck tires.</p>
<p>(Grissom thinks about it.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Unless ...</p>
<p>(Nick and Greg exchange looks.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI -- LAB] </p>
<p>(Grissom is revving up a rubber tire. In the background, Ecklie passes in the hallway and stops when he sees Greg and Nick setting up the Jell-O bust. They secure the bust at about the same height as the go-cart.) </p>
<p>(Ecklie walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: What's going on here?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We're trying to determine whether a steel-belted truck tire can decapitate a kid driving a go-cart.</p>
<p>(Nick puts the helmet on the bust.) </p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: I thought that was an urban myth.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Myths, legends, tall tales -- they all come from something real.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: If that go-cart was going 60 miles an hour drafting a truck going the same speed, and that truck blows a tire, sending a two-pound projectile into the driver's neck ...</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Yeah, the combined speed of impact would be 120 miles an hour. Which is about ...</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: 962 foot-pounds of energy.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: All right, let's go, fellas.</p>
<p>(Nick pats the helmet secure on the bust. He and Greg get up and move behind the shield. Ecklie doesn't move. They can't do the experiment until Ecklie moves.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Come on, Conrad. There's always room for Jell-O.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: (mutters) It's expensive Jell-O.</p>
<p>(Ecklie grabs protective head gear and moves behind the shield with the others.) </p>
<p>(Grissom picks up some rubber, -- </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (excitedly) I love this.</p>
<p>-- then sends it through the rolling tires.) </p>
<p>SLOW MOTION. The rubber hits the helmet and knocks the head off the bust.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [NIGHT] During the race, Vincent doesn't pass the truck. The truck hits a piece of rubber on the road, sending it back toward Vincent, hitting him on the shoulder. He blocks it and continues racing.) </p>
<p>(The truck hits more pieces of rubber on the road, sending it back toward Vincent. He raises his hand to block it. The rubber cuts off his head and his hand.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p>SLOW MOTION. The rubber knocks the head off the bust.</p>
<p>(The helmet and Jell-O bounce off the lab floor.) </p>
<p>(Ecklie looks at them.) </p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Well, it worked. See if we can't reuse some of that.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Two years ago. Why? What did you tell him?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Nine years ago.</p>
<p>(Sara laughs.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The Forensic Academy Conference?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(She laughs.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You ... uh ... had too many questions about anthropology, for some reason. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, I was stalling. I was trying to get the nerve to ask you to dinner. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You had a ponytail.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'm going to move to swing.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We talked about this. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I know that you said that you would do it, but I don't want to do that to the team. Besides ... I am sure that I could use more daylight in my life.</p>
<p>(Grissom is quiet. He nods.) </p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Whoo! (to Sara) You ... uh ... you want a ride?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Wish I could.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What about you, Ricky Bobby?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No, thanks, I like to watch.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(Nick laughs, shuts the visor and heads off on his way. Sara turns at Grissom.)</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah, you should go.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Okay.</p>

<p>(Grissom starts the cart, gives her a thumbs-up sign and races around the track with the others. They're like a bunch of little kids.) </p>

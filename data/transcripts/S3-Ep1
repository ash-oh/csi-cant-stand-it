<p>FLASH TO WHITE:</p>

[INT. RIO HOTEL - BACK ROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Camera view looking in on a group of poker players in a quiet room. It's a high-stakes game.</p>
<p><strong>Dealer</strong>: Start with you, sir?</p>
<p>(GRINDER knocks his fist on the table three times.)</p>
<p><strong>Grinder</strong>: Check.</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong>: He doesn't bet, but he keeps a beat. You check. Someone's on a flush draw. Mm, I'll take the free card. Check.</p>
<p><strong>Lita Gibbons</strong>: I'll check.</p>
<p>(LITA puts some eye drops in her eyes.)</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong>: What do you got, Candyman?</p>
<p>(DOYLE PFEIFFER, the Candyman, puts some candy in his mouth. The waitress approaches the table to refresh the drinks. She stops by MATT first. He puts a chip on her tray as she serves the drinks.)</p>
<p><strong>Doyle Pfeiffer</strong>: Check.</p>
<p><strong>Waitress</strong>: (to Matt) Thank you very much.</p>
<p>(The waitress moves to serve DOYLE PFEIFFER. She puts a drink in front of him and he gives her his empty glass. MATT notices the slight.)</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong>: (mutters) &quot;Stiff&quot; ... typical.</p>
<p>(The Grinder looks at his cards.)</p>
<p><strong>Grinder</strong>: I can bet. Make it ... $2,000.</p>
<p>(The Grinder puts a short stack of blue chips in the middle of the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong>: The Grinder speaks.</p>
<p>(Matt puts his chips in. DOYLE PFEIFFER doesn't hesitate.)</p>
<p><strong>Doyle Pfeiffer</strong>: We raise $4,000.</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong>: Call the bet.</p>
<p><strong>Dealer</strong>: $2,000. Raise you $2,000.</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong>: It's all about you, Grinder.</p>
<p><strong>Grinder</strong>: I'm going to go get a $2,000 slice of pizza.</p>
<p>(The Grinder folds. LITA GIBBONS smiles.)</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong>: Well ... might as well make It a poker game. I'm all in. What do you got, Southern Iowa?</p>
<p><strong>Lita Gibbons</strong>: A pain in the ass to my right side.</p>
<p>(LITA GIBBONS folds. There are only two players left in the game.)</p>
<p><strong>Doyle Pfeiffer</strong>: Um... yeah, you might have a winning hand. You might be just trying to buy it. Johnny Chan thought I was too old, too back in the '86 series.</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong>: You mean, the series where the ball went through Buckner's legs?</p>
<p><strong>Doyle Pfeiffer</strong>: Save the story, kid. Here's what's what. I got aces. What do you got? Maybe you got trips, maybe king, queen. Maybe you got two pair. Ace hits the board ... I win. Club hits the board ... I win. </p>
<p>(He pops in a piece of candy.) </p>
<p><strong>Doyle Pfeiffer</strong>: Eight, nine hits the board ... </p>
<p>(He pops in another piece of candy.) </p>
<p><strong>Doyle Pfeiffer</strong>: I win.</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong>: Here's the matter old man. Thirteen of every suit in the deck. I see three clubs. That means you've got ten coming 37 cards left in the deck. You like those odds?</p>
<p><strong>Doyle Pfeiffer</strong>: I like 'em a lot better than I like you.</p>
<p>(DOYLE PFEIFFER moves to gather his chips. His hands freeze and he starts to convulse. His entire body starts to spasm uncontrollably. The players around the table stare aghast at the man.)</p>
<p>(DOYLE PFEIFFER lands face forward on the table. Dead.)</p>
<p>FLASH TO WHITE:</p>
<hr />
[INT. RIO HOTEL -- CASINO MAIN FLOOR -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM is standing next to a machine in the middle of the main floor. WARRICK approaches him.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You lost?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm listening.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: E-C-G ... C major chord. All the slots play the same notes -- perfect harmony. Makes people happy.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, except when you're losing. Then you don't hear anything.</p>
<p>(WARRICK leaves. After a moment, GRISSOM follows. WARRICK and GRISSOM walk along the casino floor to the yellow taped off area. EMT HANK PEDDIGREW passes them on his way out.)</p>
<p><strong>Hank</strong>: Hey, guys.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey, Hank.</p>
<p><strong>Hank</strong>: Sara with you?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: She's over there.</p>
<p>(WARRICK indicates somewhere in front.)</p>
<p><strong>Hank</strong>: Tell her I said hi.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM glances back at HANK PEDDIGREW as WARRICK answers.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Will do.</p>
<p><strong>Hank</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>(HANK continues on his way. WARRICK and GRISSOM reach the crime scene. They duck under the crime tape and head into the private gaming room.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. RIO HOTEL - BACK ROOM - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Camera close up of the body bag being zipped closed. BRASS watches. He turns around just as WARRICK and GRISSOM enter the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Doyle Pfeiffer, best poker player in the world. Eighteen hours ago he sits down at the table a healthy man. A half an hour ago, he drops dead in his chair.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: That's a big pot. Casino's not satisfied with a heart attack?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We're not satisfied. This is high stakes. We're treating it like a murder.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Suspicious circs.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Mmm.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You ever played poker, Warrick?</p>
<p>(WARRICK ducks his head.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Nah. Poker's not gambling. It's playing against percentages. It's a skill. I like to play for the thrill.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM reaches for the hand nearest him and flips the two cards over. It's a King of Hearts and a King of Spades.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Whose hand was this?</p>
<p>(From beyond the doorway, MATT yells into the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong>: Mine! That pot's mine. He dropped dead before he went all in!</p>
<p>(OFFICERS lead MATT away from the doorway.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Some young, loud-mouthed player thinks it's his pot.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mmm.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM reaches for the hand nearest him and flips the card over.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Two cowboys -- one in the flop, trips. </p>
<p>(The camera pans slowly across the table to a hand that's flipped over showing a King of Clubs, a Queen of Clubs, an Eight of clubs and an unknown card of diamonds. GRISSOM reaches for another hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Pair of aces.</p>
<p>(It's an Ace of clubs and an Ace of diamonds.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No river card, though. Burn one, turn one.</p>
<p>(WARRICK puts the top card aside and flips over the second card.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Ace of spades.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The Death Card.</p>

<p>FADE IN:</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS DESERT (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<hr />
[EXT. FRENCHMAN AIR FIELD -- DAY]</p>
<p>(Camera low on the ground as CATHERINE exits the Tahoe. She joins NICK and they both walk to the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Who called it in?</p>
<p><strong>Lockwood</strong>: Western LVU ornithology student. Saw turkey vultures. Got curious.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE puts her kit down and crouches low to examine the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Birds of prey beat maggots to a body-- impressive. Gunshot. Entry just below the cheek. Not much blood, no blood pools.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Means he wasn't shot here.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Where exactly is &quot;here?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Lockwood</strong>: Frenchman airfield -- it's an old landing strip hasn't been used since the '60s.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, it's flat. You could still land a plane here.</p>
<p><strong>Lockwood</strong>: Yeah, but in the middle of nowhere?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Perfect place to dump a body.</p>
<p>(Camera holds on turkey vultures.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. RIO HOTEL - BACK ROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(WARRICK, GRISSOM and SARA examine the room. From outside the room, the camera moves in slow. SARA finds a single abandoned piece of &quot;Choco-Bees&quot; on the floor. She picks it up and stands. She holds it out in front of her.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I got chocolate.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What color is it?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Green ... You know what they say about the green ones.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM doesn't look up.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Bag it separately.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. RIO HOTEL &amp; CASINO - OUTSIDE BACK ROOM -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(MATT, the person, who played poker against the deceased stands outside the crime scene area with BRASS. He's rather upset that the ownership of the pot is in question.)</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong>: But you agree with me, right? It's a forfeit. Doyle never went all in. He can wipe his ass with those aces river card or no river card. I beat him. It's a forfeit. </p>
<p>(BRASS holds up a finger to get MATT'S attention.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Look ... look. Shh ... see this badge? I'm not with the gaming commission. You got a problem with gaming, see the guy in the bad suit. </p>
<p>(Camera cuts to an older man standing off to the side speaking with an officer.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Here's the deal: Pending an investigation, it's our pot.</p>
<p>(MATT doesn't like it one bit.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. RIO HOTEL &amp; CASINO - BACK GAMING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(WARRICK holds an ALS to the seat of a chair. It glows.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Is that what I think it is?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Urine, maybe. Game like this, leaving the table early could be perceived as a sign of weakness.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Tell me they Scotchguard these things.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Why don't you tell me when you take it back to the lab and process it?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yay. </p>
<p>(SARA picks up the chair and walks toward the exit.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: How is it that you know so much about poker?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM writes on the plastic bag.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's how I financed my first body farm in college.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You're kidding. Wow. I'm impressed. I mean, the fact that you sat at a table with actual living beings.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well ... poker's not a game of interaction. It's a game of observation. I used to study people. And then I guess I, uh ... got bored. Now I study evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What I don't get is it's not like we've never talked about gambling before. How come you never mention it?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Same reason a good player hides his &quot;tells.&quot; </p>
<p>(WARRICK nods his head.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: He doesn't want to be exposed.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - FAST-MOTION - NIGHT]</p>

[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- NIGHT]</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: You know why Steve Wynn hired Bobby Baldwin to run The Nugget, then The Mirage, The Bellagio? He was a great poker player, Great Thinker.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I did not know that.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Stop the world. No violaceous lividity prominent above the level of the shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So no heart attack?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Not ruling out stroke, but check out the mees lines in his fingernails. </p>
<p>(ROBBINS lifts up the deceased's hands to show the fingernails. Camera close-up to the fingernails. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Milky, vomit-like fluid in the corners of his mouth ...</p>
<p>(Camera close-up to DOYLE PFEIFFER'S face and the white fluid in the corner of his mouth. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: ... single blue line running across his gums ... </p>
<p>(ROBBINS opens the deceased's mouth. Camera moves in close-up to focus on the blue line above the teeth. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: ... all the earmarks of lead poisoning.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I haven't seen a case of lead poisoning in years.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: What's that look like to you?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and ROBBINS move to the viewbox. ROBBINS points to a specific film.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It looks like he's got a bullet in his thigh.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: It's probably been there quite a while leeching lead into his system.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Enough to kill him?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: I'll know better when I get the tox screen back and examine the brain.</p>
<p>(ROBBINS smiles.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - AUDIO/VISUAL LAB]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM sits alone in the Audio/Visual room viewing the security camera tape of the poker table. He fast-fowards and stops. The VCR whirring is the only sound in the room. GRISSOM doesn't take his eyes off of the screen.)</p>
<p>(From XX:XX:42 to XX:XX:48, the camera shows the poker game with the Candyman every now and then eating chocolate candies during the game.)</p>
<p>(From 1:01:XX the game continues.)</p>
<p>(From 1:03:21 to 1:03:32, camera angles change from directly above the game to a close up of The Grinder.)</p>
<p>(Fast forward to 1:04 to 1:05, the camera angle changes to show LITA GIBBONS using eye drops.)</p>
<p>(Something occurs to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Everyone has a tell, don't they, Lita?</p>
<p>(Camera holds on LITA GIBBONS using eye drops.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI -- LAB]</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: A whiskey sour, huh? Yeah, I'm a &quot;thug passion&quot; man, myself. It's a Tupack thing. (GREG mispronounces Tupac.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Tupac?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: So, what does your paramedic like to drink? I bet with a name like &quot;Hank,&quot; he's probably got some ho's sipping on 'yac.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: &quot;Yac&quot;? Cognac? No. &quot;Ho's?&quot; I'm not going there and, um, that's none of your business. It's nobody's business, as a matter of fact.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: All right, well, I won't tell Warrick and Nick about Hank on one condition ... you tell me what he's got that I don't got?</p>
<p>(SARA smiles at GREG just as the printer prints out the test results. SARA picks up the paper and reads it.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: There was tetrahydrozoline in the victim's drink.</p>
<p>(Taking the sheet of paper with her, SARA moves to leave the room. GREG stops her.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Uh, I never got my answer.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I got mine. You don't even like Tupac, Greg.</p>
<p>(Camera holds on GREG.)</p>

[INT. CSI - AUDIO/VISUAL LAB]</p>
<p>(Security camera close up of LITA GIBBONS' eye drop label: Tetrahydrozoline Eye Redness re-liever Non-Staining)</p>
<p>(The VCR whirrs. The camera pulls back to show that LIGA GIBBONS is holding the eye drop container.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: She killed him with eyedrops?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, it's not that far-fetched. Tetrahydrozoline is the active ingredient in eye drops. It's a vasoconstrictor. Obviously, it's great for bloodshot eyes.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV close up of a right eye with redness. Eye drop liquid is dropped into the eye and the redness disappears. Flash to white. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I can buy that: You ingest eyedrops it constricts the blood vessels throughout your body maybe even spike your blood pressure perhaps even cause a stroke.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It's a perfect poison. It's odorless, colorless, tasteless. Doyle would have never known it was in his drink.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Only one thing.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What's that?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Lita Gibbons was the last one to sit down at the table and she never left her chair. So ... how'd the eye drops get into his drink?</p>

[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- DAY]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE enters the room. She's carrying a file.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Hey, Catherine. Nice timing. I just finished my prelim on your John Doe.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks to the other side of the examining table. She opens the file and reads the information.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No longer a John Doe. Got a name and a rap sheet. Jace Felder, busted for selling meth in '98. His prints are in AFIS. (She closes the file.) Your turn.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Cause of death: Perforating gunshot wound through and through. Wound penetrated the zygomatic arch exited the right temple. </p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV of a bullet piercing through the deceased's left cheek and blood spattering out from the unseen right side. End of CGI POV. White flash to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Check out his right eardrum.</p>
<p>(ROBBINS hands the otoscope to CATHERINE. CATHERINE leans in and examines the deceased's ear.)</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV from the outer ear camera moves in through the ear and through the bone. End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: His eardrum's gone.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Presence of blood indicates the tympanic membrane was blown out shortly before death.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE hands the otoscope back to ROBBINS.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We found him on an airstrip. Maybe he was too close to a jet engine.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Jet engine? Well, that would explain his clothing. A gasoline smell. Sent if off to trace. Here's something you don't see every day, though: Perimortem bruising on his torso. Two symmetrical lines.</p>
<p>(ROBBINS indicates the deceased's chest.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Looks like it could be from a harness or a seat belt.</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Actually, we're looking at two.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Two?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, I've got fresh marks at the head of the runway two sets, both parallel, so ... my guess is one car spun out here ...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Man, you are way ahead of me.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, well, I been here a while. Over there another set of treads going straight ahead, so ...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Right. And you only lay down treads when your wheels aren't rolling smoothly. Panic braking? Sudden boost of acceleration? Race?</p>
<p>(NICK nods his head.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I think so, yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Lockwood</strong>: Welcome to pre-game. Every gear-banger in Clark County all with the same question -- &quot;What are you running under there?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Foreplay is foreplay. So, when do they race?</p>
<p><strong>Lockwood</strong>: It's not so much when it's where; racing locations are always in play. Once the call comes in the street will empty out in seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: They go all the way out to Frenchman airfield from here?</p>
<p><strong>Lockwood</strong>: Only when it rains.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It rained last night. Rain brings up the oil from the streets. They got to go somewhere to get some traction.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks at NICK. NICK nods.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: The desert.</p>
<p>(NICK moves forward toward the yellow car parked behind DET. LOCKWOOD.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Centrifugal supercharger. Nice. </p>
<p>(NICK puts his CSI kit down. The owner of the car who was standing on the side with two women, moves toward NICK when he hears NICK'S admiring comment.)</p>
<p><strong>Turbo Owner</strong>: Yeah, it's like the compressor side of a turbo but instead of spinning on the exhaust it goes through a gearset to the crank.</p>
<p>(The young man's voice fades as he notices CATHERINE standing there.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: More power, no extra weight. Every girl's dream.</p>
<p>(The young man laughs. He takes a couple of steps forward and points to his car hood. NICK leans in to look at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Turbo Owner</strong>: Ooh. I like that. Yeah, check the nitrous speed.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Nos. Nitrous oxide system.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Nitrous oxide as in speed?</p>
<p><strong>Turbo Owner</strong>: Well, speed is ultimately limited by how fast you can mix oxygen with fuel and ignite it.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Regular air is about 20% oxygen. Nitrous is 40. Double the burn, double the power.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV white flash to the meter under the hood as the indicator quickly moves from 0 to the red zone. Camera moves in double time through the coils where it ignites and causes the engine to power up. The engine revs. Camera moves out from the car to side close up of the tires moving along the road. Flash to white.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So the sudden boost of acceleration could account for the treads back at the airstrip.</p>
<p>(From behind them, another yellow car drives slowly up past them. NICK sees something.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Check out that racing harness. Same as the bruises found on the victim.</p>

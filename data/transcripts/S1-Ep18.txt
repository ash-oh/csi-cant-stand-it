<hr />
[EXT. ANDRE'S RESTAURANT - SIXTH STREET - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The restaurant door opens and a guest walks in. He politely greets KEVIN and AMY SHEPHERD who are just walking out the restaurant.) </p>
<p><strong>Dining Guest</strong>: Good evening.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Shepherd</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p>(Arms around each other, they walk down the sidewalk.)</p>
<p><strong>Amy Shepherd</strong>: That was nice. I had such a beautiful time tonight. Eight years.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Shepherd</strong>: People said we wouldn't last. (she laughs) Happy anniversary, baby.</p>
<p><strong>Amy Shepherd</strong>: Happy anniversary.</p>
<p>(They kiss and continue walking.)</p>
<p>(As they walk by, the camera focuses on the sidewalk where a lit cigarette rolls discarded.)</p>
<p>(The Shepherds reach their parked car. KEVIN walks AMY to the passenger door, then walks around the car to the driver's side. He pauses and they look at each other. She smiles.)</p>
<p>(Someone masked and dressed in black grabs her from behind. With a knife in his hand, he slices her neck.)</p>
<p>(KEVIN SHEPHERD stands frozen in shock. AMY is on the ground, dead in a pool of blood.)</p>
<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. ANDRE'S RESTAURANT - SIXTH STREET - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(A camera flashes. SARA kneels near AMY SHEPHERD and takes pictures of the victim.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Two victims. She's on the sidewalk, a foot from the curb and he's in the middle of the street.</p>
<p>(WARRICK turns to look at SARA who stands up. She looks at WARRICK and indicates the body on the sidewalk.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What's missing here?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No car.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No mercy. </p>
<p>(NICK is kneeling down next to the second body out on the road: KEVIN SHEPHERD.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: This guy's stabbed at least five times. Got some reddish hair. Vic's hair is brown.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and BRASS walk up to the scene.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What do we got?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: They had dinner at Andre's. Coroner's assistant has his wallet with the credit card receipt.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM puts down his kit and kneels to look at KEVIN SHEPHERD'S body.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: They didn't bother to valet.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Saved five bucks, cost them their lives. Carjacking gone bad.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Carjackers don't use knives.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Never?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: They used to say, &quot;Never on Sunday.&quot; Then Pearl Harbor happened. I never say, &quot;Never.&quot; </p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns to look back at the body.)</p>
<p>[CAMERA SLOW MOTION]</p>
<p>(A drop of water falls into a pool of blood. Another drop of water falls on someone's jacket.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks up at the sky. A rain drop falls on his forehead.)</p>
<p>[RESUME CAMERA MOTION]</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, man ... </p>
<p>(It starts pouring.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM stands and starts yelling out instructions.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We got three minutes to process this crime scene! </p>
<p>(Everyone moves to process the scene. SARA takes pictures as fast as she can.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: After that, we lose it all to the gutters! Sara, take overalls! Warrick, put a cone down on everything you bag! Nick, we got to get these bodies into the van!</p>
<p>(Everyone rushes around to preserve and collect whatever they can. It is complete chaos as people run into each other trying to process the crime scene.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Now! Let's go guys! Go! SARA: Pick the jacket up!</p>
<p>(SARA finishes taking pictures of AMY SHEPHERD and moves to take pictures of KEVIN SHEPHERD. The Coroners, Officers and other personnel move quickly.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Let's go! BRASS: Bring me a body bag. I want to cover this woman! NICK: Get a bag, hurry up!</p>
<p>(The Coroners move to get the body bags. WARRICK rushes to open bags to gather evidence on the sidewalk.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Can we get another gurney? GRISSOM: I need another gurney.</p>
<p>(The Coroners move quickly to prep the gurney to get the body out of the rain.)</p>
<p><strong>Coroners</strong>: Load this up! </p>
<p>(WARRICK grabs the bags of evidence and runs toward the cars.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Let's go, let's go! Okay, I've got it.</p>
<p>(The gurney is pushed next to one of the bodies and NICK instructs the Coroners.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: All right, let's get him out.</p>
<p>(SARA takes more pictures.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Come on, come on! Hurry up! NICK: Let's go, hurry up! Get the plastic on!</p>
<p>(SARA finishes with the pictures and stands next to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We're losing everything!</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns and looks up at the sky.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah ... our killer got lucky tonight.</p>
<p>(The camera pulls backward up to the sky as GRISSOM looks down at the ground, then all around him. Everyone continues to work to save what they can.)</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<hr />
[EXT. SIXTH STREET - CRIME SCENE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Camera opens on a cigarette butt in the middle of the sidewalk. It's stopped raining for the moment. WARRICK kneels down next to it shining his flashlight down at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, rain screwed up all our chances of a good DNA profile.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Don't even bother bagging it.</p>
<p>(NICK walks away continuing to look for whatever evidence the rain may have left behind.)</p>
<p>(Thunder rumbles.)</p>
<p>(Out on the street, GRISSOM slams the Coroner's back door shut as it leaves. He and SARA walk around the side to meet up with BRASS.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Do we have any eyeballs at all?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: It's a quiet street, weeknight. Neighbors heard the commotion. Kid over here, he had the only view.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and SARA both turn around to look at the young man sitting on the curb. They head off in that direction.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What's your name, son?</p>
<p>(JUSTIN GREEN stands up.)</p>
<p><strong>Justin Green</strong>: Justin Green.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, Justin, my name's Gil Grissom. This is Sara Sidle. We're with the Crime Lab. Is, uh, is that your blood?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM shines the light on JUSTIN'S bloodied jacket.)</p>
<p><strong>Justin Green</strong>: No, I-it's his, the one you took away. I tried to help him. I thought I was doing everything right. I think I might have killed him.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Whoa. Slow down.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What did you do exactly?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Earlier that night. JUSTIN is walking on the street when a speeding SUV almost hits him.)</p>
<p><strong>Justin Green</strong>: (V.O.) I was crossing the street. This SUV came out of nowhere -- almost clipped me. I turned and there was this body lying in the street.</p>
<p>(From where he stands, he turns and sees something.)</p>
<p><strong>Justin Green</strong>: Oh, my god. </p>
<p>(He immediately starts shouting for help.)</p>
<p><strong>Justin Green</strong>: Help! Help! Somebody call 9-1-1!</p>
<p>(He runs over toward the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Justin Green</strong>: (V.O.) I freaked. </p>
<p>(He kneels down next to the body and starts to perform CPR.0)</p>
<p><strong>Justin Green</strong>: (V.O.) I did everything wrong. I didn't tilt his head back. I- I- ...</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Justin Green</strong>: I didn't clear his airway.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: If it makes you feel any better, that's not what killed him.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Justin ... we're going to need to take your clothes.</p>
<p><strong>Justin Green</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Because there's blood all over them.</p>
<p>(JUSTIN looks down at his clothes.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<hr />
[EXT. COLLAPSED APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Firefighters and other Rescue Personnel walk into the collapsed building to look for survivors. Camera moves out from inside the building out into the sidewalk and street where the rescue vehicles are and where other personnel are busy working.)</p>
<p>(Injured people on gurneys being helped. There are fire and rescue crews, ambulance and other officers all parked along the street.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE parks her Tahoe and gets out. She takes her kit and closes the car door, then makes her way toward the collapsed building.)</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. O'Riley</strong>: Catherine?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE turns to see SGT. O'RILEY walking toward her.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. O'Riley</strong>: I like the hair.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>(They make their way toward the collapsed building.)</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. O'Riley</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I was assigned. This is my case.</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. O'Riley</strong>: Case? The building collapsed. There's nothing criminal here.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Right. That's why you were assigned -- a homicide detective. What happened?</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. O'Riley</strong>: Well, part of the basement caved in. Brought the rest down with it.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Body count?</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. O'Riley</strong>: Three old women. Sisters. One minute you're watching wheel of fortune -- next thing, game over.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And you're not calling this a crime scene?</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. O'Riley</strong>: Catherine, it's a building.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: O'Riley ... it's a suspect.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>

[INT. CSI - DNA LAB - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GREG is in the lab looking through the scope. NICK walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, Greg.</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: (holds up a hand) Shh. I might be looking at the mother of my children here.</p>
<p>(NICK puts on a pair of latex gloves.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Somebody's been putting in way too much overtime.</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: No, man, this is serious. I had a date last night and this girl has the most impossible green eyes. Just ... bamm. Shoulder-length blonde hair ... intelligent ... and she smells so good.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Cute toes?</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Oh ... ideal.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mmm.</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: And none are longer than the big toe.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mmm.</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Both feet. But, you know, what I need to know is what's on the inside?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Oh, what's in her heart?</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: No ... her DNA ... and let me tell you -- this girl has got some fine epithelials.</p>
<p>(GREG turns back to look through the scope. NICK watches GREG and smiles. They both laugh.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Dude, you're sick. Man, you've officially lost it.</p>
<p>(NICK works on prepping his evidence.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: No, no. There is this guy in Louisville. He charges 300 clams to test your spouse's underwear for foreign DNA. Now, that guy is sick. I'm just a romantic.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: But whatever happened to getting to know someone over coffee ... letting the relationship evolve? Romantic is sending flowers not bogarting her skin cells. </p>
<p>(NICK takes the hair sample and puts it on the slide. GREG looks from his scope and notices NICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Ahh, that's boring. What are you doing? What have you got?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Um, pulled some hair off a male stabbing vic.</p>
<p>(GREG takes over. He puts the slide under the scope.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Okay. Baby. Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Nine lives.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Cat hair?</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: (nods) Meow.</p>
<p>(NICK sighs, disappointed.)</p>

[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(DR. ROBBINS goes over the findings with GRISSOM. They stand between the two bodies.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Kevin Shepherd. Six stab wounds to the upper torso -- one to the back, five to the front.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And his wife?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns to look at AMY SHEPHERD.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Amy Shepherd. One slice across the neck, right to left.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Work of a lefty?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Well, the blade transected the jugular vein and both carotids.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hard to scream when your throat's been cut. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns back to KEVIN SHEPHERD.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Defensive wounds.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: This guy put up one hell of a fight. Attacked with two weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (surprised) Two?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Two types of stab wounds. First a long, sharp double-edged blade. The blade went in smooth ...</p>
<p>(He makes a stabbing downward motion with his hands.)</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV to: The camera pushes down toward wound #5 and pierces through the flesh. It reverses back up and out. End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: ... left a little collateral bruising to the skin. Weapon number two was blunt. </p>
<p>(With both hands, DR. ROBBINS makes a stabbing downward motion.)</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV to: The camera pushes down toward wound #3 and pierces through the flesh. It reverse back up and out. End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Weapon number two caused extensive bruising around the points of entry.</p>
<p>(He points out the damage to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Two weapons ... two attackers.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. COLLAPSED BUILDING - WRECKED ROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks into the damaged room. She walks up to a FIREMAN.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hi. District Engineer?</p>
<p><strong>Fireman</strong>: Over there.</p>
<p>(He points to a man with a large piece of drywall in his hand kneeling near the window.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Ah. Follow the tie. </p>
<p>(She walks up to him and stands behind him. She shines the light of her flashlight on the torn wall while she looks over his shoulder.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Is that from the rain?</p>
<p><strong>Paul Newsome</strong>: (turns around) Depends on who's asking.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Are you hiding something, or am I not worth your time?</p>
<p><strong>Paul Newsome</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, you are the District Engineer of the city, right? You're responsible for the structural safety of this building.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Newsome</strong>: (stands up) I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Catherine Willows, Las Vegas Crime Lab.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Newsome</strong>: Crime Lab?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah. The building fell down. Three people were crushed to death. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE steps up to the wall.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Why is the wood wet?</p>
<p><strong>Paul Newsome</strong>: It's a flat-roofed structure. Leaks aren't uncommon. Maybe that explains the dry rot.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Then what am I looking at?</p>
<p><strong>Paul Newsome</strong>: That would be sheetrock.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Drywall. But what about this layer right here?</p>
<p>(Camera zooms in for a close up of the wall.)</p>
<p><strong>Paul Newsome</strong>: When they installed the original drywall they used half-inch and then, when they came back and repaired it, they used quarter of an inch.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (turns around) What, was quarter inch on sale that day?</p>
<p><strong>Paul Newsome</strong>: Look, Lady, I don't know what it is ...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Catherine.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Newsome</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Don't say, &quot;sorry&quot; just know who you're talking to.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Newsome</strong>: When they applied the second layer and then they spackled it and they painted it the difference wasn't noticeable.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It's noticeable now. Which District Engineer conducted the last inspection?</p>
<p><strong>Paul Newsome</strong>: There's only one District Engineer.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Then it looks bad for you.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Newsome</strong>: (he laughs) Okay. Look, uh, Catherine, ...</p>
<p>(He puts his hand on her shoulder and leads her away from the wall.)</p>
<p><strong>Paul Newsome</strong>: ... why don't I write a report and then I'll e-mail it to you. How would that be?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks up at the ceiling and around the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Where's the point of origin of the collapse? </p>
<p>(PAUL NEWSOME doesn't say anything.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Look, this is my crime scene. I can find it myself but that might mean lots of question to lots of people.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Newsome</strong>: (nods) Well, it's just my, uh, expert opinion but I'd say right below us -- in the basement ... the laundry room.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Then that's where I want to be.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE turns to head there.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>

[INT. CSI - HALLWAY - EARLY MORNING]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks in to the hallway. SARA rounds the corner and finds him.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey, Gris. Kevin Shepherd, chiropractor. Amy Shepherd, Dentist. House in the lakes. Married eight years. Perfect credit. You know, I'm lost. There's nothing jumping off the page, here.</p>
<p>(SARA hands the file to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What about the eyewitness?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Justin Green. First witness, first suspect but he hung around, waiting for us.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Covered in blood.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: But his story jibes. Several eyewitness saw him performing CPR on Kevin Shepherd. But if-if-if it is a carjacking, I don't get it. Why fight to the death? It's four wheels and a chassis.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: In the heat of the moment, it's not a car, it's a possession and people will fight without realizing what they're risking.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So, you are thinking the Shepherds lost their lives for their SUV?</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hey, Warrick. Is Grissom around?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You see him?</p>
<p>(He chuckles and steps forward.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know between you and me, as long as I've been on the job I still don't like touching dead bodies.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, that's why you got the badge and I got the syringe. </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (softly) wow.</p>
<p>(WARRICK sticks the syringe into the first wound, #3, and injects the mixture in to make a cast.)</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV of inside the wound and the mixture filling it up. End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(WARRICK moves on to wound #1 and fills that wound up with the mixture. He glances over at BRASS who is unusually silent and watching.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (explains) I'm casting the stab wounds. From the molds, we can identify the murder weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You're getting more like Grissom every day, man.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: When you carjack a car, you keep the car. You don't dump it.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Unless you're joyriding.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, who kills for a joyride?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Wouldn't be the first time.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Has anybody else touched this vehicle?</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: No, sir. And I'm the one who found it.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Just the rain. The evidence on the outside of the vehicle will be compromised.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, maybe there'll be some evidence on the inside.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM opens the door and the body of a dead woman tumbles out. GRISSOM grabs the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (surprised) Whoa. Whoa.</p>
<p>(Breathing hard, he puts the body back into the car.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, I haven't felt that in a while.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Good question. Better question, who is she?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p>(BRASS reaches out to check the woman's bag. GRISSOM stops him.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Uh. Put some gloves on.</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, I know. You know, I ... I can't believe you messed up the crime scene.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The body fell out when I opened the door. It happens. We move on.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Mmm. Going to bother you all day.</p>
<p>(BRASS opens the woman's bag and checks her wallet. He takes out her NEVADA DRIVER'S LICENSE.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (reading) Jessica Hall. Date of birth -- 8-5-73.</p>
<p>(He takes out her cell phone.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Cell phone, power's off. Didn't call 9-1-1. They would've instructed her to leave it on.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Seat belt's unbuckled. That's why she fell out.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, so?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, she's in the driver's seat. Was she driving? Or could she have been placed in here?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Maybe she's like 28% of Americans -- she doesn't buckle up.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I think it's 29%, actually.</p>
<p>(BRASS looks at GRISSOM and doesn't comment.)</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Cat hair. Found similar hair on Kevin Shepherd's clothing.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How about Amy Shepherd?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Nope. No hairs on the wife.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Shepherd's SUV. Stab wound. Cat hair. She's linked to the first crime scene. But how?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Victim number three. Wrong place, wrong time. Saw something she shouldn't.</p>

<p><strong>Paul Newsome</strong>: So what?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, so the victims' family deserves answers.</p>
<p>(He doesn't say anything.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Somebody's responsible.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Newsome</strong>: Hey, I didn't do anything wrong.</p>

<p><strong>Sgt. O'Riley</strong>: Because we care.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. O'Riley</strong>: The mayor ran on a platform of urban renewal. Clean out the slumlords, create habitable, low-cost housing maintained by the city. If you find so much as a scratch on an aspirin in there you know who it's going to come back to.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: When we brought the body into the lab she set off the metal detector.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did you check in her pockets?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: : Nothing in the pockets.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What about a pin or a plate -- something metallic on the inside?</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Are you getting this?</p>
<p><strong>Paul Newsome</strong>: What is that? A roach?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm not an entomologist, but I know one. He can tell us.</p>
<p>(The building creaks and something flies overhead causing the building to tremble. Concrete dust and bits of rock fall on CATHERINE. She covers her head.)</p>

<p>(CATHERINE looks up and finds the beam.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Newsome</strong>: All right, connected to the beam running vertically to the concrete foundation are the support columns. Now, in a perfect world, they should be steel but given the age of the building, they might be wood.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah ... but I cleaned it for you.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We need to know the make of that knife.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Rich</strong>: Well, it's not a knife. The tip's double-edged. Bevels on both sides, downward slope. This came from a dagger which means it's either carbon steel or stainless steel. I get asked this question more than you think.</p>
<p>(He pulls out a lemon juice squirt container and puts a few drops on the tip of the knife.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Acid in the lemon juice should react to carbon steel, but not stainless steel.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Rich</strong>: How's a cop know all this?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (smiles) He's the cop. I'm the scientist.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I got a cop question. What are we looking for here?</p>
<p><strong>Alan Rich</strong>: Dark spots.</p>
<p>(The tip has dark spots on it.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Carbon steel. What's next?</p>
<p><strong>Alan Rich</strong>: Length.</p>
<p>(ALAN turns and looks for something behind the counter. He comes back with a piece of paper and a ruler.)</p>
<p><strong>Alan Rich</strong>: Daggers are rarely more than an inch at the base. We got the tip. So, we can fill in the rest. It's basic geometry.</p>
<p>(Placing the tip on the piece of paper, he extends the tip of the dagger to estimate how long the weapon used was.)</p>
<p><strong>Alan Rich</strong>: It's five inches. Top row-- five-inch daggers, carbon steel. </p>
<p>(He reaches into the display case and takes out a dagger to show them.)</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This is a nice job, Warrick. You know, casting is an art.</p>
<p>(SARA walks into the room holding the dagger.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: And while the artist was at work, Brass and I identified Jessica Hall's murder weapon from the tip we found lodged in her ribs. It's a dagger. Fugasi model 502.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p>(She hands the dagger to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So we've identified the weapon used on Jessica Hall. Was it also used on Kevin Shepherd?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM hands the dagger to WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, I measured all the sharp points of entry on Kevin's body.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: They're all identical. They're all made from the same murder weapon.</p>
<p>(WARRICK draws the outline of the dagger onto a piece of paper.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So, if this dagger matches your mold ...</p>
<p>(He reaches for one of the molds to compare it.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Okay. We just put the sharp wounds to bed.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Identified murder weapon number one. Now we just need that second murder weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Points of impact on these two are blunt, right?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, who stabs someone with a blunt instrument?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sara, you still have the dagger tip from the body?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(SARA reaches to get the dagger tip out.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And you have the cast of the unidentified murder weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(WARRICK reaches for the cast of the unidentified murder weapon.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: A dagger's not a diamond. It doesn't last forever.</p>
<p>(WARRICK then matches the unidentified weapon to the tip. They match.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We don't have two weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So he started with Kevin and then he went after Jessica and then the tip broke off.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: He likes you, too. Now, tell me about him.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Your building collapsed.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You assigned me the case. You already know that.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, this little guy confirms it. This species of beetle eats softwood. Tell me about the building.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The frame's made of Douglas Fir.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: A delicacy.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I did find more than a bug. Dry rot, questionable repairs, a jittery Engineer. And check this out.</p>
<p>(She turns the monitor to the side to show GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Forget the beetle; this damage was intentional. You're looking for a homosapien.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Catherine, there's a reason I assigned you this case. You're good with people, both the dead and the living.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Translation: We're opening a political can of worms. The mayor's involved, an election's around the corner and you could've clued me in a little earlier.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Sweaty palms make the best prints.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks into the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The coroner just sent over a ten card of Jessica hall's fingerprints. Evidently, I'm the new delivery boy.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Thanks. </p>
<p>(From the printer, SARA picks up the photos that WARRICK just took of the prints off of the gearshift. She visually compares the two.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No need for AFIS. We got a visual match. All three prints belong to victim number three.</p>

<p>(NICK takes out a shoe from the evidence bag and puts it on a piece of paper that he hands across the table to GRISSOM and SARA to look at.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Blood flow on the left instep of Kevin Shepherd's shoe.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Lucky for us the rain missed that.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: When death is not immediate a victim will instinctively curl up into a fetal position. Which may have protected this from the rain.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Preserving the blood pattern.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You expect blood on a victim but let's ask the question: Could the normal action and behavior of our victim have put his blood there?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The victim was lying on the ground, wounds above the waist. It's not Kevin's blood.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Who else had a flowing wound?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Amy Shepherd was too far away but Jessica Hall was alive and bleeding.</p>

<p>(NICK kneels down.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I say hinder.</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: By the positioning of her wound, I'd say it looked like her stabbing was an accident.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Stabbing's are messy and inexact. So victim number three becomes suspect number two.</p>

<p>(She looks at him.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Newsome</strong>: Five years ago, the building was apartment Vietnam. The facility was substandard. The city turned its back on it. The tenants revolted. Blake Neferson, apartment 204 took a sledgehammer to that column. It's public record -- he was arrested.</p>
<p>(He hands the file to CATHERINE.)</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I heard the lab matched the blood on Kevin Shepherd's shoe to Jessica. My theory's getting better and better.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes note of the various post-its hanging on her vanity mirror.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Not so fast, Nicholas. P.D. traced a call Shepherd made to Jessica from Andre's restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What's he doing calling the woman who helped kill him?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's your theory, pal. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks into the apartment. He walks into the kitchen and turns on the light where he finds more post-it note reminders.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks into the office area and turns on the lamp. He finds more post-<br />
it reminders around her monitor.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Our little Jessica was a prolific note-taker. &quot;Be a good person today.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, right. Try not to kill too many people.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: &quot;Cancel water cooler delivery.&quot; &quot;Plan girl's night out.&quot; &quot;Light bulbs for porch.&quot;</p>
<p>(GRISSOM finds a letter sized notepad on top of the computer mouse. He puts it into an envelope.)</p>

<p>(NICK walks into the room holding a red tabby cat.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: The redhead we've been looking for.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Red hairs on Jessica. She owns a tabby cat. Red hairs on Shepherd.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Chances are Shepherd was here without his wife.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah. I'm going to run Jessica's cell phone records and Shepherd's. If anything was between those two we'll find out.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Try it.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah. </p>
<p>(NICK takes a seat behind the computer and powers it on.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Achex. Personal on-line banking. Deposits, checking, money transfers everything under the sun. </p>
<p>(NICK puts in the password and clicks. He gets a ledger screen.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay, I'm in. Direct deposit from Beaumont's department store$500 a week -- probably her weekly paycheck.</p>
<p>(He looks around and clicks on more screens.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And then a $35,000 day?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What, she win the lottery?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How does a girl who makes $2,000 a month pull in $35,000 ... only to give it away on the same day?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Let's see who she gave it to.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It hasn't posted yet.</p>
<p>(NICK sighs and shakes his head disappointed.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No luck.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Wait. Go back. </p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, we know who she got it from -- Kevin Shepherd.</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Don't cancel your next reservation. It wasn't a carjacking.</p>
<p><strong>Ronnie Litre</strong>: Well, it's a fresh pad. Only a couple of pages missing. Let's see what she wrote on those missing pages.</p>
<p>(Various cuts of RONNIE LITRE prepping the paper. When he's done, he and NICK read what was written on the sheets above it.)</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He paid Jessica $35,000. He called her as he was leaving the restaurant. He wasn't supposed to die.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I think Shepherd planned the murder of his wife.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I'm with you. Why'd he end up dead?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Bad karma. Jessica and this Shepherd guy had been phoning each other day and night for the past two years. What does that tell you?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: They had a very healthy relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: He was cheating on his wife, Amy.</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No. </p>
<p>(SARA starts checking the tags, looking for something specific.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: He just said check his clothes. Drying room. Six years in the job and it still freaks me out in here.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I think it's peaceful.</p>
<p>(He stops and looks at her.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Here we go. Here we go. Justin Green. The eyewitness.</p>
<p>(WARRICK takes out the jacket and holds it up.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: He's a suspect? When did that happen?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Here's another thing the rain ruined -- the blood pattern on Justin's jacket.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Not the t-shirt. </p>
<p>(SARA looks at the blood on the clothes and finds something strange.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Warrick ... what does that look like to you?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: That looks like a handprint.</p>
<p>(SARA puts her hand on her waist in an awkward position, her eyes on the T-shirt. WARRICK holds out his hand over the print.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Right hand. Justin's?</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So, it's not Justin's.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We know where Jessica's hands were. </p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: They fit perfectly over the handprint on Justin's shirt.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Justin's story was that he performed CPR on Kevin Shepherd.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, but Kevin grabbed Justin's shirt so that means he was still breathing.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Which means he didn't need CPR.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We just put the dagger in Justin Green's hand.</p>

<p><strong>Paul Newsome</strong>: I'm growing on you. Aren't I?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE doesn't comment on that remark. She explains the experiment.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The damaged support column buckled. Why?</p>
<p><strong>Paul Newsome</strong>: The weight of the building wasn't evenly distributed out to the load-bearing walls by the joists ...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Good. We're on the same page. Now, I put a section of the floor assembly in the tank. I added a dozen or so of my daughter's rubber balls two sub-woofers ...</p>
<p><strong>Paul Newsome</strong>: You put the whole thing on vibration isolators.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Exactly. Because I suspect that sound vibrations may be the ultimate cause of the collapse.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE turns on the player and Beethoven's Symphony No. 5 in C minor, Op. 67, First Movement, allegro con brio, starts playing over the speakers.)</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, I bet I can tell you that conversation.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: AMY SHEPHERD is standing in a parking lot on her cell phone with JUSTIN GREEN.)</p>
<p><strong>Amy Shepherd</strong>: Do you really expect me to believe that?</p>

<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Amy Shepherd does the unthinkable. She doubles it.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Why kill one when you and collect over 100 grand?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Makes financial sense.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And Justin secures his double cross with an insurance policy. He eliminates the person that hired him. Jessica wasn't stabbed by accident. She was a loose end.</p>

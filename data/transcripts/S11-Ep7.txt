The truck was headed to the landfill.
When it passed through the security gate, the guard noticed a suspicious ooze leaking out of the back, so he notified the driver.
The driver jumped out, checked it out and called us.
What is the code for suspicious ooze?
6-6-6.
Well, at least the primordial variety-- the stuff of creation, Heaven and Hell.
Yeah, I'll take &quot;Hell&quot; for $500, please, Alex.
Is this, your, uh, &quot;ooze&quot;?
Yep.

MAN: Hey! Shut it down!
Shut it down!
STOKES: Looks like blood.

Okay. Open it up.

Prototype failed.
It jammed before it made it to market.
The business made us destroy it.
You guys said something about body parts?
STOKES: Yeah. We found some in a truck headed for the landfill.
It was mixed in with a lot of shredded stuff, much like what comes out of your machine.
Truck's manifest led us here.
Got to be some mistake.
Company sends us all kinds of material to shred.
Electronics, appliances, apparel, prototypes, rejects, recalls.

You guys got a warrant?
Hey, got one right here.
You can, uh, shred it when we're done.
Except for the big stuff, most clients send their material in padlocked bins.
They fill them up at their offices, arrange secure transport, we take care of the rest.
That's it; that's the whole graveyard shift.
Like I said, no one fell in.
Well, maybe they didn't have to.
Padlocked bins, secure transport... if I was going to get rid of a body, seems like a good way to go.

Since when do you worry about identity theft?
Every aspect of our life has been reduced to binary code, Nick.
All we are is zeroes and ones.
Easy pickins.
My name is Larry LaMotte, and I want to ask you a question.
How much would you pay for peace of mind?
Well, the next few minutes may answer that question and... it may change your life.
So, we checked Larry LaMotte's house.
No one home, and all his calls went to voicemail.
That's not a good sign.
Good morning, gentlemen.
How can I help you?
I'm Detective James Brass, Las Vegas Police.
This is Dr. Ray Langston from the crime lab.
We're looking for Larry LaMotte.
Oh, I'm sorry.
He's not available.
May I ask what this is concerning?
And you are?
Oh. Elaine Travers.
I'm his executive assistant.
Gentlemen, I'm Julius Kaplan.
I'm Mr. LaMotte's Head of Security.
Is there a problem?
No, no problem, Julius.
We think your boss may be dead, so we need to ask a few questions.
There must be some misunderstanding.
Mr. LaMotte is on vacation.
Where?
At an undisclosed location, where, unfortunately, he can't be reached.
I'll say.
It's okay, Julius.
I can handle this.
Who are you?
I'm Larry LaMotte.
My name is Larry LaMotte, and I want to ask you a question.
How much would you pay for...?
You're Larry LaMotte?
Yes.
Now, did I hear you gentlemen correctly?
I'm dead?
You look younger on TV.
Better-looking, too, right?
Marketing 101.

You got something to sell, hey, get someone pretty to sell it, right?
And who is the man in front of the camera?
Wesley.
Works in the mailroom.
Yeah, he can't string two sentences together, but put a script in front of him, suddenly, he's Brando.
So, gentlemen, what about this dead thing?
Well, as I was, uh, telling Mr. Kaplan, we found a body shot in the head.
Someone had force-fed him credit cards.
The credit cards were in your name.
My name?!
Uh, I-I don't understand.
Have your credit cards been lost or stolen?
Did you know that every 79 seconds, someone has their identity stolen?
It can take years, thousands of dollars to get your good name back.
LANGSTON: Mr. LaMotte, if someone has stolen your identity, and that person has ended up dead, that raises some serious questions for us.
Like what?
BRASS: Well, if someone stole your identity, it can't be good for business.
I'm the victim here, Detective.
Our company has thousands of subscribers.
Corporate clients who depend on us to protect their data, their intellectual property.
This company made $120 million last year.
KAPLAN: In other words, why would we risk all that in order to go after some penny-ante credit card thief?
Well, that raises the possibility that whoever murdered our victim thinks they killed the real Larry LaMotte.
Do you have any enemies, Larry?
Thousands.
Like you, I make it my mission to stop criminals.
You wear a badge, I wear the trust of every client who pays $19 a month to make sure that I'm watching.
It'd be a lot easier if you just got us a list.
Elaine!
The officers would like to take a look at our offenders files.
And please get two subscription packages ready.
Don't worry.
Our brothers in law enforcement get a discount.
STOKES: Larry LaMotte had a lot of enemies, but they're all his clients.
Yeah, I see a couple of thousand have filed consumer complaints.
Yeah, subscribers claimed that instead of protecting their identities, the company stole them.
Credit card numbers found their way to Nigeria.
And we know what happens in Nigeria doesn't stay in Nigeria.
I.D.-Preserve passed it off as &quot;an unfortunate security breach.&quot;
But one guy didn't buy that excuse.
Lee Devries, 34.
Machinist.
He drove a truck right through the window of I.D.-Preserve.
Starts waving a gun around, demanding face-time with Larry LaMotte.
Six months in County.
He got out four weeks ago.
His first job out of the joint-- working at a temp agency that supplies workers to the shredder company.
Sounds like somebody worth talking to.
I'll call Brass.
Nicky?
Yeah.
Were you planning on telling me that, uh, you stopped seeing the departmental shrink?
Oh, I didn't think it was a big deal.
I went my mandatory two times.
I thought that we talked about this.
We did. I went.
That's it? You're done?
Look, I've been getting in the gym, I've been eating right, getting good sleep.
Healthy body, healthy mind, right?

Catherine...
I can't sit in a room and talk about how I feel from one minute to the next.
It's just not my thing.
Sure about that?
Positive.
BRASS: So, Lee, where you been the last 72 hours?
Huh?
Run into Larry LaMotte by any chance?
I'm gonna make this simple.
Have you put any bodies into any shredders lately?
All right, stand up.
Stand up! Stand up!
Back up.
Back up.
Sit over there.
All right, look...
I'm going to be you.
A more cooperative you.
All right, Detective, all right.
I'll tell you what happened.
Now you know that I ran into Larry LaMotte.
You know my history with him.
I got jammed up, and I got arrested.
But as luck would have it, I got a second chance at him.
I gathered up that b*st*rd, right?
I jammed credit cards down his throat.
I took out my gun, I popped a cap right in his brain, and I took that mess that used to be Larry LaMotte, and you know what?
I didn't know what to do with it, so, I put it in-in the shredder at my work.
That was the end of Larry LaMotte. Done.
Questions?
I don't know what you're talking about.
That's not a question.
The guy destroyed my life.
I signed up with I.D.-Preserve 'cause I was scared somebody was going to steal my identity.
And the next thing I know, I got loans taken out in my name, I got mortgages, I got debts I can't even begin to pay.
Hell, they even repossessed my truck right there in that scumbag's window.
You got an alibi?
Six of 'em.
Thanks to Larry LaMotte, there's a half dozen guys running around out there saying they're me.
You running the credit card we found in the D.B.'s stomach?
Yeah.
On the computer in the bullpen.
Those are my numbers on my computer.
I'm checking my purchases.
Ever since that whole I.D.-Preserve thing went shady, I got a little paranoid.
There are plenty of legit companies doing this, but...
I can't believe that I trusted those guys. Yeah.
It's like that friend that you meet in science camp, and you find that you have all the same interests, and you like to go to all the same movies, and do all the same things, and then one day, he offers to give you a haircut.
And you need one, so you figure, why not?
And then he starts showing you this sketchbook, and swears that he's done nude drawings of all his friends.
Hodges...
It's not the same.
Oh, of course not, no.
I'm... I'm sorry, G.
I'm just feelin' ya.
So, is this, uh, bullet fragment telling you a story?
Once upon a time, a cranium met a nine-by-19 millimeter Parabellum round.
The end.
I found this other fragment in the mix.
SANDERS: It's tarnished, encased in fibrous tissue.
Looks old.
The fragments from the bullet that went through Shredder Guy's head show polygonal rifling, consistent with a Glock.
Now, this other fragment has conventional rifling.
So, the older fragment is from a different gun.
Right, but could still come from the same victim.
How?
A previous incident.
It shows signs of encapsulation.
Over time, the body's defense mechanism encapsulates the frag in tissue to protect against infection.
So far, we have nothing to identify our shredder guy.
Maybe this shred of evidence will help.
It's at least worth a good cleaning.
So we sorted through the shredded items in the load with our dead body, and discovered something.
Most of it can be traced back to one place.
Let me guess: I.D.-Preserve.
So, I'm thinking, maybe the body is in one of these bins that I.D.-Preserve uses to send stuff to the shredder.
And maybe our friend Larry LaMotte's hands aren't so clean.
Well, I bet that he would say that when these bins left his office, there was no body inside.
Which is why I did some checking.
I.D.-Preserve uses a subcontractor to handle transport of its bins.
Guess who runs that company?
Larry LaMotte's head of security.
Julius Kaplan.
Mm-hmm.
Let's light 'em up.

As a matter of fact, not at the beginning, either, actually.

BRASS: So, we ran some prints.
Your head of security, Julius Kaplan-- whose real name, by the way, is Julius Kirsch, also known as Julius Child.
And he got that nickname because he used to be a Mob collector who would make dinner for his victims.

Ground-up casino chips, a chopped-up credit card.
Needless to say, I'm shocked.
We were also able to put a face to our mystery man from the shredder.
Never seen him before.
He was dumped into a shredder from one of your shred bins.
Well, I wouldn't know anything about that.
As you know, Julius dealt with the shredding company.
That's convenient. Gentlemen, I lost the same friend today twice.
Obviously, Julius wasn't the man that I thought he was.
Now, whatever wrongs he did-- that's on him.
I take this as a learning experience.
You know, it's like I say in my seminars.
Assuming someone's name is easy.
Assuming control of your life-- that's hard.

Good news is, even though the camera's angled away so we can't see the driver, we do have an image of a car leaving the scene around the time of Julius' murder.

All right, let me get this straight.
A partial bullet fragment from a previous injury lodged inside Shredder Guy is a perfect match to a round found in a John Doe six years ago?
Shredder Guy and John Doe are the same person--
were the same person.
Six years ago, Shredder Guy is shot in the alley, robbed and left for dead.
Yet, he survives, skips town and disappears.
Flash forward six years.
Shredder Guy returns here to Vegas with Larry LaMotte's stolen identity.
But bad news for him, he runs into Julius Kaplan...

...who cooks him a special meal.

And then kills him with a Glock.
Then someone kills Julius Kaplan, using the same Colt pistol that shot Shredder Guy six years ago in the alley.
Two crimes, same shooter?
Could be.
It doesn't make sense, Catherine.
Shredder Guy had a credit card in Larry LaMotte's name sent to him in New Mexico, where he was living.
So, why would an identity thief come all the way to Vegas to commit fraud in Larry LaMotte's backyard?
Right.
Maybe he just wanted a free trip to Vegas on Larry's dime.
Maybe he wanted Larry LaMotte to know he was in town.
Either way, something else is going on.
I mean, Julius Kaplan said it himself.
&quot;Why kill a penny-ante thief?&quot;
He's not worth the risk.
Well, he might be, if the thief is threatening to bring down the entire I.D.-Preserve empire.
Facial recognition got a hit on Shredder Guy.
DMV in Florida had a ten-year-old driver's license on file.
Check out the name.
Shredder Guy is Larry LaMotte?

You have a very impressive CV.
Burglary, fraud, and identity theft.
BRASS: Goodbye, Larry LaMotte.
Hello, Arlo Karden.
Arlo Karden doesn't have the same ring to it, I'll give you that.
We searched your house.
Guess what we found.
A Colt pistol.
The print on that cartridge casing puts you in an alley six years ago with, given his penchant for credit card fraud, I'm guessing your old partner in crime.
The real Larry LaMotte.


You thought you'd killed him.
You thought it was safe to use his name. Good name.
Not in the system, like yours.
We, uh... searched your phone records.
You received calls from a prepaid cell, in Gallup, New Mexico.
BRASS: I-I can just imagine, you know, the real Larry, you know, watching TV, and seeing some geezer making money off his name.
So he gets on the Internet, does a little search of the profiles of big-time CEOs, and then up pops a picture: You.
LANGSTON: Larry called you up, offered you &quot;peace of mind&quot; for a price.
But you don't pay retail, so you get Julius Kaplan to get you a discount.
Which only leaves one loose end.
Here you go.

I didn't kill anyone.
Larry said he wanted five million dollars.
Yeah, yeah, we were partners back in the day.
Hell, I figured after all that time, I mean, I... I owed him.
So I gave him the money.
KARDEN: I instructed Julius to deliver the cash.
After that, well...
I think we all know what happened.
Yeah, everybody always blames the dead guy.
I'm not the same guy in that alley.
Not anymore.
A man can change.
As far as that gun goes, that doesn't prove anything.
I got workers.
I got people coming in and out of that house all day long.
And as far as six years ago goes, my attorney informs me that, in the state of Nevada, the statute of limitations on assault, even with a gun, is two years.

Yeah, I shot Larry LaMotte.
I stole his name.
I left him for dead.
But I only killed him once.
STOKES: I checked with the bank.
Arlo may be telling the truth, at least about one thing.
He made a withdrawal four days ago, five million in cash.
So, what, you think he's trying to pay off the real Larry?
Oh, it's possible.
Maybe &quot;Julius Child&quot; went off-recipe and whacked the real Larry to keep the five mill for himself.
It would give Arlo motive to kill him.
He wanted his money back.
Well, one problem: We searched Arlo's house, Julius's house, I.D.-Preserve.
Where's the five million?
Oh, hey, Cath...
I got something.
I used Digital Frame Averaging to process the surveillance footage we got from the neighbor across the street from Julius Kaplan's house.
Program got us a partial plate.
Car was rented two days ago by one Mr. Lee Devries.
That's the guy that drove his truck through the window of I.D.-Preserve.
Guess he got a little payback.
WILLOWS: Brass sent units to Lee Devries' place.
He wasn't there.
He didn't show up for work, either.
The neighbor said that he was visiting his girlfriend in Henderson.

Well, if he's got a briefcase with five million dollars in it, he's heading to Mexico.
Langston.
Yeah, Jim.
A patrol just spotted Devries's rental car.
Heading south?
Got it.


Lee Devries!
Las Vegas Police!
Devries, get out of the car!
BRASS: Step away from the car.

BRASS: Information is currency.
That's what they say.
And you turned it into cold, hard cash.
The all-knowing executive assistant.
Knows every phone call, every meeting, every e-mail, every intimate detail of the boss's life.
You knew the real Larry.
You knew about the blackmail.
You knew about your boss withdrawing five million bucks.
You even knew about &quot;Julius Child&quot; and his skills in the kitchen.
Saw an opportunity for a little quid pro quo.
The thing about the &quot;quo&quot; is, it's a lot sweeter when you don't have to share.

He was a pig.
Just like my boss.
And the &quot;quid pro quo&quot; started a long time ago.
Except then, it was about holding on to my job.
&quot;Honey, can you grab me a cup of coffee?&quot;
&quot;Honey, can you pick up my dry cleaning?&quot;
&quot;Sweetheart, &quot;can you come by my place tonight?
I need a little help with something.&quot;
You used your boss's gun.
We spoke with Lee Devries.
He confirms someone accessed one of his accounts.
You used his identity to rent a getaway car that you planned to dump at the border.
And with five million dollars missing, well... naturally, we'd be looking for Devries and not for you.
And thanks to I.D.-Preserve, you had all his credit card information.
Easy peasy.
Like you said, I know every detail about my boss's life.
His business, too.
He ruined a lot of lives.
People who trusted him, like Devries.
A little justice for all of them has got to be worth something.
Information's currency, right?
STOKES: Elaine Travers pled out, gave up her boss.
With all those defrauded clients, he's looking at identity theft times a thousand.
Larry Arlo, whoever the hell he is, he's not going to be getting much peace of mind over the next 12 years.
His fellow inmates better keep their hands in their pockets.
Mm-hmm.
Hey, you out of here?
Yeah, yeah, I think I'm gonna grab a beer or ten.
You want to join me?
I don't think so.
You sure? We can talk about our feelings.

I'll see you tomorrow.
SANDERS: I don't live in Kyrgyzstan, I've never even been to Kyrgyzstan, so how could I spend $1, 200 on snacks and a yurt?
It's unfortunate.
I mean, not only Greg's identity theft issues, but, uh, our man-date.
It's been postponed.
Your mandate?
No, no, no.
Not a mandate.
It's a man-date.
It was actually Greg's idea.
Um, we... meet at the same time every week, so that I can put Wendy behind me.
You know, so, uh, you look... very nice.
Thanks.
Do you have plans?
Yeah.
Well. Okay.

Hey, did you get a haircut?
Uh, no.
Why? Did, um...
Did Greg happen to mention something, or...?
No.
Oh.
I mean, he might have mentioned something about a science camp.
But you know how people talk.
I could show you mine, but I think that might be inappropriate.
You hardly notice them.
Scars?
Mm.
Of course... some scars heal faster than others.
I got a letter from Nate Haskell the other day.
He wanted to let me know that, uh, he was thinking about me.
The kidney bean?
Yeah.
Don't let him get into your head, Ray.
Well, he's already in there.
Everything that happens to us, the good and the bad, is part of us.
Took me a long time to realize that, uh... it doesn't have to define who we are, We get to decide that.
Good night, Dr. Ray.
Good night, Sarah.

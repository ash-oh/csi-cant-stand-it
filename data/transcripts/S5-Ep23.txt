<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[INT. TRIP WILMONT'S ROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(We see the blurry figures of Trip Wilmont and Paula Levine kissing passionately.) </p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>[INT. TRIP WILMONT'S ROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Clothes are rapidly being removed.) </p>
<p>[EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - PATH TO DORM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Camera follows several college kids walking toward the dorm. Camera rises to show the two figures in Trip Wilmont's window.)</p>
<p>[INT. TRIP WILMONT'S ROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Trip Wilmont and Paula Levine kiss passionately.) </p>
<p>[EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - PATH TO DORM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Camera rises up closer to the two figures in Trip Wilmont's window.)</p>
<p>[INT. TRIP WILMONT'S ROOM - NIGHT]<br />
(Paula Levine removes her slippers. She and Trip Wilmont continue to kiss. More clothes are being removed and dropped on the floor where they stand.) </p>
<p>(Trip opens a sleeping bag on the floor. He and Paula lie on it and continue kissing. In the foreground, lit candles on the dresser burn. Trip removes Paula's bra and they continue to kiss.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - PATH TO DORM - MORNING]</p>
<p>(Police cars are parked in the front. Camera pulls back to the dorm front where Brass shows Grissom, Greg and Sara into the building.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Freshman dorm, coed. Two DB's on the third floor -- Trip Wilmont and Paula Levine. Both 18.</p>
<p>[INT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - HALLWAY - MORNING]</p>
<p>(Brass, Grissom, Sara and Greg continue through the corridor to Trip Wilmont's room.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Hey, Grissom, when you went to college did you live in the dorms?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Surely, you jest.</p>
<p>(Sara laughs.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You know, they say a B.A. is worth a million dollars in extra income over a lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, but the present value of college tuition is about the same amount.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: So you're saying college isn't worth the expense?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I guess it depends on what you learn.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So this is Trip's dorm room. When he missed a big b-ball game this afternoon, his coach called his R.A. His R.A. got the kid next door to jimmy the lock </p>
<p>[INT. TRIP WILMONT'S ROOM - MORNING]</p>
<p>(The officer standing at the door opens the dorm room.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (o.s.) Paramedics pronounced and took off. The coroner's en route.</p>
<p>(Brass stops just outside the dorm room to let Grissom, Sara and Greg inside.)</p>
<p>(On the floor next to the bed are the two bodies. Sara looks around the room. She notes the stereo system, beer bottles and candles.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Music, alcohol, candles. Kid was a regular Romeo.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: &quot;For never was a story of more woe than this of Juliet and her Romeo&quot;</p>
<p>(Greg appears between Grissom and Sara holding the open condom wrapper.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Condom wrapper.</p>
<p>(He looks at them and shows it to them.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So much for safe s*x.</p>
<p>SMASH CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: (V.O.) Sara, do me a favor and open the window, please.</p>
<p>[EXT. COLLEGE DORM - WINDOW -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Through the window, we see David Phillips and Grissom standing in the dorm room.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Sure. </p>
<p>(Sara walks over to the window and opens it.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You feeling okay, David?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Yeah. </p>
<p>[INT. TRIP WILMONT'S ROOM - MORNING]</p>
<p>(David Phillips shines his flashlight on the dead bodies to look at their skin color.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Take a look at the skin coloration on both victims. (David Phillips kneels down for a closer look.) Their bodies are slightly pink.</p>
<p>(Grissom lingers in the doorway.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And you're thinking &quot;pink&quot; skin tones are a common effect of carbon monoxide fumes.</p>
<p>(David Phillips looks back at Grissom and nods. Greg is kneeling near the bodies.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (points) That vomit's also consistent with exposure to C.O.</p>
<p>(Grissom notes the vomit on the rug.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We'll need a sample of that vomit.</p>
<p>(Greg reaches over to get a vomit sample.)</p>
<p>(Grissom's phone rings; he answers it.) </p>
<p>(Greg collects a vomit sample and puts it in a sample container.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to phone) Grissom. Okay, I'll be right there. (He hangs up.) My testimony's up in the Hoyt case. I gotta go. I see no common source for C.O., so you'll have to use the detector. (to Sara) You're running point.</p>
<p>(Sara smiles as Grissom turns to leave.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. COLLEGE DORM - HALLWAY - MORNING]</p>
<p>(The coroners wheel the gurney down the hallway. At the end of the hallway, Brass interviews Susan, the R.A., and Zack Capola.) </p>
<p><strong>Susan</strong>: I knew something was wrong. Trip lived for basketball, and it was the semis, so there's no way he'd miss a game.</p>
<p><strong>Zack Capola</strong>: Yeah, I saw Susan banging on his door, so I used my pocketknife to jam it open.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Had you done that before?</p>
<p><strong>Zack Capola</strong>: Yeah. All the time. Whenever Trip would get drunk and lock himself out, he would bang on my door.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So you and trip were friends?</p>
<p><strong>Zack Capola</strong>: Me and Trip?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (nods) Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Zack Capola</strong>: No. I'm not really the type of guy that Trip Wilmont would hang out with.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: BRASS: So I guess that's a no?</p>
<p><strong>Zack Capola</strong>: Yeah. But we had Spanish 102 together. Sometimes he'd roll over to my dorm, and I'd help him with his homework.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Did you help him, or did you do it for him? Look, it's not the Spanish Inquisition.</p>
<p><strong>Zack Capola</strong>: For a jock, it could have been a lot worse but, no, we weren't friends.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. TRIP WILMONT'S ROOM - MORNING]</p>
<p>(Greg dusts the door handle for prints while Sara is in the back of the room near the window checking the carbon monoxide levels. She kneels down on the floor checking the levels near the floor. Greg takes out the ALS and checks the door handle for body fluids. Sara's hand-held device reads '0'.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No trace of carbon monoxide.</p>
<p>(Greg finds something on the door handle.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: There's a trace of semen on the door handle.</p>
<p>[EXT. TRIP WILMONT'S ROOM - HALLWAY - MORNING -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Greg steps out of the room to the next-door neighbor's and finds body fluids there, too.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: This one, too.</p>
<p>(Sara steps out of the room. Greg removes his goggles and looks at her.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Trophy condoms.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Trophy condoms?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: When a stud scores, he announces his victory by putting his spoils on his neighbor's doorknob.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Oh. Well, my bet is Trip scored a lot.</p>
<p>(Suddenly, there's an explosion and a scream.)</p>
<p>(Sara and Greg look at each other.) </p>
<p>[INT. CAMPUS DORM - BATHROOM - MORNING -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Sara and Greg walk into the bathroom.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Everyone okay?</p>
<p>(There's a commotion in the bathroom. Someone reaches for his bathrobe while a boy and a girl stand in front of the stall. There's water all on the floor and bits of porcelain on the floor. We hear gushing water coming form the stall.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p>(The kids move aside. Greg steps into the stall and turns the water off. Sara can't help by chuckle.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Spontaneous toilet combustion?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (laughs) Or a college prank.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: You think this has anything to do with the case?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Twenty feet away from two dead kids. We got to check it out. Guess you should, uh ... start processing.</p>
<p>(Sara turns and leaves Greg in the stall. Greg rolls his eyes and sighs.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Det. Vartann walks through the hallway. He looks in the break room and doesn't see anyone. He turns and continues his search down the hallway. He looks in the next office and finds it empty as well.) </p>
<p>(Det. Vartann turns and continues down the hallway. He sees Conrad Ecklie reading a file and walking through the hallway toward him.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Conrad.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Hey, detective.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Homicide called you guys over an hour ago. 4-19 at the Tangiers. No one's responded. Not even the coroner.</p>
<p>(Ecklie stops in front of the reception desk to check his messages.) </p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Have you tried Grissom or Catherine?</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Catherine's on a case, I think. Grissom ...</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Oh, that's right. Grissom's in court. </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Oh. And Sofia's still on her task force leave. Both shifts are tapped.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Did you check ... ?</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: I checked the board. No one's available ...</p>
<p>(Ecklie shakes his head absently, his back to Vartann so he doesn't see the light in Vartann's eyes.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: ... except for you.</p>
<p>(Ecklie turns and looks at Vartann. Vartann shrugs.) </p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: I'm the Assistant Lab Director.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: I know. But you're still qualified to process a scene, right?</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Yes, I am. (Vartann nods.) I'll dust off my kit.</p>
<p>(Ecklie tosses his messages back on the reception counter, picks up his book and looks at Vartann.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Meet you there.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Robbins stands between the two tables with the bodies on it. Sara knocks on the door lightly before entering.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey, doc.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Two dead bodies. Both were in perfect health.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I am so hoping that you have more in your report than that.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: There are two toxins which can turn a body pink postmortem. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We already ruled out carbon monoxide.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Which leaves one -- cyanide ingestion. Interesting fact about cyanide -- not everyone can smell it.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Right. It's a genetic quirk.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Unfortunately, I don't have that ability.</p>
<p>(The doors open. Hodges enters as Sara turns around to look at him.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: &quot;The nose&quot; has arrived.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hodges has the genetic quirk?</p>
<p>(Robbins nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: It's a blessing and a curse.</p>
<p>(Hodges walks into the room. Robbins points to the table with the sample contents.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Stomach contents of both decedents. Hodges, start your sniffer.</p>
<p>(Hodges picks up the first container and sniffs it. He puts it down and picks up the second container and sniffs that as well. Robbins and Sara look at each other as they wait for Hodges' verdict.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Hints of stale beer and ... cheese whiz. But I don't smell any cyanide.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Anytime.</p>
<p>(Hodges puts the container down, turns and heads for the door.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, all due respect to &quot;the nose,&quot; I would still like to send a sample of blood to tox.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: It's already done.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Is there anything else?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Nothing on or in the body indicates cause of death. Nothing consistent with homicide whatsoever.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Two college kids die under mysterious circumstances. Let's treat this as a homicide till we know otherwise.</p>
<p>(Robbins nods.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. PARKING GARAGE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(OFF ECKLIE: Ecklie steps out of the vehicle. In front of him past the crime scene tape, Det. Vartann stands with the body and an officer.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: (to the officer) Finally. Yeah, well three hours. All right. Thanks.</p>
<p>(Ecklie ducks under the crime scene tape and heads over to Vartann.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Crime scene's getting cold.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Had to refill my powders.</p>
<p>(Ecklie looks at the body and puts his kit down. Vartann fills him in.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: I found a rental car agreement in the glove box. James Billmeyer. New Jersey. He's not registered at the hotel. Probably stopped by to lose a few bucks.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Did the coroner step in the blood?</p>
<p>(Ecklie snaps a couple of photos of the bloodied prints leading away from the body.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: No. We're still waiting on him. That shoe print belongs to Mrs. Vivoldi. (Ecklie looks up at the woman talking with the officer.) She called it in. We been waiting on you to take her statement.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Let's do it.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Yes, let's do it.</p>
<p>(Vartann turns and heads over to Mrs. Vivoldi. An officer holds the crime scene tape up for him and Ecklie.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>(The officer talking with Mrs. Vivoldi steps away. Det. Vartann and Ecklie interview Mrs. Vivoldi.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Ma'am, sorry to keep you waiting. I'm Detective Vartann. This is Conrad Ecklie from the crime lab. Do you mind if we ask you a few questions?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Vivoldi</strong>: I'd mind if you didn't. I am the one who found the body.</p>
<p>(Det. Vartann and Ecklie nod and smile.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Yes. At the time, were you walking to or from the hotel?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Vivoldi</strong>: I'd had just finished lunch with the girls. We say &quot;girls,&quot; but we're, you know, women. I don't find being called a &quot;girl&quot; derogatory.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: That's good. To or from?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Vivoldi</strong>: I was walking to the car. (She points to her car. Vartann turns to look.) The SUV? A gift from Oscar. Thirty years with the same man.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Vivoldi</strong>: Thank you. Are you married?</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Divorced.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Vivoldi</strong>: Oh. And you?</p>
<p>(She looks at Vartann.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: (squirms) Uh ... ma'am, so you were walking to your car ...</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Vivoldi</strong>: Walking to the car, and I think I stepped into gum or something ...</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Mrs. Vivoldi walks and steps in the blood. She looks down and screams when she sees the body.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(Ecklie looks down and notes the blood on Mrs. Vivoldi's shoes.) </p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Vivoldi</strong>: That's when I called 911. (pointedly at them as she checks her watch) Which was about, um ... two hours ago.</p>
<p>(Vartann looks around. Ecklie shakes his head and apologizes.) </p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: I'm sorry, ma'am. We've been very busy. </p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Vivoldi</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: I'm going to need your shoes. We'll get them back to you. Even wash off the blood.</p>

[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - INTERVIEW ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Sara interviews Mrs. Levine, Paula's mother, and Tripp Wilmont's parents.) </p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Levine</strong>: (crying) I just talked to Paula yesterday afternoon. She was on her way to the library. She had a biology final this morning. She shouldn't have been in a boy's room.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Wilmont</strong>: None of this makes any sense. Trip was a serious athlete. He would never sleep around the night before ...</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Levine</strong>: (offended) Sleep around?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Wilmont</strong>: It's not like your daughter was Trip's girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Levine</strong>: Ms. Sidle ... I need to know. Did trip take advantage ... ? Did he ... force himself on Paula?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Wilmont</strong>: (interrupts) My son would never force himself on anyone.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Wilmont</strong>: Trip could have any girl he wanted.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Mrs. Levine, the coroner found no evidence of assault. Did Paula ever mention Trip to you?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Levine</strong>: No. I know she liked a boy on the basketball team. I never knew his name. I guess it was Trip.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Wilmont</strong>: I just want to know what happened to them.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So do I.</p>

<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[EXT. FIELD -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Catherine and Warrick shut the vehicle door. David Phillips is standing near the body writing on the clipboard.) </p>
<p>(They head over to David Phillips, who is standing in the middle of the tall, grassy field.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: This land used to be part of the Bennett estate.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Bill Bennett? Guy who owns the Sahara?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah. Huh. We used to come out here when we were in high school. Used to be, like, a seven-acre lover's lane.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I thought you said you were a dork in high school.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I was a dork in high school. I'm still a dork, but I had dimples. I got a little action.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I don't doubt that. Hey, Dave.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Oh, hello. The path to the body was made by the paramedics. They pronounced and took off. ID'ed has Kevin Staniland, age 30 from Reno. I figured before I processed the body, you'd want to photograph the crop circle.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Crop circle?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Well, it's a circle in the middle of a field. What would you call it?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I guess it's a crop circle.</p>
<p>(They head toward the body.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: The guy has a blindfold on.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Pin the tail on the donkey gone wrong?</p>
<p>(Catherine snaps a couple of photos as David turns the body over.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Lividity is fixed.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Lividity's fixed? So this wasn't a body dump? He died there?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (looking around) The only pathway is from the paramedics. How'd he end up in the middle of the circle?</p>
<p>(David looks up at the sky.) </p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, I spoke with maintenance. It is an isolated incident. There are no other reports of exploding johns. How about methane gas? Maybe there's a natural reserve under the dorm.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Theoretically, pressure could have built up, broken a sewer pipe and shot up through the toilet.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (shrugs) Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I already checked. There's no methane gas in this region of Clare County.</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: That's odd, because the grass around the victim was undisturbed.</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Oh, hang on. We have ourselves a tapeworm, gentlemen.</p>
<p>(David stops snapping photos. Nick uses a forceps and pulls the tapeworm out.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: This guy's been eating meat or fish infected with tapeworm cyst.</p>

<p><strong>Mia Dickerson</strong>: The semen on the vic's doorknob and the neighbor's doorknob is consistent with Trip's DNA. So, what I'm thinking is that Trip put a trophy condom onto his neighbor's door and then transferred a trace of his reproductive material back onto his own doorknob.</p>

<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: A personal hour. A few weeks ago, my Siamese had kittens. I went by the house to check on 'em. They're just about weaned. You want one?</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: I'm allergic. So tell me about James Billmeyer. Guy found at the Tangiers.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: I'm just about to post him. Per my prelim, there was an abraded laceration to the right occipital scalp, and a penetration of the epithelium, but not the galea. It's not what killed him, but I'll know the full story once I open him up.</p>

<p><strong>Lawyer</strong>: Did you have a warrant for that tape?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The pilot gave us the name of the cameraman, who supplied the tape voluntarily.</p>
<p><strong>Host (man)</strong>: Look, I assured Kevin all our stunts were safe. And they were. Besides, he signed a waiver; I'm not guilty of anything.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: When you saw that he wasn't moving, you just took off. That sounds like guilt to me.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You scared him to death. He had a heart attack. So the signing of a waiver doesn't make it any less criminal.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: When the jury sees that tape, you'll be going all the way ... to jail. Second-degree murder. Twenty-five to life.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We had a one-hour recess -- I'm on my way back now. And this must be Mr. Billmeyer. I'm so glad he's back.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Very funny.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You might want to have Hodges analyze that cigar. Oh, and the print tech is free. He could, uh, spray the party hat with ninhydrin.</p>

<p><strong>Zack Capola</strong>: I swear, I don't know how that hole got there. And if you think that I had anything to do with Trip's death, you're wrong. I was in L.A. for four days. I had just gotten back, and I saw Susan banging on his door.</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: [HALLWAY] Susan knocks on the door just as Zack walks down the hallway toward his room.) </p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Can anyone verify that you were in L.A.?</p>
<p><strong>Zack Capola</strong>: The whole dorm can verify it. I was visiting my boyfriend. It was his birthday. We went to the auto show.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Does anyone else have access to your room?</p>
<p><strong>Zack Capola</strong>: No, I've got the only key, but like I said, it's easy enough to break in.</p>
<p>(Sara notices the burn on Zack's finger.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What happened to your finger?</p>
<p><strong>Zack Capola</strong>: I'm not sure. I had just gotten back from my trip, and I saw something on the floor, so I picked it up. It kind of burned me or something.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: And that didn't seem weird to you?</p>
<p><strong>Zack Capola</strong>: I'm in college. A lot of things seem weird to me.</p>
<p>(Sara smiles.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Okay. This thing ... that burned your finger, where is it now?</p>
<p><strong>Zack Capola</strong>: I tossed it.</p>
<p>(Sara looks at Greg.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Excuse me. </p>
<p>(Greg ducks under the crime scene tape and enters the room. He heads over to the trash bin and checks it.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I don't see anything but a couple pieces of balled up paper and a soda can. Nothing incendiary.</p>
<p><strong>Zack Capola</strong>: It was there. I don't know what to tell you, man.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: All right, Zack, we are not going to take you into custody, but we are going to need access to your room for the rest of the day.</p>
<p><strong>Zack Capola</strong>: Okay. I'm late for ancient history. Can I go?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Sure. (Sara points to the officer standing in the hallway.) And this, uh, this nice officer ... he's gonna be your &quot;study buddy.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Zack Capola</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>(Zack leaves with the officer right behind him.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, what are you thinking?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Name a chemical compound that can burn skin and can also disappear into thin air.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: The only thing I can think of is dry ice.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: And dry ice releases carbon dioxide as it sublimates.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yeah, but can you put enough dry ice in Zack's room to raise the amount of carbon dioxide in Trip's room to a lethal level?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Is that a dare?</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It took thirty pounds of dry ice to reach the lethal level of saturation.</p>
<p><strong>Bill</strong>: On the floor, where the sleeping bag was.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Carbon dioxide is one and half times heavier than air. You know, it's conceivable that if Trip and Paula had been sleeping in his bed, they might still be alive.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I think I know why the bodies turned pink.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Dry ice is cold. The dry ice significantly lowered the temperature in both rooms, and the drastic decrease in temperature can turn a dead body pink. We see it all the time when we pull dead bodies from frozen rivers.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (nods) Nice, Greg. You know, if Zachary is telling the truth, and he simply burned his finger on a remnant of dry ice, who put it there?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I'll have P.D. run a credit card check on everyone in the dorm, see if anyone recently purchased a large quantity of dry ice.</p>

<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Your decedent smells like a pine tree.</p>

<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Yeah, he died of a heavy heart. Heart weighed 50 grams instead of<br />
300. Hypertensive cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: So his heart stopped, he keeled over, hit his head on the pavement.</p>

<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Do you think he was aware of his condition?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Oh, I know he was. I sent blood to tox ; he was taking atenolol. A heart that size, he was a walking time bomb.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Yup, our guy chugged a beer, after he died. Lungs were full of foam.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: So somebody poured it down his throat?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Wouldn't be my postmortem beverage of choice, but to each his own. So did you get any prints off that cooler drawer?</p>

<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Well, thank you. Why don't you quit blowing smoke and tell me about the cigar?</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Huh. Low in nicotine, high in furfural. I compared it to other tobacco samples from the exemplar collection. It's consistent with the Perdomo Reserve brand. I took the liberty of calling a cigar society. They referred me to the Vegas distributor. Spoke to him directly. Perdomos are very high-end.<br />
(Neil walks into the lab.) He only made one sale this past month. It was to a guy in Seven Hills.</p>
<p>(Neil scrunches his face at the smell in the lab.) </p>
<p><strong>Neil Jansen</strong>: Smells like my grandfather. Am I interrupting?</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Actually, yeah. Conrad was about to pat me on the back.</p>
<p>(Ecklie smiles.) </p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: What do you got for me, Neil?</p>

<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I found this toilet behind my apartment complex. It's, uh, volunteered for an experiment.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It's moving.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I put dry ice in the bowl.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So you're thinking that the killer might have put his excess dry ice in the dorm toilet.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: When the ice was flushed, it would've lodged in the drain trap. As the ice sublimated and gas was released, it would've built up, causing the toilet to explode.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Good theory.</p>
<p>(The toilet water starts to bubble.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I spoke with Brass.</p>
<p>(Greg motions for them to move further away from the toilet experiment.) </p>

<p>(They step out of the experiment area. Greg closes the door. He puts his fingers over his ears.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: There's only two retail outlets in twenty miles that sell it, and no one's purchased a large quantity of dry ice in the last few weeks.</p>

<p>(Greg takes out Trip's s*x journal.) </p>
<p><strong>Susan</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Trip kept record of his, uh, relationships with women. Your name is in here. Three times. On, uh, February 2nd, you hooked up for the first time. Looks like second base. On February 9th, you rounded third, and on February<br />
18th, he got a grand slam.</p>
<p><strong>Susan</strong>: He wrote that down?</p>
<p>(Greg sits down.) </p>
<p><strong>Susan</strong>: We had s*x, I admit it. No big deal. I didn't tell you guys because I'm not exactly proud of it, okay?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Trip and Paula died from carbon dioxide gas. We already know that you have access to dry ice, and as a materials science grad student, you are familiar with the chemical properties. </p>
<p><strong>Susan</strong>: This is crazy.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Last week, you checked out forty pounds of dry ice from the campus lab.</p>
<p><strong>Susan</strong>: My thesis is on metallurgy. I use dry ice to test the physical constrains of certain metals.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I also spoke to your advisor, who told me that your experiments require two pounds of dry ice, at most. </p>

<p><strong>Greg</strong>: So drilling the hole in the wall and leaving the ice behind was an accident?</p>
<p><strong>Susan</strong>: No, no, look. Trip's room is 16 feet by nine feet. I used exactly the right amount of ice just to make him sick. If he had been in the bed three feet above the ground and not on the floor ... I just wanted him to miss his basketball game. Trip only slept on the floor when he had girls over, and he never had s*x before a big game. He shouldn't have been on the floor.</p>

<p>[INT. GRISSOM'S PLACE – KITCHEN -- DAY] </p>
<p>(BLUR IN on a glassware pot on the stove.) </p>
<p><strong>Madeline Klein</strong>: (V.O.) Nobody knew he was coming, Conrad. Nobody knew his name.</p>
<p>(Grissom is making soup.) </p>
<p><strong>Madeline Klein</strong>: (V.O.) Well, if you'd stop talking for a minute, you'd understand.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. COURTHOUSE – JURY ROOM – DAY]</p>
<p>(The large jury room is empty.)</p>
<p><strong>Madeline Klein</strong>: (V.O.) The investigation's been compromised. Lives are at risk.</p>
<p>(CUT TO: A legal pad and file are placed on the conference table. Another set of paper and file is placed on the table.) </p>
<p>(CUT TO: The jurors are sworn in. There's a board with crime scene photos up in the background.) </p>
<p><strong>Madeline Klein</strong>: (V.O.) How many people do the right thing anymore? Have a conscience? Don Cook didn't even know what he saw.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – INTERVIEW ROOM]</p>
<p>(Don Cook sits at the interview table.) </p>
<p><strong>Madeline Klein</strong>: (V.O.) El Matocho doesn't kill for the thrill or because he was abused as a child.</p>
<p>[EXT. NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Emilio Alvarado walks away and under a lamppost. It's light enough to identify him. The large tattooed letters on the back of his head are easily identified: L-A-T.) </p>
<p><strong>Madeline Klein</strong>: (V.O.) He kills because it's his answer to everything.</p>
<p>(He walks away.) </p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO: </p>
<p>[EXT. NIGHT]</p>
<p>(A car is on fire, burning from the inside.) </p>
<p><strong>Madeline Klein</strong>: (V.O.) I had him eyewitnessed. It was enough for an indictment. No indictment, no trial. He goes free and La Tijera gets stronger. So don't patronize me by saying this might be an accident.</p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO: </p>
<p>[EXT. NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Fire crew and other personnel are at the site, the car fire is out and smolders. It's covered with foam.)</p>
<p><strong>Madeline Klein</strong>: (V.O.) I'm not asking you for advice here, I'm telling you: I want Grissom.</p>
<p>(A black car pulls off the side of the road. The door opens and Madeline Klein steps out of the car. She's on the phone continuing her conversation with Conrad Ecklie.) </p>
<p><strong>Madeline Klein</strong>: (to phone) Maybe the reception sucks out here.</p>
<p>(She closes the car door and heads for the site.) </p>
<p><strong>Madeline Klein</strong>: (to phone) I said I want Grissom. Say I asked for him personally.</p>
<p>(She hangs up.) </p>
<p>(She walks over to the forensic techs standing near the site drinking coffee and waiting.) </p>
<p><strong>Madeline Klein</strong>: I don't want anyone touching anything. Thanks for all your help, guys.</p>
<p><strong>Tech</strong>: (o.s.) Yes, ma'am.</p>
<p>(She turns and walks over to Brass.) </p>
<p><strong>Madeline Klein</strong>: Case is reassigned to Grissom.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: He's home sick, Maddy.</p>
<p><strong>Madeline Klein</strong>: Yeah, I heard all about it from Ecklie. Blah, blah, blah. The point that he and you seem to be missing is that I have 18 grand jurists sifting through evidence, trying to help me indict one of the deadliest gangs this city has ever ...</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (shouts, interrupts) Who's in charge of the scene?!</p>
<p>(Robbins, a coroner's assistant and David Phillips are with the body. David is examining the body.) </p>
<p>(Brass points to Maddy.) </p>
<p><strong>Madeline Klein</strong>: I am. (mutters) For God's sake.</p>
<p>(Maddy and Brass head for the body.) </p>
<p><strong>Madeline Klein</strong>: Madeleine Klein, Deputy DA.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Albert Robbins, Clark County Coroner.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Talk to me, David.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Confirms it's Don Cook.</p>
<p>(David hands the wallet to Brass.) </p>
<p><strong>Madeline Klein</strong>: This is on us.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What do you got, Doc?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Other than the obvious burns over the better part of his body, there's this.</p>
<p>(David and the assistant roll the body to show the wound on the back.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: He was shot.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. GRISSOM'S PLACE – NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Grissom is in the kitchen cooking soup. An aria plays over the sound system. Grissom coughs and it's obvious he's sick.) </p>
<p>(Hank sits on the kitchen floor nearby.) </p>
<p>(Grissom stirs the soup cooking on the stove. He tastes it with a wooden spoon. The phone rings.) </p>
<p>(Grissom picks up his cell phone and looks at it.) </p>
<p>4:00 AM<br />
CALL FROM<br />
ECKLIE<br />
702-555-0108</p>
<p>(Grissom turns the phone off.)</p>
<p>(Hank makes a sympathetic bark. Grissom turns and looks at Hank. Hank looks back at him.) </p>
<p>FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[EXT. ROADWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Two police cars are parked at angles on the road and a strip of crime scene tape is tied between them to block the roadway. Catherine is doing a walk-through on the road as she talks to Grissom on the phone.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to phone) Let me run it down for you. Isolated stretch of Route<br />
2, burned car on the shoulder, burned male victim out of the car 20 feet away.</p>
<p>(She walks past Greg, who is busy with a clipboard. A scarf is wrapped around his neck. She continues toward Madeline Klein, who is standing near her car.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to phone) Single gunshot wound to the lower back. Passing motorist called it in. Fire department arrived within 12 minutes. Fire burned so hot, they had to use foam to put it out, which, of course, is never good for us.</p>
<p><strong>Madeline Klein</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p>(Maddy takes the phone from Catherine and walks as she talks. Catherine walks along with her.) </p>
<p><strong>Madeline Klein</strong>: (to phone) I've been waiting over an hour for you. What, are you walking here? (pauses) How many times have I gotten out of bed in the middle of the night for you, Gil? (pause) Yeah. Yeah, well, I'd like to phone it in, too. I left an AA meeting for this. That trumps walking pneumonia.</p>
<p>(Maddy hands the phone back to Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Madeline Klein</strong>: Here you go, eyes-and-ears.</p>
<p>(Maddy turns and leaves.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We'll keep in touch.</p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[INT. GRISSOM'S PLACE – DAY]</p>
<p>(Grissom pours a packet of powder into his drink.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (from phone) So the Deputy DA got out of bed for you? Whose bed?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to phone) Talk to me about the road.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (from phone) All right.</p>
<p>(Catherine is on the road. Warrick is there snapping photos.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to phone) The debris path starts approximately 100 yards from where the vehicle came to rest.</p>
<p>(Warrick puts an evidence marker down on the road.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (from phone) Show me what you see.</p>
<p>(Catherine takes photos of the road around her and e-mails the photos to Grissom. She heads for the burned car.) </p>
<p>[INT. GRISSOM'S PLACE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Grissom sits on the couch as he works on the laptop. Hank lies on the couch behind him.) </p>
<p>(He opens the first e-mail photo and looks at it.)<br />

Case #080403 – 1916 GG Crime Scene Photos<br />
Date: 04/03/08<br />
Time: 8:13 AM )</p>
<p>(Warrick notes Greg is wrapped with his scarf around his neck.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What are you doing, a catalog shoot? Where's your matching hat with your pom-pom?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Leave me alone. I have a cold. (looks at clipboard) So, based on the debris pattern, the victim was driving the car when the blaze started. Swerving all over the road. Probably because he was on fire.</p>
<p>(Warrick and Greg look down the road.) </p>
<p>START: VISUALIZATION</p>
<p>(The victim's car zooms through the road. It is on fire as it swerves this way and that, tires screeching. It heads straight through Warrick.) </p>
<p>(Greg turns and watches the car swerve off the side of the road and stop where the current burned car is.) </p>
<p>END: VISUALIZATION</p>
<p>(Greg looks at Warrick.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Sounds about right.</p>
<p>(Catherine approaches the burned car and takes a photo of the back end.) </p>
<p>(She moves in closer and notes a discarded shoe on the grass near the closed driver-side door. She hears a loud sneeze.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Gesundheit.</p>
<p>(Nick sniffles. He's in front of the car) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Thanks. Boy, I hope I'm not getting sick. I'm not finding any pour patterns on the exterior. The hood and the front quarter panels are down to the primer and the front tires are burnt down to the rim. Think the fire probably started in the engine compartment.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: New car engines don't catch fire, not by accident.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Now we'll have to get it back to the lab for a closer look.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And guys on fire don't stop to close doors.</p>
<p>(Catherine snaps a photo of the closed door.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No, no, I talked to the battalion chief about that. He said the driver's side was open when his boys showed up, and that the pressure from the hose probably closed it.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Probably? (mutters) Hosers.</p>
<p>(Catherine looks at the back of the car.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Nick, come here.</p>
<p>(Nick joins her. She points to the back of the car.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Um. Clear that off, would you?</p>
<p>(Nick wipes the foam off the bumper to reveal a tag: L-A-T.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: &quot;L-A-T.&quot; That's La Tijera's tag.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. GRISSOM'S PLACE – DAY]</p>
<p>(Grissom is in his bathrobe as he goes to answer the front door. Maddy walks in carrying a file box.) </p>
<p><strong>Madeline Klein</strong>: Boy, you look like hell. I need sugar. You got a soda?</p>
<p>(Grissom closes the door.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Nice to see you, too, Maddy.</p>
<p>(Maddy puts the file box down on the table. Grissom heads down the steps and toward the kitchen.) </p>
<p><strong>Madeline Klein</strong>: Six months' worth of investigation; two months working with the grand jury; five low-level indictments against the LATs. Why you? (mutters)<br />
'Cause you're the only one who won't screw it up.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: My team won't screw it up.</p>
<p><strong>Madeline Klein</strong>: Oh, right. Your team. Warrick Brown got mixed up with a crooked judge. Sanders ran down a civilian while on duty. Ms. Willows lied about being at a crime scene, among other things. </p>
<p>(Maddy holds a disk and opens the file box.) </p>
<p><strong>Madeline Klein</strong>: And who can forget Stokes, your straight arrow? Suspected of killing his hooker girlfriend. (Grissom returns.) How does the song go? &quot;You call me up, I get 'em out of it&quot;? If it weren't for me, you'd have no team.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Are you done?</p>
<p>(He opens the soda can and offers it to her.) </p>
<p><strong>Madeline Klein</strong>: Sorry. You have a ... ?</p>
<p>(She holds up the disk. Grissom takes it from her and gives her the soda.) </p>
<p>(Grissom goes to play the disk. Maddy sits down.) </p>
<p><strong>Madeline Klein</strong>: This was recorded two weeks ago. This guy had no idea that what he saw was the key to bringing down La Tijera and their leader, El Matocho.</p>
<p>(Grissom picks up the remote and plays the disk as he settles on the couch. It's a video recording of Brass' interview with Don Cook date-stamped March 19, 2008, at 1:18 PM.) </p>
<p><strong>Don Cook</strong>: (from dvd) Okay, I know this is my third violation, but I was not speeding. I-I blew past that light because I had a fight with my wife.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (from dvd) Listen, you're not here for a traffic violation, okay? Now, after you ran the red light, the street camera didn't pick you up at the next intersection. Where'd you go?</p>
<p><strong>Don Cook</strong>: (from dvd) Okay, look, I, I cannot have my license suspended. I have a vending machine business.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (from dvd) You're not here for a traffic violation. Let's get that straight. Now, did you see anyone in particular? Do you remember that night?</p>
<p><strong>Don Cook</strong>: (from dvd) Yeah, yeah, no. Um, yeah, there was, there was a guy who walked past my car.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (from dvd) Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Don Cook</strong>: (from dvd) I thought I was gonna get robbed on top of everything else.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (from dvd) Can you identify him, hmm?</p>
<p><strong>Don Cook</strong>: (from dvd) Sure, yeah. He walked under a streetlight. I saw him. I saw him real clear. He, um ... He was Hispanic ... uh ... I don't know, bald, scary looking.</p>
<p>(Maddy pauses the video and goes through the file folder.) </p>
<p><strong>Madeline Klein</strong>: &quot;LAT&quot; carved into the cheek of the victim is the signature of El Matocho, La Tijera's number one.</p>
<p>(She hands Grissom a photo. On it is &quot;LAT&quot; carved on a man's cheek.) </p>
<p><strong>Madeline Klein</strong>: He killed gang leader, Little Gordo, but he was a ghost--no face, no name.</p>
<p>INSERT: FLASHBACK</p>
<p>[INT. CAR (PARKED) -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Don Cook is in his car and parks. He looks out and sees Alvarado walking away.) </p>
<p><strong>Madeline Klein</strong>: (V.O.) Until Don Cook ID'd Emilio Alvarado coming out of Little Gordo's house around the time of the murder.</p>
<p>RESUME SCENE.</p>
<p>(Grissom looks at the photos.) </p>
<p><strong>Madeline Klein</strong>: Turns out Alvarado was caught up in a gang sweep day after the murder. Parole violation. He got 30 days. PD thought he was just another lowlife. Due to be released in 52 hours. Can't indict Alvarado with a dead witness. We need to prove conspiracy.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You need to prove that Alvarado ordered a hit on your witness.</p>
<p><strong>Madeline Klein</strong>: How long do you think it'll take you to bone up on these and put a suit on?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – BRASS' OFFICE – DAY]</p>
<p>(Cody Cook, Don Cook's wife, takes out a cigarette and looks at Brass. She sits on the couch in Brass' office.) </p>
<p><strong>Cody Cook</strong>: Can I smoke in here?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Uh, no. It's a ... it's a government building.</p>
<p>(She toys with the unlit cigarette. Brass pulls up a chair and sits down.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'm very sorry for your loss. So when was the last time you saw Don?</p>
<p><strong>Cody Cook</strong>: Last night. We go to my folks' house every Sunday.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Mrs. Cook, did you know that your husband was going to testify before a grand jury?</p>
<p><strong>Cody Cook</strong>: We talked about it. I told him I didn't want him to do it. But he found out about this girl, what the gang did to her.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Did he confide in anyone else?</p>
<p><strong>Cody Cook</strong>: He said it was a secret.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Did you tell anyone?</p>
<p><strong>Cody Cook</strong>: No. Well ... sort of. I told my mom and dad and my best friend, Jenny. She's my hairdresser. I tell her everything.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'm gonna need their phone numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Cody Cook</strong>: Did I do something wrong?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – FORENSIC AUTOPSY – DAY]</p>
<p>(The victim's partially burned body is on the table as David stands above it taking photos. Robbins stands behind the body, working on it. Catherine walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, hey, Dave, nice haircut. What gives?</p>
<p>(David steps down from the stepladder.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Oh, Mrs. Phillips. An extreme makeover.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mm. Oh, make sure you get those photos to Grissom.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: I'm all over it.</p>
<p>(David leaves.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Sign of a good marriage. Wife still wants to change him. So your vic's burns are concentrated on the face, hands, knees and feet. It's consistent with an engine fire.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Don Cook sits in the car behind the steering wheel when the dashboard in front of him catches fire. He puts his hand and arm up to deflect the fire, but it doesn't work.) </p>
<p>(He screams.)</p>
<p>(He grips the steering wheel and his hands catch on fire. He screams.) </p>
<p>(End flashback.) </p>
<p>(Robbins hands Catherine a small container with the bullet inside. She looks at it.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Jacketed hollowpoint. One cannelure. Looks like a .38.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Yeah. Entered through the right renal artery. That's COD.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – GARAGE – DAY]</p>
<p>(Nick is working under the hood of the car. He pulls out some wires. On the floor at his feet is a mat with various parts removed from the car.) </p>
<p>(Nick coughs. He gets back to work. He coughs again.) </p>
<p>(Greg walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Wow. I bet it reeks in here.</p>
<p>(Nick looks at him and shakes his head.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I wouldn't know. </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Thank God for stuffy noses.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: DA Klein asked Grissom, who asked Catherine, who told me to tell you that we need to figure out if the victim was shot before he got in the car, while he was in the car or after he got out.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay ... uh ... there was no blood trail at the scene. Fire pretty much took care of that. And I doubt you're gonna find any trace of blood in that burnt-up driver seat.</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Eliminates the first scenario.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: So either the shooter kidnaps him and shot him while he was driving ...</p>

<p><strong>Madeline Klein</strong>: Until Dr. Grissom can corroborate Mr. Cook's testimony, I can't tell you the content.</p>
<p><strong>Tim O'Shea (juror)</strong>: Mr. O'Shea. We've been locked up in here ten hours a day, two months, all cloak-and-dagger. La Tijera doesn't know we're investigating them, so they couldn't know about the witness.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, we found their signature at the crime scene. So it's possible they do know.</p>

<p>(They stop at the counter where Grissom prepares the cup of tea as he listens.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So I called him up about a week later and ... uh ... took him to lunch and I showed him a picture of ... uh ... of a girl that they had killed, you know. She was 16, innocent, beautiful. She was raped, shot, and urinated on. And when that didn't kill her, they slit her throat. So I had him on the hook. When I told him that ... uh ... you know, if he testified, I'd protect him and his family if the case ever came to trial. On Friday, he called Maddy, said he changed his mind, he'd testify. And on Sunday ... he was dead. I couldn't protect him.</p>

<p><strong>Richard O'Malley</strong>: Hey, look, I begged Donnie not to testify. He and Cody had everything to lose. They were doing great with their vending machines. No grandkids yet, but that's probably 'cause their marriage was shaky already. Cody has her mother's temper. She loved him, though. We all did.</p>

<p><strong>Richard O'Malley</strong>: Well, you're going to find mine all over.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: That's why I'm going to get yours, too, sir. So I can exclude you. Follow me.</p>
<p>(Nick leads Richard O'Malley to the car. They walk past Brass, who is still talking with Cody Cook.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Now hold on. Help me out here.</p>
<p><strong>Cody Cook</strong>: I already told you why I wasn't in that car. My husband and I were arguing. He was yelling at me.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [NIGHT] Cody and Don are arguing outside the house. Her parents are there watching.) </p>
<p><strong>Cody Cook</strong>: Okay, I'm having a hard time keeping it straight. You do like my dress? You don't like my dress?</p>
<p><strong>Don Cook</strong>: Can we please just not talk about this now?</p>
<p><strong>Cody Cook</strong>: When should we talk about it?</p>
<p><strong>Don Cook</strong>: Cody, get in the car.</p>
<p><strong>Cody Cook</strong>: No, I'm not going to get in the car.</p>
<p><strong>Don Cook</strong>: Listen. I loved the dress till I found out it cost 300 bucks.</p>
<p><strong>Cody Cook</strong>: Oh, three hun--</p>
<p><strong>Don Cook</strong>: You have a closet full of dresses ... get in the car.</p>
<p><strong>Cody Cook</strong>: No. Not until you apologize. Apologize to my parents!</p>
<p><strong>Don Cook</strong>: I'm not apologizing.</p>
<p>(Don gets into the car and drives away, leaving Cody behind.) </p>
<p><strong>Cody</strong>: (V.O.) I told him not to call me until the court thing was over. I needed to cool off.</p>
<p>(Cody heads back into the house.) </p>
<p>(End flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Cody Cook</strong>: My dad says I was lucky.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Ma'am, I'm going to need to get your fingerprints, too.</p>
<p><strong>Cody Cook</strong>: I don't like where this is going.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: It's going downtown.</p>

<p>(Nick scans the fingerprint card into the system.) </p>
<p>(He scans RICHARD O'MALLEY'S fingerprint card into the system.) </p>
<p>(CUT TO: Nick grabs the stencils out of the crate and looks through them. He finds a stencil for an &quot;L&quot;. There's green paint on the stencil.) </p>

[INT. PD – INTERVIEW ROOM A]</p>
<p>(Brass interviews Cody Cook.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So you killed him. And made it look like a gang did it. And then you could buy all the expensive dresses you want.</p>
<p><strong>Cody Cook</strong>: I loved my husband. I didn't kill him, okay? You don't know me. You don't know my life.</p>
<p>[INT. CSI – LAB]</p>
<p>(Nick snips a sample off the paint brush.) </p>
<p>(He dusts the paint brush handle.) </p>
<p>(He tape lifts a print off the paint brush handle and looks at it.) </p>
<p>[INT. PD – INTERVIEW ROOM]</p>
<p>(Richard O'Malley is in handcuffs. Brass and Nick are in the room with him.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I found your fingerprints on a stencil. It was the one with green paint all over it. And the paint from one of your paintbrushes is a match to the car.</p>
<p>(Richard O'Malley is quiet.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Your daughter said you disappeared into the garage right after dinner. That's when you stuck the rag in the engine between the catalytic converter and the heat shield.</p>
<p>(Richard O'Malley still doesn't respond.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I think we all know what that did. Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hey, you don't want to say anything, fine. Write him up. Process him.</p>
<p>(The guard escorts Richard O'Malley to the door. Through the glass, Cody Cook stands out in the hallway watching. They leave.) </p>
<p>(Nick and Brass head out the other door.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You think the daughter had anything to do with it?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Cody Cook</strong>: (shouts, o.s.) How could you?!</p>
<p><strong>Richard O'Malley</strong>: (o.s.) How could I what?</p>
<p>(Brass and Nick step out into the hallway.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (to Nick) Cook was her meal ticket.</p>
<p><strong>Cody Cook</strong>: (shouts, o.s.) You son of a bitch! You were gonna kill your own daughter?!</p>
<p><strong>Richard O'Malley</strong>: (o.s.) No, I did this for you!</p>
<p>(Brass rolls his eyes and heads down the hallway and turns the corner.) </p>
<p><strong>Cody Cook</strong>: (shouts, o.s.) Over money so you could get our business?!</p>
<p>(Brass and Nick turn the corner to find two officers holding Cody and Richard apart.) </p>
<p><strong>Richard O'Malley</strong>: I would never let you get in that car!</p>
<p><strong>Cody Cook</strong>: Well, you didn't try to stop me! You just stood there!</p>
<p><strong>Richard O'Malley</strong>: How many Sundays did you come over and bitch to your mother about that selfish, ungrateful b*st*rd?!</p>
<p><strong>Cody Cook</strong>: Don wanted to give you the money; I said no! And all those nights Mom and I stayed up talking -- it was about you!</p>
<p><strong>Richard O'Malley</strong>: You owed me!</p>
<p><strong>Cody Cook</strong>: I hate you!</p>
<p><strong>Richard O'Malley</strong>: I did you a favor!</p>

[INT. CSI – GRISSOM'S OFFICE]</p>
<p>(Grissom is working behind his desk. Catherine knocks on the door. Grissom looks up and she enters.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Never thought I'd be disappointed that we solved a case.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p>(She looks at the files he's working on.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Court personnel files?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Reading upside down is a talent.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What are you looking for?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The leak. Ninety minutes after the warrant was issued, Alvarado's apartment went up.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So you're looking at the judge, his staff, the clerk that issued the warrant, court reporter, any cops who knew ...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, but according to this, everybody cleared. The only ones left are the grand jurors ... and Maddy Klein.</p>

<p><strong>Archie</strong>: Okay. It's going to be tough to go fast with that many names.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, no. I can narrow it down. It's a 90-minute window, yesterday, at 12:00 noon to 1:30. Just cell phone calls.</p>
<p><strong>Archie</strong>: Okay. Give me a name and a number.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Timothy O'Shea. 702-555-0124</p>
<p>(Archie runs the search through the PHONE RECORDS DATABASE.) </p>
<p>(The computer beeps and the results appear.) </p>
<p><strong>Archie</strong>: He called two numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Do a reverse lookup.</p>
<p><strong>Archie</strong>: Looks like he called his wife and his home line. Next.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Has she called the number before, within the last two weeks?</p>
<p><strong>Archie</strong>: Monday through Friday, both weeks, she called a different disposable cell phone. That's weird.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay. Try the text messages.</p>
<p><strong>Archie</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(The computer beeps. Archie pulls up the text messages.) </p>

<p>(Grissom and Maddy Klein talk with Marie Leahy.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How did they contact you, Miss Leahy?</p>
<p><strong>Marie Leahy</strong>: Uh ... a few weeks ago, at a gas station near my house, this ... uh ... this woman comes up to me and ... uh ... she knows everything about Peter. That's my ... uh ... little brother in Chicago. He's only 19. Got ten years for something he didn't do. And she said they'd get him out. And they did. Guy just confessed and my brother's set to go free. (crying) Did that witness die because of me?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Can you give us a description of the woman?</p>
<p>(Marie shakes her head.) </p>
<p><strong>Marie Leahy</strong>: She was white ... uh ... short brown hair ... I'm sorry. I only seen her once.</p>

[INT. CSI – LAYOUT ROOM – MORNING]</p>
<p>(Warrick joins Nick in the layout room. Photos and other file material are spread out on the table.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Alvarado gets out in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: It is the morning.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Exactly.</p>
<p>(Nick sighs.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You know, none of these people make a move without a direct order from Alvarado, especially not torching his own place.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, think about it. When Marie leaked the warrant information, it had to have gone in and out through him somehow. He's the boss.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I don't see how; the guy's in complete isolation. They even assigned him a special hand-picked guard. Look.</p>
<p>(Warrick puts photos of Alvarado's cell in front of Nick.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: There's no privileges in isolation.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Things still move in and out of his cell: laundry, food.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: The only thing I saw from the outside was a book. They say he's a big reader. But I looked it over; there's nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What about all the other books he's been reading?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. JAIL – LIBRARY – MORNING]</p>
<p>(Grissom puts on his gloves as he looks at the library bookshelves. Alvarado's guard, Ron Pen, stands nearby and watches.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How does Alvarado get his books?</p>
<p><strong>Ron Pen</strong>: It's like a regular library. When a book's checked out, a trustee writes down the inmate's name, booking number and date. Gets checked back in the same way.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I need to see every book that Alvarado checked out.</p>
<p>(Ron Pen opens the log and reads the book titles.) </p>
<p><strong>Ron Pen</strong>: What Is the What?, The Infinite Plan, and Herzog. Oh ... and The Inferno.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (looking at shelf) Alphabetical by author?</p>
<p><strong>Ron Pen</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>(Grissom goes to the shelves on the side of the room.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: David Eggers.</p>
<p>(He finds the book What is the What and flips through it.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: There's pages missing.</p>
<p>(Grissom looks around for the next book.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Allende.</p>
<p>(He finds The Infinite Plan. He flips through it and finds pages ripped out.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How many books has he read in the last 48 hours?</p>
<p><strong>Ron Pen</strong>: Two. (reaches for a book on the shelf) He said he didn't like this one; returned it yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>(He hands Herzog to Grissom. Grissom flips through it and finds pages ripped out. He thinks about it.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Where's The Inferno?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. JAIL – ALVARADO'S CELL]</p>
<p>(Alvarado's cell door opens and he steps out of the cell. Grissom and Ron Pen arrive just as the Discharge Guard is escorting Alvarado out.) </p>
<p><strong>Ron Pen</strong>: Hold up a minute.</p>
<p><strong>Discharge Guard</strong>: Orders to process him out.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Just hold him.</p>
<p>(The Discharge Guard turns Alvarado toward the cell door.) </p>
<p>(Grissom walks up to the open cell door, reaches inside and picks up a copy of The Divine Comedy.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This is a good book, Mr. Alvarado. Which Circle of Hell would you be in? </p>
<p><strong>Emilio Alvarado</strong>: The Seventh, the outer one.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Those who commit violence against others.</p>
<p>(Alvarado smiles at Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Emilio Alvarado</strong>: Souls plunge into a river of boiling blood.</p>
<p>(The guard turns Alvarado back toward the wall. Grissom flips through the book and stops on a crinkled page. He smells it.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to Rob Pen) Officer, do you have a lighter? No pen, no paper ... so you used what you had, huh?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Alvarado is in his cell and puts a cup on his bunker. He opens the book to a random page and writes with a swab.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) A book for paper, and for ink, urine.</p>
<p>(End flashback.)</p>
<p>(Grissom uses the lighter and heats up the back of the page.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Once the urine dries, the writing becomes invisible ... until it's heated, making the acid in the urine turn brown.</p>
<p>(Writing appears on the page.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Then you..uh..put the book back in the library, another prisoner checks it out, tears out the page, gives it to a visitor, and you get your message out. Yes?</p>
<p><strong>Rob Pen</strong>: Put him back in his house.</p>
<p>(The Discharge Guard turns Alvarado back toward the cell. Alvarado looks at Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Emilio Alvarado</strong>: Mira, usted se va a morir.</p>
<p>(The cell door closes on Alvarado, back in his cell.) </p>

CARVE MK FOR ME<br />
SEND A PHOTO )</p>
<p>(Madeline Klein sits back, looks at Grissom and sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Madeline Klein</strong>: Well, I was right about Alvarado: he was leaving Vegas. Otherwise, he would have killed me himself.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>Madeline Klein</strong>: Yeah. Guess now, I owe you one, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I don't keep score, Madeleine.</p>
<p><strong>Madeline Klein</strong>: You know what, Gilbert? You're the only man I know who's never let me down. Which means that you're either a classic enabler or my soul mate.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. GRISSOM'S PLACE – DAY]</p>
<p>(The front door opens and Grissom returns with Hank on a leash. He closes the door and puts his keys down on the table nearby. He unleashes Hank and goes to sit on the couch.)</p>
<p>(It's quiet. Grissom sighs and puts his head down in his hand.) </p>
<p>(His phone rings. Grissom drops the leash on the table and picks up his cell. He looks at the number.) </p>
<p>(He lies back on the couch and answers the phone.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hi. </p>
<p>(He chuckles.)</p>

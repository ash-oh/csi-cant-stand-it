							<p>FLASH IN.</p>
<p>[VARIOUS EXT. LAST VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[EXT. TRAILER PARK - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(A trailer in the trailer park is on fire. There are a series of explosions within the fire.) </p>
<p>(A helicopter flies overhead.) </p>
<p><strong>Helicopter Pilot</strong>: (over radio) Control, this is air one. I'm at the trailer park 402. There's a large gas main construction fire. (audio fades out, continues in cc) The scene is totally involved. Dispatch additional fire units and paramedics. Over.</p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
(The firefighters are there spraying water on the blaze. The helicopter flies overhead.) </p>
<p>(CC) WOMAN: We need your help!</p>
<p>TIME CUT TO: </p>
<p>[EXT. TRAILER PARK - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The fire is out. The CSIs arrive as the officers are putting up the crime scene tape. They stop just outside the tape and look at the damage.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Warrick, why don't you and I take the perimeter and work our way in.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: All right. (motions to Greg) Greg, you're with us.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I'll start the sketch.</p>
<p>(They all duck under the tape and head toward the burned trailer. Wilcox walks past them.) </p>
<p><strong>Wilcox</strong>: How you doing, Nick?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (smiling) Above ground, Wilcox.</p>
<p>(Sara and Nick follow Grissom toward the trailer.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Would you like inside or out?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I'll take in.</p>
<p>(They head toward Brass, who is inside the trailer.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We got two victims. We think the girl is Selena March. She owns the trailer.</p>
<p>(They shine their flashlights down on the blonde-haired woman on the ground near Brass. There's a second body near her.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What about the male?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Nothing yet.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: This is a piece of the roof right here -- fiberglass and particle board. These things weren't built to last.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: They were built to burn.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: This place is totaled. The bed's collapsed.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Metcalf</strong>: My money's on meth lab.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You know, Metcalf, just because somebody lives in a trailer park, doesn't mean they're a meth cook.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Metcalf</strong>: You guys are a real pain in the ass, you know that?</p>
<p>(Grissom heads out.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Get used to it, pal.</p>
<p>FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. TRAILER PARK - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Brass is talking with the neighbors gathered outside.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'm just having a little trouble understanding this because you all live so close together. You mean none of you saw the explosion?</p>
<p>(Randy Swansinger steps forward.) </p>
<p><strong>Randy Swansinger</strong>: Uh, I heard it.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, good.</p>
<p><strong>Randy Swansinger</strong>: When I came out about five minutes later, the whole place was burnin' up.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Where do you live?</p>
<p><strong>Randy Swansinger</strong>: (points) Right over there.</p>
<p>(Brass turns to look.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Uh-huh. (He turns back to look at the man.) All right, let me get this straight -- you heard a blast like that coming from your neighbor's and it took you five minutes to poke your head out and see what was going on?</p>
<p><strong>Randy Swansinger</strong>: I was watching TV.</p>
<p>(A woman standing next to him interrupts.) </p>
<p><strong>Nosy Lady</strong>: I'm sure he was drinking.</p>
<p>(Randy Swansinger sighs and turns to leave. Brass stops him.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No, hang around, hang around. Hey, hang around.</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: Did you find a man in Selena's trailer?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Now why would you ask that? Was Selena a hooker?</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: I'm sure I don't know. But one thing I do know, that's not Selena's car.</p>
<p>(She looks pointedly at the car parked outside the trailer.)</p>
<p>[INT. TRAILER PARK - TRAILER -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Sara is looking at some blue paint on the gas main in the trailer.)</p>
<p>(Outside, Catherine and Warrick are crouched down looking at something. Catherine's phone rings.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (over phone) Catherine, we have a 4-19 off Industrial. Would you like to handle it?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to phone) So you get the team back together only to break us apart again. What kind of a perverse game are you playing here, Gil?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (from phone) I'm not a pervert.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to phone) Yeah, I'll cover it. I'm taking Warrick.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[EXT. INDUSTRIAL - STRIP CLUB - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Warrick and Catherine walk down the sidewalk toward the taped-off area.) </p>
<p>(An officer is already there. They head toward the scene.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer DA Michaels</strong>: Oh, hey, guys. Good to see you. Hey, would you tell Nick I hope there's no hard feelings about that whole, you know, abduction thing. He hasn't returned my calls.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: He's been busy.</p>
<p><strong>Vartann</strong>: Squad car found her about a half hour ago -- no ID, but there's a lot of homeless in this area.</p>
<p>(Warrick crouches down and starts snapping photos of the victim. Catherine remains standing nearby, shining her flashlight on the victim.) </p>
<p><strong>Vartann</strong>: Looks like somebody took something to her head.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Vartann</strong>: Didn't find a weapon, but my guys are still looking.</p>
<p>(The woman is wearing a shopping bag with the following printed on top in red:<br />
BONANZA<br />
WORLD'S LARGEST GIFT SHOP<br />
www.bonanzagifts.com<br />
Sahara &amp; the Strip<br />
Las Vegas, Nevada</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: A shopping bag for a shirt, rubber boots and a g-string. Homeless stripper?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, this is g-string row, isn't it?</p>
<p>(Warrick puts a hand to his forehead. Catherine notices the ring on his finger.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Why is there a ring on your ring finger?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Because I'm married.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What?</p>
<p>(Warrick glances at Catherine and nods his head.) </p>
<p><strong>Vartann</strong>: (joking) Congratulations. How much did you pay her? </p>
<p>(Vartann steps forward and shakes Warrick's hand. Warrick chuckles as he stands.) </p>
<p><strong>Vartann</strong>: No, seriously, good luck with that, man. I didn't even know you had a girlfriend.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Oh, yeah, it's a girl I've been dating a couple months--Tina.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: How long have you been married?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Since yesterday. Did this, uh, drive-through wedding at Circus Circus Way, you know. Fun, yeah, we, uh ... fun time.</p>
<p>(Vartann smiles as Warrick walks a little. David joins them.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Hey. Sorry I'm late. Busy night.</p>
<p>(David puts his kit down near the body and kneels next to Warrick near the body.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We need a TOD, David.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Rigor's barely set, so not long--under four hours.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: About as long as Warrick's been married.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: You're married? Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Thanks. Do you think she was dumped?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Lividity is consistent with the position of the body. So it's highly unlikely.</p>
<p><strong>Vartann</strong>: All right. I'll check out the strip clubs.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'll go with you.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) -- DAWN] </p>
<p>[INT. TRAILER - DAWN]</p>
<p>(It's morning. Nick steps out from one of the rooms into the living room. He's holding a hot plate and cord in his hand. He walks over to Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, there doesn't seem to be any drug-manufacturing supplies, but plenty of ignition sources: a hot plate, fondue pot, gas stove, candles. One leaky pipe's all it takes.</p>
<p>(Grissom looks around. He doesn't say anything.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Which I haven't found yet.</p>
<p>(Nearby, Sara examines a burned item.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, but even if you had, that would only explain the explosion in here, not the ruptured gas main outside.</p>
<p>(Sara walks over to Grissom and Nick.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Think I can help you with that. I found this gas meter over by the main. Trailer blows, this thing becomes a missile.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: The gas main explodes, sending the gas meter flying toward the trailer. It hits the pipes, causing a second explosion.) </p>
<p>(End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: One explosion leads to another.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, but where did it all start?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Greg reports to Grissom as they walk through the hallway.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Brass ran the plates on that Acura near the trailer. It's registered to a Robert Durgee.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You get his photo from the DMV?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Confirmed as the vic -- Henderson address, mortgage broker. Wife's name was on the insurance card.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: She coming in?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: She wasn't home. Brass is tracking her down.</p>
<p>(Greg leaves. Judy Tremont, the receptionist, stops Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Judy Tremont</strong>: Excuse me, Mr. Grissom ... (Grissom walks over to her. She has a plastic bag in front of her.) An officer brought this in off a call from Flora Nevada Nursery. They thought it might have something to do with the Walter Gordon case.</p>
<p>(Grissom takes the bag and sees that there's a burned cassette tape inside.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Robbins reports his findings to Nick and Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Female's lungs were filled with soot. COD is smoke inhalation. </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay, that means the natural gas didn't suffocate her. Explosion probably knocked her out before the fire even started.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Yeah, male didn't even last that long. His lungs were clean, but he suffered fatal crushing injuries to his abdomen. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The pieces of debris that were on this guy's body were not heavy. But the bed he was lying in collapsed.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Explosion could've done that.</p>
<p>(Grissom looks closer at the bruises on the body.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Let's photo-enhance these bruises.</p>
<p>(Grissom attaches the lens to the camera mounted on a stand over the body while Nick sets up the computer. He goes to help Grissom by adjusting the light.) </p>
<p>(They snap a couple of photos. Nick adjusts the image on the monitor.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, yeah, the UV light's definitely bringing out the bruises underneath the skin.</p>
<p>(He enhances and sharpens the image. It becomes clear what it looks like.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: That looks like a tire mark.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Maybe our gas explosion just turned into a hit-and-run.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[MONITOR: TIRE MARKS]</p>
<p>(The tire image taken from the body split-screens on the monitor next to a tire.) </p>
<p>[INT. CSI - LAB - DAY]</p>
<p>(Nick stands at the computer trying to find a match to the treadmark.) </p>
<p>(He finds the match and pulls up the tire information:<br />

[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Brass interviews Amber Durgee.) </p>
<p><strong>Amber Durgee</strong>: Well, Robert said that he was going to be working late. So I went to midnight bingo.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Alone?</p>
<p><strong>Amber Durgee</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Alone?</p>
<p><strong>Amber Durgee</strong>: I was ... with a friend.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What was your friend's name?</p>
<p><strong>Amber Durgee</strong>: Why?</p>
<p>(Brass offers her a tissue. She takes one.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>Amber Durgee</strong>: He's married.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Looks like the only person in this thing who isn't married is the dead girl in the trailer with your husband.</p>
<p>(Amber looks at Brass, surprised to hear this.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You didn't know he was having an affair?</p>
<p><strong>Amber Durgee</strong>: (shakes her head) No, I had no idea.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You have a '96 blue Ford Ranger. We're going to need to take a look at it.</p>
<p><strong>Amber Durgee</strong>: But my truck is in New Mexico. My brother borrowed it this morning, he, uh ...</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: A wild guess: You have no idea how to reach him.</p>
<p><strong>Amber Durgee</strong>: Not until he gets back. Why do you need to see my truck?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Let me tell you a story. Once upon a time, you follow your husband to a trailer park. You see him slumming with his little trailer bunny. You waited for him to come out ... </p>
<p>(Quick flash to: [TRAILER PARK - NIGHT] The trailer door opens and Robert Durgee steps out of the trailer. Amber sits inside her car watching him. He lights his cigarette. Suddenly, carlights glare and the tires screech as the car surges toward him. He turns to look.)</p>
<p>(End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: When she pulls the body back in, before she can call for help, you torch the place. Kaboom. </p>
<p>(Quick flash of: The trailer explodes. End of flash.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The end.</p>
<p><strong>Amber Durgee</strong>: That is the craziest thing I've ever heard.</p>
<p>(Brass chuckles.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Wouldn't even make my top ten.</p>

<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Brass and Grissom walk through the hallway.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So that's when the bereaved Mrs. Durgee lawyered up. Broadcast out on her truck, and the warrant's ready to go.</p>
<p>(They stop walking. Grissom looks up and sees Sofia Curtis handing a suspect off to an officer.) </p>
<p><strong>Suspect</strong>: I didn't do it.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: (to the officer) I don't care what he says. Put him in the tank and see if he wises up. Sure as hell can't get any dumber.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (calls out) Detective Curtis.</p>
<p>(Sofia walks over to Grissom and Brass.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Grissom.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I thought you were supposed to be arresting people in Boulder City.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Well, a spot opened up here and ... I transferred in today.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Surprise.</p>
<p>(Brass turns and leaves. Sofia and Grissom smile at each other.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, your mother would be proud.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: My mother made captain. You know, I'd just qualified for my shield when the sheriff pulled my papers and &quot;volunteered&quot; me to CSI. I think my mom hated that more than I did.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You won't miss the lab, will you?</p>

<p>(She snaps photos of the body.)</p>
<p>(Catherine removes the rubber boots from the victim's feet. She finds lettering on the side of the boots: S &amp; S. She also finds initials on the back: EV.) </p>

<p>CUT TO:<br />

<p>(Catherine is on the computer looking up a website: City of Las Vegas. The page is about &quot;Streets and Sanitation Maintenance&quot;.) </p>

<p>(Warrick walks into the office.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So, Vartann and I struck out on g-string row.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You poor guys.</p>

<p>(Quick flashback to: [NIGHT] The woman wearing a plastic bag runs along the sidewalk in her bare feet. Eddie gives her his boots.) </p>

<p>(He motions toward Catherine. She rolls her eyes.) </p>
<p><strong>Vartann</strong>: Listen, did she tell you her name, or, uh, how she ended up there, anything?</p>
<p><strong>Eddie Vonner</strong>: She looked kind of embarrassed, so I didn't push it. So, I just ... I dropped her off down at, uh, Western and Industrial. Never left my route. Why, did she, uh ... ? She say anything about me?</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: With a tire mark on it?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: There is blue paint on this gas main. Didn't mean anything at the time. Amber has a blue Ford Ranger, right?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What if Amber follows her husband to the trailer, sees him go inside, totally freaks out. Why wait for him to come out?</p>
<p>(Quick flashes of: [INSIDE TRAILER] Robert and Selena are in bed.)</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It's too bad we don't have her truck. We could match this to her tires.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, '96 f Ford Ranger, stock paint. (Nick picks up the pipe with the blue paint on it.) Maybe I can match the transfer to this.</p>
<p>(Sara looks around.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'm starving. There's a unit going out for sandwiches. Would you like me to get you something?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No, no, you go ahead. I'm gonna ... (He looks around, his mind preoccupied.) I'm gonna work on this.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You're not going to get far in that direction.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: I know. What about prints?</p>
<p>(Sara hands the file to Sofia.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: 13 different IDs. Some off work cards, some off felonies ranging from assault, B&amp;E, cocaine trafficking.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Well, even if I do manage to track them all down, there's no guarantee any of these were involved with the vics.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, they didn't put themselves in the trunk, and unless they were shot right there at the curb, somebody drove the car there. You're the detective.<br />
(smiles) Go detect.</p>
<p>(Sara leaves.)</p>

[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Robbins prods through the skeletal remains as he shares his findings with Sara and Greg.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Fully developed skeletal structure consistent with an adult male. The medial end of the clavicle's almost fused. Suggests he's about 25 years old. Lack of prognathism indicates he's Caucasian. The female, however, is Prognathic ... (He moves to the second body.) ... and that suggests Negroid. Unfused epiphysial ends make her a teenager.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: White male, younger black female ... racially motivated?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Could be a Son of Sam thing. Summertime, couple on a date, making out in the car. Berkowitz used a .44.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Gunshot wounds are most likely COD for both. Female shows an entry wound at the rear of the skull. Exit wound took off most of her face.</p>
<p>(Robbins moves back to the first body.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Male has no exit wound, but the entry wound ... is pretty obvious.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: [MOUTH POV] The gun fires through the partially opened mouth. End of flash.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Bullet never left the skull.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (nods) That would explain the bullet fragments. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What we need are IDs.</p>

<p>(Sofia talks with Mr. James as he puts the things they requested on the desk in front of her.) </p>
<p><strong>Mr. James</strong>: I also brought her toothbrush and her hairbrush. (He takes out some files.) This one's from her doctor. Other's from her dentist.</p>
<p>(Sofia's looking at a framed photo of Clara James.) </p>
<p><strong>Mr. James</strong>: How long is it going to take you?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: That's hard to say. Mr. James, was Clara by any chance seeing an older man?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. James</strong>: As far as I know, she wasn't seeing anybody but it wouldn't surprise me if she was. Clara wasn't smart when it came to people, talking to any lowlife chump who'd give her the time of day. The girl never did listen to a damn word I said.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: The older man ... Um ... could've been someone she met at school?</p>
<p>(He shakes his head, no.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Did she have a part-time job?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. James</strong>: Gooeybunz, over on El Dorado.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: We found a number of half-eaten Gooeybunz in the car.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. James</strong>: You know, Clara wasn't really that smart about her diet either, but she hated those things. Smell'd get into her clothes. By the time she got home, she was practically ready to throw up. You find out who did this ... you let me know.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Sara takes out the bun parts from the plastic bag.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: According to Clara James' father, Clara didn't eat Gooeybunz. She didn't like them, which means it was either the killer or the male DB. </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: So we're looking for ... bite marks? If we find a good impression, maybe we'll get an ID through dental records.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: And the student becomes a master.</p>
<p>(Sara looks at Greg. He smiles at her.) </p>
<p>(Together, they search through the bun parts.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I'm not seeing any bite marks.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Me either. It's not like they were bitten at all. More like torn apart.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Check it out. They might all be in pieces ... but they're all still here. No one ever ate any of them. Which is kinda weird. I mean, why buy all of 'em and not eat 'em?</p>
<p>(She looks at the whole bun in the bag.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I found this one under a passenger seat -- intact, on the floor.</p>
<p>(She takes it out of the bag and examines it.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: It escaped the carnage.</p>
<p>(She sees something and pulls out a small plastic bag of drugs.) </p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: When she parks her car, she's a hot housewife. A few hours later, she's just another freak.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: Brooke Harris hands the car keys to the attendant.) </p>
<p><strong>Brooke Harris</strong>: Hello. Thank you.</p>
<p>(She walks away.) </p>

<p><strong>Brooke Harris</strong>: It's my Mercedes, okay? I can prove it. Just give me the keys. </p>
<p><strong>Attendant</strong>: Show me ten bucks or you ain't proving squat.</p>
<p><strong>Brooke Harris</strong>: I don't have anywhere to go!</p>
<p>(End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Brooke Harris probably spent ten bucks a day on nonfat lattes.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: She needed money to get her car back.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, I don't see any ATMs around here. This is a bad place to be broke.</p>
<p>(They walk up to the officer.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer DA Michaels</strong>: Hey, you miss me?</p>
<p>(Warrick looks at the rust on the metal pole holding the crime scene tape up.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Rusty flakes. </p>
<p>(He touches the rust on the pole and looks up at the officer.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey, Michaels, did you put this crime tape up?</p>
<p><strong>Officer DA Michaels</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p>(Warrick also sees the blood on the pole.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, well, you missed something. There's blood on this rebar.</p>

<p>(Sara glances at Greg.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Joey Zack, drug dealer. Seems he liked to use Gooeybunz to move his coke.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: Close-up of: Someone cuts out the middle of the bun and pops a bag of coke inside before covering it up again. End of flash.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: He's a nice regular customer at Gooeybunz. He used to chat up cute Clara when he was there, sweet-talks her into a date, and they both end up dead in his bitchin' Grand Am.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, whoever did it must've done it for the drugs.</p>
<p>(Hodges enters the lab and hands Sara the report. She looks through it. Greg notes the comments on the monitor. ) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: GCMs on the melted gloves from your Grand Am. A delicious confection of sugar, gelatin, starches, citric acid, mineral oil, red 40, yellow 5, blue 1 and carnuba wax.</p>
<p>(Greg turns and leaves the lab.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Candy.</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Gummy candy. I'm partial to Jujubes myself. Is it something I said?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (smiles) Probably.</p>
<p>(Greg returns carrying the radio.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Joey Zack's print was found on the radio, which was tuned to 107 FM.<br />
(Greg turns the radio on.) Now, as far as I know, there is only one place in town where you can get gummies, a generic cheeseburger, and 107.1 gets anything other than static.</p>

<p><strong>Drive-in Manager</strong>: (groans) Oh, come on, please. Is that really necessary?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: It's a homicide investigation.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: We could just call the health inspector and ... see how many code violations he has festering in that concession stand.</p>
<p><strong>Drive-in Manager</strong>: Geez, fine, knock yourselves out. Jerry's on tickets ... Maddox runs the projector, and Darryl's in concessions. No. No, he quit last week.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: His prints were on the steering wheel of the Grand Am.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: When he quit his job at the drive-in, he was in court-ordered rehab.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: We figured Blakeney was one of Joey Zack's customers. One night, Blakeney sees his coke dealer's Grand Am at the drive-in, and the fiend snaps.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Do we know where he killed them?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: We don't know where yet.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Or why.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Maybe the girl started freaking out; maybe Blakeney's just a psycho. Anyway, uh, Blakeney tossed the bodies, and throws them in the trunk and drives home. The street where the Grand Am was found is a block away from his last known residence.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: He leaves it there collecting parking tickets, skips town, and uses the same gun two days later in another drug-related crime in Mesquite.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: The scumbag's still in the wind.</p>

<p><strong>Archie</strong>: How'd you know it was going to be there?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: If that &quot;okay&quot; had been meant for Nick, it wouldn't have been in the form of a question. I think maybe Walter Gordon had an accomplice.</p>

<p><strong>Voice 2</strong>: (from recording) Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Male or female?</p>
<p><strong>Archie Johnson</strong>: It's, um ... hard to say. The tape was pretty mangled. Enhancement and noise cancellation increase intelligibility, but it alters timber and tone. So, I don't know there's any more I can do here. You know, Nick recorded a message on the flip side of the tape. You think maybe we should ...</p>

 WOMAN: We need your help!


 
Catherine: Warrick, why don't you and I take the perimeter and work our way in.
Warrick: All right.  Greg, you're with us.
Greg: I'll start the sketch.
 
Wilcox: How you doing, Nick?
Nick:  Above ground, Wilcox.
 
Sara: Would you like inside or out?
Nick: I'll take in.
 
Brass: We got two victims. We think the girl is Selena March. She owns the trailer.
 
Grissom: What about the male?
Brass: Nothing yet.
Nick: This is a piece of the roof right here -- fiberglass and particle board. These things weren't built to last.
Grissom: They were built to burn.
Nick: This place is totaled. The bed's collapsed.
Officer Metcalf: My money's on meth lab.
Sara: You know, Metcalf, just because somebody lives in a trailer park, doesn't mean they're a meth cook.
Officer Metcalf: You guys are a real pain in the ass, you know that?
 
Grissom: Get used to it, pal.
FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS




 
Brass: I'm just having a little trouble understanding this because you all live so close together. You mean none of you saw the explosion?
 
Randy Swansinger: Uh, I heard it.
Brass: Well, good.
Randy Swansinger: When I came out about five minutes later, the whole place was burnin' up.
Brass: Where do you live?
Randy Swansinger:  Right over there.
 
Brass: Uh-huh.  All right, let me get this straight -- you heard a blast like that coming from your neighbor's and it took you five minutes to poke your head out and see what was going on?
Randy Swansinger: I was watching TV.
 
Nosy Lady: I'm sure he was drinking.
 
Brass: No, hang around, hang around. Hey, hang around.
Woman: Did you find a man in Selena's trailer?
Brass: Now why would you ask that? Was Selena a hooker?
Woman: I'm sure I don't know. But one thing I do know, that's not Selena's car.



 
Catherine: Yeah?
Grissom:  Catherine, we have a 4-19 off Industrial. Would you like to handle it?
Catherine:  So you get the team back together only to break us apart again. What kind of a perverse game are you playing here, Gil?
Grissom:  I'm not a pervert.
Catherine:  Yeah, I'll cover it. I'm taking Warrick.



 
 
Officer DA Michaels: Oh, hey, guys. Good to see you. Hey, would you tell Nick I hope there's no hard feelings about that whole, you know, abduction thing. He hasn't returned my calls.
Warrick: He's been busy.
Vartann: Squad car found her about a half hour ago -- no ID, but there's a lot of homeless in this area.
 
Vartann: Looks like somebody took something to her head.
Warrick: Yeah.
Vartann: Didn't find a weapon, but my guys are still looking.
(The woman is wearing a shopping bag with the following printed on top in red:
BONANZA
WORLD'S LARGEST GIFT SHOP

Sahara &amp; the Strip
Las Vegas, Nevada
Catherine: A shopping bag for a shirt, rubber boots and a g-string. Homeless stripper?
Warrick: Well, this is g-string row, isn't it?
 
Catherine: Why is there a ring on your ring finger?
Warrick: Because I'm married.
Catherine: What?
 
Vartann:  Congratulations. How much did you pay her? 
 
Vartann: No, seriously, good luck with that, man. I didn't even know you had a girlfriend.
Warrick: Oh, yeah, it's a girl I've been dating a couple months--Tina.
Catherine: How long have you been married?
Warrick: Since yesterday. Did this, uh, drive-through wedding at Circus Circus Way, you know. Fun, yeah, we, uh ... fun time.

David Phillips: Hey. Sorry I'm late. Busy night.
 
Warrick: We need a TOD, David.
David Phillips: Rigor's barely set, so not long--under four hours.
Catherine: About as long as Warrick's been married.
David Phillips: You're married? Congratulations.
Warrick: Thanks. Do you think she was dumped?
David Phillips: Lividity is consistent with the position of the body. So it's highly unlikely.
Vartann: All right. I'll check out the strip clubs.
Warrick: I'll go with you.

 

 
Nick: Well, there doesn't seem to be any drug-manufacturing supplies, but plenty of ignition sources: a hot plate, fondue pot, gas stove, candles. One leaky pipe's all it takes.
 
Nick: Which I haven't found yet.
 
Grissom: Yeah, but even if you had, that would only explain the explosion in here, not the ruptured gas main outside.
 
Sara: Think I can help you with that. I found this gas meter over by the main. Trailer blows, this thing becomes a missile.
 
 
Sara: One explosion leads to another.
Grissom: Yeah, but where did it all start?

 
 
Greg: Brass ran the plates on that Acura near the trailer. It's registered to a Robert Durgee.
Grissom: You get his photo from the DMV?
Greg: Confirmed as the vic -- Henderson address, mortgage broker. Wife's name was on the insurance card.
Grissom: She coming in?
Greg: She wasn't home. Brass is tracking her down.
 
Judy Tremont: Excuse me, Mr. Grissom ...  An officer brought this in off a call from Flora Nevada Nursery. They thought it might have something to do with the Walter Gordon case.
 

 
 
Robbins: Female's lungs were filled with soot. COD is smoke inhalation. 
Nick: Okay, that means the natural gas didn't suffocate her. Explosion probably knocked her out before the fire even started.
Robbins: Yeah, male didn't even last that long. His lungs were clean, but he suffered fatal crushing injuries to his abdomen. 
Grissom: The pieces of debris that were on this guy's body were not heavy. But the bed he was lying in collapsed.
Nick: Explosion could've done that.
 
Grissom: Let's photo-enhance these bruises.
 
 
Nick: Yeah, yeah, the UV light's definitely bringing out the bruises underneath the skin.
 
Nick: That looks like a tire mark.
Grissom: Maybe our gas explosion just turned into a hit-and-run.

Amber Durgee: Well, Robert said that he was going to be working late. So I went to midnight bingo.
Brass: Alone?
Amber Durgee: Excuse me?
Brass: Alone?
Amber Durgee: I was ... with a friend.
Brass: What was your friend's name?
Amber Durgee: Why?
 
Brass: Why not?
Amber Durgee: He's married.
Brass: Looks like the only person in this thing who isn't married is the dead girl in the trailer with your husband.
 
Brass: You didn't know he was having an affair?
Amber Durgee:  No, I had no idea.
Brass: You have a '96 blue Ford Ranger. We're going to need to take a look at it.
Amber Durgee: But my truck is in New Mexico. My brother borrowed it this morning, he, uh ...
Brass: A wild guess: You have no idea how to reach him.
Amber Durgee: Not until he gets back. Why do you need to see my truck?
Brass: Let me tell you a story. Once upon a time, you follow your husband to a trailer park. You see him slumming with his little trailer bunny. You waited for him to come out ... 

 
Brass: When she pulls the body back in, before she can call for help, you torch the place. Kaboom. 
 
Brass: The end.
Amber Durgee: That is the craziest thing I've ever heard.

Brass: Wouldn't even make my top ten.
FADE OUT



 
 
Brass: So that's when the bereaved Mrs. Durgee lawyered up. Broadcast out on her truck, and the warrant's ready to go.
 
Suspect: I didn't do it.
Sofia Curtis:  I don't care what he says. Put him in the tank and see if he wises up. Sure as hell can't get any dumber.
Grissom:  Detective Curtis.
 
Sofia Curtis: Grissom.
Grissom: I thought you were supposed to be arresting people in Boulder City.
Sofia Curtis: Well, a spot opened up here and ... I transferred in today.
Brass: Surprise.
 
Grissom: Well, your mother would be proud.
Sofia Curtis: My mother made captain. You know, I'd just qualified for my shield when the sheriff pulled my papers and &quot;volunteered&quot; me to CSI. I think my mom hated that more than I did.
Grissom: You won't miss the lab, will you?
Sofia Curtis:  There's some things I'll miss. I'll see you around.


 
 


 


 
 

 
Warrick: So, Vartann and I struck out on g-string row.
Catherine: You poor guys.
 
Warrick: Yeah, right. You know what I mean. No one recognized the victim's picture. Listen, Cath, about this whole marriage thing ...
Catherine: Yeah, that. Yeah, that kind of threw me for a loop. Tina, right?
Warrick: Yeah.
Catherine: She must be a very special woman. I look forward to meeting her.
Warrick: Yes, she is ...
 
Catherine:  The vic's blood-alcohol level was .16 and COD was blunt-force trauma.
 
Warrick: Smashed and then smashed, huh?
Catherine: Mm-hmm.
Warrick: Any luck on the, uh ... victim's prints?
Catherine: No work card; no record. But the rubber boots were standard issue: Streets and Sanitation.
 
Warrick: &quot;E.V.&quot;?
Catherine: Yeah, there's three S&amp;S workers with those initials and ... 
(The information appears on the monitor:
NAME: VONNER, EDDIE
ADDRESS: 288 TYLER RD.
HENDERSON, NV 89109
Catherine: ... it looks like an Eddie Vonner was on duty last night.

 
 
Eddie Vonner: Why would you want to see my boots?
Vartann: You tell us.
Eddie Vonner: Look, I know it's against the regs to pick up anything other than trash, but, I mean, come on.
 
Eddie Vonner:  She was barefoot; she was stepping on glass and crap, so, yeah, I gave her my boots.
 
Eddie Vonner: And she practically begged, so, I gave her a lift.
Vartann: So, you're just a good Samaritan.
Eddie Vonner: Oh, come on, it was pretty obvious she didn't belong there.
Catherine: Where?
Eddie Vonner: Jefferson and K? You ever see the citizens that hang out in that neighborhood?
Catherine: When I see them, they're usually dead.
Eddie Vonner: Well, there you go. I mean, come on, she ... I could tell, despite the ... well, the get-up, she was hot. And, I mean, I'm not talking like garbage truck hot. I mean, she was like ... like limo hot.
 
Vartann: Listen, did she tell you her name, or, uh, how she ended up there, anything?
Eddie Vonner: She looked kind of embarrassed, so I didn't push it. So, I just ... I dropped her off down at, uh, Western and Industrial. Never left my route. Why, did she, uh ... ? She say anything about me?
Catherine: She died a few blocks from where you dropped her off.

 
 
Sara: If the wife torched the trailer and caused the explosion, you would expect to see small debris embedded all over the inside of these walls. There's nothing here.
 
Nick: Hey, hey ... Sara. Check this out. This is a piece of the exterior wall facing the road.
Sara: With a tire mark on it?
Nick: Yeah.
Sara: There is blue paint on this gas main. Didn't mean anything at the time. Amber has a blue Ford Ranger, right?
Nick: Uh-huh.
Sara: What if Amber follows her husband to the trailer, sees him go inside, totally freaks out. Why wait for him to come out?


 
Nick: Yeah. Yeah, just come straight through. Run him over in bed with another chick.
Sara: Trailer collapses, fire breaks out, sweeps through, and destroys practically all evidence of a collision.
Nick: Yeah.
Sara: It's too bad we don't have her truck. We could match this to her tires.
Nick: Well, '96 f Ford Ranger, stock paint.  Maybe I can match the transfer to this.
 
Sara: I'm starving. There's a unit going out for sandwiches. Would you like me to get you something?
Nick: No, no, you go ahead. I'm gonna ...  I'm gonna work on this.
 
 

 



 
Vartann: According to the garbage man, she ran up from this direction.
Warrick: Yeah?
Vartann: Must be where she got the bag.
Warrick: Hmm.
 
Vartann: Victim wasn't carrying a cell phone. She's in the wrong part of town in her underwear, scared out of her head. She's gonna call her man, her family, someone.
Warrick: And she didn't have a quarter, so she called 911. I'll print the phones.
Vartann: I'll dump the call records.
 
Warrick: Let's get the traffic cameras, too.


 
 
Hodges: The, uh, treadmark on your trailer wall is consistent with Michelin
195/70/r14s.
Grissom: What about the blue paint scrapings we found on the gas main?
Hodges: You got a real thing for blue paint. You know that? But, uh, this isn't from a Ford Ranger, or any Ford for that matter. It's a GMC paint.
(He shows Grissom the report with the following:
BLUE COLORED PAINT SCRAPINGS RECOVERED
FROM EVIDENCE ITEM #7166 IS CONSISTENT
WITH GMC PRODUCTS )
Nick: Amber Durgee was cheating on her husband, maybe even wanted him dead, but her truck didn't have anything to do with it.
Grissom: Right tires, wrong vehicle.
Nick:  Mm.

 
 
 
Nick: Found something?
Grissom: Part of a headlamp, maybe.
Nick: Well, I found some blue paint transfer on that chain-link fence. As far as tracks go, this place is a parking lot, man. They're everywhere.
Grissom: Except between the gas main and the trailer.
Nick: So, the trailer wasn't rammed?
Grissom: I think we're looking at the, uh, vehicular equivalent of a through-and-through. Car comes down the road.
 
Grissom:  Gas main acts as a ramp.
 
 
Nick: Flying car.  That's what we're gonna go with?
(Grissom turns and looks at Nick just as Nick looks away.
Nick: mm-hmm. Okay.



;



 
 
Nick: The partial OEM number on the headlamp piece belongs to a '97 Pontiac Sunfire.
Brass: Boy, that was quick.
Nick: Well, GMC paint -- tire model wasn't that tough.
Brass: I'll put out another broadcast.
Nick: All right.


 
 
 
Sofia Curtis: Your broadcast was for a blue Pontiac. Patrol figured this was worth a look.
Grissom: How bad does a smell have to get before Parking Control calls Homicide?
 
Sara: No way this car was at the trailer park. Think we've got a new case. First citation was issued five days ago. Car's probably been here at least six.
 
Sofia Curtis: Six days in the summer heat.

Grissom:  And a trunk becomes a crockpot.
Sara: Looks like a male and a female.
 
Grissom: That could be an entry wound in her skull.
Sofia Curtis: Well, if she was shot in there, there might be bullets and casing. I say we process the car in place. Let's get rolling.
Sara: Area is uncontrolled. Evidence can be contaminated or lost. We need to get this back to the lab.
Grissom: Car condom.


 


 
 
Walter Gordon:  Hi, CSI guy. You're wondering why you're here? Because you followed the evidence.
(Warrick walks into the lab
Warrick: Archie? 
 
Warrick: Archie? Do you have anything on pay phone dump?
Archie Johnson: Oh. Yeah.
 
Archie Johnson: The 911 call about five minutes before your garbage man picked up the vic. Then I matched time codes with the video from the traffic cam. Synched up the audio.
 
 
Operator:  911. What is your emergency?
Woman 1 : ... pick me up.
Warrick: Whoa!
Operator:  Ma'am, just calm down.
Warrick: That's our girl.
Operator:  Will you tell me your location?
Woman 1 :  No. I don't know where I am, okay?! 
Operator:  If you'll just calm down and tell me where you are.
Woman 1 :  I don't know where I am. I'm just ...
 
Woman 2: :  Please, please ...
Archie Johnson: Someone's getting territorial.
Warrick: I'll put Vartann on it.
Woman 2: :  Okay, fine. You can have this phone!
(The second woman chases the first woman out of camera frame. The first woman leaves. 
Warrick: Vic loses her shoes. Explains the boots. Let see where she came from. Rewind it a little bit, would you?
Archie Johnson: Yeah.
 
Warrick: Oh. Stop. Hold it. That looks like an airport shuttle. There's a logo on this side. 
Archie Johnson: Yeah. I can enhance that.
(He enhances the logo and sees:
EXCLUSIVE
SEDAN SERVICE )
Archie Johnson: That's a limo?
Warrick: This is Vegas. It's a strip bar on wheels.

 
 
Limo Driver: I don't even pay attention to the talent. I just drive down Industrial Boulevard, from strip club to strip club, picking 'em up. It's like bus stops. Before you know it, we're full, the bus is on fire ...
 
Limo Driver: We call it the &quot;champagne ride.&quot;
Vartann: Oh, yeah? 
Limo Driver: It's nice.
Vartann: So what do the girls get paid for this?
Limo Driver: The girls, they make uh ... at least twice as much as they do in the clubs, so ... 
Catherine: Depending on what else they ride.
Limo Driver: Oh ... 
(Inside the limo, Warrick finds a cell phone. He checks the calls and finds them all made by &quot;GISELLE&quot;. He finds a small wallet and takes out a Nevada driver's license for:

Catherine: It's a pretty sweet deal for the guys. Hot chicks getting trashed with no security and nowhere to go. 
 
Catherine: And what happens when the girls want to get off?
Limo Driver: Usually, it's the guys that are getting off.
Warrick: I found something in there besides body fluids. Belongs to the victim, Brooke Harris. You dropped that girl off in a war zone, man.
Limo Driver: When the guy paying the tab says he wants to stop, I just stop.
 
PAYING CUSTOMER: Come on ...
Brooke Harris: You know, you've got to sit down and ... 
PAYING CUSTOMER: Come on ... 
Brooke Harris: Stop it! Back off, jerk!
PAYING CUSTOMER: Stop the bus! Get her off the bus!
Brooke Harris: No, I don't want ... I don't want to get ...
 
Limo Driver: Look, strippers are tough chicks, okay? I figured she'd find a way home, one way or another.

 
 
Catherine: Brooke Harris was getting calls from a gym?
Vartann: Well, the &quot;Giselle&quot; number went straight to voice mail. The voice mail said to contact her here.
 
Catherine: And what's the word on the husband?
Vartann: Huh?
Catherine: The husband.
Vartann: Yeah ... no, according to his office, he's away in Laughlin on business. We're still trying to get in touch with him.
 
Instructor: ... swing those legs up and around. Yeah, like a waterfall ... you got it. That's it! 

 
Giselle: So I called Brooke a few times. So what? She was one of my students.
Vartann: You actually teach this?
Giselle: Strippers have the best bodies in town. If you want the body, this is how you get it. Trust me, I've been doing this since before I had my driver's license.
Catherine: Well, workout is one thing. What is a housewife from Centennial Park doing on a stripper bus with pros?
Giselle: She wanted it.
Vartann: Come on ...
Giselle: No, really. She loved the attention. Loved the fantasy. She wanted to try it for real. See how she stacked up against some real talent.
Catherine: And you let her.
Giselle: Do I look like her mother?
Catherine: You were teaching her a lesson.
Giselle: If I'd wanted to do that, I would've sent her to Stripperama, fed her to the wolves.
Catherine: And drunk CEOs aren't wolves? They're worse. You know that. That's why you kept calling her. So you could hear all about it, right?
Giselle: I was just calling to see how things went.
Vartann: Oh, really?
Giselle: It's starting to sound like I need a lawyer.

 
 
Brass: So I pulled all the ROs from all the '97 blue Sunfires in Nevada; one name and address just jumped out ...
 
Brass:  Randy Swansiger. Las Vegas police! Come on out, Randy.
 
Brass: Walk out slowly, Randy.
Nick: Michelin tires.
Grissom: Blue car. Broken headlamp.
Randy Swansinger: Hey, how's it goin'?
Brass: I'm Detective Jim Brass. Remember me?
Randy Swansinger: Hey, hey, hey, hey ... whoa, whoa ... what are you guys doing?
Brass: You got a couple of DWIs on your record. What have you got to say for yourself, Randy?
Randy Swansinger: I was coming home ... been working late ... I guess I fell asleep at the wheel ...
 
Randy Swansinger: Next thing I know ... crash-boom-bang! The car still worked, so ... 
 
 

 
 
Sara: Drain plug's probably under the carpet.
Greg: I think I found it.
 
Greg: Ahh ... 
Sara:  Technically, that makes you a cannibal.
 
Sara: Grissom would be proud.
Greg: Grissom would've tasted it on purpose.
 
Sara: It's working.

 
 
 
 
 
 

 
 
Sara: That makes 34 prints. Jacqui's going to love me.
 
Sara: You got something?
Greg: I think so ... bullet fragment. Copper-jacketed. Rules out a .22.
Sara: See, it was worth it.

 
 
David Hodges: You better get ready for this because this is going to blow you away. The rust-colored material you found on the victim's head wound ... was rust. Plain old ferric oxide, found on nearly every iron object on the planet earth. Case breaker? No? As they say, &quot;garbage in, garbage out.&quot;
 
Catherine: Um ... the champagne ride picks up strippers near the clubs, but not actually at the clubs.
Warrick: Right. The owners don't like that bus coming anywhere near the clubs because they don't make any money off them.
Catherine: Well, look, Brooke Harris wasn't planning to die that night. She had to have parked her car somewhere.
Warrick: Well, there's a secured parking lot not too far from where the garbage man dropped her off.
 
Catherine: So, if she parked her car here ... why did she go here?
 
Warrick: Hey, Catherine ...
Catherine: Yes?
Warrick: Can we talk?  About this?
Catherine: Sure.
Warrick: You know, what happened to Nick ... it just got me thinking. Life is so short, you know? It's almost ... it's almost shorter than we want to ever believe.
Catherine: Live for the day.
Warrick: Exactly. So, I, uh ... I've been heading to ask this young lady I've been seeing--Tina--to marry me.
Catherine: You know that I'm happy for you.
Warrick: Yeah?
Catherine: Yeah.
Warrick: But it also feels like you're not so happy for me.
Catherine: Warrick ... you know, the thing that makes a fantasy great is the possibility that it might come true. And when you lose that possibility ... it just kind of sucks.

 
 
Bobby Dawson: Okay, Mr. Greg, your most likely match is a .44 round recovered from a drug-related shoot-out in Mesquite five days ago. Case is still open.
Greg: That's roughly two days after the bodies ended up in the trunk. Maybe our vics were the beginning of a little crime spree. Thanks.
 
Sofia Curtis: I ran the Grand Am's VIN. Last RO was a tow yard over by Nellis. Vehicle's most likely an impound, sold under the table to some scammer who faked his tags.
Sara: You're not going to get far in that direction.
Sofia Curtis: I know. What about prints?
 
Sara: 13 different IDs. Some off work cards, some off felonies ranging from assault, B&amp;E, cocaine trafficking.
Sofia Curtis: Well, even if I do manage to track them all down, there's no guarantee any of these were involved with the vics.
Sara: Well, they didn't put themselves in the trunk, and unless they were shot right there at the curb, somebody drove the car there. You're the detective.
 Go detect.


 
 
Robbins: Fully developed skeletal structure consistent with an adult male. The medial end of the clavicle's almost fused. Suggests he's about 25 years old. Lack of prognathism indicates he's Caucasian. The female, however, is Prognathic ...  ... and that suggests Negroid. Unfused epiphysial ends make her a teenager.
Sara: White male, younger black female ... racially motivated?
Greg: Could be a Son of Sam thing. Summertime, couple on a date, making out in the car. Berkowitz used a .44.
Robbins: Gunshot wounds are most likely COD for both. Female shows an entry wound at the rear of the skull. Exit wound took off most of her face.
 
Robbins: Male has no exit wound, but the entry wound ... is pretty obvious.

Robbins: Bullet never left the skull.
Greg:  That would explain the bullet fragments. 
Sara: What we need are IDs.

 
 
Greg: No missing persons filed for Caucasian males between 20 and 30 in the last two weeks, but there are possibles for the girl.
Sara: Hm.

Mr. James: I also brought her toothbrush and her hairbrush.  This one's from her doctor. Other's from her dentist.
 
Mr. James: How long is it going to take you?
Sofia Curtis: That's hard to say. Mr. James, was Clara by any chance seeing an older man?
Mr. James: As far as I know, she wasn't seeing anybody but it wouldn't surprise me if she was. Clara wasn't smart when it came to people, talking to any lowlife chump who'd give her the time of day. The girl never did listen to a damn word I said.
Sofia Curtis: The older man ... Um ... could've been someone she met at school?
 
Sofia Curtis: Did she have a part-time job?
Mr. James: Gooeybunz, over on El Dorado.
Sofia Curtis: We found a number of half-eaten Gooeybunz in the car.
Mr. James: You know, Clara wasn't really that smart about her diet either, but she hated those things. Smell'd get into her clothes. By the time she got home, she was practically ready to throw up. You find out who did this ... you let me know.
Sofia Curtis: Yeah.

 
 
Sara: According to Clara James' father, Clara didn't eat Gooeybunz. She didn't like them, which means it was either the killer or the male DB. 
Greg: So we're looking for ... bite marks? If we find a good impression, maybe we'll get an ID through dental records.
Sara: You got it.
Greg: And the student becomes a master.
 
 
Greg: I'm not seeing any bite marks.
Sara: Me either. It's not like they were bitten at all. More like torn apart.
Greg: Check it out. They might all be in pieces ... but they're all still here. No one ever ate any of them. Which is kinda weird. I mean, why buy all of 'em and not eat 'em?
 
Sara: I found this one under a passenger seat -- intact, on the floor.
 
Greg: It escaped the carnage.
 
Greg: That's not frosting.
Sara: I always liked the middle part the best.


 
 
Warrick: When she parks her car, she's a hot housewife. A few hours later, she's just another freak.
 
Brooke Harris: Hello. Thank you.
 
 
Brooke Harris: It's my Mercedes, okay? I can prove it. Just give me the keys. 
Attendant: Show me ten bucks or you ain't proving squat.
Brooke Harris: I don't have anywhere to go!
 
Catherine: Brooke Harris probably spent ten bucks a day on nonfat lattes.
Warrick: Right.
Catherine: She needed money to get her car back.
Warrick: Well, I don't see any ATMs around here. This is a bad place to be broke.
 
Officer DA Michaels: Hey, you miss me?
 
Warrick: Rusty flakes. 
 
Warrick: Hey, Michaels, did you put this crime tape up?
Officer DA Michaels: Yes, sir.
 
Warrick: Yeah, well, you missed something. There's blood on this rebar.
Catherine: Where'd you find that?
Officer DA Michaels: I, uh ... I just picked it up over there ...
 
Catherine: May I ask you a question?
 
Catherine: Do you recognize this woman?
Homeless Person: She's a thief. She took some money out of my hat.
(Quick flash of:  Brooke Harris creeps up to the homeless man's hat of money and snatches a handful. She turns and runs.
Homeless Person: Hey! Hey!
 
 
Homeless Person: Stealing's a crime.
Catherine: Hey, Michaels. Think you might be able to take this man into custody?
 


 
 
Sara: Tox confirmed that the packet in the Gooeybun contained cocaine, and one of the prints that I lifted off the Grand Am was a felony conviction for cocaine trafficking - 
(She pulls up the information on the monitor:
JOEY ZACK
DOB: SEPT 5, 1979 AGE: 25
HGT: 5'10&quot; WGT: 180 LBS
HAIR: BROWN EYES: BROWN
RACE: CAUCASIAN s*x: MALE
ADDRESS:
BURTON HOTEL
2321 TOP WAY
LAS VEGAS, NV 89156
CONVICTIONS: Drug dealer, probation 1 year in Mar 2004
NOTES: prints found on stolen car radio tuner
 
Sara: Joey Zack, drug dealer. Seems he liked to use Gooeybunz to move his coke.
 
Sara: He's a nice regular customer at Gooeybunz. He used to chat up cute Clara when he was there, sweet-talks her into a date, and they both end up dead in his bitchin' Grand Am.
Greg: Well, whoever did it must've done it for the drugs.
 
Hodges: GCMs on the melted gloves from your Grand Am. A delicious confection of sugar, gelatin, starches, citric acid, mineral oil, red 40, yellow 5, blue 1 and carnuba wax.
 
Sara: Candy.
Hodges: Gummy candy. I'm partial to Jujubes myself. Is it something I said?
Sara:  Probably.
 
Greg: Joey Zack's print was found on the radio, which was tuned to 107 FM.
 Now, as far as I know, there is only one place in town where you can get gummies, a generic cheeseburger, and 107.1 gets anything other than static.
 

 
(The sign outside reads:
THIS WAY TO THE
MOONLIGHT! TUNE
YOUR RADIO TO
107.1FM FOR SOUND )
Drive-in Manager: Sorry, I don't recognize him. Most of the time when people come here, it's dark.
Greg: How about this? You ever seen this car before?
Drive-in Manager: No. All I remember from the last two weeks is what's playing
'cause I've seen it 8,000 times:&quot;Killer Punch&quot; --a big draw for crap cars.
Sofia Curtis: We're gonna need to talk to your employees.
Drive-in Manager:  Oh, come on, please. Is that really necessary?
Sofia Curtis: It's a homicide investigation.
Greg: We could just call the health inspector and ... see how many code violations he has festering in that concession stand.
Drive-in Manager: Geez, fine, knock yourselves out. Jerry's on tickets ... Maddox runs the projector, and Darryl's in concessions. No. No, he quit last week.
Sofia Curtis: Why?
Drive-in Manager: He said he was gonna go live with his parents up in Mesquite.

 
 
Sofia Curtis: Guy's name is Darryl Blakeney.  Small-time hood with priors for B&amp;E and possession. 
Sara: His prints were on the steering wheel of the Grand Am.
Greg: When he quit his job at the drive-in, he was in court-ordered rehab.
Sofia Curtis: We figured Blakeney was one of Joey Zack's customers. One night, Blakeney sees his coke dealer's Grand Am at the drive-in, and the fiend snaps.
 
Darryl Blakeney: Move, and you're dead! Shut up!
Joey Zack: All right, all right, all right!
Darryl Blakeney: Give me the coke, Joey! Give me the coke!

 
Grissom: Do we know where he killed them?
Greg: We don't know where yet.
Sofia Curtis: Or why.
Sara: Maybe the girl started freaking out; maybe Blakeney's just a psycho. Anyway, uh, Blakeney tossed the bodies, and throws them in the trunk and drives home. The street where the Grand Am was found is a block away from his last known residence.
Greg: He leaves it there collecting parking tickets, skips town, and uses the same gun two days later in another drug-related crime in Mesquite.
Sofia Curtis: The scumbag's still in the wind.
Grissom: At least he's in the system with a double homicide.
Sofia Curtis: That's not going to satisfy Clara James' father.
 

 
 
Nick: Can she cook? Is she a good cook? Come on, Warrick.
 
Nick: Hey, Grissom. We're taking Warrick to the Pepper Mill to celebrate his marriage and to condemn his elopement. You in?
Grissom: Did you invite your wife?
Warrick: I don't think I'm ready to subject her to the crew just yet.
Catherine: I got to beg off, you guys. Got to take Lindsay to school.
Nick: All right.
Catherine: Bye.
 
Nick: Bye. So?
Grissom: I got one more thing to do.
 
Nick: All right.
 
Warrick: Don't.

 
 
Walter Gordon:  So, breathe quick. Breathe slow. Put your gun in your mouth and pull the trigger. Any way you like, you're going to die here. Okay?
Voice 2:  Perfect.

Walter Gordon:  Okay?
Voice 2:  Perfect.
 
Archie: How'd you know it was going to be there?
Grissom: If that &quot;okay&quot; had been meant for Nick, it wouldn't have been in the form of a question. I think maybe Walter Gordon had an accomplice.

Voice 2:  Perfect.
Grissom: Male or female?
Archie Johnson: It's, um ... hard to say. The tape was pretty mangled. Enhancement and noise cancellation increase intelligibility, but it alters timber and tone. So, I don't know there's any more I can do here. You know, Nick recorded a message on the flip side of the tape. You think maybe we should ...
Grissom: No. This is between you and me.

<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Various dissolves of the camera pulling away from the city and into a small town.) </p>
<p>[EXT. MCBRIDE RESIDENCE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Except for a couple of lights on, the house is dark and in a quiet neighborhood. The sound of crickets chirp over the whistling wind.) </p>
<p>(Dissolve to: Camera moves slowly up the front steps toward the front door. There's no sign of movement in the house.) </p>
<p><strong>Cassie McBride</strong>: (V.O.) (hoarse whisper) They came to ... my house.</p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO: </p>
<p>[INT. MCBRIDE RESIDENCE - FOYER - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p><strong>Cassie McBride</strong>: (V.O.) (hoarse whisper) They had a fight.</p>
<p>(In the foyer, we see the large puddle of blood and messy footprints on the floor and on the stairs. There are no bodies.) </p>
<p>FADE TO: </p>
<p>(Camera pans over the items on the desk in disarray.) </p>
<p>(It moves continuously over to the foyer table filled with framed photos of various smiling family members.) </p>
<p>(Camera moves over the photos and across the tossed room to the mantle with more framed photos of various smiling family members.) </p>
<p><strong>Cassie McBride</strong>: (V.O.) (hoarse whisper) They couldn't find what they were looking for.</p>
<p>(Camera swings around and zooms over to the dining table with a plate of food on it and other items in disarray.) </p>
<p>(Camera lingers on more bloodied prints going from one room to another. The camera turns and goes back to the foyer. It lingers on the pool of blood near an abandoned red sneaker.)</p>
<p>(The camera moves up the stairs to the second floor bedroom. We see into the master bedroom. The camera turns and heads over to the little girl's room.) </p>
<p>(Inside, we find Nick standing at the foot of a little girl's heart-framed bed. He stares at the unmade bed. The window above it is open, the light breeze moving the wispy curtains.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. MCBRIDE RESIDENCE - FRONT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Sheriff Brackett stands near the front porch as an officer looks around the grounds.)</p>
<p>(Behind him, the door opens and Nick exits the house to join him.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Sheriff? Who, uh ... who called it in?</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Dennis Brackett</strong>: Anonymous 911.</p>
<p>(Nick nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Dennis Brackett</strong>: Listen, we haven't had a murder in all of Lincoln County in ten years, let alone a quadruple.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Without the bodies, I can't confirm there was a murder.</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Dennis Brackett</strong>: No offense, Mr. Stokes, but did you see the amount of blood in that house? Somebody's dead.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What do you know about the family?</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Dennis Brackett</strong>: Jude McBride -- great guy, stay-at-home dad. Nina owns a local coffee shop. Jeremy's a junior in high school, smart kid. Ten-year-old daughter, Cassie. Pip-squeak.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Sounds like all that's missing is the white picket fence, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Dennis Brackett</strong>: Yeah. We don't even know where to start looking.</p>
<p>(The sheriff looks out at the group of officers combing through the grounds with their flashlights in the dark.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Begin at the beginning.</p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO: END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[INT. MCBRIDE RESIDENCE -- MORNING] </p>
<p>(Various dissolves of individual framed photos of a happy couple and smiling children. In the background, we see Nick.) </p>
<p><strong>Cassie McBride</strong>: (V.O.) (hoarse whisper) I loved my family.</p>
<p>(Final photo is of Cassie McBride.) </p>
<p>(Nick is looking at a particular family photo - Jude McBride has his arm around his wife's shoulders in an easy manner, Jeremy stands next to Cassie making rabbit ears with his fingers on the back of her head. They're all smiling in an easy manner.) </p>
<p>(He continues to look around the room.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. ROAD - DAY]</p>
<p>(An SUV travels along the long road. Sara takes the exit to her right. She continues driving - over a bridge, through a small town.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. MCBRIDE RESIDENCE - KITCHEN -- MORNING] </p>
<p>(Nick is in the kitchen leaning over the counter and looking at the coffee machine.) </p>
<p>(Sara walks in carrying two cups - one of coffee, one with tea. She notes the bloody prints on the floor. We hear the coffee machine perking.) </p>
<p>(She walks into the kitchen.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Are we having a Taster's Choice moment?</p>
<p>(Nick turns and looks at her.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Grissom called me from the airport. He's teaching a human remains recovery class at the body farm. He said you needed backup, and I figure you needed coffee, but ... looks like you already took care of it.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Oh, no. No, I didn't do it. Coffeemaker's programmed to go on Monday through Friday.</p>
<p>(The timer on the coffee maker reads 6:00.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So, somebody cleaned up Friday's coffee and reset it to go off today? </p>
<p>(She looks around the kitchen and sees the place a mess. All the cupboards are open, the drawers are open and some things are on the floor.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You'd have to be alive to do that. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Which means whatever happened here happened over the weekend.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Blood pools are dry, so, crime scene's at least 12 hours old.</p>
<p>[INT. MCBRIDE RESIDENCE - FOYER -- MORNING] </p>
<p>(Nick leads Sara into the main hall.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: There were at least three major blood events -- Here ... here ... and up the stairs. Without the bodies, we'll have to confirm the source of the blood through DNA comparison.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'll collect toothbrushes, hairbrushes ... you know, it's possible it wasn't the family that died here.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: The sheriff confirmed the McBrides' cars are parked out front, and their cell phones, car keys, wallets are all right there.</p>
<p>(Sara turns and looks at the things on the hallway table.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Can't get far without those.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mm.</p>
<p>(Sara turns and looks around.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It would also seem to eliminate robbery as a motive.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(Warrick and Greg walk into the house. Warrick takes it in.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (exhales) What a mess.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: If you're not gonna clean it up ... why take the bodies?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah. Well, I'm gonna start upstairs.</p>
<p>(Warrick heads for the stairs.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I'll take outside.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. MCBRIDE RESIDENCE -- MORNING] </p>
<p>(Greg is on the outside of the house examining the window. He tries to open it, then takes several photos of it.) </p>
<p>[INT. MCBRIDE RESIDENCE -- MORNING] </p>
<p>(Dissolve to: Sara makes her way down the stairs carrying plastic bags with shoes in them. Nick is on the base of the stairs looking through a camera set up on a tripod. He takes several photos of one of the blood pools.) </p>
<p>(Dissolve to: Nick marks the shoe prints with colored circle stickers. He places a yellow sticker next to one of the shoe prints.)</p>
<p>(Several dissolves of Nick continuing to mark the shoe prints throughout the room.) </p>
<p>(Dissolve to: Near the outside doorway, Sara puts a measuring ruler down near a print. She notes it down in her log:<br />
shoeprint size 11.5<br />
multiple prints<br />
shoeprint size 10.5 )</p>
<p>(Dissolve to: Nick swabs some blood on the stairs. He caps the swab tip and puts it in the box.) </p>
<p>(Dissolve to: Sara lifts the shoe print. She looks up and stands up.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Based on their shoes, dad wore a nine-and-a-half, mom wore a nine. Jeremy wore an eight-and-a-half, and Cassie wore a one.</p>
<p>(Nick notes the size of the shoe print he's working on.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: There is that men's nine-and-a-half between blood pool number one and blood pool number two.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: And the barefoot print on the stairs looks smaller.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, they're consistent with the mom, size nine. No matches to Jeremy or Cassie, though.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Let's just assume they were shot. Maybe they were shot first. There's no blood to step in if you're first.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: Cassie opens the door and someone shoots her. End of flash.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Or mom could have grabbed Cassie up, try to take her away from it all.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: Nina McBride grabs Cassie and runs up the stairs.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (V.O.) Bullet penetrated both bodies.</p>
<p>(Someone fires one bullet and hits them both. Nina falls to her knees. End of flash.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Could explain why there are only three blood pools.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: There are three other sets of shoeprints. One size 12, two size 11.</p>
<p>(Nick looks down at the blue-stickered shoe prints on the floor. He also notes the white-stickered shoe prints.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Two of the sets appear to be going back and forth from the kitchen area to the front door. One set, and only one set, headed upstairs for the bedrooms.</p>
<p>(We note the yellow-stickered shoe prints up the stairs.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I'll go up there and see what I can find.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. MCBRIDE RESIDENCE - SECOND FLOOR -- MASTER BEDROOM -- MORNING] </p>
<p>(Warrick opens the bag and takes out a JIMMY BUFFET shirt.) </p>
<p>(Nick makes his way cautiously up the stairs.)</p>
<p>(Warrick opens the bedside table and finds a gun inside. He takes several photos of the drawer's contents.) </p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO: </p>
<p>[EXT. MCBRIDE RESIDENCE -- MORNING] </p>
<p>(Sheriff Brackett's deputies are out in the yard looking around.) </p>
<p>(Greg snaps a couple of photos of a tire print in the dirt.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Sheriff Brackett ... did your deputies drive anything up here with a hitch?</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Dennis Brackett</strong>: No. Why?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I got an odd-sized tread here.</p>
<p>(Greg stands up and looks around the area. He finds some weed. He picks it up, then puts it back down. He looks around and finds some Bubblicious gum near the front walk. He snaps some photos of it.) </p>
<p>[INT. MCBRIDE RESIDENCE -- MORNING] </p>
<p>(Inside, Nick snaps some photos of bloodstains on the carpet. He walks over to the bed and finds some hair strands. He snaps photos of it.) </p>
<p>(He puts it in a bindle.)</p>
<p>(Nick leans down under the bed and finds a plate with half-eaten bread on it, a bottle of cough medicine and a shoe.) </p>
<p>(He shines his light under the bed and visualizes seeing Cassie McBride huddled underneath, scared.) </p>
<p>(He reaches under the bed and takes out the bottle of medicine. He looks at the label.) </p>
<p><strong>Cassie McBride</strong>: (V.O.) (hoarse whisper) I hate the taste of that stuff.</p>
<p>(The label reads:<br />
Cough Syrup<br />
Multi-Symptom Relief<br />
Original Flavor<br />
Relieves: Headache, Aches, Pains, Runny Nose, Sneezing, Cough, Sore Throat, Nasal Congestion, Fever.) </p>
<p>(Nick reaches under the bed and takes out a shoe. Inside the shoe is some green liquid. He smells it, then pours it into a plastic sample container.) </p>
<p>(Cut to: Nick looks around Cassie's room. On the shelf, she has a row of Nancy Drew books.) </p>
<p><strong>Cassie McBride</strong>: (V.O.) (hoarse whisper) I like Nancy Drew. She always gets the bad guy.</p>
<p>(On the shelf below, he sees a toy bubble gum ball dispenser and other things.) </p>
<p>(He looks at the photos pinned to the wall next to the shelf. In one of them, Cassie's in a swimsuit, hair cap and goggles. She's smiling with her coach. He also sees the medal on the wall with a photo of her with her coach.) </p>
<p><strong>Cassie McBride</strong>: (V.O.) (hoarse whisper) I knew all my lines and Hansel's, too.</p>
<p>(Also pinned to the wall is a CHILDREN'S THEATRE program book for HANSEL AND GRETEL. Above it is a photo of Cassie dressed as Gretel standing next to Hansel.) </p>
<p>(Nick smiles.) </p>
<p>(He continues to look at the other photos of Cassie pinned to the wall.) </p>
<p>(Cassie giggles.)</p>
<p>(There's a photo with Cassie blowing a bubble with her gum.) </p>
<p>(Cassie giggles.)</p>
<p>(Nick looks around, confused by something. He steps out of the room and into the hallway.) </p>
<p>(Cassie giggles.)</p>
<p>(Nick walks over to the next room.)</p>
<p>(Cassie giggles.)</p>
<p>(Nick pushes the door open and walks into Jeremy's room. He finds Warrick standing over a keyboard.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p>(Cassie giggles.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: If it's labeled correctly, it's, uh, Cassie's laugh.</p>
<p>(Nick walks over to the keyboard to see an &quot;F&quot; key labeled &quot;CASSIE'S LAUGH&quot;. Warrick presses it and we hear Cassie giggle.) </p>
<p>(Nick and Warrick look around the room. Nick looks over by the bed. Warrick finds some composition papers on the desk:<br />
&quot;The Influence of Classical Philosophy On Shakespeare&quot;<br />
Jeremy McBride<br />
5th Period English Literature<br />
Mr. Rothchild</p>
<p>(The next paper reads:<br />
'The Relevance of Shakespeare for the 21st Century Student&quot;<br />
Mark Hervatin<br />
4th Period English Literature<br />
Mr. Rothchild</p>
<p>(Warrick sits down at the desk and goes through the stack of papers:<br />
&quot;The Definition and Uses of Infrared Light&quot;<br />
Mark Horvatin<br />
1st Period Physics<br />
Ms. Bakken</p>
<p>The next papers show:<br />
Jeremy McBride<br />
2nd Period Social Studies<br />
Mr. Sauls</p>
<p>Jeremy McBride<br />
5th Period English Lit<br />
Mr. Rothchild</p>
<p>Mark Horvatin<br />
6th Period World Politics<br />
Mrs. Olviera</p>
<p>Mark Horvatin<br />
4th Period English Literature<br />
Mr. Rothchild</p>
<p>(Finally on the bottom, he sees a composition tablet with some $100 bills in the pages.) </p>
<p>(He opens the composition notebook and notes the list and prices of the papers.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Our man Jeremy's a bit of an entrepreneur here.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Oh, yeah? How's that?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: He's trafficking in term papers.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Whatever happened to just flipping burgers, man?</p>
<p>[INT. MCBRIDE RESIDENCE - KITCHEN -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Sara is in the kitchen dusting for prints. She finds prints on the counters. She continues dusting.)</p>
<p>(She walks over to the bulletin board and sees the calendar with the stars on it. Greg walks into the kitchen.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I think I figured out when all this happened. Cassie never got to her Saturday morning chores. I was really into gold stars when I was a kid.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: As opposed to now?</p>
<p>(Greg looks at Sara. Sara scrunches her eyes, then turns and walks away.) </p>
<p>(Greg looks at the mail in the mail carrier. The envelope is from the EAST SIDE WATER &amp; POWER COMPANY. He looks through the mail and opens the electric bill.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Whoa! The McBrides must have a broken meter. Even if they left every light on day and night, it wouldn't add up to $2,000.</p>
<p>(Sara clears her throat and rubs her nose.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Maybe Brass can check it out.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I think this print dust is getting to me. Would you mind finishing the fridge?</p>
<p>(Sara passes Greg on her way out.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Do I get a gold star?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (dryly) Ha-ha-ha.</p>
<p>(Sara walks around the corner and sees some blood on the mat in front of the door leading to the cellar. She notes the lock is missing from the door.) </p>
<p>(She opens the door and looks inside.)</p>
<p>(Sara turns on her flashlight and looks down the stairs leading to the cellar. She heads downstairs. She turns the corner and sees something.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Greg? I found something.</p>
<p>(Greg joins her.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Is it the bodies?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No.</p>
<p>(In the cellar, the McBrides have a pot farm complete with artificial light. Greg walks down.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Sweet Mary Jane. The emerald city. </p>
<p>(Sara walks down the steps and joins him.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Explains the $2,000 electric bill. And all the footprints throughout the house.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: It's a ganja graveyard.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No ... it's motive.</p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[INT. MCBRIDE RESIDENCE - BASEMENT -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Sara snaps photos of the various items in the basement. Warrick comes down the stairs.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Whew ... ! Looks like someone shot out the lock upstairs. I found what looked like fragments of two bullets; they may be too m-and-d for a comparison, but I could probably get type and caliber.</p>
<p>(We see that Nick and Greg are also in the basement processing. Warrick looks around. He notices the empty lines used for drying the plants.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Man. If those suspects got everything on those lines, they made out like fat cats.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yeah, but they were only interested in the dried stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: If this was a territory war, or something like that, wouldn't the dealer want to take the new growth, to try to put these guys out of business?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Maybe one of the customers got greedy.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, we're talking about getting rich, not getting high, you know? And these dry ones go a lot faster than those. The price of an ounce these days is anywhere from $200 to $400.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Don't you guys think it's weird that the McBrides did all this with two kids in the house?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (scoffs) Yeah, if they didn't care before, I bet they do now.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. MCBRIDE RESIDENCE - FRONT DRIVE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(One of the sheriff's men carries out a paper bag full of marijuana. Nick is standing at the car, the back hood open as he writes on an evidence box. He puts the box in the container.) </p>
<p>(Sara exits the house and walks over to him.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, we took some representative samples of the green plant material.</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No outgoing calls from the house after 6:00 P.M. Friday night. I scrolled through Jude McBride's recent cell phone calls. No activity all weekend until Sunday night. Several incoming calls, all from the same number. According to Pioche PD dispatch, it's the same number as the anonymous 911 call. So I had the phone company cross-check it. The guy's local: Dr. Malcolm Parker.</p>

<p><strong>Malcolm Parker</strong>: Sorry about that, guys. You had some questions?</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Dennis Brackett</strong>: You placed an anonymous 911 call Sunday night. Said you were outside the McBrides' house and you could see blood in the entryway.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Right before that, you called Jude McBride's cell phone three times. Late night house call ... ?</p>
<p><strong>Malcolm Parker</strong>: Dennis, do I have to answer that?</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Dennis Brackett</strong>: It looks worse if you don't.</p>

<p><strong>Malcolm Parker</strong>: Dennis, of course not. And Jude was discreet. He rarely sold to anybody in town. He sent most of it out of state.</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (scoffs) What are you, his lawyer? Whoever stole the pot ... had a gun and shot the lock off the basement door.</p>
<p>(Greg finds a receipt in the back of the car.) </p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>(He sits down.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Mark knew the pot was there because of Jeremy. Come on, I'm sure Jeremy wasn't voted the most popular boy in school. He's done everyone's term paper. He's a nerd.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: Jeremy gets his books from his locker. He talks with Mark Horvatin.) </p>

<p>(Sheriff Brackett pulls up along the curb nearby and gets out of his car. He makes his way toward them.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Maybe Mark was thinking habeas corpus -- &quot;body of the crime&quot;? </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: &quot;Body of the crime&quot; is content of the case, not an actual body. </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, but a kid could easily misinterpret. Maybe he's thinking, &quot;no body, no crime, no crime, no punishment.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Dennis Brackett</strong>: You're welcome. We got a lead on the ATM. The account belongs to Jim Locke. He's got a son named Peter, the same age as Mark. We pulled some surveillance footage. It's a little grainy, can't see much.</p>
<p>(He gives the video tape to Warrick.) </p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (nods) You don't? (Sara shakes her head.) None of her blood was found at the house.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I think she was drugged, and ... she was lucky if all they did after that was kill her.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I don't think she was drugged. She's a smart little girl. She hid that cough medicine in her shoe; that's like hiding green beans in your napkin, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I hope you're right. But everything in our experience tells us they're dead, all four of them.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Doesn't mean we just give up. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No one's giving up. It's just that ... you're acting like you're going to rescue a person, not recover a body. And on this job ... that's just not usually the case.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (shrugs) I was rescued.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'm slightly concerned about its effect on the case, but more than that, I'm concerned about the case's effect on you, Nick, and I'm absolutely sure that, six months ago, you wouldn't have lost it like that.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I know, I'm sorry. I apologize for that.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: How much gas was left?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Three-quarters of a tank. Took an eighth to get out there, an eighth to get back. (He pulls out a map.) And according to the gas mileage, on the Lockes' boat, that would have been about three miles out from this launch point right here.</p>
<p>(He points and motions for Sara to follow him.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p>(Sara takes a step to follow him. She stops and checks under her shoe and removes a piece of Bubblicious gum.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Nick?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p>(She shows him Cassie's gum. Nick takes a breath and looks at his map again.) </p>
<p>TIME CUT TO: </p>
<p>[EXT. LAKE - DAY - 45 MINUTES LATER]</p>
<p>(The patrol boat is out on the lake.) </p>
<p><strong>Patrol</strong>: (to Sara) This is the three-mile mark.</p>
<p>(Sara nods. The boat's engine is cut. Nick opens the kit next to him and takes out the underwater remote camera. They put it in the water and wait.) </p>
<p><strong>Cassie McBride</strong>: (V.O.) (hoarse whisper) I used to love going to the lake, but not anymore.</p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO: </p>
<p>(They gather around the monitor as the underwater remote camera moves under the water.) </p>
<p>(After a while, they find something.) </p>
<p><strong>Patrol</strong>: There's something there.</p>
<p>(cc) CASSIE MCBRIDE: (V.O.) (hoarse whisper) They killed my whole family.</p>
<p>(On the monitor, they find Jeremy, Nina and Jude dead, their heads sticking out of the plastic trash bags wrapped around them.) </p>
<p>(The remote continues past Jude, but they find nothing, but the weights tied to the body.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(The diver opens the body bags. Sara snaps several photos of Jude, Nina and Jeremy.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Where's the fourth?</p>
<p><strong>Diver</strong>: We only found three.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Robbins goes over the findings with Warrick.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: COD?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Gunshot wound to the chest. (He picks up Jude's hand.) Though it appears to have gone through his hand first.</p>
<p>(Close-up: The bullet hole in Jude's hand.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Dad wrestled with the gun, huh?</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: Jude wrestles for the gun. The gun goes off. End of flash.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p>(Robbins points to Jeremy's body on the second exam table.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Contact wound on the boy. (Warrick turns and looks at the body.)<br />
Shot up-close and personal.</p>
<p>(Standing behind Robbins, David is writing on a clipboard.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Mom was shot twice in the back. Not up-close.</p>
<p>(Robbins picks up a metal dish with the bullet inside and hands it to Warrick.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Rinsed and ready for you.</p>
<p>(Warrick picks up the bullet and looks at it.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: ..22 ... probably from a revolver. (He puts the bullet back in the metal dish.) Six shots. Four in the bodies, two in the lock. Well, that would explain why we didn't find Cassie's blood in the house. They ran out of bullets.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Warrick is walking through the hallway; he's on the phone with Sara.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Sara, the bullets pulled from the bodies were from a .22-caliber revolver. Ibis bounced back a hit. They were entered into Ibis from the Department of Wildlife, for shooting a deer with a small caliber handgun. Firearm was returned to the owner -- a Chris Daniels from Pioche, Nevada.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. DANIELS RESIDENCE - BACK -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Chris Daniels is grilling steaks on the barbeque. The steaks sizzle as he prods them with the fork. The sports announcer is on the radio in the background.) </p>
<p>(Sheriff Dennis Brackett and Sara walk alongside the house.) </p>
<p><strong>Chris Daniels</strong>: Hey, Dennis, what's up? Hey, just in time for steaks.</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Dennis Brackett</strong>: Mr. Daniels, do you, uh ... do you own a .22 revolver?</p>
<p><strong>Chris Daniels</strong>: You know the answer to that. You cited it and fined me two hunting seasons ago.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Sir, I'm Sara Sidle from the Las Vegas Crime Lab. It's evidence in a homicide investigation. I'm going to need it.</p>
<p><strong>Luke Daniels</strong>: (o.s. from the house) Dad, how long on the steaks?</p>
<p>(The back door opens and Luke stops in the doorway. He sees Sheriff Brackett and Sara.) </p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Dennis Brackett</strong>: We're going to need to speak to Luke.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Daniels</strong>: What did you do with my gun? (Luke doesn't say anything.) If you did anything to jeopardize that football scholarship of yours, you're done.</p>
<p>(Chris turns to look at Luke. Luke glances down at the cooking fork in his dad's grip. Sara also notes Mr. Daniels tightening his hold on the fork as he glares at his son.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. DANIELS RESIDENCE - FRONT PORCH -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Sara exits the front door onto the porch. Sheriff Bracket escorts Luke out of the house.)</p>
<p>(From his car, Nick watches them head for the officer's car. Chris Daniels remains behind on the porch.) </p>
<p>(Sheriff Brackett helps Luke Daniels into the back of his squad car. Luke has his wrists handcuffed behind him.) </p>
<p><strong>Brackett</strong>: Duck your head.</p>
<p>(Chris Daniels turns and heads back inside.)</p>
<p>(Sara carries the evidence bags to Nick. She shows him the large hunting knife.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Found this in his pocket when I patted him down. Tested positive for blood.</p>
<p>(She shows Nick the shoes.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: As did these.</p>
<p>(Luke is in the back seat of the police car. He turns and levels a cold stare at Sara talking to Nick and showing him the evidence bag.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE STATION - HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Luke Daniels sits in the hallway under the watchful eye of an officer. Sara exits the room and sits in the seat next to him.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You just wanted to intimidate Jeremy, right? Scare him a little? But Mr. McBride was still home and he didn't scare so easily.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [MCBRIDE HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT] Jeremy meets with Mark Horvatin, Luke Daniels and Peter Locke. Jeremy is trying to get the guys to leave.) </p>
<p><strong>Jeremy McBride</strong>: You guys have to go. My parents are still home.</p>
<p><strong>Luke Daniels</strong>: Dude, I thought you said there were pounds of pot.</p>
<p>(Jeremy pushes them toward the door, but they don't go.) </p>
<p><strong>Jeremy McBride</strong>: You guys got to get out, okay? Please, just get out of here, all right?</p>
<p><strong>Peter Locke</strong>: Just listen to him, man. Do what he said.</p>
<p>(Luke takes out the gun and points it at Jeremy.) </p>
<p><strong>Jude McBride</strong>: Jeremy! Jeremy, what's going on?</p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong>: What the heck?</p>
<p><strong>Jude McBride</strong>: Jeremy, what's going on?</p>
<p>(Jude steps out from the kitchen.) </p>
<p>(The gun fires and hits Jeremy in the chest. Jeremy falls to the floor.) </p>
<p>(Jude grabs the gun. Luke fires and Jude falls to the ground.) </p>
<p><strong>Peter Locke</strong>: What the hell did you just do?</p>
<p>(End of flash.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Mrs. McBride came downstairs, so you had to shoot her, too.</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: Luke fires and hits Nina McBride in the back. She falls on the stairs. End of flash.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Peter went upstairs to deal with Cassie ...</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: In Cassie's room, she hides under the bed. The bed covers lift and Peter finds her. End of flash.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: ... while you and Mark bagged the pot and wrapped the bodies in garbage bags. But ... Peter couldn't do it. He couldn't kill Cassie ... so he tried to drug her. You guys got in Mark's car, you went to the ATM, you got cash, you picked up Peter's boat, you went back to the McBrides' and you loaded the bodies onto the boat.</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: On the boat, the boys wrap the bodies in the trash bags and tie them together.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (V.O.) You were out of bullets, way out on the lake. One small, loose end to tie up.</p>
<p>(Peter gently brushes the hair from Cassie's face. Her eyes are closed and she's leaning against the side of the boat. He looks back at Luke.) </p>
<p><strong>Luke Daniels</strong>: Bring her over here.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Locke</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>Luke Daniels</strong>: She can identify us! There's no way she's staying alive.</p>
<p>(Peter stands up and punches Luke.) </p>
<p><strong>Peter Locke</strong>: I said she was a strong swimmer. I didn't say we could throw a drugged ten-year-old into the lake.</p>
<p>(Luke opens his knife and pushes Peter aside. He heads over toward Cassie.) </p>
<p>(He kneels down and puts the knife to Cassie's neck.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Did it make you feel like a man? To kill a little girl?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAKE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Nick and the Patrol are out on the boat searching the waters for Cassie's body. They reach the edge of some rocks and trees. They shine their flashlights, looking for any sign of Cassie.) </p>
<p>(They follow the line where the water meets the land. Nick sees something partially hidden in the grass. He doesn't take his flashlight off the object.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Stop the boat. Stop the boat. Let me out. </p>
<p>(Nick takes his cap off and tosses it aside.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Let me out.</p>
<p>(Nick jumps in the water and rushes over to the shore. On the ground, he finds Cassie. He checks for a pulse. We see that her face is white and dirty, her eyes closed.) </p>
<p>(Nick checks her hand and sees the rest of her Bubblicious gum in her grip.) </p>
<p>(Nick looks back at the boat and around. He puts a hand on Cassie's head.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[VARIOUS FLASHES OF: PHOTOS OF CASSIE]</p>
<p>(Cassie is on the ground, her eyes are closed and the knife cut evident on the left side of her neck.) </p>
<p>(Cassie, young and healthy, smiling as she blows a bubble with her gum for the camera.) </p>
<p>(The McBride family photo.)</p>
<p><strong>Cue Sound</strong>: (PRE-LAP) RESPIRATOR PUMP</p>
<p>(With every fade out/in, we hear a heartbeat.) </p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[INT. HOSPITAL - CASSIE'S ROOM] </p>
<p>(Cassie is in the hospital bed, sleeping.) </p>
<p>FADE OUT/IN.</p>
<p>(Cassie's eyes are open.)</p>
<p>FADE OUT/IN.</p>
<p>(Cassie's awake and coloring. She looks up when she hears someone enter the room. In the background, we hear the heart monitor beeping.)</p>
<p>(Nick walks up to Cassie's bed. She stops coloring.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p>(He puts his things down on the bedside table. Cassie gives Nick the card she's been working on. The cover has a picture of a house and a lake. It reads:</p>
<p>Thanks for finding me!</p>
<p>(He opens the card:</p>
<p>FROM: CASSIE<br />
TO: GOOD GUYS<br />
ABOUT&#058; BAD GUYS</p>
<p>(Nick is touched. He smiles.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You're welcome, sweetie.</p>
<p>(He puts a hand on her head. Cassie writes in her notebook: WHERE IS MY FAMILY?!)</p>
<p>(She looks at Nick.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: They're in Vegas.</p>
<p>(Cassie writes: </p>
<p>I'M TEN YEARS OLD<br />
DON'T BABY ME !!!</p>
<p>(She underlines the words several times.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Their bodies are in the coroner's office, honey.</p>
<p>(Cassie puts her notebook aside.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, Cassie ... I know when bad things happen, it's hard to remember. But if I give you some details, do you think you could tell me the story of what happened to your family?</p>
<p><strong>Cassie McBride</strong>: (hoarse whisper) Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay. We'll go slow, okay?</p>
<p>(Nick sits down next to the bed.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: And we'll just begin at the beginning, okay?</p>
<p>(Nick puts a hand on her arm. She struggles for a while, then starts.) </p>
<p><strong>Cassie McBride</strong>: (hoarse whisper) They came to ... my house.</p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO: </p>
<p>(Out in the hallway and through the glass in the door to Cassie's room, we see her in bed. Camera is pulling back.) </p>
<p><strong>Cassie McBride</strong>: (V.O.) (hoarse whisper) They had a fight.</p>
<p>(A nurse walks past.) </p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO: </p>
<p>(Camera is pulling back down the hallway. More people walk across the hallway, in and out of camera frame.) </p>
<p><strong>Cassie McBride</strong>: (V.O.) (hoarse whisper) They couldn't find what they were looking for.</p>
<p>(She takes a deep, shuddering breath and exhales.) </p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>
<p><strong>Cassie McBride</strong>: (V.O.) (hoarse whisper) I loved my family.</p>
<p><strong>End</strong></p>

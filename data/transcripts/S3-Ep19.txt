<hr />
[INT. WONDERLAND THEATRE - NIGHT]</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: (on screen) ... there'll be others after me. You can't help yourself because you're mad, mad, mad!</p>
<p>(A cell phone rings.)</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: (on screen) No one will question you. They'll say it's just another suicide.</p>
<p>(The cell phone rings.)</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: (on screen) Hello?</p>
<p>(A cell phone rings.)</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: (on screen) Hello?!</p>
<p>(The cell phone continues to ring and is irritating the other members of the audience.)</p>
<p><strong>Audience</strong>: (irritated) Shh!</p>
<p><strong>Man In Audience</strong>: (loud whisper) Turn it off!</p>
<p>(The cell phone rings.)</p>
<p>(The USHER walks into the theatre and starts looking for the person with the cell phone.)</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: (on screen) Burgess! Burgess!</p>
<p>(The phone on the screen hangs up.)</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: (on screen) Burgess!</p>
<p>(The cell phone in the audience continues to ring.)</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: (screams) Burgess!</p>
<p>(The USHER finds the MAN sitting in his seat with the cell phone clutched in his left hand and approaches him from one row behind.)</p>
<p>(From on screen comes the sound of glass shattering.)</p>
<p><strong>Usher</strong>: (to the man) Excuse me, sir. I'm going to have to ask you to turn the phone off.</p>
<p>(The USHER gets no response from the MAN.)</p>
<p><strong>Usher</strong>: Sir? I'll have to ...</p>
<p>(The USHER taps the MAN on the shoulder and he slumps forward, blood oozing out from his mouth and into his popcorn.)</p>
<p>(The cell phone continues to ring.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. WONDERLAND THEATRE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and GRISSOM walk into the theatre.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Whoo! Theaters are like nightclubs; they should always keep the lights off.</p>
<p>(They walk toward the body still sitting in the theatre seat.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This is the last art house left in Vegas. I saw Baraka here, on a double bill with Koyaanisqatsi.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Was there anyone else here?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: With you?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and CATHERINE walk through the rows and reach the body. GRISSOM is standing one row behind the body and CATHERINE is in the same row as the body. GRISSOM puts his kit down and both lean over to look at the body.)</p>
<p>(Inspired by the venue, BRASS stands on the other side of the body and starts reciting the victim information as if he were a private eye in a 1940's black and white movie; his voice as smooth as silk.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Thursday night is noir night. The poor sap was slumped over like a sack of potatoes, oozing blood like a broken bottle of ketchup. </p>
<p>(BRASS puts his pretend cigarette to his lips and takes a puff. If he had a hat on, he'd tilt it. GRISSOM looks at BRASS. CATHERINE looks at BRASS.)</p>
<p>(BRASS looks at them both, takes a deep breath and continues to recite information in his usual manner.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: His name is Gus Sugarman. Runs a dental practice in Henderson. Cell phone went off three times during the movie. So, the usher finally came over to shut him up.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, somebody beat him to it.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks down at the wound at the back of the victim's neck.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Single puncture wound to the base of the skull.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And nobody saw anything?</p>
<p>(Everyone straightens and looks around the theatre.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: They were watching the movie. Dark room. Loud music. Four exits. Everybody looking the other way.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Professional killer?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (shrugs) ... or a movie buff.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>

<p>FADE IN.</p>
<hr />
[INT. WONDERLAND THEATRE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(ROBBINS is in the theatre with GRISSOM and CATHERINE. All are standing around the victim seated in the theatre chair. GRISSOM is looking at the wound at the back of the victim's neck and arguing with ROBBINS.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: It was &quot;Build My Gallows High&quot;, with Robert Mitchum, 1947.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (shakes his head) It was &quot;Out of the Past&quot;, with Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: ... and Kirk Douglas. Trust me, the book was &quot;Build My Gallows High&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (interrupting) Mr. Siskel, Mr. Ebert, may I have a Cause of Death, please?</p>
<p>(ROBBINS leans over and looks at the wound.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Puncture wound is small. Not a knife. Seems like it penetrated all the way to the brain stem, and there's some bruising around the mouth.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, the killer could have stood over him, placed his hand over his mouth, stabbed him in the back of the head.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The killer puncturing something into the back of the victim's neck. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Didn't Telly Savalas do that in &quot;The Dirty Dozen&quot;?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Anthony Quinn did it, too, in &quot;Guns of Navaronne&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, what movie did you see this in?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE shines the flashlight at the other side of the victim's neck. Both ROBBINS and GRISSOM lean in to look where they see the abrasions and bruising.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Looks like somebody ripped something off his neck.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Small patterns; could have been a chain, maybe, huh?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The killer grabbing the chain and ripping it from the victim's neck. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE starts looking on the floor.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Or necklace. Oh!</p>
<p>(She drops her flashlight and it starts rolling toward the front of the theatre.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Butterfingers.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE leaves the body to go get her flashlight.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM snaps a photograph of the cellphone then takes it out of the victim's grip.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: What'd you got?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, whoever called him didn't leave their number.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM checks the list of calls received from the cell phone.)</p>
<p>(Meanwhile, CATHERINE is a few rows in front of the victim where her flashlight stopped rolling. She looks down and finds the murder weapon, a screwdriver, next to the flashlight on the floor. She picks it up and holds it up to examine.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (calls out) Hey! I wasn't the only one who dropped something tonight.</p>
<p>(BRASS appears at the top of the theatre near the doorway.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (calls out) I got a witness.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. WONDERLAND THEATRE - LOBBY - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(BRASS and GRISSOM interview the witness.)</p>
<p><strong>Movie Goer</strong>: I only noticed 'cause she got up during the best part of the movie, right before the gunfight.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Is the gunfight loud?</p>
<p><strong>Movie Goer</strong>: Yeah. I mean it's not THX surround-sound. This was 1950 and mono optical track. (He chuckles, then stops when they don't laugh with him. He explains.) I like how loud this theater keeps it.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Perfect moment to do it. Cover up any noise the victim might make.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You get a look at her?</p>
<p><strong>Movie Goer</strong>: I drove forty minutes to see this flick; my eyes were on the screen, but, uh, she was tall, not old ... a redhead.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did she come back in?</p>
<p><strong>Movie Goer</strong>: No. And, uh ... </p>
<p>(He looks around at the crowd of people outside the theatre.) </p>
<p><strong>Movie Goer</strong>: I-I don't see her here.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did anyone see her coming into the lobby?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, manager had left for the night. The usher who found the body had left before we got here. He had been smoking blunts. He was afraid we were going to bust him for marijuana. I'll be tweaking him when I call him for my statement.</p>
<p><strong>Movie Goer</strong>: If you ask me, anybody who leaves their phone on in a movie deserves to get stabbed in the head.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: That's why nobody ask you.</p>

[EXT. WAREHOUSE -- DAY]</p>
<p>(NICK, WARRICK and SARA get out of their cars and make their way past the gathering police cars. They head toward the warehouse and meet up with DET. O'RILEY.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Detective.</p>
<p><strong>O'Riley</strong>: Guys ... </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Who called it in?</p>
<p>(They walk under the crime scene tape toward DET. O'RILEY. The four of them walk toward the warehouse.)</p>
<p><strong>O'Riley</strong>: Passing motorist heard gunshots. First officer did a drive up. Found the scene. Called in the world. I hope you brought extra supplies.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Why's that?</p>
<p><strong>O'Riley</strong>: You're gonna be here awhile.</p>
<p>(DET. O'RILEY opens the warehouse door. The CSIs look at the scene inside in amazement. In the middle of the empty warehouse is the body lying face down on the floor. The walls are riddled with bullet holes that are visible with the sunlight streaming in through them.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Looks like a war zone.</p>
<p>[INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(They walk inside toward the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We got an I.D. On the body?</p>
<p><strong>O'Riley</strong>: No cash, no I.D., just a driver's permit. </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Driver's permit.</p>
<p>(WARRICK leans forward and looks at the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What is he, 16?</p>
<p><strong>O'Riley</strong>: Fifteen-and-a-half. Timmy McCallum. Coroner's on his way.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (to O'RILEY) Tell them to watch their step. There's casings and blood everywhere.</p>
<p>(WARRICK stands up and turns around to SARA and NICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Divide and conquer. Inside or outside?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Outside perimeter.</p>
<p>(SARA heads outside.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I'm Dennis Rodman.</p>
<p>(NICK turns and walks out. WARRICK turns back toward the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'll take everything below the knees.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Soda.</p>
<p><strong>Jacqui Franco</strong>: Yellow crumbs?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Popcorn.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Carpet fibers.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It wasn't the cleanest theater in the world. I just want to match the blood to our victim.</p>
<p><strong>Jacqui Franco</strong>: And you want to know if there's a recoverable print.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p>(GREG and JACQUI look at each other. CATHERINE smiles at the two lab techs in front of her.)</p>

She opens the plastic fume container, then adds a couple of drops to the dish. she puts the dish on the heater and the screwdriver inside the container.

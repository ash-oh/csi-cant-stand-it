							<p>Neuro-intergalactic vibrations, the invasion's coming.</p>
<p>They are watching us right now.</p>
<p>These other dimensions-- they're everywhere.</p>
<p>There everywhere And string-- it's obvious-- string is the thing that connects everything, and I not talking about the stuff you can see Protons, photons, fig newtons, electrons, notrons and time and space...</p>
<p>Time and space?</p>
<p>I see you turning your back on me, shaking your head.</p>
<p>I can't help you.</p>
<p>Ignore the truth at your own peril, sir.</p>
<p>At your own peril.</p>
<p>Hi, see, we can't see the strings 'cause they're invisible, - but they can 'cause they're the 11th dimension.</p>
<p>Hey, you're ready for them tonight, Evelyn.</p>
<p>The invasion's tonight. Don't say I didn't warn you.</p>
<p>What´s the matter?</p>
<p>Can´t look?</p>
<p>You know what that´s tell me?</p>
<p>That you did it-- you shoot her, you put a dress on here the trooper saw you put the body in the back of your pick-up truck.</p>
<p>Is there anything else you did that we gonna find out?</p>
<p>That what his doing.</p>
<p>And the body is at tha autopsy right now.</p>
<p>Oh, this must be our Jane Doe.</p>
<p>Doe, a deer.</p>
<p>A female deer.</p>
<p>It's not funny.</p>
<p>It's a little funny.</p>
<p>Doc, I already took photos.</p>
<p><em>Not for my scrapbook, you didn't.</em></p>
<p>This is animal abuse.</p>
<p>The killing, sure.</p>
<p>The dress?</p>
<p>Pet owners put sweaters on chihuahuas.</p>
<p>Just give me a hand with the arrow.</p>
<p>Hmm, it's not an arrow; it's a bolt shot from a crossbow.</p>
<p>Alcohol.</p>
<p>You think he had to get her liquored up?</p>
<p>Okay, so you got a DUI, resisting arrest, several new and unique wildlife violations.</p>
<p>You're in a truckload of trouble, Kyle.</p>
<p>I... I... I found her like that.</p>
<p>In a cocktail dress?</p>
<p>I didn't put no dress on her.</p>
<p>Oh, no, no, no... see, I was...</p>
<p>I was taking her to the vet.</p>
<p>You sure it wasn't a nightclub?</p>
<p>Then how do you explain the crossbow I found in your truck there, boss?</p>
<p>Easy. Somebody put it there.</p>
<p>Okay, take a deep breath for me now.</p>
<p>Blow into this.</p>
<p>Come on, guys. I mean, can't... can't you give me a break here?</p>
<p>I mean, look, no, here... I... I... I just got a... I got a divorce, right, and my ex just cleaned me out.</p>
<p>Let me guess: her name is Bambi.</p>
<p>Blow!</p>
<p>Stop him!</p>
<p>Move, move, move!</p>
<p>Get out of the way!</p>
<p>Get out of the way!</p>
<p>Hey!</p>
<p>Hey, hey, hey, citizens arrest!</p>
<p>Light him up.</p>
<p>Now do you believe me?</p>
<p><em>just less lethal.</em></p>
<p>AFID tags confirm it was Officer Choi's weapon.</p>
<p>You know, I don't get it.</p>
<p>Suspect makes a break for it, clocks a couple of unis, gets pepper-sprayed, and keeps going.</p>
<p>Pepper spray doesn't always stop them when they're really drunk.</p>
<p>Suspect blew a .28.</p>
<p>Oh, well, maybe he was a sloppy drunk.</p>
<p>Any alcohol on his clothes?</p>
<p>He'd been in PD for hours.</p>
<p>Alcohol would have evaporated.</p>
<p>STOKES: I'm gonna need your stun gun.</p>
<p>Am I in trouble?</p>
<p>When was the last time you had this thing serviced?</p>
<p>Not since I've been on the force.</p>
<p>That's only six months now.</p>
<p>We'll have it analyzed, see if it was malfunctioning.</p>
<p>That's the first time I had to shoot it.</p>
<p>Relax, man.</p>
<p>You were following captain's orders.</p>
<p>When you talk to IA, just be honest... and don't expect a hug.</p>
<p>That's when you said to your officer, I quote, &quot;Light him up.&quot;</p>
<p>Poor choice of words.</p>
<p>We followed the proper procedure for escalation of force.</p>
<p>I mean, at least we didn't shoot him.</p>
<p>Of course, that would have killed him.</p>
<p>As far as my office is concerned, we got an in-custody death on your orders.</p>
<p>Doesn't get much worse.</p>
<p>Look, we use stun guns all the time around here; this is the first one that caught on fire.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Maybe this guy had so much booze it made him a Roman candle?</p>
<p>Well, unfortunately, human blood is 83% water.</p>
<p>It's just not flammable, no matter how drunk you are.</p>
<p>That's too bad.</p>
<p>Might have let you off the hook.</p>
<p>Together in death, as they were in life.</p>
<p>Guy abuses wildlife and then bursts into flames.</p>
<p>I call it karma.</p>
<p>There are no physical signs their relationship was anything other than platonic.</p>
<p>I mean, we're the ones encroaching <em>on their habitat-- you don't see them shooting us.</em></p>
<p>Consider this justice for Bambi's mother.</p>
<p>Light him up.</p>
<p>This is the rest of the stuff that we got from the dead guy's truck.</p>
<p>One crossbow.</p>
<p>Same bolts we recovered from the dead deer.</p>
<p>Couple of mason jars.</p>
<p>Whew! Moonshine.</p>
<p>Home brew.</p>
<p>Firewater.</p>
<p>Grain alcohol's 190 proof, you know?</p>
<p>That's 95% alcohol.</p>
<p>Who was he trying to forget?</p>
<p>Well, Brass said that he'd just gotten divorced.</p>
<p>Welcome to the club.</p>
<p>You see any night-vision goggles or, uh, spotlights in that box?</p>
<p>No, why?</p>
<p>Well...</p>
<p>I think he must have shot the deer during the day and then waited until dark to put her in his truck.</p>
<p>That's a long time just sitting out in the woods drinking.</p>
<p>Stun gun checks out.</p>
<p>Operates as designed.</p>
<p>Puts out the standard 50,000 volts.</p>
<p>Well, that eliminates one variable.</p>
<p>Leaves us with the shirt, the grain alcohol, and the pepper spray.</p>
<p>Time to find out if one of those made him catch on fire.</p>
<p>Don't tase me, bro.</p>
<p>Don't tempt me.</p>
<p>What are we missing?</p>
<p><em>JOHNSON: Either she's a 421-Adam, or somewhere</em> a scarecrow and a lion are looking for their friend.</p>
<p>STOKES: That's Evelyn.</p>
<p>She's wearing her deflector suit.</p>
<p>Every night, she comes down to PD at some point, <em>and e files a complaint against them.</p>
<p>What did them do to her?</em></p>
<p>Everything, from stealing her thoughts to raping her, but even if she is crazy, she's a variable in all this.</p>
<p>See, there may have been some sort of transfer between her and burning man.</p>
<p>She didn't stick around for the debrief.</p>
<p>Well, can you blame her?</p>
<p>She just witnessed spontaneous alien combustion.</p>
<p>And you didn't hold her.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Did you get a statement?</p>
<p>Where is she now?</p>
<p>We don't know.</p>
<p>There's a lot you don't know.</p>
<p>You can count on three things happening every day around here.</p>
<p>The coffee machine's going to break down; some tourist is going to swear the hooker was over 18; and Evelyn's going to show up.</p>
<p>We got a broadcast out.</p>
<p>We'll find her.</p>
<p>She's very shiny.</p>
<p>It's gotta be getting hot under all that foil.</p>
<p>She's going to cook out here fast.</p>
<p>Evelyn.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>The driver...</p>
<p><em>said his shift was over.</p>
<p>He was just taking the truck back to the yard.</em></p>
<p>Said a flash of light came out of nowhere.</p>
<p>The sun was just coming up.</p>
<p>Reflection off of her suit must have blinded him.</p>
<p>Okay, well, this tin foil's evidence in two cases now, so we've got to be careful with it.</p>
<p>Butane lighter.</p>
<p>It's cracked.</p>
<p>Looks empty.</p>
<p>That could be what lit the flame in your deer hunter.</p>
<p>I'll check the foil for butane.</p>
<p>Trouble is, it's probably evaporated by now.</p>
<p>200 bucks.</p>
<p>Okay, turn her over, Dave.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Guys. We got some green fluid here.</p>
<p>It's coming from the wound.</p>
<p>STOKES: Damn!</p>
<p>I think that's blood.</p>
<p>SANDERS: Take a look.</p>
<p>You're not going to believe it.</p>
<p>Another 419 with green blood.</p>
<p>What are the odds?</p>
<p>That he's not connected to our first victim?</p>
<p>Astronomical.</p>
<p>Looks like blunt-force trauma to me GRISSOM: You know, Tin Foil Lady was run over just a few blocks from here.</p>
<p>I bet this area was home to both of them.</p>
<p>Three pairs of sunglasses?</p>
<p>Earplugs.</p>
<p>That, David, is how you make it dark and quiet when you sleep on the street.</p>
<p>SANDERS: Hey!</p>
<p>I think I found the weapon!</p>
<p>We should be able to get some good prints off it.</p>
<p>I've seen green blood before, but only from bodies in advanced stages of decomp.</p>
<p>What do you think turned it green?</p>
<p>I suspect it might be sulfur.</p>
<p>Hmm, sulfur's a naturally occurring component of blood.</p>
<p>Yes, but in massive doses it tends to turn the blood a blackish avocado green.</p>
<p><em>When the sulfur atom joins the hemoglobin molecules, red blood turns green.</em></p>
<p>Which is why First Officer Spock's blood <em>is green in Star Trek.</em></p>
<p>No, it's not.</p>
<p>Uh, yes, it is.</p>
<p>Trust me.</p>
<p>I'm an expert.</p>
<p>Well, apparently not, because otherwise you would surely know that the oxidizing agent in Vulcan blood is copper.</p>
<p>And that is why his blood is green.</p>
<p>Well, it was that and the fact that he had a Vulcan father, since his mother was actually human.</p>
<p>And furthermore, <em>he was promoted to Captain just prior to Star Trek II</em> and then he retired as civilian ambassador.</p>
<p>You're like a geeky, nerdy guy trapped in a woman's body.</p>
<p>So are you.</p>
<p>Well, as I was saying, here on Earth, sulfur-containing compounds could turn otherwise normal blood green.</p>
<p>As I suspected.</p>
<p>What? Share.</p>
<p>She wasn't a Vulcan.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I don't want to take all the credit, but I do know why both your victims have green blood.</p>
<p>High levels of sulfur.</p>
<p>(sighs): Yes.</p>
<p>Did you identify the source yet?</p>
<p>Not yet.</p>
<p>I'll get the blood over to Henry and have him run a tox panel for sulfuric compounds.</p>
<p>Oh, and even if your tin foil lady was gushing blood, it would not have contributed to your stun gun guy's immolation.</p>
<p>Did you find anything on the foil?</p>
<p>Bacon grease and trace amounts of ketchup.</p>
<p>Both things you would find at a barbeque, but not the kind that you're dealing with.</p>
<p>Brass just called.</p>
<p>Our lonely deer hunter's parents just hired a lawyer.</p>
<p>The department's going to be sued.</p>
<p>We haven't even released the case details yet.</p>
<p>Our investigation's still ongoing.</p>
<p>Well, they got something we don't.</p>
<p>Move! Move! Move!</p>
<p>Get away! Get away!</p>
<p>Over 60,000 hits since it was posted.</p>
<p>Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!</p>
<p>STOKES: Here, on the PD surveillance, this ambulance chaser on his cell phone-- he's a regular.</p>
<p>Want to bet he's the one that shot the footage?</p>
<p>Want to bet he's the one filing suit?</p>
<p>Well, his cell phone has a better angle than the PD surveillance camera.</p>
<p>Archie, run this back to where he gets sprayed.</p>
<p>Get away!</p>
<p>Wait a minute.</p>
<p>Tighten up on the can.</p>
<p>Nick, when we did the experiment with Jell-O Man, we used pepper spray from a red can, right?</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah, department-issue.</p>
<p>Got it through Logistics.</p>
<p>That one's yellow.</p>
<p>I've used my pepper spray half a dozen times on the street.</p>
<p>All I had to do was write a use-of-force memo.</p>
<p>BRASS: Speaking of memos, didn't you get the one we issued about five years ago?</p>
<p>I know what you mean.</p>
<p>Yeah, you know, when the department switched over to water-based pepper spray.</p>
<p>STOKES: This one uses isobutane.</p>
<p>Compressed gas, highly flammable stuff.</p>
<p>Where's yours?</p>
<p>It's Murphy's Law, right?</p>
<p>I always got my gear together, wired tight, but last night my girl takes my pepper spray.</p>
<p>And I don't blame her because she's got a dangerous job.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah? What does she do?</p>
<p>She goes to WLVU during the day.</p>
<p>Shstudies kinesiology, but she dances nights at the Acid Strip.</p>
<p>What does she clip the can to, her G-string?</p>
<p>It'd be a deterrent to stuffing a tip in there, wouldn't it?</p>
<p>Come on; she walks to the parking lot alone at 4:00 a.m.</p>
<p>Okay, so she takes your department-issue, so what'd you do?</p>
<p>Pick up an old can lying around?</p>
<p>No, bought one at Catalani's Gun World on the way in.</p>
<p>I didn't get a chance to change it out.</p>
<p>Does it really matter?</p>
<p>It might.</p>
<p>I just ran your pipe over to Prints after I sampled it for blood.</p>
<p>Yeah, did you find something wrong?</p>
<p>I found something weird.</p>
<p>One end of the pipe was covered with blood from the victim.</p>
<p>Yeah, the administrator at the shelter ID'd him as Wayne Connor, homeless.</p>
<p>Well, then on the other end of the pipe, I found several small blood smears from an unknown donor.</p>
<p>So the killer was also injured.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>His blood's green, too.</p>
<p>GRISSOM: &quot;Once is happenstance. Twice is coincidence. Three times is enemy action.&quot;</p>
<p>HODGES: Winston Churchill?</p>
<p>Ian Fleming.</p>
<p>I should know that.</p>
<p>I'm a huge James Bond fan.</p>
<p>What aren't you a fan of?</p>
<p>I ran the green bloods for sulfur-containing compounds.</p>
<p>Still working on the third donor, but Evelyn Polychronopolous and Wayne Connor both had high levels of thiocyte in their systems.</p>
<p>Prescription medication for migraines.</p>
<p>ANDREWS: I checked with the downtown pharmacs.</p>
<p>They don't dispense it.</p>
<p>154 nanograms per milliliter-- that's overdose levels.</p>
<p>Even if they were in a clinical trial, they wouldn't get that much.</p>
<p>It's not a typical drug of abuse.</p>
<p>GRISSOM: a migraine, you'll do anything to stop the pain.</p>
<p>How do you know they had migraines?</p>
<p>Well, aside from the medication, Connor was wearing three pairs of sunglasses and earplugs.</p>
<p>Photo- and phonosensitivity are symptoms of migraines.</p>
<p>Maybe that's why Evelyn thought &quot;they&quot; we invading her brain.</p>
<p>She was killed only a few blocks from the vacant lot with a couple hundred dollars on her.</p>
<p>She could have been on her way to a drug buy.</p>
<p>So if we can figure out who's selling the drugs, it may lead us to who killed Connor.</p>
<p>Damn busy day.</p>
<p>Hmm, where are they?</p>
<p>Inside, end of the hall.</p>
<p>Mailman got worried when they didn't come to the door.</p>
<p>We did a welfare check, found them both in the bed.</p>
<p>Doc.</p>
<p>ROBBINS: Catherine.</p>
<p>No forced entry; no sign of trauma; bodies don't look posed.</p>
<p>No gas odor, no petechiae.</p>
<p>No sign of suffocation.</p>
<p>So why'd you call CSI?</p>
<p>Couple in their late 60s.</p>
<p>What are the chances they died of natural causes at the same time?</p>
<p>&quot;Digoxin. Warfarin. Amiodarone.&quot;</p>
<p>Those are all heart medications.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>&quot;Zolpidem.&quot;</p>
<p>That's for sleep.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Bottle's almost full.</p>
<p>No foaming at the mouth, no note left behind.</p>
<p>I don't think this is a double suicide.</p>
<p>Suspicious circs.</p>
<p>Good call.</p>
<p>They look like they loved each other.</p>

<p><em>CATHERINE: Looks like Caddyshack back here.</em></p>
<p>Invasion of the ground squirrels.</p>
<p>Yeah, I got a few casualties out here.</p>
<p>I see.</p>
<p>What the hell is that?</p>
<p>Looks like a close encounter, right?</p>
<p>&quot;Atomic Dave's Painless Removals.&quot;</p>
<p>Some kind of pest control gizmo.</p>
<p>Apparently, it works.</p>
<p>I don't think the squirrels would agree that it's painless, though.</p>
<p>Shr dinger Martin?</p>
<p>He had a cat named Shr dinger.</p>
<p>Must have been into physics.</p>
<p>Cat grave.</p>
<p>Dead cat, dead critters, dead couple.</p>
<p>Imagine living next door to that racket.</p>
<p><em>WOMAN: Last night?</em></p>
<p>I was in my studio.</p>
<p>I'm an artist.</p>
<p>Didn't your neighbors complain about the noise?</p>
<p>I don't weld at night.</p>
<p>I work on my jewelry.</p>
<p>High-end stuff.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Listen, how well did you know your neighbors, the Martins?</p>
<p>Are they dead?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>They passed away last night.</p>
<p>Hardly knew them.</p>
<p>Heard he was a, uh... (grunting): ...professor or something.</p>
<p>Yeah, we really didn't have too much in common.</p>
<p>Well, apparently, you both shared a ground squirrel problem.</p>
<p>Could be worse, I guess.</p>
<p>I could still be with my deadbeat ex.</p>
<p>There's a pest I did get rid of.</p>
<p>ROBBINS: Hey, Catherine.</p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p>What a relief.</p>
<p>Two red-blooded Americans.</p>
<p>According to his stomach contents, he likes a glass of red wine with his pasta.</p>
<p>Looks like suppertime was about four hours premortem.</p>
<p>Take a look at the light board.</p>
<p>Both Martins wore pacemakers.</p>
<p>Mrs. Martin's is in that bowl.</p>
<p>Takes a licking and keeps on ticking.</p>
<p>Yeah, I hope mine's still working when I pop off.</p>
<p>You wear a pacemaker?</p>
<p>Bradycardia-- slow heart.</p>
<p>Every once in a while, just to make sure I don't skip a beat, the pacer kicks in, just like this one.</p>
<p>Well, obviously, they didn't die of pacer malfunction.</p>
<p>What you got?</p>
<p>Check this out.</p>
<p>It's like having a witness to his death inside his body.</p>
<p>There's no interruption in his pacemaker functions, but... about eight hours before he died, there was a spike in his heart rate.</p>
<p>His wife's is almost identical, so something got their hearts racing.</p>
<p>Who knows?</p>
<p>Maybe they, uh, enjoyed a little afternoon delight.</p>
<p>Well, let's hope.</p>
<p>(chuckles)</p>
<p>Either way, their heartbeats went back to normal and they died in their sleep a few hours later.</p>
<p>Okay, so I've be thinking this over and here's my advice.</p>
<p>If you want to get a real relationship with a girl, you are going to have to move out of Mom's.</p>
<p>No girl wants the competition.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Oh, God, no, no, turn 'em off.</p>
<p>Turn 'em off. Turn 'em off.</p>
<p>David Bohr, you're under arrest for the murder of Wayne Connor.</p>
<p>No, no, it was self-defense.</p>
<p>He tried to kill me over a couple hundred bucks.</p>
<p>He needed some stuff.</p>
<p>He couldn't pay.</p>
<p>He said some money was coming.</p>
<p>I had to go to work.</p>
<p>I turned to leave and he comes at me like an animal.</p>
<p>I have to go.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>This is Captain Brass.</p>
<p>We need a Code 3 paramedic response to my location.</p>
<p>Hey, I got your page.</p>
<p>What's up?</p>
<p>I think our cases might be connected.</p>
<p>Take a look at that.</p>
<p>So my green-blooded victim from the vacant lot was buying pharmaceuticals from the guy who did pest removal for your dead couple.</p>
<p>Looks like this guy was trying to create radio frequencies or something.</p>
<p>Well, I don't know what kind of effect that has on household pests, but radio waves can produce &quot;noise on the channel,&quot; which could interfere with pacemaker function.</p>
<p>Thing is... the Martins' pacemakers are still ticking.</p>
<p>Ah, the luck of the Irish.</p>
<p>It makes sense, though.</p>
<p>If his blood was green, his organs would be green.</p>
<p>Well, frankly, I expected something more in the... dark avocado, almost black range.</p>
<p>Yeah, this is more artichoke.</p>
<p>You know, atmospheric sulfur levels are on the rise.</p>
<p>Hundred years, we're all going to look like spinach.</p>
<p>You guys didn't wait for me.</p>
<p>We're just about to excise his brain.</p>
<p>I'll bet you five bucks, Greg, that his brain is not as green as his heart.</p>
<p>Keep your money in your pockets, Greg.</p>
<p>There's a higher vascular nature to the heart and lungs.</p>
<p>Only the blood vessels in the brain are going to be green.</p>
<p>It's a sucker bet and you know it.</p>
<p>Well, thanks, Doc.</p>
<p>So, uh, Dave here did some humane rodent pest removal for Desert Palm Hospital, which is where he got his hands on the thiocyte.</p>
<p>He was all about freedom from pain.</p>
<p>Sea foam.</p>
<p>A lovely shade.</p>
<p>Look at the size of that.</p>
<p>He had a brain tumor pressing on the amygdala.</p>
<p>Well, this could cause his migraines.</p>
<p>Absolutely, and also aggressive disruptive behavior, paranoia.</p>
<p>As the tumor enlarged, it impacted the arteries, causing the cerebral hemorrhage that you observed.</p>
<p>He was self-medicating for the wrong condition.</p>
<p>No wonder he overdosed.</p>
<p><em>WILLOWS: Let 'er rip.</em></p>
<p>In order to interfere with pacemaker function, it'd have to be putting out between 50 and 60 hertz.</p>
<p>Okay, I'll input that range.</p>
<p>This thing isn't putting out anything that's lethal.</p>
<p>Tox report showed that the medications weren't lethal.</p>
<p>This thing's harmless.</p>
<p>I refuse to believe it was natural causes.</p>
<p>It's too big of a coincidence.</p>
<p>So we've got a dead cat and dead squirrels.</p>
<p>Maybe what killed them is what killed the Martins.</p>
<p><em>In an interview in the San Francisco Chronicle--</em> October 31, 1996, if I recall correctly-- one Professor Gilbert Grissom revealed that as a boy, he collected dead animals he found in his Marina del Rey neighborhood and performed necropsies on them.</p>
<p>Hodges... I want you to stop stalking me.</p>
<p>Bitter almonds.</p>
<p>Cyanide crystals in the stomach lining.</p>
<p>Yeah, any time you need a sniffer to detect it, my nose has the cyanide gene.</p>
<p>What gene turned your nose brown?</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>You can sew him up.</p>
<p>Will do.</p>
<p>And I'll notify next of kin, too.</p>
<p>Ugh.</p>
<p>GRISSOM: Cyanide is fast-acting.</p>
<p>If it killed the squirrels before the crystals were dissolved completely in their stomachs, you'd expect the same thing with the Martins.</p>
<p>I saw the Martins' stomach contents.</p>
<p>There were no white crystals.</p>
<p>Yeah, but maybe if it was ingested in a different manner.</p>
<p>Squirrels will eat anything.</p>
<p>If the Martins drank it, then that would explain the absence of crystals.</p>
<p>I already have Henry running an expanded tox panel.</p>
<p>Any minute now.</p>
<p>It's cooking.</p>
<p>It's coming right up.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You hear Hodges is looking for his own apartment?</p>
<p>Cut the old apron strings.</p>
<p>His mother finally kicked him out, huh?</p>
<p>Good for her.</p>
<p>Lethal levels of cyanide.</p>
<p>You can't just walk into a hardware store and pick some up.</p>
<p>What about pest control companies?</p>
<p>Can they get it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And mining companies, uh, electroplaters, photographers, jewelry makers.</p>
<p>Thanks, Henry.</p>
<p>You can relax now.</p>
<p>Look, is this going to take long?</p>
<p>Depends on you.</p>
<p>'Cause I'm dealing with some really bad news.</p>
<p>I just found out my ex died last night.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>Yeah, apparently one of you guys blew him up with a stun gun.</p>
<p>Kyle Planck is your ex?</p>
<p>Tell me, what is it that you two have against God's fur-covered creatures?</p>
<p>Is this about that damn cat?</p>
<p>For starters, yes.</p>
<p>Look, I like cats, all right?</p>
<p>It was an accident.</p>
<p>You can't just relocate ground squirrels.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>I mean, they're... they're disgusting.</p>
<p>And I'm an artist.</p>
<p>I need a certain environment to work in.</p>
<p>Does this environment give you access to cyanide?</p>
<p>I use potassium cyanide in electroplating.</p>
<p>All my work is custom.</p>
<p>And also to poison ground squirrels?</p>
<p>I mixed a little with a can of tuna.</p>
<p>And I put it out back.</p>
<p>But only in my yard.</p>
<p>All right, who knew the Martins' cat was going to find it?</p>
<p>What? Is that against the law?</p>
<p>Actually, <em>irresponsible use of poison is against the law,</em> as well as killing ground squirrels and killing neighbors.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>I didn't... I didn't kill them.</p>
<p>Look, we had neighbor issues.</p>
<p>Turn that damn thing off before I torch it!</p>
<p>You're driving all your squirrels into my yard.</p>
<p>All right, look, we're just trying to be humane here.</p>
<p>Now you use poison.</p>
<p>And you-you killed Shr dinger.</p>
<p>You should've kept your cat on your side of the fence, all right.</p>
<p>You're causing this problem, not me.</p>
<p>Just leave us alone!</p>
<p>I killed the squirrels.</p>
<p>And possibly their cat.</p>
<p>But I am not a murderer.</p>
<p>I got nothing.</p>
<p>Try the bed.</p>
<p>That's...</p>
<p>Sorry. I was thinking of one of those, uh, bloodhounds in the old cartoons, &quot;Sniffing awound to find da wabbit.&quot;</p>
<p>This is a gift.</p>
<p>Don't make it cheap.</p>
<p>Trail's gone cold.</p>
<p>So, they died in this room.</p>
<p>In bed.</p>
<p>Give me a hand with the mattress.</p>
<p>Now, get down and sniff the rug.</p>
<p>It's all they ever want.</p>
<p>Pay dirt.</p>
<p>This carpet looks kind of new, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Definitely some combustion there.</p>
<p>It looks like they just laid the new carpet right on top of the old, which clearly limited the supply of oxygen.</p>
<p>The old carpet melted without bursting into flame.</p>
<p>Ironically, older carpets contained polyvinyl chloride used as a flame retardant.</p>
<p>So, when it got hot, it probably went into quantitative decomposition, <em>which gave off gases, including hydrogen cyanide.</em></p>
<p>Field work dirty.</p>
<p>Dirty, dirty, dirty.</p>
<p>Oh! Come on!</p>
<p>Your killer's a ground squirrel?</p>
<p>In a way, I'd argue self-defense.</p>
<p>It was an old house.</p>
<p>The wood had desiccated.</p>
<p>The short circuit smoldered into the floor joists.</p>
<p>Is it bad when you start thinking none of this sounds too weird anymore?</p>
<p>Oh, it's a bit too freaky how these cases are connected.</p>
<p>Grissom, you always say that there's no such thing as coincidence.</p>
<p>There isn't.</p>
<p>WILLOWS: Oh, come on.</p>
<p>You got the guy that burst <em>into flames just divorced from the woman who was fighting squirrel wars with the Martins.</p>
<p>SANDERS: Who had hired the exterminator whose drugs were turning everybody's blood green.</p>
<p>STOKES: And one of his green-blooded customers was Evelyn, Our Lady of Tin Foil, the last person that Kyle Planck touched before he died.</em></p>
<p>There's one more connection.</p>
<p>Evelyn had 200 bucks.</p>
<p>I'm thinking that when she was run over, <em>she was</em> on her way to buy more thiocyte.</p>
<p>I think that Wayne Connor was with David Bohr, waiting for the money to arrive.</p>
<p><em>SANDERS: Only Evelyn never showed up.</p>
<p>Connor lost his temper, and Bohr killed him in a fight.</em></p>
<p>And it all started with Kyle Planck-- <em>lonely guy with a gut full of moonshine.</em></p>
<p>String theory.</p>
<p>Grissom theory.</p>
<p>This is better than a bedtime story.</p>
<p>GRISSOM: String theory is &quot;the theory of everything.&quot;</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics tells us about the very small.</p>
<p>The theory of relativity explains the immense.</p>
<p>String theory ties it all together.</p>
<p>It proposes that atomic particles are made up of infinitesimal, vibrating loops of energy-- or strings.</p>
<p>Each string vibrates at its own frequency-- like on a violin, producing &quot;notes.&quot;</p>
<p>And these notes make up everything in the universe.</p>
<p>Cosmic symphony.</p>
<p>These strings have been combining and recombining ever since the big bang.</p>
<p>So, the connections between our victims-- or any of us-- are not that extraordinary.</p>
<p>But every one of them thought they were alone.</p>
<p>BROWN: Too bad they didn't know about Grissom's theory.</p>
<p>In a parallel universe, maybe they're all having breakfast together.</p>
<p>In this universe, maybe we are.</p>
<p>STOKES: Yeah.</p>
<p>And you're buying.</p>
<p>No strings attached.</p>

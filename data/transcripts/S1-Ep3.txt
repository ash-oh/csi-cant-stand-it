<p><strong>Narrator</strong>: Previously on: </p>
<p>[Scenes from 1X01: Pilot]</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - HALLWAY]</p>
<p>(NICK moves the &quot;SOLVED&quot; magnet from the side and puts it right on top of the board on CRIME #99, UNIDENTIFIED PERSON, on his side of the board.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: GRISSOM swings NICK'S new I.D. badge in front of him.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Congratulations, Nicky, my boy. You are now a CSI Level Three.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (excited) Whoo!</p>
<p>[INT. CATHERINE'S SISTER'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING]</p>
<p>(LINDSEY wakes up.)</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Willows</strong>: Mommy?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I couldn't drive here fast enough to tell you how much I love you.</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Willows</strong>: I love you, too.</p>
<p>[Scenes from 1X02: Cool Change]</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - LAB]</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Sara Sidle?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (smiles) I know who I am. I think you're a little confused.</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - BRASS' OFFICE - DAY]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM checks into BRASS' office as he clears his stuff out.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I just off the phone with the Sheriff. He says he wants me to run the unit.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You're the boss.</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - HALLWAY]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and WARRICK sit on the bench in the hallway.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: They say I got to let you go.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I know.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM stands and moves in front of WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I don't care what the book says. I lost one good person today, I don't want to lose another. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM holds out WARRICK'S gun and badge back out to him.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Here.</p>
<p>(WARRICK looks up at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p>CUT TO END OF &quot;PREVIOUSLY ON&quot;</p>
<p>FLASH IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. VARIOUS NEVADA DESERT (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>(Camera close up of a shovel dropping dry dirt onto the ground and patting it down. A large booted foot steps onto the spot.)</p>
<p>(The MAN finishes and walks away from the spot with his shovel.)</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO BLACK.</p>
<p>(A lighter flame flickers on. The woman holding the lighter is lying down in the dark. She looks around at the enclosed space around her. She starts to panic and cry.)</p>
<p>(She screams as she realizes that she's inside a box.)</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>
<hr />
[INT. GARRIS RESIDENCE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Scene opens on the tape machine playing the ransom note. GRISSOM, NICK and JACK GARRIS listen to the message.)</p>
<p><strong>Altered Voice</strong>: (o.s.) (from tape) Bring $2 million in hundreds to Charleston and Third in three hours or your wife dies. (beat) Stop me from taking the money -- she still dies.</p>
<p><strong>Jack Garris</strong>: This guy thinks it's some kind of joke using a voice like that.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: He's altering his voice, sir, electronically.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We don't consider it a joke at all.</p>
<p>(GRISOM starts the tape over again.)</p>
<p><strong>Altered Voice</strong>: (from tape) Bring $2 million in hundreds ... </p>
<p><strong>Jack Garris</strong>: (irritated and impatient) You guys have listened to that tape like, twenty times. Will somebody please go out and find my wife?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mr. Garris, please. Sometimes, if you listen closely you can hear a lot.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM rewinds the tape again. He plays it and everyone falls silent as they listen to the low frequency buzz of the player.)</p>
<p><strong>Jack Garris</strong>: (after a moment) I don't hear anything.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Right. Where do you hear nothing in Las Vegas?</p>
<p>(JACK GARRIS doesn't say anything as he thinks about it. GRISSOM answers his own question.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The desert. (beat) And, judging by what sounds like a low frequency buzz in the background, possibly near power lines.</p>
<p><strong>Jack Garris</strong>: How'd you hear all that?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I listen.</p>
<p>(JACK GARRIS stares at GRISSOM and nods his head slightly.)</p>
<p>(In the background, we can hear someone talking on a phone.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (to phone) Right, okay, all right, got it.</p>
<p>[INT. GARRIS RESIDENCE -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(BRASS makes his way across the living room toward them. He puts his phone away.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (to GRISSOM) I just spoke with the FBI. They'll back us up if we need it, but we have to handle it.</p>
<p>(BRASS turns to leave. JACK GARRIS stops him.)</p>
<p><strong>Jack Garris</strong>: Uh, detective, wait. What are my chances here ... of-of Laura ... f-for Laura?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: It's a three-hour window.</p>
<p><strong>Jack Garris</strong>: Will somebody just tell me the truth?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: A ransom message with a short fuse means that the victim's situation will cause her to expire by or before the deadline regardless of what we do.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: In a car trunk -- that kind of thing.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: It's a form of passive murder if you want to be, uh...<br />
'honest' about it.</p>
<p><strong>Jack Garris</strong>: Then you guys have got to move.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mr. Garris ... it's my experience that, in situations like this if you want to go fast, go slow.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<hr />
[INT. GARRIS RESIDENCE - BACK HALLWAY -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(SARA walks cautiously into the hallway. She looks at the security pad on the wall.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Get a picture of the security pad. Someone touches it before it's dusted, I break their fingers. </p>
<p>(SARA turns her head and works her way down the hallway. The photographer/tech follows her.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Shoot the mirror, point of disturbance the lamp, point of disturbance ... </p>
<p>(SARA puts an evidence marker on the mirror and she puts evidence marker #2 on the lamp on the floor. The tech takes pictures of the security pad on the wall, then turns to take pictures of the mirror.)</p>
<p>(SARA looks up and sees something on the doorframe. As she stares at it, NICK appears behind her also staring at the doorframe. SARA turns around.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: ... you're standing in my crime scene.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No. (he holds up the disk) (beat) You're in mine.</p>
<p>(NICK smiles and turns to walk out of the house.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (envious) You're doing audio? I wanted that.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I outrank you.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Technicality. Who did Grissom handpick to work here?</p>
<p>(NICK chuckles dryly.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Keep telling yourself that.</p>
<p>(SARA turns back to look at the doorframe)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (to the tech) Get the lights, will you?</p>
<p><strong>Technician</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p>(The TECHNICIAN turns the lights off. SARA gets out her ALS and looks at the stuff on the doorframe.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. GARRIS RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(BRASS talks with JACK GARRIS.)</p>
<p><strong>Jack Garris</strong>: Shady friends? No. Laura surrounds herself with quality people-- people of real substance.</p>
<p>(BRASS nods.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Has her behavior changed recently -- drug use, alcohol, things like that?</p>
<p><strong>Jack Garris</strong>: (interrupts) No, no, no, nothing like that. </p>
<p>(BRASS doesn't say anything. He stands up.)</p>
<p><strong>Jack Garris</strong>: She's a health nut -- we both are.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>Jack Garris</strong>: Look, I'm a rich man. How do we let this guy know I'll pay?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We don't want to go there yet.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. GARRIS RESIDENCE – SUV -- CURB -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(NICK starts the car's engine. GRISSOM leans in through the open passenger window to give NICK last minute instructions.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Nick, tell lab to do a reverse algorithm on that tape and then get it into enhancement.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I know what to tell the audio guy.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You've been a Level Three for what, two weeks?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I got it under control. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM stares at NICK and doesn't say anything. NICK smiles.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Swear. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM moves away from the window.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Later.</p>
<p>(NICK shifts the car into gear.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. GARRIS RESIDENCE - BEDROOM]</p>
<p>(Camera opens on a broken picture frame on the floor next to evidence marker #6. A camera flashes.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks into the bedroom. SARA is standing at the dresser taking photographs. GRISSOM walks in and looks around.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Cursory call -- looks like a professional job. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM doesn't say anything. He leans over to look at the various framed pictures on the tabletop. SARA continues to call it.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (continuing) Our guy bypasses the security system, surprises the wife in the back hall. Drags her in here. She grabs onto the doorway -- sign of struggle. No sign of sexual assault. He's in, they're out. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM glances down and sees a smudge on the carpet. It grabs his attention and he leans in low to examine it closely.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (continuing) Probably ... egress through those doors. Excuse me, is my evaluation interrupting you?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No, no, no. I barely heard you.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Glad I have a healthy ego. You find something interesting there?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Dirt.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You're ... so ... technical ... I can hardly keep up, but ...</p>
<p>GRISSOM; Oh, sorry, but, uh ... out of context, it's ... just dirt.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. GARRIS RESIDENCE - BACKYARD - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM steps through the open balcony doors and out into the backyard patio. SARA follows him.)</p>
<p>(He looks around. SARA sniffs.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Did you just slap on bad cologne?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I never wear it. It interferes with the job.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It's almost sweet.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM sees something.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p>(He finds a cloth on the ground. He picks it up and smells it. He offers it to SARA to smell.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Can't be chloroform.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Halothane, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We'll confirm it in GC mass spec.</p>
<p>(SARA reaches into her bag for an evidence bag.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: &quot;Looks like a professional job,&quot; I think you said. </p>
<p>(SARA glances up at GRISSOM and smiles.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Care to amend your evaluation? I mean, if the guy forgets the rag he used to knock her out, he can't be much of a pro.</p>
<p>(He puts the cloth in the evidence bag SARA holds open for him.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (smiles) I keep trying to be your star pupil.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sara, that was a seminar. This is real. Pebbles, tile -- the front is all concrete.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No dirt. Context-- there is dirt on the carpeting inside.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: In an otherwise spotless house.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You're saying kidnapper tracked the dirt in.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Possible. As of now, that's about all we have, so ... I guess we follow the dirt.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks past SARA and back into the house. SARA looks up, shakes her head and smiles.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Cameras flash. The female in the body bag is covered and the bag zipped up.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: The ambulance door closes and the vehicle drives off.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: How many hit-and-runs we had this year?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Too many. One thing I can't stand is a punk coward.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks down at the roadside and stares at the scooter that the little girl was riding. It's on its side next to evidence marker #1 and a ruler.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: My daughter wants one of these scooters. Says she's the only kid in the world who doesn't have one.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE steps up to the fallen scooter and kneels down next to it. WARRICK looks at CATHERINE'S back.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You want me to take this case alone?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE turns around to look back up at WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You feeling all right, Warrick?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Oh, I'm fine. I'm ... I'm looking after you. (He shakes his head.)<br />
It's that thing with Holly Gribbs. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE stands up and looks at WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It's made me think of who I am to my partners, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So this is what-- your new leaf?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (embarrassed, yet serious) You keep on busting on me, you won't see any kind of leaf.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (smiles) Hey, relax. I'll play nice. Thank you for the offer. I'm okay. I can handle this one. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE turns back to look at the scooter. She kneels down next to it.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It'd be nice if this paint transfer had just one special property.<br />
(beat) You want to call it?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (points) Vehicle's humming down Rochester. The vic was on her scooter, heading eastbound. Car brakes here ...</p>
<p>(WARRICK points to the tire marks on the road next to evidence marker #3.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: ... impact here. The vic was thrown -- what-- twenty meters?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And all we've got is some paint that's going to match up to about 20 million other vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (sighs) Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: b*st*rd.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. GARRIS RESIDENCE - FOYER -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(JACK GARRIS heads out the front door. He turns around to look at BRASS.)</p>
<p><strong>Jack Garris</strong>: Are you ordering me not to pay the ransom?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: It's a very strong suggestion, yes.</p>
<p>(Behind BRASS, GRISSOM turns the corner and heads slowly toward the men.)</p>
<p><strong>Jack Garris</strong>: After you told me she could already be dead? I don't believe you guys. This is my wife. I'm paying the ransom.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Look, if you give up the cash the kidnapper has no reason to communicate with us.</p>
<p><strong>Jack Garris</strong>: Does anyone on your team know where Laura is right now?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We have an entire forensics lab working on this.</p>
<p><strong>Jack Garris</strong>: Yeah? Something tells me I'll see her before you do.</p>
<p>(And with that, JACK GARRIS walks out of the house with the money in a briefcase.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, your job just got harder.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (sighs) I'll stay close to the money.</p>
<p>(BRASS heads out the front door to follow JACK GARRIS.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[SCOPE VIEW OF THE DIRT]</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) This dirt has interesting properties.</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - LAB -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(SARA and GRISSOM are in the lab. SARA is looking through the scope at the dirt.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The gold flecks -- that's easy -- it's gold. The little gray squiggles? Cyanide.</p>
<p>(She looks up from the scope.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Cyanide? He poisoned her?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No. Did you know that Nevada produces 80% of the country's gold? Miners drop cyanide powder into the dirt and it draws the gold to the surface.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: And how does a bug specialist know so much about dirt?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I had a case five years ago. We found a skeleton in an abandoned gold mine. I thought it was a murder. Turned out the guy passed out drunk and the cyanide leached into his system.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Gruesome, Grissom.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You know, it's funny but every case teaches me something about the next.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So when you said, &quot;Follow the dirt&quot;...?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Gold mine -- it's possible that's where he's got her.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Great. There's got to be 100 gold mines in Nevada.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: True, but how many are near power lines within range of the drop zone?<br />
(He unrolls the map in front of him.) Three. (He points.) One ... two ... three.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO BLACK.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(DR. JENNA WILLIAMS uncovers the little girl.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Jenna Williams</strong>: This is your hit-and-run victim. Bad thing about this job is you stop asking yourself 'why'. Here's the bruise I was telling you about. </p>
<p>(She lifts up the blanket to show CATHERINE the bruise on the little girl's thigh. CATHERINE leans in for a better look.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Jenna Williams</strong>: You see it?</p>
<p>(WARRICK moves around to look at the bruise.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The little girl screams. The car impacts her on the thigh. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (straightens) Oh, my god. Plate numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Jenna Williams</strong>: From the license plate when it impacted her skin.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Looks like a &quot;four&quot; and a &quot;J.&quot;</p>

[INT. CSI - HALWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(GRISSOM and NICK walk through the hallway.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I want you to find something new on that tape.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Like what? We already matched the guy's voice.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You know what the defense attorneys will do with that? That's who you're up against, in the end. </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You think I don't know that? Aw, you been second-guessing me ever since I got on this case.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: People leave us clues, Nick. They speak to us in thousands of different ways. It's our job to make sure that we've heard everything they've said. Anything less is reasonable doubt.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I'll go back to the tape.</p>
<p>(NICK leaves. GRISSOM turns and looks inside the Break Room where CATHERINE is pouring herself a cup of coffee.)</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - BREAK ROOM - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You any better?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks up at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Your little major-minor blowup about Lindsey not wanting a party.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, that. Yeah. (sighs) I'm just afraid that I'm making her weird, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (looks at her) No.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I work 24/7. I have no time for my friends. My daughter rarely sees me having any fun. And, all of a sudden, she doesn't want a party.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE grabs her cup and heads out the doorway. She and GRISSOM start down the hallway.)</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And that's because of you?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yes. I'm her mother. She mimics me.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, then she'll be fine. I mean, look at you.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You're just saying that to make me feel better.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(Behind them, SARA steps out into the hallway from the garage carrying a roll of tape.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey, Grissom ... could you come tape me up?</p>
<p>(Without waiting for an answer, SARA ducks back into the room. GRISSOM turns to look at CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I love my work.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It shows.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns and heads for the garage.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>

[INT. CSI - GARAGE - DAY -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(SARA is sitting inside the car with her hands taped together in front of her. GRISSOM stands outside the passenger seat adding the last of the tape.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So, you found Laura's hairs here ... passenger side, front seat?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Right. Not in the back. Which made me ask, what kind of a kidnapper puts a woman bound and unconscious in the front seat? The back of my arm isn't touching the sheepskin, see?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah. So?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: But, there is sheepskin fiber on the back of Laura's sleeve. That tells us Laura sat back like a normal person would.</p>
<p>(SARA holds out her taped wrists.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Cut me, Mack.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM cuts the tape off.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Like this.</p>
<p>(SARA pushes her arms back against the front seat to illustrate what she means.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So she wasn't bound at all?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Correct. But, would a kidnapper risk putting an unconscious woman in the front seat of his car, even unbound? Answer is usually in the question -- you taught me that. So, was she unconscious? We found halothane on the patio. Halothane knocks you out ... if you take it.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So, you're saying she never inhaled the halothane?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Proof would be in her blood. Halothane stays in the system up to 48 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How pleased am I that I got a sample of her blood? </p>
<p>(GRISSOM trumps her and she sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So you can go check at the lab, see how it turned out.</p>
<p>(SARA stands up.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Damn it, I wanted to carry the ball over the line.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I know.</p>
<p>(SARA heads out of the garage. BRASS walks into the garage.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We just picked up our kidnapper-- Chip.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What's up?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: His lawyer was at his house -- wants to make a deal.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No deals. We know what Chip has to offer.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, yeah, Kreskin? What's that?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Laura Garris.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The Victim?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The Accomplice.</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You got something that can't wait, Nick?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, the ransom tape enhanced -- mega-enhanced.</p>
<p>(NICK hands the tape to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Good. I'll listen to it right now.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: All right. Hey, I just ... I didn't know there was more to look for, you know?</p>

[EXT. CSI - GARAGE - DAY]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and WARRICK examine the car. CATHERINE is in the driver's seat and finds something embedded in the steering wheel cover. She sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: When you want evidence, you can't find it. When you don't want it, it's as big as Dallas.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What you got?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Can you tell what that is?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: My Aunt Bertha could tell, and she's legally blind.</p>
<p>(WARRICK and CATHERINE look at each other.)</p>

[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM -- DAY]</p>
<p>(WARRICK and CATHERINE are back interviewing CHARLES MOORE. JAMES MOORE sits next to his grandfather -- not saying anything, not looking at them.)</p>
<p><strong>Charles Moore</strong>: (perplexed) You want to look at my teeth? What kind of investigation is this?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: A forensic investigation, sir.</p>
<p><strong>Charles Moore</strong>: Fine. You look at my teeth. </p>
<p>(CHARLES MOORE takes his false teeth out from his mouth and puts it on the interview table.)</p>
<p><strong>Charles Moore</strong>: Give them back when you're done.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE clears her throat and look at JAMES. CHARLES puts his teeth back into his mouth.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: James ... we found a tooth chip embedded in the steering wheel of your grandfather's car. It doesn't appear to be, uh, from your grandfather's teeth.</p>
<p>(JAMES looks at his grandfather.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: James ... you have a chipped tooth? Must be an incisor, or we would have noticed.</p>
<p><strong>James Moore</strong>: Pops, I'm sorry, but I got to.</p>
<p><strong>Charles Moore</strong>: He's a good boy. It was an accident. I make him call ... let me know where he is especially when he's out after dark.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: JAMES MOORE is driving the car and talking to his grandfather on the cell phone. Rap music blasts on the radio.)</p>
<p><strong>James Moore</strong>: Hey, pops, it's me. Tips were good. </p>
<p>(Flash cut to: Little RENDA HARRIS is moving along on her scooter.)</p>
<p><strong>James Moore</strong>: Hey, I thought I'd go check out a movie over at the plex. </p>
<p>(Flash to: RENDA HARRIS on her scooter.)</p>
<p><strong>James Moore</strong>: Okay. See you later.</p>
<p>(JAMES hangs up and glances away for a moment to put the phone away. At that moment, RENDA HARRIS crosses the car's path. JAMES looks up and hits the brakes, but it's too late. The car hits RENDA HARRIS. She screams. The scooter falls. JAMES lunges forward, hitting his teeth against the steering wheel.)</p>
<p>(He starts to panic. He reverses the car and leaves the scene.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Charles Moore</strong>: He drove straight home and wanted me to go to the police station with him. </p>
<p><strong>James Moore</strong>: I didn't know that little girl was dead. I swear. I didn't know what to do. I knew Pops would know.</p>
<p><strong>Charles Moore</strong>: I wouldn't let him turn himself in. That was my decision. Boy's going places - college -- he's got a real future.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm very sorry, Mr. Moore. James, I'm afraid you're going to have to be taken into custody.</p>
<p><strong>Charles Moore</strong>: Miss, please, now, I'm willing to serve his time.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I know you are, Mr. Moore. We can't let you do that.</p>
<p><strong>Charles Moore</strong>: I made him cover it up. That was my decision.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: He can explain all that to court. I'll be a witness. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks at WARRICK who also nods his head.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We both will.</p>

[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(JAMES MOORE walks out of the interview room with handcuffs on and escorted by two officers. CATHERINE and WARRICK follow.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey... why don't you run on home? I'll handle this.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Is this more of your new leaf?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Your daughter gets out of school in a half hour, right? (CATHERINE nods.) On her birthday. (She nods again.) Why do you want to pick a fight with me now?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I owe you.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Don't think I won't collect.</p>

[INT. CSI - GRISSOM'S OFFICE -- DAY]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM sits in his office with ear phones on listening to the disk. Behind him, the door opens and SARA walks in.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Grateful dead CD?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes off the ear phones.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Who's dead?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No halothane in Laura Garris' blood which proves she was never knocked out. She went willingly. She and Chip faked her kidnapping -- which, of course, makes no sense at all.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Because she ended up underground in a box. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: With a black eye. Any theories?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Greed.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. GARRIS RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(GRISSOM and SARA interview LAURA GARRIS in their living room while she's sitting next to her husband.)</p>
<p><strong>Laura Garris</strong>: That's ridiculous. I don't even know Chip Rundle except that he's Jack's trainer.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: But you became pretty good friends, didn't you?</p>
<p><strong>Laura Garris</strong>: (shakes her head) No. Jack ... no.</p>
<p><strong>Jack Garris</strong>: (looks at GRISSOM) I believe my wife.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Thing is, Jack, I tend not to believe people. People lie. The evidence doesn't lie.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You and Chip made a plan to run away together with your hard-earned millions, Jack. Divorce is just too long and messy. Anyway, the plan was surprisingly well thought-out.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: CHIP RUNDLE grabs LAURA GARRIS from behind, clamping his hand over her mouth.)</p>
<p><strong>Chip Rundle</strong>: Don't move.</p>
<p><strong>Laura Garris</strong>: Ooh ...</p>
<p>(He lets her go. She turns around and jumps into his arms where they start kissing.)</p>
<p>(They start making their way slowly down the hallway, LAURA GARRIS still being carried by CHIP.)</p>
<p><strong>Laura Garris</strong>: Go on, say it.</p>
<p><strong>Chip Rundle</strong>: No, no!</p>
<p>(As they pass the large mirror in the hallway, LAURA tips it askew.)</p>
<p><strong>Laura Garris</strong>: Say it!</p>
<p><strong>Chip Rundle</strong>: What?</p>
<p>(The lamp falls to the floor. LAURA kisses CHIP.)</p>
<p><strong>Laura Garris</strong>: Say the words.</p>
<p>(LAURA reaches out for the door frame.)</p>
<p><strong>Chip Rundle</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p>(As they pass through the door frame, LAURA leaves a mark there.)</p>
<p>(Flash to: CHIP tracks dirt on the bedroom floor as he leaves.)</p>
<p>(They pass by the dresser where LAURA knocks everything to the floor.)</p>
<p>(CHIP hands LAURA a cloth.)</p>
<p><strong>Chip Rundle</strong>: Put this on. </p>
<p>(LAURA puts the halothane on the cloth.)</p>
<p><strong>Chip Rundle</strong>: A lot of it.</p>
<p>(CHIP carries LAURA out of the bedroom and through the patio where LAURA drops the cloth.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>SARA You were in, you were out. And you dropped that halothane rag to make sure we'd find it and know you were unconscious -- a real victim. Jack, all due respect -- she's anything but.</p>
<p><strong>Laura Garris</strong>: Oh, really? Then how did I end up buried alive, scared to death?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We're getting to that. You and Chip drove out of town. She sat in the front seat, unbound, fully conscious. They stopped at a roadside phone. Chipper called in the ransom message and I think you were still in the truck then, right, Laura?</p>
<p><strong>Laura Garris</strong>: Whatever. This is your thing.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Pay attention. It's about to become yours.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (taking over) Then you both drove East towards Sandfill mine. He probably told you about some little line shack or something where you could stay while he picked up the ransom money. But then, all of a sudden, he pulled over -- probably made some excuse.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: CHIP walks away from the car. LAURA GARRIS shuts the car door and hesitantly follows him.)</p>
<p><strong>Laura Garris</strong>: Chip... what are we doing?</p>
<p><strong>Chip Rundle</strong>: Switching cars -- covering our tracks. I got a jeep up over this hill.</p>
<p><strong>Laura Garris</strong>: Where?</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I bet, right away, in your gut, you knew something was up. And then, just a few minutes later you knew for sure.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Over the hill, LAURA comes upon the wind box in the hole in the ground. She stops smiling. CHIP comes up behind her. LAURA turns around to look at CHIP. He swings and hits her in the eye, knocking her out.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's when, I believe, you got your black eye.</p>
<p><strong>Laura Garris</strong>: I, uh ... I don't remember.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And then, finally, you were unconscious. He duct-taped your hands and he buried you. </p>
<p>(NICK walks in to the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Guess he figured why split $2 million when he can dump you and have it all.</p>
<p><strong>Jack Garris</strong>: Laura?</p>
<p><strong>Laura Garris</strong>: Jack, it's not true. I had no part in it.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Audio downloaded everything. Dubs are cued up.</p>
<p>(NICK starts to set up the speakers attached to the player.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Let's listen to Chip's message, okay? Remember, Jack when I told you you could hear a lot if you listened?</p>
<p><strong>Jack Garris</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(NICK takes a seat on the couch.)</p>
<p><strong>Chip Rundle</strong>: (from tape) Bring $2 million in hundreds to Charleston and Third in three hours or your wife dies. Stop me from taking the money, she still dies.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I'm sure you all recognize Chip's voice unaltered. Now, one more time with a slight variation.</p>
<p>(NICK takes out another disk and switches it with the one in the player.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's amazing what we can do with the new forensic audio programs. Enhance sounds, isolate them.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Heck, we can lift entire speeches just to see what's underneath.</p>
<p>(NICK shuts the player and turns it on.)</p>
<p>CUE SOUNDS: (from tape) CAR WHOOSING</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: A car went by when Chip was on the phone to you, Jack. Scared you, didn't it, Laura? Thought it might be the police?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: On the side of the road, CHIP is on the phone. LAURA is hanging out the car window watching when the car on the road approaches them.)</p>
<p><strong>Chip Rundle</strong>: (from tape) Bring $2 million in hundreds to Charleston and third in three hours or your wife dies.</p>
<p>(She nervously glances at the car, then quietly says something to CHIP.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Let's hear it once more without that annoying car.</p>
<p>(NICK turns the player on where it's clear what LAURA says to CHIP.)</p>
<p><strong>Laura Garris</strong>: (from tape) Chip, hurry up.</p>
<p>(JACK gasps and turns to look at LAURA.)</p>
<p><strong>Jack Garris</strong>: You're my whole life.</p>
<p><strong>Laura Garris</strong>: Please, Jack. Your work is your life. How else do you think I started sleeping with Chip right under your nose?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: All right, let's go, Laura. Officer has a car waiting out front.</p>
<p>(LAURA stands up.)</p>
<p><strong>Laura Garris</strong>: Just wait. Just wait a second. Grissom, I can help you. I can get you Chip not just on this. He was into a lot of things. Steroids. He was into credit cards. He was ...</p>
<p>(The officers put the handcuffs on LAURA.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We already have you both for about 25 years, minimum.</p>
<p>(The OFFICERS take LAURA out of the house.)</p>
<p>[EXT. GARRIS RESIDENCE - DAY]</p>
<p>SLOW MOTION CAMERA: The officers lead LAURA GARRIS out of the house. GRISSOM and crew follow.</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: There's one thing you didn't explain in there. As soon as you dug Laura up, why didn't she turn Chip in?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Self-preservation. She rats on him, she rats on herself.</p>
<p>(They put LAURA GARRIS into the car. She turns and looks at JACK. JACK doesn't spare her a glance. He turns and walks back into the house.)</p>

<p><strong>Lindsey Willows</strong>: I see my friends every day at school. I never get to be alone with you.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh ... wow ... well, I'm really glad to be alone with you, too. I like this more than you will ever know.</p>
<p>(LINDSEY turns and sees a little boy and a little girl just about her own age riding a scooter.)</p>
<p><strong>Little Boy</strong>: Come on, man. <strong>Little Girl</strong>: I'm coming!</p>
<p>(She turns to look at her mom.)</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Willows</strong>: Are you going to get me one of those for my birthday?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Uh, maybe when you're older. (beat) Like 40.</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Willows</strong>: (laughs) Mommy!</p>

<p><strong>Charles Moore</strong>: My grandson going to jail is never okay. (beat) You stay alive in there. You hear me?</p>
<p><strong>James Moore</strong>: (nods) You, too. Don't be going downhill.</p>
<p>(They hug each other.)</p>
<p>(WARRICK swallows. The OFFICER step up to get JAMES. The cell door opens. WARRICK grabs a pen and stops him.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hold on. James ... the first couple days are going to be the toughest. Here. </p>
<p>(On JAMES' hand, WARRICK writes down a phone number.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Here's my cell number. You run into any problems you call me. I'll be right there. All right? Keep your head up.</p>
<p>(The officer leads JAMES to his cell. The doors close behind him.)</p>

<p><strong>Charles Moore</strong>: ... give James your number. I've seen other law enforcement people in my day ...</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: &quot;My day.&quot; (chuckles) Reminds me of my grandmother. Yeah, I gave her a lot of rough nights, too. She used to call me her &quot;work in progress.&quot;</p>

							<p>COLD OPEN:</p>
<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY SCENES (STOCK) -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Sirens wail in the distance.)</p>
<p>[DR. ROBBINS] </p>
<p>(Dr. Robbins is wearing a biohazard suit and breathing heavily through a respirator. He's sealed up tightly.) </p>
<p>[INT. HOTEL - HALLWAY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(He makes his way through the hallway and slowly approaches the hotel room.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: (to phone) (o.s.) I've already been exposed. It's too late. Get a list of all the countries she's visited in the past thirty days.</p>
<p>(Dr. Robbins turns into the hotel room. Det. Vartann is standing in the doorway and is on the phone.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: (to phone) Yeah, her passport.</p>
<p>(Dr. Robbins walks in through the hotel room and finds the distraught housekeeper talking with an Officer.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: (to phone) Try the State Department.</p>
<p><strong>Housekeeper</strong>: (crying) My husband, please. Yeah. I have to tell my husband! Oh, please. Call my husband!</p>
<p>(Dr. Robbins walks into the bedroom where he meets up with David Phillips. He appears very nervous. He stands next to the bed holding his usual clipboard.) </p>
<p>(Dr. Robbins leans forward and examines the red, spotted lesions on the dead woman's arms.)</p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
[INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Catherine shows her ID to the officer at the outer hotel door. He opens the lobby door for her and she walks in, again flashing her ID to the next officer standing on the inside.) </p>
<p>(The building lobby is very crowded. It's as if everyone was evacuated out of their room and down to the lobby.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: (o.s.) No, absolutely not, sir. You need to step aside.</p>
<p>(Catherine walks up to the officer standing guard over the crime scene tape.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Ma'am, I'm sorry, but you can't go up.</p>
<p>(She shows him her ID.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Catherine Willows, Crime Lab.</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: I know who you are, but hotel rooms are under quarantine. No one goes up, no one goes down.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Quarantine?</p>
<p>[INT. HOTEL - ROOM - NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Dr. Robbins examines the body. He holds out his hand.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Come on. Nasal Spec.</p>
<p>(David Phillips digs into his bag for the instrument. He finds it and hands it to Dr. Robbins.) </p>
<p>(Dr. Robbins examines the woman's nose and finds it clean and clear. David looks at Dr. Robbins anxiously. Dr. Robbins checks the dead woman's eyes. They too are clear.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: It's okay, David. </p>
<p>(David helps Dr. Robbins take off his biohazard mask. Dr. Robbins removes his respirator.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (louder) False alarm. We're clear.</p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
[INT. HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Catherine makes her way to the hotel room. As she gets closer, the distraught, crying housekeeper is escorted out of the room by an officer.) </p>
<p>(Catherine walks into the room.)</p>
<p>[INT. HOTEL - ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(She looks around. She turns the corner toward the bedroom and sees Det. Vartann.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hi. </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: (motions) Go on in.</p>
<p>(On the bed, she sees the dead woman's body. Robbins and David are both near the bed. Det. Vartann steps into the room behind Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Someone want to fill me in here?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: David assessed a potentially infectious agent, and per protocol, he remained at the site and called it in.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Her-her red blotches are consistent with CDC photos of ebola.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: You did the right thing.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (nods) So what are we looking at?</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Um, 419, suspicious circs. Uh, honestly, I have no idea.</p>
<p>[BEDSIDE MIRROR]</p>
<p>(Through the mirror's reflection, we see Catherine turn and look around.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay, it's my turn now. Clear the scene.</p>
<p>SMASH CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Robbins uses his glasses and looks at the burns on the Julie Stern's arm.) </p>
<p>(Catherine walks in.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Sorry I'm late. I was processing the scene. Nothing probative.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: There are forty-two distinct laser burns on Julie Stern's body.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Lasers?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Lasers cauterize the skin as they destroy tissue. Lack of blood and scabbing confirms their use, so best guess would be she recently underwent a cosmetic procedure.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Julie Stern sits under the light and gets laser treatments.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: That's consistent with the hotel manager's statement. Said the vic had booked into the Safari Suite.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Please tell me that has nothing to do with hunting wild game.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Women who ... don't want their friends to know that they're freshening up will check into the suite while they heal.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Well, five-star hotel's got to be cheaper than a hospital stay.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, could complications from this procedure have resulted in her death?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: No. Histamine levels are normal. There's no post-op infection. But look at her fingernails.</p>
<p>(He picks up her hand and shows the lines on the nails.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mees lines; indicative of heavy metal poisoning.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: I sent blood and hair samples to tox.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: I'm not sure if it's probative, but I found ten cc's of urine in her stomach. Digestive system's intact. There are no bruises or abrasions in her mouth, so there's only one way it could have gotten there.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Chugalug.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. BECKMAN RESIDENCE - FRONT DRIVE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Officers and other personnel gather outside the tented house. Grissom parks the SUV out on the street front. He, Greg and Sara exit the car.) </p>
<p>(They meet up with Brass who fills them in.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (consulting his notebook) Okay. So two days ago the residence was tented for termites. This morning, the bug guys came to clear the house. They found the homeowner exterminated.</p>
<p>(They make their way under the crime scene tape toward the front house entrance.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: He's ID'd as Elliot Beckman, 42, lived alone. Body's in the family room.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Who's been inside?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Just the exterminators and the paramedics who pronounced. They entered and exited through the front door. Good luck.</p>
<p>(Brass turns and leaves as Grissom, Greg and Sara walk into the tented house.)</p>
<p>[INT. BECKMAN RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(Grissom opens the front door. He turns on his flashlight and sees the dead insects on the floor.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Exterminators use sulfuryl flouride. It kills the bugs and then evaporates. Agro scientists call it the &quot;safety&quot; fumigant.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You know, I'm sure he would disagree.</p>
<p>(They approach the dead body, face down on the floor.)</p>
<p>(Sara and Grissom are nearest the body. Greg steps on a dead insect. The crunching sound is loud in the house. He kneels in front of something.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Eyeglasses on the floor.</p>
<p>(Near the eyeglasses he finds a pool of throw-up.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Got vomit?</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: [INT. BECKMAN RESIDENCE] The house fills with gas. Elliot Beckman is on his hands and knees crawling, gasping and coughing. He throws-up on the floor.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p>(Greg stands up and continues to look around the house. Sara opens her kit.) </p>
<p>[INT. NEXT ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Greg looks around in the other room and finds a blue feather on the desk and a cluster of blue feathers on the floor. He heads back into the living room.) </p>
<p>[INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: What flies when they're on and floats when they're off?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Feathers.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Long and blue. I'll bag 'em.</p>
<p>(Sara takes photos of the body.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: His cheek is bruised.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What was he doing in here?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. BECKMAN RESIDENCE - FRONT DRIVE - DAY]</p>
<p>(Brass interviews Ted Martin and Nate Allen.) </p>
<p><strong>Ted Martin</strong>: Per the R&amp;R's, we conducted a thorough walk-through before releasing the gas. No plants, people or animals were left behind.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: All right, so you released the gas, then what?</p>
<p><strong>Ted Martin</strong>: I took off.</p>
<p><strong>Nate Allen</strong>: Can't stick around baby-sitting houses, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Once you left the house, could Beckman have snuck back in in any way?</p>
<p><strong>Ted Martin</strong>: Yeah, if he had a death wish. The house is toxic for the first twelve hours.</p>
<p><strong>Nate Allen</strong>: Mm-hmm. Not to mention it gets wrapped up tighter than a Christmas present.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know tented houses -- they're prime targets for burglars.</p>
<p><strong>Ted Martin</strong>: But, we, uh, secure these on the outside of every doorknob. Clamshell locks. Nobody gets inside.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, says you.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - INTERVIEW ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Nick and Catherine interviews Dr. Tony Malaga, the plastic surgeon. He returns the morgue photo back to them.) </p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tony Malaga</strong>: Yes, Ms. Stern was in my care.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And when was the last time you saw her, Dr. Malaga?</p>
<p>(He reviews his file.) </p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tony Malaga</strong>: Uh, I ablated her liver spots three days ago. Checked on her yesterday at the Mediterranean. I applied post-op ointment to prevent scabbing and infection.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [HOTEL ROOM] Dr. Malaga uses a swab and treats Julie Stern.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tony Malaga</strong>: (V.O.) She seemed, uh ... in good spirits.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p>(He smiles at Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: From the marks, it looks like you lasered over forty spots. In one session?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tony Malaga</strong>: (to Catherine) Well, post op, the patient's skin is very red and raw. It's really quite ugly, to be blunt. Most patients prefer to minimize the amount of time they spend in recovery.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So you supersized the procedure. You did it all in one sitting?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tony Malaga</strong>: It's perfectly safe.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: We'll need a copy of her medical records.</p>
<p>(Nick stares at Dr. Malaga. He turns to glance at Nick, but answers the question to Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tony Malaga</strong>: Oh, I'm sorry, but her file contains medical history of the family. I would be breaching doctor-patient confidentiality if I let you have that.</p>
<p>(Again, he smiles at Catherine. Catherine carefully brushes the hair away from her face and tentatively smiles back.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, uh, do you have a problem with me, doctor?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tony Malaga</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, there are two of us here and you're only addressing my colleague, so...</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tony Malaga</strong>: Well, she's a very beautiful woman. You have Venus de Milo aesthetics.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We'll be getting a court order for Ms. Stern's records.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tony Malaga</strong>: I'd appreciate that. </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. BECKMAN RESIDENCE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Sara examines the outside of the tented house. She snaps photos of the tent and of the clips holding the tent sides together.) </p>
<p>(She steps around the house and we see Greg also photographing the side of the house.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Sara.</p>
<p>(Sara takes a photo and walks over to Greg.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Looks like someone tampered with the tent.</p>
<p>(He pushes the tent aside to reveal a partially opened window.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Window's open.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, exterminators leave some windows open to help circulate the gas. This could have been the victim's way in.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Beckman pushes the window open. End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Once inside, he was overcome by the fumes.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The gas pump starts. Camera quick zooms following the hose from the pump truck, across the front lawn and to the inside of the house.) </p>
<p>(Beckman is inside the house as it begins to fill with gas. He coughs and crawls toward the door. He collapses.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: He must be an idiot to go inside a tented house.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Maybe he forgot something. Figured the gas had dissipated.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, assuming you're right, and he went in and never left, shouldn't the window be open wider?</p>
<p>(Sara looks at the window and tries to open it. It doesn't catch and slides back down.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It's old. The rope has snapped.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Okay. Now, Mr. Beckman never came out of the house. Why is there a trail of sand leading away from it and straight to the neighbor's house?</p>
<p>(Greg holds up the crime scene tape for Sara and they both head for the neighbor's house.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: That's a good question.</p>
<p>(Sara and Greg walk over and knock on the neighbor's back door.)</p>
<p>[INT. KENDELL RESIDENCE - BACK DOOR - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(The neighbor is coughing as he answers the back door.) </p>
<p><strong>Rory Kendell</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah, we're with the crime lab. We're investigating the death of your neighbor next door.</p>
<p><strong>Rory Kendell</strong>: Elliot? What happened?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: That's what we're trying to figure out.</p>
<p>(He coughs.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Have you been in his house recently?</p>
<p><strong>Rory Kendell</strong>: Look, man, I've been laid up for the past two days puking my guts out. I haven't left my place.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Do you live alone, Mr ... ?</p>
<p><strong>Rory Kendell</strong>: Rory Kendell. My wife bailed a few months ago.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Rory, have you felt dizzy or disoriented?</p>
<p><strong>Rory Kendell</strong>: How would you know?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We're going to need a urine sample.</p>
<p><strong>Rory Kendell</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: You may be suffering from sulfuryl fluoride gas poisoning. Urination's the only way for the poison to get out.</p>
<p><strong>Rory Kendell</strong>: I got the flu.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: If that's true, then your urine will be sulfuryl-flouride free.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: But if you're lying, &quot;you're in&quot; big trouble.</p>
<p>FADE OUT</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Nick is in the lab when Catherine walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What do Ozzy Osbourne, Iron Maiden and our victim all have in common?</p>
<p>(He hands her the file. Catherine looks through it.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Heavy metal.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Arsenic in her system, poisoning was chronic.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Looks like it began approximately three months ago.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Techs collected the ingestibles found at her home. None were contaminated.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Can tox confirm that arsenic poisoning was the cause of death?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Not yet. Until the quants come back, we won't know if the concentration was lethal.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: In poisoning cases, the killer's usually a relative.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Right. Someone with access to the victim.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (reading through file) Next-of-kin is an only child, a son. Who has a vineyard in Pahrump. </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(Catherine and Nick interview Kevin Stern, Julie Stern's son.) </p>
<p><strong>Kevin Stern</strong>: You sent a cop all the way to Pahrump to bring me in. What couldn't we discuss on the phone?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: When's the last time you saw your mother?</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Stern</strong>: It was about three months ago. She came to my vineyard for a visit.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: How'd that go?</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Stern</strong>: She left early. Said she felt sick.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: But you didn't think so.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Stern</strong>: Mom was uncomfortable around my four-year-old.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Why's that?</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Stern</strong>: He made her feel old.</p>
<p>(Nick looks away and nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: &quot;Grandma&quot; was a dirty word.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Stern</strong>: She could hardly look at him. It's nice, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mr. Stern, I also did a background check and you recently maxed out three credit cards.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Stern</strong>: My vines contracted black rot last spring. It's an expensive problem. Why are you checking my credit?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You're weren't worried about paying off your debt, were you?</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Stern</strong>: What the hell are you implying?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You're about to come into some money.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Stern</strong>: When my dad died, he left my mother boatloads of cash. On her last visit, I asked her for a loan.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Let me guess -- she turned you down.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Stern</strong>: She'd spend thousands on designer clothes, jewelry, plastic surgery ... but wouldn't lend me a dime.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Do you use pesticides on your grapevines?</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Stern</strong>: Yeah. Organic's a fad.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: We're going to need a sample of that.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Stern</strong>: Whatever. (He stands up ready to leave.) We done?</p>

<p><strong>Travis Watson</strong>: The pesticide is a copper-arsenate mix. It's chemically different than the arsenic ingested by Ms. Stern. And, FYI, that pesticide was outlawed by the EPA years ago. This guy is poisoning the soil.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So he's not a killer, he's a polluter.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What do you need, Brass?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, it may be elementary, but I have a conundrum. I just got back from the Four Aces. The hotel manager said Elliot tried to check in with his bird. The guy turned him down because he didn't have a cage, so supposedly Elliot went home to retrieve it, but neither he nor the bird ever returned.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Looks like we need to find that bird.</p>

[INT. BECKMAN RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(The door opens. Greg and Sara walk inside. They immediately split up and look around the area. Greg heads for the hallway to check out the bedrooms; Sara heads for the kitchen.) </p>
<p>[INT. BECKMAN RESIDENCE - KITCHEN -- DAY] </p>
<p>(From an open storage cabinet, flies buzz.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Greg.</p>
<p>(Greg walks up next to Sara and sees the flies. Lots and lots of flies.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Oh. There were no flies in here when we processed the house.</p>
<p>(Sara and Greg head for the c</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Fumigation kills all household insects, and it takes time for new flies to find a portal of entry.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, bird could've flown up somewhere and died.</p>
<p>(The flies are coming from the top shelf in the pantry. Sara gets a step ladder to check it out. She finds a dead rat.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Carcass with a fresh colony of maggots. The bird's not here; it's a dead rat.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Which means the macaw was either bird-napped or he flew the coop.</p>
<p>FADE OUT</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>

<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[INT. BUY BUY BIRDIE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Grissom walks into the bird shop and finds the Bird Shop Manager trying to teach the Cockatoo to speak.) </p>
<p><strong>Bird Shop Manager</strong>: I love you. <strong>Bird Shop Manager</strong>: I love you. <strong>Bird Shop Manager</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Teaching him to speak?</p>
<p><strong>Bird Shop Manager</strong>: Although the cockatoo is intelligent, birds don't speak. To speak requires a cognitive ability to understand, which they don't. They just imitate. And Edweena is a she. How can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm looking for a macaw.</p>
<p><strong>Bird Shop Manager</strong>: Well, you came to the right place. &quot;Buy Buy Birdie&quot;'s the only exotic bird store in Clark County. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Has anyone tried to sell you a macaw in the last few days?</p>
<p><strong>Bird Shop Manager</strong>: No. Why?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, I'm trying to locate a missing blue hyacinth.</p>
<p><strong>Bird Shop Manager</strong>: Very rare. In my whole career, I've only sold one.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Do you remember the buyer's name?</p>
<p><strong>Bird Shop Manager</strong>: Sure. Mr. Beckman. He's in here all the time. Bob likes to eat cashews out of my pocket. Mr. Beckman doesn't go anywhere without Bob.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mr. Beckman, um, died three days ago. We found these ... feathers in his house. </p>
<p>(He shows the Bird Shop Manager the photo of three feathers taken at the scene.) </p>
<p><strong>Bird Shop Manager</strong>: Tail feathers. That's not good.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Why is that?</p>
<p><strong>Bird Shop Manager</strong>: (worriedly) Macaws only molt one tail feather at a time. Get a pile like this, someone yanked. Real hard.</p>

[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Nick looks at the file results.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So, Dr. Malaga was telling the truth -- both women were poisoned. But that's not what killed them.</p>
<p><strong>Travis Watson</strong>: Yeah, so we can rule out arsenic as a cause of death.</p>
<p>(Catherine is sitting at the counter looking at the tube of blood.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, Travis? These are the vials from our decedents, right?</p>
<p>(He and Nick walk up to her.) </p>
<p><strong>Travis Watson</strong>: Yeah, I just finished with them yesterday. Why?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, the red blood cells haven't separated from the serum.</p>
<p><strong>Travis Watson</strong>: Is that relevant?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Maybe. I mean, normally, we'd see a yellow band of serum on top of the crimson blood. These vials are solid crimson.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Which means the red blood cells have lysed.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV of: Close-up of the red blood cells in the blood pop.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (V.O.) Something caused the red blood cells to lyse, or pop. The hemoglobin from inside those cells infiltrated the serum.</p>
<p>(End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: If a sufficient number of red blood cells lyse, a person dies.</p>
<p><strong>Travis Watson</strong>: So, what caused the lysis?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: We answer that question, we solve this case.</p>
<p>(Catherine puts the tube back on the rack.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Catherine and Nick walk through the hallway.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, the women were thirty years apart in age. They lived on different sides of town. They probably didn't know each other. But they both drank their own urine and were patients of Dr. Malaga's.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, were either one of their procedures sufficiently invasive as to compromise their blood?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (looks through the file) Well, last monday, two days before liver spot removal, Ms. Stern had a body wrap and ... hydrogen peroxide therapy.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (looks through Loakes' file) Ms. Loakes also underwent hydrogen peroxide therapy... on the same day? Here's the menu of services provided by the spa.<br />
(He looks at the brochure.) Let's see ... &quot;hydrogen peroxide therapy -- a three percent solution is injected directly into a client's vein, bathing the red blood cells in nourishing oxygen, boosting the immune system and reversing the signs of aging.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Question is, is it deadly?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, let's find out. I'll get the hydrogen peroxide.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'll get the blood.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay.</p>

<p>[INT. MARTIN RESIDENCE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Ted Martin answers the door. He finds Brass, Sara and Grissom outside.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Mr. Martin, we have a warrant to search your apartment. Please, stay with me. Stay ahead of me.</p>
<p>(They walk into the house.) </p>
<p><strong>Ted Martin</strong>: Look, if you guys tell me what you're looking for, maybe I can help you out, um ...</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Look, shut up and stay still.</p>
<p>(Sara opens a drawer in the kitchen. She opens a d cabinet and continues to look around. She opens the counter drawer and finds it filled with watches.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Brass? How many watches do you own?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Couple of sport, couple of dress. Why?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Mr. Martin has about twenty here.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Twenty?</p>
<p><strong>Ted Martin</strong>: I'm a collector.</p>
<p>(She picks up a woman's watch.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: This is a little small for your wrist, don't you think? </p>
<p>(She opens another drawer.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Several rings, a necklace, cufflinks and a gold pen. You know, these things all have one thing in common -- you can kind of slip them into your pocket. This is engraved -- &quot;Joan Arryington.&quot; I wonder what the odds are that Mrs. Arryington is a client of Oden Pest Control.</p>
<p>[INT. MARTIN'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(Grissom looks through the night stand drawers. He hears a bird squawk come from the bathroom.) </p>
<p>[INT. MARTIN'S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - DAY -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Grissom walks into the bathroom and opens the shower. He finds Bob in his cage.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (smiles) Hello, Bob.</p>
<p>(Bob squawks.) </p>
<p>[INT. MARTIN RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Grissom walks out with the cage.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Look what I found.</p>
<p>(Bob squawks.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I think we all know what happened here. After your buddies left, you were poking around Mr. Beckman's house. But he surprised you.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Elliot Beckman walks back to his house with Bob on his arm.</p>
<p><strong>Elliot Beckman</strong>: (mutters) A cage! I can't believe that manager.</p>
<p>(Mr. Beckman walks into the house.)</p>
<p>(In the study, Ted Martin goes through the desk when Elliott Beckman walks in.)</p>
<p><strong>Elliot Beckman</strong>: What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Ted Martin</strong>: Just getting ready for the fume.</p>
<p><strong>Elliot Beckman</strong>: You were rifling through my stuff ... </p>
<p><strong>Ted Martin</strong>: Oh, no, no, no, no, man. I was just making sure that everything, uh, was, is secure.</p>
<p><strong>Elliot Beckman</strong>: I'm going to call the police.</p>
<p>(Mr. Beckman walks into the living room and picks up the phone.) </p>
<p><strong>Elliot Beckman</strong>: (mutters) He can't do that. No, he can't.</p>
<p>(Ted hits Elliot Beckman in the face. Bob flutters around. Ted Martin grabs Bob.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Somehow, you managed to get the bird in the cage, seal the tent and release the gas.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Ted Martin turns the gas pump on. The gas starts to fill the house. Elliot Beckman comes to and starts suffocating on the gas. He tries to crawl along the floor. He drops his glasses and continues to crawl on the floor.)</p>
<p><strong>Elliot Beckman</strong>: Someone help me!</p>
<p>(Elliot Beckman continues to cough.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Despite his neighbor's best efforts, he was a goner.</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Here you go.</p>
<p>(She injects it into the tube of blood.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No effect.</p>
<p>(Nick fills the second syringe.) </p>

<p>(Catherine meets with Dr. Tony Malaga and his lawyer, Adam Matthews.) </p>
<p><strong>Adam Matthews</strong>: Dr. Malaga has not committed a crime.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: He injected a lethal batch of hydrogen peroxide into two of his patients.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Matthews</strong>: Even if that were true, you may have uncovered a very tragic accident, a very horrible mistake -- but certainly nothing criminal, or we'd be downtown right now. No A.D.A.'S going to prosecute. The procedures were elective. Catherine, you don't need me to tell you how many people die every day as a result of physician error.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, I am not talking about other people. I'm talking about Julie Stern and Renita Loakes.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tony Malaga</strong>: Yeah, both of whom looked in the mirror ... and wanted to turn back time.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: They put their trust in you because you're an M.D. Your professional degree made them feel safe.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Tony Malaga</strong>: All procedures carry a risk.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Is that what you tell yourself? And when you screw up again, what happens?</p>
<p><strong>Adam Matthews</strong>: His malpractice premiums go up.</p>

							<p>Control, this is One-David-Two.</p>
<p>I have a 444.</p>
<p>Officer down in the alley north of the 800 block of Rayson Street.</p>
<p>Requesting three backup units and paramedics.</p>
<p>I am in pursuit of the suspect.</p>
<p>Suspect is a white male, possibly armed, wearing dark clothing, traveling southbound toward Malpassat Road.</p>
<p>Officer down. Repeat.</p>
<p>Officer down.</p>
<p>Alley north of 800 block of Rayson Street.</p>
<p>Units four-five-one, four-five-six and four-five-seven, respond code three.</p>
<p>Officer down in the alley north of Rayson Street.</p>
<p>All officers respond.</p>
<p>Warrick...</p>
<p>Oh, God!</p>
<p>Stay with me! Warrick...</p>
<p>It's Grissom.</p>
<p>I was first on the scene.</p>
<p>Heard the shots. I was in pursuit...</p>
<p>...of the suspect.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>No, Warrick, come on.</p>
<p>Come on, Warrick!</p>
<p>Where are the paramedics?!</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>Come on, Warrick.</p>
<p>You got to fight. I need you to fight now.</p>
<p>Fight for me, okay?</p>
<p>Give me an ETA on the paramedics.</p>
<p>We need them here now.</p>
<p>No... No, come on.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I was on my way to the diner.</p>
<p>I was going to tell Warrick in person that he could keep his job.</p>
<p>I parked my car over there just before 4:30.</p>
<p>I started to walk west towards the diner.</p>
<p>I was in this area here when I heard the shots.</p>
<p>I saw a white adult male running north down the alley away from the vehicle.</p>
<p>I checked the vehicle-- observed CSI Brown bleeding from a gunshot wound.</p>
<p>It appeared to me he was dead.</p>
<p>So I went in pursuit of the suspect and called it in.</p>
<p>He got into a dark four-door sedan.</p>
<p>Late model.</p>
<p>Headed east on Malpassat Road.</p>
<p>I got a partial on the plate, George-Robert-Victor.</p>
<p>George-Robert-Victor...</p>
<p>George-Robert-Victor-</p>
<p>Zebra-9-0-3?</p>
<p>That's Officer Pritchard's car.</p>
<p>Was it a black Chrysler 300?</p>
<p>Uh...</p>
<p>Was it Pritchard you saw?</p>
<p>I only saw him for a second.</p>
<p>It was dark, but... but who else could it be?</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Have you photoed the body yet?</p>
<p>I haven't done anything.</p>
<p>Gil, how do you want to handle this?</p>
<p>I want us to do this, Conrad.</p>
<p>I want Nick and Catherine on the car.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I feel sorry for whoever did this.</p>
<p>Greg's coming back from the airport.</p>
<p>I told him to go straight to the lab.</p>
<p>We're going to have to take your clothes to get processed.</p>
<p>I'll drive you.</p>
<p>I'm going to go with Warrick.</p>
<p>Are you going to do the post?</p>
<p>No. I've asked the day shift ME to handle this one.</p>
<p>I, uh... need to do something.</p>
<p>You could, uh... pick up Warrick's clothes from the coroner.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I got a bullet.</p>
<p>Looks like a .25.</p>
<p>.25 auto pistol on the floor.</p>
<p>And a .25 shell casing right next to it.</p>
<p>Warrick's service weapon's still in evidence.</p>
<p>He didn't carry a backup.</p>
<p>It's got to be the murder weapon.</p>
<p>Leave the gun, take the cannoli.</p>
<p>This was a hit.</p>
<p>Looks like Pritchard's been taking lessons from Gedda.</p>
<p>There were at least two shots fired.</p>
<p>One of which came from inside the car.</p>
<p>Window was down.</p>
<p>I don't think the killer was sitting there.</p>
<p>I think he was standing out here.</p>
<p>He stuck the gun through the open window and fired.</p>
<p>If you're right, there should be GSR on that headliner.</p>
<p>It's positive for lead.</p>
<p>Why was the window down?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>It was a warm night.</p>
<p>If he wanted to get some air, why not... roll down his own window?</p>
<p>It's all hands on deck.</p>
<p>Right now I'm pulling everybody off whatever it is they're doing.</p>
<p>Warrick Brown is our only case, okay?</p>
<p>Officer Daniel Pritchard is our suspect.</p>
<p>The assignments are going to break down generally like this-- some of you go to the airport with photos.</p>
<p>If Pritchard tries to get on a plane, we grab him.</p>
<p>Now, Vegas highway patrol is already setting up roadblocks on all the roads leading out of the city.</p>
<p>Now, we have the addresses of his ex-wife, his family, his friends, all his known associates.</p>
<p>Most of you will be following those leads.</p>
<p>Now look under every rock.</p>
<p>If he's within spitting distance, I want him in custody immediately.</p>
<p>I got the first flight out.</p>
<p>He didn't want to go, Sara.</p>
<p>Tell me.</p>
<p>I was holding him.</p>
<p>God, I could feel his life.</p>
<p>I guess I felt if I could... hold him tight enough, he'd be okay.</p>
<p>You know there is nowhere in the world that he would've rather been at the end.</p>
<p>He loved you.</p>
<p>Yeah. I loved him.</p>
<p>I'm so sorry.</p>
<p>It's so good we can all be together.</p>
<p>I'm glad you're here.</p>
<p>Look, maybe I can pick up some of the slack.</p>
<p>I-I know I can't work the case, but maybe I can make some of the, uh... arrangements?</p>
<p>That'd be great.</p>
<p>I'll help you.</p>
<p>I'd appreciate that.</p>
<p>Since his grandmother passed, we were the only family he had.</p>
<p>He once told me he'd like to be buried next to her.</p>
<p>I went to her funeral with Warrick.</p>
<p>She's, uh, buried at the Baptist cemetery on Eastern.</p>
<p>We're going to need a... a key, I guess, to his place.</p>
<p>I've got one.</p>
<p>I went over to his place to get him some fresh clothes when he was in custody.</p>
<p>Warrick was right about Gedda.</p>
<p>And he was right about the department.</p>
<p>Let's finish this for him.</p>
<p>Hey, Jim.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>Look, uh, there's something I need to get off my chest.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>I know that you and Warrick were close.</p>
<p>And I don't want you to think that I had it in for the guy.</p>
<p>Why would I think that, Jeff?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm feeling guilty.</p>
<p>I thought Brown was a bad apple.</p>
<p>I was certain that he killed Gedda.</p>
<p>And I was wrong.</p>
<p>I know it's a little late for apologies, but I-I...</p>
<p>I just wanted to tell you.</p>
<p>Hey, we all have regrets.</p>
<p>I thought he killed Gedda, too.</p>
<p>You know what the last thing I told him was?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>&quot;I hope you remember how lucky you are.&quot;</p>
<p>Some luck, huh?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Looks like he never settled in.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Western Las Vegas University VS Stanford University, Sunday, May 18, 2008 at 2:05pm You know, after being in so many victims' houses, I never left my house without making the bed and taking out the trash, just in case I didn't come home.</p>
<p>What about now?</p>
<p>Since I left Vegas, I don't do that anymore.</p>
<p>See if you can find a tie.</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm on it.</p>
<p>Mr. Brown in Re: Paternity Results:....</p>
<p>Sara?</p>
<p>Child in Quetion: Eli Brewster Probability of Paternlty:99.999%</p>
<p>Warrick has a son.</p>
<p>Did you know?</p>
<p>He never mentioned it.</p>
<p>At least not to me.</p>
<p>This is from his attorney.</p>
<p>&quot;I have enclosed the DNA results which were filed with the court, &quot;along with a copy of your psych evaluation as ordered by the judge in connection with our battle to win custody of your son.&quot;</p>
<p>Gun's a dead end.</p>
<p>No prints, shooter wiped it down.</p>
<p>No recoverable DNA.</p>
<p>The serial number was filed down, but I got one on the grip.</p>
<p>Traced it back to an armed robbery.</p>
<p>Pritchard was the arresting officer.</p>
<p>The case was adjudicated, and according to the log, the gun was destroyed last July.</p>
<p>Or not.</p>
<p>Pritchard stole it from Central Property.</p>
<p>He had to have somebody on the inside to fudge the records.</p>
<p>Maybe Gedda's got another cop on the take.</p>
<p>But why would Pritchard kill Warrick with a gun that could be traced back to him?</p>
<p>'Cause he didn't care.</p>
<p>He's in the wind.</p>
<p>I got something.</p>
<p>When I rolled up the passenger side window, I found a cluster of impressions on the glass.</p>
<p>No ridge structure, so they're not fingerprints. They're... knuckle prints.</p>
<p>The stereo was turned down low.</p>
<p>The only fingerprints on the volume knob are Warrick's.</p>
<p>And... if you've ever ridden with him, you know he'd... he'd make your eardrums bleed.</p>
<p>So... volume turned down, knuckle prints on the glass.</p>
<p>I think the killer knocked on his window.</p>
<p>Well, Warrick would have never rolled down his window for Pritchard.</p>
<p>No. No, not after he'd just killed Gedda and he was trying to frame Warrick for the murder.</p>
<p>Are we saying it's not Pritchard?</p>
<p>I think we are.</p>
<p>McKeen.</p>
<p>He's the only eyewitness.</p>
<p>He's the one that placed somebody that looked like Pritchard in the alley.</p>
<p>He's the one that said the suspect got into a vehicle with a partial plate that was a match to Pritchard's.</p>
<p>There's something you need to see.</p>
<p>Has to wait.</p>
<p>We're going back to the alley.</p>
<p>It can't wait.</p>
<p>So what makes you think you'd be a good father?</p>
<p>You were raised by your grandmother.</p>
<p>You never even knew your biological father.</p>
<p>Which is exactly why Eli needs to know his.</p>
<p>Look, the most important thing you need to know to raise a child is how to give a child love.</p>
<p>And I've been loved.</p>
<p>Listen, I've always tried to be a good man.</p>
<p>I've screwed up.</p>
<p>And when I have, there's always been one man in my life that set me straight.</p>
<p>I've learned a lot from him.</p>
<p>How to be fair.</p>
<p>How to forgive.</p>
<p>How to be inspired.</p>
<p>How to inspire others.</p>
<p>That sounds like a special person.</p>
<p>He is.</p>
<p>If I could've picked my own father, I'd have picked him.</p>
<p>We're ready on this end.</p>
<p>McKeen said he was about 20 feet west of the alley when he heard the shots.</p>
<p>I'm there.</p>
<p>Let's do this.</p>
<p>Firing two.</p>
<p>Gil, what is it?</p>
<p>I just realized something-- there was music, loud music coming from here.</p>
<p>We need to do this again.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Come on back.</p>
<p>This is the volume level from around 4:00 a.m. last night.</p>
<p>Go ahead, Nicky!</p>
<p>Where are you?</p>
<p>I didn't hear any shots.</p>
<p>There's no way that McKeen heard those shots.</p>
<p>So why did he say he did?</p>
<p>He also implied that he saw Pritchard running away from Warrick's car.</p>
<p>But he never said it was Pritchard.</p>
<p>He led us to believe that though.</p>
<p>You know, when I first came to Vegas, over 20 years ago-- I haven't thought about this in a while-- Jeff McKeen was a detective then, he invited us all up to Mount Charleston to his cabin, you know, all the new guys.</p>
<p>Have a barbecue, we'll cook some steaks, have a few drinks, get to know each other, you know?</p>
<p>And it was a nice place, you know, but not too nice for detective pay.</p>
<p>I mean, my radar's already out because I came from Jersey, you know?</p>
<p>Guys... took more than they gave.</p>
<p>And they made an art form, how not to push it, how not to make it showy, you know.</p>
<p>Anyway, Jeff is sizing me up, he's sniffing around, he's telling me great Vegas is, how great it'd be for my career.</p>
<p>But I let him know, without busting his balls, that I wasn't in the game, I wasn't for sale.</p>
<p>And it's a good thing I took a look around up there at Mount Charleston, because I never got invited again.</p>
<p>No more barbecues for me.</p>
<p>Hm.</p>
<p><div class="ads ads-topic topic-content"><br />

<p><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div></p>
<p>First witness at the scene is the first suspect, right?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>When I told Warrick that Pritchard had framed him, he said that Gedda's mole had to be higher up on the food chain.</p>
<p>If I were McKeen, I would worry that Warrick would never let it go.</p>
<p>It'd take more than a beat cop to... get over that fat b*st*rd.</p>
<p>I'd think it's got to be somebody much higher up.</p>
<p>Let's say that McKeen saw the interview video.</p>
<p>From the time that Warrick left the PD to the time that Warrick got killed was, like, an hour, an hour and a half.</p>
<p>Is that enough time to frame Pritchard?</p>
<p>For all we know, Pritchard's not even in Vegas.</p>
<p>Yeah, but if Pritchard gets picked up somewhere else, that gives him an alibi, and McKeen is screwed.</p>
<p>Unless he knows exactly where Pritchard is.</p>
<p>I can't believe Bobby Cox is still managing.</p>
<p>What took you so long?</p>
<p>I'm starving here.</p>
<p>I thought I was clear with you.</p>
<p>About what?</p>
<p>Where's my food?</p>
<p>I told you not to leave the room.</p>
<p>I didn't.</p>
<p>T's honor.</p>
<p>Why would I leave the room?</p>
<p>I'm trying to leave the country.</p>
<p>You killed Brown on the way out.</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>But now you made a mess, and I got to clean it up.</p>
<p>You think I killed Brown?</p>
<p>Come on, who else?</p>
<p>I just framed the guy-- why would I want him dead; I wanted him in jail.</p>
<p>If I wanted him dead, I would've shot him in Pigalle instead of going through all this freakin' crap.</p>
<p>The murder weapon was traced back to one of your cases.</p>
<p>What case?</p>
<p>What are you talking about?</p>
<p>An armed robbery, I believe.</p>
<p>A .25.</p>
<p>Judge ordered it destroyed.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>That gun.</p>
<p>Look, you can blame everything on me when I'm in Mexico, but I'm not in Mexico yet.</p>
<p>Killing you might just be easier.</p>
<p>Then do it.</p>
<p>You shoot me here... you're gonna have a lot of explaining to do.</p>
<p>We going to Mexico, or what?</p>
<p>Gil, you take this to the wrong judge, and McKeen finds out he's being investigated, he'll stick a fork in all of us.</p>
<p>I think that's a risk we're all willing to take.</p>
<p>Well, all I'm saying is, let's be smart about it.</p>
<p>Get more evidence.</p>
<p>We got what we got.</p>
<p>Knuckle prints on glass.</p>
<p>Yeah, but knuckle prints can't be individualized.</p>
<p>Even if we had exemplars, we couldn't exclude Pritchard or include McKeen.</p>
<p>All right, wh-what about the murder weapon?</p>
<p>We printed it, swabbed it for DNA.</p>
<p>It was wiped clean.</p>
<p>The gun was evidence in an armed robbery case, right?</p>
<p>Was there any ammo with it?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>So if McKeen lifted the gun from Evidence, he still had to load it.</p>
<p>No prints on the magazine.</p>
<p>What about the bullets?</p>
<p>A .25?</p>
<p>We've never gotten prints off a cartridge that small.</p>
<p>That is one tiny partial.</p>
<p>This may be f-four millimeters.</p>
<p>So we got one shot.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So don't screw it up, right?</p>
<p>Just enough for a comparison.</p>
<p>Here, compare it to Pritchard's ten card.</p>
<p>It's not Pritchard's print.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mandy.</p>
<p>I need you to step out.</p>
<p>You're kidding, right?</p>
<p>No, I'm not.</p>
<p>NO MATCH POSITIVE MATCH No, Your Honor, we all understand the gravity of this situation.</p>
<p>But we're under a lot of pressure, and we have to move fast.</p>
<p>No, I didn't call the mayor--</p>
<p>I wanted to call you first.</p>
<p>He's not at home, he's not at work, and if we tip him off, he'll run.</p>
<p>Judge... Judge...</p>
<p>I wouldn't call you for a warrant if I wasn't sure.</p>
<p>I need you to pull McKeen's phone records.</p>
<p>The undersheriff?</p>
<p>The last 24 hours, all incoming calls.</p>
<p>Eliminate any that are work-related, from a PD number.</p>
<p>Three calls from the same number.</p>
<p>Do a reverse look-up.</p>
<p>Whiskey Bend.</p>
<p>That's a place you go to get lost.</p>
<p>He recognized McKeen.</p>
<p>Said he paid cash.</p>
<p>Wasn't staying here-- it was for his buddy.</p>
<p>&quot;Do not disturb, &quot;give me a break.</p>
<p>Okay, go ahead.</p>
<p>Okay, come on.</p>
<p>It's clear, Captain.</p>
<p>Ice in the glass.</p>
<p>Wet towel.</p>
<p>We just missed him.</p>
<p>Pick a station and go with it.</p>
<p>You're driving me crazy.</p>
<p>It's all country.</p>
<p>I don't like country.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, at least they're all in English.</p>
<p>Bienvenidos a Mexico, my friend.</p>
<p>ID's confirmed.</p>
<p>Pritchard was in the room.</p>
<p>McKeen's had this room for four days.</p>
<p>Pritchard's probably been holed up here ever since he killed Gedda.</p>
<p>Pritchard's his problem solver.</p>
<p>McKeen is protecting him.</p>
<p>Not anymore.</p>
<p>He killed Warrick.</p>
<p>Now he needs a fall guy.</p>
<p>Which makes Pritchard a dead man.</p>
<p>Hey, Jeff, it's Jim Brass.</p>
<p>Well, looks like Pritchard is our guy.</p>
<p>All the evidence points that way.</p>
<p>No, we're still looking.</p>
<p>I'll put an APB out on him right away.</p>
<p>Keep you posted.</p>
<p>Yeah, Brass is talking to him now.</p>
<p>Archie's working on triangulating his cell.</p>
<p>Jeff, you're breaking up.</p>
<p>Are you in your car?</p>
<p>Yeah, sure, get some rest.</p>
<p>The press is gonna want a statement from you when we bring Pritchard into custody.</p>
<p>McKeen's with Pritchard.</p>
<p>You have his 20?</p>
<p>Not yet.</p>
<p>Got him.</p>
<p>He just moved from tower eight to tower nine.</p>
<p>He's heading east on Boulder Highway about a mile west of Highway 166.</p>
<p>Let me know when you got him, Jim.</p>
<p>Got who?</p>
<p>Relax.</p>
<p>What happens when we get to the state line?</p>
<p>Every cop in Nevada's got a picture of my mug.</p>
<p>Don't worry about it.</p>
<p>I got a radio on.</p>
<p>Anything happens, I'll hear about it.</p>
<p>I'm the undersheriff, remember?</p>
<p>Nobody's gonna search my car.</p>
<p>In 12 hours, you'll be sitting on a beach in Mexico sipping margaritas.</p>
<p>What's so freakin' funny?</p>
<p>What, are you gonna shoot me going 80 miles an hour?</p>
<p>You think I'd let you get in this car with a loaded gun?</p>
<p>Just sit back and enjoy the ride.</p>
<p>Air One, this is Captain Brass.</p>
<p>Air One here.</p>
<p>Do you have a visual?</p>
<p>Affirmative. We're about three miles behind him.</p>
<p>Stay on radio frequency tac three.</p>
<p>In case he has his radio on, we don't want to tip him off.</p>
<p>Copy that.</p>
<p>The green is Nick?</p>
<p>Yeah. He and Brass are on his tail.</p>
<p>Air One at your six.</p>
<p>All ground units be advised your next is in 90.</p>
<p>Hairpin right. Easy speed.</p>
<p>What's happening?</p>
<p>Nick, McKeen's vehicle has stopped.</p>
<p>Where is he?</p>
<p>You should be right on top of him.</p>
<p>Either McKeen threw his phone out or he pulled over. He's just ahead of us.</p>
<p>Nick... cover him.</p>
<p>Control, this is Brass.</p>
<p>One-David-Two's vehicle has broke through a guardrail and gone into a gully near mile marker 114.</p>
<p>Send additional backup and paramedics.</p>
<p>Copy that. We're notify backup and EMS.</p>
<p>Got a .357 magnum.</p>
<p>McKeen carries a nine.</p>
<p>Looks like Pritchard's got a broken neck.</p>
<p>No holes in him.</p>
<p>Control, this is Brass.</p>
<p>Pritchard is dead and David-Two's on the run, armed and dangerous, possibly injured. We're in pursuit.</p>
<p>Copy that, Captain Brass.</p>
<p>Will advise.</p>
<p>D2 is on the run.</p>
<p>D2 is on the run.</p>
<p>Nick, Nick this is Brass.</p>
<p>Come in.</p>
<p>Go to channel three.</p>
<p>Nick?</p>
<p>We're on channel three.</p>
<p>You copy?</p>
<p>Stokes, thank God you're here.</p>
<p>I was trying to bring Pritchard in.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>He got the drop on me.</p>
<p>He grabbed my gun.</p>
<p>I lost control.</p>
<p>I said shut up!</p>
<p>Air One, Air One, come in.</p>
<p>This is Brass.</p>
<p>Air One, Air One, do you copy?</p>
<p>Air one here.</p>
<p>There are four of us.</p>
<p>We spread out.</p>
<p>We're all heading due west.</p>
<p>CSI Stokes is in the lead.</p>
<p>We're looking for a visual on McKeen. Can you verify?</p>
<p>Stand by.</p>
<p>Air One confirm visual.</p>
<p>CSI Stokes has located the suspect and has him at gunpoint 300 yards due west of your position.</p>
<p>Copy that.</p>
<p>Okay, you want to know why I did it?</p>
<p>Warrick had a big mouth, and I had to shut it.</p>
<p>I tried to warn him, but he was just too stupid to listen.</p>
<p>You know, when I shot him, he had a big... smile on his face.</p>
<p>I told him he could keep his job.</p>
<p>I didn't have the heart to fire him.</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>He was your friend.</p>
<p>What kind of friend are you?!</p>
<p>Shoot me, you son of a bitch!</p>
<p>Nick?</p>
<p>McKeen has a gunshot wound to the stomach.</p>
<p>He's lost a lot of blood-- we should get the medevac chopper here ASAP.</p>
<p>What was that shot?</p>
<p>A miss.</p>
<p>Jeffrey McKeen, you're under arrest for the murder of Warrick Brown.</p>
<p>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil for thou art with me.</p>
<p>Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.</p>
<p>Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies.</p>
<p>Thou anointest my head with oil.</p>
<p>My cup runneth over.</p>
<p>Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.</p>
<p>Amen.</p>
<p>As crime scene investigators, we meet people on the worst day of their lives.</p>
<p>They've just lost a family member, somebody they loved, often in a horrible way.</p>
<p>A piece of their heart is gone and will never be replaced.</p>
<p>The phrase we're trained to offer them, &quot;I'm sorry for your loss,&quot; as we know now, doesn't offer much.</p>
<p>Warrick Brown was a young boy when his parents passed away.</p>
<p>Much too young to learn that life can be so tragically short.</p>
<p>But I think that it taught him how precious life is, and so he lived his life to the fullest each day as if it was his last day.</p>
<p>I was with Warrick on his last day.</p>
<p>All the qualities that defined him-- his tenaciousness, his deep sense of loyalty, his courage... to risk his life for what he knew was right.</p>
<p>All those traits were with him on that last day.</p>
<p>Just before he died... we were all having breakfast together-- our team... his friends... his family.</p>
<p>And Warrick was... he was... I'm gonna miss him so much.</p>

<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Thunder rumbles.)</p>
<p>[EXT. UNDER THE BRIDGE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Under the bridge, homeless people keep warm by the flames of the burning barrels. Hookers and drug addicts try to keep warm.)</p>
<p>(A car drives by slowly and pulls up along side the curb. The hookers are already peering in through the car window asking questions.)</p>
<p>(Nothing.)</p>
<p>(The car drives off and slows down in front of another group of men. The car continues.)</p>
<p>(The man behind the wheel continues driving. He turns the corner and parks. He gets out of the car, shuts the door and looks down below at the group of people standing below.)</p>
<p>(He makes his way toward them.)</p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
[LATER]</p>
<p>(Camera opens on the dead man lying face-up with bloodied stab wounds in his chest. GRISSOM and BRASS kneel down next to the body looking it over.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No watch, no wallet, no shoes. This guy was picked clean.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: In this neighborhood, he's lucky to have the fillings in his teeth.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM checks.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Still there.</p>
<p>(BRASS shakes his head and smiles. GRISSOM notices the MAN'S fingernails.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This guy was well-groomed.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I don't care if he was lemon-scented and martinized, if he was on Washington and D, he was copping. He should have just said no.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at the group of people standing nearby not caring that there's a dead body right there.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Maybe somebody wouldn't take no for an answer.</p>
<p>FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. JUNKYARD -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(CATHERINE, SARA and DET. CAVALIERE make their way toward the body.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, how long have you been in Vegas, Detective Cavaliere?</p>
<p><strong>Det. Cavaliere</strong>: Couple of weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Welcome to Tranny-town. This is where the hustlers come.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Cavaliere</strong>: Yeah, I can see why. It's very romantic.</p>
<p>(They reach the body. SARA puts her kit down. They all step forward toward the body tucked inside a huge tire.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: This is new.</p>
<p>(DET. CAVALIERE snaps a picture. The flash startles SARA and she turns to look at him.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. Cavaliere</strong>: Don't get territorial. It's for my own personal collection.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Whatever blows your skirt up. Burn me a copy.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: There's a small cut on the forehead.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, it looks like he's wearing makeup. Blush on the cheeks ... lipstick.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Transvestite. Fits the profile.</p>
<p>(She looks up at the junked bus nearby.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Honeymoon suite's across the way. Anonyms s*x becomes anonymous s*x crime.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Murder usually personal.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Maybe whoever had the last dance left behind a corsage.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'd settle for his clothes.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Cavaliere</strong>: Hey, I'll give you a hand.</p>
<p>(DET. CAVALIERE and SARA stand up and move away. DAVID PHILLIPS settles in next to CATHERINE. He looks over the tire.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: You think a hacksaw's going to do the trick?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No. But that's why god invented sawzalls.</p>
<p>(Cut to: CATHERINE works at cutting the top of the tire off to expose the body. DAVID stands aside and watches.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: SARA and DET. CAVALIERE head toward the bus and step inside. They look around and find the place a mess, discarded used condoms on the seat.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: CATHERINE gets the tire cut through and the CORONERS remove the body from the tire and put it down on a plastic sheet on the ground.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: SARA and DET. CAVALIERE examine the contents in the bus.)</p>
<p>(Dissolve to: SARA finds a naked, decapitated Barbie doll on the bedsheet.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: CATHERINE waits for DAVID to finish with the body. SARA and DET. CAVALIERE join them.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: All we got is a decapitated doll.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: That's still legal in Nevada.</p>
<p>(They look at the body and notice that DAVID'S been awfully quiet.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Dave, what's up? You find something?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: I was just thinking I wouldn't be caught dead in those shorts.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. UNDER THE BRIDGE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(OFFICER cars surround the area. WARRICK tries to work as the HOOKERS nearby watch.) </p>
<p><strong>Hooker</strong>: Yo, baby, look, why're you rushing the day? We got plenty of night left.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'm working, lady.</p>
<p><strong>Hooker</strong>: See, that's something we already got in common, 'cause I'm working, too.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Oh, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Hooker</strong>: mm-Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Were you working him?</p>
<p>(WARRICK turns to indicate the dead body.)</p>
<p><strong>Hooker</strong>: Him? No. No, sir. But I tell you one thing. Good-looking white boy like that? I know plenty of women who'd be tripping over their platform to get a little somethin' somethin'. But no, sir, he wasn't nobody's customer.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Really?</p>
<p>(The HOOKER nods. WARRICK goes back to the body where GRISSOM is.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: This guy get here on foot? I don't see a car.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: They haven't found one yet.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I suppose nobody saw it drive away.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: They were all in the bathroom.</p>
<p>(He and WARRICK look out at the gathering crowd.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(ROBBINS goes over the body with GRISSOM.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Multiple stab wounds. The deepest of which transected the thoracic aorta and the right mainstream bronchus.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: His name is Ed Burnell. Matched his prints, prior for possession. And it's not the first time he stared death in the face. Our man had a double dose of cirrhosis. That takes work. Years of hard-core alcohol abuse, plus hepatitis, probably acquired by dirty needles.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: In Chinese medicine, the liver is the organ of anger. Addicts and alcoholics medicate their anger, consequently, destroy their liver.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Actually, half the liver is pretty healthy.</p>
<p>(ROBBINS reaches for the side and puts a metal tray with a new liver on the body to show GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: The new half.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Oh ... a graft from a less angry donor.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Organ recipient procedure is pretty clear. They only do transplants on people who test clean for a year.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, he probably got his new liver, figured he could, uh, start all over again.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Is that what you think? That once an addict, always an addict?</p>
<p>(They share a look.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - LAB] </p>
<p>(GREG checks the body's underwear as CATHERINE instructs him.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Don't let the scope touch the garment. You don't want to contaminate the evidence. And work systematically. </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Up-down, left-right, what?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, Well, whatever works for you. Just don't miss any spots. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE sees something on the monitor.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: All right, hang on. What do those look like to you?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Semen stains.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yes. </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Which, on a man's underwear, aren't exactly probative.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No. </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Can't tell you how long they've been there, or how often the guy changes his shorts. You know, I knew guys that could go up to four days on one single pair of tighty-whities.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Thanks for putting that picture in my brain. </p>
<p>(GREG nods.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: All right, so ... </p>
<p>(She uncaps a pen.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I want you to outline each individual stain with dots. But keep them at least an eighth of an inch from the edge to avoid contamination.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: And then, cut out the swatches and send them to myself in DNA. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p>(She leaves the pen and heads out of the lab.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Extreme close up of something in hair. Camera pulls back and we see something is being removed from the body's nose.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: A fiber in his nose.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah, I'll get it to trace.</p>
<p>(SARA puts the fiber in a baggie. She checks the eyes.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Petechial hemorrhaging.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I would've thought he was strangled during some kind of rough sex-play, but there's no marks.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Suffocation maybe?</p>
<p>(In the back of the room, DAVID is working on another body. He overhears and can't help but comment.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: That's why undertakers love smother-victims.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: He's got something under his nails.</p>
<p>(SARA takes another instrument to dig out the stuff from his nails.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Looks like silver paint.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE notices the shadow on the man's eyes.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Vegas brow. (SARA looks at CATHERINE. She shrugs.) A showgirl thing. Eyebrows thin out from all the plucking and waxing and filling in.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, we can kind of rule him out as a showgirl.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: And, you know, he's hairy for a drag queen. Hey, David?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Could you hit the lights?</p>
<p>(SARA reaches for the ALS as DAVID PHILLIPS reaches for the lights.)</p>
<p>(As she shines the light on his face, the make-up removed shines through.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: His face looks painted. (SARA nods.) Kinda looks like a clown.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and SARA share a look.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. ROAD -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(EMERGENCY CREWS work to cut JAMAL out from the car. He's drugged up and stuck in the car wreck, his mouth going off loudly and a mile-a- minute.) </p>
<p><strong>Jamal</strong>: Yo, man, get these spiders off my face, man! I gotta beam up outta here. I need my medication. I'm a CEO of a five-bag-a-day corporation, you know that? </p>
<p>(The door opens. JAMAL looks at the OFFICERS.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Uh, come on. Let's go.</p>
<p>(They help him out of the car.)</p>
<p><strong>Jamal</strong>: Thank you. </p>
<p>(The officers hold on onto him in front of WARRICK and BRASS.)</p>
<p><strong>Jamal</strong>: (laughs) Y'all look like cartoons, man. Okay, thank you.</p>
<p>(JAMAL extracts himself out of the OFFICER'S grips and nearly falls down.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Take it easy, pal. You're not running the four-minute mile on those pins.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Nice shoes.</p>
<p><strong>Jamal</strong>: It's all good, it's all good.</p>
<p>(The officers help him onto the gurney where JAMAL finally gets a good look at the damage to the car.)</p>
<p><strong>Jamal</strong>: Whoa! Who gonna pay for that hole in my ride, man?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Your ride? This was never your ride. This car belongs to Ed Burnell.</p>
<p><strong>Jamal</strong>: Finders keepers, baby. I gotta bag me some ho's.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What drug is he on?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I don't know. Whatever it is, he either took too much or not enough.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - EARLY MORNING]</p>
<p>[EXT. BUILDING - HALLWAY -- MORNING]</p>
<p>(SARA and CATHERINE walk down the hallway toward the BUDDY WEEK, CLOWN AGENCY.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Just 'cause the guy looks like a clown doesn't mean he is a clown.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Description didn't match anyone in missing persons. If you've got a better idea, now's the time.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE opens the door and walks inside. SARA follows and closes the door behind her.)</p>
<p>[INT. BUDDY WEEN CLOWN AGENCY - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and SARA make their way to the office where BUDDY WEEN yells on the phone. They pass by several clowns sitting in the waiting room.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'd say we're in the right place.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah. Either that or they're casting a John Wayne Gacey revue.</p>
<p><strong>Buddy Ween</strong>: (to phone) And you can tell that putz that Buddy Ween doesn't send cruise ship talent for bar mitzvah wages. You got that? (He hangs up, looks at them and points.) Uh, strippers are down the hall, girls. This is clowns.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (dryly) No kidding.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE shows him her I.D.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm Catherine Willows. This is Sara Sidle. We're with the crime lab.</p>
<p><strong>Buddy Ween</strong>: Well, why didn't you say so? We do lots of police parties. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The party has already happened. </p>
<p>(She shows him the photo of the dead clown.)</p>
<p><strong>Buddy Ween</strong>: What am I supposed to do with this?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Identify the body. Did that man ever work for you?</p>
<p><strong>Buddy Ween</strong>: Well, let me put it this way: I rep clowns. (He points to the clowns in the waiting room.) That's Flappy, that's Flappy Junior, that's Allen ... he doesn't work that much ... Popo ... get it? All I do is book the face. I don't care what's underneath.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: If our victim was a professional clown, would he be in this book?</p>
<p><strong>Buddy Ween</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What are these numbers for?</p>
<p>(She indicates the numbers under the photos in the book.)</p>
<p><strong>Buddy Ween</strong>: That's the national clown and character registry.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: How do you register a clown?</p>
<p><strong>Buddy Ween</strong>: Well, not the clown. The look, the face. Each one is unique. It's like snowflakes.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We're going to need to take this with us.</p>
<p><strong>Buddy Ween</strong>: You got a warrant? I'm kidding. Okay, it's just a loaner, though.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. HOSPITAL -- EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(JAMAL is on the bed, his foot up in traction, and his mouth continuing to yell loudly.)</p>
<p><strong>Jamal</strong>: I know you stealin' my medication. I am in pain, damn it! Bring me some stuff! </p>
<p>(He looks up at the nurse down the hall who doesn't move. GRISSOM and WARRICK both stand at the foot of JAMAL'S bed. He stares at them.)</p>
<p><strong>Jamal</strong>: What are you two ladies lookin' at?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Uh ... (reading) Jamal ... we're with the Las Vegas crime lab. It seems you were driving a dead man's car when you got in your accident.</p>
<p><strong>Jamal</strong>: Half the peoples I know be dead. It don't mean they can't own a vehicle.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey, Vanilla Ice ... at this point you're lookin' at a murder rap, which may end you up on death row, and I'm not talking about the record label.</p>
<p><strong>Jamal</strong>: (shouting) Nurse, this be cruel and unusual!</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Look, pal, right now the evidence tells us that you killed the man whose car you were driving. You want to explain that?</p>
<p><strong>Jamal</strong>: Explain what, B? I was laid up shootin' speedballs all day. Look, man, when I get off, I'm gone. Feel me? I can't see nothin', I can't hear nothin'. Wherever high is, that's where I take the elevator up.</p>
<p>(The nurse pushes past GRISSOM and WARRICK to attend to JAMAL. He looks at her and starts criticizing her.)</p>
<p><strong>Jamal</strong>: Oh, you damn cow! Took you long enough. When I call you, you come, you understand me?</p>
<p>(She pushes the contents of a syringe into his I.V.)</p>
<p><strong>Jamal</strong>: Why you got to do me like this? That's right. (panting) Man's dead. What difference it make how he got there? Now, if you'll excuse me, I got a date with Mrs. Jones. (sighs) Man's already dead. Why he be needing shoes, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Was that a confession?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I think a plea of insanity.</p>
<p>FADE OUT</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - GARAGE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(The car is in the garage. WARRICK opens the front passenger door and waves away the fumes inside. He looks through it and finds an unopened condom on the dash. GREG hangs just outside the door.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: DNA results on the blood from Jamal's clothes. It's his own.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, the blood spatter's consistent with a front end collision.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: So he didn't kill him in the car.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Doesn't mean he didn't kill him. What I want to know is how's a strung-out junkie like Jamal get a guy out of the car with just his knife?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yeah, and why stab him six times?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, let's just say for argument's sake that Jamal is telling the truth and that Burnell was already dead when he took his wallet, his shoes and his car.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, if the motive wasn't robbery ... what was it?</p>
<p>(WARRICK finds a small packet of powder in the middle of the car.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Maybe this'll tell us.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - DNA LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(GREG tests the contents of the package. He puts a sample of it under a scope. GRISSOM walks up to him.) </p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So you know him.</p>
<p><strong>Buddy Ween</strong>: There are two kinds of clowns: There's your ex-circus pros, washed out of Ringling Bros., Barnum and Bailey, and then there's your basic chuckleheads.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Which kind was Doodles?</p>
<p><strong>Buddy Ween</strong>: Basic chucklehead. You know, buy a getup, learn some tricks, and grab some scratch boring the crap out of nine-year-olds. He was a good birthday man, except when he, uh ...</p>
<p>(He motions drinking with his hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So, he made money boring kids?</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, that makes sense.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: It does?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, the substance we found in his car was ibogaine.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What's that, the stuff that grows hair?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: A choline-esterase inhibitor that acts as a stimulant in the central nervous system. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM hands BRASS a piece of paper for him to look at.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: In the liver, it converts to an active metabolite ... noribogaine. Noribogaine locks onto addiction receptors ... blocking the feedback loops that reinforce dependency.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: In human speak?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, apparently, in some cases, one dose of ibogaine can cure physical addiction.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Does it come with a free set of steak knives?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It comes with a free trip. Curing physical addiction is a side effect. Its intended use is to facilitate visual, tactile, and auditory experiences of alternate realities.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So it's an hallucinogen.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mm-hmm. Used by the Bwiti tribe of Central Africa. It comes from the powdered bark of a tree growing in Cameroon.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: A huge bon fire probably in Central Africa. End of quick flash. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No kidding.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Many ethno-botanists believe that the iboga is what the bible is talking about when it refers to the tree of knowledge.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: A huge bon fire probably in Central Africa. Several young men drink from a bowl, most probably of the Bwiti tribe.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) The Bwiti consume the powdered bark as part of an initiation ceremony. </p>

<p>(They turn away from the door and he leads them down the hall.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: And despite the fact that San Quentin is your alma mater and you have a record as long as my leg, you wouldn't do anything illegal, right?</p>
<p><strong>Worker (man)</strong>: I wouldn't do anything to jeopardize this place, and we don't give out illegal drugs. We do a lot of good work here.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know, if ibogaine is such a miracle cure, wouldn't it make your life easier?</p>
<p><strong>Worker (man)</strong>: The drug doesn't promise anything. You got to earn it. If a user doesn't realize why he used in the first place, I mean, no power in the world is going to make him stop. Right here is a good case in point. </p>

(She puts the test results on the table in front of her.) DNA on his boxer shorts indicates that you had s*x with him. We checked with the Buddy Ween Agency, and, uh, you hire clowns on a fairly regular basis: Four, five, six times a year. That's a lot of clowns.</p>
<p><strong>Merrill Maguire</strong>: I already told you. I like clowns.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I think you like them more than most people.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [BEDROOM] DOODLES falls down backward on the bed. MERRILL MAGUIRE crawls on top of him and they start kissing.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to next interview room.)</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM B] </p>
<p>(SARA and DET. CAVALIERE interview AL MAGUIRE.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Mr. Maguire, I hate to tell you this, but while you were off driving the other kiddies home, your wife was doing the clown.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Cavaliere</strong>: We figured you must've walked in on them ... in flagrante.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [BEDROOM] AL MAGUIRE walks in on his wife with DOODLES. He rushes up to them and breaks it up.) </p>
<p><strong>Al Maguire</strong>: My wife!</p>
<p>(He grabs the pillow and smothers DOODLES.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to CATHERINE'S interview.)</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM A] </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You stripped the body and dumped it in an area frequented by transvestites, hoping that it would just... go away. Another forgotten s*x crime. You covered your tracks. You cleaned the house. You washed that pillowcase. What I don't understand, though ... why did you keep the clown suit?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE puts the photos of the clown suit on the table.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [BEDROOM] MERRILL holds up the clown jacket and looks at AL. She smiles at him.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to SARA'S interview.)</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM B] </p>
<p><strong>Al Maguire</strong>: You don't understand. Merrill and I have been married nine years. We have two kids. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Not much left to get excited about? </p>
<p><strong>Al Maguire</strong>: I love my wife.</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM A] </p>
<p><strong>Merrill Maguire</strong>: When Al wore the suit ... it worked ... and it was good. If you found something that got you off ... wouldn't you keep it?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE smiles.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI -- LAB] </p>
<p>(WARRICK picks up MINDY'S panties off the table.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Man, there is something so heartbreaking about a woman with raggedy drawers.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>(NICK tests the clothes for GSR.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Grissom, we've gone through all of Mindy's stuff twice. There's no trace of blood.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Doesn't make any sense. If she disposes of her clothes, she's not just going to forget about the knife.</p>
<p>(GREG walks into the lab.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Hey, guys, got a male DNA skin sample collected from Mindy's hair.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Burnell?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yes and no. The blood is Burnell's, but the skin belongs to another guy.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Do we know who?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: The gods of CODIS have blessed us with a hit: Riley &quot;Boom-Boom&quot; Renaldo, proud owner of two assault and battery charges and a possession with intent to distribute.</p>
<p>(GREG reads off the rap sheet.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Current occupation: Apartment manager.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What do you bet Boom Boom's estate is on the corner of Washington and D Street?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Renaldo was Mindy's landlord?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: That'd make her a bag-bride ... a strawberry. Paid her rent horizontally. As long as a dealer keeps a strawberry high, the strawberry does whatever the dealer wants.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: MINDY is face down on the bed, her eyes staring out blankly at nothing in front of her. RILEY REYNOLDO is behind her. He digs his fingers into her hair pulling her head up. Camera close up of the skin sample in her hair.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CRACKHOUSE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(BRASS, GRISSOM and WARRICK walk up to the CRACKHOUSE. BRASS pounds on the door.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Las Vegas Police. Open up.</p>
<p>(The door opens. RILEY RENALDO puts his shirt on. Behind him, another woman walks out of the bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>Crackhead Girl</strong>: Riley ... you said I could have a taste when we were done. Riley!</p>
<p><strong>Riley Renaldo</strong>: Shut up, sunshine.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Nice. We keep Mindy for a couple of hours, and you've already moved on.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What's the matter? Lose faith in Mindy? She always comes back to you.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Guess Burnell was bad for business, huh?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [ED BURNELL'S CAR] The door opens and MINDY DUPON slips inside. He drives off as RILEY RENALDO watches them. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, old Ed gets enough people in the 'hood clean, you get no love.</p>
<p><strong>Crackhead Girl</strong>: Riley ... I need it.</p>
<p><strong>Riley Renaldo</strong>: I said shut up.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mindy didn't need it anymore, right? That's why you helped her remember.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [CLOSE UP of a packet of drugs] RILEY holds the packet out in front of MINDY.)</p>
<p><strong>Mindy Dupont</strong>: I don't need that anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Riley Renaldo</strong>: What do you mean, you don't need it? </p>
<p><strong>Mindy Dupont</strong>: Just one more, and that's it.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Burnell wasn't hard to find, was he?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [CRACKHOUSE] The door opens and a DRUG ADDICT reports to RILEY.</p>
<p><strong>Drug Addict</strong>: Yo, man ... that jackass who be messin' with Mindy is back ... </p>
<p>(Cut to: [NIGHT] RILEY turns and walks toward ED BURNELL who is looking for MINDY.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: RILEY removes the bloody knife from ED BURNELL'S dead body. He walks away leaving him there.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Riley Renaldo</strong>: (smiling) You've got nothing on me.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, we do: Burnell's blood on your skin.</p>
<p>(BRASS steps forward and leads RILEY RENALDO out of the house.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, come on, let's go, let's go. Come on, you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say ... </p>
<p><strong>Riley Renaldo</strong>: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns back and sees the CRACKHEAD GIRL slowly slide down the wall to sit on the floor.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It's her choice, right?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (nods) Unfortunately.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What do you want to do, take her to lock up?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Lateral move. She's already there.</p>
<p>(They both turn and walk away.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />

<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(The officer leads RILEY RENALDO down the hallway to be processed. MINDY DUPONT watches. GRISSOM walks up to her.) </p>
<p><strong>Mindy Dupont</strong>: One guy's dead. One guy's going to jail.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, you're free to go.</p>
<p><strong>Mindy Dupont</strong>: Go where?</p>
<p>(MINDY turns and slowly walks out. GRISSOM watches her leave.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. CSI - PARKING LOT -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks out of the building. She stops and sees the car parked on the curb waiting for her.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You got my message.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bezich</strong>: Yeah. You sounded hungry. I was thinking ... dinner at the Bellagio.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (smiling) All right.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE gets into the car.)</p>
<p><strong>Chris Bezich</strong>: What are you in the mood for?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Room service.</p>
<p>(CHRIS smiles.)</p>
<p>(Camera holds on the car's tail lights as it drives away.)</p>
<p>BLUR OUT TO FADE TO BLACK</p>

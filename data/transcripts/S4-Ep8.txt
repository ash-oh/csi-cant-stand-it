							<p>COLD OPEN:</p>
<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Camera moves in slowly to the large screen on the side of the hotel/casino under the headline: VEGAS SHOWGIRL REVUE. On the screen is a stage view of the Showgirls on Stage.)</p>
<p><strong>Julie Waters</strong>: (V.O.) Some girls want to be Homecoming Queen. Some girls want to be Miss America. I have always wanted to be a Showgirl.</p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO:</p>
<p>[INT. DELHOMME RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[ON TELEVISION]</p>
<p>(Extreme close up of JULIE WATERS' eye. Camera moves out and we see that we're watching footage of JULIE WATERS giving an interview.)</p>
<p><strong>Julie Waters</strong>: (on tv) I mean, I've been taking dancing lessons since I was five. I would, um ... I would pull my leotards really high up on my hips,<br />
(A man's hand reaches out to the monitor and lightly caresses her image on screen.)</p>
<p><strong>Julie Waters</strong>: (on tv) ... and stick feathers in my hair, put on my mom's high heels, and then I would put on this show.</p>
<p>(JULIE WATERS laughs self-consciously.)</p>
<p><strong>Paula Francis</strong>: (on tv) This is day six in the search for Julie Waters, the model and aspiring reported missing by her parents last Thursday. Authorities are asking for the public's help in any information regarding her whereabouts. </p>
<p>(HOWARD DELHOMME changes the channel and finds that JULIE WATERS' image is on every station. In his other hand, he holds a cordless phone.)</p>
<p><strong>Male Reporter</strong>: (on tv): Where is Julie Waters? That's the question authorities thus far ...</p>
<p><strong>Operator (male)</strong>: (from phone) Can you tell me your address, sir? What is your emergency?</p>
<p><strong>Howard Delhomme</strong>: (whispers) She's so beautiful. </p>
<p><strong>Julie Waters</strong>: (b.g. on tv) The first day I got here, I went straight to the Tropicana ...</p>
<p><strong>Howard Delhomme</strong>: (to phone) Soft and ... </p>
<p><strong>Julie Waters</strong>: (b.g. on tv) I walked right past all the slots and the tables, to the tiffany theater. ... </p>
<p><strong>Howard Delhomme</strong>: (to phone) ... sweet ... like an angel. </p>
<p><strong>Julie Waters</strong>: (b.g. on tv) I snuck in, and I just sat there in the back row, just watching. (She sighs.) </p>
<p><strong>Operator (male)</strong>: (from phone) What is your emergency?</p>
<p><strong>Howard Delhomme</strong>: (crying) I never meant to hurt her ...</p>
<p>(HOWARD DELHOMME hangs up the phone.)</p>
<p><strong>Julie Waters</strong>: (on tv) I couldn't get the smile off of my face. </p>
<p>(HOWARD falls to his hands and knees in front of the television and searches the floor for his gun.)</p>
<p><strong>Julie Waters</strong>: (on tv) (she laughs) I didn't even see when the security guard came up to me, and he told me that I had to leave. You know, &quot;all rehearsals are closed.&quot; </p>
<p>(Camera focuses on her MOUTH, then moves up to focus on her EYE.)</p>
<p><strong>Julie Waters</strong>: (on tv) So I got up, and then he turns to me ... and he says, um ... &quot;go ahead and stay.&quot;</p>
<p>(HOWARD lifts the gun and places the tip of the barrel against his lips.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. DELHOMME RESIDENCE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Officer cars line the front lawn like a barricade; SWAT members aim their guns on the front door.) </p>
<p><strong>SWAT Officer</strong>: He's coming out. Be advised: Suspect is armed. He's coming out.</p>
<p>(The door opens and HOWARD DELHOMME slowly, painfully walks out of the house.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: We have visual. OFFICER: Drop your weapon! OFFICER: Freeze! Freeze!</p>
<p>(The OFFICERS start to converge on the suspect.)</p>
<p><strong>SWAT Leader</strong>: Get on your knees right now! </p>
<p>(The suspect falls to his knees, the SWAT LEADER and other officers approach him.)</p>
<p><strong>SWAT Leader</strong>: Right there, right on your knees!</p>
<p>(An OFFICER cuffs the suspect where he kneels.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Clear the house. Look for the girl.</p>
<p>(All but a few OFFICERS leave and head into the house.)</p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO:</p>
<p>[EXT. DELHOMME RESIDENCE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(It's a short time later, reporters and other curious onlookers gather around the front lawn.)</p>
<p>(BRASS runs out of the house and across the lawn.)</p>
<p><strong>Reporters</strong>: Captain! Captain! Captain Brass!</p>
<p>(He heads for DELHOMME where he sits on the side while NICK gives him a breathalizer test.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Where is she?</p>
<p><strong>Delhomme</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (leans in close) See this face? I'm going to be all over you till you give her up.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (warning) Jim, the world's watching.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I want him waiting for me. </p>
<p>(The OFFICERS take DELHOMME away. CATHERINE and SARA, carrying their kits, join the group.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Swat cleared the house. It's empty.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So no girl? </p>
<p>(BRASS shakes his head.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to NICK) What did he blow?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: A .21.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Going to take him a long time to sober up.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'm not waiting.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Did he say anything about her?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: He never actually mentioned her name. All he said was, &quot;I never meant to hurt her.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Six days missing? He didn't just hurt her.</p>
<p>CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[CLOSE UP: DELHOMME'S EYES] </p>
<p>(DELHOMME looks up and around, not really focusing on any one thing around him. In the background, we hear continuing news reports from the television.) </p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Rory Atwater</strong>: (v.o. from tv) At this time, the Las Vegas Police Department has in custody one Howard Delhomme, ... </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. DELHOMME RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The television set is on and we see SHERIFF RORY ATWATER giving a press conference. The heading on the bottom of the screen reads:<br />
LIVE<br />
ATWATER NEWS CONFERENCE<br />
EYEWITNESS NEWS 8</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Rory Atwater</strong>: (on tv) ... whom we believe to be responsible for the disappearance of Julie Waters. Our forensic team is currently combing the Delhomme residence searching for clues to her whereabouts.</p>
<p><strong>Reporter</strong>: (from tv) Sheriff, how long will it take to find her?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE is kneeling in the center of the living room on top of a carpeting of newspapers and in front of the large television set of the press conference.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE picks up a newspaper and looks at it. The title of the paper is:<br />
NEVADA and the west</p>
<p>{heading on right}<br />

<p>LAS VEGAS RENO NEVADA * November 8</p>

TAKES TOP PRIORITY )</p>
<p>(CATHERINE puts the paper aside.)</p>
<p>(Behind her, SARA quietly goes through more newspapers on the coffee table.)</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Rory Atwater</strong>: (on tv) I expect an answer to that just as soon as the team is finished processing the house.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (mutters) Attaboy, Sheriff. Nothing like predicting the future.</p>
<p>(The paper that SARA looks at has multiple doodling sketches of various drawings of an eye or eyes in black ink. The newspaper's headlines read: ... ES TO LOSE FAITH ... Under the headlines is a large photo of JULIE WATERS with another woman. DELHOMME drew a large eye over JULIE'S forehead and completely traced over both sets of women's eyes in the photo like black eyeliner.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: This guy was unraveling.</p>
<p>(SARA looks at a nearby magazine on the coffee table with a beautiful cover shot of JULIE WATERS in a yellow showgirl-sequenced-outfit. The title story reads: DYING FOR FAME, THE LIFE OF JULIE WATERS.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE picks up a newspaper. It's dated NOVEMBER 11, 2003; the headline reads: </p>
<p>[NO LEADS IN JULIE WATERS CASE By Mike Botomi Review-Journal</p>
<p>Article reads: LAS VEGAS - Authorities are growing increasingly frustrated in their search for Julie Waters, the missing model/showgirl whom in recent days, has captured the sympathy of the entire Las Vegas Community. The LVPD released a statement late last night indicating that the crime well was drying up with very few fresh leads to explore. LVPD Sheriff Rory Atwater when asked about the likelihood ... </p>
<p>... expressing a sentiment that should be familiar to those who have followed that unfolding events of the past week, &quot;Julie is a face to remind us of everyone's daughter, as anyone with a child can attest to.&quot;</p>
<p>It should be noted that the natural general principle that will subgame this boring case requires considerable sexual performance ... ]</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: This is like a timeline. Day one all the way up until this morning.</p>
<p>(Camera pans slowly across the carpent of papers to show the variety and headlines:</p>
<p>* The LAS VEGAS SUN with large photo of JULIE WATERS on the front page with the headline: FEARED DEAD.<br />
* METRO ... with a large photo of JULIE WATERS on the front page.<br />
* NEVADA with the headline STATE RAIDS CRAWFISH OPERATION<br />
* LIVING with a photo of JULIE WATERS on the front page. )</p>
<p>(SARA looks around the living room and notes the kitchen television set on televising an interview with JULIE WATERS.)</p>
<p><strong>Julie Waters</strong>: (on tv) I mean, I've been taking dancing lessons since I was five. I would, um ... I would pull my leotards ...</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: More Julie Waters.</p>
<p><strong>Julie Waters</strong>: (on tv) ...Stick feathers in my hair, put on my mom's high heels, and then I would put on this show.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE moves past SARA and into the KITCHEN. She keeps walking down the hallway toward the room at the end of the hall. She opens the room and finds that it's a darkroom, red lights are still on.)</p>
<p>(The first thing they see is a photo of an extreme close up of an EYE hanging on the line to dry. CATHERINE and SARA enter the dark room.)</p>
<p>(Other pictures hanging from the line to dry are other multiple photos of EXTREME CLOSE UP of a person's EYE.)</p>
<p>(In fact, it almost appears as if every single photo hanging on the line to dry is a photo of a person's eye.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks down on the table and sees a photo of an speedometer, more photos of an EYE, then a business card.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE picks on up and looks at it. It reads: </p>

702-555-0176 / (cell) 702-555-0178</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (reading) &quot;Howard Delhomme Photography.&quot;</p>
<p>(CATHERINE puts the card down and looks at the photos hanging on the drying line. Camera passes a couple of odd-looking photos and another close up photo of an eye.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Camera opens on HOWARD DELHOMME'S eyes. He blinks rapidly and is out of focus. BRASS walks in and stops next to him.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Media's gone now. Just you and me. Where is she? </p>
<p>(HOWARD DELHOMME continues to look around and blink. He's not focused on BRASS or what BRASS has to say.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Nobody calls 911 unless they're ready to talk. </p>
<p>(HOWARD DELHOMME continues to look around.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Tell me.</p>
<p>(BRASS grabs HOWARD DELHOMME'S chin and turns his face to look at his directly.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Tell me. Get used to this room, bud. You're not going anywhere.</p>
<p>(BRASS lets go and leaves the room.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - AUDIO/VISUAL LAB]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE, NICK and SARA review the crime scene photos via slideshow.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Who reported Julie Waters missing?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Her mom. She said she talks to her every day. Called the station when she couldn't reach her by nightfall.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Grissom sent Nick and I to her apartment on the &quot;missing.&quot; Her bills were paid, ready to mail.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Doesn't look like any of her toiletries were missing.</p>
<p>(There are a couple of slides of a prescription container from the LATONA PHARMACY. The label reads:</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: She even left her birth control pills. Strange.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Her mom said she had dinner with the producers of Real Vegas Showgirls.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What's that?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: It's a reality-based show shooting here in Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What about her car?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: It was found four days ago at Dante's pizza on boulder highway -- parking lot.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks into the lab.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Locked. No signs of foul play.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Purse?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It's the only thing that was missing.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What about the drunk guy?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: A professional photographer, lives alone ... </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You collected everything at his house -- no evidence of Julie?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Although the place was papered with articles about her, all acquired after the fact.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE'S phone rings. She looks at the ID. It reads: BRASS.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and CATHERINE walk through the hallway. The closer they approach the room they can hear BRASS and the OFFICER talking.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer Joe</strong>: I was following protocol.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Come on, Joe, I ask you to do one thing and this happens?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Joe</strong>: I'm sorry, Captain. I got called away on a PCP ... </p>
<p>(BRASS sees CATHERINE and GRISSOM turn the corner and he stops JOE from continuing.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Joe.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Getting stitched up, but he left something for you.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and CATHERINE walk into the interview room. On the wall, written in blood is a message.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (reading) &quot;I'm sorry. I never meant to hurt anyone.&quot;</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks a the broken metal lining with blood on it. He looks down and sees the blood pooling on the floor. GRISSOM leans in for a closer look.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: DELHOMME uses his thumbnail and pries the metal siding away from the table. He digs it into his hand, drawing blood. He dips his finger in to his own blood and uses it to write his message on the wall. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: &quot;Anyone&quot;? What's that supposed to mean? That Julie Waters isn't his first victim? He's done this before?</p>
<p>(An OFFICER escorts HOWARD DELHOMME back to the cell. CATHERINE turns around and HOWARD gets a good look at CATHERINE. Their eyes meet and HOWARD can't seem to take his eyes off of CATHERINE. He's very, very focused on CATHERINE.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks up from the table and sees HOWARD'S fixation on CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to the OFFICER) You want to take him into the next room, please?</p>
<p>(The OFFICER pulls HOWARD out of the room. Camera holds on CATHERINE.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM]</p>
<p>(BRASS and SARA interview HOWARD DELHOMME. HOWARD is not focused on them, he picks on the bandage over his wound.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Look, I know you want to make this right. You called 911.</p>
<p>(HOWARD doesn't answer them.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What, do you think you're going to walk out of here? You're in for the long haul.</p>
<p>(Still, HOWARD doesn't answer.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: If you help me, I can help you. We already know who you're talking about. All we need to know is where to find her.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Are we boring you? Huh? 'Cause what you're not getting is I got all night. One of us is getting overtime to be here, and it isn't you, so talk to me.</p>
<p>(HOWARD lifts his head.)</p>
<p><strong>Howard Delhomme</strong>: I'll talk ... only for the one in the next room -- The Pretty One.</p>
<p>(Camera holds on SARA.)</p>

<p>(OFFICER cars speed down the roadway.)</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS DESERT -- DAY] </p>
<p>(CATHERINE and HOWARD DELHOMME walk over the hill. Behind them, OFFICERS and NEWSREPORTERS follow.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: How many yards did you say it was from mile marker 15?</p>
<p><strong>Howard Delhomme</strong>: Why don't you take off your sunglasses and your hat?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Need your help here, Mr. Delhomme.</p>
<p><strong>Howard Delhomme</strong>: Howard.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: All right. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE takes off her glasses and looks at HOWARD.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Howard. Are we in the right place?</p>
<p><strong>Howard Delhomme</strong>: You walk like a dancer. Do you moonlight? I'll bet you're featured, huh? High dollar. Nice long hair down your back?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What were you wearing that day, Howard?</p>
<p><strong>Howard Delhomme</strong>: I like long hair.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You recognize any of these rock formations?</p>
<p><strong>Howard Delhomme</strong>: You could grow yours out more, but ...</p>
<p>(They continue to walk down the hill.)</p>
<p>(In the back, ready and waiting, are the scent dogs.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: The news media stand along the edge of the search waiting for word and interviewing various OFFICERS. Down below, GRISSOM, SARA other OFFICERS form a search line to look for evidence.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[SUNSET]</p>
<p>(Silhouette against the evening sunset, SARA and GRISSOM talk.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What are we doing? I-is this logical? We have suspects picking their criminalists now.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, we all want the same thing, Sara. Catherine may have a way in. It could be helpful.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So this looks 'helpful' to you?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EVENING]</p>
<p>(A search helicopter flies above.)</p>

<p>(CATHERINE and ARCHIE look through the film. They are pictures of JULIE'S photo shoot.)</p>
<p><strong>Archie Johnson</strong>: How are these supposed to help him beat a murder rap?</p>
<p>(They look through the film.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm guessing he's trying to create an alibi </p>
<p><strong>Archie Johnson</strong>: Four rolls, all of Julie.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Something's off, though. White shoes, black stockings, and all ripped up. Not to mention these aren't the clothes that we found her in.</p>
<p>(Toward the end of a film roll, they find different photos.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Now, what is this?</p>
<p><strong>Archie Johnson</strong>: It's a nude.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Is that Julie's body?</p>
<p><strong>Archie Johnson</strong>: If it is, it's double exposed. I'll have to get them printed to be sure.</p>
<p>(SARA walks into the lab.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Cadet got a hit off a trash can. I brought it in. You want me to get Greg?</p>

<p>(SARA finds an envelope with head shots of JULIE WATERS.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: There's a lot of head shots here.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Here's our little lie. Delhomme said that he took her out to photograph her because she had no more head shots. Needed new ones.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE finds the make-up remover cloths.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Explains how he cleaned her up.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [DESERT] DELHOMME wipes the make-up off of JULIE WATERS' face. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Doesn't explain why. Well, here's her day planner.</p>
<p>(SARA looks through the Day Planner as CATHERINE takes out a bag from the trash.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Let's see, there's only two things written in her book the day she disappeared -- &quot;Real Vegas Showgirl Producer's dinner 7:00 P.M.,&quot; And the other -- &quot;Meet Howard, Dante's Pizza, 2:00 P.M.&quot; That would have given her plenty of time to get back for the producer's dinner.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Here's her clothes.</p>
<p>(Inside the bag, they find several outfits.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: First thing you learn as a model -- bring several outfits with you. You never know what the photographer might like.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE finds the black stockings with blood spots on it.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Here's our big lie. Delhomme said when she injured her earlobe, she was in her underwear and she was barefoot.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE shows SARA the blood on the stockings.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I think Howard's been lying to you.</p>

<p>(SARA stares at JULIE'S receipt. CATHERINE is dressed in shorts and prepares to put on the left black stocking.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: $65?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Capital investment. Our victim hadn't made it to the show yet. Her life was all about after the show. The right guy, the right meal, and after that ...</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It's a tough way to get ahead.</p>
<p>(SARA swabs and tests JULIE'S shoes.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Did your father ever tell you you were pretty?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (shrugs) I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: He ever tell you you were smart?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, it probably never occurred to you that you wouldn't be successful. If all you ever hear is that you're gorgeous, you can let everything else fall away, and it can leave you in a very dangerous place. Okay, the bloodstain on the top of the foot is round. Gravitational. On the bottom of the foot, it's smeared.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: There's no blood on these. She wasn't wearing them.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The only way we can get this guy is if the evidence counters every one of his lies.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE takes a sample of the blood, holds it up to the area of her ear and releases a single drop to fall directly on the top of her foot.)</p>
<p>(Camera zooms in as the blood drops and lands on her stocking.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: That matches the drop on the top of her stocking. Separate bloodstain. Separate drop.</p>
<p>(She releases a second drop onto the covered floor, then steps on it. She lifts her foot to show SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: She was standing. </p>
<p><strong>(cc) Sara</strong>: That makes him a liar again.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [DESERT] JULIE WATERS backs away from HOWARD DELHOMME. She's clutching her bleeding ear, blood seeping through her fingers. A blood drops on her foot and another drop falls to the ground. JULIE steps on the blood. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>

<p><strong>Archie</strong>: Yup. It's two separate images.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Separate them?</p>
<p>(ARCHIE separates the two images.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Do you have Catherine's crime scene photos of the car?</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We have looked through every piece of evidence on this case. Whatever caused these abrasions is gone.</p>

<p><strong>Archie</strong>: Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: At this point I don't care why he did it. What do you have?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Nothing. Absolutely nothing. If he raped her with a foreign object, it is not on this table.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So, Nick and I are the whole lab now? That's not it, Catherine, and you know it.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I saw the look in Howard's eye. I used to make my living off that look. He wanted me. We needed him. I decided to exploit that situation. And as angry as that made you, when you're in my shoes, you'll do the same thing.</p>

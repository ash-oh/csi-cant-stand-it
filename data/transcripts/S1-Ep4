<p>(HANK and GEORGE are sitting in a boat fishing. HANK struggles to hook a worm.)</p>
<p><strong>Hank</strong>: Ah, these green worms ain't worth a damn.</p>
<p>(Something thumps against the boat.)</p>
<p><strong>George</strong>: What the hell was that?</p>
<p><strong>Hank</strong>: I don't know, probably one of those eight-foot carp.</p>
<p>(Something thumps against the boat again. GEORGE is spooked.)</p>
<p><strong>George</strong>: Let's get out of here.</p>
<p>(GEORGE reaches for the engine pull cord and rips it. The engine sputters and dies.)</p>
<p><strong>Hank</strong>: Something probably caught on the blades. Check the prop.</p>
<p><strong>George</strong>: I'm not sticking my hand in that water.</p>
<p>(HANK gets up to do it.)</p>
<p><strong>Hank</strong>: (irritated) Move. Move out of the way. Okay.</p>
<p>(HANK reaches over the side of the boat and sticks his hand in the water. He feels around.)</p>
<p><strong>Hank</strong>: Yeah, I got something.</p>
<p>(HANK pulls it up. He has his hand wrapped around the high heel of a woman's shoe.)</p>
<p><strong>George</strong>: Dude, throw it back.</p>
<p><strong>Hank</strong>: What the hell is it?</p>
<p>(As he lifts it up, it's apparent that the woman's leg is still attached to the shoe.)</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Femur. Strongest bone in the human body -- it's sliced clean through.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Like a ginsu through a banana.</p>
<p>(BRASS walks up to them.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, what do you think, drowning?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, probably, but under what circumstances? You don't wear flippers at a five-star restaurant. Why would you wear three-inch heels at a lake? (to CATHERINE) So, Watson? The game is afoot.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, do you want to be alive when your leg's being cut off?</p>
<p>(The door bursts open and GRISSOM appears pushing a gurney with a body on it.)</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Jenna Williams</strong>: Her skin's shriveled like a shar-pei. No pressure, no prints.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks expectantly at CATHERINE. CATHERINE knows that look.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No. No way, use your own hand.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Come on, Catherine, my hand's too big.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (firmly) No!</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's the only way we can print her. Her skin on your hand should fit like a leather glove.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM reaches for the hand and a knife. CATHERINE watches as GRISSOM takes the skin off of the hand. When he finishes, he looks up at CATHERINE and extends his hand to her.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: May I take your hand?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE puts her hand in GRISSOM'S and he leads her to the table where the fingerprint kit is. Although we don't see it, GRISSOM puts the dead woman's skin on CATHERINE'S hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: On behalf of the decedent I thank you.</p>
<p>(He takes the fingerprint.)</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It's me. I found it. Just South of Barring Point Bridge.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I took a walk.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks toward the water tank.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Just South of Barring Point Bridge? What color is the boat?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It's white with lime green trim. Just like the splinters we found in Wendy Barger's head wound.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well done, Catherine. Well done.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE stifles a giggle.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (from phone) let's get the boat back to the garage.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM hangs up the phone and looks at the water tank. Inside, the toy boat stopped at BARRING POINT BRIDGE.)</p>

<p>FADE IN.</p>

[EXT. PARK -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(WARRICK sits on a park bench. JUDGE COHEN approaches him. WARRICK stands up.)</p>
<p><strong>Judge Cohen</strong>: This better be good.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I need some assurances.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Cohen</strong>: It's a two-way street, pal. Did you do what I asked?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I checked out the evidence, yeah. But I'm not sure about the rest.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Cohen</strong>: What's the big deal? You break the seal on the evidence box it's over. We put it to bed, I tell Henderson &quot;mission accomplished.&quot;</p>
<p>(WARRICK raises his hand and gives a thumbs up signal.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Why don't you let me do that?</p>
<p>(The Police Siren blare and officers arrive at the park. JUDGE COHEN looks around.)</p>

<p>(JUDGE COHEN turns to look at WARRICK. WARRICK lifts his shirt to show him the listening device taped to his chest. The officers put the JUDGE in handcuffs.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I told you ... nobody owns me.</p>

[INT CSI - BREAK ROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GREG walks into the break room where GRISSOM is eating.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Hey, Grissom. I hear Catherine beat you to the boat.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We work as a team. We're not competing.</p>
<p>(GREG gets his yogurt out of the refrigerator and opens it.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Okay. But, ah, she found it first. Right?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: &quot;Two roads diverged in a yellow wood and, sorry I could not travel both.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Robert Frost.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Very good, Greg.</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>(GREG takes a seat opposite GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: But actually, in this case, Mr. Frost does not apply. When you have a partner you each take a road. That's how you find a missing boat.</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Come on. Level with me. Who do you think killed her -- the husband or boyfriend?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at GREG.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And you've narrowed it down to just two suspects?</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Actually, you did. You see, my second week at CSI, you told me that when a cheating spouse is murdered there's always two suspects at the top of the list: The lover and the betrayed.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I told you this?</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Mm-hmm. You see, I'm thinking that the husband caught Wendy with the boyfriend and when she left his house, he killed her in a jealous rage.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And this theory is based on...?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM stands up.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Nothing. I'm just trying to help.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm going to the garage to meet Catherine. (GRISSOM tosses his plate.) You keep thinking, Butch. That's what you're good at.</p>
<p>(GREG stands up to follow GRISSOM to the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Hey. If this theory checks out, uh maybe we should talk about a raise.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM leaves.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - GARAGE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Camera opens on PHIL SWELCO'S BOAT #NV355 and around the Yamaha engine.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM checks the inside of the boat. CATHERINE checks the outside edges of the boat.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE sees something.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I think I may have found some skin. When Wendy hit her head. Did you hear what I said?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM picks up the camera and holds it.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Blood.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Blood? Well, you were at the autopsy. The head trauma wasn't a bleeder.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, maybe she fought back. Either way, we got to call Brass. Tell them to bring the boyfriend in.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE puts her things aside and walks to find a phone. GRISSOM snaps the photo.)</p>

[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT -- HALLWAY - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(BRASS opens the door and PHIL SWELCO walks out into the hallway.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Could you wait right here, please? (to the OFFICER) Stay with Mr. Swelco.</p>
<p>(BRASS walks up to GRISSOM. CATHERINE joins them.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How's it going?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Aah, you know, the usual beep-bap-bop, you know? The guy said he cut his hand cleaning fish. Got a tetanus shot. That's his excuse for the blood we found on the boat. But I'll call the Lake Clinic to confirm.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (teasing) Damn, you're good.</p>
<p>(In the background, WINSTON BARGER appears in the hallway.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, shut up. Stevie, hang with him.</p>
<p><strong>Winston Barger</strong>: (o.s.) Phil? Phil Swelco?</p>
<p>(PHIL SWELCO looks up.)</p>
<p>(At the sound of his voice, GRISSOM and CATHERINE straighten and look back at WINSTON BARGER.)</p>
<p><strong>Phil Swelco</strong>: Winston. (beat) I heard about your wife. I'm sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Winston Barger</strong>: What are you doing here? Why are you questioning him?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mr. Barger, why don't you, um come over here with me. Just walk over ...</p>
<p>(CATHERINE takes WINSTON BARGER down one end of the hallway. GRISSOM goes to PHIL SWELCO.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mr. Swelco. Why don't we go in here sit down.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes PHIL SWELCO back into the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Have a seat.</p>
<p>(They sit down.)</p>
<p><strong>Winston Barger</strong>: I always knew she was seeing someone. I just didn't know who.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (sighs) Oh, I'm sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Winston Barger</strong>: She was having an affair with Phil Swelco? And you think he killed her.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>

[EXT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - PARKING LOT - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and CATHERINE argue in the parking lot.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You just compromised our investigation.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: He deserved to know the truth.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Knowing how she died, yes. Knowing that she had an affair -- how does that bring closure?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I guess you just have to be on the wrong end of an affair to understand.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You can't make this about Eddie. Look, you hurt our case because your ex hurt you.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We bring ourselves to our cases. We can't help it. I knew how Barger felt. Would you just relax? I didn't give him chapter and verse.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You can't give him anything, Catherine. We're scientists. We're not psychiatrists or victims' rights advocates.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You right, you know. I should be just like you. Alone in my hermetically sealed condo watching discovery on the big screen working genius-level crossword puzzles, but no relationships. No chance any will slop over into a case. Right. I want to be just like you.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Technically, it's a townhouse. And the crosswords are advanced, not genius. But you're right. I'm deficient in a lot of ways. But I never screw up one of my cases with personal stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Grissom ... what personal stuff?</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Jill. (laughs) Man, Kyle must've been steamed. His girlfriend signs a pledge's privates?</p>
<p><strong>Matt Daniels</strong>: Yeah, Kyle, can take a joke.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: He didn't think it was funny enough to share it with us. You know, I never met a guy who could just laugh that off.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, Matt you know why I joined a fraternity? 'Cause I wanted to belong to something -- the brotherhood. That's what it was all about for me you know what I mean? So, I'm going to cut to the chase here, bud. You come clean, you might be able to save your house ... save the brotherhood, but ... if you don't ... </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You and Kyle both get charged with murder. And the House goes dark.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Everything you're trying to protect you'll destroy. Matty, I found the string. Now are you ready to tell us what happened after James got back to that house?</p>
<p><strong>Matt Daniels</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: )</p>
<p><strong>Matt Daniels</strong>: Hey, let's see what Johnson came up with.</p>
<p><strong>Frat Boy</strong>: Yeah? FRAT BOY: Yeah, let's see it, dude. FRAT BOY: Show it!</p>
<p>(JAMES nods and takes off his pants.)</p>

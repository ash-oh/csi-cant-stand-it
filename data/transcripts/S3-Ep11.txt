<hr />
[EXT. METEOR MEAT - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The METEOR MEAT delivery trucks back into the loading stall. The driver gets out of the truck and looks at HARLAN who stands in front of the doorway.)</p>
<p><strong>Delivery Man</strong>: Hey, Harlan. Special delivery. Fresh shipment in from Nebraska.</p>
<p><strong>Harlan</strong>: Great. Just stack it in the freezer, will you? I got to open up.</p>
<p><strong>Delivery Man</strong>: All right, you got it, boss.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. METEOR MEAT - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(HARLAN opens up the main meat packing area and turns on the lights. He walks inside and powers up the conveyer belt where meat is already placed upon.)</p>
<p>(HARLAN reaches up and turns on the overhead fluorescent lights.)</p>
<p>(He continues his morning routine and reaches the next machine to turn it on. He looks over and notices that it's already been used with ground up meat in the metal bin on the side.)</p>
<p>(HARLAN walks over to the bin and looks inside. His eyes widen as he sees a bloody human hand sticking out.)</p>
<p>FLASH TO WHITE:</p>
<hr />
[INT. METEOR MEAT - NIGHT]]</p>
<p>(BRASS escorts GRISSOM and CATHERINE through the main meat packing area.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Ever wonder what's in that hot dog? Human body in a meat grinder. Shop foreman found an arm. The rest of him is prime grade a sirloin.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Body in a meat grinder. Sounds kind of &quot;mob-ish&quot; except they left town in the '80s.</p>
<p>(They stop. BRASS points to an officer interviewing MANNY SALDANO.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The last guy to operate the meat grinder is this guy over here. Manny Saldano, age 37. Worked for meteor for eleven years. Shop foreman vouches for him. Says he inspected all three of his machines before he clocked him out.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, we're going to need to process him.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Sure. (BRASS points to the meat grinder) Check out the smorgasbord. Go ahead.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and GRISSOM head for the meat grinder. They duck under the crime scene tape.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (b.g.) Mike.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE puts her case down.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (under her breath) Good god...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Looks like the elbow got stuck in the blade.</p>
<p>(Camera zooms down to the pipe at the end of the grinder. GRISSOM puts on his gloves.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yup, the ulna.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: One of the strongest bones in the body. Probably what jammed this grinder.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Possibly why whoever did this didn't finish the job.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE snaps a couple of pictures. GRISSOM tries to take the hand out of the grinder and finds that it's not easy.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It's like that Morrissey album - &quot;Meat is Murder&quot; ...</p>
<p>(GRISSOM continues to struggle with the hand. He finally looks up at CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm going to need a hand.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<hr />
[INT. METEOR MEAT -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and CATHERINE kneel in front of the ground meat. GRISSOM holds out his flashlight and they both assess where to start.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The last remains of John Doe. We're going to need sifters.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Blood's everywhere. Phenolphthalein and luminol are useless.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM shines his flashlight on the &quot;Butcher&quot; meat grinder.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We're going to have to dismantle this piece by piece.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'll get a foreman.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I think I can handle this.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You know about meat grinders?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, everything's pretty much plumbing. Male into female parts. Righty tighty, lefty loosey.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE reaches over to the meat grinder mouthpiece and starts to unscrew it.)</p>
<p>(Dissolve to: CATHERINE starts to take the meat grinder apart piece by piece.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Grinder plate.</p>
<p>(She puts the grinder plate aside and pulls out the ... )</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Blade.</p>
<p>(She puts the blade aside and pulls out the large piece inside the meat grinder with meat still wrapped around it oozing out.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The worm.</p>
<p>(She turns around and puts &quot;The worm&quot; in a bag. Behind her, some distance away, GRISSOM finds something on the ground. He picks it up and examines it.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Found an ear plug. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE turns to look at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Ear wax is ripe with DNA.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Except ... all the employees wear them.</p>
<p>(They both stand up.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This one's different than the ones they use. Whoever wore this brought it with them. We just have to find out whose ear it fits.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. LINDA DAMEN'S RESIDENCE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(DETECTIVE &quot;SULLY&quot; SULIK escorts SARA and WARRICK through the pool area toward LINDA DAMEN'S apartment. He fills them in.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. &quot;Sully&quot; Sulik</strong>: Girl's name is Linda Damen, 23, apparent suicide. Father stopped by with dinner found her dead, called 9-1-1.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No signs of forced entry?</p>
<p>(The Detective ducks under the crime scene tape. SARA and WARRICK follow. They all head up the stairs to LINDA DAMEN'S apartment.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. &quot;Sully&quot; Sulik</strong>: Nope. Did find her wallet out. Empty.</p>
<p>(The DETECTIVE hands the bagged wallet to SARA. She looks at it and hands it to WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hmmm ...</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Empty? Maybe she was just broke.</p>
<p>(They reach the top of the stairs where JOHN and JANE DAMEN, LINDA'S parents stand. They enter the apartment.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. LINDA DAMEN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Inside the apartment, HANK PEDDIGREW is putting his things away.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p>(HANK looks up.)</p>
<p><strong>Hank Peddigrew</strong>: You guys are fast.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You pronounce?</p>
<p><strong>Hank Peddigrew</strong>: 7:20. Coroner will be able to tell you more. Looks like she bled out. Her left wrist is transected.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It's atypical for a female. Women usually commit suicide in the tub. It's easier cleanup for whoever's left behind.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(SARA looks down at the bed and sees something. She lifts the sheet away to reveal a straight-edged razor.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Warrick. </p>
<p>(WARRICK raises the camera and snaps some pictures.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Did her parents say whether she was living with a man?</p>
<p><strong>Detective</strong>: Was dating a Brody Jones. No idea where he works or lives.</p>
<p>(WARRICK looks at the streak of blood across the bed covering.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Did someone move her?</p>
<p>(HANK looks at the bed cover.)</p>
<p><strong>Hank Peddigrew</strong>: She was propped up when we got here. I checked for vitals.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You sure with all your life-saving efforts you didn't move her?</p>
<p><strong>Hank Peddigrew</strong>: Hey, man, like I said, I checked for vitals.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It's okay, babe.</p>
<p>(HANK turns and stares at SARA, surprised by what she said. DETECTIVE SULIK looks at SARA. SARA turns her back to the men and shakes her head slightly at herself.)</p>
<p><strong>Hank Peddigrew</strong>: (continues) The victim had no response. I had no reason to move her.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, someone moved her. She bled out her </p>
<p>(HANK doesn't say anything more.)</p>
<p>(SARA turns on her flashlight and checks out the closet. She lets out a deep breath.)</p>
<p>(HANK walks up to SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Hank Peddigrew</strong>: I'm going to hit the road ... (beat) ... baby.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (grimaces) I'm sorry.</p>
<p>(HANK leaves. SARA examines the clothes in the closet and finds something.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: There's a stain here. So cold stains.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Is it recent?</p>
<p>(SARA checks.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It's cool to the touch, yeah.</p>
<p>(WARRICK finds some bloodied footprints on the carpet near the bed.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Sara.</p>
<p>(SARA turns to look at WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I think our suicide just became suspicious circs.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC PATHOLOGY -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM examines the partial arm on the table. ROBBINS stands near him.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Since I'm the one who always seems to state the obvious this arm was dead before it was hacked off.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What do you make of the, uh scar tissue on the palm?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Occupational hazard, maybe. I see this kind of thing a lot in bricklayers, plumbers, carpenters.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Looks like it's blistered.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns around and picks up something from the table behind him.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Gradual denaturation of the proteins in the epithelials. Resulting in general scarring on the palm or surface.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes a sample from under the fingernails.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'll send this sample to trace.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM continues to look at the hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Tips of the fingers look like they're worn to the bone.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Can you get a partial?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns around and picks up a small bottle of something from the table behind him.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Much more than that. Lansberry's Ridge Builder. One application to the bulbs of the fingers and the ridges plump out temporarily like a chia pet on steroids.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM brushes the liquid onto the fingertips.)</p>
<p>(Camera close up of the fingertip. CGI has the print ridges well defined. Resume to ROBBINS.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM lightly inks the tip of the finger, then takes a print from it. Pleased, he glances at ROBBINS.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - PRINT LAB]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and CATHERINE stand around the print database monitor as they run the print. The computer beeps and it pops out a name with ID.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Petrov Samsko. Non-gaming sheriff's permit, head chef, Debreff Restaurant.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM pronounces it &quot;doo-breff&quot;.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Chef-- that would explain the burn scar tissue on his palm.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (nods) It's &quot;Debreff.&quot; </p>
<p>(CATHERINE pronounces it &quot;dough-breff&quot;.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It's a five-star restaurant. I've eaten there.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Good, maybe you can get us a table.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. LINDA DAMEN'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Camera opens on WARRICK comparing the shoe print with JOHN DAMEN'S shoe while JANE DAMEN stands near and watches.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Different sole, different size. Thank you. Sorry for the inconvenience. This is just a standard procedure. </p>
<p>(WARRICK sits down.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Do you have any idea where your daughter's boyfriend works?</p>
<p><strong>John Damen</strong>: Well, a casino.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Uh, which one?</p>
<p><strong>John Damen</strong>: All of them. He's, uh, he's a gambler. Um, used to drag Linda out, keep her up days at a time. Ran her health down, her spirit.</p>
<p><strong>Jane Damen</strong>: She was getting better, though. She had a, uh... rough time after college finding herself, but she was getting better.</p>
<p>(JANE DAMEN shifts her gaze past WARRICK where the Coroner's office bring out LINDA DAMEN'S body on a gurney. Her eyes follow the gurney as they wheel the body away.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(ROBBINS fills SARA in on the findings. Camera opens on the blade cut on LINDA DAMEN'S left wrist.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: The trans-section of the left wrist is consistent with a self-inflicted wound particularly because she's right-handed.</p>
<p>(SARA leans over and looks at the wound.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: There's no hesitation marks. Isn't that uncommon for suicide?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: People usually stutter-cut a few times ... </p>
<p>(Quick CGI to: Camera close up of a razor against a wrist making small hesitation cuts.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (V.O.) ... trying to work up the courage.</p>
<p>(End of CGI. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: This woman cut herself with one smooth motion.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: This D.B. is all wrong. Someone moved her two feet from where she bled out. What did the tox screen say?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Nothing. Not back yet. But I'll get it to you soon as it is.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>(SARA and ROBBINS turn to look at the body. SARA sees something and leans over for a better look.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Is that glass in her hair?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Minute pieces of it, yeah. I tweezed a few for trace.</p>
<p>(ROBBINS takes a sample piece out and hands it to SARA for her to look at.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We didn't see any broken glass in her apartment. Round edges, tinted ... </p>
<p>(Camera zooms in for a close up of the piece of glass.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: ... it looks polarized.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Probably safety glass.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah. Too bad it didn't protect her.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. DE BREFF BISTRO (RESTAURANT) - FRONT -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(At the front, the HOSTESS is on the phone. GRISSOM and CATHERINE walk up to her.)</p>
<p><strong>Hostess</strong>: (to phone) Uh, Debreff, please hold. Debreff, please hold. Debreff, please hold. </p>
<p>(Still on the phone, the HOSTESS looks up at GRISSOM and CATHERINE. She puts the phone down for the moment.)</p>
<p><strong>Hostess</strong>: Hi. Last name?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We don't have reservations. W-we're here...</p>
<p>(As soon as the HOSTESS hears that they don't have reservations, she turns back to the phone. She puts a hand up to stop GRISSOM from talking.)</p>
<p><strong>Hostess</strong>: (to phone) eh, party of four? Three weeks from Thursday? Let me see.</p>
<p>(The HOSTESS turns to look at her reservation book.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Excuse me, but you don't understand.</p>
<p><strong>Hostess</strong>: No, I'm sorry. You don't understand. You're walk-in's on a very busy night. We're short a chef.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We know. He's dead. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Not just dead. Dismembered. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM holds up his work ID for the HOSTESS.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We're with the crime lab.</p>
<p>(The phone continues to ring in the background. The HOSTESS hangs up the phone she's holding.)</p>
<p><strong>Hostess</strong>: I'll get the owner.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. DE BREFF BISTRO (RESTAURANT) - KITCHEN -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM examines the items on the shelves in the kitchen while CATHERINE talks with LES DUTTON, the OWNER.)</p>
<p><strong>Les Dutton</strong>: Are you sure it's Petrov?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Coroner made a positive identification.</p>
<p><strong>Les Dutton</strong>: What makes you think this event happened here?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We found traces of aspic and olive oil under his fingernails. Means that he went into the meat grinder without showering. Possibly straight from this kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>Les Dutton</strong>: If there was a murder in our kitchen don't you think that, uh ... I'd know about it?</p>
<p>(He chuckles nervously.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I don't know. Would you?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM continues to look around the kitchen. He finds in the hamper, two blood-stained chefs jackets. One belongs to &quot;ROSS HALPO, SOUS CHEF&quot; and the other to &quot;LOLA CREIGHTON, SAUCIER CHEF&quot;. Both also have &quot;Do Breff Bistro&quot; embroidered on it.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hey, Cath? (points to the jackets) Blood spatter.</p>
<p><strong>Owner</strong>: It's a kitchen. The chefs use knives. That's not uncommon. You are...?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Gil Grissom. I'm with her.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM pulls out another white jacket. On it reads: &quot;Do Breff Bistro&quot;, &quot;Stephanie&quot;. There is no job title on it.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Who's, uh, Stephanie?</p>
<p><strong>Owner</strong>: One of my waitresses.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Oh, I understand how chefs cut their fingers and how the kitchen help could have blood spatter on their uniforms, but how does a waitress get blood on the back of her shirt?</p>
<p>(LES DUTTON doesn't say anything.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We can shut you down for hours or get a warrant and shut you down for good.</p>
<p>(He turns and looks back nervously at his busy kitchen.)</p>
<p><strong>Les Dutton</strong>: (to CATHERINE) Give me till after the rush?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks up at him.)</p>
<p>CUT TO BLACK.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<hr />
[INT. DE BREFF BISTRO (RESTAURANT) - FRONT -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and CATHERINE wait back out in the main dining room. GRISSOM sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Okay, this &quot;rush&quot; is taking entirely too long.</p>
<p><strong>Waiter</strong>: (to PATRON) Sir? The Coquilles St. Jacques.</p>
<p>(The WAITER lifts up the dish lid.)</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah. What? Caused by a candle?</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Lithium didn't help?</p>
<p><strong>Jane Damen</strong>: Well, it's a catch-22. When Linda's in an &quot;up&quot; phase, she doesn't think she needs the lithium, so she doesn't take it which then makes her more unstable.</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Brody, we have your shoeprint in Linda's blood. We also have a sample of Linda's blood that we found on your t-shirt. Is there anything you'd like to tell us?</p>
<p><strong>Brody Jones</strong>: Yes. Someone is playing that machine right now and is throwing the entire last 72 hours of calculations out the window.</p>
<p><strong>Det. &quot;Sully&quot; Sulik</strong>: Did you kill this girl and try to make it look like a suicide?</p>
<p><strong>Brody</strong>: If anything, I tried to save her.</p>
<p><strong>Det. &quot;Sully&quot; Sulik</strong>: Save her how?</p>

<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: I was over here on an exhumation matter. I knew you wanted this. Tox results for Linda Damen.</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>(ROBBINS leaves. WARRICK opens the folder and looks at the test results.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No lithium, just like her parents said. She did have a huge dose of valium, ingested less than an hour before her time of death.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Valium? </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: That doesn't make any sense. I mean, that's the last thing a depressed person would take.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: 200 milligrams. That's more than five times the normal dosage.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: That much valium. There's no way she could have fought somebody off if they were coming after her with a straight razor.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We're talking about clothes?</p>
<p><strong>David Hodges</strong>: Worsted is predominately used in the manufacturing of suits and light overcoats. The finish on this is trademark coating in high-end suits.</p>

<p>(GRISSOM looks at HODGES.) </p>
<p><strong>David Hodges</strong>: (continues) I know what you're thinking. Couldn't possibly be his suit. Chefs wear checks and white shirts. But somebody did burn a bloody suit in the restaurant kitchen. A high-end suit.</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Can you tell us anything about that?</p>
<p>(She puts the paper on the counter behind her.)</p>
<p><strong>Jane Damen</strong>: I take valium on occasion. Yes. Our lives get pretty frenetic just trying to keep up with Linda. </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: And you last got a prescription ... this past monday. What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The tox report says Linda had five times the normal dose of valium in her system. Because there were no hesitation marks on her wrists it suggests that someone else inflicted the wound. That much valium would've been enough to subdue her.</p>
<p><strong>John Damen</strong>: Hey, I-I think you're a little out of line here.</p>
<p><strong>Jane Damen</strong>: I did not drug my daughter.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: May we have your permission to look through the current contents of your prescription?</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Thanks, Greg.</p>
<p>(SARA hangs up and turns around.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Mr. And Mrs. Damen, there are five types of tears -- sorrow, regret, joy, fear and allergic reaction. The one thing that they have in common is DNA. We found a blouse in your daughter's closet the night that she died. There was moisture on it. The moisture... was tears. The DNA ... (SARA looks at JOHN DAMEN.) ... was male. </p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Sand. Right -- for balance and precision.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM grabs his magnifying glass and examines the grains of sand on the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did you know that to a geologist there's no such thing as sand? Each grain is its own tiny rock. Fine, glassy crystals ... (Camera zooms into the glass for a close up.) ... dark. Obsidian, I bet.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM hands the magnifying glass to CATHERINE.)</p>

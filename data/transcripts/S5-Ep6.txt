Frat Boy: Say it loud and say it proud!
PLEDGE: Omega zeta pi!
 
Frat Boy: Say it loud and say it proud!
PLEDGE: Omega zeta pi!

PLEDGE: Dude ...  What's crawling on my face?


 
 
Eva: It's fraternity hell week. A pledge slipped and fell in this pile of maggots. School of agriculture is in charge of campus landscaping, so security called me.  You were the first person I thought of.
Grissom: Well, thank you, Eva. I'm honored.
 
Grissom: You make your own mulch?
Eva: The university is self-sustaining. A city within a city. State institutions are encouraged to practice xeriscaping.
Grissom: &quot;Xeri&quot; meaning dry?
Eva: Landscaping using drought-tolerant plant life. Conserves water. There's no reason for these maggots to be here.
 
Campus Security Officer Brian: Dr. Grissom, your tea. Hold the tea bag?
Grissom: Thank you, Brian. 

Grissom:  Do, uh ... do you use scraps from the dining halls for your compost?
 
Eva: No. Why?
Grissom: Well, if the devil requires a pound of flesh, this many maggots would require over a hundred.
Eva: Pounds of flesh?
 
Grissom: Were you aware that the average college student weighs 135 pounds?
 
FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS



 
 
Dean Wilson: How long is this going to take? 
Eva: If something happened to one of our students, don't you want to know?
Dean Wilson: Sure. 

Dean Wilson: But on a campus this size, there's a thin line between satisfying curiosity and creating panic.
 
Grissom: This stopped being about my curiosity the minute we found a human tooth. We're now investigating a possible homicide.
 
Nick: Hey, Grissom, why is it hot?
Grissom: Maggot digestion can generate heat up to 125 degrees. Heat increases the rate of putrefaction, which speeds up the digestive process.
 
Nick: I don't see any tissue. How long would it take for them to pick a body clean?
Grissom: Assuming it's just one body? A few days.
Nick: Yeah, and that's another thing. I have a hard time believing that if a corpse was here, no one saw it. And these bones?  They're uniform. Same shape and size.
Grissom: Yeah.  Same size as these wood chips.
 

 
 

Grissom: This thing always this loud?
Walter Beerly: Yeah, but we're, we're kind of off the beaten path.
Grissom: You use it every day?
Walter Beerly: Pretty much.

Grissom: You think a human body could fit through there?
Walter Beerly: You planning something?
Grissom: Gil Grissom, Las Vegas Crime Lab.
Walter Beerly: Walter Beerly, master of the universe. Six cylinders. 200 horse power. Thing's got an engine that would give most SUVs a run for their money. And it's got one job. Chopping crap up.
Grissom: So the answer's yes.


Walter Beerly: Would take about fifteen seconds.
Grissom: May I?
Walter Beerly: You want to stick your head in there, be my guest.

Walter Beerly: What are you looking for?
Grissom: Blood.
Walter Beerly: Oh, you're pretty much out of luck, 'cause I've been chipping all morning, and if there was any in there, it's probably gone. See, wood absorbs moisture. One of the reasons they use it for mulch.

Grissom: Yeah.

Walter Beerly: Pregnant?
 
Grissom: It's human.
 


 
 
 
Nick: Remember, you're on the clock, man. About, uh, twenty-four hours ... all of these maggots turn into flies.
Greg: I know.
(Nick turns and leaves the lab. Greg continues to work.

 
 
Mia Dickerson: What are you doing?
Grissom: Day shift told me you didn't get any results off the tooth.
 
Mia Dickerson: Yeah, it was a porcelain crown. Root canal. No viable pulp.
Grissom: I still need a DNA profile on our victim. 
Mia Dickerson: And since bone marrow extraction can be difficult ...
Grissom: I figured I'd go straight to the source. 

Mia Dickerson: Well, maggots are eating machines. They'll have DNA from the flesh. It's genius.

Grissom: Thank you. 
Mia Dickerson: One maggot colada, coming up.
 

 
 
Catherine: What's with the tape?
 
Greg: The evidence wasn't cooperating, so I stuck it to them.
Catherine:  Cute. 
 
Catherine: Anything of interest?
Greg: Well, I haven't had much time for analysis. So far the only inorganics are these black plastic shreds, from a garbage bag, I think, and ... this. 
 
Greg: Well, blue trace is tacky to the touch.
Catherine: It's a fingernail.

 
 
Catherine: Uh, sorry, Sara. I need the microscope. Priority.
Sara: I got three more samples to run. When I'm finished, it'll be your turn.
Catherine: This can't wait.
Sara: It can't? Or you can't?
 
Catherine: Both. Go have a cup of coffee on me.
 
Sara: The coffee's free.
Catherine: Thank you.
 

 
(It reads:
Case Number:
19879_c8
Sample:
Fingernail with
Unknown Blue
Substance
Component 1:
Motor Oil
Component 2:
Blue Color Paint

 
Catherine: Oil-based blue paint mixed with motor oil ... 
 
Grissom: He's back.

 
 
Brass: Starting in 1987, a series of murders occurred on the WLVU campus. Three women: Janet Kent ... Marcia Reese ... and Charlene Roth. Now, Charlene Roth's murder provided us with enough evidence to investigate a suspect ... John Mathers, WLVU security guard. He was arrested, tried and convicted. Two years ago, this week, he was executed. The night of his execution, Debby Reston was murdered.
Officer: Copycat, right?
Catherine: No. We believe that Mathers was the copycat, responsible only for Charlene Roth's death.
Brass: Which means the serial killer is still at large. 
Catherine: And we have reason to believe that he has killed again. Our suspect's M.O. is to apply blue paint to a campus railing ... 



Catherine:  ... that he has infused with motor oil to retard the drying process.

 
Catherine: He then lays in wait for a female victim to touch the railing.

Catherine:  It's always near a water fountain. He then grabs them from behind as they're washing the paint from their hands.
 
Catherine: Our suspect's prior victims were all sexually assaulted. No semen was found. Cause of death: Strangulation.
Brass: He stuffed them in black plastic trash bags
Quick flashback to: 



Brass:  ... and dumps the bodies in plain sight.

Catherine: Given that he has been killing for around twenty years, we approximate his age to be ... 
 
Catherine:  ... at least thirty-five. He may wear glasses. He may drive a Chevy with black interior.
 
Officer 2: The latest victim was put in a wood chipper. Why the change in M.O.?
Catherine: Serials have been known to change their signatures because they have to. Fear of being caught ... interruption ... or it could just be an act of escalation.

 
Brass:  So we're looking for a sadistic, ritualistic, organized sociopath. 
 
Brass:  We'll be on 12 and 12s. No holidays, no vacations until this is solved.
 
FADE OUT



 
 
Reporter: Ms. Willows, can you confirm that the blue paint killer has claimed another victim?
Catherine: I haven't been cleared for comment.
Reporter: Ms. Willows, was John Mathers wrongfully convicted?
(Quick flashback to: 



Reporter:  Did the state execute an innocent man?

Catherine: John Mathers killed Charlene Roth and was punished for it.
 
Reporter:  You sure this isn't a copycat?! REPORTER: Well, how can you be so sure of that?
 
Reporter: Ms. Willows? REPORTER: Ms. Willows!

 
 
Mia Dickerson: I double-checked the results. The DNA from the maggots is male.
Grissom: Any possible cross-contamination?
Mia Dickerson: No, the samples were pure.



 
Warrick: Griss, this place is crawling with press. They want a statement.
Grissom: Not now.
Warrick: Well, if you don't say anything, they're just going to fill in the blanks ... 
Grissom: Screw the press, 'cause for all I know, the dead body is an auto mechanic who just painted his house blue.
 

 
 

 
 
Catherine: What's this key used for?
Frat Boy : Um, pledging. Plebes are asked to swallow it on the first night of hell week.
Nick: Then &quot;retrieve&quot; it and return it by the end of the week, right?
Frat Boy : You got it.
Catherine: You know that hazing is illegal. You could lose your charter.
Frat Boy : Well, it's not hazing. It's a voluntary loyalty ritual.
Catherine: Political science major?
Frat Boy : Pre-law.
Catherine: Good. Maybe you can explain why the pledge who swallowed this key ended up dead.
Frat Boy : Wha-what're you talking about?
Nick: Has anyone from omega zeta pi dropped out or gone missing?
 
Frat Boy : Uh ... yeah, Jo-Jonathan Avery Haywood III.
 
Frat Boy : Johnny. Oh, kid was a shoe-in. Dad was a member. Granddad was a member. But we haven't seen Johnny since pledge week.
Catherine: So, he's been missing for days, yet you didn't bother to call anyone?
Frat Boy : For all I knew he was getting laid. Look, I'm the fraternity president, not his mother.
Nick: We're gonna need his toothbrush and his hairbrush.
 
Plebes: Get off of me!
Frat Boy :  Button!
 
Plebes: I'm a loser.
Plebes: I'm a loser. I'm a loser.
 

 
 
Grissom: Why didn't Nick find this before?
Catherine: 'Cause he was working from a schematic the campus security gave him. The railing's not on it.
 
Catherine: This cement is fresh.
Grissom: So, now he's not just painting railings; he's installing them. We're going to need to dig this up, cement and all.
 

 
 
Catherine:  Call Brass. 
 
 
 
Grissom: So, he knew we would find this. And now he's taunting us.

 
 
 

 
 


 

 
 
(On the paper is a strand of hair. The message reads:
I HAVE HER
 
Catherine: Two years ago, DNA confirmed a hair found on Debby Reston belonged to the serial's first victim, Janet Kent.
Quick flashback to: 




 
Grissom: Planted hairs. It's part of his signature.

 
 
 

 
 
Catherine: Well, DNA confirmed that the hair found in the doll's mouth belonged to Debby Reston.
 
Grissom: I tested the note with ESDA, because I saw some indentations in the paper.
Warrick: He must've written &quot;I have her&quot; on the underlying page.
Catherine: Prior evidence indicated that the suspect was an artist or had some connection to the university's art department.
Nick: Serials typically photograph their crime scenes. If we're dealing with an artist here ... maybe he drew his victims instead.
Warrick: Looks like she's in a small room.
Grissom: What is that in the foreground? 
Warrick: Chair? Sofa?
Catherine: What about behind her?
Nick: Windows, maybe. Can we blow that up?
 
Catherine: Some kind of signage?
Grissom: And the lettering's backwards.
 
Nick: Cramped space. Chairs in the foreground, but no other furniture. No shutters or curtains on the windows. Maybe it's not a room. Maybe it's a ... vehicle.
Catherine: He was in the front seat, and he was looking at her through the rearview mirror.

 
Grissom: So, he can attack her, abduct her, rape her and strangle her, but he can't look directly at her?
 
Warrick: Guys, those black trilobal fibers that we found on Debby Reston's body were from a Chevy. 
 
Warrick: And the size and shape of those windows are consistent with a Chevy van.
 
Nick: I recognize the signage. The Erotica Boutique on Tropicana.  It's distinctive ... the font ...

 
 


Brass: Okay, break it open.

 

Grissom: So, this is where he brought them.
Catherine: The pump was probably for the doll. Beer bottles ... tell Mia to check them for saliva, as well as other bodily fluids.
Nick: You're thinking she was raped with a foreign object ... may be why we never found semen.
Brass: The police presence on the campus probably interrupted his plans for her disposal.
Catherine: I'll take the girl.
Nick:  I'll take the van.

 
 
Clerk: Huh. I would've picked you for a leather guy.
Grissom: Has anyone, uh, bought one of these coed cheerleader dolls in the last few days?
Clerk: Most popular models are the latex love-'em-or-leave-'em cheapies for bachelor parties. But in the midrange, Chrissy's not a bad choice.
Grissom: Well, I'm more interested in the clientele than the merchandise.
 
Clerk: Oh.
Grissom: I'd like to take a look at your credit card receipts. 

Grissom: Surveillance?
Clerk: Bad for business.


Grissom: You know this artist?
 
Clerk: Yeah, that is &quot;Zippy Tee.&quot;
Grissom: You have an address for him?
Clerk: Dude, I don't know where he lives.
Grissom: How do you pay him?
Clerk:  It's not the Louvre. It's the love boutique. Local guys get store credit.
Grissom: Has he ever traded for ... a doll?
Clerk:  Yeah.
Grissom: Can you describe him for me?
Clerk: White guy. Brown hair. Little shorter than you. 40, maybe 45 ... 
Clerk:  Average looking.

 
 
Robbins: This all looks eerily familiar. Blue paint on the hand. Physical signs of sexual assault. Ligature marks around the neck.
Catherine: Prints turn up anything?
Robbins: She's still a Jane Doe.
Catherine: Height and weight?
Robbins: Five-eight. 131 pounds.
Catherine: Can you take down her hair?
Robbins: Sure.
 
Robbins: Pretty.

Catherine: Pretty boy.
Robbins: Definite similarity.
Catherine: None of the other victims looked alike.
Robbins: So, why these two?
Catherine: Maybe he was a mistake.
Robbins: Mistaken for a girl?


Catherine:  This girl.



 


Catherine: We thought he selected his victims at random. He didn't. He chose her. He hunted her ... and trapped her.
FADE OUT

Mandy Cooper: The TV said you were looking for information on Kaitlin Rackish.
 
Catherine: When was the last time you saw Kaitlin?
Mandy Cooper: Monday, but I've been pledging, so I haven't slept in the dorm the last couple nights. I just thought I kept missing her.
Catherine: Can you tell me what the two of you did on Monday? All the details.
Mandy Cooper: We went to the gym. Showered. Went to the dining hall. Monday's mac-n-cheese day. It's Katy's favorite. We picked up our orders at the campus copy union -- term papers. We bought sodas at the bookstore. We went to the library to study. A couple guys from Zeta Beta Theta were at the same table, so we didn't get that much done. Then she left for her 7:00 class.
Catherine: What class is that?
Mandy Cooper: Monday's, um ... &quot;Introduction to the Female Form&quot; with Professor Lewis.
Catherine: Cody Lewis?
Mandy Cooper: He got me interested in art.

 
 
Brass: &quot;Introduction to the female form&quot;? Well, that's deep. That's really deep. I bet that brings in all the 17-year-old pre-feminists.
Cody Lewis: This isn't mine. Technique isn't bad, but it's raw. This person hasn't had any formal training at all.
Brass: Well, maybe it's your alter ego. You know, your bad-boy side; the Mr. Hyde thing.
Cody Lewis: You know, I came in voluntarily. You see, I want to help you. But this is borderlining on harassment.
Brass: Look, I'm trying to tie together some loose ends, so help me out, all right? I appreciate your help. I do. You got rid of your Chevy van. You got yourself a wife. Does she know you dated the first victim? Your return to the campus coincided with the murder of the fourth victim? And Kaitlin Rackish was in your evening classes? You see what I got?
Cody Lewis: No, I don't.
Brass: Your Buddy Mathers didn't talk much, either, and look what happened to him. He's at the wrong end of a cold needle.
Cody Lewis: You know what it's like to be told you lead the life and fit the profile of a serial killer?
Brass: No. I wouldn't have a clue.
Cody Lewis: You see, you make all these assumptions, and you're not asking questions here. You're attacking me to see how I react to what you say. Nothing I say is going to make a difference with you. So what's the point?
Brass: Why don't you just confess?
Cody Lewis: That's my point. I didn't do it.

 
(Nick and Greg examine the white Chevy van. Greg snaps a photo of the contents in the armrest storage. He takes out a parking pass.
WESTERN LAS VEGAS UNIVERSITY
PARKING PERMIT
FALL 1986
NO. 07865
Greg: WLVU parking pass. Connection to the campus. 1986. This guy's been doing this a long time.
 
Nick: Two years ago, Debby Reston broke her killer's glasses.


Nick: They were 20/80.
Greg: I'll run 'em. See if they're the same.
 
Nick: VIN's been obliterated. You better go ahead and run that parking pass.

Nick: Plate's expired. Registration sticker's a phoney.
Greg: How do you know?
Nick: Check out the serial number 
 
Greg:  Yeah, got it. Homemade.
 
Greg: Hey, did you spill print powder in the back the van?
Nick: No. No, I superglued. Why?
Greg: May have found something.

 
 
Sara: Anything from the prints off the van?
Jacqui Franco: Prints from the dash and the rearview mirror were a match to the partial that we got off the trash bag Debby Reston was found in two years ago. Same guy, but still no hits from AFIS.
 
Sara: Are the x-rated comic books ready?
Jacqui Franco: Nothing comical about them. Look at this. Double-D cups, tiny waists, bondage. Dehumanization.

Jacqui Franco: I'm all for visual stimulation, but these images are about domination, not s*x.
 
Sara: This artist gets off on dominating women. This is his s*x.

 
 
Warrick: Janet and Marcia both lived in Dakin Hall. Charlene and Debby took Econ 101. Marcia and Charlene took English Lit. Janet, Debby and Kaitlin all ate at MacGraw dining hall.
Catherine: Janet dated Cody Lewis. Kaitlin took his art class. All right, so, uh, there's not one single thing that all five women have in common.
Warrick: Right.

 
 
 
CUE SOUNDS: WOMAN'S MUFFLED GROANS
 
 
 


 
(Sara studies the comic book pages frame by frame. On her notes, she writes:

Nick: Dead plates. Tampered VIN. Registration stickers are counterfeit. The killer did a good job, though. He used the right color, changed them every year, but no serial numbers.
Grissom: So, we still don't know who owns the van.
Nick: Well, Greg did find this in the glove box.  It's from 1986. So I called school administration. It's parking spot 324. Not a student, but an employee executed two years ago. 
 
Grissom: John Mathers?
Nick: Yep. Ran Mathers through the DMV. The partial VIN Number on our van's a match. 
 
Grissom: So, our killer was driving around in Mathers' old van.
Nick: I don't think these two guys are an original and a copycat.
 
Nick: They were partners.
 
FADE OUT



 
 
John Mathers:  I don't deserve to die. You think killing me will solve anything?

 
John Mathers:  I've prepared myself, but I'm not ready.
Catherine: This the John Mathers interview?
Nick: Week before he was executed.
Journalist:  Charlene Roth's mother testified at the allocution that your death would mean her closure.
John Mathers:  Not if you kill the wrong man.
Journalist:  Forensic evidence testified to at your trial says that you're guilty.
John Mathers:  Forensic evidence changes all the time. One day I'm innocent, the next day I'm not.
Catherine: Is there anything in his prison file?
Nick: All those years on death row he only had one visitor, his lawyer. Although he did receive a far amount of letters from random women ... if he was in communication with his partner, nothing in the file shows it.
Journalist:  You've been in prison for fifteen years. During that time the murders stopped.
John Mathers:  What does that prove? The real killer's smart. 
 
John Mathers:  Watches the news, he reads the papers just like you. I'm ... man, I'm the perfect patsy.
Journalist:  So you maintain your innocence?
John Mathers:  Absolutely. I worked campus security. I'm not the smartest or the richest guy, but do I look like I had problems with women? I'm not the killer. Remember that when I'm gone.
Sara: Well, the prints on the comb bindings from the comic books are a match to the prints recovered from the van and the garbage bag that Debby Reston was in.
 
Grissom: Did you analyze the comics?
 
Sara: Yeah, and the drawings indicate a dominant, disassociative sexual sadist.
Nick: Prison shrink diagnosed Mathers as a psychopath with a dependent personality disorder.
Sara: Which means he was pre-disposed to violent crimes but he might have needed some encouragement.
Grissom: Well, to invite someone to join you for torture and murder would require a great deal of trust. You would only do it if you knew you could completely control your partner.
Catherine: Mathers was the submissive. His partner is the alpha male.
Grissom: Sexual sadism can go hand in hand with sexual dysfunction. Mathers said that he wasn't the killer, but we confirmed that he had s*x with Charlene Roth, based on the fact that we found his pubic hairs on her body.
Catherine: Mia was looking for saliva on the beer bottles from the van and found a vaginal contribution on the neck of one of them.
Nick: Maybe Mathers was this guy's surrogate pen1s.
Catherine: Question. The partner kills on the eve of Mathers' execution, and again this week, on the second anniversary.  Why the no-show last year?
Grissom: Maybe life got in the way.
 
David Hodges: Nick, that black powder from the back of the van is ink. A toner made exclusively for commercial copy machines. OCE 3600.
Nick: Okay. Thanks, Hodges.
 
Catherine: The most recent victim went to the campus copy union with her roommate on the day she disappeared. Janet Kent's ...
 
Catherine: ... pocket contents -- a receipt from WLVU Copy Union. On Debby Reston's backseat ...  ... catalogs with comb bindings.



Brass: Who'd you find?
Campus Security Officer 2: Kevin Greer. Works at the copy union. Only employee who's been there over ten years; since 1983.
Brass: Fits our profile.


 
Brass: Where's Kevin Greer?
Copy Center Worker: He just left. He works till eight.
Brass: Time for evening classes to let out.
Copy Center Worker: What's going on?
Brass: Look, we'd like to talk to Kevin Greer. You have any idea where he is?
Copy Center Worker: No. We don't hang out.
Brass: How many people work here?
Copy Center Worker: Just me.
Brass: Okay, we need to look around.
Copy Center Worker: Okay.
 
Catherine: Black plastic trash bags with toner powder.  
Catherine: Excuse me. Does Kevin Greer use this machine for any of his personal projects?
Copy Center Worker: Yeah. He binds his comic books.


 
 
Brass: Kevin Greer, Las Vegas police!  Hit it.
 
Officer: Let's go!
 
Voice:  Clear!
 
Voice:  All clear.
 
Voice:  Got it. Clear.
 
 
Catherine: A paint mixer.
Grissom: WLVU blue.
Catherine: So he mixed his own paint so we couldn't trace the origin of his purchase.
 
Kevin Greer:  Las Vegas's finest. Nice job. Impressive turnout. Have a look around. I'll be here at the station waiting for you.

 
 
Kevin Greer: Gil, Jim.
 
Kevin Greer: Yeah, my rule was: If you made it to my house, you deserved to meet me. I mean, how much time did you guys spend picturing the size of my hands? Huh.  Not very big. You don't need big hands, though, not the way I do it. Just ... just a little at a time.
 
Grissom: Take life, give it back. God-like.
Kevin Greer: God-like? No. But there must be something angelic in the way I look, because even on their last breath, they didn't think I'd actually do it.
 Am I disappointing you guys? I mean, are you looking at me, wishing I was ... scarier?
Grissom: No.
 
Grissom: I was, uh, wondering what happened to your glasses. 
Kevin Greer: Stupid lasik. It's what got me caught.
Grissom: Is it?
Kevin Greer: When that Debby bitch busted my glasses ... 
 
Kevin Greer: I decided they were a liability. But the procedure didn't take.
Grissom: Is that why you missed last year's anniversary?
 
Kevin Greer:  And my night vision still sucks.
Grissom: Johnny?
Kevin Greer: I don't want to talk about him.
Grissom: Well, you, uh, kept him for several days before you chopped him up.
Brass: Were you having a good time?
 
Kevin Greer: I'm not into boys.


 
Kevin Greer:  Kid was in my freezer.

Grissom: Tell us about Charlene Roth.
Kevin Greer: You had to bring her up. You know, I tried to talk him out of it, but, uh, J.M wouldn't ...
Brass: John Mathers.
Kevin Greer: Yeah. He had something to prove. See, he didn't understand that we were better together than we would ever be apart.  He needed me.
Brass: Soul mates.
Kevin Greer: Contrary to popular belief, even people like us have souls. I spent fifteen years looking for a solid replacement, but you only get that lucky once in a lifetime.
Grissom: You miss him.
Kevin Greer: I created him.
Brass: But you let him take the fall.
Kevin Greer: He got caught. That's the price you pay for incompetence.
Brass: Death.
Kevin Greer: That's what you deserve when you make a mistake.

 

 
 
 
Catherine: There's a sixth victim. A Brit or Brittany Mosscoe. Her name was on a ziploc bag in Greer's freezer. It contained a lock of hair. Sara's looking into Missing Persons. And Mia's running it through DNA.
Grissom: Thanks.
 

 
Grissom: Where is, uh ... Brit Mosscoe?
 
Kevin Greer: There's a lot of fight in her.
Grissom: Is she old or new?
 
Kevin Greer: I'll take you to her.  Oh, we'll need a full tank of gas.

Catherine:  Slow down. Okay ... okay. I got it.
 
Catherine: The sixth victim is a ruse. He drew her off a calendar. Brit Mosscoe is an anagram for Miss October.
Grissom: So where's he taking us?

 
 
Brass: Mr. Greer, let's go. Come on.
 
Brass: Mr. Greer? Where is he, in there?

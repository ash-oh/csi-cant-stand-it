							<p>COLD OPEN:</p>
<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[EXT. UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(A college man runs across campus. He's blind-folded and dressed in a pair of women's bra and panties, his wrists bound and elbows taped to his body.) </p>
<p>(Three other college boys chase after him.</p>
<p><strong>Frat Boy</strong>: Say it loud and say it proud!</p>
<p>PLEDGE: Omega zeta pi!</p>
<p>(Two of the frat boys carry paddles in their hands as they chase the inductee around the campus grounds.) </p>
<p><strong>Frat Boy</strong>: Say it loud and say it proud!</p>
<p>PLEDGE: Omega zeta pi!</p>
<p>(The Inductee runs and trips over something. He lands in a pile of worms. The three frat boys chasing him stop and stare at him. Because the Inductee is blindfolded, he spits the worms out of his mouth)</p>
<p>PLEDGE: Dude ... (he spits) What's crawling on my face?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(Camera zooms in for a close-up of the maggots.)</p>
<p>[EXT. UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - GROUNDS -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Eva and Grissom stand in front of the pile of maggots.) </p>
<p><strong>Eva</strong>: It's fraternity hell week. A pledge slipped and fell in this pile of maggots. School of agriculture is in charge of campus landscaping, so security called me. (deadpans) You were the first person I thought of.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, thank you, Eva. I'm honored.</p>
<p>(She smiles at him.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You make your own mulch?</p>
<p><strong>Eva</strong>: The university is self-sustaining. A city within a city. State institutions are encouraged to practice xeriscaping.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: &quot;Xeri&quot; meaning dry?</p>
<p><strong>Eva</strong>: Landscaping using drought-tolerant plant life. Conserves water. There's no reason for these maggots to be here.</p>
<p>(Campus Security Officer #1, Brian, walks up to them carrying a cup.) </p>
<p><strong>Campus Security Officer Brian</strong>: Dr. Grissom, your tea. Hold the tea bag?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Thank you, Brian. </p>
<p>(Grissom takes the cup and kneels down in front of the maggots. Eva kneels down with him.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to Eva) Do, uh ... do you use scraps from the dining halls for your compost?</p>
<p>(Grissom takes some maggots as samples and puts it in the cup of hot water.) </p>
<p><strong>Eva</strong>: No. Why?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, if the devil requires a pound of flesh, this many maggots would require over a hundred.</p>
<p><strong>Eva</strong>: Pounds of flesh?</p>
<p>(Grissom looks down at the maggots and sees something. Among the maggots, he finds a tooth. He picks it up and looks at it.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Were you aware that the average college student weighs 135 pounds?</p>
<p>(Eva and Grissom look at each other.) </p>
<p>FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. UNIVERSITY CAMPUS - GROUNDS -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Nick scoops some maggots out from the pile and puts them in a bucket. Both he and Grissom are gathering the maggots. Eva and Dean Wilson stand on the side and watch.) </p>
<p><strong>Dean Wilson</strong>: How long is this going to take? </p>
<p><strong>Eva</strong>: If something happened to one of our students, don't you want to know?</p>
<p><strong>Dean Wilson</strong>: Sure. </p>
<p>(He looks around the campus where the crime scene has drawn a small crowd of students.)</p>
<p><strong>Dean Wilson</strong>: But on a campus this size, there's a thin line between satisfying curiosity and creating panic.</p>
<p>(Grissom, who is listening in on the conversation, answers.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This stopped being about my curiosity the minute we found a human tooth. We're now investigating a possible homicide.</p>
<p>(Nick stops shoveling and takes out a single maggot. He leans over to Grissom and whispers something on his mind.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, Grissom, why is it hot?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Maggot digestion can generate heat up to 125 degrees. Heat increases the rate of putrefaction, which speeds up the digestive process.</p>
<p>(Nick nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I don't see any tissue. How long would it take for them to pick a body clean?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Assuming it's just one body? A few days.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, and that's another thing. I have a hard time believing that if a corpse was here, no one saw it. And these bones? (Nick picks up one.) They're uniform. Same shape and size.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah. (Grissom picks up something.) Same size as these wood chips.</p>
<p>(They both come to the same conclusion.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. RESIDENCE -- BACKYARD -- DAY] </p>
<p>(A mulching machine spews out mulch.) </p>
<p>(Grissom walks around the pile of wood chips and up to the machine operator, Walter Beerly. The machine operator turns the machine off.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This thing always this loud?</p>
<p><strong>Walter Beerly</strong>: Yeah, but we're, we're kind of off the beaten path.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You use it every day?</p>
<p><strong>Walter Beerly</strong>: Pretty much.</p>
<p>(Grissom walks around and takes a look at the feeder part of the machine. He points to the small area between the gears.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You think a human body could fit through there?</p>
<p><strong>Walter Beerly</strong>: You planning something?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Gil Grissom, Las Vegas Crime Lab.</p>
<p><strong>Walter Beerly</strong>: Walter Beerly, master of the universe. Six cylinders. 200 horse power. Thing's got an engine that would give most SUVs a run for their money. And it's got one job. Chopping crap up.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So the answer's yes.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV: The mulching machine is on. A pair of hands move toward the gears. There's mulching sounds as the machine consumes the body, a large spurt of blood and flesh is spewed out of the other end of the machine -- all in neat, uniform size and shape little pieces.)</p>
<p>(End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Walter Beerly</strong>: Would take about fifteen seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: May I?</p>
<p><strong>Walter Beerly</strong>: You want to stick your head in there, be my guest.</p>
<p>(Grissom leans in and sprays the inside of the feeder.)</p>
<p><strong>Walter Beerly</strong>: What are you looking for?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Blood.</p>
<p><strong>Walter Beerly</strong>: Oh, you're pretty much out of luck, 'cause I've been chipping all morning, and if there was any in there, it's probably gone. See, wood absorbs moisture. One of the reasons they use it for mulch.</p>
<p>(Grissom stops and nods.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(Grissom leans in and takes a swab of the gears. He rubs it on the tester.)</p>
<p><strong>Walter Beerly</strong>: Pregnant?</p>
<p>(Grissom shows him the results.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's human.</p>
<p>(Walter Beerly looks at Grissom.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - DNA LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Greg is in the middle of the lab. All around him, he's got containers of maggots. He's separating the maggots from the dirt and going through the dirt at the same time.) </p>
<p>(Greg turns around and finds Nick standing on the other side of the table. Nick looks at his watch.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Remember, you're on the clock, man. About, uh, twenty-four hours ... all of these maggots turn into flies.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I know.</p>
<p>(Nick turns and leaves the lab. Greg continues to work.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Grissom is operating on a maggot when Mia Dickerson walks in. She puts her lab coat on. Grissom doesn't raise his head. She walks over to him to see what he's doing.) </p>
<p><strong>Mia Dickerson</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Day shift told me you didn't get any results off the tooth.</p>
<p>(Grissom cuts the maggot open.) </p>
<p><strong>Mia Dickerson</strong>: Yeah, it was a porcelain crown. Root canal. No viable pulp.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I still need a DNA profile on our victim. </p>
<p><strong>Mia Dickerson</strong>: And since bone marrow extraction can be difficult ...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I figured I'd go straight to the source. </p>
<p>(Grissom pulls out the maggot guts.)</p>
<p><strong>Mia Dickerson</strong>: Well, maggots are eating machines. They'll have DNA from the flesh. It's genius.</p>
<p>(Grissom hands her the dish with the maggot guts inside.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Thank you. </p>
<p><strong>Mia Dickerson</strong>: One maggot colada, coming up.</p>
<p>(Mia leaves the lab.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Greg continues to work on separating the maggots from the dirt. Catherine walks in from the hallway. He's working and counting in Spanish.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What's with the tape?</p>
<p>(Greg pulls down his mask.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: The evidence wasn't cooperating, so I stuck it to them.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (under her breath) Cute. </p>
<p>(Greg hears her anyway and smiles.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Anything of interest?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, I haven't had much time for analysis. So far the only inorganics are these black plastic shreds, from a garbage bag, I think, and ... this. </p>
<p>(Greg hands Catherine a vial with something inside coated a bit with blue. Catherine opens it and looks at it.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, blue trace is tacky to the touch.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It's a fingernail.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Sara is in the lab working on the computer. Catherine walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Uh, sorry, Sara. I need the microscope. Priority.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I got three more samples to run. When I'm finished, it'll be your turn.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: This can't wait.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It can't? Or you can't?</p>
<p>(Sara looks at Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Both. Go have a cup of coffee on me.</p>
<p>(Sara stands up.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The coffee's free.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>(Catherine sits down as Sara leaves the lab.) </p>
<p>(Catherine takes out the fingernail sample and puts it in the scope.)</p>
<p>[ANALYSIS] </p>
<p>(It reads:<br />
Case Number:<br />

Sample:<br />
Fingernail with<br />
Unknown Blue<br />

Component 1:<br />
Motor Oil<br />
Component 2:<br />
Blue Color Paint</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - GRISSOM'S OFFICE - DAY]</p>
<p>(Catherine walks into the office.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oil-based blue paint mixed with motor oil ... </p>
<p>(Catherine hands the analysis results to Grissom. He takes it and looks at it.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He's back.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Brass briefs the teams. He narrates as photos appear on the overhead wall of the victims. Catherine stands in the front.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Starting in 1987, a series of murders occurred on the WLVU campus. Three women: Janet Kent ... Marcia Reese ... and Charlene Roth. Now, Charlene Roth's murder provided us with enough evidence to investigate a suspect ... John Mathers, WLVU security guard. He was arrested, tried and convicted. Two years ago, this week, he was executed. The night of his execution, Debby Reston was murdered.</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Copycat, right?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No. We believe that Mathers was the copycat, responsible only for Charlene Roth's death.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Which means the serial killer is still at large. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And we have reason to believe that he has killed again. Our suspect's M.O. is to apply blue paint to a campus railing ... </p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH:</p>
<p>[EXT. CRIME SCENE - DAY]</p>
<p>(Cut to: Nick leans in close to look at a metal railing. He reaches out and touches the paint on the railing.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) ... that he has infused with motor oil to retard the drying process.</p>
<p>CUT BACK TO: </p>
<p>(On the overhead, there's a photo of the metal railing.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: He then lays in wait for a female victim to touch the railing.</p>
<p>(Cut to: [WATER FOUNTAIN] Sarah examines the water fountain.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) It's always near a water fountain. He then grabs them from behind as they're washing the paint from their hands.</p>
<p>(Catherine continues to brief the officers.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Our suspect's prior victims were all sexually assaulted. No semen was found. Cause of death: Strangulation.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: He stuffed them in black plastic trash bags</p>
<p>Quick flashback to: </p>
<p>[Scene from 3X06: The Execution of Catherine Willows]</p>
<p>[EXT. UNIVERSITY - LIBRARY -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Catherine examines the body in the garbage bag dumped.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (V.O.) ... and dumps the bodies in plain sight.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Given that he has been killing for around twenty years, we approximate his age to be ... </p>
<p>(Quick flash of: [UNIVERSITY CAMPUS] Slow motion. Camera lingers on men of Various types fitting that description walking on campus.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) ... at least thirty-five. He may wear glasses. He may drive a Chevy with black interior.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer 2</strong>: The latest victim was put in a wood chipper. Why the change in M.O.?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Serials have been known to change their signatures because they have to. Fear of being caught ... interruption ... or it could just be an act of escalation.</p>
<p>[PHOTOS ON BOARD]</p>
<p>(Camera slowly moves over the Past victim crime scene photos hanging on the boards.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (V.O.) So we're looking for a sadistic, ritualistic, organized sociopath. </p>
<p>(Camera pulls back and we find Grissom standing in front of the photo board staring at the crime scenes.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (V.O.) We'll be on 12 and 12s. No holidays, no vacations until this is solved.</p>
<p>(Camera holds on Grissom.) </p>
<p>FADE OUT</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - FRONT SIDEWALK -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Catherine is surrounded by reporters.) </p>
<p><strong>Reporter</strong>: Ms. Willows, can you confirm that the blue paint killer has claimed another victim?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I haven't been cleared for comment.</p>
<p><strong>Reporter</strong>: Ms. Willows, was John Mathers wrongfully convicted?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: </p>
<p>[Scene from 3X06: The Execution of Catherine Willows]</p>
<p>[INT. LAS VEGAS PRISON - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(John Mathers is strapped to the table. He turns his head and looks at Catherine sitting in the witness booth.)</p>
<p><strong>Reporter</strong>: (V.O.) Did the state execute an innocent man?</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: John Mathers killed Charlene Roth and was punished for it.</p>
<p>(The reporters to shout out their questions.) </p>
<p><strong>Reporter</strong>: (shouts) You sure this isn't a copycat?! REPORTER: Well, how can you be so sure of that?</p>
<p>(Catherine turns and walks away. The reporters continue to shout out their questions.) </p>
<p><strong>Reporter</strong>: Ms. Willows? REPORTER: Ms. Willows!</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Mia Dickerson reports her findings to Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Mia Dickerson</strong>: I double-checked the results. The DNA from the maggots is male.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Any possible cross-contamination?</p>
<p><strong>Mia Dickerson</strong>: No, the samples were pure.</p>
<p>(Grissom sighs and turns as he leaves the lab.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY - DAY -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Warrick walks through the hallway and catches Grissom coming out of the lab.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Griss, this place is crawling with press. They want a statement.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Not now.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, if you don't say anything, they're just going to fill in the blanks ... </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Screw the press, 'cause for all I know, the dead body is an auto mechanic who just painted his house blue.</p>
<p>(Grissom walks down the hallway. Warrick watches him go, shakes his head and heads down the hallway in the other direction.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Greg is going through the dirt. He finds two halves of a gold-colored key.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. OMEGA ZETA PI FRATERNITY HOUSE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Catherine holds up the little bag with the key inside showing it to the Frat Boy.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What's this key used for?</p>
<p><strong>Frat Boy (#56)</strong>: Um, pledging. Plebes are asked to swallow it on the first night of hell week.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Then &quot;retrieve&quot; it and return it by the end of the week, right?</p>
<p><strong>Frat Boy (#56)</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You know that hazing is illegal. You could lose your charter.</p>
<p><strong>Frat Boy (#56)</strong>: Well, it's not hazing. It's a voluntary loyalty ritual.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Political science major?</p>
<p><strong>Frat Boy (#56)</strong>: Pre-law.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Good. Maybe you can explain why the pledge who swallowed this key ended up dead.</p>
<p><strong>Frat Boy (#56)</strong>: Wha-what're you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Has anyone from omega zeta pi dropped out or gone missing?</p>
<p>(He thinks about it. He stands up and goes to the whiteboard with the photos of the plebes on it.) </p>

<p><strong>John Mathers</strong>: (from video) Not if you kill the wrong man.</p>
<p><strong>Journalist</strong>: (from video) Forensic evidence testified to at your trial says that you're guilty.</p>
<p><strong>John Mathers</strong>: (from video) Forensic evidence changes all the time. One day I'm innocent, the next day I'm not.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Is there anything in his prison file?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: All those years on death row he only had one visitor, his lawyer. Although he did receive a far amount of letters from random women ... if he was in communication with his partner, nothing in the file shows it.</p>
<p><strong>Journalist</strong>: (from video) You've been in prison for fifteen years. During that time the murders stopped.</p>
<p><strong>John Mathers</strong>: (from video) What does that prove? The real killer's smart. </p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Prison shrink diagnosed Mathers as a psychopath with a dependent personality disorder.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Which means he was pre-disposed to violent crimes but he might have needed some encouragement.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, to invite someone to join you for torture and murder would require a great deal of trust. You would only do it if you knew you could completely control your partner.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mathers was the submissive. His partner is the alpha male.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sexual sadism can go hand in hand with sexual dysfunction. Mathers said that he wasn't the killer, but we confirmed that he had s*x with Charlene Roth, based on the fact that we found his pubic hairs on her body.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mia was looking for saliva on the beer bottles from the van and found a vaginal contribution on the neck of one of them.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Maybe Mathers was this guy's surrogate pen1s.</p>

<p>(Brass walks out of the Copy Union with the Worker following him.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Where's Kevin Greer?</p>
<p><strong>Copy Center Worker</strong>: He just left. He works till eight.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Time for evening classes to let out.</p>
<p><strong>Copy Center Worker</strong>: What's going on?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Look, we'd like to talk to Kevin Greer. You have any idea where he is?</p>
<p><strong>Copy Center Worker</strong>: No. We don't hang out.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: How many people work here?</p>
<p><strong>Copy Center Worker</strong>: Just me.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Okay, we need to look around.</p>
<p><strong>Copy Center Worker</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(Brass steps away as Catherine finishes putting her gloves on. She looks into the trash and finds some black toner powder.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Black plastic trash bags with toner powder. (She looks over at the Copy Center Worker.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Excuse me. Does Kevin Greer use this machine for any of his personal projects?</p>
<p><strong>Copy Center Worker</strong>: Yeah. He binds his comic books.</p>
<p>(Catherine looks at Brass. They both leave.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. GREER RESIDENCE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(LVPD surround the small residence. Brass runs up to the front door with a couple of other officers. He crouches down.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Kevin Greer, Las Vegas police! (to the officer) Hit it.</p>
<p>(The Officer batter-rams the door.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Let's go!</p>
<p>(The officers and Brass enter the residence.) </p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong>: (o.s.) Clear!</p>
<p>(Brass slowly makes his way down the hallway. The officers rush through the rooms clearing it.) </p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong>: (o.s.) All clear.</p>
<p>(Brass continues to walk cautiously through the hallway.) </p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong>: (o.s.) Check that noise! VOICE: (o.s.) Clear. VOICE: (o.s.) Clear. VOICE: (o.s.) Got it. Clear.</p>
<p>(At the far end of the hallway, there's a loud rattling machine mixing something. He looks at it. Grissom and Catherine step into the room.) </p>
<p>(Catherine walks up to the machine. Brass turns it off. The room is extremely silent.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: A paint mixer.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: WLVU blue.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So he mixed his own paint so we couldn't trace the origin of his purchase.</p>
<p>(The phone rings. The answering machine clicks on.) </p>
<p><strong>Kevin Greer</strong>: (from machine) Las Vegas's finest. Nice job. Impressive turnout. Have a look around. I'll be here at the station waiting for you.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Kevin Greer sits at the interview table with a stack of papers in his hands. He turns around and smiles as Brass and Grissom walk into the room.) </p>
<p><strong>Kevin Greer</strong>: Gil, Jim.</p>
<p>(He smiles at them as they sit down across from him.) </p>
<p><strong>Kevin Greer</strong>: Yeah, my rule was: If you made it to my house, you deserved to meet me. I mean, how much time did you guys spend picturing the size of my hands? Huh. (He shows them.) Not very big. You don't need big hands, though, not the way I do it. Just ... just a little at a time.</p>
<p>(He looks at Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Take life, give it back. God-like.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Greer</strong>: God-like? No. But there must be something angelic in the way I look, because even on their last breath, they didn't think I'd actually do it.<br />
(He continues to draw as he talks.) Am I disappointing you guys? I mean, are you looking at me, wishing I was ... scarier?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No.</p>
<p>(Grissom takes his glasses off.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I was, uh, wondering what happened to your glasses. </p>
<p><strong>Kevin Greer</strong>: Stupid lasik. It's what got me caught.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Is it?</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Greer</strong>: When that Debby bitch busted my glasses ... </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [EXT. - NIGHT] Debby Reston grabs his glasses and breaks them as she struggles. End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Kevin Greer</strong>: I decided they were a liability. But the procedure didn't take.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Is that why you missed last year's anniversary?</p>
<p>(He looks at Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Kevin Greer</strong>: (chuckles) And my night vision still sucks.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Johnny?</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Greer</strong>: I don't want to talk about him.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, you, uh, kept him for several days before you chopped him up.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Were you having a good time?</p>
<p>(Kevin looks at Brass and Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Kevin Greer</strong>: I'm not into boys.</p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH:</p>
<p>[INT. GREER RESIDENCE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Catherine opens the large freezer up.) </p>
<p><strong>Kevin Greer</strong>: (o.s.) Kid was in my freezer.</p>
<p>(They look inside. Sara snaps a couple of photos. She gasps.) </p>
<p>(Taped against the side of the freezer are locks of hair in a plastic bag along with a comic caricature of the frightened woman.)</p>
<p>KAITLIN RACKISH<br />
DEBBY RESTON<br />
MARCIA REESE</p>
<p>(Catherine snaps photos of the baggies. Sara looks at the locks of hair.) </p>
<p>BRIT MOSSCOE</p>
<p>(Catherine puts her camera down.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Wait a minute.</p>
<p>(She counts them.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (softly) One, two, three, four, five, six. (louder) There are six here.</p>
<p>(She looks back at Sara.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We only know of five.</p>
<p>(She reaches inside and takes out the sixth baggie: BRIT MOSSCOE.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Tell us about Charlene Roth.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Greer</strong>: You had to bring her up. You know, I tried to talk him out of it, but, uh, J.M wouldn't ...</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: John Mathers.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Greer</strong>: Yeah. He had something to prove. See, he didn't understand that we were better together than we would ever be apart. (He goes back to the drawing.) He needed me.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Soul mates.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Greer</strong>: Contrary to popular belief, even people like us have souls. I spent fifteen years looking for a solid replacement, but you only get that lucky once in a lifetime.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You miss him.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Greer</strong>: I created him.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: But you let him take the fall.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Greer</strong>: He got caught. That's the price you pay for incompetence.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Death.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Greer</strong>: That's what you deserve when you make a mistake.</p>
<p>(He looks at Grissom.)</p>
<p>(There's a knock at the door.) </p>
<p>(Kevin Green glances behind him.)</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY OUTSIDE INTERVIEW ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(Grissom stands up and steps outside.) </p>
<p>(Catherine hands him a slip of paper.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: There's a sixth victim. A Brit or Brittany Mosscoe. Her name was on a ziploc bag in Greer's freezer. It contained a lock of hair. Sara's looking into Missing Persons. And Mia's running it through DNA.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>(Grissom heads back into the interview room.) </p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Grissom sits down.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Where is, uh ... Brit Mosscoe?</p>
<p>(Kevin Greer looks at Grissom and Brass. He smiles.) </p>
<p><strong>Kevin Greer</strong>: There's a lot of fight in her.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Is she old or new?</p>
<p>(Kevin Greer continues to draw. He finishes and stops. He looks at them.) </p>
<p><strong>Kevin Greer</strong>: I'll take you to her. (to Brass) Oh, we'll need a full tank of gas.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. GREER RESIDENCE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Sara is back at the residence. On the freezer cover, she has all the baggies and locks of hair spread out with their corresponding drawings placed under them.) </p>
<p>(Camera moves over the drawings and bags of hair.)</p>
<p>JANET KENT<br />
KAITLIN RACKISH<br />
BRIT MOSSCOE</p>
<p>(Sara's phone rings. She answers it.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (to phone) Hello. Yeah, I'm trying to confirm that you have no record of a Brit Mosscoe attending WLVU in the last eighteen years. (pause) What about a night student? (pause) Okay, thanks.</p>
<p>(Sara hangs up.)</p>
<p>(She picks up the drawing of Brit Mosscoe and looks at it.) </p>
<p>(Sara looks around the room and she notices a calendar pinned up on the wall. The picture of the woman in the calendar looks like the woman in the drawing.) </p>
<p>(Sara removes the calendar from the wall and compares it to the drawing.) </p>
<p>(It's the same woman.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY OUTSIDE INTERVIEW ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(Brass, Grissom and a couple of officers escort Kevin Greer through the hallway.) </p>
<p><strong>Kevin Greer</strong>: Hey, uh, can I go to the bathroom before we go?</p>
<p>(They stop. Brass turns around and looks at Kevin Greer.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>(The two officers escort Kevin to the restroom.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Bobbie, pat him down.</p>
<p>(The officers pat Kevin Greer down looking for weapons. He takes his pencil away from him.)</p>
<p>(They step into the bathroom.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(The officer checks the bathroom stalls.) </p>
<p>(Finding them clear, the officers allow Kevin into the stall. They close the door behind him.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. GREER RESIDENCE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Back at the house, Sara realizes that BRIT MOSSCOE is an anagram for MISS OCTOBER.) </p>
<p>(She calls Catherine.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(Catherine steps out of the room and into the hallway where Brass and Grissom are waiting for Kevin Greer to return from the bathroom.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to phone) Slow down. Okay ... okay. I got it.</p>
<p>(She hangs up.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The sixth victim is a ruse. He drew her off a calendar. Brit Mosscoe is an anagram for Miss October.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So where's he taking us?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(Brass opens the bathroom door and steps inside.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Mr. Greer, let's go. Come on.</p>
<p>(He turns inside and finds the two officers just outside the stalls. Grissom follows him.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Mr. Greer? Where is he, in there?</p>
<p>(An officer points to the stall.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Come on, Mr. Greer, let's go!</p>
<p>(Brass opens the stall door. Grissom sees the garbage bag over Kevin Greer's face.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Damn it! </p>
<p>(Brass and Grissom step inside and rip the garbage bag off of Kevin Greer's face.) </p>
<p>(Grissom pulls Kevin Greer out of the stall and onto the bathroom floor.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Get a paramedic!</p>
<p>(Grissom starts to do heart compressions on Kevin Greer. Catherine steps into the restroom.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Get an EMT in here!</p>
<p>(There's no response. Grissom continues to do compressions. Still, there's no response. Grissom stops.)</p>
<p>(Brass shakes his head.) </p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO:</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(The view is fuzzy as Grissom steps out of the bathroom and into the hallway. He stops in front of the interview room.) </p>
<p>(He looks inside and sees something.)</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(On the interview table is the sketch pad Kevin Greer was drawing on when they questioned him. Grissom takes his glasses out and looks at the drawing.)</p>
<p>(It's of Grissom with various images of himself - tortured, scared and terrified - as seen through the reflection of Grissom's glasses.)</p>
<p>(Smaller images of the victims, tied up and terrified is in the sketch.)</p>
<p>(As Grissom looks at the pictures, we hear the sounds of the victims' cries in the background.) </p>
<p>(Grissom tri-foldover's the sketch into a larger picture of Grissom.)</p>
<p>(In the image reflected off the glasses is a man with final words coming out of his mouth: GOOD BYE)</p>
<p>(Camera holds on Grissom.) </p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK</p>

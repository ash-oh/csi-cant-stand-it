[EXT. LAS VEGAS -- RITTLE RESIDENCE - NIGHT]</p>
<hr />
[INT. (LAS VEGAS) RITTLE RESIDENCE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Inside the residence, the RITTLES are hosting a party. There are lots of food, caviar, good music and conversation. Cut to a camera close up of a champagne bottle opening with a loud 'pop'.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. RITTLE RESIDENCE -- OUTSIDE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(The camera shows the backyard outside. The camera slowly rises up to show a little blonde-haired girl looking out of the second floor window.)</p>
<p>(Camera cuts to show the little girl's POV as she sees a man and a woman run playfully across the lawn below. They're laughing.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. RESIDENCE - DOWNSTAIRS]</p>
<p>(A blonde-haired woman is sitting on a man's lap. A dark-haired woman runs up to him. She's laughing and throws herself into the man's arms. So, now he's got one arm wrapped around a different woman.)</p>
<p><strong>Dark-haired Woman</strong>: We should have these parties more than once a month.</p>
<p><strong>Chief Rittle</strong>: I would, but Mina tends to get jealous.</p>
<p><strong>Dark-haired Woman</strong>: I love you, Chief, but if anybody should be jealous, it's you. </p>
<p>(They all laugh. The man &quot;Chief&quot; looks up and sees a dark male figure standing in the shadows. The man walks away.) </p>
<p><strong>Chief Rittle</strong>: Who's that guy?</p>
<p>(The Dark-Haired woman wants the &quot;Chief&quot;s attention. She gently turns his head toward her.)</p>
<p><strong>Dark-haired Woman</strong>: Hey, Chief ... didn't know you were into guys.</p>
<p>(MINA RITTLE looks up to look for the man. The man is gone.)</p>
<p><strong>Mina Rittle</strong>: What guy?</p>
<p>(There's no sign on him.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT (LAS VEGAS) RESIDENCE UPSTAIRS - SASHA RITTLE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The door opens and the little blonde-haired girl peers through the door. She sees a man and two women go into the bedroom across the hall. Before closing the door, the man looks around to see if anyone sees them.)</p>
<p>(The little girl closes the door, retreating back into her room. She runs onto her bed and gets in under the covers. She glances over at that bedside clock. It reads 12:20 a.m. She settles in to go to sleep.)</p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT (LAS VEGAS) RESIDENCE - UPSTAIRS - SASHA RITTLE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Camera close up on the alarm clock that now reads: 3:45 a.m.)</p>
<p>(Through the silence, two gunshots abruptly wake up the blonde-haired girl. She sits up in bed and looks at the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Sasha Rittle</strong>: Daddy?</p>
<p>(She gets out of bed and takes a cautious step toward the door.)</p>
<p>(The door opens. The light from the hallway filters in on SASHA RITTLE'S scared face as the camera focuses in on her.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. RITTLE RESIDENCE - DAY]</p>
<p>(Multiple police cars are parked in the driveway.)</p>
<hr />
[INT. (LAS VEGAS) RESIDENCE]</p>
<p>(BRASS walks into the foyer followed by GRISSOM and CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So two nights ago he has a party. High-end guest list, very private. That was the last anyone saw of him. Housekeeper arrives 20 minutes ago. This is what she found.</p>
<p>(BRASS leads GRISSOM and CATHERINE to the dining room where they find CHIEF RITTLE on the dining room table, naked with an apple stuffed in his mouth. CATHERINE looks at BRASS. BRASS nods.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Ex-chief of detectives. Left to make the big bucks. Consultant with security at every major casino in town and couldn't even protect himself.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: There's only one interpretation for this: &quot;Kill the pig.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And what about the rest of his family?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No sign of the wife.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What about the daughter?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Housekeeper assumed that she spent the weekend with the grandmother.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE'S eyes widen at BRASS' choice of words.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Assumed?</p>
<p>(She immediately leaves the room and heads for the little girl's room.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. (LAS VEGAS) SASHA RITTLE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE rushes in to the upstairs bedroom. She walks into the closet and looks inside. She goes to the bed and moves the covers aside.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM enters the room, followed closely by BRASS. CATHERINE turns around and sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: She's gone.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO: END OF TEASER. ROLL TITLE CREDITS.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<hr />
[EXT. (LAS VEGAS) RITTLE RESIDENCE - DAY]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM fills the rest of the team in as they walk up the driveway to the main house.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: His wife and daughter are missing. His silver Cadillac DTS is also missing. We're looking for any signs of forced entry in the house, any signs of ransack that's not associated with the party.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(SARA leaves. BRASS meets GRISSOM, WARRICK and NICK at the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We need serious damage control. When the media gets a hold of it it's going to be bad for morale all around. Watch your step.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'll take the downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, I'll be above you.</p>
<p>(They walk out of frame.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. RITTLE RESIDENCE - DINING ROOM - DAY -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(ROBBINS does a cursory exam for GRISSOM. CATHERINE is examining the rest of the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Looks execution-style. At least one shot to the back of the head. A lot of bruising around these handcuffs.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So he probably fought back.</p>
<p>(Next to the dining room chair on the floor, CATHERINE finds something.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Found a shell casing. </p>
<p>(She picks it up and examines it.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Looks like one of ours.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Nine millimeter standard issue.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So where do you suppose the Chief keeps his gun safe?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
SCENE #08</p>
<p>[INT. - RITTLE RESIDENCE - DAY]</p>
<p>(Camera close up on a safecracking technician using a drill on the door of a safe. BRASS puts on his gloves while he and CATHERINE watch from a distance.)</p>
<p>(The Technician puts the drill down and pushes a scope through the hole.)</p>
<p>(Quick CGI scope view of the lock mechanism of the safe inside the safe door. The gears turns. End of CGI POV.)</p>
<p>(The Technician turns the dial. BRASS and CATHERINE watch.) </p>
<p>(As he turns the dial, the inside mechanism releases the lock.)</p>
<p><strong>Scott</strong>: We're in.</p>
<p>(He puts his equipment down and opens the safe. He moves aside.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Thank you, Scott.</p>
<p><strong>Scott</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p>(The Technician leaves. CATHERINE looks inside the safe.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What do you got? </p>
<p>(CATHERINE hands a gun to BRASS. He checks it.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Thirty-eight (.38).</p>
<p>(CATHERINE hands a second gun to BRASS.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Pearl handle Twenty-five (.25). </p>
<p>(He checks it.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Clear?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Still looking for that Nine (.9).</p>
<p>(CATHERINE takes out a box and opens it. The gun is gone.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So you think the Chief might've kept his signature piece someplace else?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (reading) &quot;For Twenty-Five years of distinguished service.&quot; An honor like that. Keep it in the case.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (nods) Yeah.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. RITTLE RESIDENCE - FRONT DRIVE - DAY]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE is walking down the driveway with GRISSOM. They're headed toward the gate.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So I'm thinking that the wife might be in on this.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Why didn't she plan better? Pack the kid's clothes.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The nanny told me that she only took one shirt -- one the kid wouldn't even wear.</p>
<p>(They reach the gate where DET. LOCKWOOD is questioning the gate security guard.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. Lockwood</strong>: Security guard. No party list but he did see each car that left the night of the party and morning.</p>
<p><strong>Security Guard</strong>: Chief Rittle left around 5:00 A.M. (checking the log) 5:14 to be exact.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to the guard at the gate. In slow motion, the car drives pas the guard. He sees a man driving the car and MRS. RITTLE with SASHA sitting in the back seat. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You saw Chief Rittle leave?</p>
<p><strong>Security Guard</strong>: Yeah, he was with his wife and kid. And he had his baseball cap and sunglasses on like he always does. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, you saw a baseball cap and sunglasses.</p>
<p>(A cell phone rings. GRISSOM turns away to answer it.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Did you actually see the chief's face </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to phone) Grissom.</p>
<p><strong>Security Guard</strong>: Well ... actually, I didn't.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM hangs up the phone and tells CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Brass found the Chief's Cadillac.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. PARKING GARAGE - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(BRASS, GRISSOM and CATHERINE walk under the police tape and into the parking garage.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Who found it?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: In-house security. Blue jacket. First time he saw the car was Saturday. Chalked the tires twice. Saw the bulletin on the Chief and called us.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Any bodies, Joe?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Joe</strong>: I already checked inside the car.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We were waiting on you to check the trunk.</p>
<p>(JOE pops the trunk. They find a dead body inside.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Whoa. </p>
<p>(BRASS' cell phone rings.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Who is this?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and GRISSOM lean in for a better look. GRISSOM takes off the baseball cap and looks inside. The name reads: &quot;Chief Rittle&quot;.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: &quot;Chief Rittle&quot;?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What is his connection to the chief?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I don't know. But if he has gunpowder residue on him, could be our shooter. </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (to phone) Okay.</p>
<p>(BRASS hangs up the cell phone.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Florida highway patrol called. Several motorists saw a girl matching Sasha's exact physical description walking along an access road.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: In Florida?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Miami-Dade county. Chief was shot Friday night. It's a two-day drive if you don't stop. It's national news with national attention. I'm not surprised we're getting call-ins.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, if it is our little girl, she's got evidence on her from two Vegas homicides. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: One of us should be down there to process.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE nods. She still doesn't get it. She looks up and suddenly realizes what GRISSOM'S saying.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Take Warrick. I don't think he's ever been to Florida.</p>
<p>(Off CATHERINE'S surprised look as her jaw drops.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />

<p>[EXT. MIAMI-DADE CITY - SKYLINE (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[EXT. MIAMI-DADE CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<hr />
[EXT. (MIAMI-DADE) ACCESS ROAD -- DAY]</p>
<p>(The PATROL CAPTAIN stands next to car #21291 and barks out instructions to the other officers assisting the search. Officers hand out information sheets. The access road is crawling with officers who will be used to look for the little girl.)</p>
<p><strong>Patrol Captain</strong>: She's seven years old! She's wearing a pink shirt! She was last seen by a motorist there! She can be two kilometers in either direction. Think of this area as a quadrant. Divide up. You, north. </p>
<p><strong>Officer 2</strong>: Got it!</p>
<p><strong>Patrol Captain</strong>: You, south.</p>
<p><strong>Officer 3</strong>: We got it!</p>
<p>(Standing off to the side amidst the scurry of Officers and FBI agents, HORATIO CAINE watches ... and thinks.)</p>
<p><strong>Officers</strong>: All right, this way.</p>
<p><strong>Officers</strong>: Let's go.</p>
<p>(A large mac truck passes by. He looks around the empty roadway.)</p>
<p><strong>Officers</strong>: Clear out!</p>
<p><strong>Officers</strong>: Watch your back!</p>
<p>(The road clears as officers go off to look for the little girl. HORATIO CAINE thinks about it for a moment, then starts to walk down the center of the road ... alone. He's startled by the sound of a pig squealing. He looks up and sees a pig crossing the road.)</p>
<p>(He stops some distance away and watches the pig cross the road.)</p>
<p>(HORATIO CAINE continues to walk. He looks on the ground and sees something on the dirt road. It's a pink plastic hair clip. He crouches down and picks it up. HORATIO pulls off his glasses to get a better look at it. It's a pink butterfly.)</p>
<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. (MIAMI-DADE) ACCESS ROAD -- TREE GROVE - DAY]</p>
<p>(HORATIO CAINE is walking along the roadway, following a path that he suspects they took. It's noticeable that he's walking alone, everyone else is searching elsewhere for the little girl.)</p>
<p>(HORATIO comes across a well-trodden path between the trees. He stops. Deep inside is a little blonde-haired girl in a pink shirt. She's sitting alone on the ground under a tree.)</p>
<p>(HORATIO crouches down and pulls off his sunglasses.)</p>
<p><strong>Horatio Caine</strong>: Sasha?!</p>
<p>(Immediately, the little girl turns her head. HORATIO stands and walks in closer.)</p>
<p><strong>Horatio Caine</strong>: (quietly) Sasha. My name is Horatio Caine. I'm the head of the crime unit.</p>
<p><strong>Sasha Rittle</strong>: Horatio?</p>
<p>(HORATIO settles himself down next to the little girl.)</p>
<p>HORTIO CAINE: Yeah. (he smiles) That's a funny name, isn't it? My mother named me after a famous writer named Horatio Alger. Ever hear of him?</p>
<p>(She sees his badge.)</p>
<p><strong>Sasha Rittle</strong>: Is your badge real?</p>
<p><strong>Horatio Caine</strong>: Yeah. Yeah, that's real.</p>
<p><strong>Sasha Rittle</strong>: My daddy's a policeman.</p>
<p>(HORATIO nods.)</p>
<p><strong>Horatio Caine</strong>: I know that. (he corrects himself) I &quot;knew&quot; that.</p>
<p><strong>Sasha Rittle</strong>: They're looking for me, you know.</p>
<p><strong>Horatio Caine</strong>: Me, too. Me, too. What do you say we sit here and get found together?</p>
<p>(SASHA RITTLE nods her head. She smiles slightly.)</p>
<p>(He looks out in the distance and sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Horatio Caine</strong>: (quietly) What a day.</p>
<p>(They both sit on the fallen tree stump on the ground, both looking out into the distance.)</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. MIAMI-DADE CITY (STOCK) -- NIGHT]</p>
<hr />
[EXT. (MIAMI-DADE) ACCESS ROAD -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(A helicopter whirrs overhead. An officer fills HORATIO CAINE in on the investigation.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Burgundy sedan. Caucasian female. Age 32. Traveling with a caucasian male indeterminate age.</p>
<p><strong>Horatio Caine</strong>: I got a female in distress. I want the APB to extend the whole state.</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Panhandle to the Keys. Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>Horatio Caine</strong>: Good.</p>
<p>(The officer leaves. HORATIO turns and sees the helicopter land. CATHERINE exits the helicopter. WARRICK follows. HORATIO meets them.)</p>
<p><strong>Horatio Caine</strong>: Horatio Caine.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Catherine Willows.</p>
<p>(They shake hands.)</p>
<p><strong>Horatio Caine</strong>: Caine.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Brown.</p>
<p>(They shake hands.)</p>
<p><strong>Horatio Caine</strong>: Child services has sent a doctor out.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: All right, let's just be clear. This is a Las Vegas case. This is our victim and we do the processing.</p>
<p><strong>Horatio Caine</strong>: Okay, I didn't say he processed her. I just said he was here.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I appreciate the respect.</p>
<p><strong>Horatio Caine</strong>: You sure about that?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Does she know about her father?</p>
<p><strong>Horatio Caine</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, I'd like to get started processing. Can you show me who you found?</p>
<p><strong>Horatio Caine</strong>: Okay, I found her right in here. </p>
<p>(HORATIO points to some area on the left of them.)</p>
<p><strong>Horatio Caine</strong>: And ... this is the young lady right over here.</p>
<p>(HORATIO CAINE turns around to indicate SASHA RITTLE sitting on the back of a truck taking a sip of something and returning it to the female officer with her. CATHERINE walks up to SASHA.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hi, Sasha. I'm Catherine Willows. And ... I need to ask you a few questions. Okay? </p>
<p>(SASHA nods. CATHERINE puts her kit on the truck back next to SASHA. She opens it.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: My kit. Did the man touch you?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE starts to take samples off of SASHA'S clothing.)</p>
<p><strong>Sasha Rittle</strong>: He hit my mommy.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Did he hit you? Did he hurt you in any way?</p>
<p><strong>Sasha Rittle</strong>: He acted like I wasn't there.</p>

<p><strong>Horatio Caine</strong>: You're not rich, Gordon.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. AIRSTRIP - NEAR THE CORWIN'S JET -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Handcuffed, GORDON DAIMLER is escorted off of the plane, &quot;Cor-wings&quot;. He's handed to the officer and exits camera frame. CATHERINE exits the plane followed by HORATIO. They walk out some distance away from the plane.)</p>
<p><strong>Horatio Caine</strong>: I'm going to, uh ... I'm going to book this guy. You want to go with?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Nah, you got it. I'll have my D.A. call your D.A.</p>
<p>(HORATIO chuckles.)</p>
<p><strong>Horatio Caine</strong>: Sounds good. Sounds good.</p>
<p>(They stop walking.)</p>
<p><strong>Horatio Caine</strong>: Uh ... thank you for your help on this.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Thanks for yours, actually.</p>
<p><strong>Horatio Caine</strong>: Right.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE smiles.)</p>
<p><strong>Horatio Caine</strong>: You take care of yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (smiles) I always do.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE extends her hand. HORATIO grasps it. They shake hands.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. MIAMI-DADE CITY SKYLINE (STOCK) - EARLY MORNING]</p>
<hr />
[EXT. (MIAMI-DADE) THE BEACH - EARLY MORNING]</p>
<p>(HORATIO CAINE looks out toward the ocean.)</p>
<p>(Camera cut to two officers standing watch over SASHA RITTLE as she plays in the sand. The two officers leave as HORATIO CAINE sits down next to the little girl.)</p>
<p><strong>Horatio Caine</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Sasha Rittle</strong>: My mommy and daddy are dead, aren't they? </p>
<p><strong>Horatio Caine</strong>: Well, your aunt is flying in to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>Sasha Rittle</strong>: That's a yes.</p>
<p><strong>Horatio Caine</strong>: I lost someone once.</p>
<p><strong>Sasha Rittle</strong>: Who? </p>
<p><strong>Horatio Caine</strong>: Well ... </p>
<p><strong>Sasha Rittle</strong>: Did you feel sick?</p>
<p><strong>Horatio Caine</strong>: Still do. Still do.</p>
<p>(SASHA turns back to the sand. HORATIO CAINE still has something to say to her.)</p>
<p><strong>Horatio Caine</strong>: Sasha .... people are going to say a lot of things about your mom and dad and some of them are going to be true, but what I want you to remember is that they fought like heroes for you. Will you remember that for me?</p>
<p>(SASHA nods her head.)</p>
<p><strong>Horatio Caine</strong>: Good. Good for you.</p>
<p>(The two lone figures continue to sit side-by-side on the beach. HORATIO turns back to look out into the ocean.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - GRISSOM'S OFFICE -- DAY]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE knocks on the door to get GRISSOM'S attention. She walks in to his office. GRISSOM turns around. He's wearing a dark suit and fiddling with his tie.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE stands in the doorway.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Nice tan.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM sits down in his chair.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Nice suit. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks into the office and stops in front of GRISSOM'S desk.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, well, I knew you were coming back today, so I dressed up.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (snorts) Yeah. Right.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Really. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE doesn't respond, although she does continue to look at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Nothing. It's just ... unusual to see you dressed like that.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I had to go to the Chief's funeral.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Missed me that much, huh?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE turns around and heads out the doorway, but not before she looks over her shoulder to cast GRISSOM a final look and smile.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM smiles as he watches her walk away. He shakes his head and turns back to his book ... still smiling.)</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>

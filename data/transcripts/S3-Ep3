[EXT. LAS VEGAS RESIDENTIAL HOME -- DAY]</p>
<p>(Camera focuses on a red, white &amp; black &quot;For Sale&quot; sign for:<br />
&quot;AUGIE HEITZ Realtor<br />
(702) 555-0111<br />
Another fine home brought to you by Augie Heitz&quot;)</p>
<p>(A man, PETER BERGLUND, and a woman, JANINE WOOD, walk up the property walkway.)</p>
<p><strong>Janine Wood</strong>: Wow, I love it already. I can't believe you're doing this. </p>
<p>(They stop at the front door. PETER BERGLUND goes to the lockbox and starts to open it.)</p>
<p><strong>Janine Wood</strong>: Is that the lockbox?</p>
<p><strong>Peter Berglund</strong>: Realtor gave me the combination. He's doing a walk-through in Seven Hills. </p>
<p>(JANINE WOOD smiles. PETER BERGLUND gets the lock box open and removes the lock. He looks back at JANINE WOOD and smiles.)</p>
<p><strong>Peter Berglund</strong>: Owners are out.</p>
<p>(He opens the door and they walk in.)</p>
<p>[INT. NEWMAN'S RESIDENCE - FOYER - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p><strong>Janine Wood</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p>(JANINE WOOD looks out at the plush living room in front of her. She's thoroughly impressed.)</p>
<p><strong>Peter Berglund</strong>: Wait till you see the master.</p>
<p>(PETER BERGLUND starts to climb the stairs. JANINE WOOD turns around and playfully runs up the stairs after him.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. NEWMAN'S RESIDENCE -- BEDROOM - DAY -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(PETER BERGLUND and JANINE WOOD enter the bedroom.)</p>
<p><strong>Janine Wood</strong>: Oh, my god. This is gorgeous. Wow. Amazing.</p>
<p>(She sits down on the bed. PETER BERGLUND follows her in the bedroom and also sits down on the bed. He turns to look at her. She catches the look.)</p>
<p><strong>Janine Wood</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Peter Berglund</strong>: Want to snoop around?</p>
<p>(JANINE WOOD smiles at the thought.)</p>
<p>(Cut to PETER BERGLUND opening a dresser drawer.)<br />
(Cut to JANINE WOOD trying on a scarf in the walk-in closet.)</p>
<p>(Cut to PETER BERGLUND picking something out of the dresser drawer and looking at it.)<br />
(Cut to JANINE WOOD looking around and taking the scarf off.)</p>
<p>(Cut back to PETER BERGLUND.)<br />
(Cut to JANINE WOOD trying on a brown hat.)</p>
<p>(Cut to PETER BERGLUND in the walk-in-closer.)<br />
(Cut to JANINE WOOD trying on a black hat.)</p>
<p>(Cut to PETER BERGLUND trying on a jacket.)<br />
(Cut to JANINE WOOD coming out of the closet. She's laughing.)</p>
<p><strong>Peter Berglund</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p>(PETER BERGLUND straightens the jacket he's wearing. He turns to JANINE WOOD.)</p>
<p><strong>Peter Berglund</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Janine Wood</strong>: I don't know, yeah. </p>
<p><strong>Peter Berglund</strong>: It's nice? </p>
<p><strong>Janine Wood</strong>: Looks good.</p>
<p>(PETER BERGLUND starts to kiss her. She knows what he has in mind and pushes him away.)</p>
<p><strong>Janine Wood</strong>: Cut it out. No, Seriously, I think I hear a car.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Berglund</strong>: Will you relax?</p>
<p><strong>Janine Wood</strong>: No, really.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Berglund</strong>: You're paranoid.</p>
<p>(PETER BERGLUND resumes kissing her. He keeps on kissing her and backs her up toward the bed. She laughs as he pushes her onto the bed.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. DOWNSTAIRS FOYER - DAY]</p>
<p>(JANINE WOOD walks out of the bedroom and into the hallway leading to the stairs. She's buttoning her blouse. While she walks down the stairs, PETER BERGLUND is following her. He's adjusting his pants.)</p>
<p><strong>Janine Wood</strong>: (laughing) Ooh, my god. I could get used to this place.</p>
<p>(JANINE WOOD half-walks, half runs down the stairs in a playful manner. She's carrying her shoes as she goes.)</p>
<p><strong>Peter Berglund</strong>: I bet you could.</p>
<p><strong>Janine Wood</strong>: I could. You're an animal.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Berglund</strong>: The backyard is the best part of the house.</p>
<p><strong>Janine Wood</strong>: Really? Is there a jacuzzi?</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. BACKYARD - DAY]</p>
<p>(The two go out into the back yard. PETER BERGLUND walks past her and stops in front of the pool. His back is to the woman as he takes in the scenery in front of him. JANINE WOOD stops under the canopy.)</p>
<p><strong>Janine Wood</strong>: Oh, my god. Looks like something out of a magazine.</p>
<p>(Something wet drips down from above and hits JANINE WOOD on the shoulder. She touches it. She looks up.)</p>
<p>(Directly above her is a large patch of blood on the awning. The camera refocuses on a single drop as it falls directly toward the camera ... )</p>
<p>FLASH TO WHITE:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. NEWMAN'S RESIDENCE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(From the second story top view, MONICA NEWMAN lies on the canopy awning. She's dressed in her underwear and a short robe.)</p>
<p>(The camera flashes several times. GRISSOM looks down on the dead body while CATHERINE continues to snap photographs of the scene below.)</p>
<p>(Cut to a black screen with a white-framed photograph of the dead body. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(BRASS joins them against the railing. He holds out a framed photograph of the young dark-haired woman and an older man. They both are smiling at the camera.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Cal and Monica Newman. Owners of the house. My guess, second marriage.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: 'Cause she's a babe and he's ...</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: He's, uhm ... got a good sense of humor.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM doesn't seem amused. BRASS returns GRISSOM'S look. CATHERINE, meanwhile, notices something on the floor of the balcony next to her. She picks it up. It's a shell casing. GRISSOM holds the flashlight on it while CATHERINE reads the etching on the bottom, &quot;380 AUTO WLN&quot;.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: .380 auto caliber.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM moves his light to the canopy below. Next to the dead body's right hand is a hand gun. He moves the light to the woman's head where the bullet wound is.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Gunshot, right temple. Women don't shoot themselves in the head, do they, Catherine?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, gunshots do a number of your face, so typically, women prefer pills.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So what are we calling this, murder, suicide, what?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Is the husband around?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at BRASS.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, you do the math: Dead female spouse plus missing husband ... equals murder.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO: END OF TEASER. ROLL TITLE CREDITS.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<hr />
[EXT. NEWMAN'S RESIDENCE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(NICK cuts the canopy around MONICA NEWMAN.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay, Warrick, hit it.</p>
<p>(WARRICK starts the crane support under the awning to remove the body and the canopy area that NICK cut.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: White female, multiple bruising ... bullet hole to the temple doesn't help. .380 auto on the side.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, somebody man-handled her pretty good before they killed her.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hmm ..</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. NEWMAN'S RESIDENCE - BACKYARD - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM notices the cigarette butts in the flower pot. He looks up at the second story open window directly above it and notices the torn screen. GRISSOM picks up one of the used cigarette butts. BRASS approaches GRISSOM and notices what GRISSOM is doing.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Reminds me of my daughter. She used throw butts out the window, too.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The Newmans have kids?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM starts to collect the cigarette butts in the flower bed. He puts them in a bindle.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: A kid. Son, 15, Max Newman. He's M.I.A. like the father. The secretary said he went out for lunch and never came back. I checked the garage -- three cars. None of the hoods are hot.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM tucks the bindle in his pocket and continues to look around.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We're missing something.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. NEWMAN'S RESIDENCE -- FOYER DOORWAY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(A man is talking to an officer.)</p>
<p><strong>Augie Heitz</strong>: Grissom. A Mr. Grissom. Where would I find Mr. Grissom? </p>
<p>(The officer points to GRISSOM who is standing behind the man.)</p>
<p><strong>Augie Heitz</strong>: Great, great. Thank you very much.</p>
<p>(AUGIE HEITZ turns around and walks toward GRISSOM and BRASS.)</p>
<p><strong>Augie Heitz</strong>: Mr. Grissom? Hi, I'm Augie Heitz. This is my listing. Someone died, I know. It's a terrible thing. But you got people knocking down awnings stomping through the flower beds. How am I supposed to sell this house?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You're not. It's a crime scene. </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Mr. Heitz, you're Mr. Newman's realtor. Have you seen your client lately?</p>
<p><strong>Augie Heitz</strong>: What, you kidding? I mean, this is actually the beauty of the service I provide. My clients never have to see me. They don't even have to be home when I show their house.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You always give out the combination to your lockboxes? It's illegal.</p>
<p><strong>Augie Heitz</strong>: It's a hot market. Um ... you know, I had a fish on the line. Potential bidding war. Look ... (he clears his throat) I only give out the combination to people that I really trust.</p>
<p>(BRASS nods his head as this makes perfect sense to him. He looks over at GRISSOM who doesn't say anything.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. NEWMAN'S RESIDENCE - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE is interviewing PETER BERGLUND and the WOMAN from the teaser. She's holding a bagged laptop in her arms.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: All right, look, I read rooms for a living. That closet was tossed. The carpet lit up. So I'm going to ask you again. What were you doing in there besides copulating?</p>
<p><strong>Peter Berglund</strong>: It was my idea.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Right. Well, we found this laptop on the vanity still on. You didn't play with it, too, did you?</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. NEWMAN'S RESIDENCE - BACKYARD - POOL AREA - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM shines his flashlight on the ground in front of him as he makes his way to the pool area. NICK is already at the edge of the pool. He's kneeling in front of something on the ground. It looks like something reddish mixed with something else.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, Warrick.</p>
<p>(WARRICK walks over to where NICK is. He also crouches down to look at what has NICK'S attention.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Check this out.</p>
<p>(NICK points to the watery-looking liquid substance on the pool side.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: It's a little thin for blood, isn't it?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(NICK watches as WARRICK sticks his finger into the red substance.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What do you ...?</p>
<p>(WARRICK then tastes it.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Tastes like sugar.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Erythrosine. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM stands a distance behind the two men. He has his flashlight pointed up at a hummingbird feeder hanging near the light. It has red liquid in it.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Red dye number three. </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hummingbirds do love the color red.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You've been watching way too much Discovery Channel. (to GRISSOM about NICK) This guy needs a girl. </p>
<p>(Both WARRICK and NICK stand up.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'm going to check out the cabana.</p>
<p>(WARRICK leaves. NICK continues to look at the pool side.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No visible footprints.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Doesn't mean someone wasn't out here. Grab the ALS.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(At this time, SARA arrives and walks to the pool making her way to GRISSOM. She's carrying her CSI kit. She passes NICK who is on his way to get the ALS.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey. NICK: Sara. (SARA stops in front of GRISSOM who is still kneeling by the poolside.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (to GRISSOM) I am so sorry.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at his watch.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I paged you two hours ago. SARA: Right. Uh, it's my day off. I was up in Pahrump at some vineyard. You told me to get a life, remember?</p>
<p>(SARA smiles at GRISSOM.. GRISSOM doesn't return the smile.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did I? </p>
<p>(SARA'S smiles slowly fades. GRISSOM doesn't say anything for a moment. He pulls out his orange-tinted goggles from his kit.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm sorry, but I needed you. Dispatch called in a 419 at Tuscadero High School. You're on your own.</p>
<p>(At any other time, SARA would jump at the chance. Under these circumstances however, this doesn't please SARA the least.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: On my own?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks back up at SARA. Their eyes meet.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Solo.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM puts on his goggles intending to go back to work and effectively dismissing her. SARA stands there a moment looking at GRISSOM. She is not pleased by what she just heard.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: See you around.</p>
<p>(SARA turns and leaves. On her way out, she passes NICK who has since returned with the ALS. He watches her with envy at getting a prime assignment.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (to SARA) Solo? </p>
<p>(SARA shrugs and doesn't say anything. Her back is the only thing we see as she walks out. NICK, in the meantime, can't believe that SARA just walked in and out with the solo assignment.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (to GRISSOM) So does this mean when I come in on my day off I get to work solo?</p>
<p>(NICK puts his goggles on. GRISSOM points to the equipment at NICK'S feet.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Process.</p>
<p>(NICK turns on the ALS and starts to examine the poolside. He sees the footprints immediately.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Whoa. I got what looks like two sets of prints. Ballpark in a size ten from the house. And what looks like a ... size 12, possibly from the pool.</p>
<p>(NICK puts the portable machine down when he reaches GRISSOM. He kneels down low.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: There were definitely two guys here, Griss.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Now we just need to figure out if one of them was Mr. Newman.</p>
<p>(WARRICK enters.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey, fellas. Looks like the husband pulled a Clark Kent and left all his clothes behind. Couldn't have gone far. I got his wallet, credit card and keys.</p>
<p>(WARRICK shows them the set of car keys he's holding in his hand. The camera holds close on GRISSOM. Both he and NICK stand up.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You hear that? What is that?</p>
<p>(As NICK and WARRICK speak, we're made aware of the sounds of water shloshing and of a generator that sounds stuck. GRISSOM looks from WARRICK to NICK as he tries to follow their conversation.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (o.s.) Oh, yeah, it's the pool. It's been doing it all night. </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Sounds like it's clogged.</p>
<p>(At the mention of the pool, GRISSOM'S eyes look toward it.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did someone check this pool?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: First officer said it was clear.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at NICK. He points back to the pool.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Does that pool look clear to you?</p>
<p>(NICK looks at the pool. The water looks a bit cloudy to the casual observer.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Uh ... no.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at NICK. He then turns to look at WARRICK. He points to the pool.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: One of you guys is going in.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM leaves the two men to figure out who of the two it will be.)</p>
<p>(NICK looks over at WARRICK and points. WARRICK stands across the pool staring at NICK. He's still holding the camera. WARRICK shakes his head and points back at NICK.)</p>
<p>(NICK takes a deep breath and holds out his fist. They're going to decide who goes in by a brief round of rock, paper, and scissors. WARRICK understands this perfectly. He, too, also holds out his fist as they quickly decide who is going to jump into the pool.)</p>
<p>(WARRICK shows rock; NICK shows scissors. WARRICK nods and points back at NICK.)</p>
<p>(NICK nods.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (to GRISSOM) I'll go in the pool.</p>
<p>(Standing at the edge of the pool, NICK takes his shirt off, tosses it to the side and slowly lowers himself into the pool.)</p>
<p>(NICK takes a deep breath and goes under the water. He makes his way across the pool. The water is cloudy and he's not able to se across to the other side. He barely can see directly in front of him. He dives in deeper toward the bottom. He pushes his way across the pools length when he swims smack into CAL NEWMAN, dead in the water.)</p>
<p>(NICK backs away and heads up for the surface.)</p>
<p>(He breaks the surface and sees GRISSOM and WARRICK standing at the pool's edge.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Oh, man! Male D.B.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. TUSCADERO HIGH SCHOOL - FOOTBALL FIELD - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(SARA and DET. LOCKWOOD make their way down from the seats and onto the field.)</p>
<p><strong>Lockwood</strong>: You have dinner yet? SARA: Yeah. Why? LOCKWOOD: You might be seeing it again. (Across the field near the end zone, the body of a woman is on the ground. There are police cars at the end of the field. DAVID PHILLIPS stands over the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Lockwood</strong>: Mandy Kirk. Seventeen.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Seventeen.</p>
<p><strong>Lockwood</strong>: Senior. Janitor found her.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hi, David.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Hey.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: How about your house? It's up for sale.</p>
<p><strong>Jeri Newman</strong>: What's this?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, you see, we didn't have enough evidence at this point to get a warrant, but you put your house on the internet. I didn't need a warrant. Gave me complete access via this virtual tour. And all with your permission.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE starts to navigate through JERI NEWMAN'S house on the internet. She virtually goes through the living room and focuses on the fireplace. She enhances a framed photograph on the mantle. She enlarges it. She sharpens it.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: That's you ... that's Peter Berglund ... and that's the Pacific.</p>
<p><strong>Jeri Newman</strong>: So what? I know Peter.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah. You hired him to kill your ex-husband and his new wife.</p>
<p><strong>Jeri Newman</strong>: The picture doesn't prove anything.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No, but it did give me access to Peter's financial information. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE pulls out a piece of paper and puts it on the table in front of JERI NEWMAN. It's the signature page of a loan application dated 09/19/02.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Loan application. Two signatures -- Peter Berglund and yours. You cosigned for Peter because he couldn't qualify on his own. Payment for the hit. He gets your house you get your ex-husband's money.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The thing about murder for hire ... there's always a paper trail.</p>
<p>(JERI NEWMAN looks up at CATHERINE. Camera holds.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - GRISSOM'S OFFICE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(SARA appears in the doorway. She doesn't enter the office. Inside, GRISSOM sits at his desk and is going through his paperwork. He isn't aware that she's there. For a moment, she doesn't say anything. She simply stands there and watches him. SARA calls out lightly to him.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Good night.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks up and sees SARA standing there. She smiles a bit.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Good night, Sara.</p>
<p>(SARA smiles. She starts to leave then stops when GRISSOM calls back out to here.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hey. Nice work on the high school case.</p>
<p>(SARA walks back to the doorway. He smiles and nods his head. Twice. Sara smiles back. If that was his apology for his earlier attitude, she'd accept it. For a moment she doesn't say anything and continues to stand in the doorway. GRISSOM returns to his paperwork. SARA considers it for a moment, then says what's been on her mind since she was assigned to this case.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'm ... uh ... sorry I missed your page.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks up at her, a little surprised to see her still standing there.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It's just, um ... you tell me to get a life and then I get one, and then you expect me to be there at a moment's notice. It's ... um ... confusing.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM doesn't know what to say. He takes his eyes off of SARA, removes his glasses and considers his response. He's caught off guard by her honesty and takes a moment to respond. A moment too long. When he finally figures out what he's going to say, he looks up at SARA ... )</p>
<p>( ... and finds that she's gone.)</p>
<p>(The camera holds on GRISSOM sitting behind his desk, holding his glasses and staring at the empty doorway.)</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>

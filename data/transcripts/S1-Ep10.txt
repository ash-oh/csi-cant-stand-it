[EXT. MOUNTAINS -- DAY]</p>
<p>(We hear the crunching of footsteps on the brush.)</p>
<p><strong>Hiker Man</strong>: (o.s.) Isn't it great to get back to nature? </p>
<p>(We hear more footsteps.)</p>
<p><strong>Hiker Man</strong>: (o.s.) You want to set camp here?</p>
<p>(In the brush, we see two campers, ANGIE and a man. ANGIE has her legs crossed and shuffles from one foot to the other.)</p>
<p><strong>Angie</strong>: We can camp on the moon. Just give me the shovel.</p>
<p>(HIKER MAN takes off his back pack and grabs the shovel. He hands it to her.)</p>
<p><strong>Hiker Man</strong>: Chill, chill. You got paper?</p>
<p>(She grabs it and hurries off. The MAN laughs silently at her.)</p>
<p><strong>Angie</strong>: I have what I need.</p>
<p>(ANGIE walks some distance away from her camping partner and tries to get the shovel open. We hear insects buzzing. She looks in front of her and gasps.)</p>
<p><strong>Angie</strong>: Oh, my god!</p>
<p><strong>Hiker Man</strong>: (concerned) Angie?</p>
<p>(ANGIE is frozen as she stares at whatever it is she's looking at. When ANGIE doesn't answer him, the MAN turns to go look for her.)</p>
<p><strong>Hiker Man</strong>: Angie!</p>
<p>(He runs toward her and finds her frozen at whatever she's looking at.)</p>
<p><strong>Angie</strong>: They're ... they're everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Hiker Man</strong>: What the ... ? </p>
<p>(In front of them, under the bush, is the body of a person.)</p>
<p><strong>Hiker Man</strong>: That's a person.</p>
<p>(They both start coughing and gagging at the thought.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>

[EXT. MOUNTAINS - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Large lights are set up on the mountain side. SARA and GRISSOM make their way down toward the dead body.)</p>
<p><strong>Detective</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p>(They walk up toward BRASS.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hikers found her. Looks like a gunshot to the head.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did you find a weapon?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and SARA approach the body. GRISSOM puts his kit down. and puts on the gloves. He brushes a few away. SARA looks wide-eyed at the flying bees.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I hate bees.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Just paper wasps. They're having too much fun to worry about us.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM picks up his kit and walks closer toward the body. SARA stays back where she is.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I never get used to this part, you know when the bugs get going.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM opens his kit.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Just doing what god intended ... ... recycling us back to the earth.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks down at the body. SARA takes out a pair of gloves.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hey, Officer </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Can I borrow some of your hot coffee, please?</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p>(The OFFICER hands GRISSOM the cup. SARA bats her hand at the bees. GRISSOM takes a couple of bugs off of the body and puts them in a container. He pours some coffee into the container. SARA has moves in nearer to the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to SARA) Preservation.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM caps the container and puts it aside. Off the body, he takes beetle samples.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: John ... Paul ... George ... Ringo.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Beetles. No alkali fluids in the dirt so she wasn't killed here. Whoever dumped her must have been in a hurry. Didn't take the time to bury her. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You got any of that beef jerky you're always gnawing on?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You can eat?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I want to keep these little fellas alive. They're our first witnesses to the crime.</p>

[INT. CSI - BREAK ROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Everyone's in the break room waiting for GRISSOM and the assignments.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Cath, you want some coffee?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Please. Cream with some of that fake stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: There's nothing good to eat around here.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE tosses NICK an apple over her shoulder. It lands in his hand. He looks down at it and smiles.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks into the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hi. Sorry I'm late.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, how's the body with the bugs?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM starts, then stares at CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How do you know about that already?</p>
<p>(He turns around and look over at SARA, who is on the other side of the room reading a book. She looks up and shrugs.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey, don't look at me.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: We, uh, played a hunch; checked with homicide. You were late.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What do you have for us?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at the assignment sheet.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: A Paul Sorenson ...</p>
<p>(He hands the assignment sheet to CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (reading) Missing since last night. Last seen at home of Richard Zeigler in - ooh -- Summerlin.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Summerlin ... rich folks.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Warrick, you can work this with Catherine. (CATHERINE hands the sheet to WARRICK.) Don't you have a court date coming up?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, the DA asked me to testify on chain of custody.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I could do that in my sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Listen, juries need to have confidence in the evidentiary, process, so work with Catherine then break off when you have to appear.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(WARRICK and CATHERINE head out the front door.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: See you.</p>
<p>(They leave. NICK looks at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Need help with your homicide?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No. Sara's going to work with me.</p>
<p>(NICK looks over at SARA, who smiles back at getting the dead body case with GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You get a missing person. (reading) Sheryl Applegate. Her husband notified the police that she took the car and headed to L.A., but she never showed up. A few hours ago, P.D. found her car at the bus station. They requested a CSI.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: She took the bus instead. Case solved.</p>
<p>(NICK smiles smugly at SARA. SARA laughs.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hopefully, you're right. But, until she's located treat her car like a crime scene.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM holds out the assignment sheet to NICK. NICK sighs and takes the sheet from GRISSOM. He heads for the door. On his way out, he tosses the apple to SARA, who catches it.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at SARA and points at the door. She stands up and they leave the room.)</p>

[EXT. ZEIGLER RESIDENCE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and WARRICK walk up to the front door. CATHERINE knocks.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Is everything okay? You've been quiet all night.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah. I got a call earlier today from Child Services asking about you and Lindsey.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE shakes her head in surprised disbelief.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I don't believe this.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: They told me they'd notified you -- some investigation -- that Eddie had made a charge or something.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yes. He's pissed off because I won't let him back into my life so he sics Child Services on me.</p>
<p>(WARRICK understands now.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (still upset) I never expected they were going to talk to my friends. Well, what did they ask? What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, I ...</p>
<p>(The front door opens.)</p>
<p><strong>Richard Zeigler</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hi. Sir, we're with the Las Vegas Crime Lab. We're here about a Paul Sorenson.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Zeigler</strong>: I'm Richard Zeigler. Cops told me you were coming. Here, please, come in.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>(He holds the door open for them. They walk inside.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>

[INT. ZIEGLER RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(RICHARD ZEIGLER leads them into the living room. He stops and points to the wall in front of them.)</p>
<p><strong>Richard Zeigler</strong>: Well, this is, uh where the Sorenson was displayed.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Sorenson is a painting.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Zeigler</strong>: Paul Sorenson was an artist. Early 1900s.</p>
<p>(RICHARD ZEIGLER steps past them and up to the empty wall. WARRICK puts his kit down.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (shrugs) How dumb are we?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What's he know about the forensic analysis of a friction ridge?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Right on.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Zeigler</strong>: (doesn't hear &amp; turns around) I think I may have surprised the guy while he was stealing it.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: RICHARD ZEIGLER walks down the darkened stairs.)</p>
<p><strong>Richard Zeigler</strong>: (V.O.) I came downstairs to read and I heard a noise.</p>
<p>(The plaster breaks and the wall hanger falls to the floor with some plaster.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: The thief runs out of the living room with the painting. RICHARD ZEIGLER turns his head and notices the open door.)</p>
<p><strong>Richard Zeigler</strong>: (V.O.) By the time I got to the room, he was gone but the door was open.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and WARRICK reach into their field kits.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Why don't we dust for prints?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Mr. Ziegler, one more thing. What about the security alarm?</p>
<p><strong>Richard Zeigler</strong>: Somebody disengaged it.</p>
<p>(WARRICK nods his head. RICHARD ZEIGLER walks away.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You thinking what I'm thinking?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, yeah. Inside job. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE reaches up and starts dusting the wall for prints.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So ... was it a disaster with Child Services?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Disaster? What do you mean?</p>
<p>(WARRICK reaches up next to CATHERINE and starts dusting the wall for prints.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, my job does take me away from my daughter. Nobody knows that better than you.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, but you think I'd say that?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, not intentionally. (sighs) They just, you know, know how to ask questions.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Zeigler</strong>: Are you finding anything?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We're working on it, sir.</p>

[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(DR ROBBINS goes over the body with GRISSOM and SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Your young woman from the mountains.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Do we know who she is yet?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: I gave her prints to homicide for ID. There's the blanket she was wrapped in. Whoever she is, last day on earth was not pleasant. .38 caliber gun, flush to the scalp.</p>
<p>(White flash to Quick CGI: Gunshot is heard and the camera follows the bullet's path through the gun barrel and through the scalp. Camera backs up a little to show the entry wound. End of CGI. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Shot clean through, right to left. Bullet out the other side.</p>
<p>(SARA leans in close and looks at the wound.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Stellate pattern and beveled wound confirms the proximity of barrel to scalp. No question this was an intimate killing.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: &quot;Full of sound and fury signifying&quot; ... what, Doc?</p>
<p>[Note: Quote from Macbeth, Act V, Scene V, William Shakespeare]</p>
<p>(DR. ROBBINS turns and walks off to the side.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: I took these.</p>
<p>(They look at the x-rays up on the viewbox.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Let's see what we have. Fracture to the nasal bone, orbital bone, mandibular ... all facial fractures.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: (realizing) Typical for battered women.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: These aren't fresh, are they?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: The old fracture lines indicate this woman was in a long-term abusive relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Any idea how long she's been dead?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: The elements really got to her. Grissom and his insects are going to have to figure that one out. </p>
<p>(DR. ROBBINS turns around and sees GRISSOM picking up a bug from the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Have we lost you, Grissom?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at the bug.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (muttering) &quot;The worms go in the worms go out / the worms play pinochle on your snout.&quot;</p>
<p>[Note: Quote from &quot;The Hearse Song&quot;, Nursery Rhyme.]</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Shakespeare again?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: An old nursery rhyme.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: A very special insect, Dr. Seuss?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: A muscid fly -- typical only in urban areas.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: But you found her in the mountains.</p>
<p>(He smiles in agreement.)</p>

[INT. ZEIGLER RESIDENCE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE questions RICHARD ZEIGLER.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: How many people have access to your home -- keys and security code?</p>
<p><strong>Richard Zeigler</strong>: Just my wife and my two sons and, uh ... my daughter.</p>
<p>(Meanwhile, WARRICK finds something.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Can you get them all here? They might be able to help us with evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey, Catherine. Check this out. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE turns around and looks at the wall.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You see that?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Helix, antihelix, helix rim, tragus, antitragus.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I think the thief must have pressed his head against the wall to check if the painting was wired.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (laughs) Come on. An earprint?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey, a jury convicted a first-degree murderer based on a print just like this two years ago in Washington.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, I know, I know. I'd like to see that one on appeal. Well, photograph and lift. We'll have someone to compare it to soon enough.</p>

[INT. CSI - GRISSOM'S OFFICE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Camera opens on a certificate hanging on the wall from the &quot;UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO&quot;, &quot;SOCIETY OF VECTOR ECOLOGY&quot; to &quot;Gil Grissom&quot;, then pans over to the various bugs pinned to a white board. GRISSOM adds another pinned bug to the board.)</p>
<p>(SARA sits behind GRISSOM holding the container with the 'preserved' beetle in it, the one with the caffeine.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Okay, bear with me. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks over to the counter to pick up another container marked<br />
&quot;evidence&quot; with an insect inside.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I mean, you're one of ten guys in the country that understands this stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I think there's at least fifteen, but go on. What don't you get?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Insects arrive at a corpse in a specific order, right?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Like summer follows the spring.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: And you can pinpoint time of death based on the type and age of insects present on the body?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I watch the insects mature from eggs to larvae to adults and then count backwards.</p>
<p>(Off SARA, out in the hallway, BRASS lingers in the doorway.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Linear regression.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM holds up a bug and looks at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: How old are those creepy crawlers?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: They're not done maturing yet.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: But when they are, I'll be able to tell you how old they were when I found the body.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Which will tell us when the woman died.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I ID'd her body through AFIS, and located her husband.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Let me guess. Downtown? The Fremont District?</p>
<p>(BRASS' face falls at GRISSOM'S accuracy.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know, I'm not even going to ask.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Synthesiomyia nudiseta is the Latin name.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It's a muscid fly. Only breeds in urban areas but Grissom found one on our girl which means she was probably killed downtown and then carried into the mountains.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, the neighbors heard a gunshot at their apartment five days ago. The &quot;grieving&quot; husband ... </p>
<p>(BRASS looks down at his notes.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: ... his name is Scott Shelton.</p>

[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM, SARA and BRASS interview SCOTT SHELTON.)</p>
<p><strong>Scott Sheldon</strong>: Kaye screamed at me a lot, that's for sure but I didn't kill her. In fact, I was out of town last week at a convention.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, in New Orleans soaking up the gumbo. You told us. When was the last time you saw your wife?</p>
<p><strong>Scott Sheldon</strong>: Five days ago. When I came back from my trip she was gone.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Every face and neck fracture your wife has sustained over the last six years is highlighted.</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Three complaints against Scott for spousal abuse in the last two years.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Sheldon</strong>: Kaye was excitable. Like I said I've wrestled her off me, but I never, ever laid a hand on her.</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (calls out) So, you planning a little late-night luau? Roast pig?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's an experiment. Maybe Kaye was dead five days.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I thought your bugs never made mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: They don't. People do. The victim was wrapped in a blanket. Normally a blanket or clothing doesn't impact insect maturation. The insects usually fight their way in anyway. But I examined the folds in Kaye's blanket. She was wrapped tight -- maybe tighter than I realized -- which would have decreased the corpse's exposure to insects.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So it took longer for the insects to get in there?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And deposit their eggs. Maybe two whole days. I've wrapped porky here pretty tight.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, let me ask you this. You killed a pig just for this?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This poor ham was already on its way to someone's Christmas dinner table.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I mean, wouldn't a rabbit be easier?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Got to be a pig. Interestingly, they're the most like humans.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, I've been saying that since I was a rookie. You're on your own pal.</p>
<p>(BRASS turns and leaves.)</p>

<p>(Dissolve to: GRISSOM snaps a few photos of the bugs on the pig.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: GRISSOM secures his jacket tighter around himself as he writes in his log book. He looks up.)</p>
<p>(SARA walks up to him, an appreciative smile on her face. She puts her kit down next to his open one. Without a word, she puts her bag down and takes the seat next to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes off his glasses and SARA hands him the thermos. He uncaps the thermos and she takes out a fresh blanket, which she opens and wraps around his shoulders.)</p>
<p>(He looks at her and smiles.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (quietly) Thanks.</p>
<p>(Short time cut to: The camera pans across the area outside the fence and rests on the sign: NO TRESPASSING / VIOLATORS WILL BE - PROSECUTED. Inside the fenced area, GRISSOM and SARA sit and keep watch over their pig.)</p>

<p>(DET. SECULA lingers in the doorway and calls inside.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. Secula</strong>: How's the case going?</p>
<p>(NICK turns around and sees her.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey. Dead end. How about you?</p>
<p><strong>Det. Secula</strong>: Just got a hit on one of our missing lady's credit cards. A motel.</p>
<p>(She takes a step back out into the hallway. She and NICK head out.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Her abductor sold her card or is using it himself. What motel?</p>
<p><strong>Det. Secula</strong>: Four Aces.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: That's right around the corner from where we found her car.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Secula</strong>: I've got some uniforms meeting us there.</p>

<p><strong>Officer</strong>: All right, don't move! OFFICER: Put your hands where I can see them!</p>
<p>(Outside the sounds of helicopter blades are heard overhead. NICK rounds the corner and freezes at what he sees. He glances over at DET. SECULA who doesn't say anything.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Are you Sheryl Applegate?</p>
<p>(On the bed is a woman handcuffed to the side. She nods.)</p>
<p>(The OFFICERS push a man in a towel back into the motel room.)</p>
<p><strong>Michael</strong>: Oh, whoa, man! Ow! Oh, what's going on here?</p>
<p><strong>Sheryl Applegate</strong>: Michael, shut up!</p>
<p><strong>Det. Secula</strong>: (amused) Las Vegas police. Your husband reported you missing.</p>
<p><strong>Sheryl Applegate</strong>: Can she put that gun away?</p>
<p>(DET. SECULA puts her gun away.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You, uh ... you haven't been abducted have you, Mrs. Applegate?</p>
<p><strong>Sheryl Applegate</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: We found evidence of blood in your car.</p>
<p><strong>Sheryl Applegate</strong>: I saw an injured dog last week and drove it to the vet.</p>
<p>(DET. SECULA clears her throat.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. Secula</strong>: Uh, Nick, let's get out of here.</p>
<p>(NICK nods and clears his throat. He turns to leave the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Sheryl Applegate</strong>: Wait! What are you going to tell my husband?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: That you're okay. (laughs) You're going to have to fill in the blanks.</p>

<p>(SHERIFF BRIAN MOBLEY looks through the photographs of the pig.)</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: So the pig's insects matured at a rate consistent with a five-day-old corpse?</p>
<p>(In the office, GRISSOM, SARA, and BRASS talk with SHERIFF BRIAN MOBLEY.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (nods) Once I took the blanket into account.</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: Your initial computations were wrong. You went back, adjusted conditions, and proved actual time of death.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Five days, not three.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Which places the victim with her husband who's already guilty as sin.</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: Captain Brass do you understand Grissom's insect evidence?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (nods) To a degree. You know ... in a general way.</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: Do you think a jury will understand your &quot;adjustments&quot;? Or do you think they'll realize your &quot;conditions&quot; can make the evidence say anything you want it to say?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I can make a case to any jury against Scott Shelton for the murder of his wife.</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: Your arresting officer can barely understand it. I read the file. Other than bugs is there anything else? </p>
<p>(GRISSOM shakes his head.)</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: Get something a jury can understand or move on.</p>
<p>(The SHERIFF leaves the office. Camera holds on SARA.)</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hello, Mr. Zeigler.</p>
<p>(He sees the painting.)</p>
<p><strong>Richard Zeigler</strong>: Oh, good. You brought my Sorenson.</p>
<p>(Inside the house, JASON watches.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Zeigler</strong>: Good. I'm glad it's back.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Nice campus you got there, Jason.</p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong>: (off guard) What?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We were by your dorm earlier with the police here.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We'd like to ask a favor of you Mr. Zeigler. A private viewing of the painting.</p>
<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. ZEIGLER RESIDENCE - DAY -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE tests the painting. RICHARD ZEIGLER recognizes the test immediately and reacts to the results.)</p>
<p><strong>Richard Zeigler</strong>: My god, my-my ... my Sorenson's a forgery?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: That's not all, sir.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Zeigler</strong>: Wait. I have $10 million worth of forgeries?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No, sir. The police recovered your originals from Jason's dorm room today.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Zeigler</strong>: What? </p>
<p>(RICHARD turns and looks at JASON, who still hasn't said anything.)</p>
<p><strong>Richard Zeigler</strong>: I don't even know you.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What, did you have an art major do your fakes for you, Jason?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Robbery checked with your school. They actually teach classes in how to copy the Masters.</p>
<p>(JASON nods.)</p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong>: My friends helped me out. They didn't know what I was doing with the copies.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Zeigler</strong>: And what exactly were you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Your son stole all your originals replacing them with forgeries.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: But, the other night, his little scam was interrupted.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The painting is ripped off of the wall. The hanger and some plaster falls to the floor.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (V.O.) He didn't have time to make the switch.</p>
<p>(Close up of JASON looking behind him at the sound of his father walking down the stairs. He puts the painting down on the floor next to the &quot;fake&quot;. He slides it aside and picks up the fake. Cut to: JASON runs out of the room with the fake.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: If the hook hadn't dislodged from your Sorenson you would have spent the rest of your life admiring fakes.</p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong>: (laughs) And you never even knew the difference, did you, dad? You're right. You don't know me. Where are your pictures of me? You're too busy staring at your masterpieces, and they're not even real! I'm right here, dad. You don't even see me!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (quietly) The police are going to want to know if you're pressing charges this time.</p>

[INT. CSI - HALLWAY OUTSIDE FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- DAY]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM is leaning against the wall and reading a file. SARA walks up to him.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I heard you were going into an autopsy. (upset) How can you just move on to another case? They're laughing at us. You know that, right? They think we're a couple of 'science nerds'. They threw out our findings.</p>
<p>(DAVID walks up to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: That body should be up in a few minutes, Mr. Grissom.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Thank you, David.</p>
<p>(DAVID leaves.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You know, there was a murder recently in a village on the other side of the world. Every man in the village denied having any part of it. The victim's throat had been slashed with a shovel. So this one guy -- I guess you could call him a &quot;science nerd&quot; -- asked all the men in the village to bring their shovels to the center of town and hold them spade-side up. And he waited. Eventually, flies started showing up on one specific shovel looking for microscopic bits of blood and flesh.</p>
<p>(SARA nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: &quot;First witness to a crime.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The investigator got his murderer, and...</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: ...and forensic science was born. Sung T'su, 1235 A.D. You call 800 years ago recent?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: To an astronomer, it is. (pause) But then people forgot about forensic science, didn't they? And they had to be reminded again by Francesco Redi in the 1600s.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: And again by Bergeret D'Arbois in the 1800s.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Every civilization learns what it needs to know and the next one forgets it. The sheriff ... well... it's not personal.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We're part of the cycle.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, they laughed at fingerprints 70 years ago, and now it's law.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Except somebody had to push for prints. And you're standing there saying<br />
&quot;all things in their own time.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You're confused, right?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (shakes her head, then nods) Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's the best place for a scientist to be. </p>
<p>(Behind SARA, GRISSOM sees someone approaching.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: My body's here.</p>
<p>(The Coroner's Assistant pushes the gurney between GRISSOM and SARA toward the door. GRISSOM reaches over and lifts up the sheet. SARA looks down.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (smiles) Kaye Shelton ...</p>
<p>(She looks at GRISSOM. He smiles at her and motions to the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Shall we?</p>
<p>(They push the door open and walk inside, the body on the gurney right behind them.)</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Routine cleaning. We had to do it sometime.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Doc, what's this blue mark here?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks a the blue mark around the bullet wound.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Why didn't we see this at the autopsy?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: It was under a gallon of blood. But the blue's embedded; it won't wash away.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Didn't you say the suspect's ammunition was in trace?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah.</p>

<p>(GRISSOM walks into the lab. SARA stands up and points to the scope.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And? So?</p>

<p>(GRISSOM sits down and looks into the scope.)</p>
<p>[SCOPE VIEW of hair with blue stuff on it.]</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The blue dust from around her entrance wound -- that's from the bullet's impact. It's made of teflon. Now look at the next specimen.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM stands up and moves to the next scope.)</p>
<p>[SCOPE VIEW of bullet]</p>

<p><strong>Kaye Shelton</strong>: (screaming) No! Scott, no!</p>

<p>(He puts the gun up against her temple and fires.)</p>
<p>(Camera follows the bullet through the gun barrel and up to the temple where it leaves a smoking hole.)</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You did very good. (SARA beams.) But this is just more circumstantial evidence. We're a long way from a conviction.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: But we can bury him under evidence. You're the one who's always saying it's better to have one piece of forensic evidence than ten eyewitnesses.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (stares at her) What, do you tape everything I say? (SARA shrugs.)<br />
You still have to educate the jury.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (counters) On bullets. It's got to be easier than bugs. (GRISSOM smiles) (beat) Less Latin.</p>

<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. SIDEWALK -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(A couple of roller bladers play on the sidewalk.)</p>
<p>(Camera close up of the roller blades of the first person as he jumps on the metal rail and rides it from one end to the other. He jumps off, excited.)</p>
<p><strong>Blader 1</strong>: All the way across! Did you see that! Dude! Dude! Come on, bust it, bro.</p>
<p><strong>Blader 2</strong>: Relax man! I'm going! </p>
<p><strong>Blader 1</strong>: You've got it. Don't puss out on me!</p>
<p>(The second blader takes a running leap and tries the same trick. He jumps off excited when he's done.)</p>
<p><strong>Blader 1</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>Blader 2</strong>: Oh! (raises his hands in triumph) Sick yeah!</p>
<p><strong>Blader 1</strong>: Yeah, I thought for sure you were going to eat it, though.</p>
<p><strong>Blader 2</strong>: No, way, man. I had that thing hooked up.</p>
<p><strong>Blader 1</strong>: Oh you got lucky, man.</p>
<p>(The two roller bladers stop by the side of the building. From above, a body falls to the ground with a loud thud. SKATER 1 edges closer for a look.)</p>
<p><strong>Blader 1</strong>: (looking down at the body) Ugh! Oh, my god!</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. BUILDING -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Camera opens on the dead body. The Emergency Personnel are already there. NICK and WARRICK make their way toward BRASS.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: We beat Grissom here? That's a first.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah? Maybe for you.</p>
<p>(BRASS leads them under the crime scene tape and toward the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hey, how you doing? The jumper's John Doe. No wallet no keys, no ID.</p>
<p>(NICK leans in to look at the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, that's the least of this guy's problem.</p>
<p>(BRASS looks up at the building top.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The building's gotta be what? Six stories high? </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Six stories, sixty stories. It's not how you fall, it's how you land.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You know, if you landed head first, there should be more blood.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, and more brain matter.</p>
<p>(WARRICK'S phone beeps.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (over phone) He didn't jump.</p>
<p>(It beeps again.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Up here.</p>
<p>(They look up to see GRISSOM looking down at them from the top of the building.)</p>
<p>[TOP OF BUILDING]</p>
<p>(Where GRISSOM stands, there's a whole lot of blood mess on the rooftop.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's never the fall that kills you.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER. ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<hr />
[EXT. BUILDING - ROOF -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and NICK check out the building rooftop.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Rain or not, I'm not finding any shoe prints.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: High velocity spatter usually implies a gunshot.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No casings or bullets, either.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (indicating the blood mess) Severe head trauma. It happened before the fall.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Sure looks like it. Hand to hand combat?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (shakes his head) Kill and dump.</p>
<p>(Quick visualization to: A person pushes the body off the roof of the building. The body falls down on the ground in front of WARRICK ... End of visualization. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>[DOWN ON THE GROUND]</p>
<p>(WARRICK snaps pictures of the body in front of him. He puts the camera aside and looks at the body. He finds something on the pants hem. Camera zooms in for a close up of white specks on the cloth. WARRICK takes a tape lift of it.)</p>
<p>(DAVID PHILLIPS walks up to WARRICK.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey. I think the prints are out. Bones burst right through the skin.</p>
<p>(DAVID checks out the victim's hand.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Compound fracture of the long bones including the phalanges. Extensive laceration. </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What about dental?</p>
<p>(DAVID checks out the victim's teeth.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Yeah. There might be enough to work with.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You think? Hey, wait a minute. Look. You might have another option. Check out that artwork.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Tattoo.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You think you can stretch that out?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Yeah, no problem.</p>
<p>(WARRICK takes a picture of the tattoo.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. PARKING LOT -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(O'RILEY and CATHERINE walk to the crime scene.)</p>
<p><strong>O'Riley</strong>: Wallet was with the vic. Money, cards, I.D.'S. Name's Roger Edmonds. Car's his, too.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE puts her kit down and they both kneel to look at the body.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Single gunshot wound to the chest, through and through. Entry wound is massive. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE takes a picture of the wound.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Unburned gunpowder. He was shot at close range.</p>
<p>(Camera close up of the wound to show the gunpowder. CATHERINE stands up to look at the car.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Car door ... is closed ... but not latched. Vic was in a hurry?</p>
<p><strong>O'Riley</strong>: To get in or get out?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Good question. I don't see any bullet holes.</p>
<p>(They walk around the car where CATHERINE finds something on the front license plate.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What's this? Ah, blood and hair. Maybe the vic got a piece of the perp.</p>
<p><strong>O'Riley</strong>: Waitress phoned it in.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. RESTAURANT -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and O'RILEY question the WAITRESS.)</p>
<p><strong>Waitress</strong>: Look, I got to get out of here, okay? My kid's with a sitter and it's not like this gig covers day care.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, I know what that's like. I got a kid at home myself.</p>
<p><strong>Waitress</strong>: (retorts) So what, now we're, like, related?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Ah, you know what, get it off your chest. It sucks. You're living for everybody but yourself. But you know what? You're still breathing.</p>
<p><strong>O'Riley</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>Waitress</strong>: So, I'm out here busing tables, and I hear voices.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The WAITRESS looks out the window and sees two men arguing.)</p>
<p><strong>Waitress</strong>: (V.O.) It's nothing new around here.</p>
<p>(The WAITRESS doesn't think anything of it. She turns away and continues to work. A few moments later, she's startled by a gunshot. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Waitress</strong>: And it's like a bomb goes off. I mean ... I thought I was deaf.</p>
<p><strong>O'Riley</strong>: Then what?</p>
<p><strong>Waitress</strong>: And then one guy's on the ground and the other guy's taking off. And no, I didn't see his face.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Did you see a license plate?</p>
<p><strong>Waitress</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Can you describe the vehicle?</p>
<p><strong>Waitress</strong>: It was a pickup. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The pickup truck drives away, tires screeching. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Waitress</strong>: With one of those cover things on the back, you know, a ... </p>
<p><strong>O'Riley</strong>: Camper top.</p>
<p><strong>Waitress</strong>: I know what it's called. Look, Roger was a regular, okay? Draft beer. Tonight, he's drinking J.D. Straight up, six in an hour. If you ask me, he was looking for trouble.CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. BUILDING ROOF -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(NICK is on the rooftop looking around. He walks to GRISSOM and stops to stand right in front of him.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I've been searching high and low for a blunt object. Crow bar, two-by-four, brick, something like that. Nothing. But I did find this crack pipe. I'll get it back to the lab see if I can get some prints off of it. </p>
<p>(As NICK speaks, GRISSOM starts to lose his hearing and for a moment, he can't hear what NICK'S saying at all.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (sound muffled to no sound at all) This roof's not that accessible, you know? Besides, coming all the way up here to get high and low. But still, little extreme for this part of town don't you think?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at NICK and takes his best guess.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Swab it, print it, bag it. See if you can find out who smoked it.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM picks up his stuff and leaves.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. RESTAURANT - PARKING LOT -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks along the parking lot looking for evidence. She kneels down and sees a bullet casing.)</p>
<p><strong>O'Riley</strong>: 50 caliber.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, you need a cannon to fire a hunk of lead that big.</p>
<p><strong>O'Riley</strong>: Feel like hunting for a bullet?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE bags it.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Anything that might have hit it would have ripped right through. Thing's probably still moving.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI -- LAB]</p>
<p>(WARRICK walks to the lab.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Leah! Good to have you back on nights.</p>
<p><strong>Leah</strong>: I know. I hate days.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I came to see you for your expert opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Leah</strong>: Shoot.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: See what you can make of this.</p>
<p>(WARRICK takes out a photograph of the tattoo. LEAH looks at it with magnifying glass.)</p>
<p><strong>Leah</strong>: Hmm. Use of only black and gray ink is known as fine-line. Not a<br />
&quot;scratcher&quot; job.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You recognize this?</p>
<p><strong>Leah</strong>: Signed by the artist himself. Take a look.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I-I?</p>
<p><strong>Leah</strong>: In roman numerals, two. As in &quot;tat-too.&quot; Premier skin artist in Vegas. Also a Ph.D. in psychology.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: He's a shrink?</p>
<p><strong>Leah</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So he gets in your head and under your skin, huh? You're a gem.</p>
<p><strong>Leah</strong>: Thank you. I got a new one.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>Leah</strong>: Check it out.</p>
<p>(LEAH takes her coat off to show WARRICK a butterfly tattoo on her right shoulder.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Nice. The rose is still my favorite, though.</p>
<p>(WARRICK smiles at her and leaves. Camera holds on LEAH.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<hr />
[INT. TATTOO PARLOR -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(NICK and WARRICK walk in to the establishment.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Is the doctor in?</p>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong>: Yes, I am.</p>
<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO:<br />
(The DOCTOR looks at a photograph of the tattoo. NICK looks at something off of the shelf next to a stack of books on mythology. He looks at the DOCTOR and notices him watching. NICK puts the thing back on the shelf.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong>: Skin and ink, ink and skin -- one makes the other one live. You see, that's strength ... </p>
<p>(The DOCTOR points to the &quot;wings&quot; in the tattoo. Camera focuses in for a close up of the &quot;wings&quot;.) </p>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong>: ... and that's superiority ...</p>
<p>(Camera flashes to the entire tattoo.) </p>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong>: ... and that's ambition without limit. See, it's the chosen one.</p>
<p>(He holds up the photograph for them to look at. NICK nods.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p>(The DOCTOR pushes his chair back to get a binder that a customer is looking at.)</p>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong>: Can I borrow that? Excuse me. (He shows them the binder.) It's my book. All my victims. (He flips a page.) His name was Jimmy Maurer.</p>
<p>(He shows them the photo of a young, blonde man proudly showing off his new tattoo for the camera.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: JIMMY MAURER looking at his tattoo. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Was? What do you mean, that's not his name anymore?</p>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong>: He died, didn't he? Well, his fate was inevitable. I simply gave it form.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (looking at the photo) Strength, superiority, and ambition, huh? Not exactly the characteristics of an angel.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong>: No, it's not an angel. It's Greek mythology. Icarus. He flew too close to the sun on wings of feathers and wax.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: And when the wax melted, he plunged to his death.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong>: Hubris. Is that what brought Jimmy down, as well?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, man, you tell us.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong>: How should I know?</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - DNA LAB]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks into the lab.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, Greggy, any luck on those blood and hair samples?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Don't insult me. Luck is for those without skill.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hmm, spoken like a man who's never hit a jackpot.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Hmm, sad but true. (GREG grabs the results from the printer.) Slot plot on the blood and hair ... came back negative. Not human. They're animal.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks at the results.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p>(She turns and heads out of the lab.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: You can take that with you if you want.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Thanks, I will.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY]</p>
<p>(NICK and WARRICK walk through the door to the hallway on their way to the Autopsy room.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: And I spoke with Brass. That squirrelly tattoo artist had a record.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Drug conviction: Crack, cocaine.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You got a print off of that pipe?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Lab's working on it.</p>
<p>(They enter the Autopsy Room.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(DOC ROBBINS is already there.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Hi, fellows. Cause of Death -- any takers?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (sighs) Blunt force trauma.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You know if he's asking we're not going to figure it out.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Nicely played. It's suffocation. After I cleaned him up, noticed bluish discolorations on his lips (Camera moves slowly down the victim's right side to show the bluish colored skin.) ... and on what's left of his nail beds. </p>
<p>(Camera zooms in to the victim's fingernails.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Cyanosis? Body was starved for oxygen.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Strangled, and then thrown off of the roof?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Found no ligature marks on his neck no petechial hemorrhaging. Hence, no forcible suffocation.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay, not beaten to death, not strangled to death. But something bad went down on that roof. He left half his head up there, man </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: uh, more like... uh ... 25%.</p>
<p>(Camera shows the victim's damaged head.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Suffocation means he died with his brain still in his head.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, but there's no evidence of anyone else at the scene. How do you suffocate alone on a rooftop?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: You don't.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: All right. High impact from a high altitude.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Well, above 15,000 feet, hypoxia can occur in minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (nods) He died in the sky.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah... and the rest is gravity.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: JIMMY MAURER falls from the sky at a high speed. He hits the side of the building rooftop and continues to fall to the ground below.)</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>

<p>FADE IN.</p>

[INT. CSI -- HALLWAY]</p>
<p>(WARRICK and BRASS walk down the hallway. )</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know, your vic was an interesting guy. He had no home address. Just post office boxes in California, Utah, Vegas.</p>
<p>(BRASS hands WARRICK a file.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Drive a car?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Nissan Xterra. Cali tags and license, but he was all squared away.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: None of this explains how he dropped out of the sky.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, the, uh, possibilities are limited. Either he was pushed out of a plane or he stowed away in the landing gear, or, um ... skydiving gone bad.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: All right, none of that works. I talked to air traffic control and they had no aircraft operating in that area at that time.</p>
<p>(BRASS walks into his office. After a beat, he walks back out.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: &quot;La lluvia de peces.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The raining of fish. Occasionally, usually in the early spring in Yoro, Honduras, it rains, um ... (nods) ... sardines.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (scoffs) Sardines? That's funny.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Really. I've seen it. (rambling) I mean, the scientific explanation is ... this sounds like a Grissom thing ... is that they get sucked out of the ocean by these waterspouts that are like, you know you know, tornadoes, and, uh, then ... look, the point is, Rick they got to come from somewhere. They gotta come from somewhere.</p>

[INT. CSI -- LAB]</p>
<p>(WARRICK walks into the lab. NICK is already there.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Don't tell me. Rick pleaded ignorance.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Right before he lawyered it up.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Really? Well, , that guy's wasting his money. Take a look.</p>
<p>(NICK hands WARRICK the tip of the frayed line.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It's frayed. You're saying if he had cut it with a tool, it'd be clean.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: These lines are spun polymer. They're lightweight, but strong as hell covered in a plastic shell; now, over time that plastic coating wears down. Unprotected lines rub against one another ...</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Two lines rubbing against one another one strong, the other frayed.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: ... (V.O.) weakening, fraying, until ... </p>
<p>(The frayed line breaks. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: ...snap! It's normal wear and tear, man.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: But Weston knew that that canopy was in bad shape. And we don't have any evidence to suggest that he sabotaged it.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Do you remember a case about a year ago? Diablo canyon?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Oh, the victim of sudden weather that you thought was murdered.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah. You fool me once, shame on you. You fool me twice ... shame on me.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI -- LAB]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE is in the lab working on the bags. SARA walks in. She clears her throat to get CATHERINE'S attention.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Can you help me out?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Uh ... depends.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I can't get out into the field because I'm maxed out on overtime for the month.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Ah, and you're confined to the lab, huh? Well, hey, look, it's regular hours. I mean, go have dinner with the boyfriend ... Hank, right? And, and ... go, go to a spa.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hank is not my boyfriend. And you know, those places are filled with bacteria.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Sara, I don't make the rules around here. You've got to talk to Grissom about that.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah ... he's, um, not really in a talking mood.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What makes you think he's going talk to me? (SARA shrugs.) Get some rest.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'm not tired. Really. I'm not tired.</p>
<p>(SARA walks out of the lab.)</p>

<p>(CATHERINE then takes the first branch piece and tries to match it to the pieces she cut earlier. She finds the match and puts it on the side. She picks up the next branch.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE finds the match to the branch and puts the set on the side.)</p>

<hr />
[INT. CSI -- LAB]</p>
<p>(NICK and WARRICK study the photograph of the two paragliders.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: That's the cumulus cloud formed by warm air rising? The thermals?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, the bigger the cloud, the more air that gets sucked in the stronger the thermal. And check out our boys. Heading straight for it.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yep. He's probably getting the ride of his life.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: JIMMY MAURER up flying and the wind gusting. In front of him FRED DACKS continues to fly. JIMMY gets caught in a particular gust. He looks up at his rig.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (V.O.) He's rising fast.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Air is getting thinner. 15,000 feet he passes out and suffocates.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: JIMMY MAURER flying high in the wind gusts. He gasps for air and passes out.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You catch a good thermal and you take it as far as it takes you -- dead or alive.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: JIMMY MAURER is passed out and flying too high. He falls off of his rig. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: And to show Fred up, Jimmy had to fly higher.</p>

<p>(POLICE OFFICERS search FRANK KRAFT'S residence. CATHERINE and O'RILEY talk with FRANK KRAFT, who sits at the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The key word here: Retaliation. Roger Edmonds cuts the cable that you stole.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Kraft</strong>: He was stealing it himself.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Of course, he was. (She sighs.) So, then you ... chop up his tree ... </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: FRANK KRAFT cuts up ROGER EDMONDS' mulberry tree. When he's done, he throws the shears into ROGER'S yard. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: ... &quot;borrow&quot; Ned's truck to dump the branches ... </p>
<p><strong>Frank Kraft</strong>: I borrow Ned's stuff all the time; he doesn't mind. It's not important to him; it's no big deal ...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (interrupting) Shut up. This isn't about Ned. It's about Roger. So ... while you're out dumping the branches, Roger comes home and sees what you've done to his tree. He ups the ante.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: FRANK KRAFT'S dog is tied to the tree in the front yard and barking. ROGER EDMONDS drives up the front lawn and into the dog. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>

<p><strong>Frank Kraft</strong>: ... my dog!</p>
<p><strong>Roger Edmonds</strong>: Huh, you want some of this, pal, huh?! Come on, come on!</p>
<p>(They both fight over the gun. The gun goes off. ROGER falls to the ground and gasps for air. End of flashback.</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Detective.</p>
<p>(The OFFICER holds up the missing weapon. He gives it to O'RILEY.)</p>
<p><strong>O'Riley</strong>: Desert Eagle.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Something else you ... borrowed?</p>
<p><strong>Frank Kraft</strong>: He killed my dog.</p>
<p>(The OFFICERS cuff FRANK KRAFT.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI -- LAB]</p>
<p>(WARRICK and NICK has JIMMY MAURER'S rig set up in the lab. They examine the oxygen tank.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, the gauge reads full.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, I don't think it works, bro.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: There's only one way to find out.</p>
<p>(WARRICK tests the oxygen tank.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Flowing fine.</p>
<p>(NICK sighs and thinks out loud.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: An experienced flyer, prepared for the altitude. There's no reason not to use his oxygen.</p>
<p>(He scoffs.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (holding the altimeter) Unless he didn't think he needed it.</p>
<p>(Cut to: NICK checks the inside of the altimeter. WARRICK goes over the computer topography.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Okay. Las Vegas is 2,030 feet above sea level. You got that thing plugged in yet?</p>
<p>(NICK sets it up.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: There it is.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Let's see what we've got.</p>
<p>(The computer beeps.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: 30 feet.</p>
<p>(NICK chuckles)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I, uh, I think we're off by a couple of G's. I'll dust it.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM]</p>
<p>(WARRICK, NICK and BRASS question FRED DACKS.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Jimmy's altimeter, your fingerprints ... on the inside.</p>
<p><strong>Fred Dacks</strong>: That's cute. You should put it in a frame. So I fix gear for other flyers sometimes, big deal.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Oh, you fixed it, all right. You decalibrated it. It was off by<br />
2,000 feet.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: FRED DACKS in the back of JIMMY MAURER'S car. He goes through his bag and takes out the altimeter. He opens the altimeter and changes something inside. He closes it up. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: In the air, you lose perspective. You have to trust your instruments </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Jimmy didn't know how high he actually was.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: JIMMY MAURER up in the air and going higher. The wind gusts and JIMMY goes higher. FRED DACKS looks up at JIMMY. JIMMY looks down at FRED DACKS below him and laughs. JIMMY looks at his altimeter which reads<br />
10.039 +. He looks at his second machine and reads +12 / 12,040 ft. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Fred Dacks</strong>: Hey, I already told you, man, this dude was soft in the air. He could've turned back anytime.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: But you knew he wouldn't. You set him up.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, you had perfect sky massive canopy, bitchen thermals, dude and a challenge he'd never refuse. You played him against himself.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: JIMMY MAURER riding high in the air and hiding higher. The altimeter reads 18.517+. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You couldn't stand the fact that he was better than you.</p>
<p><strong>Fred Dacks</strong>: Hey, I called him out, he took me on. Bigger air, higher altitudes push the limit, dude -- that's why we fly.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No, it's not why you fly. The truth is on your arm. Alecto ... Magaera, Tisiphone; the three furies. Unceasing anger, vengeance and jealousy. That's what you're about.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Sorry, dude.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - LOCKER ROOM]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE gets her stuff out of the locker. WARRICK walks in.)</p>

[INT. CSI - GRISSOM'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE passes by GRISSOM'S office and sees that he's inside. She knocks on his door lightly before entering.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Closed that murder I was working. A man's life for a dog's life for a mulberry tree. (she sighs) Sometimes I wonder if people are meant to live together.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, you know what they say -- &quot;good fences make good neighbors.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Then you'd make a great neighbor.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE chuckles )</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks down at his laptop screen. He's looking up information on<br />
&quot;Otosclerosis&quot;. CATHERINE looks down at the laptop.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: New case?</p>

<p>(She leans in to look at what he's reading. Unwilling to let anyone in, GRISSOM changes the screen to show something on &quot;The Longhorned Beetle&quot;.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh ... bugs.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (nods) Mm.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Enjoy.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE leaves the office. GRISSOM switches screens back to &quot;Otosclerosis&quot;. He sighs and goes back to reading.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. MOUNT POTOSI]</p>
<p>(All rigged up and ready to fly, NICK smiles and takes a deep breath before letting go with the wind.)</p>

<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) – DAY]</p>
<p>(The temperature sign on the hotel shows that it's 109 degrees.) </p>
<p>[XCU: BEE] </p>
<p>(A bee is in flight. It flies up to a woman on the sidewalk.) </p>
<p>FLASHES OF VARIOUS PEOPLE ON THE SIDEWALK.</p>
<p><strong>Rev. Alistair Rhodes</strong>: (V.O.) You may believe that you have to die before the judgment comes.</p>
<p>(A one-legged man drops the bottle of liquor he's drinking from. The glass shatters on the sidewalk.) </p>
<p>(Another man is sitting on the sidewalk, his back up against the wall. He's stoned.) </p>
<p><strong>Rev. Alistair Rhodes</strong>: (V.O.) But I say the fire is not around the corner.</p>
<p>(A man with the left side of his face beaten makes his way past the church.) </p>
<p>(The church bells chime.) </p>
<p>[INT. CHURCH – DAY]</p>
<p><strong>Rev. Alistair Rhodes</strong>: (V.O.) The fire is not a-waitin'.</p>
<p>(The congregation sits in the pews, listening to the reverend.) </p>
<p><strong>Rev. Alistair Rhodes</strong>: (V.O.) The fire is not a-wantin'. The fire has already come.</p>
<p>[EXT. BUILDING – DAY]</p>
<p>(A woman stands on her fire escape as she fans herself in the heat.) </p>
<p>(Down below, the man with the left side of his face beaten makes his way past her building. He's holding a plastic bag.) </p>
<p><strong>Rev. Alistair Rhodes</strong>: (V.O.) As we mortals drink, gamble and fornicate our way through this world, --</p>
<p>[INT. CHURCH – DAY] </p>
<p><strong>Rev. Alistair Rhodes</strong>: -- death to Hell's bells thundering toll. The clock of damnations already struck midnight.</p>
<p>[CU: BEE]</p>
<p>(The bee bumps into the window, falls to the ground and dies.) </p>
<p><strong>Rev. Alistair Rhodes</strong>: We gonna die. Stick a fork in the ass of the human race and turn us over on Satan's spit because we all are not going to Hell,<br />
FLASH TO:<br />
[EXT. SIDEWALK – DAY]</p>
<p>(The man with the left side of his face beaten staggers along the sidewalk and stops.) </p>
<p><strong>Rev. Alistair Rhodes</strong>: Surely as we stand in Las Vegas, Nevada.</p>
<p>(He falls to his kneels near the rubbish along the wall. He falls backwards onto some garbage bags and passes out.) </p>
<p><strong>Rev. Alistair Rhodes</strong>: I say we are in Hell. Now.</p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
[EXT. STREET – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Someone steps on the dead bee. Officer cars are lined at the end of the alley, their lights flashing. Catherine and Warrick carry their kits.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Why are we parking in an alley two blocks from the crime scene? </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You know sanitation's flushing out a sewer line. We don't want to block their trucks.</p>
<p>(Warrick sees the body on the garbage bags, a newspaper covering the man's face.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Whoa, what we got here? Hey, guy! Hey!</p>
<p>(Warrick moves the newspaper and sees the man's eyes clouded white.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We've got a male DB.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Call it in. You got it, Mitch? </p>
<p><strong>Officer Mitchell</strong>: I'll tape the scene.</p>
<p>(Catherine and Warrick leave Officer Mitchell with the dead body and they continue their way to their crime scene.) </p>
<p>[EXT. RANCHO CENTER MOTEL -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(They enter the motel parking lot. Officers are on the grounds. Catherine and Warrick make their way to the room. They pass by a man and woman on the steps. In one of the rooms, a man and a woman are on the bed. They continue toward the scene.) </p>
<p>(The officer removes the tape across the door and they walk inside.) </p>
<p>[INT. RANCHO CENTER MOTEL ROOM – CONTINUING]</p>
<p>(Grissom is in the room waiting for them. There's a dead body on the floor at the foot of the bed. On the bed is a second dead body of the woman, her arms and legs tied spread-eagled to the bedposts.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The man was shot execution style--22 to the back of the head.</p>
<p>(Warrick kneels and looks at the blood-soaked carpet under the man's head.) </p>
<p>(They look at the woman on the bed.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Woman was shot as well, bound and gagged. The guests next door complained about the noise, manager finally called the point. Unis found this.</p>
<p>(Catherine looks around.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I don't see any luggage. Wedding rings still on the fingers. Probably rules out robbery, but not infidelity. One gets to watch the other one die? </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The man and the woman are both alive. The man is at the base of the bed, kneeling on the floor while the woman is tied to the bed. Someone shoots the man in the back of the head while the woman watches. End flashback.) </p>
<p>(There's a bullet casing on the floor near evidence marker 1. Warrick picks up the casing and looks at it.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Maybe someone was trying to teach them a lesson.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did you guys happen to see the Fitzgerald's thermometer on your way over? </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Oh yeah, 109. Hot as hell.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Anything under 110 is manageable. Above that, crime rate goes way up.</p>
<p>(A police siren wails nearby.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sounds like it's getting hotter. </p>
<p>SMASH TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[EXT. RANCHO CENTER MOTEL (STOCK) -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(A police car turns into the alley behind the motel. Officers are looking in the pool. Warrick is at the trash bin. He jumps inside to sift through the garbage bags. He lifts up a bag and finds a bloodied shirt.) </p>
<p>(He checks the shirt and notes the sleeves are clean and that there are no buttons at the cuffs. He checks the label and sees its ANTIQUE SHIRTINGS SEWN FOR 17 1/2-36.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. RANCHO CENTER MOTEL ROOM – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Grissom cuts the rope off the woman's wrist. He helps David Phillips turn the body)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Well, there's no wallet or ID on this one either.</p>
<p>(Grissom notices the bedspread.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This looks like a wet spot.</p>
<p>(Grissom looks at it under the ALS.8</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Semen.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: There's no indication she was re-dressed. It doesn't look like sexual assault.</p>
<p>(David takes his clipboard and goes to the second body. Catherine walks up to the bed.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So ... middle-class couple ...</p>
<p>(She notes the BURGER GIANT cup and packaging in the trash bin.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: ... takes a walk on the wild side, checks into this dump for ... some fine dining and romance. Somebody breaks in, kills the man, and tortures the woman. For what?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Maybe it's a drug thing.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, wouldn't be the first time some nice folks from Henderson came east of Fremont to score.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did you find any drug residue or paraphernalia?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Not yet. Maybe Tox'll find it in them.</p>
<p>(Grissom looks down and sees a white Bible under the bed partially hidden by the covers. He picks it up and looks at it. He checks the bedside table drawer and finds the standard Bible in it.) </p>
<p>(He shows Catherine both Bibles.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We have one too many Bibles.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I don't think they helped.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. RANCHO CENTER MOTEL – PARKING LOT – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Brass interviews the motel night manager.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So you didn't hear or see anything suspicious?</p>
<p><strong>Night Manager</strong>: This job -- you kidding me? That's all I see and all I hear.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Is that the register? Give it to me, give it to me.</p>
<p>(The night manager gives the clipboard to Brass.) </p>
<p><strong>Night Manager</strong>: Oh. Room 106. Paid for the week, cash in advance, signed 'em in myself.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We got a problem.</p>
<p><strong>Night Manager</strong>: What's the problem?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Your handwriting sucks. What the hell does this say?</p>
<p><strong>Night Manager</strong>: Oh ... uh ... oh, that. That's the name here and that's, that's a, well, that's an &quot;A.&quot; Uh ... and the license plate ... uh ... that's an &quot;N&quot; and -- oh-- that's a &quot;V.&quot; That's &quot;Nevada.&quot;</p>
<p>(He shows the form to Brass.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (duh) You think?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) – DAWN]</p>
<p>[INT. ALLEYWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(CSI Ronnie Lake takes photos of the dead man found in the alley among the garbage bags while Sara looks at the bugs on it. Officer Mitchell stands nearby watching them.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Green bloat stage. He's been here at least 18 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Ronnie Lake</strong>: Do you ever wonder why ants don't crawl up the nose, eat the brains? I would. Protein.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Ants are scavengers; they tend to stay on the surface.</p>
<p><strong>Ronnie Lake</strong>: You think dead skin tastes better than brains?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, they will go for brains late in decomp, after all the skin is gone.</p>
<p><strong>Ronnie Lake</strong>: Do ants have taste buds?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Ronnie ... I'm going to have to limit you to twenty questions per case.</p>
<p><strong>Ronnie Lake</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (amused) Nineteen.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (o.s.) Hey, Sara.</p>
<p>(Sara gets up as Brass walks toward them.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey ... Jim. </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So ... enjoying the sunshine? </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Not really. (She turns to the body.) DB is a derelict. I'm kind of surprised to see you investigating this.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, I'm not working this. I'm working the double homicide over at the Rancho Center Motel. We're just doing a neighborhood sweep for suspects. (He sees Ronnie.) You're new. I'm Jim Brass.</p>
<p><strong>Ronnie Lake</strong>: Yeah. Ronnie Lake.</p>
<p>(They shake hands.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Right. Ronnie Lake. Like Veronica. You know, the actress?<br />
&quot;Sullivan's Travels&quot;?</p>
<p><strong>Ronnie Lake</strong>: I think that's my dad's favorite movie.</p>
<p>(Sara smiles.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>Dispatcher (over radio)</strong>: Two-zero-three-Charlie, Control. We have a few hookers who used the motel. They're willing to talk.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, 203-Charlie, I'm on my way. Got to run. Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Ronnie Lake</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p>(Brass waves and leaves.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Mandy reports her findings to Catherine as they move through the hallway.) </p>
<p><strong>Mandy</strong>: So I got a hit off of the print on the motel room's &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; sign.</p>
<p>(Catherine looks at the results.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Drug dealer with priors for assault-- nice.</p>
<p><strong>Mandy</strong>: Yes, well, don't get too excited because I got another hit off of the telephone-- pedophile-- and I got one off of the dresser—a rapist-- and another one off of the bed frame-- a prostitute, a pimp, and another prostitute.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Is that it?</p>
<p><strong>Mandy</strong>: For felonies, yes. You want misdemeanors, too?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – LAYOUT ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Wendy goes over her findings on the shirt with Warrick. The shirt and photos of the shirt are spread out on the table.) </p>
<p><strong>Wendy</strong>: So the blood on the shirt belongs to your victims. The high velocity spatter on the front is a mixture of both and the blood drops on the left sleeve appear to solely belong to the woman.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Probably cast-off from the beating.</p>
<p><strong>Wendy</strong>: Now, the pattern on the sleeve has a straight line on the outside, and then a matching band of spatter on the inside. So the killer rolled up his sleeves?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: He had a lot of work to do.</p>
<p><strong>Wendy</strong>: Speaking of which -- the wet spot. (She looks at the results.) The s*x stain was a male-female combo, both unknown, but the female shared alleles at all loci with both of the victims. It's their daughter.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: The parents weren't that old. The girl would be a teenager at most. So the killer caps Mom and Dad, rapes the girl, and takes her with him.</p>
<p>(Catherine walks into the room with print information.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: If you've got a missing kid, I've got a pedophile.</p>
<p>(Warrick looks at the information.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Alistair Rhodes. Busted in August '94 for child molestation.</p>
<p><strong>Wendy</strong>: That's pre-CODIS, so there's no DNA on file to match.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Alistair Rhodes. I remember this guy. He was a lounge singer, called himself &quot;Three Miles of Bad.&quot; It was all over the news.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, according to the sheet, he served five years and made parole. A registered s*x offender. We know where he lives.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. CHURCH – FRONT STEPS -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Rev. Alistair Rhodes talks with two kids sitting on the front steps. He offers them a bag of burgers. The kids take the food.) </p>
<p><strong>Rev. Alistair Rhodes</strong>: You think those are your fingers itching to pick up the spike? Your hands injecting your veins? &quot;Satan finds mischief still in idle hands.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (o.s.) Alistair Rhodes.</p>
<p>(Brass and an officer walk up to him.) </p>
<p><strong>Alistair Rhodes</strong>: Most people around here just call me &quot;Reverend.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (to the kids) Hey, why don't you guys go super-size those?</p>
<p>(He offers the kids a bill. They take it and leave.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, Reverend, I hear that confession is good for the soul. You have anything to tell me?</p>
<p><strong>Alistair Rhodes</strong>: The man you're looking for no longer exists. If you'll excuse me, I have some chores to do.</p>
<p>(Alistair Rhodes turns and enters the small church. Brass follows him inside) </p>
<p>[INT. CHURCH -- CONTINUING] </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You ever been to the Rancho Center Motel?</p>
<p><strong>Alistair Rhodes</strong>: Plenty of times--with hookers, addicts, drug dealers, pimps, wife beaters, runaways. I save people.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You ever save these two? </p>
<p>(Brass shows him the crime scene photo of the two bodies in the motel room. Alistair Rhodes is quiet.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know them, don't you?</p>
<p><strong>Alistair Rhodes</strong>: There's nothing I can tell you.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: These people have a daughter, and she's missing. And due to the fact that you're a convicted s*x offender, that means that you better come up with a lot more than these corny priestly homilies and you better come up with them fast.</p>
<p><strong>Alistair Rhodes</strong>: I don't answer to you. I want to talk to my lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: That's a good idea because you're under arrest.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – A/V LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Warrick enters the A/V Lab where he finds Archie struggling with some equipment.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yo, Rambar, I have some documents to ...</p>
<p><strong>Archie</strong>: Sh ... piece of junk.</p>
<p>(Archie puts the equipment down.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Where's Rambar?</p>
<p><strong>Archie</strong>: Where all state employees go when they fail repeatedly.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: FBI Lab?</p>
<p><strong>Archie</strong>: Sucking down taxpayer dollars in Quantico as we speak. Me, I like to think I'm broadening my horizons.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, along with your pay grade.</p>
<p><strong>Archie</strong>: Oh, happy coincidence indeed, sir. What you got here?</p>
<p>(Warrick gives Archie the motel registration form.)</p>
<p><strong>Archie</strong>: Wow. Somebody needs to switch to decaf.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: In there somewhere is a Nevada plate number and a name. Can you dig it out?</p>
<p><strong>Archie</strong>: I could try.</p>
<p>(Archie puts the motel registration form on the scanner.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: The plate number is &quot;something, something, something, D, seven, something, something.&quot;</p>
<p>(Archie runs the plate number, * * * D 7 * *.) </p>
<p><strong>Archie</strong>: Okay, well, it's a fairly new model. The four letter, three number configuration has only been standard a couple years.</p>
<p>(The computer beeps with 54,756 results.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Ooh.</p>
<p><strong>Archie</strong>: Well, uh ... it's a start.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, can yoy cross-reference these records against the characters in the vic's last name. It's &quot;M, A, blank, blank, blank, I, blank, blank.&quot;</p>
<p>(Archie runs another search with, &quot;M A * * * I * *.&quot;)</p>
<p>(The computer beeps.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Now that's a good start.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The lights go out in a section of the city.) </p>
<p>[EXT. MACALINO RESIDENCE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Warrick and Nick head up the front walk. An officer is behind them.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Alvin and Girlie Macalino. Let's do it. This makes what, the third power outage since summer?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Fourth, actually. If I didn't know any better, I'd say the city was trying to get rid of us. That's a hundred dollar fine right there.</p>
<p>(He notes the sprinklers on in the yard.) </p>
<p>(They approach the open front door. Nick and Warrick exchange looks.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: That's not good.</p>
<p>[INT. MACALINO RESIDENCE – NIGHT -- CONTINUING] </p>
<p>(Warrick opens the door.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Las Vegas PD. Is anybody home?</p>
<p>(He takes his gun out. Nick enters behind him. The officer follows them inside. They note the framed religious pictures on the wall and the cross on another wall.) </p>
<p>(They enter in further and note the wooden cross displayed on the dining room table.) </p>
<p>(Nick stops.) </p>

<p><strong>Lawyer</strong>: That is tragic, but it has nothing to do with my client.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Your fingerprints were found at the motel where the Macalinos were murdered.</p>
<p><strong>Lawyer</strong>: My client has already explained that.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know, back before you were saving souls, when you were just molesting children, you had a partner ...</p>
<p><strong>Lawyer</strong>: Who died in prison eight years ago. </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We found male DNA on the bedsheets at the Rancho Center Motel. You got yourself a new partner, just like old times.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [MOTEL] Alistair Rhodes holds Amy down on the bed while his partner unbuckles and unzips his pants. End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Only, this time, the parents busted in on you. That was bad for you, but worse for them. And now that mom and dad are never going to come home, you get yourself a whole new playpen to party in and a new buddy to party with.</p>
<p><strong>Lawyer</strong>: The DNA at the motel -- was it my client's?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Lawyer</strong>: Then why is he still in custody?</p>
<p>(Brass sits down.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Because he's still lying. You're not an ordained minister. You're not a part of any recognized church. You got nothing to hide behind. So avoid the death penalty -- give us your partner, we get the girl, and you get ... redemption.</p>
<p><strong>Lawyer</strong>: Six years ago, I was an alcoholic and a crackhead. This man pulled me out of the gutter and saved my life. My firm is doing this pro bono. I guarantee he will not do another day in jail.</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Videos one through five. LAWYER: I advised the reverend to document his rituals for situations just like this. He performed a religious service with the full consent of the parents and then he left the motel room.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Look, if you think we're going to fall for that, you have a lot more faith than I thought.</p>
<p>(Grissom is in the room watching the interview.) </p>
<p><strong>Lawyer</strong>: He has no knowledge of the deaths or of Amy Macalino's current whereabouts.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Counselor, is this your idea of cooperation?</p>
<p><strong>Alistair Rhodes</strong>: L-listen to me. Listen to me. The mother came to me ... at her wit's end, heart in her hand, begging me, begging me to free her child. She said she'd tried doctors and pills, but nothing worked, so I went to the house, I saw it with my own eyes.</p>

<p>(Grissom walks over and sits at the table across from Rhodes.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The exorcism-- did it work?</p>
<p><strong>Alistair Rhodes</strong>: No. Amy's father broke the rules: never speak to it, never interrupt, and believe me completely, do only as I say.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And he didn't believe.</p>
<p><strong>Alistair Rhodes</strong>: Mr. Grissom, do you believe in a separate, living evil?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You're primitive man on the savannah. You see something move out of the corner of your eye. You assume it's a hyena. You run, you live. If you assume it's the wind and you're wrong, you die. We have the genes of the ones who ran. We're genetically hardwired to believe living forces that we cannot see.</p>

<p><strong>Amy Macalino</strong>: Jefferson Middle.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Amy, what grade are you in?</p>
<p><strong>Amy Macalino</strong>: Sixth. I'm 12.</p>
<p>(Catherine looks confused.) </p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – INTERVIEW ROOM – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Brass continues to talk with Andrew Wolflynn.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We got your fingerprints, your semen. I mean, we got you in the dead couple's car working to bang their kidnapped daughter. We got ... did I leave anything out? Oh, yeah, we got your gun.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew Wolflynn</strong>: I don't own a gun.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No, you know, we checked the serial number. It belongs to your grandmother. But you know ... and you know, it must be really hard to get that gun off ol' granny.</p>
<p>(Brass walks around Andrew to check his collar.) </p>
<p><strong>Andrew Wolflynn</strong>: What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'm just checking your shirt size. I might want to give you a Christmas present. 17 1/2, 36. You know what? I was leaving something out, Wolf. We got your shirt soaked not in one but both of the victims' blood. You see, this is what we call slam dunk. You're going to jail. You're going to do time. But why do it alone? Don't be a patsy. Just tell us the name of your partner. Come on, share with a friend. And you know what? You don't even have to tell me his name. All you have to do ... is point.</p>
<p>(Brass shows him Rhodes' photo. Andrew shakes his head.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>Andrew Wolflynn</strong>: I've never seen that guy before in my life.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Come on, you can do better than that.</p>
<p>(In the observation room, Warrick notices that Andrew's cuffs are opened and flipped back over his wrist.) </p>
<p><strong>Andrew Wolflynn</strong>: I want a lawyer.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – LAYOUT ROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Warrick is back in the layout room with the bloodied shirt. He measures the void on the sleeves. He marks it on a separate shirt.) </p>
<p>(He tries the shirt on, then tries to roll the sleeves up to the line on the shirt. He can't do it. Catherine walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey. I'm trying to make some sense out of the spatter. Now, we've already determined that the ... the killer rolled up his sleeves when he murdered the motel victims, but when I found the shirt, the cuffs were buttoned, and I'm not much bigger than this guy. And look. This is as far as the sleeves go up.</p>
<p>(He shows her that he can only roll them up to a little past his wrist.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Would you give me the shirt off your back?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Sure. Here you go.</p>
<p>(He helps Catherine put the shirt on.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(Catherine rolls the sleeves up to the line.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Easy.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So Wolflynn wasn't wearing the shirt, was he?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I guess Amy was. A trophy after s*x.</p>
<p>(Grissom walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hey. I have something I'd like you to see.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – A/V LAB – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Grissom clicks on the icon to open the computer information.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The Macalino family computer was recovered from the stolen car. Archie ... found the chat logs.</p>
<p>(Grissom opens the log. It reads: </p>
<p>Wolfman: You look so hot in that photo.<br />
Wolfman: We need to meet soon!<br />
Amy17: If you could take me out where would –<br />
Wolfman: Any where you want?<br />
Amy17: Anywhere is better than here.<br />
Amy17: I'm lonely.<br />
Wolfman: so lets meat somewhere.<br />
Amy17: I can't.<br />
Wolfman: Y? Whatcha doing?<br />
Amy17: about to shower.<br />
Wolfman: You hot and sticky?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: A lot of traffic between Amy and the &quot;Wolfman.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Keep reading.</p>
<p>CLOSE-UP OF MONITOR:<br />
Amy17: How bad do U want me?</p>
<p>CLOSE-UP OF MONITOR:<br />
Wolfman: I can taste it.</p>
<p>CLOSE-UP OF MONITOR:<br />
Amy17: Talks is cheap.<br />
Amy17: Prove it.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It looks like Amy's luring the Wolfman.</p>
<p>(The remainder of the screen reads: </p>
<p>Wolfman: I'll do anything!<br />
Amy17: R U bad enough?<br />
Amy17: R U my badboy?<br />
Wolfman: Damn straight.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What would you do if you found this on Lindsey's computer?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Ground her for life. Take the laptop. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Lock her in the attic, maybe?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, you push kids, they push back. Things can get out of hand pretty quick.</p>
<p>CLOSE-UP OF MONITOR:<br />
Amy17: I need a bad MAN.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The Macalinos were pushed all the way to an exorcism. Now, Alistair Rhodes says that he left the motel when his ritual failed. The video shows the father tried to stop it. He probably untied her. Right?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So Amy escapes, she goes and gets her knight in shining armor.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, Wolf and his .22 caliber.</p>
<p>CLOSE-UP OF MONITOR:<br />
Amy17: Can U handle it? </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: They return to the motel.</p>
<p>CLOSE-UP OF MONITOR:<br />
Wolfman: Yeah.</p>
<p>CLOSE-UP OF MONITOR:<br />
Amy17: Handle me? </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The parents are gone, but the room's still paid for.</p>
<p>CLOSE-UP OF MONITOR:<br />
Wolfman: Hell, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: They have s*x and burgers.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: And Amy calls her mom and dad, who come back because they still love her.</p>
<p>CLOSE-UP OF MONITOR:<br />
Amy17: Let's do it.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Dad gets killed first ... quick, but Mom, the true believer, the one who wanted to drive out the demons, she has to suffer.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback of: [MOTEL ROOM] Amy gleefully hits her mom on the bed. End flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And Amy goes home to get her computer ... and kills her little sister.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'll call Brass. We'll go pick Amy up.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) – NIGHT]</p>
<p>[INT. CPS -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Amy Macalino sits alone in the room. She smiles. There's a knock at the door.) </p>
<p><strong>CPS Attendant</strong>: Amy, there's somebody here to see you. Could you come with me, please?</p>
<p>(Amy swings her legs over to the side of the bed.) </p>
<p>[INT. CPS – STAIRWAY – CONTINUING]</p>
<p>(Amy and the CPS attendant head up the stairs.) </p>
<p>[INT. CPS – VISITING ROOM – CONTINUING]</p>
<p>(The CPS attendant leads Amy up to the visiting room.) </p>
<p><strong>CPS Attendant</strong>: Just wait in here.</p>
<p>(Amy steps into the room to wait. The CPS attendant leaves.) </p>
<p>(Amy looks up as Alistair Rhodes steps into the room. He closes the door behind him.) </p>
<p>[INT. CPS – LOBBY – CONTINUING]</p>
<p>(The front door opens. Catherine, Brass and an officer step in.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We need to see Amy Macalino.</p>
<p><strong>CPS Attendant</strong>: Popular girl tonight. She's upstairs with her minister.</p>
<p>(Brass turns and heads for the stairs.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (to the officer) Let's go! </p>
<p>(Brass and the officer head up the stairs.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Her what? (to radio) Control, this is Willows. I'm at CPS. I need backup. Code Three now. </p>
<p>(Brass and the officer head up the stairs.) </p>
<p>(Amy screams.) </p>
<p>(Catherine looks up at the topmost floor.) </p>
<p><strong>Alistair Rhodes</strong>: I cast you out! </p>
<p>(Rhodes pushes Amy off the railing. Amy screams as she falls and lands at Catherine's feet.) </p>
<p>(Catherine gasps.) </p>
<p>(Brass and the officer reach Rhodes, their guns out.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Alistair, turn around. Turn around. Now!</p>
<p>(Rhodes turns around with his hands up.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Get down on your knees.</p>
<p>(Rhodes slowly gets down to his knees.) </p>
<p><strong>Alistair Rhodes</strong>: I saved her. I saved her.</p>
<p>(The officer handcuffs Rhodes.) </p>
<p>(Brass shakes his head. Rhodes gets to his feet and the officer leads him away.) </p>
<p>(TOP VIEW DOWN: Amy is dead on the lobby floor in a pool of blood. Catherine looks at her.) </p>
<p>(After a moment, Catherine starts taking photos of Amy. The officer takes the CPS attendant's statement in the back of the lobby.) </p>
<p>(Grissom walks in with his kit.) </p>
<p>(Catherine looks at Grissom. Grissom shakes his head, then looks up at the floor above them. He puts his kit down and looks around. He stops when he sees something.)</p>
<p>(There on the floor is a dead bee. Grissom picks it up and looks at it. He looks back at Amy's body.) </p>
<p>(HOLD on GRISSOM.)</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>

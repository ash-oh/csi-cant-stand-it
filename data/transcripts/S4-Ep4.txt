<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>(Various voice overs of several radio announcers dissolving one over of the other.)</p>
<p><strong>Announcer (man)</strong>: (V.O.) It's going to be a scorcher and ... </p>
<p><strong>Announcer (woman)</strong>: (V.O.) In Las Vegas, the temperature is already 108 degrees.</p>
<p><strong>Announcer (man)</strong>: (V.O.) Get yourself off to the tap and keep yourself drinking all day along</p>
<p><strong>Announcer (woman)</strong>: (V.O.) It's so hot, you could cook an egg on a sidewalk ...</p>
<p><strong>Announcer (man)</strong>: (V.O.) A record number of heat stroke victims.</p>
<p><strong>Announcer (woman)</strong>: (V.O.) ... no relief in sight.</p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO:</p>
<p>BLUR INTO:</p>
<p>(A woman slowly makes her way to her parked car. She puts her drink down on the car trunk and reaches into her bag to get her keys. She looks around and something catches her eye. She sees a baby in the baby seat in the back seat of a car.)</p>
<p>(She gets closer for a better look. Once she realizes that it is a baby, she cries out to get help. A small crowd gathers around at the commotion.)</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: Help! I need help!</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: Ma'am, you all right?</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: There's a baby inside the car!</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: Where are your keys?</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: It's not my car. Help! Somebody help us!</p>
<p>(A MAN gets a KID'S skateboard and rushes back to the car.)</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: Get back! Get back!</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: Help!</p>
<p>(The MAN smashes the skateboard in through the car window. The broken glass shatters onto the unmoving baby inside.)</p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO:</p>
<p>[EXT. PARKING LOT -- LATER] </p>
<p>(EMERGENCY PERSONNEL are gathered around the car.) </p>
<p>(GRISSOM and CATHERINE make their way to the car. BRASS sits inside looking for the car ownership papers.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Registration's not here. This is the shopping plaza. Mother can't be too far.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE peers in through the window.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: When are parents going to learn a car is not a baby-sitter?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at the thermometer. It reads: 108.2F.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: 108 degrees outside.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You want to document the inside temperature? </p>
<p>(BRASS opens the back door and GRISSOM puts the thermometer inside the car. He shuts the car door.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: How many of these have we had this year?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I lost count after ten.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This one makes twelve.</p>
<p>(A man walks toward the car to see what the commotion is about.)</p>
<p><strong>Paul Winston</strong>: Hey, that's my car. Look, what the hell is going on? Hey, that's my car. What are they doing? Did somebody break in to my car?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'm Detective Brass, Las Vegas Police. Sir, do you have a son?</p>
<p>(PAUL WINSTON looks at BRASS as it occurs to him.)</p>
<p><strong>Paul Winston</strong>: Oh, god! Joshua!</p>
<p>(GRISSOM reaches back into the car and checks the thermometer. It reads:<br />
145.0F.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: 145 degrees inside the car.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns and looks at PAUL WINSTON, in agony over his son.)</p>
<p>SMASH CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS DESERT (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>(Various voice over's of radio announcers.)</p>
<p><strong>Announcer 1 (man)</strong>: (V.O.) There is an advisory ...</p>
<p><strong>Announcer 2 (woman)</strong>: (V.O.) Stay in ...</p>
<p><strong>Announcer 3 (man)</strong>: (V.O.) ... make sure you wear a hat and drink plenty of liquids ...</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. PARKING LOT -- DAY] </p>
<p>(CATHERINE and DAVID PHILLIPS peer in to the back seat of the car. CATHERINE takes pictures while DAVID PHILLIPS does his paperwork.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: If it's not babies in cars, it's babies in swimming pools. It's that time of year.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Body's fully rigid. Normally, I'd say the infant's been dead for a couple of hours, but in this weather, it's possible the infant died no more than an hour ago. I'm all through, Catherine.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I brought a sheet. All these Looky-loo's, I think we'd better treat this like the baby's still alive.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE puts her camera down and reaches for the baby. She takes the baby out of the car, stands, allows GRISSOM to wrap the sheet around the baby, then she carries the baby over to the CORONER'S van. She steps inside, puts the baby on the gurney, straps the baby in, steps out of the van and shuts the doors.)</p>
<p>(The CORONER'S van leaves.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAKE (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p><strong>Ranger Stone</strong>: I spotted her from my boat during a routine patrol.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Two prints and drag marks. Did you move her?</p>
<p><strong>Ranger Stone</strong>: Had to. Didn't want her floating away.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The two officers drag the body out of the water and up the bank to higher ground. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Short shorts. Rock soft shoes. Dressed for sport.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No sign of bloating.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Chances are she's been dead less than twenty-four hours.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Her neck looks been broken, her head split, but there's no coat of foam.</p>
<p><strong>Ranger Stone</strong>: No what?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Uh, we have air in our lungs, add water, you have foam.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It means she didn't drown.</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Well, drownings not the only way to die out here.</p>
<p>(SARA looks around the area.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - INTERVIEW ROOM -DAY]</p>
<p>(BRASS interviews PAUL WINSTON while CATHERINE watches from the OBSERVATION ROOM.) </p>
<p><strong>Paul Winston</strong>: I was supposed to drop Joshua off at Day Care. My wife usually brings him on the way to work. It was a hectic morning. My cell phone was going off. Problems at the office.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [CAR (MOVING) - DAY] PAUL WINSTON is on his cell phone.)</p>
<p><strong>Paul Winston</strong>: Look, I don't care how much pressure we get from the finance here. Will you hold on a second, I have another call.</p>
<p>(PAUL WINSTON presses his cell phone button and starts on the next call.)</p>
<p><strong>Paul Winston</strong>: Yeah, sorry, I can't do this right now. I'm driving. Hold all the calls. Tell them, they have to wait.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Paul Winston</strong>: I forgot he was in the backseat.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: How could you forget?</p>
<p><strong>Paul Winston</strong>: I'm not the one who drives him. Vicky does that.</p>
<p>(BRASS glances over at the mirrors. On the other side, CATHERINE watches the interview.) </p>
<p><strong>Paul Winston</strong>: I was distracted. My job consumes so much of my mind.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What kind of job do you have?</p>
<p><strong>Paul Winston</strong>: I'm an agent for the Gaming Commission. It's a twenty-five hour a day job, eight days a week.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Your wife work?</p>
<p><strong>Paul Winston</strong>: She works as much as me. Joshua made it all worth while.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Where's your wife now?</p>
<p><strong>Paul Winston</strong>: She's in L.A. on business. How am I going to tell her?</p>
<p>(PAUL WINSTON puts his head in his hands.)</p>
<p>(Camera holds on CATHERINE.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(NICK and SARA go over the body. NICK snaps photos while SARA takes off something from the WOMAN'S scalp.)</p>
<p>(Camera zooms in for a close up.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Green ... something.</p>
<p>(NICK snaps more photos.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No birthmark. No scars, no tattoos.</p>
<p>(NICK looks and sees an indention under the wrap around the WOMAN'S waist. He reaches out to check and finds a key for locker #28.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I got a locker key.</p>
<p>(He looks at it. They continue working.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You put in for the promotion, huh.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, yeah. Last week. I still haven't heard anything about it.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah, neither have I.</p>
<p>(DAVID PHILLIPS walks in.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Hey, you ready for me?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: It's all yours.</p>
<p>(NICK leaves.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Heard you had a rough morning.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: I've had better.</p>
<p>(DAVID removes the shoes from the WOMAN'S feet. He starts to wash the body and finds something unusual. SARA notices the bluish tinge to the WOMAN'S lips.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Sara, take a look at this. What is that?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I don't know.</p>
<p>(They share a look. DAVID shrugs.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - DAY]</p>
<p>(The x-rays are spread out on the table as ROBBINS talks with SARA and NICK.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: You were right about your dead swimmer. She didn't drown. Cause of death was a culpable fracture of the neck, C1-C2.</p>
<p>(ROBBINS reaches out and points to the area on the x-ray on the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: From the blow to the head.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Probably. Cerebral contusions beneath the skull fracture. Savage hit.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Greg processed the sexual assault kit. Positive for semen.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: There were no physical findings for rape. Not a lot to go on here. Gastric lumen contained dark, pasty material, maybe slightly digestive meat, stringy vegetable matter.</p>
<p>(NICK'S cell phone rings. He moves aside to answer it.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Does it give us a timeline?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Emptying rates vary from person to person, but I estimate that she ate two to four hours before death.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (b.g.) Hello. Yeah. All right. Good.</p>
<p>(NICK hangs up.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Ranger Stone came through. We found our locker.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(CATHERINE turns the corner.)</p>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: Ms. Willows. Chief Deputy D.A. Jeffrey Sinclair.</p>
<p>(They shake hands.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: mm-hmm. Personal visit. Must be important.</p>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: It is. Joshua Winston. The dead infant.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We're working on it.</p>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: How long was the baby left inside the car?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Based on the time of death, uh, we estimate roughly an hour. The 9-1-1 call came in 11:30 in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: Okay. And what time does Paul Winston start work?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: According to Captain Brass ... uh, ten a.m.</p>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: Hour and a half. Come on. I got a three year old at home and I've left him inside in a covered garage with groceries two minutes tops. But two hours in this heat?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I know. It's a tragedy.</p>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: You know, cases like these almost never see the inside of a court room, but this one will.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Is there any worse punishment than losing your child?</p>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: Yeah, jail time. I want him behind bars so the next time a parent steps away from their vehicle in triple degree heat, they check the backseat before they lock the door.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Doesn't change my job.</p>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: Look, I need you guys to thoroughly document this case. I don't want any more surprises in court. So, from the car to the kid, just try to cross your T's and dot your I's, okay?</p>
<p>(JEFFREY SINCLAIR steps away.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I always do.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - GARAGE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(CATHERINE and GRISSOM check the car out.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Car seat's fastened correctly. Most aren't.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE removes the car seat.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, Gil. Look at this. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: uhm ... nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Exactly. There's no indentations in the leather.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, maybe this wasn't the primary vehicle for transporting the baby.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah. Same thing the father said.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM sees something.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks and sees the drops.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I don't know.</p>
<p>(She takes a swab of it and tests it for blood.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Negative for blood.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What are you thinking?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (shakes his head) I don't get people.</p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) -- DAY] </p>
<p><strong>Announcer (man)</strong>: (V.O.) It's still hot out there folks.</p>
<p><strong>Announcer (man)</strong>: (V.O.) If you have to be outside, please, take your water bottle.</p>
<p><strong>Announcer (woman)</strong>: (V.O.) Take the advice and drink plenty of fluids.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. JONES' RESIDENCE -- DAY]</p>
<p>(WARRICK takes pictures as he walks around the dead body. He looks up as GRISSOM enters the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (surprised) You with me?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I am now. Catherine's doing the baby case. It's hot in here.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>(WARRICK takes more pictures of the scene around the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Super came in and checked the a/c and he found him like this. Wesley Jones. 33. His massage chair. No signs of forced entry.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It doesn't appear that robbery was a motive.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Small bruise on the fingertip, but no outward signs of trauma.</p>
<p>(WARRICK takes more pictures.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I had a case once where a soda can was the murder weapon. Suspect used it to bash in the victim's head.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks around the room as WARRICK takes a picture of the soda can.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Diet shake, fitness magazines, cookie crumbs on a baking sheet. This guy's trying to start a diet or falling off one?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He's got a workout schedule. And today? Three-mile run. Fat metabolizers containing ephedra. Scorching heat and ephedra? That's not good.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback of: WESLEY JONES walking through his apartment, wobbly and woozy. He gets a drink out of the refrigerator and makes his way to his chair. He sits down, then has problems breathing. He lays back and dies. End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Sounds like a heat stroke to me.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah. Feel the burn.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - DNA LAB -- DAY]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks into the lab.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, Greg.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: How are we doing on that swab?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Ah, should be ready any minute. Another baby. I hear the D.A.'s really gunning for the father. What do you think they're going to charge him with? Murder?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Not likely. Child endangerment. Child neglect. Child abuse.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Sounds like a slap on the wrist to me.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You and the D.A. can shake hands.</p>
<p>(The printer prints the results.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Your print out's ready.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: The red stain in the car ... prophenerine malaeise. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Cough syrup.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAKE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(NICK reaches into the open locker and takes out some chips. He hands the chips to SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Dollar slots.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Is there truly no place left in Las Vegas without slot machines?</p>
<p>(He takes out the other contents of the locker. He hands the bag to SARA while he checks the wallet.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: University student ID. Sophia Renatta, 20 years old.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: And a guy's wallet. No credit card. No driver's license. </p>
<p>(SARA pulls out a t-shirt from the bag.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Oh, this is too big for Sophia. It's double extra large.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, that's certainly a guy's. Could be a boy-friend's ... beach buddy ... ?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Suspect?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAKE - DAY - SHORT TIME LATER]</p>
<p>(NICK and SARA interview the OWNER of a WAVERUNNER RENTAL.) </p>
<p><strong>Rental Owner</strong>: Yeah, I remember her and her punk in shining armor. </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: He wasn't a cool guy? </p>
<p><strong>Rental Owner</strong>: He stiffed me. Twice, bro. Rented a waverunner, didn't bring it back, and that cheap-assed plastic got a two-pay limit. I'm out five grand.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Ouch.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: They look like a couple to you?</p>
<p><strong>Rental Owner</strong>: She was a pretty girl with a problem. He knew and in when he saw one.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: SOPHIA RENATTA tries to rent a waverunner.)</p>
<p><strong>Rental Owner</strong>: You got a credit card?</p>
<p><strong>Sophia Renatta</strong>: No.</p>

<p>(She falls in. He screams, excited.)</p>
<p><strong>Mark Young</strong>: Whoo-hoo!</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (V.O.) And he jumped in after her.</p>
<p>(When he sees that she hasn't surfaced, he jumps in.) </p>
<p>(UNDERWATER: He finds SOPHIE and tries to get her free. He surfaces and dives back in. His ear drums burst and he dies, tangled in the weed below.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: This was an accident, Sara. He was trying to save her.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: That's a great theory. But we can't prove that.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Twenty-six feet under with a busted eardrum? If not to save her, why dive that deep?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I don't know. Case is over.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Almost over.</p>

<p>(Using the photos of the scene up on the wall, WARRICK shows GRISSOM his theory.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Found this mineral residue that led all the way from the massage chair to this burnt-out power strip across the room ... water stain.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, there's your conductor.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I also found them on the cookie sheet and this water-damaged magazine right here. And I found this plastic bag in the kitchen garbage.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: &quot;Ice block.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Add that with the fan, you got yourself a homemade swamp cooler.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The ice block is set up in front of the running fan. WESLEY JONES sits in his chair cooling off. The water from the ice drips out of the pan, on to the magazine, down the table and pools on the floor at his feet.)</p>
<p>(As more ice melts, the water pools and runs along the power cord all the way to the electric socket. The socket shorts, the shock runs along the cord and water, up through WESLEY JONES' feet and out to the telephone in his hand.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Inventive.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Guy was just trying to stay cool.</p>

<p>(SARA rounds the corner and finds NICK talking with MR. YOUNG.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I think he died trying to save someone's life.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Young</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No, it's my pleasure.</p>
<p>(She sees them shake hands. MR. YOUNG leaves.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey, Nick.</p>
<p>(NICK picks up his messages off the counter. They turn and head back inside.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What did you tell him? His son died a hero?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Look, I'm just trying to give the guy a little peace, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Oh, well, who are you trying to help feel better, him or you?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, let me ask you something, Sara: You're Mr. Young, would you rather know this much or nothing at all?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You know, if the evidence doesn't support the answer, a CSI shouldn't be asking that question.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, okay, if that works for you.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Be careful.</p>
<p>(SARA walks away. NICK walks off camera frame.)</p>

[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[EXT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(BRASS and CATHERINE interview PAUL and VICKY WINSTON.)</p>
<p><strong>Vicky Winston</strong>: I was in the garden this weekend. Why are you so interested in everything we do? I mean, when did our lives become an open book?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: When your second son ended up dead.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: When you were in the garden, was Joshua with you?</p>
<p><strong>Vicky Winston</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Winston</strong>: Yes, he was. We had a fight...</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: VICKY is in the garden. PAUL walks up with JOSHA in his arms, the baby's crying.)</p>
<p><strong>Paul Winston</strong>: Vicky, it's your turn. I've had him for the past four hours.</p>
<p><strong>Vicky Winston</strong>: What, are you counting hours now? He's your son.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Winston</strong>: Look, if you're not gardening here, then it's at work. I've had him all day. It's your turn. Here. </p>
<p>(He hands the baby to VICKY, stands up and leaves.)</p>
<p><strong>Paul Winston</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Vicky Winston</strong>: See the pretty flowers, Joshua?</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(VICKY looks at PAUL and sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Vicky Winston</strong>: I guess he was. But the moment he passed Joshua off to me I went inside.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Did you wash your hands?</p>
<p><strong>Vicky Winston</strong>: Honestly, I don't remember. I'm in the garden a lot, so I'm sure I washed my hands.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, I met with your pediatrician, Dr. Garner. When you brought Joshua in on that emergency call, it was because you feared that he, too, had Tay-Sachs.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Winston</strong>: We had the test before he was born. Dr. Garner said we were fine.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I can imagine for both of you it must have been like reliving the nightmare. One child, now two.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Did you know that repeated exposure to certain pesticides, even in small amounts, can have an adverse effect in infants? Even mimic the signs of Tay-Sachs?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The symptoms are similar. Floppiness of the head, arching of the back. </p>
<p>(VICKY and PAUL share a look of alarm.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Blindness ... inability to swallow.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You work with pesticides, Mrs. Winston, on your job and in your garden. And you handled Joshua -- we suspect that that's how the traces got into his system. I'm just speculating here, but I think this is what happened next:</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to)</p>
<p><strong>Vicky Winston</strong>: No, Paul. I went through hell with Howard, I can't go through that with Joshua.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Winston</strong>: We'll wait for the enzyme tests.</p>
<p><strong>Vicky Winston</strong>: No. No more tests. No more drugs. No more kids. No more! I can't live through that again, and neither can you.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You gave Joshua cough syrup, Mr. Winston. Why did you medicate him?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: 'Cause, maybe, you just didn't want him to suffer?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: PAUL WINSTON gives JOSHUA some cough syrup. He closes the car door and walks away. He looks back at the car, then turns the car alarm on, leaving JOSHUA in the car.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Vicky Winston</strong>: You have no idea what it's like to watch your child die. </p>
<p><strong>Paul Winston</strong>: We couldn't go through that again.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The shame of it is you didn't have to.</p>
<p>(She sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The enzyme test that dr. Garner ran came back negative. Joshua didn't have Tay-Sachs. You killed a perfectly healthy baby.</p>
<p>(VICKY WINSTON whimpers softly, then starts to cry.)</p>
<p>FADE TO WHITE</p>
<p>[EXT. PARKING LOT]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks out to her car. She gets inside and shuts the door. She turns on the temperature gauge. It reads: 135 degrees F inside temp.)</p>

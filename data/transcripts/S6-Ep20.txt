<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>[EXT. CONVENTION CENTER DRIVE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Open on a concert poster-covered pole or palm tree. A kid carrying a backpack with a pink-colored canister tucked in it runs to the pole. He stops at the base and pauses to cover his mouth and nose with his black sweater, completely obscuring his face except for his eyes. He pulls down his black cap lower on his forehead.)</p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO: </p>
<p>(The young man pauses and peers around the pole. Two other young people dressed similarly appear with him. They all peer around the pole to make sure the coast is clear.)</p>
<p>(They run quickly across the street. They each run to a poster-covered pole and start climbing the pole.) </p>
<p>POV: BARREL OF THE GUN</p>
<p>(Through the center of the gun barrel, we see one of the young people climbing the pole.) </p>
<p>RESUME VIEW</p>
<p>(Fireworks burst in the night sky.)</p>
<p>(The young man climbing the pole nearly reaches the top. He climbs quickly.) </p>
<p>POV: BARREL OF THE GUN</p>
<p>(Through the center of the gun barrel, we see the young man continuing to climb up the pole.) </p>
<p>(Quick CGI EFX: A gun fires and the bullet exits the barrel. The bullet speeds up straight toward the climber.) </p>
<p>(The climber grunts upon impact.) </p>
<p>SMASH CUT TO: </p>
<p>[EXT. CONVENTION CENTER DRIVE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The body is hanging from the top of the pole. A light shines on the dead body dangling mid-air.)</p>
<p>(From the ground, Nick shines his flashlight up at the body. Grissom walks over to him. He stops and looks at Nick.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Feel like getting high?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Do I have to?</p>
<p>(Grissom nods. He turns and walks past Nick, who takes out his radio.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (to radio) Hey, this is Stokes. I need a lift, Convention Center Drive. </p>
<p><strong>Dispatch</strong>: (from radio) Copy that -- </p>
<p>(Grissom and Nick head over to Brass, who is standing on the road nearby a second body.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Looks like somebody had some late-night target practice. Three Boy Does. No IDs. Nobody saw anything.</p>
<p>(Grissom looks down at the body nearest him. There are bullet shells on the road nearby.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Nine-millimeter shells all over the place.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: That's a lot of racket. Somebody heard something.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, the only ones who did thought it was the fireworks show at the Wynn. Good luck.</p>
<p>(Brass turns and walks away. Grissom turns and walks over to the second body on the pavement. David is near the body with another forensics person. David peels open the victim's shirt to find a thin clock hanging from the front, a bullet-sized hole hanging securely around his neck.) </p>
<p>(Grissom kneels down next to them. Nick looks over his shoulder.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What do you think? Time of death: 3:17 A.M.?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Shot through a Flavor Flav clock. Haven't seen one of these since high school. </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Old school's the new school.</p>
<p>(Right in front of him, Grissom picks up a stapler from off the pavement.) </p>
<p>(CAMERA ZOOMS in for an extreme close-up of the bloodstains at the tip of the stapler.) </p>
<p>(Grissom looks up at the poster-covered pole. At the top are posters for BANK NEW ALBUM APRIL.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (to Grissom) So, what do you think? This has got to be a gang war, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, if it's a gang war ... (he looks at the stapler) ... these kids were outgunned.</p>
<p>FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>WHITE FLASH IN: </p>
<p>[EXT. CONVENTION CENTER DRIVE - DAY]</p>
<p>(In the broad daylight, the body is still up on the pole, hanging upside down, dangling by his legs. In the background, we see two police cars parked in the center of the road to block traffic. Nick has put in pink rods in the bullet holes at the top of the pole.) </p>
<p>(Nick is standing on the lift as he goes through the dead body's pockets.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (shouts) No personal effects! No keys, no ID! Nothing!</p>
<p>(Down below, Warrick is standing near a body with his camera. He pauses and looks up at Nick.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Either these kids were traveling light, or they were robbed blind.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: And who the hell would rob them up there? Andre the Giant?</p>
<p>(Warrick steps away from the body and walks over to the next body Robbins is examining.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey, Doc, is it just me, or did something crush his legs?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Well, first off ...</p>
<p>(Robbins pulls the sweater away from the victim's face and shows that the BOY Doe is really a GIRL Doe.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: ... looks like he is a she, and something crushed her legs.</p>
<p>(Warrick snaps photos of the body. He leans down and sees something just under the girl's leg. He snaps a photo of it and reaches down to pick it up. Robbins gets to his feet.) </p>
<p>(Warrick holds up the round circular tubing.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What do you think this is?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: That's your job.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(Warrick puts the item down and stands up.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well ... I did find casings in such a wide distribution ... and a lot of them were flattened, so it suggests to me that the killer was moving when he was shooting.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: Tires screech. A car moves by quickly as bullets swish by amidst gunfire.) </p>
<p>(A body falls to the ground. The car continues. A person is leaning out the car window as the car passes.) </p>
<p>(More gunfire is heard. The car runs over the girl's legs. The heavy metal tubing falls to the ground.)</p>
<p>RESUME TO SCENE</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Drive-by?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, with a hit-and-run chaser.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) -- DAY] </p>
<p>[INT. CSI - BALLISTICS LAB - DAY]</p>
<p>SCOPE VIEW: THE BULLET</p>
<p>(Under the scope, the bullet turns around its side.) </p>
<p>RESUME VIEW</p>
<p>(Bobby Dawson is looking through the scope. He lifts his head as he thinks.)</p>
<p>(Nick enters the lab.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What up, Country? </p>
<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: So, the bullet is practically smooth. I mean, no sharp-edged rifling marks.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Which means it was probably fired from a polygonal barrel. Did you run cartridge casings yet?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: Yeah, yeah, and got an IBIS hit off of a firing pin impression. Murder weapon is an H&amp;K MP-5.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: That's a $2,500 firearm. That's not your typical street piece.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: Yeah. It's registered to LVPD.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(Bobby turns to the computer, hits a key and a new screen with information appears:<br />
{Right side: Photo of Bullet}<br />
SPEER 9 mm LUGER<br />
ID: 37283-2</p>
<p>{Left side: INFO}<br />

SUSPECT INFO: --<br />
MISCELLANEOUS: LOCAL REF # 4738-43</p>
<p>NOTE: Weapon stolen from SWAT vehicle during a drug raid on Vegas Valley and Sandhill. Contact LVPD immediately with any new leads.) </p>
<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: Those babies are very popular with law enforcement, and that one is issued to SWAT ... and reported stolen during a drug raid on Vegas Valley and Sandhill ... six months ago.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - TRACE LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Hodges examines the rod Warrick found at the crime scene. He finds a number etched in it: 867252B--.) </p>
<p>(He scrapes a paint sample off the edge of the rod and looks at it under the scope.)</p>
<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO: </p>
<p>[INT. CSI - TRACE LAB - LATER]</p>
<p>(Warrick enters the lab.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hodges, you getting anywhere with that steel rod we found?</p>
<p>(Hodges is looking at the monitor on the RED'S PRO-SERIES HYDRAULICS site, which reads: </p>

<p>(He clicks to the rods listing.)</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Your steel rod is part of a custom hydraulic cylinder. Size and shape is a match for a brand called &quot;Red's.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Oh, this guy was driving a street hopper. Low-riders get little clearance ...</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: [ROAD] The car runs over the dead body's feet. It hits the legs and the rod falls off onto the road. End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'm sure he was more busted up about his ride being damaged than the three kids he whacked.</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Hmm. </p>
<p>(Hodges walks around the table to pick up a file folder with the test results.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Also found paint traces on the rod. Color is Chesapeake Blue Pearl. It's from a Dupont line called &quot;Brilliantz.&quot; Mostly used on show vehicles. Red's auto parts are individually serialized. Shouldn't be too hard to find out where it was sold.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: A'ight, G, so ... </p>
<p>(He holds up two fingers. Warrick turns and heads out.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Don't make me shoot you.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. GARAGE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Warrick and Nick walk and talk with the owner, Marcus. They walk past various cars in the garage. The place is busy.) </p>
<p><strong>Marcus</strong>: Crime Scene Investigation. Hell, I love a bloody scene ... DNA and all that. Look, you give me a serial number, I can definitely figure out who bought it.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, yeah, here you go.</p>
<p>(Nick hands Marcus the slip of paper with the number on it.) </p>
<p><strong>Marcus</strong>: A'ight.</p>
<p>(He looks at the number.) </p>
<p><strong>Marcus</strong>: This is the old style cylinder. Give me a second.</p>
<p>(Marcus sits behind the computer and types the number into the AUTOMOTIVE RESTORATION CUSTOMER DATABASE. The screen pops up.) </p>
<p>ENTER SERIAL NUMBER: 62867252B<br />
<strong>Owner</strong>: JEREMIAH CALVIN<br />
ADDRESS: 59391 SANDHILL<br />
CITY STATE: LAS VEGAS, NV</p>
<p>(He looks at the name, then hits DELETE.) </p>
<p><strong>Marcus</strong>: Yeah, man, this, uh ... serial's not showing up.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You said &quot;definitely.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Marcus</strong>: Yeah, but these old serial numbers sometimes get erased from the system. I mean, it's happened, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Sounds like the wrong name might've just popped up.</p>
<p><strong>Marcus</strong>: No name popped up.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What's the matter, man? You worried about having some hard times if you give your homey's name up?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I'll get a warrant. You don't mind taking a break for a while, sitting on the curb while we get some cops up in here.</p>
<p><strong>Marcus</strong>: Look, man, I don't need that kind of a scene around here.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: How 'bout we do this? How 'bout you let us muscle you off your computer, and we can get the information ourselves? That way, if you're ever asked, you can say there was nothing you could do. You can let us do our jobs, and we'll be out of your hair.</p>
<p>(Marcus thinks about it.) </p>
<p><strong>Marcus</strong>: I can live with that.</p>
<p>(Marcus gets up and walks away.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Good man.</p>
<p>(Warrick types in the number and the screen for JEREMIAH CALVIN pops up on the monitor.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Jeremiah Calvin, 59391 Sandhill.</p>
<p>(Nick leans forward, his voice low so as not to be overheard.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: That's the same part of town where the SWAT cop lost his gun.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS - SANDHILL (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[EXT. ROAD -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Nick and Warrick wait in the SUV. They've been waiting a while.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: How long ago did I call for backup?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: About fifteen minutes.</p>
<p>(Nick sighs and picks up the radio to make the call again.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (to radio) Dispatch, this is unit 3D7. We are 465 at 59391 Sandhill. ETA on that backup?</p>
<p><strong>Dispatcher</strong>: (over radio) Unit 3D7 copy, ETA approximately five minutes.</p>
<p>(Nick and Warrick continue to sit outside the house they're watching.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (to radio) Copy that. We'll sit tight.</p>
<p>(Just then, a car pulls up outside the house.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hello. There's our gangster ride right there.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: With a gangster in it.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p>(The car stops, but doesn't park. It jumps up and down, then takes off.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Look at that.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: He saw us.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I think I'll go get him now, man, before I lose that boy.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Go for it, go for it.</p>
<p>(Warrick starts the engine and follows the blue car.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (to radio) Dispatch, this is unit 3D7. Suspect is on the move. It's a, uh, royal blue Chevy Impala northbound on Vegas Valley Drive. License 4-2-3-<br />
Nora-Queen-John. Northbound.</p>
<p><strong>Dispatch</strong>: (from radio) Copy that. I'll inform the backup.</p>
<p>(Warrick continues to follow the car. Nick looks around for street signs.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Where are we now? Where are we now? </p>
<p>(The car turns; Warrick turns.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (to radio) Dispatch, Westbound Hatteras. Westbound Hatteras. Suspect is now west on Crag Avenue.</p>
<p><strong>Dispatch</strong>: (indiscernible response) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: We're now southbound on Eastern.</p>
<p><strong>Dispatch</strong>: (indiscernible response) </p>
<p>(The suspect's car turns the corner. Warrick turns and finds the car parked.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Dispatch, uh, this is unit 3D7. Suspect has pulled into an alley on the 7700 block on Eastern. Requesting backup.</p>
<p>(The driver of the car leans to the right.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: He's reaching for something.</p>
<p>(The driver gets out of the car, his hands in his pockets.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Jeremiah Calvin</strong>: I told you little punk ... airport cops to stop riding me, man.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Son, get back in the car.</p>
<p>(Jeremiah Calvin doesn't listen. He advances toward the car, his hands still in his pocket and voice rising.) </p>
<p><strong>Jeremiah Calvin</strong>: You get out the car! All this old crime scene stuff followin' me, man.</p>
<p>(Nick gets out of the car.) </p>
<p><strong>Jeremiah Calvin</strong>: Y'all think you're all cops? Y'all ain't cops.</p>
<p>(Nick takes out his gun and points it at Jeremiah Calvin.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: That's right, we're not cops. We're mad scientists. (commands) Back away from the vehicle and let me see your hands right now. </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Dispatch, we got a code three.</p>
<p><strong>Jeremiah Calvin</strong>: Hey, hold on, man, you calling for backup? Your backup or my backup? </p>
<p>(The tension level rises a notch higher. Warrick takes his sunglasses off.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Son, you trying to win the wet tee shirt contest? My partner here's a great shot.</p>
<p><strong>Jeremiah Calvin</strong>: Yeah, you're real cute with that gun, too.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I'm not going to tell you again.</p>
<p><strong>Jeremiah Calvin</strong>: You know what, man? I've had so many damn guns pointed at my face, I feel right at home looking at yours. </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Let me see your hands.</p>
<p><strong>Jeremiah Calvin</strong>: How you know I won't shoot your man? Huh? How you know I ain't got something at my waist pointed at your man right now?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Listen --</p>
<p>(Jeremiah Calvin steps closer to Warrick's door.) </p>
<p><strong>Jeremiah Calvin</strong>: You know, hollow points'll go right through the door.</p>
<p>(Warrick reaches out through the open car window and grabs Jeremiah's jacket, pulling him forward and knocking his head against the door.)</p>
<p>(Nick rushes around the car to help subdue Jeremiah Calvin. Sirens blare in the distance and grow louder as the officer car arrives.) </p>
<p><strong>Jeremiah Calvin</strong>: I got nothing on -</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You don't listen - </p>
<p>(There's some commotion as two officer cars arrive to assist.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (to the officers) Whoa, whoa, hey, right here.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You have a hard time listening, huh?</p>
<p>(The officers run out to help. They handcuff Jeremiah Calvin.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Check him for weapons, Mitch.</p>
<p>(Officer Mitch checks Jeremiah Calvin for a weapon.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer Mitch</strong>: It's cool. He's clean.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: He's clean?</p>
<p><strong>Jeremiah Calvin</strong>: I don't need no gun for you!</p>
<p>(The officers grab Jeremiah Calvin and lead him to the car.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer Mitch</strong>: Stay down.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (to Warrick) Be cool. Cool. Just be cool.</p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So you borrowed it two nights ago?</p>
<p><strong>Jeremiah Calvin</strong>: No, I didn't. I was working, man. I deejay over at O.G. If you don't believe me, you could ask Jeni, and Rocker Jules, and GG, and Lina, and Blaze and you know, I had my first five-some that night. And there wasn't no homicides goin' down. You could believe that.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'm happy for you, man. So, what, are you pinning this rap on Grandpa?</p>
<p><strong>Jeremiah Calvin</strong>: Yo, man, my grandpa was a gangster back in the day. You'd be surprised.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, I'm really not surprised by much anymore. We have a warrant to search your house ... and I bet I find a crime to go with every gun.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, he doesn't have lock-wrist. You got a pen?</p>
<p>(Vega gives Catherine his pen and notebook.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We matched your blood to the staple gun; it puts you at Convention Center Drive and you go down for three murders. </p>
<p>(She puts the pen in Morris' hand and the paper in front of him.) </p>

<p>(End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, but we don't have a murder weapon, so we can't confirm Morris was the shooter. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: There's a ton of unknown prints on the car. GSR in the backseat. Had to be other people involved. If we could id the vics, it might tell us who'd want them dead.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Standard procedure for a drive-by is shoot as much as you can as fast as you can, right? Then leave as fast as you can. So why did Morris get out of the car?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Maybe the vics had something he wanted.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: The only thing the victims on the ground had on them were the clothes on their back. And the kid in the palm tree, empty satchel.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Vega ran the vics past the guys in the gang unit. Nobody recognized them.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: And tox panels on them all came back negative. There were no drugs in their system, no personal effects. I doubt they were even packing.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Are you suggesting that they were killed for their posters?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Maybe for what was on them.</p>

<p><strong>Margaret Kendric</strong>: Hi-Def. That's what he calls himself.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: The State of Nevada's willing to pay to send your daughter back to California for burial.</p>
<p><strong>Margaret Kendric</strong>: I couldn't afford to bury my husband.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: In that case, she'll be cremated. I'll make sure you get the remains.</p>
<p><strong>Margaret Kendric</strong>: You send her ashes to Hi-Def.</p>
<p>(Margaret Kendric gets up abruptly and leaves.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. MAGIC SHOW AFTER PARTY - DAY]</p>
<p>(The party is in swing. Girls are in bikinis and dancing to the live music.)</p>
<p>(In the background, we see Sofia, Nick, Sara and a couple of uniformed officers making their way through the crowd. Sofia stops when she sees him.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: That's our guy. The one in the red hat. That's Hi-Def.</p>
<p>(Nick notices a group of people wearing black shirts - the same black shirts he saw in the hotel room.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Looks like Dollar's crew is here, too. All the rappers come to MAGIC. Go ahead, I'll catch up.</p>
<p>(Nick heads off in a different direction.) </p>
<p>(Sofia and Sara make their way toward Hi-Def. They walk up toward him, but stop at the red velvet ropes.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Afternoon.</p>
<p>(J-Lady steps forward.) </p>
<p><strong>J-Lady</strong>: You must be in the wrong spot. This isn't the security hut.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: We need to talk to Hi-Def.</p>
<p><strong>J-Lady</strong>: Can't wait till after the show?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Either you get him or we will.</p>
<p>(J-Lady turns and heads over to Hi-Def. She talks with him for a moment before he gets up and walks over to Sara and Sofia.) </p>
<p>HI-DEF: What do you cops want from me?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: You ever see these kids?</p>
<p>(Sofia shows Hi-Def the autopsy photos.) </p>
<p>HI-DEF: Never.</p>
<p><strong>J-Lady</strong>: I have. They're from our street team. They look kind of weird in those pictures, but Ray never smiles.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: They're dead.</p>
<p><strong>J-Lady</strong>: (surprised) What?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: They've been gone three days. You didn't notice?</p>
<p>HI-DEF: Don't look at me, ma'am. I never seen those kids before ever, sorry.</p>
<p>(He steps aside.) </p>
<p><strong>J-Lady</strong>: Look, we've got kids coming and going all the time. It's hard to keep up. I mean, I know who they are; it's Ray, Marvin and Gentra.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Do you know their last names?</p>
<p><strong>J-Lady</strong>: No, I'm sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, do you know where they got this?</p>
<p>(Sara shows J-Lady the DOLLAR poster.) </p>
<p><strong>J-Lady</strong>: Probably the same place I got this.</p>
<p>(She takes out her cell phone and dials. She hands the phone to Sofia. Sofia and Sara watch the Dollar in a bikini video.)</p>
<p>CUTS BETWEEN THE TWO INTERVIEWS: </p>
<p>[EXT. MAGIC SHOW AFTER PARTY - OTHER SIDE OF THE POOL - DAY]</p>
<p>(Meanwhile, Nick makes his way over to Dollar's crew.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, guys.</p>
<p>(Drops steps forward between Nick and Dollar's crew.) </p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: Whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: How you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: Let me get one of those for you. Here you go.</p>
<p>(Drops grabs a rolled-up poster and hands it out to Nick.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No, thanks, man, I'm all set. You know, personally, I think it's a bad idea to hit on blackjack.</p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: Well, you know, that's just how we do. We never bust.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I know all about Dollar. What's your connection?</p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: Are you a cop?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I work with the police department, yeah. Crime Lab. My name's Nick Stokes.</p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: Drops. And let's just say Dollar pays the bills.</p>
<p>[EXT. MAGIC SHOW AFTER PARTY - DAY]</p>
<p>(J-Lady explains where she got the video.) </p>
<p><strong>J-Lady</strong>: The video just showed up on my desk. First day of the show. It was in a plain manila envelope.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So you put it on the Net.</p>
<p><strong>J-Lady</strong>: I never said that, but things happen.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Did Hi-Def and Dollar have a beef before this?</p>
<p>J-LADY; Yeah, a couple of years ago, Dollar did song called &quot;New Vegas.&quot;<br />
Talking about how Las Vegas is the new New York. Hi-Def is New York. He and Dollar been punking each other ever since.</p>
<p>[EXT. MAGIC SHOW AFTER PARTY - OTHER SIDE OF THE POOL -- DAY]</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What's the deal with these street teams. What's going on?</p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: They do all the filthy, dirty, grimy promo for Dollar. Snipe posters, give away stickers, pass CDs around. Nothing really.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You know, three kids were murdered the other night doing the exact same thing.</p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: What can I say, man? These kids run the streets, bro. Anybody at any given time can run up on them and try and lullaby their ass.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, I don't know about that. They were putting up posters of your boy Dollar -- ones that made him look a lot stupider than just hitting on blackjack, you know what I mean?</p>
<p>(Nick takes out the morgue photos and shows them to Drops.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Take a look at these kids. See if you recognize any of them.</p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Show them.</p>
<p>(Drops nods. He hands the photos to the crew, Ben and Dante. They look at the photos.) </p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: (to Nick) Nice suit. Glad to see you dressed for the occasion.</p>
<p><strong>Crew</strong>: No.</p>
<p>(He hands the photos back to Drops. Drops gives them back to Nick.) </p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: Eh, sorry, Crime Lab, Nick Stokes. Nobody here's got a clue.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, okay.</p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: Yeah, okay. Oh, well, what do you know? There goes one of my birds. Sorry, got to go. Peace.</p>
<p>(He holds out his hand. Nick doesn't take it.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I'll see you soon, Dawg.</p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: Yeah, whatever. Look, you need any more posters, just scream at me.</p>
<p>(Drops looks past Nick and heads off in that direction, bumping Nick on his shoulders as he walks past him.) </p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: Hey, Tweety! Tweety!</p>
<p>(Dollar's crew leaves Nick and follows him.) </p>
<p>(Nick looks down at the photos ... and the visible fingerprints on the photo paper.) </p>
<p>(Nick smiles.)</p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[INT. CSI - HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Sara catches Nick in the hallway. They're both on the move.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Mandy matched two prints off the photo that you gave to Dollar's street team to the unknowns that I found in the low rider.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: One was on the passenger side door, the other one was on the steering wheel.</p>
<p>(Nick sighs.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. HOSPITAL -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Dollar is sitting on the bed getting his hair cut while he is on the phone. Around him, the room is filled with his various ENTOURAGE MEMBERS.) </p>
<p><strong>Jessie &quot;Dollar&quot; Cleveland</strong>: (to Drops) Hey, yo, yo, yo, make sure you tell him about that crazy new suit line we got coming out. </p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: (o.s.) Mr. Yen says, &quot;Moshi, moshi.&quot;</p>
<p>(He turns around as Brass enters the room with a uniformed officer.) </p>
<p><strong>Jessie &quot;Dollar&quot; Cleveland</strong>: Now what?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'm here for Drops. (He motions to the phone.) Hang up.</p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: (to phone) Konnichiwa.</p>
<p>(He hangs up.) </p>
<p>(Drops steps closer to Brass.) </p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: I'm expanding into Asia.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No kidding? Where's your street team?</p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: They're grubbing -- they went down to the cafe hospital. You know, they're kind of Benigni over that Waldorf salad. </p>
<p>(He looks over at the ENTOURAGE. They chuckle.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: They're murder suspects.</p>
<p>(Drops turns and looks at Dollar, who has been listening to the conversation.) </p>
<p><strong>Jessie &quot;Dollar&quot; Cleveland</strong>: (serious) Get them up here.</p>
<p>(Drops sighs and shakes his head.)</p>
<p><strong>Drops</strong>: This is very disappointing.</p>
<p>(Brass sighs, unimpressed.) </p>
<p>(He turns around just as the DANTE and BEN return. They step out of the elevator and into the hallway. They turn and see Brass in front of them. They stop mid-conversation, pause and turn in the opposite direction intending to escape.) </p>
<p>(They're instantly blocked by two uniformed officers.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Yo, gentlemen, on the wall.</p>
<p>(The two kids turn and are forced to put their hands on the hallway wall as the officers frisk them.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM A -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Sofia Curtis interviews Ben.) </p>
<p><strong>Ben</strong>: I didn't shoot nobody. Please, you got to believe me. I just wanted to drive that car. Morris was always bragging about it.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: I'll believe you if you tell me what really happened.</p>
<p><strong>Ben</strong>: I was picking up an order for Drops. I saw that poster on the wall. I just told the other guys what I saw. Look, I know I shouldn't have done that, 'cause as soon as I did, Morris wanted to see the poster. Morris would do anything for Dollar. You know, Dollar's his life. He only has Dollar in his ipod. No one else.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: So then you went to CC Drive.</p>
<p><strong>Ben</strong>: Yeah. We just waited for them to show up.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Who is &quot;they&quot;?</p>
<p><strong>Ben</strong>: Some other snippers. Hi-Def street team. Morris didn't care who they were, ... </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [EXT. STREET - NIGHT] The three kids from Hi-Def's street team run and scatter across the street to put up the posters. Ben and Dante sit in the car with Morris Calvin.)</p>
<p><strong>Ben</strong>: (V.O.) ... as long as they was putting up them posters, they was dead to him.</p>
<p><strong>Dante</strong>: Morris, hurry up, man -- you just said you were gonna scare them.</p>
<p>(Morris Calvin sits in the back seat of the car holding the gun. He watches the other kids.) </p>
<p><strong>Morris Calvin</strong>: Nah, man. That poster makes Dollar look like a ho. Dollar's nobody's ho.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(Morris fires on the kids.) </p>
<p>(Scared, Ben takes off.) </p>
<p>(Morris continues to fire. One of the kids falls on the road. Ben runs the car over the kid; the car rod falls off.) </p>
<p><strong>Ben</strong>: (V.O.) I ran them over.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Ben</strong>: After he got the first one ... he said he had to get the rest.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [EXT. STREET - NIGHT] </p>
<p>( Gunshots )</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [EXT. STREET - NIGHT] Morris continues to fire. The kid on the palm tree is hit and falls backward.) </p>
<p><strong>Ben</strong>: (V.O.) He shot the second one next, down off the palm tree. </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Ben</strong>: The last one almost got away.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [EXT. STREET - NIGHT] The remaining kid runs like hell down the street.) </p>
<p><strong>Morris Calvin</strong>: (o.s.) Drive, man! Drive!</p>
<p>(The car engine roars as Morris shoots the kid down.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: What was Dante doing during all of this?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM B - DAY]</p>
<p>(Brass listens to Dante.) </p>
<p><strong>Dante</strong>: I was just riding shotgun, watching Morris.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You didn't do anything about it?</p>
<p><strong>Dante</strong>: He was out of his mind.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Where did Morris get the gun?</p>
<p><strong>Dante</strong>: It was in the trunk. He said his brother swiped it off some dumb-ass cop.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Where is it now?</p>
<p><strong>Dante</strong>: Broken apart and thrown away.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Pro style.</p>
<p>(Dante nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Looks like you and your buddy are gonna get broken apart and thrown away, too. </p>
<p><strong>Dante</strong>: I guess there's nothing else to say.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Guess not.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - LAB -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Nick empties the bag's contents on the table. Among the various contents, Nick finds a piece of wood.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - A/V LAB - NIGHT5] </p>
<p>(Nick is reviewing the video.) </p>
<p><strong>Dollar</strong>: (from video) This ain't right, Dawg.</p>
<p><strong>Gunman</strong>: (from video) (o.s.) Now who's the bitch? Huh? Who's the bitch now?</p>
<p>(In the last bit of video, Nick freeze-frames and enhances the picture of the gunman's hand and gun.) </p>
<p>(The gun has a wooden handle.)</p>
<p>(Nick has a digital image of the wooden piece found in Morris' backpack and matches it to the wood on the gun's handle.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - GRISSOM'S OFFICE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Nick reports his findings to Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I figure Dante had that revolver when he was going up and down those poles. Grip gets thumped, chips off in the satchel.</p>
<p>(Grissom compares the two photos.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Wood grain seems consistent, this means Dante made the video.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You said Dante works for Dollar.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He's a fan. Why would he humiliate someone he respects?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (sighs) I don't know. I don't know, but on the video, Dante did say, &quot;Who's the bitch now?&quot; So ... you could say it got a little personal.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So ... get personal.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - LAYOUT ROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Crime scene photos are spread out on the table. Nick goes through all the photos. In front of him, he also has the three victims' file folders open. He also has the suspects' file folders open.) </p>
<p>(He sees something in Dollar's folder. Information that reads:<br />
&quot;DOLLAR&quot;<br />
SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION:<br />
CLEVELAND PRODUCED VIDEOS IN THE<br />
THE &quot;CHICKS GONE NUTS&quot; VIDEO SERIES )</p>

<strong>Father</strong>: WHEREABOUTS UNKNOWN<br />
<strong>Siblings</strong>: ONE <strong>Sister</strong>: TISHA JANNETT<br />

<strong>Sister</strong>: TISHA JANNETT</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[CHICKS GONE NUTS VIDEO]</p>
<p>(Dollar sits in bed while Tisha Jannett, dressed in a two-piece bikini, jumps on the bed.) </p>
<p><strong>Dollar</strong>: (from video) Yo, what's up, it's your boy Dollar, from &quot;Chicks Gone Nuts&quot;. We're out here in Vegas, baby. We got whatever you want -- chicks, jewelry. We got the bottles. Come holler at us, you know.</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - BRASS' OFFICE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Brass and Nick show Tisha Jannett, Dante's sister, the video. She's a pretty, young woman with deep, disfiguring scars on her face.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So you obviously know Dollar. You know, your brother has been arrested for felony kidnapping and assault and accessory to murder. Now if there's anything that you know that can help us understand his motivation, now's the time to tell us, okay?</p>
<p>(She looks away for a moment.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Tisha ... what happened to your face?</p>
<p><strong>Tisha Jannett</strong>: About a year ago, during black spring break, Dollar caught me walking through the MGM. He was hosting this Chicks Gone Nuts video. Said he'd give me $500 to put on a bikini and jump on his hotel bed. I needed the money ... so I did it. I got my money and went home. Couple months later, Dante came busting into my room with the tape. He cussed me out ... forgot about that, too. Until my dad saw the tape. He called me a whore and a slut. He had his car keys in his hand. He cut up my face, my chest, my stomach. I haven't seen him since. </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: And Dante blamed Dollar. </p>
<p><strong>Tisha Jannett</strong>: He couldn't find Daddy. He wouldn't blame me.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So he joins Dollar's street team to get close to him, close enough to sneak into his hotel room and videotape him, the same way he videotaped you.</p>
<p><strong>Tisha Jannett</strong>: I know he didn't mean for anyone to die. He just did it for me.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
VARIOUS SCENES -- MONTAGE</p>

<p>(Camera pulls back and we find Dollar back in his hotel room and on the phone. Business continues as usual.)</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - BRASS' OFFICE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Brass is sitting on his desk and looking through a file folder. An officer walks in carrying a large, flat box wrapped in purple paper and topped with a yellow bow. She puts it on his desk and leaves.)</p>
<p>(Brass opens the box and lifts the purple tissue paper. He looks away and drops the tissue paper. We don't see what's inside the box, but we can guess.)</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - LAB - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Nick opens his box and finds a suit inside. He takes the suit out of the box and looks at it.) </p>
<p>[EXT. POOLSIDE - DAY]</p>
<p>(A courier carrying a canister of ashes walks up to Hi-Def and J-Lady. The courier gives the canister to Hi-Def. He takes the canister and looks at the label:</p>

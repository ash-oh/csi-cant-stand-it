Laurel Tessler :  This is the scene in seven hills, where casino mogul Bruce Eiger has been found dead on the grounds of his palatial estate.
 
Laurel Tessler :  Eiger turned sixty earlier this year, ... 
 
Laurel Tessler :  ... throwing himself a half-a-million-dollar birthday party at his newly renovated Queen Regent Casino.

Laurel Tessler :  Cause of death remains unknown, but as Eiger himself famously joked: In Vegas, if nobody wants you dead, you're not working hard enough. Reporting live from Seven Hills, I'm Laurel Tessler.
Man: Thanks Ginny. In this exclusive community ...
 
Conrad Ecklie: What's the 4-1-1?
 
Brass: Wife comes home from canasta at the club, finds hubby dead in the driveway, calls 9-1-1. No sign of forced entry. The alarm was off. Nothing seems to be missing.
 
Brass: Welcome to the party.
 
Catherine: What's going on? This is my scene.
 
Conrad Ecklie: High profile case -- woke up the supervisors. All hands on deck, Cath. Grissom's lead on this. He's the senior supervisor.
Catherine: If it's all hands on deck, what are you doing behind the tape?
Conrad Ecklie: You know if I cross the tape, my name goes on the crime scene log that gets subpoenaed by the defense, and I have to testify.
Catherine: And when was the last time you testified?
Conrad Ecklie: That's not my primary job anymore. I'm an administrator. I run interference for you guys ... starting with the press.
 
Grissom: It's nothing personal, Catherine.  Cases like these rain down hard. You need all the help you can get.
Catherine: I need help, not supervision.


 
Grissom: So, Warrick?
Warrick: Initial observations when we got to the scene.  Obvious impact to the face. Severe facial contusions. Broken nose, cracked teeth. No shoe prints. No tracks. No cast off. No sign of a weapon.
Grissom: We're standing on the weapon.
 
 
 
FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS




 
Reporter: Mr. Eiger had a lot of enemies. Any idea who might have done this?
Conrad Ecklie: I'm not ready to confirm the circumstances under which Mr. Eiger died. I will say that this is the number one priority for the mayor and for all of us in law enforcement.


 
Catherine: So, he either jumped, fell or was pushed.
Warrick: Well, the facial impact is consistent with the blood pool ... but not with the current position.
Grissom: Well, he landed on his face, but it looks like his head got moved.
Nick: And not by the paramedics.  And according to them, he had a broken neck.
Grissom: Well, then he didn't roll himself over.
 
Catherine: Let's talk to the wife.) 


 
Brass: House this big -- where's all the help?
Donna Eiger: Oh, the staff always gets Thursday nights off. I-I-I don't get what the mystery is here. He was murdered. Some guys collect art. Bruce collected enemies.
Brass: I'm more interested in what happened after he died.
Donna Eiger: And what is that supposed to mean?
Brass: Mrs. Eiger, uh, I don't know how to put this ...
Donna Eiger: All right, please, you're making me feel old. Call me Donna.
Brass: Okay, Donna, sure. Your husband's boxer shorts.
Donna Eiger: He wasn't wearing them when he died, was he?
Donna Eiger: Oh, that's what this is all about. No, no, I-I pulled in. I saw Bruce lying there naked. I knew that the news was on its way over here. I didn't want the whole world to see him like that.
Brass: So you moved the body?
Donna Eiger: Yes, yes. I turned him over. I put his shorts on. What, is-is dignity a crime?


 
 

 
 


 
Grissom: Question. You come home, see your husband lying in the driveway. What do you do?
Greg:  Is that a trick question?
Sara: Stop, jump out, run over to him.
Grissom: Or take the time to pull into the garage and park and lock your car?
 


 
Conrad Ecklie: Catherine ... 
 
Conrad Ecklie: Look, it's not that we don't have confidence in you ...
 
Catherine: I smell crap.
Conrad Ecklie: What?
 
Catherine: Don't take another step.
 
Conrad Ecklie: Joe?
Officer Joe: Yeah?
Catherine: The Eigers have any pets?
Officer Joe: No kids, no pets.
Catherine: Okay.
 
Catherine: I saved you from putting your foot in it.
Conrad Ecklie:  I appreciate that.
 
Nick:  Hey, Catherine.
 
Catherine: Yeah?
Nick: I think I found the launch point.
Catherine: I'll be right there.
 

 
 
 
Sara: People who live in houses like these don't get oil leaks.
 
Greg: But their visitors might.
 
Sara: Hasn't absorbed into the stone yet. It's fresh.
Grissom: Well, swab it and then check all their cars just in case.
 
 
 
Nick: Hey. Whatever happened, it happened right here.  Planter could've been broken during the struggle or been used as leverage.
Catherine: Well, if he was pushed, they'd have to be strong enough to get that big boy over the railing.
Warrick: Well, I didn't see any trace on Bruce's hands. I don't think those are his prints.
 
Nick: Well, maybe the killer hung out ...
 
Nick:  ... enjoying the fruits of his labor.
 
 
 
Warrick: Well, I don't see any signs of struggle in this hallway.
Nick: No.
Catherine: The only clue is no clue.
 
 
 
Catherine: The inner sanctum.
Nick: If these walls could talk, huh?
 
Warrick: I wish they would.
Nick: Yeah, no doubt.
 
Catherine: Scotch ... and milk.
 
Nick: Maybe the guy had stomach trouble, you know, ulcers.
Warrick: Well, you get as good as you give.
 
Warrick: Who smokes half a cuban?
 
Nick: Well, whoever was outside might've been in here, too. I've got some greasy handprints, look very similar to the ones on the railing.
Catherine: What are they doing on the floor?


 
Nick: I'll take a sample.

 
 
Robbins: From everything I've heard, this guy was a considerable ass. Speaking of which, from the damage to his sphincter, I'd say he suffered repetitive insertions.
Grissom: Rectal insertions?
Robbins: Sizable. Matching perimortem bruises to the hips. The deceased had a peculiar rash around his genitals slathered in ointment. Doesn't read as an STD I'm familiar with. I swabbed the ointment. I also found a gallon of milky fluid in his stomach. Trace has that, too, along with fecal matter I scraped off his feet. 
 
Robbins: For what it's worth, nicely manicured nails on all but one thumb, which has a groove worn in it.
Grissom: Drugs?
Robbins: Yeah, it could be. His pupils were dilated to the size of pie plates. Tox has the blood.
Grissom: There's a lot behind the curtain of this guy's life.
Sofia Curtis: Cause of death?
Robbins: Asphyxia. Choked on his own blood.
Sofia Curtis: So he survived the fall.
Robbins: Well, it broke his neck, but he continued to breathe a while.
Grissom: Might've lived if he hadn't been rolled.
 

 
 
Grissom: I'm glad you decided to stay, Sofia.
Sofia Curtis: So am I ... for now.
 
Catherine: Thanks for waiting. Got here as fast as I could.
Grissom: We just finished.
Catherine: Grissom, what the hell? Am I going to have any part of this case, or should I just go back to my office and start shuffling some papers?
Sofia Curtis: Catherine, it wasn't personal. The body was posted. We didn't think you'd be back for a few hours. There's the report.
 
Catherine:  So, is this an Ecklie mandate, or is this just your thoughtlessness?
Grissom: Well, look, I apologize, but this is a group effort.
Catherine:  Thanks. I feel much better.
 

 
 
(She looks at her camera, takes out the connecting cord and hooks up her camera to the computer. The message reads:
CARD CONTAINS NO IMAGES

 
Warrick: Okay, just got back from the crime scene. Dropped the samples off at Trace. 
 
Warrick: What's wrong?
Catherine: You didn't touch my camera, did you?
Warrick: No.
Catherine: I have a 256 memory card. This is a 32. Somebody switched it out and took my crime scene photos.
Warrick: What?
 




 
Brass:  Am I being strong-armed by private counsel?

 
Brass: Because, contrary to what you may think, not everybody in Vegas is under the thumb of Bruce Eiger.
James Mandelbaum: Captain Brass, I am simply here representing the interests of Mr. Eiger's estate.
Brass: And those interests would be what?
James Mandelbaum: Well, finding out what happened, certainly. But doing everything within our power to protect Mr. Eiger's private life.
Brass: Protect what? The guy's dead.
James Mandelbaum: Mr. Eiger was a very private person. And although he's no longer with us, his intimates are.
Brass: Look, if this is about him being a sodomite, we already know that.
James Mandelbaum: Excuse me?
Brass: After the case is adjudicated, you can have access to the autopsy reports. In the meantime, let me do my job, okay?


 
Conrad Ecklie: When Eiger was looking into buying the Queen Regent Casino out from under Sy Magli, the Gaming Commission turned him down. So he invited some of the commissioners over to his mansion for a party. A week later, he had his gaming and his liquor licenses. Must've been a hell of a party.
Grissom: Well, if the Wizard of Oz had nude photos of the wicked witch, Dorothy would have never lost her slippers.
Conrad Ecklie: Well, if those files exist, it gives us a list of suspects, but nobody actually knows if he has dirt on everyone, or just wants them to think he does.
 
Greg: Brass subpoenaed Eiger's home phone records in the last year.
Conrad Ecklie: Yeah, anything interesting?
Greg: Numerous calls from Eiger's house to Sy Magli's office.
Conrad Ecklie: Well, they were known business rivals.
Greg: Between midnight and 4:00 a.m.-- What I like to call &quot;love hours.&quot;
Grissom: Wouldn't be the first time that hate mutated into passion.
Greg: Public enemies, private lovers. So Jackie Collins.
 



(Open on the board:
TANYA ROLLINS
&quot;A STAR IS BORN&quot; )
Sy Magli:  Tanya, get your sweet little ass back over to the piano, and we'll talk about it later.
 
Brass: Mr. Magli, Detective Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police. Greg Sanders from the Crime Lab.
Sy Magli: Let me guess. You want to talk to me about Bruce. I hear they're using all the backhoes in hell to dig him a new pit.
Brass: We're, uh, focusing on his life here on earth.
Sy Magli: Well, you know, I thought that b*st*rd would outlive us all.
Brass: When was the last time you saw him?
Sy Magli: At his birthday party.
 
Sy Magli: She's going to be a big star.
 
Sy Magli: Bruce didn't have any friends, so he had to invite his enemies, a real &quot;Who's Who&quot; of Las Vegas. See, Bruce was a shark who circled around for information. And when he found your weakness, he filed it away to be used later.
Greg: His phone records indicate that you spoke more recently than that.
Sy Magli: Oh ... so now you found my weakness.
Brass: What's that?
Sy Magli: I was banging his wife.


 
Catherine: We have a problem.
Grissom: Oh, no, not again.
Catherine: The memory card from my digital camera was stolen and switched with a blank. The only time the camera was out of my possession was at the crime scene.
Grissom: Well, how can that be? It was a secure scene.
Catherine: I don't know. I dusted the camera and the card. There weren't any prints. All of the crime scene photos of the body and the blood evidence were on that card.
 
Grissom: We do have a problem.
Conrad Ecklie: Yes, we do.
 
Grissom: Get back to the crime scene, Catherine. Get what you can.
Catherine: Well, I know that the scene's been released.
Grissom: Well, go quickly.
Catherine: Okay.
 


 
David Hodges: Ready?
Nick: Yeah.
David Hodges: The baddest ass in Vegas had diaper rash. The sample that Doc Robbins collected from between his legs at autopsy: Brenner's ointment, used expressly for that purpose.
Nick: Okay. What about the handprints from the railing and the floor in study?
David Hodges: Same deal. 
Nick: I compared the hand size, and, uh, the prints aren't Eiger's, man.
David Hodges: Hmm?
Nick: No. Which means that ...
David Hodges:  You couldn't pay me enough to rub ointment on some old guy's butt rash.
Nick:  Well, maybe some people aren't as discerning as you are. How does a grown man get diaper rash?
David Hodges: I'll take incontinence for $200, Alex.
Nick: Maybe he had gastrointestinal issues.
David Hodges: And the stomach contents. All milk. You get any Tox back?
Nick: Yeah. No drugs in his bloodstream.
David Hodges: Really?
Nick: He had dilated pupils, and he was a sick guy, but ... no medications.


 
 
Catherine: Mrs. Eiger! Mrs. Eiger, please stop.
 
Donna Eiger: Please stop? What, am I supposed to look at his blood? Do I need this?
 
Catherine: I need to take additional photos of the crime scene. If you could just put the hose aside and ...

 
Donna Eiger: 
Oh, Sy. You know what? Don't bother. You don't have to lie to me. I get it. I really, I really do. No, he's dead and you're leaving. Yeah, well, maybe I just thought that I was more than just a hate lay.
 
Catherine: Uh, men just don't appreciate us.
Donna Eiger: It's never enough.  When you put up with things that nobody else would and he stills wants more. I mean, just how low are we supposed to sink?
Catherine: You know, I think you're better off without him, anyway.
Donna Eiger: What's your name?
Catherine: Catherine.
Donna Eiger: You know, Catherine, this whole, um, sisterhood thing that you're trying to get going here, it's just really not working for me. You can't con a con, sweetie.
 




 
Catherine:  Sara and Greg went through these cans last night. They were empty.


 
Warrick: Well, it looks like Mrs. Eiger's been a little busy.
Catherine: Evidently.

 
Catherine: Uh, Warrick?
Warrick: Yeah.
 
Warrick: Is that a diaper?
Catherine: Mm-hmm.
Warrick: Those safety pins, they could match the bruises that we found on Mr. Eiger's hips. That accounts for that blood.
Catherine: Well, we can probably get DNA from the blood. But to confirm that Eiger actually wore this thing, Mia's going to have to test the urine inside. Lucky girl.
Warrick: Lucky her.
 
 
Catherine: Do you think Donna always takes her laundry to the city dump?
Warrick: I've got handprints and feces on carpet. He wasn't just incontinent, he was a ... 
Catherine: ... a freak.
 
Warrick: That's disgusting.
 
Warrick: Look at these indentations. I think they could have been a desk or something.
Catherine: Were gonna have to take this back to the house and look at it in its original context.


 
Friend #1: Is that even legal? Why are they ... 
Warrick: Take it straight up.
 
Friend #1: Why are you guys doing this? Hasn't she been through enough?  She's gonna sue you people! How about that?


 
Grissom: How do you explain a handprint half covered by a wall?
Catherine: I mean, we're not even certain this rug came from this room.
Warrick: Well, I was gonna say the same thing, but the rug has eight divots that line up perfectly with that desk.
Grissom: Think outside the rug.
 
Catherine: A man with secrets needs a place to hide them.
 

 
Warrick: Get the hell out of here.
 
Warrick: Nice.



 
 
Catherine: Wow. Just when you thought you'd seen it all.
Warrick: People lived in fear of this guy?
Grissom: Imagine the fear he lived with.

Warrick: A very powerful and paranoid man with a secret this big? It'd probably kill him if anyone found out.
Grissom: I think it did kill him.
Catherine: So we're back to suicide?
Grissom: Well, let's collect for now. We'll, uh, theorize later.
 
Nick: Whoa. Who's your mommy? The true inner sanctum.
 
 
Nick: Hey, maybe we're looking for the hand that rocks the cradle.
Catherine: I think that Bruce just wanted the same thing as every other guy.
Grissom: Nurturing?
Catherine: Easy access.
 
 
Grissom: Well ...  ... this could explain the repeated insertions.
 
 
Warrick: I think this was originally used as a panic room. Eiger's got a massive security system here, motion and site sensitive. No video, though.
Catherine: Well, I guess we won't get to see who swaddled him.
 
Warrick: Well ... there is a hard drive. I'll get it back to the lab.
 
Nick: I just don't get it, man.
Grissom: What, you never had a transitional object when you were a kid? A stuffed animal or a blanket?
Nick: No. I mean, I had a wooby, but who didn't?
 
Warrick: Oh, is that that blue thing that's in your locker?
Nick:  Don't even.
Grissom: Seventy percent of children have something. Helps them with separation anxiety. 
 
Grissom: Maybe Bruce Eiger never got over his.
Warrick: I got a question. Where would you buy something like this? I mean, this crib and this rocking horse isn't exactly, uh, regulation size. 
 
Grissom:  Forever Baby. For the child in all of us.
 
Catherine: Do you think they do takeout?

 
 
Mia Dickerson: Hey.
Catherine: Oh, hey.
Mia Dickerson: You asked me to check the blood and urine from the diaper.
Catherine: Yeah.
Mia Dickerson: Yeah, the blood is a match for Eiger, and the urine had high levels of testosterone, which is indicative of an adult.
Catherine: It's a safe assumption that it's his.
 
Mia Dickerson: Yeah. You know, one other thing. When I was running the urine, I found another spike that I couldn't identify. So I sent it on to Tox.
Catherine: Well, I know that his blood work came back clean.
Mia Dickerson: Some drugs metabolize quickly, so what doesn't show up in the blood, shows up in the urine.
 
Greg: Catherine?
Catherine: Yeah?
Greg: You gotta see the TV.


 
Newscaster:  The photos you're about to see are the latest evidence in the strange death of casino mogul Bruce Eiger. 
 
Newscaster:  We want to warn you these are graphic images of a bloody crime scene. In them, Mr. Eiger can been seen lying in a pool of his own blood in the driveway ...
Catherine: Those are mine.
Conrad Ecklie:  I'll have our public information officer contact his counterpart at the station. We'll also call Judge Anderson and get a warrant for the memory card, any copies, and the name of their source.
 
Newscaster:  ... Top Las Vegas gaming mogul left him with more than his share of adversaries.
Catherine: Thank you, Conrad.
Conrad Ecklie: It's my job.
Newscaster:  ... However, there are still no apparent leads.



 
Madge: Howdy.
Grissom: Well, howdy. I was wondering, do you carry adult diapers?
Madge: Oh, we sure do.  What are you, about a 34, 36?
 
Grissom: Well, they're not for me.
Madge: Oh.  Well, aren't you lucky to have such a nice daddy?
 
Nick: I'm going to have a look around.
 
Madge: Mommy-shopping?
Grissom: Sort of. I was wondering, in your line of work, do you ever wear a uniform or a dress?
Madge: No, but I could. Are you a drinker or a stinker?
Grissom: Excuse me?
Madge: Well, a drinker likes to ...  
Grissom: I get it.
Madge: Yeah.
 
Grissom: We're actually with the Crime Lab. We're investigating the death of Bruce Eiger.
Madge: Bruce Eiger. 
 
 
Madge: Are you with Vice? Because nothing here is illegal. It's simply nurturing. Mommy and adult baby playit's not erotic.
Grissom: Well, Freud had a somewhat different theory, but ...
Madge: Well, I could take you to my playpen.
 
Grissom: You know, I don't think the department would let me expense it.
 
Madge: Okay, then, I'll just cut to the short version. Some guys can never love any woman but their mother. And some never had a mother who loved them.
 

 
 

SHORT TIME LAPSE:
 

 
 
Catherine: Is Foxy short for anything?
Foxy Harris: No, no, it's just Foxy Harris. That's what's on my birth certificate. I signed an exclusive nondisclosure agreement with K-R-A-C. Whoever gave you my name is the one who broke the law.
Brass: It's funny what people will say when there's a warrant in their face.
Catherine: Yeah, your friends at KRAC take obstruction of justice seriously. You stole police department evidence in a homicide investigation. You're guilty of theft and possession of stolen property.
Brass: And we're looking at you for murder.
Foxy Harris: I shoot pictures, not people.
Brass: Right. You're a journalist. So, what were you doing at the Eiger house that night?
Foxy Harris: Okay, so K-R-A-C isn't my only employer. I do discreet work for Sy Magli.
 
 
Brass: All right, let me get this straight. Sy Magli hired you to take pictures of him sleeping with Donna Eiger?
Foxy Harris: That's right.
Catherine: Why would he do that?
Foxy Harris: Eiger had dirt on everyone. Nobody obsessed with secrets doesn't have some of his own. Magli asked me to find Eiger's, but, well, I couldn't find any.
Catherine: So in the absence of scandal, Magli created some.
Brass: By sleeping with Bruce Eiger's wife.
Foxy Harris: Brilliant.
Brass: You know, there were cops everywhere. Whose palm did you grease?
Foxy Harris: I didn't need to.  Donna showed Magli, who showed me all the secret ways onto the property.
 
Foxy Harris: You really should train your people better. All it took was a dark jacket, a baseball cap, and a camera. No questions asked. 


 
Mia Dickerson: So here's the thing. The milk in the bottles was not bovine. It was human breast milk.
Warrick: Human?
Mia Dickerson: Mm-hmm.
Warrick: All of it?
Mia Dickerson: Yeah.
Warrick: Well, it definitely wasn't the wife's.
 
Mia Dickerson: No, the widow Eiger's DNA was not a match. However, whoever pumped all that milk also wore this.
 
Mia Dickerson: The epithelials were a match.
Warrick: So we're looking for one very tired milkmaid.

 
 
Nick: This is the same toy box they sell at Forever Baby, except the one in the store was twice as big on the inside. SARA: Well, he did like his secret spaces.
Nick: Yep.
 
Nick: All right.
 
Nick: Whoa.
 
Nick: Bingo.
 
Nick: &quot;Sy Magli ... Sam Braun ... Rory Atwater&quot;?
Sara: Sheriff Rory Atwater?
Nick: Looks like it. Along with some gaming commissioners, judges, pro athletes.

 
Sara: No name. Just a date -- 12-20-01.
 
Nick: Well, apparently, Sy liked the spectrum -- 


 
Warrick: I downloaded the log from the Eigers' security system hard drive. All of the perimeter doors and windows in the Eiger mansion are protected. If one of them is opened, it's logged into the security system.
Greg: According to Mrs. Eiger's verified alibi, she left for the club around
7:15.
Warrick: Okay. Garage door opens, 7:18. Got it.
Greg: Dispatch received her 911 call at 11:42. So we're concerned with the four hours in between.
Warrick: 8:00, the front door opens. It was probably the milkmaid.
Greg: 10:09, the third floor balcony doors were opened.

 
Greg: Bye-bye, Bruce.
Warrick: Now four minutes later, the front door opens again.
Greg: Milkmaid exits?
 
 
Warrick: 17 minutes later, at 10:30, the garage door opens. I guess that was Mrs. Eiger.
 
 
Warrick: But then a minute later, at 10:31, the front door opens again.
Greg: She didn't make her call to 911 until 11:42. What was she doing for over an hour?

 
 
Grissom: Count Basie said that it's the notes you don't hear that matter.
Catherine: Two voids ... one pointing towards 11:00, one towards 1:00.
Grissom: Something blocked the spray.
Catherine: Something in a size eight.
Grissom: Could that be explained by her rendering aid?
Catherine: I don't think so. It's a fine mist. A spatter.  I think he was still alive, expirating blood.
 
 
Catherine: I wonder what was going through her mind when she stood there and watched him die?
Grissom: I wonder what was going through his?
 




 
 
Donna Eiger: Fine. I was, uh, playing canasta at the club, like I do every Thursday night. I come home. I pull into the driveway, and-and there he was.
 
 
Brass: You administer any help?
Donna Eiger: Uh, more like encouragement.


 
Donna: Oh, dear. What happened to Mummy's widdle baby? Did Brucey fall down and go boom?
 
Brass: So you're admitting responsibility in the death of your husband?
James Mandelbaum: No. Mrs. Eiger is not a health care professional. She merely delayed in calling for help.
Grissom: She watched him die.
Donna Eiger: He had a broken neck. If he'd lived, he would've been a quadriplegic.
Brass: So it was a mercy killing?
James Mandelbaum: It wasn't a killing at all.
 
Grissom: You would've had to take care of him.
Donna Eiger: Oh, bathe him, feed him, change his diapers. 
Freakin' gift from God to him. See the thing was, I-I just didn't want Bruce to have the satisfaction of being helpless for the rest of his life. Do you know what the last words I said to him were?  You lose.
Brass: So I take it that you weren't his, uh, his mommy?
Donna Eiger: Look-- love, honor, cherish. Diapering was never on the list.
Grissom: How'd you deal with it?
Donna Eiger: Oh, I didn't. Look, I'm sorry, but ... you can't have s*x with a man after you've seen him ... after you've seen him behave like that. So in order to save our marriage, we had, uh, an arrangement. On Thursday nights, I go to the club with my friends. He hires a baby-sitter.
Brass: We have reason to believe it was the same baby-sitter every week. Any idea who that is?
Donna Eiger:  No, women in my position have been looking the other way for years. I just had... something a little stranger to look away from.
Brass: Why didn't you leave him?
Donna Eiger: Nobody leaves Bruce.
Brass: Well, maybe you had to get Bruce to leave you. You push him off the balcony?
Donna Eiger: No. He'd already fallen when I found him. I turned him over. I watched him die.
 
Donna Eiger:  I got rid of the diaper.
 
Donna Eiger:  I rolled up the carpet.
 
Donna Eiger:  I changed my clothes.
 
 
Donna Eiger: Then I called 911. And I should've left him in the damn diaper. I don't know what I was protecting.
Brass: Your reputation.
James Mandelbaum: Donna may be an opportunist, but she is not a murderer. And since neither of us believe that Bruce was suicidal ...
Grissom: You're both psychiatrists?
Donna Eiger: Look, my husband did not commit suicide. So why don't you just find the guy who did, and I will write him a big, fat check.


 
Catherine: That drug spike that Mia detected in Bruce's diaper -- &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds...&quot; L-S-D. But I don't get it, because acid trips last for hours. Why wouldn't it have shown up in his bloodstream?
Grissom: LSD is in and out of your system in twenty minutes. But it acts as a trigger, which sets off cascading reactions in the brain.
 
Grissom:  The brain keeps cascading long after the drug is gone.
 
 
Catherine: Well, there are good trips, and bad trips, and trips right off the balcony.
Grissom: Strange drug of choice for a control freak.
Catherine: Maybe not his choice.


 
Sofia Curtis: So we're looking for a lactating female with a center whorl print.
Sara: We recovered two sets of prints from the baby paraphernalia. His and ... presumably hers.
 
Sofia Curtis: We've excluded Mrs. Eiger. How long can a woman lactate after giving birth?
Sara: I had a professor in college, her six-year-old used to come in for lunch. I guess they'll go as long as you let them.
Sofia Curtis: What, the boobs or the kids? That's a two-legged topless buffet.
 Ugh.
Sara: I'm thinking, you know, if you commit to something every Thursday night, you got to be getting something good out of it. We found oil drops on the driveway. None of the Eiger cars had leaks. I ran it through Trace. It was an AGIP ... Sint 2000. It's a synthetic motor oil.
Sofia Curtis: A synthetic would make it high end.
Sara: That particular oil is only used for Lamborghinis. How many lactating women are driving one of those?
Sofia Curtis: So he either paid well or was a good gift giver.
Sara: Maybe we're looking for a cash cow.
Sofia Curtis: With liquid assets.


 
 
David Hodges: I had the distinct pleasure of testing all the modes of ingestion from the nursery. Most people take acid on their tongue. Bruce ...
 
Catherine: An enema.
David Hodges: And people call me a**l. 
Grissom: Well, the whole point of having a &quot;mommy&quot; is to have her do these things for you.
Catherine: So the acid was no doubt supplied by the same sweet thing who gave him breast milk from that ... boobs-ahoy dress.



 
Brass: So, that new Lamborghini is a pretty smooth ride. Grant from the dealership told me you bought one recently.
Sy Magli: It was a gift.
Brass: For who?
Sy Magli: Tanya Rollins. You got to woo the talent.
 
Brass: Yeah, she's cute. How old is she?
Sy Magli: Twenty-four.
Brass: So, you been together nine years -- that'll make her about fifteen when you consummated the relationship. Don't you know that fifteen will get you twenty?
Sy Magli: What do you want?
Brass: Why was Tanya's Lamborghini parked in Bruce Eiger's driveway?
Sy Magli: They were involved.
Brass: I thought she was your girl.
Sy Magli: Tanya always goes where the best deal is. I &quot;rolled&quot; her, Bruce bankrolled her. Her career-- smart move. Turned out she actually had other talents. She was making him a ton of money, so I gave her a call.
Brass: You poached her.
Sy Magli: Ah, come on, look, she jumped at it, all right? Tanya said he was a freak and she wanted out.
Brass: Then what? 'Cause I got felony s*x, infidelities and a picture of a baby I don't know anything about.
Sy Magli: Come on, we both know what I was after.
Brass: So, all's well that ends well, huh, Sy?
Sy Magli: I didn't want him dead. There's no sport in humiliating a dead man. Now, if you' excuse me, captain.
 
 

 
 
Catherine: Your fingerprints are all over the nursery. The DNA that we took from your breast pump matches the milk from Bruce's fridge. And the arresting officer confiscated LSD from your purse.
 
Brass: And your cell phone is full of pictures of &quot;Baby Bruce.&quot;
Tanya Rollins: Sy said all that Bruce had was fear.
Brass: Yeah, there's really not much to fear about a crying man in a diaper.
 
Tanya Rollins: All right, Baby Bruce. Playtime's over.
 
Tanya Rollins: I smell a smelly. 
 
Tanya Rollins: You made a big messy in your diaper. 
 
Tanya Rollins: You ready?
 
Tanya Rollins: There you go. That feels so good.
Tanya Rollins: Mommy's got a special treat for you. It's extra special today.
 
 
Tanya Rollins:  ... Wonder what you are ... 
 
Tanya Rollins: ... and then, he just started acting crazy.
Brass: As opposed to soiling himself and gumming your nipples?
Tanya Rollins: Yes.
 
Tanya Rollins: What is it with you, Brucie?
 
Tanya Rollins: What are you doing? What is wrong?
 
Tanya Rollins: Wait, that's a bad boy.
 
 

Bruce Eiger: The light. I see the light ... I see ...
 
Tanya Rollins: What is it with you, Bruce?
 
Tanya Rollins: What's wrong?

 
Tanya Rollins: And then, he just ... jumped off the balcony.
Brass: That's it?
Catherine: You knew this man's most intimate secret. You could've left him.
Tanya Rollins: Nobody leaves Bruce.
Catherine: What were you afraid of?
Tanya Rollins: That I'd never see my baby again. Bruce said that he wanted a baby. That he'd take care of both of us.
Catherine: And you believed him?
Tanya Rollins:  He explained to me, you know, about infantilism. Said that it was in the bible. And then he made me clean him.
Brass: How long ago was that?
Tanya Rollins: Five years. Five years and every week, I would ask him if I could see my baby and he kept saying, &quot;next week&quot;. &quot;Sure, Tanya, next week.&quot;
&quot;No, maybe next week.&quot; You know, &quot;maybe the next week after that.&quot;  I guess in my heart I knew that it was never going to happen. It's just that ... that was the only connection I had to my baby, you know? That and nursing Bruce.
Catherine: Tanya, this man exploited you for five years. He didn't allow you to see your only child and ... there he was, high as a kite and you're the only one there. Are you saying that you didn't offer him any encouragement off that balcony?
Tanya Rollins: If I told you to jump off a bridge would you do it?
 
Tanya Rollins: Fly, Brucie, fly. Show Mommy how you can fly like a birdie!
Tanya Rollins: Come on, you can fly!
Bruce Eiger: I can fly.
Tanya Rollins: You can fly! 
Bruce Eiger: I can fly, Mommy. I can fly, Mommy.
Tanya Rollins: You can fly!
Bruce Eiger: I can fly.
 
Tanya Rollins: You can fly, you can fly.
Bruce Eiger: I can fly, Mommy.
Tanya Rollins: You can fly!
Bruce Eiger: I can fly! I can fly!






 
Brass: Do you recognize this infant?
Mrs. Eiger: No. I've never seen that baby before in my life.
Brass: Well, Bruce said he gave you his lover's baby to raise. The mother's name was Tanya.
Mrs. Eiger: Do I look like I could raise a baby?
Brass: When was the last time you saw your son, Mrs. Eiger?
Mrs. Eiger: Seven years ago.
Brass: You didn't know he had kids?
Mrs. Eiger: Do you know what my mother told me when I had Bruce?
Brass: What's that?
Mrs. Eiger: &quot;Suckle the baby, cuckold the man&quot;.
Brass: I don't follow.
Mrs. Eiger: You were breast-fed.
Brass: Yeah. 
Mrs. Eiger: My mother was a firm believer that the way you raised a boy was to make him hard. To let him know what the world was like right out of the womb.
Brass: And what's the world like?
Mrs. Eiger: No free lunch. All these mothers coddling their toddlers. Look where we are.
Brass: Yeah, look where we are.


Grissom:  I've enjoyed working with you.
 
 
Catherine: Which part? The part where I got in your face or the part where I, uh, lost evidence, or uh, maybe you just miss me.
Grissom: I did miss you. I missed your passion and your tenacity. I even missed your tush.
 
Catherine: Really. Thank you.
 
Brass: Sorry to interrupt. I miss the punch line?
Catherine: Yeah.
 
Brass: So Bruce lied about the kid. There was an out-of-state adoption that placed the day the kid was born. 
Waitress: Anything to drink, sir? 
Brass: And Bruce's mother ...  His mother was a piece of work.
Catherine: So, is Tanya going to take the fall?
Grissom: Can't convict her for cheerleading.
Brass: You can if there's LSD in her pom-poms. Acid makes her culpable. Class A felony.
Catherine: Any more culpable than his wife, who just let him lie there?
Brass: You know, what I can't get my mind wrapped around is, uh, you got a guy who's tough enough to get to the top of the heap in Vegas, all this power, and he ends up crawling around a playpen.
Grissom: That's the point, isn't it? It's only the truly powerful that have the luxury to relinquish power.
Catherine: But diapers?
Grissom: Why not? Where would you go if you had the connections and the cash to go anywhere you wanted?
Brass: I hear Fiji's nice.
Grissom: Eiger went further. He went all the way back to his childhood.
Brass: Yeah. I think I'd take Fiji.

							<p>DUE TO MATURE THEME, VIEWER DISCRETION IS ADVISED.</p>
<p>FLASH IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. EIGER RESIDENCE - FRONT DRIVE (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Camera starts on the gate fronting the driveway. It slowly rises up over the gate to the large mansion beyond.)</p>
<p>FLASHES OF:</p>
<p>[INT. EIGER RESIDENCE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[EXT. EIGER RESIDENCE - BALCONY DOORS - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Camera slowly moves in toward the closed balcony doors. The curtains are drawn, the light inside is on.) </p>
<p>(We quicken the pace and zoom in to the balcony doors ... )</p>
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[INT. EIGER RESIDENCE - FOYER / MAIN HALL - NIGHT]</p>
<p>( ... and into the quiet foyer. We linger for a moment.)</p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
(From the foyer, the camera slowly follows the stairs up to the second floor. The camera rises up to the second floor.) </p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
[INT. EIGER RESIDENCE - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Slow motion. We see the lower half of a man running barefoot through the hallway.)</p>
<p>(The man is crying, a look of sadness on his face.) </p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO: </p>
<p>[EXT. EIGER RESIDENCE - FRONT STEPS - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CU: Bruce Eiger's dead body is on the front steps, his head is bloodied. Off his body we see the reflection of red flashing lights of emergency vehicles.) </p>
<p><strong>Laurel Tessler (newswoman)</strong>: (V.O.) This is the scene in seven hills, where casino mogul Bruce Eiger has been found dead on the grounds of his palatial estate.</p>
<p>(A camera snaps. Catherine snaps photos as Warrick shines his flashlight on the body.) </p>
<p><strong>Laurel Tessler (newswoman)</strong>: (V.O.) Eiger turned sixty earlier this year, ... </p>
<p>(Beyond Catherine, a small crowd has gathered on the driveway.) </p>
<p><strong>Laurel Tessler (newswoman)</strong>: (V.O.) ... throwing himself a half-a-million-dollar birthday party at his newly renovated Queen Regent Casino.</p>
<p>(Laurel Tessler reports from the crime scene. Other reporters take notes. In the background, we hear a siren blurb on and off as the crowd parts for another dark-colored vehicle driving through.)</p>
<p><strong>Laurel Tessler (newswoman)</strong>: (V.O.) Cause of death remains unknown, but as Eiger himself famously joked: In Vegas, if nobody wants you dead, you're not working hard enough. Reporting live from Seven Hills, I'm Laurel Tessler.</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: Thanks Ginny. In this exclusive community ...</p>
<p>(Conrad Ecklie exits the vehicle.) </p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: What's the 4-1-1?</p>
<p>(He and Grissom walk up to Brass. They all head toward the body as he fills them in.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Wife comes home from canasta at the club, finds hubby dead in the driveway, calls 9-1-1. No sign of forced entry. The alarm was off. Nothing seems to be missing.</p>
<p>(Grissom ducks under the crime scene tape. Ecklie remains behind.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Welcome to the party.</p>
<p>(Catherine looks up and sees Grissom approaching.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What's going on? This is my scene.</p>
<p>(Grissom puts his kit down and opens it. Ecklie answers her. She turns toward Ecklie.) </p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: High profile case -- woke up the supervisors. All hands on deck, Cath. Grissom's lead on this. He's the senior supervisor.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: If it's all hands on deck, what are you doing behind the tape?</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: You know if I cross the tape, my name goes on the crime scene log that gets subpoenaed by the defense, and I have to testify.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And when was the last time you testified?</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: That's not my primary job anymore. I'm an administrator. I run interference for you guys ... starting with the press.</p>
<p>(Ecklie turns around to deal with the press. Catherine walks back to the body. She passes Grissom as he closes his kit and stands up.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's nothing personal, Catherine. (Catherine turns around to look at Grissom.) Cases like these rain down hard. You need all the help you can get.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I need help, not supervision.</p>
<p>(Grissom doesn't say anything. He nods at the body.)</p>
<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO: </p>
<p>(Grissom and Catherine stand near the body. Warrick kneels down next to the body.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So, Warrick?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Initial observations when we got to the scene. (Grissom turns around and looks up at the balcony.) Obvious impact to the face. Severe facial contusions. Broken nose, cracked teeth. No shoe prints. No tracks. No cast off. No sign of a weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We're standing on the weapon.</p>
<p>(Warrick looks up.) </p>
<p>(They all see: Virtual Bruce Eiger falling off the balcony and onto the driveway pavement.) </p>
<p>(Grissom looks down at the body and nods.) </p>
<p>FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>[EXT. EIGER RESIDENCE - FRONT DRIVE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Conrad Ecklie faces the group of reporters.) </p>
<p><strong>Reporter</strong>: Mr. Eiger had a lot of enemies. Any idea who might have done this?</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: I'm not ready to confirm the circumstances under which Mr. Eiger died. I will say that this is the number one priority for the mayor and for all of us in law enforcement.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. EIGER RESIDENCE - FRONT STEPS - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Catherine, Grissom and Warrick look at the body. Nick stands in the background.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, he either jumped, fell or was pushed.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, the facial impact is consistent with the blood pool ... but not with the current position.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, he landed on his face, but it looks like his head got moved.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: And not by the paramedics. (Grissom turns around to look at Nick.) And according to them, he had a broken neck.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, then he didn't roll himself over.</p>
<p>(Catherine looks at the body on the ground, then looks at the front door where Donna Eiger is talking with an officer.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Let's talk to the wife.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. EIGER RESIDENCE - MAIN HALL / FOYER - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Brass talks with Donna Eiger.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: House this big -- where's all the help?</p>
<p><strong>Donna Eiger</strong>: Oh, the staff always gets Thursday nights off. I-I-I don't get what the mystery is here. He was murdered. Some guys collect art. Bruce collected enemies.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'm more interested in what happened after he died.</p>
<p><strong>Donna Eiger</strong>: And what is that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Mrs. Eiger, uh, I don't know how to put this ...</p>
<p><strong>Donna Eiger</strong>: All right, please, you're making me feel old. Call me Donna.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Okay, Donna, sure. Your husband's boxer shorts.</p>
<p><strong>Donna Eiger</strong>: He wasn't wearing them when he died, was he?</p>
<p><strong>Donna Eiger</strong>: Oh, that's what this is all about. No, no, I-I pulled in. I saw Bruce lying there naked. I knew that the news was on its way over here. I didn't want the whole world to see him like that.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So you moved the body?</p>
<p><strong>Donna Eiger</strong>: Yes, yes. I turned him over. I put his shorts on. What, is-is dignity a crime?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. EIGER RESIDENCE - GARAGE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Grissom opens the garage door. He flicks the light switch on. Inside the garage are five cars.) </p>
<p>(He walks down the short stairs and over to the first car. He puts his hand on the hood, feeling it.) </p>
<p>(He looks at the Nevada plates of the second car: 4MYDONNA. He puts his hand flat on the hood.)</p>
<p>(Grissom goes to the car and tries the driver's side door. It's locked.) </p>
<p>(He looks around.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. EIGER RESIDENCE - GARAGE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The garage door opens. Sara and Greg walk up to Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Question. You come home, see your husband lying in the driveway. What do you do?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (shrugs) Is that a trick question?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Stop, jump out, run over to him.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Or take the time to pull into the garage and park and lock your car?</p>
<p>(Sara turns and looks at Greg. He shrugs at her.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. EIGER RESIDENCE - FRONT STEPS - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Catherine stands on the front steps and looks around. Conrad Ecklie walks up to her and stops at the crime scene tape.) </p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Catherine ... </p>
<p>(Catherine looks at Ecklie, then continues to look on the ground for evidence.) </p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Look, it's not that we don't have confidence in you ...</p>
<p>(Catherine takes a deep breath.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I smell crap.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: What?</p>
<p>(Catherine sees something.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Don't take another step.</p>
<p>(She shines the light down on the concrete right in front of Ecklie's shoes.) </p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Joe?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Joe</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The Eigers have any pets?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Joe</strong>: No kids, no pets.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(Catherine kneels down and snaps a photo of the crap and slips it into an envelope.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I saved you from putting your foot in it.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: (nods) I appreciate that.</p>
<p>(Ecklie turns and leaves.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (o.s.) Hey, Catherine.</p>
<p>(Catherine turns and looks up. Nick is standing on the balcony.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I think I found the launch point.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'll be right there.</p>
<p>(Catherine goes back to her kit. She puts her camera down on the bag and heads upstairs.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. EIGER RESIDENCE - DRIVEWAY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Sara finds an oil spot on the driveway. Grissom stands nearby writing on a clipboard.) </p>
<p>(Sara kneels down in front of the oil spot.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: People who live in houses like these don't get oil leaks.</p>
<p>(Greg kneels down near Sara.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: But their visitors might.</p>
<p>(She touches it and looks at the stain on her fingers.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hasn't absorbed into the stone yet. It's fresh.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, swab it and then check all their cars just in case.</p>
<p>[EXT. EIGER RESIDENCE (STOCK) -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>[INT. EIGER RESIDENCE - SECOND STORY BALCONY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Catherine walks up to Nick who is examining the second story balcony.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey. Whatever happened, it happened right here. (Warrick walks up to him to look at the planter.) Planter could've been broken during the struggle or been used as leverage.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, if he was pushed, they'd have to be strong enough to get that big boy over the railing.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, I didn't see any trace on Bruce's hands. I don't think those are his prints.</p>
<p>(Warrick looks at the handprints on the concrete railing.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, maybe the killer hung out ...</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: [BALCONY - NIGHT] The killer stands near the balcony looking over the edge, his hands flat on the concrete railing.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (V.O.) ... enjoying the fruits of his labor.</p>
<p>(End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p>[INT. EIGER RESIDENCE - SECOND STORY HALLWAY - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(Catherine, Nick and Warrick walk back into the house through the hallway.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, I don't see any signs of struggle in this hallway.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The only clue is no clue.</p>
<p>(They walk into the room at the end of the hallway.) </p>
<p>[INT. EIGER RESIDENCE - STUDY - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(They look around the study.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The inner sanctum.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: If these walls could talk, huh?</p>
<p>(Catherine sees a glass on the desk.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I wish they would.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, no doubt.</p>
<p>(She walks over to the glass and sniffs it.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Scotch ... and milk.</p>
<p>(They look around the study.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Maybe the guy had stomach trouble, you know, ulcers.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, you get as good as you give.</p>
<p>(Warrick picks up the cigar in the ashtray and smells it.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Who smokes half a cuban?</p>
<p>(Nick finds a couple of handprints on the wooden floor.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, whoever was outside might've been in here, too. I've got some greasy handprints, look very similar to the ones on the railing.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What are they doing on the floor?</p>
<p>(Quick flashes of: [STUDY - NIGHT] The cigar is burning in the ashtray. Bruce Eiger takes a sip of his drink. He exhales a long stream of smoke into the air.)</p>
<p>(Suddenly, someone bursts into the study, startling him. There's a struggle. The killer falls to the ground, his palms flat on the floor.)</p>
<p>(End of flashes. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I'll take a sample.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Robbins goes over the preliminary with Grissom and Sofia Curtis.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: From everything I've heard, this guy was a considerable ass. Speaking of which, from the damage to his sphincter, I'd say he suffered repetitive insertions.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Rectal insertions?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Sizable. Matching perimortem bruises to the hips. The deceased had a peculiar rash around his genitals slathered in ointment. Doesn't read as an STD I'm familiar with. I swabbed the ointment. I also found a gallon of milky fluid in his stomach. Trace has that, too, along with fecal matter I scraped off his feet. </p>
<p>(Robbins grabs the victim's hands.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: For what it's worth, nicely manicured nails on all but one thumb, which has a groove worn in it.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Drugs?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Yeah, it could be. His pupils were dilated to the size of pie plates. Tox has the blood.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: There's a lot behind the curtain of this guy's life.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Cause of death?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Asphyxia. Choked on his own blood.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: So he survived the fall.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Well, it broke his neck, but he continued to breathe a while.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Might've lived if he hadn't been rolled.</p>
<p>(Grissom glances at Sofia.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY OUTSIDE FORENSIC AUTOPSY - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(Grissom steps out into the hallway. He's looking at his glasses. Sofia steps out into the hallway after Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm glad you decided to stay, Sofia.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: So am I ... for now.</p>
<p>(Catherine walks into the hallway.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Thanks for waiting. Got here as fast as I could.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We just finished.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Grissom, what the hell? Am I going to have any part of this case, or should I just go back to my office and start shuffling some papers?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Catherine, it wasn't personal. The body was posted. We didn't think you'd be back for a few hours. There's the report.</p>
<p>(Sofia hands the report to Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to Sofia) Stay out of this. (Sofia leaves.) (to Grissom) So, is this an Ecklie mandate, or is this just your thoughtlessness?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, look, I apologize, but this is a group effort.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (scoffs) Thanks. I feel much better.</p>
<p>(Catherine turns and leaves.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - CATHERINE'S OFFICE - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(Catherine walks into her office and shuts the door behind her. She tosses the report on her desk along with her watch. She sits down in her chair.) </p>
<p>(She looks at her camera, takes out the connecting cord and hooks up her camera to the computer. The message reads:<br />
CARD CONTAINS NO IMAGES</p>
<p>(Catherine checks the memory card in the camera. It's an SG1 32 MB card. This isn't good.)</p>
<p>(The office door opens.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Okay, just got back from the crime scene. Dropped the samples off at Trace. </p>
<p>(Catherine looks at Warrick.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What's wrong?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You didn't touch my camera, did you?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I have a 256 memory card. This is a 32. Somebody switched it out and took my crime scene photos.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What?</p>
<p>(Catherine closes her eyes and sighs heavily. She puts a hand to her head and grimaces. No, this is definitely not good.) </p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) -- DAY] </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (V.O.) Am I being strong-armed by private counsel?</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - BRASS' OFFICE - DAY]</p>
<p>(Brass is talking with Bruce Eigler's attorney, James Mandelbaum.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Because, contrary to what you may think, not everybody in Vegas is under the thumb of Bruce Eiger.</p>
<p><strong>James Mandelbaum</strong>: Captain Brass, I am simply here representing the interests of Mr. Eiger's estate.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: And those interests would be what?</p>

So he invited some of the commissioners over to his mansion for a party. A week later, he had his gaming and his liquor licenses. Must've been a hell of a party.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, if the Wizard of Oz had nude photos of the wicked witch, Dorothy would have never lost her slippers.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Well, if those files exist, it gives us a list of suspects, but nobody actually knows if he has dirt on everyone, or just wants them to think he does.</p>

<p><strong>Sy Magli</strong>: She's going to be a big star.</p>
<p>(He watches her sing for a moment.) </p>
<p><strong>Sy Magli</strong>: Bruce didn't have any friends, so he had to invite his enemies, a real &quot;Who's Who&quot; of Las Vegas. See, Bruce was a shark who circled around for information. And when he found your weakness, he filed it away to be used later.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: His phone records indicate that you spoke more recently than that.</p>

<p><strong>Greg</strong>: According to Mrs. Eiger's verified alibi, she left for the club around<br />
7:15.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Okay. Garage door opens, 7:18. Got it.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Dispatch received her 911 call at 11:42. So we're concerned with the four hours in between.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: 8:00, the front door opens. It was probably the milkmaid.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Something blocked the spray.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Something in a size eight.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Could that be explained by her rendering aid?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I don't think so. It's a fine mist. A spatter. (She looks at the pants fabric with the blood spatter on it.) I think he was still alive, expirating blood.</p>

<p><strong>Donna</strong>: Oh, dear. What happened to Mummy's widdle baby? Did Brucey fall down and go boom?</p>
<p>(End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So you're admitting responsibility in the death of your husband?</p>
<p><strong>James Mandelbaum</strong>: No. Mrs. Eiger is not a health care professional. She merely delayed in calling for help.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: She watched him die.</p>
<p><strong>Donna Eiger</strong>: He had a broken neck. If he'd lived, he would've been a quadriplegic.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So it was a mercy killing?</p>
<p><strong>James Mandelbaum</strong>: It wasn't a killing at all.</p>
<p>(Grissom gets it.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You would've had to take care of him.</p>
<p><strong>Donna Eiger</strong>: Oh, bathe him, feed him, change his diapers. (She chuckles.)<br />
Freakin' gift from God to him. See the thing was, I-I just didn't want Bruce to have the satisfaction of being helpless for the rest of his life. Do you know what the last words I said to him were? (beat) You lose.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So I take it that you weren't his, uh, his mommy?</p>
<p><strong>Donna Eiger</strong>: Look-- love, honor, cherish. Diapering was never on the list.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How'd you deal with it?</p>
<p><strong>Donna Eiger</strong>: Oh, I didn't. Look, I'm sorry, but ... you can't have s*x with a man after you've seen him ... after you've seen him behave like that. So in order to save our marriage, we had, uh, an arrangement. On Thursday nights, I go to the club with my friends. He hires a baby-sitter.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We have reason to believe it was the same baby-sitter every week. Any idea who that is?</p>
<p><strong>Donna Eiger</strong>: (shakes her head) No, women in my position have been looking the other way for years. I just had... something a little stranger to look away from.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Why didn't you leave him?</p>
<p><strong>Donna Eiger</strong>: Nobody leaves Bruce.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, maybe you had to get Bruce to leave you. You push him off the balcony?</p>
<p><strong>Donna Eiger</strong>: No. He'd already fallen when I found him. I turned him over. I watched him die.</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Your reputation.</p>
<p><strong>James Mandelbaum</strong>: Donna may be an opportunist, but she is not a murderer. And since neither of us believe that Bruce was suicidal ...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You're both psychiatrists?</p>
<p><strong>Donna Eiger</strong>: Look, my husband did not commit suicide. So why don't you just find the guy who did, and I will write him a big, fat check.</p>

<p>(Catherine and Grissom walk down the stairs.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: That drug spike that Mia detected in Bruce's diaper -- &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds...&quot; L-S-D. But I don't get it, because acid trips last for hours. Why wouldn't it have shown up in his bloodstream?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: LSD is in and out of your system in twenty minutes. But it acts as a trigger, which sets off cascading reactions in the brain.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: Bruce is running through his hallway.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) The brain keeps cascading long after the drug is gone.</p>

<p>(Sara shows Sofia the two prints.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: We've excluded Mrs. Eiger. How long can a woman lactate after giving birth?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I had a professor in college, her six-year-old used to come in for lunch. I guess they'll go as long as you let them.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: What, the boobs or the kids? That's a two-legged topless buffet.<br />
(She looks at the file folder.) Ugh.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'm thinking, you know, if you commit to something every Thursday night, you got to be getting something good out of it. We found oil drops on the driveway. None of the Eiger cars had leaks. I ran it through Trace. It was an AGIP ... Sint 2000. It's a synthetic motor oil.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: A synthetic would make it high end.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: That particular oil is only used for Lamborghinis. How many lactating women are driving one of those?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: So he either paid well or was a good gift giver.</p>

<p><strong>David Hodges</strong>: And people call me a**l. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, the whole point of having a &quot;mommy&quot; is to have her do these things for you.</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, she's cute. How old is she?</p>

<p><strong>Sy Magli</strong>: Tanya always goes where the best deal is. I &quot;rolled&quot; her, Bruce bankrolled her. Her career-- smart move. Turned out she actually had other talents. She was making him a ton of money, so I gave her a call.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You poached her.</p>
<p><strong>Sy Magli</strong>: Ah, come on, look, she jumped at it, all right? Tanya said he was a freak and she wanted out.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And you believed him?</p>
<p><strong>Tanya Rollins</strong>: (nods) Yeah. Only after the delivery, he said he had to take the baby away. That he was going to take him to be with his mom. You know, wait until my career took off. Until I was ready to be a mother myself. And then he took me to his nursery. (chuckles) He explained to me, you know, about infantilism. Said that it was in the bible. And then he made me clean him.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: How long ago was that?</p>
<p><strong>Tanya Rollins</strong>: Five years. Five years and every week, I would ask him if I could see my baby and he kept saying, &quot;next week&quot;. &quot;Sure, Tanya, next week.&quot;<br />
&quot;No, maybe next week.&quot; You know, &quot;maybe the next week after that.&quot; (shrugs) I guess in my heart I knew that it was never going to happen. It's just that ... that was the only connection I had to my baby, you know? That and nursing Bruce.</p>

Barry Schickle: I'm telling you, man.
Friend: See ya, bro.
Barry Schickle: Later, losers.

CUT TO:


FLASH OF WHITE TO:


Brass: Barry Schickel. Wallet's still with him. With cash. &quot;A&quot; student. Recently voted class clown.

Grissom: Strange, people usually aren't scared of class clowns.

Brass: Who said the shooter was scared.
Grissom: Shot him in the back.
Brass: With his zipper down and his hands otherwise engaged.
Grissom: Yeah. We're looking for a coward.
HARD CUT TO: END OF TEASER. ROLL TITLE CREDITS.





Catherine: Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing?
Janitor: Removing graffiti.
Catherine: There's been a murder here. Nothing gets cleaned.
Janitor: School policy, Miss. I have to get this graffiti down as soon as ...
Catherine: Everything is Evidence. Policy of the Las Vegas Crime Lab. Should we call the Sheriff?

Janitor: No.
Catherine: Thank you.

Warrick: Bet you were like that in high school.
Catherine: Worse.
Warrick: Oh, you were the girl I ran away from.
Catherine: Yeah. Till you caught me.

CUT TO:



Brass: So, you say that football practice was over at 5:45?
Principal Perrin: That's right.
Brass: And it was okay for a student like this victim to return to the school property to use the restroom. That wasn't out of the ordinary?

Grissom:  Hand me a bindle.

Principal Perrin: Place isn't locked up till the janitor leaves end of his shift eight, eight-thirty. Until then, the kids at after-school events use the facilities.

Grissom:  Brass ...
Principal Perrin:  Excuse me, one of my students is dead. Are we interrupting you?

Grissom: Yeah. A little.
Brass:  That's okay. I'll drop by your office. We'll finish it there.

Brass:  You found a slug. So, the treasure hunt paid off, huh?
Grissom: Yeah, it better. We have a point of reference.

Brass: Well, the nerd squad is off and running. I'm going to ... uh ... burn a little shoe leather and see whether the victim had a beef with anyone.

CUT TO:



Rescue One:  Rescue One over drop site. We have a visual, Baker One. 

Rescue One:  Stand by for Eastern Approach.

Rescue One:  CSI. Ready for descent.
Man on Rescue One:  You're good to go.
Nick: Okay! There he is. Let's get down there.

Nick: Ready?
Sara:  I'll race you!

Rescue One:  CSI is through the air.
Rescue One:  CSI is on the ground.

Nick: Stokes! Sidle! Crime Lab. Did you open the bag?
Hank Peddigrew : Only long enough to see one gnarly looking hand. Well, skeleton of a hand.

Sara: Anyone touch the bag since?
Hank Peddigrew: With that smell?
Sara: I thought you Emergency Service guys were tougher than that.
Hank Peddigrew: Hey, I'm plenty tough.
Sara:  Down, boy. It was a joke.

Nick:  He-he. Nothing like flirting over a D.B.
Nick:  You want to airlift the body to the coroner's. We'll radio ahead.
Hank Peddigrew: Sure.
Sara: Great.

Hank Peddigrew: Are you supposed to do that already?
Sara: Body's coroner's. Property's ours.

Rescue One:  We have the basket. Copy that. Rescue One returning to base.
CUT TO:



Catherine: Hi. 
Warrick: Construction on Flamingo. I'm sorry. 
Grissom:  Give me a hand, will you? 
Warrick: Yeah.

Warrick: A .38? 
Grissom: .44. Here, take this. 

Catherine: Brass said the victim had a can of spray paint, right? 
Grissom: Orange, by my kit. It was in his backpack.

Grissom: Did you get something? 
Catherine: Paint from another source. I'm going to find out who belongs to that locker. 

Warrick: Kind of weird being in a high school. 
Grissom: They do have a timeless quality. 
Warrick: What were you? A jock or a brain?
Grissom: I was a ghost.

Grissom: Here.
 
Grissom: Shooter was standing right there. 



Grissom: And ... ? 
Warrick: Reconstruction guys can give us a more precise angle measurement, but I'm thinking ... five-four ... maybe three. We got ourselves a shorty.
CUT TO:


Nick: Let's see what metal shows up. 

Nick: Well, there's no gun on our dead body. 
Sara: Wouldn't it be easier to just unzip the bag and see what kind of shape our vic is in?
David Phillips:  I like to put that off till the last possible moment with decomps. 
Sara: I see a coin. Looks like a half dollar. 
David Phillips: Silver, whole.  I've done a few of these. 
Nick: What's that? There. About four inches long. What is that? 
David Phillips: It looks like a pin. It's a medical implant. 

David Phillips: Oh, and that's a plate in the skull. The head's been rolled.
Sara: I'd say we're dealing with a man.
David Phillips: Yeah, and by the sound of things he's been dead about two months. 
Sara: Sound? 

David Phillips: You weren't here when ESD brought this in. 
Nick: Well, it wasn't from lack of trying.
(SARA looks at NICK ... and smiles.
David Phillips: Let's go to the V.I.P. room ... I'll show you what I mean. 
CUT TO:




Julia Barett: That's Dennis Fram's locker. 
Catherine: And was this a first or has the deceased spray-painted his locker before? 
Julia Barett: Look, I'm the school counselor I don't know every move these kids make.
Catherine: Well, that's obvious or a young man wouldn't be dead. Tell me what &quot;stick&quot; means. 
CUT TO:




Grissom: Is that a Polymer Sensor Proboscis? 

Warrick: Cyranose 320. Company sent it to me, gratis for a week. They figure if it helps, CSI will buy one.
Grissom: Electronic noses run like ten grand.
Warrick: Yeah, well ... what if the shooter chews a certain kind of tobacco or has a unique halitosis and the e-nose picks up on it?
Grissom: If that thing ran out of here and bit the shooter in the ass, the county would not approve a $10,000 purchase order.

Warrick: I thought it was our job to speak for the victim no matter what it took ... and to hell with the budgets.
Grissom: Our job is to think, Warrick. Machinery should never matter more than our mind. Try this ... 

Grissom: Glass tube. Air pump ... 
Warrick: Air pump. Cost about ten bucks.

Warrick: Absorption agent?
(GRISSOM turns back to WARRICK, glances down at his kit and smiles.
Grissom: Fresh out. Improvise.


CUT TO:



Catherine: And Miss Barrett says that a Dennis Fram had been bullied by the deceased all year. He spray-painted his locker many times always something to do with his build. &quot;Skinny,&quot; &quot;shorty&quot; ... that kind of thing.
Julia Barett: Dennis is slight and Barry always picks on him for it.
Grissom: Can you arrange for us to meet with Dennis?
Julia Barett: Of course, but he would never hurt Barry. He's a good kid. He's totally nonviolent.
Grissom: Well, then, this will be brief.

Julia Barett:  We can call him from my office.

Grissom: You coming?
Catherine: Oh, I'll catch up to you.

Catherine: Hey ... I need to talk to you.
Janitor:  I didn't clean anything.
Catherine:  It's not about that.
CUT TO:



Grissom: How tall are you, Dennis?
Dennis Fram:  Five-three ... and one quarter.
Grissom: Have you washed your hands in the last hour?
Dennis Fram: Yeah. Why?
Grissom: Changed your shirt?
Dennis Fram: No.
Grissom: I'd like to do a test on your shirt if I may.
Dennis Fram: What kind of test?
Grissom: Forensic.

SHORT TIME CUT TO: 


Dennis Fram: What is that?
Grissom: G.S.R. When someone fires a weapon, gunshot residue plumes back onto their hands and clothing. 

Grissom: This means that you fired a gun within the last three to six hours.
Julia Barett: Dennis ...
Grissom: The police are going to want to talk to you.

FADE TO BLACK.




Brass:  So, you admit you fired a gun.
Dennis Fram:  I was over at the shooting range on Desert Way.
Brass: So the same night that Barry Schickel was shot and killed you were out taking target practice?
Dennis Fram: I go every Monday night. You can ask my sister. She goes with me.
Brass: Where's your gun?
Dennis Fram: I rent different ones there.
Grissom: Did you ever rent a .44 caliber?
Dennis Fram: Sometimes.

Kelsey Fram: I'm going to see my brother! Get out of the way!

Kelsey Fram: Denny, are you okay? Got your call.
Dennis Fram: I'm fine, I'm fine.
Brass: We're conducting a police investigation here.
Kelsey Fram: My dad's back in town tonight and you'll be sorry you harassed my little brother.
Brass: &quot;Questioned&quot;. A student was shot and killed in this building tonight.
Julia Barett:  You know what? Dennis has explained to you about the gunpowder. And I am sure his sister will vouch for his whereabouts. And he's a minor.
Grissom:  Jim.
Brass: We'll be in touch.

CUT TO:



David Phillips: Remember, breathe through your mouth.


David Phillips: Metal plate.

Sara: Silver dollar.

Nick: Gambling chip.

David Phillips: ... and...

Nick: Jacket. Government Issue, Army.
Sara: Ugh.

David Phillips: Pile of bones and that's it.
Sara: That's it? No organs? No-no tonsils? No ... 

Sara: ... soup?
Nick: Human ... soup. Well, we are 73.5% liquid, eh, Dave?

David Phillips: Add some bacteria, a couple gases, and... voila!
Sara: Okay, I'll take liquid man's jacket, see what I can find.

David Phillips: I'll cremate this.
Nick: What if we find the family or they find us?
David Phillips: A decomp this bad can stink up the entire building ... forever. The sooner we dispose of this, the better.

Nick: Not for our investigation.

CUT TO:



Grissom: Let me guess. Decomp in an enclosed space?
Sara: Yeah.
Nick: Yeah, in a zip bag.
Grissom: Lemons.
Sara: What?
Grissom: Use lemons.

Nick: Hmm.

CUT TO:


Lyric:  ... But I can't find my way home / still, I can't find / my way home / and... come down / off your throne / but I can't / find my way home.

CUT TO:




Catherine: So how's your new toy working out?
Warrick: It's been downsized.
Catherine: Bummer. I know how you wanted to see that thing work.
Warrick: Well, it's the same difference, really. 


Warrick: Air is drawn into the last tube the chalk absorbs the chemicals from the air. And mass spec will break it down at the lab.
Catherine: So why did you need the expensive one in the first place?
Warrick: 'Cause it was cool.

Catherine: I'll see you in homeroom.
Warrick: All right.

CUT TO:



Robbins: Barry Schickel from the high school. Dug three of these .44's from his back. 

Robbins: First one cracked his infraspinous fossa.

Robbins:  Second one entered ... past the interior angle of the scapula punctured a lung.

Robbins: And the last one entered just right of the right anterior sarratus muscle ... pierced the heart.
Grissom: The heart? That makes no sense.
Robbins: This is a special case. 

Robbins: See the scar? This guy was attacked before ... I'd say in the last six months.
Grissom: But not with a knife, it looks like prongs.
Robbins: Whatever it was, it would've killed him. If his heart had been there.

Grissom: Where was his heart?
Robbins: Barry's upper body? All his internal organs are on the opposite side of typical placement.

Grissom: Dextrocardia? Like Dr. No? That only presents in .01% of the population?
Robbins: Which was good for this guy, until his luck ran out.

Grissom: How long ago did you say he was stabbed?
Robbins: Six months, hand-to-hand combat. Sounds like something your suspect would do?
Grissom: No.
CUT TO:




Nick: Hey, how's Liquid Man doing?
Sara: You mean &quot;Mr. Cartsen&quot;? I found this. It's a nametag. 

Nick: You know, Sara, a lot of homeless guys get these army jackets cheap at salvage stores.
Sara: Well, it's a start. I'm going to get homicide to check the VA medical database for a &quot;W. Cartsen&quot; with plates or pins.
Nick: Okay. 

Nick: Ugh...
Sara: What do you got?

Nick: I don't know. I can't read an address or a phone number ...
Sara: God, it reeks! Q.D. Should be able to, uh ... to bring something up. 

Sara: Don't tell anyone.
Nick: About what?

Hank Peddigrew: Sara?
Sara:  Hi.
Hank Peddigrew: They told me out front I could find you ... here.

Sara: Yeah. Um ... I'll be right out. 

Sara: Give me a mint.
Nick:  You're going to need more than one.
Sara: Just give me.
CUT TO:



Sara: This is a nice surprise 
Hank Peddigrew: I wanted to see if you'd like to have dinner.
Sara: Yeah. Um ... when?
Hank Peddigrew: Now. I'm on break. 
Sara: Oh, well, I'm in the middle of that D.B. From the gully. He's still a John Doe and we don't know the circumstances ... 

Sara: I smell.
Hank Peddigrew: No ... well ... not that bad.
Sara: I changed clothes ... tho' the problem is that it's human fat reduced and it's attached itself to my follicles and my pores, so ... 

Sara: You don't look good.
Hank Peddigrew: I need to get some air.

Sara: Ok..

Hank Peddigrew: Uh, no, you-you stay. Uh, you've got that John Doe to worry about and, uh ... well, I can always stop by another time.
Sara:  Right.

Sara:  Okay.

Sara:  Bye.

Greg: You smell like death.
Sara: I've heard.

Greg: You know ... a real man wouldn't mind.


CUT TO:



Julia Barett: Have you talked to Barry's parents?
Grissom: I did; they had no idea he'd been stabbed.
Julia Barett: The older kids get the less they talk to their parents.
Grissom: They talk to you, though, right? The guidance counselor? Who else may have had it in for Barry Schickel?

Julia Barett: Look, he was very popular and he was a bully. So there was probably a dozen kids who wanted to see him dead.

Grissom: Really?
CUT TO:


Bram: I'd be walking by and ... he would punch me.


Bram: Everybody started calling me &quot;flinch.&quot;  Even the teachers.
FLASH TO WHITE:

Barry Schickle: Move!

Alan: He was the meanest guy I've ever known. But the way he put you down, it sounded funny. If it wasn't you.
CUT TO:
Dylan: He'd wait for me, every day. Lunch time, fourth period. Take my food.

Barry Schickle: Yo! Hungry? Ha! Thanks for the sandwich.

Dylan: Until I fixed him. It was about half a year ago, I went at him.
Grissom: With a fork? Stabbed him above his left pectoral.
Dylan: Yeah. It still didn't stop him ... I mean, today was the first day I could come to school and not feel like a moving target.
Grissom: Where were you last night about 6:00?
Dylan:  When BARRY was shot? 

Dylan:  Boxing practice.
Grissom: Okay. Thanks.

Julia Barett: I can protect them from being called a derogatory word for homosexual or the n-word. Everything else falls under free speech.
Grissom: No one's blaming you.
Julia Barett: I am.
Grissom: You know who did this, don't you? 
Julia Barett: You have no idea what these kids go through. I listen to them every day. Divorce, working parents ... cliques. And all they need is just one person to believe in them.
Grissom: Yeah. But where does that leave Barry Schickel?
Julia Barett:  That's your job.

HARD CUT TO BLACK.


;


FADE IN.


Nick: Shut up. She was not.
Warrick: I saw her in action.
Nick: Really?
Warrick: Yeah, she was.
Nick: Catherine?

Catherine: I was what?
Warrick: I was just telling Nick how you were a big bully in high school.
Catherine: A bully? All right, I guess I was. But, I mean, not the kind that people want to take a gun out and shoot.
Warrick: No.
Nick: No, no. You were the kind that guys fall all over themselves trying to impress.
Catherine:  Like you, Nick, huh? 

Catherine: Oh, Nick ... what were you in high school?
Nick: Me? I was, uh ... I was &quot;dependable&quot;.
Catherine: Dependable.
Nick: Mm-Hmm ..
Catherine: Dependable jock, Dependable stoner?
Nick: No. Never a strap, never a smoker. Just all-around &quot;dependable&quot; guy, I guess.
Warrick: What Nick's trying to say he was unpopular.

Nick: I was popular with the right people, I can tell you that. I can also tell you what I wasn't. I wasn't a mac daddy wannabe with a Members Only jacket, putting his swerve on all the ladies.
Warrick: What was wrong with those Members Only jackets? They were kind of cool back in the day.

Sara: Hey, Nick. Ronnie's got something on Liquid Man, says it's hot.
Nick: Good.

Warrick: Hey, Sara. What were you in high school?
Sara: Science nerd.

Nick: You changed ...  But you still smell.

Nick: Let's go!
Catherine: So that leaves you, Warrick. What were you?
Warrick: Oh, I was short, I had big feet, thick glasses.
Catherine: You?
Warrick: Yeah. I got pushed around by all the guys and never got any play from the girls ...
Catherine: The girls didn't even notice your eyes?
Warrick: No, they used to tease me about my eyes. Called me names.
Catherine: Aww ... Well, what do they know? They're your best feature.
Warrick: I didn't have a best feature in high school. Looking back on it now I can say I could see both sides of it thinking about this guy Barry Schickel, and how he was shot and whichever kid did it. I'm not saying it was right, but I kind understand, you know?
Catherine: Yeah.

CUT TO:




Ronnie Litre: I wanted to hold off on this matchbook until it dried out, but then I realized ... 
Nick: ... Human fat never dries out, it just gets waxy.
Ronnie Litre: Exactly. What I'm doing is adding pixels at some points and erasing pixels at other points.

Ronnie Litre: Got it.
Sara:  &quot;Roma ...&quot; &quot;Roman ... nini's...&quot; Never heard of it.
Nick: I have. Nightclub for boomers off the strip.  Thanks, man.
Ronnie Litre: You bet.

CUT TO:



Det. O'Riley: Hey, Stokes. Your &quot;W. Cartsen&quot;?
Nick: Yeah?

Det. O'Riley: He's a second lieutenant William Cartsen. Served in the war, wounded in action. Got sent stateside after they put him back together. They put a pin in his spine and a plate in his head 31 years ago. Walked out of the hospital, hasn't been heard of since.

Nick: Okay. Come with us.
CUT TO:




CUT TO:




Warrick: What's the matter, you don't trust me?
Grissom: I trust you.

Warrick: I got a boatload of chemical components here. Marijuana, bubble gum, cigars. It's like every guy's bathroom in America.
Grissom:  What doesn't belong?

CUT TO:


Manager Of Romanini's: How can I help you people?
Det. O'Riley: Valet guy said you're the Manager. Detective O'Riley, Las Vegas P.D. Stokes and Sidle from the Crime Lab.
Manager Of Romanini's: Crime Lab? What's going on?
Det. O'Riley: This man a patron of your establishment? Name's William Cartsen.

Manager Of Romanini's: Not that I recognize. No.
Nick: Are you sure you haven't seen him around here? Wore an army jacket, might've been down on his luck?
Manager Of Romanini's: Oh, you mean &quot;Moses&quot;. 
Nick: Moses? 
Manager Of Romanini's: Yeah. Guy had a beard down to here, wore a robe, the army jacket. Stood out here scaring every patron I had.

William Cartsen : Hey! The whole world is watching. 

William Cartsen : Bidi dou! Bidi dou!

Manager Of Romanini's: Guy was ruining my business.
Det. O'Riley: So what'd you do?
Manager Of Romanini's: I tried to reason with him.

Manager Of Romanini's: Hey! Hey, buddy, you've g t to leave my customers alone, okay? 
(He holds out a gambling chip for Moses.
Manager Of Romanini's: Here. Cash that and move on.

Manager Of Romanini's: That's the last I saw of him.
Sara: When was that?
Manager Of Romanini's: I don't know. About two months ago.
Sara: That's funny we found his body. Coroner says he's been dead two months.
Det. O'Riley: We're going to want you to take a little ride with us.
Manager Of Romanini's: Okay.
CUT TO:




Brass: I checked out those kids you talked to. None of them was even near the school when Barry Schickel was killed ... 

Brass: The only one who doesn't check out is Dennis Fram.
Catherine: There's a reason. I can put him at the crime scene. Jim, can you call them from the car?
Brass: Sure, let's go.

Grissom: Put him there, how?
Catherine: Oh ... well. I'll explain on the way.
Grissom: No, no. I'm going stay here ... with this, close to Warrick.
Catherine: Okay. But you'll miss all the fireworks.

CUT TO:



Mr. Fram: I know I must sound like the typical parent, but my son had nothing to do with the death of the Schickel boy.
Catherine: We've placed him at the murder.
Mr. Fram: What?

CATHERINE Here's the fingerprint that I recovered from Dennis' locker.  These are Dennis' prints on file at school -- the Missing Kids Prevention Drive. There's a match.
Mr. Fram: Well, his own fingerprints on his own locker that doesn't prove anything.
Catherine: Proves a timeline. The alkyd particles in the victim's spray paint adhere and dry in 30 seconds.

Catherine: Oxidation. Dennis had to have swiped the paint within seconds of Barry putting it on his locker for his print to take.
Mr. Fram: Well, how do you know ... ?
Catherine: The janitor. 
 
Catherine: He keeps timed records of graffiti. Job security. And Dennis left paint on the door jamb in the bathroom where Barry was shot.

Brass: That's the timeline of the murder, Mr. Fram. We know every move your son made up until the gun. That's why we want to see your collection. You're registered as having two dozen weapons?

Kelsey Fram: Denny?

Dennis Fram: Ow ... 
Kelsey Fram: It's okay, it's okay. Come on. We'll fix it.

CUT TO:


Warrick: This... does not belong in a guy's bathroom. Can we prove this? I mean there's got to be a thousand different brands of this stuff out there.
Grissom: You still got that $10,000 e-nose you were using?
Warrick: Oh. Now you want my tricked-out toy.
Grissom: I just want the software.

CUT TO:



Kelsey Fram: Come on, drink up. Here you go. Good.  Just hold this to your face, okay? I'll be right back.

Kelsey Fram: He's got a bleeding ulcer from being bullied by Barry Schickel.

Barry Schickle: Hey, shrimp, want to go for a ride?

Kelsey Fram: You don't know how hard it was for him every morning trying to work up the courage just to go to school.

Kelsey Fram: I thought my little brother was going to kill himself.
Catherine: And then someone killed Barry.
Kelsey Fram:  Yeah.
Catherine: How tall are you?
Kelsey Fram: Five-four ... with heels. Why?
Catherine: No reason.
CUT TO:



Grissom: You grabbed a top note of &quot;floral&quot; and now we ask the software to break it into ingredients. Do you recognize any of these?
Warrick: That's all from one perfume?
Grissom: Some of these perfumes have, like, 750 ingredients.

[CHEMICAL NAME / EUCLIDEAN DISK
= &gt; CHEMICAL COMPOUND ANALYSIS RESULTS:
&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;CHANTEUSE &quot; &lt;&lt;&lt; ]
Grissom: &quot;Chanteuse.&quot;
Warrick: We can narrow it down to one brand?
Grissom: Yeah, the original application for this program was perfume companies. You know, testing new brands stealing from the competition.

Grissom:  Grissom.
INTERCUT WITH:

Catherine:  Grissom, we got a suspect. But it's not who you think.
Grissom:  Let me guess. Denny Fram's sister?
Catherine:  How did you know?
Grissom:  Vapor molecules. See if you can get a warrant for her perfume and have Brass bring her in.
Catherine:  Her perfume?
CUT TO:


Brass: Let's get back to my first question, Miss Fram. Where were you the night Barry Schickel was killed?
Kelsey Fram: I told you, I was out driving around.
Brass: So what, your perfume just wafted into the boys' room all the way from highway 10?
Kelsey Fram: Yes. I wear Chanteuse. What's that got to do with anything? My mom used to wear it and ... after her car accident I started to wear it.
Warrick: Well, aromas have fingerprints. They're like a unique combination of vapor molecules that linger in the air, long after the source has gone.
Grissom: We isolated a combination in the restroom where Barry Schickel was shot. It matches your perfume.
Catherine: A high-end woman's perfume. It's doubtful that any other girl at the school wears it.
Mr. Fram: Wait, wait, wait ... She has no reason to hurt Barry Schickel.
Catherine: What about revenge for her little brother?
Mr. Fram: I can't believe this. That b*st*rd Schickel dogged my family, now he's doing it from the grave. Come on, Kelsey.  You come near us again, you do it through my lawyer.

Catherine: Wears her dead mother's perfume. Nice touch.
Grissom: Might be true. Scent triggers memory more acutely than any of the five senses.
Catherine: Yeah? Well, I smell a rat in the Fram family.
FADE TO BLACK.




Sara: So you didn't hurt him. You just put him in your car. Is that what you're saying?
Manager Of Romanini's: Back seat. Then I drove him out of town. I left him on the side of the road, out by Red Rock.
Nick: You didn't maybe zip him up in a bag because he was giving you trouble ... anything like that?
Manager Of Romanini's:  No.

Sara: These ... are the handles from the bag that he was found in. 
(PHOTO 1 of the handle contains the following writing:
SS#1
2001-14794)

Sara: You see these prints here?
Nick: Can I see your right hand, sir?

Manager Of Romanini's: Look, he was drunk. He was rolling all over my backseat. So I put him in a bag from my trunk. Once we got out of town, I just tipped him down the hill.

Manager Of Romanini's: I figured he'd get out once he slept it off. The guy always shows up. What am I looking at?
Det. O'Riley: Homicide. 
Manager Of Romanini's: Look, I was just doing my job.
Nick: Hey ... treating another human being like garbage is not a job. It's a choice.

CUT TO:



Warrick: Paperwork. Later.

Catherine: Dennis?
Dennis Fram: I need to talk to you. 
CUT TO:


Dennis Fram: You have to understand anything my sister did was to protect me.
Grissom: You said that you went back to the high school that night after target practice.
Dennis Fram: I forgot a book I needed for homework. And I knew Barry had been there. 

Dennis Fram: I wasn't looking for him. I had to go to the bathroom.

Dennis Fram: My dad's freaking out. My sister won't come out of her room. I figure if you can get the police to make some kind of deal for her ... 
Catherine: Well, Dennis, you haven't told us that you explicitly saw Kelsey shoot the victim.
Dennis Fram: She was in a stall. I couldn't see her.

Brass: Can I, uh ... can I talk to you for a minute?
Grissom: Excuse us.

Brass: He copping to anything?
Catherine: He says that his sister did it.
Brass: I don't think so. Kelsey was &quot;otherwise indisposed.&quot; She got a parking ticket the same time the vic was shot in an alley behind a motel off Fremont street. In fact, a lot of cars got tickets that night.

Grissom: Who's Jeremy Spencer?
Brass: Football coach.
Catherine: Oh. At a motel with the high school coach. No wonder she wouldn't talk.
Brass: Well, I paid &quot;coach&quot; a visit. The guy's 23, just got engaged. I mean, he'll testify to anything as long as his fiancé doesn't find out. He says that Kelsey gave him a roll in the hay asked him to intercede with Barry-the-bully and get the kid to leave her little brother alone. She didn't kill anyone.
Catherine: So why is he saying she did?
Grissom: Do you ever smell a fart and end up blaming the wrong guy? 

Grissom: Why do you think your sister shot Barry?
Dennis Fram: Because.
Grissom: Because why?
Dennis Fram: 'Cause of the last time he beat me up.

Kelsey Fram: I'll protect you. I'll fix things so he never comes near you again.

Dennis Fram: She always keeps her word.
Grissom: She asked Barry's coach to help you. That was her protection plan. She was nowhere near the high school that night.
Dennis Fram: I smelled her perfume. 

Dennis Fram:  I saw Barry. 

Dennis Fram:  I saw the gun. 

Dennis Fram:  And I smelled my sister's perfume.

Grissom: No. You smelled her brand of perfume.
Dennis: But then, who was it?

CUT TO:


Grissom: We recovered this from your townhouse on a warrant. Chanteuse. 


Grissom: We also found the gun. It hasn't been cleaned.
Julia Barett: Well, I don't know how to clean a gun. That was my husband's.
Grissom: You know how to shoot one.
Julia Barett: Do you know how many kids go to school and kill just to get relief from the bullying? You talked to them. Boxing lessons and target practice. How long before one of them came in here and opened fire on a hallway full of kids, huh? I just thought that one life was better than 20 ... or 30.
Grissom: Or eleven.  Captain Brass ran a search on you. Tetrick High School, Tetrick, Arizona. Eleven kids shot a few days after Columbine. You were the Assistant Principal.
Julia Barett: I watched them die at my feet. Just because some sophomore couldn't take the jokes about his glasses.
Grissom: It says that you were left with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. You might want to mention that to your lawyer.
Julia Barett: I did this for my kids.
Grissom: You know, Miss Barrett as difficult as high school can be for kids, eventually, it's over ... but too soon for Barry Schickel.

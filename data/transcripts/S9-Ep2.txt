							<p>Hello?</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>What's with the bikini?</p>
<p>Maybe she wanted to leave a good-looking corpse.</p>
<p>Guys, you might want to take a few steps back.</p>
<p>This could get messy.</p>
<p>Soup sandwich.</p>
<p>Should have taken the elevator down.</p>
<p>♪ Who... are you? ♪</p>

<p>It's the lab again.</p>
<p>Do you want to get it?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Maybe we should go away for a while.</p>
<p>I can't.</p>
<p>We're so short.</p>
<p>Why don't you stay?</p>
<p>I can't stay here.</p>
<p>It would be easy to take a trip.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p><em>Get on the Sea Shepherd.</em></p>
<p>Go to the Galápagos.</p>
<p>We can literally walk in the footsteps of Darwin.</p>
<p>The fall is like flying.</p>
<p>It's the sudden stop that gets you.</p>
<p>Momentum's a bitch.</p>
<p>Catherine.</p>
<p>The doorman I.D.'d her as Sprig Greniger.</p>
<p>Apartment 2204.</p>
<p>Lives with her boyfriend.</p>
<p>We're putting out a broadcast.</p>
<p>Well, let's find out why Sprig was sprung.</p>
<p>Whoa.</p>
<p>No sign of forced entry.</p>
<p>No struggle.</p>
<p>Nice place.</p>
<p>Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>Something smells really good.</p>
<p>Mmm.</p>
<p>Cook ten hours at 200 degrees.</p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p>She was getting married in less than two weeks.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Yeah, she was having dinner with the in-laws tonight.</p>
<p>&quot;Pot roast. Make and reheat. &quot;</p>
<p>Less than an hour left on the pot roast.</p>
<p>Turn on the news, make a pot roast, slip into a bikini, and commit suicide?</p>
<p>Yeah, it doesn't make a whole lot of sense.</p>
<p>She got a call just before midnight.</p>
<p>Maybe she and the boyfriend had a fight.</p>
<p>Oh, God.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>Archie, it's Catherine.</p>
<p>Can you run a number for me?</p>
<p>Sir.</p>
<p>Williams. Doc.</p>
<p>What took so long for the lab to get here?</p>
<p>We're a little shorthanded, Detective.</p>
<p>Sorry. Forgot.</p>
<p>Delivery guy found her here a couple of hours ago.</p>
<p>Rough neighborhood.</p>
<p>Looks like someone was having a five-finger discussion with her.</p>
<p>The language of the streets.</p>
<p>And there's your money shot.</p>
<p>Blunt-force trauma to the back of the skull.</p>
<p>I think I found ground zero.</p>
<p>And I found a room key in her back pocket.</p>
<p>Tangiers.</p>
<p>I'll check it out.</p>
<p>I don't see a purse.</p>
<p>Maybe she was a tourist trying to score something a little stronger than alcohol.</p>
<p>Detective, give me a hand here, would you? Yeah.</p>
<p>The globes of her eyeballs are ruptured.</p>
<p>Looks like someone thumbed them back into the orbital socket.</p>
<p>You know, they, uh, they squish like grapes.</p>
<p>This was rage.</p>
<p>Pure rage.</p>
<p>Hi. Sorry to hear about Brown.</p>
<p>Gonna miss him.</p>
<p>Yeah. Me, too.</p>
<p>Your victim was a 34-year-old black female.</p>
<p>Been in a coma for eight years.</p>
<p>Result of a rape assault.</p>
<p>I worked the case, along with Sidle.</p>
<p>Looks like the husband disconnected the breathing tube.</p>
<p>I can't get him away from her.</p>
<p>The uniforms are gonna go in and drag him out.</p>
<p>I'm just waiting for you.</p>
<p>Why don't you, uh, hold off on that.</p>
<p>I'd just like to make a call first.</p>
<p>THE CHOICES I MAKE CONTROLS MY WEIGHT I wonder how many guys go on diets before their weddings.</p>
<p>I MAKE HEALTHY CHOICES She was filing for unemployment.</p>
<p>Bank teller.</p>
<p>Maybe losing her job sent her over the edge.</p>
<p>This is Catherine.</p>
<p>Oh, hey, Archie.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>Okay, thanks.</p>
<p>So, the last call to Sprig's cell was from a pay phone on Paradise and Moesser Avenue.</p>
<p>That's right across the street.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Whoever called Sprig had a front-row seat.</p>
<p>I'll print the phone, see what I can get.</p>
<p>This is Brett Davidson, our victim's fianc Mr. Davidson, I'm sorry for your loss.</p>
<p>How often do you have to say that?</p>
<p>Often.</p>
<p>You live here.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I'm sorry, I'm gonna have to print you.</p>
<p>Where were you, Mr. Davidson?</p>
<p>I had a business trip in Phoenix.</p>
<p>I was just gone for a day.</p>
<p>Was your fiancee depressed?</p>
<p>No, she invented the silver lining.</p>
<p>We were getting married.</p>
<p>We were having my parents over for dinner.</p>
<p>She'd been planning it for weeks.</p>
<p>Were the two of you having problems?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I mean... weddings don't always bring out the best in women.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>She didn't want &quot;fat&quot; wedding pictures, so she stopped eating.</p>
<p>Obsessively counting calories, and all that dietstuff.</p>
<p>And there's the cost of the wedding, the honeymoon.</p>
<p>Plus the, uh, mortgage on this place.</p>
<p>I told her not to worry about money, that I could pay for everything.</p>
<p>I told her that all the time.</p>
<p>Did she quit her job?</p>
<p>It was a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Her drawer came in short.</p>
<p>After five years of loyal service, the bank accused her of stealing ten grand.</p>
<p>She didn't do it.</p>
<p>It's just not who she is.</p>
<p>I held the scene for you.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>Tom?</p>
<p>Sarah.</p>
<p>What are you doing here?</p>
<p>I thought you'd been away.</p>
<p>I am so sorry.</p>
<p>I know how much you loved her.</p>
<p>I promised to protect her.</p>
<p>I failed her once.</p>
<p>I wasn't gonna fail her again.</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>He started calling me.</p>
<p>Harassing me.</p>
<p>And he was here in her room.</p>
<p>Who was here, Mr. Adler?</p>
<p>The guy who put her here...</p>
<p><em>Tony Thorpe.</p>
<p>He left me a newspaper clipping from eight years ago, with a note.</p>
<p>Said he violated her again.</p>
<p>That she liked it more the second time.</p>
<p>It's the only way I knew to save her.</em></p>
<p>You still have the newspaper?</p>
<p>We could run it for prints.</p>
<p>It made me sick to my stomach.</p>
<p>I burned it.</p>
<p>Mr. Adler, you need to come with me.</p>
<p>We need to go downtown so you can give a statement.</p>
<p>Tom, look. Um...</p>
<p>I- I am no longer a CSI, but...</p>
<p>I'll go with you. Okay?</p>
<p>I won't leave you.</p>
<p>Here we got our jumper fired.</p>
<p>He's making change.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>He gave her two 50s.</p>
<p>She gave him a hundred hundreds.</p>
<p>Ten grand.</p>
<p>Mm.</p>
<p>Bank manager said when he questioned her, <em>she couldn't remember the customer or the transaction.</em></p>
<p>But there's no gun, no note.</p>
<p>She doesn't appear to be under duress.</p>
<p>Which is exactly why the bank figured it was a scam- she was in on it.</p>
<p>Now, this is a day-shift case from a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>Different bank, same guy, same gag.</p>
<p>The guy hands her two $50s.</p>
<p>She counts out a hundred hundred-dollar bills According to the case file, she can't remember anything either.</p>
<p><em>I've been working at First Federation</em> nine years.</p>
<p>Perfect record.</p>
<p>Miss Powell, do you recognize this man?</p>
<p>If I knew who he was, I'd hunt him down myself.</p>
<p>You know, memory is a funny thing.</p>
<p>Even when they showed me the video, I couldn't remember this guy.</p>
<p><em>Now my mind starts thinking I do know him.</em></p>
<p>But I'm just recognizing him from all the times you cops keep showing me his damn, ugly picture.</p>
<p>And you don't have any memory of what happened the day he came in.</p>
<p><em>You always remember the day you got fired.</p>
<p>What I can't remember, is &quot;Light Fingers&quot; Louie there.</em></p>
<p>Miss Powell, have you been doing anything to lose weight recently?</p>
<p>Now you saying I look fat? Because I only gained three pounds since I quit smoking.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>And how did you quit?</p>
<p>Went to the stop-smoking lady.</p>
<p>You trying to quit, too?</p>
<p>'Cause, uh...</p>
<p>I got her number.</p>
<p>My, that's a big, big egg you're trying to lay.</p>
<p>All right, back to your roosts.</p>
<p>Back to your roosts.</p>
<p>Back, back, back to your roost.</p>
<p>Now, on my count of three, you will go into a deep state of relaxation.</p>
<p>Your eyes will become heavy.</p>
<p>One... two... three.</p>
<p>Relax.</p>
<p>Deeper and deeper into a state of relaxation.</p>
<p>Deeper... and deeper.</p>
<p>You are feeling... very comfortable.</p>
<p>Now, sweetheart, I'm handing you a delicious, crunchy apple.</p>
<p>When I tell you to open your eyes, you will bite into this delicious, crunchy apple.</p>
<p>One, two, three- open your eyes.</p>
<p>Ohh...</p>
<p><em>Well, the show just pays the bills,</em> but most of my work is private client therapy.</p>
<p>Was a young lady named Sprig Greniger a client of yours?</p>
<p>She wanted to lose weight for her honeymoon, and she lost 12 pounds.</p>
<p>Well, what did you do?</p>
<p><em>Well, I didn't do anything.</em></p>
<p>All hypnosis is self-hypnosis.</p>
<p>Look, people clucking like chickens and humping chairs, that's all... that's all schtick.</p>
<p>But... when they come to me for therapy, they have a goal.</p>
<p>They want to lose weight or stop smoking, and I do visualizations to help them get there.</p>
<p>&quot;See your lungs healthy. &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;See yourself in a bathing suit. &quot;</p>
<p>What kind of visualizations did you give Sprig?</p>
<p>I told her to, uh, picture herself in a... in a teeny bikini, on a beach in Hawaii, taking off her towel, then running across the sand and jumping into the water, feeling fit and confident.</p>
<p>Sounds pretty simple.</p>
<p>It is and it isn't.</p>
<p>Hypnosis just helps you go into different states of consciousness.</p>
<p>I mean, beta is your most conscious state.</p>
<p>That's what we're all in right now.</p>
<p>And then there's alpha.</p>
<p>That's your meditative state.</p>
<p>And then theta.</p>
<p>That's your dream state.</p>
<p>And finally, there's delta.</p>
<p><em>That's that super deep sleep you go into</em> after feeling really exhausted.</p>
<p>I mean, have either one of you ever gotten to work and then forgotten how you got there?</p>
<p>Forgotten the entire ride?</p>
<p>Well, then essentially, you've been in a hypnotic state.</p>
<p>I mean, being in love, all you see is good.</p>
<p>Being in grief, all you see is bad.</p>
<p>It's all altered states, and we float between them.</p>
<p>What state of mind was the onion-eater in?</p>
<p>Well, he was somewhere between alpha and theta.</p>
<p>And what will he remember?</p>
<p>Eating an onion?</p>
<p>Or eating an apple?</p>
<p>As far as he knows, he ate an apple.</p>
<p>Because you told him it was an apple.</p>
<p>Well, because he wanted to eat an apple.</p>
<p>So, could you convince people to do anything?</p>
<p>Like... rob a bank?</p>
<p><em>Hypnosis is not magic; I cannot make people</em> do things that they wouldn't otherwise do, unless... unless it was already in their nature.</p>
<p>The prints came back.</p>
<p>Paula Bonfilio, high school guidance counselor from Henderson.</p>
<p>How about the Tangiers room key in her pocket?</p>
<p>The room was registered to a pit boss there.</p>
<p>Says he uses it to entertain high rollers.</p>
<p>She didn't sound like a high roller to me.</p>
<p>Pit boss says he can tell like clockwork when she gets her paycheck.</p>
<p>Last night she was in pretty deep.</p>
<p>He helped her get out of the hole.</p>
<p>Oh, I get it.</p>
<p>You get a DNA sample?</p>
<p>It matched the semen Grissom found in her vaginal vault.</p>
<p>Well, I'm glad she's guiding our youth.</p>
<p>Look, I'm hung up at the sheriff's office helping them look for a new undersheriff.</p>
<p>You're gonna find out what she was doing in Alphabet City?</p>
<p>Yes, sir. I'm on my way to talk to the family right now.</p>
<p>Okay, stay safe.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Can I help you?</p>
<p>And you are?</p>
<p>I'm, I'm Scott Bonfilio.</p>
<p>So, Scott, is your dad around?</p>
<p>I don't have a dad.</p>
<p>I mean, I... I don't know who he is.</p>
<p>I'm Detective Williams, LVPD. This is Gil Grissom, from the Crime Lab.</p>
<p>Is this about my mom?</p>
<p>Is she in trouble?</p>
<p>I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but... your mom has died.</p>
<p>It appears she was murdered.</p>
<p>But I, I talked to her last night.</p>
<p>She was fine.</p>
<p>What time?</p>
<p>Um...</p>
<p>Like around 10:00 or so.</p>
<p>She was with Lexi.</p>
<p>Who's that?</p>
<p>She's my baby sister.</p>
<p>We interrupt our program with this important Amber Alert.</p>
<p>Please help police find this little girl...</p>
<p>She's just two years old and named Lexi Bonfilio.</p>
<p>Lexi's mother was last seen alive up at Tangiers Casino Hotel...</p>
<p>Wow, that's was really fast.</p>
<p>We take missing children very seriously.</p>
<p>Did you find me anything with DNA on it?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>I- I haven't washed it.</p>
<p>Will that work?</p>
<p>It's perfect.</p>

<p>Scott, when was the last time you saw your mother?</p>
<p>Yesterday at school.</p>
<p>She said she and Lexi were going shopping I had to work, so I didn't get home till around 7:00.</p>
<p>And she called around 10:00? Yeah.</p>
<p>She said she... would be gone for the night.</p>
<p>Is that normal?</p>
<p>Gone for the night?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>With Lexi... only if I have to work.</p>
<p>Did she say where she was or...?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>And I stopped asking.</p>
<p>I know this sounds terrible, but I'm...</p>
<p>I'm a straight-A senior.</p>
<p>Going to community college next year because my mom gambled away my college money.</p>
<p><em>I started hiding my paychecks but my mom would find them anyway.</p>
<p>And then she'd go to the tables and lose it all.</em></p>
<p>This isn't your typical mother-son relationship.</p>
<p>Is it possible that your sister's with her father?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>My mom's always been kind of a... kind of a party girl.</p>
<p>But she never brought guys home.</p>
<p>When she got pregnant with Lexi... she said she was a gift from God.</p>
<p>I got a pretty good timeline on Paul Bonfilio.</p>
<p>At 4:15 p. m., a hold was placed on Paul's credit card by the Tangiers Casino Day Care.</p>
<p>Casino day care; there's the fifth sign of the Apocalypse.</p>
<p>She loses big for a couple of hours.</p>
<p>Leaves the table around 6:00 p. m.</p>
<p>Picked her up on another camera heading away with some cheesy-looking dude.</p>
<p>Brass ID'd him as a pit boss.</p>
<p>Entertainer to the desperate.</p>
<p>She goes back to the tables around 7:00 but didn't play for very long.</p>
<p>She got a call from a disposable cell phone.</p>
<p>I'm thinking it was from... this guy.</p>
<p>He grabs her. She grabs her last 500-dollar chip, and they split.</p>
<p>He got her out of there before she lost it all.</p>
<p>You know, higher denomination chips sometimes carry a radio frequency device.</p>
<p>I'll call the casino.</p>
<p>They'll flag it.</p>
<p>Someone tries to cash it, they'll tell us.</p>
<p>At 8:15 p. m., she and Mr. Grabby pick up the baby.</p>
<p>So now she's got the baby.</p>
<p>The next time I have her is at Pete's Pawnshop downtown, B Street.</p>
<p>Right where you found the body.</p>
<p>Her ATM card was rejected there just after 9:00 p. m.</p>
<p>The account was overdrawn.</p>
<p>And then we have a cell phone call to home around 10:00 p. m.</p>
<p>That's it for the timeline.</p>
<p>Last seen with a man wearing glasses inside Pete's Pawnshop.</p>
<p>I found broken optical glass in the alley out back.</p>
<p>Maybe we're looking at her killer.</p>
<p>Is this justice?</p>
<p>He's a victim in this.</p>
<p>He had admitted killing his wife.</p>
<p>Active euthanasia is felony murder.</p>
<p>I feel for the guy, but it's out of my hands.</p>
<p>He said that Thorpe went to Pam's room, did God only knows what, called his house, bragged about it...</p>
<p>We're checking into that.</p>
<p>It would have helped if he saved the note.</p>
<p>Would you if it was your wife?</p>
<p>Sara, the fact is, he unplugged her tube, and he watched her die.</p>
<p>? home phone could be traced back to Tony Thorpe.</p>
<p>Well, he could use the pay phone or a disposable phone.</p>
<p>There's no evidence Thorpe was ever in Pam Adler's room.</p>
<p>No trace of him on her or in her.</p>
<p>And Doc Robbins found no sign of sexual assault.</p>
<p>Yeah, but we don't know when that happened.</p>
<p>And we both know that semen deteriorates within 12 to 24 hours.</p>
<p>Sara, you have to consider the possibility that the husband made up the story to justify his actions.</p>
<p>No, absolutely not.</p>
<p>I'm not saying he didn't love her.</p>
<p>He loved her so much that he kept her alive for eight years.</p>
<p>You're still a scientist.</p>
<p>You know that after that many years of atrophy, she wasn't coming back to him.</p>
<p>I mean, sooner or later, a relationship in stasis withers.</p>
<p>You get angry.</p>
<p>You need more than the safety of knowing that you're not alone.</p>
<p>Then he should have just walked away.</p>
<p>Well, maybe he couldn't.</p>
<p>Maybe he needed her to leave him.</p>
<p>Who are we talking about right now?</p>
<p><em>I'm going to count backwards from ten to one.</em></p>
<p>When I get to one, you'll be at work the day of the robbery.</p>
<p>Ten... nine... eight... breathing... seven... six... getting closer... five, four... breathing... three, two, one.</p>
<p>Now, Grace, there's a man at your window.</p>
<p>He has a beard and baseball cap.</p>
<p>Do you see him?</p>
<p>What is he saying to you?</p>
<p>He wants change for two 50s.</p>
<p>And what do you do?</p>
<p>I give him a hundred singles.</p>
<p>Surveillance showed hundreds on the right, singles on the left.</p>
<p>She definitely gave him hundreds.</p>
<p>Does he say anything else to you?</p>
<p>I can't remember.</p>
<p>Usually, the witnesses I hypnotize for the department remember even tiny details.</p>
<p>In my opinion, whoever hypnotized her put a block in.</p>
<p>What do you mean by a block?</p>
<p>A command to keep her from remembering what happened.</p>
<p>So, you're saying this guy can just roll into a crowded bank, walk up to a teller and in 30 seconds, look her in the eye tell her she's getting sleepy and sloppy with her hundreds?</p>
<p>You couldn't do it in 30 seconds.</p>
<p>But if there's a block, it wasn't the first time he hypnotized her.</p>
<p>During a prior session, he must have implanted a post-hypnotic suggestion with a word or a phrase as a trigger.</p>
<p>Could this post-hypnotic suggestion get people to do anything even if it's against their moral code?</p>
<p>It's all in the phrasing.</p>
<p>You don't say &quot;Rob the bank. &quot;</p>
<p>You say, &quot;Liberate the money. &quot;</p>
<p>So, anybody says, &quot;Liberate the money&quot; and she sees hundreds as ones?</p>
<p>No, it has to be the same voice that planted the suggestion.</p>
<p>She had a female hypnotist.</p>
<p>We gotta get a better description on this guy.</p>
<p>The man with the baseball cap is standing in front of you.</p>
<p>What else do you notice about him?</p>
<p>Small hands.</p>
<p>Little sissy hands.</p>
<p>Jacked-up fingernails.</p>
<p>Maybe it's a fungus.</p>
<p>I don't think it's a fungus.</p>
<p>I think it's a nail glue.</p>
<p>That's how your nails look after you take off the acrylic tips.</p>
<p>When someone comes to me for therapy, they have a goal.</p>
<p>Archie, pull up the DMV photo of Viviana Conway.</p>
<p>And now do a biometrics comparison with the guy with the funky nails.</p>
<p>I figured out why Thorpe was harassing the Adlers.</p>
<p>Eight years ago, the law was if a victim dies, within a year and a day from an assault, the suspect can still be charged with the murder. Right.</p>
<p>We're working this case as a murder.</p>
<p>At least for the next year and a day.</p>
<p>And even then, I'm still a juvie.</p>
<p>According to D.A. Klein, the law's changed.</p>
<p>Nowadays, if Pam Adler died, and her death could be attributed to the rape assault, Thorpe could be charged with her murder at any time.</p>
<p>So if Thorpe knew that, he would have had motive to terrorize Tom by making Tom believe that he was raping Pam.</p>
<p>Because if the husband goes down for it, Thorpe's free and clear.</p>
<p>It's murder by proxy.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Grissom, ALPR's got a hit on Paul Bonfilio's car.</p>
<p>We're sitting on it now.</p>
<p>I'll let you know.</p>
<p>Excuse me, miss.</p>
<p>Is that your car?</p>
<p>I'm driving it.</p>
<p>Then you're under arrest for receiving stolen property...</p>
<p>Hey, hey, watch the nails!</p>
<p>I didn't kidnap nobody.</p>
<p>Where'd you get the car?</p>
<p>Some dude.</p>
<p>Hey, baby, want to taste a little sugar?</p>
<p>I don't do looky-loos.</p>
<p>I'll give you this car if you drop her off for me.</p>
<p>Some white boy with real hair gives you a car, you don't say no.</p>
<p>Well, then it's your lucky day.</p>
<p>Where'd you drop her off?</p>
<p>At Palermo.</p>
<p>They got the best buffet.</p>
<p>I need to pick up the child this woman dropped off.</p>
<p>Name?</p>
<p>Trixie, Jr.</p>
<p>You're over the four-hour limit.</p>
<p>She made a couple of stops.</p>
<p>You're not supposed to leave the casino.</p>
<p>Bitch, can you not read a situation?</p>
<p>It ain't my real baby, stupid!</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>There you go.</p>
<p>Hey, hey... that's okay, I got him.</p>
<p>Come here. Here's your big brother.</p>
<p>Who's my good girl?</p>
<p>Who's a good girl?</p>
<p>I was so scared.</p>
<p>I was so scared.</p>
<p>I missed you so much.</p>
<p>Can I keep her?</p>
<p>I'm 18.</p>
<p>I've basically been taking care of her since she was born.</p>
<p>That's up to C.P.S.</p>
<p>But I'll have my captain put in a good word.</p>
<p>Now stage left.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's it.</p>
<p>It could have just looked like teller error... twice.</p>
<p>I know you're quite the performer, but... in our business wearing a disguise is called consciousness of guilt.</p>
<p>I believe that's beta level consciousness.</p>
<p>These people trusted you.</p>
<p>And you got them fired from their jobs.</p>
<p>Why would you do something like that?</p>
<p>Because I could.</p>
<p>I can't sing.</p>
<p>I'm not a surgeon.</p>
<p>But I have this gift.</p>
<p>I have this energy and this voice that makes people feel very calm.</p>
<p>Calm enough to get inside their heads.</p>
<p>You give me 20 minutes with anyone, and I can put them under.</p>
<p>Cops, soldiers, bank tellers.</p>
<p>I mean, come on, I had not one, but two clients who were bank tellers.</p>
<p>I had to try.</p>
<p>Sprig Greniger is dead.</p>
<p>We don't think it was a suicide.</p>
<p>Sprig wrote five checks to you.</p>
<p>According to her datebook, she had six sessions.</p>
<p>The last one was the day she died.</p>
<p>Explain that to me.</p>
<p>I gave her a free session.</p>
<p>I mean, it was the least I could do.</p>
<p>Like you said, you know, she'd just lost her job.</p>
<p>Maybe she hadn't lost her memory, and she was on to you.</p>
<p>Hey, I've never even been to Sprig's apartment.</p>
<p>No, but you used the pay phone across the street.</p>
<p>Your prints are on it.</p>
<p>All she needed to hear was the sound of your voice.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>It's time for your honeymoon.</p>
<p><em>She put on a bikini.</p>
<p>She grabbed a towel.</p>
<p>She went out onto the balcony.</p>
<p>You told her to picture herself on a beach in Hawaii running across the sand, feeling fit and confident.</p>
<p>You told her to jump into the water.</em></p>
<p>You guys might have me for bank robbery... but there is no way that you can prove I had anything to do with her death.</p>
<p>It's like I told you-</p>
<p>I cannot make people do anything that they don't want to do.</p>
<p>I can.?</p>
<p>Sara, they're bringing Thorpe in now.</p>
<p>Now look, I know you have personal interest in this.</p>
<p>But you're not on the job anymore.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Tony.</p>
<p>Remember me?</p>
<p>Detective Vega.</p>
<p>Well, screw you.</p>
<p>I want a lawyer.</p>
<p>I'm not charging you with anything.</p>
<p>I just want to talk.</p>
<p>How'd you end up with the wheels?</p>
<p>Pepper Street doing some bad shots.</p>
<p>I'm too tough to die.</p>
<p>How long ago?</p>
<p>Last Christmas.</p>
<p>So this is what we got.</p>
<p>We found your prints all over Paula Bonfilio's car.</p>
<p>So tell me, Leon, how'd you bust up your hands?</p>
<p>Can't remember.</p>
<p>Picking blueberries, I think.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>How much did Paula owe you?</p>
<p>Lending money to those who need it isn't against the law.</p>
<p>But killing them if they can't pay up is.</p>
<p>All you got left is the baby and the car!</p>
<p>Pay me right now or I take them!</p>
<p>Yeah, I roughed her up.</p>
<p>And yeah, I unburdened her of her car and her baby.</p>
<p>But when I left her in that alley, she was completely alive.</p>
<p>Then why not unburden her of that 500-dollar chip she had in her purse?</p>
<p>Lady owed me 12,000 bucks.</p>
<p>$500 barely covers the interest.</p>
<p>You got to tough-love these junkie twits or they never pay up.</p>
<p>I swear on my professional oath, I was going to give her the car and the baby back.</p>
<p>Then why give them to the hooker?</p>
<p>That was just after I saw that crap on the news.</p>
<p>Kid's cool, right?</p>
<p>I didn't kill her.</p>
<p>We, uh... found Thorpe.</p>
<p>Why'd you lie to me, Tom?</p>
<p>I can't win for losing.</p>
<p>People told me I was selfish keeping her alive for so long.</p>
<p>And now look at me.</p>
<p>Mostly I was pissed that he's out walking around.</p>
<p>And whenever I wasn't working or paying for her care, I was just sitting by that bed.</p>
<p>After a while, I realized the only one who was feeling any suffering... was me.</p>
<p>I just wasn't living.</p>
<p>I just couldn't move on and leave her there like that.</p>
<p>You could have asked the doctors to help you.</p>
<p>By telling them what?</p>
<p>That I was tired?</p>
<p>I wanted them to kill my wife so that I could have a weekend to myself?</p>
<p>At least that would have been honest.</p>
<p>Archie Johnson.</p>
<p>Someone tried to cash that chip?</p>
<p>Yeah, send it over. Thanks.</p>
<p>Grissom.</p>
<p>This looks like the same gold link strap I found at the scene.</p>
<p>And there's blood on it.</p>
<p>Honey...</p>
<p><em>Paula called Scott around 10:00.</p>
<p>Maybe she needed his help.</p>
<p>I screwed up... big time.</em></p>
<p>Where's Lexi?</p>
<p>Don't be upset.</p>
<p>I can fix this.</p>
<p>No! Are you out of your mind?!</p>
<p>Just tell me where Lexi is.</p>
<p>He won't give her back until we give him the money! How could you do this?!</p>
<p>This might explain the rage.</p>
<p>He was Oedipus.</p>
<p><em>I was just running the DNA profiles,</em> and Paula and Scott Bonfilio don't have any markers in common.</p>
<p>I mean, these two are definitely not mother and son.</p>
<p>And I checked for adoption records and foster records for Scott, and there's nothing.</p>
<p>Now, Lexi, on the other hand, shares markers at every locus with both of them.</p>
<p>So she's their kid?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Now, according to Paula's employment record, they've only been living in Vegas for a little over two years.</p>
<p>So the child was conceived before they got here.</p>
<p>Which means that Scott was 15 years old.</p>
<p>This also says that her previous place of employment was Archfield High School in Akron, Ohio.</p>
<p>Scott was her student.</p>
<p>And his fingerprints are in the missing children's database.</p>
<p>She didn't kidnap me, but I became her hostage.</p>
<p>Why didn't you call your parents?</p>
<p>That's like switching arsenic for cyanide.</p>
<p>They'd never let me keep Lexi.</p>
<p>Someone cared enough about you to put you in the missing kids' database.</p>
<p>My alkie dad was missing his cigarette runner.</p>
<p>That's hardly love.</p>
<p>But you and Paula...</p>
<p>She was my guidance counselor.</p>
<p>She listened to all my problems.</p>
<p>It was the first time I felt heard.</p>
<p>Then it all went to hell.</p>
<p>I got too old for her.</p>
<p>She only liked me when I was risky.</p>
<p>As soon as the naughty faded away... she started seeking risk anywhere else she could.</p>
<p>I was just trying to start a... a better life.</p>
<p>To make a family.</p>
<p>And then she gave away our baby for a gambling debt.</p>
<p>Have you ever loved someone so much that you would kill for them?</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>And even if Lexi can't be with me, she's better off without her.</p>
<p>She promised me everything.</p>
<p>And then she took it all away.</p>

<p>[INT. PD – INTERVIEW ROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Warrick is being questioned by an IAB investigator.) </p>
<p><strong>IAB Investigator</strong>: So you were at the strip club on official business earlier in the day, but then you went back on your own time later?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I already told you, yes.</p>
<p><strong>IAB Investigator</strong>: And that's when you met the victim?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Are you guys writing any of this down? I first met Candy in the parking lot of the strip club. Later on, I talked to her inside.</p>
<p>FLASHBACK TO: [Scene from 8X09: Cockroaches]</p>
<p>[EXT. PIGALLE BOULEVARD STRIP CLUB – PARKING LOT -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Candy is giving Warrick a lap dance.) </p>
<p>END FLASHBACK.</p>
<p><strong>IAB Investigator</strong>: Approximately how much money did you spend getting to know the victim?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Three hundred bucks, but that was because it was part of an investigation.</p>
<p><strong>IAB Investigator</strong>: And that would be the investigation the undersheriff told you to drop?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yes ...</p>
<p><strong>IAB Investigator</strong>: You still on the modafinil and the zolpidem?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No, I'm off them.</p>
<p><strong>IAB Investigator</strong>: Did you take them yesterday?</p>
<p>FLASHBACK TO: Warrick grabs the pill container.</p>
<p>(Warrick pops a pill while waiting in the car.) </p>
<p>END FLASHBACK.</p>
<p><strong>IAB Investigator</strong>: So, today is the first day of the rest of your life, hmm?</p>
<p>(Warrick rubs his eyes.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. OUTER LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) – NIGHT]</p>
<p>[EXT. SILVERADO WASH (DIRT ROAD &amp; BRIDGE) – NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Greg and Nick cross a bridge as they walk away from their parked car on the road. Officer car's lights flash along the road.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Dispatch said body at a dump.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, this is definitely not the city dump.</p>
<p>(Nick and Greg come upon dead dogs. They share a look.) </p>
<p><strong>Sam Vega</strong>: Nick? Greg?</p>
<p>(Nick and Greg head over toward Sam Vega, who is with David Phillips and the body.) </p>
<p><strong>Sam Vega</strong>: Kids were out here drinking beer, found the dead dogs. Patrol unit came, responded and found the female DB.</p>
<p>(There's a woman in a red dress face down on a piece of cardboard.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Looks like animal bites on her arms and legs.</p>
<p>(Nick looks at the bites on her arms. Greg snaps photos of the body.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: No purse or ID.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay, Dave, let's see what we got.</p>
<p>(David rolls her over. There are more bites on her legs.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Whatever bit her must have been at it for a while.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, maybe. But I doubt they tied her up and beat her.</p>
<p>(David moves aside the woman's hair to show the bruises on her face.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Check out the contusions, ligature marks.</p>
<p>(He notes the bruises around her wrists.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Disposing of animals like this is illegal. Whoever dumped the vic must have known about the site from dumping dogs.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yup. (Nick stands up.) It looks like he's moving up the food chain.</p>
<p>FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>

<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) – DAWN]</p>
<p>[INT. CSI – FORENSIC AUTOPSY] </p>
<p>(Catherine takes a swab from the woman's body on the table. She caps it and picks up a second swab. She swabs inside wound #10.) </p>
<p>(She picks up the camera and photographs the wounds on the woman's face and arms. She takes photos of the wounds on the woman's legs and the white substance on her heel.) </p>
<p>(The door opens and David Phillips walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, could you do me a favor? Um, bring me one of the swabs?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Sure. What's up?</p>
<p>(David picks up a swab and hands it to her.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: There's some white trace on the soles of her feet. You were at the scene. Did you happen to notice any white material that might have transferred?</p>
<p>(Catherine takes a sample of the white substance.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Maybe. I can't say for sure. I mean, there were dead dogs and trash all over the place.</p>
<p>(Catherine picks up her camera and moves to the side.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hmm. Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Would you help me remove her dress?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Let's just roll her.</p>
<p>(They roll the body over. Catherine starts to remove the dress when she notices a mark on the woman's back.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: That look like a needle mark?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: I'll send samples to Tox.</p>
<p>(Catherine picks up the camera and takes a photo.) </p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
[JOANNA &quot;CANDY&quot;] </p>
<p><strong>Joanna &quot;Candy&quot;</strong>: (V.O.) You like trouble, you ... </p>
<p>[INT. PD – INTERVIEW ROOM]</p>
<p>(The IAB investigator continues to question Warrick.) </p>
<p><strong>IAB Investigator</strong>: So, in the course of developing this informant, you took her to a motel and had s*x with her?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: That part was personal.</p>
<p><strong>IAB Investigator</strong>: CSI Brown, in your mind, is there any distinction between personal and official?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Have you guys bothered to call the motel? I checked in with a credit card. I checked out around 5:00. I called a cab. Talk to the cab driver. When I woke up, Candy was gone. When I got back to the club to pick up my car, she was dead.</p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
[EXT. PIGALLE STRIP CLUB – PARKING LOT – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The area around Warrick's car is taped off. It's a crime scene. Warrick sees Candy is dead and inside his car.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (shouts) No-o-o!</p>
<p>END OF FLASHBACK.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Listen to me. I did not kill her. But I know damn well who did.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. PD – HALLWAY / BRASS' OFFICE]</p>
<p>(An officer escorts Lou Gedda to Brass' office. Brass is eating.) </p>
<p><strong>ND Officer</strong>: Lou Gedda to see you, Captain.</p>
<p>(The officer leaves. Gedda steps into the office. Brass doesn't stand up. Gedda tosses a slip of paper on the table. It has a name and number on it:<br />
ALICE KRUMSKY<br />
(702) 555-0127</p>
<p>(Gedda sits down.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What's this?</p>
<p><strong>Lou Gedda</strong>: Candy's mother's phone number. </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Her parents have already been notified.</p>
<p><strong>Lou Gedda</strong>: Candy wrote it down for me last night just before she died. That's why she came back to the club after her shift. Her mother was pressuring her to quit. Candy wanted me to call her, give her the talk. It's exotic dancing, not stripping. Show business.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Did you make the call?</p>
<p><strong>Lou Gedda</strong>: I don't get involved in family business, but I thought it might help your investigation.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: How's this going to help me?</p>
<p><strong>Lou Gedda</strong>: How should I know? I'm just trying to be a good citizen.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – FORENSIC AUTOPSY] </p>
<p>(The doors open as David Phillips and another coroner roll the gurney with the woman's body on it.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Hey, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: I heard your band killed last night.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Really? Who'd you hear that from?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: My wife's second cousin. Works in the mayor's office for the budget and finance director. He was at the country club. Grooved to your moldy oldies all night.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: They're classics.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: So ... uh ... people were talking about me?</p>
<p>(He chuckles. Then his smile fades as he looks down at the woman's face.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: What did I do?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: I know her.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Her name's Elizabeth Rodriguez. She and her husband Felix were honored last night by the Nevada Enterprise Association. Humanitarians of the Year. They opened that outreach center in the Alphabets. They were dancing right in front of me.</p>
<p>FLASHBACK TO: </p>
<p>[INT. COUNTRY CLUB – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Robbins is on stage singing. Elizabeth and Felix are dancing on the floor.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (V.O.) She and Felix were very philanthropic. I admired both of them.</p>
<p>END FLASHBACK.</p>
<p>(Robbins is talking with Sam Vega and Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Sam Vega</strong>: Did they leave the party together?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: No. He left first.</p>
<p>FLASHBACK TO: </p>
<p>[INT. COUNTRY CLUB – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The band is playing on stage. Felix's phone rings and he checks it on the floor. He kisses her, turns and leaves her there. Robbins notes them.) </p>
<p>END FLASHBACK.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Vega</strong>: Do you remember what time that was?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Sometime between &quot;Louie Louie&quot; and &quot;You Really Got Me.&quot; </p>
<p><strong>Sam Vega</strong>: Could you be more specific, Doc?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Well, it was just before the end of our third set. We broke at 10:00. Just before that.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And she stayed?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (nods) For a little while.</p>
<p>FLASHBACK TO: </p>
<p>[INT. COUNTRY CLUB – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Robbins is still on stage with his band. Elizabeth Rodriguez is on the dance floor with someone when a waiter comes up to her and whispers something to her. She excuses herself and leaves.) </p>
<p>END FLASHBACK.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: I didn't see her after that. Guess it was around 10:30.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Vega</strong>: And the kids called in the dead dogs around 2:00.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, that's a three-and-a-half-hour window.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Vega</strong>: I'll talk to the husband. I'll keep you posted.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>(Sam Vega leaves.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Can you tell me anything about these bites?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Definitely perimortem. Right around time of death.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, it's unlikely it's coyotes.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: No.</p>
<p>(He turns and looks at Elizabeth on the table.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Are you going to be okay with this one?</p>
<p>(He sighs and shakes his head.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: I'm just not used to seeing them alive.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) – NIGHT] </p>
<p>[INT. PD – INTERVIEW ROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Sam Vega talks with Felix Rodriguez.) </p>
<p><strong>Sam Vega</strong>: You went home without your wife. Why?</p>
<p><strong>Felix Rodriguez</strong>: I hate dry chicken and small talk. And more than anything, I hate dancing. So, I went home, and I passed out on the couch. Next thing I know, you guys are banging on my front door. Where's Liz? </p>
<p><strong>Sam Vega</strong>: Do you always leave your wife on the dance floor?</p>
<p><strong>Felix Rodriguez</strong>: Liz is out every night at some charitable function, saving the world. We have a deal. If I make an appearance, I get to duck out early.</p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
[INT. COUNTRY CLUB – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Elizabeth and Felix are dancing. Felix yawns, bored.) </p>
<p><strong>Felix Rodriguez</strong>: You know what? I've done my time. I think I'm going home.</p>
<p><strong>Elizabeth Rodriguez</strong>: All right, well, don't wait up for me.</p>
<p>(He kisses her hands.) </p>
<p><strong>Felix Rodriguez</strong>: Mmm.</p>
<p><strong>Elizabeth Rodriguez</strong>: And I'll miss you.</p>
<p>(He kisses her cheek and heads off the dance floor.) </p>
<p>END OF FLASHBACK.</p>
<p><strong>Felix Rodriguez</strong>: Look, if you don't tell me what's going on, I'll need to talk to my lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Vega</strong>: Your wife was murdered last night.</p>
<p>(Felix turns and looks at him, stunned.) </p>
<p><strong>Felix Rodriguez</strong>: What?</p>
<p>(The officer outside opens the door and Greg walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Sam Vega</strong>: Mr. Rodriguez, this is CSI Sanders. He's here to take your fingerprints and your clothes.</p>
<p>(Greg puts the print card down on the table.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Please stand up.</p>
<p>(Felix Rodriguez is still in shock.) </p>
<p><strong>Felix Rodriguez</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Sam Vega</strong>: Mr. Rodriguez, stand up.</p>
<p><strong>Felix Rodriguez</strong>: I want to see my wife. </p>
<p><strong>Sam Vega</strong>: When we're finished here, we'll talk about it. Stand up, please.</p>
<p>(He stands up. Greg starts to take his fingerprints.) </p>
<p><strong>Felix Rodriguez</strong>: I didn't kill her. I loved my wife.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. PD – HALLWAY] </p>
<p>(Warrick steps out of the interview room and puts his jacket on. He rubs his tired eyes. He starts down the hallway.) </p>
<p>SLOW MOTION.</p>
<p>(At the other end of the hallway Lou Gedda turns the corner. Warrick looks up and sees him. They walk past each other. Gedda smiles as he leaves.) </p>
<p>(Warrick stops to watch him go. He turns and sees where Gedda came out from and finds Brass leaning against the doorframe watching him.) </p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[INT. PD – BRASS' OFFICE] </p>
<p>(Brass talks with Grissom. Brass is standing up behind his desk while Grissom is seated in front of it.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You should have put him in your car and driven him home.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I have to trust the people I work with, Jim.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Look, Warrick's a loose cannon. We both know that. He was in Gedda's strip club ... </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He was off the clock.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: ... conducting his own police investigation.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He's very passionate about this case.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, passionate enough to sleep with the vic who ended up dead in his car. Look, I know Warrick didn't have anything to do with it, but he needs to back off. Guys like Lou Gedda -- they don't skip on murder and extortion by being lucky.</p>
<p>(Brass sits down. Grissom looks at Brass.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What does that mean? You think Gedda's got &quot;friends&quot; inside the department?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (nods a little) Well, unlike Warrick, I don't make accusations until I have proof.</p>
<p>(Grissom is quiet.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – GARAGE] </p>
<p>(Grissom is fuming inside Warrick's car.) </p>
<p>(Warrick passes by and sees Grissom working in the car. He enters the garage.) </p>
<p>(Grissom gets out of the car.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey, Grissom.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did you talk to IA yet?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah. They cleared me. They didn't seem to have much interest in Gedda.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's because it wasn't about Gedda. It was about you.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It's everything to do with Gedda. Sending me a message. Murders an innocent young girl because I got too close to them. I want this case, Gris.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I hope you know that's not gonna happen. You're in the rotation as of tomorrow, so go home.</p>
<p>(Warrick leaves. Grissom pauses and watches him go.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – HALLWAY] </p>
<p>(Hodges reports his findings to Catherine. He hands her the report.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: The white flaky trace on your victim's feet was permethrin, an insect repellent, also used in flea dips.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mmm. She was found with a bunch of dead dogs. What about the husband's tux?</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: No flea dip, no dog hairs, no blood. Just a little bit of champagne and some underarm deodorant.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You just exonerated our only suspect.</p>
<p>(Catherine walks out of frame.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – DNA LAB] </p>
<p>(Wendy is running the samples. Hodges walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: So how crazy was last night? You. Me. Dinner?</p>
<p><strong>Wendy</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: I thought the Syrah was quite nice.</p>
<p>(Wendy turns to get another sample.) </p>
<p><strong>Wendy</strong>: Yes, and thank you for offering to split the check. My date really appreciated it.</p>
<p>(Hodges follows her.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Oh, no problem. Let it be known, that I am nothing if not a gentleman.</p>
<p>(She turns around and finds Hodges right behind her.) </p>
<p><strong>Wendy</strong>: Why were you at a restaurant like Nob Hill by yourself anyway?</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: The Golden Rule. Always treat yourself the way you would like others to treat you.</p>
<p><strong>Wendy</strong>: That's not exactly the rule.</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: What are you working on?</p>
<p>(Hodges is looking at the multiple swabs Wendy is running.) </p>
<p><strong>Wendy</strong>: The Elizabeth Rodriguez homicide. She had bite marks on her with saliva in them, and the saliva turned out to be canine, and anytime a dog is impounded in a criminal case, its DNA is collected and profiled.</p>
<p>(She turns on the CANINE CODIS.) </p>
<p><strong>Wendy</strong>: It's just like CODIS.</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: DODIS.</p>
<p>(Wendy chuckles.) </p>
<p><strong>Wendy</strong>: Anyway most of the cases in the database are gang-related. But I figured, well, it's worth a shot.</p>

<p>(Greg closes the file folder and picks up the keys. He dusts the key for prints. He finds one.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – HALLWAY] </p>
<p>(Greg reports his findings to Nick.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Steve Card was lying when he said he was the only one with the key to the drug cabinet. Elizabeth had one, too.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Means the killer could have used her key.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Got a print.</p>
<p>(Greg hands the file to Nick. The print belongs to TOMMY HALPERT.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. PD – HALLWAY OUTSIDE / INTERVIEW ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Tommy Halpert is sitting in the interview room as Nick waits outside.) </p>
<p><strong>DDA Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: (o.s.) Nick.</p>
<p>(Nick turns and sees Jeffrey Sinclair walk up to him.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey. We ... uh ... we can't really talk to him yet. He's still waiting for his lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>DDA Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: He's waiting for me.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>DDA Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: He's a confidential informant. The DA's investigating Steve Card, Gino Aquino, Elizabeth Rodriguez, everybody associated with the dogfighting ring.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (nods) So you knew about this?</p>
<p><strong>DDA Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: Knowing about it and proving it are two different things.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay. (scoffs) Okay, so what's this guy's story?</p>
<p><strong>DDA Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: Same old-- he... used to ride with the D-Streeters, shot his old man when he was 15, did four years in juvie, got out, tried to turn his life around. We busted him 18 months ago for possession and assault. He cut a deal.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So he's got a history of violence. You think he killed Mrs. Rodriguez?</p>
<p><strong>DDA Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: It took me over a year to get him inside that dogfighting ring. I'm reserving judgment.</p>
<p>(Nick nods. They enter the room.) </p>
<p>(Tommy looks up as they walk in.) </p>
<p><strong>Tommy Halpert</strong>: I did the best that I could.</p>
<p><strong>DDA Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: I'm sure you did, Tommy.</p>
<p><strong>Tommy Halpert</strong>: And I told you what they were doing to those dogs and I gave you all the tapes.</p>
<p><strong>DDA Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: It wasn't enough. We needed to see the dogs fighting; that's the felony.</p>
<p><strong>Tommy Halpert</strong>: But they had the fights in different places. I mean, she never told me where they were, s-so ...</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Tommy, did you kill Elizabeth Rodriguez?</p>
<p>(Tommy looks at Nick.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I, I could understand if you did. A whole lot of people that would say she had it coming.</p>
<p>(Nick sits down.) </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Elizabeth hits one of the dogs as Tommy watches. End flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Tommy Halpert</strong>: You know, I've been on the streets ... in juvie. I've seen people do some bad things to each other, but those dogs, like ... you can beat their brains in and, like, a minute later they come up to you just wagging their tails.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I know, man. That's how they are. I always had dogs growing up. Did you?</p>
<p><strong>Tommy Halpert</strong>: No, I never had a pet. My mom was allergic.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No, but you really cared about those dogs at the kennel. Now, I know. I saw the way you treated them.</p>
<p><strong>Tommy Halpert</strong>: Do you know how they train them?</p>
<p>(Nick shakes his head, no.) </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: A dog runs on a treadmill.) </p>
<p><strong>Tommy</strong>: (V.O.) They'd run them till they dropped.</p>
<p>(CUT TO: The dog jumps up to grab a piece of meat hanging in the air.) </p>
<p><strong>Tommy</strong>: (V.O.) They'd strengthen their jaws.</p>
<p>(CUT TO: Elizabeth picks up a small poodle.) </p>
<p><strong>Tommy</strong>: (V.O.) Then, they would feed them little dogs, sometimes cats ...</p>
<p>(She puts the poodle in the bigger dog's cage.) </p>
<p><strong>Tommy</strong>: (V.O.) ... just to give them the taste of blood.</p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Tommy</strong>: (accusing) And I showed you what she did and you did nothing to stop her.</p>
<p>(He's crying.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No. No, but you did.</p>
<p>(He looks at Nick.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Didn't you?</p>
<p>(Tommy nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Tommy Halpert</strong>: She was fighting dogs. All right, she was ... she was killing dogs in the ring for money week after week. And the city decides to give her an award? I gave her what she really deserved.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Tommy hits Elizabeth on the back of her head. He straps her onto the wooden contraption, then injects her.) </p>
<p>(She groans and passes out.) </p>
<p>(Tommy drags her into the kennel and opens the pit bull's cage.) </p>
<p><strong>Tommy</strong>: Go on! Go on! Go on! </p>
<p>(The dog runs over and attacks Elizabeth. He opens another cage) </p>
<p><strong>Tommy</strong>: Go get her! </p>
<p>(He opens more cages.) </p>
<p>(Tommy watches as the dogs attack Elizabeth.) </p>
<p>END FLASHBACK.</p>
<p><strong>Tommy Halpert</strong>: At least I had the decency to euthanize her before I threw her to the dogs.</p>
<p>(Nick is quiet.) </p>

<p>(Nick and Catherine walk through the hallway.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, you don't look like a guy who just got a confession.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Oh ... something's still bugging me. If Mr. Rodriguez hadn't left the party, Elizabeth might still be alive.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You think he would have gone to the kennel with her?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I don't know, but he received a phone call from somebody that night that made him leave his wife.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Check the phone records.</p>

<p><strong>Felix Rodriguez</strong>: Detective Vega, Mr. Stokes. Did you catch the man who killed my wife?</p>
<p><strong>Sam Vega</strong>: Yes, sir. Tommy Halpert. We have him in custody now.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, witnesses at the party said that you received a phone call the night of the murder and then you just left. We know that phone call was from Tommy Halpert.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [INT. COUNTRY CLUB – NIGHT] Felix checks his cell phone and closes it. He kisses his wife and leaves her on the dance floor.) </p>
<p>END FLASHBACK.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What'd you two talk about?</p>
<p><strong>Felix Rodriguez</strong>: Tommy said if I didn't speak to my wife that night, he would ... </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Speak to your wife about what?</p>
<p><strong>Felix Rodriguez</strong>: The dog fighting. He showed me the tapes.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [INT. CAR] Tommy shows Felix Rodriguez the dogfighting tapes.) </p>
<p>END FLASHBACK.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Vega</strong>: What did Elizabeth say when you confronted her?</p>
<p><strong>Felix Rodriguez</strong>: I didn't.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So you just left her there, knowing that Tommy was going to come after her?</p>
<p><strong>Felix Rodriguez</strong>: Violence begets violence. Is that all?</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: She worked at Pigalle.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Dorsey</strong>: They all look the same to me.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No, they don't. There's blondes, brunettes, B-cups, D-cups.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Dorsey</strong>: How about a cup of coffee, huh? Hey, you got a cigarette I could bum off you?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: It's bad for your health. How about a diet soda?</p>
<p><strong>Richard Dorsey</strong>: Diet? No. No diet. I need the ups.</p>

<p><strong>Joanna &quot;Candy&quot;</strong>: Hey! Give me my purse! Give me my purse!</p>

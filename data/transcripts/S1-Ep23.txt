<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Camera holds over the city. Thunder rumbles; lightning flashes in the sky.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. SATURN ARMS APARTMENTS - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The front left glass door is open. Building number 5595. Thunder rumbles outside.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. SATURN ARMS - EILEEN SNOW'S APT - HALLWAY -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Camera moves slowly down the hallway toward the bedroom door. There's a bicycle resting against the wall in the hallway; the light from outside illuminates the bathroom. Lightning flashes.)</p>
<p>(The camera turns the corner and enters the bedroom. There's someone asleep in the bed. The camera lingers in the doorway.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. SATURN ARMS - EILEEN SNOW'S BEDROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(EILEEN SNOW suddenly gets up. She sits up in bed and looks out the open bedroom door. Thunder rumbles; lightning flashes.)</p>
<p>(She looks outside the bedroom window, then around the bedroom. The closet light is on. She lies back down in bed, leans on her side and tries to go back to sleep.)</p>
<p>(Again, she suddenly gets up in bed. Thunder claps outside as lightning flashes through the window. She swallows as she stares straight ahead at the shadows in front of her.)</p>
<p>(Lightning flashes. This time, there's a man holding a cord in his hands and standing at the foot of the bed. He's wearing a hooded sweatshirt that covers his face.)</p>
<p>(EILEEN SNOW starts screaming. The man snaps the iron cord. EILEEN SNOW backs away from him.)</p>
<p>(The iron falls.)</p>
<p>(EILEEN SNOW screams.)</p>
<p>FLASH TO WHITE:</p>
<hr />
[INT. SATURN ARMS - EILEEN SNOW'S BEDROOM -- MORNING]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks into the bedroom carrying his kit. BRASS follows behind him. There are other officers already in the room. Though we can't see the body, GRISSOM pauses near the bed, his eyes glued to the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Eileen Jane Snow. Lady she carpools with couldn't get her to answer the door. Police broke in.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (grimly) This is exactly the same as the last two.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Audrey Hayes was strangled in her basement and the other one ended up in a park.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Different M.O., but it's the same signature.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: M.O. is how he breaks in. Signature's what he does once inside.</p>
<p>(A Camera flashes. Close up of EILEEN SNOW on the bed. Her hands are tied together to the bed metal headboard. Her mouth is bruised. Her eyes are open. Cut back to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Three or four overpowering blows to the head from a homemade weapon fashioned at the scene. </p>
<p>(A camera flash to: Close up of the iron used to subdue EILEEN SNOW. Cut back to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Forces her to drink a mixture of sodium amytal as a chemical restraint. </p>
<p>(Flash to white. Close up of the drinking glass discarded on it's side.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Overligature of the victim ... (he swallows) ... and an object rape. Then he strangles her. Ejaculates on the bedsheets. </p>
<p>(SARA walks in and sees the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And as a final act of degradation he poses her like a pinup.</p>
<p>(She reacts to the sight of yet another body in a series of serial rapes.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Damn it.</p>
<p>(BRASS turns around to look at SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Sara.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Damn that guy.</p>
<p>(SARA starts to walk out of the bedroom. GRISSOM follows her outside to the hallway.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. SATURN ARMS - EILEEN SNOW'S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes SARA out into the hallway.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Listen, no emotions in here.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: He's escalating, Grissom.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's the pattern; it's a continuum. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Guess he wants to get caught.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Signature killers never want to get caught. And they won't stop until they do.</p>

<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<hr />
[INT. SATURN ARMS -- EILEEN SNOW'S BEDROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(SARA and WARRICK are in the bedroom near the bed. SARA is looking at the tape lift in her hand; WARRICK is going through the sheets on the bed.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I have tape-lifted, roll-lifted -- I'm not finding one hair.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks into the room and lingers near the door. He's carrying a clipboard as he watches them work.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (raises his eyebrows) I wonder what that might mean.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: He vacuumed this place before he left. We've established that he utilizes materials from the victim's domicile.</p>
<p>(Thinking about it, SARA walks over to the closet to look for the vacuum cleaner. She pushes the closet door open to reveal the vacuum cleaner just inside. GRISSOM leans over to look at the bedside table. WARRICK continues to check the bed sheets. SARA opens the machine and looks inside.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey, guys. He took the bag.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM shakes his head.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, look for prints.</p>
<p>(Before she can do anything, CATHERINE walks in. She's carrying something that looks for prints and is wearing protective eyewear.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Don't bother. There aren't any. Just like the last time. The guy's Mr. Clean. Here, knock yourself out.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE hands it over to SARA who takes it.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He stalked this woman. He knew how much time he had in this apartment to kill her, and to clean up after himself.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'll tell Brass to check for s*x offenders in a two-mile radius.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, have him check peeping toms, too five years back. That's how they get started.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE turns to leave the room. WARRICK looks up from his spot near the bed.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Peeping toms to murderers?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's about crossing boundaries. It's like, uh, with cake, you know? You're just going to have a little bit of the frosting and you end up eating the entire plate.</p>
<p>(WARRICK pulls the bed cover aside. He sees a single hair strand.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Nobody move. </p>
<p>(He picks it up and holds it up.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Mr. Clean needs a maid. I'm going to take this back to the lab.</p>
<p>(SHERIFF BRIAN MOBLEY walks up to the door and looks around. He sees GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: Gil. I need a word with you outside.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM sighs. The SHERIFF leaves. GRISSOM glances over at WARRICK.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. SATURN ARMS -- DAY]</p>
<p>(THE SHERIFF walks out of the apartment. GRISSOM is close behind him. The SHERIFF is headed somewhere.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You're bringing the FBI in? Why?</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: They offered their assistance, and I'm inclined to take it. Of course, uh, I'd want to make sure you're okay with that.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM puts his sunglasses on. In the background, we hear people from the news media talking.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I-I don't believe the investigation should go that way, Brian. I mean, roadblocks and special ops?</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: Oh, that's a pity, 'cause I do. Maybe you'll feel different when you meet Rick Culpepper.</p>
<p>(A man in a suit approaches them. He holds out his hand to the Sheriff. Behind him standing just behind the crime scene tape is the news media.)</p>
<p><strong>Agent Rick Culpepper</strong>: Sheriff Mobley.</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: Rick.</p>
<p>(They shake hands. AGENT RICK CULPEPPER turns to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Agent Rick Culpepper</strong>: Hi, Rick Culpepper. Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
<p>(They shake hands.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Gil Grissom, Agent Culpepper.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Rick Culpepper</strong>: Uh, &quot;Special Agent&quot;. It's great to meet you. All our kids back in Quantico are always going on about your bugs.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM doesn't say anything. AGENT RICK CULPEPPER takes off his sunglasses and looks at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Agent Rick Culpepper</strong>: Well, listen, the FBI is here to help you and your people at CSI. Of course, uh, as SAC, the investigation will run through me. Sheriff probably already told you that.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM glances at the SHERIFF standing silently next to him.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No, he didn't mention that, either.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Rick Culpepper</strong>: All rivers run through Rome so to speak. (chuckling) But, uh, you get an &quot;attaboy&quot;. Three women dead 'cause you couldn't get the job done. There's not many guys who would hand the case over to us Fibbies.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm not handing it over. I'm willing to work in conjunction with you.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Culpepper</strong>: Well, that's fine. We'll work the &quot;Strip Strangler&quot; case in conjunction.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The what?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Rick Culpepper</strong>: He strangles them near Las Vegas Boulevard then removes their clothes. Strip Strangler. Why? What do you call him?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Unknown Signature Homicide, Metropolitan Las Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Rick Culpepper</strong>: (to SHERIFF) Oh. He's not kidding, is he?</p>
<p>(THE SHERIFF shakes his head.) </p>
<p><strong>Sgt. O'Riley</strong>: (to GRISSOM) Excuse me. Guy over here's got something you might want to hear. Syd Goggle. He's a security guard. Community patrol. Says he saw a man speeding away from here last night.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM follows SGT. O'RILEY to the security guard. He approaches the crowd behind the yellow police tape.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mr., Uh, Goggle? Gil Grissom.</p>
<p>(SYD GOGGLE is let through the police tape.)</p>
<p><strong>Syd Goggle</strong>: (to GRISSOM) I know who you are, sir. I've seen you on TV.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Rick Culpepper</strong>: Special Agent Culpepper. You have information for us, sir? About a man fleeing the scene?</p>
<p><strong>Syd Goggle</strong>: (to GRISSOM) I didn't get his license. I didn't think of it till this morning. But He was really burning rubber, though.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Would you please give Detective O'Riley a full statement? If we have any more questions, we'll get back to you.</p>
<p><strong>Syd Goggle</strong>: Listen, if you need any help in your investigation, Mr. Grissom ... </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (interrupting) The last time a security guard tried to help me, he ended up dead. But thank you.</p>
<p>(SYD GOGGLE walks past GRISSOM and follows SGT. O'RILEY.)</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. O'Riley</strong>: This way.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns to the other two men.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm late for an autopsy.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns and leaves. AGENT RICK CULPEPPER puts his sunglasses back on and watches GRISSOM leave.)</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: He'll need a little patience.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Rick Culpepper</strong>: Wouldn't respect him if he didn't.</p>
<p>(Both men head back toward the apartments.)</p>

[INT. CSI -- FORENSIC AUTOPSY ROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(DR. ROBBINS goes over the body with NICK and GRISSOM.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What can you tell us?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Nothing you don't know. Trauma to the head with a blunt object. Overwhelmed her. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: In the bedroom, the intruder hits Eileen Snow. Hard. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: He got a mixture of sodium amytal in her.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: A hypnotic.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: In the bedroom, EILEEN SNOW is out on the bed. The intruder is straddled across her as he forces the liquid down her throat. End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Allowed him to control her for up to six hours. Torture her. Look at the bruises. </p>
<p>(He points to the purple bruises on her face and neck. GRISSOM leans in to look.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Purple means she was alive for all of it.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: In the bedroom, the intruder strangles EILEEN SNOW. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Percussive control.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He choked her unconscious and then brought her to multiple times. What about the rape?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Same as the others: Indeterminate object caused severe internal lacerations. </p>
<p>(DR. ROBBINS turns back to get the sample.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: I did find a small trace of something creviced in the uterine wall. Looks like an everyday polymer to me.</p>
<p>(He hands it over to NICK to look at.)</p>
<p>(Camera zooms in for a close up of the item. Broken piece of unknown object with the letters &quot;THA&quot; on it.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay. I'll go back to the scene, try to find something like it.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (warning) Be careful, Nicky. The cliché's true. Signatures return to their scenes.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Will do.</p>
<p>(NICK turns and leaves.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Are we done?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Something we didn't find with the other two women. </p>
<p>(DR. ROBBINS turns around and picks up a single strand of cotton fiber. He hands it to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Fibers. One in the back of her throat. </p>
<p>(Camera CGI POV close up of a fiber stuck in between two teeth. Flash to white. Resume GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: One stuck between her lower molars.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This looks like cotton. Maybe terry cloth. </p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Hmmm.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM glances at the body, then back at the fiber.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Could be silencing them with ... white bath towels?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Well, it would explain why no one hears the victim's screams.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He brings it with him and takes it away after. So, somewhere, there's evidence of this victim on a towel.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Kind of a forensic smoking gun.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mmm. Now we just have to find the guy and hope that he hasn't done his laundry.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>

[INT. CSI - DNA LAB - DAY]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE is in GREG'S lab. GREG reaches over to get the file folder.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: The semen taken from this morning's homicide matches the semen taken from the bedsheets of the last two female victims.</p>
<p>(GREG opens the file folder and takes out a sheet of paper. He hands it to CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, we're looking at the same guy.</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Yeah, but, check this out. The ejaculate sample.</p>
<p>(GREG points to the microscope. CATHERINE looks at the sample through the scope.) </p>
<p>[SCOPE VIEW] of the white ejaculate with splotches of red</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What's the red stuff?</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Mystery substance.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Not blood?</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, what, this guy's got some strange chemical in his mutated DNA?</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Freaky, huh?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE sighs and turns to leave the lab. As she leaves, she turns around.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Freakiest semen I've seen in a while. Call me.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE steps out of the DNA lab and nearly bumps into the SHERIFF in the hallway. Literally.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(The SHERIFF looks at CATHERINE.) </p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: Catherine, you busy? I was hoping we might be able to talk about a few things.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Pertaining to the case?</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: As a jumping-off point.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, Sheriff, I'd say let's go to my office, but I don't have one.</p>
<p>(The SHERIFF glances behind him and says slyly.)</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: Well, that's just the sort of thing I was hoping we would discuss.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>

[INT. CSI - TRACE LAB - DAY]</p>
<p>[SCOPE VIEW] of the blunt tip of a strand of hair.</p>
<p>(SARA looks up from the scope, a bit puzzled by the conclusions she's reaching. She turns and sees WARRICK walking by the lab door. She calls out to him.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey, Warrick you got a second?</p>
<p>(WARRICK turns and walks into the lab.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What's up?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I got this hair that you guys found this morning and I'm trying to compare it to the one hair we recovered from the murder last week - the Hayes girl?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: And you got a match microscopically but it doesn't mean a damn thing<br />
'cause it still doesn't lead us to the guy?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No. I can't even tell if we have a DNA match. There's no skin tag on either one.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Whoa, whoa, whoa. A girl defending herself against a guy is going to pull that hair out by the roots. </p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV. Close up of female hand grabbing hair and ripping it out. Cut to: Microscopic close up of the skin tag at the root of the hair.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (V.O.) I mean, you get scalp skin filled with DNA.</p>
<p>(End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(SARA is looking at the hair through the scope again.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No scalp, no skin. It's almost like this hair was ...</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: ... shed?</p>
<p>(He nods. Then the pagers start beeping. Both SARA and WARRICK reach for their pagers.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Mine.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Mine.</p>
<p>(They both check the numbers of the pagers.)</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, Gil, you want to give me the skinny on this meeting of yours? I'm on my way back to the crime scene. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What meeting? I'm going to evidence.</p>
<p>(He points in front of him.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (shrugs) I got paged about the signature case.</p>
<p>(SARA and WARRICK catch up with GRISSOM and NICK on their way to the meeting.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey, Warrick and I just got a break. The guy's been planting hairs.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Shedding. He's trying to throw us off. What he doesn't realize, we got no DNA on the hairs so we can't chase down his other suspect.</p>
<p>(On the far end of the hall in front of them, GRISSOM sees some Federal Agents entering a conference room. He doesn't like the conclusions he's reaching.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Grissom ... are you hearing us?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM approaches the door. AGENT RICK CULPEPPER and several Federal Agents are in the room and around the table.)</p>

[INT. CSI - LAYOUT ROOM - DAY -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM slowly walks into the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Agent Rick Culpepper</strong>: You all got my page. Good.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I didn't.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Rick Culpepper</strong>: (brushes it aside) We'll get you a new battery. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM is getting angry at the games these people are playing.)</p>
<p><strong>Agent Rick Culpepper</strong>: (continues) I thought we'd convo about the strangler. Hear what you've got tell you what we think our next move should be.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns to his team.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (softly) Would you guys go back to my office, please? I'll be in in a few minutes. </p>
<p>(WARRICK, NICK and SARA turn and leave the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'll be happy to pass on any pertinent information you may have to my team.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Rick Culpepper</strong>: Okay. Fine. Got anything to report to us?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You first.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Rick Culpepper</strong>: Okay. We have an operation in place. Your CSI, Sidle, has expressed an interest to my agents in availing herself. I wanted to let you know before we made the official offer.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Really? What kind of operation?</p>
<p><strong>Agent Rick Culpepper</strong>: All this talk about your great capacity for observation. Sara Sidle matches the victim prototype to a &quot;T.&quot; She's a young woman, brunette, tall for a female.</p>
<p>(SARA walks back to the room. As if sensing her return, GRISSOM turns to look back at her. SARA meets his gaze. GRISSOM turns back to CULPEPPER.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You're not serious. </p>
<p><strong>Agent Rick Culpepper</strong>: And by all reports, she's steady. Has the right personality for a decoy operation.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You're going to bait this guy with a human being? This is your big FBI plan </p>
<p><strong>Agent Rick Culpepper</strong>: Before he kills again, yes. Got a better idea?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Understanding him first, completely, so that we can get out ahead of him.</p>
<p>(Behind him, SARA is getting impatient at what he's saying.)</p>
<p><strong>Agent Rick Culpepper</strong>: And if he kills again while we're trying to understand him? </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, I'm sorry, but he's not going to kill my CSI.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM indicates SARA behind him.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (interrupting) I'm going to do it, Grissom. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns around, surprised.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I want to.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You want to put yourself in the path of a psychotic killer?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'm trained in weaponless defense.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Too bad, because that's what turns him on -- women fighting back. Gives him a greater sense of power when he makes his final kill.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Grissom ... </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (abruptly) Sit down, Sara.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns back to CULPEPPER, who is vastly amused by the exchange he just witnessed. SARA moves to take a seat. GRISSOM looks at CULPEPPER.)</p>
<p><strong>Agent Rick Culpepper</strong>: Okay. If we're to follow your line of thinking are you out ahead of him?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Not yet. He knows just enough about forensics to be dangerous. He thinks he's throwing us off track by planting confederate hairs. He probably shaves his head maybe his entire body as DNA protection.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He may gag his victims using a garden-variety bath towel which he then takes with him as part of his murder kit. He will go after another tall brunette and the torture will be worse. But this time, he won't ejaculate. At least not at the scene.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Rick Culpepper</strong>: At home, later. He's learning control.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Think he knows his next victim?</p>
<p>(Without looking at her and still watching CULPEPPER, GRISSOM answers her.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Signature killers always know their next victim. But they don't know him </p>
<p>(GRISSOM suddenly turns to look directly at SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: ... until he tortures, rapes and kills them.</p>

<p>(NICK walks to the door of EILEEN SNOW'S bedroom. He puts his kit down on the floor near the doorway, then pauses as he takes a deep breath before entering the bedroom. He shines his flashlight into the room and looks around at the bare bed, stripped of its sheets. The window next to it is open. NICK walks into the room.)</p>
<p>(He looks around. The closet light is on. NICK doesn't pay too much attention to it. He continues to circle the room and look around.)</p>
<p>(NICK walks up to the chair in front of the window and kneels down. He sees something on the floor near the chair cover and picks it up. He looks at it. It appears to be a piece of latex.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The intruder puts on a pair of latex gloves. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(NICK hears something creak and turns around to look.)</p>
<p>(He looks at the closet. The closet light is off. NICK shines the flashlight into the closet. He stands and slowly approaches the closet door. When he gets close enough, he reaches out a hand to push the door open.)</p>
<p>(At the same time, a woman appears inside the closet, the closet light goes on, and everyone screams in surprise.)</p>
<p>(NICK takes a step back.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Freeze!</p>
<p>(LYNDA DARBY takes a step back into the closet. She bumps her back against the hanging clothes and holds up her hands showing that all she has in her right hand is a digital camera.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p>(NICK gets a good look at her and motions for her to get out.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Get out of there. Get out of the closet.</p>
<p><strong>Lynda Darby</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p>(LYNDA DARBY steps out of the closet.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Lynda Darby</strong>: Um, I a reporter. What? We know the police are withholding information from us, so I came down here because ... </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (interrupts) All right. Quiet. Quiet. Are you out of your mind? I could've killed you. This is a crime scene. You don't belong here. Unless you want me to get the cop at the front door you'll get out of here now. And I'd better not see any pictures of this apartment in your paper ... or I'll have the D.A. on your front door.</p>
<p><strong>Lynda Darby</strong>: I'm sorry that I scared you.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You didn't scare me. (shakes his head) Mm-mm.</p>
<p><strong>Lynda Darby</strong>: Want to tell me what you found over by the window?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: When we zig, he zags.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, well, he's not as smart as he thinks, you know? I mean, ketchup is not going to mask the DNA in his semen.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: All of which I'm sure you'll share with the FBI.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm sure.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey ... is it so bad to avail our lab to the resources of the federal government?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM stares at CATHERINE and at her choice of words.)</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, yeah, I know. And if I don't shape up he going to have Ecklie take over the case.</p>

<p>(BRASS sits down in his chair.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: And, uh, he had the latex hands. And he's a serial.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Millander stages suicides in bathtubs with paternal figures. This guy's signature is overkill rage against young women. It's completely different.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Maybe our brethren at the FBI have some sort of special database.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (surprised) When did you become friendly with the Feds? I didn't think you had that in you.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Never make an enemy when you can just as easily make a friend. FBI's okay. I've kissed worse ass. But I've got to say I don't like this decoy op the Feds are talking up. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM leans forward in his chair. Suddenly, this conversation really interests him.)</p>

<p><strong>Agent Rick Culpepper</strong>: Oh ... it's three hours expended. (clears throat.)<br />
Maybe we should reposition over at that Borders book store. Gets a lot of foot traffic in there according to the field agents.</p>

<p>(The SHOPPER tucks the cigarette on his right ear. SARA looks up at him.)</p>

<p><strong>Brad Walden</strong>: I like ... to gamble. She liked to read. It was, you know ... just the perfect getaway.</p>
<p>(The door opens and GRISSOM walks in.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You liked to play golf, too.</p>
<p>(CULPEPPER watches as GRISSOM brings in a hard golf club case. He sets it up near the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: These are your golf clubs. We found them in your hotel room. I prefer a titanium driver, Mr. Walden. I'd like to see what you use, but your carrier is locked.</p>
<p><strong>Brad Walden</strong>: Yeah, I have a key on my keychain ... my car keys.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So you won't mind opening it, though?</p>
<p><strong>Brad Walden</strong>: No ... </p>
<p>(BRAD WALDEN reaches into his pants pocket to get the keys.)</p>
<p><strong>Brad Walden</strong>: uh, uh, w-why?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, so I can see if the leather on your club handles matches the leather from the object used to violate your wife.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM holds up a baggie with the leather sample in it to show BRAD WALDEN. CULPEPPER takes the baggie and looks at it. BRAD WALDEN stands up and unlocks the golf case.)</p>
<p><strong>Brad Walden</strong>: Well, I-I, you know, if it does ... I read that this, uh ... this, uh, you know, character uses whatever is at the scene of the crime for, uh ... for killing his victims.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes out a golf club. Realizing where GRISSOMS is going with this, CULPEPPER looks at WALDEN in a new light. GRISSOM puts the club on the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, if this &quot;character&quot; ... killed your wife? How did he get your clubs out of the case without the keys? </p>
<p>(One by one, GRISSOM looks for the club.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Or, for that matter back into the case after he killed your wife?</p>

<p><strong>Agent Rick Culpepper</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: For the murder of his wife, maybe but I am certain that he didn't do the others.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Rick Culpepper</strong>: Every piece of the signature is there.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (sighs) He read the papers -- he piggybacked on top of the killer.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Rick Culpepper</strong>: For what possible reason?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Who knows? Convenient way out of a lousy marriage? He's not our guy.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Rick Culpepper</strong>: You know, this is where I like to reference the majesty and the power of the Republic of the United States of America.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Go ahead. Pull rank. But that hotel crime scene was staged to look like the signature's.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Rick Culpepper</strong>: And that golfer just got lucky that the victim type fits his wife to a Texas T, is that it?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: If you stop and think, you'll see it.</p>
<p><strong>Agent Rick Culpepper</strong>: Duly noted, Supervisor Grissom. </p>

We believe that Bradley Mac Walden found and stalked these victims, and ...</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks into the conference room and takes the seat next to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (softly) I just talked with Brass. He said that Walden was having an affair with a dentist in his office.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm telling you, this guy did not kill those other women.</p>
<p>(Overhearing GRISSOM, the reporter sitting in the seat two rows in front of him turns around to look back at GRISSOM. It's LYNDA DARBY.)</p>
<p><strong>Agent Rick Culpepper</strong>: This statement is concluded. Las Vegas, its locals and visitors can rest a little easier tonight. A suspect is in custody. Thank you. I'll take some questions.</p>
<p>(While the other media reporters raise their hands to be recognized by the AGENT on stage, LYNDA DARBY turns around and addresses GRISSOM.) </p>
<p><strong>Lynda Darby</strong>: Mr. Grissom-- LYNDA DARBY, Las Vegas Tribune. As the lead CSI on this case, do you have anything to add to the FBI statement?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (warning) Politics ...</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He's not viable, Brian.</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: Then further investigation will prove that out. In the meantime, people will feel better about their daily lives. Now, why on earth would you want to counteract that?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: For those who have to ask, no answer could suffice.</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: Look, I see we've come to an impasse. If further investigation determines that Walden didn't kill those other women then you can rejoin the investigation.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Oh, do I get the weekend off?</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: For starters ... and a two-week holiday ... anywhere but CSI. You brought this on yourself. Now, the next time you want to play with my career, maybe you'll think twice.</p>

He opens the fridge to get some water. He opens a prescription medication bottle and tips out a couple of tablets into the palm of his hand.)</p>
<p>(He swallows them and takes a sip of water. He sighs and caps the bottle up tight.)</p>
<p>(He puts his glasses on and opens the file in front of him and goes over the file.)</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Your door was open. You okay?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE picks up the prescription medication bottle and looks at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Migraine. It's been a while. </p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Tracy Berg.</p>

<p><strong>Hunter Baumgartner</strong>: I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, &quot;I don't know&quot; doesn't get it, pal. DNA's like fingerprints. No two samples are alike. You were in these women's bedrooms.</p>
<p><strong>Hunter Baumgartner</strong>: Believe me, Mister, the last place that you will find me is in a woman's bedroom. Unless we're discussing window treatments. Hey, and my indecent was for tricking too close to the boulevard. I don't know anything about killing women. That's straight boy stuff.</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (on phone) Yeah, well, there's no rubber here. On the pavement or curb. A coup of oil spots, that's about it. And I called Brass. Nobody took any photographs of any tire marks. Not the Las Vegas P.D. Not the Feds.</p>

<p>(GRISSOM doesn't say anything. He stares at the hair on SYD GOGGLE'S head. SYD notices it and calmly, boldly takes off his wig. He drops it on the table between them.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You were so meticulous about so many things. Shaving. The gloves. Planted evidence. That's why I don't understand why you'd bring towels that eventually could be tracked. </p>
<p><strong>Syd Goggle</strong>: I don't know what you're talking about.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Strong's gym. That's where the women told you to you to get lost, right? Stuffing club towels down their throat make your point?</p>
<p><strong>Syd Goggle</strong>: You know, the thing with women ... is they work out because they want us to look at them. And then they ... parade around. And you just want to ... say hello. </p>
<p>(As he talks, SYD folds the towel and wrings it in his hands, as if he's done this before.)</p>
<p><strong>Syd Goggle</strong>: Everybody knows white cotton fibers aren't like fingerprints. They can't be traced. You don't get a ... match on a towel.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: In theory. But the truth is every object is changed by its owner. By his habits. His ... washing machine, for instance. His detergent. </p>

<p>(SYD turns to look at the washing machine.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Now, see, that's going to leave distinctive marks on the fabric, Syd. And that's just the beginning. I've had a look at your garbage.</p>
<p><strong>Syd Goggle</strong>: (surprised, but pleased) You were in my apartment. Now, nothing from there's admissible in court.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Your garbage is in a public area ... plain sight. It's enough for me to get a warrant.</p>
<p>(SYD knows that he's caught. Things happen fast. The washing machine starts to make loud noises. GRISSOM turns to look in that direction. SYD grabs a wrench off of the nearby table with the tools on it. He swings. GRISSOM raises a hand to block the blow to his head and gets caught in the side of his arm. He goes down.)</p>
<p>(SYD drops the wrench and uses two hands to pick up a short-handled shovel. He raises it high above his head to swing. GRISSOM puts up a hand to block the blow when a gun is fired.)</p>

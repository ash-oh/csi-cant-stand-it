							<p>COLD OPEN: </p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) – NIGHT]</p>
<p>[INT. WAREHOUSE]</p>
<p>(A young woman is held captive with her wrists tied high above her head. Off screen, she hears faint slicing, and gurgling. She screams.) </p>
<p>(Blood squirts on her face and in her mouth. She coughs. Yuck.)</p>
<p>(Behind her, a man hacks off a dummy's head.) </p>
<p><strong>Zack Putrid (director)</strong>: (o.s.) Cut!</p>
<p>(She continues to cough.) </p>
<p><strong>Zack Putrid</strong>: (o.s.) Cut! Damn it!</p>
<p>(The bell rings and overhead lights turn on. The director, Zack Putrid, gets out of his chair.) </p>
<p><strong>Zack Putrid</strong>: Can somebody please get her a glass of water?! (He walks up to the actress.) What happened? Babe? What are you doing? Are you choking on the blood?</p>
<p>(She nods.) </p>
<p><strong>SFX Guy</strong>: I did what you told me to.</p>
<p><strong>Zack Putrid</strong>: Yeah, but this time, get it on her face, not in her mouth.</p>
<p><strong>SFX Guy</strong>: The mouth is part of the face.</p>
<p><strong>Zack Putrid</strong>: Yeah, I know, I know. But hit her from the side, from the side. And get plenty on the rack.</p>
<p>(The SFX guy turns and leaves. We hold on the two actors dressed as doctors – one giant man and Dickie Jones.) </p>
<p><strong>Giant Doctor</strong>: We're dying here.</p>
<p><strong>Dickie Jones</strong>: I'm going to go ring it.</p>
<p><strong>Giant Doctor</strong>: All right. Hey, grab me a bear claw.</p>
<p>(Dickie Jones heads off the set. He walks past Zack Putrid talking with the cameraman who is wearing a red baseball cap.) </p>
<p><strong>Zack Putrid (director)</strong>: How long have I known you, huh? This is you and me. Get the shot -- not too tight. Wide enough to fit in the fun bags.</p>
<p>(The director turns back to the actress, who is still tied up with her arms over her head as the fake blood is being wiped off her. Her make-up is being retouched.) </p>
<p><strong>Zack Putrid (director)</strong>: Baby-cakes ...</p>
<p>(The actor playing the killer interrupts them.) </p>
<p><strong>Killer Actor</strong>: (to the director) Where was I? Want me to laugh?</p>
<p><strong>Zack Putrid (director)</strong>: Don't laugh. You were scary. Get away.</p>
<p>(The killer leaves.) </p>
<p><strong>Zack Putrid (director)</strong>: Honey, this time, don't inhale the blood, okay? All right, let's get her cleaned up. Let's shoot this bitch.</p>
<p>(He heads back to his chair. The actress gasps loudly.) </p>
<p><strong>Actress</strong>: (o.s.) Oh ...</p>
<p><strong>Zack Putrid (director)</strong>: Not you, baby. The shot. The shot's a bitch. I love one-ers. And you know what else I love? I love sushi. Me, too. Do you want to go for sushi?</p>
<p>(In the background, Stanley Vespucci leads Brass through the set. Nick follows them.) </p>
<p><strong>Stanley Vespucci</strong>: Our lead actress, Weatherly Adams, had her dressing room violated last night.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So she's the one you suspect is missing?</p>
<p><strong>Stanley Vespucci</strong>: She missed her call this morning. The woman is nothing if not professional. She's predictably precisely 35 minutes late every day. You could set your watch to it. She's already ... three hours late and still no sign of her.</p>
<p>(He looks at his watch.) </p>
<p>(A light blows out as they pass.) </p>
<p><strong>Stanley Vespucci</strong>: Nothing to worry about, gentlemen. It's just a bad bulb. If you will, please, follow me.</p>
<p>(He leads them out.) </p>
<p>[INT. WEATHERLY ADAMS' DRESSING ROOM – CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(He opens the dressing room door.) </p>
<p><strong>Stanley Vespucci</strong>: Here we are. </p>
<p>(They walk in.) </p>
<p><strong>Stanley Vespucci</strong>: Check out the flowers in the vase.</p>
<p>(Nick looks at the note on the flowers.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: &quot;Congratulations on your last film.&quot; Any idea who sent her these, Mr. Vespucci?</p>
<p>(A framed photo of a pretty blonde-haired woman is on the dressing table next to the flowers.) </p>
<p><strong>Stanley Vespucci</strong>: (shrugs) Stalkers, creeps, cranks, nut balls, degenerates -- we get them all here. Weatherly attracts them like flies.</p>
<p>(He shows them a stack of letters.) </p>
<p><strong>Stanley Vespucci</strong>: These are ... uh ... some of the guys we've had trouble with in the past.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'll take that.</p>
<p>(Nick continues to look through the dressing room.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: When was the last time you saw her? </p>
<p>(Vespucci takes his phone out and dials.) </p>
<p><strong>Stanley Vespucci</strong>: At wrap yesterday. We shot all night, finished about 4:00 in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Did anyone see her leave the building?</p>
<p><strong>Stanley Vespucci</strong>: Her car's still parked out back.</p>
<p>(Nick holds a purse.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: This hers?</p>
<p><strong>Stanley Vespucci</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Weatherly Adams</strong>: (recording) Hi, it's Weatherly. Leave a message or I'll scream. (giggles) </p>
<p>(Nick turns the bag over, the contents spilling out onto the sofa.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Wallet, keys, and cell phone still in there.</p>
<p><strong>Stanley Vespucci</strong>: Still no answer on her home phone.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'll send a patrol car to her house. You said there was a break in. Why don't you show me?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. REPULSION PICTURES -- BASEMENT] </p>
<p>(Down in the basement, various items are stored – dress dummies, rolled-up carpets and a VORTEX OF EVIL movie poster hangs on the wall just below the ceiling light.) </p>
<p><strong>Stanley Vespucci</strong>: Ah, Weatherly ... how has she died for us, let me count the ways.</p>
<p>(Stanley Vespucci leads Brass and Nick down through the basement.) </p>
<p>(They walk past posters of the movies Weatherly made – NIGHT SHIVERS, INTO THE MOUTH OF HELL, and CAN I LICK THE SPOON?.)</p>
<p><strong>Stanley Vespucci</strong>: Bludgeoned, boiled, filleted, defenestrated, decapitated, disemboweled, oh, yeah, and strangled with her own intestines. Autopsied while still alive.</p>
<p>(They walk into the large storage area.) </p>
<p><strong>Stanley Vespucci</strong>: Made to eat her own liver, fed slowly through a tree chipper, roasted and served on a bed of Belgian endive. When Weatherly Adams dies, it's money in the bank.</p>
<p>(He shows them the open window.) </p>
<p><strong>Stanley Vespucci</strong>: Here you are, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Looks like somebody broke the glass, reached in, unlocked it and opened it.</p>
<p>(Nick looks around the area.) </p>
<p><strong>Stanley Vespucci</strong>: Yeah, that's the way I found it when I got here this evening.</p>
<p>(Nick finds some blonde-haired stuffed dummies on the furniture. Among the dummies, he finds the real Weatherly with an axe stuck in her back. Flies buzz around the dead body.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Uh, Jim ... I got her.</p>
<p>(Nick kneels to look at the body. Jim and Stanley Vespucci join him. Vespucci gasps.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: And I believe she's died for the last time.</p>
<p>FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[INT. REPULSION PICTURES -- BASEMENT] </p>
<p>(A movie poster, I HAVE TO AXE MY MOTHER, hangs on the cement post. The main photo is of Weatherly in red with an axe stuck in her head.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Whoever stuck her under this poster was trying to send a twisted message.</p>
<p>(Weatherly's dead body is also in red with an axe stuck in her back.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Either that, or the killer's got a wicked sense of humor.</p>
<p>(Catherine puts her gloves on. Nick snaps a photo as David Phillips turns the body to look under it.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Lividity is fixed along the anterior aspect, and ... she is still in full rigor.</p>
<p>(Nick checks his watch.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: She was last seen alive about 15 hours ago.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: No panties. I'll do an SAE kit.</p>
<p>(David pauses and looks up where he sees the movie poster.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: (inflecting) &quot;The horror.&quot;</p>
<p>(He chuckles and looks at Catherine and Nick. He does it again.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: (exaggerating) The horror ...</p>
<p>(Catherine smiles.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Huh? Huh? Bra-Brando? (normal voice) Brando from Apocalypse Now?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, yeah, yeah. I know, Dave. Everybody knows that.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: (deflated) Oh. I'll get the gurney.</p>
<p>(David leaves. Catherine notices Weatherly's broken shoe.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Looks like the Lady lost a heel.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: There's a whole lot of something here, but it doesn't really look like blood to me.</p>
<p>(Nick indicates the blood under the body. Catherine dusts the axe handle.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No, it's ... uh ... it's the wrong color. It's too red.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Smells sweet. Karo syrup and food coloring -- it's prop blood.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And I am not seeing any prints. It's been wiped clean.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: The question is, where does the fake blood end and the real blood begin?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. REPULSION PICTURES – MOVIE SET] </p>
<p>(The actress in pink wails and cries. The actor playing the killer cries.) </p>
<p>(Brass talks with the cast and crew.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Now, I know this may come as a shock to most of you, and I'm sorry for your loss. I understand that Weatherly Adams was a long-time member of this company ...</p>
<p>(The midget, Dickie Jones, looks around, then turns and hugs the pretty actress in pink.) </p>
<p><strong>Zack Putrid (director)</strong>: Well, do you have a suspect?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Uh, sir, we just found the body about an hour ago.</p>
<p>(Dickie Jones hugs the actress, then squeezes her butt.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We're just beginning our investigation.</p>
<p>(The actress pushes Dickie Jones away.) </p>
<p><strong>Zack Putrid</strong>: Yeah, I get it, I get it. I mean, it could be anyone.</p>
<p>(He turns and looks around – just as the other cast and crew members look around at each other.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Now, I'm going to have to look at your IDs and I'm going to take statements and fingerprints from all of you. And I thank you in advance for your cooperation.</p>
<p><strong>Stanley Vespucci</strong>: Anything we can do to help.</p>
<p>(Brass turns and heads up the platform stairs.) </p>
<p><strong>Zack Putrid</strong>: So what am I supposed to do today?</p>
<p><strong>Stanley Vespucci</strong>: Edit.</p>
<p>(Stanley Vespucci catches up with Brass.) </p>
<p><strong>Stanley Vespucci</strong>: Excuse me, Mr. Brass. Do you think that it would be all right if we were to ... continue to shoot ...</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Vincent Lafoon</strong>: I want that little twerp Zarco found and locked up.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Uh, who are you?</p>
<p><strong>Vincent Lafoon</strong>: Vincent Lafoon. This is my brother Mason. We own this place.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Who's Zarco?</p>
<p><strong>Vincent Lafoon</strong>: Oliver Zarco. He used to work here. He had a thing for Weatherly, and then he got hurt, blamed it on us, went a little nuts.</p>
<p><strong>Mason Lafoon</strong>: He was the one who got ...</p>
<p><strong>Vincent Lafoon</strong>: (interrupts) He was the one who sent the flowers and the note.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So he's done this before.</p>
<p><strong>Mason Lafoon</strong>: Yeah, like, three times.</p>
<p><strong>Vincent Lafoon</strong>: (irritated) Would you shut it? (to Brass) Three times. He's your guy.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Do you have video surveillance by any chance?</p>
<p><strong>Vincent Lafoon</strong>: Yeah, only on the exterior, but the video system's been on the fritz lately.</p>
<p><strong>Stanley Vespucci</strong>: I had it repaired three days ago-- I'll get the tapes.</p>
<p><strong>Vincent Lafoon</strong>: Oh, good. (Vespucci leaves.) (to Brass) Look, just find Zarco, okay?</p>
<p>(Vincent leaves. Mason lingers.) </p>
<p><strong>Killer Actor</strong>: Everyone come together.</p>
<p><strong>Mason Lafoon</strong>: Um, I can't, I still can't believe she's gone. I mean ... she was a ... she was a real beautiful lady.</p>
<p>(Everyone gathers on the set.) </p>
<p><strong>Killer Actor</strong>: Let's form a circle and touch hands with someone you care about.</p>
<p>(Mason turns to join the others.) </p>
<p><strong>Killer Actor</strong>: Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me ...</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. REPULSION PICTURES -- BASEMENT] </p>
<p>(Nick swabs the &quot;blood&quot; and tests it. It doesn't work.) </p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[INT. REPULSION PICTURES – DRESSING ROOM] </p>
<p>(Catherine is in Weatherly's dressing room. She dusts the green vase.) </p>
<p>(She stops when she doesn't find any prints.) </p>
<p>[INT. REPULSION PICTURES -- BASEMENT] </p>
<p>(Nick goes over to the window. He sees the security camera outside and measures the distance. He notes it on the sketchpad.) </p>
<p>[INT. REPULSION PICTURES – DRESSING ROOM] </p>
<p>(Catherine snaps photos of Weatherly's dresser and open drawer.) </p>
<p>(She opens the top drawer and snaps a photo of it. She takes out a notebook and looks inside. She finds dates, times and numbers.) </p>
<p>(Nick walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: How's it going in here?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The vase is clean. I've got a spiral notebook filled with dates, times and weights. Looks like she was a bit concerned about her size.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Actors.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – FORENSIC AUTOPSY] </p>
<p>(Robbins and David are working on removing the axe from Weatherly's back.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: (appalled) You really don't recognize her?</p>
<p>(David holds the body down while Robbins pulls on the axe.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (grunts) No.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: You've ever seen Chop Chop, Fizz Fizz?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Can I Lick The Spoon? </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Please, David.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: They're classics.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Those are not classics.</p>
<p>(The axe pops out.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: The Exorcist. The Shining. Rosemary's Baby. Those are classics.</p>
<p>(David washes the body.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: You know what I loved about her? She really made you feel the terror. When she was scared for her life, I was scared, too.</p>
<p>(Robbins holds the axe cut open as David washes it out. He sees something.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Interesting.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) – DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – INTERVIEW ROOM – DAY]</p>
<p>(Brass talks with Oliver Zarco.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Mr. Zarco ... tell me about you and Weatherly Adams.</p>
<p><strong>Oliver Zarco</strong>: It was the happiest time in my life. I had realized my dream.</p>
<p>FLASHBACK TO: The set is busy.</p>
<p><strong>Oliver Zarco</strong>: (V.O.) I was working in the movies. Though I was only in an entry-level position, Weatherly and I were already an item.</p>
<p>(Weatherly and Zarco are kissing in the back.) </p>
<p><strong>Oliver Zarco</strong>: (V.O.) Just like ...</p>
<p>END FLASHBACK.</p>
<p><strong>Oliver Zarco</strong>: ... Julia Roberts and what's his name.</p>
<p>FLASHBACK TO: They're filming on the set.</p>
<p>(Weatherly takes the burning meat out of the oven and puts it on the table. The meat is smoking.) </p>
<p><strong>Oliver Zarco</strong>: (V.O.) We were in love.</p>
<p><strong>Weatherly</strong>: (smiles) Hi.</p>
<p>(Zarco is on the side with a smoke machine, adding to the smoke. He blows her a kiss. Filming continues.) </p>
<p><strong>Oliver Zarco</strong>: (V.O.) And then it was all over in an instant.</p>
<p>(The smoke machine blows up and bursts into flames in his face. Zarco screams.) </p>
<p><strong>Oliver Zarco</strong>: Oh, God!</p>
<p>(Zarco's face is on fire. He gets up and runs around the set.) </p>
<p><strong>Oliver Zarco</strong>: Oh, my God!</p>
<p>(Finally someone with a fire extinguisher puts the fire out.) </p>
<p>END FLASHBACK.</p>
<p>(Zarco's face is scarred.) </p>
<p><strong>Oliver Zarco</strong>: I was in rehab for six months. That slime ball Lafoon convinced me not to file a Worker's Compensation claim. He said that he'd take care of me.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: And you trusted him?</p>
<p><strong>Oliver Zarco</strong>: Yes. And then, when the deadline passed to file my claim, Vincent offered me two grand, take it or leave it, and then he fired my ass. And I could have lived with that, but ...</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: But what?</p>
<p><strong>Oliver Zarco</strong>: Weatherly ... dumped me. She felt we were no longer compatible. The truth was, she couldn't stand to look at me. She cried when she told me. Actresses can do that. The smell of her skin ... like fresh lemon poppy seed scones baking in the oven. Gold flecks that danced like Valkyries in the emerald depths of her eyes. Her hair-- oh, God ... Her hair ...</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So you started stalking her.</p>
<p><strong>Oliver Zarco</strong>: I brought her gifts from time to time, to let her know that I still loved her. Is that against the law?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: It is if you break in to do it.</p>
<p><strong>Oliver Zarco</strong>: They wouldn't let me in the front door.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So you came in through the window. Only this time, you got caught. You argued. She told you where to shove your flowers, and you thought to yourself, &quot;You know, do I really need this aggravation?&quot; So you killed the bitch. I think you killed the bitch.</p>
<p><strong>Oliver Zarco</strong>: Why would I kill her?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: How should I know? </p>

300 milliliters -- that's less than a cup -- of Weatherly's actual blood outside of her body. Originally, we had assumed that the axe blade had sealed the wound, that the position of her body had caused her to bleed internally.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: But if she had been gored first by another weapon and then axed, there would have been a lot more blood.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to radio) Yeah, you'd better. They're department issue. And if you lose it, you replace it.</p>
<p><strong>Ronnie</strong>: (to radio) Does that include the cost of the contract?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to radio) Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Ronnie</strong>: (to radio) Damnit. I'll see you later.</p>
<p>(Ronnie goes back into the car, puts her seatbelt on and leaves the gas station.) </p>
<p>(As she pulls out, a woman with short blonde hair watches her. Lightning flashes.) </p>
<p>(Ronnie's SUV heads back to the studio.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – HALLWAY – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Catherine returns. She's on the phone with Brass.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We found the pipe that killed Weatherly. It's in the print lab being processed. She was killed on the soundstage and then dragged over.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (from phone) We've got a warrant out for Mason Lafoon. We're looking for him now.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to phone) Okay. Let me know what you find out.</p>
<p>(She hangs up. Another call comes in. It's DICKIE JONES.) </p>
<p>(Catherine sighs and heads into her office.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to phone) What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>Dickie Jones</strong>: (from phone) Pookie, it's me, Dickie.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to phone) I know.</p>
<p><strong>Dickie Jones</strong>: (from phone) I've got information I think you might be interested in.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to phone) Okay, shoot.</p>
<p><strong>Dickie Jones</strong>: (from phone) No. It has to be in person.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to phone) Where are you?</p>
<p><strong>Dickie Jones</strong>: (from phone) I'm at the studio.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to phone) I thought there was no phone transmission from there.</p>
<p><strong>Dickie Jones</strong>: (from phone) There wasn't. Now there is. That's how it is with phones and electrical storms. Look, it's urgent. Get down here as soon as you can. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I just came from there. Why didn't you tell me then, you annoying little man?</p>
<p><strong>Dickie Jones</strong>: (from phone) The situation is evolving.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to phone) If you're screwing with me, I will to string you up and beat you senseless.</p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[EXT. REPULSION PICTURES]</p>
<p><strong>Dickie Jones</strong>: (to phone) I look forward to it. Just hurry.</p>
<p>(Thunder cracks. Dickie Jones hangs up.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – INTERVIEW ROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Brass puts a photo of Mason opening the warehouse window down on the table.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: That's you, Mason. All six feet, three inches of you impersonating your brother, which makes you good for Weatherly's murder. You did that one, too, didn't you?</p>
<p><strong>Mason Lafoon</strong>: No, no, no. Nobody killed Weatherly, okay? She killed herself.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, really? What, she axed herself in the back?</p>
<p><strong>Mason Lafoon</strong>: No, you don't understand. She ... she ... It was an accident. She tripped.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Mason Lafoon and Stanley Vespucci are talking as Weatherly says good night to them.) </p>
<p><strong>Mason Lafoon</strong>: Good night, Weatherly. </p>
<p><strong>Stanley Vespucci</strong>: Good night, kid.</p>
<p><strong>Mason Lafoon</strong>: Yeah, great stuff tonight. Have a good night.</p>
<p><strong>Stanley Vespucci</strong>: All right. </p>
<p><strong>Mason Lafoon</strong>: See you tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>Weatherly Adams</strong>: See you tomorrow. Okay.</p>
<p>(Weatherly smiles and waves to them as she backs away. She trips on the rolled up hose on the floor, falls off the set stage, and ... SQUISH!)</p>
<p>(Mason and Stanley rush over to check on her. They find her impaled and dead on the prop below.</p>
<p><strong>Mason Lafoon</strong>: (shouts) Call 911! Call 911!</p>
<p>(Mason reaches for his phone. Stanley stops him from dialing.) </p>
<p><strong>Stanley Vespucci</strong>: Wait, let's think about this.</p>
<p><strong>Mason Lafoon</strong>: No, but Stanley ...</p>
<p><strong>Stanley Vespucci</strong>: Mason, she's dead! This time she's not coming back. We've got so many health and safety violations. If we report one more set-related accident -- especially one resulting in a death -- we will lose our bond, our liability insurance, OSHA will shut us down, we'll get our asses sued for wrongful death, and that will be the end of Repulsion Pictures! Is that what you want? Is that what you want?!</p>
<p><strong>Mason Lafoon</strong>: (shouts) No!</p>
<p>BACK TO SCENE.</p>
<p><strong>Mason Lafoon</strong>: He ... he said &quot;the show must go on,&quot; th-that Weatherly ... would have wanted it that ... I don't ... we ... we didn't kill anybody.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: But you made it look like a murder, and then you framed your brother.</p>
<p><strong>Mason Lafoon</strong>: Well, he's been treating me like crap my entire life.</p>
<p>(Brass chuckles.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, but for that, you're going to send him to jail for the rest of his life?</p>
<p><strong>Mason Lafoon</strong>: This was all ... this was all Stanley's idea.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Do you realize how much trouble you're in?</p>
<p><strong>Mason Lafoon</strong>: Look, Stanley was the one who wanted to frame Vincent, okay? All I was supposed to do was clean up the accident scene and pretend to be Vince and buy the roses and that was it. The rest was him. If you don't believe me, talk to the dwarf.</p>
<p>(Brass sits down.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Why? What did he have to do with it?</p>
<p><strong>Mason Lafoon</strong>: Dickie saw the whole thing.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Stanley and Mason talk. Dickie Jones is in the back of the set watching ... and hearing them.) </p>
<p><strong>Stanley Vespucci</strong>: ... and that will be the end of Repulsion Pictures. Is that what you want? Is that what you want?!</p>
<p><strong>Mason Lafoon</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>Mason</strong>: (V.O.) And he's been trying to shake down Stanley ever since.</p>
<p>BACK TO SCENE.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, that would explain the animosity.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. REPULSION PICTURES – SET -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Ronnie returns to the warehouse. She wipes the rain from her forehead as she heads to the back to get her phone.) </p>
<p>(Thunder rumbles. Lightning flashes. The lights are on. Ronnie enters the room. She grabs her phone off the stage and turns around to leave. She stops at a fresh pool of dripping blood on the floor.) </p>
<p>(She looks up and finds Dickie Jones hanging from the overhead beams upside down. He's dead.) </p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[EXT. STREET -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(The CSI SUV turns on the road.) </p>
<p>[INT. CATHERINE'S CAR (TRAVELING) – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Catherine is driving.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to radio) Control, this is C-13 Willows, trying to contact C-147<br />
Lake.</p>
<p><strong>Dispatch</strong>: (from radio) C-13, Control. Copy. Stand by.</p>
<p>[INT. REPULSION PICTURES – SET -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Ronnie is on her phone.) </p>
<p><strong>Ronnie</strong>: (to phone) Hello, Dispatch?</p>
<p>(She doesn't get a response. She shakes her phone.) </p>
<p><strong>Ronnie</strong>: (to phone) Hello?</p>
<p>[INT. CATHERINE'S CAR (TRAVELING) – NIGHT]</p>
<p><strong>Dispatch</strong>: (from radio) C-13, Control. C-147 is not responding.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to radio) Okay, thanks. Over and out.</p>
<p>[INT. REPULSION PICTURES – SET -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Ronnie's phone beeps as it disconnects. She looks around. Two gunshots fire.)</p>
<p>(She heads out to the door.) </p>
<p>(She stops when a WOMAN in a long gown, high spiked heels and a short blonde wig walks across the far entryway. The WOMAN looks like it might be Weatherly.) </p>
<p>(Ronnie's phone rings.) </p>
<p>(She ducks quickly to the side to hide. She reaches for her phone to turn the ringer off. But the WOMAN turns around and looks at Ronnie. Ronnie runs back to the set.)</p>
<p>(She ducks into the corner and crouches against the wall. She opens her phone and makes a call.) </p>
<p>SPLIT SCREEN: [INT. CATHERINE'S CAR]</p>
<p><strong>Ronnie</strong>: (to phone) (whispers) Catherine, it's Ronnie. I'm stuck at Repulsion Pictures. I need backup.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Ronnie ... </p>
<p><strong>Ronnie</strong>: (to phone) Hello? </p>
<p>(Ronnie looks at her phone.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (echo-y) ... uh ... I'm, I'm coming. </p>
<p><strong>Ronnie</strong>: (to phone) Hello? </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Just ... just stay on the line. </p>
<p>(&quot;Weatherly&quot; turns and heads back toward the set where Ronnie is.) </p>
<p><strong>Ronnie</strong>: (to phone) Hello? </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Ronnie? </p>
<p><strong>Ronnie</strong>: (to phone) Hello? </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Ronn—</p>
<p>(The line goes dead.) </p>
<p><strong>Ronnie</strong>: (to phone) Hello?</p>
<p>(Catherine's phone beeps. She picks up the radio to call dispatch.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Dispatch, this is C-13 Willows requesting backup to meet me at Repulsion Pictures.</p>
<p>(Catherine turns the sirens on.) </p>
<p>[INT. REPULSION PICTURES – SET -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Meanwhile, Ronnie looks out the window. Lightning flashes and the woman's figure passes by the window, her heels clacking on the floor.)</p>
<p>(Ronnie reaches over and picks up the toilet tank cover. She backs away from the door.) </p>
<p>(She turns around and ZACK PUTRID is standing there.)</p>
<p>(He falls to the floor with a THUD. He grabs Ronnie by her ankle.) </p>
<p><strong>Zack Putrid</strong>: (gasps) You gotta help me. I'm shot! I'm shot! You gotta get us out of here.</p>
<p>(Ronnie puts the cover down and applies pressure to the wound in Zack's back.) </p>
<p><strong>Ronnie</strong>: (quietly) It's gonna be okay. Keep your voice down.</p>
<p><strong>Zack Putrid</strong>: (gasping) Do you know how many people I've killed in this place?</p>
<p><strong>Ronnie</strong>: Shh!</p>
<p><strong>Zack Putrid</strong>: The irony is exquisite, but the pain is more formidable, you know? I think the pain is preventing me from enjoying the irony.</p>
<p>(Ronnie covers Zack's mouth to stop him from talking.) </p>
<p><strong>Ronnie</strong>: Shh! Shut up!</p>
<p>(She removes her hand and he starts talking again.) </p>
<p><strong>Zack Putrid</strong>: But I ...</p>
<p><strong>Ronnie</strong>: For the love of God, stop talking.</p>
<p>[EXT. STREET – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Catherine's SUV turns onto the road, sirens wailing.) </p>
<p>[INT. REPULSION PICTURES – SET -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Zack coughs blood.) </p>
<p><strong>Zack Putrid</strong>: Oh, that's not good. (coughs) I should really stop talking and-and try and relax.</p>
<p>OTHER POV: Someone watches them. </p>
<p><strong>Ronnie</strong>: That's good. Yeah, stop talking.</p>
<p><strong>Zack Putrid</strong>: But I can't stop talking. I've got that thing that ... It's a syndrome. It's a word ... There's a word for it.</p>
<p><strong>Ronnie</strong>: Shh-shh-shh!</p>
<p><strong>Zack Putrid</strong>: People have it. It's a syndrome. I can't stop talking.</p>
<p><strong>Stanley</strong>: Zack.</p>
<p>(Ronnie looks up and sees Stanley Vespucci standing up on the mezzanine level above them. He's carrying a gun and raises it at them.) </p>
<p>(Zack turns and looks at Stanley.) </p>
<p><strong>Zack Putrid</strong>: Stanley ... Stanley, don't shoot me again. I don't want to die, okay? You already shot me twice. I learned my lesson, okay?</p>
<p><strong>Ronnie</strong>: Sir, I'm a CSI. Think about what you're doing.</p>
<p>(Thunder rumbles.)</p>
<p><strong>Ronnie</strong>: Put down your weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Stanley Vespucci</strong>: I'm sorry, I don't think I can do that.</p>
<p>(He cocks the gun. Zack sobs.) </p>
<p>(Suddenly, Stanley gasps. He staggers down the stairs with an axe in his back.) </p>
<p>(He falls to the floor in front of Ronnie and Zack.) </p>
<p>(Behind him, Oliver Zarco is dressed in a blue sequined gown and is wearing a short blonde wig. He's looking a lot like &quot;Weatherly.&quot;) </p>
<p>(Ronnie looks at Zarco.) </p>
<p><strong>Oliver Zarco</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>Ronnie</strong>: (nods) Yeah.</p>
<p>(Oliver gulps and sits down hard on the steps. He removes the blonde wig.) </p>
<p>(The approaching sirens grow louder.) </p>
<p><strong>Oliver Zarco</strong>: I really loved her.</p>
<p>(He buries his face in the wig and cries.) </p>
<p>(Ronnie lets out a shaky breath.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (o.s.) Ronnie! </p>
<p>(Catherine enters the room with two officers behind her. Their weapons are out.) </p>
<p>(Ronnie sits down on the floor.) </p>
<p>(Catherine sees the bodies on the floor – and Zarco sitting on the steps. She looks up and sees Dickie Jones hanging from the ceiling beams.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[BLACK SCREEN] </p>
<p><strong>Zack Putrid</strong>: (V.O.) I'm editing late, like I always do, and I hear a shot. </p>
<p>INSERT: FLASHBACK</p>
<p>(Stanley is turning the crank that raises Dickie Jones up to the ceiling beams by his feet.)</p>
<p><strong>Zack Putrid</strong>: (V.O.) So, I go outside and check it out.</p>
<p>(Zack walks in and sees him.) </p>
<p><strong>Zack Putrid</strong>: Stanley!</p>
<p><strong>Stanley Vespucci</strong>: You gotta help me hide the dwarf before the cops come back. Dickie was blackmailing us about Weatherly's accident. He wants to bring the whole company down.</p>
<p><strong>Zack Putrid</strong>: But you killed him! You killed Dickie!</p>
<p><strong>Stanley Vespucci</strong>: What's it gonna be, Zack? (He points the gun at Zack.) You gonna help me here or what?!</p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO: </p>
<p>[INT. HOSPITAL – ZACK'S ROOM]</p>
<p>(Zack talks with Ronnie.) </p>
<p><strong>Zack Putrid</strong>: Next thing you know, I'm running for my life. And the nut job is chasing me. He shoots me, and then I see the hot ... you. And all I can think the whole time is, &quot;Man, this is great. I could use this stuff.&quot; I mean, this is life imitating art imitating life. You are so beautiful.</p>
<p>(Ronnie starts to smile.) </p>
<p><strong>Zack Putrid</strong>: You are ... Your, your face is so expressive. It-it emotes. You do terror so good.</p>
<p><strong>Ronnie</strong>: I wasn't acting.</p>
<p><strong>Zack Putrid</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>Ronnie</strong>: I'll see you.</p>
<p>(Ronnie turns to leave.) </p>
<p><strong>Zack Putrid</strong>: Well, hey, listen. If you ever get tired of fighting crime, you know, there's always a future for you in the horror business. I mean, I'll take you there.</p>
<p><strong>Ronnie</strong>: Thanks, but I like what I'm doing.</p>
<p><strong>Zack Putrid</strong>: Oh, hey, the offer's still good.</p>
<p><strong>Ronnie</strong>: Okay, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Zack Putrid</strong>: No, I'm serious. I could build an entire franchise around you.</p>
<p><strong>Ronnie</strong>: Bye.</p>
<p>(Ronnie leaves.) </p>
<p><strong>Zack Putrid</strong>: (shouts) Seriously. Give me a call.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – HALLWAY / FORENSIC AUTOPSY] </p>
<p>(We move through the hallway, past a dead body on a gurney. We turn the corner and enter Forensic Autopsy.) </p>
<p>(We hear music and screaming – men screaming, maniacal laughter and a woman screaming.) </p>
<p>(We see a dead body on the autopsy table and hear horror movie climax music playing. A man laughs. A door hinge creaks loudly.) </p>
<p>(Robbins and David Phillips sit at the desk watching a horror movie and eating popcorn.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: That is impressive. As the woman's throat is being slashed, you can actually see the entire transverse view of the trachea.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: That's all you've got to say?</p>
<p>(Robbins puts his glasses on and sits forward.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: I believe I can see the epiglottis.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Epiglottis? What about the pathos? I mean ... what about the humanity? This may be Weatherly's finest performance.</p>
<p>(Robbins stares at David.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Oh, just watch the movie.</p>
<p>(A woman screams. They go back to the popcorn and the movie.) </p>

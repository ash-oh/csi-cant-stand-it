Zack Putrid:  Cut! Damn it!
 
Zack Putrid: Can somebody please get her a glass of water?!  What happened? Babe? What are you doing? Are you choking on the blood?
 
SFX Guy: I did what you told me to.
Zack Putrid: Yeah, but this time, get it on her face, not in her mouth.
SFX Guy: The mouth is part of the face.
Zack Putrid: Yeah, I know, I know. But hit her from the side, from the side. And get plenty on the rack.
 
Giant Doctor: We're dying here.
Dickie Jones: I'm going to go ring it.
Giant Doctor: All right. Hey, grab me a bear claw.
 
Zack Putrid : How long have I known you, huh? This is you and me. Get the shot -- not too tight. Wide enough to fit in the fun bags.
 
Zack Putrid : Baby-cakes ...
 
Killer Actor:  Where was I? Want me to laugh?
Zack Putrid : Don't laugh. You were scary. Get away.
 
Zack Putrid : Honey, this time, don't inhale the blood, okay? All right, let's get her cleaned up. Let's shoot this bitch.
 
Actress:  Oh ...
Zack Putrid : Not you, baby. The shot. The shot's a bitch. I love one-ers. And you know what else I love? I love sushi. Me, too. Do you want to go for sushi?
 
Stanley Vespucci: Our lead actress, Weatherly Adams, had her dressing room violated last night.
Brass: So she's the one you suspect is missing?
Stanley Vespucci: She missed her call this morning. The woman is nothing if not professional. She's predictably precisely 35 minutes late every day. You could set your watch to it. She's already ... three hours late and still no sign of her.
 
 
Stanley Vespucci: Nothing to worry about, gentlemen. It's just a bad bulb. If you will, please, follow me.
 
 
 
Stanley Vespucci: Here we are. 
 
Stanley Vespucci: Check out the flowers in the vase.
 
Nick: &quot;Congratulations on your last film.&quot; Any idea who sent her these, Mr. Vespucci?
 
Stanley Vespucci:  Stalkers, creeps, cranks, nut balls, degenerates -- we get them all here. Weatherly attracts them like flies.
 
Stanley Vespucci: These are ... uh ... some of the guys we've had trouble with in the past.
Brass: I'll take that.
 
Brass: When was the last time you saw her? 
 
Stanley Vespucci: At wrap yesterday. We shot all night, finished about 4:00 in the morning.
Brass: Did anyone see her leave the building?
Stanley Vespucci: Her car's still parked out back.
 
Nick: This hers?
Stanley Vespucci: Yeah.
Weatherly Adams:  
 
Nick: Wallet, keys, and cell phone still in there.
Stanley Vespucci: Still no answer on her home phone.
Brass: I'll send a patrol car to her house. You said there was a break in. Why don't you show me?

 
 
Stanley Vespucci: Ah, Weatherly ... how has she died for us, let me count the ways.
 

Stanley Vespucci: Bludgeoned, boiled, filleted, defenestrated, decapitated, disemboweled, oh, yeah, and strangled with her own intestines. Autopsied while still alive.
 
Stanley Vespucci: Made to eat her own liver, fed slowly through a tree chipper, roasted and served on a bed of Belgian endive. When Weatherly Adams dies, it's money in the bank.
 
Stanley Vespucci: Here you are, gentlemen.
Nick: Looks like somebody broke the glass, reached in, unlocked it and opened it.
 
Stanley Vespucci: Yeah, that's the way I found it when I got here this evening.
 
Nick: Uh, Jim ... I got her.
 
Nick: And I believe she's died for the last time.
FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS



 
 
Nick: Whoever stuck her under this poster was trying to send a twisted message.
 
Catherine: Either that, or the killer's got a wicked sense of humor.
 
David Phillips: Lividity is fixed along the anterior aspect, and ... she is still in full rigor.
 
Nick: She was last seen alive about 15 hours ago.
David Phillips: No panties. I'll do an SAE kit.
 
David Phillips:  &quot;The horror.&quot;
 
David Phillips:  The horror ...
 
David Phillips: Huh? Huh? Bra-Brando?  Brando from Apocalypse Now?
Catherine: Oh, yeah, yeah. I know, Dave. Everybody knows that.
David Phillips:  Oh. I'll get the gurney.
 
Catherine: Looks like the Lady lost a heel.
Nick: There's a whole lot of something here, but it doesn't really look like blood to me.
 
Catherine: No, it's ... uh ... it's the wrong color. It's too red.
Nick: Smells sweet. Karo syrup and food coloring -- it's prop blood.
Catherine: And I am not seeing any prints. It's been wiped clean.
Nick: The question is, where does the fake blood end and the real blood begin?

 
 
 
Brass: Now, I know this may come as a shock to most of you, and I'm sorry for your loss. I understand that Weatherly Adams was a long-time member of this company ...
 
Zack Putrid : Well, do you have a suspect?
Brass: Uh, sir, we just found the body about an hour ago.
 
Brass: We're just beginning our investigation.
 
Zack Putrid: Yeah, I get it, I get it. I mean, it could be anyone.
 
Brass: Now, I'm going to have to look at your IDs and I'm going to take statements and fingerprints from all of you. And I thank you in advance for your cooperation.
Stanley Vespucci: Anything we can do to help.
 
Zack Putrid: So what am I supposed to do today?
Stanley Vespucci: Edit.
 
Stanley Vespucci: Excuse me, Mr. Brass. Do you think that it would be all right if we were to ... continue to shoot ...
Brass: No.
Vincent Lafoon: I want that little twerp Zarco found and locked up.
Brass: Uh, who are you?
Vincent Lafoon: Vincent Lafoon. This is my brother Mason. We own this place.
Brass: Who's Zarco?
Vincent Lafoon: Oliver Zarco. He used to work here. He had a thing for Weatherly, and then he got hurt, blamed it on us, went a little nuts.
Mason Lafoon: He was the one who got ...
Vincent Lafoon:  He was the one who sent the flowers and the note.
Brass: So he's done this before.
Mason Lafoon: Yeah, like, three times.
Vincent Lafoon:  Three times. He's your guy.
Brass: Do you have video surveillance by any chance?
Vincent Lafoon: Yeah, only on the exterior, but the video system's been on the fritz lately.
Stanley Vespucci: I had it repaired three days ago-- I'll get the tapes.
Vincent Lafoon: Oh, good.  Look, just find Zarco, okay?
 
Killer Actor: Everyone come together.
Mason Lafoon: Um, I can't, I still can't believe she's gone. I mean ... she was a ... she was a real beautiful lady.
 
Killer Actor: Let's form a circle and touch hands with someone you care about.
 
Killer Actor: Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. Thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me ...

 
 

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Nick: How's it going in here?
Catherine: The vase is clean. I've got a spiral notebook filled with dates, times and weights. Looks like she was a bit concerned about her size.
Nick: Actors.

 
 
David Phillips:  You really don't recognize her?

Robbins:  No.
David Phillips: You've ever seen Chop Chop, Fizz Fizz?
Robbins: No.
David Phillips: Can I Lick The Spoon? 
Robbins: Please, David.
David Phillips: They're classics.
Robbins: Those are not classics.
 
Robbins: The Exorcist. The Shining. Rosemary's Baby. Those are classics.
 
David Phillips: You know what I loved about her? She really made you feel the terror. When she was scared for her life, I was scared, too.
 
Robbins: Interesting.



 
Brass: Mr. Zarco ... tell me about you and Weatherly Adams.
Oliver Zarco: It was the happiest time in my life. I had realized my dream.

Oliver Zarco:  I was working in the movies. Though I was only in an entry-level position, Weatherly and I were already an item.
 
Oliver Zarco:  Just like ...

Oliver Zarco: ... Julia Roberts and what's his name.

 
Oliver Zarco:  We were in love.
Weatherly:  Hi.
 
Oliver Zarco:  And then it was all over in an instant.
 
Oliver Zarco: Oh, God!
 
Oliver Zarco: Oh, my God!
 

 
Oliver Zarco: I was in rehab for six months. That slime ball Lafoon convinced me not to file a Worker's Compensation claim. He said that he'd take care of me.
Brass: And you trusted him?
Oliver Zarco: Yes. And then, when the deadline passed to file my claim, Vincent offered me two grand, take it or leave it, and then he fired my ass. And I could have lived with that, but ...
Brass: But what?
Oliver Zarco: Weatherly ... dumped me. She felt we were no longer compatible. The truth was, she couldn't stand to look at me. She cried when she told me. Actresses can do that. The smell of her skin ... like fresh lemon poppy seed scones baking in the oven. Gold flecks that danced like Valkyries in the emerald depths of her eyes. Her hair-- oh, God ... Her hair ...
Brass: So you started stalking her.
Oliver Zarco: I brought her gifts from time to time, to let her know that I still loved her. Is that against the law?
Brass: It is if you break in to do it.
Oliver Zarco: They wouldn't let me in the front door.
Brass: So you came in through the window. Only this time, you got caught. You argued. She told you where to shove your flowers, and you thought to yourself, &quot;You know, do I really need this aggravation?&quot; So you killed the bitch. I think you killed the bitch.
Oliver Zarco: Why would I kill her?
Brass: How should I know? 
Oliver Zarco: Do I know you?
Brass: Listen, Zarco, you whack job, you'd better focus! You focus.
Oliver Zarco: I'm trying to explain to you. I haven't been near that place in over a year. You got the wrong guy. I don't do that anymore. I'm in therapy now. Lots of therapy. Freudian, Jungian, Gestaltian -- all that crap. I've let go of my anger.

 
 
Wendy: Have you seen Catherine around?
Grissom: No, why?
Wendy: 'Cause I just got the DNA results for Weatherly Adams, and the skin under her nails and the semen from her SAE, they both belong to Vaughn Krunty.
Grissom: Who?
Wendy: Vaughn Krunty, aka &quot;Zack Putrid.&quot;
Grissom: Who's that?
Wendy:  The Titan of Terror, The Sultan of Slash. He's the movie director. I just ... I found him in CODIS for a statutory rape charge in Laughlin when he was 18 and the girl was 16. Can you believe that?
Grissom: What's the matter with you?
Wendy: Nothing.
Grissom: Go tell Catherine what you found, make sure that you pull all the old evidence out of storage in case she needs it.
Wendy: Okay.
 

 
 
Zack Putrid: Please. That looks pretty stupid, doesn't it?
Editor: Well, you could cut out earlier, maybe go to a wide exterior shot, you could carry the scream over a big flock of birds taking off.
Zack Putrid: Yeah?
 
Editor: Or ... yeah ...
 
Editor:  Or not. Or not, just ... bad idea. All right, okay.
 

Zack Putrid: Detective Brass.
 
Zack Putrid: Man, I love that. Detective Brass. You're a detective, and your name is Brass. I mean, I can use that. That's like a cop named Officer Copper. Or a tin horn sheriff named Sheriff Tin. You cannot write that stuff. 
Brass: Listen, buddy ...
Zack Putrid: Dude, I know why you're here, okay? Weatherly and I, yes, we were knocking boots, man.
Brass: So, you acknowledge having s*x with her?
(Brass walks in and heads toward the editor's table where he looks at the latest
&quot;star&quot; covered with fake blood.) 
Zack Putrid: Well, yeah, I just said I had s*x ... Why would I deny it? Hey, I bang all my stars. It builds trust. It's part of my process. 
Brass: We found traces of your skin under her fingernails. Maybe she wasn't into your &quot;process,&quot; so you raped her.
 
 
Brass: You find that funny?
Zack Putrid: Dude, you gotta see this. You're gonna love it. 
Bring up Double D.
Editor: Yeah. Here goes.
 
Weatherly Adams:  Hi, baby. Hi.

 
Zack Putrid: Check it out.
 
Zack Putrid:  Money. Money.
 
 
Zack Putrid: Oh, yeah.
Zack Putrid:  Oh, ba-by. Oh, ba-by.
Editor:  I can't believe this is my life.
Zack Putrid:  Oh, man, oh, man...
Weatherly Adams:  Come over here, baby.

 
Brass: This what you do all day?
Zack Putrid: Look, does that look like a woman being taken against her will?
Brass: That still doesn't explain how your skin got under her fingernails.
Zack Putrid: Weatherly was ... how can I put this delicately? She was an ass-scratcher, man. She liked to scratch my ass. She wasn't pushing me away, man, she was pulling me in.
 
Zack Putrid: Brass, look at my ass.
 
Zack Putrid: Freaking claw marks.
Brass: Are you trying to make me throw up, Mr. Putrid?

 




 
 
 
 
 


 
 
REVEAL: 

 

 
Henry Andrews: Oh, my God. No way! 
 
 
 
Henry Andrews: That is so cool. I can't believe you worked for Repulsion Pictures. 
Wendy: Well, I did it on a whim. I was supposed to be an extra, but then they liked me, so they gave me this whole featured bit. I got 600 bucks for that. What? What? I was fresh out of college. I really needed the money. 
Ronnie Lake: I don't get it -- what's the thrill here? It's always hot babes with huge breasts falling out of their shirts, getting hacked up ... 
Wendy: I don't have huge breasts. Mine are kind of ... medium. 
Hodges: But perfect ...
 
Hodges: --ly adequate. Better, in fact. 
 
Sara: Okay. Uh, I'm out of here.
 
Henry Andrews: Hey, let's watch it again.

 
 
 
Robbins:  When I removed the axe, -- 

Robbins:  I noticed that the dermis along the margin of the wound showed no vital response, except in a small area on both sides of the center of the track.
 
Robbins:  The cause of death was perforation of the liver, spleen, and pancreas.
 
BACK TO SCENE.
Robbins: But the injuries are inconsistent with the position of the axe wound.
Nick: The axe isn't what killed her.
Robbins: Exactly. The perforation was caused by a sharp, hollow, cylindrical object entering through the lower back, and then passing upwards into the organs.
Nick: Like a spear, or a pipe of some kind?
Robbins: Perhaps.
Nick: If the axe was planted in her back postmortem to conceal t original puncture site, then ... we don't have a murder weapon.


 
ON THE COMPUTER MONITOR is the footage dated 11/07/07 at 05:22 A.M. of someone in a baseball cap opening the window to the warehouse. 
Archie: The only thing I found on the surveillance tapes was this. 
 
Catherine: That guy looks familiar. Oh, that's Vincent Lafoon. He and his brother own the place.
Archie: Well, here's where it gets a little weird.
 
Catherine: He's trying to make it look like somebody broke in. I think he's framing Zarco.
Archie: If he owns the place, he must have known about the surveillance cameras. Right?  Why would he let himself get caught on tape?
Catherine: I don't know, but according to Brass's notes, he thought the system was down. So, we found no physical evidence linking Zarco to the scene. Vincent knew he had an easy fall guy. He's been playing us the whole time.

 
 
Vincent Lafoon: Hey, you're making a big mistake; you got the wrong dude.
Brass: Yeah, a lot of guys tell me that.
Vincent Lafoon: But I didn't do anything. Why would I kill Weatherly? She was my company's best asset. Plus, I liked her. She was my friend.
 
Vincent Lafoon: That's him. That's Zarco. That's your guy.
Oliver Zarco: What happened, Lafoon? She get too old, so you killed her for real?
 
Vincent Lafoon: Where's he going?
Brass: I don't know. Probably out for a nice dinner.
 
Vincent Lafoon: You're letting him go? Are you out of your mind?
Brass: We've got nothing on him.
Vincent Lafoon: But I'm the one getting set up here, me! Don't let him go--
I'm telling you-- you'll regret this. 
 
Oliver Zarco: I never touched her. You know it, I know it, and they know it. You killed her, and you're going down.
 
Oliver Zarco: Can I go now?
Brass: Yeah, get out of here while I'm still in a good mood.
 
Oliver Zarco: So long, Lafoon. I hope they tear you a big one.
 


 
 
Greg: What's up?
Sara: You know, in the slasher movies, when they go after the dark-haired girl, she always dies?
 
Greg: Yeah. And the blond always lives.  Aren't you glad it wasn't a movie?

Sara: I think, um ... I think I am sick of having my face shoved in death every day. The murder rate has gone up every year since I've been here. It's totally out of control, and ... we're not even slowing them down.

 
 
Nick: After examining the crime scene, I determined there were between 200 and
300 milliliters -- that's less than a cup -- of Weatherly's actual blood outside of her body. Originally, we had assumed that the axe blade had sealed the wound, that the position of her body had caused her to bleed internally.
Catherine: But if she had been gored first by another weapon and then axed, there would have been a lot more blood.
Nick: Right, right. So, I compared the initial coroner's report with the last entry in her weight loss journal -- which was taken no more than an hour or two before her death. And guess what?
Catherine: Her body came up light?
Nick: Six pounds light. That's six pints of blood at a pound each nowhere in or around the body. She was moved.
 
 
Hodges: Hey. The trace from the puncture wound came back. It's zinc, which is electrically coated onto steel to make galvanized pipe.
Catherine: Well, we should go back, expand the search perimeter, try to find the actual murder site.
Nick: Okay. I'll get a hold to swing. We're going to need some help.
Catherine: Okay.

 
 
 
Stanley Vespucci: I hear you're holding Vincent Lafoon on suspicion of murder. His lawyer called me. I'd be surprised. Yes, the guy is a bit rough around the edges, but I don't think that he..uh ... Hello.
 
 
Catherine: Nick. Why don't you ... uh ... take the offices, and Ronnie and I will start in the storage area.
 
Stanley Vespucci: My name is Stanley.  But you call me Stan.
 

 
 
 
 
 


 
Nick:  Hey.
Catherine:  Hey, Nicky, what do you got?
 
Nick:  I've got the hat Lafoon was wearing in the surveillance video. The wear on the strap indicates that it's been set larger ... like it was adjusted for somebody with a bigger head or something.
 
Nick:  So I'm going to get it back, see if I can get some prints off it.
Catherine:  Okay, I'll ... uh ... meet you back at the lab.

 
Dickie Jones: Howdy. Dickie Jones. And you are?
Catherine: Busy.
Dickie Jones: How about after your shift, I take you out for a cup of coffee? And I could tell you my whole life story.
Catherine: No, thanks.
Dickie Jones: It's just a cup of coffee, doll. I'm not asking you to make love.
 
Dickie Jones:  Not right away, anyway.
 
Dickie Jones: You know, I could open up new worlds to you. Have you ever had the back of those thighs kissed by a man ... who's standing up?
 
Dickie Jones: So you find dwarves funny?

Catherine: Sometimes, yeah.
Dickie Jones: Come on, what do you say? Is it because of my receding hairline?
 
Catherine: I don't go out with persons of interest in an ongoing investigation.
Dickie Jones: Well, I just think you might be missing out, pookie.
Catherine: Don't call me pookie.
 
Dickie Jones: But you haven't told me your name.
Catherine: Catherine.
 
Dickie Jones: Catherine.
Catherine: Catherine.
Dickie Jones: Catherine. Well, Catherine, we little people see things from a different perspective -- things other people might miss.
 
Catherine: If you're implying that you know something about Weatherly's death, and you're not giving it up, that makes you, at a minimum, an accessory after the fact, -- 
 
Catherine: -- and that buys a long stretch for a stubby guy.
Dickie Jones: I'm just talking, doll-face.
Stanley Vespucci: Dickie. Why don't we leave the nice woman alone to do her work?
Catherine: Here's my card.
 
Catherine: If there's anything that you want to tell me as it pertains to the case ... 
 
Catherine: Uh ... call me.
 
Dickie Jones: What are you doing? 
Stanley Vespucci: Don't complicate things, Dickie.
Dickie Jones: I'm just trying to work-- 

 
 
DISSOLVE TO: 



(He pulls up the driver license for VINCENT LAFOON. He notes the height:
5'10&quot;.) 
 
 
 

 
Nick: Hey, Archie, could you bring up the surveillance video from Repulsion Pictures, please?
Archie: Yeah, got it over here.
 
Nick: What's the best you can get me on the face?
 
Nick: He seems to be deliberately looking away from the camera. Take him to the window.
Nick: Freeze that. Zoom in on the sleeve. Does that jacket look a little small for that guy to you?
Archie: Maybe.
Nick: I measured the height of the window. It's five feet. How tall is the guy?
Archie: Well, he's a head taller than that window.
Nick: Vincent Lafoon's only five-foot-ten. This guy's six-foot-two, six-foot-three, easy. And a lot rounder. The only guy that big in the bunch is Mason.
 
Nick:  Catherine, it's Nick. Listen, the surveillance video footage is a fake. I think we got the wrong brother in custody. I think Mason set up Vincent to set Oliver up. It's getting complicated.

Catherine:  Hey, Ronnie, anything?

Ronnie: No. This place is creeping me out.
Catherine: It's supposed to.
 
 
 
 
 
Catherine: I think we just found our murder weapon. Hidden in plain sight.
 
Ronnie: Catherine? I've got something else here.
 
Catherine: Looks like Weatherly's missing heel.
 
Catherine: This is where she died.
 
Catherine: Ah, damn. 
 
Catherine: Oh, good.
Catherine: Auxiliary generator just kicked in.
 
Catherine: And I don't have any service.
 
Ronnie: Mine's dead, too.
 
Catherine: I'm going to get a dolly for you to move this thing. Photo it and get it back to the lab.
 
Ronnie: Okay.


 

 
 
Ronnie: Here you go. Thanks!
 
Ronnie: Damn it.
 
Ronnie:  Control, this is C-147 Lake for C13 Willows.
Dispatch:  Copy, C-147. Stand by. C-147, you have C-13. Over.
SPLIT SCREEN WITH: 
Catherine:  This is Catherine.
Ronnie:  Hey, Catherine, I left my cell phone at the studio. I need to go back and get it.
 
Catherine:  Yeah, you'd better. They're department issue. And if you lose it, you replace it.
Ronnie:  Does that include the cost of the contract?
Catherine:  Oh, yeah.
Ronnie:  Damnit. I'll see you later.
 
 
 


 
Catherine: We found the pipe that killed Weatherly. It's in the print lab being processed. She was killed on the soundstage and then dragged over.
Brass:  We've got a warrant out for Mason Lafoon. We're looking for him now.
Catherine:  Okay. Let me know what you find out.
 
 
Catherine:  What do you want?
Dickie Jones:  Pookie, it's me, Dickie.
Catherine:  I know.
Dickie Jones:  I've got information I think you might be interested in.
Catherine:  Okay, shoot.
Dickie Jones:  No. It has to be in person.
Catherine:  Where are you?
Dickie Jones:  I'm at the studio.
Catherine:  I thought there was no phone transmission from there.
Dickie Jones:  There wasn't. Now there is. That's how it is with phones and electrical storms. Look, it's urgent. Get down here as soon as you can. 
Catherine: I just came from there. Why didn't you tell me then, you annoying little man?
Dickie Jones:  The situation is evolving.
Catherine:  If you're screwing with me, I will to string you up and beat you senseless.


Dickie Jones:  I look forward to it. Just hurry.
 

 
 
Brass: That's you, Mason. All six feet, three inches of you impersonating your brother, which makes you good for Weatherly's murder. You did that one, too, didn't you?
Mason Lafoon: No, no, no. Nobody killed Weatherly, okay? She killed herself.
Brass: Oh, really? What, she axed herself in the back?
Mason Lafoon: No, you don't understand. She ... she ... It was an accident. She tripped.
 
Mason Lafoon: Good night, Weatherly. 
Stanley Vespucci: Good night, kid.
Mason Lafoon: Yeah, great stuff tonight. Have a good night.
Stanley Vespucci: All right. 
Mason Lafoon: See you tomorrow.
Weatherly Adams: See you tomorrow. Okay.

(Mason and Stanley rush over to check on her. They find her impaled and dead on the prop below.
Mason Lafoon:  Call 911! Call 911!
 
Stanley Vespucci: Wait, let's think about this.
Mason Lafoon: No, but Stanley ...
Stanley Vespucci: Mason, she's dead! This time she's not coming back. We've got so many health and safety violations. If we report one more set-related accident -- especially one resulting in a death -- we will lose our bond, our liability insurance, OSHA will shut us down, we'll get our asses sued for wrongful death, and that will be the end of Repulsion Pictures! Is that what you want? Is that what you want?!
Mason Lafoon:  No!
BACK TO SCENE.
Mason Lafoon: He ... he said &quot;the show must go on,&quot; th-that Weatherly ... would have wanted it that ... I don't ... we ... we didn't kill anybody.
Brass: But you made it look like a murder, and then you framed your brother.
Mason Lafoon: Well, he's been treating me like crap my entire life.

Brass: Yeah, but for that, you're going to send him to jail for the rest of his life?
Mason Lafoon: This was all ... this was all Stanley's idea.
Brass: Do you realize how much trouble you're in?
Mason Lafoon: Look, Stanley was the one who wanted to frame Vincent, okay? All I was supposed to do was clean up the accident scene and pretend to be Vince and buy the roses and that was it. The rest was him. If you don't believe me, talk to the dwarf.
 
Brass: Why? What did he have to do with it?
Mason Lafoon: Dickie saw the whole thing.
 
Stanley Vespucci: ... and that will be the end of Repulsion Pictures. Is that what you want? Is that what you want?!
Mason Lafoon: No!
Mason:  And he's been trying to shake down Stanley ever since.
BACK TO SCENE.
Brass: Well, that would explain the animosity.

Zack Putrid:  You gotta help me. I'm shot! I'm shot! You gotta get us out of here.
 
Ronnie:  It's gonna be okay. Keep your voice down.
Zack Putrid:  Do you know how many people I've killed in this place?
Ronnie: Shh!
Zack Putrid: The irony is exquisite, but the pain is more formidable, you know? I think the pain is preventing me from enjoying the irony.
 
Ronnie: Shh! Shut up!
 
Zack Putrid: But I ...
Ronnie: For the love of God, stop talking.

 
 
 
Zack Putrid: Oh, that's not good.  I should really stop talking and-and try and relax.
OTHER POV: Someone watches them. 
Ronnie: That's good. Yeah, stop talking.
Zack Putrid: But I can't stop talking. I've got that thing that ... It's a syndrome. It's a word ... There's a word for it.
Ronnie: Shh-shh-shh!
Zack Putrid: People have it. It's a syndrome. I can't stop talking.
Stanley: Zack.
 
 
Zack Putrid: Stanley ... Stanley, don't shoot me again. I don't want to die, okay? You already shot me twice. I learned my lesson, okay?
Ronnie: Sir, I'm a CSI. Think about what you're doing.

Ronnie: Put down your weapon.
Stanley Vespucci: I'm sorry, I don't think I can do that.
 
 
 
 
 
Oliver Zarco: Are you okay?
Ronnie:  Yeah.
 
 
Oliver Zarco: I really loved her.
 
 
Catherine:  Ronnie! 
 
 
 

 
Zack Putrid:  I'm editing late, like I always do, and I hear a shot. 
INSERT: FLASHBACK

Zack Putrid:  So, I go outside and check it out.
 
Zack Putrid: Stanley!
Stanley Vespucci: You gotta help me hide the dwarf before the cops come back. Dickie was blackmailing us about Weatherly's accident. He wants to bring the whole company down.
Zack Putrid: But you killed him! You killed Dickie!
Stanley Vespucci: What's it gonna be, Zack?  You gonna help me here or what?!


 
Zack Putrid: Next thing you know, I'm running for my life. And the nut job is chasing me. He shoots me, and then I see the hot ... you. And all I can think the whole time is, &quot;Man, this is great. I could use this stuff.&quot; I mean, this is life imitating art imitating life. You are so beautiful.
 
Zack Putrid: You are ... Your, your face is so expressive. It-it emotes. You do terror so good.
Ronnie: I wasn't acting.
Zack Putrid: I know.
Ronnie: I'll see you.
 
Zack Putrid: Well, hey, listen. If you ever get tired of fighting crime, you know, there's always a future for you in the horror business. I mean, I'll take you there.
Ronnie: Thanks, but I like what I'm doing.
Zack Putrid: Oh, hey, the offer's still good.
Ronnie: Okay, thanks.
Zack Putrid: No, I'm serious. I could build an entire franchise around you.
Ronnie: Bye.
 
Zack Putrid:  Seriously. Give me a call.

 
 
 
 

Robbins: That is impressive. As the woman's throat is being slashed, you can actually see the entire transverse view of the trachea.
David Phillips: That's all you've got to say?
 
Robbins: I believe I can see the epiglottis.
David Phillips: Epiglottis? What about the pathos? I mean ... what about the humanity? This may be Weatherly's finest performance.
 
David Phillips: Oh, just watch the movie.
 
SLIDE TO BLACK.

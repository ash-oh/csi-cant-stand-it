[EXT./INT. VENETIAN HOTEL -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Billboard with the picture of the two fighters.)</p>
<p>(The guests walk on the red carpet to the front door. The doorman opens the door for them.)</p>
<p>(The hotel door opens and the guests walk inside.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: The fight inside.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: The sign outside the lobby reads: &quot;STEELE vs. MOLINA&quot;, &quot;Revenge of the Century&quot; and &quot;November 9, 2002&quot;.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: Inside the ring. / Photographers snap pictures.)</p>
<p>(The fighter throws a punch.)</p>
<p>(The MAN and The WOMAN wave to the crowd as photographers take their pictures. They enter the hotel.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: Fight scenes inside the ring.)</p>
<p>(The Man and the WOMAN walk across the hotel lobby. A MAN runs across the lobby floor. A group of young, black men saunter across the lobby floor after him. The leader wears a thick silver necklace.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: The Man and The Woman walk through the double doors and into the tunnel. Scenes of the main audience area.)</p>
<p>(Close up of the Everlast Belt around the fighter's waist.)</p>
<p>(The Man and The Woman walk under the tunnel. They enter the main audience area. They move to the side to take their seats. The audience cheers.)</p>
<p>(The camera moves in toward the main ring where the fight is happening.)</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: (shouting) Put your hands up! Put your hands up!</p>
<p>(Bell dings. The round ends.)</p>
<p><strong>Referee</strong>: That's enough! </p>
<p>(The audience applauds and cheers.)</p>
<p>(MOLINA raises his hands high in the air.)</p>
<p>(LAROI takes a seat in his corner.)</p>
<p><strong>Trainer</strong>: Come on, Laroi. TRAINER: He's okay! TRAINER: We're going to dry it up, Laroi. TRAINER: We're going to dry it up.</p>
<p>(The Manager claps from outside the ring.)</p>
<p>(A woman in a bikini holds up a card and walks around the ring. She flirts with the man with the black cowboy hat on. The woman in red standing next to him is not pleased with it.)</p>
<p><strong>Woman in Red</strong>: (hits the man next to her in black) Cut it out!</p>
<p><strong>Cut Man</strong>: Suck it up. Suck it up, son. Suck it up, son.</p>
<p><strong>From Molina's Corner</strong>: (in Spanish) Lo teine donde deseas! Me entiendes lo que te digo? El cuerpo ... siempre moviendo ...</p>
<p><strong>From Steele's Corner</strong>: Laroi, listen to me! You keep your hands up, hear? He's killing you with that left.</p>
<p><strong>Laroi</strong>: Bum don't got the heart to put me down.</p>
<p><strong>From Steele's Corner</strong>: Yeah, well, you better start throwing your hands, hook to the body hook to the head, upper cut. Like we worked it in the gym.</p>
<p>(The Bell dings signaling the start of the next round.)</p>
<p>(MOLINA stands up and is ready. He immediately starts throwing a series of punches at LAROI.)</p>
<p>(LAROI STEELE is backed into a corner and is taking a beating. MOLINA turns to look at the REFEREE. Not seeing any sign to stop the fight, MOLINA throws a final punch that brings LAROI STEELE to his knees. He falls bleeding to the floor.)</p>
<p><strong>Referee</strong>: One! Two! Three! That's it!</p>
<p>(MOLINA jumps up and holds his arms high in victory. The REFEREE checks LAROI STEELE. LAROI'S trainers rush into the ring to check on him. They crowd around him.)</p>
<p><strong>Trainer</strong>: Laroi! Laroi, talk to me! Come on, Laroi! Come on, baby, talk to me. Laroi! Come on, get the doctor! Step it!</p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. HOTEL - FIGHT RING -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(LAROI STEELE is face down in the fight ring. Above him are a pair of feet that turns and walks toward the side of the ring. GRISSOM and WARRICK approach the ring. BRASS is already inside the ring. BRASS sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Laroi, &quot;The Fists Of&quot; Steele.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: WFB Welterweight Champion. Nineteen wins.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: One loss. Boxers have died in the ring before. Why is this one a crime?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Casino management got a heads-up from the sports book. Five hours before the opening bell Steele goes from a two-to-one favorite to a five-to-one underdog.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Fight fixing?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's a felony. And if death occurs during commission of a felony, that's a murder.</p>
<p>CUE TITLE MUSIC: (PRELAP)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM'S pager beeps.)</p>
<p>STOP MUSIC:</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. ROADWAY -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The OFFICER lifts the crime scene tape for GRISSOM as he makes his way to the site. CATHERINE is already there taking pictures.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Gang member. </p>
<p><strong>Vega</strong>: Tenth street vandal </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Isolated incident or they having a war?</p>
<p><strong>Vega</strong>: It's hard to tell. Vandals are based in L.A. But on a weekend like this ... brings knuckleheads in from all over.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Witnesses?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: They were all in the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Aren't they always?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks down at the dead man. Next to his head is a flyer for: &quot;STEELE VS. MOLINA&quot;, &quot;Revenge of the Century&quot;, &quot;Saturday, November 9, 2002&quot; and &quot;To Win a 2003 Corvette&quot;)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM'S pager beeps. He looks at it. The message reads: (11:24 pm) &quot;Call Nick Stokes&quot;.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. JEWELRY STORE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The MANAGER holds an ice pack to her forehead. In front of her is a customer, MRS. RAMSEY. They're arguing with each other.)</p>
<p><strong>Manager</strong>: We are just trying to be reasonable here.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Ramsey</strong>: I am not giving this back unless I get my ring.</p>
<p><strong>Manager</strong>: Mrs. Ramsey, it is not our policy to allow clients to ... </p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Ramsey</strong>: Oh, really? I guess you need a new policy, don't you?</p>
<p><strong>Manager</strong>: Now you are being unreasonable.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Ramsey</strong>: Now you ...</p>
<p>(The argument continues in the background. Deeper inside the store, GRISSOM walks in. NICK is already there looking around.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Smash and grab. Left that behind.</p>
<p>(NICK indicates the metal rod left inside the smashed display case.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How many guys?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: One. Yeah. Waited till the manager was alone knocked her down and hopped the counter. Got away with a whole sack full of stones. It takes some stones to pull off a job like this.</p>
<p>(SARA walks in carrying her kit.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Good evening, gentlemen. What have we got?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to SARA) Well, you and I have got a dead boxer. Nick, you're going to get to run this solo.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah. We're tapped out. Welcome to fight night.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<hr />
[INT. HOTEL - ARENA -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(SARA opens her kit and takes out a pair of latex gloves. WARRICK works on the opposite corner.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Okay. What are we looking for?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Blinding agents in the vaseline, stimulants in the water...</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So ... basically, everything goes to tox.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Nice sport.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, it's only dirty if you make it dirty. You know, boxing's about discipline.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It's two guys beating their brains out in a race for early-onset Parkinson's.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No, no, you know, it's mind and body. (WARRICK stands up.) Mind and body. If you train one and not the other you're half a person. What'd you find?</p>
<p>(SARA looks in the plastic tub and finds nothing but bloody saliva. She fixes a smile on her face and keeps it there.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Saliva.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Oh, the spit bucket.</p>
<p>(SARA picks the bucket up and turns around to face WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What's so funny?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Smiling, uh, represses the gag reflex.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: This is coming from the same woman who processed fecal fat from a ruptured colon.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Every crim's got at least one problem area. Mine's saliva.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Want me to get that for you?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No, no.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You're sure.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Mind and body, right?</p>
<p>(WARRICK nods and turns away to go back to his corner. SARA's left carrying the bucket.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. HOTEL -- ARENA]</p>
<p>(Out in the stands, GRISSOM and BRASS talk with the REFEREE.)</p>
<p><strong>Referee</strong>: Everybody knew they hated each other. They fought two times before. Title wasn't even on the line tonight. Just pride.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: How'd the other fights go down?</p>
<p><strong>Referee</strong>: I didn't get to ref them, but I saw them ... $39.95 a pop. Goddamned Pay-Per-View's just like stealing, but they were good fights. Laroi won both of them. First one was a knockout in the eighth off this sweet right hook. The other was a ... a TKO in the tenth, yeah. Uh, he really dropped the hammer on Molina that time.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, evidently, Molina hammered back tonight.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Two previous wins by knockout ... tonight, he dies. What's up with that?</p>
<p><strong>Referee</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did you notice anything out of the ordinary about either fighter? Slowed reactions, unusual strength?</p>
<p><strong>Referee</strong>: All I noticed is that boy took one hell of a beating.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM nods.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. PARKING LOT -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE examines the ground in between the parked cars. In the background, DET. VEGA also examines the ground.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE finds a bullet. She puts down evidence marker #1 to mark the find. Near the bullet she finds a gun.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (smiling) I got a gun.</p>
<p><strong>Vega</strong>: Make that two.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks up and sees VEGA holding up the second gun.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE continues to look around. She finds a third gun inside the back seat of a gun. She puts down evidence marker #3 on the car and picks up the gun to look at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Put up a couple of booths we could have ourselves a gun show out here. </p>
<p><strong>Vega</strong>: Disposable firearms. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: A couple of young men run in between the cars throwing the guns around as they flee.)</p>
<p><strong>Vega</strong>: (V.O.) They know we can't link them to the weapons if we can't find the weapons on them.</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: Let's go!</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Smith &amp; Wesson .40. High end.</p>
<p><strong>Vega</strong>: They're stealing their way to better guns.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And bringing them to Vegas for target practice. Great.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. JEWELRY STORE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(NICK examines the glass casing. He finds a smudge of blood on the glass inside.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The thief smashes the glass and starts grabbing the jewelry from the case. The thief reaches into the case and cuts his/her arm on the jagged edge. A large drop of blood falls on the glass in the case. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(NICK reaches in and takes a swab of the blood.)</p>
<p>(The MANAGER hands NICK a slip of paper with the stolen items listed.)</p>
<p><strong>Manager</strong>: That's everything he got.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What's it highlighted for?</p>
<p><strong>Manager</strong>: It's a Riviera necklace. We loaned it to a couple for the fight and they refuse to return it until we return the ring that they brought in for cleaning.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Which was stolen along with the other items, right?</p>
<p><strong>Manager</strong>: Exactly-- and they won't leave until we get this sorted out. Can you help me out here?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (declines) Sorry, mediation's not really my thing.</p>
<p><strong>Manager</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>(NICK reaches for his phone and dials.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mm-hmm. O'Riley? Stokes, listen, I'm at a smash and grab. Lots of glass, a little blood. Do me a favor: Check the local hospitals. Anyone comes in with a forearm laceration, it could be our guy. Thanks, man.</p>
<p>(NICK hangs up. While he was on the phone, NICK notices MR. RAMSEY watching him.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. HOTEL - LOCKER ROOM -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM interviews ADELLE CROSS, the Fight Promoter.)</p>
<p><strong>Adelle Cross</strong>: I promoted this match, Mr. Grissom. I spent sixteen months of my life stroking fighters, managers, handlers, and kissing a whole lot of ass that never got past junior high and I resent the implication that the fight was fixed, or that Laroi Steele's death was anything other than a tragedy.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM puts his gloves on and looks at the locker room.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: These photographs are from...?</p>
<p><strong>Adelle Cross</strong>: The last Steele-Molina fight.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What, does he use them for motivation?</p>
<p><strong>Adelle Cross</strong>: And for show. Boxing is theater.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, according to your poster, this fight was about revenge.</p>
<p><strong>Adelle Cross</strong>: Boxers fight for money. The rest of it is just hype.</p>
<p>(From the locker, GRISSOM takes out the gloves.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: These Mr. Molina's?</p>
<p><strong>Adelle Cross</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: From tonight's fight?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM puts the gloves in a bag.)</p>
<p><strong>Adelle Cross</strong>: Yeah. Technically, after a fit those gloves become property of the boxing commission.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Right now, they're evidence, so they belong to me.</p>
<p><strong>Adelle Cross</strong>: What do you think you're going to find on those gloves -- liniment? Like Sonny Liston used to blind Cassius Clay? The sport has come a long way since then.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's still two skulls and four fists. It hasn't come that far.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at the top shelf of the locker where he got the gloves. He sees something.)</p>
<p><strong>Adelle Cross</strong>: What did you find?</p>
<p>(He taps the shelf with his flashlight.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What appears to be a unique metal: Mercury.</p>
<p><strong>Adelle Cross</strong>: Like in a thermometer?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Amongst other things.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(WARRICK and SARA walk through the hospital hallway. Seated in the hallway is a man with a bloodied cut on his forearm.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Looks like it was fight night for a lot of people.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It sure does. And some guys get paid a million bucks for it.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. HOSPITAL - ROOM -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(WARRICK and SARA question JAVIER MOLINA who is giving a urine sample.)</p>
<p><strong>Javier Molina</strong>: Sorry to keep you waiting, but, uh, commission rules, you know? Before and after a fight. Boxing and drugs don't mix, you know?</p>
<p>(He finishes and gives the sample to the man waiting in the doorway.) </p>
<p><strong>Javier Molina</strong>: All yours.</p>
<p>(The MAN leaves. JAVIER MOLINA washes his hands.)</p>
<p><strong>Javier Molina</strong>: So ... que onda? What's the crime lab want with me?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, for starters, we need to see your hands.</p>
<p><strong>Javier Molina</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Is that a &quot;no&quot;?</p>
<p><strong>Javier Molina</strong>: No.</p>
<p>(JAVIER MOLINA holds out his hands. SARA takes a swab of his knuckles.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: One more.</p>
<p>(SARA swabs his other hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Javier Molina</strong>: Now, who do you think you're looking at -- Felix Trinidad?</p>
<p>(JAVIER MOLINA moves to look at his injuries in the mirror.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (shakes her head) Who is that? </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Felix Trinidad is a fighter who was once accused of dipping his wraps in ice water before a fight. It turns the tape and gauze into a hardened cast. It's like punching with concrete.</p>
<p><strong>Javier Molina</strong>: And it also shreds your hands. Mine are clean.</p>
<p>(JAVIER MOLINA picks up his thick silver chain necklace off of the shelf in front of him.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: A fighter's lost his life. We're just making sure that there was no unfair advantage. </p>
<p><strong>Javier Molina</strong>: All I did was out-punch Laroi. Okay, you think I wanted it to go down like this? I mean, people are going to remember me now like Ray Mancini when he killed that Korean guy. That's my legacy now. Ah, this wasn't my fault, all right? He brought it upon himself talking all that trash saying I could never beat him. (He puts his chain on.) Look ... he should have never came out in the seventh round. He could barely stand up. I knew it was over right then.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So why did you keep hitting because real fighters don't stop hitting until somebody makes them, all right? When you're in the ring, your life's in the ref's hands.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Inside the ring, JAVIER MOLINA swings at LAROI STEELE. He waits and looks at the REFEREE. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Javier Molina</strong>: Now, one word from that ref, and I would have stopped.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Inside the ring, MOLINA turns away from looking at the REFEREE and swings at STEELE again.)</p>
<p><strong>Javier Molina</strong>: (V.O.) But he never gave the word.</p>
<p>(End of flashback.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Only on cable.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: It never ceases to amaze me the damage one human being can inflict on another.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Or how much damage a human body can sustain. A heavyweight can land a punch at a thousand pounds per square inch.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV to: Black and white top view of a boxer taking a hit. The view includes a red-colored brain inside the boxer's head. When the boxer takes the punch, the brain takes the hit.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) The energy of the punch is transferred through the cerebrospinal fluid compressing the brain against the skull temporarily disrupting neural activity. (The boxer falls to the ground.) Like a short circuit. Too many short circuits and the brain shuts down.</p>
<p>(End of CGI POV. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And hence, a knockout.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: This guy should have been so lucky.</p>

<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Yeah, I thought so, too. I did a postmortem angiogram.</p>
<p>(They walk toward the x-rays on the display.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: It's a basilar subarachnoid hematoma the result of a massive ...</p>

<p>(Quick CGI POV to: Inside the neck where the artery breaks and bleeds out.)</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's called an uppercut.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: You say tomato and I say Cause of Death ... Gil, I never had you pegged as a fight fan.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm not, really. My first year as a criminalist, I thought boxing would be a good place to observe live blood spatter. So, I went to a couple of bouts. There wasn't much spatter. Some interesting bruise formations, though.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: So, uh, this is a socially acceptable live-subject laboratory for you?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (shakes his head) Yeah. Not in this case.</p>

<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Yeah. (ROBBINS takes a moment to read the results. GRISSOM leans in to look at the body.) Professional athlete. Would have expected performance enhancers -- uh, creatine, dianobol. This man had sufentanil in his system.</p>

<p><strong>Referee</strong>: Hey, he's always been a lucky guy.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, I know, I'm sure he is. Well, you know how this works. I mean, you hear the fight's fixed you tip off your cousin for a piece of the action he tells a couple of friends, so on, so on. They make a bet at the last minute, and the odds go south.</p>
<p><strong>Referee</strong>: Hey, big fight, money moves around.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, yeah, that's cool. This is Vegas. Money flows. As long as it doesn't flow out of your pocket. (pause) Maybe that's why you let the fight go on so long. Yeah, you see a fighter in trouble you give him a standing eight. If he comes out a winner, you're in the poorhouse.</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We know that. We know you're a good guy. So what made you dope up Laroi Steele?</p>

<p><strong>Gerry Barone</strong>: We kept it out of the press but in their last fight, Molina hurt him bad.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: How bad?</p>
<p><strong>Gerry Barone</strong>: The signs were all there in training-- sagging eye, drooping shoulder, brain damage down the road. Laroi couldn't handle another beating. But I couldn't talk him out of this fight. Molina got under his skin. Laroi wouldn't let it go. (beat) taught him not to quit.</p>

<p><strong>Jerome Anderson</strong>: (chuckles) I went to school. In fact, I have carefully analyzed business models of African American entrepreneurs such as Darian Daze at Dis-Kard Enterprises which grosses $250 million a year. And my analysis has led me to understand that an emerging CEO needs to have as solid a command of flow charts and spreadsheets as he does a bad-ass street rep.

<p><strong>Greg</strong>: We have a problem.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Pile it on.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, in the interests of posterity I took it upon myself to establish provenance for the killer gloves I mean DNA-wise. On my own time, of course of which I have precious little so that should count for something.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (exasperated) Greg, why are you always doing this?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (simply) Because you make me nervous. (beat) My point is, the epithelials found on the surface of the glove. They're not Laroi Steele's. Those aren't the gloves that killed him.</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>

<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<hr />
[INT. LOCKER ROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(WARRICK breaks the lock on the locker and opens it. GRISSOM remains a distance away and looks around.)</p>
<p>(WARRICK picks up the boxing gloves.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Gloves look brand-new. Padding's still stiff. It's like they've never been used.</p>
<p>(WARRICK bags the gloves. GRISSOM still looks at the locker from the distance. WARRICK finds something on the ground.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What are all these dots?</p>
<p>(He picks it up. Camera zooms in for a close up.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Looks like a little piece of red leather.</p>
<p>(WARRICK keeps a sample. GRISSOM kneels down and looks at the grating on the ground. Camera zooms in for a close up.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hmm ... and more mercury.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, Molina does take it for his stomach, right?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He's a sloppy eater.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. PRACTICE GYM -- DAY]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and WARRICK enter the gym.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mercury's volatile. It emits a toxic vapor at room temperature.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So you're saying if I find the vapor I find the mercury.</p>
<p>(WARRICK plugs the machine in. He turns off the lights. He and GRISSOM check out the boxing ring and the various gym apparatus.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Grissom.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at and sees the vapors.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>

[INT. CSI -- LAB]</p>
<p>(SARA takes out MOLINA'S tape. She pieces together the signature for &quot;ADELLE CROSS&quot;.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM -- DAY]</p>
<p>(BRASS and SARA interview ADELLE CROSS, the fight promoter.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: That your signature?</p>
<p><strong>Adelle Cross</strong>: Yeah. That's my signature. So what?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, according to fight rules you were supposed to watch Molina wrap his hands and sign them, then watch him put on his gloves and then sign those.</p>
<p><strong>Adelle Cross</strong>: Which is what I did.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Okay, you signed his wraps but the gloves that we found were not the gloves used in the fight. Molina switched them.</p>
<p><strong>Adelle Cross</strong>: There's no way.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You watched Molina glove up?</p>
<p><strong>Adelle Cross</strong>: Not exactly. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: JAVIER MOLINA is getting ready in the locker room. His gloves aren't on yet. He tells everyone to get out.)</p>
<p><strong>Javier Molina</strong>: Come on. Get her out of here.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Adelle Cross</strong>: Look. It was a big fight. There was a lot of pressure. You've got to give the fighters a little space.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So, no one saw him put his gloves on.</p>
<p><strong>Adelle Cross</strong>: I guess not.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. HOTEL LOBBY]</p>
<p>(MRS. RAMSEY walks through the lobby with NICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Ramsey</strong>: I should have called you first to apologize for my husband's unfortunate outburst.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You know what? You should apologize. But not for your husband.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Ramsey</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You know damn well your diamond isn't a diamond. It's a substance called moissanite.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Ramsey</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Really. White light refractions and inclusions of your stone are inconsistent with a real diamond's. </p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Ramsey</strong>: Then the thief must have switched the stone before you caught him.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: The thief ... Yeah ... I don't think so. Because before the store could clean your ring I was able to collect DNA.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Ramsey</strong>: Wow, that's very thorough of you. Isn't it?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You know, it's my guess you switched out the stone some time ago because judging from your husband's response he knew nothing about it.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Ramsey</strong>: Mr. Stokes, can I ... ? You're from Texas, aren't you? 'Cause I can always tell.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I'm a criminalist for Clark Country, Nevada.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Ramsey</strong>: Yes, well, one's body might reside elsewhere but one's heart never really leaves home, does it? Look, all you have to do is say that you recovered a fake diamond which is the truth.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So you can file a false insurance claim which is a felony? Better yet, why don't I have an adjuster come over to your place and check out all your rocks see which ones are real and which ones you've switched out? No? Look, if you find yourself in a hole, the best thing to do is stop digging. You know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Ramsey</strong>: Sounds like a plan.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Put it in motion.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI -- LAB]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM watches as they wheel in racks of clothes.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I guess clothes do make &quot;The Man.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: In this case, &quot;The Man&quot; makes the clothes ... and produces the music ... and represents the athletes ... when he's not involved in street shootings, of course.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And when you asked him what he was wearing the night of the murder, he couldn't remember?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: As far as he's concerned murder is just another way to separate himself from the Calvins and Ralphs of the world.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Calvin and Ralph?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Klein and Lauren. Fashion.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Oh. Well, for most CSIs, fashion is irrelevant.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Speak for yourself. The only thing between me and a wardrobe like this is a few extra zeros on my paycheck.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, what's standing between you and this Tiny Tim character?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The mojave. Highway patrol is out looking for our guy. Odds are that Tiny Tim is back in L.A. Evidence disposed of along the way. That means my last chance of connecting the dots is somewhere along these racks. Fibers, GSR, blood.</p>
<p><strong>Vega</strong>: Hey. Guess who never left town?</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(VEGA shows CATHERINE the body. A 10 of clubs playing card is tucked in the victim's shirt.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Calling card?</p>
<p><strong>Vega</strong>: 10th street vandals.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE leans down and looks at the firearm next to the victim.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: .380 automatic. Tiny's favorite piece.</p>
<p><strong>Vega</strong>: Odds are it traces back to the original murder.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Same as it always does.</p>
<p><strong>Vega</strong>: Somebody gets dissed.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The fight. The first victim walks along side the ring. He's on the phone and just happens to step on JEROME ANDERSON'S foot.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) Wrong place, wrong time. It doesn't take much to set someone off.</p>
<p>(JEROME ANDERSON stands up and pushes the man aside. He starts running across the lobby as he did in the teaser. JEROME ANDERSON and his gang follow behind him.)</p>
<p>(They catch up with him in the parking lot. One of the gang fires the gun killing the man in the parking lot.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The snakebacks kill a vandal. Then the vandals kill a snakeback.</p>
<p><strong>Vega</strong>: Everyone goes home satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Round and round and round it goes. Where it stops, nobody knows.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE snaps a photo.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI -- LAB]</p>
<p>(WARRICK and GRISSOM walk through the hallway on their way to the lab.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: There was this one case where a boxer put lead shot in his gloves to increase his punching power. And also ancient greek limapulists used a glove weighted with metal, called a &quot;cestus.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You making a classical reference?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah. I thought you'd like that.</p>
<p>(They walk into the lab where SARA is looking through the scope.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Question is, if Molina was using mercury to load up how'd it get into his gloves?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, he injected it. (SARA rolls away from the scope allowing WARRICK to look through it.) Those circular pieces of leather that you found in Molina's locker are the same diameter as a 14-gauge needle.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, mercury's incredibly dense. </p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV of the needle piercing through the red leather glove and inserting the mercury inside the glove.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) It could easily be contained in the leather in the form of a boxing glove.</p>
<p>(End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The boxing gloves weighed eight ounces so the question is, would a few ounces of mercury be enough to cause the damage that we observed on the victim?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I smell an experiment.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at SARA. SARA smiles.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI -- LAB]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM ties the gloves on WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: All right. Normal gloves. (WARRICK takes his position in front of the punching bag.) Ready.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: And ... go.</p>
<p>(WARRICK starts punching the bag. The machine records the force of the hits. WARRICK looks over at SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Good?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Little more. (SARA looks at WARRICK and smiles.) Good.</p>
<p>(WARRICK stops.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: SARA loads the gloves with mercury. She hands the gloves to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Loaded gloves.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: And ... go.</p>
<p>(WARRICK hits the punching bag.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Ooh, these things are heavy.</p>
<p>(The monitor recording the force of the punches goes on &quot;OVERLOAD&quot;. SARA stops WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Good. Good, good.</p>
<p>(WARRICK stops. He raises his hands and walks over to see the results.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And mercury kills Steele.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM]</p>
<p>(SARA, BRASS and WARRICK re-question JAVIER MOLINA.)</p>
<p><strong>Javier Molina</strong>: Boxing is a combat sport. Sometimes fighters die, okay? That's all part of the game.</p>
<p><strong>Lawyer</strong>: Laroi Steele's death was a tragedy not a murder.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: It became when your client injected mercury into his gloves.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: And your hands, Molina literally, became lethal weapons.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: MOLINA warming up in the locker room. He opens the locker and takes the syringe. He injects the mercury into the tips of the gloves.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: In the ring, MOLINA fights STEELE. When he's not throwing a punch, his hands are down at his sides.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (V.O.) Heavy gloves. That's why you kept your hands to your side. It also kept the mercury on the tip of your glove.</p>
<p>(Cut to: MOLINA punching the bag during practice. Little beads of mercury fall to the floor. Cut to: MOLINA throwing punches in the ring.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (V.O.) With every punch a little bit got forced down through the padding through the seams and on to your hands. That's how it got on your wraps.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: And into your lungs.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: And finally out into your urine. We tested the sample that you gave the boxing commission after the fight. It came back positive for mercury.</p>
<p><strong>Javier Molina</strong>: I have empacho. I take mercury for my stomach problems.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We didn't find mercury in your stomach. We found it in your locker, on your gym bags, on your wraps ...</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: When the fight was over, your trainer cut the tape off your gloves and you took the pieces and put them in the hamper along with a pair of sparring gloves, just in case anybody wondered what had happened to them.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: But the real gloves were in your gym bag at that hospital, weren't they?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Steele had already kicked your ass ... twice before? Must have been humiliating.</p>
<p><strong>Javier Molina</strong>: You push a man too far, there are consequences.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: At the press conference, LAROI STEELE smiles at MOLINA. MOLINA glares at STEELE. Cut to: MOLINA in the ring glaring at STEELE. Cut to: MOLINA punching STEELE. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You knew there was no way you could beat Steele in a fair fight.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: The best way to punish a guy is to beat him to death in the ring in front of two million people on pay-per-view.</p>
<p><strong>Javier Molina</strong>: (smiling) That's boxing.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No, that's murder. I'll see you in court.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. OBSERVATION ROOM/HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM watches from the Observation Room and smiles. He leaves the room and walks through the hallway.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer 1</strong>: So that means the title's vacant, right?</p>
<p><strong>Officer 2</strong>: Not for long. I heard it's Lopez versus Lewis at Caesar's in six months.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM shakes his head and leaves.)</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>

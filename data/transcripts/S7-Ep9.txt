<p>(They make their way toward the lake.) </p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong>: (o.s.) All right, we're all hooked up-- let 'er rip.</p>
<p>(A couple of divers are in the lake near the car.) </p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Ready to waste my morning on another Mickey Dunn sighting? Yeah, right.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The guy's been spotted more places than Elvis.</p>

[INT. KARAOKE BAR â€“ NIGHT]</p>
<p>(A man is on stage singing.) </p>
<p><strong>Michael Myers</strong>: (singing) 'Cause this fine old world keeps spinning round, I've been a puppet, a pauper, a pirate, a poet, a pawn and a king, I've been up, down, over and out and I know one thing, Each time I find myself laying flat on my face, I pick myself up and get back in the race. That's life, That's life. I just can't deny it, Many times, I've thought of quittin', But my heart won't buy it. </p>
<p>(A man in the audience simply enjoys the singing.) </p>
<p><strong>Michael Myers</strong>: (singing) But if there's nothin' shakin', Come here, this July, I'm gonna roll myself up, in a big ball, and die -- my, my. </p>
<p>(The audience cheers and applauds.) </p>
<p><strong>Ken Billings</strong>: Shut the machine off. You can't top that.</p>
<p>(He laughs. He sees Michael Myers leaving the stage and stops him.) </p>
<p><strong>Ken Billings</strong>: Hey, whoa, whoa, man, man. No, no, you're not going anywhere until I buy you a round. Come on.</p>
<p>(Michael Myers stops and heads over to Ken, who is in a wheelchair. They shake hands.) </p>
<p><strong>Ken Billings</strong>: That's my music!</p>
<p>(Michael sits down.) </p>
<p><strong>Ken Billings</strong>: Them that can sing it, never heard of it, and them who heard of it, they can't sing it no more.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Myers</strong>: Well, there's still some of us left.</p>
<p><strong>Ken Billings</strong>: I thought I was the last of a dying breed.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Myers</strong>: Myers. Call me Michael.</p>
<p><strong>Ken Billings</strong>: Ken Billings. What are you drinking?</p>
<p><strong>Michael Myers</strong>: What do you got?</p>
<p><strong>Ken Billings</strong>: Tina, Tina.</p>
<p>(The waitress comes over and takes several Polaroids of the two men, drinking and having a grand time.) </p>
<p>(She hangs one up on the board.) </p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO: </p>
<p>[LATER] </p>
<p>(Everyone has gone and the two men are still having drinks.) </p>
<p><strong>Ken Billings</strong>: I don't remember the last time I closed a joint down. You know ... we gotta do this again.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Myers</strong>: Anytime. Now, can I give you a hand?</p>
<p><strong>Ken Billings</strong>: Oh, no, no, no, no. I'm fine; I'm fine. No problem.</p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO: </p>
<p>[EXT. KARAOKE BAR â€“ NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Michael Myers is behind Ken as they leave the karaoke bar. Ken is singing.) </p>
<p><strong>Ken Billings</strong>: (singing) Riding high in April, shot down in May ... </p>
<p>(Michael grabs the wheelchair bars.) </p>
<p><strong>Ken Billings</strong>: No, wait. I told you, I don't need any help.</p>
<p>(Ken lets Michael push him. He points to his car, the only one left in the parking lot.) </p>
<p><strong>Ken Billings</strong>: Right over there.</p>
<p>(Michael continues pushing Ken past his car.) </p>
<p><strong>Ken Billings</strong>: I thought I was drunk. No, back there. Back there.</p>
<p>(Michael isn't drunk. He continues to push Ken down the sidewalk.) </p>
<p><strong>Ken Billings</strong>: Back there!</p>
<p>(Now, he starts running.)</p>
<p><strong>Ken Billings</strong>: What are you doing? </p>
<p>(In front of him is the busy road.) </p>
<p><strong>Ken Billings</strong>: No, no, stop ... Stop! Stop! Stop!</p>
<p>(Ken uses his hands and tries to stop the wheels, but Michael continues to push the wheelchair toward the busy road.) </p>
<p><strong>Ken Billings</strong>: Stop! Stop! Help! Help!</p>
<p>(Michael pushes the wheelchair into the path of an oncoming SUV driven by a group of partying kids.)</p>
<p>(The car hits the wheelchair.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. ROAD -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Grissom examines the wheelchair. Brass is interviewing the kids.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: All right, fine. Okay, all right. Thanks.</p>
<p>(He finishes the interviews and heads over to Grissom. He sighs. Grissom snaps photos of the wheelchair.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: At least the driver was sober. I can't say the same about the boatload of high school kids he was driving around town. Listen to some of the wonderful statements I got: &quot;We go, 'errr ...' dude goes 'aah.' &quot;We go bam ... Dude goes, 'Aah!'&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The wheelchair brake attachment has been loosened.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, maybe it broke on impact.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Impact was from the left side. But the bolts were loosened on both sides.</p>
<p>(Grissom stands up and looks at the body on the road.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, then... that looks like we have a homicide-related road pizza.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah. Who ordered it?</p>
<p>FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[EXT. ROAD -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Grissom is measuring the distance from the car to the body. David Phillips is checking out the body.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Force of impact propelled the body just over 47 feet.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Not a lot of spatter.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: External damage, mostly superficial.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Bet he's mashed up on the inside.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Probably dead before he hit the ground.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: The car hits Ken Billings. End of flashback.)</p>
<p>(David checks the body and finds something.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Oop ... Wallet.</p>
<p>(He checks the wallet. Grissom looks around the area. The wallet info reads:<br />
BILLINGS, KEN<br />
7543 CASTLE BANKS RD.<br />
LAS VEGAS, NV 89101</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: License ... registration ... Kenneth Billings. Nevada resident. Date of birth, 11-9-52.</p>
<p>(David finds a photo in the front shirt pocket.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Photo.</p>
<p>(He hands the photo to Grissom. Grissom takes it and looks at it. It's a photo of Mickey Dunn and four other men standing in front of a Cadillac. Two of the men have large black X's on their faces.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. KARAOKE BAR -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Brass talks with Tina, the bartender. She pulls the Polaroid off the bulletin board and hands it to Brass.) </p>
<p><strong>Tina</strong>: Michael Myers. Never seen the guy before. Sure was the life of the party, though.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hmm. And the victim?</p>
<p><strong>Tina</strong>: Kenny -- a regular. He'd come in for Karaoke Nght. Drink a little, go home. You'd never notice him, except for the wheelchair.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, this is a late-night place. It ever get rough in here?</p>
<p><strong>Tina</strong>: Sometimes. You think it could've been a hate crime?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: It's a karaoke bar. I don't see a lot of hate here.</p>
<p><strong>Tina</strong>: Me neither.</p>
<p>(Nick looks at the WHO'S NEXT? sign up board. M. MYERS is listed at #9.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: M. Myers. Here he is, Jim. Knucklehead left us his autograph.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So what was our boy drinking?</p>
<p><strong>Tina</strong>: The good stuff -- Well's Head Lager.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You sell much of that?</p>
<p><strong>Tina</strong>: (shakes her head) I'm lucky if I move a case a year.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Got trash?</p>
<p><strong>Tina</strong>: (nods) Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Empties should give us DNA and fingerprints. Not that we really need them. Mr. Myers has already left us his photograph and signature.</p>
<p>(Nick snaps photos of the empty bottles) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: And he sang karaoke. Do you have video?</p>
<p><strong>Tina</strong>: Tape's in the machine.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Perfect.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Boy, you got to love it when a guy makes it easy for you.</p>
<p>(Nick chuckles.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) â€“ DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. CSI â€“ GARAGE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Catherine and Greg unwrap the Cadillac from the lake, making sure the plastic is completely under the car.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Mickey Dunn's ride. Well, I guess it looked better in the '70s.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Live fast, die young ... Doubt he left a good-looking corpse.</p>
<p>(Catherine opens the passenger's front door and all the sludge and water from the car pours out onto the plastic.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Look at this. Thirty years of toxins, pesticides, heavy metal ... maybe some decomp.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Little piece of Vegas history right here.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: You know, in â€˜Kicks and Kisses,' Lois O'Neill wrote a whole chapter about Mickey Dunn.</p>
<p>(Greg walks over with a sieve and water bottle. He places it on the bin.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What, that he was a thrill in the sack?</p>
<p>(Catherine grabs some sludge and puts it on the tray. Greg works through the dirt.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: No ... no, that was Tony Constantine. Apparently, Mickey wanted to go down in a barrage of bullets, like Sonny in â€˜The Godfather.' </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Quite the ego on that guy. Even in death, he was larger than life.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, sure, but all the original mobsters were like that: Tony, Mickey Dunn, Sam Braun ...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: My father was not a Mob guy.</p>
<p>(Greg stops.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I wasn't comparing ... or speaking ill of the dead.</p>
<p>(Catherine finds something in the car.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Greg -- </p>
<p>(She pulls out a skull. Greg clears off the sludge and they find the skull has a bullet hole in the center of its forehead.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Now we know how Dunn-Dunn died.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI â€“ A/V LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Sara and Archie watch the video of Michael Myers singing.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: How can we be sitting on this much evidence and still have nothing?</p>
<p><strong>Archie</strong>: Well, I can tighten up the image for you.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I don't think more pixels are going to solve the problem. You got the face.</p>
<p><strong>Archie</strong>: And the name.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Plus photos, witnesses, DNA samples, handwriting, prints. There's no record in DMV or AFIS.</p>
<p><strong>Archie</strong>: He knew exactly where the cameras were.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: He played right to them.</p>
<p><strong>Archie</strong>: Obviously wasn't afraid of being identified.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p>(Sara and Archie look at each other.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI -- LAB] </p>
<p>(Nick is in the lab working on the photo. He clears some of the dirt off, wipes it, then puts it under different lights.) </p>
<p>(He removes the black X's off the faces and comes up with a clear picture.)</p>
<p>(Camera moves along the row of men and stops on the man standing next to Mickey Dunn.) </p>
<p>FADE TO: </p>

<p><strong>Hooker</strong>: Same time next week?</p>
<p><strong>Mason Carter</strong>: Sure, baby.</p>
<p><strong>Hooker</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(She closes the door. He walks down the hallway and is stopped by an older woman peering out the open door.) </p>
<p><strong>Old Woman</strong>: Excuse me, sir? Please, could you help me with my bags? I hate to bother you, but my back ... Getting old ain't for sissies.</p>
<p>(Mason Carter walks into the room. She closes the door.) </p>
<p>[INT. ROOM 200]</p>
<p>(He reaches for the suitcases. From behind, she wraps something around his neck and pulls.)</p>
<p>(He chokes and dies.) </p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[INT. ROOM 200 -- DAY]</p>
<p>(Sara snaps photos of the dead man with the marking around his neck.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Garroted. Wire broke the skin but, from the discoloration, I'd say suffocation killed him.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Do you know anyone who'd want to do this to him?</p>
<p>(Sofia talks with the hooker.) </p>
<p><strong>Hooker</strong>: I know he wasn't into breath-play. Choking on purpose. More bang for your buck.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: After he left the room, did you hear anything -- argument, shouting â€“ anything like that?</p>
<p><strong>Hooker</strong>: No. Whatever happened, happened fast.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Okay, thank you; if we have any more questions, I'll contact you.</p>
<p>(The hooker leaves.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: I don't get it. A john walks by, the door may be open, but why walk in?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Who was the room registered to?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Well, the manager said an older woman. A &quot;Pamela Voorhees.&quot; He's got a camera in the lobby.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So we'll get a face. I'd love an address to go with that.</p>
<p>(Sara checks the bags. The labels are blank. The suitcases are light.)</p>
<p>(Sofia looks in the closet and finds it empty. Sara opens the suitcase and finds it empty as well.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Empty bags. Empty closet. Bags could have been a lure.</p>
<p>(David Phillips walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Hey, guys. Busy day.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey, David. David ... can you get us a TOD, please?</p>
<p>(He opens the victim's mouth and finds it stuffed.) </p>
<p><strong>David</strong>: Oh ... There's something in the mouth. Bizarre.</p>
<p>(He opens the crumpled photo. It's of Mickey Dunn.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: It's my second one today. (points) That guy got hit by a limo.</p>
<p>(Sara looks at the photo.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I guess that makes this a hit list.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You were a kid in the '70s.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You never heard of the &quot;Ghost Rider&quot; story? That has everything to do with Mickey Dunn. Yeah, August 12, 1976. Officer Eddie Sanchez was the real-life motorcycle cop who radios in the last known sighting of Mickey Dunn's funky, gold Cadillac.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Is this on record?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It's stuffed away in some police file somewhere. Know what happened to the cop?</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No one does. Officer Sanchez and his motorcycle disappeared that night.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What? In a puff of smoke?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: A puff of smoke -- never to be heard from again. Legend has it that you can still hear the Ghost Rider gunning up and down that highway. My grandmother used to try to scare me into good behavior with that one.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Did it work?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Not when I was six. No. But a .38 round-nosed lead bullet was what Nevada Highway Patrol used back in the day. And I don't need to tell you there was a lot of dirty cops back then.</p>
<p>(Catherine picks up the gold pin.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: There was a lot of dirty everything back then.</p>

<p><strong>&quot;Johnny D'Angelo&quot;</strong>: (singing) I just can't ... </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Shut up and get out of the car.</p>
<p>(Officer Mitchell opens the front door and helps &quot;Johnny D'Angelo&quot; out of the car.) </p>
<p><strong>&quot;Johnny D'Angelo&quot;</strong>: (singing) Checking out, but my heart won't buy it </p>
<p>(Officer Mitchell sees the revolver on the seat.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer Mitchell</strong>: Gun on the seat.</p>
<p>(Officer Mitchell frisks &quot;Johnny D'Angelo.&quot;)</p>
<p><strong>Officer Mitchell</strong>: He's clean.</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Johnny D'Angelo&quot;</strong>: (singing) And then I'd buy it </p>
<p>(He's handcuffed.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I thought I was clear on the &quot;shut up.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>&quot;Johnny D'Angelo&quot;</strong>: (singing) That's life. </p>
<p>(The officers pull him away from the convertible to put him in back of a squad car. Brass looks at the trunk.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Pop the trunk.</p>
<p>(Officer Mitchell pops the trunk.) </p>
<p><strong>&quot;Johnny D'Angelo&quot;</strong>: (singing) And as funny as it may seem ... </p>
<p>(The hood opens and inside are the â€˜fake' faces of the killers and of the old Spanish fisherman.) </p>
<p>(Brass looks at the masks.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT â€“ INTERVIEW ROOM â€“ DAY]</p>
<p>(Catherine removes &quot;Johnny D'Angelo's&quot; wig.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Chainsaw -- sound familiar?</p>
<p><strong>Mickey Dunn</strong>: You get to be my age, all kinds of things ring a bell. </p>
<p>(Brass pushes a photo of Officer Eddie Sanchez toward him.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: How about this? Any chimes?</p>
<p><strong>Mickey Dunn</strong>: That's a real good-lookin' boy. But as the poet said ... </p>
<p>(Mickey Dunn removes his face mask and moustache.) </p>
<p><strong>Mickey Dunn</strong>: &quot;It ain't me, babe.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mickey Dunn.</p>
<p><strong>Mickey Dunn</strong>: Back from the dead. (points to the fake skin still hanging on his neck) You missed a spot.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I think I got all I need.</p>
<p><strong>Mickey Dunn</strong>: (to Brass) Just going along.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, keep going, Mickey. Do you recognize him?</p>
<p>(Brass shows him Officer Eddie Sanchez's photo.) </p>
<p><strong>Mickey Dunn</strong>: Could be a dead cop.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, Officer Eddie Sanchez. He had a wife, two kids. He also had a skin condition commonly known as acne which he treated with tetracycline.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: [AUTOPSY ROOM] Dr. Robbins snaps photos of the glowing bones.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) That drug incorporated into his bones, making them glow under ultraviolet light.</p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Helped us identify him.</p>
<p>(Catherine sits down.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Thing's aren't looking too good for you, Mickey. So now we know we got a dead cop's body in your old car. So tell me what happened. You were skipping town and Eddie Sanchez pulled you over and you shot him point-blank?</p>
<p><strong>Mickey Dunn</strong>: (to Catherine) Like I told you, you missed a spot. You missed a big spot. I shot a lot of guys point-blank. But this nosy piece of garbage bike cop that you two are so teared-up about ... I shot him from 40 feet away with a soaking-wet revolver. It was one hell of a shot.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [LAKE â€“ NIGHT] Eddie Sanchez turns his bike in to the embankment near the lake. He parks his bike and follows the tire tracks in the dirt all the way to the lake.) </p>
<p><strong>Mickey Dunn</strong>: (V.O.) The poor dumb b*st*rd didn't know what hit him. </p>
<p>(He sees lights of the car in the lake.) </p>
<p><strong>Mickey Dunn</strong>: (V.O.) He thought he'd been trained. They don't prepare you for what I got.</p>
<p>(He's startled when Mickey Dunn comes up for air. He takes his gun out and points it at Mickey. Mickey starts to walk toward him.) </p>
<p>(He sees the gun in Mickey's hand.) </p>
<p><strong>Eddie Sanchez</strong>: Stop! Stop or I'll shoot!</p>
<p>(Mickey doesn't stop. He continues to walk toward Eddie.) </p>
<p><strong>Eddie Sanchez</strong>: I said stop!</p>
<p>(Mickey raises his gun and fires. He hits Eddie in the chest. Eddie falls back to the ground.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: Mickey smashes in Eddie's teeth.) </p>
<p><strong>Mickey Dunn</strong>: (V.O.) You found the skull had no teeth because I bashed 'em in with the barrel of my gun. </p>
<p>BACK TO SCENE.</p>
<p><strong>Mickey Dunn</strong>: And all the forensics in the world ain't gonna show you that when I smashed his face in ... I liked it.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You're under arrest, Mickey, for murder.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Thank God you blew me off when I didn't know better.</p>
<p>(Catherine gets up and heads out.) </p>
<p><strong>Mickey Dunn</strong>: Sam Braun's daughter. </p>
<p>(She stops at the door, surprised that he even recognized her.) </p>
<p><strong>Mickey Dunn</strong>: You think that I would ever forget a face? </p>
<p>(Quick flash to: [CASINO] Young Catherine in the casino as she smiles at Mickey.) </p>
<p><strong>Mickey Dunn</strong>: (V.O.) That face? </p>
<p>(He pushes her hair back and whispers to her.) </p>
<p><strong>Mickey Dunn</strong>: Meet me outside, 2:00 a.m. sharp.</p>
<p>BACK TO SCENE.</p>
<p><strong>Mickey Dunn</strong>: Ask yourself what force on earth would have kept me from your soft teenage graces. Only one: Daddy.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Sam Braun stopped you?</p>
<p><strong>Mickey Dunn</strong>: Sam always said that if I ever touched you, he'd tear me apart.<br />
(chuckles) That took a big pair to say that to me. He said that you were family. Still, now he's gone. We're here. We could always give it a go.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You're not going anywhere.</p>
<p>(Mickey gasps and clutches his chest. Brass gets up and checks on Mickey.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (to Catherine) He's having a heart attack. Call a paramedic.</p>
<p>(Catherine turns and leaves the room. Brass and the other officer in the room help Mickey to the floor.) </p>
<p><strong>Mickey Dunn</strong>: (gasps) Bum ticker ... right on time.</p>
<p>(Brass does chest compressions on Mickey.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Okay, take it easy, buddy. Take it easy.</p>
<p>FADE TO WHITE: </p>
<p>[INT. HOSPITAL â€“ ROOM]</p>
<p>(Mickey Dunn wakes up in a hospital bed. He's handcuffed to the bedframe. Catherine stands over him.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'll give you a hint: you're not in heaven. How long you been living with a bullet in your chest?</p>
<p><strong>Mickey Dunn</strong>: Who told you?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Why God invented X-rays.</p>
<p><strong>Mickey Dunn</strong>: You'd like to take it out, have a closer look. Ah, but you can't do that, not without killing me.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm guessing it's a .38 ... </p>
<p>(Quick flash to: [NIGHT] Derek Paul shoots Mickey Dunn and tosses the gun in the car.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: Robbins pulls out a bullet from autopsy.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) ...which matches the .38 that we took from the body of Derek Paul, -- </p>
<p>(Cut to: Greg sifts through the dirt found in the car and finds a bullet.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) -- which also matches the one that killed Eddie Sanchez.</p>
<p>BACK TO SCENE.</p>
<p>(Mickey Dunn smiles. Catherine sits CATHERINE: You like horror movies, Mickey?</p>
<p><strong>Mickey Dunn</strong>: You know ... I love 'em.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I got one for you.</p>
<p><strong>Mickey Dunn</strong>: Does it got a monster in it?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (chuckles) Yeah.</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: [NIGHT] Mickey crashes through the wire fence gate and onto the lake embankment. Derek Paul and the other workers follow him.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) I bet you heard it. It's strictly B-list stuff. No-name cast, summer release. </p>
<p>(They park and get out of the car. Derek walks up to the car.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) Four Vegas punks run a monster off the road. </p>
<p>(Derek shoots Mickey and tosses the gun in the car.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) They shoot him, they rob him, they leave him for dead. </p>
<p>(Derek pops the trunk and takes the suitcase of cash.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) But everybody knows that shooting the monster and killing him are never the same. </p>
<p>(They push the car into the lake. The car hits the water. Mickey opens his eyes.) </p>
<p>(The guys get in the car and drive away. Officer Eddie Sanchez arrives on his bike.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) A young honest cop arrives and with him comes opportunity. </p>
<p>(Mickey emerges from the lake. Eddie reaches for his gun. Mickey fires and kills Eddie. He changes clothes with Eddie.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) The monster changes his name, his face ... passes for human. </p>
<p>(Mickey puts on the officer's helmet.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) Rides off into the night.</p>
<p>(He runs to the bike and rides away.) </p>
<p>BACK TO SCENE.</p>
<p><strong>Mickey Dunn</strong>: And the legend is born. The end.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mickey, you know that real horror stories never end.</p>
<p><strong>Mickey Dunn</strong>: Oh, this one does. (laughs) It's been huge fun coming back, trying new faces, leading you all around town by the nostrils. Setting up the big discovery.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [LAKE â€“ DAY] The fisherman is holding the revolver hood ornament while being interviewed by Tally Jeffers.)</p>
<p><strong>Fisherman</strong>: Everybody here knows Mickey Dunn.</p>
<p>(Mick changes masks. He pulls off his fake face.) </p>
<p><strong>Tally Jeffers</strong>: (V.O.) I'm Tally Jeffers, KRAC-TV, Lake Mead, Nevada.</p>
<p>(FLASH TO: Michael pushes Kenneth's wheelchair.) </p>
<p><strong>Mickey Dunn</strong>: (V.O.) Going after Kenneth...</p>
<p>(He puts the photo in Kenneth's shirt pocket.) </p>
<p><strong>Mickey Dunn</strong>: (to Kenneth) I'm Mickey Dunn.</p>
<p>(He pushes Kenneth's wheelchair out onto the street. Kenneth screams as he's hit by the vehicle.)</p>
<p>(Mickey removes his Michael Myers' face.) </p>
<p>(CUT TO: Pamela Voorhees chokes Mason in the hotel room. He shoves the photo in his mouth.) </p>
<p><strong>Mickey Dunn</strong>: (V.O.) ...taking out Mason ...</p>
<p>(He moves his Pamela face.)</p>
<p><strong>Mickey Dunn</strong>: (V.O.) ... and the best part of all, -- </p>
<p>(CUT TO: Mickey removes a cast from Johnny's face.)</p>
<p><strong>Mickey Dunn</strong>: (V.O.) the look on poor Johnny's face. </p>
<p>(CUT TO: Mickey has his Johnny face on. He stands over Derek Paul's body and tucks the gun into his pants.)</p>
<p><strong>Mickey Dunn</strong>: (V.O.) Not the most handsome guy in the world,<br />
BACK TO SCENE.</p>
<p><strong>Mickey Dunn</strong>: but a face worth wearing. And the hardest part? Learning Spanish. (He chuckles.) Good times.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Why now?</p>
<p><strong>Mickey Dunn</strong>: Because that tiny piece of metal that Derek shot in my chest has finally moved. Doctors gave me a week, maybe two, to live. Figured I'd go out with a bang, never see the inside of a cell. It's really funny how one little bullet can make things suddenly seem so clear.</p>
<p>(Catherine smiles at him and stands up.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (innocently) You mean this bullet?</p>
<p>(She shows him a bullet.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mob doctors ... (she puts the bullet on the table) ... become Mob doctors because they sucked in the first place. B<br />
ut we got a licensed surgeon that fixed you up good. Cheer up, Mickey, you're gonna live another twenty ... thirty years. And you'll be spending every day in the federal penitentiary. But only until you die.</p>
<p>(Catherine turns and heads out. She stops.) </p>
<p><strong>Mickey Dunn</strong>: Well, I'll still go out a legend. You haven't changed that.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, you've been out of the game awhile. The homies they have in the pen these days never heard of you.</p>
<p><strong>Mickey Dunn</strong>: That's impossible.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No, Mickey, that's life.</p>
<p>(Catherine winks at him. She turns and leaves.) </p>
<p><strong>Lyric</strong>: &quot;That's life ... That's life ...&quot; </p>
<p>(Camera holds on Mickey Dunn in the hospital bed.) </p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>
<p><strong>End</strong></p>

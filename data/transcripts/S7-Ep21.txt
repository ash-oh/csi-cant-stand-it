<p>(CUT TO: Happy Morales jumps rope.) </p>
<p>[INT. SUGAR CANE RANCH - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CU: The bed sheets bounce and the bedsprings squeak rhythmically. The painting raps rhythmically against the wall. The headboard moves rhythmically.) </p>

<p>VARIOUS CUTS OF: The women look absolutely bored as they endure it.)</p>
<p>(Happy Morales leans against the boxing ring ropes, sighs and puts his head down.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[SWIMMING POOL]</p>
<p>(The swimming pool water ripples. Happy Morales is face down dead in the water. A crowd of old people and working women from the cathouse gather along the edge of the pool.) </p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
[EXT. SUGAR CANE RANCH - BACKYARD - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Sheriff Ned Bastille escorts Grissom and Sara to the swimming pool where the body is.) </p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Ned Bastille</strong>: Yeah. One of the gals fished him out of the pool, and the owner called me. No one's touched the body since.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Where's your coroner?</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Ned Bastille</strong>: Oh, couldn't get him on the horn. Probably out in some barn, up to his elbows in a cow's v*g1n*.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Ned Bastille</strong>: Oh. Yeah. Coroner's a part-time gig here in Brime County. He's a veterinarian. That's his money gig.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (to radio) Control, this is CSI Sidle. We're going to need a coroner for that 419 out at the Sugar Cane Ranch.</p>
<p><strong>Dispatch</strong>: (from radio) Copy that. </p>
<p>(A crowd of women in their lingerie gathers outside near the pool. Ned cheerfully clears his throat.) </p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Ned Bastille</strong>: Excuse me, ladies.</p>
<p>(The ladies move aside so Ned, Grissom and Sara can walk through.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This is a strange crowd for a cathouse.</p>
<p><strong>Milton</strong>: (interrupts) Hey, Sheriff! </p>
<p>(Milton, an elderly man in his robe, is standing in front of the neon sign.) </p>
<p><strong>Milton</strong>: Di-Did you hear about my wife? Somebody shot my wife. Yeah, I'm telling ya, they shot my wife.</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Ned Bastille</strong>: Yeah. Okay. All right. Settle down, Milton. Settle down. Okay.</p>
<p>(They continue on past Milton. The sheriff explains to Grissom and Sara.) </p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Ned Bastille</strong>: His wife died about ten years ago of a stroke.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What is with all the old-timers out here tonight?</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Ned Bastille</strong>: Oh, they live here. Yeah, all over these hills. Cheap rents, abundant sunshine. Life is good here in Brime County.</p>
<p>(They stop in front of the body.) </p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Ned Bastille</strong>: Guy's name is Lorenzo Morales.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: &quot;Happy&quot; Morales. I saw him fight LeRoi Steele at the Sands a couple of years ago. Took a vicious beating. Never touched the mat once.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, he's definitely down for the count.</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Ned Bastille</strong>: Listen. I want to tell you something. George and Doris Babinkian own this place. Run a real tight ship. Never had a problem in all the years they've been here. </p>
<p>(Behind Ned, a working girl in tiny black two-piece lingerie walks up the steps toward him. She's carrying his gun belt. He doesn't see her.) </p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Ned Bastille</strong>: Just good people. Pay their taxes, provide employment, pillars of the community. You know, last month actually, they had a ...</p>
<p>(Aimee taps Ned on his shoulder.) </p>
<p><strong>Aimee</strong>: Ned, you left this in my room again.</p>
<p>(She gives him the belt and leaves.) </p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Ned Bastille</strong>: Oh. Thanks. Thanks, Aimee.</p>
<p>(Ned turns and looks at Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Ned Bastille</strong>: She ...</p>
<p>(Grissom smiles back at him. Ned turns and leaves. Grissom turns and finds Sara smiling at him.) </p>
<p>(They both turn their attention to the body.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Look at this.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Gunshot wound?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p>(Grissom snaps a photo of it.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: He's got a contusion over his right eye. Could be associated with the incident.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, he was a boxer.</p>
<p>(Grissom takes more photos. Sara turns around and finds a broken lawn chair near the edge of the pool. She sticks her hand in the water.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Feels like bathwater. It's got to be 90 degrees. There's no way we're going to get an accurate TOD.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Places like this always keep their pools warm. Encourages the girls to swim topless. It's good for business.</p>
<p>(Sara looks at Grissom.) </p>
<p>(beat) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So they tell me.</p>
<p>FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>

<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[EXT. SUGAR CANE RANCH - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The sign reads: BINKY'S WORLD FAMOUS SUGAR CANE RANCH.) </p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO: </p>
<p>[EXT. SUGAR CANE RANCH - DAY]</p>
<p>(The coroners remove the body on the gurney and put it in the back of the black vehicle.) </p>
<p>[INT. SUGAR CANE RANCH - DAY]</p>
<p>(The ladies are relaxing in the lounge. Brass interviews George &quot;Binky&quot; Babinkian and his wife, Doris.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So when was the last time you saw the deceased?</p>
<p><strong>Binky Babinkian</strong>: It was, like, an hour ago, when they took him away on that cart.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No, I ... you know, I meant the last time you saw him alive.</p>
<p><strong>Doris Babinkian</strong>: I saw him around noon yesterday. Made him his ... favorite meal. Meat.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah. Mr. Babinkian ...</p>
<p><strong>Binky Babinkian</strong>: Oh, you call me Binky. Everybody call me Binky.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Okay, Binky, tell me about ...</p>
<p><strong>Binky Babinkian</strong>: Lorenzo? Everybody call him Happy.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Mm-hmm. What? Does everybody have a nickname around here?</p>
<p><strong>Doris Babinkian</strong>: Not me. I'm just Doris. Nut?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No, thank you, Doris. So tell me about Happy.</p>
<p><strong>Binky Babinkian</strong>: Oh, Happy, Happy. He was a fighter. He was a born boxer. He had speed, he had skills, he had heart, he had ... punch! You know, four years ago, he was a top-ranked middleweight.</p>
<p><strong>Doris Babinkian</strong>: That's right.</p>
<p><strong>Binky Babinkian</strong>: Yeah. But he... I don't know ... stumble into hard times.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, yeah? What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>Binky Babinkian</strong>: You know. Boompa, boompa sniff, sniff. Like, party time. And I... I mean, I buy his contract, I take him out here, I give him a double-wide. I build him a gym to train him, and I train him. I can make him a champion.</p>
<p><strong>Doris Babinkian</strong>: He did that.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You took a boxer who likes to party to a whorehouse to train? Do you think that was smart?</p>
<p><strong>Binky Babinkian</strong>: Well, in hindsight, maybe not so good idea.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, anybody have a grudge against Happy that you know of?</p>
<p><strong>Binky Babinkian</strong>: Everybody loved Happy.</p>
<p><strong>Doris Babinkian</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Binky Babinkian</strong>: You ... I want you to catch this person. Find him, please. And, you know ... anytime your boys need a break, we have something here we call a cop special.</p>
<p>(Doris winks at him.) </p>
<p><strong>Doris Babinkian</strong>: You'll like it.</p>
<p><strong>Binky Babinkian</strong>: Any girl, no charge and one complimentary drink ... </p>
<p>(Doris slaps Binky's hand.) </p>
<p><strong>Doris Babinkian</strong>: Oh, two!</p>
<p><strong>Binky Babinkian</strong>: Okay, two complimentary drinks. And one appetizer of your choice here at the bar. Tonight, we have, uh ... ?</p>
<p><strong>Doris Babinkian</strong>: Baba ghanoush.</p>
<p><strong>Binky Babinkian</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, thank you. Thank you very much. You two really run a mom-and-pop operation.</p>
<p><strong>Doris Babinkian</strong>: Oh, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: And now, if you don't mind, I'd like to talk to the hookers.</p>
<p><strong>Doris Babinkian</strong>: Hooking is what girls do out on the street. Here we prefer the term &quot;pleasure provider.&quot;</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. SUGAR CANE RANCH -BACKYARD -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Nick and Sara are going through the pool side. Sara opens the filter.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Ooh! Beer caps, candy wrappers, cigarette butts, used condoms. </p>
<p>(She snaps pictures of the pool filter.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: This is one pool I am not feeling a pressing need to take a dip in.</p>
<p>(Sara takes the filter out and tips it to show Nick all the stuff inside.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Ugh. Me either. This chair has taken quite a beating, and this cigarette looks like it was just left here and burned out. Hand me an evidence marker, will you?</p>
<p>(Sara hands him evidence marker 2, which Nick puts next to the burned-out cigarette. He takes a photo of it.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: There is a stain on the filter. Could be blood, could be lipstick. If this fellow was shot through the throat, and had a nasty lump on the head, -- </p>
<p>(Quick flash to: A gunshot fires. Happy Morales falls into the pool.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (V.O.) -- could be how he ended up face down in the pool.</p>
<p>(End of flash.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah, but there's no blood by the pool. If he was shot here, you'd expect spatter.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Back-splash could have washed it away when he hit the water.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I kind of doubt it. The bloodstains on his shirt were straight up and down. They had time to settle in. I think he was shot somewhere else, and just got dumped in here.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, it sounds like we need to play ... &quot;Find the Bullet.&quot;</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. SUGAR CANE RANCH - MAIN ROOM -- DAY]</p>
<p>(The ladies are lined up and Greg takes DNA samples from them.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: All right. Open up, please.</p>
<p>(Greg holds up the swab.) </p>
<p><strong>Lulu</strong>: Honey, come see me later. I can show you a better way to get DNA.</p>
<p>(The girls laugh as Greg takes the swab sample.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. SUGAR CANE RANCH - DRESSING ROOM -- DAY]</p>
<p>(Brass interviews the girls one-by-one.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So did you see Lorenzo &quot;Happy&quot; Morales last night?</p>
<p><strong>Tiff</strong>: Uh-uh.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
<strong>Lulu</strong>: No.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
<strong>Dreama Little</strong>: I don't think so.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
<strong>Light Pink Robe Girl</strong>: No.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
<strong>Aimee</strong>: Mm ... Mm-mm.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Did you hear any gunshots? Any shouting? Anything unusual?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
<strong>Dreama Little</strong>: No.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
<strong>Aimee</strong>: No.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(Tiff thinks about it.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So what did you do last night?</p>
<p><strong>Aimee</strong>: A guy came in, and he brought his 18-year-old son, and I made him a man. I popped his man cherry.</p>
<p><strong>Light Pink Robe Girl</strong>: Oh, the usual stuff. I had a pretty good night. I tickled a guy.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: That's it?</p>
<p><strong>Dreama Little</strong>: I had a cold, so I stayed in my room and I read &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot;. (chuckles) I have a big fat crush on Mr. Darcy.</p>
<p><strong>Tiff</strong>: I had two ... no, three dates. Then I hung around the bar and watched TV.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, what did you think of Happy?</p>
<p><strong>Light Pink Robe Girl</strong>: He was fine.</p>
<p><strong>Lulu</strong>: Actually, he was kind of ...</p>
<p><strong>Aimee</strong>: Cute. And he was ...</p>
<p><strong>Dreama Little</strong>: I mean, I didn't have nothing against him.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Let me make something clear for you. This is a homicide investigation. If you're lying to me, even a little bit, I'm going to come down on you like a load of bricks. </p>
<p>(Aimee in the black lingerie bites her nails.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So let me ask you again. What did you think of Happy?</p>
<p>(The light pink robe girl rattles off angrily in Spanish.) </p>
<p><strong>Light Pink Robe Girl</strong>: (subtitled) I couldn't stand him. If it was up to me, ... he could die in hell! He was a thief! </p>
<p><strong>Tiff</strong>: He was messed up, man. He took pills to get wood, then he couldn't even finish.</p>
<p><strong>Lulu</strong>: Plus, he had the windy problem.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What does that mean? He talked too much?</p>
<p><strong>Tiff</strong>: No. He passed gas too much.</p>
<p><strong>Aimee</strong>: He smelled really bad.</p>
<p><strong>Lulu</strong>: I mean, I know you're not supposed to be sensitive in this line of work ...</p>
<p><strong>Tiff</strong>: -- but that guy could blister paint.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>Dreama Little</strong>: What pissed me off, he started coming around, and he just stopped paying for it.</p>
<p><strong>Aimee</strong>: He thought he could get anything and everything for free.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, did Doris and Binky have a problem with this?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [POOLSIDE] Binky approaches Happy, who is lounging in a chair next to the pool with a cigarette and a bottle of beer.) </p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong>: (V.O.) Binky had a big problem with it.</p>
<p><strong>Binky</strong>: You keep your hands off my girls. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>Happy Morales</strong>: Hey, this is a whorehouse. That's what they're here for.</p>
<p><strong>Binky</strong>: You lazy, fat bum. Why you don't make yourself useful around here, eh? Look at this piece of falling apart crap of a chair. </p>
<p>(Binky grabs the chair and tilts it, causing Happy to stagger out</p>
<p><strong>Binky</strong>: You pick up a tool and fix it! All right?</p>
<p>(Binky leaves. Happy drinks and burps.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Dreama Little</strong>: Doris, uh ... she had a little thing for Mr. Happy, if you know what I mean.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Did he reciprocate?</p>
<p><strong>Tiff</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Was it a one-way thing or a two-way thing?</p>
<p><strong>Aimee</strong>: I don't know what you're saying.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Did Binky know?</p>
<p><strong>Dreama Little</strong>: (shrugs) I don't know.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. SUGAR CANE RANCH - MAIN OFFICE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Grissom takes Doris's cigarette out of her mouth.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: May I?</p>
<p>(He swabs her mouth, then puts her cigarette back in her mouth.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Doris</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>(Grissom notes the security video feeds.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: These monitors are live-feed only? Nothing taped?</p>
<p><strong>Doris</strong>: Absolutely not. If we did that, and word got out, we'd be out of business in about a week.</p>
<p>(Grissom picks up the headphones.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: But I see that the rooms are wired for sound as well.</p>
<p><strong>Doris</strong>: Yeah. Well, that's for the girls' protection.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And to make sure that they don't short you on their financial transactions?</p>
<p><strong>Doris</strong>: I just spot-check from time to time. I trust my girls.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did you hear anything unusual last night?</p>
<p><strong>Doris</strong>: Believe me, if I had heard anything, you'd have known about it already. I want to know what happened to that poor boy just as much ... just as much as anybody.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You cared about him.</p>
<p><strong>Doris</strong>: Happy was a child in a man's body, you know? He had no family. He had nobody. He was scared. His big comeback was going nowhere. He was finished, and he knew it. Happy knew it. Binky knew it. Everybody knew it.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. SUGAR CANE RANCH -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Grissom and Sara walk out of the main house on their way to Happy Morales's lodging.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Twenty-five people here last night, and nobody sees anything.</p>
<p>(A couple of working girls walk by.) </p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: (to Grissom) Nice hat, honey.</p>
<p>(Grissom watches them go. He and Sara continue.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So you've been to a place like this before?</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You never paid for s*x?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I have not. I find the whole idea very ... bleak.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Really? How come? GRISSOM: s*x should provide the opportunity for human connection, but paid s*x does the opposite of that. To me, s*x without love is pointless. It makes you sad.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Whoa.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Genitals are distended and patchy and covered with large red welts. Testicles are swollen, roughly three times the average size. Scrotum is filled with fluid. It's consistent with cardio edema or an STD. Maybe an infection of some kind.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Either that or this guy's got the world's ugliest Johnson.</p>
<p>(Warrick shakes his head and holds back a laugh.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Okay, I'll just slice the scrotal sack and draw out a fluid sample.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: This guy's got a nasty crack on his head.</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Do I look like Paula Abdul to you?</p>
<p><strong>Dreama Little</strong>: My daddy gave me that name 'cause he liked that song. BRASS: (sighs) Happy was hit in the head with a crowbar we found in your room. You wiped off your fingerprints, but you didn't wipe off his blood from the grooves.</p>
<p><strong>Dreama Little</strong>: He was always ... coming up to my room, getting all up on me. He liked them other girls, but he was obsessed with me. Look, look what he did. </p>
<p>(She lifts up her blouse to show Brass the bruise on her side.) </p>
<p><strong>Dreama Little</strong>: He punched me right there in the ribs just for fun. Stupid. </p>
<p>(She shows him the bruise on her back.) </p>
<p><strong>Dreama Little</strong>: Then he flipped me over and then he started punching me back here. Every night, drunk, crazy, messed up--whether he could get it up or not.</p>

<p><strong>Dreama Little</strong>: So what? He deserved it. It didn't even drop him. He just wandered off.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'm going to let you in on a little secret. You don't get to decide whether you kill somebody or not.</p>
<p><strong>Dreama Little</strong>: I just explained to you ...</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You whacked him on the side of the head with a crowbar.</p>
<p><strong>Dreama Little</strong>: I know, but I didn't ...</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: That's assault with a deadly weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Dreama Little</strong>: He came over ...</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: It doesn't matter whether he wandered off or not. He's bleeding from the brain. If he dies later on, that's murder on you.</p>
<p><strong>Dreama Little</strong>: (shocked) I killed him?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know, a jury may take into account the fact that you were abused, and I hope they do. But you're not gonna just walk out of here.</p>
<p><strong>Dreama Little</strong>: (crying) I killed him!</p>
<p>(He gives her a pen.) </p>

<p>[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Robbins shares his findings with Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: The blow to the forehead caused bruising to the right frontal lobe. It's significant, but definitely sub-lethal by itself.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And what are those gray spots?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Just old scar tissue. See it on boxers all the time. It's impossible to know what kind of brain damage the guy was already living with.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So what killed him?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: In addition to the brain trauma and the holes in his throat, he has needle marks on his thighs, arms and buttocks. I don't know for certain what he was shooting up. Still waiting for tox.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, he was found floating face down in a pool, so let's start with the obvious. Any evidence of drowning?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: His lungs were partially filled with blood and water. However, the neck wound transected the trachea below the epiglottis.</p>
<p>(He sticks a pink tube through the holes in the neck.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: So the air and the water could have entered passively postmortem.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, the entry and the exit are the same size, but ... it doesn't look like a bullet wound to me.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: No, it seems more like a straight-through puncture. The bruising here is more developed than here. At this point, all I can say for sure is the neck wound occurred before the blow to the head.</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Apparently.</p>
<p><strong>Binky</strong>: Will you excuse us? (Binky grabs Doris and pulls her up.) I would like to ... comfort and talk to my wife.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, no, wait a minute, wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No. I think it'll be all right. Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Binky</strong>: Thank you, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Take your time.</p>
<p>(Binky and Doris exit the main room and head for one of the back rooms.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What was that about?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (motions) Come on.</p>
<p>(Grissom walks over to the security desk with Brass. He watches Binky and Doris enter a back room and waits for the door to close.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: These rooms are all wired for sound.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We can't use this as evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: They have no expectation of privacy in those rooms. Binky and Doris are the ones who wired them, and they listen to their clients all the time.</p>
<p>(Grissom hands Brass the earphones. He puts on his own. He flips the switch for ROOM 3.) </p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[INT. ROOM 3 -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Doris and Binky talk.) </p>
<p><strong>Doris</strong>: That's why you did it. That's why you fed me the shrimp. </p>
<p><strong>Binky</strong>: I feed you shrimps because I love you. And you love shrimp, no?</p>
<p><strong>Doris</strong>: Don't play dumb with me, George. Somehow you figured out that Happy was allergic.</p>
<p><strong>Binky</strong>: Oh, you crazy talk, crazy.</p>
<p><strong>Doris</strong>: No, it's all clear to me now. How long have you known?</p>
<p><strong>Binky</strong>: Known about what?</p>
<p><strong>Doris</strong>: About me and Happy.</p>
<p><strong>Binky</strong>: (oh) You were doing boxer?</p>
<p><strong>Doris</strong>: Screw you, George. You know damn well I was.</p>
<p><strong>Binky</strong>: I don't care if you have your flingy-flingys. We're living in America, no? I mean everybody's entitled to pursuit of happy. What's done is done, Doris. He was turning into big drag. He's dead now. May God take his soul and rest.</p>
<p><strong>Doris</strong>: You're setting me up, George.</p>
<p><strong>Binky</strong>: I ...</p>
<p>(Binky turns and notices the mic. He shushes Doris, but she's too angry to notice.) </p>
<p><strong>Doris</strong>: Now don't you shush me, George. You know what? You've pulled some really out-to-lunch crap in your life, George, but this ... is ...</p>
<p>(He grabs her face and turns her head and points to the mic. She stops.) </p>
<p>(Grissom turns and looks at Brass.) </p>
<p><strong>George</strong>: What you just said ...</p>
<p><strong>Doris</strong>: I didn't mean it. That was just crazy talk.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah. </p>
<p><strong>Doris</strong>: Yeah. I mean, nobody would ever possibly believe, not for a single solitary moment, I mean not for a single solitary moment, that you, that I, that Happy ...</p>
<p><strong>Binky</strong>: Oh, come here, baby, baby, come.</p>
<p>(Binky awkwardly holds Doris.) </p>
<p><strong>Doris</strong>: Oh. I love you.</p>
<p>(Grissom and Brass take the earphones off.) </p>
<p><strong>Binky</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p><strong>Doris</strong>: (sobbing) I love you.</p>
<p><strong>Binky</strong>: I love you.</p>
<p>(The door opens and Brass walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Doris</strong>: (sobbing) I love you, too. </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: And I love you both. Let's go. You're under arrest.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - HALLWAY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Grissom walks and talks with Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Binky used Doris to induce Happy's allergic reaction to shrimp as a sort of test of her fidelity ...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And Happy ends up dead. Not bad. Who's Brass going to charge?</p>
<p>(Robbins appears behind them. They turn around.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Don't bother. You can't charge either one.</p>
<p>(Grissom looks at the report in Robbins' hands and he closes his eyes.) </p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY - NIGHT -- FLASHBACK] </p>
<p>(Robbins is examining Happy's legs.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (V.O.) On secondary examination of the body, I noticed a patch of necrotic skin on the right calf. Looked like a bite of some kind. </p>
<p>(Robbins puts a ruler down near the wound marks.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (V.O.) So I sent blood off for prothrombin time and blood venom ratio.</p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p>[INT. CSI - GRISSOM'S OFFICE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Robbins is talking with Catherine and Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: It came back positive for snake venom.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Smashed with a crowbar, shot by a crossbow, poisoned by shrimp and now bitten by a snake?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Sort of-- Happy had Western Diamondback Rattlesnake venom in his system -- the real deal -- but it wasn't from a bite.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback of: Robbins cuts the piece of flesh off Happy's calf.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (V.O.) I histo-ed the wound and checked the cross-section.</p>
<p>(Cut to: Robbins is looking at the sample under the scope.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (V.O.) Snake bite punctures are typically curved ...</p>
<p>BACK TO SCENE.</p>
<p>(Photo scope view of a cross-section of the puncture wounds.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, these are straight. And one's deeper than the other. Look like needle marks.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: As you can see, the tissue around he wound was pretty badly degraded.</p>
<p>(Grissom finds a photo of the syringe.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Greg found this in the trash of one of the girls' rooms.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Which girl?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM 1 - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Brass is interviewing Dreama Little.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So I think you'll be happy to know that your little crowbar stunt didn't kill Happy.</p>
<p><strong>Dreama Little</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>Dreama Little</strong>: Oh, that's great. That's like I told you. So can I go now?</p>
<p>(She stands up.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, don't you even want to know how he died?</p>
<p>(She sits down.) </p>
<p><strong>Dreama Little</strong>: Well ... yeah, okay.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know, it was the damnedest thing. He had snake venom in his system.</p>
<p><strong>Dreama Little</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Dreama Little</strong>: A snake bite. Isn't that a hoot?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, that's just what it is -- a hoot.</p>
<p><strong>Dreama Little</strong>: You know, there's a bunch of those rattlers all up over those hills. I bet he just ...</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, he wasn't bitten. No, he was injected. Yeah. Somebody took a syringe full of snake venom and injected it in his leg.</p>
<p><strong>Dreama Little</strong>: I don't know nothing about that.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, we found the syringe with the venom in it and your DNA on it in the tube you hid it in. I mean, you might have walked on the crowbar thing, but this is premeditated. And that can be very, very bad for you. Look, I know that you and Connor did this together. He's already going down for the crossbow shot. That's probably why he gave you up.</p>
<p><strong>Dreama Little</strong>: He-he blamed ... he blamed it on me?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: He said that you cooked up the whole thing from top to bottom.</p>
<p>(She thinks about it and smiles.) </p>
<p><strong>Dreama Little</strong>: Mm ... Connor would never say that. He was in love with me.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Are you saying that faking the snake bite was his idea?</p>
<p><strong>Dreama Little</strong>: No. Connor ain't that smart. It was my idea.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: [EXT. HOUSE] Dreama handles two snakes out of a crate and one is wrapped around her neck.) </p>
<p><strong>Dreama Little</strong>: (V.O.) My daddy was a serpent-handling preacher. My people all had the holy fire. I had it, too, but mine came from below.</p>
<p>(She takes the venom from the snake.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Dreama Little</strong>: I caught and milked that rattler.</p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM 2]</p>
<p><strong>Connor Foster</strong>: Dreama said she did it? By herself?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: That's right. You're going to walk out of here a free man. And she's going to jail, and you can visit her every third Thursday until she's a very old lady. Is that the way you want it to be?</p>
<p><strong>Connor Foster</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, that's the way it's going to be. Unless you can convince me she's lying just to save your sorry ass.</p>
<p><strong>Connor Foster</strong>: That ain't the way it went down. Dreama thought it up, but I'm the one who stuck it in.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Happy is passed out on Dreama's bed. Connor prepares the syringe.)</p>
<p><strong>Dreama Little</strong>: Come on. DREAMA LITTLE: Put it in.</p>
<p>(Connor injects Happy. He stirs and mumbles.) </p>
<p><strong>Dreama Little</strong>: (to Happy) That's okay. Shh. Go back sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Happy</strong>: (mumbles) Later, I'll get you later. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>Dreama Little</strong>: It's okay. (to Connor) Two holes.</p>
<p><strong>Connor Foster</strong>: Two holes. What? </p>
<p><strong>Dreama Little</strong>: Two holes.</p>
<p><strong>Connor Foster</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p>(He injects Happy again.) </p>
<p>(Cut to: Connor carries Happy's body.) </p>
<p><strong>Connor</strong>: And then I went and I dumped his body into the culvert. Me, by myself.</p>
<p>(Connor runs away.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p>[INT. CSI - LAYOUT ROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Grissom, Catherine and Nick look over the photos.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Right now the DA's not sure who he's going to charge. What he needs from us is the most accurate timeline we can provide.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, according to Tox, the hemolytic component of the venom had time to break down tissue, which means that it had to have been in his system at least a few hours.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So the fake snake bite is around 1:00.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback of: Happy is down in the culvert. His eyes open and he wakes up.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) Happy's down ... but not out.</p>
<p>(Happy gets up and climbs out of the culvert.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, that gets Dreama and Connor for attempted murder with conspiracy to commit.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And earlier that night, Binky fed Doris some jumbo tiger shrimp, -- </p>
<p>(Quick flash of: [INT. SUGAR CANE RANCH] Happy is in the hallway.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) -- knowing that she'd eventually find Happy for round two.</p>
<p><strong>Happy</strong>: (shouts) Dreama!</p>
<p>(Doris steps out into the hallway.) </p>
<p><strong>Happy</strong>: Oye, mamita. I don't feel too good.</p>
<p><strong>Doris</strong>: Come here, baby. I know what you need. I'm going to make you feel all better. Come to Doris, baby.</p>
<p>(Doris leads Happy into one of the rooms.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Doris administers some very special first aid ... and Happy's little soldier swells to battalion size.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Babinkian knew about that shellfish allergy -- that's intent, right?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: In any event, Binky and Doris lawyered up. They're sticking together.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: How romantic. So, now Happy is not so happy, because he'd heading into anaphylactic shock.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Happy staggers out into the night. His neck is swollen as he heads for his trailer.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: According to Narco, Happy had epinephrine in his trailer, which is probably what he was trying to get to in round two.</p>
<p>(Connor fires the arrow and hits Happy in the throat. He aims for a second shot. Happy turns around and sees him.) </p>
<p>(Connor tries to put in the second arrow and instead, turns and runs away.) </p>
<p>(Happy runs to his trailer.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (V.O.) That's assault with a deadly weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) But not necessarily murder.</p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So the field tracheotomy buys un-Happy enough time to get the epi.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Happy reaches his trailer and enters. He looks for the medicine and sticks himself in the leg. He sighs with relief and collapses on the floor.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: At this point, you'd think he would've just called it a night. Watched a little TV, hit the sack, but no.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Happy gets up again.) </p>
<p><strong>Happy</strong>: Dreama. I'm going to get you, you little bitch.</p>
<p>(Cut to: Happy opens Dreama's room door and she hits him in the head with the crowbar.) </p>
<p>(He turns and runs away.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Which brings us to round four. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Happy staggers over to the pool. He sits down in the lawn chair, picks up a cigarette from the ground and lights it. He inhales. The smoke escapes out the holes in his neck.) </p>
<p>(Happy takes a moment and just sits there.) </p>
<p>(Then the lawn chair's broken leg gives way under him. Happy falls into the swimming pool with a SPLASH!) </p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The TKO.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You do know what a good defense attorney is going to say to all this, don't you?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: The lawn chair did it.</p>
<p>(Catherine turns and shares a smile with Grissom.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />

<p>(He types: SNAKE VENOM PUNCTURES.) </p>

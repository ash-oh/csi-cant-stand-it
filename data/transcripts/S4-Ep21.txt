<p>(The chains pull the roller coaster up the large ramp. The MOTHER and DAUGHTER sit in their seat just behind JOEY.) </p>
<p><strong>Daughter</strong>: (groans) I don't wanna go! Ooh! Oh, mommy.</p>
<p>(JOEY unbuckles his seat belt and turns around to look back at them.)</p>
<p><strong>Joey</strong>: We're all going to die.</p>
<p><strong>Daughter</strong>: Cut it out!</p>
<p><strong>Mother</strong>: Joey, put your seat belt on. Now!</p>
<p>(The cars reach the top and they can feel it as it starts its journey down the rails.)</p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong>: Here we go! VOICE: Oh, my goodness! VOICE: Whoa!</p>
<p>(A close up of the coaster wheels shows it wobbling.)</p>
<p>(Various cuts of the roller coaster ride with some emphasis on the wheels.)</p>
<p>(The roller coaster comes to a stop at the platform.)</p>
<p><strong>Mother</strong>: Okay, guys, come on.</p>
<p>(The family gets off of the ride.)</p>
<p><strong>Daughter</strong>: That was so fun.</p>
<p>(The next set of passengers board the coaster ride.)</p>
<p><strong>Zack Lawrence</strong>: All right, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Pharaoh's Fever. Buckle up. Get ready to scream.</p>
<p>(The passengers are locked in and the ride starts.)</p>
<p>(The young family steps out onto the walkway and heads over to the nearby food vendor. The kids are still excited about the ride.)</p>
<p><strong>Joey</strong>: That was so awesome.</p>
<p><strong>Daughter</strong>: When can we ride again?</p>
<p><strong>Mother</strong>: Um, we'll ride it in a minute.</p>
<p>(The MOTHER turns to place in the order.)</p>
<p><strong>Mother</strong>: Um, Four King Tut burgers, uh, two Nile River ice teas and two milks.</p>
<p><strong>Daughter</strong>: Milk is nasty.</p>
<p><strong>Mother</strong>: (absently) Yeah.</p>
<p>(At the sounds of the excessive screams, the family looks up in time to see the roller coaster cars fly off of the tracks </p>
<p>(The roller coaster cars crash head first into the red car parked in the parking lot.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. SPHINX AMUSEMENT PARK -- PARKING LOT -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(BRASS stands in front of the wrecked car. The bodies of the riders are still on the pavement. GRISSOM ducks under the crime scene tape and walks over to BRASS.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, Dr. Thrillseeker, you ever been on this roller coaster?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks up at the ride.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Pharaoh's Fever, yeah ... but my ride ended at the platform. What do you know?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Six dead. Park full of eyewitnesses saw the train fly off the tracks. Four-oh-one-B.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Accident with injury.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's also a Four-Eighteen-B.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: A runaway?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (nods) A runaway train.</p>
<p>FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. SPHINX AMUSEMENT PARK - PARKING LOT -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(The amusement park parking lot is filled with personnel, curious on-lookers and the media. An OFFICER holds up the tape for NICK, SARA and GREG. GREG is carrying SARA'S kit for her in addition to his own. They make their way over to GRISSOM.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey. Sorry we're late. There was a news van blocking the entrance.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This is the first time a roller coaster has derailed in Clark County. Huge criminal and civil liabilities issues, so keep it quiet. Photograph the scene. Bag and tag all the detritus. Forklift anything bigger than Greg. We're going to put up a tent on the other side of the parking lot for accident reconstruction. Questions?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yeah. What's that guy doing so far away from the others?</p>
<p>(They look over at the lone body on the ground away from the wreckage.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Curious, isn't it?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns and leaves. GREG looks at SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: So, when he asks if anybody has any questions, he's not really asking?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, I don't know much about roller coaster accidents, but in auto collisions, the victims found furthest away from the car usually weren't wearing a seat belt. That'd be my bet.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [DAY] The roller coaster car flies off the track. The lone body flies out of the car. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay, let's go to work.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: What should I do?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Uh, photo-evidence log -- just record everything we collect, okay?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. MOUNTAIN BRIDGE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(The OFFICER shows WARRICK and CATHERINE to the body. DAVID PHILLIPS is already there logging his findings.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Couple of mountain bikers called in the body. Coroner just arrived.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hi, David.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Hey. Tessa Press. School I.D. was in her pocket. She's 13.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and WARRICK kneels down next to the body to get a better look.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I hate these cases.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Now ... the body position is inconsistent with her lividity.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: After she died, blood settled to her anterior and lividity fixed. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So she had been facedown.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: And someone dumped her face up.</p>
<p>(DAVID PHILLIPS nods.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: How long has she been here?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: I'll defer that question to the insects.</p>
<p>(DAVID rolls the body and shows them to CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Instar maggots.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Given the ambient temperature and last night's rain, I'd estimate she's been out here twenty-four hours.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Takes that long for blowfly eggs to hatch.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I guess the rain would've washed away any trace evidence: Tire prints, shoe impressions.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Let's just hope there's some evidence on her body.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: If you're going to drive all the way out here to dump a body, why not take another ten minutes and bury her?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Guess it wasn't worth the killer's time.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[VARIOUS FLASHES OF BLACK &amp; WHITE PHOTOS OF THE BODIES AT THE PARKING LOT]</p>
<p>[EXT. SPHINX AMUSEMENT PARK - PARKING LOT -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(SARA continues to snap photos of the evidence and evidence markers on the asphalt. NICK bags the evidence while GREG logs them down. They work methodotically.) </p>
<p>(In the background, we see the CORONERS remove the bodies.)</p>
<p>(A large crane arrives to move the larger pieces -- smashed red car and roller coaster car.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. SPHINX AMUSEMENT PARK - NEAR THE PHARAOH'S FEVER -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(BRASS questions ZACK LAWRENCE.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, how long you been operating the roller coaster?</p>
<p><strong>Zack Lawrence</strong>: Couple of months. I got a promotion. I used to work the merry-go-round.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: That's a promotion, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Zack Lawrence</strong>: Yeah. Only little kids go on the merry-go-round.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, I see. So you get to meet girls your own age on Pharaoh's Fever.</p>
<p><strong>Zack Lawrence</strong>: Yeah, something like that.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What kind of training do you get to be an operator?</p>
<p><strong>Zack Lawrence</strong>: (scoffs) Training? I release the brake. I press a button. It's green and marked &quot;start&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I get the picture. All right, look, there are six victims. It'd be helpful to know where each of them was sitting.</p>
<p><strong>Zack Lawrence</strong>: Um ... front bench was a girl. She was blond.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Zack Lawrence</strong>: Cute.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: ZACK presses the green button. The ride starts.)</p>
<p><strong>Zack Lawrence</strong>: (V.O.) Uh, followed by a punk, old folks and some other dude.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: That's only five.</p>
<p><strong>Zack Lawrence</strong>: That's all I remember.</p>
<p>(BRASS looks over at the photo vendor stand. There's a big sign on it: SEE YOURSELF SCREAM!)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: &quot;See yourself scream&quot;? What's this about?</p>
<p><strong>Zack Lawrence</strong>: We got a digital camera. It's mounted right over there.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: How does that work?</p>
<p><strong>Zack Lawrence</strong>: Camera's on a trigger. Train passes by, automatically snaps a picture and stores it in the computer's hard drive. The train was airborne. Never even got close to the camera.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'm still going to want to take that computer.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. SPHINX AMUSEMENT PARK - NEAR THE FERRIS WHEEL-- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(GRISSOM interviews WOODY.) </p>
<p><strong>Woody</strong>: I'm the park's chief engineer. Been working on coasters since before I was tall enough to ride 'em.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You responsible for maintaining this roller coaster?</p>
<p><strong>Woody</strong>: I keep all the rides up to code.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You have any idea what would cause this train to go off the track?</p>
<p><strong>Woody</strong>: Well, in theory, I didn't think it was possible. There's never been an accident like this anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So, you're an expert?</p>
<p><strong>Woody</strong>: On roller coasters? Hell yeah. Ten years of service on Six Flags'<br />
American Eagle before moving to Vegas.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks down and sees the nut. He uses his pen and picks it up.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Do you know what that is?</p>
<p><strong>Woody</strong>: That's a nut. It, uh ... secures the wheel to the screw.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, one loose screw ... couldn't cause a train to derail, could it?</p>
<p><strong>Woody</strong>: No, no, there's, uh ... eight wheels per train. They-they'd all have to be loose, and, uh ... that just doesn't happen.</p>
<p>(Camera holds on a close up of the nut.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. SPHINX AMUSEMENT PARK - PARKING LOT -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>[EXT. SPHINX AMUSEMENT PARK - TENT -- PARKING LOT -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(They've set up a large tent in the parking lot. Inside, GRISSOM walks in. A long table has been set up with the various pieces of evidence gathered on it. NICK, SARA and GREG are going through everything.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: &quot;There are three things in human life that are important. The first is to be kind; the second one is to be kind; and the third one is to be kind.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Henry James.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Very good. Author of one of the greatest horror stories ever written: Turn of the Screw. And I'm looking for one.</p>
<p>(He holds up the baggie with the nut.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: A screw?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Oh, well ... technically, these are eccentric shafts, not screws.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, as long as you can screw a nut on it, it's a screw.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: &quot;Turn of the Screw&quot; isn't really a horror story. It's more of a mystery. Did the governess kill the little boy, or did the ghost do it?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, it's only a mystery if you believe in ghosts.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM picks up a screw and looks at the threads.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: End threads are stripped.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Means the nuts were loose. Excessive play on the screws would've worn down the threads.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And the nuts would've popped off.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [ROLLER COASTER WHEELS] The nut is loose and pops off. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Nuts don't just pop off by themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We got tool marks.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Vertical striations, evenly spaced. </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Could've been a pipe wrench.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Maybe whoever maintains the roll coaster uses a pipe wrench to tighten the nuts.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Or whoever loosened the nuts screwed up.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - WAITING ROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(WARRICK hands the morgue photo to RAINA to look at.) </p>
<p><strong>Raina Press</strong>: It's Tessa. I don't understand. How could this ... ? My baby.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm very sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Raina Press</strong>: She's beautiful, isn't she?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Ma'am, the coroner believes that Tessa died over twenty-four hours ago. Had you reported her missing?</p>
<p><strong>Raina Press</strong>: Couple nights a week, she'd sleep at her friend Carrie's. There's just the two of us. I'm a waitress. Work nights. That way I can ... make her breakfast and be there when she gets home from school.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: When was the last time that you saw her?</p>
<p><strong>Raina Press</strong>: Yesterday morning. I got home around 6:00. We made pancakes. I packed her lunch and kissed her good-bye. When she didn't come home from school, I just figured she was at Carrie's. I should have called, but I didn't want to be a nag. I want to see her.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Officer, could you please escort Ms. Press ... to the morgue.</p>
<p>(RAINA PRESS stands up and leaves. CATHERINE also stands up. WARRICK and CATHERINE watch her go.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: When's the last time you went twenty-four hours without talking to Lindsey?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: A single mother, working nights.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'm just saying, she didn't check on her own kid, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Ah, you do the best you can.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY] </p>
<p>(ROBBINS goes over the bodies with GRISSOM.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Introductions. Shelly Hoffman, 25. Cause of death -- lacerated ventricle. Noah Nuland, 15. C.O.D.-- Head contusion. The swelling of the brain killed him within minutes. Now, Gary Clodfelter died of shock. His wife, May, exsanguinated. And their son, Cameron - another head contusion.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What about this guy?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Jim Nevins, 20. Park employee. Died from a temporal herniation. Impact to the head caused the brain to swell, which, in turn, put pressure on the brain stem.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: According the ride operator, there were only five passengers on the roller coaster, and no employees.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So ... maybe Nevins was just an unfortunate bystander. Hit in the head by a falling roller coaster.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: The chicken little theory? But here's the hitch. The others died roughly ten hours ago. Mr. Nevins' rigor mortis is fixed. Body temp puts the time of his death approximately sixteen hours before the others -- right around<br />
1:00 a.m.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (sighs) Albert... dead men don't ride roller coasters.</p>

<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. VARIOUS AMUSEMENT PARK (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - WALKWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(GRISSOM and SARA walk with WOODY.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We're going to need to see the underside of the loading platform.</p>
<p><strong>Woody</strong>: Oh, follow me. Rumor has it the park's going to shut down Pharaoh's Fever for good. You know anything about that?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Woody</strong>: Newspaper called it &quot;A Death Trap.&quot; An &quot;Accident waiting to happen&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You disagree with that?</p>
<p>(They reach the platform. WOODY opens the gate.)</p>
<p><strong>Woody</strong>: Well, she's old and wrinkled, but I took good care of her.</p>
<p>(SARA and GRISSOM crawl under the platform. WOODY starts to follow them, but GRISSOM stops him.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Uh, Woody? We'd like to be alone.</p>
<p><strong>Woody</strong>: Holler if you need anything.</p>
<p>(He shuts the gate behind them, turns and leaves.)</p>
<p>[UNDER THE PLATFORM - DAY -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and SARA both look at the coaster railings from under the platform. They envision the train cars rolling in, pausing, and rolling out. The cars vanish.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, easy access. Wheels are in reach.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Anyone could have loosened the nuts from down here.</p>
<p>(SARA sees something.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Check this out. Is that lubricant, maybe?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's a funny place for lubricant. It's not even on the track.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'll swab it.</p>
<p>(SARA takes a sample. GRISSOM looks up when he hears the sound of metal upon metal in the wind.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hey, look at that. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: That's worse than just a wrinkle.</p>
<p><strong>Woody</strong>: (o.s.) It's got a support beam under it. </p>
<p>(At the sound of his voice, they both turn and see WOODY peering at them through the grate.)</p>
<p><strong>Woody</strong>: It's just a cosmetic problem.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Sir, you need to step away. </p>
<p>(SARA opens the gate door and steps out from under the platform. GRISSOM follows her.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We need some time. This is an active investigation.</p>
<p>[WALKWAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Were you aware that that support beam was detached?</p>
<p><strong>Woody</strong>: Well, hell, yeah. Fixed it a half dozen times this year. It's in my maintenance log. But like I said, that cross bar is supported by the metal beam. (He points and GRISSOM looks up.) But since my hours were cut back last November, I've had to prioritize my &quot;fix-ums.&quot; Yeah, it's really too back, but, uh, you know--</p>

<p><strong>Greg</strong>: The roller coaster broke into one hundred and six parts. I just logged the final piece.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Good work.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I found something a little unusual, for a roller coaster.</p>
<p>(GREG motions for them to follow him. He shows them the roller coaster car.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Not a sailor, but a ...</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (surprised) Semen? s*x on the roller coaster?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Or some kid shaking hands with shorty.</p>
<p>(He grabs the ALS and shows it to them.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The release of epinephrine and adrenaline while riding a roller coaster can produce a stimulatory effect. It enhances ejaculation.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Right. But is it probative to our investigation?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, um, why don't you swab a sample, and you can tell us.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Greg, do we know who the R.O. of this t-bird is?</p>
<p>(GREG grabs the registration papers and reads off the name.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Uh ... Jim Nevins.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The dead employee.</p>

<p>(She turns it around and sees something else.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Blood.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Blood pool.</p>
<p>(End of vision. GRISSOM turns to look at SARA and GREG.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Camouflaged by the red carpet. That explains the autopsy findings. Nevins may have never been in the roller coaster. Possibly killed by that wrench and stuffed in his own trunk.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: And, uh, then what? (She shakes her head as she continues his line of thinking.) A renegade roller coaster comes along sixteen hours later, and propels Nevin's body from the trunk to the blacktop?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm just following the evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'll call Brass, see if he can find an eyewitness that can place the car in the parking lot at the time of Nevin's death.</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Did you notice any cars in the parking lot after closing on Thursday night?</p>
<p><strong>Zack Lawrence</strong>: Jimmy Nevins. His red t-bird was out there.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, you know Jimmy?</p>
<p><strong>Zack Lawrence</strong>: Yeah, sure; pretty cool guy. Worked the bumper cars. I still can't believe what happened, you know? I mean, I must have rode that coaster, like, phew, a hundred times, maybe more. Anyway, sometimes Jimmy stayed after closing.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Why? </p>
<p><strong>Zack Lawrence</strong>: Look, I'm not trying to get anybody in trouble, but occasionally, Jimmy would take his ... dates for rides on The Fever, you know? Everybody knew about it. It was really no big deal.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Do you happen to know the name of his date on Thursday night?</p>
<p><strong>Zack Lawrence</strong>: No, sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: How did Jimmy get access to the park? I mean, all the power is shut down at night.</p>
<p><strong>Zack Lawrence</strong>: The same key that opens up the men's room door opens up all the power boxes at the park.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (shakes his head) No kidding.</p>
<p><strong>Zack Lawrence</strong>: It's just hanging outside Woody's office.</p>

<p><strong>Raina Press</strong>: Were you nice back?</p>
<p><strong>Tessa Press</strong>: Don't do this again, please!</p>
<p><strong>Raina Press</strong>: You don't talk to me like that, you little bitch.</p>
<p><strong>Tessa Press</strong>: Mom, you're being ridiculous.</p>
<p>(TESSA turns and heads for the house.)</p>
<p><strong>Raina Press</strong>: Where the hell do you think you're going? (RAINA picks up the shovel.) I've given you everything. </p>
<p>(She swings and hits TESSA on the back of her head. She falls.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Raina Press</strong>: Justin was the best thing in my life.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No. Your daughter was the best thing in your life.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE stands up.)</p>
<p><strong>Raina Press</strong>: You didn't know her.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (scoffs) I know she was thirteen years old. A child.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE leaves.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(GRISSOM and SARA walk through the hallway. SARA fills GRISSOM in.) </p>
<p><strong>Sidle</strong>: I just got the court order from the pharmaceutical database. Fortunately, dioxipin isn't widely prescribed. FDA only approved it two years ago, and most dermatologists don't even know what it is.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How many names on the list?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, in Clark County, twelve prescriptions were filled. I cross-referenced them with the employees from the park, and I got a hit. You want a clue? Her death ended the Ptolemy dynasty's reign in ancient Egypt, hence making her the last pharaoh.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Ah, the lovely Cleopatra.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(GRISSOM and SARA interview LISA HUNT. Her lawyer sits next to her.) </p>
<p><strong>Lisa Hunt</strong>: I had a rash. So what? That's not a crime.</p>
<p><strong>Lawyer (man)</strong>: I read the court order. Uh, you found trace amounts of some ointment on the roller coaster tracks? Is that the only reason for this conversation?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Your client had a prescription for doxepin. May we see your arms, please?</p>
<p><strong>Lisa Hunt</strong>: Rash was on my legs. Went away days ago. You want to see?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Uh, that's okay.</p>
<p><strong>Lawyer (man)</strong>: Unless you want to argue that my client stood on her head and held a wrench in her toes, we're done here.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Do you know how you contracted the rash, Lisa?</p>
<p><strong>Lisa Hunt</strong>: Best guess, I was getting some help with my homework. We were studying outside on the grass. Took a break, went for a walk. I think I brushed up against something.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Who's &quot;we&quot;?</p>
<p><strong>Lisa Hunt</strong>: My math tutor.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: And what's his name?</p>
<p><strong>Lisa Hunt</strong>: Zack Lawrence.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Do you know if he contracted the rash, as well?</p>
<p><strong>Lisa Hunt</strong>: Yeah. Actually, I gave him some of my ointment.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - CAROUSEL -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(BRASS and SARA walk up to ZACK LAWRENCE standing on the carousel.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hey, Zack.</p>
<p><strong>Zack Lawrence</strong>: Oh, hey, guys.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We spoke with Lisa. She said she gave you some ointment for some nasty rash you have.</p>
<p><strong>Zack Lawrence</strong>: Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You know, it's illegal to use someone else's prescription medications.</p>
<p><strong>Zack Lawrence</strong>: Is that why you guys are here?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Not exactly.</p>
<p><strong>Zack Lawrence</strong>: Um, you guys mind if we talk about this somewhere else?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hey, good idea. Why don't we go downtown? We can talk there.</p>
<p>(ZACK LAWRENCE leaves his broom and steps off the carousel.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Come on. Come on.</p>
<p>ZACK LAWRENCE. All right.</p>
<p>(SARA stands there thinking a moment. BRASS turns to look at her.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You coming?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You know, I'm going to catch up.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(SARA steps up onto the carousel, puts her kit down, takes out a pair of gloves and dusts the broom handle for fingerprints.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(SARA and GRISSOM interview ZACK LAWRENCE as his lawyer sits next to him. He shows them his arm.) </p>
<p><strong>Zack Lawrence</strong>: Yeah, it's, uh, just a little bit of a rash. It's really no big deal.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Zack, what do you have against roller coasters?</p>
<p><strong>Zack Lawrence</strong>: What do ... ? I-I don't understand.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: This a fingerprint analysis. (She shows him the report.) Zack, I lifted some fingerprints off your broom back at the park. Turns out, they're a match to prints that we lifted off of Jim Nevins' T-Bird and the wrench that was used to kill him.</p>
<p><strong>Lawyer (man)</strong>: Circumstantial evidence at best.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I also talked to your school principal. You're a straight &quot;A&quot; student, mathalete. Science team. You had a full ride to Stanford next year. You don't sound like the kind of kid that would mess with a roller coaster just for kicks.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You're a smart guy, Zack. So, uh ... let's talk this out, logically. According to your previous statement, when you locked up on Thursday night, Jim Nevins' car was the only one in the parking lot, right?</p>
<p><strong>Zack Lawrence</strong>: Yes, sir, that's correct.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And you knew he was staying in the park to ride the roller coaster.</p>
<p><strong>Zack Lawrence</strong>: I don't care about Jim Nevins.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What about Lisa Hunt? You tutor her, right? Did Lisa tell you that she had a date with Jim?</p>
<p><strong>Zack Lawrence</strong>: No, she didn't say anything. It was all over the park. Jim was going to take Lisa on one of his coaster dates. I asked her about it. She said it was a rumor.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It seems to matter to you that she had a date with Jim.</p>
<p><strong>Zack Lawrence</strong>: Lady, I make $20 an hour tutoring. Why do you think I'd take minimum wage at the Sphinx?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'm thinking, you want Lisa to see you away from the textbooks.</p>
<p><strong>Zack Lawrence</strong>: We started hanging out at breaks. Having dinner. And then last week, after tutoring, we went for a walk. And she grabbed my hand.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did you think that meant something?</p>
<p><strong>Zack Lawrence</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: But ... you didn't trust her.</p>
<p><strong>Zack Lawrence</strong>: No. I wanted to.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [ROLLER COASTER] ZACK stands on the ground and watches LISA on the roller coaster with JIMMY. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You tampered with the screws. If she wasn't lying, she wouldn't be on the roller coaster. No harm, no foul.</p>
<p><strong>Zack Lawrence</strong>: Oh, but you see, she was lying.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Uh-huh. But you didn't loosen the wheels enough, did you?</p>
<p><strong>Lawyer (man)</strong>: Don't answer that.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So when the roller coaster didn't derail, you took things into your own hands.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [NIGHT] ZACK LAWRENCE waits outside as JIMMY and LISA kiss and make their way off of the ride. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Lisa walked home. Jim walked over to his car.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: ZACK attacks JIM and knocks him over the back of the head with the wrench. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What I don't understand is why you didn't go back and fix the roller coaster.</p>
<p><strong>Zack Lawrence</strong>: Guess I just didn't think about it.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You'll be thinking about it now. And for the rest of your life.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. SPHINX AMUSEMENT PARK -- DAY] </p>
<p>(The OFFICERS remove the crime scene tape and open the ride.) </p>
<p><strong>Worker</strong>: All right, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to Pharaoh's Fever. Buckle up. Get ready to scream.</p>
<p>[VENDOR - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and WOODY sit at the vendor's booth sipping from their drinks.)</p>
<p><strong>Woody</strong>: I should have caught those loose screws. Used to check 'em every morning, but since management cut back on my hours ...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You're not to blame for this, Woody.</p>
<p><strong>Woody</strong>: Oh, I just hope they don't blame the coaster. It may not be the Manhattan Express at New York, New York or the Desperado in Primm, but it-it ... it still makes grown men scream.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: My first week in Vegas, I road the Desperado. </p>
<p><strong>Woody</strong>: My first coaster marathon. I rode that monster for a week straight.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hmm. The steel phantom, Kennywood Park, Pennsylvania -- I actually hold the marathon record there.</p>
<p><strong>Woody</strong>: Uh, uh. My-my favorite's still the, um, King's Island. The Beast.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mm. I presented a paper at an entomology convention in Cincinnati just so I could ride Son of Beast. Head over heels on a wooden track.</p>
<p><strong>Woody</strong>: Ah. So, you prefer wood over steel?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No. Not really. For me, it's not about the track. (smiles) It's about the thrill.</p>
<p>(The riders on the roller coaster scream as it swoops down the track.)</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>

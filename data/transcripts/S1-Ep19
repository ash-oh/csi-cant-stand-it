<p>[EXT. ANDERSON RESIDENCE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. ANDERSON HOUSE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Camera starts on the bottom of the first floor at the base of the stairway, then slowly moves upward toward the second floor.) </p>
<p>(White flash to: On the second floor, the camera travels slowly down the hallway toward the bedrooms. It rounds the cover into the master bedroom where the ANDERSONS are sleeping.)</p>
<p>(Suddenly GWEN ANDERSON gets up. She looks out the doorway into her son's room. She gets out of bed and walks down the hallway to the nursery.)</p>
<p>(All the windows are open. There's a ladder set against the window frame. The wind blows the curtains.)</p>
<p>(GWEN ANDERSON walks up to the crib and looks inside. She finds nothing. She touches the baby sheets with both hands as if not believing her eyes. She frantically searches the tiny crib, removing the sheets where she finds a sheet of paper.)</p>
<p>(She picks it up and gasps as she reads it. The paper slips from her fingers back into the crib.)</p>
<p>(She walks over to the open window, looks out side and screams.)</p>
<p><strong>Gwen Anderson</strong>: No!</p>
<p>(The camera pulls back downward to show the ladder leaning against the window frame.)</p>
<p>(STEVEN ANDERSON rushes into the nursery. He looks at his wife, then turns to look down into the crib where he finds the typewritten note. He picks it up.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. ANDERSON RESIDENCE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(OFFICER cars are parked in the driveway. GRISSOM walks up the drive and checks in with the OFFICER at the door before walking inside. He sees The ANDERSONS in the foyer.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Excuse me. My name's Gil Grissom. I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.</p>
<p><strong>Gwen Anderson</strong>: Please help us.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'll certainly try.</p>
<p>(He puts his kit down on the ground.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Is that the ransom note?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Anderson</strong>: Yeah. They don't even say how much money they want. They just say that they'll call us in six hours.</p>
<p>(STEVEN hands GRISSOM the note.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Have you let anyone else touch this note? </p>
<p>(GRISSOM reads the note:<br />
I have your son.<br />
I don't want to harm him.<br />
Don't make me.<br />
I'll call in six hours with instructions.<br />
I advise you not to call the police. )</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Police, a relative, anyone?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Anderson</strong>: N-no, just us. Why?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, because the person who touched it before you has your son ... and he's just left us the first piece of the puzzle.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER. ROLL TITLE CREDITS.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<hr />
[EXT. ANDERSON HOUSE - MORNING]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE closes the car door and makes her way toward the house. She meets up with BRASS who fills her in.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Jim, dispatch said this is a kidnapping? Divorce situation?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No papers filed. College sweethearts. Neighbors say they're the salt of the earth.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So this could have been legitimate?</p>
<p>BRASS They have a security system. But they never put it on.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: They say how come?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: They feel safe in the neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Check the premises?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Attic, wine cellar, crawl space. No four-month-old baby.</p>
<p>(They turn and head toward the house.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Nice digs.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, guy got rich off some dot-com outfit. Moved here from Oregon two years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Bet they wished they hadn't today.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. ANDERSON HOUSE - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(In the kitchen, the FBI fills STEVE ANDERSON in on what he's to do when he gets the ransom call.)</p>
<p><strong>Steve Anderson</strong>: Are you sure he won't hear a click or something?</p>
<p><strong>FBI Man</strong>: He won't. And if he asks, you and your wife are alone. Question him about your son. Ask to hear him breathing. Anything to keep the guy talking. Understood?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks into the kitchen and listens. He looks around the place.)</p>
<p><strong>Steve Anderson</strong>: I don't know. (nods) Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM sees an open bottle of soda out on the counter.)</p>
<p><strong>Steve Anderson</strong>: Okay. Built my own business. I can handle any kind of pressure.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks over to the bottle.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Was this yours?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Anderson</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: May I ask when you opened it?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Anderson</strong>: I don't know. Um, sometime after we called 911.</p>
<p>(STEVE turns back to the FBI MAN. GRISSOM looks at the bottle, then calls his attention back.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You mind if I, uh...?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Anderson</strong>: No. Go ahead.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM picks up the bottle and puts his gloved hand over the mouth of the bottle. He looks around. He walks over to the temperature gauge and checks it.)</p>
<p>(STEVE ANDERSON watches GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You have any more of these?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Anderson</strong>: In the fridge.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>(With his hand over the bottle, GRISSOM leaves the kitchen.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. ANDERSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(BRASS questions GWEN ANDERSON and her two sons who sit close to each other on the couch. TYLER, the older son, holds on to ROBBIE, who is quietly playing with a phone.)</p>
<p><strong>Gwen Anderson</strong>: Do my boys have to be here? I think this is hard enough for them without having to hear the facts.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I understand, but it's best for our investigation if we keep the whole family together.</p>
<p><strong>Tyler Anderson</strong>: (quietly) It's okay, mom.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You were saying, Mrs. Anderson?</p>
<p><strong>Gwen Anderson</strong>: Um ... I got up at 4:30, like I usually do to feed Zack. I'm still breast-feeding. And I went down to Zacky's room. I looked in his crib and he was gone. He wasn't there. </p>
<p>(STEVE walks into the room and takes a seat next to GWEN. GRISSOM follows into the room behind him.)</p>
<p><strong>Gwen Anderson</strong>: And I felt around for him and that's when I found the letter saying that he had been taken and I ... I don't know. I-I think I screamed ... </p>
<p><strong>Tyler Anderson</strong>: You screamed, mom.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Anderson</strong>: I jumped out of bed and I went to her, and that's when we called 9-1-1 from the upstairs hallway.</p>
<p>(ROBBIE pressing the buttons of the phone he's holding.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbie Anderson</strong>: Nine-1-1-1.</p>
<p><strong>Tyler Anderson</strong>: Give me the phone, Robbie. Give me the phone.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We're going to need a piece of the baby's clothing. Something from his hamper, if possible. We're going to use scent dogs throughout the neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Anderson</strong>: I'll go see what I can find.</p>
<p><strong>Gwen Anderson</strong>: No, I know what he wears.</p>
<p>(GWEN ANDERSON stands up.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'll go with you.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE also stands up. They leave the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'd also like to get blood samples from each family member.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Anderson</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, the sooner we can eliminate the expected hairs and fibers from within the household, we can begin looking for outsiders.</p>
<p><strong>Tyler Anderson</strong>: Is it going to hurt?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I hope not.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. ANDERSON HOUSE - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(OFFICERS open the back of the car to let the scent dogs out. SARA is near by putting on a pair of gloves. The OFFICERS with the dogs head toward the house. GRISSOM walks out of the house. He's carrying the ransom note and two bottles of soda pop.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sara.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Take this ransom note to Q.D.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM hands the note to SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Typewritten ransom note? Kidnapper was organized.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I think it's ink-jet not typewriter.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'll get it to questioned documents check for origination prints, the works.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Take every computer and printer from the Anderson house with you.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You think the suspect printed the ransom note from inside the house while they were sleeping?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm not thinking anything yet.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes the two soda bottles and heads for NICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Nick.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (turns around) Yo. (sees the soda bottles) No, thanks, I'm an iced tea man.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's not a refreshment. It's an experiment. Take this to the lab in a controlled space, 72 degrees Fahrenheit and open it. Keep this in the same room-temp space.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay, then what?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Process, Nick. Process.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM gives the bottles to NICK, then walks past him toward WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Baby's bedroom window is open and the ladder's still out there. So canvass the whole grounds from outside to in.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'm all over it like a cheap suit.</p>
<p>(WARRICK leaves to head over there. GRISSOM turns around and heads back to the house.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: (o.s.) Hey, Grissom! We have the smell dogs set up for you.</p>
<p>(He nods.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: WARRICK is near the ladder under the Nursery with a camera in his hand. He finds a shoe print in the dirt. He snaps a picture of it.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. ANDERSON HOUSE - BABY ZACK'S ROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes his kit and walks into the nursery. He looks into crib and puts his kit down. He leans over to look into the crib.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You see this spiderweb?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM starts.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Damn, Warrick!</p>
<p>(WARRICK is on the ladder outside the nursery window and apologizes.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'm sorry. Your ticker okay?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What spiderweb?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Right here.</p>
<p>(They push the curtain aside to show GRISSOM the spiderweb in the corner of the window frame.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Kind of hard to get a baby out of a window climb onto a ladder without messing up this web, don't you think?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, it could have happened after the abduction. Spiders can build one of these things in a few hours.</p>
<p>(WARRICK takes a picture of the spiderweb. GRISSOM turns to head back to the crib. WARRICK steps up the ladder intending to climb through the window. GRISSOM looks up and sees WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Warrick? What are you doing? (He motions with his finger.) Go around.</p>
<p>(WARRICK heads back down the ladder.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM checks the crib out and finds a strand of hair. Camera zooms in for an extreme close up.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. ANDERSON HOUSE - LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and GWEN ANDERSON walk into the laundry room. GWEN starts going through the laundry basket.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, you're right on the golf course. That must be nice.</p>
<p><strong>Gwen Anderson</strong>: Steve likes it. I never cared for the game.</p>
<p>(GWEN finds a jumper and pulls it out of the basket. She sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Gwen Anderson</strong>: That one's my favorite but Zacky, he, uh ... he liked another one. Here it is.</p>
<p>(She takes it out and shows it to CATHERINE. She chuckles.)</p>
<p><strong>Gwen Anderson</strong>: There's a little spit-up on it. He liked the way the fabric felt on his skin. </p>
<p>(She puts the outfit to her face and inhales. She stops, then looks down at her shirt to see her milk leaking.)</p>
<p><strong>Gwen Anderson</strong>: Oh, god.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It's okay. It used to happen to me with my daughter if I didn't get to her right on time.</p>
<p>(GWEN tries to wipe up the mess as she cries.)</p>
<p><strong>Gwen Anderson</strong>: I can't believe this is happening to us.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE puts a supporting hand on her shoulder.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'll get this to our guys.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE leaves the laundry room.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. ANDERSON HOUSE - NURSERY - DAY -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM finds another strand of hair in the crib. He puts it in a bindle.)</p>
<p>(WARRICK walks into the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What you got?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Two hairs, separate and distinctive.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM hands the bindles to WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Ah. The plot thickens.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks around the room. He notices something.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You smell something?</p>
<p>(WARRICK smells and sees something.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I smell these dirty diapers over here.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM kneels down in front of the window.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's like a household cleanser. There's a pine smell.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Probably used to clean that diaper pail.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No, it's stronger than that. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM puts his nose to the carpet.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's emanating from this specific spot.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM opens his kit and tests for blood. It shows positive.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Baby was killed before it even left the house. Guy tried to cover his tracks.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and WARRICK both look at the open window.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - QUESTIONED DOCUMENTS LAB - DAY]</p>
<p>(SARA leans over the table, arguing with RONNIE LITRE.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What do you mean you haven't checked for prints? It's a ransom letter.</p>
<p><strong>Ronnie Litre</strong>: Everything in the proper order. You know that. I got five other tests I got to run on this paper before I try to isolate prints.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You got anything for me?</p>
<p><strong>Ronnie Litre</strong>: Yeah. The paper's expensive. High rag count.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I could have told you that.</p>
<p><strong>Ronnie Litre</strong>: Can you explain these three small vertical dots?</p>
<p>(On the overhead, he shows SARA what he's talking about.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What? Where?</p>
<p><strong>Ronnie Litre</strong>: The printer that emitted this letter has a spot on the drum.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: A drum goes around three times to print one page. </p>
<p>(Quick flash to: Close up of the drum of a printer turning as the paper goes through leaving behind three small dots on the sheet.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So if the Andersons' printer was used ... </p>
<p><strong>Ronnie Litre</strong>: There'd be three small dots on any paper that comes out.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No vertical dots.</p>
<p><strong>Ronnie Litre</strong>: And different paper than the ransom letter F.Y.I.</p>
<p>(SARA makes a face at RONNIE.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. ANDERSON HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and WARRICK stand outside the nursery window.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, this mold I made of that shoe print matches the gardener's boot that I found in the shed over there.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, well, we need to look for what's out of place.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: And a gardener's boot in a garden is not out of place. Well, the Andersons did say the guy's been out of town on vacation for the last three days.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM'S phone rings. He answers it.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to phone) Grissom.</p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH:</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - HALLWAY]</p>
<p>(SARA walks through the hallway.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Ransom note's not from the Anderson's printer or paper supply.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You're breaking up.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The Andersons are clear. Whoever wrote the letter did it from a different location and brought it with them.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Are you standing next to the copy machine outside ballistics?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You want me to check ballistics?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No. I want you to move away from that machine. Look, check all the printers at Steve Anderson's company.</p>
<p>(In the background out on the golf course, the dogs bark loudly. WARRICK looks up at the commotion.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to phone) Get Q.D. To help you with a warrant. Target all immediate coworkers and disgruntled employees first.</p>
<p>(WARRICK motions for GRISSOM to follow him as he heads toward the sound of the dogs. GRISSOM puts the phone down, his attention on the dogs.)</p>
<p>(Even SARA can hear the dogs barking over the phone.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Are those our dogs? Grissom? Grissom!</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and WARRICK start running toward the commotion. GRISSOM tucks the phone into his pocket.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. GOLF COURSE - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Out on the golf course, the dogs bark frantically. They lead the OFFICERS to a cluster of bushes under the tree. WARRICK and GRISSOM run to the bushes.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Get those dogs back. Get them back!</p>
<p>(WARRICK and GRISSOM find the baby dead in the center of the bushes, his body wrapped carefully in a blanket. The officers also reach the site.)</p>
<p>(The TECH takes a step forward to start taking picture of the scene. GRISSOM stops him.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Stand back.</p>
<p><strong>CSI Tech</strong>: We got to have pictures. The coroner will be all over us.</p>

As for leads, the police will only say they have widened the investigation to include employees of Steve Anderson's company. Immediate coworkers are being asked to give DNA samples.

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He was smothered.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: (nods) The retinal hemorrhages are the result of intercranial pressure from an edema. The edema was caused by an acute lack of oxygen.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Smothered how? Did you find hand marks? Trauma around the mouth or nose?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He was in a blanket when I found him ... wrapped pretty tight.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Positional asphyxiation? Maybe. Abductor might've tried to protect him from the cold. Suffocated him by mistake. I'm going to run tests on a microscopic fiber I found in his throat.</p>
<p>(DR. ROBBINS picks up a fiber from the side to show to GRISSOM. Camera zooms in for a close up.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: But I don't think his death was benign, Gil. Or accidental. Sternum was cracked. X rays say the fracture is fresh. Manhandled and suffocated. This little guy didn't have a chance.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We need to refer to him as the case unfolds.</p>
<p><strong>Gwen Anderson</strong>: Well, do you have any leads? Any idea who did this?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Your child was found five hundred yards from your back door, in clean clothes wrapped in a white blanket, laid carefully under a statuary.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: A stranger wouldn't treat a victim like that.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Anderson</strong>: You think we had something to do with this?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The FBI tells us that you never received a call from the abductor. What kind of a kidnapper forgets to call the family?</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And you wiped up the blood with some type of pine cleanser. </p>
<p><strong>Tyler Anderson</strong>: I thought I got it all.</p>

<p><strong>Steve Anderson</strong>: We had a homeowner's association vote meeting. It was just five doors up from our house.</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We contacted the Association. The story checks out. I also did a background search. Tyler has quite a temper on him, don't you, Ty?</p>

<p><strong>Steve Anderson</strong>: We broke up the day that I learned that Gwen was pregnant with Zack. I love Needra but I love my family more. Needra asked if she could see Zack after he was born to help her kind of accept the reality. So, I had her in last Saturday to watch him sleep.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: In the nursery, NEEDRA stands over the crib. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You've lied to me before.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Anderson</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You told me that you opened that cola bottle the morning you reported Zack missing. We had a test done. You opened that bottle six hours before you said you did -- the night before -- somewhere around 11:00 P.M. The lab is still testing it. I also believe that you cut it with alcohol.</p>

<p>(She hands STEVE ANDERSON some photographs of him with NEEDRA FENWAY.)</p>

<p><strong>Gwen Anderson</strong>: He had gotten food in his windpipe. His face was ... turning red. Steve was at work. So, I, I patted him on his back and-and on ... and on his stomach and finally, I turned him upside down and I started shaking him to get the food out ... to ... to dislodge it, and I did. But I realized that I had hurt him, so I called 911.</p>
<p><strong>Brad Lewis</strong>: She was a new mother -- 23 years old. If she'd meant to harm her son why would she call 911?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did the E.R. find proof that there was food lodged in Tyler's throat?</p>
<p><strong>Brad Lewis</strong>: No. That's why the police were called in. And by the time my client went home and found the chewed food on the kitchen floor it was all too late. She was branded.</p>
<p><strong>Gwen Anderson</strong>: It was a french fry. He'd grabbed it from my plate.</p>
<p><strong>Brad Lewis</strong>: As for the death of little Zachary, my client categorically denies any involvement. She's a victim of an intruder who entered her home and abducted and killed her child. Thank you all for your continued efforts to find the real killer.</p>
<p>(BRAD LEWIS moves to stand up. GRISSOM stops them.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did you know that your golf course paints its grass?</p>
<p><strong>Gwen Anderson</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's actually a vegetable dye. Biodegradable. They've been using green dye on television tournaments for several years.</p>
<p><strong>Brad Lewis</strong>: What's your point?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I found a pair of nylons in the back of your husband's closet.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We, uh we have a receipt that links them to your client.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The exact same dye from the golf course where Zachary was laid to rest is on your nylons.</p>
<p><strong>Brad Lewis</strong>: She belongs to the club. Grass stains.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: But she doesn't play golf. Remember our conversation, Mrs. Anderson? It's not your game?</p>
<p>(GWEN ANDERSON doesn't say anything.)</p>
<p><strong>Brad Lewis</strong>: If you arrest her now ... you have 48 hours to charge her. You really want to show your hand at the arraignment?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (stands up) We'll be in touch.</p>

<p>(GWEN ANDERSON walks up to the car where STEVE is carrying ROBBIE who has his arms out for mommy. TYLER stands behind them.)</p>
<p><strong>Steve Anderson</strong>: Look. ROBBIE ANDERSON: Mommy, I want my mommy.</p>
<p>(GWEN walks up to them and instead of taking ROBBIE from STEVE, she walks around them to the car.)</p>
<p><strong>Gwen Anderson</strong>: Hey. Can we just go, please? TYLER ANDERSON: What's going on?</p>
<p>(Standing near the window watching them, CATHERINE and GRISSOM are both surprised by what they just saw.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Did you see that?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: A mother repelled by her young.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: She didn't seem like that type to me.</p>
<p>(Outside, GWEN is in the car. STEVE hands ROBBIE over to TYLER.)</p>
<p><strong>Steve Anderson</strong>: All right, okay. Here, go to your brother.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE turns to leave the window.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'll catch you later. I want to hear that 911 tape.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM remains by the window watching. On her way out, CATHERINE passes SARA who walks toward GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Grissom? </p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns around.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The coroner's been trying to reach you.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did he nail time of death?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: 9:00 P.M., But, uh, there's something else. He isolated the fiber found in Zachary Anderson's throat. It's a flame-retardant material -- generic name's metaramid.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: From the baby's clothes?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Fire-retardant infant's clothes are made out of vinyon. The fiber found in Zack's throat is a stronger chemical treatment. It's found in things that are made to be near fire and flames. </p>
<p>(Something occurs to GRISSOM and he quickly turns and heads out the hallway. SARA sees him leave and quickly follows.)</p>

<p>(GRISSOM pulls out a towel, then tosses it on the counter.)</p>
<p>(He opens the next drawer and stops. He's found it. The pot holders. SARA looks at them.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Same color as the fiber in Zack's throat.</p>

[INT. CSI - AUDIO/VISUAL LAB -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and WARRICK work on the 911 tapes.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Okay, this is the 911 call from the Anderson house at 4:30 A.M.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Anderson</strong>: (from tape) Our baby has been kidnapped. 493 Fairmark. Please hurry.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mrs. Anderson wasn't there?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You wouldn't think so but I went ahead and separated out any underlying voices.</p>
<p><strong>Gwen Anderson</strong>: (hysterical) What are we going to do?!</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: She was standing, like, two meters from the phone.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, well, it's a legitimate comment. Doesn't make her guilty of anything.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I know, so I checked to see if she was, like, faking her concern. This program measures the stress level of the speakers.</p>
<p><strong>Gwen Anderson</strong>: (from tape) Oh, god, what are we going to do?!</p>
<p>(WARRICK points to the results on the monitor of the 911 call from: Las Vegas, NV 89109 for (702) 555-0133.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: The stress is real.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Are you familiar with the JonBenet case?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: A little.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, the police went back, and they found an earlier call that was placed from the home to 911 and the audio tests separated out the son's voice. Now, I'm not saying that Tyler's our guy, but ... we need to check into every avenue.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, I did backtrack and there were no other calls that night from the Anderson house-- from the land line, or from the cell phone.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: In the parents' name, but did you look under Tyler's? I mean, a rich kid like that's probably got a cell phone.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah. All right, I'll get into it.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE'S phone rings. She answers it.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (from phone) Anderson's attorney. Seven a.m.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: 7:00 A.M.? I'll be there.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (from phone) Bring all the evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah. I'll bring it all. Thanks.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE stands up and leaves the room. She waves to WARRICK as she goes.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - MORNING]</p>
<hr />
[INT. CONFERENCE ROOM -- MORNING]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and GRISSOM walk into the large conference room.) </p>
<p><strong>Brad Lewis</strong>: My colleagues, Messrs. Landry and Frank are representing Steve and Tyler Anderson respectively. Although we're not co-counsel in the strictest sense we've agreed the authorities should have no more than three questions to put to our clients each. After that, we'll accept written submissions only.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Nice ... what money can buy.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Anderson</strong>: My family is done being railroaded by you people so just ask your questions, and let's go.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I don't have any questions. We know what happened in your house the night Zachary died. We've interpreted the evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: All right, let's work backwards starting with the cover-up. Sometime around 11:00 P.M. the night of the kidnapping you and Mr. Anderson had a drink -- rum and cola ...</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: That night. STEVE ANDERSON pours himself a drink. He drinks and rests his elbows on the counter top trying to think.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) ... and decided what to do with the body of Zachary.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We have yet to determine whether or not his death was accidental or intentional.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The question documents lab thinks that a parent wrote the ransom note because there's no money amount. </p>
<p>(He shows them a photocopy of the ransom note.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Too hard to put a price on your own son?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mrs. Anderson, while your husband was writing the ransom note, you wrapped Zachary's body in a blanket that you got from the upstairs linen closet.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: GWEN ANDERSON opens the linen closet door and gets a blanket out. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You then laid his body to rest near a statue on the golf course.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: GWEN ANDERSON carries the baby to the statue on the golf course. She kneels down in the grass. Camera close up of her knee on the grass. She puts the baby down, placing him carefully on the grass. She cries and slowly backs away. She leaves. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's how you got the grass stains on your nylons.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM hands over a photo to BRAD LEWIS to look at.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You put down a plastic bag from the pantry so that he'd remain dry. Evidence of genuine care and concern. </p>
<p>(TYLER turns to look at his mom who is slowly falling apart at hearing the story recounted for them.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And Mr. Anderson you put up a ladder outside the window.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The only shoe prints we found were yours and the gardener's and the gardener has been out of town. You then drove over to your office and cranked off a ransom note on the first available printer ...</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: STEVE ANDERSON is in the office printing out the ransom note.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) ... possibly thinking that if you used a printer from outside your house, we wouldn't be able to trace it. </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: But these three dots ... have given you away.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM hands over the photo to BRAD LEWIS.)</p>
<p><strong>Brad Lewis</strong>: This may prove cover-up. None of it proves they killed Zachary.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You're right, counselor. Zachary's life was taken much earlier in the evening. The coroner estimated time of death at 9:00 P.M.</p>
<p><strong>Brad Lewis</strong>: Estimated. It could be 8:30.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yes. While Robbie and Zachary were in Tyler's care. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns to look at TYLER. GWEN sees where this is heading.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You said that we could ask three questions each. Am I right?</p>
<p><strong>Gwen Anderson</strong>: Stop. Ty didn't do this.</p>
<p><strong>Brad Lewis</strong>: Don't give them anything.</p>
<p><strong>Gwen</strong>: No, no. It doesn't matter. We're already ruined. Look, they're just ... they're just trying to protect me, all right? </p>
<p><strong>Brad Lewis</strong>: Please. </p>
<p><strong>Gwen Anderson</strong>: And I can't go on.</p>
<p><strong>Brad Lewis</strong>: (warning) Mrs. Anderson.</p>
<p><strong>Gwen Anderson</strong>: I killed him. I came home. Tyler h-h-hadn't put Zachary to bed because he ... he was crying, and I wanted to hush him up and, and I just ... I went too far.</p>
<p><strong>Brad Lewis</strong>: For the record my client made this statement against legal counsel.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Would you tell us ... how you killed him.</p>
<p><strong>Gwen Anderson</strong>: I smothered him with a pot holder. And that's when Steve and I came up with the kidnap story.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Anderson</strong>: It was the longest night of our lives.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You had to wait till morning to report him missing.</p>
<p><strong>Gwen Anderson</strong>: So that it wouldn't look suspicious. And you may not believe me, but I loved him. I loved him very, very much.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We're going to have to have them both arrested.</p>
<p>(BRAD LEWIS nods.)</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Guilty people do that when you corner them with evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Guys, the mother didn't do it.</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Listen.</p>
<p>(WARRICK hands GRISSOM the earphones. GRISSOM puts them on and listens to the tape.)</p>

<p>(He looks inside the crib and finds that ZACH isn't moving. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>

<p>(GRISSOM reaches for the tape player.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to the phone falling to the floor.)</p>

<p><strong>Steve Anderson</strong>: We did everything that we could.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Why didn't you just tell the truth? </p>
<p><strong>Steve Anderson</strong>: We wanted to protect Robbie. (his voice breaks) We didn't want him to grow up with the stigma of ... &quot;the boy who killed his brother.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He's three. He's clinically unaware of his actions. No court would hold him accountable for that.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Anderson</strong>: But everybody else would know. It would follow him the rest of his life. And my wife ... would rather go to prison than to have anybody know what Robbie did.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mr. Anderson, we won't let that happen.</p>

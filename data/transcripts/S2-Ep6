<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. SUV -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(A PARK RANGER driving along the road route and notices a car parked on the side of the road. He stops the car to check it out. Garbled radio transmissions can be heard in the background.)</p>
<p>(He gets out of the car and puts on his park ranger hat. The officer walks to the edge of the road, slips and rolls down the hill. When he comes to a stop, he lands next to a dead body. In the shadow of the bright light, there's a man holding a shovel, digging a hole - caught in the act trying to bury the body.)</p>
<p>(Frozen for a moment, the man springs into action. He throws the shovel aside and tries to run, the officer stops him.)</p>
<p><strong>Benjamin Jennings</strong>: No! No!</p>
<p>WHITE FLASH CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
(GRISSOM and NICK make their way down the ledge to the crime scene. There are five police vehicles there and a swarm of officers near the crime scene looking for further evidence on the grounds. Kneeling next to the body is a Technician with a clipboard. SGT. O'RILEY meets up with GRISSOM and NICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Call said one dead body.</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. O'Riley</strong>: Caught him red-handed. Ben Jennings.</p>
<p>(Off to the side, BENJAMIN JENNINGS stands hands cuffed behind his back with three officers standing watch over him. NICK and GRISSOM approach the men.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Nick Stokes, Gil Grissom, Las Vegas Crime Lab. You want to tell us what's going on? What happened here?</p>
<p>(BENJAMIN JENNINGS doesn't respond.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You have anything to say? </p>
<p>(He still doesn't respond.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You don't have to talk to us.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM shines the light of his flashlight on the dead body.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He'll talk to us.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO: END OF TEASER. ROLL TITLE CREDITS.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS DESERT -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Camera opens on the body. GRISSOM and NICK are crouched low examining the body. Garbled radio transmissions can be heard in the background.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: See that lividity? Blood settled at the time of death.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Body's been moved from the murder scene. Impound his car.</p>
<p>(SARA shows up.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Sorry, guys. I lost you at the fork.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: My bad, Sara.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks up at BENJAMIN JENNINGS.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Let's process this guy shall we? Officer, would you uncuff him, please?!</p>
<p>(The officer uncuffs BENJAMIN JENNINGS.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes out a black light and begins examining him from the back. NICK puts his CSI kit down.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay, make like a scarecrow for me, partner. </p>
<p>(BENJAMIN JENNINGS doesn't move. NICK spreads his arms out to show him what he means. BENJAMIN JENNINGS copies him.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Arms out, away from your body. That's it. Stay just like that.</p>
<p>(SARA crouches low on the ground to collect his shoe prints.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Give me your right foot. Other right. Put it down. Lift it up.</p>
<p>(NICK checks out the front and begins collecting. GRISSOM finds something on his back.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hold still. </p>
<p>(He finds a single strand of hair and holds it up.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Possible secondary transfer ...</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Got some red fibers.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Other foot. Lift it up. Put it down.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM examines BENJAMIN JENNINGS' arms.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No defensive wounds. No hematomas.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Victim didn't fight back. Probably didn't see it coming.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Matthew ... tag that body for special processing, VIP room. Don't wash it till I get there, and don't touch his fingernails.</p>

[EXT. MEDITERRANEAN HOTEL AND CASINO -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(WARRICK'S SUV stops outside the hotel. CATHERINE is holding a piece of paper and reading as she and WARRICK enter the hotel.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: &quot;D.B. ... Mediterranean Casino ... Women's Spa.&quot;</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. MEDITERRANEAN HOTEL AND CASINO - LOCKER ROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(BRASS is already there when WARRICK and CATHERINE enter the locker room area. BRASS meets them and they all start walking to the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Body is Shelley Danvers. DOB: 10/10/81. Employee walked in to get towels ... </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
<strong>Brass</strong>: ... found her here.</p>
<p>[Clips of the crime scene from various perspectives flash in quick pulses. Flash to white:<br />
* Red spot on right thigh. Flash to white.<br />
* Magazine open on the floor. Flash to white.<br />
* View of victim on the locker bench. Flash to white.]</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: A young woman, healthy, just reading a magazine and all of a sudden she DFO'S?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Done fell out. That's what the night manager says.</p>
<p>(WARRICK turns his head and sees the Night Manager talking with an officer.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Miss?</p>
<p>(WARRICK approaches the Night Manager.)</p>
<p><strong>Kim Marita</strong>: (to officer) Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We're from the Crime Lab. You found the deceased?</p>
<p><strong>Kim Marita</strong>: Yes, I was, um ... just getting some towels and I walked in and she was there.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks at the body and notices the knot on the robe on the deceased.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, Brass ... you touch this body?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, I was born yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, it looks as if the sash may have been tied by somebody else.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Miss ... you know anything about redressing the body?</p>
<p><strong>Kim Marita</strong>: Well, she was naked. I-I-I thought she should be covered </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Did you move the body here, too?</p>
<p><strong>Kim Marita</strong>: Guests were looking in. I put a robe on her. It's not like it's a crime or anything.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Actually, it is.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Makes us doubt the circumstances surrounding the victim's death.</p>
<p>(Camera holds on KIM MARITA'S concerned look.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - VIP ROOM]</p>
<p>(SARA scrapes off something from the dead body's forehead.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Flour, maybe?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: But what kind? All-purpose? Self-rising? Pastry?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Trace will probably have a better idea. I'll get DNA to see if there's bits of Ben under the fingernails.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What about the neck? Any fibers in the wound?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You told me to wait for you.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, that hasn't stopped you yet.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I did observe some fibers in the wound. I didn't collect them, though.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Be my guest.</p>
<p>(SARA picks up the fibers from the dead body's neck. Camera close up on the fibers.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yellow. Not cotton; satin, maybe.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM straightens and looks down at the body. He notices something.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Dress shirt ... but no tie.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Strangled with his own tie?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Find me on the flour.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM leaves.)</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: &quot;Shelley Danvers&quot; -- appointment 8:00.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Ms. Marita, did the deceased use the jacuzzi facilities this evening?</p>
<p><strong>Kim Marita</strong>: Not that I remember, no. (A gurney clangs as the coroner's office removes the body.) What? You don't believe me?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, you lied to us before.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It's, uh, not uncommon to drown in a jacuzzi. Hair gets caught in the whirl a person gets dragged under. The hotel wouldn't be considered unsafe.</p>
<p><strong>Kim Marita</strong>: Well, that didn't happen here. She did not drown on these premises.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, if she did, the coroner would find water in her lungs but it'd be worse hearing it from him than from you.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>

[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY]</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Oliver Dunne. Corporate lawyer. Father of two.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You get all that from his ... uh ... dentals?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: His wife-- widow. She came down to I.D. His property.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: .380s?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Last one I recovered entered through his abdominals ... </p>
<p>(CGI POV flash to white as the bullet penetrates an x-ray black &amp; white replication of the body. Resume to present. Camera on GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (V.O.) ... pierced the liver, lodged in the oblique.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's not what killed him, is it? We pulled a yellow fiber out of the neck wound. I think it's from his tie.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: You might be right. He died of asphyxiation. Tie probably closed the windpipe. </p>
<p>(White flash to CGI POV as an x-ray bluish-white replication of a hand grasping a neck. Sounds of a person choking. Camera moves up the body through the mouth, down the throat, through the windpipe, into the lungs to a magnification of red and black colored air sacs. End of CGI POV. Resume on ROBBINS.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Without oxygen, the alveoli capillaries wither and dry up. Whole pulmonary system shut down. What you may have here is the smallest sliver of the murder weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Why would a guy shoot a man three times and then strangle him with his own tie?</p>
<p>(SARA enters holding the file folder with the results of the flour test.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I cannot tell you why, but I might be able to tell you where. A pizza shop. The flour on Oliver Dunne has a low gluten content -- seven percent protein -- it's typical of flour used to make cakes, pizzas, that kind of thing.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So, why did you rule out bakeries?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, the subtype of flour is another subtype -- double zero. It's a very fine flour used only in pizza-baking ovens. Oh, and trace picked up some oregano in the sample. When are you set to interview Ben?</p>
<p>(Camera holds on GRISSOM.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERROGATION ROOM]</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You're the registered owner of a Lorcin .380. Takes the same caliber bullet as the slugs we took out of the victim. So, I'm going to ask you one more time. Where's your gun?</p>
<p><strong>Benjamin Jennings</strong>: I lost it.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Do you think we believe that? Do you think ... </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Are you employed, Ben?</p>
<p><strong>Benjamin Jennings</strong>: Yeah... yeah, um ... it's a place called Dante's Pizzeria. It's behind the Strato'.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You make pizzas?</p>
<p><strong>Benjamin Jennings</strong>: Well, I deliver the pizzas. It's too hot back there with all the ovens and stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Do you, uh ... ever come into contact with the baking flour at Dante's?</p>
<p><strong>Benjamine Jennings</strong>: Mostly pizza boxes. Why?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, 'cause we found flour on the victim and it's the kind that's used to make pizza. Can you explain that?</p>
<p><strong>Benjamin Jennings</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Ben, why don't you earn yourself some points by telling me what the science is going to tell me anyway?</p>
<p><strong>Benjamin Jennings</strong>: Well, I don't have to talk.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No ... but we're going to figure it out.</p>
<p><strong>Benjamin Jennings</strong>: Look, if you know so much about these murders what do you need me for?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Murders? There are more bodies?</p>
<p>(Camera holds on BENJAMIN JENNINGS.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS DESERT -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM, NICK, SARA and a group of other officers start sweeping the area where OLIVER DUNNE'S body was found. NICK is pushing a GeoRadar Inc. machine. SARA walks next to him holding a laptop that shows the various items being scanned by the machine. As it approaches various items, the laptop beeps.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I feel like I'm mowing a lawn.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What is that? A beer can? Soda can?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Zilch.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Zilch.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Don't tell me, more zilch?</p>
<p>(On SARA'S laptop, the figure of a hand appears.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Whoa... whoa. Point of disturbance.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hold up.</p>
<p>(More arm and body appears on the radar's screen.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Isolate it.</p>
<p>(Finally, we definitely see the shape of a person's head. They've definitely found a body.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Grissom ...</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns around to look at BENJAMIN JENNINGS standing off in the distance with SGT. O'RILEY and three officers. His face is grim. He makes his way back to BENJAMIN JENNINGS and stops behind him.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Any more bodies you want to tell me about?</p>
<p><strong>Benjamin Jennings</strong>: (shakes head) No.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We're going to radar this whole hillside.</p>
<p>(BENJAMIN JENNINGS nods his head.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (softly) Sometimes ... when I leave a crime scene where I've been particularly involved with a dead body, I sit in my car and it hits me -- how close I was ... how heavy the body is ... the texture of the body ... how it feels... you know?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM leaves to go back to the site and stops when BENJAMIN JENNINGS speaks.)</p>
<p><strong>Benjamin Jennings</strong>: Mr. Grissom ... I'm not a bad person.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns around.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You're not a bad person?</p>
<p>(BENJAMIN JENNINGS shakes his head.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Then, what are you?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns and walks away.)</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>

[INT. CSI -- HALLWAY]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE enters and sees DAVID PHILLIPS pushing a gurney toward her down the hallway.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, I hope that's Shelley Danvers the woman from the hotel spa.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Yep, she's next.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, it's about time. You guys finished with day-shift runover, huh?</p>
<p>(DAVID pushes the gurney into the Forensic Autopsy Room. CATHERINE follows him into the room.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: I hate it when you CSI guys get territorial.</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY - DAY -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, well, the victims' families hate it when we don't.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: I'll take it from here, David.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Good morning.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Catherine.</p>
<p>(ROBBINS lifts up the sheet covering SHELLEY DANVERS.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: No serosanguineous fluid expunged from the mouth or nose.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: She didn't drown?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Rules out your jacuzzi theory.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Anything probative?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Bright red lividity extending down the body.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: From?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Well, heatstroke possibly. Stroke could cause multiple organ failure and if I'm right ... </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: ... cover-up. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks out of the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Hey, I still have to do the post. Catherine?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY JUST OUTSIDE FORENSIC AUTOPSY - MORNING -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE pulls out her cell phone and dials.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Brass, I need you to get records from that hotel spa -- a warrant, if we need it. Yep, that's right. Bye.</p>
<p>(She hangs up just as WARRICK walks to meet her. He turns around when he catches up with CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Oh, it's on.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah. Was our girl staying with anyone at that hotel?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Uh, yeah. Tina ... Tina Kolas. Best friends from Terre Haute, Indiana. Flew here in a package. Why?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We need someone to give us the truth about last night.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS DESERT -- MORNING]</p>
<p>(The body is being excavated from the site. NICK is inside the hole with the body and is using a shovel to remove the dirt. GRISSOM stands up above with SARA and other Foresnic personnel. SARA is sifting the dirt around the site looking for evidence. Behind them, FATHER POWELL approaches.)</p>
<p><strong>Father Powell</strong>: Gil Grissom?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Father?</p>
<p><strong>Father Powell</strong>: Benjamin's a member of my parish. The officer won't let me talk to him. He said you were in charge.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He set up his brother.</p>
<p><strong>Robin Childs</strong>: Oh, come on, Grissom, they're both part of it and if I can get one of them, I will.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He's a good kid, Robin. He hero-worships his brother, but he's a good kid.</p>

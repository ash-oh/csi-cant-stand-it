<p>FLASH TO WHITE:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS STREET - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(A dark-colored SUV recklessly races through the streets, police cars after it, their sirens wailing.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: (over radio) We have a high-speed chase in progress. Heading Eastbound on 74th street. Over.</p>
<p>(The speeding SUV turns into a parking lot, side-swipes a parked car and continues out of the parking lot and back onto the street.</p>
<p>(The SUV turns off of the road and onto the grassy area, the police cars right on its tail.)</p>
<p>(The SUV turns back onto the busy street, weaving in and out of traffic as other cars swerve and brake to avoid hitting it. The police cars are still on its tail.)</p>
<p>(The SUV turns and swerves into a tunnel. It exits the tunnel and onto the strip.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: (over radio) 314 Baker, driver seems intoxicated.</p>
<p>(The SUV appears to be losing speed. It slowly side-swipes several cars parked on the side of the road.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: This is Charlie 324. Hang back. Over.</p>
<p>(The SUV turns off the road and slowly comes to a stop in front of a large hotel/casino.)</p>
<p>[EXT. HOTEL/CASINO - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(DET. LOCKWOOD exits the police car behind the SUV. His weapon drawn.)</p>
<p><strong>Lockwood</strong>: Driver! Cut the engine and throw the keys out the window.</p>
<p>(He takes a couple of steps toward the vehicle.)</p>
<p><strong>Lockwood</strong>: Driver! Cut the engine and throw the keys out the window!</p>
<p>(He waits a moment, then starts to yell out instructions again.)</p>
<p><strong>Lockwood</strong>: Driver ...</p>
<p>(The driver's door slowly opens and a man gets out. He slowly turns around.)</p>
<p>(LOCKWOOD slowly puts his weapon down, a look of horror on his face as he realizes what he's looking at.)</p>
<p>(The man has a wooden stake embedded in the top of his head. He falls to his knees, then collapses to the ground in front of LOCKWOOD.)</p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. HOTEL/CASINO -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(A large crowd has gathered around the contained crime scene. GRISSOM and LOCKWOOD make their way through the crowd.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Excuse us. Excuse me, sir. Thank You.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and LOCKWOOD break out of the crowd and make their way to the body. GRISSOM carries his CSI kit.)</p>
<p><strong>Lockwood</strong>: Death: The cheapest show in Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, it doesn't surprise me. You remember the MGM fire? We found people burned to their slot machines 'cause they wouldn't leave the action.</p>
<p><strong>Lockwood</strong>: Only in Vegas.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM puts his kit down and kneels next to the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This guy's got a piece of wood sticking out of his head.</p>
<p><strong>Lockwood</strong>: Alex James, age 42. Found his wallet in the glove compartment. SUV is registered to him. No previous record. How was he able to drive?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I once saw a guy walk fifteen blocks with three bullets in his face.</p>
<p><strong>Lockwood</strong>: The victim was traveling west on flamingo. The Desert Palm isn't too far from here. I guess he was en route to the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I don't much care where he was going. I want to know where he's been.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[EXT. VENETIAN HOTEL/CASINO (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<hr />
[INT. HOTEL/CASINO - BACK GARAGE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(WARRICK and CATHERINE slowly make their way across the garage, their CSI kits in hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Like coming in the back way, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, makes us VIPs tonight.</p>
<p>(A bellhop approaches them and nods to CATHERINE and WARRICK'S kits.)</p>
<p><strong>Bellhop</strong>: Let me help you, ma'am. Sir?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It's okay.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No, thanks. Oh, it's not luggage. Thank you, though.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. TUNNEL LEADING TO HOTEL -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(They meet up with the HOTEL MANAGER.)</p>
<p><strong>Hotel Manager</strong>: You must be CSI.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'm Warrick Brown. This is Catherine Willows.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You said you had a situation in your casino?</p>
<p><strong>Hotel Manager</strong>: A kidnap.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Is it a high profile?</p>
<p><strong>Hotel Manager</strong>: Yes. We'd like to deal with this locally before we involve the FBI.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, until we know the victim was taken over state lines, the FBI has no jurisdiction. Do you have any contact from the kidnappers?</p>
<p><strong>Hotel Manager</strong>: A ransom note was left at the front desk.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Who are we looking for here?</p>
<p><strong>Hotel Manager</strong>: A five-year-old boy.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Whose five-year-old boy?</p>
<p><strong>Hotel Manager</strong>: Tavian Tombs.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Tavian Tombs, professional basketball player. Very high profile.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(Through various dissolves: WARRICK and CATHERINE follow the HOTEL MANAGER representative through the hallway.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. HOTEL - TOMBS' HOTEL ROOM]</p>
<p>(The hotel room doors open. CATHERINE and WARRICK walk inside. TAVIAN TOMBS' back is to the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Tavian Tombs</strong>: (angrily) I got eight people to make sure that something like this does not happen. Where the hell was everybody? Out spending my money?<br />
(to the Head SECURITY GUARD) You're supposed to be the head of security, and you let my son get kidnapped right from under my nose.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mr. Tombs ... </p>
<p>(TAVIAN TOMBS turns around.)</p>
<p><strong>Tavian Tombs</strong>: You better have a good reason for being here.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We're here to find your son.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We're with the crime lab, and I'm assuming that that's our ransom note.</p>
<p><strong>Tavian Tombs</strong>: It's my note, my kid, my show.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Look, I've seen you take out three guys on the glass and still finish. I'm not here to bang boards with you. I'm here to do my job. (beat) It's your son; it's your call.</p>
<p>(In the next room, two little boys play video games. CATHERINE turns to look at them as she puts her gloves on.)</p>
<p><strong>Tramelle</strong>: I'm going to dunk on you again.</p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(TAVIAN TOMBS holds out the ransom note. WARRICK takes it.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (reading) &quot;I have Isaiah. Bring $5 million to the northwest corner of Telfair and Juniper, 4:00 A.M.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: How many of you touched this letter?</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong>: I did.</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: I just want my boy back.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Did this note come in an envelope?</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong>: Yeah ... I threw it in the wastebasket.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE steps up and takes the envelope from the trash.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to WARRICK) We have a better chance of getting uncompromised prints off of this.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You said that Captain Brass was here?</p>
<p><strong>Hotel Manager</strong>: Yeah. He's interviewing the nanny.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. HOTEL - TAVIAN TOMBS' ROOM - NEXT ROOM]</p>
<p>(BRASS is interviewing the Nanny.)</p>
<p><strong>The Nanny</strong>: We were at the carnival, me and the boys.</p>
<p>(She sighs.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to their day at the Carnival.)</p>
<p><strong>The Nanny</strong>: (V.O.) They wanted to ride on the carousel. I said no.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: But you gave in.</p>
<p><strong>The Nanny</strong>: Special weekend. Dad's in town. Everybody's together. Trust me, they don't understand &quot;no.&quot;</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to the boys at the Carnival on the Carousel.)</p>
<p>(The children go round and round on the Carousel having a grand time. As best she can, she tries to keep an eye on them; however, when the horses come around, one of the kids is missing.)</p>
<p><strong>The Nanny</strong>: Jason! Jason, where's Isaiah? Jason! THE NANNY: Where's your brother?! Jason, where's your brother?!</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>The Nanny</strong>: He was right there. And then he ... I swear to you, I looked everywhere, but I knew he was gone. (sighs) So ... I brought the kids back here and had to tell Tavian.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: ... and his wife.</p>
<p><strong>The Nanny</strong>: (scoffs) They're not married. And even if they were, it'd still be Tavian's show.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: A woman who knows her employer.</p>
<p><strong>The Nanny</strong>: I should. He's my brother.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. HOTEL - TAVIAN TOMBS' ROOM - MAIN ROOM]</p>
<p>(The man with the ransom money arrives. The suitcase is open and on the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Tavian Tombs</strong>: It took you that long to pull the paper together?</p>
<p><strong>Man With Cap</strong>: Soft count room wouldn't go any faster.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The casino's fronting the ransom money?</p>
<p><strong>Hotel Manager</strong>: Mr. Tombs has a multimillion-dollar line of credit with us.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We strongly advise that you don't hand over that money.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: At least let us mark it.</p>
<p><strong>Tavian Tombs</strong>: You know how long it'd take to mark $5 million large? The kidnapper knows. Longer than the drop-off time. Now, the letter said corner of Telfair and Juniper. That's where this bag is going.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. HOTEL/CASINO -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and NICK process the crime scene. NICK is snapping photographs. Garbled radio transmissions can be heard in the background.)</p>
<p>(LOCKWOOD checks the SUV over.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM kneels next to the body and sprays the piece of wood with something.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sharp force trauma.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Shouldn't we get the spike out of his head before we try to get any prints off it?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm afraid if we try to remove it, we'll eradicate the prints.</p>
<p>(NICK takes more pictures. GRISSOM kneels even lower to look under the wooden spike.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm not going to get any prints off of this.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, he sure is dirty. I mean, he isn't homeless. This is his car, right?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah. I'm going to scrape his nails.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes the instrument and scrapes under the nails. He looks at it and sees small specks of something.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hand me a bindle.</p>
<p>(NICK hands GRISSOM the bindle. LOCKWOOD finds a gun in the car.)</p>
<p><strong>Lockwood</strong>: Hey, fellas, you're never going to guess what I found under the seat. A .38 special.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - PRINT LAB -- DAY]</p>
<p>(WARRICK is examining the ransom note under a magnifying glass. SARA walks in.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Catherine wanted to know if you have anything. She can't convince Tavian to change his mind about the ransom money.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: 8 x 11 plain white copy paper. It's mass-produced. You can get it anywhere. The envelope, unfortunately, is self-adhering.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No DNA.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What about the text? It's just standard laser, nondescript. So you got nothing. </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Nothing I can see.</p>
<p>(SARA picks up the note and smells it. She hands it to WARRICK to smell.)</p>
<p>(Cut to WARRICK putting the note inside a container. He closes the container and turns on the Evidence Vacuum Sweeper.)</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV flash to inside the container, through the vacuum vent, through the vacuum hose, through the filter and a close up of the particles caught inside. End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(WARRICK opens the filter and empties it out into another filter set-up. He washes it out, runs it through a filter, takes a sample of the liquid and runs the sample through a machine.)</p>
<p>(WARRICK opens the container. He sprays the paper and sees the fingerprints.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY]</p>
<p>(ROBBINS adjusts the camera and monitor to get a better view of the stake embedded in the body's head.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Looks like something out of Nosferatu.</p>
<p>(ROBBINS leans in to look at the stake.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, only the wooden stake is in his head, not his heart.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: I've never seen that before -- a wooden stake embedded in the high parietal scalp in the midline. Hold his head down firmly, will you?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM puts his hands on the body's head while ROBBINS gets a grip on the stake.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: On three. One ... two ... three!</p>
<p>(ROBBINS pulls out the wooden stake. He hands the stake to GRISSOM, then reaches into his pocket to put his glasses on. He leans down to look at the wound.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Irregular puncture defect to the scalp, laceration to the sagittal sinus. The wound track stops at the falx cerebri. No gross penetration of the cerebrum. That stake is what kept him driving.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Tamponading?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Well, the application of more than normal pressure to the wound acts like a plug, temporarily keeping him alive. The spike probably struck ...</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV of the stake embedding in the brain.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (V.O.) ... between the brain hemispheres ...</p>
<p>(End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: ... most likely lodging into the parietal bones and holding it in place. They say it's a game of inches -- a centimeter to the left or right, and he would have bled out and died instantly.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, but head trauma this severe, surgery would've probably killed him anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: That, or live an extra hour in excruciating pain.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI -- HALLWAY]</p>
<p>(WARRICK fills CATHERINE in on the findings of printing the ransom note. He hands the results to CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: They weren't lying. They all touched it. Everybody's who's got a piece of Tavian got a hand on that ransom note. Even the bellman and the desk clerk left prints on the envelope.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Any unidentified prints?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Just a few smudges, a couple of partials.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So prints don't help.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Liquid extraction results.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, that was detected on the ransom note-menthol and nicotine. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to the ransom note being printed out and the hand reaching for it holding a burning cigarette. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Nicotine. So we're looking for a smoker -- menthol smoker.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. CORNER OF TELFAIR AND JUNIPER - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(WARRICK and BRASS sit in the car and stake out the drop off site. Some distance away, they have a clear view of the money bag on the ground next to the bench.)</p>
<p>(A truck turns the corner.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (to radio) Everybody hold. We don't make a move until after he's taken the money.</p>
<p>(A man gets out of the truck and grabs a stack of newspapers. He opens the newspaper rack on the corner of the sidewalk and restocks it with newspapers. He doesn't go anywhere near the money and by all indications isn't even aware that it's there. He shoves the newspapers in the dispenser, closes the hatch and leaves.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (to radio) Stand down.</p>
<p>(The truck drives off.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We're way past the drop time here.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah. Well, let's give it a couple more.</p>
<p>(They both look outside. The money bag is still there.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, what's your take on this? Inside or outside job?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No, I think it's just some freak with a nicotine habit and access to a laser printer.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Did you see the action he got? One phone call, $5 million gets delivered to his hotel?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, that money's not doing him any good now, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(Another man approaches the money. It's Tavian's Head of Security.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It's just gone bad.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, man.</p>
<p>(BRASS and WARRICK both get out of the car. Other officers with weapons drawn are already on their way to intercept the man.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey! Hey!</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (to the Security guy) What are you doing? (to the officers) Put the guns down! Put the guns down!</p>
<p>(BRASS and WARRICK reach the Security Man.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong>: Tavian wanted me to be sure the transfer got done.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: This is our job -- not yours, not Tavian's.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What are you concerned about here -- the kid or your job?</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong>: I didn't do nothing. Nobody took the money -- didn't even show. I've been here all night just like you.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: They spotted you. You understand? The kidnappers saw you. They made us.</p>
<p>(BRASS' cell phone rings. He turns and walks away to answer it.)</p>
<p><strong>Security</strong>: I was doing what Tavian asked me to, man.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (to phone) Brass.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. DUMP SITE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(BRASS, CATHERINE and WARRICK walk toward the little boy's body.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It's him. I'll take the perimeter.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Body's in an unnatural position.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Maybe this is only the dump site.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: His body's also coated. Makes me think whoever did this didn't even stop the car. </p>

<p>(Quick flashback to JACOB PRICE grabbing a pill bottle from the cabinet. In the background, ISAIAH sits on the ground tied with the piece of rope, struggling with his bonds. Cut to JACOB PRICE with ISAIAH. End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Now, drugs have a different effect on adults than on children. It's called &quot;The Paradoxical Effect.&quot; So, when the tranquilizers weren't working, this guy- Price -- upped the dosage. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to ISAIAH still struggling with the rope after taking the tranquilizers. JACOB PRICE heads back to the cabinet to get more pills. Cut to JACOB PRICE struggling with ISAIAH. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Now, as a father, I can understand why you'd want this guy dead ...</p>
<p><strong>Tavian Tombs</strong>: (confused) What? Whoa. You think I killed him?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: TAVIAN TOMBS swinging the shovel and hitting JACOB PRICE on the head. JACOB PRICE falls to the ground. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Smells like trinitrotoluene.</p>
<p>(They cough some more. GRISSOM picks up a couple of pieces of wood.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Look familiar?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah. But how did it get in the back of the guy's head?</p>

<p><strong>Joe McPherson</strong>: (accusing) You scammed me!</p>
<p><strong>Alex James</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Joe McPherson</strong>: That was my life savings!</p>
<p><strong>Alex James</strong>: Take it easy. Listen, now-now, now, lookit. I-I, I can explain everything, all right? Listen, Joe. Joe, come on, I-I sold you the wrong mine. I-it's an honest mistake.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, Tavian was paying Bridget child support -- three grand a month.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Three grand a month? Tavian tombs has been a $12 million-a-year player for eight seasons, not including endorsements.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, he made his deal with Bridget when Tramelle was born. Bad timing for her.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Motive for us. She was right to assume that Tavian would immediately pay that ransom. What's five million to a guy who makes hundreds of millions?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And it is his son. I'm sure he would have paid any amount. So, how does that dog kennel guy Price figure into all this, and was killing him part of the plan?</p>

<p><strong>Tavian</strong>: Come here.</p>
<p>(He kneels down and hugs his son. The two stay like that for a moment. Behind him, ISAIAH'S MOTHER also welcomes TRAMELLE.)</p>

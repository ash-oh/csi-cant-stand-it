Grissom: Little People Convention. Every year they come from all over the world to a designated city. Socialize, network. It's their Prom, Olympics, and New Year's Eve all rolled into one.


Nick: Oh, hey. Excuse me.
Man In The Wheelchair: Don't think so, square jaw.

Sara: Grissom, how do you know this?
Grissom: I get the newsletter.



Brass: Lawrence Ames, clothing salesman from phoenix. He's 35, four foot, five inches tall. 

Brass: One of the, uh, convention organizers found him. She was checking out the stage. There's a fashion show tomorrow if you're interested. She looked up and saw him.

Sara: Guy does a suicide in a public place. He was trying to make a statement.
Grissom: Suicide?
Sara: It's a reasonable suspicion.
Nick: Suicide among any disability group is above average.
Grissom: Being a dwarf doesn't mean you're disabled, Nick. It means you're ... short. 

Grissom: I think we've got a little murder.
HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS





Det. Drew Wolf: My favorite CSI. I was hoping you'd get the call out.
Catherine: Look who's back in town? So, what happened, Drew? You didn't like ... Idaho? Is that it?
Det. Drew Wolf: Had everything but you.

Catherine: Yeah, right. So, what have we got?
Det. Drew Wolf: One body, male caucasian. Looks like a home invasion. Listen, I'm headed next door. I'm going to talk to a neighbor who heard shouting, called 9-1-1. Keep me posted?
Catherine: Always did.




Catherine: Hi.

Catherine: Willows. 
Catherine: You clear the place?
FIRST OFFICER CLARK: Just finishing.
Catherine: Okay.


Catherine: Yeah?  Okay. Cool.

FIRST OFFICER CLARK: We were just pulling out of the chili place when dispatch radio, uh, arrived on the scene at 1900 hours. My partner secured the perimeter. I've been in here ...
Catherine: This your first time on body watch?

Catherine: Well ... alive ... it's inside your bowels. Dead, it ends up on the floor.


Catherine: Go. Go, go, go. Just get some air.




Catherine:  Suspect on location! Suspect on location!

Officer: In here!


Catherine: Out back.
Warrick: Catherine, are you all right?

Catherine: He went out back.  I'm all right. I'm okay.




Warrick: He must have gotten out the back window.

Warrick:  You the First Officer on the scene? 

Warrick: When you clear a place you clear it, do you understand?
FIRST OFFICER CLARK: Yes, sir, I'm sorry.
Warrick: We lost a CSI two years ago because of the same mistake!

Catherine: Warrick ... ease up. My fault. I sent him out.
Warrick:  Use your radio and call for backup.

Warrick:  Hey ... 
Catherine: Hey. 
Warrick: Are you okay?
Catherine: Yeah. I'm all right.

Catherine: Don't touch me. 

Catherine: I'm evidence.




Sara: I got some fibers here. Possibly secondary. 
Nick: This rope was identical to the rope around the victim's neck. It's used as a hand rail. 
Grissom: Wait, David. Got a hair in the knot.

Sara: Killer's in the rope. 
Grissom: I want to preserve this as is, so cut higher.
David Phillips: Yes, sir.





Catherine: Hey, um, hand me a swab, would you? 
Warrick: You know I could do this for you. CATHERINE: Not going to hurt any less.

Warrick: That cut is deep.

Catherine: Damn.

Catherine: All right, um, hey, uh, turn around.
Warrick: Huh?
Catherine: Privacy. 

Catherine: The guy bodied me full-on. I don't want trace to miss one hair or one fiber.

Warrick: You decent? 

Warrick: Looks like we're up.





Grissom: These scars are old. Tell me this wasn't bone-lengthening surgery. ROBBINS: Probably done when he was a teenager. Surgical pins are inserted into the bone ... 

Robbins:  ... and linked to an external screw. Turn the screw, it cracks the bones. Osteogenic cells flood in.

Robbins: Callus forms to bridge the gap. The fractures heal and the bone gets longer. You have to break the bones every four to six hours a quarter millimeter at a time. Excruciating pain ... for an extra few inches.
Grissom: What people will endure to be normal. 
Robbins: &quot;What fools these mortals be.&quot;
Grissom: Hmm.
Robbins: So ... 
Grissom: Hanging?
Robbins: At least. C.O.D. was asphyxiation due to strangulation. Give me a hand here. 

Robbins: Bruise behind the ear is characteristic of a hanging.

Robbins: This bruise is not.
Grissom: What is that, blunt force?
Robbins: Take a look at this. 

Robbins: Separation of the first and second vertebrae prior to death.
Grissom: He was paralyzed?
Robbins: That's something that would only happen to a dwarf with pseudoachondroplasia. Physiology can make for cervical spine instability.
Grissom: So it's possible that whoever did this knew something about dwarf anatomy.


Robbins: Hmmm ...





Catherine: Suspect on location! 
Catherine: He was drinking. 

Catherine: It was beer. Warrick: I'll go process the back. 








Catherine: Denim fiber from the cabinet. Could be nothing. And lots of smudges but no prints worthwhile.
Warrick: Yeah, I didn't get any prints either but I did get a partial shoe tread from the back gate. And I don't think our dead guy lived here.
Catherine: Based on ...?

Warrick: These pictures. Got Detective Wolf looking for the homeowner's name from the real estate records.
Catherine: So, our home invasion robbery may be not a home invasion after all.





Sara: So, would you mind if we tape-lifted your shirt? Combed your hair for evidence?
Melanie Grace: Evidence of what?
Sara: Well, the first person at a crime scene often turns out to be a viable suspect. 
Melanie Grace: I'm the one the found his body. I'm the one that called it in. SARA: If you're innocent it'll, rule you out.

Melanie Grace: Go ahead.

Melanie Grace: Does he ever talk?
Sara: Yeah. At, uh, random intervals.
Grissom: I was admiring your reaching tool.
Melanie Grace: I have one I use to wipe my tush with. Would you like to take a look at that, too?

Grissom: Hey, if the world doesn't adapt itself to you, you have to adapt yourself to it, right?
Melanie Grace: Yeah. You know, you probably think I'm cold. Pulling slots after I found Lawrence up there. This is the convention. Everything moves at warp speed.
Sara: I'm done. Thank you.

Melanie Grace: You know, fifty-one weeks in your hometown with nothing but average-sized people. I have to fit a lifetime into this week. We all do. Business connections, gambling, romance.
Grissom: Excuse me. Did Lawrence have any problems in those areas?
Melanie Grace: Romance? Not at all. Lawrence was a pseudo. He could have his pick of any girl in here.

Sara: What's a pseudo? GRISSOM: Dwarfs with pseudoachondroplasia have features and head size like normal people. Dwarfs with achondroplasia have shortened limbs and enlarged heads. 
Sara: Different types of dwarfs, different social status? GRISSOM: Hey ... discrimination isn't just for tall people. 




Grissom: Excuse me.

Grissom: Isn't this, uh, Lawrence Ames's room?
Jessica Marcus: Yes.
Grissom: Who are you?

Jessica Marcus: I'm his fiancée. We always got those looks. I'm five-seven, in case you were wondering.
Sara: Our concern isn't your height; it's your proximity. You're standing in a potential crime scene.

Grissom: Would you please sit down here? We want to keep the contamination to a minimum.

Sara:  This is CSI Sidle. We need a uniform in room 312 right away. Thanks.

Grissom: Didn't the police tell you not to come in here?
Jessica Marcus: Yes. But I wanted to be near Lawrence's things.
Grissom: And, um... these are Lawrence's things?
Jessica Marcus: Yes.

Grissom: Sara?
Sara: Yeah?

Sara: Gouge is deeper at the bottom than the top.
Grissom: So the strike was made coming down.

Sara: Grissom.

Sara: Did you and Mr. Ames have an argument, say last night?
Jessica Marcus: No.

Jessica Marcus: You don't believe me?

Grissom: Well, right now, we believe the evidence.







Catherine: What are the marks on his forearms? 

David Phillips: Hmm, can't say. But I do know that Teddy Henders died from blunt force trauma. 
Warrick: From what, do you think? A hammer, butt of a gun? DAVID PHILLIPS: I was just going to see if I could figure that out. 
Catherine: &quot;Z&quot;?

Catherine: There was a z-mover video game on the floor next to the vic. Murder by z-mover.
Warrick: The neighbors heard shouting. Two guys break and enter and get into some kind of an alternation.

Catherine: One ends up killing the other.
David Phillips: And almost Catherine. 

David Phillips: That had to be scary, huh?
Catherine:  I didn't have time to be scared, David.

David Phillips: Oh.






Grissom: Is the lipstick on this champagne glass yours?
Jessica Marcus: No champagne for me. I'm ... pregnant. Only seven weeks. SARA: Is this your computer, or Lawrence's?
Jessica Marcus: Lawrence's.
Sara: We're going to have to take it with us.





Warrick: Cath? You all right? 
Warrick: Don't let him get to you like that.
Catherine: I was scared ... and I still am. 

Catherine: Don't tell anyone, okay.



Nick: Hey, Greg. GREG: Hey. NICK: Get anything off the rope? GREG: Yeah, a few brown hairs around the knot. Only one with a skin tag, though. And those fibers that Sara found on the body? NICK: Yeah? GREG: Polyester upholstery. Cheap rugs and tacky furniture.

Grissom: I need these hairs.
Greg: Uh, uh, no DNA tags on those.
Grissom: Doesn't matter.

Greg:  You know, I hate it when he does that. I like to make a presentation, you know?

Nick: So, present.
Greg: Eh, forget it. Scope's interesting.

Nick: All right, fresh epithelials.
Greg: Yeah, I found them on the rope near the anchor point. A minuscule sample, but useable.
Nick: How long for DNA?
Greg: Well, give me something to compare it to. Get me the fiancée's blood.
Nick: Well, I can't just give you her blood. That takes a court order.
Greg: I'm open 24 hours.




Sara:  &quot;Met you in a pseudo chat room. Do you remember me?&quot; &quot;I remember you.&quot;

Sara: Jessica, you knew Lawrence was having an on-line affair with another woman didn't you?
Brass: You logged on at times when Lawrence was at work. We checked his work records.
Jessica Marcus: A lot of girls liked Lawrence. He was funny and smart and sweet.
Sara: Danielle was different. She was his size. She was ... perfect.
Nick: We found your skin cells on the rope that hung Lawrence.
Jessica Marcus: You're making that up.
Nick: No, I'm not.
Brass: Our court order ... your blood.
Jessica Marcus: I did not put a noose around my fiancé's neck.
Nick: Then explain how your skin cells got on the rope.
Jessica Marcus: I can't.





Sara: Hey. Confronted the fiancée; she stonewalled us.
Nick: Brass told her not to leave town. 
 
Nick: He sounded a bit like Jack Lord, don't you think? 

Grissom: Well, she can go wherever she wants to. She didn't do it. Take a look. Hair from the knot.

Sara: They look thin.
Grissom: Diameter's 60% less than normal. Tensile strength is also way below normal.
Nick: You have a cross section?
Grissom:  Mm-hmm.

Nick: Hmm. No pigment at the central core. No color.
Grissom: Cartilage Hair Hypoplasia. C.H.H. It's characterized by fine, brittle body hair. It's an extremely rare syndrome. It's a form of Dwarfism.
Nick: Okay. So, back to the midgets.

Grissom: Nick ... &quot;Dwarfs&quot; or &quot;Little People&quot;.

Grissom: You'll need to know what to look for. So, I'll put together a list of C.H.H. Attributes.
Nick: Well, you better do it fast. The convention's over in two days. After that, the &quot;Little People&quot; go home and we lose all our suspects.




;










Melanie Grace: I'm sorry, I don't recognize her and a girl this pretty I would remember. The guys would still be drooling.
Grissom: Well, according to the police, there's none named Danielle registered at the hotel or at the convention.
Melanie Grace: You expected an internet handle to be a real name?  Maybe the girl got cold feet. My first IOLP convention -- I walk in, see 200 Dwarfs staring back at me and what goes through my head? &quot;There's no way I look like these people.&quot; I ran.
Grissom: But you went back. MELANIE GRACE: Eventually. I guess I realized it's nice to see eye-to-eye with someone.
Grissom: Mm. MELANIE GRACE: I get the impression that's a little tough for you. &quot;The freaks have looked at her in a secret way and tried to connect their eyes with hers as though to say, we know who you are. We are you.'&quot; 
Grissom: Faulkner.
Melanie Grace: Close. Another southern writer. Carson McCullers.
Grissom: I think we look for the differences in each other to prove that we're not alone.
Melanie Grace: What's yours? Your difference?  Mine's the worst. Random gene. Anyone can have a dwarf. Sometimes I've even seen terror in average-size people's eyes. I remind them that their little carbon copies might not be such a copy after all.
Grissom: Well, mine's genetic, progressive and impossible to predict.
Melanie Grace: And hard to notice ... unless you tell someone.





Catherine: Got your beep. What'd you get? Warrick: Denim fibers at 400x. 
Warrick: The skin from the dead guy and the denim found in the cabinet were both coated in the same substance. 
 CATHERINE: You get a breakdown?
Warrick: Yeah, partially hydrogenated soy bean oil, traces of beef fat, sugar and potato starch.
Catherine: Cooking grease.
Warrick: That would explain the marks on the guy's forearms. Grease burns.

Catherine: So there's a good chance the victim worked in a fast food joint.

Det. Drew Wolf: I got a feeling they both did. The owner of the house has a franchise of fast food places. Uh, fast and fresh burgers. I just got off the phone with him from Hawaii. Alvin Jackson. Three stores in the Vegas area. And he's on his yearly vacation.
Catherine: Something his employees would definitely know. Get any addresses?
Det. Drew Wolf: You bet. 
Warrick: Let's go check it out.




Sara: We're looking for anything in the picture that might give us a way to find her. Something in the background that determines location a useful reflection, anything.

Archie Johnson: Huh ... oh, I get it. This is like a test, right?
Sara: What do you mean? ARCHIE JOHNSON: Individual hair shadows are amorphous when they should be distinct. 

Archie Johnson: In these two areas -- here and here-- they're on the same focal plane but this one's sharp and this one's fuzzy.
Sara: This picture's a fake?
Archie Johnson: A composite. A very good one.




Grissom: This explains why nobody ever saw her. She only exists in pixels. Nat King Cole.
Sara: Excuse me?
Grissom: Archie would you separate the composite elements, please?
Archie Johnson: Yup.

Archie Johnson: The image was built out of these.
Grissom: Now if you could, pull up a photo of the victim, gray scale. There's a theory in art that the Mona Lisa was really a feminized version of Leonardo Da Vinci himself. 
Sara: Concept suggests ... Deep down we're all narcissists?
Grissom: Yeah. What attracts us the most is ourselves.
Sara:  Scale to match the original picture with Danielle.

Sara: Danielle is a virtual woman created to attract and lure Lawrence Ames ... away from his fiancée, maybe?
Brass: Boy, do I have good timing, or what? I did a little checking with the phone company. In the past year, Lawrence Ames received over two hundred calls from Melanie Grace.
Sara: The same woman that found him dead.
Brass: He got call-blocking against her two months ago.
Sara: Well, that's interesting. That's the same time Danielle started sending him instant messages.




Melanie Grace: Yes, I called Lawrence. We met in a chat room. He also called me. Did you look at my phone records? BRASS: He eventually blocked your calls. The same week he got engaged to Jessica Marcus. 
Grissom: It was at that time he began receiving messages from ... a perfect woman ... 

Grissom: ...who doesn't really exist.
Melanie Grace: You think that I would do that? Present myself to a man as anything other than who I am?
Brass: If it would break up his new engagement. So what happened? You went to the convention you saw him with his tall girlfriend and you go to plan B?
Melanie Grace:  You think I'm capable of that? Killing because a woman has some height on me? Pretending to be an ideal ... if you think that ... then I was wrong about you.




Nick: Hey. Do you mind, little man? I'm trying to work here. Man In The Wheelchair: Really? NICK: Yeah. Man In The Wheelchair: You making any progress, CSI man? NICK: Some. Man In The Wheelchair: Uh-huh. Are we getting your A-game or your B-game?

Nick: Come again? Man In The Wheelchair: You see us little people we're used to getting the short end of the stick.  You don't get to laugh at that. 

Man In The Wheelchair: What I want to know is are you treating this like a case or like a joke?
Nick: Well, a man was killed; that's no joke. 

Nick: 
Man In The Wheelchair: Carry on. 
Kevin Marcus: This is very easy to articulate. Comes in several different colors. You will enjoy this very, very much ...




Greg: Uh, Grissom. 

Greg: There's, uh, something weird going on with the hairs from the ropes. Well, not weird. More like... hair-raising.

Greg: Sorry, bad one. Um, okay, at first I thought that maybe I was doing something wrong -- running too many DNA samples, you know seeing things. GRISSOM: Greg?

Greg: Uh, the dwarf hair has seven alleles in common with Jessica Marcus's skin cells.

Grissom: The two donors are related?
Greg: Profiles say so.

Grissom: Grissom.



Nick: He looked like he fit your profile. So, I asked around. Two little people confirmed he has C.H.H.
Brass: Okay, thank you.

Brass: Kevin Marcus?
Kevin Marcus: Buying or browsing? 
Brass: Maybe a little bit of both. 
Grissom: Rope for makeshift banisters, huh? 
Kevin Marcus: That rag rope ... cuts the hands. Now you feel this nylon. Go ahead feel that. 

Kevin Marcus: I do trade shows mail order ... I even sold to this convention.

Grissom: So what do you, buy from wholesalers and then repackage in your home? KEVIN MARCUS: Yeah, Chicago. BRASS: Well, that explains how your daughter's skin cells got all over the rope that hung Lawrence Ames. GRISSOM: Your daughter's name is Jessica, right? 
Brass: The lab also found your hair all over that rope.
Kevin Marcus: Well, I touch all the merchandise.
Brass: Nice try, Kev. They hair was caught in the noose.




Nick: Did you know your father killed Lawrence?
Jessica Marcus: That's what they told me, but I couldn't believe it. I still can't.



Brass: So you created Danielle to break up your daughter's engagement.
Kevin Marcus: That's an interesting theory. 

Kevin Marcus: What? You guys trace an online account to my credit card or something like that? Oh, no, wait. Um, I use a free ISP. That means no name, no trail, no case.

Grissom: Mr. Marcus, in your business you deal with proportions, correct? You provide Little People with what they need to compensate for their proportions and to live with them. You know what Little People aspire to be. Your, uh, logo is interesting.

Grissom: Da Vinci's &quot;Vitruvian Man.&quot; In the perfect human form, arm span equals height. You're very aware of what, uh people are looking for in a mate aren't you?



Jessica Marcus: The night before he died, Lawrence and I had a fight about Danielle.

Jessica Marcus: Are still in contact with her?
Lawrence Ames: She e-mails or IM's. I don't answer. I love you.

Jessica Marcus: You're cheating on me!

Jessica Marcus: And I ran out of the house and I went to my dad. I was crying and he told me to leave Lawrence but I couldn't because ... I ... I loved him. And I'm having our baby. And I went back to our room and we made up. 

Jessica Marcus: And the next night ... he said he was going out to meet a friend.

Lawrence Ames: I'll be back in an hour, babe.

Jessica Marcus: And he never came back.




Brass: So, what'd you have against the guy?
Kevin Marcus: What are you, blind? He was a dwarf. My wife and I ... Our daughter ... a Genetic Miracle. One-in-four shot she'd be an average. And she was a beautiful average. 
Grissom: So your wife is also a dwarf.
Kevin Marcus: Yeah. Jessica didn't have to fight the world every day, like we did. We freed her from all that. But that little b*st*rd kept dragging her right back down into it.
Brass: So you killed him.
Kevin Marcus: I said I didn't like the guy. I didn't kill anybody.

Brass: Can we prove it?
Grissom: Not yet. The rope was anchored to the lighting truss which was at least five feet over his head.
Brass: So?

Grissom: He can barely lift his arms above his shoulders. He suffers from Lumbar Lordosis Swayback ... which is typical of C.H.H. And it limits his mobility even more.
Brass: Hey, the guy put a rope around the victim's neck.
Grissom: Yeah, but how did he hang him?









Det. Drew Wolf: Listen, Catherine. Me and Warrick can handle this. 
Catherine: I'm going in. Warrick: Well, the guy assaulted you. You don't have to put yourself through this, you know. CATHERINE: I don't, I'll be scared of the next guy and the one after that.




Warrick: Shoe tread, denim fiber, a lot of cooking grease. Based on that evidence, they all did it.

Det. Drew Wolf: All right, so we take them one by one.
Catherine: Transfer works both ways.

Catherine: Warrick?

Catherine: Blow your nose.
Young Man: I don't gotta.


Catherine: Guess.


Dwayne Gallo: I don't think so.

Catherine: Then I guess I'll just have to look for myself. 
Dwayne Gallo: You want to look at my boogers, Lady, go ahead.

Warrick: Hey! 

Catherine: Nose hairs ... are nature's filter. Traps all kinds of things. Dust, dirt ... 

Catherine: ... fingerprint powder.

Catherine: You did it.

Catherine: You inhaled the fingerprint dust I was using.

Dwayne Gallo: We went up there to party 'cause the boss was out of town and I saw the z-mover first 

Dwayne Gallo: ... but Teddy ... Teddy ...

Teddy Henders: Sweet ... z-mover ...

Dwayne Gallo: I saw it first.
Teddy Henders: What? ...

Dwayne Gallo: I saw it first. 
Teddy Henders: It's mine. 
Dwayne Gallo: I saw it first.
Teddy Henders: I called it.
Dwayne Gallo: You want it, you b*st*rd?!

Dwayne Gallo: I didn't mean to kill him. It was an accident. I mean, I ... 
Officer: Get up.
Dwayne Gallo: I didn't mean ... 

Det. Drew Wolf: You all right?
Catherine: Yeah.




Nick: Hey, did you get anything else off that laptop?
Sara: No, a bunch of the files were corrupted. Archie's taking another run at them.

Nick: Victim was paralyzed, couldn't fight back. Kevin Marcus puts the rope around his neck makes a slip knot.
Sara: And ties off the other end on the truss even though there is no way he could have reached it.
Nick: No way he could've reached it.

Sara: Nick, what are you doing?
Nick: Changing my perspective.

Nick:  Oh, man. Can you imagine going through life at this height?

Sara: They do okay. If the world doesn't adapt itself to you, you ...
Nick: ... adapt yourself to it.



Nick: Where's Grissom?





Sara: Grissom?

Nick: We know how he did it.




Brass: Your wheelchair was in the booth at the convention. The fibers from the seat cover to your wheelchair match the fibers we found on the victim. Uh, faux, fake sheepskin.

Brass: We also know how you got Mr. Ames into the theater.

Grissom: Our lab retrieved a final instant message to Lawrence from Danielle.

Lawrence Ames: Mr. Marcus, what are you doing here? 
Brass: It's enough to convict you. GRISSOM: May I ask a question? How did you get him into the wheelchair? 
Kevin Marcus: Well ... I appealed to his vanity. I told him I needed a brochure model to sell my new chair.

Lawrence Ames: You don't want me near your daughter but you want me to hawk your chairs?
Kevin Marcus: I never said you weren't handsome. I mean, come on -- your face, your build -- a million chairs, &quot;sold.&quot;

Kevin Marcus: Great, come on. Hop in. Hop in, let me see you in there. Come on. Model for me. 

Kevin Marcus: There you go. Wait, let me make an adjustment for you, here.

Kevin Marcus:  I paralyzed him.


Kevin Marcus: I couldn't let Jessica marry him.  Any kid they have ... a fifty percent chance it would be a dwarf. You have to understand that.

Grissom: It's genetics.
Brass: Mr. Marcus, I think you should know ... your daughter is already pregnant by Lawrence Ames.


SCENE #37


Grissom: You know what's really sad? This wasn't just a murder. It was a hate crime. 
 
Grissom: Kevin Marcus hated himself.





Signing Student :  It's nice to see you.
Signing Student :  Where are you going?
Grissom: 
Signing Student :  I think I should tell the teacher that you're a trouble-maker.
Grissom:  No. See you around.
Signing Student :  Take care of yourself.

[EXT. DESERT - DAY]</p>
<p>(The camera shutter clicks as WARRICK takes a photo of the crime scene. In front of him, GRISSOM kneels over the body while NICK stands behind him watching.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Maggots. This kid's been here awhile. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns the body over to its side. WARRICK continues to photograph the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No gunshot wounds. No stab marks. No signs of strangulation.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It's a long way out in the sticks just to drop dead.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM stands up and looks around.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (sighs) Not if you're being chased. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM starts to walk around to look at the ground around the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Look at the foot patterns leading up to the body. See the strides? This kid was running. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM kneels down by a footprint impression in the dirt.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: See the left foot impression? It's straight; that's normal. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at the next print.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: But look at the right foot impression. It's turned outward. Almost<br />
90 degrees.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: He was looking over his shoulder when he was running. Think there was somebody else here?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Based on these prints, it's hard to tell.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (to the OFFICER) Can I get this taped off here?</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM kneels down back at the body and looks at it again.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So you want to call it? How do you think he died?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Fear. (beat) Someone chased this kid to death.</p>

[INT. CSI - GRISSOM'S OFFICE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM'S working in his darkened office. He adjusts the overhead lamp, then writes something down. He's working on an experiment. He as a pan with a piece of paper in some kind of liquid with the different colored light above it.)</p>
<p>(He again adjusts the light and checks the meter reading.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM'S phone rings. He answers it.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to phone) Grissom. (pause) No. (pause) No, yes, I did. Thank you.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM hangs the phone up and puts it down on the table beside him. He goes back to his experiment.)</p>
<p>(Someone knocks on the door lightly and it opens. CATHERINE and WARRICK walks in. They glance around in the darkened office looking for GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, you want to give us our assignments or do you want us to take... the night off?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM adjusts the light again.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (irritated) Paperwork, paper clips, paper-punchers -- all these people want me to do is push paper; nobody wants me to solve crimes.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, (shrugs) ... you could've turned the job down.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, the grass is always greener, Catherine.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM adjusts the light again, not making a move to get up.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE waits a moment, then reaches out to help him.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well let's just hurry this up.</p>
<p>(She grabs the lamp and pulls it down into the pan below. It immediately catches fire.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You really want to see flash paper flash? Walk in on a bookie.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's what this was about-- bookies.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM'S phone rings again. CATHERINE turns and walks over to GRISSOM'S desk.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Don't answer it. </p>
<p>(She grabs the assignment sheets off of the desk and hands them to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We've got work to do ... boss.</p>
<p>(The phone continues to ring. GRISSOM grabs the assignments from CATHERINE and follows them out of the office. He hangs the phone up and tosses it on the table as he leaves.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Walking through the hallway, GRISSOM hands out the assignments.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Warrick, you and I are on the four-nineteen -- our dead body in the desert. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM hands the assignment sheet to WARRICK. He takes it.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sara, dead body of your own. Dumpsite out near Henderson.</p>
<p>(SARA takes the assignment sheet from GRISSOM and looks at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Oh, I'll dress down.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Catherine, Verbum Dei Charter School. Four-twenty homicide. The school dean was killed in his office. Suspect called it in; could be self-defense.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE takes the sheet. She and SARA continue down one hallway, while GRISSOM stops at the intersection.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Did some kid off him with a silver spoon?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (calls back) Suspect's not a kid. It's the woman who founded the school. Take Nicky with you.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p>(NICK rushes out from the room and into the hallway. He catches up with CATHERINE and SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Here I am.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You're coming with me.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE holds out the assignment sheet to NICK. He grabs it and looks at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Glad you could make it.</p>
<p>(NICK stares at SARA. SARA grins back at NICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'm outta here. Good luck tonight, you guys.</p>
<p>NICK See you.</p>

[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(DR. JENNA WILLIAMS goes over the boy's body with GRISSOM and WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Can't make a ruling? Look at the bruise marks on John Doe here. I call that suffocation.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Jenna Williams</strong>: Not necessarily. It could be the result of his face impacting the ground at expiration.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'm going to take a mouth swab.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Jenna Williams</strong>: Go ahead. Grissom, I have something to show you. </p>
<p>(DR. WILLIAMS leads GRISSOM to the counter off to the side of the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Jenna Williams</strong>: You know, when a kid this young drops dead smart money chases anesthetics, alcohol methanol, maybe even a little freon. </p>
<p>(WARRICK takes the swab sample of the mouth.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Jenna Williams</strong>: I got to be honest. I've had a lot of dead bodies from the desert and when they're out there too long the elements tend to eat away the evidence. My opinion is ... (she gestures down at the body) ... you are looking at the picture of health, internally. Externally, it's another matter.</p>
<p>(She motions to the scope on the counter.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Jenna Williams</strong>: Skin sample.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks through the scope.)</p>
<p>[SCOPE VIEW of the skin.]</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (o.s.) This kid was dry as a bone.</p>
<p>(He straightens and looks at DR. WILLIAMS.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: From exposure?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Jenna Williams</strong>: Skin's not consistent with elemental damage. (stumped)<br />
Warrick told me what you said about the cause of death being fear. I never read about that in any medical book.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Try the Forensic Medical Journal. Read the four canons on the cause of death: Homicide, suicide, natural and unexplained. Talks about fear in the last part of &quot;unexplained.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Jenna Williams</strong>: (to WARRICK) I had to ask.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You want to know what killed this kid? Benihana the maggots.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What the maggots?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Tox the maggots we found on the victim. Whatever he ingested has probably evaporated from the sun. But the maggots are like little refrigerators. They preserve what we digest for longer periods of time.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Entomology is our friend.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - DNA/CHEM LAB - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Extreme close up of a maggot in the grip of a forceps. Camera refocuses and we see WARRICK is staring at the maggot.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (to the maggot) Sorry, little buddy. </p>
<p>(WARRICK puts the maggot down on the table. He holds out his hand like a surgeon about to perform surgery.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Scalpel.</p>
<p>(GREG sits in the chair next to him and hands WARRICK the scalpel.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: My name is Paul and this is between y'all.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Talk about pulp fiction. </p>
<p>(WARRICK chops the little maggot into maggot pieces and puts it in the mortar. He steps aside and motions to GREG.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It's all yours, doc. </p>
<p>(GREG stands and smashes the maggot pieces into maggot mush.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Fire up that gas chromatograph mass spectrometer thing, will you?</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: No problem, son. </p>
<p>(GREG takes a sample and tests it.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Fifteen seconds till pay dirt.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Play any pigskin, man?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No, I'm off that. </p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: It's prime time for you.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I haven't made a bet in a month. I can't say I don't have that itch, though.</p>
<p>(The machine beeps and the results print out. GREG grabs it and looks it over.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Hmm. Haven't seen this stuff for a while.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What's that?</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Jimsonweed.</p>

<p>(SARA walks up into the alley past the coroner's van. She walks up to the DETECTIVE on the case and puts her kit down on the ground.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (motions to the dumpster) Do you have a name?</p>
<p><strong>Det. Evans</strong>: She's not exactly carrying a purse.</p>
<p>(He helps SARA step up to the dumpster. SARA looks inside and sees the woman's body wrapped in plastic. She snaps some photos.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Oh ... (camera shutter clicking) okay, let's take her out. </p>
<p>(DETECTIVE EVANS helps SARA down.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Thanks.</p>

[EXT. ALLEYWAY -- DUMPSTER - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(SARA removes the plastic from the woman's face. She presses her index finger into the woman's cheek and looks at the stuff on her finger.)</p>
<p>(Camera zooms in for an extreme close up to show the clear gell-like substance.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: That's strange.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Evans</strong>: What's that?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Glazed like a doughnut.</p>

[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(DAVID PHILLIPS explains the findings to SARA as they walk into the autopsy area.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Well, here's the reason the skin was funny.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Formaldehyde, right?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Close. Biotone arterial. Promotes high diffusion and fast drainage in skin tissue.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So I was right. This woman's been embalmed.</p>
<p>(SARA takes the seat in front of the monitor.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Yeah. Yeah, I already ran her prints through work here. Got an I.D. right here.</p>
<p>(SARA works on the computer and the computer beeps.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: (flusters) I, uh, I just want to say I-I ... well, I really admire the gusto with which you approach your job.</p>
<p>(DAVID walks around and stands in front of SARA. He smiles.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (glances from the monitor to DAVID) Are you hitting on me, David?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Uh ...</p>
<p>(DAVID smiles and looks down at his shoes bashfully. SARA is flattered.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Let me give you some friendly advice. If you want to pull chicks, you've got to get aggressive. You've gotta drop the glasses, lose the coat grow some scruff. </p>
<p>(DAVID appears quietly dejected at the advice.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (smiles) You do get a &quot;C&quot; for cute, though.</p>
<p>(DAVID glances back up at SARA, sees her smile and smiles back at her.)</p>
<p>(SARA turns back to the computer. The ID information appears on the monitor.)</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Kane</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What do you got?</p>
<p>(DET. KANE looks at his notes.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. Kane</strong>: Vernon Woods, Dean of the school. Forty-nine, single. Multiple blunt-force trauma wounds to the head.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: With that, probably.</p>
<p>(Next to the body is a bloodied object.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I got it. Man, check out all that blood spatter.</p>
<p>(Camera pans around the room to show the bloodied walls. The camera also lingers on the blood spatter across a Teacher's award.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah. Blows to the head, up close and personal. A lot of passion around this one. (to the DETECTIVE) How about the suspect?</p>
<p><strong>Det. Kane</strong>: Kate Armstrong. Founded the school. She called 9-1-1 herself. She says he attacked her. She's out in the hallway.</p>

<p>(CATHERINE interviews KATE ARMSTRONG.)</p>
<p><strong>Kate Armstrong</strong>: He wouldn't let go of me. He kept pawing. I can still smell his aftershave. (sobbing) I mean ... it's all a blur. I grabbed the closest thing I could and I hit him with it.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: A rock?</p>
<p><strong>Kate Armstrong</strong>: I don't know what it was. I didn't care. I just wanted him off of me.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: How many times did you hit him?</p>
<p><strong>Kate Armstrong</strong>: Once.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Inside Dean VERNON WOODS' office, he has KATE ARMSTRONG in his arms. She struggles against him.)</p>
<p><strong>Vernon Woods</strong>: What's the matter? Come on. No one's going to hear. Everyone's in class. Where's the harm?</p>
<p>(KATE looks down on the desk and grabs the rock.)</p>
<p><strong>Kate Armstrong</strong>: I said get off of me!</p>
<p>(She hits him on the forehead and he lets her go.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Miss Armstrong ... were you and the Dean having a personal relationship?</p>
<p><strong>Kate Armstrong</strong>: No. No. Vernon's a pig.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Then why did you hire him? You founded the school. It's your integrity on the line.</p>
<p><strong>Kate Armstrong</strong>: He's great at raising money. His donor list is huge. I didn't mean to kill him. (sniffling) I just wanted him to leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: But you hit him more than once.</p>
<p><strong>Kate Armstrong</strong>: Who knows. I ...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, you hit a man once, there's no blood. The first hit's free. You hit him more than that ... (clears throat) The walls in his office look like the Dean went a couple rounds with Mike Tyson.</p>
<p><strong>Kate Armstrong</strong>: Then I hit him more than once. Like I said, I just ... I wanted him off me.</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You don't seem too bummed about it.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hell, no. I'm stoked. (sotto voce) We drew the best case, Nicky. I can feel it.</p>

<p>(BOBBY absently scratches his right arm near the elbow and through his shirt.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You two work together?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Taylor</strong>: No. A few blocks apart. I'm over at Voosh's, you know? Voosh's fireworks. And he's at Element Sound, the music store.</p>

<p><strong>Bobby Taylor</strong>: The guy said it was natural -- that it wasn't a drug. I mean, jimsonweed is a plant.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Most drugs derive from plants. That doesn't make them safe.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Or legal, for that matter.</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Did you get a stamp when you got in?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Taylor</strong>: Yeah. But that was, like, four days ago.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, mostly they use water-resistant pads so you don't sweat it off. Could you hit the lights, Gris?</p>

<p>(BOBBY holds out his wrist, palm up and pushes his watch further up his arm. WARRICK turns on the black light. The stamp is still visible.)</p>

He'd flush the toilet there'd be this tiny, brown spider fighting for its life against the swirling water. Come back the next day, flush same spider clawing its way back from oblivion.

Comes back the next day ... what do you think happened to the spider?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Dead.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We need the clothes that you were wearing the day that The Dean was killed.</p>
<p><strong>Julia Eastman</strong>: I burned them.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>Julia Eastman</strong>: The blood wouldn't come out. They were ruined.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Blood's funny that way. In fact, I bet there's lots of blood on Dean Woods' shirt.</p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT CSI EVIDENCE VAULT -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and NICK examine Dean VERNON WOODS' shirt. CATHERINE notices the void.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Look at that void. What a beaut.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Oh, yeah. You don't even have to know every star and you can draw a constellation.</p>
<p>(Taking a pen, NICK outlines the void.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: And fill in the rest. Whoa, look at that last finger there.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Talk about your unique attributes. What do you think -- a bandage?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: We'll have to ask our ladies, but I can tell you this -- somebody's playing through the pain.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - GRISSOM'S OFFICE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(BOBBY TAYLOR is in GRISSOM'S office again.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I, uh ... just wanted you to know that Eric didn't die from Jimson tea. It didn't have the chemical toxicity to kill him. The seeds weren't strong enough.</p>
<p>(BOBBY quietly listens to GRISSOM. He doesn't say anything. He starts rubbing his arm. GRISSOM notices the movement.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Is your arm all right?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Taylor</strong>: Yeah, uh, spider bite. I think it's infected.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: May I take a look?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Taylor</strong>: Sure. You're a doctor. </p>
<p>(BOBBY undoes the cuff of his shirt.)</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Taylor</strong>: You might be able to give me something for it.</p>
<p>(He pushes his shirt sleeve up above his arm.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm a PhD, not an M.D.</p>
<p>(BOBBY chuckles. GRISSOM looks at the bite on BOBBY'S arm.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (grimly) Bobby ... this bite is not from an insect.</p>
<p>(BOBBY looks quizzically down at his arm, then back at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>

[INT CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY]</p>
<p>(DR. JENNA WILLIAMS puts her instruments into the cleaning machine and closes the machine door. GRISSOM walks into the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Jenna Williams</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hi. </p>
<p>(DR. WILLIAMS sits down at her desk. GRISSOM leans against it.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I found a bite mark on Bobby's arm and I think it might be human.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Jenna Williams</strong>: Do you feel like sharing?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (shakes his head) Not really.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Jenna Williams</strong>: Just a little?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (sighs) I don't know, Jenna. This whole case is going from bad to worse. I mean, usually it's a body, it's a specimen, but when it involves kids, I just can't ...</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Jenna Williams</strong>: Gruesome Grissom ... Tin Man with a heart ... (beat) ... who knew?</p>
<p>(WARRICK walks into the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey, guys. This came back for the test on aluminum products from our kid in the desert. (pauses) Fireworks.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (whispers) That's where Bobby Taylor works. Jenna, I need a mold of Eric's teeth ...</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
<strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) ... and an impression of Bobby's arm.</p>
<p>(With an OFFICER and a lawyer in the room, someone takes an impression on the bite mark on BOBBY'S arm.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and NICK re-interview both JULIA EASTMAN and KATE ARMSTRONG.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Julia, make a fist for me with your right hand. I mean, count it down like so, starting with your thumb first. Five, four, three, two, one.</p>
<p>(JULIA stares at them for a moment, then complies. She tries, but she can't bend her pinky finger.)</p>
<p><strong>Julia Eastman</strong>: I sprained it, at tennis. </p>
<p>(NICK reaches into his shirt pocket and pulls out a finger splint. He tosses it on to the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: It heals a lot faster when you wear one of these.</p>
<p>(Both JULIA and KATE stares at the item on the table. CATHERINE takes out the shirt and puts it on the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Dean woods' shirt.</p>
<p>(She spreads the shirt out on the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Now, remember we said blood tells us everything? Well ... so does the absence of blood.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE takes the finger splint and puts it on. She puts her hand over the void area on the shirt. It fits in the white area on the shirt.)</p>
<p><strong>Kate Armstrong</strong>: (gasps) Oh, my god.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Inside Dean VERNON WOODS' office, KATE ARMSTRONG swings the rock and hits VERNON WOODS on the forehead. He goes down. She swings the rock back and splatters blood on JULIA EASTMAN. She hits him again and again. Blood spatters everywhere with each successive blow.)</p>
<p>(When VERNON WOODS falls to the floor, JULIA EASTMAN puts her hand on his chest to keep him down. KATE ARMSTRONG continues to hit him with the rock.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You held him down ... while she killed him.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: All because the guy was handsy? Seems a little severe.</p>
<p>(Neither woman says anything.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. Kane</strong>: We're going to be placing you under arrest for murder. Is there anything you want to say?</p>
<p>(He turns around and opens the door. They remain silent.)</p>
<p>(Two male OFFICERS enter the room. The two women stand up and we see that they were holding each other's hands under the table in a tight grip, neither one wanting to let the other go.)</p>
<p>(They look at each other.)</p>
<p>(The officers take out the handcuffs and put them on.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Ma'am ... put your hands behind your back, please.</p>
<p>(They lead the women out of the room. CATHERINE watches them leave and shakes her head.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (quietly) No, no, this isn't over.</p>
<p>(They start putting their things away.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: For all forensic purposes, it is over. They're going to eat bread and bang a metal cup against some bars. That's it. It's over for us.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We still don't know why.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: It's not our job to know why. It's our job to know how. You heard Grissom. The more the 'why', the less the 'how', the less the 'how', the more the 'why'.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE stands up and turns around to look at NICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Grissom's not always right. Do yourself a favor and think for yourself. I mean that as a friend, okay? Okay, detective, we got some more homework to do.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE picks up the package and puts it on the table.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - GARAGE]</p>
<p>(SARA opens the door and leads RANDY GESEK into the garage.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What are you selling-- time-share coffins?</p>
<p><strong>Randy Gesek</strong>: Uh, there's no such thing as a time-share coffin.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Sure, there is. Once the funeral is over, you dump the body and use the same casket over and over.</p>
<p><strong>Randy Gesek</strong>: You can't prove that.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yes, I can. This is a set of prints on the inside of the plastic sheeting we found in the dumpster. What are the odds they belong to you? </p>
<p>(RANDY GESEK steps forward, shaking his head. He's busted.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: All you had to do was put the bodies back in the grave and no one would have been the wiser.</p>
<p><strong>Randy Gesek</strong>: You have no idea what a cut-throat business this is. The chains are moving in. I have payments to make. I see the world from a completely different perspective than most people.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah, I know. You see dead people. So do I. And when they turn up in dumpsters, I like to see they get back to where they belong.</p>
<p><strong>Randy Gesek</strong>: I'll repay the money.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Minimum. Then, you're going to pay for Stephanie Reyes' family to have a real burial.</p>
<p><strong>Randy Gesek</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>SARA At a respectable mortuary.</p>
<p><strong>Randy Gesek</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Then, we're going to let the D.A. run the table.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY - DAY]</p>
<p>(DET. KANE fills CATHERINE in on his findings.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. Kane</strong>: Did some homework on Kate </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Kane</strong>: Financial records for the last year.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Kane</strong>: Personal checks from Kate Armstrong to Vernon Woods over the last year.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: $5,000. Another for $5,000. $3,000. &quot;Memo: Loans.&quot; I don't think so. I think she was paying him off for something.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Inside the Interview room, DET. KANE presents his findings to KATE ARMSTRONG.)</p>
<p><strong>Kate Armstrong</strong>: Did Julia say anything?</p>
<p><strong>Det. Kate</strong>: Like what? The real reason you killed Woods?</p>
<p>[OBSERVATION ROOM]</p>
<p>(Inside the observation room, CATHERINE and NICK watch DET. KANE with KATE ARMSTRONG.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: This is where Gris and I differ. Forensics is about more than science. Human behavior. The inconsistencies of human behavior. Yes, &quot;how&quot; is crucially important, but so is &quot;why.&quot;</p>
<p>[INTERVIEW ROOM]</p>
<p>(KATE turns to her lawyer and whispers something to her. The LAWYER nods her head. KATE looks at DET. KANE.)</p>
<p><strong>Kate Armstrong</strong>: Okay. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Inside Dean VERNON WOODS' office, KATE and JULIA confront him.)</p>
<p><strong>Kate Armstrong</strong>: I'm finished paying you. We're going to live openly, honestly.</p>
<p><strong>Julie Eastman</strong>: It's a new century. Parents are &quot;evolved&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Vernon Woods</strong>: Not where their children are concerned. I'll tell everybody that I caught you two having s*x on school grounds.</p>
<p><strong>Kate Armstrong</strong>: That's a lie! JULIA EASTMAN: What?!</p>
<p><strong>Vernon Woods</strong>: Of course it's a lie. That didn't stop the McMartin school from closing down. (The two women look at VERNON WOODS like he's scum.) (He sighs.)<br />
Yeah, I think I'll make a call.</p>
<p>(He turns to get the phone on the counter. JULIA turns to look at KATE. KATE reaches for the rock on the desk. She grabs it, rushes forward and hits him on the back of the head with it.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Kate Armstrong</strong>: Julia and I would never have survived a rumor like that. We panicked. The school is our whole life.</p>
<p>(KATE starts to cry.)</p>
<p>[OBSERVATION ROOM]</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hmm. You got your &quot;why.&quot; Crime of passion.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (nods) Bigger &quot;why&quot;: Why did it have to come down to this?</p>
<p>(Inside the interview room, the officer moves to get KATE ARMSTRONG.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I guess they didn't feel like they had a choice.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Maybe they didn't.</p>
<p>(Inside the room, everyone leaves.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: A lose-lose situation.</p>

[INT. CSI - BREAK ROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(BRASS, WARRICK and GRISSOM talk with BOBBY TAYLOR and his LAWYER, CASSANNO.)</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Taylor</strong>: I'm telling you, I didn't kill Eric.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Can you remember your last hours with him Saturday night?</p>
<p><strong>Cassanno (lawyer)</strong>: Don't answer that.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby</strong>: I want to answer it. I just ... I can't remember anything after we took that stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's not about memory now, Bobby. It's about the evidence and the evidence ... sucks.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The night of the rave party.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) You and Eric bought Jimson tea from Ethan that night.</p>
<p><strong>Ethan</strong>: Enjoy, fellas!</p>
<p>(ETHAN gives them the jimsonweed tea. He laughs.)</p>
<p>(Flash to white: ERIC and BOBBY drink the tea.)</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Taylor</strong>: Cheers, man.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: But you guys have never taken j-weed before so you weren't aware of the side effects of photophobia.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Taylor</strong>: Ph-photo what?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Photophobia. It's just a big word for lights freaking you out. You guys were hallucinating and whatever Eric was seeing was scaring him, big-time.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Night of the rave party. The two boys, high, are running deeper into the desert. The bright lights from the cars and the vibrant colors are powerful.)</p>
<p>(ERIC runs over the hill and falls. BOBBY runs after him. They're both running from the bright lights of the cars.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: The coroner states that Eric's dose shot his temperature through the roof. He was boiling in his own skin. So he stripped which is why we found him naked.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: ERIC is running down the hillside and rips off his shirt.. The cars with their bright lights and vibrant colors continue to follow them along the desert. ERIC runs.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We just don't know if it was an act of aggression or self-defense.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Taylor</strong>: I loved that guy.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's why I tend to believe it was an act of self-protection. The lights were scaring him. At the same time, we conjecture that you were suffering auditory hallucinations. Both of these symptoms are routine with this drug.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: ERIC is running. BOBBY is behind him, yelling at him.)</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Taylor</strong>: Shut up! Shut up!</p>
<p>(Whatever BOBBY'S hearing, it's incredibly loud and annoying. He covers both ears with his hands.)</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Taylor</strong>: Shut up! Shut up! BOBBY TAYLOR: Shut up! Shut up!</p>
<p>(BOBBY catches up with ERIC and grabs him from behind.)</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Taylor</strong>: Shut up! Shut... shut up!</p>
<p>(He covers ERIC'S mouth ... trying to get him to shut up. ERIC struggles, but BOBBY has him firmly in his grasp.)</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Taylor</strong>: Shut up ...</p>
<p>(ERIC grabs at BOBBY'S hands trying to get free.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Taylor</strong>: (stunned) I just ... I-I can't remember, honest.</p>
<p><strong>Cassanno (lawyer)</strong>: You can &quot;believe&quot; and &quot;conjecture&quot; all you want. None of this is based on fact.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm afraid that it is. The evidence tells us that Bobby suffocated Eric.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We found traces of aluminum trapped in Eric's nostrils that are consistent with what we found in your client's hands and arms earlier today from his job at the fireworks plant.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Taylor</strong>: I don't think I would do that.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I know, Bobby, but you did.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM reaches to the side and pulls out a small plastic container. He opens it and takes out the mold.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This is a mold of the bite mark that we took from your arm today. </p>
<p>(He puts the mold down on the table and reaches into the plastic container.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This is a mold of Eric's mouth, postmortem.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM puts the teeth over the bite mark. It's a perfect match.)</p>
<p>(BOBBY stares at the evidence in front of him and silent tears course down his cheeks.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: ERIC struggles in BOBBY'S grasp. BOBBY doesn't let ERIC go.)</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Taylor</strong>: Shut up! Shut up! BOBBY TAYLOR: Shut up! Shut up!</p>
<p>(ERIC can't breath and slowly falls to the ground as he continues to struggle.)</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Taylor</strong>: Shut up. Shut up.</p>
<p>(ERIC bites BOBBY'S arm. BOBBY grunts in pain. He grabs ERIC'S nose and mouth, covering them with his hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Taylor</strong>: Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(BOBBY stares out in front of him, crying.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You overpowered him, he suffocated ... and then, finally, the noise stopped.</p>
<p>(The LAWYER shakes her head.)</p>
<p><strong>Cassanno (lawyer)</strong>: I can tell you right now we're going to plead diminished capacity.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Good. I hope you win.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Taylor</strong>: (shakes his head) It doesn't matter. </p>
<p><strong>Cassanno (lawyer)</strong>: It's the difference between prison and a hospital, Bobby. It matters.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Taylor</strong>: You don't understand. I don't care what happens to me. I killed my best friend.</p>
<p>(He looks up at GRISSOM. Their eyes meet. GRISSOM'S eyes full of compassion for the young man.)</p>

<p>(They watch as the OFFICERS exit the building and lead BOBBY TAYLOR outside in handcuffs. They put him in their vehicle and drive off.)</p>
<p>(Unable to watch anymore, GRISSOM stands and leaves.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Where you going?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Away.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. STRATOSPHERE - DUSK]</p>

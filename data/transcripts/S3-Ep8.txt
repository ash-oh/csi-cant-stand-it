[INT. FILM DEVELOPERS - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and CATHERINE stand next to a film projector and watch the film on screen. The FILM PROCESSOR, who called it in, stands on the opposite side of the projector. On screen, she's showing them the p0rn film she recently developed.)</p>
<p>(On screen, the man finishes and the woman lies back on the bed.)</p>
<p>FILM PROCESSOR (WOMAN): Okay, this is where it got weird.</p>
<p>(On screen, the man pulls the woman off of the bed by the wrist. He holds her up close, his back to the camera. He pulls a knife. The woman struggles to get out of his grip.)</p>
<p>(The man puts the knife against the woman's neck.)</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: (on film) Don't ...</p>
<p>(He pulls the knife and cuts the woman's neck, blood spatters everywhere. The woman struggles to breathe, then falls to the floor and out of camera frame.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE isn't unaffected by the film.)</p>
<p>FILM PROCESSOR (WOMAN): I've processed hundreds of bogus snuff films. But this, this one just felt different.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (closes her eyes for a moment) Yeah, it should. arterial spray was real.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM watches grimly as the blood drops on the camera lens slowly slide downward.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's not fake blood. It's human. That was a murder ... on 16 millimeter.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO: END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>

<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>THIS PROGRAM CONTAINS ADULT CONTENT</p>
<hr />
[INT. FILM DEVELOPERS - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM puts on his gloves to handle the film.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Has this pornographer sent you film to be developed in the past?</p>
<p>FILM PROCESSOR (WOMAN): I'm sure he has. We get raw film from hundreds of adult film companies. No names, just those private boxes. You can film p0rn, develop it, sell it, buy it but you can't send it through the U.S. Mail.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I've got several envelopes here from various private shipping companies.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We'll be taking those with us as well.</p>
<p>FILM PROCESSOR (WOMAN): Whatever.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM'S cell phone rings. He answers it.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Grissom.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (over phone) It's Brass. </p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH:</p>
<p>[EXT. HENDERSON ROAD - NIGHT]</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I got a D.B. Out on Henderson Road.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm already on a case.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, well, reconsider. I mean, these ants came flying out of the body. They're taking chunks out of the coroner. The CSI day guy says he's not going near the body again!</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: They're fire ants, Brass. Keep everyone away from the colony. They're evidence.</p>
<p>(Behind BRASS, DAVID PHILLIPS tries to get the ants off of him.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Reconsider. Bring bug spray.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No bug spray!</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. HENDERSON ROAD - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(BRASS escorts GRISSOM to the dead body.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So a kid was driving along and spotted the tool box. He thought it would look good in his pickup truck. So he looked inside and freaked out. Ran to call for help. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM and BRASS reach DAVID PHILLIPS.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Hey ... Grissom. You ever see anything like this?</p>
<p>(DAVID holds his arm out for GRISSOM to look at. There are angry puffy bite marks on his arm.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, any species that finds itself in a place it doesn't belong can do this kind of damage. What are you using?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Cortisone.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That'll help.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and BRASS continue on to the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know, I heard that these things can kill a deer. Is that ... is that right?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, with enough colonies they can kill people.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What about our person?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, only if they also learned how to put him in a box and dump him in a ditch.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. HENDERSON ROAD - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The tool box lid opens. Inside is a dead body eaten away down to its bones. The entire body is covered with fire ants.)</p>
<p>(Behind him, BRASS coughs at the smell.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Man or woman?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM brushes away some of the flying ants from his sight.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Ant hill. They're using this body as a colony site. I'm going to have to take this box and the specimen back to the lab as is. These insects are evidence.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and DET. SULIK walk in the hallway as he fills her in on the info about the snuff film.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. Sulik</strong>: I followed up on the private mail depot for our snuff movie. The place has got over a thousand boxes no records of renters and they deal in cash only.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Dead trail. </p>
<p><strong>Det. Sulik</strong>: Yeah. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I got Archie to digitize that film blow up a head shot of our victim.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE hands DET. SULIK a photograph of the woman.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. Sulik</strong>: I find any missing persons that match her description, I'll beep you.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Thanks, Sulik.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - LAB -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(SARA is looking at the film negative with a magnifying glass. CATHERINE walks into the lab.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Find any fingerprints?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I should be able to. Imaging components on a filmstrip are held together by gelatin. Same stuff that makes jell-o jiggle, but they're smudged. I can tell you that the film was manufactured in 2002 by a big company. Homicide's contacting them now to get a buyer's list.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE puts on a pair of gloves.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Won't help. Pornos buy &quot;short ends&quot; from legitimate clearing houses. Saves money and they're impossible to trace.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (impressed) Really?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I pulled a porno ring using teenage girls a couple years ago. Learned all you want to know about the adult entertainment industry. </p>
<p>(CATHERING picks up a film negative strip and looks at it through a magnifying glass.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hell of a way to go.</p>
<p>(SARA'S silent for a moment.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I always thought that snuff films were an urban myth. I mean, outside of urban Bangkok.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE puts the film down and looks at SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: FBI's official position on snuff films in the U.S. Of a? No such thing.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What's their unofficial position?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Single film goes for hundred grand ... original negative.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE goes back to looking at the negative.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: And this snuff filmmaker decided to send his film out to get processed.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Greedy doesn't mean smart.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - OUTSIDE FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(DOC ROBBINS struggles to put on his protective suit around his leg. Next to him, GRISSOM also puts on his suit.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Come on, you bitch! I'm allergic to red ants, you know.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM puts his head gear on and works to put his gloves on. ROBBINS does the same.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah? I put them on my eggs.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: If they're dead, I hope.</p>
<p>(They both enter the autopsy room.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and ROBBINS carry the body to the examining table. The entire room is covered with plastic to keep the insects inside. GRISSOM starts to sprinkle white powder along the edge of the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Something tells me that isn't black flag.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Ecozone pyrethrum. Toxic to ants, fleas, roaches and silverfish.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: And how does an entomologist feel about putting ants to death?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I view them as martyrs in a scientist's holy war.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: I see. (looks at the body) Man without a face.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Timeline for death?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Hard to say between the insects and the elements. At least a year.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It smells more like two.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Multiple fractures of both clavicles. </p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV to the right clavicle of the body. The ants and grime disappear and only the clean bone is left for us to view. The bone breaks.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (V.O.) Right clavicle healed ... broken four months before death.</p>
<p>(The bone heals up. Camera moves over the ant-infested body to the left clavicle and focuses in on the second break.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (V.O.) Left was more recent ... hairline fractures are still present.</p>
<p>(End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Give me a hand turning him over, will you? </p>
<p>(They turn the body over.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What are these?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM sticks his fingers in two almost identical wounds on the body's back.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: I'm not sure. Sharp impact wounds to the interscapular. Same trauma here in the vertebrel.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Stab wounds?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: I can't say. Uh, maybe some round weapon of some sort.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What, two feet apart? More like 18 inches. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM sees something. He digs in his pocket for a forceps and removes something from the body. He holds it up.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: A pupa case.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Is that a good thing or a bad thing?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's a good thing. If I can postdate the pupa I can establish an entomological timeline.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - AUDIO/VISUAL LAB -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(WARRICK and ARCHIE work on getting information from the snuff film.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Okay, all right, let's run this back again from the beginning. This time without the sound.</p>
<p>(ARCHIE clicks on the keyboard and the film rewinds.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: All right.</p>
<p>(They reach the beginning of the film where the woman is on the bed and the man in the robe walks into the room. The man disrobes.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Stop.</p>
<p>(ARCHIE punches a key on the keyboard and the film pauses.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Can you zoom in on his back?</p>
<p>(ARCHIE boxes and enlarges a mark on the man's back.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What is that? A mole?</p>
<p><strong>Archie Johnson</strong>: Non-cancerous.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You think? Too bad, the b*st*rd. (The film resumes.) This room is like a dime a dozen it could be anywhere in Vegas. Between the drapes can you get any other detail outside of that window?</p>
<p><strong>Archie Johnson</strong>: Uh ... I'll reverse the polarization see if we can get any more information from this frame.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: That looks like a blob outside of the window. It's spherical.</p>
<p><strong>Archie Johnson</strong>: Blow it up. Times ten.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: The Stratosphere Tower. South face maybe? Using that Stratosphere Tower as a point of reference could you triangulate and pinpoint the street that this was filmed on?</p>
<p><strong>Archie Johnson</strong>: (smiles and nods) I can.</p>
<p>(ARCHIE gets to work.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY -- STRATOSPHERE TOWER (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<hr />
[EXT. MANDOLIN TOWER HOTEL - DRIVEWAY -- DAY]</p>
<p>(DET. SULIK, CATHERINE, SARA and WARRICK make their way up the driveway.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. Sulik</strong>: Hotel's in receivership. The security guy says the elevator still works.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We're going to need to talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Sulik</strong>: Soon as he gets off the phone with the owner.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. MANDOLIN TOWER HOTEL - LOBBY -- DAY]</p>
<p>(The group walks into the lobby. CATHERINE pauses and looks around. She stops and stares at a lamp in the lobby. WARRICK notices and stops to stand next to her.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What's up?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (looking at the lamp) Oh, nothing. Only difference between Kitsch and beautiful is time.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - GRISSOM'S OFFICE -- DAY]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM is holding a stack of bug samples in baggies.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (o.s.) Heard you're doing a timeline on the ant man.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Slow day in DNA, Greg?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM starts to tape the baggies to the glass board.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yeah. (pause) You know, I, uh ... I can take notes.</p>
<p>(GREG walks up to GRISSOM from the other side of the glass board and pulls out a small notepad and pen.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Very good. Go right ahead.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM starts the timeline. He talks out loud as he writes.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (writing) Week zero: Body dies. Week two: Green blowflies arrive ... and leave their pupal casings.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM grabs one of the baggied samples and tapes it under &quot;Week 2&quot;. He continues.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Week four: Black soldier flies move in. At Week 28 ... they leave their pupa casings.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM grabs the second baggied sample and sticks it under &quot;Week 28&quot;. He continues.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Now, the presence of winged reproductive fire ants suggests that their colony was in existence for at least a year.</p>
<p>(At this, GRISSOM takes the final bag and tags it at the end. He writes a large<br />
&quot;52&quot; over it and circles it. He continues.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Now, since we found no more pupa casings after the black soldier flies left at week 28, we know that this is when the fire ants must've first arrived.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM writes a &quot;1&quot; and circles it.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So, calculating the gestation period between ants and flies, we get...</p>
<p>(GREG starts counting. He reaches over and grabs the blue pen.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: One year plus the 28 weeks ... the guy's been dead 19 months.</p>
<p>(GREG writes a big &quot;19&quot; on the board and circles it.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (pleased) Very good. It's an approximation, but it's a start.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. MANDOLIN TOWER HOTEL - HALLWAY ON FLOOR -- DAY]</p>
<p>(As they walk down the hallway, CATHERINE assigns the rooms to each of them.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well ... Sara, you take that one.</p>
<p>(SARA enters the first room.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Warrick, you go there, I'll go in here.</p>
<p>(They each walk into their assigned rooms.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(CATHERINE walks into her room and looks around.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: WARRICK is inside his room and holds up a large clear image of the stratosphere tower from the film. They try to find the room by matching the tower in the negative to the tower in the window. He looks at the negative and pulls it down to look at the window: no match.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: CATHERINE holding up the large clear image against the window. She looks at the image and pulls it down to look at the window: no match.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: SARA holding up the same large clear image against the window. She looks at the image and sees the stratosphere tower line up perfectly with the tower in the window.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. MANDOLIN TOWER HOTEL - ROOM 918- DAY -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey, guys? </p>
<p>(CATHERINE and WARRICK walk into the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We got it.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (looking around) Somebody moved out all the furniture.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And painted the wall.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE puts her kit down.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: If they can't see it, we can't, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Right.</p>
<p>(WARRICK puts his kit down and picks up his ALS. He shines it on the wall. Under the light, the blood spatter is obvious.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Arterial spray </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to the knife slicing through the woman's neck. She gasps. The blood spatters on the wall. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (pointing) There's a void. Could be a face?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: How does somebody cross the line where killing a woman is a turn-on?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, I don't think snuff makers cross a line, I think they start on the other side of it.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Biology determining pathology.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, some people were just born bad. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Where's that security guard?</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. MANDOLIN TOWER HOTEL - LOBBY -- DAY]</p>
<p><strong>Det. Sulik</strong>: How long you been a day guard here?</p>
<p><strong>Security Guard</strong>: Four months. But I don't know anything about this murder you're talking about.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Do you anything about who painted Room 918?</p>
<p><strong>Security Guard</strong>: No idea.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE notices the white spots on the SECURITY GUARD'S shoulder.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You should try a scalp conditioner.</p>
<p><strong>Security Guard</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Your dandruff. (on closer look) Oh, my bad ... primer. Alkyd-based. Never comes out in the wash but you already know that.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Roll out. Camera slows down, the last frame stutters gets hit with more light. </p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV to: Front view of a film camera. The camera turns to the side to show the view screen on the bottom.

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The, uh, toolbox in your truck, is that new?</p>
<p><strong>Billy Rattison</strong>: Nope. Bought it a couple months ago. Somebody stole the last one. See, we got a big problem with that around here the help walking off with stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Nick, where did you acquire this photo?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Pro rodeo Association.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes a photo out of the envelope he's carrying. He shows the photograph to BILLY RATTISON.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That is you.</p>
<p><strong>Billy Rattison</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Do you remember where this was taken?</p>
<p>(BILLY RATTISON takes the picture and looks at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Billy Rattison</strong>: Looks like bronc finals, Wichita, Kansas. Spent a month there training for the finals.</p>
<p>(He gives the photo back to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: But you live here normally, right?</p>
<p><strong>Billy Rattison</strong>: (nods) Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What month, exactly?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM puts the photo in front of BILLY RATTISON again.)</p>
<p><strong>Billy Rattison</strong>: (sighs heavily) This photo here ... uh, March, 2000. </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: 19 months ago.</p>

[EXT. LAS VEGAS RANCH - DAY -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and NICK walk through the stalls to leave the ranch.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Your ants put the time of death at 19 months Rattison puts being out of town at 19 months yet Randy Traschel's been missing 17 months so... (chuckles) ... now what?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We need a more precise timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah ... so ... back to the bugs?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: On to the rust.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Ahh.</p>

[INT. CSI - HALLWAY / LAB --- DAY]</p>
<p>(SARA walks through the hallway.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (o.s.) Damn.</p>
<p>(A flying phonebook flies out of the lab door and hits the floor in front of her with a thud just barely missing her. She turns and enters the lab. WARRICK is inside looking at the curtain hanging in front of him.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Why are you throwing phone books?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (frustrated) 'Cause a beaker gets glass all over the place.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What's wrong?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It's this curtain that the p0rn girl was found wrapped in. I've got no prints, no second donor. I've got nothing to link this p0rn guy to the girl's murder. It's just driving me nuts.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'm fine.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'm sorry. Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah. You missed me by a mile. We may have something.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Really.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Right here. I wanted to show you. (SARA holds up a single film frame negative for WARRICK to look at.) When he's stabbing her, she's bleeding all over him.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, a void proves that, but we still can't prove it's him.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah, but her blood might. Catherine and I suspect transference. She had HIV.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, how are we going to get a sample of Sampson's blood?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Warrant, based on the butterscotch dirt that you found on his car.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (pleased) Oh. I like that.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You might want to apologize to the phone book.</p>
<p>(SARA turns and walks out of the lab.)</p>

[INT. CSI - AUDIO/VISUAL LAB]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and NICK work on the piece of metal with ARCHIE.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We sliced the shard into layers of one hundred microns to measure the level of oxidation. Moisture from the body hits the carbon steel and then corrosion begins.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV to: Camera zooms from RANDY TRASCHEL'S body in the box and pans down the box from his head to his feet. The camera finds the single piece of metal near his feet, drops of moisture on it.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) And we can be certain that there was moisture right away.</p>
<p>(End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So it's like slicing the mold off of bread ...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: ... and measuring it. The rust penetrated the thirteenth layer and just barely in the fourteenth. Archie, run the weather.</p>
<p><strong>Archie</strong>: National weather service for Las Vegas. Average relative humidity<br />
30.29. Temperature 22.61 Celsius.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So, corrosion versus time ... </p>
<p><strong>Archie</strong>: May 2000.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Spur exposure time was exactly 17 months.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And we can testify to this.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Missing persons was right. The ants were off.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, so was Rattison. He was in town.</p>

<p>(GRISSOM puts a photo of the ant-infested body on his desk alongside other photos. He picks up a ruler and puts it down on the table.)</p>
<p>(He then takes a rubber band and stretches it between two pencils till he hits eighteen inches, the length between the puncture wounds on the body.)</p>
<p>(He holds it at this length, lifts it up and looks at it. Thinking about it, he deliberately tilts the tips of the pencils inward.)</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We have reason to believe the wounds that killed Randy Traschel were made by one of your bulls.</p>
<p><strong>Pete Banson</strong>: That's why we cut the horns, to prevent such.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: We're looking for horns with points attached.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah. We need to see your other bulls.</p>

<p>(BILLY RATTISON walks past the corral and sees BRASS, NICK and GRISSOM standing next to his truck.)</p>
<p><strong>Billy Rattison</strong>: What do you all want now?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We're waiting on you, actually. Mr. Rattison, we have reason to believe you were in town the month that Randy Traschel was murdered.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Could you tell us what used to be here?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM points to a hole in the hood of the truck.)</p>
<p><strong>Billy Rattison</strong>: My belt buckles. Somebody stole it last year, like I said. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You do get a lot of stuff stolen, don't you? Mind if we look around your truck?</p>
<p><strong>Billy Rattison</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM opens the lid to the tool box and starts looking through it's contents.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (to BILLY RATTISON) Don't get any tobacco juice on my shoe.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM digs and pulls things out. Then he sees it. Under the saddle, he finds a mounted set of bull horns with its points in tact. He takes it out of the box and holds it for NICK to see.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Got a tape measure?</p>
<p>(NICK measures it from point to point.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Eighteen inches.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Phenolphthalein.</p>
<p>(NICK tests the horn tips. The swab turns pink.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Positive for blood.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Looks like the only thing stolen around here was Randy Traschel's life.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks behind NICK at BILLY RATTISON.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mr. Rattison, want to explain this?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Riding practice at the corral at night. BILLY'S on the bronco. He falls on the ground. When he looks up, he sees RANDY TRASCHEL smiling on the side.)</p>
<p><strong>Billy Rattison</strong>: (angry and humiliated) What you laughing at, huh? You want to come over here and try it?</p>
<p>(RANDY loses his smile. BILLY RATTISON walks up to RANDY.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: BILLY ties RANDY'S hand to the bronco saddle. When he's done, he steps back and laughs.)</p>
<p><strong>Randy Traschel</strong>: No. No.! I didn't mean it! No!</p>
<p>(The bronco is let loose. After a moment of hanging on, RANDY falls to the ground, injuring his shoulder. BILLY and the other guys stand on the side and laugh. RANDY gets up clutching his shoulder. He's in pain.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: BILLY walking away and RANDY running to catch up with him.)</p>
<p><strong>Randy Traschel</strong>: Wait, Billy! Wait!</p>
<p>(BILLY turns around, grabs RANDY and throws him toward his truck. RANDY hits the bull horns which hang from the hood like an ornament.)</p>
<p>(BILLY stops at what he's done.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: BILLY putting RANDY'S body in the tool box and trying to close the lid. It won't close, so BILLY sticks his foot inside to push down RANDY'S body so that the lid can close. The spur breaks off.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks past BILLY RATTISON. He turns around and leans toward him over his shoulder. BILLY doesn't turn around.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: By the way, the definition of the word &quot;retard&quot; is &quot;to hinder&quot; or &quot;to hold someone back.&quot; I think your life is about to become 'retarded'.</p>

<p><strong>Det. Sulik</strong>: Okay, one more time, for the record: You have never had sexual intercourse with Susan Hodap?</p>
<p><strong>Douglas Sampson</strong>: I told you, I've never even met her.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Sulik</strong>: I know, but I got to ask. You've never had s*x with her?</p>
<p><strong>Douglas Sampson</strong>: Not ever.</p>

<p>(The door opens. CATHERINE and SARA walk in.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You still have those chills, Mr. Sampson? Feeling hot, achy? Back of your throat scratchy?</p>
<p><strong>Douglas Sampson</strong>: Yeah, it is. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Original flu happens at the onset of HIV. Seroconversion. Usually presents two to six weeks after the exchange of fluids.</p>
<p><strong>Douglas Sampson</strong>: Exchange of fluids?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: That temperature is your body working up a resistance to the virus.</p>
<p><strong>Douglas Sampson</strong>: HIV? Me? Now, come on. You just took my blood a few days ago.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: A private lab can run a virus test within a day. CDC doesn't broadcast that. Tests are very expensive.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We dipped into the budget ... just for you.</p>
<p><strong>Douglas Sampson</strong>: You're playing me. I don't have HIV.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Susan Hodap had it. The exact same strain that you have.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We had that lab do what's called a phylogenetic analysis of your HIV's DNA and Susan's.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE puts the results on the table in front of DOUGLAS SAMPSON. He looks down at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: As you can see, the genes are identical. Which means Susan gave it directly to you.</p>
<p><strong>Douglas Sampson</strong>: But we never had s*x.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You did stab her, though. And at that moment </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to DOUGLAS SAMPSON in the room after he stabs SUSAN HODAP. Blood splatters on him. Camera zooms in as more blood continues to splatter on DOUGLAS SAMPSON'S face and into his eyes.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) ... her arterial blood hit your eyes entering your body through the conjunctival membrane.</p>
<p>(DOUGLAS SAMPSON raises his hand holding the knife and wiping the blood from his eyes. End of quick flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Non-sexual transmission is extremely difficult but obviously it's possible. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Camera close up of the blood on DOUGLAS SAMPSON'S face.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (V.O.) Susan's blood was absorbed into your bloodstream.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV to: Camera zooms in to the eye and to SUSAN HODAP'S blood on DOUGLAS SAMPSON'S eye, near and around the blood vessels.)</p>
<p>(End of CGI POV. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(DOUGLAS SAMPSON stares at the womeen. He doesn't say anything.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Where the new HIV cells immediately started attaching to your healthy white blood cells. Gets inside one, replicates about 2,000 times. Disables the host cell, pinches back out, infecting more good cells ... lowering your immune system until your body loses its ability to fight off even the simplest invader. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Of course, the strains will have changed by then and you and Susan Hodap will have a different strain of HIV. The sooner you see a doctor, the better your chances for longevity.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: But for now, we got you. </p>
<p>(DOUGLAS SAMPSON says nothing. He's completely surprised by what they're saying.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You killed her.</p>
<p>(DOUGLAS SAMPSON looks over at SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I guess she killed you back.</p>

<p>[Scenes from 7X01: Built to Kill (1)]</p>
<p>[Song: &quot;Waiting on the World to Change,&quot; John Mayer]</p>
<p>[INT. HOTEL - BAR -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(CLOSE-UP: Catherine's drink. She mixes the drink.) </p>
<p>VARIOUS CUTS:</p>
<p>(Catherine is woozy; her vision blurry. The music sounds muffled and fades out. The people in the bar look as if they're moving in slow motion.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[CU: CATHERINE'S EYE]</p>
<p>(Catherine opens her eyes.) </p>
<p>REVERSE POV</p>
<p>[INT. MOTEL ROOM - MORNING]</p>
<p>(Sunlight filters in through large holes in the closed curtains.) </p>
<p>(Catherine raises her head off the bed. We note that she is naked and on her stomach on a bed in an unknown motel room.) </p>
<p>(Cut to: Catherine opens the curtains and is blinded by the sunlight.)</p>
<p>(Outside is a small motel swimming pool. She squints as her eyes adjust to the bright light and as she looks around. All she sees is a parking lot and more motel rooms.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(Catherine is standing in front of the mirror. She's wearing her black slip. She picks up the phone and dials.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(She takes the tampon and uses it to get a sample from herself. She sets it aside.)</p>
<p>[INT. MOTEL ROOM - SHOWER -- MORNING]</p>
<p>(Catherine is taking a shower. As the water falls and steam rises, she covers her face with her hands and cries.) </p>
<p>CUT TO: END OF PREVIOUSLY ON RESUME EPISODE</p>
<p>TEASER</p>
<p>[EXT. MOTEL - WALKWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Catherine is dressed and heads toward the registration office. She looks around.) </p>
<p>[INT. MOTEL - REGISTRATION OFFICE - DAY]</p>
<p>(The desk clerk is on the phone. He's looking at the computer at MatchMistress.com. On the site is a photo of a dark-haired woman, presumably the woman he's talking to on the phone. He touches the photo as he talks.) </p>
<p><strong>Desk Clerk</strong>: (to phone) Yeah, that's my real photo on my profile.</p>
<p>(Catherine walks into the office.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p>(He holds up his finger for her to wait. He continues talking on the phone.) </p>
<p><strong>Desk Clerk</strong>: (to phone) Well, I exercise a lot. Kind of an animal about it.</p>
<p>(Catherine looks around and sees the concrete. It triggers a memory.)</p>
<p>INSERT: FLASHBACK</p>
<p>(Someone walks along the concrete sidewalk at night half-carrying, half-dragging Catherine on his back.) </p>
<p>BACK TO SCENE.</p>
<p>(Agitated, Catherine grabs the desk clerk's arm.) </p>
<p><strong>Desk Clerk</strong>: Hey. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Did you see me last night?</p>
<p><strong>Desk Clerk</strong>: Yeah, you were feeling no pain.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Who was I with? Describe him. Was he white, black, tall? Hair color, car?</p>
<p><strong>Desk Clerk</strong>: Look, lady, I get paid not to notice.</p>
<p>(Catherine digs into her bag and shows him her ID.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Who was room 229 registered to?</p>
<p>(He reluctantly checks. The computer beeps.) </p>
<p><strong>Desk Clerk</strong>: Catherine Willows. You used your credit card.</p>
<p>(Catherine turns and walks out of the office.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. DELANCY RESIDENCE - KITCHEN -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Izzy Delancy is dead and slumped over the kitchen table, his head in a pool of blood. Sara and Grissom are near the kitchen counter looking at the diorama, an exact replica of the real crime scene.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I think Malibu Barbie did it.</p>
<p>(Sara glances over at Izzy at the table.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, then there's a lot more to Barbie than just a pretty face, 'cause this is a perfect half-inch scale model of the room. And assuming that the killer is the same person who made the miniature ... </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: -- it would of taken weeks. Maybe even months to create with this kind of detail.</p>
<p>(She notes the miniature framed photos and miniature bowl of fruit on the miniature counter.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Certainly qualifies as premeditation.</p>
<p>(Grissom takes out a swab.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, but take a look at the blood pools.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: They're identical.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: There's no predicting a blood pool; it's inherently random.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Killer must of stuck around to match the scene.</p>
<p>(Grissom takes a swab of the blood in the miniature and tests it as Sara looks at Izzy.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's real blood.</p>
<p>INSERT: FLASH OF</p>
<p>(Someone takes a syringe of blood from the real blood pool and adds a drop of blood to the miniature crime scene.)</p>
<p>BACK TO SCENE.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: That is a level of obsession that gives even you a run for your money.</p>
<p>(Sara turns and notes the gold records on the wall. She reads the title off the first one. It's a Final Mile record.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: &quot;If Dusty Fell,&quot; Izzy Delancy. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's his biggest hit.</p>
<p>(Sara turns to look at Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I have never heard of him.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Probably before your time.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'll download it. (Sara turns back to Izzy and walks around him.) I checked the perimeter; property is gated with a code. There is no sign of forced entry on the windows or the doors. Of course if a girl can get into Brad Pitt's underwear drawer and take a nap on his bed, I guess anything is possible.</p>
<p>(Sara touches the body.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Lividity suggests he hasn't been moved. He was probably sitting right here when he was killed.</p>
<p>(She looks at the back of Izzy's head. Grissom watches her.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Looks like blunt force trauma.</p>
<p>(Sara looks up at the ceiling.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No spatter or cast off.</p>
<p>INSERT: FLASH TO:</p>
<p>(Someone comes up behind Izzy as he sits at the table and hits him on the back of the head. He slumps forward.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (V.O.) Which suggests a single blow ... </p>
<p>BACK TO SCENE.</p>
<p>(Sara stops and looks at Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sometimes it only takes one hit.</p>
<p>SMASH CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[EXT. DELANCY RESIDENCE - FRONT DRIVE-- DAY] </p>
<p>(The coroners roll the gurney with Izzy's body down the front drive. Sara follows them. Off screen, we hear a crowd of adoring fans scream. We see the flash of camera bulbs as the body is wheeled out.) </p>
<p>(The officers lift the tape up and the coroners exit under it and through the crowd.) </p>
<p>(At the same time, a group of girls duck under the tape and run up the drive toward the house. An officer runs after them.)</p>
<p>(Greg also ducks under the tape and walks up to Sara. She sees him and turns around to walk with him up the drive.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Oh, great, you're here. Thanks for coming.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I can't believe you're leaving Izzy Delancy's death scene. Groupies are already starting to gather.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I have something that I have to take care of. Nick and Sofia are talking to the family, Grissom's s in the kitchen. You can process the bedrooms? Thanks. </p>
<p>(Sara turns and heads back down the front drive while Greg turns and heads toward the house.) </p>
<p>(An officer drags a woman fan away from the front door.) </p>
<p><strong>Fan</strong>: Izzy!</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. DELANCY RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Sofia and Nick enter the living room where Annie Lansfield is jiggling the baby.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Mrs. Delancy?</p>
<p>(Annie Lansfield turns around. She smiles as she walks over to them.)</p>
<p><strong>Annie Lansfield</strong>: No, that's Mrs. Delancy. (She points to the blonde woman on the phone behind them.) I'm Annie, the nanny.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I'm going to need to photograph your hands.</p>
<p><strong>Annie Lansfield</strong>: To look for blood, right?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Blood evidence, yeah, and defensive wounds. I'm also going to get a sample of your DNA and your fingerprints. So, why don't you hand little Nora to her mom for right now, okay?</p>
<p><strong>Annie Lansfield</strong>: (shakes her head) No, Mrs. D never holds the baby.<br />
(whispers) She's got a bad back.</p>
<p>(She surprises Sofia and holds the baby out to her.) </p>
<p>(Sofia takes the baby and Annie holds her hands out, palms down. Nick clears his throat and shakes his head. He snaps photos of her hands.)</p>
<p><strong>Annie Lansfield</strong>: I should warn you, I'm a little freaked. When I get nervous or scared or whatever I have this problem where I talk a lot. I've had it since I was little. I just keep talking ...</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: (interrupts) You found the body?</p>
<p>(Annie stops talking and tears up. She nods. Nick continues to snap photos of her hands.) </p>
<p><strong>Annie Lansfield</strong>: Tuesday is Chinese. Izzy insists ... on having ... a really strict eating schedule. I have to start cooking by 4:00 and when I went into the kitchen ...</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Annie Lansfield bounces the baby in her arms as she heads to the kitchen.) </p>
<p><strong>Annie Lansfield</strong>: (to the baby) Baby's don't eat bok choy. Yeah, wonder what you're going to have for --</p>
<p>(She suddenly stops when she sees Izzy slumped in a pool of blood over on the table.) </p>
<p>(She screams.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume present.)</p>
<p><strong>Annie Lansfield</strong>: I immediately called 911. Speaking of which, can I get a copy of the police report?</p>
<p>(Sofia looks at Nick and shakes her head at the girl's audacity.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Why don't you ... where is your shirt?</p>
<p>(Annie glances down at the bra she's wearing. She laughs.) </p>
<p><strong>Annie Lansfield</strong>: Right after it all went down, the baby spit up on it and I put it in the laundry.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mmm.</p>
<p><strong>Annie Lansfield</strong>: It happens all the time. (shakes her head) Nobody minds.</p>
<p>[INT. DELANCY RESIDENCE - NURSERY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Greg opens the door and walks into the nursery. He snaps photos of the baby's changing bed, crib and wall. He walks out of the nursery, through the open connecting door and into the nanny's bedroom.) </p>
<p>(He stops and snaps the contents of the photos pinned to a small bulletin board hanging on the wall. There's also a photo of Annie with Izzy.) </p>
<p>(Cut to: Greg pulls back the bed covers and uses the ALS on the sheets. He doesn't find anything and turns the ALS off.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) -MORNING]</p>
<p>[EXT. MOTEL PARKING LOT -- MORNING] </p>
<p>(Catherine is standing out in the parking lot. She turns as Sara walks up to her.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey, what's going on?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I may have been roofied and raped. I woke up here. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What?</p>
<p>(They start walking.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I, uh, improvised my own rape kit. I've got pubic combing, nail scrapings, vaginal swab, urine samples ...</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Did you call it in?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I called you.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Catherine, doing it yourself is going to make anything that you get inadmissible.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, I know procedure. I didn't want an official investigation. I-<br />
I just want to know what happened.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Okay, all right.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Uh ... I got to get this, uh, stuff to the lab. Room 229, it's right up there. Please print it. And keep it between us.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>(Catherine turns and heads to the taxi waiting nearby. She gets in the car.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. DELANCY RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM -- MORNING] </p>
<p>(Mrs. Delancy holds her hands out, palms down as Nick snaps photos.) </p>
<p><strong>Madeline Delancy</strong>: I went out for a latte. I got home around five. I never even went into the kitchen. I just went straight upstairs and took a shower.<br />
(She sighs.) God that means that he was dead this whole time.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: We believe whoever killed your husband had access to the house.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, do you think anyone else had the ... the gate code?</p>
<p><strong>Madeline Delancy</strong>: (shakes her head) Just the housekeepers. And the handymen, and the pool guys. And the gardeners, and the ... messengers and ... the caterers.</p>
<p>[INT. DELANCY RESIDENCE - MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING]</p>
<p>(Greg is in the master bedroom. He looks around and notes the photo hanging on the wall of Mrs. Delancy and Izzy, who are both holding bouquets.)</p>
<p>(Greg pulls back the bedcovers and uses the ALS on the bed.) </p>
<p>[INT. DELANCY RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM -- MORNING] </p>
<p><strong>Madeline Delancy</strong>: I can tell you where you should start looking.</p>
<p>(She nods toward someone off screen.) </p>
<p><strong>Madeline Delancy</strong>: (whispers) Sven.</p>
<p>(Nick and Sofia turn around and note the teenager sitting quietly on the couch, video game in hand and earphones on.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Are you accusing your son of killing your husband?</p>
<p>(She laughs.) </p>
<p><strong>Madeline Delancy</strong>: He is not my son. That's Izzy's kid from his first wife.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>Madeline Delancy</strong>: He has real problems. (whispers) His mom was like a cokehead or something.</p>
<p>[INT. DELANCY RESIDENCE - MASTER BEDROOM - MORNING]</p>
<p>(Greg is in Sven's bedroom. He has the ALS on and pulls back the bedcovers. He uses the ALS on the bedsheets and finds semen.) </p>
<p>[INT. DELANCY RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM -- MORNING] </p>
<p>(Sven Delancy is playing his video game.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: (o.s.) Hey, how you doing?</p>
<p>(He looks up and finds Sofia and Nick in front of him. Nick taps his ear. Sven removes his earphones.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: How you doing man?</p>
<p><strong>Sven Delancy</strong>: I've been better.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: What time did you get back from school?</p>
<p><strong>Sven Delancy</strong>: Around four.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: And then what did you do?</p>
<p><strong>Sven Delancy</strong>: Homework, games.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Did you ... see your dad at all?</p>
<p><strong>Sven Delancy</strong>: No, I usually don't see him until dinner. And then ... I get picked up right after, so.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: By who?</p>
<p><strong>Sven Delancy</strong>: My mom.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You don't live here full time?</p>
<p><strong>Sven Delancy</strong>: Tuesdays and every other Saturday.</p>
<p>(Sofia kneels in front of him.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Well, that's got to be tough. </p>
<p><strong>Sven Delancy</strong>: (shrugs) Whatever. I just go where I'm told.</p>
<p><strong>Dusty Decosta</strong>: (o.s.) Let me in, I am his mother. </p>
<p>(A woman enters the house and pushes past the officer at the door. She ignores Nick and Sofia. She sits on the armrest of Sven's chair and hugs him.) </p>
<p><strong>Dusty Decosta</strong>: (croons) I know, baby, I know. This is really hard. It's okay to be upset, okay. </p>
<p>(She holds his hand and kisses his knuckles. She notices the fingerprint ink.) </p>
<p><strong>Dusty Decosta</strong>: What's on your finger ... (She glares at Nick and Sofia.) Did you fingerprint my son?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: We fingerprinted everyone in the house, DNA samples as well.</p>
<p><strong>Dusty Decosta</strong>: Is he a suspect?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: He didn't refuse and Mrs. Delancy was here.</p>
<p><strong>Dusty Decosta</strong>: Sleeping with his father does not make her his mother, okay. I'm his mother.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Where were you this afternoon?</p>
<p><strong>Dusty Decosta</strong>: I was taking a walk.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Can anyone confirm that?</p>
<p><strong>Dusty Decosta</strong>: No.</p>
<p>(She stands up and pulls Sven up as well.) </p>
<p><strong>Dusty Decosta</strong>: (to Sven) Come on. Let's go.</p>
<p>(Dusty puts her arm around Sven's shoulders and walks out of the room with him.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. DELANCY RESIDENCE - KITCHEN -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Grissom opens the drawer in the miniature kitchen. He finds a miniature blue and white bottle of bleach in a white trash bag. This gets him thinking. He sets aside his glasses and opens the RECYCLABLE MATERIALS ONLY bin. Inside, he finds a blue and white bottle of bleach in a white trash bag.) </p>
<p>(Grissom grabs the camera off the counter and snaps a photo of it. He picks up the bottle of bleach and looks at it, quietly impressed by the detail. He turns and looks at the empty chair and blood pool on the table.) </p>
<p>(He sets the bleach down and looks over at the garbage disposal.)</p>
<p>(Grissom takes out his spray bottle and sprays the inside of the garbage disposal. He puts his goggles on and uses the ALS on the disposal. He finds bloodstains in the sink.) </p>
<p>(He continues down to the drawer. He pulls open the utensil drawer and continues on, ALSing the other drawers.)</p>
<p>(He finds stains on a drawer handle and opens it. Inside, he finds a rolling pin with bloodstains on the handle. He picks up the rolling pin and looks at it.) </p>
<p>(Greg walks into the kitchen.) </p>
<p>(Grissom puts his goggles down on the counter and turns to address Greg.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Bleach was used in this kitchen but not to clean up the blood.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: So the aging rocker bit it in the kitchen with the marble rolling pin?</p>
<p>(Grissom carries the rolling pin to the miniature. He opens the same drawer and finds the same utensils in the drawer - including a miniature marble rolling pin.) </p>
<p>(Grissom and Greg share a look.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: If only the who was as easy as the how.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - DNA LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>VARIOUS CUTS: </p>
<p>(Catherine snips a piece of the tampon and sets about processing it.) </p>
<p>(Wendy Simms walks in and startles Catherine.)</p>
<p><strong>Wendy Simms</strong>: Oh, hey. You got to be pulling a double if you're in my lab at this hour.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No. No prints, no hairs, no fibers. Materials are common hobby shop issue, but the blood matches the victim's.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Are you interested in motive? Sofia just spent the last two hours with the sheriff, the head of the Olympia Casino, and a couple of dozen lawyers. Apparently, Izzy Delancy owned the rights to his own songs. The Olympia was negotiating to purchase them for a medley show based on his music. Izzy never got a chance to sign the contracts. Dead rock star, nut job family, and a company hungry for the next Mamma Mia!</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Who inherits the music rights?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The son, Sven, but he's a minor, so the rights would be controlled by his mother, Dusty.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Its illegal to benefit from a criminal act. If either one of them committed the murder ...</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Then the rights would go to Izzy's current wife, Madeline.</p>

<p>(Ecklie walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Maybe we should release it to the media. Someone might have unwittingly made a component of the miniature. If they came forward, that could help us.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah. Yeah, he was there.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The accident was a two-man job. Can you remember anybody else?</p>
<p>(Catherine thinks about it.)</p>

Subject: More Izzy Photos. Let's talk price )</p>
<p>(She reports the findings to Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Greg found the mother lode. The nanny saved all of her e-mails on her computer. She was sending private Delancy family photos to an editor at Scandal Pages magazine. Based on a sliding scale of salaciousness, Scandal Pages was depositing money into Annie's Paypal account. </p>
<p>(She scrolls through the photos and the Scandal Pages website.) </p>
<p>(Wendy Simms walks in with DNA results.) </p>
<p><strong>Wendy Simms</strong>: So I have the DNA combo from Sven's bed sheets, and none of it was actually Sven's.</p>
<p>(She hands the results to Grissom.)</p>

[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM] </p>
<p>(Sofia interviews Annie Lansfield.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Annie Lansfield, Cornstalk Queen of Tidioute, Pennsylvania. You move to Vegas to become famous and ended up doing diaper duty for a washed-up rock star. Do you want to tell me how you ended up in a safe that even his wife didn't know about?</p>
<p><strong>Annie Lansfield</strong>: I clean for extra cash. I know the house better than anyone. I knew where the safe was. I just didn't have a key, until ...</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Madeline talks with Izzy at the kitchen table. They're sitting opposite each other while Annie holds the baby and sits at the far end of the table.) </p>
<p><strong>Madeline Delancy</strong>: Honey, I need some money to buy clothes for Emma.</p>
<p><strong>Izzy Delancy</strong>: I just gave you money for that.</p>
<p><strong>Madeline Delancy</strong>: She's a baby. She grows. You know, this wouldn't even be an issue if you would sign those damn contracts.</p>
<p><strong>Izzy Delancy</strong>: Really? Well, that is between me and my music. And you, you will never see this safe.</p>
<p>(He takes the safe key out and puts it in his mouth. He drinks some water and swallows the key. He laughs maniacally.) </p>
<p><strong>Izzy Delancy</strong>: Gold digger! Dig for that!</p>
<p>(Annie watches the exchange with interest.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume present.)</p>
<p>(Annie chuckles.)</p>
<p><strong>Annie Lansfield</strong>: The ER doctor said it would pass in a couple of days. They gave us a copy of the x-ray to keep on file with the general physician. It had the perfect outline of the key. (shrugs) So, I took the x-ray to a key shop, told them my kid swallowed it.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Resourceful.</p>
<p><strong>Annie Lansfield</strong>: But I put everything back. </p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: After making Scandal Pages money off it.</p>
<p><strong>Annie Lansfield</strong>: Look, a few years ago, Izzy went on this big health kick -- vegetarian, blah, blah. He claimed that all those chicken heads that he bit on stage were fake. When I found them, I was just so excited. Do you know how much Scandal Pages pays for an urban legend story? A lot.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Here's a scandal: We got evidence of s*x between you and Izzy Delancy in Sven's bed. Or how about this: If you killed him, you'd be the first to crack open that whole story.</p>
<p>(Sofia puts the crime scene photo on the table in front of Annie.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Exclusive pics, the whole deal.</p>
<p><strong>Annie Lansfield</strong>: It took 911 a while to come. I just got a quick pic. You said it-- I'm resourceful, not a murderer. I didn't do it.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - A/V LAB] </p>
<p>(Greg and Sara sit and watch a program. Various photos of Izzy Delancy flash on the monitor, then the title card for the show: AFTER THE HITS.) </p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong>: (from program) After the Hits. The Izzy Delancy story. It seemed like a fairy tale. Hard living rocker Izzy Delancy met Dusty Decosta. They fell in love. He wrote a hit song about her. She was to become his first wife ... or was she? In a potentially shocking display of distrust and business acumen, -- </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (to Greg) Where did you find this?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Oh, I dug deep.</p>
<p><strong>Narrator</strong>: (from program) -- Izzy Delancy, after ten years of dating Dusty Decosta, wed her in a beautiful, flower-filled ceremony in Malaysia. The ceremony was everything a girl could hope for -- beautiful, romantic. The only thing it wasn't? Legal. Much to Dusty's surprise, years later, after filing for divorce and custody of their then eight-year-old son, Sven, she was shocked to discover that the Malaysian shaman was not recognized by the United States as an officiant. The marriage was a sham. </p>
<p>(Sara is surprised.) </p>
<p>(Greg stops the program.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Sounds like motive to me.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. DECOSTA RESIDENCE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Dusty Decosta opens the door and finds Sara and Sofia standing outside.) </p>
<p><strong>Dusty Decosta</strong>: Oh. Hi. Listen, you're going to have to follow me 'cause I'm late for a client.</p>
<p>(She turns and heads inside. Sara and Sofia follow.) </p>
<p><strong>Dusty Decosta</strong>: What is it you want?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: We were wondering if you could tell us about your relationship with Izzy?</p>
<p>(She stops in front of her worktable.) </p>
<p><strong>Dusty Decosta</strong>: (groans) Oh, God. So I'm a suspect now? That's precious. Okay. The man makes a mint off of singing about our s*x life, barely offers a relationship to our son, kicks me out of a house we built together, leaves me with nothing, and now you want to put me in jail? Rich. Really rich.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Izzy was a smart businessman. He owned all the rights to his music.</p>
<p><strong>Dusty Decosta</strong>: What does that matter to me? Do I get royalty checks for being his muse.</p>
<p>(She chuckles wryly.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Exactly. But with Izzy dead, the rights go to Sven. Ostensibly you.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: And you still don't an alibi for the afternoon of Izzy's death.</p>
<p><strong>Dusty Decosta</strong>: I do. (sighs) It's just embarrassing to me. The &quot;new&quot; Mrs. Delancy called a meeting. She tells me about the Olympia offer. Izzy's being difficult about the deal, so would I talk to him because he listens to me still.</p>
<p>(She scoffs.)</p>
<p><strong>Dusty Decosta</strong>: Had he started sleeping with the nanny yet?</p>
<p><strong>Sara/Sofia</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Dusty Decosta</strong>: Did Madeline tell you that was her old job?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No. SOFIA: No.</p>
<p><strong>Dusty Decosta</strong>: Look, I'd like to pin it on her, I really would, but I can't because I was with her at the Espresso Drop all afternoon. I really have to go.</p>
<p>(Sara notices some half-inch scaled drawings on the table.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What are those drawings on the table?</p>
<p>(She turns and picks up the drawings.) </p>
<p><strong>Dusty Decosta</strong>: Oh, those are Sven's. Some mothers get sport trophies; I get perfectly rendered skyscrapers. He wants to be an urban planner. He's kind of obsessed with models. You guys let yourself out, okay?</p>
<p>(Dusty leaves.) </p>
<p>(Sara and Sofia share a look.)</p>

[INT. DELANCY RESIDENCE - SVEN'S ROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(Sara and Sofia walk into the room and notice the various scaled drawings hanging on the walls and on the desk.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: If Sven is capable of creating these kinds of 3-D renderings, he definitely could've built that miniature.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Son defending the honor of his mother?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Name that Greek tragedy.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Sofia interviews Sven Delancy. An advocate sits at the back of the room.) </p>
<p><strong>Sven Delancy</strong>: Yes, I'm angry with my father for the way he treated my mother. I'm angry with my father for sleeping with Annie. I'm angry with my father for naming me Sven. But I've been in therapy twice a week since I was six. I'm tired of adults asking me if I'm angry. Besides, I'm ... I'm not the only one who's pissed at my dad.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Right, but your mom and Madeline are covered. They were together at the time of your father's death.</p>
<p>(She shows him a security cam photo of Dusty Decosta and Madeline Delancy at the Espresso Drop.)</p>
<p>(Sven swallows.)</p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[OBSERVATION ROOM]</p>
<p>(Grissom and Sara watch the interview.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: (from intercom) So maybe you were so angry with your father that you channeled your anger and used your skills as a model builder to build this.</p>
<p>(She puts a photo of the model on the table in front of Sven. Sven's very quiet and surprised as he looks a the photo of the model.)</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: And a nice ... heavy object to do this.</p>
<p>(She puts another crime scene photo on the table of Izzy dead, his head in a pool of blood.) </p>
<p>(Sven looks at the photos of his dad in the blood. His eyes roll back and he loses consciousness.) </p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong>: (o.s.) Sven? Sven!</p>
<p>(Sofia stops the advocate from getting too close. She watches Sven as he slowly slides down his chair.)</p>
<p>(In the observation room, Grissom and Sara share a look.) </p>
<p>(After a moment, Sven wakes up and sits up.) </p>
<p><strong>Sven</strong>: I always faint at the sight of blood.</p>
<p>(The interview continues in the background. Sara discusses with Grissom what it means to their case.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: If that's the case, he probably did not commit the murder and he certainly didn't paint the miniature with his father's blood.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And there's a test we can do to prove it.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. HOSPITAL -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Sven is on a tilt table in the room. Outside, Grissom explains the test to Dusty Decosta. A nurse inside the room preps a needle for Sven.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We're using a tilt table and we're injecting him with isoproterenol. We're testing his sensitivity to his vagus nerve. Basically, we're looking to find out if the nerves that control his blood pressure are predisposed to short circuit when he gets an adrenaline rush.</p>
<p><strong>Dusty Decosta</strong>: So, you're telling me that this could keep him out of jail?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Unless he was faking it.</p>
<p>(Sven turns and looks at his mom.) </p>
<p>(Dusty sighs and looks at Sven.)</p>
<p>VARIOUS CUTS OF THE TEST IN PROGRESS</p>
<p>(The orderlies tilt the table. The heart monitor beeps.)</p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong>: Start the IV.</p>
<p>(The nurse injects the solution into the IV. The heart monitor beeps rapidly. Sven's eyes roll back and he passes out.) </p>

<p>(Grissom looks up.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I hear we're out of suspects.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Not necessarily. Could be anybody in town. Or anybody out of town for that matter. That's a lot of suspects.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What do you want us to do?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I don't know.</p>
<p>(He puts his glasses on. Sara watches him.) </p>

<p><strong>Wendy Simms</strong>: I ran DNA on the guy who was holding Lindsey.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Did you get a name?</p>
<p><strong>Wendy Simms</strong>: Um, kind of. See, this guy has markers that are found in, like, ten percent of the population, which reminded me of some other results that I'd been processing recently.</p>
<p>(She shows the results to Catherine.) </p>

<p>BACK TO SCENE.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The guy who grabbed Lindsey is Robert O'Brien's brother?</p>
<p><strong>Wendy Simms</strong>: Right. So when that came up, I ran all the other exemplars from the O'Brien case, and I got a hit on a piece of hair from the duct tape that they used to bind Lindsey.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Everybody in town knows you're here every Thursday night. And usually with my mother.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: (to the blonde) I'll be right along.</p>
<p>(The woman steps away.) </p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: She doesn't mean a thing. It's all show. Look, Muggs, yesterday was ...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (interrupts) Just save it. I only came here to tell you to call off your guys.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: I don't know what you're talking about.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Joe Hirschoff and his partner invested everything they had in the Eclipse. But it went bankrupt before you broke ground. You formed a new corporation to finish the project, leaving those guys with nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: Sometimes that's the way it goes in business.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (nods) Uh-huh. O'Brien and Hirschoff lost $20 million, right? O'Brien caved and stuck a gun in his mouth. Hirschoff wants you to pay him back. So, where is he?</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Come on, Sam, this isn't old Vegas anymore. Let the police handle it. Or have you already killed him?</p>
<p>(He chuckles. Behind him, we see Joe Hirschoff walking up to them, his right hand hidden behind his back.)</p>

<p>(Grissom puts the scope down and puts his glasses back on. He uses the tweezers and picks up the framed photo. It's very, very tiny.) </p>
<p>(He flips the frame around and sees something. He uses a hand-held magnifying glass to look at it.)</p>
<p>(He finds a laser-etched picture of what looks like a portion of a doll's face - one green left eye and red blood on its forehead. The detail is amazing. A closer look at the photo of the doll's eye has us seeing her individual top and bottom eye lashes.) </p>

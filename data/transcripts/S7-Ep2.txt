Desk Clerk:  Yeah, that's my real photo on my profile.
 
Catherine: Excuse me.
 
Desk Clerk:  Well, I exercise a lot. Kind of an animal about it.

BACK TO SCENE.
 
Desk Clerk: Hey. 
Catherine: Did you see me last night?
Desk Clerk: Yeah, you were feeling no pain.
Catherine: Who was I with? Describe him. Was he white, black, tall? Hair color, car?
Desk Clerk: Look, lady, I get paid not to notice.
 
Catherine: Who was room 229 registered to?
 
Desk Clerk: Catherine Willows. You used your credit card.
 

 
 
Sara: I think Malibu Barbie did it.
 
Grissom: Well, then there's a lot more to Barbie than just a pretty face, 'cause this is a perfect half-inch scale model of the room. And assuming that the killer is the same person who made the miniature ... 
Sara: -- it would of taken weeks. Maybe even months to create with this kind of detail.
 
Sara: Certainly qualifies as premeditation.
 
Grissom: Yeah, but take a look at the blood pools.
Sara: They're identical.
Grissom: There's no predicting a blood pool; it's inherently random.
Sara: Killer must of stuck around to match the scene.
 
Grissom: It's real blood.

BACK TO SCENE.
Sara: That is a level of obsession that gives even you a run for your money.
 
Sara: &quot;If Dusty Fell,&quot; Izzy Delancy. 
Grissom: It's his biggest hit.
 
Sara: I have never heard of him.
Grissom: Probably before your time.
Sara: I'll download it.  I checked the perimeter; property is gated with a code. There is no sign of forced entry on the windows or the doors. Of course if a girl can get into Brad Pitt's underwear drawer and take a nap on his bed, I guess anything is possible.
 
Sara: Lividity suggests he hasn't been moved. He was probably sitting right here when he was killed.
 
Sara: Looks like blunt force trauma.
 
Sara: No spatter or cast off.

 
Sara:  Which suggests a single blow ... 
BACK TO SCENE.
 
Grissom: Sometimes it only takes one hit.

Sara: Oh, great, you're here. Thanks for coming.
Greg: I can't believe you're leaving Izzy Delancy's death scene. Groupies are already starting to gather.
Sara: I have something that I have to take care of. Nick and Sofia are talking to the family, Grissom's s in the kitchen. You can process the bedrooms? Thanks. 
 
 
Fan: Izzy!

 
 
Sofia: Mrs. Delancy?

Annie Lansfield: No, that's Mrs. Delancy.  I'm Annie, the nanny.
Nick: I'm going to need to photograph your hands.
Annie Lansfield: To look for blood, right?
Nick: Blood evidence, yeah, and defensive wounds. I'm also going to get a sample of your DNA and your fingerprints. So, why don't you hand little Nora to her mom for right now, okay?
Annie Lansfield:  No, Mrs. D never holds the baby.
 She's got a bad back.
 

Annie Lansfield: I should warn you, I'm a little freaked. When I get nervous or scared or whatever I have this problem where I talk a lot. I've had it since I was little. I just keep talking ...
Sofia:  You found the body?
 
Annie Lansfield: Tuesday is Chinese. Izzy insists ... on having ... a really strict eating schedule. I have to start cooking by 4:00 and when I went into the kitchen ...
 
Annie Lansfield:  Baby's don't eat bok choy. Yeah, wonder what you're going to have for --
 
 

Annie Lansfield: I immediately called 911. Speaking of which, can I get a copy of the police report?

Nick: Why don't you ... where is your shirt?
 
Annie Lansfield: Right after it all went down, the baby spit up on it and I put it in the laundry.
Nick: Mmm.
Annie Lansfield: It happens all the time.  Nobody minds.
 
 
 
 


 
 
Sara: Hey, what's going on?
Catherine: I may have been roofied and raped. I woke up here. 
Sara: What?
 
Catherine: I, uh, improvised my own rape kit. I've got pubic combing, nail scrapings, vaginal swab, urine samples ...
Sara: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Did you call it in?
Catherine: I called you.
Sara: Catherine, doing it yourself is going to make anything that you get inadmissible.
Catherine: Yeah, I know procedure. I didn't want an official investigation. I-
I just want to know what happened.
Sara: Okay, all right.
Catherine: Uh ... I got to get this, uh, stuff to the lab. Room 229, it's right up there. Please print it. And keep it between us.
Sara: Okay.
Catherine: Thanks.


 
 
Madeline Delancy: I went out for a latte. I got home around five. I never even went into the kitchen. I just went straight upstairs and took a shower.
 God that means that he was dead this whole time.
Sofia: We believe whoever killed your husband had access to the house.
Nick: Yeah, do you think anyone else had the ... the gate code?
Madeline Delancy:  Just the housekeepers. And the handymen, and the pool guys. And the gardeners, and the ... messengers and ... the caterers.


 
 
Madeline Delancy: I can tell you where you should start looking.
 
Madeline Delancy:  Sven.
 
Nick: Are you accusing your son of killing your husband?
 
Madeline Delancy: He is not my son. That's Izzy's kid from his first wife.
Nick: Oh.
Madeline Delancy: He has real problems.  His mom was like a cokehead or something.

 
 
 
Sofia:  Hey, how you doing?
 
Nick: How you doing man?
Sven Delancy: I've been better.
Sofia: What time did you get back from school?
Sven Delancy: Around four.
Sofia: And then what did you do?
Sven Delancy: Homework, games.
Sofia: Did you ... see your dad at all?
Sven Delancy: No, I usually don't see him until dinner. And then ... I get picked up right after, so.
Nick: By who?
Sven Delancy: My mom.
Nick: You don't live here full time?
Sven Delancy: Tuesdays and every other Saturday.
 
Sofia: Well, that's got to be tough. 
Sven Delancy:  Whatever. I just go where I'm told.
Dusty Decosta:  Let me in, I am his mother. 
 
Dusty Decosta:  I know, baby, I know. This is really hard. It's okay to be upset, okay. 
 
Dusty Decosta: What's on your finger ...  Did you fingerprint my son?
Nick: We fingerprinted everyone in the house, DNA samples as well.
Dusty Decosta: Is he a suspect?
Sofia: He didn't refuse and Mrs. Delancy was here.
Dusty Decosta: Sleeping with his father does not make her his mother, okay. I'm his mother.
Sofia: Where were you this afternoon?
Dusty Decosta: I was taking a walk.
Sofia: Can anyone confirm that?
Dusty Decosta: No.
 
Dusty Decosta:  Come on. Let's go.
 

 
 
 

 

 
 
 
Grissom: Bleach was used in this kitchen but not to clean up the blood.
Greg: So the aging rocker bit it in the kitchen with the marble rolling pin?
 
 
Grissom: If only the who was as easy as the how.

 

 

Wendy Simms: Oh, hey. You got to be pulling a double if you're in my lab at this hour.
Catherine: Yeah.
Wendy Simms: What's up? You need a hand?
Catherine: No. Thanks.
 
Wendy Simms: Oh. ABA card. It's negative for semen.
Catherine: I said I didn't need your help.


 
Hodges: Oh, thank you, but there's no drinking or eating allowed in the lab.
Catherine: It's a urine sample.
Hodges: My bad.
Catherine: Get it to Tox. And ...  Check this for spermicide. Call me with the results.
 
Hodges: Did you run out of proper swabs?
Catherine: Just do it.
Hodges: What's the case number?
Catherine: Consider this a proficiency exam.
(Catherine walks out of the lab and into the -- 
 
 
Woman: There she is.
Sam Braun: Muggs?
 
Catherine: Sam. What are you doing here?
Sam Braun: Just wanted to see your face, and I missed you at the implosion party.
Catherine: Oh, yeah. I heard about that, um ... I'm sorry I missed that. 
 
Sam Braun: When's Lily get back from her cruise?
Catherine: Monday.
Sam Braun: How about a family dinner?
Catherine: Uh, yeah, I'll call you when she's had a chance to catch her breath.
Sam Braun: You know you don't always need a reason to call me. I know you're busy.  I'll see you later.
 


 
Voices: 
Knows how to get what she wants
knows how to get what she needs, yeah, yeah
yeah, she knows just how to play, what to say 
 

Grissom &amp; Robbins:  make you give her anything 

 
Grissom: Cause of death?
Robbins: 
Blunt force trauma
to the back of the skull
and a fracturing of the occipital lobe
there was massive hemorrhaging on the brain
and death was probably swift
yeah!
 
Grissom: Sorry, Izzy. Now ... 
 
Grissom: What is that?

 
Grissom: The key to our mystery?





 
 
Catherine: Keep the change.
 
 

 
 

 
BACK TO SCENE.
 
Catherine: Excuse me.
 
Bartender: What can I do you for?
Catherine: You were working last night.
Bartender: Always. I own the place.
Catherine: Do you remember me? I was ... I was here.
Bartender: Was a busy night, I'm sorry.
 
Catherine: Well ... do you have any surveillance cameras in the place?
Bartender: What's this about?

Catherine: I'm with the Crime Lab.
 
Bartender: Yeah, that's the only one. Just gets the cash register.
Catherine: So you've got nothing that covers the customers or the dance floor, or ... ?
Bartender: No need to.
 

 
BACK TO SCENE.



 
 
 

 
Sara: Find something?
 
Grissom: No. No prints, no hairs, no fibers. Materials are common hobby shop issue, but the blood matches the victim's.
Sara: Are you interested in motive? Sofia just spent the last two hours with the sheriff, the head of the Olympia Casino, and a couple of dozen lawyers. Apparently, Izzy Delancy owned the rights to his own songs. The Olympia was negotiating to purchase them for a medley show based on his music. Izzy never got a chance to sign the contracts. Dead rock star, nut job family, and a company hungry for the next Mamma Mia!
Grissom: Who inherits the music rights?
Sara: The son, Sven, but he's a minor, so the rights would be controlled by his mother, Dusty.
Grissom: Its illegal to benefit from a criminal act. If either one of them committed the murder ...
Sara: Then the rights would go to Izzy's current wife, Madeline.
Grissom: Well, that's motive for her. But how does this fit in?

 
Conrad Ecklie: Maybe we should release it to the media. Someone might have unwittingly made a component of the miniature. If they came forward, that could help us.
Grissom: What's the point of gratifying the murderer with publicity?
Conrad Ecklie: Izzy Delancy is famous; the press wants answers.
Grissom: Don't we all?
Conrad Ecklie: Sara, this is your case, too -- what do you think?
Sara: I, uh ... I agree with Grissom.
Conrad Ecklie:  Of course you do.
 



 
 
Greg: I looked into the key that Izzy swallowed. Turns out that Bumblebee is a safe company. Sofia asked Madeline about it. She says she knew that there was a safe in the house but didn't know where it was -- my kind of marriage.
Grissom: So the key could've been in his system anywhere from a few minutes to several days?
Greg: Right. So if robbery was the motive for murder and Izzy swallowed the key to keep something hidden, maybe whatever is in that safe will lead us to who.

Catherine: Lindsey. I really am sorry. I hate it when work gets in the way. I love to watch you dance.
 
Lindsey: Fine. Whatever.  I got a solo.

Paramedic Rivers: Ma'am, you need to put this on, for your own safety. 
Catherine: No -- 
Paramedic Rivers: You suffered a head trauma. There could be serious delayed problems.
Catherine: I'm refusing treatment. Just give me the release form.
Paramedic Rivers: Ma'am, I strongly recommend you put this on ...
 
Catherine:  Just give me the damn form!
Warrick: Hey, hey, hey. Catherine.

Catherine: They got Lindsey. Warrick: I know.
 
Catherine: They took Lindsey.
Warrick: It's all over the radio. I heard.
Catherine: It was an SUV. And it was silver or brown.
Warrick: We're gonna get Lindsey back, okay?
 
Catherine: And they drove that direction. I never saw it coming.
Warrick: Okay.
 
Catherine: They came from this direction.
Warrick: Slow down, slow down.

Catherine: These are acceleration marks. They were waiting for us.

 
 
Catherine: I should've told you, but I didn't want a sermon. I did my own rape kit. Came back negative.
Grissom: Thank God. These events have to be connected. We'll check your old cases for possible suspects. I'll ask Ecklie if he can kick in some help from day shift.
Catherine: I appreciate that.
Grissom: You've got to stay at arm's length, Catherine.
Catherine:  I-I know.
 

 
Catherine: Any luck on the prints?
Nick: Nothing but partials.
Catherine: That's impossible.
Nick: I ran the VIN number on the cougar that hit you. A place sold it yesterday for cash. Catherine, I'm really sorry for leaving you there.
Catherine: Don't go there, Nick. They were gonna get to me, one way or another. It had to have been at least two guys -- one who was driving the Cougar, and the other in the SUV.

Sam Braun:  When were you going to tell me about Lindsey?
Catherine:  It just happened. Who told you?
Sam Braun:  It's a small town, Catherine.
Catherine:  Well, I can't talk right now. I'll let you know when we find something out.
Sam Braun:  Anything you need to tell me, I've got people who deal with this stuff. Nobody gets away with threatening my family.
Catherine:  Sure, Sam.
 


 
 
Catherine: Sam!
 
Catherine: What do you know about what happened to Lindsey?
 
Sam Braun: What do you know about it?
Catherine: Who's using us to get to you? This is your granddaughter we're talking about. What the hell do you know?
 
Sam Braun: Front desk found this in the quick checkout bin.

Catherine: &quot;Can you guess what you're going to give me&quot; What does that mean? Who's behind this?
Sam Braun: I don't know. This was just found. Same place.

Catherine: Where is she? Who has her?
Sam Braun: I swear, I don't know.
Catherine: Like hell! I blame you! I blame you for this!
Sam Braun: I never wanted to involve you personally or professionally in any of my business.
Catherine: Business? You don't have a business. You're a thug in thousand dollar shoes!

Warrick: Catherine, I know this is really hard, okay, but could you take a break or get a cup of tea or something here?
 
Nick: Think I got something.
Catherine: What?
Nick: Mandy ran the print that I picked up from your car, and it's a match to an open burglary case, from a few months ago. I think this was yours, Warrick.
 
Warrick:  I got it.

(Sara is scrolling through the e-mails from
From: &lt;Annie Lansfield&gt;
Sent: 9:05 PM
To: ScandalPages.com
Subject: More Izzy Photos. Let's talk price )
 
Sara: Greg found the mother lode. The nanny saved all of her e-mails on her computer. She was sending private Delancy family photos to an editor at Scandal Pages magazine. Based on a sliding scale of salaciousness, Scandal Pages was depositing money into Annie's Paypal account. 
 
 
Wendy Simms: So I have the DNA combo from Sven's bed sheets, and none of it was actually Sven's.


Sara: Whoa.

 
 
Sofia: Annie Lansfield, Cornstalk Queen of Tidioute, Pennsylvania. You move to Vegas to become famous and ended up doing diaper duty for a washed-up rock star. Do you want to tell me how you ended up in a safe that even his wife didn't know about?
Annie Lansfield: I clean for extra cash. I know the house better than anyone. I knew where the safe was. I just didn't have a key, until ...
 
Madeline Delancy: Honey, I need some money to buy clothes for Emma.
Izzy Delancy: I just gave you money for that.
Madeline Delancy: She's a baby. She grows. You know, this wouldn't even be an issue if you would sign those damn contracts.
Izzy Delancy: Really? Well, that is between me and my music. And you, you will never see this safe.
 
Izzy Delancy: Gold digger! Dig for that!



Annie Lansfield: The ER doctor said it would pass in a couple of days. They gave us a copy of the x-ray to keep on file with the general physician. It had the perfect outline of the key.  So, I took the x-ray to a key shop, told them my kid swallowed it.
Sofia: Resourceful.
Annie Lansfield: But I put everything back. 
Sofia: After making Scandal Pages money off it.
Annie Lansfield: Look, a few years ago, Izzy went on this big health kick -- vegetarian, blah, blah. He claimed that all those chicken heads that he bit on stage were fake. When I found them, I was just so excited. Do you know how much Scandal Pages pays for an urban legend story? A lot.
Sofia: Here's a scandal: We got evidence of s*x between you and Izzy Delancy in Sven's bed. Or how about this: If you killed him, you'd be the first to crack open that whole story.
 
Sofia: Exclusive pics, the whole deal.
Annie Lansfield: It took 911 a while to come. I just got a quick pic. You said it-- I'm resourceful, not a murderer. I didn't do it.

 
 
Narrator:  After the Hits. The Izzy Delancy story. It seemed like a fairy tale. Hard living rocker Izzy Delancy met Dusty Decosta. They fell in love. He wrote a hit song about her. She was to become his first wife ... or was she? In a potentially shocking display of distrust and business acumen, -- 
Sara:  Where did you find this?
Greg: Oh, I dug deep.
Narrator:  -- Izzy Delancy, after ten years of dating Dusty Decosta, wed her in a beautiful, flower-filled ceremony in Malaysia. The ceremony was everything a girl could hope for -- beautiful, romantic. The only thing it wasn't? Legal. Much to Dusty's surprise, years later, after filing for divorce and custody of their then eight-year-old son, Sven, she was shocked to discover that the Malaysian shaman was not recognized by the United States as an officiant. The marriage was a sham. 
 
 
Greg: Sounds like motive to me.

 
 
Dusty Decosta: Oh. Hi. Listen, you're going to have to follow me 'cause I'm late for a client.
 
Dusty Decosta: What is it you want?
Sofia: We were wondering if you could tell us about your relationship with Izzy?
 
Dusty Decosta:  Oh, God. So I'm a suspect now? That's precious. Okay. The man makes a mint off of singing about our s*x life, barely offers a relationship to our son, kicks me out of a house we built together, leaves me with nothing, and now you want to put me in jail? Rich. Really rich.
Sofia: Izzy was a smart businessman. He owned all the rights to his music.
Dusty Decosta: What does that matter to me? Do I get royalty checks for being his muse.

Sara: Exactly. But with Izzy dead, the rights go to Sven. Ostensibly you.
Sofia: And you still don't an alibi for the afternoon of Izzy's death.
Dusty Decosta: I do.  It's just embarrassing to me. The &quot;new&quot; Mrs. Delancy called a meeting. She tells me about the Olympia offer. Izzy's being difficult about the deal, so would I talk to him because he listens to me still.

Dusty Decosta: Had he started sleeping with the nanny yet?
Sara/Sofia: Yeah.
Dusty Decosta: Did Madeline tell you that was her old job?
Sara: No. SOFIA: No.
Dusty Decosta: Look, I'd like to pin it on her, I really would, but I can't because I was with her at the Espresso Drop all afternoon. I really have to go.
 
Sara: What are those drawings on the table?
 
Dusty Decosta: Oh, those are Sven's. Some mothers get sport trophies; I get perfectly rendered skyscrapers. He wants to be an urban planner. He's kind of obsessed with models. You guys let yourself out, okay?
 



 
Sara: If Sven is capable of creating these kinds of 3-D renderings, he definitely could've built that miniature.
Sofia: Son defending the honor of his mother?
Sara: Name that Greek tragedy.

 
 
Sven Delancy: Yes, I'm angry with my father for the way he treated my mother. I'm angry with my father for sleeping with Annie. I'm angry with my father for naming me Sven. But I've been in therapy twice a week since I was six. I'm tired of adults asking me if I'm angry. Besides, I'm ... I'm not the only one who's pissed at my dad.
Sofia: Right, but your mom and Madeline are covered. They were together at the time of your father's death.




 
Sofia:  So maybe you were so angry with your father that you channeled your anger and used your skills as a model builder to build this.

Sofia: And a nice ... heavy object to do this.
 
 
Voice:  Sven? Sven!

 
 
Sven: I always faint at the sight of blood.
 
Sara: If that's the case, he probably did not commit the murder and he certainly didn't paint the miniature with his father's blood.
Grissom: And there's a test we can do to prove it.

 
 
Grissom: We're using a tilt table and we're injecting him with isoproterenol. We're testing his sensitivity to his vagus nerve. Basically, we're looking to find out if the nerves that control his blood pressure are predisposed to short circuit when he gets an adrenaline rush.
Dusty Decosta: So, you're telling me that this could keep him out of jail?
Grissom: Unless he was faking it.
 

VARIOUS CUTS OF THE TEST IN PROGRESS

Voice: Start the IV.
 




 
 
 
Sara: I hear we're out of suspects.
Grissom: Not necessarily. Could be anybody in town. Or anybody out of town for that matter. That's a lot of suspects.
Sara: What do you want us to do?
Grissom: I don't know.
 
Grissom: I'll deal with it.
 

 
 
Wendy Simms: I ran DNA on the guy who was holding Lindsey.
Catherine: Did you get a name?
Wendy Simms: Um, kind of. See, this guy has markers that are found in, like, ten percent of the population, which reminded me of some other results that I'd been processing recently.
 
Catherine: Thirteen alleles in common with Robert O'Brien?
Wendy Simms: The suicide from Sam Braun's implosion party.
INSERT: FLASHBACK OF

BACK TO SCENE.
Catherine: The guy who grabbed Lindsey is Robert O'Brien's brother?
Wendy Simms: Right. So when that came up, I ran all the other exemplars from the O'Brien case, and I got a hit on a piece of hair from the duct tape that they used to bind Lindsey.
 
Catherine: Joe Hirschoff. O'Brien's partner.


 
 
Catherine: Hi, Sam.

Catherine: Everybody in town knows you're here every Thursday night. And usually with my mother.
Sam Braun:  I'll be right along.
 
Sam Braun: She doesn't mean a thing. It's all show. Look, Muggs, yesterday was ...
Catherine:  Just save it. I only came here to tell you to call off your guys.
Sam Braun: I don't know what you're talking about.
Catherine: Joe Hirschoff and his partner invested everything they had in the Eclipse. But it went bankrupt before you broke ground. You formed a new corporation to finish the project, leaving those guys with nothing.
Sam Braun: Sometimes that's the way it goes in business.
Catherine:  Uh-huh. O'Brien and Hirschoff lost $20 million, right? O'Brien caved and stuck a gun in his mouth. Hirschoff wants you to pay him back. So, where is he?
Sam Braun: I don't know.
Catherine: Come on, Sam, this isn't old Vegas anymore. Let the police handle it. Or have you already killed him?

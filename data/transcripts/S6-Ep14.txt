<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[EXT. ALLEYWAY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(A man walks through the alleyway. He stops midway and drops the cigarette he's smoking down on the concrete pavement. He smashes the butt out with the toe of his right foot.) </p>
<p>(He takes a couple of steps, turns, then reaches down to pick up the cigarette butt. He pockets the butt, then continues walking quickly through the alleyway.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. BUILDING -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The man in the jacket climbs up the fire escape stairs to a building behind a large screen billboard.)</p>
<p>(He reaches the room he's looking for and stops. He slips a thin, long piece of metal through the crack in the window and pushes the latch open.)</p>
<p>[EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NASH'S ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(The man climbs through the open window and into the bedroom where a man is sleeping. The lamp on the bedside table is on.) </p>
<p>(Karl Cooper shuts the window closed, picks up a chair and puts it down near the bed. He sits down, places his foot on the bed and unmercifully shakes it, waking the sleeping man.) </p>
<p><strong>Clayton Nash</strong>: Red. Hey. (He chuckles nervously.) You look good, man. It's been a while, hasn't it? Haven't seen you forever. Of course, you know that better than anybody.</p>
<p>(&quot;Red&quot; doesn't say anything.) </p>
<p><strong>Clayton Nash</strong>: I'm ... surprised to see you here. Actually, you know what, I'm not that surprised. Listen, I'm glad you dropped by, 'cause there's something I've been meaning to talk to you about. </p>
<p>(&quot;Red&quot; raises his gun and points it at Nash.) </p>
<p><strong>Clayton Nash</strong>: You know, I-I just wanted to say ...</p>
<p>(He fires twice and hits Nash in the chest.) </p>
<p>(&quot;Red&quot; gets up and walks close to Nash. He fires again.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT - 2:36 A.M.]</p>
<p>(&quot;Red&quot; heads for his parked car. He gets inside and fastens his seat belt. He adjusts the rearview mirror. It's 2:36 A.M. He flips the radio on to FM1 station 87.9.)</p>
<p>(He starts the car engine and drives out of the alleyway.) </p>
<p>[INT. CAR (MOVING) - LATE NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The light a the end of the alley is red. &quot;Red&quot; stops. The light turns green. As he drives across the intersection, a second car zooms out of nowhere and hits him on the side.)</p>
<p>(The two cars stop.)</p>
<p>(Ally Sullivan gasps as her airbag inflates upon impact.) </p>
<p><strong>Ally Sullivan</strong>: Oh, my God! Oh, my God!</p>
<p>(She gets out of the car to check on the other driver. She stumbles out of her car, obviously a little drunk.) </p>
<p><strong>Ally Sullivan</strong>: Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</p>
<p>(&quot;Red&quot; groans.) </p>
<p><strong>Ally Sullivan</strong>: Are you ... are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>Karl Cooper</strong>: Huh? (He looks at her.) Yeah, yeah, I'm ... I'm okay. I'm okay.</p>
<p>(He opens the car door and groans as he gets out.) </p>
<p><strong>Ally Sullivan</strong>: I-I am so sorry. I was on the phone, and I was going too fast, and I just ... </p>
<p>(&quot;Red&quot; stands up and doesn't look too good.) </p>
<p><strong>Ally Sullivan</strong>: Oh, God, um ... I'm going to call 911, and I'm going get you an ambulance.</p>
<p><strong>Karl Cooper</strong>: I'm fine, honest, I am.</p>
<p><strong>Ally Sullivan</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Karl Cooper</strong>: Really, it's nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Ally Sullivan</strong>: At least, can I just ... I'm going to call the police and make a police report.</p>
<p><strong>Karl Cooper</strong>: I'd really rather you not do that. I'll tell you why. I don't, uh, I don't have any insurance.</p>
<p><strong>Ally Sullivan</strong>: No, no, no. That's okay. I do. Look, it was my fault; I know that. And that is exactly what I will tell them. My dad just said, if I ever got into an accident that I had to make a police report.</p>
<p><strong>Karl Cooper</strong>: Can I tell you something, sweetheart? You're drunk right now, okay? And you hit me. Now, that's a DUI, and if you call the police, they're going to take your license away, and they're going to throw you in jail. Now, what I'd like you to do is get in your car, drive yourself home and forget that this ever happened. Can you do that?</p>
<p>(She hesitates.) </p>
<p><strong>Karl Cooper</strong>: I'm fine. Go on. I'm fine, honest, I promise. You go.</p>
<p><strong>Ally Sullivan</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(Ally Sullivan turns and heads back to her car. Karl Cooper turns, groans as he heads back to his car.)</p>
<p>(Through the side view mirror, he sees Ally take out her cell phone and dial.)</p>
<p>(He closes his eyes and shakes his head. He turns around as he makes a decision.) </p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO: </p>
<p>[EXT. ROADWAY - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Cameras flash as photos are taken of Ally Sullivan's dead body.) </p>
<p>(Grissom and Sara stand nearby as David Phillips kneels down next to the body, writing on a clipboard. Brass stands just behind David Phillips.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Her name is Ally Sullivan. She's the registered owner. Patrol unit investigating the wreck found the body. So far, we have nothing on the other car.</p>
<p>(Grissom turns and notes the deflated air bag.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Where's the nearest traffic camera?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Four blocks north. We've been pulling bodies out of this neighborhood twice a month, it seems like.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I think that's actually an improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah. Well, it's a cold night. I'm going to get you some coffee and donuts.</p>
<p>(Brass leaves. Grissom and Sara both kneel down near the body. They note the open cell phone in her left hand.) </p>
<p>(Grissom picks up the cell phone.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Nine-nine-nine ... five-five-two.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Most people would have called 911.</p>
<p>(David pulls away Ally's collar and notes the bruising underneath.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Well, there's a seat-belt contusion on her shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So ... She survives the crash. She gets out of the car, she dies on the street?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Internal injuries maybe.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How'd the car end up in this position? It looks like she caused the wreck.</p>
<p>[INT. COOPER RESIDENCE - BATHROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Karl Cooper wipes the steam off the bathroom mirror with the palm of his hand and looks at his reflection in the mirror.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (V.O.) Usually, the guy who hits is the guy who runs.</p>
<p>(He leans over the sink and splashes water on his clean-shaven face.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) Well, either way, they left the scene, so it's still a hit-and-run. And this girl's dead. So, we may have a murderer.</p>
<p>(He turns the water off and dabs his face dry with a towel.) </p>
<p>[INT. COOPER RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(He puts the towel on the sink, turns and heads back into the bedroom. His wife, Janice is sleeping.)</p>
<p>(He slips into bed behind her. She sighs.) </p>
<p><strong>Janice Cooper</strong>: It's late. I was worried.</p>
<p><strong>Karl Cooper</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p>(She grabs his hand and pulls his arm around her.) </p>
<p><strong>Janice Cooper</strong>: Love you.</p>
<p>(Camera rises up and we see that Karl Cooper is &quot;Red&quot; without the beard.) </p>
<p><strong>Karl Cooper</strong>: I love you, too.</p>
<p>SMASH CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - BRASS' OFFICE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Brass speaks with Mr. Sullivan, Ally's father.) </p>
<p><strong>Jack Sullivan</strong>: Ally was out late all the time. I never worried about her.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: She liked nightclubs?</p>
<p>(The conversation continues in voice over.) </p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Grissom examines Ally's hands while using an ALS.) </p>
<p><strong>Jack Sullivan</strong>: (V.O.) She liked the club business. She wasn't a party girl. </p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[INT. CSI - GARAGE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Sara pus on a pair of latex gloves and heads over to the car.) </p>
<p><strong>Jack Sullivan</strong>: (V.O.) She wanted to be a VIP hostess.</p>
<p>(We hear a camera shutter snapping.) </p>
<p>(Mr. Sullivan continues.) </p>
<p><strong>Jack Sullivan</strong>: Way you do that in this town is you ... get your face out there, ... </p>
<p>(In Forensic Autopsy, Grissom is using the ALS while examining Ally Sullivan's clothes.) </p>
<p><strong>Jack Sullivan</strong>: (V.O.) ... meet the right people, ... </p>
<p>(Grissom leans in close and examines her magnate necklace.) </p>
<p><strong>Jack Sullivan</strong>: (V.O.) ... be seen. </p>
<p>(He sees some fibers caught on her necklace.) </p>
<p>(In the garage, Sara dusts the windshield. She takes a tape lift of the prints.) </p>
<p><strong>Jack Sullivan</strong>: (V.O.) I taught her to be responsible. If there was an accident, call the police. Help anyone who needed it.</p>
<p>(Sara looks at the print she just lifted.) </p>
<p>(Mr. Sullivan continues.) </p>
<p><strong>Jack Sullivan</strong>: I'd say to her all the time, no matter how pretty you are today, someday, all that will be gone. She knew that. </p>
<p>(In the garage, Sara scrapes samples and puts it in a bindle.) </p>
<p><strong>Jack Sullivan</strong>: (V.O.) She knew she had to treat people with respect. </p>
<p>(Sara takes a photo of the clear plastic cup in the front seat.) </p>
<p><strong>Jack Sullivan</strong>: (V.O.) She always did the right thing; that's why I don't get it.</p>
<p>(Sara puts the camera aside and dusts the side of the plastic cup for prints.) </p>
<p>(Mr. Sullivan finishes.) </p>
<p><strong>Jack Sullivan</strong>: Whoever was in the other car ... I don't care why they left. All they had to do was call an ambulance instead of leaving her there to die.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Robbins goes over the findings with Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: C.O.D. was hyper-extension of the neck with a rotational snap, resulting in a ruptured vertebral artery, mid-cervical.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (surprised) Mid?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Most MVA's break down low or up high, don't they?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: That's why I don't think the accident did it. The injury was more consistent with a stranglehold.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [NIGHT] Karl Cooper has his arm around Ally Sullivan's neck. She struggles against him.) </p>
<p>(Camera zooms in through Ally's mouth for a CGI POV of: Her spinal column is twisted around and snaps.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (V.O.) The head was rapidly twisted relative to the spinal column.</p>
<p>(End of CGI. Ally passes out.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: She would have been dead within a minute. Whoever killed this poor kid knew what they were doing.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. COOPER RESIDENCE - KITCHEN -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Kyle Cooper chops bell peppers on the cutting board. He glances at the article in the paper with the headline, &quot;Local Party Girl Slain&quot;, by Ruben Munoz, Review-Journal. He stops and stares at the photo of the covered body beside the smashed car.) </p>
<p>(A portion of the article reads:<br />
... survived by her father Jack ...<br />
... anyone with information ...<br />
... can call LVPD at 800 ...<br />
... car dealers have ... </p>
<p>(Karl's daughter,Maddy sits on the counter and is stirring the bowl of eggs with a whisk.) </p>
<p><strong>Maddy Cooper</strong>: I don't like gruyere, daddy.</p>
<p><strong>Karl Cooper</strong>: No gruyere in it, sweetie; I promise. All right, egg me.</p>
<p>(Maddy laughs, picks up the egg and cracks it on the side of the bowl. Janice walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Maddy Cooper</strong>: Hello, Mommy. I'm cooking.</p>
<p><strong>Janice Cooper</strong>: I see that. Good morning, honey.</p>
<p>(She kisses Maddy, then walks over to the counter to fill her cup with coffee.) </p>
<p><strong>Karl Cooper</strong>: Morning.</p>
<p><strong>Janice Cooper</strong>: Yeah, well, the jury's still out on that as far you're concerned. You must have had quite a night.</p>
<p><strong>Karl Cooper</strong>: Yeah. I guess I lost track of time.</p>
<p>(Janice yawns.) </p>
<p><strong>Janice Cooper</strong>: That Joey's a dog. If you don't watch out, he's going to get you into trouble.</p>
<p><strong>Karl Cooper</strong>: I kind of doubt that. I wouldn't worry, though. It won't happen again. These days I'm all about you, baby.</p>
<p><strong>Maddy Cooper</strong>: I'm the baby.</p>
<p><strong>Karl Cooper</strong>: I know. I know, but daddies can have more than one baby.</p>
<p><strong>Janice Cooper</strong>: Yeah, pretty talk, talk, talk.</p>
<p>(Janice reaches to sample breakfast from the platter. Karl grabs a different plate and offers her the food on it.) </p>
<p><strong>Karl Cooper</strong>: Here, wait, wait. Try this, try this. Maddy made them.</p>
<p>(Janice samples a piece.) </p>
<p><strong>Janice Cooper</strong>: Mm, it's delicious. Very good.</p>
<p>(Maddy beams at the praise. She reaches over and touches Karl's cleanly shaved cheek.) </p>
<p><strong>Janice Cooper</strong>: I'm glad you shaved. I barely recognized you under all that scruff. (Janice picks up part of the paper.) </p>
<p><strong>Karl Cooper</strong>: Hadn't quite finished that.</p>
<p>(Janice takes the paper and leaves the kitchen.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(Camera pans over a photo of the print on the plastic cup and of the ID from the print for HALL, TRENT.) </p>
<p>(Brass interviews Trent Hall.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hello, rapist.</p>
<p><strong>Trent Hall</strong>: Man, I'm not a rapist. I was a date rapist, which is not even the same thing. And besides, back then, roofies were in.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So you miss the action of the good old days, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Trent Hall</strong>: It's not like that. It's not like that at all.</p>
<p>(In the observation room, Grissom watches the interview.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What's it like?</p>
<p><strong>Trent Hall</strong>: What -- ?</p>
<p>(Brass picks up the soda can and takes a sip from it. Trent Hall watches him, obviously wanting a drink. Brass deliberately puts the soda can down on the table in front of Trent.) </p>
<p><strong>Trent Hall</strong>: Can I get a soda, too? I'm, like, parched.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You want to tell me what your fingerprints are doing on a cup in a dead girl's car?</p>
<p><strong>Trent Hall</strong>: Uh, yeah, yeah. I was out at Jet ... I was kind of faded, I guess. Um, I bumped into Ally, and she offered me a ride home. I needed it.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So that's what you were doing on Harmon Road?</p>
<p><strong>Trent Hall</strong>: Yeah, Ally don't care where I live; she's a cool girl.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You were close?</p>
<p><strong>Trent Hall</strong>: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Were you banging her?</p>
<p><strong>Trent Hall</strong>: Nah.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, what, are you like, pen pals? Girlfriends? What?</p>
<p><strong>Trent Hall</strong>: No, look, we really didn't talk that much. But we would text all the time. That's, like, when you use your cell phone to send, like, you know, words.</p>
<p>(He motions with his hands as if texting on the phone.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah. I know what text messaging is.</p>
<p><strong>Trent Hall</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p>(Brass picks up the can of soda and takes a sip from it. Trent watches him longingly.) </p>
<p><strong>Trent Hall</strong>: Sorry. Look, I'm telling you the truth, you really couldn't get Ally on the phone, it's all texting with her. Well, what do you want my DNA? You want me to pee into a cup? You want my underwear? </p>
<p>(Grissom listens, then flips open the file folder and looks at the notes. It reads:<br />
CELL PHONE, OPEN WITH<br />
NUMBER ENTERED 999552</p>
<p><strong>Trent Hall</strong>: Whatever you want, you got it, cause I didn't kill Ally.</p>
<p>(The voices fade into the background.) </p>
<p>(Grissom takes out his cell phone.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (over speaker) I'll tell you what I want. I want you to write down exactly where you were last night and when. Think you can handle that?</p>
<p><strong>Trent Hall</strong>: Can I get a soda?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Shut up and write.</p>
<p>(Grissom flips open the cell phone, selects TEXT MESSAGING. He types in<br />
&quot;999552&quot; and comes out with: yka.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - DNA LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Hodges goes over his findings with Sara.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Paint scrapings from your vic's bumper are consistent with a '91 to '96 blue Ford.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So that narrows it down to a few thousand cars in the greater Las Vegas area.</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Yeah, but the car you're looking for is also a piece of crap.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Make and model I get, but unless you have a new test that quantifies<br />
&quot;crappiness&quot; ...</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Actually, take a look.</p>
<p>(Sara looks through the microscope.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Firebird's on the left, blue Ford on the right. What's the gray-blue in the middle?</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: A mixture of rustoleum and house paint. The killer's car had exposed primer. Swanky.</p>
<p>(Grissom walks in and holds up his phone.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Might have found a few letters from the license plate. &quot;Y-K-A.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You found a witness?</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: There was no reason to connect the two murders until ballistics matched the silencer we found in the desert with the gun you found at the Riviera Suites.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Two murders, same killer.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Here's how we think things went down. The killer drove his ATV into the desert, concealed it in the brush, takes a bus to a used car lot and buys a blue Taurus.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Then he drives to the apartment, puts a cap in Clayton Nash, gets into his car and drives away, free and clear.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It's a good plan, well executed.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, right up until the point that Ally Sullivan smashed into his car.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Collateral damage -- he killed her so she couldn't identify him.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Okay, that all sounds great. How do we find the guy?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We know his original target, Clayton Nash. Small-time hood who gave up a lot of his big-time cronies. He's got a list of enemies.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How many guys got convicted off Nash's testimony?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Seven. Three of them are still in prison. One is dead, one is out on parole, and two served their time and are now out.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So we have three potential killers and nothing to tie them to either crime scene.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Not quite. I ruled out most of the prints from Ally Sullivan's car -- the vic, the father, her boyfriend -- but there were a few unidentified partials.</p>
<p>(Sara hands the print cards to Grissom, who looks through it.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It's not enough detail to run through AFIS?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, if this guy is a major case felon, then his prints are definitely in the system.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I dusted every inch of that apartment window. He never took off his gloves.</p>
<p>(Grissom again looks at the print cards.)</p>

<p>(Quick flash of: The killer and Ally Sullivan struggle. The killer puts his hand on the car window to brace himself. The part of the base of his palm not covered by the glove hits the window. End of flash.) </p>
<p>(Grissom looks through the print cards of the suspects:<br />
LYLE, PETER<br />
#6587-7438-73698F</p>
<p>(He visually compares the prints.) </p>

<p>[INT. COOPER RESIDENCE - GARAGE]</p>
<p>(Janice and Karl talk.) </p>
<p><strong>Janice Cooper</strong>: (upset) The fake ID cards?! The staying out all night, and then this mysterious ATV ride in the desert.</p>
<p><strong>Karl Cooper</strong>: You gave me the ATV for my birthday. I ride it because I love you.</p>
<p><strong>Janice Cooper</strong>: Yeah, at three o'clock in the morning?</p>
<p><strong>Karl Cooper</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Janice Cooper</strong>: Uh-uh. You're planning a job.</p>
<p><strong>Karl Cooper</strong>: I'm not planning a job! You know I don't do that anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Janice Cooper</strong>: You're a liar, Karl. You're lying!</p>
<p><strong>Karl Cooper</strong>: Honey, listen -- honey! Janice, look ... I had to take care of something.</p>
<p><strong>Janice Cooper</strong>: And what's that supposed to mean?</p>
<p><strong>Karl Cooper</strong>: I killed Clayton Nash.</p>
<p><strong>Janice Cooper</strong>: You even think about Maddy? Your daughter? You promised ... on her life, you promised! (She hits him.) No more robberies!</p>
<p><strong>Karl Cooper</strong>: I don't do robberies anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Janice Cooper</strong>: Now you just kill people.</p>
<p><strong>Karl Cooper</strong>: He was a rat.</p>
<p><strong>Janice Cooper</strong>: Oh, Karl. All the waiting. All the maneuvering, the lying. I did it. And I did it for us, for this family. I kept money in our wallets. I invested it, so all you had to do was watch football on TV.</p>
<p><strong>Karl Cooper</strong>: And Nash was the reason. The reason that you had to hide the money and live on the run. I never got caught! And I never would've got caught, except for that ... that lousy junkie who gave me up. I only had one rule: You never talk! And he talked.</p>
<p><strong>Janice Cooper</strong>: And you jeopardized everything we have for some scumbag that nobody gives a damn about.</p>
<p><strong>Karl Cooper</strong>: Janice, he called me four weeks ago. He said, &quot;I'm in town for a while. Maybe we could we get together.&quot; He had something to tell me. Tell me what? &quot;I'm sorry? I'm sorry I stole seven years of your life.&quot; I-I couldn't let it go.</p>
<p><strong>Janice Cooper</strong>: Oh, God, he had it coming. And you were careful, right? So what's with the fake IDs? Karl? You don't make mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>Karl Cooper</strong>: I didn't. Somebody else did. A girl named Ally Sullivan.</p>
<p><strong>Janice Cooper</strong>: The ... the girl on the tv? Oh, Karl! Oh, God, she was just a kid!</p>
<p><strong>Karl Cooper</strong>: She crashed into my car right after I did Nash. She was gonna call the cops. I had to do it. I had to.</p>
<p><strong>Janice Cooper</strong>: I want you to go up the stairs. I want you to kiss Maddy. I want you to tell her that you love her ... and I want you to get out of this house.</p>
<p>(Janice turns and leaves.) </p>

[INT. CSI - GRISSOM'S OFFICE] </p>
<p>(Catherine is talking with Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Karl Cooper. At age 19, he was an Army Ranger. By 42, he was one of the most successful bank robbers in U.S. History. He pulled off dozens of heists, going back two decades, all without killing a single person, and he was known to his bank-robbing buddies as &quot;Red.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He doesn't have red hair.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, he got the nickname because he was always in debt ... &quot;in the red.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Do we have 'In The Red's address?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Last known was the U.S. Federal Penitentiary in Marion, Illinois. When Nash gave him up, Cooper plead guilty. He served the full seven years' term. He got out, dropped off the face of the earth.</p>

<p>(Nick reports his findings to Catherine and Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: The tire model is a Dunlop KT-345. I checked with the local dealers. The only ATV that uses that particular type of tire has only been on the market for about a year. It's called the Yamaha Raptor. So I got the list of the names of everybody in Las Vegas who's recently bought one. The only Cooper on the list is female -- Janice.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, Karl Cooper had a girlfriend back in Ohio, a Janice Hanford. I mean, she could be Cooper now.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Do we have her address?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah. It's, uh, second page.</p>

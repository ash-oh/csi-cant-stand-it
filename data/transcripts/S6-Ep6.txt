<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH:</p>
<p>[EXTREME CLOSE UP: SPERM (STOCK)]</p>
<p>(Sperm zooms past the camera and toward the egg.)</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[CU: EGG (STOCK)]</p>
<p>(The sperm swarm around the egg. Camera zooms past the sperm toward one that enters the egg.)</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[CU: EGG (STOCK)]</p>
<p>(The fertilized egg starts to divide.)</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[CU: The fetus (STOCK)]</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAWN]</p>
<p>[CU: The fetus (STOCK)</p>
<p>(Close-up of the feet and toes. We hear the fetus' heart beating.)</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - MORNING]</p>
<p>[CU: The fetus (STOCK)]</p>
<p>[CU: The baby]</p>
<p>(A baby is awake in his crib. The doorbell rings.)</p>
<p>(The camera sweeps around the room to show there's no one there. There's no answer.)</p>
<p>(The doorbell rings again.)</p>
<p>(On the floor, a woman is dead in front of the baby's crib.)</p>
<p>[EXT. ADALIAN FRONT PORCH - MORNING]</p>
<p>(Lana Adalian knocks on the front door to her sister's house. A dog barks in the background. After a moment, she peers into the house through the side window.)</p>
<p>(Inside the house, the baby cries.)</p>
<p>(Lana Adalian peers into the window and sees the baby in the crib and the body on the floor.)</p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
[EXT. ADALIAN RESIDENCE - DAY]</p>
<p>(A police car is parked in the driveway as officers question people outside. The front of the house is taped off.)</p>
<p>(The CSI SUV drives up and parks on the road. Brass turns from talking with an officer and sees the car.)</p>
<p>(Catherine and Sara carry their kits as they make their way toward the house. Brass meets them.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The decedent's name is Christina Adalian, 28. Gunshot to the temple. Her sister is over there, (He nods toward the dark-haired woman standing near the officer car and carrying the baby.) ... just came in from L.A. When no one answered the door, she looked inside. Saw her sister on the floor. The playpen with the baby was next to the body. Police officers kicked in the door.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Where's the father?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, according to her sister, she's a single mom. They lived alone. </p>
<p>[INT. ADALIAN RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - DAY -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Brass, Catherine and Sara enter the house. David Phillips is there with the body.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Lividity suggests she hasn't been moved. Liver temp is 92 degrees, which means she's been dead four to five hours. </p>
<p>(Catherine notes the wound and the gun in the woman's hand.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Wound pattern and GSR suggest a tight contact shot.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Consistent with suicide. Oh, there's a note on the white table.</p>
<p>(On the table, Catherine finds the hand-written note signed by Christina Adalian.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: &quot;Joey is better off without me. Christina Adalian.&quot; Postpartum depression so bad, it leads to suicide?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Sister was feeding the baby. Where'd she get the bottle?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The fridge is full of bottles of breast milk.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Mom stocks the fridge and kills herself, knowing her sister was going to show up.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: She wanted to make sure that her baby was quickly found and fed.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: David, do you mind if I render the gun safe?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Better you than me.</p>
<p>(Sara removes the gun from the body's grip and checks it. Catherine looks at the victim's hand. Sara checks the cylinder.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: One shot fired.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Sara, check out the blood on her hand.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: There isn't any.</p>
<p>(Sara checks the gun.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The gun is spattered in dried blood. She wasn't holding this gun when she was shot.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And what appears to be -- is not. </p>
<p>SMASH CUT TO: END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. ADALIAN RESIDENCE - DAY]</p>
<p>(David pushes the gurney with the body down the front drive toward the coroner's van. He rolls the gurney past the victim's sister, Lana Adalian, who is standing next to Brass on the front road. The baby is in her arms.) </p>
<p><strong>Lana Adalian</strong>: Honest. I am good with kids. I'll get a hotel. I'll stay in town.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I know we've been over this before. Like I said, he'll be placed in Child Services until appropriate custody can be determined. That's just the way it is. I'm sorry.</p>
<p>(An officer joins them.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Metro just arrived with a baby seat. We're ready.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>Lana Adalian</strong>: I'd really like to go with him.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Okay, after we're finished, an officer will take you to the facility.</p>
<p><strong>Lana Adalian</strong>: Finished with what?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, we have a few more questions. And, uh, CSI has to take your fingerprints. We won't take long, believe me.</p>
<p><strong>Lana Adalian</strong>: Well, what about his bottles?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: They're in a cooler in the officer's car.</p>
<p>(The officer holds his hands out for the baby. The baby starts to cry.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Ma'am.</p>
<p>(Lana hesitates.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: It's okay.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (softly) It's okay. It's gonna be all right.</p>
<p>(The officer takes the baby from her. The baby screams louder.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: (to the baby) Hey, buddy. It's okay. It's okay.</p>
<p>(The officer leaves with the baby.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. ADALIAN RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM -- DAY]</p>
<p>(Grissom snaps photos of the note. He pauses and looks at the note.) </p>
<p>(Catherine walks into the room.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Can't find a red pen anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, maybe the killer brought his own pen. Or took it with him as a souvenir.</p>
<p>(Grissom's phone rings. He checks the caller ID and sees: ECKLIE.)</p>
<p>(He tucks the phone back into his pocket. Warrick enters the room.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Okay, guys. I swept the perimeter. I think someone jimmied the back kitchen door.</p>
<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO: </p>
<p>[EXT. ADALIAN RESIDENCE - BACK KITCHEN -- DAY]</p>
<p>(Warrick leads Grissom and Catherine outside to show them the back kitchen door.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Now, I printed the doorknob. Nothing but smudges. Check out the fresh scrapings there on the doorjamb and the striker plate.</p>
<p>(Grissom leans forward for a closer look.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Looks like forced entry with a metal object.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: Someone jams a long, thin metal object to jimmie the door open. End of flash.)</p>
<p>(Catherine leans forward and notices the dust on the floor.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Some black and white particles. Want to hand me a hinge lift?</p>
<p>(Warrick hands Catherine the hinge lift from his kit.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Good eyes.</p>
<p>(Grissom snaps a photo.) </p>
<p>(His cell phone rings again. Grissom notes the caller ID and shuts the phone off.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (without looking up) Who do you keep avoiding?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Ecklie.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Ah, that means you should answer it.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No, he just wants to yell at me because I'm late with the personnel evaluations. It can wait.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No, it can't. </p>
<p>(Catherine gets a tape lift of the black and white particles.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No one on your team receives cost-of-living adjustments until those evaluations are turned in.</p>
<p>(Catherine stands up and looks at Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, she kind of has a point. I do like to take the wife out to dinner every now and then.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mm-hmm. I'll do them as soon as I get back to the lab.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. ADALIAN RESIDENCE - DAY]</p>
<p>(Lana Adalian talks with Sara and Brass.) </p>
<p><strong>Lana Adalian</strong>: Last time I saw my sister was over a year ago. She was just beginning to show. She'd gone through a really bad breakup and couldn't stop crying.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Is the ex the baby's father?</p>
<p><strong>Lana Adalian</strong>: I'm not sure.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, we need to contact him regarding Joey. It would be helpful to know his whereabouts.</p>
<p><strong>Lana Adalian</strong>: I only know his first name. Evan. But Christina referred to him as &quot;the jerk.&quot; They met at a church social a few years back. Christina complained he wasn't very Christian-like. But that was part of the attraction, if you ask me. He was older. Didn't want to get married. You know, Christina never said he was the father.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So there were other guys?</p>
<p><strong>Lana Adalian</strong>: No. As far as I knew, Christina was a prude. She'd turn red if somebody told a dirty joke. I always thought she was a virgin until ...</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Until she got pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>Lana Adalian</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(Sofia walks up to them.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Excuse me, have either of you two seen Grissom?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: He's in the house.</p>
<p>(Sara watches as Sofia heads for the house.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. ADALIAN RESIDENCE - DAY]</p>
<p>(Sofia removes her sunglasses as she steps inside the house. Catherine turns around and notices her.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Sofia.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Hey, Catherine. Grissom, Ecklie's been looking for you. Is your cell not working?</p>
<p>(Grissom is kneeling in front of his open kit, his back to her. He doesn't turn around.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (over his shoulder) What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Well, apparently, I was a CSI, then a detective, but now I'm a messenger. You're needed at the lab ASAP.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: I have no idea. But the undersheriff's camped out in the break room.</p>
<p>(Sofia turns and leaves. Grissom doesn't move.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'll have Greg run down the gun's serial number. Nick is covering the autopsy. (Grissom slowly shuts the lid to his kit.) Warrick and I will finish the processing here and I'll keep you posted.</p>
<p>(Grissom slowly snaps the kit shut, locking it.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (sighs) Thanks.</p>
<p>(Grissom grabs his kit and stands up. He walks past Catherine as he heads out.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (quietly) What would you do without me?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY / BREAKROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Grissom walks through the hallway and heads toward the break room. Inside the break room, Ecklie and Undersheriff McKeen sit side-by-side at the table. They both stand when Grissom walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Ecklie</strong>: Grissom.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Conrad. Sheriff. It's always lovely to see you fellas, but I'm right in the middle of a crime scene.</p>
<p><strong>Ecklie</strong>: We have a situation, Gil. Preston Breckman who's on trial for the murder of Joanna Whitson.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, I know. (to the sheriff) She was a friend of yours. I'm sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Undersheriff McKeen</strong>: I was her godfather. Grew up with her dad. Two weeks before she was murdered I gave a toast at her sweet sixteen.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, they say it's a slam dunk case.</p>
<p><strong>Ecklie</strong>: You would think. (He looks down at the file folder in front of him.)<br />
We've got an eyewitness who saw him stab her. Hair, fiber, even DNA from the killer's tobacco indict, Breckman. </p>
<p>(He hands the folder to Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Ecklie</strong>: We got the right guy.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Then what am I doing here?</p>
<p><strong>Ecklie</strong>: Defense has called entomologist Mark Thayer as an expert witness.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He's a gun for hire.</p>
<p><strong>Ecklie</strong>: He's gonna say that the insect activity on the body proves defendant was out of town at the time of the murder.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And you want me to refute his testimony?</p>
<p>(Ecklie nods. Grissom looks at the folder.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: When does he take the stand?</p>
<p><strong>Undersheriff McKeen</strong>: Half an hour. Look, he's been on the list, but the DA assured me he was unavailable.</p>
<p><strong>Ecklie</strong>: Gil, we need you to listen to his testimony. Prosecution may need your assistance on cross.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'll do my best.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - MORGUE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Robbins goes over the preliminary findings with Nick.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: No mystery here. Penetrating gunshot wound to the right temple killed our virgin Mary. I sent the bullet to ballistics.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Virgin Mary?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Hymen's intact, which means she's never had intercourse. But she gave birth ... caesarean scar. </p>
<p>NICK; So other than divine intervention, how do you explain this miraculous conception?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Well, the most obvious explanation would be frottage.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You mean dry humping?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: In s*x ed, Nick, they teach that rubbing body parts is safe. But since the hymen's not a barrier to semen, there's still a risk of pregnancy, not to mention STDs.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Right. Sperm meets labia, all bets are off.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: It's all about gravity.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Thanks, Dr. Ruth.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - BALLISTICS LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Bobby Dawson goes over the bullet findings with Greg.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: The test fire bullet matches the evidence bullet.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: That confirms the gun found at the scene was used to kill this, uh ... (He opens the file folder and looks at the victim's name.) Christina Adalian.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: You run the serial number?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: Yeah, of course. Anyway, Greg, your two-inch Colt was originally purchased in 1986 by a Mr. Duane McWane from Henderson. Good luck.</p>
<p>(He hands the file folder to Greg.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>(Greg turns and leaves the lab.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. WITHERSPOON'S COURTROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Open on a courtroom chart titled: LIFE CYCLE OF THE BLACK BLOWFLY (P. Regina). The cycle shows from egg to pupa to adult.) </p>
<p>(Mark Thayer is on the stand.) </p>
<p><strong>Mark Thayer</strong>: Well, as you can see, the life cycle of the black blowfly, from egg to larva to puparium to adult, is like clockwork.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Matthews (defense)</strong>: So, to be clear, we can use the fly's lifecycle to accurately determine the precise day the victim was killed.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Thayer</strong>: That's correct. </p>
<p><strong>Adam Matthews (defense)</strong>: The victim was murdered in a woodsy area near Lake Mead. In that vicinity, how long would it take for the blowfly to lay eggs in Joanna Whitson's body?</p>
<p><strong>Mark Thayer</strong>: Within minutes of her death.</p>
<p>(In the audience, Ecklie turns to Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Ecklie</strong>: (quietly) Is that true?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (nods) Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Matthews (defense)</strong>: Doctor, based on your review of the blowfly activity as documented by CSI, can you tell this jury the exact date Joanna was murdered?</p>
<p>(In the back of the audience, Undersheriff McKeen sits watching the proceedings.) </p>
<p><strong>Mark Thayer</strong>: CSI found puparia on the body, but no adults. So that means that the victim had been dead for fifteen days.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Matthews (defense)</strong>: The body was discovered November 15. So based on your analysis, the victim was killed November 1?</p>
<p><strong>Mark Thayer</strong>: That's correct.</p>
<p><strong>Ecklie</strong>: (to Grissom) Defendant was in Mexico 'til November 3. We think he killed her on the fourth.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (quietly) Well, he's still got to prove his timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Matthews (defense)</strong>: Dr. Thayer, this timeline you suggest-- from egg to puparia, has this been documented?</p>
<p><strong>Mark Thayer</strong>: I documented it myself. In fact, in preparation for this trial, I videotaped a black blowfly breeding on a pig carcass. Now, this videotape will illustrate that the timeline from egg to puparium is, in fact, precisely fifteen days.</p>
<p>(Adam Matthews turns back to his table and picks up a video tape. He holds it out for the court.) </p>
<p><strong>Adam Matthews (defense)</strong>: Your honor, on this video tape, I have relevant footage of Dr. Thayer's experiment. With your permission, I'd like to play it for the jury.</p>
<p>(Grissom leans forward toward the prosecutor.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Have you seen this tape?</p>
<p><strong>ADA Jeffrey Sinclair (prosecutor)</strong>: (to Grissom) No. (louder, to the court)<br />
Objection. Your honor, the defense never produced that tape for our review. We haven't had the opportunity to examine its authenticity.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Matthews (defense)</strong>: It's not our fault. It was never requested.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Witherspoon</strong>: Is that true, counselor?</p>
<p><strong>ADA Jeffrey Sinclair (prosecutor)</strong>: The defense is playing games, your honor. We subpoenaed the expert's files, reports and opinions. But, apparently, they've conveniently construed the subpoena too narrowly. They're acting in bad faith, your honor, and cannot expect this court to usurp ...</p>
<p><strong>Adam Matthews (defense)</strong>: Your honor, your honor. If I may ...</p>
<p><strong>Judge Witherspoon</strong>: (interrupts) You may not. You blindsided the court. You knew that the ADA would want to see that tape and you deliberately withheld it.<br />

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Really? Was she dating one of your co-workers?</p>
<p><strong>Evan Peters</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, we found marble particles in her house and we identified the stone. It came from this facility.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: See, Mr. Peters, we know that you and Christina technically never had s*x, so when you found out that she was pregnant, I'm guessing that you felt that she cheated on you.</p>
<p><strong>Evan Peters</strong>: How in the hell do you know about my s*x life?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I mean, that had to have made you really angry, right?</p>
<p><strong>Evan Peters</strong>: Well, that's why I dumped her.</p>
<p>(Catherine nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Evan Peters</strong>: And fine, I saw her a couple of days ago. She called me in a panic. Dingbat had locked herself out with her damn baby still inside the house. Thought I had her spare key. I didn't. She sounded hysterical, so I went over to help.</p>

<p><strong>Greg</strong>: You sell it?</p>
<p><strong>Duane McWane</strong>: No, I gave it to my paralegal. I'm an attorney. Look, it's just a handgun, so I wasn't required to register the transfer.</p>

<p>(Grissom reviews the file when Ecklie walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Ecklie</strong>: How is it going?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, according to my experience and all three of these textbooks, the P. Regina would develop from egg to puparium in eleven days.</p>
<p><strong>Ecklie</strong>: Great. That discounts Thayer's testimony and puts Breckman in Vegas at the time of the homicide.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, but his demonstration speaks for itself. There's no visible puparia for fifteen days, just as Thayer asserts.</p>
<p><strong>Ecklie</strong>: And jurors might be more receptive to video documentation than books.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The science in these textbooks is sound, but the tape is more than enough to get reasonable doubt.</p>
<p><strong>Ecklie</strong>: Well, there's no doubt in my mind that Thayer worked his science to get the answers the defense needed. We just need to know how he did it. Could he have altered one of the variables?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I've reviewed his documentation. He purchased the pig from a reputable dealer. He conducted the experiment at a private lab with eyewitnesses, controlled all variables to replicate the conditions at Lake Mead during the time in question--65 to 73 degrees, no precipitation, on and on.</p>
<p><strong>Ecklie</strong>: Can you conduct your own experiment?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sure, if the judge will give me eleven days.</p>
<p><strong>Ecklie</strong>: Well, we know that's not gonna happen.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Uh-huh. Yeah. That must've been nice for you. So ...</p>
<p><strong>Wendy Simms</strong>: (interrupts) Hey, how about lunch tomorrow? Just you and me. Cause, see, I-I figure that you gotta know where the bodies are buried around here. So to speak.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Is that why you paged me?</p>
<p><strong>Wendy Simms</strong>: No. No, um ... I compared Christina Adalian's DNA to baby Joey's, and guess what? Mother and son -- they're not mother and son. At least not genetically speaking. There's no relation.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And Evan Peters isn't the father?</p>
<p><strong>Wendy Simms</strong>: Nope. So assuming that there was no big baby mix-up at the hospital, I'm thinking that Christina Adalian had to be a surrogate.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Surrogacy ... that would explain her hymen.</p>
<p><strong>Wendy Simms</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Her hymen was intact, which is consistent with in-vitro fertilization.</p>
<p><strong>Wendy Simms</strong>: Yeah, but there's one problem. A surrogate's not supposed to keep the baby. The surrogate is supposed to be a gestational carrier who returns the child to the biological parents after it's been born.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He manipulates people. The public assumes that scientists are ethical, but many of us are no better than politicians, evidently.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So do you think that Thayer is presenting the jury with faulty forensics?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I know he is. I just don't know how. Videotapes are clean. The science appears sound. How's your case going?</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: According to literature, Project Sunflower believes that every fertilized egg or embryo is a baby from the moment it's created in a laboratory dish. Fertility clinics freeze fertilized eggs for their clients undergoing in-vitro fertilization. Often, the clinics freeze more eggs than they ultimately need.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: If I understand your program correctly, you take these embryos and you place them in available wombs.</p>
<p><strong>Emily Ryan</strong>: We seek out special unselfish women who are prepared to adopt at the embryonic stage of development. We believe that the soul is infused when sperm meets egg. That's when life begins.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Are you aware that throughout much of history, the official church position held that a child's life begins when the mother first becomes aware of movement?</p>
<p><strong>Emily Ryan</strong>: Oh, that's your opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: In the 16th century, the pope proclaimed that embryos less than forty days old are not human. That is not my opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Emily Ryan</strong>: You've had an abortion, Miss Willows?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Huh. No. Thank God I decided not to have one. But we are not talking about me, Dr. Ryan. Are you a medical doctor?</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I have a question. Do the biological parents get to meet the embryo adopters?</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You should have cited Leviticus 17:11. &quot;The life of the flesh is in the blood.&quot; Taken literally, life doesn't begin when the sperm meets the egg, but 18 days later. When the embryo is infused with blood.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Is that your position?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, if I were speaking with a woman who prefers theology to science, it's a position she'd find tough to refute.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So are we having a philosophical discussion here, or am I being reprimanded?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (shakes his head) I don't know. I got to go to court.</p>
<p>(Grissom leaves. Catherine turns and sees Hodges leaning up against the door frame to his lab as he watches her.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Your white blouse. The results are printing.</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - DNA LAB - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(The results print out.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: It seems like you and Grissom were having a fairly intense conversation. Can I ask ... ?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (interrupts) Tell me about the blouse, please.</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: I ran the S.E.M. over the adhesive disks and confirmed gunshot residue.</p>
<p>(Catherine looks at the results.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(Catherine interviews Kenli Johnson as her attorney, Carol Allred, sits next to her.) </p>
<p><strong>Carol Allred (attorney)</strong>: You found clothing in a laundry basket that tested positive for gunshot residue. So what? That doesn't mean my client killed anyone.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It proves that she fired a gun, Carol.</p>
<p><strong>Kenli Johnson</strong>: I've never fired a gun. I've never even touched a gun.</p>
<p><strong>Carol Allred (attorney)</strong>: Catherine, I'm sorry, but if I understand your forensics, the GSR test does not, in fact, confirm that she fired a gun. I mean, it's possible she rubbed up against someone who did.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Theoretically.</p>
<p><strong>Kenli Johnson</strong>: I cared about Christina.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm sure that you did. But looking into Joey's eyes and seeing your husband must've torn you up inside. And the only person standing between you and your baby was the victim.</p>
<p><strong>Carol Allred (attorney)</strong>: Okay, don't respond to that.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: When was the last time you actually saw Christina?</p>
<p>(Kenli looks at Carol. Carol nods for her to answer the question.) </p>
<p><strong>Kenli Johnson</strong>: Two days ago. I took them to lunch.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What were you doing two nights ago, around 11:00 P.M.?</p>
<p><strong>Kenli Johnson</strong>: I was home all night.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Can anyone verify that?</p>
<p><strong>Kenli Johnson</strong>: My mom lives with me, but she wasn't home. That's gin rummy night.</p>
<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO: </p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY - DAY]</p>
<p>(Catherine walks out of the interview room and heads over to the waiting room where Sandra Walkey is waiting.) </p>
<p><strong>Sandra Walkey</strong>: What's going on in there? Kenli had nothing to do with this.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mrs. Walkey, I need your help. Your daughter claims that two nights ago she was home watching television. Can you confirm that?</p>
<p><strong>Sandra Walkey</strong>: Well, of course. I was with her.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - LAB - DAY]</p>
<p>(Sara is examining the laundry basket clothes under the ALS. She stops and turns the lights back on when Catherine walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: If you had to guess, what's Kenli's dress size?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Four, maybe six.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I found blood spatter on this blouse. Size 12.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: There're two women that live at that house. Only one is a size<br />
12.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(Catherine interviews Sandra Walkey.) </p>
<p><strong>Sandra Walkey</strong>: I don't need an attorney. I've done nothing wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Would you mind emptying the contents of your purse?</p>
<p><strong>Sandra Walkey</strong>: First you go after Kenli, now me. A few hours ago, you guys were saying there was gunshot powder on Kenli's blouse. You make a mistake?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No, it was probably transferred from your blouse, the one that you wore that night. I have a warrant to search your person and your home. Please empty the contents of your purse onto the table.</p>
<p>(Mrs. Walkey dumps the contents of her bag onto the table. Catherine finds a red pen.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: A red coda pen.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback of: Mrs. Walkey holds the gun on Christina Adalian as she writes out her suicide note.) </p>
<p><strong>Sandra Walkey</strong>: Joey ... is ... better off ... without me.</p>
<p>(Christina finishes the note and looks at the baby.) </p>
<p><strong>Christina Adalian</strong>: Please don't do this. Oh, God, please.</p>
<p><strong>Sandra Walkey</strong>: Sign it. Sign it!</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You knew that her sister was coming for a visit, so the baby would be okay. You killed her and then staged the scene.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The baby is in the crib. Mrs. Walkey fires. Christina falls to the floor. Joey screams.) </p>
<p>(Mrs. Walkey quickly grabs the red pen. She kisses Joey on his head, then leaves.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Sandra Walkey</strong>: You have a wild imagination, Ms. Willows.</p>
<p>(Catherine looks down and sees a photo on Mrs. Walkey's keychain.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Is this your husband?</p>
<p><strong>Sandra Walkey</strong>: Arnold. He passed away. Two years ago, May.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: He looks like a poker player.</p>
<p><strong>Sandra Walkey</strong>: You can tell that from his photo?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Actually, it's ... the mole between his eyes that's his tell.</p>
<p><strong>Sandra Walkey</strong>: Why are we talking about Arnie?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Because you used his gun. The gun he won in a poker game.</p>
<p><strong>Sandra Walkey</strong>: Are you going to put me in jail?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: That's how it works.</p>
<p><strong>Sandra Walkey</strong>: And the baby -- he goes with Kenli, right?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm sure that Child Services will follow the dictates of Christina's will.</p>
<p><strong>Sandra Walkey</strong>: Then it was all worth it. My baby has her baby. That's all that really matters.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Did you ever consider that Christina Adalian is somebody's baby?</p>
<p><strong>Sandra Walkey</strong>: We each protect our own. That's how it's done.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Officer, would you please escort Mrs. Walkey to lockup?</p>
<p>(The officer steps forward and escorts Mrs. Walkey out of the room.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. JUDGE WITHERSPOON'S COURTROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(The court watches the video of the dead pig on day 14.) </p>
<p><strong>Mark Thayer</strong>: As you can see, on day 14 -- plenty of larvae, commonly known as maggots, but no puparia.</p>
<p>(Video cuts to the dead pig on day 15.) </p>
<p><strong>Mark Thayer</strong>: Finally on day 15, you'll notice the puparia swimming in the brown liquid.</p>
<p>(Mark Thayer is on the stand.) </p>
<p><strong>Mark Thayer</strong>: Based on that evidence, I can reliably conclude that Joanna Whitson was killed on November 1.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Matthews (defense)</strong>: You're absolutely certain of that timeline?</p>
<p><strong>Mark Thayer</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Matthews (defense)</strong>: Thank you. No further questions.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Witherspoon</strong>: Your witness.</p>
<p><strong>ADA Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: We have no questions for Dr. Thayer. But I now call to the stand Dr. Gil Grissom as a rebuttal expert witness.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Witherspoon</strong>: Dr. Thayer, you're dismissed. Dr. Grissom, please approach the stand to be sworn in.</p>
<p>(Mark Thayer leaves the stand. Grissom stands up and walks over to the stand.) </p>
<p><strong>Bailiff</strong>: Raise your right hand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, so help you God?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I certainly do.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Witherspoon</strong>: You may be seated.</p>
<p><strong>ADA Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: Dr. Grissom, you've had a chance to review Dr. Thayer's tape and associated evidence, is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ADA Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: Do you agree with his finding that Joanna Whitson was murdered fifteen days before her body was discovered?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>ADA Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: Can you please elaborate?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Our crime lab analyzed fly larvae that was taken from the pig used by Dr. Thayer in his demonstration. Apparently, they digested dimethyldithiophosphate and t-mulz light aromatic. </p>
<p><strong>ADA Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: A toxin commonly known as malathion?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yes. I believe the malathion was sprayed onto the pig's skin.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Malathion is sprayed on the dead pig. End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>ADA Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: How would malathion affect a fly's life cycle?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It would delay the time it takes for puparia to appear. Specifically, the malathion would delay oviposition.</p>
<p><strong>ADA Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: Oviposition?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Laying eggs. Without malathion, adult flies would immediately lay new eggs on the pig's flesh. But with malathion, oviposition would be delayed up to four days. </p>
<p><strong>ADA Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: A four-day delay would mean that Joanna Whitson died on November 4, not November 1, is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>ADA Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: Is there any scientific rationale for spraying a pig with malathion before documenting a fly's life cycle?</p>
<p><strong>Adam Matthews (defense)</strong>: Objection.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Witherspoon</strong>: Overruled.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The only rationale I can think of would be jury manipulation. Every entomologist knows that early oviposition is undetectable because flies lay their first round of eggs inside body openings. Anyone reviewing the tape would assume that the eggs were being laid, when in fact they were not. If our lab had not tested the larvae for toxins, we would never have known that. Nor would the jury.</p>
<p><strong>ADA Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: Thank you. No further questions. </p>
<p><strong>Judge Witherspoon</strong>: Counselor, your witness.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Matthews (defense)</strong>: Uh, we have no questions at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Witherspoon</strong>: Oh, in that case, we are adjourned until 9:00 A.M. tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>(The judge bangs her gavel. Court is dismissed.)</p>
<p>(Grissom steps down from the stand. Mark Thayer stands up to meet with him.) </p>
<p><strong>Mark Thayer</strong>: I want to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I have nothing to say to you.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Thayer</strong>: You impugned my character.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What character?</p>
<p><strong>ADA Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: Uh, excuse me, Dr Thayer. </p>
<p><strong>Mark Thayer</strong>: (annoyed) What the hell do you want?</p>
<p><strong>ADA Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: Well, to inform you that you have the right to remain silent. The DA'S filing charges for perjury ... </p>
<p>(Jeffrey Sinclair motions for the officers to step forward.) </p>
<p><strong>Mark Thayer</strong>: (groans) Oh, my God ...</p>
<p><strong>ADA Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: ... and obstruction of justice. We won't be accepting a plea.</p>
<p>(Mark Thayer turns and glares at Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Mark Thayer</strong>: This is all your fault.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I hope so.</p>
<p>(The officers escort Mark Thayer out of the courtroom.) </p>
<p>(Grissom heads for the door. Undersheriff McKeen meets with him.) </p>
<p><strong>Undersheriff McKeen</strong>: Grissom. Great work up there.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Actually, the work was done in the lab.</p>
<p><strong>Undersheriff McKeen</strong>: When I took this job, I heard a lot of things about you. If you ever need a favor, if I can help you in any way ... </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You know Sheriff, you could help me. I'm late delivering my team's personnel evaluations.</p>
<p><strong>Undersheriff McKeen</strong>: I'll tell Ecklie. He'll backdate your cost-of-living adjustments.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Undersheriff McKeen</strong>: So, Grissom, I'm not sure of your ambitions, but if you're interested in taking on more responsibility, maybe a promotion, I'd be glad to pass ...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (interrupts) You know, Oscar Wilde once said, &quot;Ambition is the last refuge of failure.&quot; I'm fine. Thanks.</p>
<p>(Smiling, Grissom heads out of the courtroom.)</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>

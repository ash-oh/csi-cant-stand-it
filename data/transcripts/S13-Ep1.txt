Is that a girlfriend?
Not right now.
Can I see?
Ah! Whoa!
She wouldn't like that.
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.
Gonna be here when I get back?
If you're lucky.

RUSSELL: Yeah.
Yeah, it's me.
I just heard about Ecklie.
I'm at, uh...
Where am I? I'm at, uh...
Bar 483.
I'm with Moreno's partner Crenshaw.
Something's definitely not right.
Jules... they got Katie.
FINLAY: What?!
McKeen. His-his people, they took Katie for payback for his son or something.
Crenshaw's one of 'em.
How do you know that?
FINLAY: I just know.
I'm gonna stick with him and see where he takes me.
You get your ass out of there and come back right now--
I've lost enough tonight.
I'll be in touch.
BARBARA: Your father will not let anything happen to Kaitlyn.
MAYA : No, no, no, no...
I want to see her room!
You can't come in here.
Listen, we have to process the scene.
The scene?!
What are you talk...
Listen to me, will you, please?
Listen to me.
I promise you I will bring her home.
I promise.

OFFICER : Go with the vitals on Undersheriff Ecklie.
Tachycardia in the 120.
BP: 82/40 and dropping.
O2 sats What's his condition?
Stable but critical.
I'm going with him.
Russell's granddaughter's been kidnapped.
What?!
It sounds like it's McKeen.
Uh, I've tried Nick three times.
He's not picking up.
Okay, I'll...
I'll handle things here.
You should go to Russell's.
Be careful.
CRENSHAW: Where's your car?
: I can't drive.
We'll take mine.
Where are we going?
Relax.
Enjoy the ride.



How's Maya?
I gave her something to calm her.
I never thought I would see that in your hand again.
Neither did I.

SIDLE: Russell... we found some shoe impressions.
Some standard work boots.
I'm not sure we're gonna get anything.
And this didn't come from your house, right?
Uh...
Could be transfer from the kidnapper.
I'm gonna get it to Hodges.
Uh, listen, th-there's something else that you need to know.
&quot;Property of LVPD&quot;&quot;
Found it under the window.
We're looking at a cop.
You call Brass, and you tell him I don't want to see anyone here who's not one of his guys.
SIDLE: So, what do you want to do?
Just work-work the case, please.
Dad.
Hey, buddy.
BRASS: Officer Tracey.
You're relieved of your duty.
Officer Mitchell will take over.
Now.

You don't look like my bus driver.
You know, I've been stuck in this cell sucking my thumb for three hours, waiting for my transport back to Ely.
On your feet.

I'm traveling light these days, Jim.
Goes with the uniform.

I don't know how you've been communicating with your people on the outside, but however you've been doing it, it's over.
You don't talk to anyone, you don't see anyone.
Not even my lawyer?
Man's got his rights.
Not anymore.
Is D.B. on board with this?
'Cause I think he's really gonna want to talk to me.
Anything happens to that little girl...
...I got people, too.
So this is where you take all your girls?
This is where I'm taking you.


Moreno?
Yeah.
Mmm.
He had his chance.
Hey, maybe this is a bad idea.
That's what makes it so good.

You asked for a good time, here it is.

FINLAY: Yeah.
Nick? Where are you?
I have been calling and calling.
And McKeen unleashed hell... tonight on Russell and Ecklie, and his guys may be after you, and I know that you said that you quit, but could you call me, please?
I, uh... I need your help.
I need to know that you're all right.


Hey, don't worry, we're safe, everybody.
The police are here.
CSI Stokes.
Lot of people looking for you tonight.
Well, thank you for the information, Mr. Clean.
Well, I'm just minding my own business.
Ruining business, according to the liquor store owner.
We can take you in for drunk and disorderly.
You're right--
I am a little drunk.
But if you two chuckleheads don't beat it...
...it's gonna get disorderly.
Man's got a gun, Hank.
Oh, this?
Yes, he does.
: Whoa...
You're a little slow on the draw there, Hank.
I don't even need this.
There's one beer left.
I'll fight you for it.
Could shoot you for it.
You do think she was just kidnapped, right?
I don't know what to think.
Well, I know one thing: you shouldn't be doing this.
It's a conflict of interest, and the evidence will be challenged in court.
Yeah, I'm not really thinking about court right now, Sara.
You want to open up that kit, or you gonna just stand there?
He's still in surgery.
I'll be all right, David.
Y-You should get back to work.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Okay, but if-if you need anything, call me.
Yeah.
I, uh... found this change of clothes in your locker.
I remember a car... the sound of a gun...
...my-my father lying there, but... I didn't see anything, anyone.
I'm useless!
Still no word from Finn?
No.
But Brass talked to Moreno, and evidently, Moreno got a text from Finn and... he's worried.
Moreno?
You think we can trust him?
Well, he's gonna be here in a few minutes.
You can ask him yourself.
More transfer.
Same as I found outside.
This comes with a bonus.
Hair.
ECKLIE: Karma, Jeffrey.
Your son paid for your sins.
One phone call from me, and your family's living out of a car.
You leave my family out of this, D.B.
Karma-- what's it mean?
Ecklie's words.
McKeen's sending me the same message.
KATIE : No...!

I guess I, uh, I should get all this back to the lab.
I've been calling you.
But I think you know that.

Yeah, I'm done talking.
I didn't come here to talk, Nick.
I'm came to drag your ass back to work.
So, how many beers have you had exactly?
Mm... not enough.
Look, I already told you, Sara-- I quit.
Not tonight.
Tomorrow, you can do whatever you want.
This is usually the kind of place we shut down.

Oh, I'm-I'm good.
You're not on duty.
No.
Or are you?

I'm bored.
Thought you wanted to see how far this was going to go.
Yeah, where's it going to go?
Where is it going to go?
Let's go, guys.
Door at the end of the hall.
You gonna tell me what's behind the door?
Come on.
This is what you came for.
Isn't it?
If you were going to kill me, you would have done it already.
We could've had so much fun.
We still can.
Open the door.
Katie.

You're late.
ROBBINS: Are you sure you want to do this?
I have to.
I am going to kill him.
You said they would call.
D.B.?
You said they'd call.
They will.
I like that.
Is that a new painting?
I-I've been working on it for a few weeks.
I hadn't noticed.
I guess that's been happening a lot lately.
I'm sorry.
That's the view from our bedroom up in Seattle, right?
You miss it?
That's not a very good question to ask me right now.
I'm sorry, I don't know what...

The only thing worse than the thought of losing Katie is the thought of losing both of you.
That is not going to happen.
D.B.?
You hear from Finn?
BRASS: No.
MORENO: As you know, I got a text message from her a couple hours ago.
She was with Crenshaw, said she was onto something.
And she wanted me to follow her on the GPS.
We were tracking her toward downtown.
The signal went dead somewhere around Maryland Parkway.
Wait, what do you mean it &quot;went dead&quot;?
Crenshaw's got a jammer.
Why-Why would you do that?
Why would you leave her alone with some guy you know is dirty?
She wanted to be alone.
And there's no way that I could have seen this coming.
You know something -- you ought to...
Listen, look, look.
I think McKean has blindsided all of us on this one.
Radio call, sir.
Detective Crenshaw-- he's asking for CSI Russell.
Well, so much for a tracing a call.
This is Russell.
CRENSHAW: I got someone who wants to say hello.
Hey, it's me.
RUSSELL: Where are you?
Uh, can't say, but I'm with Katie.
And she's okay.
Grandpa!
KATIE: I'm scared.
Hey, Katie.
That was proof of life.
They said that if you want to see her again...
...you have to talk to McKeen.
Tell those sons of bitches if they lay a hand on...

This is okay.
Where's McKeen?
He's in holding.
Now, this isn't just about McKeen's dead son.
His empire is crumbling.
He's burning the house down.
He's trying to take us all with it.
I'm sorry.
Did Sara give you some hairs to run?
Geez, what happened to your face?
The hairs, please.
Right.
Well, there were no tags, but DNA wouldn't help anyway.
'Cause I can tell you right now, they didn't come from any kidnapper.
I pulled exemplars for comparison.
Uh, hair's not human.
It's bovine.
Could still be transfer, brought in on this guy.
Maybe we're looking for some sort of dairy farm, or ranch.
Lots of those in the Central Valley.
Maybe Hodges can help you narrow it down.
I wish I had better news for you.
The white trace you found in the shoe impression and in Katie's bedroom is a composite of calcium hydroxide, gypsum and quartz.
Plaster.
Generic, at that.
Not exactly a game-changer.
Patrol found a car matching the description of one fleeing the scene where Ecklie was shot.
This was in the backseat.
Where's the car now?
It's in the garage.
Mandy's on it.
I'm going to process the gun and someone needs to go back to the hospital to pick up the pellets that were removed from Ecklie.
I'll go.
DOCTOR: That's about all we can do for now.
Okay.
He's going to be okay.
That's good news.
I thought I lost him.
The whole time in the... in the waiting room, I kept thinking to myself, if he dies, it's my fault.
There's nothing you could've done.
That's not what I mean.
When I was a kid...
I was so angry at him.
Do you know how many times I prayed... that he would get shot?
That's not your fault, either.
I'm sorry.
Where's your buddy Brass?
This is what you want, isn't it?
Maybe it's what you want.
I'm in no mood for games.
So there is a real cop in there somewhere.
That's good to know.
'Cause maybe then we can have an understanding.
What is it that you want?
You want to trade my granddaughter for your freedom?
Is that it?
Don't insult me, D.B.
That'll never be on the table.
You know, you CSIs, you're all the same.
You're-you're so busy with your black-lights and your little tweezers and your spray bottles.

Who do you think you're kidding with that thing?
What do you want?
What do I want?
What do I want?
You know, you were so obsessed with the &quot;how, &quot;that you never asked yourself the &quot;why&quot;-- Why Donny Price got popped. Why Veronica Gilmore was beaten to death. Why Jack Gilmore was &quot;innocently&quot; framed?
You're saying Jack Gilmore wasn't innocent?
I'm saying Jack Gilmore used his whore of a wife to steal $2 million in drug money from Donny Price.
From me.
Collateral for his stadium.
I want what's mine.
For my family.
You want me to get $2 million?
From Jack Gilmore?
You get me my money back and you get your granddaughter back.
You got 12 hours.
Now I got people waiting by a phone, and if they don't hear from me, well, eh...

I take care of your family, you take care of mine.
Is that it?
Karma.


;
Where's Grandpa?
Will he find us?
Aw, honey.
Don't worry.
I am going to bring you home to see him, okay?
And Grandma.
Mommy, too?
Of course you're going to see your mommy.
Okay, but until then, I really need you to be brave.
Okay.
Okay.

I'm scared.
Hey. I am going to go up there and look at that.
And you go sit down.
Okay.
How are you supposed to get Jack Gilmore to give you $2 million?
I have no idea.
Brass said the guy's dropped out of sight.
Vanished.
Probably hiding from McKeen, right?
Card's clean, no prints.
Tear it apart-- ink, card stock, paper, maybe it'll tell us where it came from.
And who put it together.

Yeah?
Maya just talked to Ryan.
His flight was canceled.
He's catching the next plane, but...
Well, she's hysterical.
She's asking for you.
All right, I-I'm on my way.
If you get anything, call me right away.
We're down to ten hours and counting.
STOKES: McKeen's number one guy.
Kimball is definitely our kidnapper.
Well, the text and images on these letters looks like some sort of escort rag.
Like magazines you see on the streets downtown, right?
Advertisements for strip joints, s*x clubs, brothels.
STOKES: Yeah, but they all look the same.
Well, luckily, not to the micro-FTIR.
I ran the paper stock.
It's Zurvan Photo Select M-1.
Discontinued in '08.
Pretty specific.
According to the manufacturer, only one printing company in Vegas used it.
Place went out of business a couple months ago.
Who's using the old paper to print ads for hookers?
Maybe the new tenants.
A s*x club called PD7.
Okay, honey, keep going.
I'm scared.
I know.
It's okay.
You can do it.

What's that?
CRENSHAW: Hey!
What the hell?
Open this damn door!
Katie, I need you to go now and I need you to go fast.
Go, sweetie, fast.
I'll find you.

Kick it in.
What the hell?
I got the back, you take the front.






I told you we were going to have so much fun.

You okay?
Yeah, we've have to find Katie.
Oh! She's not in there.

Where the hell is she?
Katie!
Katie!

FINLAY: I am sorry.
I just thought that if I could get her out--
RUSSELL: I don't need you to think.
I need you to be smart, Finn.
Wh-Why would you let yourself get separated like that?
She's a child, for Godake.
And now she's out there all by herself.
All right, all right, look.
There-There's four hours left on McKeen's deadline.
Get to the hospital.
Check yourself out.
And then go back to the lab.
I'm fine.

We will find her.
Please calm down and go and talk to your daughter.
MORENO: We searched the building and the surrounding area.
No Katie.
Brass put a BOLO out on Kimball's car.
And your team's processing the club.
That's it.
Don't beat yourself up.
You found Katie.
I was supposed to bring her home.
You did what you could.
Thanks for saving my life.
You knew I would.
I was...  so happy to have a moment to myself.
To let you read to her.
Put her to bed.

And now...
Please don't do this to yourself.
Please don't.
When I was little, I always felt so safe.
You always made me feel so safe.
You said that no harm could come to us.
To our home.
This isn't our home.
What is this place?
I-I hate it.
Hey, hey, come on.
We can't give up hope, all right?

I know what happened.
When we were in Seattle.
The murders on campus.
You lied to me back then.

And now... stop lying.
I was trying to protect us...
Stop lying.

Hey.
Hey.
You're okay.
Ah, thank God.
You're going to be okay, too.
Yeah?
It was McKeen, wasn't it?
Mm-hm.
He go after anybody else?
He, uh, got Russell's granddaughter.
They're looking for her now.
You can't worry about that.
You ha...
You have to get your rest and you have to get strong.
I'm glad you're here.
I love you, M.
I love you too, Dad.

So you followed the evidence... but you didn't get her back.
Where is she?
It's not going to be that easy, D.B.
Where?
You didn't really think I was going to give her back to you alive, did you?
Ah, that's what I thought.
Just like Stokes.

STOKES: That's a good kill.
Don't worry, I got your back.
Russell?
Hey, Russell.
Where are we?
Uh, Sara found more plaster and bovine hair in Crenshaw's car.
Well, what good is that?
I mean, we're already speculating that these guys are spending time at a ranch or a farm somewhere.
Not just somewhere.
Right there.
ROBBINS: Found a fungus in Crenshaw's lungs.
Coccidioides Immitis.
Causes Valley Fever.
There's been a cluster of cases reported in that area.
This is like 40 square miles of desert.
I mean, how the hell are we supposed to...
We have one hour left on McKeen's deadline.
One hour.
That is, if-if Finn's botched attempt to rescue Katie hasn't gotten her killed already.
So, if she's alive, cow hair and Valley Fever are not going to bring her home.
Bring me something that can, will you, please?
Go!

Hey. How's Maya?

I'm gonna have to call you back.
Are you deaf?
Or is this you quitting again?
You got something you want to say?
After Jack Gilmore's wife was murdered, Finlay got a warrant from Brass for his phone.
It's still active.
And he's still making phone calls.
Everybody is looking for Jack Gilmore.
I know where to find him.


Hey, Jack.
Hey, you want to tell me what the hell this is about?
McKeen told me about the $2 million in drug money that you had your wife steal from Donny Price.
That's why McKeen had them killed and you kept your mouth shut, even when he tried to frame you.
He wants his money back.
I-I-I don't know what you're talking about.
I don't have much time.

Come on, man.
Who you kidding?
You're not going to shoot me.
You're the good cop.
I'm not.
I quit last night.
All right, guys, look... you're a little late, okay?
What does that mean-- &quot;late&quot;?
That means that I already gave McKeen the money.
Hey, I swear to God.
My lawyer made the drop.
Ask him.
You didn't think two million bucks was going to get your granddaughter back from a guy like McKeen, did ya?

She's dead.

OFFICER : David-64, secured rooftop of adjacent building.
What the hell were you thinking?
You lied to me.
I didn't lie to you.
You told me that Gilmore was nowhere to be found.
We found him with your warrant, so you knew where he was the whole time, right?
Stokes, shut up.
Yeah, that's right.
Gilmore was a material witness in an ongoing police corruption investigation.
Which, by the way, you completely screwed up by going going full cowboy on some scheme to extort drug money for ransom.
No, no, listen to me.
We're talking about my granddaughter.
What, you think don't understand that?
No, I don't.
You're not behaving that way.
Hey, you know what?
Look, when you processed your own house, I didn't say anything.
When you walked into McKeen's cell by yourself, I didn't stop you.
You want to know why I didn't tell you where Gilmore was?
Because I knew it would end up exactly like this.
Look, don't you get it?
McKeen knew he was going to get his money.
The only thing he couldn't get was Gilmore.
He needed you to find him.
So...
: D.B., go home.
Be with your family.
BRASS: Get some CSIs here.
Hey.
Barbara called you, huh?
Yeah, I can see why.
You're lying in Katie's bed in case files.
She's really worried about you.
I can't believe how wrong I've been.
I mean, this whole time, willing myself to believe that she's still alive when the facts say so clearly that she is.
I'm, I'm not losing it.
Just... listen to this.
Yes, Katie should be dead, but so should you.
After proof of life, they didn't need you, but they kept you both alive. Why?
In your case, 'cause Crenshaw is a scumbag and he wanted something more than just your life, but, but Katie-- Kimball didn't just see a hostage.
He saw a child.
I mean, look at this, the guy is divorced, right?
He's got three kids.
Th-The youngest one is like this 7½-year-old little girl, same age as Katie.
Okay, so, going with that, why would Kimball still be in town?
Out of loyalty, right?
He wanted to do one last job for McKeen.
Deliver the $2 million to the family.
Right.
But with the heat on, how does he do that?
I don't know, I don't-- that's the part I don't know, but I don't think he does either.
You know, maybe he's, maybe he's laying low until he can figure out what to do, but I do know he's out there and so's Katie.
We have 40 square miles of desert and all we have is cow hair and plaster.
I know, I know.
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.
I can't believe it.
What?
What?
I didn't even see that.
Damn it!
D.B.!
Look at that. See that?
It's not, it's not hair and plaster, it's hair in plaster.
Before World War II, they used to use animal hair in plaster as, as a binding agent or something.
There can't be that many houses out there from that era still standing in the desert.
SIDLE: You're right,
I've got the county assessor records in front of me now.
Nine properties fit the description.
Any of them have a connection to McKeen?
SIDLE: I'm going through the deeds-- nothing so far.
I found a cartridge case on the rooftop across from where Gilmore was shot.
It's a .223.
Matches the bullet that killed him.
Tell me you got a print.
I did, and a hit-- an ex-cop named Earl Whitson.
He, uh, grew up with McKeen.
SANDERS: Actually, McKeen is the godfather to his daughter.
I checked cell phone records.
He was in the vicinity last night, when Ecklie was shot.
That can't be a coincidence.
SIDLE: It's not-- because Mm-mm.
I have a Mary Whitson at 21525
Sage Willow Road, off Highway 26.
RUSSELL: Call Brass.
We have a deal.
Let's go.
Earl Whitson.
Yeah, retired cop.
Dave Beck... Dennis Melky.
Both worked Vice with Kimball.
Hmm, probably worked for McKeen, too.
BRASS: Kimball is obviously tying up loose ends.
OFFICER: It's all clear.
Didn't find the girl.

OFFICER : Suspect sighted-- rear of the house.
Vehicle on the move.


Hold it right there.
Drop the gun now.
Give it up, Paul.
Gave up everything a long time ago, when I got in bed with McKeen.
Come on, there's still time to make some of it right.

I'm a lot of things.
But not a rat.

Where is she?
Should have let me die.
Where's the girl?
She's here.
Oh, God.

The man told me to hide.
I cut my hand.
♪ ♪
♪ ♪
It's time to go home, boys.
Actually, McKeen, your bus isn't going back to Ely.
See, I made a humanitarian phone call to the governor, reminding him how hard it is for a cop to, to survive in general population.
Where?
Federal facility, Indiana, and for your own safety you will be in isolation for the rest of your life.
Oh, yeah, and the, um, that $2 million-- that was donated to the crime lab in your family's name.
You have a nice trip.
TV NEWS ANCHOR: A promising development tonight in the corruption investigation of the LVPD.
Detective Paul Kimball is cooperating with the D.A.'s Office and arrests were made today of more officers linked to the former Undersheriff Jeffrey McKeen.
The commission report is due out--
Sounds like the LVPD is making a comeback.
How about you, Nick?
What about me?
I don't know; I haven't talked to Russell yet.
This isn't about Russell.
Words have consequences, you know.
I mean, if you say you quit, you need to mean it.
You quit.
Well, yeah, but I didn't say it out loud.
I left a note at Reception for Grissom and I walked right on out of here.
And you're still here, so don't preach to me about integrity.
Okay?
Wait a minute.
I am not preaching to you about integrity.
Kind of are a little bit, don't you think?
I went away for a while and I got my head together.
You got a lot of nerve to talk to me about quitting, you really do.
All right, all right, all right, all right.
This is not how family treats each other.
Actually it is, but we are also a team, and that means that we have to trust that we have each other's back, no matter what.
So are you in or are you out?
You shouldn't be looking at those.
Why?
This is our life, isn't it?
That's not fair.
I can't live like this anymore.
What do you mean?
Oh, Barbara, don't do this, please.
FINLAY: I'm gonna head out.
D.B., D.B.--
Are you okay?
Yeah, yeah.
Sorry.
No, it's all good.
Jules, are you gonna stay for dinner?
Oh, I'd love to.
Great.
Thank you.
Honey, will you come help me in the kitchen?
I can help.
No, no, I got it.
Hey, come here, come here.

<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS FIELD - LATE DAY]</p>
<p>(Camera cuts to a view of open plains and dry fields. Just over the hill is an empty construction site with large machinery, white pipes and other materials.)</p>
<p>(In the background, we hear a horse neighing and off in the distance, we can see a single horse and rider approaching the site.)</p>
<p>(Cut to a closer view as the horse and rider approach the site.)</p>
<p>(The horse starts to struggle against the rider.)</p>
<p><strong>Rider</strong>: What is wrong with you?</p>
<p>(She gets off of the horse, puzzled at what could have gotten the horse spooked. As she checks out the large pipe directly in front of the horse, she finds a dead body hidden inside.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(BRASS and GRISSOM check the dump site out. All around them, the field is covered with officers.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: A girl in a culvert pipe ... at a highway construction site in the middle of an alfalfa field. </p>
<p>(BRASS waits for GRISSOM to finish. GRISSOM looks at BRASS.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You got anything to add?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Nothing as poetic. </p>
<p>(BRASS reaches into his coat pocket for his notebook and starts to read from it.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Just, uh, road crew took off at 3:00. Body was discovered 5:15.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Who found the body?</p>
<p>(BRASS turns to indicate the girl standing next to her horse just beyond the police tape.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Our friend, Flicka.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, there goes that theory.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What's that?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Whoever finds the body is the first suspect.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (o.s.) Uh, Grissom ...</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns to see SARA standing next to another culvert pipe. He and BRASS walk over to her.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What do you got?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The one thing you don't want to find at a murder scene.</p>
<p>(On the ground next to the culvert pipe, he sees it.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: A second body ...</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO: END OF TEASER. ROLL TITLE CREDITS.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and ROBBINS stand between the two bodies on their respective tables. The wall clock reads 6:00.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Who'd you like to start with?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Which one died first?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Identical body temps and vitreous humor. Both women died approximately 12 hours ago.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: My Uncle Phil used to say you can't kill two birds with one stone.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: All I can tell you is cause of death. Injury to the cervical spine. Looks to be hands-on.</p>
<p>(Quick POV of the dark-haired deceased's neck. View changes to an X-Ray POV where we can see her spine and neck. Her spine breaks. End of POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Somebody snapped her neck.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: She died instantly. Now, the blond.</p>
<p>(They turn to the other body.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Contusion to the forehead, not fatal. Whatever cut her face cut her arm. I found glass in all the incised wounds. Except for these abrasions on her neck.</p>
<p>(Camera close up of the scratches on her neck.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Fingernails maybe. Possible sign of struggle.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: I swabbed the abrasions for foreign DNA sent it to the lab. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Cause of death?</p>
<p>(ROBBINS shows him the cut on her upper right arm. Camera close up of the cut moves to a CGI POV of the artery and a piece of sharp glass cutting the artery. The artery bleeds. End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Severed brachial artery. She bled out.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Something doesn't seem right. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns to the dark-haired body.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Brunette ... </p>
<p>[CLOSE-CAPTIONED-GRISSOM: Look at her neck.]</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Elaborate tattoos ... perfectly dyed hair. </p>
<p>(He shows ROBBINS her left ear with multiple piercings. He lifts up the sheet and shows him her pierced navel and scorpion tattoo.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Multiple body piercing. Tells me she craved attention.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Blonde ... seems almost prosaic. She doesn't even have pierced ears. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks under the sheet.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: She didn't shave her legs.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: A wildflower and a wallflower.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So, besides time of death, what do our dead flowers have in common?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<hr />
[EXT. PARK WOODS - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The PARK RANGER leads CATHERINE, NICK and DAVID PHILLIPS out to the dead body leaning against the tree. DAVID puts his kit down and checks out the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Park Ranger</strong>: Found his SUV in the turnout after closing so I scoped out the area. He should've been wearing his orange vest.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, it looks like a through and through. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: He bled out.</p>
<p>(NICK picks up the rifle.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hunting rifle. Winchester 70.</p>
<p>(DAVID takes out a thermometer and moves the deceased's arm aside. The PARK RANGER leans in curious.)</p>
<p><strong>Park Ranger</strong>: Wait, what are you doing there?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Checking liver temperature. Estimating time of death.</p>
<p>(DAVID sticks the thermometer into the bullet hole.)</p>
<p><strong>Park Ranger</strong>: Should be a total of five bullets.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Four in the magazine, one in the chamber. All accounted for. This rifle was never fired.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE snaps some pictures. DAVID removes the thermometer and checks it.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: 88.6 -- ten degrees below normal.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So he died approximately ten hours ago.</p>
<p><strong>Park Ranger</strong>: That would make it about 2:00 P.M.</p>
<p><strong>David</strong>: Nick, Catherine, he's all yours.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Thanks, David. Okay, let's see who you are ... </p>
<p>(DAVID moves aside. CATHERINE reaches for the deceased's wallet and checks his identification.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Nevada license.</p>
<p>[The Nevada Driver's License reads: </p>

JASPER, JAMES<br />
2974 WESTFALL AVE. LAS VEGAS, NV 89156<br />
CLASS A ENDORSE ]</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: James Jasper.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: When's hunting season?</p>
<p><strong>Park Ranger</strong>: Deer season opened last week. Record number of permits.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, you were right -- he should've been wearing his orange safety vest.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to a hunter with a rifle looking through its scope.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) Hunter lays in wait, spots a deer. Hunter fires ...</p>
<p>(The hunter looks down the scope and fires.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) ... deer takes off ... but the bullet keeps going until it stops. </p>
<p>(The camera follows the bullet. The dear takes off, but the bullet pierces whatever is in its path. The bullet, in this case, pierces some brown-colored material. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No bullet in the body.</p>
<p>(NICK kneels down and checks the tree.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No bullet in the tree.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It's got to be somewhere.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - GRISSOM'S OFFICE]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks into his office reading a file and carrying his case. He's smiling. He closes the file. SARA walks in.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I processed the crime scene. Lots of treads and tracks, but nothing salient.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What about the culverts?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I came up empty. I worked from the victims out till I hit the highway. Nothing. Nothing to process, no follow-up, zip. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns around and gives SARA the &quot;look&quot; which she recognizes immediately.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You have something.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Print lab ID'd one of the vics.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Blond or brunette?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Brunette. Joan Marks. At 18, she was booked for felony shoplifting. Lived at home, we got the address. Warrick grabbed a uniform. He's on his way there with a warrant.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. PARK WOODS -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Through a night scope POV, NICK scans the woods hoping to find something. He takes a couple of steps, turns and tries again. This time, he finds a bullet lodged in a tree. He smiles.)</p>
<p>(NICK walks up to the bullet in the tree. He calls over his shoulder.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Catherine!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You find the bullet?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks over.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah. But how am I going to get it out of there without damaging it.</p>
<p>(NICK sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You know what the textbook says -- if you're not a hundred percent sure how to collect it, bring the whole thing in.</p>
<p>(NICK looks up at the extremely tall tree.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, I'll figure it out.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE smiles, pats him on the shoulder, then leaves.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS RURAL COMMUNITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[EXT. MARKS' RESIDENCE - HOUSE - DAY]</p>
<hr />
[EXT. /INT. DONNA MARKS' RESIDENCE -- GARAGE - DAY]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and SARA check in with the officer outside. They walk into the garage carrying their kits.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: SARA opens the car door and sits in the car behind the wheel. GRISSOM opens the passenger door and kneels down to look inside.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Twelve hundred miles and it's an older model. Driver doesn't get out much. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM opens the passenger door and looks in the glove compartment. He pulls out the car registration paper.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Registered to a Donna Marks.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Could be our blond. Related to Joan Marks. I'll check with DMV.</p>
<p>(WARRICK walks up to the car. GRISSOM and SARA stand up.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I already did. 28 years old, blonde, blue eyes, 125 pounds, five-six ... sound familiar? </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: That's her.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Uniform's talking to a neighbor. Donna is Joan's older sister.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (chuckling): Well ... we know what they have in common now, don't we?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Genetics. House belonged to their mother. Donna's lived here alone since their mother died. Joan lived in Henderson. The real action's around back.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. DONNA MARKS' RESIDENCE - BACKYARD - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(On the outside patio floor, there is broken glass everywhere. Markers are on the ground where evidence needs to be examined. WARRICK shows GRISSOM and SARA the broken glass door.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: If the highway was the dump site, this is the primary.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Makes sense. The blonde's lacerations were filled with glass.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: She went through that door.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: From inside out.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and SARA walk into the kitchen and look at the broken door. WARRICK crosses under the police tape.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: To take out one of these doors you need some serious momentum. </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No doubt. I'm going to collect the glass. And then I'll start with the doorframe.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How are you at solving puzzles?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You're the puzzle guy.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I have a hint for you. When they cool sheet glass, they lay it out on tin.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So the side that kissed up to the tin will fluoresce under UV.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Still going to be a long couple of days at the lab.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I got some imprints on these blood spots here. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM and SARA both kneel to look at what WARRICK'S looking at. In front of marker #2, there's a partial shoe print in blood.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Looks like the killer may have stepped in Donna's blood.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Or maybe her sister stepped in it. There was some blood on Joan Marks' right shoe. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to SARA looking down at the body's right shoe. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hmm. That would place Joan at the house.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And establish a timeline.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: If Joan did step in Donna's blood that would mean that Donna was injured and bleeding while Joan was still walking around.</p>
<p>[INT. DONNA MARKS RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM stands and walks into the kitchen. He stops to look at the refrigerator and notices the take out order sheets pined to the door. The first is for &quot;Pizza Land #2&quot; (Italian Kitchen), the second for &quot;Capt Krauser Cookin&quot;<br />
(Free Delivery) and the third for &quot;Free Delivery [(702)-555-2438]. SARA also stands to see what GRISSOM'S looking at.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM puts on his gloves and opens the refrigerator door. Inside are containers of take-out food. He reaches in and opens the top container. He smells it and holds it out for SARA to smell.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Sweet and sour pork.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It smells fresh.</p>
<p>(He puts it back on the shelf. He grabs another opened container in the back of the refrigerator, smaller than the first. He smells it.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: More sweet and sour.</p>
<p>(He holds it out for SARA to smell. She immediately reacts to the age of the food.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mostly sour.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Single servings in the back, spoiled. Family sized boxes in front, one or two days old.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM picks up another container and opens it. Inside there are four spring rolls.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What do you think? Increase in appetite, or ... perhaps a guest?</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. DONNA MARKS OFFICE - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(SARA pushes the door to the study open. She and GRISSOM both walk inside. Against the far wall behind the door are a stack of fedex boxes. The computer on the desk is still on.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Universal remote. She could do everything she wanted from this chair but cook a roast.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM sits down behind the desk.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, we already know she cooks like I do -- takeout on speed dial. </p>
<p>(SARA riffles through the stack of catalogs on the desk.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Pottery barn, Lillian Vernon magnolia, Yafa Pen ... She's a catalogue junkie -- we're on the same mailing lists.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Catalogues, the internet, mail order, takeout ... 1,200 miles on her car. Agoraphobic maybe? Or she just doesn't like people?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (smiling) Ah, that's you talking.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'll haul in her PC, check her e-mail look in on her social life.</p>
<p>(SARA turns around and looks at the bathroom.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey ... the toilet seat's up.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns around and looks at the bathroom. He sees it, too.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: There was a man here.</p>

<p>(CATHERINE turns the hallway corner.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Nick.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks up to NICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Tell me what you got?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Coroner said it's cut and dry. Bullet severed an abdominal artery.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Trajectory?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Front to back. Straight across. Round entered one inch to the right of the umbilicus. Bullet's with ballistics. Vega's got the widow. They're ready for us.</p>

[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - WAITING ROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE, NICK and DET. VEGA interview MRS. JASPER. She speaks slowly, still stunned by the news.)</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Jasper</strong>: Jimmy left early, before I got up. When he didn't come home for dinner I just figured that he got himself a deer.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Did he go by himself?</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vega</strong>: He took a day off of work in the middle of the week?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Jasper</strong>: Well, um, we had both been laid off recently. He was in insurance. He was an auditor.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And how was your husband handling that?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Jasper</strong>: Well, you know, he was okay. I mean, uh ... we had to borrow money from his folks to pay the rent. That was hard on him.</p>
<p>(She turns to CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Jasper</strong>: I have to call them. I haven't called them, I ... </p>
<p>(She moves to stand up. CATHERINE stops her.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mrs. Jasper, was your husband an experienced hunter?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Jasper</strong>: Yes. Since he was a kid. (sighs) He always looked forward to deer season. But, with the baby and all, he missed the last few.</p>
<p>(She starts to cry.)</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Jasper</strong>: It's me. Isn't it? I encouraged him to go. I thought that it would help him take his mind off things. Oh ... what am I going to do?</p>
<p>(DET. VEGA and NICK look at each other.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Can you think of any reason James wasn't wearing a safety vest?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Jasper</strong>: (sighs) No. I mean, he was always so careful. That doesn't sound right.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Did she tell you she was going to her sister's?</p>

<p><strong>Gavin Pallard</strong>: No. Boring. Was always glued to her computer. Plus Joan thought Donna owed her rent and ... the house was in both their names, so ... </p>

<p>(Something yellow drips down on SARA'S goggles. She wipes it away with her finger.)</p>
<p>(She rolls out from under the car. GRISSOM is kneeling next to the front tires waiting for her. SARA sits up and removes her goggles.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Radiator's cracked.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, that might explain why Joan bought coolant twice in the last week from a convenience store. We ran her credit cards.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well ... whoever drove this puppy last filled up the radiator fluid but, instead of coolant, they used water.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Either someone unfamiliar with the car, or ... someone in a desperate situation maybe.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Radiator cap. I'll print it.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Good. (GRISSOM reaches up and grabs a container, which he hands to SARA.) Grab me a sample of fluid, too, will you?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM stands and leaves.)</p>

[INT. CSI - LAB]</p>
<p>(NICK sprays something on JAMES JASPERS' clothing.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Gunshot residue.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Expect the unexpected. GSR on the clothing means the victim was shot at close range.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: A gun being fired and hitting clothing. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So now what? We're thinking murder?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Or suicide.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: He never fired his rifle. What'd he shoot himself with?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay. But if he was murdered, we should've found some evidence of the killer at the crime scene.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, not to mention whoever shot him would've been eyeball-to-eyeball. Who could've gotten that close without Mr. Jasper putting up a struggle?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks at NICK, waiting for him to reach the same conclusion she's reached.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Somebody he knew. I'm going to call O'Riley see if he's checked out Mrs. Jasper's alibi. I'll meet you at the car.</p>
<p>(NICK leaves the lab.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: All right.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, Sara. (He turns around.) Hey, how's your case going?</p>
<p>(SARA stops and turns around.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You ever try to print a radiator cap? Smudge city.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah. Yeah, I know, it's impossible. But it's just a radiator cap so give yourself a break.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>(SARA starts to leave.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, Sara ... (she stops and turns around again.) ... you gotta get out more.</p>

<p>(GREG holds up the sample of radiator water as he looks at it. GRISSOM leans against the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: So you got this water from a radiator?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, it ain't no Rocky Mountain Spring.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What is it, Greg?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Nasty sodium count. Potassium, phosphorus.</p>
<p>(GREG hands the test results to GRISSOM to look at. GRISSOM looks up, thinking.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (smiling) You've got that look. What did I say right?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM doesn't say anything. He puts the test results back on the table and leaves the lab.)</p>

[EXT. WOODS - DAY]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and NICK walk through the woods. NICK finishes up his phone call and hangs up.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (on phone) Okay. Thanks for the info. We'll keep you posted. (hangs up) Well, Mrs. Jasper's alibi checks out. She was at work from 2:00 A.M. To<br />
6:00 P.M. Ate lunch at her desk.</p>
<p>(They reach the scene and put their kits down.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: She didn't kill her husband.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Murder for hire?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: A pro would've shot him in the heart.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: This guy was shot in the gut. Bullet didn't even come close to his spinal cord. </p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV of the bullet piercing through the cloth, through flesh and exiting out the back and through into the woods. End of CGI POV.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Wait a minute now. Abdominal injuries take time to bleed out. But it would've taken at least ten minutes for hemorrhagic shock to set in and he would've been mobile.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Right. But he never moved. He was standing in front of this tree when he was shot. He didn't try to get to his car, get help, he just ... sat down and waited to die.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah. Yeah, I see where you're going here. His injuries and his behavior aren't consistent with murder. But they're not consistent with suicide either.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Ninety-nine out of 100 suicides by gun ... muzzle to the mouth, bullet to the brain. But there's always just that one.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Look, suicidals want it quick and painless. Bleeding to death is slow and painful. Not to mention, he never fired his rifle.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No, the weapon we found was never fired.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (laughs) That-that's a big stretch. He brought his rifle plus a spare?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: He shoots himself in the gut leaving himself time to hide the weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, but there's no blood trail. What'd he do with the spare, throw it up a tree?</p>
<p>(NICK looks up at the trees above. CATHERINE takes a walk out toward the lake.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: How about the lake?</p>
<p>(NICK turns around. He's starting to see the possibilities.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah. Yeah, okay-- heads up.</p>
<p>(NICK motions for CATHERINE to move aside. He picks up a rock and tosses it into the lake from where the body was found. The rock lands in the lake with a splash.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I just marked our search area.</p>
<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO:</p>

[EXT. WOODS/ LAKE - DAY]</p>
<p>(Under the water, a metal rod prods along the bottom of the lake. They're looking for the gun.)</p>
<p>(Cut to above water: NICK and CATHERINE are in their rubber swim gear, each carrying a metal rod and prod it along the bottom of the lake.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You know, even if your theory's right, we still haven't explained the insurance policy purchased by the wife.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE hits something. She looks up at NICK. NICK makes his way to CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Metal on metal.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hold up, let me give you a hand.</p>
<p>(NICK reaches into the lake and picks up the gun.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay. Right there.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah. I got it. I got it.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Whoa ... water pistol.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, we never found the bullet, but we found the gun.</p>
<p>(Still standing in the lake, NICK and CATHERINE look over at the tree where the body was found. As if they were watching it replay on the big screen, they see the events unfold.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to JAMES JASPER holding the pistol aimed at his abdomen. He fires. He doubles over in pain, but before he collapses, he tosses the gun into the lake. He then falls to his knees. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(Cut back to NICK and CATHERINE imagining it happening in front of them.)</p>

[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(DET. VEGA brings MRS. JASPER a cup of coffee. She's sitting in the waiting room. CATHERINE sits in the seat across and facing her. VEGA remains standing.)</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Jasper</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mrs. Jasper, you purchased a life insurance policy on your husband in which you are the sole beneficiary.</p>
<p>(She shakes her head.)</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Jasper</strong>: I don't know what you're talking about.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We have the actual application for the policy with your signature.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vega</strong>: Ma'am, you are aware that insurance policies exclude suicide?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Your husband staged his death to look like a homicide. As a beneficiary, if you knew of his intentions to take his own life, that would constitute fraud.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Jasper</strong>: If I knew, I would've stopped him. Jimmy was everything to me.<br />
(CATHERINE glances over and sees NICK signaling to her through the window.) I didn't buy the policy. I didn't know about his plans.</p>
<p>(NICK walks into the waiting room area holding a file folder.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p>(NICK hands CATHERINE the file. She opens it and reads it. She looks up at NICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to NICK) You want to explain this?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE holds the folder out for NICK to take.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Sure. Mrs. Jasper, when you claimed your husband's personal possessions, you signed a release form, yeah?</p>
<p>(She nods her head slightly.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I ran that same form through our questionable documents lab and I cross-checked your signature with the signature on the insurance application here. It's not yours. Your husband must've forged it. I also checked with the insurance company. Your husband opened the account.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Jasper</strong>: (stunned) Why ... ? Why? I don't understand that. Why did he do that?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Because he knew that if he had bought the insurance himself it would've sent up a red flag.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Jasper</strong>: (voice breaking) So what you're saying is ... that my husband killed himself for me?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yes, ma'am.</p>

<p><strong>Willoughby</strong>: Well, it may sound funny but I'm proud of it. Took almost a year to put in my new fertigation system. In automatically mixes the fertilizer with the irrigation system.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How about that? Economical and practical.</p>
<p><strong>Willoughby</strong>: What you're looking for is over here. </p>
<p>(WILLOUGHBY points to something off to the side. They stop walking near a water pipe.) </p>
<p><strong>Willoughby</strong>: Cars are always overheating on this stretch and everyone thinks water's free.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What do you use in your fertilizer? Nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium?</p>
<p><strong>Willoughby</strong>: Standard 6-10-10 mixture. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mr. Willoughby, would you mind if I fingerprint your spigot?</p>
<p><strong>Willoughby</strong>: No one's ever asked me that before.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Thirsty?</p>
<p><strong>Mickey Rutledge</strong>: I'm good, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, I wouldn't drink it either. I wouldn't even put it in my radiator. I don't have all the pieces yet, Mickey, but, uh ... I'll tell you what we do have.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: JOAN MARKS yelling at MICKEY RUTLEDGE in DONNA MARKS' kitchen.)</p>
<p><strong>Joan Marks</strong>: You're an ex-con -- get the hell out of here!</p>
<p>(DONNA MARKS steps between her sister and her guest.)</p>
<p><strong>Donna Marks</strong>: Don't listen to her, Mickey. This is my house. This is my life!</p>

<p>(MICKEY RUTLEDGE turns and walks away. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>

<p>(Quick flashback to DONNA and JOAN struggling in the kitchen. MICKEY RUTLEDGE stands outside the glass door watching.)</p>

<p>(Quick flashback to MICKEY RUTLEDGE over DONNA MARKS' body. He looks up at JOAN MARKS.)</p>
<p><strong>Mickey Rutledge</strong>: She's dead.</p>
<p><strong>Joan Marks</strong>: You're going right back where you came from.</p>
<p>(She turns to leave the kitchen. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(MICKEY RUTLEDGE rests his chin on his clasps his hands, elbows on the table. He sighs heavily.)</p>
<p><strong>Mickey Rutledge</strong>: Rehabilitation was working for me. But you put a guy in that position ... </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: ... He's got to go all the way.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: MICKEY grabs JOAN from behind and breaks her neck. She falls to the floor, dead. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You figured if you hid the bodies, you'd be in the clear.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: But you didn't have a car. Joan did.</p>

<p>(MICKEY gives off a skeptical chuckle. He looks up at SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Mickey Rutledge</strong>: I would've landed myself right back in the joint.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: you don't know that.</p>
<p><strong>Mickey Rutledge</strong>: Come on. Who's going to believe a guy like me?</p>

Without hesitating, she takes the nearest trashcan, opens the refrigerator and throws away all the take-out boxes on the shelves.

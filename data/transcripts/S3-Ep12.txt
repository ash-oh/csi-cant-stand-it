<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - EVENING]</p>
<p>(A dark colored large bird flies across the bottom of the screen.)</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS DESERT (STOCK) - EVENING]<br />
(The shadow of the large bird travels along the rocks below. The bird caws.)</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS MOUNTAINS (STOCK) - EVENING]</p>
<p>(Camera travels birds-eye above the mountains.)</p>
<p>[EXT. FLOYD LAMB STATE PARK -- GROUND -- EVENING]</p>
<p>(A frog sits and croaks under the fallen leaves. A man walks across the screen disturbing the leaves and making the frog jump aside.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: A group of three men walk along the path.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: The bird flies overhead.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: The men continue to walk along the path.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: The bird flies down low along the path and settles on a nest in a tree.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. FLOYD LAMB STATE PARK - EVENING -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(The men approach the bird and quietly. They stop.)</p>
<p><strong>Lead Man 1</strong>: I don't think I can get a clear shot.<br />
(Each of the three men pick up their cameras to take pictures.)</p>
<p><strong>Man 2 (on right)</strong>: It's a peregrine falcon.</p>
<p><strong>Man 3 (on left)</strong>: No, it's not. It's a hawk.</p>
<p><strong>Lead Man 1</strong>: You can't see anything this time of day. We should come back at dawn.</p>
<p><strong>Man 2 (on right)</strong>: But I'm so behind on my life list. I still don't have a western wood-pewee or a solitary sandpiper.</p>
<p><strong>Lead Man</strong>: What, do you think they're going to kick you out of the club?</p>
<p><strong>Man 2 (on right)</strong>: John saw a dickcissel earlier today. It could be gone tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>Lead Man</strong>: John's full of ...</p>
<p>(The bird caws. The men stop to look through their cameras.)</p>
<p><strong>Lead Man</strong>: Corvus corax.</p>
<p><strong>Man 2 (on right)</strong>: A common raven? So what?</p>
<p>CAMERA VIEW:</p>
<p>(The camera focuses and refocuses on the bird. They see that in the bird's mouth, it's carrying an eye.)</p>
<p>(The men put their cameras down.)<br />
CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. FLOYD LAMB STATE PARK -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Camera cuts to: A close up of GRISSOM'S eye. The camera pulls back. He stares at the eye in his hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, someone's missing a contact lens.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and CATHERINE stand on ladders peering into the bird's nest.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: That's not all they're missing.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You know, ravens, like eagles, have been known to travel 30 miles from roost to feeding ground.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: 30 miles in every direction. Pi-r-squared. That means that we're looking at a ... 2,800 mile search area.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: &quot;Once upon a midnight dreary while I pondered weak and weary over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We're up a tree and you're quoting Poe. Give me something.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: &quot;Quoth the raven, 'only this ... and nothing more.'&quot;</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI -- LAB]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM puts the eye in a dish and takes a couple of photos of it.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The raven, caws, picks the eye up off of the ground and flies off. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM picks up the eye and drops liquid on it. He removes the contact lens.)</p>
<p>(He uncaps a syringe and extracts the liquid from the eye and puts it in a tube.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI -- LAB]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE examines the contents of the bird's nest.)</p>
<p>(She picks up a baby toy from inside. She looks at it and smiles. She puts it aside.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks into the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You'll be pleased to know the eyeball was only slightly desiccated.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And what about the iris?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Still blue.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Color distinction means the body's been dead less than 48 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, I sent some vitreous fluid to tox. The rest to DNA. So ... Can you get me an eye for an eye?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, I've got foil ... a leaf ... a feather and plastic.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM picks up the feather and looks at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Feathers. For warmth.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Seagull feathers.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, the only place we'd have seagulls around here would be Lake Mead.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: But only when the fishing's good. And we got some ground limestone.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Not found at Lake Mead. (pause) You know, ravens are incredibly intelligent. They have a brain capacity comparable to dolphins.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Means they know where to shop. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks over at the map on the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We found the eye here. I bet she shopped here where limestone is used as ground cover.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(A very pretty kaleidoscope of bird flying in the sky.)</p>
<hr />
[EXT. PENDALE LAND FILL -- DAY]</p>
<p>(SARA, NICK and CATHERINE walk toward the cell of garbage that they're going to sift through. CATHERINE'S holding the file open.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You know the average Nevadan generates more waste more than three times waste than the average American?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, well, that's tourist trash.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Thirteen million pounds per day. I went to the recycling forum in march.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The landfill manager says this is the active cell. Spotter says cell lift moves forward 20 feet a day. That puts the active cell right ... pretty much in front of us.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Man! You find the best evidence in the nastiest places.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You are what you throw away. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It's like peeling an onion into peoples' lives.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, this onion is our time line so peel back accordingly.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- DAY]</p>
<p>(ROBBINS stands in front of the display of x-rays on the viewer. GRISSOM stands nearby with the file folder in his hands.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: The electrolyte and glucose levels in the eye were normal. Means your victim wasn't dehydrated or diabetic. Other than that ... </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: ... we're flying blind.</p>
<p>(They turn around and head back to the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: David.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Grissom. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM stops and looks at DAVID PHILLIPS.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: A 35-year-old male. Car salesman. Dropped dead at work. Apparent heart attack. Not under the care of a physician. Uh, no history of high blood pressure. Just routine autopsy.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Go for it.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM heads out the front door. DAVID pulls back the sheet.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Yeah, we're all set, Dr. Robbins.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Okay, David. (to recorder) Case 03-615. Postmortem exam of an adult. Caucasian. Male. Identified as Fred Stearns. Body received warm to the touch. Rigor mortis not present. Skull nose, bones are intact by palpation. Irides are brown. Slightly congested. Hmm. Unidentified dry black substance on the front of the teeth. Gingiva and lips. Okay. David, open him up.</p>
<p>(DAVID takes the knife and makes the first cut. He sees blood and stops.)</p>
<p><strong>David</strong>: Uh ... D-Dr. Robbins? </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>David</strong>: Sir, I-I have blood. I have bleeding.</p>
<p>(ROBBINS turns around and heads back to the table. He grabs a cloth to stop the bleeding. DAVID takes the cloth and applies pressure.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Get me my kit. Come on.</p>
<p>(DAVID turns and gets the kit and puts it near the head of the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Hold this. let's go. Keep it tight. That's good, David.</p>
<p>(ROBBINS puts a syringe together and plunges it into FRED STEARNS' chest.)</p>
<p>(Quick CGI to: The needle of the syringe pierces through the heart. The heart starts pumping. End of CGI. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(ROBBINS puts the syringe on the side and checks his vitals.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Pulse is rising. David, string me a suture needle.</p>
<p>(He waves him aside.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Go! Go!</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. PENDALE LAND FILL -- DAY]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE, NICK and SARA search the land fill.)</p>
<p>(After several Dissolves, CATHERINE lifts up a blouse and sees something.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I think I may have something here!</p>
<p>(NICK and SARA make their way toward her.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What've you got?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Whoa!</p>
<p>(CATHERINE pushes the garbage aside and finds the severed limb.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Got a leg.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Obviously female.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Obviously.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE picks it up and hands it to NICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Whew. I'll bag it.</p>
<p>(SARA searches the garbage around the limb. She finds something.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: All right. I got a torso and head. Missing an eye.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The Raven caws, lands and picks at the eye. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(SARA starts to cough.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay, so, uh how hot do you think it is, underneath all this trash?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I don't know, what do you think -- ballpark at 120 degrees?</p>
<p>(NICK bags the leg.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So this is yesterday's trash. Dead body. Minimum 18 hours in this heat.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: She should be totally bloated.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, she's not.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, she's really torn up.</p>
<p>(SARA looks behind her.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Bulldozers are vicious.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Camera downward view of the body/limb and garbage being dumped on it. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, I think they only finished the job. How did she get here?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks into the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Heard you got to be superhero today.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: I consider myself a superhero every day.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Got anything on our lady of the dump?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: C.O.D. is still indeterminate. Blunt force trauma is a possibility. She has some perimortem bruising around the left eye. But limb removal is relatively clean. Definitely postmortem.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So we've got no arms, no prints. What kind of identifying characteristics do we have?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Second degree midline episiotomy scar.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, that narrows it down to more than half the women in this country who gave birth.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: But there might be one other thing. At first I thought appendectomy, but check out her x ray. </p>
<p>(ROBBINS walks over to the view box.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: She's had surgery. Some kind of implant at the L4-L5 interspace. I'll know more when I open her up.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You're my hero, Al.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE smiles over her shoulder at ROBBINS, then turns and leaves.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - LAYOUT ROOM -- DAY]</p>
<p>(SARA and NICK stand over the table full of garbage.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: All right, what do we know?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: That all of this trash was found around the victim. And she was buried with some very expensive trash.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah, there's nothing wrong with this frying pan. Could've gone to goodwill or someplace.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Home pregnancy test. Negative. Better luck next time.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Someone ... does not like frozen peas.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: They weren't shopping at CostCo. They paid way too much for ice cream.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: There's a good chance our vic was wearing this shirt.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Let's start trying to narrow this down to a neighborhood, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Excellent idea. Uh, marker or sort?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Sort. Please.</p>
<p>(SARA opens a pen and turns around to mark the map as NICK sorts through the garbage.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: First up: &quot;178 Spaulding Meadows.&quot; Uh, &quot;174 Storm Cloud Lane.&quot; A second &quot;174 Storm Cloud Lane&quot;.</p>
<p>(SARA marks the wall map.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - OFFICE -- DAY]</p>
<p>(ROBBINS goes over the bagged disc with CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Pulled it from the L4-L5 interspace. Cobalt chromium molybdenum alloy with a titanium coating and an ultra high molecular weight polyethylene component. An artificial spinal disc. If you can recreate a spine the possibilities are endless.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I thought, uh, disc replacement surgery involved fusing bone to bone.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Eh, typically, but it can limit mobility. With that little disc, your body doesn't know the difference. </p>
<p>(Quick CGI to the disc inside the body and moving back and forth.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (V.O.) Matches range of motion, flexibility and an axial rotation of a normal spine. </p>
<p>(End of CGI. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Still in clinical trials. Less than a thousand surgeries have been performed in this country.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, well, I like those odds.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: You'll like this even better. Medium endplate, size 12, polyethylene component and a six-degree lordosis angle. Narrowed it down to one. Amy Ennis. Austin, Texas.</p>
<p>(ROBBINS gives CATHERINE the bagged disc.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Tourist?</p>
<p>(ROBBINS chuckles, turns and heads for the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (laughs) That's for you to find out.</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS COMMUNITY (STOCK) -- DAY]</p>
<hr />
[EXT. STORM CLOUD LANE -- DAY]</p>
<p>(OFFICERS pull out the trash cans onto the road. NICK, CATHERINE and SARA open them up and check them for blood.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, is this all of them?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, every last one on storm cloud lane.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Cans are on private property, it's not trash day, how did you get consent?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I talked to the president of the owner's association.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What'd you threaten her with?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: A return visit.</p>
<p>(SARA sprays the can and finds blood.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey, guys? I got blood.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah. Yeah me, too.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, that makes five.</p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO:</p>
<p>(They pull the five trash cans with the blood stains in them to the middle of the street.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Let's see if any of it's human.</p>
<p>(They each swab and test the blood.)</p>
<p>(SARA'S test shows up not human. NICK'S test shows up as human.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: These two are human.</p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO:</p>
<p>(They pull the two trash cans with the human blood stains in them further across the road, apart from the other cans.)</p>
<p>(SARA looks inside the can.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: If the vic was in here blood would have pooled to the bottom.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, and blood dripped down the side of this one as the hydraulic arm dumped it.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The trash collecting truck dumps the trash can contents into the bin. The trash falls. We see the severed limb inside the bin. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: This is our can.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks at the can, then points.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And that's our house.</p>
<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO:</p>

[EXT. STORM CLOUD LANE - EASTON RESIDENCE -- DAY]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE interviews DANIEL EASTON.)</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Easton</strong>: You found blood ... in my trash can?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Any idea how it got there?</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Easton</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Do you know an Amy Ennis from Austin, Texas?</p>
<p>(NORA EASTON drives up and parks the car. She's carrying a bouquet of flowers.)</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Easton</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, you have absolutely no idea what I'm talking about?</p>
<p>(NORA EASTON gets out of the car and walks out to the house.)</p>
<p><strong>Nora Easton</strong>: Dad ... you all right?</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Easton</strong>: I'm fine.</p>
<p><strong>Nora Easton</strong>: What's going on?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm just asking your father a few questions.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Easton</strong>: Why don't you go inside and make some dinner?</p>
<p><strong>Nora Easton</strong>: What are you in the mood for?</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Easton</strong>: Whatever you want. Charlie, homework.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Easton</strong>: Hey. Get the job?</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Easton</strong>: Later.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Divorced?</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Easton</strong>: Yeah. Five years.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. CAR DEALERSHIP -- DAY]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and WARRICK walk through the car lot to the building.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I hear David's resurrecting the dead now.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Go with you where?</p>
<p><strong>Clyde Hinton</strong>: Come on... &quot;kismet.&quot;</p>

<p>(She nods.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, the trace lab found venom proteins in his coffee cup. Could that have killed him?</p>
<p><strong>Jessie Menken</strong>: Well, I know a lot of hot shots who drink the stuff -- manly, daredevil B.S. -- And they're still alive.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Because typically, the stomach acids would kill the venom before it reached the bloodstream, but if you had an ulcer...</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: That's what I figured.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Hair from the freezer-- nicely preserved, by the way-- and hairs from the bedroom pillow, also the victim's.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay, this is all great, but, uh, why the 9-1-1 page?</p>
<p>(GREG shows the results to CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: The moral of my story -- share and share alleles. Pubic hairs in the bed, not mom's.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The daughter. Dad did have a new girlfriend.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>

[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - WAITING ROOM]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE questions NORA EASTON.)</p>
<p><strong>Nora Easton</strong>: The bracelet was a gift.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: From your father. Diamonds and platinum, that's, uh, pretty fancy.</p>
<p><strong>Nora Easton</strong>: Guess he thought I deserved it.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>Nora Easton</strong>: For taking care of everything.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Everything?</p>
<p><strong>Nora Easton</strong>: Laundry, groceries, carpool for Charlie ...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Is that it?</p>
<p>(NORA EASTON looks away for a moment.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Nora ... I'd really like to help you and your brother, but I can't unless you talk to me. </p>
<p>(NORA EASTON doesn't respond.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We found evidence of you in your father's bed.</p>
<p><strong>Nora Easton</strong>: (smiles) My father loves me.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE'S eyes shift downward and widen. NORA looks down and notices the wet stain on her blouse.)</p>
<p><strong>Nora Easton</strong>: Oh, my god.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Are you lactating?</p>
<p>(NORA doesn't say anything.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You're pregnant.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY TO INTERVIEW ROOM]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks rapidly through the hallway and walks into the interview room where DANIEL EASTON is.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You sick son of a bitch. Did you think we weren't going to find out she was pregnant?</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Easton</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, stop it. Your daughter.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Easton</strong>: (confused) Nora is pregnant?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Cut the clueless routine.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Easton</strong>: What are you accusing me of?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: AMY ENNIS/KELLY EASTON opens the bedroom door and finds DANIEL EASTON sitting on the bed with NORA EASTON.)</p>
<p><strong>Amy Ennis/Kelly Easton</strong>: Daniel!</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Your wife came back and saw what you were doing. So, you killed her, and you tried to buy off your daughter with a diamond bracelet.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Easton</strong>: I bought that for my wife.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Your daughter's telling a different story.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Easton</strong>: Nora? How could she even know about ...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (interrupting) I'm going to nail you for murder.</p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>

<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>

[INT. CSI - DNA LAB -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GREG shows WARRICK and GRISSOM the test results.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What do you mean, &quot;none&quot;?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, venom's like perfume -- highly specific recipe. Protein ratios vary from species to species, even snake to snake. The protein level of your three &quot;hoses&quot; doesn't match the sample taken from the vic's coffee cup.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So, Marty was telling the truth? It was just a coincidence that he owns poisonous snakes, and his co-worker was envenomated.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (shakes his head) A coincidence is a scientific anomaly. Maybe he just got rid of the snake.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. NANCY LINDEN'S RESIDENCE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Camera pans across the counter where NANCY LINDEN has porcelain figurines of all kinds of dogs. </p>
<p>(In the middle of the living room, the SNAKE HANDLER handles the large snake.)</p>
<p><strong>Snake Handler</strong>: Girl called all hysterical. Said a snake ate her dog. It's a monacled cobra -- it's not indigenous. Comes from southeast Asia. I asked her where she got it from. She said her co-worker asked her to snake-sit.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Marty Gibson.</p>
<p><strong>Snake Handler</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>(He walks away with the snake.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM heads for NANCI LINDEN who sits on the couch in her bathrobe crying.)</p>
<p><strong>Nancy Linden</strong>: Hey, you're that guy from the crime lab. Well, you're a little late. b*st*rd told me he had a sure-fire way to win the Cabo trip, and that he'd take me with him if I just watched his snake for a couple of days. I can't believe what an idiot I am. (crying) Never trust a car salesman.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What else did you do for Marty?</p>
<p><strong>Nancy Linden</strong>: Well, not that.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did you get him coffee?</p>
<p><strong>Nancy Linden</strong>: Oh, well, now I do.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Now you do?</p>
<p><strong>Nancy Linden</strong>: Yeah. It used to be Marty, the goodwill guy who got coffee for everybody else, but now, since Fred's dead, he's moved up a desk.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: &quot;The Goodwill Guy?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Nancy Linden</strong>: Yeah. The guy with no client list of his own, has to live off the hand-me-downs of the others.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: At the office, FRED STEARS holds up his coffee mug and calls out to MARTY GIBSON who doesn't look all that happy.)</p>
<p><strong>Fred Stearns</strong>: Hey, Marty, uh, sure could use another refill.</p>
<p><strong>Marty Gibson</strong>: You want anything?</p>
<p><strong>Fred Stearns</strong>: Easy on the sugar.</p>
<p><strong>Marty Gibson</strong>: Coming right up.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, sometimes access is all you need.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: MARTY GIBSON pours the cup of coffee. He reaches into his pocket and retrieves a small vial of venom which he pours into the mug. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT./EXT. DEALERSHIP --NIGHT]</p>
<p>(MARTY GIBSON is in handcuffs leading GIBSON and the OFFICER out of the second floor offices and down the stairs.)</p>
<p><strong>Marty Gibson</strong>: Nanci. Do you know what a syllogism is, Mr. Gibson?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sylla-what?</p>
<p><strong>Marty Gibson</strong>: A syllogism. Aristotelian logic. Two premises equal one conclusion.</p>
<p><strong>Marty Gibson &amp; Grissom (both)</strong>: &quot;A&quot; plus &quot;B&quot; equals &quot;C.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Right. So, you're the snake guy. You're also the goodwill guy who gets the coffee. So, when someone is poisoned with snake venom in their coffee, &quot;a&quot; plus &quot;b&quot; equals you.</p>
<p><strong>Marty Gibson</strong>: I busted my ass out on this floor to get a desk up there, and for what? So Fred can make me his bitch?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So you kill him?</p>
<p><strong>Marty Gibson</strong>: Fred killed himself. Guy was like a goldfish. He would have eaten himself to death before he tossed me a client. And one good client breeds seven more. Without the one, I keep slipping. </p>
<p>(MARTY shakes his head and starts rambling as he walks to the car.)</p>
<p><strong>Marty Gibson</strong>: There's two directions in this business-- up and out. It's a numbers game. I'm 35 years old. I got six guys ready to move me out. Opportunity knocks, you open the door.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I guess it's just too bad he had an ulcer.</p>
<p>(MARTY is helped into the car.)</p>
<p><strong>Marty Gibson</strong>: Who doesn't?</p>
<p>(The car door closes.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. HOSPITAL]</p>
<p>(NORA EASTON is having a pelvic examination. CATHERINE stands on the side and watches.)</p>
<p><strong>Nurse</strong>: Okay, if I can just have you lay back. <strong>Nurse</strong>: All right, Nora, I'm going to need you to relax. <strong>Nurse</strong>: Okay, now take a deep breath. <strong>Nurse</strong>: Good. <strong>Nurse</strong>: All right, another deep breath.</p>
<p>(The examination is completed. The NURSE pushes the curtain aside and whispers to CATHERINE. She walks away. CATHERINE turns and looks at NORA.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - LOUNGE]</p>
<p>(SARA and CATHERINE are in the lounge. CATHERINE sits at the table reading a large reference book.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: She's a virgin? What are we talking about, an immaculate conception?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: More like the immaculate perception. Pseudocyesis -- imagined pregnancy.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It's all in her head? Well, that would explain what she was doing in dad's bed.</p>
<p>(SARA sits down.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Fantasizing. Wow. (reading) &quot;When the desire to become pregnant is so strong hormone levels can change, setting off all the biological signs of pregnancy.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It kind of makes sense. Hormones travel the same channels as adrenaline.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: &quot;Swollen abdomen, lack of menstruation, and sometimes bilateral galactorrhea.&quot; Milk production in both breasts. Leaking can be brought on by stress.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI to: The image of NORA EASTON with a light that travels down from inside her brain following a path through the endocrine system as CATHERINE narrates.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) &quot;Emotional or physical stimuli cause prolactin to shoot through the endocrine system, ending in the mammary glands, and triggering the cells to lactate.&quot;</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The father was clueless.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: About all the women in his life.</p>
<p>(NICK walks into the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, hey. Check out these photos. The two stains on the inside of the shirt we found at the dump tested positive for Nora, but the stains on the outside, bloodstains, are definitely mom's.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The bracelet was mom's. Greg checked the epithelials.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Nora's in love with her father, in an Electra kind of way.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - INTERVIEW ROOM]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE interviews NORA EASTON. CATHERINE puts a photo of the shirt on the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Nora, is this your shirt?</p>
<p><strong>Nora Easton</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Can you explain to me how your mother's blood ended up on it?</p>
<p>(NORA shakes her head.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No idea how it got there?</p>
<p><strong>Nora Easton</strong>: (shakes her head) No.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, you told me that this bracelet was a gift from your father. He claims that he bought it for your mother.</p>
<p><strong>Nora Easton</strong>: Oh, no. It's mine.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I think you feel the same way about your father.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: NORA EASTON opens her father's bedroom door and finds DANIEL and KELLY on the bed.)</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Easton</strong>: You know you mean the world to me, don't you?</p>
<p>(NORA is surprised, shocked and jealous. She sees her mom with the bracelet. Then she sees her father kissing her mother.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: NORA EASTON sits in front of her mirror clutching her stomach. She opens the drawer and pulls out the bottle of vitamins. she takes one.)</p>
<p>(Camera cuts and shows NORA looking at a a framed photograph of herself and her father.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: NORA is in the kitchen washing the dishes. KELLY EASTON walks up behind her and covers NORA'S eyes.)</p>
<p><strong>Amy Ennis/Kelly Easton</strong>: Guess who's back?</p>
<p>(NORA grabs the frying pan and swings it, hitting KELLY on the forehead. KELLY hits the edge of the counter before falling to the floor. Dead.)</p>
<p>(NORA reaches over and takes the bracelet from KELLY. KELLY slides along the floor out of camera frame.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And then you put your mother in the freezer and you waited until trash day.</p>
<p><strong>Nora Easton</strong>: That's a horrible story.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It's not a story. It's what the evidence tells us really happened.</p>
<p><strong>Nora Easton</strong>: What kind of a mother would do that? I'm helpful. I do what needs to be done. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I know. You take care of things.</p>
<p><strong>Nora Easton</strong>: (crying) I never ask for anything!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And all you wanted was the one thing that you couldn't have.</p>
<p><strong>Nora Easton</strong>: It's not my fault. I'm innocent.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You were innocent, Nora. You're not anymore.</p>
<p>(THE OFFICER in the room moves behind NORA EASTON to handcuff her.)</p>
<p><strong>Nora Easton</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You're under arrest for the murder of Kelly Easton.</p>
<p><strong>Nora Easton</strong>: (shouts) No, but I'm going to have a baby!</p>
<p>(They take her out of the room. BRASS sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, she's going to retain an attorney. He's going to advise her to plead insanity.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Good defense.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah. Have you ever seen anything like this before?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE gathers her things.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: How it manifested? No. But the cause? (beat) People throw things away every day.</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>

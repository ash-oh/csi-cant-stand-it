<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Camera pulls out and away from the city.) </p>
<p>[EXT. COPELAND RESIDENCE (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(A dog barks. The house is dark; the lights are off. The dog continues to bark and growl viciously at something.) </p>
<p>[INT. RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Mr and Mrs. Copeland are sleeping in bed. They get up.) </p>
<p><strong>Mr. Copeland</strong>: Tucker's barking.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Copeland</strong>: Probably another coyote.</p>
<p>(Suddenly, they hear something clanging from downstairs. Mr. Copeland looks at the open bedroom door. The sounds continue.) </p>
<p>(He opens the nightstand drawer and takes out a gun.) </p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Copeland</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p>(He snaps the cartridge in the gun, loading it.) </p>
<p><strong>Mr. Copeland</strong>: Call the police.</p>
<p>(He walks over to the door and looks out. He turns back.)</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Copeland</strong>: (whispers) Do it!</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Copeland</strong>: (whispers) Okay!</p>
<p>(She picks up the phone and makes the call.) </p>
<p>(He heads downstairs. In the background, we hear the dog's low growl, then a whimper.) </p>
<p>(He reaches the bottom of the stairs and finds someone in the kitchen taking food from the refrigerator. His arms are full of food and he's stuffing whatever he can in his mouth.) </p>
<p><strong>Mr. Copeland</strong>: Freeze! I said freeze!</p>
<p>(The intruder drops the food and runs out of the house. He runs outside.)</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Copeland</strong>: I'm not afraid to use this.</p>
<p>(The man chases him out of the house. He stops running when he finds a large group of people in his yard. He's stunned for a moment. They all are.)</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Copeland</strong>: Nobody move.</p>
<p>(Suddenly, the group runs.)</p>
<p>(The man starts to chase them, then trips over a dead body.) </p>
<p><strong>Mr. Copeland</strong>: Oh, my God.</p>
<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO: </p>
<p>[EXT. COPELAND RESIDENCE - BACK YARD -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Catherine snaps photos of the dead man. David Phillips takes the liver temperature.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: No wallet, no ID. (The thermometer beeps.) 80.6 degrees. He's been dead around twelve hours.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Broken nose, broken cheekbone. Somebody worked him over pretty good. There's a piece of his shirt that's missing. That doesn't look like a tear from a struggle. It looks like it got snagged on something.</p>
<p>(She looks around and snaps photos of the shoe prints in the dirt near the fence.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: There's heavy foot traffic but no blood. It's got to be a body dump.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Could be.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: But why here?</p>
<p>(Brass walks over to Catherine. She notices the sheet over a second body nearer the house.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Dispatch didn't say anything about another body.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: It's Tucker, their dog. He was found dead with his tongue hanging out. I guess they must've slipped it something.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'll get its blood to tox.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The homeowner said that nothing was missing in the house but food.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: They get a look at the intruders?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, the husband says they were dirty, you know, like filthy, like they hadn't showered in months. Didn't know if there were five or fifty of them. Where is he?</p>
<p>(Catherine motions with her head.) </p>
<p>(Grissom is standing outside the light and looking up at the sky at the meteor shower overhead.) </p>
<p>(Brass walks up to him.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The Orionid meteor shower. You never get a view like this in town.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hmm. So, uh, is this part of the investigation?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No. But we're here, and it's beautiful.</p>
<p>(Grissom turns on his flashlight and points it on the ground in front of him.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Footprints going in both directions. They came and they went.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So dump the body, raid the refrigerator.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Maybe they had an appetite for murder.</p>
<p>(Grissom and Brass both turn and look up at the sky.) </p>
<p>SMASH CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. COMMUNITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. COPELAND RESIDENCE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Brass checks the back sliding door and sees that the screen is ripped. He uses a pen and pushes the sliding door open. He steps into the house.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, it's no secret how they got in.</p>
<p>(Sara is in the kitchen dusting the refrigerator for fingerprints. Brass sees the food on the floor.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Whoa. Looks like somebody had a super bowl party in here.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: They had some kind of party. Suspect made a mess. Seems like they were looking for junk food.</p>
<p>(Brass puts on a pair of gloves. See sees the fingerprints on the refrigerator door.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Somebody had sticky fingers.</p>
<p>[EXT. COPELAND RESIDENCE - DAY]</p>
<p>(Catherine jumps over the fence and joins Grissom on the other side. He's staring out at the desert.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It's a big desert.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: About 25,000 square miles.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And the nearest town is Pahrump. That's about 30 miles from here.</p>
<p>(Grissom shows her his canteen.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: But I got water. We can share.</p>
<p>(He heads out.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Who are you today, Moses?</p>
<p>(Catherine takes out her phone and dials.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to phone) Yeah, Jim, uh ... (chuckles) Grissom and I are going to take a little walk.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Nick walks in. They go over Robbins' findings.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, Doc.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Hi, there, Nick. I've lost count as to how many broken bones this guy has. Multiple fractures to the spine, ribs, pelvis, skull. Multiple lacerations and contusions. No vital response to the injuries.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Perimortem.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: He was dumped in a backyard by a whole bunch of other people. Do you think they could've beat him to death?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Nick, it took a lot of people to do this.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. COPELAND RESIDENCE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Warrick snaps photos of the shoe prints on the dirt. He makes a plaster cast of the prints.) </p>
<p>(When the casts dry, he removes them and lines them up.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Dirty dozen.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. DESERT -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Grissom and Catherine are out walking in the desert following the tracks as it leads them farther and farther away from the house.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I count five distinct treads: boots, shoes, sneakers. Drag marks are always right in the middle -- thin, parallel lines.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The vic's shoes were scuffed at the toes, so he must've been dragged. </p>
<p>(Quick flash of: The victim's feet drag on the ground as people half carry, half drag him. End of flash.) </p>
<p>(Catherine finds a candy wrapper caught on a branch.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, whoever they are, they like junk food.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Who doesn't?</p>
<p>(They continue walking.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You ever seen the Pyramids?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Does the Luxor count? Eh, what do you think? I haven't even been to New York.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'd like to see the Pyramids one day.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Keep walking, we could come upon them today.</p>
<p>(Grissom smiles.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So you like archeology, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Oh, yeah. Whenever I want to feel small.</p>
<p>(In the distance, they see a column of black smoke rising in the air.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Smoke?</p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO: </p>
<p>(Catherine and Grissom walk up to the burnt car. Catherine snaps some photos.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I found the point of ignition.</p>
<p>(She snaps a couple of photos.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Molotov.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: Someone lights the fuse and leaves. The car explodes. End of flash.) </p>
<p>(Grissom is looking at the back of the car, when he stops and stands up.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You hear that?</p>
<p>(He turns and looks around.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Sounds like a motor.</p>
<p>(Nearby is a compound.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Think someone's in there?</p>
<p>(They head for the compound.) </p>
<p>(As they approach the compound, Grissom sees the generator running on the side of the wall.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This looks like some sort of observation post. Maybe used to monitor nuclear tests.</p>
<p>(They head for the entrance.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Half of Nevada was a weapon site.</p>
<p>(Grissom starts walking down the entryway stairs.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Stop. You're not going any further without backup.</p>
<p>(Catherine's phone rings. She answers it.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (from phone) Catherine, where the hell are you guys?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (looking around) That's a good question, Jim. I think we're about three miles northeast of the Copeland house, in front of some kind of military installation.</p>
<p>(Static crackles over the phone.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (from phone) Hello, Catherine.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Jim, can you hear me? </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (from phone) I'm losing ... </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: you're breaking up. Jim?</p>
<p>(She hangs up.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Lost him.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, we got two choices: Go back ... or go forward.</p>
<p>(Catherine takes her gun out. Grissom turns and heads inside the compound.) </p>
<p>[INT. COMPOUND - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Grissom opens the door and looks inside.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I don't hear anything but the generator.</p>
<p>(Grissom and Catherine both turn their flashlights on. She nods to Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: After you.</p>
<p>(Grissom steps inside. High above them is a large ceiling fan. Down below are several floors.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (shouts) Las Vegas Crime Lab! </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (shouts) Anyone here?</p>
<p>(They walk deeper into the compound. The hallway wall is covered with graffiti.) </p>
<p>(At the end of the hallway, they reach a large room lined on either side with wire cots. There's a dead person on each cot.)</p>
<p>(Grissom and Catherine walk into the room.) </p>
<p>(Grissom knocks over an empty water bottle.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I count eleven.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Me, too. They're so young.</p>
<p>(The bed on the end is empty.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And number twelve is missing. Maybe that was the guy we found in the yard.</p>
<p>(Behind them, a loud clanging sounds. Catherine whirls around, her gun raised.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (shouts) Who's there?!</p>
<p>(There's no answer. Grissom and Catherine head back toward the doorway) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (shouts) Las Vegas Crime Lab! Identify yourself!</p>
<p>(Suddenly, two officers appear in the doorway.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Don't shoot, don't shoot. LVPD. Captain Brass radioed us. Said you might be in here and need assistance. </p>
<p>(Grissom turns around and looks at the dead bodies in the room.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, unfortunately, we're not the ones who need the help.</p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. BUNKER -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Greg looks into the burned car's broken window. He can barely make out a VIN number. He walks to the other side of the car and looks at the burned glove compartment. He snaps a photo of it. He takes out what looks like a burned piece of an ID card.) </p>
<p>(An SUV drive up. Nick gets out of the car.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p>(Nick waves to Greg, who waves back. Nick heads over to Robbins, who stands near the compound entrance.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Hey, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: How many we looking at Doc?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Eleven total. And it's hot. You got to move.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(Nick heads for the compound, then stops when he realizes that it goes underground. He overhears two officers talking to each other.) </p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: Yeah, eighty feet underground, no A/C. Thought I was going to suffocate.</p>
<p><strong>Man 2</strong>: I can't even get down there. Claustrophobic.</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: Yeah. Uh, listen, preliminary sketch here ... </p>
<p>(Nick glances back at them. He looks at the compound and forces himself to continue.) </p>
<p>(He pauses at the door and takes several deep breaths. He heads inside.) </p>
<p>[INT. COMPOUND - DAY -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(Nick walks down the stairs. He passes an officer on his way out. The officer points down below.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Just keep on going.</p>
<p>(Nick reaches the corridor. He passes the coroners wheeling out a gurney with a body bag. Nick continues down the corridor.) </p>
<p>[INT. SLEEPING CHAMBERS - COMPOUND - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Various photo flashes of: The empty water bottle, the victim's ankle, the victim's face.)</p>
<p>(Catherine continues snapping photos. Nick arrives and walks up to Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Oh, man. What is this place, a mini Jonestown?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I don't know if they drank spiked Kool-Aid, but they drank something. Smells like alcohol.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I'll process the bottles.</p>
<p>(Nick heads for the end of the row of beds.) </p>
<p>(On the empty bed is an empty water bottle and funnel. Catherine takes a picture of it.) </p>
<p>(Nick picks up the funnel and looks at it.)</p>
<p>(Camera zooms in and notes the residual on the outside of the funnel.)</p>
<p>(Grissom looks around the compound and comes across a large room. On one of the walls, he finds various article clippings posted - of aliens, Stonehenge, the Pyramids, astrology and other things. On the opposite wall near a single bed, he finds a mural of people ascending into a spaceship through a white beam of light.)</p>
<p>(Next to the bed is a nightstand filled with bottles and things. Just behind the bed is a large metal sphere with a ring around it. Grissom walks up to the planet and turns it on. The light from inside the metal planet shines through the holes in the surface, casting different sized spots of light on the ceiling and walls as it turns.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY - DAY]</p>
<p>(Robbins has two bodies out on the table. Camera moves through the first autopsy room and into the hallway where we see that the other bodies are pushed up against both walls.) </p>
<p>(Camera continues through the hallway into a second room where Warrick and Sara are documenting the physical evidence gathered from the bodies. Warrick takes a photo and matches it against one of the victim's shoes while Sara is taking photos.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(On the table in front of them, Warrick has the shoe prints and the casts from the Copeland house matched.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, I've matched the shoes from all the bodies in the bunker to the impressions that we found at the scene.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You got one extra.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It's a size eight athletic shoe. I can't account for it. It doesn't belong to the guy who was dumped there, and I've already ruled out Mr. and Mrs. Copeland.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So one of the people that dragged that body through the desert did not die in the bunker.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. BUNKER - CIRCULAR ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Grissom snaps photos of the mural on the wall while Catherine is processing the bed. After snapping several photos, Grissom pauses.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The mythology here appears to be similar to the Heaven's Gate Cult in California several years ago. They committed mass suicide to shed their earthly bodies and hitch a ride on a spaceship hidden in the tail of the Hale-Bopp comet.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, these earthly bodies got a good workout first. Big room, big bed, light show. This cult was about getting laid.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, Jim Jones and Charles Manson used s*x to manipulate their followers. I'm guessing they were timing their ascension to the Orionid meteor shower last night?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So while you were watching shooting stars, they were dying.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: There's twelve bunks in there, one bed in here. There should be thirteen bodies. One prophet, twelve apostles.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And two people are missing.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Maybe they caught the spaceship.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well ... would you settle for a flying saucer?</p>
<p>(Catherine finds a metal bowl with burned pieces of paper inside. Grissom snaps photos of the bowl and contents.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. BUNKER - CORRIDOR -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Nick is headed out carrying several evidence bags when something on the floor catches his eyes. He shines his flashlight on what appears to be smudges of blood on the metal floor.) </p>
<p>(He looks at the blood on the floor and takes a couple of steps back, but the blood smudges stop. He then looks up at the walkways above.)</p>
<p>(He sees some cloth caught on one of the metal walkways.)</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: A body falls from above and hits the metal walkway, causing a tear in the clothes. End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - GARAGE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Greg smashes through the windshielf and removes the VIN plate off the front dashboard. He works on it and gets the VIN: YZ1AX8848E194189.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Greg reports his findings to Sara.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: VIN plate on the burned-out car came back to a Vivian Bentley. She died two years ago at the ripe old age of 90. Car was never re-registered.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Dead end.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And what about the blood in the elevator shaft?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: It matched to Ty Bentley, but we can't confirm he was murdered. For all we know, he fell down that shaft.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No, that's unlikely, after all they torched his car, dragged his body three miles and dumped it in the Copelands' backyard. Anything on the liquid in the bottles?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, tox results just came back: 40 grams percent ethanol. Now, that's about 80 proof. Kind of smelled like vodka, the cheap stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Nobody dies from a martini.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No, but you add ten grams percent of ketamine and they do.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, that's enough to kill a horse.</p>
<p>(Nick walks into the break room and gets himself a cup of coffee.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, or the Copelands' dog for that matter. Ketamine's a disassociative anesthetic, which means they were hallucinating, having out-of-body experiences ... </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So I was wrong; they did take a trip.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, there are a lot of different ways they could have killed themselves, so I'm guessing that was the point. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Ten grams percent of ketamine times 12 bottles, that's 300 milliliters of ketamine? Can't score that on the street.</p>
<p>(Nick picks up his cup of coffee and walks across the break room.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, we didn't find any ephedrine, which is generally used to cut ketamine. Veterinarians use liquid injectable ketamine as an animal sedative, so Sofia's checking with the local vets now.</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Between 3:00 and 3:30.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to Grissom) How did you know that?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's when the Orionid meteor shower passed over Vegas. Ask him if they all died about the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Nick, was TOD same for everyone?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Approximately. It varied with body weight. Took between 12 and 20 minutes for them to die.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: Someone drinks from the bottle of water. He falls back on the bed and groans in pain with everyone else. End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>

<p>(Abigail opens her eyes and finds Grissom sitting next to her hospital bed.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Abigail?</p>
<p><strong>Abigail Spencer</strong>: You pumped my stomach?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah. Just in time.</p>
<p>(She turns her back to Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Are you disappointed?</p>
<p><strong>Abigail Spencer</strong>: They're all up there right now. In rapture. A higher plane of existence. No wars, poverty, politics. Our bodies are just shells. They're worthless.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, how come you didn't die with your friends? And why exactly did you kill Mr. Diamond? </p>
<p><strong>Abigail Spencer</strong>: He was the most beautiful person I ever met.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Joseph Diamond speaks to a group of kids as they sit on the ground listening to him.) </p>
<p>(Cut to: Joseph Diamond grunts and rolls off Abigail Spencer in bed. She stares up at the moving lights across the dark ceiling.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We found your fingerprint on a tire iron that was used to split his head open.</p>
<p><strong>Abigail Spencer</strong>: He always said we'd be tested.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Joseph Diamond opens the car trunk as Abigail walks up to him.) </p>
<p><strong>Abigail Spencer</strong>: (V.O.) I was taking a walk when I spotted a car parking about a mile away from the compound.</p>
<p>(She surprises him.) </p>
<p><strong>Abigail Spencer</strong>: Whose car is this? Where have you been?</p>
<p><strong>Joseph Diamond</strong>: I received a message last night from the Orionid. I have to move on, spread the word.</p>
<p><strong>Abigail Spencer</strong>: What about us?</p>
<p><strong>Joseph Diamond</strong>: Come with me, Abbey. We'll do it together ... somewhere near a beach.</p>
<p><strong>Abigail Spencer</strong>: We're ascending tomorrow night to the mother ship.</p>
<p><strong>Joseph Diamond</strong>: You're a smart girl.</p>
<p>(He takes out a small plastic bag with the pills inside and gives it to Abbey.) </p>
<p><strong>Joseph Diamond</strong>: Just two or three of these, and everyone will get a real good night's sleep. Time to get out of town. Everyone's parents have been really good to me.</p>
<p>(He turns his back to her and continues to put his things in the trunk of the car.) </p>
<p><strong>Joseph Diamond</strong>: I got forty grand. </p>
<p>(Abigail picks up the tire iron and hits him over the head with it.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Abigail Spencer</strong>: I knew the others would be looking to me now.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: But you didn't tell them, did you?</p>
<p><strong>Abigail Spencer</strong>: We were on a schedule.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And fortunately, you knew where to find something a little stronger than zolpidem?</p>
<p><strong>Abigail Spencer</strong>: It was important that no one suffered.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Ty Bentley suffered.</p>
<p><strong>Abigail Spencer</strong>: That was unfortunate.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Abigail sees Ty Bentley arrive with his own car. She sees him running toward them.) </p>
<p><strong>Abigail Spencer</strong>: (V.O.) Ty must've followed Diamond back to our compound. I'm sure he was looking for his ex-girlfriend, Emma.</p>
<p>(Cut to: In the bunker, Ty pulls Emma toward the door.) </p>
<p><strong>Ty Bentley</strong>: These people are freaks, Emma! You're coming with me!</p>
<p><strong>Emma Meyers</strong>: This is my family now.</p>
<p><strong>Ty Bentley</strong>: Fine. I'm coming back, and I'm bringing the cops with me.</p>
<p>(Ty Bentley leaves. On the way out, Abigail walks in. She grabs him and pushes him over the railing. He falls down the shaft, hitting one of the metal railings on the way down.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Abigail Spencer</strong>: Emma lost it, said we couldn't leave his body there. The others started to get restless.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And as you said, you were on a schedule. The peak of the meteor shower was 3:00 A.M.</p>
<p><strong>Abigail Spencer</strong>: (nods) We agreed to dump the body where it would be found ... given a decent burial.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And then you went back to the compound ... and you used the funnel to distribute the ketamine and vodka.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The funnel is placed on a water bottle. The ketamine bottles are opened and poured into the funnel. End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Abigail Spencer</strong>: I had to be the last to drink.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did you watch them all die? What was it like?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The kids drink the bottle and start coughing and throwing up. They groan and cry out in pain. On the last bunker, Abigail stares at her water bottle. She doesn't drink. One by one, they gasp for breath and die on their beds. She recaps the bottle.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Abigail Spencer</strong>: They just died.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And you went home to your mother.</p>
<p><strong>Abigail Spencer</strong>: I know they're all up there ... happy ... healthy ... perfect. You don't believe we're one in the universe?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Abigail ... I'm sure if there is something out there looking down on us from somewhere else in the universe, they're wise enough to stay away from us.</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>
<p><strong>End</strong></p>

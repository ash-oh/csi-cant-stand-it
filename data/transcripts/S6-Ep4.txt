Mrs. Copeland: Probably another coyote.
 
 
Mrs. Copeland: What are you doing?
 
Mr. Copeland: Call the police.

Mr. Copeland:  Do it!
Mrs. Copeland:  Okay!
 
 
 
Mr. Copeland: Freeze! I said freeze!

Mr. Copeland: I'm not afraid to use this.

Mr. Copeland: Nobody move.

 
Mr. Copeland: Oh, my God.

 
 
David Phillips: No wallet, no ID.  80.6 degrees. He's been dead around twelve hours.
Catherine: Broken nose, broken cheekbone. Somebody worked him over pretty good. There's a piece of his shirt that's missing. That doesn't look like a tear from a struggle. It looks like it got snagged on something.
 
Catherine: There's heavy foot traffic but no blood. It's got to be a body dump.
David Phillips: Could be.
Catherine: But why here?
 
Catherine: Dispatch didn't say anything about another body.
Brass: It's Tucker, their dog. He was found dead with his tongue hanging out. I guess they must've slipped it something.
Catherine: I'll get its blood to tox.
Brass: The homeowner said that nothing was missing in the house but food.
Catherine: They get a look at the intruders?
Brass: Yeah, the husband says they were dirty, you know, like filthy, like they hadn't showered in months. Didn't know if there were five or fifty of them. Where is he?
 
 
 
Grissom: The Orionid meteor shower. You never get a view like this in town.
Brass: Hmm. So, uh, is this part of the investigation?
Grissom: No. But we're here, and it's beautiful.
 
Grissom: Footprints going in both directions. They came and they went.
Brass: So dump the body, raid the refrigerator.
Grissom: Maybe they had an appetite for murder.
 
SMASH CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS




 
 
Brass: Well, it's no secret how they got in.
 
Brass: Whoa. Looks like somebody had a super bowl party in here.
Sara: They had some kind of party. Suspect made a mess. Seems like they were looking for junk food.
 
Sara: Somebody had sticky fingers.

 
Catherine: It's a big desert.
Grissom: About 25,000 square miles.
Catherine: And the nearest town is Pahrump. That's about 30 miles from here.
 
Grissom: But I got water. We can share.
 
Catherine: Who are you today, Moses?
 
Catherine:  Grissom and I are going to take a little walk.

 
 
Nick: Hey, Doc.
Robbins: Hi, there, Nick. I've lost count as to how many broken bones this guy has. Multiple fractures to the spine, ribs, pelvis, skull. Multiple lacerations and contusions. No vital response to the injuries.
Nick: Perimortem.
Robbins: Yep.
Nick: He was dumped in a backyard by a whole bunch of other people. Do you think they could've beat him to death?
Robbins: Nick, it took a lot of people to do this.

 
 
 
Warrick: Dirty dozen.

 
 
Grissom: I count five distinct treads: boots, shoes, sneakers. Drag marks are always right in the middle -- thin, parallel lines.
Catherine: The vic's shoes were scuffed at the toes, so he must've been dragged. 
 
 
Catherine: Well, whoever they are, they like junk food.
Grissom: Who doesn't?
 
Grissom: You ever seen the Pyramids?
Catherine: Does the Luxor count? Eh, what do you think? I haven't even been to New York.
Grissom: I'd like to see the Pyramids one day.
Catherine: Keep walking, we could come upon them today.
 
Catherine: So you like archeology, huh?
Grissom: Oh, yeah. Whenever I want to feel small.

Grissom: Smoke?
DISSOLVE TO: 
 
Catherine: I found the point of ignition.
 
Catherine: Molotov.
 
 
Grissom: You hear that?
 
Catherine: Sounds like a motor.
 
Catherine: Think someone's in there?
 
 
Grissom: This looks like some sort of observation post. Maybe used to monitor nuclear tests.
 
Catherine: Half of Nevada was a weapon site.
 
Catherine: Stop. You're not going any further without backup.
 
Brass:  Catherine, where the hell are you guys?
Catherine:  That's a good question, Jim. I think we're about three miles northeast of the Copeland house, in front of some kind of military installation.
 
Brass:  Hello, Catherine.
Catherine: Jim, can you hear me? 
Brass:  I'm losing ... 
Catherine: you're breaking up. Jim?
 
Catherine: Lost him.
Grissom: Well, we got two choices: Go back ... or go forward.
 

 
Catherine: I don't hear anything but the generator.
 
Catherine: After you.
 
Grissom:  Las Vegas Crime Lab! 
Catherine:  Anyone here?
 

 
 
Grissom: I count eleven.
Catherine: Me, too. They're so young.
 
Grissom: And number twelve is missing. Maybe that was the guy we found in the yard.
 
Catherine:  Who's there?!
 
Catherine:  Las Vegas Crime Lab! Identify yourself!
 
Officer: Don't shoot, don't shoot. LVPD. Captain Brass radioed us. Said you might be in here and need assistance. 
 
Grissom: Well, unfortunately, we're not the ones who need the help.




 
 
 
Nick: Hey!
 
Robbins: Hey, Nick.
Nick: How many we looking at Doc?
Robbins: Eleven total. And it's hot. You got to move.
Nick: Okay.
 
Man: Yeah, eighty feet underground, no A/C. Thought I was going to suffocate.
Man 2: I can't even get down there. Claustrophobic.
Man: Yeah. Uh, listen, preliminary sketch here ... 
 
 
 
 
Officer: Just keep on going.
 


 
Nick: Oh, man. What is this place, a mini Jonestown?
Catherine: I don't know if they drank spiked Kool-Aid, but they drank something. Smells like alcohol.
Nick: I'll process the bottles.
 
 



 


 
 

 
 
Warrick: Well, I've matched the shoes from all the bodies in the bunker to the impressions that we found at the scene.
Sara: You got one extra.
Warrick: It's a size eight athletic shoe. I can't account for it. It doesn't belong to the guy who was dumped there, and I've already ruled out Mr. and Mrs. Copeland.
Sara: So one of the people that dragged that body through the desert did not die in the bunker.

 
 
Grissom: The mythology here appears to be similar to the Heaven's Gate Cult in California several years ago. They committed mass suicide to shed their earthly bodies and hitch a ride on a spaceship hidden in the tail of the Hale-Bopp comet.
Catherine: Well, these earthly bodies got a good workout first. Big room, big bed, light show. This cult was about getting laid.
Grissom: Well, Jim Jones and Charles Manson used s*x to manipulate their followers. I'm guessing they were timing their ascension to the Orionid meteor shower last night?
Catherine: So while you were watching shooting stars, they were dying.
Grissom: There's twelve bunks in there, one bed in here. There should be thirteen bodies. One prophet, twelve apostles.
Catherine: And two people are missing.
Grissom: Maybe they caught the spaceship.
Catherine: Well ... would you settle for a flying saucer?
 

 
 


 

 
 

 
 
Greg: VIN plate on the burned-out car came back to a Vivian Bentley. She died two years ago at the ripe old age of 90. Car was never re-registered.
Sara: Dead end.
Greg: Not exactly. I also found a melted name tag with a sunburst logo. Figured I'd let my fingers do the walking.
Sara: You scanned the yellow pages.
Greg: I knew the first three letters. By the way, do you know how many companies in Las Vegas start with S-U-N?
Sara: I so don't care.
Greg: Well, only one has the sunburst logo: Sunview Travel Agency. Vivian's grandson, Ty Bentley, works there. I pulled his DMV photo.

Sara: That's the guy that was dumped at the house.
Greg: Brass is going to check it out. How are we doing on the other IDs?
Sara: Including the one that you just made, we got one.
 

 
 
Travel Manager: Ty hasn't been here for the last two days. Didn't even call in. This is his desk. It's really not like him. Is he okay?
Brass: Does Ty work here full time?
Travel Manager: Yeah. Puts in more hours than anybody.
Brass: Was he a member of any religious organizations that you know of?
Travel Manager: I don't know. It never really came up. Something happened to him, didn't it?
Brass: Yeah. So the last time you saw him was two days ago?
 
Travel Manager: He's worked here over a year, never raised his voice. Then this strange-looking customer came in. Ty must've known him ...
 
Ty Bentley: I want to talk to Emma, you freak!
Joseph Diamond: She's moving on, boy.
 
Brass: Would that customer's information still be in the computer?
Travel Manager: Nobody's touched it since. Should be the last entry.
 
Brass: Do you know the person in this photo?
Travel Manager: That's Emma, Ty's girlfriend. Well, ex-girlfriend. They broke up last year. Here we go. Last customer was a Joseph Diamond. Booking a trip to Australia-Sydney-one way.
Brass: One way.

 
 
Sara: Any good news, Mandy?
Mandy: A little bit. A male DB, at the bunker--matched your partial from the kitchen door. So far, he's the only one with a record.

Mandy: Matthew Dickens, 19. Busts for petty theft.
Sara: College student.
Mandy: Yeah, very impressionable. When I start my religion that's where I'm going to recruit.


Man :  I remember him. Matt Dickens. We used to call him Hollywood.
 
 
Ryan: He was in our, uh, our freshman dorm. He was a ... 
Dexter: ... religious studies major.
Ryan: Right. Hard core trekkie, too.
Dexter: Mars bars.
Ryan: Right. That dude loved junk food. He smoked a ton of weed.
Dexter: Guy was a loser.
 
Sofia Curtis: What do you mean? 
Dexter: His parents sent him loads of cash. He spent it all on dope, and then he stole stuff to get more dope.
Sofia Curtis: According to the registrar, he was taking classes till the end of term last fall. Why did he leave?
Dexter: He started hanging out with some other losers, and they convinced him to drop out.
Ryan: Yeah, there was a redhead. She was hot, but in a ... in a weird kind of way.
Dexter: Hollywood was a moron. One week, the guy's saving the whales, and the next week, he's American Taliban.
Ryan: Yeah. He was totally into that girl.
Sofia Curtis: She have a name?
Dexter: Emma.
 
Sofia Curtis: Was this her?
 
Ryan: Is she dead?
Sofia Curtis: They're all dead.
Ryan: Emma was working Hollywood with some old guy named Diamond.
Sofia Curtis: Working him?
Dexter: Yeah, they were running some kind of religious scam. E-Emma tried to recruit me ... with her hands down my pants.
Ryan: She did that to me, too.
Dexter: No kidding?
Ryan: Yeah.
Dexter:  Anyway, uh, the second she started talking about outer space and transcendence, I blew her off, 'cause I do not waste time on crazy chicks.
Ryan: She was really hot, though.
Dexter: That was almost a year ago. Then the last time I saw Hollywood, he was with some other freak. A notch down, though. Abbey ... I think her name was. They said they were going to some better place.
Ryan: I thought they meant UCLA.

Catherine:  Nick, I got a real low signal; you're cutting in and out. Say that again.

 
 
Nick:  I said all the prints on the bottles belong to the victims. The prints on the funnel came back unknown though.
Catherine: And what about the blood in the elevator shaft?
Nick: It matched to Ty Bentley, but we can't confirm he was murdered. For all we know, he fell down that shaft.
Catherine: No, that's unlikely, after all they torched his car, dragged his body three miles and dumped it in the Copelands' backyard. Anything on the liquid in the bottles?
Nick: Yeah, tox results just came back: 40 grams percent ethanol. Now, that's about 80 proof. Kind of smelled like vodka, the cheap stuff.
Catherine: Nobody dies from a martini.
Nick: No, but you add ten grams percent of ketamine and they do.
Catherine: Well, that's enough to kill a horse.
 
Nick: Yeah, or the Copelands' dog for that matter. Ketamine's a disassociative anesthetic, which means they were hallucinating, having out-of-body experiences ... 
Catherine: So I was wrong; they did take a trip.
Nick: Well, there are a lot of different ways they could have killed themselves, so I'm guessing that was the point. 
Catherine: Ten grams percent of ketamine times 12 bottles, that's 300 milliliters of ketamine? Can't score that on the street.
 
Nick: Well, we didn't find any ephedrine, which is generally used to cut ketamine. Veterinarians use liquid injectable ketamine as an animal sedative, so Sofia's checking with the local vets now.
 
Catherine: What did autopsy say time of death was?
Grissom: 3:15 A.M.?
Nick: Between 3:00 and 3:30.
Catherine:  How did you know that?
Grissom: That's when the Orionid meteor shower passed over Vegas. Ask him if they all died about the same time.
Catherine: Nick, was TOD same for everyone?
Nick: Approximately. It varied with body weight. Took between 12 and 20 minutes for them to die.
 
Nick: Ketamine's really hard on the stomach; it induces vomiting.
 
Nick: I think a combination of alcohol and the drug just slowed their lungs.

 
Nick:  Ultimately, they died of respiratory arrest.
 
Catherine: Okay, thanks, Nicki. Got to go.
 
Catherine:  Did you notice those buzzards earlier?
Grissom: No. But something sure smells good to them.


 
 
Tina Brown: Say &quot;ah.&quot;
Warrick: Ah.
Tina Brown: Ahh ...
Warrick: Ahh ...
Tina Brown: Sore throat, you say? Okay, I don't see any inflammation. Take off your shirt, please.
 
Warrick: Can't we just make out?
Tina Brown: I'm working, Mr. Brown.
Warrick: I don't care, Mrs. Brown.
 
Tina Brown: There's nothing wrong with you. You're just working too hard.
Warrick: What time you get off shift?
Tina Brown: Midnight. You?
Warrick: Who knows?
Tina Brown: I got to get back to work.

Woman:  Dr. Curry, please check with the message center. Dr. Curry, please check with the message center.
 
Tina Brown: Don't even say it, Warrick.
Warrick: I didn't say anything. You got to admit, though, working around the ex is a little strange. 
Tina Brown: It was a long time ago.
Warrick: It was a year ago.
Tina Brown: You have to trust me.
Warrick: I do trust you.
Tina Brown: Look, there's still so much that we don't know about each other yet. Okay?
 
Tina Brown: But we've got the rest of our lives to figure it out.
 

 
 
Grissom: Are you having the same mirage I'm having?
Catherine: A silver Beemer in the middle of the damn desert? Yeah. Nice wheels. Somebody sure went out of their way to hide this car.
Grissom: Well, you can sure smell what the buzzards are after.
Catherine: Decomp.
 
Catherine: Fits the description of the leader, Joseph Diamond. Guess he never made it to Australia.
Grissom: Something tells me this wasn't a suicide. Like this tire iron-- convenient weapon of choice.
Catherine: Well, assuming this is Diamond and Ty Bentley was a spurned lover and not a member of the cult ... we're still short one body.
Grissom: Which I believe makes that body our number one suspect.


 
 

 
 
 
 
Voice :  &quot;Thank you for writing. Your father and I miss you so much.&quot;
Voice :  &quot;Money's kind of tight, I hope this helps. Send more when I can.&quot;
Voice :  &quot;Mom and Dad went to the police to report you missing. Please come home, even if it's just a visit.&quot;
Voice :  &quot;I don't understand what you're doing with your life.
Your roommate says you left your things behind.&quot;
Voice :  &quot;I wish you could tell me why you need this money.&quot;
Voice :  &quot;Mom says you joined a commune. She's mad. Hey, Dad sent the money. When you talk to Mom ...&quot;
Voice :  &quot;No more money until I hear from you. I love you.&quot;

 
 
Brass: The FBI keeps tabs on high-risk groups, cults, religious fanatics. They were good enough to fax this over. Makes good reading.
 
Sara: &quot;Joseph Diamond, AKA Sirus Bent, AKA Kelvin Adams ...&quot;
 
Brass: Yeah, he founded a group called &quot;Soul Survivors&quot; in Tulsa in the mid-
90s. A few years later, same thing in Guadalajara, Mexico.
Sara: &quot;Recruited susceptible youths, keeping them isolated for nine months to a year.&quot;
Brass: Yeah, prior to the arrival of the mother ship, which they can only enter in spirit form, leaving their temporal vehicles, their bodies, behind.
Sara: Mass suicide.
Brass: Attempted mass suicide. They woke up -- probably with a hangover -- and both Diamond and their money were gone. And in both cases, his disappearance coincided with a meteor shower just like the one last night.
Sara: Only last night everybody died.

 
 
Robbins: Depressed fracture.
Grissom: Well, we found a tire iron at the scene.
Robbins: That would do it.
Grissom: What about TOD?
Robbins: Well, it's hard to say. Desert heat, locked in a trunk ... both can make liver temp actually rise.
Grissom: What about relative to the other bodies? Did he die before or after the others?
Robbins: Given the degree of decomp, it appears that he died before the others. I can run some chemical tests, but that's going to take some time.
 
David Phillips: What's this?
 
David Phillips: Hmm, looks like a money belt.
 
Robbins: Gives new meaning to &quot;strapped for cash.&quot;
Warrick: Diamond was running a cash business. He had all those kids write home and ask for money. His return address was a P.O. Box that I found.
 
Robbins: I didn't find any undigested pills in the victims' stomachs.
Warrick: We assumed that they were ingesting a liquid ketamine.
Grissom: So what are these?


 
Henry Andrews: Zolpidem. Popped one when I went to Europe. Six hours sleep, no hangover.
Grissom: Are there enough pills in that bag to kill 11 people?
Henry Andrews: Well, if only one person downed all these, yes, it'd be lethal. But divvied up, no way. Zolpidem's a pretty safe sedative.
Grissom: And from what we know, Diamond was a con man, not a murderer.
 
Greg: Hey, I lifted a partial off that tire iron. Matched it to a print that Nick lifted off the funnel from the bunker. Whoever whacked Diamond mixed the ketamine cocktail.
Grissom: So who brought the ketamine to the party?





 
 
Sofia Curtis: They had a break-in the day before yesterday.
Nick: Has it been forensicated?
Sofia Curtis: Not yet. Not much stolen, so ...
Nick: It's a low priority for CSI.
Sofia Curtis: Expensive equipment, pharmaceuticals -- doctor even had his laptop open on the desk. They obviously knew what they wanted.
Nick: Hmm, and where to look for it. Drugs have been alphabetized.
Missing drug was between ivermectin otic suspension and methocarbamol.
Nick: &quot;K&quot; for ketamine.
Sofia Curtis: Yeah. They took it all.
Nick: Okay, well, it's probably an inside job. Just get me a list of current and former employees, and we'll ... go from there. Thanks.

Mrs. Meyers: Excuse me, sir. Mrs. Spencer isn't here. Her daughter went to college with Emma. They disappeared at the same time. Uh, we both received letters from them last month.
Warrick: Spencer, you said?
Mrs. Meyers: Her daughter's name was Abigail.
Warrick: Well, ma'am, you see, the letters that we recovered were damaged. Not all of them yielded a name.
Mrs. Meyers: Well, perhaps she was luckier than me.
 
Warrick: Ma'am ... would you be able to identify Abigail?
Mrs. Meyers:  Absolutely. 


 
Warrick: Nick, you have that employee list from the vet's office?

Warrick: Abigail Spencer. She was a cult member. She used to work for your vet until last year, and she's missing.
Nick: Her W-2's in the file.
Warrick: I'll call Brass.
 

 
 
Brass: Mrs. Spencer?
Mrs. Spencer: Yeah?
Brass: I'm Detective Jim Brass, Las Vegas police. Do you have a daughter named Abigail?
Mrs. Spencer: Yes. Why?
Brass: We have a warrant to search these premises.
Mrs. Spencer: A warrant? What for?
Brass: Your daughter is wanted for questioning in the murder of Joseph Diamond.
 
Mrs. Spencer: I haven't seen Abigail in almost a year. I have no idea where she is.
 
Brass: The bed's still warm. Where is she?


 

 
 
Abigail Spencer:  Please. Take me with you.
 

 

 
Voice :  Freeze! Remain where you are.




 
Grissom: Abigail?
Abigail Spencer: You pumped my stomach?
Grissom: Yeah. Just in time.
 
Grissom: Are you disappointed?
Abigail Spencer: They're all up there right now. In rapture. A higher plane of existence. No wars, poverty, politics. Our bodies are just shells. They're worthless.
Grissom: Well, how come you didn't die with your friends? And why exactly did you kill Mr. Diamond? 
Abigail Spencer: He was the most beautiful person I ever met.
 
 
 
Grissom: We found your fingerprint on a tire iron that was used to split his head open.
Abigail Spencer: He always said we'd be tested.
 
Abigail Spencer:  I was taking a walk when I spotted a car parking about a mile away from the compound.
 
Abigail Spencer: Whose car is this? Where have you been?
Joseph Diamond: I received a message last night from the Orionid. I have to move on, spread the word.
Abigail Spencer: What about us?
Joseph Diamond: Come with me, Abbey. We'll do it together ... somewhere near a beach.
Abigail Spencer: We're ascending tomorrow night to the mother ship.
Joseph Diamond: You're a smart girl.
 
Joseph Diamond: Just two or three of these, and everyone will get a real good night's sleep. Time to get out of town. Everyone's parents have been really good to me.
 
Joseph Diamond: I got forty grand. 
 
 
Abigail Spencer: I knew the others would be looking to me now.
Grissom: But you didn't tell them, did you?
Abigail Spencer: We were on a schedule.
Grissom: And fortunately, you knew where to find something a little stronger than zolpidem?
Abigail Spencer: It was important that no one suffered.
Grissom: Ty Bentley suffered.
Abigail Spencer: That was unfortunate.
 
Abigail Spencer:  Ty must've followed Diamond back to our compound. I'm sure he was looking for his ex-girlfriend, Emma.
 
Ty Bentley: These people are freaks, Emma! You're coming with me!
Emma Meyers: This is my family now.
Ty Bentley: Fine. I'm coming back, and I'm bringing the cops with me.

 
Abigail Spencer: Emma lost it, said we couldn't leave his body there. The others started to get restless.
Grissom: And as you said, you were on a schedule. The peak of the meteor shower was 3:00 A.M.
Abigail Spencer:  We agreed to dump the body where it would be found ... given a decent burial.
Grissom: And then you went back to the compound ... and you used the funnel to distribute the ketamine and vodka.
 
Abigail Spencer: I had to be the last to drink.
Grissom: Did you watch them all die? What was it like?
 
 
Abigail Spencer: They just died.
Grissom: And you went home to your mother.
Abigail Spencer: I know they're all up there ... happy ... healthy ... perfect. You don't believe we're one in the universe?
Grissom: Abigail ... I'm sure if there is something out there looking down on us from somewhere else in the universe, they're wise enough to stay away from us.

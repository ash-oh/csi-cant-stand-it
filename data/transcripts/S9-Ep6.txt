							<p>Did you see anything?</p>
<p>Okay, hold on. Hold on.</p>
<p>Look at me. Look at me.</p>
<p>Did you see this? Did you hear anything? You just ran over there?</p>
<p>Did you see it?</p>
<p>Three holes in the male, two holes in the female.</p>
<p>Five holes, one casing.</p>
<p>But with all this foot traffic, the other shells could be anywhere.</p>
<p>There's no I.D. or anything on the female.</p>
<p>But... we do have a big bulge right here.</p>
<p>Got a license.</p>
<p>Vic's name is Sung Bang.</p>
<p>And apparently, his day started a lot better than it ended.</p>
<p>Prison release forms.</p>
<p>Spent six months in Jean for repeat DUIs.</p>
<p>Walked out today.</p>
<p>It's weird. The female vic doesn't even have a lint in her pocket.</p>
<p>This guy, it's an I.D. orgasm.</p>
<p>Overload.</p>
<p>I meant I.D. overload.</p>
<p>Must have been at least a dozen people within ten feet of the victims.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, I don't think we're gonna learn much from this crowd.</p>
<p>Tells me we're probably looking for a Korean.</p>
<p>If the killer had been black, white or brown, we'd already have height, weight hair and tattoos.</p>
<p>Smells like a gang hit.</p>
<p>I found a pair of kid's sunglasses with blood spatter all over them.</p>
<p>Prints and smudges.</p>
<p>He must have been standing right here.</p>
<p>Heould have seen everything.</p>
<p>If it was me, I would have run.</p>
<p>The killer could have taken him.</p>
<p>Either way, he's missing, and we have to find this child before something happens to him.</p>
<p>CSI Season09</p>
<p>Episode06 'Say Uncle'</p>
<p>♪♪♪♪♪♪♪ where partiers were celebrating until the violence broke out.</p>
<p>Officers have been unable to identify the female victim.</p>
<p>ThatS holding things up.</p>
<p>The investigators say they're hampered by a language barrier, and their job is also complicated by the fact that many of the partygoers distrust or even fear the police.</p>
<p>I don't know, I don't know.</p>
<p>That is all I know.</p>
<p>All right, thanks. You're free to go.</p>
<p>Next.</p>
<p>How's it going?</p>
<p>I know you're tired. We need to finish the interview.</p>
<p>Sir, how close were you standing to the victims?</p>
<p>If you speak English, now would be a good time to start.</p>
<p>If it's gonna get me out of here quicker, I'll be William freakin' Shakespeare.</p>
<p>From what I understand, the Korean culture's very big on respect.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So how about giving maximum respect to the two people who were murdered and tell me what you saw?</p>
<p>You know, I like your style.</p>
<p>I give you all the forensics you want.</p>
<p>A Q-Tip in the mouth.</p>
<p>You can have my ass prints if you want, but don't ask me what happened.</p>
<p>It's not my business, so I shouldn't be flapping about it.</p>
<p>So, you think that's real, too, letting murderers run free?</p>
<p>We know it's a gang thing.</p>
<p>You don't need me then, do you?</p>
<p>Male C. O. D. is exsanguinations due to multiple GSWs.</p>
<p>Same with the female.</p>
<p>Exsanguinations due to multiple GSWs.</p>
<p>The bullets in the male were cannelured. He was shot with a revolver.</p>
<p>Female was shot twice with a semiautomatic.</p>
<p>Two guns, two killers?</p>
<p>Or one killer, two guns, gangsta style.</p>
<p>Well, his shots seem fairly straight and level, but it looks like the bullets entered her at a much steeper trajectory.</p>
<p>Yeah, approximately 20 degrees up, front to back.</p>
<p>So what?</p>
<p>He gets gunned down, she's terrified, tries to flee and then falls down as she's shot, exaggerating the trajectory?</p>
<p>Could be a drug thing.</p>
<p>She's got the needle marks to prove it.</p>
<p>I sent blood and tissue samples to Tox.</p>
<p>This ian odd-looking scar... on both eyelids.</p>
<p>Could be cosmetic surgery.</p>
<p>She's a little young for a facelift, don't you think?</p>
<p>Attractive girl on drugs, on the street with an ex-con and no I. D.</p>
<p>Sounds like a street hooker.</p>
<p>Yeah, but not someone who pays for plastic surgery.</p>
<p>Well, maybe it's a business investment courtesy of her pimp.</p>
<p>So he's unmarried with no children and apart from the DUIs, clean record.</p>
<p>No known gang affiliation.</p>
<p>He was at Dempsey's Department Store a half an hour before he was shot and was released from Jean an hour before that.</p>
<p>Jean is a 45-minute bus ride to Vegas.</p>
<p>So this guy gets out of jail and in under the running time of The Godfather, he's dead.</p>
<p>Well, a lot of people die at the end of Godfather.</p>
<p>Riley ran all the bullets and casings from the scene.</p>
<p>The gun is clean. Any I. D. on the female?</p>
<p>No, but she had a blepharoplasty.</p>
<p>Asian eyelid procedure fairly common in Korea and apparently catching on here, too.</p>
<p>Brass passed the vic's photo around Makeover Town.</p>
<p>Makeover Town? L. A. ?</p>
<p>No, it's a block of plastic surgeons in our Koreatown.</p>
<p>Our Koreatown is a block.</p>
<p>Maybe that's why he was able to find a doctor.</p>
<p>I didn't know her name.</p>
<p>You put a woman under anesthesia, you cut her open, and you don't know her name?</p>
<p>Sir, she was not an ordinary client.</p>
<p>So they forced you at gunpoint to perform eye surgery on women in a procedure that Westernizes their appearance, resulting in an effect called &quot;round eyes&quot;?</p>
<p>Ever since Jackie Chan got his eyes done, the surgery's been very popular.</p>
<p>And then they just left?</p>
<p>Yes, after they forced me to agree to give them 15% of my profits.</p>
<p>I'm gonna need names, Doctor.</p>
<p>They didn't leave any business cards.</p>
<p>I think they belong to a group called The KD.</p>
<p>The Kkangpae Dragons.</p>
<p>I never heard of.</p>
<p>And there isn't much of Vegas I haven't heard of.</p>
<p>A new outfit.</p>
<p>They don't have any tattoos or drive lowriders or spray graffiti.</p>
<p>They don't even sell drugs.</p>
<p>So what do they do, just force plastic surgeons to operate on their prostitutes?</p>
<p>Extortion is their trade.</p>
<p>They just take.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And they take from their own because they know their own.</p>
<p>They know that their own won't turn them in.</p>
<p>Well, you're very courageous to come in and report this.</p>
<p>Why won't others come forward?</p>
<p>You want a bunch of immigrants to come to the police?</p>
<p>Why don't you protect them the way you protect the tourists on the Strip and the big shots in Anthem and Seven Hills?</p>
<p>Save the stump speech for when you run for mayor.</p>
<p>I'll vote for you.</p>
<p>Are you still paying extortion?</p>
<p>No, not anymore.</p>
<p>Six months ago, I joined an HMO.</p>
<p>And they installed several security cameras around my building.</p>
<p>The Dragons don't like to be seen.</p>
<p>They prefer to be invisible.</p>
<p>Excuse me, Captain. We got a surveillance hit.</p>
<p>CSI said there were no surveillance cameras at the crime scene.</p>
<p>Hit didn't come from CSI.</p>
<p>One of my video analysts caught news of your double in Koreatown and recognized the male vic while scanning one of our video feeds.</p>
<p>From a unrelated shoplifting investigation.</p>
<p>Video analyst?</p>
<p>Yeah, why? What do you call them?</p>
<p>Forensics Services.</p>
<p>Must have a hell of a shoplifting problem.</p>
<p>We're in a high crime area, and this facility represents a corporate mission to prevent theft, fraud and personal injury in our stores.</p>
<p>You're not outsourcing that to China, too, are you?</p>
<p>All right, Artie, bring it up.</p>
<p>You know, what's your solve rate on property crime these days?</p>
<p>One in ten? One in 20?</p>
<p>Hey, you didn't tell me we were going to have a quiz.</p>
<p>You know, we nail 93%.Nationwide, Dempsey's Forensic Services has put three fugitives behind bars.</p>
<p>We're going to be in 300 locations by next summer.</p>
<p>Hey, look, you know, if it, uh, if it's legal and makes my job easier, I'm all for it.</p>
<p>There's our guy.</p>
<p>Sung Bang.</p>
<p>Archie... Artie... could you enhance the image of the boy?</p>
<p>You've got some really great cameras.</p>
<p>Good as any on the Strip.</p>
<p>In fact, our crime lab is better equipped than most in the country.</p>
<p>Now, that's a crime.</p>
<p>We're going to need that toy.</p>
<p>Mindy? The toy and the lift.</p>
<p>We didn't bother running it through AFIS.</p>
<p>He's obviously under 14 years old, so he wouldn't be in the database.</p>
<p>We licensed it from the Feds.</p>
<p>Loupe, please. Thank you.</p>
<p>This is the same boy.</p>
<p>Is that the vic's kid?</p>
<p>From everything we know, Sung Bang had no children.</p>
<p>He sure looks like the happy dad to me.</p>
<p>This is the last footage of Sung Bang leaving Dempsey's Department Store.</p>
<p>Who's the kid?</p>
<p>The boy's name is Park Bang.</p>
<p>Sung is his uncle.</p>
<p>You positive?</p>
<p>I've been Park's CPS investigator for over two years.</p>
<p>I know what he looks like.</p>
<p>Okay. Who's this?</p>
<p>Here. Come over in the light.</p>
<p>Her name's Kora Sil. Park's mother.</p>
<p>Poor boy has lost everyone.</p>
<p>What about his father?</p>
<p>Dead.</p>
<p>He was supposedly some big gangster here and in Korea.</p>
<p>The Kkangpae Dragons?</p>
<p>I don't know. I never actually met him.</p>
<p>He died of AIDS a few years ago.</p>
<p>That's when Sung took over the father role.</p>
<p>In fact, it was Sung who notified us about Kora's drug use.</p>
<p>He loved that boy.</p>
<p>You know, CSI did a tox panel on the mother.</p>
<p>Came back positive for HIV.</p>
<p>What's the boy's status? Do you know?</p>
<p>He's also HIV positive.</p>
<p>Park's on a very strict drug regimen, so we need to find him immediately.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, the drug regimen may be the least of his problems.</p>
<p>I think the gang killed his uncle and his mother, he saw it; he may already be dead.</p>
<p>Our girl has done time.</p>
<p>Three months for prostitution.</p>
<p>Three months? That's pretty harsh for Vegas.</p>
<p>Prostitution with HIV.</p>
<p>That's like pointing a gun and pulling the trigger.</p>
<p>Any last-knowns?</p>
<p>Over a dozen.</p>
<p>She's moved around a lot.</p>
<p>PD's running them down.</p>
<p>Kora Sil's Friend Agenda page. Single.</p>
<p>Born in Seoul. Likes rap music.</p>
<p>Doesn't drink or smoke.</p>
<p>But likes to shoot drugs and turn tricks with HIV.</p>
<p>Well, it's always something, isn't it?</p>
<p>Let's check the IP address of the last comment she posted.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well, looks like she's using this page to score drugs.</p>
<p>Welcome to the dark side of social networking.</p>
<p>Okay. The IP address... is...</p>
<p>What a surprise. Koreatown.</p>
<p>Of course I know Kora.</p>
<p>But why do you ask?</p>
<p>We're looking for her son.</p>
<p>Why would Park be here?</p>
<p>We're going to take a look around.</p>
<p>That's a field I. D. We photograph every person of interest in a case.</p>
<p>It's standard procedure.</p>
<p>I have no reason to lie to you.</p>
<p>I know Pk and Kora. They come over to usey computer.</p>
<p>Mr. Pan, you don't strike me as the kind of guy who would have nefarious individuals in your home.</p>
<p>Captain Brass, may we talk outside?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I've known Park's father his entire life.</p>
<p>We came over from Korea together, but we went in different directions.</p>
<p>But I still treat his family as my own, and if they want to use my computer, I let them.</p>
<p>There's nothing wrong with that.</p>
<p>No, I'll tell you what's wrong.</p>
<p>The young woman Kora is dead, and her son Park is missing.</p>
<p>Now, this crime happened about a block from where you live.</p>
<p>I can't believe you haven't heard about this.</p>
<p>I had no idea. I was in Phoenix on business.</p>
<p>Phoenix, huh?</p>
<p>House is clear, sir.</p>
<p>Thanks, Kwan.</p>
<p>Do you have any idea where Park might be?</p>
<p>No. No. I don't know.</p>
<p>I... I'm truly sorry.</p>
<p>Okay, look. Here's my card.</p>
<p>Call me if you hear or see anything that may be useful to me.</p>
<p>Thanks for your cooperation.</p>
<p>Sorry for the inconvenience.</p>
<p>Park Bang left Dempsey's Department Store at around 4:00 p. m.</p>
<p>With a shopping bag full of stuff his uncle just bought him.</p>
<p>The shooting occurred here about a half an hour later, and that's only a couple blocks away; the uncle doesn't have a car, so... they probably walked, using one of these routes.</p>
<p>What's on that receipt again?</p>
<p>T-shirt, novelty sunglasses, Crunchies, Double Fudge, Fruit Funzies and Nutty Cups.</p>
<p>Nothing says I love you like processed sugar.</p>
<p>The only thing we found at the scene were the sunglasses.</p>
<p>Where's the rest of it?</p>
<p>Okay, we're digging through trash.</p>
<p>More specifically, anything from Dempsey's Department Store.</p>
<p>Clothing tags, assorted candy items. Okay?</p>
<p>Check the cans, the Dumpsters, sewage drains, Port-a-Potties.</p>
<p>Okay, be thorough. Yeah, let's do it.</p>
<p>Remember to check along the fences, under cars.</p>
<p>These are places where evidence can hide.</p>
<p>Use your imagination.</p>
<p>I know this seems like a simple trash hunt, but it could make or break the case.</p>
<p>The sooner we find the stuff, the sooner we're going to find this kid, so don't be afraid to get your hands dirty.</p>
<p>Hodges. Come on, man.</p>
<p>I know you're not nuts about the field, but I didn't bring you all the way out here to just stand around.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Can I see you for a second?</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>You can work hard or you can work smart.</p>
<p>Can I go now?</p>
<p>LVPD! Open up!</p>
<p>Sorry to barge in on you, ma'am.</p>
<p>We're just looking for a missing little boy.</p>
<p>Gun! She's got a gun!</p>
<p>Nick, she's got a gun.</p>
<p>What are you doing? Put that thing down.</p>
<p>Lady, put that gun down right now.</p>
<p>Put the gun down or we'll shoot.</p>
<p>No, we won't. Relax.</p>
<p>Ma'am, we're looking for a little boy who's in really big trouble.</p>
<p>His name is Park Bang.</p>
<p>She doesn't understand. Where the hell is the translator?</p>
<p>She understands just fine. Don't you? Park Bang.</p>
<p>We just want to help him.</p>
<p>She doesn't understand.</p>
<p>Drop the gun! Nick!</p>
<p>Riley. What's the deal?</p>
<p>Kid's pretty weak.</p>
<p>I asked him if he remembered anything about the shootings, but he wouldn't even open his mouth.</p>
<p>Where is his CPS investigator?</p>
<p>En route.</p>
<p>You interviewed a minor without an advocate present?</p>
<p>Not officially.</p>
<p>Those regulations are there to protect the welfare of the child.</p>
<p>Don't ever do that again.</p>
<p>Look, I didn't do anything wrong.</p>
<p>I was just trying to help our case.</p>
<p>Maybe you should go back to the lab.</p>
<p>Happy to.</p>
<p>Okay, let's get that shirt off.</p>
<p>Sit up a little bit.</p>
<p>Good job.</p>
<p>Excuse me, Doctor.</p>
<p>I'm with the Las Vegas Police Department.</p>
<p>Why does this boy have a gastric tube?</p>
<p>Might be an issue with feeding.</p>
<p>Trouble swallowing, that sort of thing.</p>
<p>We'll do a chest X-ray to be sure.</p>
<p>What about this skin condition?</p>
<p>Yeah, probably a side effect of his HIV meds.</p>
<p>CPS sent his records over.</p>
<p>He's on a pretty severe regimen.</p>
<p>Why is there dried blood around the feeding tube?</p>
<p>He could have caught it on something-- tried to pull it out.</p>
<p>Hey, kiddo, I'm going to take good care of you, don't worry.</p>
<p>She says that she was just watering her garden when she heard gunshots and people started running.</p>
<p>She took the boy in and fed him and let him play with some old toys.</p>
<p>And then the boy went to sleep like little boys should.</p>
<p>She says she was just trying to protect the boy.</p>
<p>Why'd you pull a gun on the police?</p>
<p>She says that where she comes from, people would take care of their neighbors.</p>
<p>You should have turned him over to us right away.</p>
<p>She asks why?</p>
<p>So you can cut another hole in his stomach?</p>
<p>Okay, then, how about these guys?</p>
<p>Any of these guys look familiar, huh?</p>
<p>Come on, Park, you can talk to me.</p>
<p>These people are here to help you.</p>
<p>If you see one that hurt your mommy or uncle, all you have to do is point, okay, pal?</p>
<p>Don't want to do it now?</p>
<p>Okay, I'll tell you what, we'll do it another time.</p>
<p>Take care, buddy.</p>
<p>I'm going to put some police officers at the door.</p>
<p>I don't think the KD will try anything here, but you never know.</p>
<p>Are you finished?</p>
<p>I still got to collect biologicals.</p>
<p>I'll see you later.</p>

<p>He understands English, right?</p>
<p>Hi, Park.</p>
<p>My name is Gil.</p>
<p>I'm not a doctor, I'm not a policeman.</p>
<p>I'm kind of a...</p>
<p>What am I? I don't know.</p>
<p>I mostly do a lot of thinking.</p>
<p>But I do need to look under your fingernails.</p>
<p>I'm not going to grab your hand.</p>
<p>I'll just wait here until you want to give it to me, okay?</p>
<p>But I promise you it won't hurt.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Hello, Mrs. Chin.</p>
<p>I got here as fast as I could.</p>
<p>Dr. Eisling, this is Mr.</p>
<p>Grissom from the crime lab.</p>
<p>How do you do?</p>
<p>Hey, Park.</p>
<p>We're, uh...we're going to have to give him his medication here.</p>
<p>He doesn't seem to want it.</p>
<p>Well, that's why we gave him a gastric tube.</p>
<p>Okay, now come on...</p>
<p>Okay, come on...</p>
<p>Can you hold him, please?</p>
<p>I know, I know.</p>
<p>Okay, I know.</p>
<p>Come hold him.</p>
<p>Come hold him.</p>
<p>Just take his arm.</p>
<p>I know. I know.</p>
<p>Lay still, lay still.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So Park was wearing the white T-shirt during the shooting.</p>
<p>He changed into the blue one at the old woman's house.</p>
<p>Threw the white one away.</p>
<p>Makes sense.</p>
<p>It had his mother's and his uncle's blood all over them.</p>
<p>Park Bang's tox report.</p>
<p>Most adult cancer patients don't have this many drugs in their systems.</p>
<p>But an eight-year-old...</p>
<p>I've never seen anything like it.</p>
<p>Most of the drugs on that list are meant to stop cell development and stop bone marrow from producing blood, stop proteins from assembling.</p>
<p>If he continues on this regimen, by the time he's 15, he won't even have the physical development of a ten-year-old.</p>
<p>Does he actually have AIDS?</p>
<p>No, not yet.</p>
<p>He's HIV-positive.</p>
<p>If you ask me, he's being badly overmedicated.</p>
<p>Zendrek has an FDA black box label.</p>
<p>That's the strongest warning there is.</p>
<p>Life-threatening side affects Some other drugs aren't even in the market, they are only being used in clinical trials.</p>
<p>Maybe he is in one.</p>
<p>How does a little kid with a junkie mother and gangster father get on a clinical trial?</p>
<p>Well, so much for the upstanding businessman.</p>
<p>This guy's real name is Jin Ming and his mug shot was taken when he was 18 years old when he was caught stealing cars with a street racing gang.</p>
<p>Now he's 30 and he hasn't been busted since.</p>
<p>And Park had this guy's skin under his fingernails?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So they must been fighting?</p>
<p>Possibly.</p>
<p>The thing is, that skin that was under Park's nails-- it was gluteus maximus.</p>
<p>It's very similar to the epidermal tissue on the rest of the body, but it's got far fewer hair follicles.</p>
<p>So, in addition to everything else, this kid's been molested?</p>
<p>Well, maybe not.</p>
<p>Here.</p>
<p>Take a look at Jin's neck.</p>
<p>No tattoos.</p>
<p>He had a major makeover.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I went out a couple times with a casino executive who had some really unusual scars.</p>
<p>And, long story short, he told me that he was very embarrassed by some old tattoos that he had.</p>
<p>So he had them covered with replicated skin.</p>
<p>From his butt?</p>
<p>I didn't ask.</p>
<p>But, you know, if you're a street racer, then it might be kind of cool to flash a lot of ink.</p>
<p>But if you're a Kkangpae Dragon...</p>
<p>It pays to be invisible.</p>
<p>I got left.</p>
<p>This basement's the only room with anything in it.</p>
<p>The uni's were looking for the kid first time through.</p>
<p>It's probably why they missed it.</p>
<p>This must be where Park and him mother lived.</p>
<p>Why would this guy Jin kill somebody he let live in his house?</p>
<p>He's in a gang.</p>
<p>She's a druggie.</p>
<p>The possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>James Klondike trial lawyer Look at this.</p>
<p>Scumbag's in the picture with them.</p>
<p>Down!</p>
<p>Officer down!</p>
<p>Clear the house and call the paramedics!</p>
<p>Det. Cavaliere's going to be all right.</p>
<p>Minor injuries.</p>
<p>Bomb squad said the explosive was a trip wire booby trap.</p>
<p>Yeah, if Jin and the K D.really wanted to hurt somebody, they would've sent a more powerful message.</p>
<p>So, I found d an ambulance chaser's card on Kora Sil's desk.</p>
<p>Just got off the phone with him.</p>
<p>He claims that Kora was suing Park's doctor.</p>
<p>For what?</p>
<p>Money.</p>
<p>According to the lawyer, the doctor paid Kora to put Park on the clinical trial.</p>
<p>She wanted more.</p>
<p>How much was she getting?</p>
<p>25 a week.</p>
<p>She wanted 50.</p>
<p>The immune system of hiv-positive children and the use and effect of anti-hiv therapy.</p>
<p>Hello, Doctor.</p>
<p>What are you doing here?</p>
<p>I'm here to give Park his medication.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. He needs to get it every day, doesn't he?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Or else the data's useless.</p>
<p>I suppose so.</p>
<p>Then what good would it do to continue to dose him after he went missing for two days?</p>
<p>These drugs are saving his life.</p>
<p>No, they're not.</p>
<p>I don't need to be a medical doctor to see that.</p>
<p>No, what you're seeing are side effects.</p>
<p>And there are side effects to every drug.</p>
<p>Look, this is a legitimate clinical trial, Mr.</p>
<p>Grissom, approved by a formal committee...</p>
<p>Consisting of doctors who are shareholders in the pharmaceutical companies that make the drugs.</p>
<p>Without these trials, these kids get nothing.</p>
<p>And what do you get?</p>
<p>Kickbacks?</p>
<p>Your medical opinion is irrelevant.</p>
<p>What I'm doing is perfectly legal.</p>
<p>So, we're done here.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>You touch that kid, and I will charge you with reckless endangerment.</p>
<p>Child Services will back him up on that.</p>
<p>So I think you're done here.</p>
<p>We'll see about that.</p>
<p>Park...</p>
<p>I need to ask you a few questions.</p>
<p>You don't have to answer them, if you don't want to.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>Do you know this man?</p>
<p>That's Jin.</p>
<p>Did you and your mother live at his house?</p>
<p>Is that where Uncle Sung found you?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Uncle Sung didn't like my tube.</p>
<p>He fought with Mama.</p>
<p>Then Jin came down.</p>
<p>Uncle Sung saved me.</p>
<p>What happened after that?</p>
<p>I'm not gonna let Jin or Dr. Eisling hurt you.</p>
<p>But that's why I need to know what happened.</p>
<p>Jin and Mama found us.</p>
<p>Why would he want to hurt your mother?</p>
<p>I guess he was just sick of having us around.</p>
<p>Finally got a statement from the kid.</p>
<p>He says that Jin shot both his mother and his Uncle with two different guns.</p>
<p>Well, that's great.</p>
<p>Uh, that should be enough to charge Jin when we find him.</p>
<p>I-I just got faxed Sun Bang's prison record.</p>
<p>And there's something weird on his personal release form.</p>
<p>Listen to this: the guy left prison with a nine millimeter.</p>
<p>They let him out of jail with a gun?</p>
<p>Well, it's only a misdemeanor, you know.</p>
<p>It's like a hotel; you get back what you checked in.</p>
<p>So you can go out and commit a felony.</p>
<p>Apparently.</p>
<p>Now, is there any chance that Sung fired back?</p>
<p>No, we would have found extra bullets or shells at the scene.</p>
<p>Well, maybe there's a bullet lodged in Jin's body.</p>
<p>No sign of a third bleeder.</p>
<p>And if I understand the kid, Sung never got a chance to shoot back.</p>
<p>Okay, thanks.</p>
<p>I'll work on this.</p>
<p>Yep. He carried his gun in his waistband.</p>
<p>Still doesn't mean he used it.</p>
<p>And doesn't really change Park's story.</p>
<p>How do we know Kora wasn't packing?</p>
<p>The father of her son was a gangster.</p>
<p>She was living with a gangster.</p>
<p>I wouldn't put it past her.</p>
<p>Well, let's see.</p>
<p>Most women's clothes don't have a place to hide a gun.</p>
<p>That's, uh...</p>
<p>That's what purses are for.</p>
<p>Maybe Kora didn't need Jin to get her son back.</p>
<p>Maybe she took care of it herself.</p>
<p>You think they shot each other.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>There's motive, the evidence suggests it.</p>
<p>Where are their guns?</p>
<p>Dead man with a gun in the hood.</p>
<p>Gone in 60 seconds.</p>
<p>Jin skips town because this family dispute uncovers his once invisible gang.</p>
<p>He leaves the booby trap because he's angry about it.</p>
<p>It's possible.</p>
<p>It's also possible that Jin shot both vics.</p>
<p>Which is what the kid said.</p>
<p>And he was the closest witness.</p>
<p>If your uncle and your mother shot each other, you would probably blame the gangbanger, too.</p>
<p>Okay, pilgrim.</p>
<p>We'll settle this on the street.</p>
<p>If you need any water or anything, you just let me know.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Okay, Park, I know you already told me what-what happened, but now I need you to show me what happened, okay?</p>
<p>Now, we're gonna pretend that this is your mother, this is your uncle, and that's Jin.</p>
<p>Would you show me where your uncle was standing when the shooting began?</p>
<p>Where was your mother standing when the shooting began?</p>
<p>Would you show me where Jin was standing?</p>
<p>And where were you standing?</p>
<p>Did your uncle have a gun?</p>
<p>Did your mother have a gun?</p>
<p>Did your mother fall down before Jin shot her?</p>
<p>Did Jin fall down before he shot your mother?</p>
<p>He's lying.</p>
<p>Well, the ferrotrace doesn't confirm that either of them had guns at the time of the shooting.</p>
<p>But the trajectory.</p>
<p>Neither Kora nor Jin fell.</p>
<p>How do you explain Kora's 20-degree entry?</p>
<p>Park, could you show me how Jin shot your mother?</p>
<p>It was like this.</p>
<p>Bang, bang!</p>
<p>Park, would you do that again?</p>
<p>But this time, keep your arm out.</p>
<p>Bang, bang!</p>
<p>The kid shot his mother for shooting his uncle.</p>
<p>So you think Jin had nothing to do with it?</p>
<p>Not the shooting.</p>
<p>Well, it makes sense.</p>
<p>His uncle was trying to protect him, and his mother was torturing him.</p>
<p>Park never controlled anything in his life till he fired that gun.</p>
<p>An HIV-positive eight-year-old.</p>
<p>No wonder no one wanted to talk.</p>
<p>Juvi may be the best thing for him.</p>
<p>He'll get the care he needs there.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I'm sorry we solved this.</p>
<p>I really am.</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay, super, I'm ready to cut.</p>
<p>(David Phillips holds the body as Nick cuts the rope. The body is put on the gurney. David examines the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Lacerations to his chest.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Stabbed and then hanged. I guess he wasn't dead enough.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Rope burns on both palms.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: He probably tried to pull himself up.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Lift his shirt up, will you, David?</p>
<p>(David lifts the shirt and sees the victim's breasts.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Whoa! I ... thought this ... guy was a guy.</p>

<p>END FLASH</p>
<p>[INT. CSI – FORENSIC AUTOPSY – DAY]</p>
<p>(Robbins pulls out a small piece of glass from the laceration.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Lacerations aren't deep enough to have killed him. Ligature furrows canted upward. Scratches ... consistent with struggling to get free.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Brian Towne. Lived in Verdant Glen.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Hmm. Twenty years ago, my wife wanted to buy out there, but there was no 215 freeway back then. The commute would've killed me. No physical signs of Klinefelter syndrome.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So he's not an XXY.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: No, he's all skin and muscle. These can't be fatty deposits ... this is glandular tissue. His mammaries are swollen.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Gynecomastia. Pre-op transsexuals take a lot of estrogen.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: I'll run an expanded tox panel, send out for a hormone screen.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />

COMING SOON SPRING 2008<br />
ECLIPSE HOTEL &amp; CASINO</p>
<p>(Catherine and her mother, Lily Flynn, stand near the sign as they watch the construction going on in front of them.) </p>
<p><strong>Lily</strong>: It wasn't easy being a Copa girl. When the curtain came down, we had to stay and decorate the Sands Casino into the wee hours.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Ugly guys do gamble more when there's pretty girls to look at.</p>
<p><strong>Lily</strong>: They weren't all ugly. And your father, in that tuxedo ... giving me the eye, trying not to grin, 'cause he thought floor managers had to be tough.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, Mom, who made the first move?</p>
<p><strong>Lily</strong>: Sam. (She holds a chip.) Stuck this five-dollar chip in my hand and said, &quot;Take it, you can't miss.&quot; I shot craps all night with Peter Lawford and cleaned up. I was right here the day Sam opened the Rampart, his first casino.</p>
<p>INSERT: FLASHBACK</p>
<p>(A young Sam cuts the tape.) </p>
<p><strong>Lily</strong>: (V.O.) And we were going to be right here again when he opened the Eclipse.</p>
<p>(Sam turns and hugs Lily.) </p>
<p>END FLASHBACK.</p>
<p><strong>Lily</strong>: I know you wanted to be buried with this, but I just couldn't let go. I can now. They're going to build your dream on it, honey.</p>
<p>(She kisses the chip.) </p>
<p><strong>Lily</strong>: Take it. (whispers) You can't miss.</p>

<p>(Catherine goes down to find out what's going on.) </p>
<p>(The foreman talks with his worker.) </p>
<p><strong>Foreman</strong>: I don't care if it's Jimmy Louise Hoffa. I want you to grab that jackhammer and bust up this concrete.</p>
<p>(Catherine shows the officer nearby her ID.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Supervisor Willows from Crime Lab. What's going on here?</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Worker found a body.</p>
<p><strong>Worker</strong>: I'm just following protocol. You find a body, call you guys.</p>
<p>(Catherine looks at the hand sticking out of the ground.) </p>
<p><strong>Foreman</strong>: How do you know this is one of the Marquis Chimps?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: 'Cause they played the Frontier in Ronald Reagan's act. And only humans have a saddle joint. In fact, that's how we were able to swing out of trees and end up here. Opposable thumbs.</p>
<p><strong>Foreman</strong>: Well, these casinos weren't built by saints, you know.</p>
<p>(Catherine takes her phone out.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, I know. My dad built this one.</p>
<p>(She makes the call.)</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: (on phone) Crime Lab.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to phone) Yeah, this is CSI Willows. I need to hand a case off to swing. Conflict of interest.</p>

<p>(He looks at one of the bullets.) </p>
<p>(Warrick pulls the pillows off the bed as he looks for the gun. He checks under the mattress and finds a box. Inside the box, he finds the VERDANT GLEN WATER TREATMENT PLANT, the ANNUAL WATER ANALYSIS 2007 MEMO. The report is signed by JONAH QUINN, General Manager.) </p>
<p>(He puts the report aside. Also inside the box, he finds a tray with vials of water samples.) </p>

<p><strong>Lynn Towne</strong>: I want to know who did this.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, that's what we're trying to find out.</p>
<p>(She fills her glass with water from the tap and drinks.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Mrs. Towne, it would be of help if you could tell me a little bit more about your son Brian.</p>
<p><strong>Lynn Towne</strong>: He was kind ... and sweet and ... didn't have an enemy in the world.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What about friends? </p>
<p><strong>Lynn Towne</strong>: Not really. He was always so busy putting in overtime down at the ... water treatment plant. He loved to take long runs. Exercise is a natural cure for depression.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Was he depressed? I mean, there's a lot of medications here. Are these Brian's?</p>
<p><strong>Lynn Towne</strong>: No. These are all mine. I had a mastectomy eight years ago. Cancer came back three months ago.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh. I'm... I'm sorry to hear that.</p>
<p><strong>Lynn Towne</strong>: I never thought I'd outlive my son. Is there anything else?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Did you know a person with the last name Cyden? C-Y-D-E-N? </p>
<p><strong>Lynn Towne</strong>: Paul Cyden. He's a family friend; he lives a couple blocks over.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So Brian knew him, too?</p>
<p><strong>Lynn Towne</strong>: Oh, he was like a father to Brian after my husband died. </p>
<p>(Warrick enters the kitchen.) </p>
<p><strong>Lynn Towne</strong>: Why are you asking about Paul?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Ma'am, your son had a good deal of cash stashed away in his bedroom. Was he saving up for something?</p>
<p><strong>Lynn Towne</strong>: I don't know. (Warrick and Brass exchange looks.) What's going on here?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Mrs. Towne, we think Brian was saving up for a s*x change operation. Were you aware of this?</p>
<p><strong>Lynn Towne</strong>: My son was not a freak.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No, I didn't say that.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Ma'am, we're not trying to upset you in any way.</p>
<p><strong>Lynn Towne</strong>: (upset) I volunteered to let you in my house! And now I want you to leave. I want you to leave right now!</p>

[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) – DAY]</p>
<p>[EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Sara and Ronnie work on excavating the body while the construction workers continue working at other areas of the site. Ronnie puts the large stones aside.) </p>
<p><strong>Ronnie Lake</strong>: In college, I wanted to be an archeologist, until I did a summer on a dig in Tunisia. Hot. But that got me into forensics. What made you pick Vegas?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, it.. uh.. it kind of picked me.</p>
<p>(Sara snaps some photos.) </p>
<p>(The foreman stands on the side and watches them. Ronnie uncovers a piece of jewelry.) </p>
<p><strong>Ronnie Lake</strong>: Hey, check this out. </p>
<p>(Sara snaps a photo. Ronnie picks it up.) </p>
<p><strong>Ronnie Lake</strong>: Turquoise and silver beads. I got the matching necklace at the Indian market in Santa Fe.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (shouts) Everybody stop! (Ronnie is surprised.) Stop what you're doing!</p>
<p><strong>Foreman</strong>: What is the problem now? </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We have just found evidence that this might be a Native American burial site. We have to notify the Inter-Tribal Council. Until they say so, nobody touches anything.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Grissom turns the corner. Henry catches him.) </p>
<p><strong>Henry</strong>: Hey, Grissom. About your hanging victim. The one with the &quot;chesticals.&quot; (jokes) The man boobs ... uh, the ... (sees Grissom's serious look) ... gynecomastia, sorry.</p>
<p>(Henry gives him the report.) </p>
<p><strong>Henry</strong>: Quant hormone report. Androgen's low. Estradiol's high. It's 250 picograms per milliliter. Arogester one, too.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Estrogen level is five times the normal amount for an adult male.</p>
<p><strong>Henry</strong>: It's consistent with a pre-op transsexual.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, but there's no other pre-op drugs in his system. No spironolactone, no flutamide, progesterone.</p>
<p><strong>Henry</strong>: Maybe he's a &quot;do-it-yourselfer.&quot;</p>
<p>(Grissom looks at Henry.) </p>
<p><strong>Henry</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(Henry turns and leaves. Grissom continues down the hallway.) </p>

<p><strong>Paul Cyden</strong>: (to phone) This is he.</p>
<p>(Brass hangs up as he and Catherine walk on the dock toward Cyden. He sees them.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Paul Cyden. I'm Detective Jim Brass, this is Catherine Willows, from the Crime Lab. I'd like to ask you a couple questions about Brian Towne.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Cyden</strong>: What a great kid. I can't believe he's gone.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: When was the last time you talked with him?</p>
<p><strong>Paul Cyden</strong>: Oh ... uh ... honestly, I don't remember.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, you don't remember yesterday? Calling him? Texting him?</p>
<p><strong>Paul Cyden</strong>: Brian occasionally does odd jobs for me.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: How odd?</p>
<p><strong>Paul Cyden</strong>: I ... uh ... study water. I'm a hydrologist, retired, but I still do consulting. Brian was helping me with a project.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, it seems to me, according to your messages, Brian was the project.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Cyden</strong>: You're way off base.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Then you won't mind giving us your fingerprints and DNA?</p>
<p><strong>Paul Cyden</strong>: Not if you have a court order.</p>
<p>(Brass's phone rings.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Look, you can do this the hard way or the easy way. But trust me, we're going to get this done.</p>
<p>(Brass answers his phone.) </p>

<p>[INT. CSI – DNA LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Wendy is working on the two beer bottles found at the lake. Nick appears in the doorway and looks inside. He lingers. As the computer trills, Wendy turns and looks at him. Nick's back is to the door as he waits for the results.) </p>
<p><strong>Wendy</strong>: Are you lurking around here for results?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No. No, no. I wouldn't do that. I was just ... uh... I was getting a cup of coffee.</p>
<p><strong>Wendy</strong>: Actually. You can come in.</p>
<p>(Nick walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Why, do you got something?</p>
<p><strong>Wendy</strong>: I do. I got a two-fer. I got epithelials from the rope from multiple contributors, and one of them ... drank from the bloody beer bottle.</p>
<p>(She pulls up the ID results.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Larry Ludwig. Convicted of aggravated assault and DUI. Bring up his parole record. </p>
<p><strong>Wendy</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(The record appears on screen.) </p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Do you think that we found the bones of one of their ancestors?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Well, the fusing of the plates and shape of the skull indicate a 30-year-old of the Mongoloid race.</p>

(Lee George is in the back office looking through the ledger. He finds a torn piece of it and takes a photo of it. He immediately takes the film out of the camera and puts the film in the metal film container. He puts his camera back together.) </p>
<p>(He hears a sound and picks up the camera to pretend to take a photo of the ledger. Benny Dunbar walks in.)</p>
<p><strong>Benny Dunbar</strong>: I'll take that camera, kemosabe.</p>
<p>(Lee George tosses the camera at Benny Dunbar and runs out of the room.) </p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
(Lee George is up in the unfinished areas of the hotel. He tries opening the door only to find it locked. He runs to the next door. Benny Dunbar turns the corner. He shoots Lee George in the back.) </p>
<p>(He tosses Lee George off the building and down the shaft. He turns and leaves.) </p>
<p>END FLASHBACK.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Either Benny tossed him or he jumped. We'll never know.</p>
<p>(Greg picks up his hat.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: This is great stuff for my book.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Your what?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Oh, this little piece on Vegas history -- stories that didn't make the papers.</p>
<p><strong>Lily</strong>: Honey, if you need to know anything, just ask me. I was there.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, how about if I take you to dinner tonight? A bottle and a bird. We'll talk about the Peking Pimp.</p>
<p>(Greg and Lily leave the room arm-in-arm.) </p>
<p><strong>Lily</strong>: Eddie Chang. They shipped him home in pieces.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – LAYOUT ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Grissom shows the Verdant Glen community and stream as he talks about the plant with Nick, Warrick and Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Twenty years ago, Verdant Glen was far enough outside Vegas to get the right to use well water for drinking. They also got approval to remove waste water at a private plant. There, it was cleaned, creating &quot;grey water,&quot; which was used for secondary purposes -- watering lawns, washing cars, everything but drinking. The treatment plant then stored excess grey water in the reservoir.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Where they let the kids fish and swim.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It passed every water quality test.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And the carp from Paul Cyden's freezer had high levels of estrogen plus other prescription drugs.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Brian's level and tox panel correlate to the carp. Cyden was collecting water samples from the reservoir, the tap, and the treatment plant.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Thanks to Brian.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: According to Cyden's research, the hormone levels in the tap water are nearly equal to the water in the reservoir.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I thought they drink ground water.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: They do. Cyden was convinced that the ground water was contaminated.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He discovered that the reservoir was improperly lined, allowing the grey water to leech into the ground water.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, if that's the case, then why didn't the other boys develop breasts?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: There's a good chance that others have been affected, especially children who were born to women who were living there while they were pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Because the womb is the only place a human lives in fluid ... like a fish.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: That reservoir is supposed to be lined to prevent contamination.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Obviously, it's not. Or the lining's defective. Which is the decision I think Cyden had come to right before he was shot.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – INTERVIEW ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Nick and Brass talk with Jonah Quinn.) </p>
<p><strong>Jonah Quinn</strong>: You don't know where he got those samples. Cyden could have pulled them from raw sewage for all I know. And just for the record, that reservoir was built to code. You show me one complaint, one documented illness from that water.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What about Brian Towne?</p>
<p><strong>Jonah Quinn</strong>: Listen ... it's a tragedy ... but his mother has breast cancer. You don't think it's that gene pool that might be polluted?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Let me ask you something. Why did you offer to pay such a big price for Paul Cyden's house?</p>
<p><strong>Jonah Quinn</strong>: He's a nut. He was trying to sink me. His research was wrong, but perception is reality these days. I admit it. I was trying to buy him off. Would have been money well spent.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: But he turned you down. Is that why you shot him?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I mean, with Brian gone, you're in the clear.</p>
<p><strong>Jonah Quinn</strong>: Look, I don't need a gun; I've got lawyers. And I would like to speak to them now.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – BALLISTICS LAB – DAY]</p>
<p>(Catherine gives the bullet to Warrick.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Here's the bullets pulled from Paul Cyden.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>(He looks at them under the magnifying glass.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, all three are jacketed hollow points with a center post. Hydra-<br />
Shok. Only one company makes them--Federal. You know what? Cath, I found a box of this same ammo in Brian Towne's bedroom. Five bullets missing.</p>
<p>(Catherine sits down and checks the computer to see if Brian Towne bought a gun. Warrick looks at the bullet under the scope.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Got five lands and grooves, right-hand twist. Could've been fired from a Smith and Wesson, Ruger, or a Taurus.</p>
<p>(Catherine comes up with a computer result.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Brian bought a Ruger SP 101 revolver two weeks ago.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Damn. The mother had access to that gun and motive.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. HOSPITAL (STOCK) – DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. HOSPITAL] </p>
<p>(Catherine talks with Lynn Towne.) </p>
<p><strong>Lynn Towne</strong>: I was too busy taking care of me ... to see what was wrong with him. The signs were there.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mrs. Towne, don't blame yourself. You had a teenager who was depressed and not communicating and you push too hard and they pull away ...</p>
<p><strong>Lynn Towne</strong>: I should have pushed. If I had gone through his room before he died ... maybe then ... </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Is that when you found his gun?</p>
<p><strong>Lynn Towne</strong>: I was trying to understand why. I went through his e-mails. Paul was taking him to LA. I trusted him, and all those years that he pretended to be our friend ... He killed my son.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mrs. Towne ... he was trying to save your son, not hurt him. We found this letter on Paul's computer. You need to read it.</p>
<p>(Catherine gives the letter to Lynn.) </p>
<p><strong>Paul Cyden</strong>: (V.O.) &quot;I have decided to alert you to this grave matter prior to contacting the EPA. It is my professional conclusion that the water in this community contains unsafe levels of pharmaceutical contaminants, which have caused irreparable harm to wildlife and humans. One specific example is the case of Brian Towne. His endocrine system and physical body have been<br />
'feminized' due to chronic ingestion of the water at Verdant Glen.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: He was going to blow the whistle. I think that's what Paul was trying to explain to you when you went over to confront him.</p>
<p><strong>Lynn Towne</strong>: I worked two jobs to keep us in our house because ... because Brian loved it so much. And being there is what killed him.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) – NIGHT]</p>
<p>[INT. CSI – GRISSOM'S OFFICE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Grissom and Catherine talk with ADA Kirkson.) </p>
<p><strong>Kirkson</strong>: The feds have already swooped in to investigate the water problem.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Do they plan to prosecute Jonah Quinn?</p>
<p><strong>Kirkson</strong>: They'll try, but Quinn isn't the only one involved. Verdant Glen is now owned by a conglomerate -- the Altimera World Group. They'll bring in experts to contradict the research, discredit witnesses. They'll say that there are chemicals in everything that we eat, touch, breathe. It'll be in litigation for years.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What about Brian's mother?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Are you going to prosecute her?</p>
<p><strong>Kirkson</strong>: Did you recover the murder weapon, find her prints in blood at Cyden's house, or get a signed confession?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Her son's gun plus motive -- that's not enough?</p>
<p><strong>Kirkson</strong>: She's a widow with breast cancer who lost her only kid.</p>
<p>(Kirkson stands up.) </p>
<p><strong>Kirkson</strong>: No way I'd get her in front of a jury and ask them to convict. Nice work though.</p>
<p>(She leaves.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Lynn Towne goes free.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's all out of our hands now.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: That's not enough for me. If their lawyers can hog-tie the EPA for years, someone's got to go around them. They've got to take Brian's story and the research to the press. I mean, if ... if it's happened here, what's to say there aren't other Brians out there?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You can't give information about a case to the media. You'll get fired.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: As a mother, maybe I don't care.</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>

<p>WHITE FLASH TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. WESTERN LAS VEGAS CORRECTIONAL FACILITY --DAY]</p>
<p>(The inmates, dressed in bright red exercise outside. They play basketball, lift weights, etc.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: One inmate in his cell addresses a package to:<br />
GIL GRISSOM<br />
c/o CSI<br />
2974 WESTFALL<br />
LAS VEGAS, NV89109 )</p>
<p>(The inmate carries the package and walks out with the other inmates who also have letters and things to mail.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Into the bag, follow me.</p>
<p>(One by one, the inmates put their letters into the open mailbag set up to the side of the hallway.)</p>
<p>(The inmate carrying the box addressed to GRISSOM, puts it into the mailbag and keeps walking.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: The package is placed on a conveyor belt and scanned through the X-ray. The camera rises to the monitor and shows that inside the package is a video tape.)</p>
<p>(The package exits the scanner and is picked up on the other side.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY /BREAK ROOM-- DAY]</p>
<p>(The delivery person carries the stamped package down the hallway. He turns the corner and walks into the Break Room where GRISSOM is leafing through a magazine.)</p>
<p><strong>Delivery Boy</strong>: This came for you, Mr. Grissom.</p>
<p>(He hands the package to GRISSOM who takes it and puts it on the table between him and BRASS. GRISSOM leans over to look at it as does BRASS.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What's this? An anonymous package from county lockup?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes out something to open the package. BRASS immediately protests.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, well, hey, just a second. Wait a minute. Give an innocent bystander a chance to clear out, will you?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What are you worried about?</p>
<p>BRASS One minute, I'm eating tomato salad. The next ... I'm gazpacho.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes off the wrapping and opens the box. Inside is the video tape.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: With any luck it'll be the next episode of G-String Divas.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM puts it in the video tape machine and turns it on. He settles back in the chair to watch.)</p>
<p>(On videotape, FRANK DAMON sits in front of the camera and blows lightly into the clip-on microphone then rather than put it on, he holds onto it as he speaks.)</p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: (on videotape) My name is Frank Damon ... and I'm awaiting trial for the murder of ... my wife and son.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (nods) That's an arson case -- a few months ago. The DA is asking for the death penalty.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: (on videotape) I didn't kill my family ... but my lawyer says the evidence is against me.</p>
<p>(Something about the videotape captures GRISSOM'S attention. He stares at the monitor intently.)</p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: (on videotape) I was a good father. I loved him. I would have given my life for Toby and Jeannie. They were my world. Mr. Grissom, you are my last hope. Please ... help me.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: An innocent man. Jail's full of them.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It only takes one.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - BREAK ROOM -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM is sitting at the table reviewing the files. In the background through the glass, we see CATHERINE walk toward the room; NICK and SARA follow her.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM continues to read the file. Suddenly CATHERINE leans over and stares at the file over his shoulder.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns to look at her.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Am I disturbing you?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Good.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM realizes that everyone's there for their assignments.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Oh. Great. Sorry.</p>
<p>(Everyone starts to take their seats around the table. GRISSOM puts the file down and looks around the stacks of paper on the table. He sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Uh, I was supposed to pass out some supervisor evaluation forms. Where are they?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE grabs the papers on the table and starts handing them out.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Here they are.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (sits down &amp; smiles) Mmm. Get to rate the boss. I dig this.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE gives NICK the evaluation form.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Give him a perfect ten or your ass is out of here.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (exasperated) No, it's not.</p>
<p>(SARA laughs. CATHERINE hands her an evaluation form and heads around the table toward WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: All right. Assignment: Parking lot of the sportsbook at the Monaco. Caucasian male found dead in the front seat of his car.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE sits down.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Two days before the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>(Sounds promising to WARRICK as he leans forward.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'll take a piece of that.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No. Uh, Nick and Catherine.</p>
<p>(WARRICK sniffs and settles back in his seat. SARA pipes up.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What else you got?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You and Warrick are working with me.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The prisoner plea. Brass told me about the video.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah. If we take the case we have very little time to work it. The trial starts in three days.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: How did he find you? 1-800-GRISSOM ... ?</p>
<p>(NICK laughs.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Wait a minute. Ecklie was the CSI on that arson. I see a bad moon rising.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Can a CSI take over another CSIi's case?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Only if they're of equal rank and they're looking for trouble.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No trouble. We're both colleagues searching for the truth. Okay, that's it. Look ... onward. You have to start by looking at this.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM holds out the video tape. SARA reaches out and takes it.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey, what happened to that, uh, meeting the other day?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Meeting?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, the department heads were voting on an extra vacation day or something?</p>
<p>(NICK, who had already stood up to leave for his assignment, stops and turns to listen to WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM stares at them ... clueless. He doesn't say anything and it's obvious that he didn't go to the meeting. CATHERINE shrugs.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (looks at evaluation) Hmm. &quot;Organization&quot; ... minus one.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. CSI - PARKING LOT -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(GRISSOM is in his car about to leave, when BRASS calls out to him as he approaches the car from the passenger side.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yo, cousin. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns to look at BRASS.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'm going to save you some gas here. I did some checking on your pal Damon.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I don't remember asking you to.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Eyewitness saw him running from his burning house. Inside was his wife and kid. Now, wife's a big spender. Maxed out on the credit cards. They just bought the place and already he's late on the payments. Couple's always arguing about money. No surprise.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, how does killing his family solve his money problems?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Maybe he didn't mean to. Maybe he needed the insurance dough and things got out of hand.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Too many maybes. I think we should go with the evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, I got something for you on that, too. Gasoline found in the master bedroom closet.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, a hydrocarbon. I read Ecklie's report. </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Did you skip the page with Damon's credit card receipts? Guy bought a gallon of gas a week before the fire.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Do I seem like the kind of guy who skips stuff?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Read my lips. There is no compelling evidence to suggest Damon was wrongfully charged.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, then, it'll be a short interview, won't it?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM starts the car engine.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<hr />
[EXT. MONACO CASINO - PARKING LOT - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and NICK walk up to the crime scene.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Whew! Two days before the super bowl and they're already killing each other.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks into the car window. SGT. O'RILEY peers in through the open driver-side door at CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, O'Riley, anyone put their meat hooks on this vehicle?</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. O'Riley</strong>: How long have we worked together?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Still got to ask.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Sergeant.</p>
<p>(SGT. O'RILEY sees that NICK wants to get to the body. He steps aside and NICK steps forward to look at the body leaning against the steering wheel.)</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. O'Riley</strong>: What's up?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Oh ... gunshot wound to the head, point-blank range.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Just a baby. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE snaps a photo of the body. She opens the back door and picks up the wallet to check it.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Tap city. Empty.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The DRIVER gets into the car. As soon as the car door closes, the KILLER sits up and puts the gun to the back of his head.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) Killer was probably in the back seat waiting for him. </p>
<p>(The KILLER shoots; blood spurts onto the windshield.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) Kid never stood a chance.</p>
<p>(The KILLER reaches over for the wallet. Once he gets it, he pushes the dead body toward the steering wheel. White flash to: The KILLER removes the money from the wallet)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(NICK examines the dead body and notices something stuck in his ear.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Check this out. Hearing aid?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Maybe he was deaf.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Possibly. </p>
<p>(NICK puts his flashlight down, then moves to the back seat behind the driver. He opens the door and notices the window.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Got some condensation on the window. You should get a shot of this.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE pulls out a plastic bag under the back seat passenger side chair. She opens it and checks inside, then chuckles.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You hungry, Nick? Got a burger. Extra lettuce.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE takes out a stack of hundred dollar bills. It's wrapped with two rubber bands with a paper that reads: </p>
<p>MONACO CASINO<br />
4D207-D5DF-304...<br />
550 000 STRAIGHT BET<br />
LAKER - 11<br />
TO WIN 550 000<br />
TOTAL 510 000<br />
576 TELLER #?<br />
26JAN01 **:25:42<br />
4D207-D5DF-3...</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: A rule of thumb: $2,500 an inch. There's got to be ... fifteen thousand there?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks at the paper label and reads.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: &quot;Giants ... negative nine.&quot;</p>
<p>(Something sounds recognizable to NICK. He looks at CATHERINE and she hands over the money to NICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: &quot;Giants minus nine.&quot;</p>
<p>(NICK shows CATHERINE the ticket attached to the stack of bills.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: It's a super bowl ticket. Straight bet-- $30,000.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What does a kid doing walking around with a wad like that betting thirty grand on a football game? Who wrote the ticket?</p>
<p>(NICK pulls out the ticket and shows it to CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Teller 12.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT MONACO CASINO - NIGHT] </p>
<p>(CATHERINE and NICK question TONY, TELLER 12.)</p>
<p><strong>Tony (teller 12)</strong>: Yeah, I wrote the ticket. So what?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, it was found with the kid killed in your parking lot.</p>
<p><strong>Tony (teller 12)</strong>: Yeah. 30 dimes. It was 517's.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: 517? What's that?</p>
<p><strong>Tony (teller 12)</strong>: That's his number. He was a runner.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: A runner?</p>
<p><strong>Tony (teller 12)</strong>: Yeah, a gofer -- runs from book to book places bets with other people's money.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Kid wasn't a day over sixteen. Isn't that illegal?</p>
<p><strong>Tony (teller 12)</strong>: Lady, he's not buying a pack of cigarettes. He's betting<br />
$30,000. Vig for the house is three grand. We look the other way.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I'd be willing to bet there's a mother out there that wishes you hadn't.</p>
<p><strong>Tony (teller 12)</strong>: Hey, what do I care? I'm out of this job by the end of the week. Tired of looking at scumbags.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, does 517 have a name?</p>
<p><strong>Tony (teller 12)</strong>: I only know them by their numbers.</p>
<p>(NICK turns and walks away.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to TONY) Well, you've been very helpful. Thank you.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. WESTERN LAS VEGAS CORRECTIONAL FACILITY - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks up to the gate.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Evening.</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Here you go.</p>
<p>(The GUARD opens the gate for him.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Inmate</strong>: Yo, Grissom! </p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns and sees a guard leading a line of inmates for a walk in the fresh night air.)</p>
<p><strong>Inmate</strong>: (to other inmate) This guy's the reason I'm in here. Shoe print.<br />
(yells) Yo, man, next time I'll go barefoot!</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (yells back, amused) Even better. Footprints.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns to walk into the facility.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. PRISON - CONFERENCE ROOM -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The guard leads FRANK DAMON to the cubicle where GRISSOM sits waiting for him. He picks up the telephone.)</p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: So, you're the Grissom they wrote about in the newspaper? I thought you'd be older.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Why did you contact me, Mr. Damon?</p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: Arson specialist gave me your name. Well, six of them, actually. They all turned my case down. Will you help me?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Fires are very complicated. </p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: It wasn't too complicated for the guy who put me in here. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM doesn't answer him right away. He looks at FRANK DAMON for a long moment.)</p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: You think if you stare at me long enough, you can tell if I'm innocent?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I don't mean to stare ... but, yes, I can learn some things. For instance, the back of your hands are smooth. You read a lot. You have indentation marks on your nose from reading glasses. Your speech tells me that you're well-educated. Your occupation's not listed in the file, but I think that you had a white-collar job.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: (nods) Paper-pusher for the phone company.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I don't know yet whether you're left- or right-handed, though. </p>
<p>(FRANK instinctively pulls his right hand toward him. GRISSOM notices the movement.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Now, you want to tell me what happened?</p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: It was about midnight.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The night of the fire, FRANK leans in to kiss JEANNIE as she tucks the blanket around TOBY. FRANK straightens up.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: Okay, baby.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: (V.O.) My wife, Jeannie -- she was hungry. She had a food craving.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: She sent me out to the store to get her some ice cream.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The night of the fire, JEANNIE turns and lightly touches TOBY'S head as he lies in bed.)</p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: (V.O.) My son, Toby, he was in the bed with us.</p>
<p>(FRANK puts his coat on to leave.)</p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: (V.O.) He couldn't sleep. I was going to take him camping the next day.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: Toby was eight.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Why don't you tell me about the fire.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The night of the fire, the SUV pulls up into the driveway.)</p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: (V.O.) I got back from the store in under 20 minutes.</p>
<p>(He parks the car and sees the smoke rising from the house.)</p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: (V.O.) I saw smoke coming out of the back of the house. I could hear the alarm.</p>
<p>(He rushes into the house and runs to the bedroom.)</p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: Jeannie!</p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: (V.O.) The house was filled with smoke.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: Jeannie!</p>
<p>(FRANK reaches the bedroom door and sees the smoke coming out from under the opening.)</p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: (V.O.) I checked the door for heat. I knew not to open it.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: Flashover.</p>
<p>(Surprised that FRANK even knows about &quot;flashovers&quot;.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Flashover?</p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: That's right. When the fire reaches about 932 degrees Fahrenheit you add oxygen and the smoke will burst into flame. I know how fire behaves, Mr. Grissom, because I'm a volunteer fireman. I was hoping to make the department this Spring. So I couldn't open the door. I ran outside to my car to call a rig.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, if you're a volunteer fireman then you must be familiar with the use of accelerants.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: According to the report there were traces of gasoline found on the floor of your bedroom closet.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: That's right, and I don't know how it got there. We didn't keep anything like that in the house.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Our homicide department has a credit card receipt for gasoline -- your receipt -- and there's no other suspects.</p>
<p>(FRANK'S getting upset.)</p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: I didn't burn down my house, Mr. Grissom. I bought the gasoline for the lawnmower and kept it in the garage. Now, if there was gasoline in our closet someone else put it there. Find them.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I don't chase criminals, Mr. Damon. I just evaluate evidence.</p>
<p>(FRANK puts his hand up against the glass. GRISSOM glances at it and notices something.)</p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: I need someone to believe me -- to figure this out.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How did you burn your hand, Mr. Damon?</p>
<p>(FRANK puts his hand down.)</p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: I don't remember.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: People with third-degree burns don't forget how they got them.</p>
<p>(FRANK takes a breath.)</p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: You're not going to help me?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'll take your case. I don't know whether I'll help you or not.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: ... The firemen have.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Funny place for a mattress.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Overhaul. Post-blaze, firemen remove charred items to neutralize the hot spots. Prevents flare-ups.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Waterproof matches.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Bag those.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What do you think? The kid might have started it?</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The fire was contained inside this room ... but the outside door frame is severely charred.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, fires take the path of least resistance. I mean, they feed off of oxygen and combustibles.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We're going to take a piece of this back to the lab.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It's a weird place for such a thorough burn especially since the door isn't scorched.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Look at this. Rubber?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM kneels down to look at what's burned into the door knob. They all look at it.)</p>

<p>(WARRICK snaps a photo.)</p>
<p>(They walk into the bedroom.)</p>
<p>[MASTER BEDROOM]</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: According to Ecklie's report, which was filed in record time, the point of origin for the fire was the closet. Gris, there's nothing left here.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at the closet.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: More than you think. &quot;V&quot; pattern on the outside wall. Fires like to go up and out.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: That's why you can always count on seeing a pattern.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This one's narrow. This was a very intense, rapidly moving fire.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, that confirms Ecklie's findings about the use of an accelerant.</p>
<p>(WARRICK snaps a photo.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The apex of the &quot;V&quot; usually indicates the point of origin. You want to call it, Warrick?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Damon doused the closet floor with gasoline, lit it and got the hell out of dodge.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM sees something on the floor.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Shards of glass.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Bag a sample. I'll put it through the lab.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM fingers the glass and can't move it. He looks up at SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Can't. It's melted into the concrete.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI close up of the glass melted into the concrete.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So that's why the concrete's discolored? From the heat?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's called &quot;spalling.&quot; It confirms the presence of an accelerant.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Why would there be glass in the middle of the hot spot?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Good question.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Who cares? The guy torched his wife and kid.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns to look at WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Really? Where's the trailing? An arsonist would spread the gasoline around to maximize the burn area.</p>
<p>(After a moment, SARA concurs.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: He still did the job.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah? Why was there no trailing? And why no evidence of an incendiary device anywhere in the bedroom?</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: He's a volunteer fireman, Gil. He knows how to start a fire and hide the evidence. Don't you think, if this guy was remotely innocent his attorney would be involved in your little investigation?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What are you so afraid of, Conrad? We're just a couple of science geeks. Why can't we work together?</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Something you probably should have done.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: (scoffs) You're checking for faulty wiring? Waste of time, Gil. Fire started on the floor in the closet not in the wires in the wall.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, that was your report. This is an electrical socket from the closet where a space heater was plugged in.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: A heater? There was no heater there.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I found it in the living room, melted.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: And I suppose you happen to know which outlet it was plugged into?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It was a cold night. The outlet in the closet was closest to her bed. </p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: That's a little far-fetched, don't you think?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Look ... if this wire burned from the inside out then the fire started in the wall not on the closet floor.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Discoloration throughout the conductor. It burned from the inside out. The cause of this fire was an electrical overload in the wall.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: All right, you say wall, I say floor. We differ on points of origin. The jury's only going to hear one word: Gasoline.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Speaking of which ... where's your accelerant analysis work?</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: I personally swabbed the closet floor. Found traces of hydrocarbon chains confirming gasoline. Leave it alone, Gil. The DA agrees with me on this.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Too many unanswered questions, Conrad. This case should not be going to trial yet.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: No, there's only one unanswered question. Why was there accelerant in the closet? Only one person knows. And that's why he's looking at the death penalty.</p>
<p>(ECKLIE leaves the lab.)</p>

[INT. PRISON - INTERVIEW ROOM -- DAY]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM questions FRANK DAMON again.)</p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: Look, I told you ... I don't know why it was there.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You've got to do better than that.</p>
<p>(Frustrated, FRANK gets to his feet.)</p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: (frustrated) I can't!</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It doesn't prove you didn't start it. Until we can explain why there was gasoline in the bedroom closet the charges stand.</p>
<p>(FRANK turns to look at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: Then I guess I'm a dead man.</p>

[INT. CSI - HALLWAY -- DAY]</p>
<p>(SGT. O'RILEY lines up a group of young men in a row out in the hallway.)</p>
<p><strong>702</strong>: Hey, this is bull. I thought I was showing up to win a trip.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, one of you is going to win a trip, all right. Everybody clear this is voluntary?</p>
<p><strong>702</strong>: Yeah, sure. Then she just calls the cops to come and arrest us.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So everyone is clear.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks at the men in the line-up. No one says anything. CATHERINE turns around to look at NICK, who immediately agrees with her.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay ... here's what we're going to do. Open your nostrils.</p>
<p><strong>702</strong>: (laughs) You know, look, I got a hundred bucks that says none of us are the shooter.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, if you're that confident it's not one of your guys you must know who it is.</p>
<p><strong>702</strong>: Even if I did, you think I would tell you?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You're on cool breeze. A hundred bucks.</p>
<p>702 (smiles) Okay.</p>
<p>(NICK takes the sample. CATHERINE walks to the other end of the line and stares up at the young man.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Head back. </p>
<p>(Cut to: Close up of a scissors snipping off the end of the swab. The swab is put into sample with a sicker label &quot;702&quot; next to it are glass containers for<br />
318, 526, and 431.)</p>
<p>(The swab is processed and tested.)</p>
<p>(The results are printed.)</p>
<p>(NICK reads the results and sighs. He hands the results back to the LAB TECH.)</p>

[INT. HALLWAY - DAY -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(NICK walks out into the hallway.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay. You're all free to go.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: This way, gents.</p>
<p>(The runners turn to leave the hallway. 702 turns to look at NICK.)</p>
<p><strong>702</strong>: You owe me a c-note, baby.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah. I don't have it on me. I'll have to bring it to you.</p>
<p><strong>702</strong>: Okay. I'll be holding my breath.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>(NICK takes off his gloves, turns to look at CATHERINE, then holds out his hands in front of him fingers wide and growls.)</p>
<p>(He walks away. CATHERINE remains in the hallway looking at the runners.)</p>

[INT. CSI - GRISSOM'S OFFICE]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM sits and desolately counts the waterproof matches found in TOBY'S backpack.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (o.s.) Counting matches?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks up to see SARA lingering in the doorway.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(SARA walks into the office and stands in front of his desk.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: From the kid's room. I counted them yesterday. And I counted them this morning. Twenty. They're all there. I really don't know what I'm doing anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I got a theory. You want to hear it?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks up at SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p>(She sits down.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You know the melted shards of glass we found on the closet floor? They prove that the fire burned at over a thousand degrees, right? But that temp, combined with the water used to douse the flames would have destroyed most of the accelerant.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's what happens.</p>
<p>(WARRICK walks into the office.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So, Ecklie's conclusion of gasoline wasn't based on any physical evidence. It was based on Damon's credit card receipts.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (shakes his head) I can't fault him for that. The burn pattern is consistent with a gasoline accelerant.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: But, hydrocarbons are found in all kinds of things: Oils ... kerosene, polyethylene-based compounds like laxatives-- even the foam used in push-up bras.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah. Under the right conditions, any hydrocarbon can be an accelerant.</p>
<p>(This perks GRISSOM up as he now has something to go on. He looks at SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Thank you. (to WARRICK) Warrick, you're driving.</p>
<p>(SARA smiles back at GRISSOM. They both stand up.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You ever worry about professional suicide?</p>
<p>(He looks at WARRICK and answers brightly while shaking his head.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Not while I'm committing it, no.</p>

[EXT. DAMON'S RESIDENCE - STREET -- DAY] </p>
<p>(The Tahoe pulls up the side of the street and stops. They notice the large white van parked in the driveway and the clean-up crew taking out the items from the house. They watch as they move the burned mattress.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Crime scene cleanup.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM whacks WARRICK'S arm to get his attention.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (angry) Let's go.</p>

[INT. CSI - BREAK ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(GRISSOM charges in through the hallway looking for ECKLIE. He walks into the break room. WARRICK follows behind him.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You son of a bitch. You swept my crime scene. You sent cleanup!</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: I didn't send anyone. It's been on the books for months.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So you knew, and did nothing about it even with a man's life on the line?</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: If you'd have checked the docket like everybody else you would've known what was happening. Coffee?</p>
<p>(ECKLIE holds out the coffee pot and GRISSOM, being angry as he is, knocks the pot clear across the room where the carafe flies across the way, crashes and shatters into the wall. Broken glass mixed with hot coffee drips along the sides.)</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Guess you don't want cream with that.</p>
<p>(ECKLIE leaves the break room. WARRICK turns and watches him leave. GRISSOM stands there and stares at the broken carafe, something stirring at the back of his mind.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes a step forward toward the broken glass and liquid, this appears to be very familiar to him.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Extreme close up of the melted glass in the closet floor. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: May I ask you a question?</p>
<p><strong>Rachel</strong>: Sure. Anything to help Frank.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You're his family. What was his relationship like with his wife and son?</p>
<p>(She smiles.)</p>
<p><strong>Rachel</strong>: Frank was a wonderful father. Toby adored him. (She stops and excuses herself.) Uh, I'm sorry. I, um ... I have to get back to work. But thank you.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We found shards of melted glass on the floor of your closet. You want to tell me about it?</p>
<p>(FRANK still doesn't say anything.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Okay, you can explain it in court. It's all part of the report now.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM hangs up. FRANK looks startled and taps on the glass. He motions for GRISSOM to pick up the phone.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM picks it up.)</p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: I didn't leave that night to buy ice cream. I was leaving Jeannie.</p>

<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: I warned you. </p>
<p><strong>Jeannie Damon</strong>: Just a few things.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: You can have the damn stuff! I told you this was the last time.</p>

<p>(He grabs more clothes out of the closet.)</p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I'm leaving. You can be broke by yourself!</p>

<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Jeannie Damon</strong>: Get out!</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: So I just got the hell out of there. Drove for about twenty minutes and then thought, how could I end ten years of our life like that? I mean, we had a son, so I turned around.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Wait a minute. Go back. What did she throw at you? Be specific.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: (chuckles) Man, I just ducked and covered. I don't remember.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Think.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: Uh ... a-a phone. A-a bag. Uh, a vase maybe?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What kind of a vase?</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Was it even a vase?</p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: Look, I don't know. I can't remember.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (persistent) Was it glass? Could it have been glass?</p>
<p><strong>Frank Damon</strong>: Yes. It was glass. It was a glass lamp, because it had a wick.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The night of the fire, FRANK and JEANNIE argue. She throws things at him.)</p>

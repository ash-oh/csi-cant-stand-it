<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Sirens wail in the distance.) </p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS STREET - DAY]</p>
<p>(A black Caprice zooms down the street. Two officer cars are pursuing it, their sirens blaring.) </p>
<p>(The black car crosses an intersection, nearly hitting a white car crossing it at the same time. The white car's horn blares.) </p>
<p>(The black car turns the corner. The officer cars continue their pursuit, sirens blaring. The intermittent sounds of automatic guns firing are heard during the chase.) </p>
<p>(In one of the cars, Brass is driving; Sofia sits in the passenger seat.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: These guys are hard core. Who are they?</p>
<p>(The car chase continues.) </p>
<p>(In the second car are two officers. The older officer, Sergeant Adams, is driving; the younger officer in the passenger seat is Officer Bell.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer Adams</strong>: Tell Control these guys have automatic weapons! Probably A-Ks!</p>
<p>(Officer Bell doesn't respond. He's just amazed by the car chase.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer Adams</strong>: (shouts) You with me!</p>
<p>(Officer Bell shakes himself out of it and makes the call. Gun shots are fired from the black car in front of them. The windshield from one of the cars smashes from the impact of the bullets.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer Bell</strong>: (to radio) Three-David-34, be advised subjects are firing automatic weapons, possibly AK-47s.</p>
<p>(In the third car are Officer Davis and Sergeant Carroll.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer Davis</strong>: (to radio) All right, we're coming up on a T-intersection. Get ready.</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. Carroll</strong>: Three-boy-seven, pursuit approaching a t-intersection on Jefferson and Third.</p>
<p>(Gunfire continues from the black car in front.) </p>
<p>(Car 2's windshield is hit; glass shatters in the car.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer Bell</strong>: We're going to get killed!</p>
<p><strong>Officer Adams</strong>: Not if you do what you're supposed to do.</p>
<p>(Gunfire continues.)</p>
<p>(The black car hits the side and flips over.) </p>
<p>(Car 2 stops. Both officers get out.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer Bell</strong>: (to radio) Three-David-34, suspect Caprice has T/C'd. Intersection Jefferson and Third.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Adams</strong>: When you get out, keep your head down.</p>
<p>(The two officers open their doors and use it as shield as they prepare for more gunfire.)</p>
<p>(The occupants of the black Caprice crawl out of the overturned car. They're both carrying handguns and open fire immediately.) </p>
<p>(Behind them, a second officer car arrives. Officers Davis and Carroll immediately open their doors and use it as shields and return fire.)</p>
<p>(The gunmen from the car crawl out and fire to get to cover behind the overturned Caprice.) </p>
<p>(It's complete chaos as gunfire is fired from both sides. Bullets are everywhere - sides of cars, windows, tires - richoceting off metal bins.) </p>
<p>(Brass and Sofia's car arrives. Sofia gets out of the car and starts firing.) </p>
<p>(Gunfire continues between the cops and the gunmen.) </p>
<p>(Brass gets out of his car and starts firing from behind the car door.) </p>
<p>(A bullet hits one of the officer car's tires and flattens.) </p>
<p>(A gunman in the blank tank top, Salvator &quot;Stuckey&quot; Rosario, stops to change cartridge.) </p>
<p>(Gunfire continues.) </p>
<p>(Salvator Rosario puts his gun aside. He intends to run for it.) </p>
<p><strong>Salvator Rosario</strong>: Guys! Go! Go!</p>
<p>(Rosario uses the automatic weapon and fires at the officers.) </p>
<p>(He tosses the rifle aside when he runs out of bullets.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer Adams</strong>: They're out of rifle ammo!</p>
<p>(Rosario takes out a handgun. An officer sees him and shouts out a warning.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: (o.s.) No! Get down! They've got more!</p>
<p>(Rosario fires.)</p>
<p>(Brass returns fire.)</p>
<p>(We hear the pinging of bullets off metal.)</p>
<p>(Officer Bell stands up to fire and is hit with a bullet square in his chest. He falls backward and hits the ground. We see he's bleeding from his neck) </p>
<p>(Salvator Rosario stands up to run. Leandro Chavez follows. A shot is fired and he is shot in the thigh. He falls to the ground.) </p>
<p>(Salvator Rosario takes off running up a resident's front drive.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: They're running. I'm going left. You go right. Going to take these guys. You guys, move on up. </p>
<p>(Brass moves forward to provide cover as Officer Adams checks on Officer Bell. The other officers scramble to chase after the running gunmen.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: (to radio) Three-boy-seven in foot pursuit of two male Latinos. One east, one west on Third Street. Requesting backup.</p>
<p>(Officers chase after the gunman. Salvator Rosario jumps over a wall.) </p>
<p>(Officer Adams calls for assistance.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer Adams</strong>: Three- David-34, officer down. Requesting immediate backup and paramedics. (to Sofia) I'll take care of it. I'll stay with him.</p>
<p>(Brass and Sofia both leave to help pursue the gunmen.) </p>
<p>(Additional backup arrives.) </p>
<p>(Sofia runs up to Leandro Chavez, who was shot. She stands over him, her gun on him. She kicks his gun out of his reach.) </p>
<p>(A neighbor steps out into his yard and looks over at Brass.)</p>
<p><strong>Neighbor</strong>: Que paso?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Nada. Haciente. Adentro, adentro.</p>
<p>(A second officer approaches Sofia.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Cuff him.</p>
<p>(The officer takes out his handcuffs to cuff the man in the white tank. Sofia turns and starts running to help catch the other gunman.) </p>
<p><strong>Leandro Chavez</strong>: Dame una ambulancia, puey.</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: I don't speak Spanish.</p>
<p>(Sofia runs to help Officer Davis as they head to the west of the alley behind Third.) </p>
<p>(Brass rushes alongside the building to the east of the alley behind Third, his gun in hand. He reaches the back of the building.) </p>
<p>(He hears a noise and whirls around. He sees a woman open the door and step outside. He motions for her to get back inside.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (to the woman) Back inside, back inside.</p>
<p>(In the distance, gunshots are fired. Brass makes his way toward the sound.) </p>
<p>VARIOUS FLASHES OF:</p>
<p>(Officer Davis and the gunman exchanging gunfire as the gunman tries to escape down the alley.) </p>
<p>(Officer Davis runs out of bullets, his gun clicking.)</p>
<p>(Salvator Rosario turns around and steps closer to the officer to fire. Sofia turns the corner and sees the gunman. She fires several shots, hitting the gunman in the shoulder.) </p>
<p>(Salvator Rosario goes down.) </p>
<p>(They both approach the gunman.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Davis</strong>: Yeah. You?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(Officer Davis reaches the gunman first. He picks up the gun.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: What are you doing? Put it down.</p>
<p>(He puts the gun back down on the ground.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer Davis</strong>: Yeah, sorry. I was just trying to secure his gun.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: He's not going to use it anymore.</p>
<p>(Meanwhile, the third gunman, Ricardo Estevez, is near the top of a fence when Officer Carroll turns the corner and stops him.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer Carroll</strong>: Stop! Police! Stop! Police!</p>
<p>(Ricardo Estevez jumps back down to the ground, his hands raised high above his head.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer Carroll</strong>: Don't move! Don't move!</p>
<p>(Officer Carroll hears a sound behind him and turns to look. Brass rounds the corner, his gun raised.)</p>
<p>(Ricardo Estevez suddenly finds himself with a gun in his hands.)</p>
<p>(Someone fires and hits Ricardo Estevez several times in the chest.) </p>
<p>(Officer Carroll steps forward. Brass kicks the gun off to the side.) </p>
<p>(Brass takes out his radio.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: (from radio) Brass, suspect's in custody.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (to radio) Copy. Control, this is Brass. Situation here is code 4. We have three suspects in custody. One is on the run.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. STREET (MAIN CRIME SCENE) -- JEFFERSON AND THIRD - DAY]</p>
<p>(The ambulance pulls away. Grissom and Catherine approach the scene.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You know it's going to be a long shift when you get the call to respond to a command post.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah. (to phone) Warrick ... we need everyone from grave. But park on Wall Street. Jefferson's taped off all the way back to Lincoln.</p>
<p><strong>Vartann</strong>: The suspect was last seen running south.</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: These buildings have been searched and cleared.</p>
<p><strong>Vartann</strong>: Okay, move south one block. Check each apartment. This guy's armed and dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>Cavaliere</strong>: You got a lot of witnesses claiming to have seen what happened.</p>
<p><strong>Vartann</strong>: Okay, good. Let's get some vans down here, bring them all to the station.</p>
<p>(They walk over to Sofia and Brass leaning up against the SWAT van.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What happened out here?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I was one of the shooters. So was Sofia, so you know the deal. That's really all I'm allowed to say.</p>
<p>(Brass notices Detective Nestor Ortega standing nearby.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I see, uh, Detective Ortega, that hard-head from IA, is handling the case. Just our luck. </p>
<p>(Vartann joins them.) </p>
<p><strong>Vartann</strong>: Caprice full of shooters opened up on two of our guys. One's down.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Is Bell going to make it?</p>
<p><strong>Vartann</strong>: (shakes his head) He's DOA. Three suspects are dead. Fourth outstanding.</p>
<p><strong>Nestor Ortega</strong>: (interrupts) Excuse me ... guys, hang tight. I'm going to get some rides. Take you down to the station, okay? I want to get your statements.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah ... yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nestor Ortega</strong>: Good, good. Excuse me.</p>
<p>(Ortega leaves.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (quietly to Grissom) I'll stay with them. I'll collect their firearms and ammo.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: All right. (to Brass) Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>(Grissom walks past Brass and Sofia. He walks past an officer standing nearby.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: (under his breath) Hell of a day, man.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's just beginning.</p>
<p>FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. STREET -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Detective Chris Cavaliere rushes down the street with the gun in his hand in pursuit of the final gunman. He turns the corner and sees the body on the street. The other officers rush forward.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: GSW victim matches the suspect.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Cavaliere</strong>: You shoot him?</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: No, sir. Found him this way.</p>
<p>(Detective Cavaliere notices the bike strap still around the kid's ankle.) </p>
<p><strong>Chris Cavaliere</strong>: Bike strap ... this isn't our suspect. This is a kid on his way to school. Where's his bike?</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: There was no bike.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Cavaliere</strong>: Put out a broadcast. Suspect may be on a bicycle. (to radio)<br />
We need medical transport. Code three ...</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. STREET (MAIN CRIME SCENE) -- JEFFERSON AND THIRD - DAY]</p>
<p>(Grissom hands out instructions.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Okay, everybody around here has got a video camera or a cell phone camera. They'll all be taking pictures.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I think we all know how to operate in front of a camera.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Don't be caught picking your nose.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Catherine's back at the station collecting the officers' guns. This is the main crime scene. So Nick, you and Sara take this. There's two additional crime scenes down the alleys behind Third. Warrick, you take the west alley, I'll take the east.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: And what do I get to do? Go back to the lab and wait for a phone call?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This is a running gun battle that started twenty blocks back. You get that.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: That's got to be, like, a mile? Who's with me?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: A bunch of pissed-off locals with shot-up cars. </p>
<p>(Sara picks up her kit.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Awesome.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You'll be all right.</p>
<p>(They all pick up their kits and head in the direction of their assignments.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. ALLEY BEHIND THIRD (EAST) - DAY]</p>
<p>(Grissom arrives at the alley and puts his kit down. David Phillips is already there with the body. The coroner and an officer stand nearby.) </p>
<p>(Grissom puts evidence marker #12 down next to the bullet casing and snaps a photo.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Grissom? </p>
<p>(Grissom picks up his kit and moves to the next casing.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Heard anything about Bell?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He died, David. </p>
<p>(Grissom puts his kit down and puts evidence marker #13 next to the gun.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to the officer) Is this gun in its original position?</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: The arresting officers kicked it clear of the suspect.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Ricardo Estevez and standing in front of the fence is holding a gun in his hand. He's shot several times and drops the gun. Brass kicks the gun aside.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Nobody's touched it since I've been here.</p>
<p>(Grissom snaps a couple of photos.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Well, there's no bullet holes in the back. That's always good.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How many times was he hit?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: I don't know. Officer, can you remove these handcuffs?</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p>(The officer steps forward to remove the handcuffs. Grissom picks up the gun and looks at it. He removes the gun's cartridge.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: (to David Phillips) You have anything I can wipe these off with?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(David hands the officer something.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>(The officer stands up and walks over to the side. Grissom gets up and walks over to David Phillips, who is rolling the body over.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Looks like three went in.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: All right, leave him here, David. Warrick's DB's in the other alley just over there.</p>
<p>(Grissom looks up and sees a couple of people peering through their second floor window from a building nearby.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Sofia sits in the hallway chair, nervously wringing her hands together. Brass enters at the end of the hallway and sees her. He walks over to her.) </p>
<p>(Undersheriff McKeen intercepts Brass.) </p>
<p><strong>Undersheriff McKeen</strong>: You did a hell of good job out there.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, not good enough. Has Bell's wife been notified?</p>
<p><strong>Undersheriff McKeen</strong>: The sheriff's on his way to the house now.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know, she's pregnant with their third kid.</p>
<p><strong>Undersheriff McKeen</strong>: We all know the risks.</p>
<p>(Undersheriff McKeen leaves. Brass walks over to Sofia.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hey ...</p>
<p>(He sits down next to her and sighs.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (softly) I remember my first shooting ...</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: (interrupts) I appreciate the sentiment. We're not supposed to talk to each other till we give our statements.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You're right, you're right.</p>
<p>(An officer walking down the hall points to Brass.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: You're up. Curtis, make yourself comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(Brass stands up.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(Detective Ortega turns the tape recorder on and puts it in the middle of the table. Catherine is in the room as they interview Brass.) </p>
<p><strong>Nestor Ortega</strong>: This is Detective Nestor Ortega. I am in PD interrogation taking a statement from Captain James Brass regarding the officer-involved shooting that occurred around 0643 hours this morning. CSI Catherine Willows is present to document and collect Captain Brass's firearm as evidence.</p>
<p>(Brass puts his gun on the table. Detective Ortega pushes the tape recorder forward.) </p>
<p><strong>Nestor Ortega</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nestor Ortega</strong>: You're not a patrol unit. Why did you get involved in the pursuit?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Detective Curtis and I were just closing a robbery case and, uh, we stopped for a bite to eat.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [HOT DOG VENDOR - DAY] Sofia and Brass are getting their hot dogs when they hear the dispatch on the radio.) </p>
<p><strong>Dispatcher</strong>: ... All units in the vicinity. Three- David-34 is in pursuit of a dark Chevy Caprice southbound of Paradise toward Desert Springs.</p>
<p>(Brass looks around.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: That's right near here.</p>
<p>(They run to their car and get in.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We joined the pursuit on Desert Springs.</p>
<p><strong>Nestor Ortega</strong>: So you elected to back up the officers.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Nestor Ortega</strong>: Were the suspects shooting at the time?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Could you tell the types of firearms they were using?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [THE CAR CHASE] Gunfire erupts from the dark Caprice in front of them. End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, the two guys in the back had rifles, maybe AK's. The other two had handguns. I'm not sure what type.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) -- DAY]</p>
<p>(A news helicopter flies overhead.) </p>
<p><strong>Reporter</strong>: (V.O.) We're flying over Third Street where just this morning police were involved in a deadly shootout.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. STREET (MAIN CRIME SCENE) -- JEFFERSON AND THIRD - DAY]</p>
<p>(Sara and Nick are putting plastic rods in the bullet holes of one of the police cars, C9538.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Looks like a porcupine.</p>

<p><strong>Dispatcher (woman)</strong>: Okay, the first communication I received from three- David-34 was at 06:43:37.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Bell</strong>: (from recording) This is three- David-34 requesting immediate backup. New suspect vehicle Adam- Robert- Charlie-208, Nevada, dark Chevy Caprice, four suspects. Suspects are armed.</p>
<p><strong>Dispatcher (woman)</strong>: (from recording) Copy, three-David-34.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What did Bell mean by &quot;new suspect vehicle&quot;? Can you take it back to the last communication before that call?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Bell</strong>: (from recording) Control, this is three-David-34. We'll be 487, twelve thousand block of Roosevelt on David-Nora-Charlie-130, Buick Regal.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(Catherine and Detective Ortega interview Sergeant Adams.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: A 487 is a traffic stop. You were pulling over a Buick?</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. Adams</strong>: That's correct.</p>
<p><strong>Nestor Ortega</strong>: Why'd you leave the Buick and start following the Caprice?</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. Adams</strong>: Didn't leave the Buick. The Caprice cut in.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The dark Caprice cuts in between the officer car and the Buick they're following. End of flashback.)</p>
<p><strong>Nestor Ortega</strong>: Why'd he do that?</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. Adams</strong>: Don't know. The next thing I know, we were taking fire. Forgot all about the Buick.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Did you see where it went?</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. Adams</strong>: I was kind of busy.</p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>

<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[EXT. STREET -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Greg is still processing the street, evidence markers litter the roadway. Grissom walks up to him.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hey! You done yet?</p>
<p>(Greg turns around and stands up.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Grissom! Am I on overtime? </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Did everyone else go home?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No. No.</p>
<p>(Grissom looks down at the road with the bullet casings.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, I finished about ten blocks so far. That's 98 cartridge cases. Let's see, double-L, 86, that's, uh, 38 bullet impacts.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Good. Pursuit started ten blocks farther down. You're halfway done.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I've got like three or four hours more work left. Can I have some help?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Everybody's busy. I think you missed one.</p>
<p>(Greg sighs and walks away.) </p>
<p>(Grissom notices that on the side of the road is a shiny hubcap.) </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The dark Caprice travels down the road and loses a hubcap. End of flashback.) </p>
<p>(Grissom's phone rings; he answers it.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Grissom.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey. I just interviewed Sergeant Adams. He and Bell were making a routine traffic stop when the Caprice cut in. </p>
<p>(Grissom walks over to the hubcap and notices the Buick logo in the center of it.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The initial vehicle was a ...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (interrupts) A Buick?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I hate it when you do that.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Lucky guess. I'll call you back.</p>
<p>(Grissom hangs up and makes his way back to Greg.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: How'd you know that hubcap was connected to the case?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm a trained observer, Greg.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: No, really. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How long do you think a perfectly good hubcap like this would sit around out here? There's a freeway on-ramp about two blocks away. Check and see if there's any traffic cams between here and there.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: You know, you scare me sometimes. It's kind of freaky. You ever bet on the ponies?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I prefer poker. Horses are hard to control. (Greg nods.) Make sure you document these skid marks.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (snickers) He said &quot;skid marks.&quot; </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - BALLISTICS LAB - DAY]</p>
<p>(Nick is test firing the guns.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Oh-ho-ho! Yeah! That's what I'm talking about.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I got over firing AK's a long time ago.</p>
<p>(Warrick looks at the revolver.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey ... mustache boy, come over here and check this out.</p>
<p>(Nick walks over. Warrick opens the gun and shows him the jammed bullet.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Get a load of that.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Whoa. What are the chances of that happening?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Like one in a million.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [BACK ALLEY] Officer Davis fires. The bullet leaves his gun and hits Salvator Rosario's gun right as he's about to fire. End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: The bullet jammed this cylinder. You know, I couldn't clear this gun at the scene. I should've noticed these bullet fragments. I guess I got distracted.</p>
<p>(Nick goes back to get the bullet he test fired out of the water bin.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, the bullet had to come from Officer Davis's pistol ... but if you're the suspect, don't you know your gun's getting hit?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I think it would have felt like a normal recoil. Besides, it was like the wild west out there.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You don't have to tell me; I know it was crazy out there. You know, I pulled 78 bullets out of one car. Davis just got lucky.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: This suspect had one live round left. It saved Davis's life.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, there you go. Proves he was pointing the gun at the officer. See you in court; stroke one up for the good guys.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We still have to place it in Rosario's hand.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY - DAY]</p>
<p>(Grissom walks out of forensic autopsy and down the hallway. He walks past Salvator &quot;Stuckey&quot; Rosario's mother and brother sitting in the hallway. Mrs. Rosario looks up as he walks by, but Grissom doesn't notice her. Undersheriff McKeen and Tracy Bell walk up to Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Undersheriff McKeen</strong>: This is, uh, Gil Grissom from the Crime Lab. This is Officer Bell's wife.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mrs. Bell, I'm so sorry about the loss of your husband -- he was a fine man.</p>
<p>(Mrs. Rosario sobs loudly.) </p>
<p><strong>Tracy Bell</strong>: Why are they crying?</p>
<p><strong>Undersheriff McKeen</strong>: Um, why don't I drive you home.</p>
<p><strong>Tracy Bell</strong>: They're crying for the man that killed my husband.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Rosario</strong>: What did you say?</p>
<p><strong>Tracy Bell</strong>: You heard me. (McKeen leads Mrs. Bell toward the door.) If you did a better job of raising your son, I wouldn't be here.</p>
<p>(Mrs. Rosario surges to her feet. Her son holds her back.) </p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Rosario</strong>: Don't you tell me how to raise my children!</p>
<p><strong>Tracy Bell</strong>: You should be ashamed!</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: (shouts) (in Spanish) </p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Rosario</strong>: How dare you! (screams) How dare you!</p>
<p>(McKeen leads Tracy Bell out of the hallway.) </p>

[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Grissom walks in putting on a pair of gloves. Warrick is already inside.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You run the gauntlet?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah. Ferro-tracing his hands?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah. I'm trying to prove Rosario here held the gun.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Good old pyridyiphenyl triazine.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'm hoping this stuff reacts to the traces of iron that may have been left on his skin. It'll further refute any argument that the gun was a plant.</p>
<p>(Warrick sprays the shooter's right hand.)</p>
<p>(Quick CGI to: The spray reacts to something on the hand and a black mark appears on his palm. End of CGI.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That could be the back strap of a gun.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah. That would do it.</p>
<p>(Warrick snaps a photo of the mark on the hand.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Det. Cavaliere walks through the hallway when he's stopped by an officer.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Detective, do you have a moment?</p>
<p><strong>Chris Cavaliere</strong>: Uh, yeah, I'm kind of busy -- what is it?</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: I picked up a junkie for possession, outside a fleabag motel off Fremont.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Cavaliere</strong>: And what?</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: And ... last night, he spotted your shooter.</p>
<p>(Cavaliere turns and looks at the handcuffed man sitting on the waiting room chairs.) </p>
<p><strong>Chris Cavaliere</strong>: Let's talk to him.</p>
<p>(He walks up to the junkie and shows him the photo of the suspect, Jose Fausto.) </p>
<p><strong>Chris Cavaliere</strong>: You know this guy?</p>
<p><strong>Junkie</strong>: What if I do? What'll it get me?</p>
<p><strong>Chris Cavaliere</strong>: He's a cop killer. Gets you nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Junkie</strong>: Hey, no need to get hostile.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Cavaliere</strong>: Hey, man, you don't know what hostile is.</p>
<p><strong>Junkie</strong>: Will it at least get me a ride home?</p>
<p><strong>Chris Cavaliere</strong>: Come on ...</p>
<p><strong>Junkie</strong>: Okay, okay. I-I do a lot of business at the Lucky Seven Motel. And that guy checked in last night. He scored a little something to help get him some sleep. But he didn't pay. He just flashed his piece.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Cavaliere</strong>: Nine-millimeter?</p>
<p><strong>Junkie</strong>: Yeah. He wanted a ... a girl, and I gave him a number. That dude's bad news. I want to give him to you.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY - DAY]</p>
<p>(Grissom walks in as Robbins finishes Officer Bell.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Glad you're here. I'd like to get this one off my table. Found a rather large contusion the left chest just below the nipple.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, that location is consistent with the bullet Catherine found embedded in his vest.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: It's like getting kicked by a mule. You'll want to see this. Through-and-through. (He sticks a rod through the bullet hole in Officer Bell's neck.) Entrance wound just below his left ear, exited below and to the front of his right ear, severing the right common carotid.</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: Officer Bell is shot in the neck. The bullet goes through the flesh, severs the artery and out through the other side. End of flash.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: That's your COD. Fortunately, he never felt a thing.</p>
<p>(Grissom stops as he thinks about it.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Left to right, back to front.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Only cops were shooting in that direction.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Are you saying Bell was hit by friendly fire?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Maybe not so friendly.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />

<p>[EXT MOTEL - DAY]</p>
<p>(The hooker exits the motel room and shuts the door behind her. She leaves the room with money in her hand.)</p>
<p>(As she nears the end of the walkway, she's grabbed and pulled off to the side.) </p>
<p><strong>Chris Cavaliere</strong>: Who's in the room?</p>
<p><strong>Hooker</strong>: Some john, I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Cavaliere</strong>: Shh!</p>
<p>(He shows her a photo of Jose Fausto.) </p>
<p><strong>Chris Cavaliere</strong>: Is that him?</p>
<p><strong>Hooker</strong>: Mm-hmm. I couldn't wait to get out of there. He was acting real nervous. (She sees SWAT coming up the stairs.) Now I know why. I took care of him; he's asleep. So you're not gonna bust me, right?</p>
<p><strong>Vartann</strong>: Get her out of here.</p>
<p>(The hooker is led down the stairs.) </p>
<p>[INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(The door bursts open. Jose Fausto is on the bed. He jumps to his feet.) </p>
<p><strong>SWAT</strong>: Police! Let me see your hands! Do it now! Get on the floor! Down!</p>
<p>(Jose Fausto gets down on his knees, his hands behind his head. Vartann cuffs him.) </p>
<p>(The SWAT officer checks to see that they have the right man.) </p>
<p><strong>SWAT</strong>: That's our guy.</p>
<p>(Warrick walks into the room. He pockets his gun and picks up the gun on the counter. He checks it.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: He's carrying a nine.</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: (o.s.) All clear, sir.</p>
<p>(Warrick looks at the bullet from the gun.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We'll run this gun against the cartridge case from that poor kid on the bike.</p>
<p>(He notices the bike in the room.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'm guessing you didn't save up for that one, huh?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Fausto runs out into the street, sees Geraldo on his bike and shoots him twice in the back. End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Vartann</strong>: You shoot an innocent kid in the back just to take his bike? You piece of crap! Get up!</p>
<p>(Vartann pulls Fausto to his feet.) </p>
<p><strong>Chris Cavaliere</strong>: Hey, you're gonna wish you kept running. They hate cop killers in Vegas, you hear me? Huh?</p>
<p><strong>Jose Fausto</strong>: Come on, let me get dressed up first, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Chris Cavaliere</strong>: We got a jumpsuit just your size, don't worry.</p>
<p>(They lead him out of the room.) </p>
<p>[EXT. MOTEL - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>

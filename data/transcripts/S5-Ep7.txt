<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT] </p>
<p>[EXTREME CLOSE-UP]</p>
<p>(Camera view of the tight weave of material. Camera pulls out and we see a tie. Camera pulls out even more and we see ... </p>
<p>[GRISSOM]</p>
<p>(Grissom stands in front of the mirror trying to put on his bow tie. We watch him struggle with it for a moment.)</p>
<p>[INT. BALLROOM LOBBY - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Through the mirror's reflection, we see Catherine walk over to him.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p>(Grissom picks up the step-by-step illustrated instruction sheet for how to tie his tie.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (frustrated) I'm going insane. I don't understand this diagram.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (sighs and shakes her head) You don't need a diagram. </p>
<p>(Grissom starts fiddling with his tie again.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You need a woman. </p>
<p>(From behind, Catherine takes over and ties Grissom's tie for him.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm looking forward to your speech.</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Rory Atwater</strong>: (o.s.) ... it wasn't greatly appreciated at the time.</p>
<p>(The audience chuckles and applauds.) </p>
<p>[INT. HOTEL - MAIN BALLROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Sheriff Rory Atwater is at the podium concluding his speech. He toasts Robert Covallo who is sitting at the table. We also note that Sofia Curtis is sitting next to him.) </p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Rory Atwater</strong>: But what I think A.D. Covallo will enjoy the most is no longer having to lie about how much work he has to do. Enjoy your retirement, Bob. </p>
<p>(He looks down and we note that Grissom is busy writing something on a dinner napkin.) </p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Rory Atwater</strong>: But seriously, folks ... appointing the new Assistant Director for the Crime Lab is not a task I take lightly. I believe in promoting from within. I believe in rewarding years of dedication and devotion to this department. I believe in Conrad Ecklie. </p>
<p>(The audience applauds. Conrad Ecklie sits at the same table near Grissom.) </p>
<p>(Conrad Ecklie nods and smiles at the audience. Grissom's pager beeps.) </p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Rory Atwater</strong>: For a proper introduction, I'd like to turn to his good friend and colleague of many years ...</p>
<p>(Grissom checks his pager.)</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Rory Atwater</strong>: ... Supervisor Gil Grissom.</p>
<p>(The audience applauds. Catherine glances at Grissom who is reading his pager.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Gil ...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I got a 419.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Don't even think about it.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Swing's tapped out. I'm the back-up. (Catherine grits her teeth at Grissom. Ecklie watches them. Grissom hands the dinner napkin to Catherine.)<br />
Here ... you give my speech. </p>
<p>(Catherine's eyes widen. Grissom turns to Ecklie and gives him a thumb's up as he gets up to leave the table.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Good luck, Conrad.</p>
<p>(Ecklie watches Grissom leave the table. Grissom turns to Sheriff Rory Atwater on the stage. He points to his pager.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (mouths silently) Homicide</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Rory Atwater</strong>: Gil ...</p>
<p>(Grissom walks quickly out of the ballroom.)</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Rory Atwater</strong>: (to Catherine) What's going on?</p>
<p>(Catherine looks down at the dinner napkin and opens it where she reads: &quot;WHAT CAN I SAY ABOUT CONRAD ECKLIE?&quot;)</p>
<p>(Catherine sighs. Rory Atwater motions to her.) </p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Rory Atwater</strong>: You want to help me out up here?</p>
<p>(Catherine takes a deep breath and stands up.)</p>

[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[INT. OLYMPIA HOTEL/CASINO - LOBBY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Grissom walks into the casino carrying his kit.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Hey, Griss ... what's with the monkey suit?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I was at a funeral across the street.</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: At a casino? My condolences. Scene's in the east penthouse. Gotta use the VIP elevator.</p>
<p>(He hands Grissom the card key.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>(The officer leaves. The elevator bell dings and the doors open. </p>
<p>[INT. OLYMPIA HOTEL/CASINO - ELEVATOR - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(Grissom steps into the elevator. The slides the card key into the security lock. The doors close.) </p>
<p>(The elevator bell dings and the doors open again. Sofia Curtis walks in. She greets Grissom with familiarity.)</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hello. </p>
<p>(The elevator doors close.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What floor did you want?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Where do you think I'm going?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I wouldn't know.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: You don't recognize me.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Apparently not.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: In the lab, I usually wear my hair up.</p>
<p>(He glances at her, then recognizes her.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Oh, yeah ... You're pulling in when I'm pulling out. </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Sofia Curtis.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: CSI-three, day shift. You work for Ecklie.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: As of tonight, so do you.</p>
<p>(The elevator bell dings and the door opens.)</p>
<p>[INT. OLYMPIA HOTEL - EAST PENTHOUSE - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(They both step out into the penthouse where party guests and officers are. Brass walks up to them. He leads them to the room at the end of the hall.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hey, Gil ... hey, Sofie. Sorry to drag you away from the chicken cordon bleu. It's the McKinley High homecoming. The dance is downstairs, but the cool kids' party is in here.</p>
<p>(He opens the doors and leads them into the rooms.)</p>
<p>[INT. OLYMPIA HOTEL - EAST PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(They look around.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: This place makes the rain man suite at Caesar's look like my condo.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: These rooms are just for whales and royalty. What's up?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We're running down the VIP host -- see who's got it tonight.</p>
<p>(He leads them to another room inside where the body is.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Okay, paramedics pronounced, left the scene undisturbed. Name is Nicole Jensen, 17. Coroner's en route. I'm gonna talk to the MTV generation.</p>
<p>(Brass leaves. Sofia Curtis starts to walk into the room.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Where's your kit?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: I sent a uniform to bring it up.</p>
<p>(She walks around the body and sees the vomit on the floor near her mouth.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Teenager abuses drugs and/or booze ... (she kneels down and looks at Grissom who is also kneeling on the other side of the body.) There's a news flash.</p>
<p>(She notes the bruises on the body's neck.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Contusions on her neck.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And the position suggests she was grabbed from behind.</p>
<p>(Sofia glances at the red wrist band: A NIGHT TO REMEMBER.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: (reads) &quot;A night to remember.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: A night to forget.</p>
<p>FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[INT. OLYMPIA HOTEL - EAST PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(David kneels next to the body and writes his notes on a clipboard. </p>
<p>[EXT. OLYMPIA HOTEL - EAST PENTHOUSE - BALCONY -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>Brass exits the room and steps out into the balcony where Grissom and Sofia are. Above them, are sounds of a helicopter leaving.) </p>
<p>(Sofia is changing out of her evening gown and into a pair of overalls. Grissom is removing his tie.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Okay ... so I talked to the VIP host. The room was checked out to Charlie Macklin.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's his casino.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, it's for his daughter, Janelle. She's having an after party with her and her friends.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Oh, off the streets and out of trouble.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Best laid plans.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So what's the daughter's story?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know, I don't know. We haven't seen her yet. We're still looking. </p>
<p>(Grissom and Brass turn and find Sofia in overalls. Brass turns and leaves the balcony. She looks at Grissom, turns and pulls out her evening gown from her overalls.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: I can barely move in this dress and we haven't cleared the bathroom yet, so there it is. Don't worry, I'm wearing underwear. As far as you know.</p>
<p>[INT. OLYMPIA HOTEL - EAST PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(Camera shutter snaps several times as Grissom takes photos of the body.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Liver temp is 97.2. She's been dead less than two hours.</p>
<p>(In the next room, Sofia finds something.)</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Banana peel ... g-string ... (she lifts it up) ... scared of that.</p>
<p>(Grissom turns back to the body.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Ligature marks on both of her wrists. Some kind of adhesive residue, too.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The kidnappers/attackers wrap thick tape around her wrists. End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So, she was bound?</p>
<p>(David turns the body over and notes the bruise on the face.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Marked impression on her left cheek.</p>
<p>(Grissom snaps a photo.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Maybe some sort of circular device pressed against her face?</p>
<p>(In the next room, Sofia snaps photos of the items on the foot table.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: No beer or liquor. Just water, yogurt, and OJ.</p>
<p>(Grissom looks up as Sofia continues to mutter to herself.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Mixers, not for drinks ... maybe for drugs. Right ph in the stomach speeds the buzz. (She looks around the room.) I think there's narco around here somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (loudly) A-a-are you talking to me?</p>
<p>(Sofia snaps more photos of the food table.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Do you always process like this?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Like what?</p>
<p>(She snaps another photo.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: With your mouth.</p>
<p>(She looks at Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Whenever I meet someone new, I always say their name out loud a few times. Keeps a picture in my head.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hm ... I thought that's why we had cameras.</p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
[FLASHBACK]</p>
<p>(Nicole Jensen staggers into the room. She doubles over and vomits on the floor.) </p>
<p><strong>Miranda</strong>: (V.O.) So, Nikki comes running in and starts laughing at the carpet. </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(Brass is interviewing Miranda, one of the party-goers.) </p>
<p><strong>Miranda</strong>: You know, hurling, blowing chunks, vomiting.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I got it, Miranda. I get the picture. I know what it means.</p>
<p><strong>Miranda</strong>: The others came in, and, uh ... someone tried CPR, I guess. Didn't work. We called 911.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, uh, you tight with Nikki?</p>
<p><strong>Miranda</strong>: (scoffs) God, no. Her dad was a freelance limo driver. I mean, you have to have a felony to get that job.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (chuckles) How would you know that?</p>
<p><strong>Miranda</strong>: Everybody knows that. The guy was an ex-kneebreaker for the old mob. You ever see Casino? The movie?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, sure, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Miranda</strong>: Whatever. The guy Joe Pesci played.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Tony &quot;The Ant&quot; Spilotro.</p>
<p><strong>Miranda</strong>: Well, he and Nikki's dad were friends.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Miranda</strong>: In real life. Real lowlifes. That girl was kryptonite to me. I'd be lying if I said any different.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. OLYMPIA HOTEL/CASINO - MAIN FLOOR - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Catherine and Nick walk across the casino floor.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Kids have been going in and out of the suite all night, but the front desk only issued card keys to seven. Brass has five of them upstairs ... (He looks at his notes.) Uh, Janelle Macklin and Sean Paland are unaccounted for, so I'll check the casino.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I thought you were going to process the scene with Grissom.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I was. He said he had it covered. Sofia Curtis is up there with him.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Right ... Ecklie's right hand.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Ever do a case with her?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Uh-uh. Hey, I heard Grissom stuck you with his speech.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: A napkin is not a speech.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. OLYMPIA HOTEL/CASINO - SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Catherine talks with the security officer monitoring the cameras.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm going to need to see everybody who went in or out of the east penthouse since check-in, and that includes stairwells and service entrances.</p>
<p><strong>Kenny</strong>: You know, that's Janelle Macklin's suite.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, I know. Her father owns the casino.</p>
<p><strong>Kenny</strong>: Okay ... </p>
<p>(Kenny works the keyboard to bring up the video.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Dance is still going strong.</p>
<p><strong>Kenny</strong>: That's the beauty of high school in Las Vegas. Homecoming in a casino, dance can go all night.</p>
<p>(Close up of: The dance floor.)</p>

<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. OLYMPIA HOTEL/CASINO - BALLROOM M-4 - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Nick walks in with Sean Paland through the ballroom.) </p>
<p><strong>Sean Paland</strong>: I've been down here dancing for hours. Ask anybody.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Why don't you come over here and talk to me for a second?</p>
<p><strong>Sean Paland</strong>: Come on, man!</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What, you need to tell your date?</p>
<p><strong>Sean Paland</strong>: I came stag.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Come here.</p>
<p><strong>Sean Paland</strong>: If I want a date, I'll get one in there. You know how many couples break up at homecoming? I looked it up. It's like ten percent. It's staggering.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hm ... you hang out with Nikki a lot?</p>
<p><strong>Sean Paland</strong>: Please -- the girl's a scarf. Always hanging on the neck of anyone with loot.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Is that what was she doing up in the P. Diddy suite with your buddies?</p>
<p><strong>Sean Paland</strong>: Guess everybody wanted in on that party. And Nikki wasn't on the list.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Janelle Mackie and a group of kids are in the elevator doors. Nicole Jensen runs up to her as they start to close.) </p>
<p><strong>Nicole Jensen</strong>: Hey, wait, Janelle ... Janelle, wait!</p>
<p>(Janelle turns around.) </p>
<p><strong>Janelle Mackie</strong>: Look, Nikki, it's no big deal. You're not missing anything.</p>
<p><strong>Nicole Jensen</strong>: That's easy for you to say. C'mon, Janelle, we're seniors. This is my last homecoming -- please!</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Sean Paland</strong>: Janelle's always taking in strays.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, Janelle ... do you know where Janelle is now?</p>
<p><strong>Sean Paland</strong>: I have no idea. You know, when I busted outta there, she was still up there chillin' with the rest of them.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Robbins is going over the body as he audio tapes his report.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Standard SAE kit was collected. Physical finding of sexual activity. Unable to determine if consensual or rape. Collected heart blood sample. Preliminary tox indicates psilocybin, MDMA, and THC in the system. </p>
<p>(Flash to: Robbins collects from threads from her nose.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (V.O.) Green-colored fiber was collected from the nasal passages ... </p>
<p>(End of flash. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: ... to be forwarded to trace evidence for analysis. Vomitus mass was found in the throat and lungs and there was petecchial hemorrhaging of the lower eyelids. Preliminary C.O.D. appears to be mechanical asphyxia from aspiration of gastric content as a result of acute drug intoxication. Albert Robbins, M.E., Employee number 228369.</p>
<p>(Robbins removes the recorder from his ear.)</p>

<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. OLYMPIA HOTEL/CASINO - EAST PENTHOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Grissom is in the living room looking at the floor where the body used to be.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Collected seven used condoms from two bedrooms -- not a record in my book.</p>
<p>(Sofia walks into the room and puts her kit down.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Fact that the victim wrists were bound suggests possible s*x games. Also pulled a plastic baggie from a toilet containing what looks like ground-up mushrooms, probably not the kind you put on pizza. Could be the source of the psilocybin. (She looks at Grissom.) One of those kids is still holding. (She closes her kit and stands up.) I'm gonna let Brass know.</p>
<p>(She looks at Grissom who is not paying attention to her.)</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: That time I was talking to you.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What? (Grissom turns.) Sorry. I was, uh, treating it like white noise.</p>
<p>(Grissom looks down at the vomit spatter.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: What are you seeing?</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No. No, the evidence did that.</p>
<p><strong>Sean Paland</strong>: Look, we were playing around. I bus tables every day after school, all right? A grand's a lot of dough for me. You know, this was a joke.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You see us laughing? </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Where's Janelle?</p>
<p><strong>Sean Paland</strong>: I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: When's the last time you saw her?</p>
<p><strong>Sean Paland</strong>: After the kidnapping. Janelle planted one on my lips. You know, to thank me. I felt it was more than that. You know, I felt a vibe. I gave her an hour to chill, then I called her. Asked her if I could bring her anything. She said she was kind of hungry, so I told her I'd bring her something sweet to eat, other than me.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [ROOM 1503] Sean Paland lifts the lid off the food tray. Janelle sits on the bed and giggles. The phone rings.) </p>
<p><strong>Sean Paland</strong>: (V.O.) For a couple seconds, I thought I was in. </p>
<p>(Janelle answers her phone.) </p>
<p><strong>Sean Paland</strong>: (V.O.) Then she got a voice mail ... checked it and flipped out.</p>
<p>(She tosses the food tray in frustration and leaves the room.)</p>
<p>(Sean Paland takes a bite of the toast and tosses it back on the tray.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Sean Paland</strong>: I figured that was my cue to bolt, so I rolled back down to the dance to continue with the honeys I was already working. I haven't seen Janelle since. I swear to god.</p>

<p>(Greg watches as Catherine checks the security video and finds Sean Paland walking back into the elevator.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, there he is, stepping onto the main elevator from the 15th floor. Alone.</p>
<p>(She chuckles as she watches Gunman two working his mirror reflection.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You crack this kid's head open, all that would come out would be T and A.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I think you said that about me once.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Actually, more than once.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: What's the time code?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: 2:04 A.M.</p>
<p>(Greg checks the cell phone log.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: That's right after Janelle Macklin's last call to her voice mail. Just like he said. Let me access the message.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So when are you going to be doing your final proficiency?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Every time I ask Grissom, he says, &quot;next time out.&quot; And then I end up here.</p>
<p>(Catherine smiles.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Okay, here it is.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Macklin</strong>: (from recording) I'm really disappointed with you, Janelle. All these years you spent around me at the casino and you think you can put something like this over on me? The only thing I'm giving you tonight are four little words: Get ... your ... ass ... home.</p>

[INT. CSI - LOUNGE - DAY]</p>
<p>(Catherine, Grissom and Sofia Curtis sit around the table reviewing the information.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And since the surveillance feed was still being time-shifted at that point, my guess is that Janelle took the service elevator out.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: So ... where does that leave us?</p>
<p>(Grissom takes his glasses off.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I think we're done.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No actual crime was committed. The kidnapping wasn't real.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Nicole Jensen's death was plenty real. Janelle Macklin's ultimately responsible for putting into motion the events that led to Nicole's death.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, the broadcast's out on Janelle and her car. When she turns up, she'll have to answer for it.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Well, that's ... (She glances behind her.) ...highly unsatisfying.</p>
<p>(Sofia stands up. She puts Grissom's tie on the table.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: You forgot this at the suite. I fixed it for you. You never know when you might need to get dressed up again.</p>
<p>(Sofia leaves the room; Grissom watches her go. Catherine picks up the tie.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (amused) She glued it.</p>
<p>(Catherine's phone rings.)</p>

<p>(Brass shakes his head.) </p>

<p>(Charlie Macklin meets with Brass.) </p>
<p><strong>Charlie Macklin</strong>: (shocked) She was all worked up, she was crying, saying how someone threw her in the trunk of her car. And then the call cuts off. I thought it was just more drama. This time didn't seem any different from all the others. (He sits back in his chair.) I mean, what kind of kidnapper ... lets you keep your cell phone?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You should let us answer that question.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Macklin</strong>: Where did you find her, Captain?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Sunset Road. Near McCarran.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Macklin</strong>: Janelle loved airplanes when she was a kid. She was always ... begging me to go ... see them take off and land. I took her down there. A couple of times, I think. Her mother is in Paris. That's, uh ... what ... nine hours ahead. Kind of late to call right now.</p>
<p>(A young woman walks into the office.) </p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Macklin</strong>: Oh, my god, Charlie. They told me about Janelle. I'm so sorry, honey.</p>

<p>(Brass takes out a photo of a bracelet.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Found Janelle's bracelet in your car. (He shows the photo to Bobby Jensen.) What do you think something like this is worth? Hundred G's at least. Huh? Enough maybe to help ease the pain?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Jensen</strong>: For you, maybe. I got a call for a pickup. I went. Trying to keep my head in the work, 'cause what else do I have left?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [INT. CAR - NIGHT] Janelle is trying to apologize to Mr. Jensen.) </p>

<p><strong>Bobby Jensen</strong>: I told her I was gonna put two bullets in her head and dump her on her daddy's front step.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: But then what, you decided maybe it'd be more fun to tie her up, let her choke to death in the trunk of her own car?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Jensen</strong>: No. I told her what I felt like doing so her father would know the way I feel. And she got out, and she ran, and it's a good thing she ran, because I might've changed my mind.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Maybe you did.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And the tox came back positive for benzodiazepines.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Yeah, that makes sense. They suppress the gag reflex.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And knock you out at the same time. Girl probably didn't even realize she was suffocating.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Would've been something like falling asleep.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: All right, so ... based on the time that she called her father and the time we found the car, she was in the trunk at least three hours. That's a slow way to go.</p>
<p>(Warrick walks into the lab.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I just got off the phone with Brass.</p>

[EXT. SUNSET PARK (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>(It's a bright, beautiful day at the park. The camera passes by a couple of teenagers walking and holding hands, a family barbeque-ing, a couple of kids with water guns and a group of children running and playing tag.)</p>
<p>(One particular little boy running and being chased by the others in his group, trips and falls on a patch of dirt. He starts screaming immediately. He gets up, holds his hands out in front of him and starts screaming.)</p>
<p><strong>Little Boy</strong>: Mom! Mom! The dirt burned my hand!</p>
<p>(The camera focuses on the little boy's hands as it turns red ... burning his skin.)</p>
<p>FLASH TO WHITE:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. SUNSET PARK -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The little boy's hands are being wrapped. Sirens blip in the background. GRISSOM and SARA appear at the scene carrying their CSI kit. They meet up with BRASS, the three of them making their way toward the body. They walk between the ambulance on the left and the Clark County Fire Department Hazardous Materials' Truck on the right.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What's Hazmat doing here?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Kid's playing tag, takes a header in the dirt ends up with first-degree on his hands.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Wait. We got a call about a dead body.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, I'm getting there. So, Hazmat arrives figuring some sort of chemical spill. Starts removing the toxic soil, and bamm a shovel slams into a shoulder blade.</p>
<p>(BRASS indicates some area off screen and to his right.)</p>
<p>FLASH TO WHITE: SHORT TIME CUT TO:<br />
(The forensic team surrounds the site.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (V.O.) Clothing's been reduced to shreds. Epidermal tissue. Is virtually gone. The body's desiccated.</p>
<p>(The camera starts at the body's legs and feet then moves slowly up toward the head.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Viscous fluid the consistency of dishwashing soap. Hazmat guy was right. Killer doused the body in lye. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Must have thought it would destroy the body.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Without the wait.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<hr />
[EXT. SUNSET PARK -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(SARA is standing in the grave site with the body. Dispatcher noise can be heard in the background.)</p>
<p><strong>HazMat</strong>: Ma'am, I'm sorry, but I need to neutralize the soil.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: If you touch the soil you're going to contaminate my crime scene, but I'll let you know when I'm finished.</p>
<p><strong>HazMat</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(The Hazmat man leaves, GRISSOM approaches SARA. He crouches down toward her.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What'd you get?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Vic's wallet, what's left of it. It's a Nevada License. Bob Martin. 31. He lived downtown. There's 20 bucks in the flap. Rules out robbery.</p>
<p>(SARA is holding a wallet in her hands with the following Nevada Driver's License information showing: )</p>
<p>283264064711?<br />
(name) BOB MARTIN<br />
(address) 45?? ??? MATRIA LAS VEGAS NV 89108<br />
NONE<br />
(weight) 175<br />
BRN</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks around the grave site and notices shiny white flecks. SARA picks up a sample for a closer look.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Look at this.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Looks like a paint fleck or metal chip, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What'd the ranger say?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Nobody saw anything suspicious. Park closes up at 10 p.m. No security, minimal lighting. Basically, a pretty good place to dump a body.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY]</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: You found this guy in the park?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Actually, Hazmat found him.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Well, that explains the postmortem scar tissue. Lye had a field day on his flesh.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to powdery lye being poured over the dead body lying on the ground in a cloud of dust. Camera close up of the dead body's head and its burning flesh. Flash to white. Resume on SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Time of death?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Approximately 24 hours ago. Tell me about the car.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Car? What car?</p>
<p>(ROBBINS pulls the sheet covering the lower body aside to expose the legs. He points to the wounds in the knees.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Comminuted fractures of the proximal tib-fib. Both legs. Bumper hits right below the knees. Sure sign he was hit by a car.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to car headlights on a pair of legs standing in the middle of the road. Cut to side view of the impact of the car on the legs. Flash to white. Resume on present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Look at all the bruising. If he was struck and killed, ecchymosis would be nonexistent.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Which suggests he survived the impact. Usual injuries. Ruptured patellar tendon, laceration of the saphenous vein and multiple incised wounds containing slivers of glass ... </p>
<p>(ROBBINS picks up a piece of glass from the dead body's cheek. He puts it aside.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: ... which I will send over to trace and bruise legs, arms and chest. What I didn't find was arterial lacerations or underlying vessel damage.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Just confirms death wasn't immediate?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Correct. Victim was like a leaky water balloon. Heart slowly pumped blood right out of his body and based on the coloration of the bruises, trauma was sustained approximately 48 hours before death. Three days ago, this man was injured. He bled out until he died yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We didn't find any blood.</p>
<p>(Camera holds on GRISSOM.)</p>

[EXT. LAS VEGAS DESERT - DIABLO CANYON -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(NICK arrives at the site and walks toward the crime scene. He's carrying his CSI kit and is met up by DET. LOCKWOOD.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Lockwood.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Lockwood</strong>: Hey, Stokes.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Who called it in?</p>
<p><strong>Det. Lockwood</strong>: BLM chopper pilot. They always buzz diablo canyon looking for hikers in distress. Or worse.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: He see anyone else in the vicinity?</p>
<p><strong>Det. Lockwood</strong>: No, just the vic: Stacy Warner, 26. Las Vegas resident. I scanned for a missing persons on her. Nothing.</p>
<p>(They arrive at the site where a woman lies dead on the ground.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No tire treads. Whose are these?</p>
<p><strong>Det. Lockwood</strong>: Paramedics and mine. Same path. Walked straight in, straight out.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Engagement ring, no wedding band.</p>
<p>(NICK puts his kit down and reaches out to brush the hair on the woman's forehead aside. He notes the wounds on the woman's right cheek. He opens her right eye lid to look at her pupils.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Orbital bone looks fractured.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Lockwood</strong>: Could have lost her footing and hit her head.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Could've. Hold that for me?</p>
<p>(NICK hands his flashlight to the Detective beside him. He pulls out forceps to take a sample of some fibers found at the left corner of the woman's mouth. He holds it up to look at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Down feather.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Lockwood</strong>: But she's not wearing a jacket.</p>
<p>(NICK takes the sample. He notices something else.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Shine that right here.</p>
<p>(DET. LOCKWOOD continues to hold the flashlight. From the woman's ear, he finds a larvae. He puts it in a plastic container.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Grissom should enjoy this. Hey, Lockwood you got any food in your vehicle? Hamburger, anything like that?</p>
<p><strong>Det. Lockwood</strong>: Gum, sugar-free.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No, gum'll kill him. I'll stop at the first place I see pick up some jerky. </p>
<p>(NICK caps the container and pulls out a second container and hands it to DET. LOCKWOOD.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Will you get me a sample of the ground underneath the body?</p>
<p><strong>Det. Lockwood</strong>: Soon as the coroner moves her.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Good.</p>
<p>(NICK picks up his case and leaves the scene. DET. LOCKWOOD follows.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. REED COLLINS' RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(REED COLLINS stands in front of the large screen television set. A baseball game is playing on screen. He turns around.)</p>
<p><strong>Reed Collins</strong>: Bob is dead?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: His body was found at Sunset Park. His license gave this address.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Are you his domestic partner?</p>
<p><strong>Reed Collins</strong>: We're roommates. I got divorced last year. And about six months ago, Bob's wife kicked him out. He needed a place to crash and I needed help with the mortgage. He's two months late on the rent. How do I go about collecting under the circumstances? </p>
<p>(SARA doesn't say anything. She turns to look at BRASS. BRASS turns to look at REED COLLINS who clarifies.)</p>
<p><strong>Reed Collins</strong>: Look, we were roommates. We weren't really friends.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: When was the last time you saw him?</p>
<p><strong>Reed Collins</strong>: We both work at the Tangiers. He managed the restaurant, and I work in maintenance. Last monday we drove in together.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: But you didn't drive home together?</p>
<p><strong>Reed Collins</strong>: Mondays? No. After shift, he'd walk over to the university. He's an amateur photographer. Take the bus home.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: But he didn't come home Monday night ...</p>
<p><strong>Reed Collins</strong>: I didn't think much of it. He's always going back and forth with Charlotte. His wife. What do I care? As long as the rent's paid.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. UNIVERSITY - PHOTOGRAPHY BUILDING -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Standing at the side of the road outside the Photography Building at the University, GRISSOM looks around. He sees the bus stop across the street. SARA approaches from behind. She's carrying a stack of photographs.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Photo department kept a log. Bob Martin reserved a darkroom on Mondays from 10:00 to 11:00 P.M. He was logged in Monday night.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Good. We got a bus to catch.</p>
<p>(Taking a-hold of her elbow, GRISSOM guides SARA across the street. SARA is still looking through the photographs. A car beeps its horn as it rushes by them. They stop, startled. They continue across the road. SARA looks through the photos.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: He left these photos behind. They're all of the same woman. I bet it's his wife.</p>
<p>(The photos are of a dark-haired woman. While crossing the street, GRISSOM notices silver flecks on the road. He reaches down and shines his flashlight down the road. SARA notices it also. GRISSOM reaches down and picks one up to look more closely at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Silver flecks ... like the one you found with the body.</p>
<p>(SARA reaches down and notice something. She picks it up.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I got a piece of plastic. Looks like a headlight cover, maybe. This could be our crime scene.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to BOB MARTIN crossing the same roadway while holding a stack of photographs much in the same manner that SARA had. As he crosses, a car speeds by and makes contact with BOB MARTIN. BOB MARTIN flies up and hits the windshield. Flash to white. Resume on SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Assuming this was a hit-and-run how does a guy with two broken legs end up on the other side of town buried in a park, covered in lye?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM doesn't answer her. He looks around.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What are you looking for? </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No sign of blood. No evidence of a cleanup. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: If this is our crime scene then somewhere between here and Sunset Park, Bob Martin lost eight to ten pints of blood.</p>
<p>(SARA looks around and shakes her head.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Where is it?</p>

[INT. CSI - GREG'S LAB -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM enters.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So do want to tell me about the silver flecks I found? Paint chips?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Aluminum and melamine in the color coat indicate that it's car paint. Factory job. Uh, body shop paint contains styrene, not melamine.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mm, what type of car </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Trick question. Paint won't tell me that. But I do have an answer. It's not technically part of my job description but as you know, I'm always eager to expand my responsibilities. Take a look down the scope.</p>
<p>(Through the microscope, we see the piece of glass SARA picked up from the roadway. The magnification increases and we now see the cross hairs on the plastic.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Looks like some sort of insignia.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Crosshairs. That's the plastic you collected at the accident site. Now that mark is only found on the S-Class Mercedes. It's all about branding. Now knowing that the headlight came from a Mercedes, I was able to compare the infrared spectra with the paint spectra supplied by the manufacturer. Check this out.</p>
<p>(GREG hands GRISSOM the test results.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Your vehicle was painted Sarasota Silver. Also, only available on the S-Series '99 models. I checked with the Mercedes State Rep. Five were sold in Nevada. Sara's tracking down the owners.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You've, uh, already shared this information with Sara?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yeah, an hour ago. And she was way more fascinated than you are.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, I'm somewhat fascinated by the fact that I'm your boss, but you talked to her first.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, you were at dinner.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I've been in the lab all day, Greg.</p>
<p>(Camera holds on GREG.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - LAB/HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM leaves GREG and exits the lab to the hallway where he promptly meets up with SARA. GRISSOM is still holding his file.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I've been looking for you.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, it's hard to see me if you and Greg are out ahead of me.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Oh, uh, sorry about that but Brass got me a list of those Mercedes owners. One moved to Los Angeles, three are over 50. My guess, they would have stopped and rendered aid. Brass is checking them out which leaves a Ben Weston, 25. Leased the vehicle last week.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes the open file that SARA hands him. They walk out of camera frame.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. BEN WESTON'S OFFICE - DAY]</p>
<p><strong>Ben Weston</strong>: You found my car?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Why? Is your car missing?</p>
<p><strong>Ben Weston</strong>: Yeah, isn't that why you guys are here? I filed a police report a couple days ago. God, I love that car. Hocked my future on it. Tell me it hadn't been stripped.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You wouldn't happen to have a copy of that police report, would you?</p>
<p><strong>Ben Weston</strong>: I'm a lawyer.</p>
<p>(BEN WESTON smiles. He reaches down and hands the file to SARA. There are boxes stacked all over his office. It's as if he just moved into it.)</p>
<p><strong>Ben Weston</strong>: Here you go.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Sarasota Silver, S-Series, stolen Monday night.</p>
<p><strong>Ben Weston</strong>: Yeah, I stopped for take-out after work. When I came out, it was gone.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Don't most of these luxury vehicles have security systems?</p>
<p><strong>Ben Weston</strong>: What's with all the questions?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We're investigating a possible hit-and-run.</p>
<p><strong>Ben Weston</strong>: You think the b*st*rd that stole my car hit someone?</p>
<p>(Instead of answering him, GRISSOM looks around the room and his eyes instantly land on the young lawyer's diplomas. One from St. Ignacias High School and the other from Nevada State Law School.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Ignacias High, Nevada State University ... are you a local?</p>
<p><strong>Ben Weston</strong>: Yeah. Great town. I studied my ass off in law school. Passed the bar first time.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Good for you. Let me guess -- criminal defense?</p>
<p><strong>Ben Weston</strong>: Everyone deserves representation.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yes, they do. Would you happen to remember what clothes you were wearing yesterday?</p>
<p><strong>Ben Weston</strong>: A blue pinstripe, a light blue oxford, gray tie -- a gift from my girlfriend. First week as an associate -- firm like this you tend to pay attention to wardrobe.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Mr. Weston, we'd like to take a look at those clothes.</p>
<p><strong>Ben Weston</strong>: Really? Well, you need a warrant. </p>
<p>(BEN WESTON looks at SARA. She shakes her head. She doesn't have one. BEN WESTON smiles.)</p>
<p><strong>Ben Weston</strong>: But I'm a nice guy. I picked them up at lunch. Downstairs -- one-hour dry cleaning.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Nice suit.</p>
<p><strong>Ben Weston</strong>: Thank you. I just bought it.</p>
<p>(SARA and GRISSOM both look at the shirt. Without removing the plastic covering, the both immediately notice the damage.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I hope you didn't just buy the shirt.</p>
<p><strong>Ben Weston</strong>: Oh, come on. I've been meaning to change dry cleaners.</p>
<p>(BEN WESTON looks at the shirt and takes the cleaning away from SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, maybe you shouldn't have gotten lye on it. Lye is an alkali and when it's mixed with water, it eats right through fabric. Mr. Weston ... you mind taking off your shirt?</p>
<p><strong>Ben Weston</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Lye can burn through fabric. It can also burn through skin.</p>
<p><strong>Ben Weston</strong>: I have my limits. You want me to strip, you're going to need a warrant. But since there's no basis for your request you can forget about it.</p>
<p>(Camera holds on GRISSOM.)</p>

[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY]</p>
<p>(The table is pulled out of its storage unit. The sheet is pulled away from the body to show the woman from the desert.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: She drowned. </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: This is the girl I found in the desert.</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: It's not possible, Dave-O. She was found in Diablo Canyon -- miles from the nearest water source. Lake Mead's got to be 20 miles away.</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: That musclehead boyfriend --he's a little shady. He's hiding something. I can feel it.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Are you able to prove that he drowned her in their swimming pool?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Four samples: One from their swimming pool one from their bathroom, one from Lake Mead and one from Clark County Reservoir but none are consistent with the water I recovered from her stomach. </p>

<p>(Quick flashback to BOB MARTIN slamming head first through the wind shield. Flash to white. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So now he's bleeding and his blood is dripping onto the mat. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to blood dripping from BOB MARTIN'S bleeding face. Cut to close up of blood drop spattering. Flash to white. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: The victim bled out for two days.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, but he could have been conscious, right? Until he lost a third of his circulating blood volume?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Then the hypovolemic shock would have set in after approximately 12 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So it's possible that he was wedged into the windshield of Ben Weston's Mercedes which was parked in Ben Weston's garage.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We know where Bob Martin was. Where was Ben Weston?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: My guess? ... at work, making a good impression. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to BEN WESTON on the phone in his office. He's smiling and laughing. Flash to white. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Sometimes I'm glad I only deal with dead people.</p>
<p>(ROBBINS walks away.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You know ... the tow truck driver said Weston's Mercedes was totaled. But the only damage would have been to the bumper and the windshield. He's lying.</p>

[INT. SALVAGE YARD.]</p>
<p>(MITCHELL SULLIVAN washes the grime from his hands. Reflected in the mirror in front of him, we see BRASS standing there.)</p>
<p><strong>Mitchell Sullivan</strong>: Maybe it wasn't totaled. I don't remember. I was only interested in the parts.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You don't know who phoned it in?</p>
<p><strong>Mitchell Sullivan</strong>: It was a guy. What else can I tell you?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Mr. Sullivan, in '96 you were arrested for vandalism, right?</p>
<p><strong>Mitchell Sullivan</strong>: I was 18. It was a prank. I hoisted the principal's station wagon onto the roof of the gym.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: St. Ignacias High School, right?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You know. It's funny, but the registered owner of the Mercedes also went to St. Ignacious. You were in the same class. Ben Weston. </p>
<p><strong>Mitchell Sullivan</strong>: That might ring a bell. So what?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He's been arrested on a hit-and-run. He's also under suspicion for murder. That makes you an accomplice after the fact. Twenty to life.</p>
<p>(MITCHELL SULLIVAN turns around to face BRASS. He's not too thrilled with this disclosure.)</p>
<p><strong>Mitchell Sullivan</strong>: Okay, look, all I did was take his call, take his car. I don't even like the guy. In high school, he's the one who turned me in. He said he wanted to make it up to me.</p>

<p>(SARA opens the car trunk and uses her flashlight to look inside. Behind her, GREG walks in.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Just remind yourself that usually I bring the case home.</p>
<p>(GREG hands SARA the test results with the following information: )</p>
<p>Date: 5/01/02<br />
PCR AMP #: 198456722</p>
<p>DNA STR TYPING RESULT ...<br />
Sample # 1: &quot;Blood In Concrete&quot;<br />
INC. INC. INC. INC. INC.<br />
NR. NR. INC. INC. INC.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: If that garage floor stain started out as blood the bleach just degraded it. There's nothing for me to work with. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: There goes the slam dunk. Blood in the garage would have conclusively linked victim to killer.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: So is this his rental car?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Sunset Park is two miles from Ben Weston's house. I was thinking maybe he used this car to transport the body to the dump site.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: So we should be able to find some of the vic's blood or hair or fibers from his clothes?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No visible trace of any kind. Except for this.</p>
<p>(At the bottom on the trunk is a large screw-like handle. She unscrews it and sticks her finger inside and we notice evidence of white power along the trunk edges.)</p>

[EXT. DIABLO CANYON -- DAY]</p>
<p><strong>Det. Lockwood</strong>: So this Mountain Shadow Effect -- the barometric pressure spikes down the temperature strikes down ...</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Right. Humidity spikes up. Moisture in the air condenses.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to CGI recreation of clouds gathering in the canyon at night. Thunder can be heard. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. Lockwood</strong>: The mountains get a flash flood.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I checked with the national weather service. This area got three inches of rain in 20 minutes the night Stacy died. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to STACY WARNER hiking at night.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. Lockwood</strong>: (V.O.) So, she was up here hiking when the weather changed.</p>
<p>(Clouds roll overhead. Thunder rumbles. Wind whistles.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (V.O.) Got nasty in a hurry. Nothing she could really do about it.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Lockwood</strong>: (V.O.) Takes one to the head ... on to the basalt rock. She's trying to clear the cobwebs when the rain hit.</p>
<p>(STACY WARNER hits her head on the rocks. She looks up at the sky. It starts raining. She tries to continue to climb up the rocks and slide down as it continues to rain. Thunder rumbles. She gets caught in the flood of water pouring down from above.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (V.O.) But it was too late. She drowns in the floodwater. Body gets carried to the base of the canyon. </p>
<p>(STACY WARNER loses her grip and gets swept down from the rocks by the flood water. Cut to CGI POV as the floodwaters push STACY WARNER'S body down to the canyon floor where NICK and DET. LOCKWOOD stand.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. Lockwood</strong>: A couple hours worth of sun water dries up.</p>
<p>(As the body comes to a halt, it fades out. End of Flashback and CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No evidence of the storm anywhere except on the vic who carried traced amounts of basalt rock with her and rainwater in her throat.</p>
<p>(NICK'S cell phone rings.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (to phone) Stokes.</p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH:</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - LAB]</p>
<p><strong>Ronnie Litre</strong>: The map has definitely been tampered with.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (over phone) You sure about that?</p>
<p><strong>Ronnie Litre</strong>: Positive. Chemical tag in the ink tells the tale. Then I shot the maps with 300 nanometers just to be sure.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (over phone) I need you to get those results to me.</p>
<p><strong>Ronnie Litre</strong>: Thought you would. I have a messenger on call.</p>

[INT. HUDSON/WARNER RESIDENCE -- DAY]</p>
<p>(MATT HUDSON runs on the treadmill.)</p>
<p><strong>Matt Hudson</strong>: Are you telling me Stacy's death was an accident?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: An accident of nature, yeah. But you still had a hand in her death just the same, didn't you, Mr. Hudson?</p>
<p><strong>Matt Hudson</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Why don't you take a break. Come on over here for a sec. </p>
<p>(MATT HUDSON stops running on the treadmill and steps off. He grabs his towel and approaches NICK.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You altered the map. You used the same color ink as the printer but the chemical tags in the ink are different. This is magic marker. </p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV Flashback to someone using a pen to alter the map.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: And when you shine ultraviolet light on it like this ... </p>
<p>(NICK uses the light and the hand-made changes become apparent.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: ... you can see exactly what you did. You made this look like an impenetrable ridge -- no way out, when it's actually a meadow.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Lockwood</strong>: If she had a good map she might have been able to find her way out of the highlands by nightfall.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Hudson</strong>: I didn't want her to die. I didn't.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Then why did you alter the map?</p>
<p><strong>Matt Hudson</strong>: We competed. I'd just run the trail in three days. I didn't want her to beat my time. </p>
<p>(NICK sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Matt Hudson</strong>: Am I being charged with murder?</p>
<p><strong>Det. Lockwood</strong>: No. You altered the map, but you didn't make it rain. </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What you did isn't a crime ... but it is criminal, isn't it?</p>
<p>(NICK and DET. LOCKWOOD leave.)</p>

SCENE #30</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERROGATION ROOM]</p>
<p><strong>Ben Weston</strong>: Oh, come on. Your entire case is circumstantial. Your physical evidence is pathetic. You've got, what, a wrecked car -- a white powder in a rental -- and a bleached-out stain in my garage. If that's all you've got you won't even get a filing.</p>
<p>(From under the file in front of him, GRISSOM pulls out a baggied cell phone.)</p>
<p><strong>Ben Weston</strong>: My cell phone.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah. Mitchell Sullivan found it in your car at his chop shop.</p>
<p><strong>Ben Weston</strong>: I hope he didn't make any long-distance calls. Thanks.</p>
<p>(BEN WESTON reaches for it. GRISSOM stops him.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Ben Weston</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(SARA walks in. BEN WESTON looks up.)</p>
<p><strong>Ben Weston</strong>: Hey, now it's a party.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: And I brought the music. </p>
<p>(She holds up a small micro-cassette recorder. She takes a seat at the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You'll be happy to know that there were no long-distanced calls made on your cell phone. But there was one call made -- to 9-1-1 at 2:30 A.M. On Tuesday morning while your car was still in your possession.</p>
<p>(SARA turns on the table recorder.)</p>
<p><strong>911 Operator (woman)</strong>: 9-1-1. What's your emergency?</p>
<p><strong>Bob Martin (gasping)</strong>: Please help me. </p>
<p>(Flashback to BOB MARTIN hanging over the front seat passenger dash. He's bloodied and gasping for breath. In front of him is the blue glow of the cell phone's LCD panel.)</p>
<p><strong>Bob Martin</strong>: I need help ...</p>
<p><strong>911 Operator (woman)</strong>: I can't hear you. You'll have to speak up.</p>
<p><strong>Bob Martin</strong>: Help ...</p>
<p><strong>911 Operator (woman)</strong>: Sir, our system is not compatible with your cellular phone. Where are you calling from?</p>
<p><strong>Bob Martin</strong>: (swallows) I'm in a garage.</p>
<p><strong>911 Operator (woman)</strong>: Sir, can you see a street sign?</p>
<p><strong>Bob Martin</strong>: It's dark ...</p>
<p>(BOB MARTIN passes out with the effort. Flash to white. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes off his glasses.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Explain it to me, Ben. How does a lawyer rationalize something like this?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You know the law. You hit a guy. It was an accident. Nothing criminal. But you let it escalate to first-degree murder. I spoke with your senior partner. It was your first day on the job. Big firm. Big welcome. How many drinks did you have that night?</p>
<p>(BEN WESTON looks at SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Let me guess. You wanted the alcohol to wear off before you called it in, right? So you decided to wait it out. Have a cup of coffee, sober up and then call the cops. But unfortunately, Bob Martin woke up.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback. Door to garage opening. Light goes on. BEN WESTON appears in the doorway. BOB MARTIN is conscious.)</p>
<p><strong>Bob Martin</strong>: Help me. Please, help ... help me...</p>
<p>(Camera close up of BEN WESTON. Garage lights go out. Garage door closes. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So what do you do now, hmm? Can't walk into the Emergency Room and say, &quot;Hey, this guy was bleeding to death in my garage while I was eating mu shu pork.&quot;</p>
<p>(A soft knock sounds on the door to the interrogation room just before it opens.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer Metcalf</strong>: (quietly) Sara, there's someone here to see you.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Not right now.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Metcalf</strong>: You'll want to talk to him. It's relevant.</p>
<p>(SARA looks at GRISSOM. She stands and leaves the room.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at BEN WESTON.)</p>
<p><strong>Ben Weston</strong>: I sacrificed to get where I am. My whole life was leading up to last Monday.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah. It's tough, huh? Fifteen years to build your dream and a fifteen-second phone call destroys it.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY OUTSIDE INTERROGATION ROOM]</p>
<p>(SARA holds a piece of paper.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Where did you find this?</p>
<p><strong>Reed Collins</strong>: Packing up Bob's stuff. Found it on his dresser. Thought you'd want to see it.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>(SARA leaves the hallway and goes back into the room.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT -- INTERROGATION ROOM -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(SARA closes the door, sits down and hands the paper to GRISSOM. GRISSOM puts his glasses on to read it. He looks over at SARA. GRISSOM takes off his glasses and turns to BEN WESTON.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: When a driver hits a pedestrian the presumption is the driver is negligent. When a driver's been drinking and he hits a pedestrian it's no longer negligence, it's reckless homicide. But when a pedestrian intentionally throws himself in front of a moving vehicle then the driver's no longer responsible. Legally, he's off the hook.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: This suicide letter was written by Bob Martin to his wife Charlotte. When you hit him Monday night it wasn't an accident. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to close up of BOB MARTIN standing behind the bus stop. As the car driven by BEN WESTON approaches, BOB MARTIN deliberately walks toward it, stops and stands in front of the car waiting to be hit. Cut to BEN WESTON looking to the side presumably to put his cell phone down. The car impacts BOB MARTIN and he crashes in through the passenger wind shield. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You were off the hook.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Until you let him die.</p>
<p>(Camera holds on BEN WESTON.)</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>

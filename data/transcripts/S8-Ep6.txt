<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) – NIGHT]</p>
<p>[INT. DAVIS RESIDENCE – LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(The dice rolls out onto the coffee table.) </p>
<p><strong>Carmen Davis</strong>: She-bang! </p>
<p>(Carmen Davis is playing with a young blonde-haired boy who sits on the couch looking very bored. She holds a glass of wine as she plays the game.) </p>
<p><strong>Carmen Davis</strong>: That's pretty cool, right?</p>
<p><strong>Evan Michaels</strong>: (nods) Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Carmen Davis</strong>: That doesn't happen very often, you know.</p>
<p><strong>Evan Michaels</strong>: I know.</p>
<p>(She totals the points.) </p>
<p><strong>Carmen Davis</strong>: You won. You beat me!</p>
<p><strong>Evan Michaels</strong>: (unenthusiastic) Uh-huh.</p>
<p>(She puts her glass down on the table and gathers the dice.) </p>
<p><strong>Carmen Davis</strong>: You want to play again?</p>
<p>(She shakes the container. He shakes his head. The dice rattle. She sighs.) </p>
<p><strong>Carmen Davis</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p>(She picks up her wine glass.) </p>
<p><strong>Carmen Davis</strong>: Whatever.</p>
<p>(She gives him the television remote.) </p>
<p><strong>Carmen Davis</strong>: Knock yourself out.</p>
<p>(Carmen gets up and heads down the hallway. Evan turns the television set on to watch cartoons.) </p>
<p>(Carmen closes the bathroom door.) </p>
<p>[INT. DAVIS RESIDENCE -- BATHROOM – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The bathtub water runs. Carmen drops the towel wrapped around her, turns the water off and climbs into the bathtub. She sighs and settles back to enjoy her bath. She has candles lit on the sink, shelves and windowsill, and she has her glass of wine with her.) </p>
<p>(The small apartment starts to quiver and shake, the bottles on the sink rattle as the nearby train passes by. But Carmen is used to this. She continues with her bath and sips from her wine glass.) </p>
<p>(Then, she hears a loud thud coming from outside. She puts her wine glass down on the bathroom sink. She looks at the door.) </p>
<p><strong>Carmen Davis</strong>: Evan? Evan.</p>
<p>(She hears a sound coming from the other side of the door.)</p>
<p>(She sees the doorknob turn and open. A bloodied hand pushes the door open.)</p>
<p>(The train horn blows.) </p>
<p>(She screams.)</p>
<p>(The door is pushed open and a man carrying a hammer walks in. He hits her over and over and over again; blood spatters everywhere – on the sink, on the wall, on the tub.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. STREET OUTSIDE DAVIS RESIDENCE – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The CSI SUV turns the corner and pulls up along the curb. Grissom gets out of the car and appears puzzled by what he sees – David Phillips and the other coroner are leaning against the gurney on the sidewalk.)</p>
<p>(He heads for the house.) </p>
<p>[INT. DAVIS RESIDENCE – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Grissom peers into the house. He sees the body of the little boy on the living room floor, face down. Apparently, nothing has been done yet. Grissom walks up to the body. Greg is kneeling next to the boy. He looks at Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How long have you been here?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: About six hours.</p>
<p>(Grissom turns and heads for the bathroom at the end of the hall where Carmen's body is on the floor. She is covered with a towel.) </p>
<p>(He turns when he hears a camera snap. Catherine is taking photos in the bedroom.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Why haven't these bodies been released?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Good question. David was in Henderson on another call, so, when Greg and I got here, we just started processing the house. </p>
<p>(Catherine walks over to him.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Found the victim in the bathroom, covered with a towel. We got a plastic print on the bathroom door. It's the strongest piece of evidence -- I photographed it and transmitted the image back to the lab; Mandy got a hit to an unknown palm; case info was in ViCAP. And then, Dispatch called, telling me to stop processing immediately, by order of the FBI.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The FBI field office is right next to the Strip. What's taking them so long?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, beats the hell out of me.</p>
<p>(The small apartment starts to quiver and shake, the bottles on the sink rattle as the nearby train approaches. Overhead, they hear the sounds of a helicopter rotor. Catherine and Grissom look at each other.) </p>
<p>[EXT. STREET OUTSIDE DAVIS RESIDENCE – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The FBI helicopter, #N67TV, approaches and lands near the house. Brass walks over. Jack Malone gets out of the helicopter and they shake hands.) </p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: Jack Malone, FBI.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Jim Brass.</p>
<p>(They head for the house.) </p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: I'm based in New York, but I was testifying in a case in San Francisco. When I heard about the ViCAP hit, I got here as fast as I could.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Chopper from the Strip? That's nice. That's my tax dollars at work?</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: You get a positive ID on the boy?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No, but we have an ID on the female -- name is Carmen Davis. According to neighbors, she lives alone. Apparently no kids of her own. But if I find anything out, I'll let you know.</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: Thank you. </p>
<p>(Brass leaves. Jack motions for David Phillips and the other coroner.) </p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: You're up. </p>
<p>(David takes his kit and follows him inside.) </p>
<p>[INT. DAVIS RESIDENCE – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Jack enters the residence. He sees Greg with his camera.) </p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: (to Greg) You -- you get enough photos?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Definitely.</p>
<p>(Catherine and Grissom are there as well.) </p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: (to David) Roll the body over.</p>
<p>(David rolls the little boy's body over so that Jack can see his face. Jack is quiet. He sighs.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What's going on?</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: Jack Malone, FBI, New York City. </p>
<p>(Jack hands Catherine a photo.) </p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: This boy was kidnapped from his babysitter's apartment six years ago. Babysitter was killed. The only evidence at the crime scene was a bloody palm print.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, there may be a resemblance, but kids change a lot in six years.</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: DNA will tell us if this is your kid. But it does look like your killer came to Vegas.</p>
<p>FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[INT. DAVIS RESIDENCE – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(David Phillips goes over the body.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Based on levidity and rigor, TOD is roughly 24 hours ago. And he's got perimortem bruising on the back of the neck. And a single sharp-force injury to the forehead.</p>
<p>(Grissom notices the blood on the table.) </p>
<p>ECU – THE TABLE CORNER</p>
<p>(There are blonde hairs stuck to the blood on the corner.) </p>
<p>BACK TO SCENE</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Looks like he hit his head on the table.</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: Or somebody slammed it against the table.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, we don't know that yet.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Agent Malone, why don't I fill you in on what else we do know. There are no signs anywhere that the boy actually lived here. The sleeping bag on the couch indicates that he was probably a house guest. Why don't you follow me into the kitchen. </p>
<p>(Catherine heads for the kitchen. Jack looks at David.) </p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: Let me know when you're ready to transport the body.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p>(Jack follows Catherine into the kitchen. Grissom looks at the little boy.)</p>
<p>ECU – THE COLLAR</p>
<p>(There is a fine white powder on the collar.) </p>
<p>BACK TO SCENE</p>
<p>(Grissom tape-lifts the powder and looks at it.) </p>
<p>[INT. DAVIS RESIDENCE – KITCHEN -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Greg is looking through a wallet at the kitchen table when Catherine and Jack join him.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Bring us up to speed, Greg. </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Okay, sure. Um ... Carmen Davis's keys were still in her purse; the car's outside. No cash in the wallet, and the credit cards have been removed and neatly stacked on the table; it appears as though they've been wiped clean. The killer was smart enough not to take anything that could be traced.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Which suggests that he was an experienced criminal. What do you know about this guy?</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: Including everything you just told me? Everything you just told me. Six years ago, the killer took the murder weapon with him. It was a baseball bat that he found in the apartment.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, this time, we think it's hammer.</p>
<p>[INT. DAVIS RESIDENCE – BATHROOM -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Catherine shows Jack the wounds on Carmen's head.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The round indentation wounds are consistent with hammer blows. Do you see any similarities between this victim and the babysitter who was killed six years ago?</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: Just that they were both bludgeoned to death. The babysitter was a lot older, and she wasn't covered.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Covering a body usually indicates remorse on the part of the killer.</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: So you think he felt remorseful about this victim and not the one from six years ago?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Maybe he knew Carmen Davis. There's three toothbrushes, two of them in travel cases. My guess: the killer was staying here with the little boy. There was no sign of forced entry.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: (o.s.) Agent Malone?</p>
<p>(Jack turns and looks at the coroners.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: We're read to take the boy out.</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(He turns back to Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, I assume we'll be sending over the case evidence to Quantico?</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: We can't process the evidence from every case we're involved in. We have a massive overload already. This will be joint jurisdiction. You do your thing, I'll do mine.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) – MORNING]</p>
<p>[INT. CSI – FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Catherine walks into Autopsy. Robbins fills her in on his findings.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: COD is multiple blunt-force trauma. Based on the development of the contusions, it appears the blow to the back of the skull was the first impact, but the ones on the face came about half-hour later.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Half an hour? </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Was she raped?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Yeah. I ... uh ... did a wet mount, found semen in the vaginal vault, and I collected an SAE kit.</p>
<p>(He hands her the kit.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: This guy is some piece of work.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (nods) I'll get it to DNA.</p>
<p>(Catherine heads out.) </p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO: </p>
<p>VARIOUS FLASHES OF THE LITTLE BOY'S BODY</p>
<p>[INT. CSI – AUTOPSY – DAY]</p>
<p>(Grissom is using a magnifying glass to look over the body. Jack is standing in the back of the room.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No birthmarks.</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: Our missing boy didn't have any, either.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So the only way to confirm the identity ...</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: (interrupts) I've had the original DNA report electronically sent to your lab.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, then you'll just have to wait for your answer. (Grissom turns around.) You know, maybe now would be a good time for you to brief us on the original case.</p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO: </p>
<p>[INT. BABYSITTER'S APARTMENT – NIGHT – FLASHBACK]</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: (V.O.) His name was Jason Taylor.</p>
<p>(The babysitter and Jason Taylor sit on the couch and watch television.)</p>
<p>(The sound of glass breaking startles them.)</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: (V.O.) He was at his babysitter's apartment.</p>
<p>(Someone outside opens a window.) </p>
<p>(The babysitter and Jason get up.) </p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: (V.O.) He'd been home sick from school.</p>
<p>(The intruder climbs into the apartment.) </p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: (V.O.) That's when it happened.</p>
<p>(The intruder grabs a baseball bat leaning against the side of the wall.) </p>
<p>(CUT TO: The babysitter falls to the floor, her head bleeding.) </p>
<p>(The intruder carries Jason Taylor with him out the window. He keeps the bloodied bat.) </p>
<p>(CUT TO: Jack enters the apartment with the officers processing the scene. He looks at the body on the floor. He looks at the open window. There's a bloodied palm print on the outside of the living room window frame.) </p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: (V.O.) An unidentified male entered, most likely through an open window on the fire escape, murdered the babysitter and took Jason with him.</p>
<p>BACK TO SCENE.</p>
<p>[INT. CSI – EVIDENCE ROOM]</p>
<p>(Jack is talking with Nick, Warrick, Catherine and Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: Uh, we never got a decent description of the perp.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Nothing was stolen?</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: Cash was still in the babysitter's purse; the only thing missing was a baseball bat.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Which, based on her wounds, you figure that was the murder weapon?</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Baseball bat there, hammer here-- weapons of convenience. Guy seems to grab whatever's handy.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And takes it with him. (to Jack) Was the babysitter raped?</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Why kidnap a kid, wait six years, then kill him?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Most four-year-olds will do what you tell them. Most ten-year-olds will do what they want.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Kid starts asking the wrong questions, talking to the wrong people ... tons of possibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: Yes. Way too many.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: According to this, the kid was adopted. Did you take a look at the biological parents?</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: Jason was adopted as an infant. Uh, there was no way we could track his records.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Adoptive parents had no contact with the kidnappers? They were not given any ransom demands?</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: There was no motive. I couldn't even give the parents a reason.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Maybe there isn't one.</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: Most children are abducted by somebody who's associated with the family. Random kidnappings are extraordinarily rare.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Except in the US last year, there were almost a hundred. Some things are just random.</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: Have you ever tried telling that to the parents of a child who's been kidnapped?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yes, actually, I have.</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: And how'd that work out for you?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – DNA LAB] </p>
<p>(Wendy is processing the samples.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS COMMUNITY (STOCK) – DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. DAVIS RESIDENCE – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Greg walks out of the bedroom and heads for the living room. Nick is in the living room while Warrick is looking around the kitchen.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Hey, guys. I found an empty jewelry box in the bedroom. Maybe the killer swiped the jewelry in addition to the cash. Easy to fence in this neighborhood.</p>
<p>(Nick picks up a framed photo.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Was the dead girl wearing any jewelry when you found her?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Then that's a good call, man, 'cause she's wearing some in just about every one of these pictures.</p>
<p>(Warrick is looking at a printout for a POKER TOURNAMENT at PLANET HOLLYWOOD.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I wouldn't doubt if she kept a lot of it in that box. I'll check with the local pawnshops, see if anything's been hocked.</p>
<p>(Warrick checks the computer and finds it on a poker game.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey, Greg, you see any books on the shelf over there on gambling or poker?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: No, just a lot of romance novels, mysteries and women's health.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: 'Cause I got poker player stats, and multiple websites on online gambling. Seems kind of out of place to be the victim's. I think we got a mystery houseguest who is a card shark.</p>
<p>(The number highlighted and circled on the poker sheet print-out is 273.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The Planet Hollywood Hotel.) </p>
<p>[INT. PLANET HOLLYWOOD – GAME FLOOR – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(A poker table. The dealer shuffles and deals out the cards to the various players. Warrick, Jack and a couple of officers walk in. They look around the room, which is set up with many poker tables. They spread out between tables looking for player #273.) </p>
<p><strong>Announcer</strong>: (over speakers) Ladies and gentlemen, the first of the elimination rounds for our money poker tournament are over and we're down to our last one hundred players. Congratulations to all and good luck.</p>
<p>(As they walk through the tables, they look for the player #273.) </p>
<p>(Player 273 wears a dark jacket and sits at the table. Warrick sees him. Player 273 sees Warrick. He gets up and runs.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Got him!</p>
<p>(Warrick and the officers chase after him. Jack heads him off.) </p>
<p>(Player 273 reaches the slot machines and runs, making his way to the exit. Suddenly, Jack steps out in front of him and elbows him in the face. Player 273 goes down with a thud.) </p>
<p><strong>Player 273</strong>: Ugh.</p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – INTERVIEW ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Warrick takes Tom Michael's fingerprints.) </p>
<p><strong>Tom Michaels</strong>: You know what this is? Huh? This is police brutality.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, whatever.</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – OBSERVATION ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Warrick hands Tom Michaels a tissue. In the observation room, Brass and Jack watch them inside the interview room.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (through speaker) We're not done yet.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, he doesn't look like much, but then again, they never do.</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: If you don't mind, I'd like to talk to him first.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You don't have to be polite, Jack. This is a federal case; you don't need my permission.</p>
<p>(In the interview room, Warrick rolls some ink on Tom Michael's palm.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: How you going to go at him?</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: I don't know. I usually just make it up as I go along.</p>

<p><strong>Tom Michaels</strong>: Yeah, I know. But you never really think you're going to get caught, do you?</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: Yeah, but you did. You want to talk about it? I got nowhere I have to be. And you got nowhere to go.</p>

<p>(A black car, license #ARCB-421, pulls to the side of the road in front of the state trooper, who stops him.) </p>
<p><strong>Dispatch</strong>: (from radio) Chevy Impala, Nevada license Adam-Robert-Charles-Boy-4-<br />
2-1. No wants or warrants, welfare check only. License owner is a Gina Farentino.</p>
<p><strong>State Trooper Robinson</strong>: (to radio) Copy, Dispatch.</p>
<p>(Robinson gets out of the car. He walks over to the car and looks in the backseat. He waves, then looks at the driver.)</p>
<p><strong>Robinson</strong>: License and registration, sir.</p>
<p><strong>Man In The Baseball Cap</strong>: I got it right here.</p>
<p>(The man reaches to the side, picks up his gun and shoots Robinson four times in the chest. Robinson falls backwards. The black car takes off and speeds away.) </p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY ROAD -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Jack sits in the car watching footage from the video camera mounted on the state trooper's car.) </p>
<p>(On the monitor, Robinson walks up to the car, waves, then leans forward to talk with the driver. The driver fires and Robinson falls to the ground.) </p>
<p>(Grissom kneels next to Robinson's body. Jack gets out of the car and joins him. Grissom picks up the casing and looks at it.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: .45 auto. Same caliber as the one taken from the Boulder City double.</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: You can see the whole thing on video if you want.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Was the waitress in the car with him?</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: He was waving at somebody in the passenger seat when he got shot. According to the time code on the dash cam, it was about 33 minutes ago.</p>
<p>(Grissom looks out at the long stretch of road in front of them.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's a pretty good head start.</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: Yeah. I don't want to lose this guy.</p>
<p>(Grissom's phone rings. He answers it on speakerphone.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to phone) Grissom.</p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[INT. CSI – HALLWAY]</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to phone) We ran the fingerprints that Nick lifted from the casino IRS form. Got an AFIS hit. Terry Lee Wicker. Served two years in Sing Sing for burglary. He got out four months before Jack's original kidnapping, and get this, when he was sent up, he was married to Gina Farentino. Brass put out a broadcast.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to phone) Listen, do me a favor. Take a look at the map, find the nearest railway spur to our location.</p>
<p>(Catherine enters the layout room and checks the map on the table.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to phone) Meadowood. It's off the 93, and it looks to be about ... 16 miles northeast of your location.</p>
<p>(Grissom turns and looks in that direction.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. MEADOWOOD -- RAILROAD SPUR (STOCK) – DAY]</p>
<p>[EXT. MEADOWOOD -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Officer cars arrive with sirens blaring. They stop just behind the black car parked next to one of the trains.) </p>
<p>(Jack gets out of the car with his gun out. The other officers also get out with their guns out. Jack approaches the car and finds the driver door wide open and empty.) </p>
<p>(The station yard controller dressed in an orange vest approaches them.) </p>
<p><strong>Station Yard Controller</strong>: What the hell's going on?</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: Did you see who drove this car here?</p>
<p><strong>Station Yard Controller</strong>: No, but I called the tow company. You can't park here.</p>
<p>(A train whistle blows. One of the trains is leaving.) </p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: Where's that train going?</p>
<p><strong>Station Yard Controller</strong>: The Fresno 211. Chicago bound.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Any other trains pass through here in the last hour?</p>
<p><strong>Station Yard Controller</strong>: No, and nothing else is scheduled for another hour.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Can you stop that train?</p>
<p><strong>Station Yard Controller</strong>: I don't have that capacity, no. Who you guys looking for?</p>
<p>(Jack, Grissom and one of the officers turn to board the train. It's several tracks over. Jack jumps onto an open car filled with motorcycles. He jumps out the other side, turns and finds Grissom already there waiting for him. Grissom shrugs and they continue toward the second train.) </p>
<p>(Jack climbs up the side and jumps down the other side. Grissom follows them. They find the third train leaving.) </p>
<p>(They both turn and run toward the moving train. They grab a hold and climb aboard.) </p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: You starting to miss the lab?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No, I like a good field trip.</p>
<p>(Jack takes his gun out.) </p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: Right. Stay behind me.</p>
<p>(They enter the passenger car and start looking for a man in a baseball cap.) </p>
<p>(They find a man wearing a baseball cap sitting next to a window and looking outside. Jack approaches the man.) </p>
<p>(Grissom motions for the officers behind him to stay close.) </p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: Freeze! (The man turns around.) Put your hands where I can see 'em! You Wicker?</p>
<p><strong>Baxter</strong>: No. The name's Baxter, and I ain't got no ticket.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Where'd you get that hat?</p>
<p><strong>Baxter</strong>: Oh ... from a man. (Baxter takes out a bill and shows it to them.) He gave me a hundred bucks to get on this train. I don't want no trouble. I mean ... don't shoot.</p>
<p>(Jack puts his gun away and takes his sunglasses off. This isn't the guy. He looks at Grissom.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. MEADOWOOD -- DAY] </p>
<p>REVERSE VIEW – INSIDE THE CAR TRUNK</p>
<p>(The trunk opens. Grissom and Jack look inside. Grissom sighs.) </p>
<p>(They find Gina Farentino's dead body inside.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Maybe, uh ... he came here to kill his ex-wife.</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: Why? </p>
<p>(Grissom's phone rings. He puts it on speakerphone.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Grissom.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (from phone) It's Brass.</p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – HALLWAY]</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (to phone) Listen, the Boulder PD got a call from the principal at the local elementary school. Gina Farentino was supposed to pick up her son, only she didn't show up.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to phone) Yeah, there's a reason for that.</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: (to phone) She had a son?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (to phone) The kid's name is Kobe. Yeah, according to the principal, a guy fitting Wicker's description came and picked him up in the mother's car. He said the kid seemed to know him.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to phone) Thanks, Jim.</p>
<p>(Jack thinks about it. Grissom opens the backseat door and looks inside. He finds a handheld game and an empty juice box left on the seat.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hey, Jack. I don't think that trooper was waving at Gina.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: State Trooper Robinson approaches the car. He looks in the backseat and sees the little boy. He smiles and waves to the boy. He approaches Wicker in the driver's seat.) </p>
<p><strong>State Trooper Robinson</strong>: License and registration, sir.</p>
<p><strong>Terry Lee Wicker</strong>: I got it right here.</p>
<p>(Wicker reaches for his gun, turns and shoots the Trooper.) </p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO: PRESENT</p>
<p>(Jack walks up to Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You said the kid who was kidnapped was six years old when he was adopted, birth parents unknown.</p>
<p>(Grissom shows him the game and empty juice box.) </p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: That's right.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Terry Wicker was looking for his ex-wife ... </p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: ... and his son.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: A family reunion.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. ROAD (STOCK) – DAY]</p>
<p>(A MOJAVE EXPRESS bus passes by.) </p>
<p>[INT. BUS – DAY]</p>
<p>(The bus is full of passengers.) </p>
<p><strong>Terry Lee Wicker</strong>: (singing softly)<br />
The wheels on the bus go round and round<br />
Round and round, round and round<br />
The wheels on the bus go round and round<br />
All round the town. </p>
<p>(Terry Lee Wicker sits in the seat next to the sleeping blonde-haired boy.) </p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>

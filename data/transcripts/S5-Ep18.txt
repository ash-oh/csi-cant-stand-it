							<p>COLD OPEN:</p>
<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Camera lingers on various Las Vegas city stock shots. It rises up toward the starry night sky, passes the moon and moves down to the woods.)</p>
<p>[EXT. WOODS] </p>
<p>(A man carrying a telescope kit walks through the grass and trees to find just the right spot. He opens his case and sets up the telescope.) </p>
<p>(The man looks through the telescope.)</p>
<p>SCOPE VIEW</p>
<p>(Through the window of a nearby house, a man loosens his tie.)</p>
<p>(The scope moves up and focuses in on the starry sky above.) </p>
<p>RESUME VIEW</p>
<p>(The man looks through the telescope. He pulls his eye away from the scope, then goes back to look through the scope.)</p>
<p>SCOPE VIEW</p>
<p>(Through the scope, we see the starry sky lit by an unnatural glow on the right side. The light on the right grows brighter and brighter.)</p>
<p>RESUME VIEW</p>
<p>(The man lifts his head from the scope. We notice that his right side is lit by this unnatural light.)</p>
<p>(We also hear the crackling of fire.) </p>
<p>(The man lifts his head and sniffs the air.) </p>
<p>(We see burning particles flit across the screen. The man turns his head. The light is bright and upon him.)</p>
<p>(Right next to him, the grounds are afire. A burning wall of fire makes its way toward him. The man backs away. He stumbles and falls to the ground.)</p>
<p>(The burning block of fire moves toward him.) </p>
<p>(The man screams.)</p>
<p>(The screaming man rolls down the hill, burning.)</p>
<p>(On the ground is the man's pair of glasses. Reflected in the glass is the burning figure of a man consumed by fire.)</p>
<p>(The man screams echo in the night.) </p>
<p>(Through the reflection in the glasses, we see the man fall to the ground as he continues to burn.)</p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
[EXT. WOODS - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CLOSE-UP: The burned corpse.) </p>
<p>(Grissom talks with the Chief Rick Dysart.) </p>
<p><strong>Chief Rick Dysart</strong>: Local homeowner called it in early. We got it contained pretty quick. We were lucky.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Luckier than he was.</p>
<p>(Sara doesn't say anything. Grissom, Sara and Chief Rick Dysart are around the body.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Low humidity, dry brush. Perfect conditions for maximum damage. </p>
<p><strong>Chief Rick Dysart</strong>: Firebugs listen to the weather reports just like we do. Only for different reasons.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Maybe some moron just threw a cigarette out the car window.</p>
<p><strong>Chief Rick Dysart</strong>: You're an optimist.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Do you have a point of origin?</p>
<p><strong>Chief Rick Dysart</strong>: Not yet ... </p>
<p>(Grissom and Chief Rick Dysart stand and look around.) </p>
<p><strong>Chief Rick Dysart</strong>: ... fire spread down the slope. Probably started along top of the ridge. I'll give you a shout when it's safe to come up.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Okay, Mom.</p>
<p>(Chief Rick Dysart smiles a little before he turns and heads back up the hill.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This area was always a good place for stargazing.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It's a good make-out spot, too. So I've heard.</p>
<p>(Sara snaps photos. Grissom glances at her.)</p>
<p>(Around them, the firefighters shoot water on the smoldering area.) </p>
<p>(Grissom walks around. He looks around. He finds a second body under the trees. This one is just as burned.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sara! We've got another body.</p>
<p>(The woman's eyes open.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (shouts) Get the paramedics!</p>
<p>FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(The ER hallway is bustling as Greg walks through it.) </p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: (over p.a.) Dr. Jacobs, dial 102, please. Dr. Jacobs ...</p>
<p>(A nurse works on a woman patient sitting on a gurney.) </p>
<p><strong>Nurse</strong>: Are you okay? Is there anything else? </p>
<p>(Greg walks up to the nurse.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I'm Greg Sanders from the Crime Lab. I'm here to collect trace from the arson victim.</p>
<p><strong>Nurse</strong>: She was in the burn unit. (points) Bay number three.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Nurse</strong>: You're welcome.</p>
<p>(Greg heads for the burn unit.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. HOSPITAL - BURN UNIT (ROOM 408) - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(The door opens; Greg walks in. His steps slow down at what he sees.) </p>
<p>(Inside the sterile burn unit, a team of four work on the woman on the table. Greg stares at them.) </p>
<p>(The team work on removing and replacing the woman's burned skin. They work quickly and efficiently.)</p>
<p>(The doctor steps up behind Greg. Greg turns around slightly, noting his presence.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I thought ... I just assumed she was dead.</p>
<p><strong>Burn Unit Doctor</strong>: It's a miracle she's not. This is as bad as it gets.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: How extensive are the burns?</p>
<p><strong>Burn Unit Doctor</strong>: Eighty percent. Mostly third degree.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I hope the morphine's working.</p>
<p><strong>Burn Unit Doctor</strong>: Third degree burns are painless. The nerves are burned away. She's not conscious of what's happening to her.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Not now.</p>
<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO:<br />
[BURN UNIT -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(Greg is inside the burn unit. He's wearing a white smock.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: She's still a Jane Doe. I'm going to need all of her clothes, as well as any trace off her body.</p>
<p><strong>Burn Unit Doctor</strong>: We'll save whatever we find during debridement.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Debridement?</p>
<p><strong>Burn Unit Doctor</strong>: We scrape off the dead flesh, then cover it with cadaver skin. We then wrap it with gauze. It prevents infection and allows the remaining tissue to heal.</p>
<p>(Someone clips off the woman's wedding ring. Greg watches as they slip it off her finger. The doctor puts it in a metal pan.)</p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong>: Seventy over sixty.</p>
<p>(He hands it to the burn unit doctor. The burn unit doctor hands the metal pan to Greg.) </p>
<p><strong>Burn Unit Doctor</strong>: She's gonna lose those fingers.</p>
<p>(Greg looks up from the metal pan.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[EXT. STEWART RESIDENCE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Dani Stewart is on a gurney as the EMTs wheel her away.) </p>
<p><strong>EMT 1</strong>: Continue chest compressions and manual oxygen.</p>
<p><strong>EMT 2</strong>: ... vital support. ETA to Palm Desert -- eight minutes.</p>
<p>(The EMTs and the gurney pass Catherine, Warrick and Brass.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Just going through the motions. Kid's name is Dani Stewart; she's five. Neighbors saw her floating facedown in the pool from their second-story balcony, called 9-1-1.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Why didn't they pull her out?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: They couldn't get in the backyard gate. Childproof lock.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No key, no access.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Her parents protected that kid to death.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Where the hell were they?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Home.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. STEWART RESIDENCE - KITCHEN -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Brass leads Catherine and Warrick into the house. He stops near the doorway. Catherine and Warrick step inside.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We'll call you, Dave, when we clear a path.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(They walk in through the kitchen, shining their lights on the cluttered table top and counters. Half-eaten food on plates and food still on the cutting board shows they were interrupted at some point. The television set on the kitchen counter is still on.) </p>
<p>[INT. STEWART RESIDENCE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(Catherine and Warrick step out of the kitchen into the dining room. Catherine looks around and sees the various toys on the floor.)</p>
<p>(We hear dripping sounds.) </p>
<p>(Warrick follows the sounds into the living room. He sees the large decorated dish filled with blood. Blood drips down the stair wall as well. He follows the bloodstains and sees a bloodied arm hanging off the side of the stairs.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Oh, man.</p>
<p>(Catherine joins him as they get closer to the body.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Whew. Well ... she obviously fell forward ... </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: ... as she ran down the stairs.</p>
<p>(They head for the base of the stairs to climb up to the second floor.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Lots of pictures of the kid. Family revolved around the child, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, way should be.</p>
<p>(They climb up the stairs. Catherine stops mid-way and sees the broken glass and picture frame of the family portrait still hanging on the stair wall askew.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Struggle?</p>
<p>(Warrick looks at the blood on the cracked glass.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: She might have put her hand out to break her fall.</p>
<p>(The dripping sounds continue.)</p>
<p>(Catherine and Warrick head upstairs to the second floor.) </p>
<p>EXTREME CLOSE-UP: (SLOW MOTION) A SINGLE DROP OF BLOOD FALLS INTO THE LIQUID</p>
<p>[INT. STEWART RESIDENCE - SECOND FLOOR BEDROOM -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(Catherine and Warrick step into the second floor bedroom. They find a second body on the bed.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Man. What a scene.</p>
<p>(On the floor, they notice the broken shards of glass and mercury tip.)</p>
<p>(The murder weapon is in the dead body's right hand. The man is on the bed, the back of the neck resting near the edge of the mattress. On the floor, the carpet is soaked through with a pool of blood.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What are you thinking?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Maybe murder-suicide.</p>
<p>(Warrick puts his kit down. He looks at the gun.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I don't know. This gun looks like it might've been wiped clean.</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: [EARLIER] A person holding the gun walks into the bedroom and finds the man sitting on the bed.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) You thinking professional hit?</p>
<p>(The killer walks up to the man and shoots. The wife walks in and screams. She turns and runs. The killer chases her and fires.) </p>
<p>(End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What about the little girl?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Loose end.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: [EARLIER] Dani Stewart is floating in the swimming pool in her floater. The killer walks up behind her.) </p>
<p><strong>Dani Stewart</strong>: Mommy, why is everybody screaming?</p>
<p>(End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: There are three bodies in three locations. A lot of variables. Where do you want to start?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. WOODS - DAY]</p>
<p>(The fire has been put out. Burned trees smolder from the heat.) </p>
<p>(Near the top of the hill, we see Grissom and Sara making their way up back toward the road.) </p>
<p>(They reach the top where other emergency personnel are.) </p>
<p>(Sara starts looking around. She finds something.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I've got ... the business end of a disposable lighter. Could be an ignition source.</p>
<p>(Grissom walks over to her and snaps a couple of photos. She picks it up and looks at it.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p>(Sara looks up. Grissom nods his head in a direction for her to look. He sees something.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What's that?</p>
<p>(They walk over to it. It's a smashed vodka bottle. Grissom snaps a couple of photos.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Possible accelerant.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Or possible martini.</p>
<p>(He snaps more photos.) </p>
<p>(Sara picks up the broken mouth end of the vodka bottle. She smells it.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I didn't think you could smell vodka.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, that depends on how long it was distilled.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Cheap stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Ironically, the word for vodka comes from the Russian phrase zhizennia voda. &quot;Water of life.&quot;</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. STEWART RESIDENCE - BACKYARD/POOLSIDE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(CLOSE-UP: Garden statues of three bunnies - one adult bunny and two smaller bunnies.) </p>
<p>(A tech uncaps a sample jar and gets a sample of pool water.)</p>
<p>(David Phillips walks past on his way to the house.) </p>
<p>[INT. STEWART RESIDENCE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(David Phillips walks through the dining room and approaches the stairs.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p>(Warrick is dusting the stair railing.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey, Super Dave.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: You have any idea when I might be able to process the bodies?</p>
<p>(David Phillips starts up the stairs. Warrick dabs the back of his wrist to his forehead as David walks past.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Uh ... that'd be a question for the boss lady. She's upstairs to the right.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(David heads upstairs.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. STEWART RESIDENCE - SECOND FLOOR BEDROOM -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(Catherine and Nick are in the bedroom. Nick is working behind a large piece of equipment. Catherine sets up the red laser light. She takes out a flashlight and looks at the bed sheets.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I've got some long hairs on the pillow -- brunette. Wife was a blonde.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So was the daughter, right?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, I'll collect the sheets as soon as I'm finished up here.</p>
<p>(David walks into the room.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Hey, Catherine, um, I was wondering if I ...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, I'm sorry, David. We're going to need to keep the bodies in their original position for a while longer. </p>
<p>(Catherine collects the hair strands and puts them in a bindle.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah. Crime scene this messy, gotta bust out the big guns. You know what I mean? (David leaves the room.) Hey, did you know that Ecklie volunteered the lab to evaluate this scanner for Third Tech? </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm sure he's hoping they'll give us one for free.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hmmm. I wouldn't count on it. But I am definitely going to enjoy using this while it's here. Virtual crime scene sketch. Sure beats doing it by hand.</p>
<p>(The red laser starts from the machine and scans around the room. The image is reconstructed onto the monitor.) </p>
<p>(Nick presses a couple of buttons.)</p>
<p>(On the monitor, the wire-frame of the crime scene room rotates.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - BRASS' OFFICE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Brass interviews Annabelle Frost.) </p>
<p><strong>Anabelle Frost</strong>: The whole family ... dead? Dani, too? She just had her birthday.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: How long have you been Morgan Stewart's assistant?</p>
<p><strong>Anabelle Frost</strong>: Uh ... about two years now.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Did you and Morgan ever see each other outside of work?</p>
<p><strong>Anabelle Frost</strong>: Well ... I baby-sat Dani sometimes for some extra cash. I'm putting myself through school.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We found a brown hair in his bed. Your color.</p>
<p><strong>Anabelle Frost</strong>: I wasn't sleeping with Morgan, and if you knew him, you wouldn't bother implying it. He was devoted to his wife. He was a ... he was a wonderful father.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hmm. Were you ever in his bedroom?</p>
<p><strong>Anabelle Frost</strong>: (scoffs) No.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Then you wouldn't mind giving us a sample of your hair.</p>
<p><strong>Anabelle Frost</strong>: No. Be glad to ... as soon as you show me a court order.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know how that makes you look?</p>
<p><strong>Anabelle Frost</strong>: Save it. I'm pre-law.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Greg uses a hand-held device and tests the level of hydrocarbons on the victim's burned clothes.) </p>
<p>(The beeping speeds up as Greg measures the top part of the woman's jacket near the pocket.) </p>
<p>(He puts the device down and removes something from the victim's pocket.)</p>
<p>(Grissom appears in the doorway.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I hear our victim is still alive.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I don't see why.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, she's not ready to let go yet.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: A plastic card. I found traces of alcohol all over her clothes. She was doused in it.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The accelerant and the probable ignition source were found at the top of the hill.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: That was the point of origin.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: But the victim was found, almost completely burned, at the bottom of the hill.</p>
<p>(Greg nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I don't think she was caught in the fire ...</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: [NIGHT] The woman screams as she burns. She trips and falls down the side of the hill.) </p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, according to Brass, Neal and Morgan were good friends since they were kids. Neal was good at making money, and Morgan was good at making debts.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Maybe Morgan was jealous of Neal, sleeps with Tara out of spite, Corinne finds out ...</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Third-degree burns on most of her body and she doesn't miscarry?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: A mother's body is designed to protect her baby. I don't know, all that trauma and morphine ... it'll be a miracle if she brings it to term.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Do we have any idea who the father is?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Too early to tell. She's just a few weeks pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Okay, we know that Morgan and Tara were having s*x. The broken basal thermometer we found in the bedroom implies that she was trying to conceive with him, and not her husband.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Neal could've been shooting blanks. GRISSOM: Well, medical records will confirm that.</p>
<p>CATHERINE; And Neal and Morgan were best friends ...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: ... somebody she may have felt comfortable with.</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: [STEWART RESIDENCE - BEDROOM] Morgan opens the bedroom door and finds Morgan in bed with Tara.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) Neal catches Morgan in bed with his wife ... </p>
<p><strong>Neal Matthews</strong>: Hey, buddy!</p>
<p><strong>Tara Matthews</strong>: Let me explain ... </p>
<p><strong>Neal Matthews</strong>: Shut up!</p>
<p>(Neal heads for the bedside table. He steps on the basal thermometer.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) And now, he knows where the best friend keeps his gun.</p>
<p>(He opens the bedside drawer and takes out the gun.)</p>
<p>(End of flash. Resume to present.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The glass in Neal's shoe just puts him at the scene. We didn't find any blood on the clothes we recovered from his house.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Clothes are easy to dump. The glass was an oversight; he didn't even know it was there. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Or maybe he didn't kill anybody.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Which leaves Tara.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: There was no blood on her clothes either. At least nothing at the house. And the clothes she was wearing went up in flames.</p>

[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM] </p>
<p>(Brass interviews Neal Matthews. His lawyer sits next to him.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We got a problem, Neal. We found chlorine from the Stewarts' pool on your wife's sweater. That puts her at the scene. We're going to be charging her with the murders.</p>
<p><strong>Neal Matthews</strong>: Whatever happened, Tara couldn't have done it on purpose. It must've been some sort of accident.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, the way we see it, you know, Tara went back to Morgan's house to tell him that she was pregnant with his child, and ... what, she told you the baby was yours?</p>
<p><strong>Neal Matthews</strong>: (nods) Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: And you believed her? </p>
<p><strong>Neal Matthews</strong>: We were trying to have a baby. Why wouldn't I?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, well, sure. I mean, you and Morgan are close enough in looks. She probably would've gotten away with it. </p>
<p><strong>Neal Matthews</strong>: She always said that a woman without a child of her own wasn't a woman. We tried in vitro fertilization a half a dozen times.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, we know. We subpoenaed your medical records. You had bad sperm.<br />
(Neal nods.) Anyway ... Tara went over to try to get Morgan to leave his family, he said no, she flipped out, she went nuts. She's got a history of depression, right?</p>
<p><strong>Neal Matthews</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I mean, I suppose Morgan got what he deserved. But just because you're defective doesn't mean that Tara's gonna jump in bed with him.</p>
<p><strong>Neal Matthews</strong>: I told Tara we could adopt. She wouldn't.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: And Corinne and the kid ... wrong place, wrong time, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Neal Matthews</strong>: She wanted to have a family so bad ...</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: ... and you couldn't give it to her, so she took her business elsewhere. And it didn't take long for Morgan to hit a home run ...</p>
<p><strong>Neal Matthews</strong>: Stop talking about it like that.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Look, Neal. Just because she's lying burned up in a hospital room carrying your best friend's kid ...</p>
<p>(Everyone starts shouting at each other.) </p>
<p><strong>Neal Matthews</strong>: No!</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: ... Isn't going to cut it with the D.A.</p>
<p><strong>Neal Matthews</strong>: No, I'm ...</p>
<p><strong>Brad Lewis (lawyer)</strong>: Look, Neal, not another word.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: She killed three people.</p>
<p><strong>Neal Matthews</strong>: (shouts) I want you to shut up! Just shut up!</p>
<p><strong>Brad Lewis (lawyer)</strong>: Neal, please. Let's go.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Go ahead and walk. Go ahead, let Tara take the fall. She's probably not gonna make it anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Neal Matthews</strong>: I love my wife.</p>
<p><strong>Brad Lewis (lawyer)</strong>: Please, Neal. Let's go.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We know you were there. We got a fragment from a basal thermometer found in your shoe.</p>
<p><strong>Neal Matthews</strong>: You don't know anything about her.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I know she wanted a baby more than she wanted to be your wife; I know that much. So tell me what I don't know. </p>
<p>(Neal nods and falls silent.) </p>
<p><strong>Neal Matthews</strong>: We were just hanging out, having a couple beers and I got a splinter.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [STEWART RESIDENCE - BATHROOM - DAY] The bathroom door opens.) </p>
<p><strong>Neal Matthews</strong>: (V.O.) Morgan said the tweezers were up in his bathroom.</p>
<p>(Neal opens the medicine cabinet and finds the basal thermometer. Suddenly, he knows what's going on.) </p>
<p>(End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Neal Matthews</strong>: He said it was Corinne's idea. They were just trying to help us.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: [BEDROOM] Morgan tries to explain but Neal is too angry.) </p>
<p><strong>Morgan Stewart</strong>: We did it for Tara.</p>
<p><strong>Neal Matthews</strong>: You slept with my wife!</p>
<p>(Neal starts hitting Morgan. He reaches for the gun in the bedside table drawer.) </p>
<p><strong>Morgan Stewart</strong>: No.</p>
<p>(They struggle for the gun.) </p>
<p><strong>Morgan Stewart</strong>: Corinne!</p>
<p>(Outside, Corinne is watching Dani in the pool. She turns when she hears Morgan call her.)</p>
<p>(Inside, Neal steps on the basal thermometer, breaking it.) </p>
<p><strong>Morgan Stewart</strong>: (o.s.) Corinne! Call the police!</p>
<p>(Outside, Corinne turns.) </p>
<p><strong>Dani Stewart</strong>: Mommy. I want to get out.</p>
<p><strong>Corinne Stewart</strong>: Morgan!</p>
<p>(Corinne heads for the house.)</p>
<p>(Inside, Neal shoots Morgan just as Corinne reaches the bedroom door.) </p>
<p><strong>Corinne Stewart</strong>: Morgan!</p>
<p>(Neal turns around and sees Corinne. Corinne turns and runs.)</p>
<p><strong>Corinne Stewart</strong>: Morgan!</p>
<p>(Neal gets up and follows her. There's a second gunshot.) </p>
<p>(End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Neal Matthews</strong>: She ran. She was going to call the cops. I was just trying to stop her.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You shot her.</p>
<p>(Neal Matthews nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What about Dani?</p>
<p><strong>Neal Matthews</strong>: I didn't know what else to do, so I called Tara. When she came over, saw what I'd done ... She just freaked out.</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: [STEWART RESIDENCE - DAY] Tara runs toward the house. Neal is crying as he paces back and forth in front of the pool. She hits Neal as he explains.) </p>
<p><strong>Neal Matthews</strong>: I made it look like Morgan shot Corinne and then he killed himself.</p>
<p><strong>Tara Matthews</strong>: Are you out of your mind? Do you know what you've done?</p>
<p><strong>Neal Matthews</strong>: This is all because of you.</p>
<p>(End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Neal ... what happened to Dani?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Tara turns.) </p>
<p><strong>Tara Matthews</strong>: Dani!</p>
<p>(She runs and jumps into the pool. Dani is floating inside. She grabs Dani.)</p>
<p>(End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Neal Matthews</strong>: She said we didn't deserve to live, neither one of us. And then she just ran out the door. I was afraid she was going to try to kill herself. All we wanted was a baby.</p>

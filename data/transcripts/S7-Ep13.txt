<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) – DAY]</p>
<p><strong>Radio</strong>: (V.O.) Welcome back to the voice of Las Vegas, KWMS Radio. </p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS DESERT ROAD – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(A lone car drives along the road.)</p>
<p><strong>Radio</strong>: (V.O.) The city remains in mourning, as we try to make sense of the murder of Assemblyman Danilo Zamesca. </p>
<p>(At the end of the road is another parked car. Danilo Zamesca parks his car and engages the brakes. He looks over at the driver in the next car.) </p>
<p>(Zamesca gets out of his car.) </p>
<p><strong>Radio</strong>: (V.O.) After his only son was gunned down by a drug dealer, Zamesca dedicated his life to public service. </p>
<p>(Zamesca heads over toward the other parked car. The other car door opens and a man gets out.) </p>
<p><strong>Radio</strong>: (V.O.) He set his sights on the drug traffickers and the drug suppliers. </p>
<p>(The man is holding a extra-large drink and a folded photo. He hands the photo to Zamesca.) </p>
<p><strong>Radio</strong>: (V.O.) He believed you get drugs off the streets by putting the suppliers out of business. </p>
<p>(Zamesca takes the photo, looks at it, and rips it to shreds while saying a few choice words to the man.) </p>
<p><strong>Radio</strong>: (V.O.) That was his mission. </p>
<p>(He tosses the ripped photo to the wind. A piece of the photo falls to the ground.) </p>
<p>(CLOSE-UP: It shows Zamesca doing lines with a woman with a Scorpion sign tattooed on her inner left arm.) </p>
<p><strong>Radio</strong>: (V.O.) His murder's rocked headlines, --</p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO: </p>
<p>[EXT. DESERT ROAD -- DAY TIME (PRESENT)]</p>
<p>(A corner ruler is positioned next to the photo.) </p>
<p><strong>Radio</strong>: (V.O.) -- uniting Democrats and Republicans alike, all of us asking the same question:</p>
<p>(Nick snaps a couple of photos of the picture.) </p>
<p>INSERT: FLASHBACK</p>
<p>(Zamesca turns away from the man and heads back to his car. The man tosses his extra large drink to the ground.)</p>
<p><strong>Radio</strong>: (V.O.) What happened out there?</p>
<p>BACK TO SCENE.</p>
<p>(Nick snaps several photos of the drink cup.)</p>
<p><strong>Radio</strong>: (V.O.) Peg from Sunrise Manor, you're on.</p>
<p>INSERT: FLASHBACK</p>
<p>(The man takes out a gun, points it at Zamesca's back and fires.) </p>
<p><strong>Peg</strong>: (V.O.) Danilo Zamesca spoke truth to power and got killed for it.</p>
<p>(The empty shell casing falls to the ground.) </p>
<p>BACK TO SCENE.</p>
<p>(Nick snaps photos of the empty shell casing with a ruler on the ground.) </p>
<p><strong>Peg</strong>: (V.O.) I don't think there's anybody out there who has the courage to stand up and take his place.</p>
<p>INSERT: FLASHBACK</p>
<p>(Zamesca manages to open the car door and get inside. Before he can start the engine, the gunman fires twice. Blood spatters on the passenger window.)</p>
<p>BACK TO SCENE.</p>
<p>(Nick takes more photos of the body slumped over on his side in the car. Photos of drugs in a plastic bag on the passenger seat are taken.) </p>
<p><strong>Radio</strong>: (V.O.) Roger from MacDonald Ranch.</p>
<p>(Nick picks up the plastic bag. He turns and looks over at Brass.) </p>
<p><strong>Roger</strong>: (V.O.) If this guy was pure as the driven snow, what's he doing out in the middle of nowhere with drugs in his car? Give me a break. He was dirty, just like the rest of them.</p>
<p>(Nick continues to process the evidence in the car.) </p>
<p><strong>Radio</strong>: (V.O.) Okay, Roger, thank you for calling. </p>
<p>(Brass makes a call on his radio.) </p>
<p>INSERT: FLASHBACK</p>
<p>(The gunman runs to the car, leaving shoeprints in the dirt.)</p>
<p>BACK TO SCENE.</p>
<p>(Nick snaps several photos of shoeprints in the dirt and some foam.)</p>
<p>(Catherine picks up a piece of foam and looks at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Looks like some sort of foam.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Found it next to the tire impression.</p>
<p>(Nick stands up and heads back to the car. Catherine prepares and makes a shoeprint cast.) </p>
<p>CU: BULLET</p>
<p>(The bottom of the bullet is for a PMC 9MM LUGER.) </p>
<p>[INT. CSI – BALLISTICS LAB]</p>
<p>(Bobby scans the bottom of the bullet into the computer and runs it through the database.) </p>
<p>(He finds a match.) </p>
<p>[INT. CSI -- PRINT LAB]</p>
<p>(Nick dusts for prints on drink cup cover. He finds a print on the straw.)</p>
<p>(CUT TO: He runs it through the database and finds a POSITIVE MATCH to:<br />
NAME: THOMAS SIMON<br />
DOB: JULY 21, 1972<br />
AGE: 34 HEIGHT: 5'8&quot;<br />
WEIGHT: 147 LBS. EYES: BLUE<br />
RACE: CAUCASIAN s*x: MALE<br />
HAIR: BROWN<br />

LAS VEGAS, NV 69117 </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – HALLWAY – DAY]</p>
<p>(Brass walks with Undersheriff Jeff McKeen.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So CSI got a fingerprint off the drinking straw we found at the scene.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff McKeen</strong>: Guys like Thomas Simon never get their hands dirty.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No. It was a very clean print. And Ballistics matched some shell casings that we found at Simon's McMansion on that raid last year.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff McKeen</strong>: Did you find the gun?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No. So Zamesca was trying to put Simon out of business, and it cost him his life.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) – NIGHT]</p>
<p>[INT. STRIP CLUB – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Girls dance on stage, music blaring. The club is sparsely filled. Several officers enter the club, looking for someone. Brass walks in and looks at Officer Mitchell, who shakes his head and indicates that the person they're looking for isn't there.) </p>
<p>(Brass turns and heads for the bartender. He shows him his badge.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hey. I have a warrant for Thomas Simon. Is he here?</p>
<p><strong>Bartender</strong>: He's the owner, man. But even I haven't seen him in, like, three weeks. Sorry.</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>
<p>[INT. RESTAURANT – DAY]</p>
<p>(Undersheriff Jeff McKeen meets with Brass, Catherine and Keppler over breakfast.) </p>
<p><strong>Jeff Mckeen</strong>: The biggest drug supplier on the West Coast kills a public official, and we can't find him. I'm just the undersheriff. I have one job: make the sheriff look smart. You're not helping.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We busted our hump trying to find this guy.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Science can only do so much with a cold trail.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff McKeen</strong>: You ever seen a man's face change into that kind of a demon?</p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: My eggs are runny. I couldn't have been more specific with the waitress. (to Brass) You gonna eat those?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, you want my pancakes? Yeah, sure, knock yourself out. Here.</p>
<p>(Keppler switches plates with Brass.) </p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff McKeen</strong>: I don't hear a solution.</p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: We could try something I did in Philly. It's, um, a little unorthodox.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff McKeen</strong>: I only want to know if it works.</p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: Philly, yes. Baltimore, no.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Is that why you're in Vegas?</p>
<p>(Keppler smiles a little.) </p>
<p><strong>Jeff McKeen</strong>: Fifty-fifty. I can live with those odds.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, are you waiting for a drum roll?</p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: It's called &quot;reverse forensics.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh. We fake a crime scene.</p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: Basically.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff McKeen</strong>: How do we get around entrapment?</p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: Well, it's not entrapment if you're not enticing anyone to commit a crime. The goal is to make Simon think he's off the hook.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So what's the catch?</p>
<p>(Catherine gets it and doesn't like it.) </p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: Whole thing's a catch. The hardest part is stopping leaks. You've got to be willing to deceive the people you work with.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Assuming they can be deceived, which they can't.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff McKeen</strong>: Not your call.</p>
<p>(Catherine definitely doesn't like it.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know, I can think of nine, no, ten ways that this could screw up.</p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: At least.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff McKeen</strong>: So don't screw it up.</p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: The first thing we need is a victim, somebody we own. You need a fall guy to play the role of &quot;killer,&quot; somebody who's jake with having his mug shot everywhere. In Baltimore, we used a snitch. So you're going to have to bring the DA into this.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff McKeen</strong>: (scoffs) The DA?</p>
<p>(He shakes his head.) </p>
<p><strong>Jeff McKeen</strong>: That bitch won't like it. (to Keppler) Thanks for breakfast.</p>
<p>(McKeen stands up and leaves.) </p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: You ever notice how it's the, uh, guys with all the money that never pay?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Sure, that's how they keep all the money. (Brass offers his portion.)<br />
Here, let me get it.</p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: No, I got it. New guy.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: You know, Catherine, if we do our job right and catch the bad guy, nobody's going to remember the rest.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'll remember.</p>
<p>FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[INT. CSI – HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Warrick walks in carrying a file box, a couple of evidence envelopes and wearing a suit. He walks into the evidence room and finds Keppler there leafing through the filing cabinet.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey, Mike.</p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: Hey. Do you guys, uh, organize your files by case number?</p>
<p>(Warrick signs in a clipboard.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: In a perfect world. We hired this, uh, knucklehead named Mahoney. He had this dyslexic filing system. </p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: So what do you think? Does the dyslexic atheist not believe in dog?</p>
<p>(Keppler pulls out the file for DANILO ZAMESCA.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What? </p>
<p>(Warrick looks up and sees the file folder a second before Keppler pulls it out of the cabinet. Keppler turns and looks at Warrick.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Oh ... I get it.</p>
<p>(Keppler closes the file cabinet.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – LOCKER ROOM]</p>
<p>(Nick shuts his locker and tucks his gun in his holster. He heads out.) </p>
<p>(Catherine finds him.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey. I need you on a 411 tonight. </p>
<p>(She gives him the assignment paper.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Stolen motor vehicles? You got to be kidding me.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: PD recovered twenty stolen motorcycles. They're at the Dupont Towing Lot.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Can't you slide it to days?</p>
<p>(Warrick walks by.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey, guys.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Take Warrick with you. It'll go faster.</p>
<p>(Catherine leaves.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (amused) Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What'll go faster?</p>
<p>(Nick gives Warrick the assignment sheet.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Giddyup.</p>
<p>(Nick turns and heads down the hallway. Warrick looks at the assignment sheet and follows him out.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. ALLEYWAY – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(A stray cat meows and runs across the alleyway. Rat is selling drugs to a kid. He takes the kid's money and gives him a pack of drugs. The kid turns and runs.) </p>
<p>(Brass walks up to Rat.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What's happening, Rat? (They wave to each other.) Boy, you got to love junkies, huh? What stamina, what willpower. I mean, even the rain doesn't keep them away.</p>
<p><strong>Edward &quot;Rat&quot; Dennison</strong>: It doesn't keep the cops away either, I guess, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You nervous, Rat? Relax, relax, I'm just here to talk. Listen, you like game shows? Because I got a deal; listen to this. First place is a life-changing experience. You get a whole new life.</p>
<p><strong>Edward &quot;Rat&quot; Dennison</strong>: What's second place?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: There is no second place, Rat. Either way, you don't get to work the alley anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Edward &quot;Rat&quot; Dennison</strong>: Screw you.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Screw me? No, no. Screw you. </p>
<p>(Brass reaches into Rat's shirt pocket and pulls out a packet of drugs.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Look, take my deal. Otherwise, you're in possession of a controlled substance, and with your record, that's a mandatory sentence.</p>
<p><strong>Edward &quot;Rat&quot; Dennison</strong>: Okay. If you want information, just ask me. Just that I'm ...</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: All right, let's walk, walk with me.</p>
<p>(Brass and Rat walk along the alleyway.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: It's a little complicated. You own a gun?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – TRACE LAB --] </p>
<p>(Hodges is on the phone.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: (to phone) That's K-E-P-P-L-E-R, Michael Keppler. </p>
<p>(Just out in the hallway, we see Sara walk past, a box tucked under her arm.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: (to phone) Yeah, check it out. Okay, I got to go.</p>
<p>(He hangs up the phone.) </p>
<p>(Sara stops and watches Keppler put up sheeting over the glass windows to block out prying eyes. She watches for a moment, then stops Catherine on her way in.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What's going on?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Um, nothing I can talk about. Keep me posted on the 419. Greg's going to meet you at the scene.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(Catherine enters the lab and closes the door.)</p>
<p>(Hodges slides up next to Sara.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: (in confidence) Ten to one, it's Internal Affairs. Got a vibe off Keppler the minute he blew in. Always with a suit. If you got any dirty laundry, I hope you used bleach.</p>
<p>(Sara hugs the box to her and heads out to the – </p>
<p>[INT. CSI – LOCKER ROOM – NIGHT – CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(The locker room is empty. Sara walks in and opens her locker. She looks as if she's going to put the box in the locker, then she has second thoughts. She looks at the label and sits down on the bench. The label reads:</p>
<p>(TO)<br />
SARA SIDLE<br />

LAS VEGAS, NV 89156</p>
<p>(FROM)<br />
GRISSOM<br />
WALDEN POND RESEARCH CENTER<br />
CONCORD, MA 01742-4511</p>
<p>(She cuts the tape and opens the box. She lifts up the packing paper and finds a branch with a cocoon. She smiles. How Grissom.)</p>
<p>(She picks up the branch and looks at it. She digs further into the box and finds the box empty. That is the only thing in the box. She shakes her head. How Grissom.) </p>
<p>(She puts the packing paper back in the box, looks at the branch and sighs.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LVPD IMPOUND LOT 17 – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Warrick and Nick are outside the impound gate. They press the buzzer. The lot attendant opens the gate.) </p>
<p><strong>Lot Attendant</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I'm CSI Stokes, this is Brown.</p>
<p><strong>Lot Attendant</strong>: Where's your paperwork?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: We're from the Crime Lab, dude.</p>
<p><strong>Lot Attendant</strong>: I still need paperwork.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We're here to process those stolen motorcycles, man.</p>
<p><strong>Lot Attendant</strong>: I need authorization, fellas, in writing.</p>
<p>(And with that, the lot attendant closes the gate. He leaves Nick and Warrick outside the lot.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Wh-What if, what if I promise to come back and give it to you later?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Okay, cut us some slack here, man. You think we really feel like being down here?</p>
<p>(The gates clang shut.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: How do you want to handle this?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You want to shoot our way in?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'd love to bust a cap in his knee.</p>
<p>(Nick chuckles.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Sir, don't make us call your supervisor. Now, come on. (bangs on door)<br />
Come on!</p>

[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) – NIGHT]</p>
<p>[INT. APARTMENT -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(David Phillips picks up a maggot off the maggot-infested face of the dead body in the motel room.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: (exhales) We got third Instar maggots. </p>
<p>(Sara snaps photos around the apartment.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: With this smell, she's been dead at least 48 hours.</p>
<p>(Sara looks at the contents on the table – drug paraphernalia and pizza boxes.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Toys are all here. Needle, syringe, tubing, candle, spoon.</p>
<p>(Sofia walks into the room. Sara picks up what looks like a black drop wrapped in plastic.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It looks like heroin.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Manager said he found her like this when he came by for a visit. Said they were friends, but he was a little unclear of her name. Monique something or other.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Maybe she was, uh, working off the rent.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: No ID on the body.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: I'll take a look around for it.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, without actually shooting the guy, this scene is going to be slightly less than perfect, but it's just you and me out there.</p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: No, can't be. We're going to need a third person processing the scene to make it look kosher -- someone who's not in on it.</p>

<p>(They walk out of the hallway. Undersheriff Jeff McKeen enters the waiting room where the reporters are gathered.) </p>
<p><strong>Jeff McKeen</strong>: Good afternoon. </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – BREAK ROOM – NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(In the breakroom, Nick is eating and watching the press conference on the television.) </p>
<p><strong>Jeff McKeen</strong>: (from tv) The Las Vegas Police Department has successfully apprehended a suspect, one Edwin Dennison, who's confessed of multiple homicides, including that of Assemblyman Danilo Zamesca.</p>
<p>(The caption on the set reads:<br />
UNDERSHERIFF MCKEEN PRESS CONFERENCE<br />
ASSEMBLYMAN ZAMESCA'S MURDERER ARRESTED )</p>
<p>(Nick definitely doesn't like this.) </p>
<p><strong>Jeff McKeen</strong>: (from tv) Mr. Dennison admitted to luring Mr. Zamesca to a remote location, while seeking his help to escape the drug trade. When Mr. Zamesca encouraged him to surrender to police, Mr. Dennison shot him. He later shot Mr. Holstein during a dispute over a drug deal.</p>
<p>(Nick is more than pissed. He throws the remainder of his sandwich away and heads out of the breakroom.) </p>
<p><strong>Jeff McKeen</strong>: (from tv) I'd like to say how very proud I am of the swift and efficient work done that my department has done in tracking down and apprehending this dangerous criminal ...</p>

[INT. CSI – BALLISTICS LAB -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Keppler enters the Ballistics Lab and finds Warrick working on the bullet.) </p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: You know that Dawson guy gets kind of uptight when people touch his stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, the Holstein scene bullet was fired from the same gun that you found in Rat's car.</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: Keppler fires the bullet in the Ballistics Lab.) </p>
<p>(Cut to: Catherine tosses the bullet into the front seat of the car.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: Done deal.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'm not so sure. If this bullet went through the window and a guy's head ... it would have pieces of glass and bits of bone in it.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI flash of: A gun fires. The bullet breaks through the glass and goes through the person's brain. It comes out the other side and falls onto the front seat of the car – a mess.) </p>
<p>(End of CGI flash.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: This hollow point's clean. There's no sand-blasted effect.</p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: Hmm. The DNA sample yet, might have been cleaned already.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: There's still blood on it.</p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: I see your point. Maybe autopsy will show something.</p>
<p>(Keppler turns and leaves the lab. Warrick notes he doesn't appear concerned at all.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – EVIDENCE LOCKER -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Nick is looking for the evidence in the Holstein case. Catherine walks past and stops in the room.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, Nick. </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I can't find the evidence in the Holstein case.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What do you want it for?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Because that guy who confessed to killing Zamesca didn't do it. Sheriff's jumping the gun.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We have evidence and a confession. You can't just come in here and take over my case. </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Is there a reason you don't want me to see that file, Catherine?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Nick, as your supervisor, I'm ordering you to back off.</p>
<p>(Catherine turns and leaves. Nick definitely doesn't like it at all.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. SIDEWALK -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Greg opens the door for Sara. They exit the building.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (to Greg) Thanks.</p>
<p>(They join Nick and Warrick, who are already waiting outside.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Uh, it's freezing. Why are we having a meeting outside?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: 'Cause Catherine and Keppler are in there.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: What, have you guys been listening to Hodges?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No, and this isn't about Keppler being IA anyway. This is about Catherine having a false confession and standing by it.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You'd better be able to back that one up, man.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Zamesca knew Sara's and Greg's vic. He's dead, she's dead, same drugs are found at both scenes, and then ... those same drugs showed up at your crime scene?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Could have come from the same supplier. </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: We see that all the time. I don't think it's a coincidence.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (hesitates, voice lowers) You know, Catherine ... (glances behind her) ... Catherine ordered Henry to step out of his lab without putting drug evidence away.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Why would she do that?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I did see Keppler checking out Zamesca's file yesterday. I didn't think anything strange about it then, but now ...</p>
<p>(Sara again looks around.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Okay, so ... maybe there is an IA investigation.</p>
<p>(Nick doesn't want to say it.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I can't find the Holstein evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What?</p>
<p>(Nick nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Catherine put it in a temporary locker.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah. Why didn't she put it where it belongs?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: The Holstein bullet was a little bit too clean, and Keppler didn't seem at all concerned about it. He said that we would see at autopsy.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, it's kind of hard to have an autopsy when you don't have a body, man. I talked to Doc Robbins; he's still trying to track it down. And the mortuary has no record of Catherine's phone call whatsoever.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Do we have access to any of the Holstein evidence?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We got the car.</p>
<p>(Warrick remembers something.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Catherine sent it to the impound.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, at least we know where it is.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: All right, that's it. We're a team now, the four of us. We can't trust Catherine and we can't trust Keppler. I'm serious. I'm gonna run with this one.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (nods) I'll run with you.</p>
<p>(Nick slaps Warrick's shoulder. He knew he could count on him.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (to Sara) You?</p>
<p>(Sara looks at Nick as she weighs it. Then -- </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'm in.</p>
<p>(They turn and look at Greg.) </p>
<p>(Greg nods.) </p>
<p>(Nick nods. It's settled. He heads inside.) </p>

<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[EXT. LVPD IMPOUND LOT 17 -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(A tow truck exits the open gate. Nick walks in. The lot attendant turns and sees Nick. He tries to stop him.) </p>
<p><strong>Lot Attendant</strong>: Hey. Hey, you!</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Try to stop me and I'll have you put in jail.</p>
<p>(The lot attendant backs off. Nick heads over to the car. He cuts the seal open.) </p>
<p>(Nick opens the car door and checks the blood spatter on the seats, on the door and on the inside car window.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – GRISSOM'S OFFICE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Sara is in Grissom ‘s office. The box delivered to him from 7X11, &quot;Leaving Las Vegas,&quot; is still on his desk. Sara slides some magazines on his desk closer to her and toward the top drawer. She opens the desk drawer, reaches under the small animal skull and pulls out a key. In one smooth movement, she tucks the key under the magazines and things, closes the desk drawer and heads out.) </p>
<p>(We linger on the large unopened box on Grissom's desk.) </p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (from phone) Never.</p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[INT. CSI – EVIDENCE (TEMPORARY) LOCKER -- NIGHT] </p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Got the evidence yet?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (to phone) You know what? Sara's here. And she has the key. Got to go.</p>
<p>(Sara shows Warrick the key. She's still hesitant about all of this.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You know. I really hate deceiving people because, eventually, you get what you give.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I hate being deceived.</p>
<p>(Sara unlocks the door and she opens it. Inside are two boxes marked HOLSTEIN.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p>(Warrick grabs the first box and heads back to the table.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: All right.</p>
<p>(Sara reaches for the second box.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Anything I collected, we ignore.</p>
<p>(Warrick cuts the seal.) </p>

<p>(Nick is in Trace processing his own samples. He runs several samples through the machines.) </p>
<p>(Hodges returns.)</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: You running your own samples? Smart, considering that you're the odds-on favorite in the IA pool.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: There's a pool now?</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Who's number two?</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: That would be me.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Number three?</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Grissom.</p>
<p>(The machine beeps. Hodges reaches for the printout, but Nick stops him. Hodges backs off. He tries to look at it, but Nick folds it in half. Nick leaves the lab.) </p>
<p>(When Nick leaves, Hodges presses REPRINT on the printer. The printer reprints the results.)</p>
<p>OPERATOR: HODGES<br />
ACQUIRED: 01/25/07 14:39<br />

<p>(Warrick places the driver's window glass on the table. He examines it and finds something. Nick walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: How's it going in here?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: This glass wasn't shot out. Take a look at that.</p>
<p>(Warrick steps aside to let Nick look through the magnifying glass.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Spark plug?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: The only mark a spark plug makes is a nick at the center. Now, who would know about that? </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Crooks. And cops. And, hey, get this. The blood found in Holstein's car had high levels of EDTA. Anti-coagulant.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Means the blood didn't come from his head; it came from his arm.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: That means this crime scene was staged.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, if Keppler is IA, Catherine can't tell us anything if she wanted to.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, if this is all IA BS, then why would they play it out in the press?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Maybe Brass can help us out. </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – HALLWAY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Warrick enters the hallway. He sees Brass exit his office. Warrick starts toward Brass and starts to call out to him, but stops.) </p>
<p>(Keppler steps out of Brass's office and they talk.)</p>
<p>(Warrick watches them for a moment. They appear to be on the same page and very friendly.)</p>
<p>(Brass and Keppler both turn and look at Warrick.) </p>
<p>(Warrick backs away and leaves without speaking to Brass. Brass walks over to the group of officers in the hallway.) </p>

<p>(Thomas Simon looks up.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (loudly) Thomas Simon, you're under arrest! You two -- step over there.</p>
<p>(The girl and the man Thomas Simon was with leave. The overhead music stops.) </p>
<p><strong>Thomas Simon</strong>: Is there a problem, Detective?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: A problem? We're charging you with the murder of Danilo Zamesca.</p>
<p><strong>Thomas Simon</strong>: You already got a guy for that murder. I saw it on the news.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, it's good to meet an informed citizen.</p>
<p>(Officer Mitchell finds a gun.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer Mitchell</strong>: Nine-millimeter.</p>

<p><strong>Man</strong>: There's no way you'll get a jury to believe this evidence wasn't fabricated.</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: We're done here.</p>
<p>(She stands up and heads out. She slows and looks at Jeff McKeen as she passes him.)</p>
<p>(The team of attorneys leaves. Brass steps out into the hallway and sighs.) </p>
<p><strong>Jeff McKeen</strong>: All right. Which one of you screwed this up?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'm looking at him. You dropped the ball, man. You never cleared this operation with the DA, and now, she says she can't tell fact from fiction. She's not going to file charges against Simon.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff McKeen</strong>: She's a tight-ass. I told her what I thought she needed to know.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Did you hear what I said? Now, what are you going to tell the sheriff?</p>

<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Reverse forensics?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Simon had to believe it when he saw it on the news.</p>
<p><strong>Keppler</strong>: He was a fugitive. The only way to get him to show his face was to make him think he was off the hook.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: And your only option was to fabricate evidence and make me process it?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: How could you think that we wouldn't figure it out? It's kind of what we do.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I understand how you all feel. I am sorry. I did not have a choice.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: We trust you with our lives, Catherine. You could have trusted us with this.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Sara?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: If I have something to say to you, Catherine, I'm gonna say it in private. No offense.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay, look. We can still get Simon. He only walked on Zamesca. He drove Monique Carter's vehicle out into the desert. Nick's established that. Did he kill her, too?</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Furniture.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: If Simon was hiding out here for a couple of weeks, he had to eat, sleep and use the bathroom. So, what did the cleaners miss?</p>
<p>(Sara takes out the crime scene photos and compares it to the room.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: There used to be a pillow here. Maybe ... he slept on the couch. I'm going to pull some hair 'cause you never know.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: We'd have to get a court order to compel a DNA sample from Simon. That takes time. Brass can only stall this guy's release for a couple hours, you know.</p>
<p>(Sara does a tape lift and finds a lot of hairs.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah, it's going to take days to sort through these.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You are aware that you talk about the killer in the first person?</p>

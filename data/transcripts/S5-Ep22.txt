<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - HALLWAY / DNA LAB -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(The camera follows Catherine down the hallway toward the DNA lab. Catherine steps into the lab. Mia Dickerson, working at the table, looks up.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>Mia Dickerson</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p>(Catherine takes the two swab boxes out of the plastic bag and holds them out for Mia.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Husband and wife got into it.</p>
<p><strong>Mia Dickerson</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p>(Mia takes the swabs from Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Mia Dickerson</strong>: Hmm. What set them off?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: She caught him with a hooker in their bed. She cut him. He killed her.</p>
<p><strong>Mia Dickerson</strong>: What about the hooker?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: She grabbed his wallet and took off. I caught the guy just sitting on a curb. I swabbed his hands for blood spatter.</p>
<p><strong>Mia Dickerson</strong>: I am super backed up. Can this wait till tomorrow?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (shrugs) He's not going anywhere. Thanks, Mia.</p>
<p>(Catherine turns, walks out of the lab and into the hallway.) </p>
<p>(She sees Warrick and Nick turn the corner talking with each other.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah ...</p>
<p>(She joins them, putting an arm around each of them.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, hey, guys. I could really use a drink. You want to join me? I'm buying.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'd love a drink, but we made plans, though.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You did?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Rain check.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: All right. </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Rain check.</p>
<p>(Nick and Warrick both continue down the hallway, leaving Catherine alone.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (sighs) Okay.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. HIGHBALL - FRONT - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(A group of women walk toward the entrance as a taxi drives away.) </p>
<p>[INT. HIGHBALL -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Catherine sits at the bar talking with Adam Novak.) </p>
<p><strong>Adam Novak</strong>: No way you were never married. Oh, let me guess. You were young, he seemed more mature than he really was, he swept you off your feet, and, uh, he let you fall.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Bruised, but not broken.</p>
<p>(The bartender checks on them.) </p>
<p><strong>Bartender</strong>: Get you another one?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No, I'm good, thanks.</p>
<p>(Adam lightly brushes his fingertips up and down Catherine's bare arm.) </p>
<p><strong>Adam Novak</strong>: So you're divorced?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (nods somewhat) You?</p>
<p><strong>Adam Novak</strong>: Yeah. She seemed more mature than she really was; swept me off my feet. </p>
<p>(She chuckles.) </p>
<p><strong>Adam Novak</strong>: Kids?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Uh, yes, I have a daughter.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Novak</strong>: If she's got her mother's looks, you're in trouble.</p>
<p>(He leans in closer to her and whispers into her ear. Catherine chuckles.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: If I don't get home soon, I will be in trouble. </p>
<p>(Catherine finishes her drink.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Thanks. I needed this.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Novak</strong>: If you're blowing me off, no worries.</p>
<p>(He opens a matchbook and writes his phone number down inside the lid.) </p>
<p><strong>Adam Novak</strong>: But if you're not ... (He gives her the matchbook.) ... give me a call.</p>
<p>(Catherine takes it and puts it in her bag. She turns to leave. He stops her.) </p>
<p><strong>Adam Novak</strong>: Wait a second. Let me walk you to your car.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. HIGHBALL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Catherine and Adam Novak are kissing in front of her car. Catherine pushes him away.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I can't do this tonight. I ... I'll call you.</p>
<p>(Catherine opens the car door. Not liking the brush off, Adam shuts the door on Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Adam Novak</strong>: What the hell is your problem?</p>
<p>(Catherine tries to tug the door open, but he holds it shut on her.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Go to hell.</p>
<p>(She pulls and he lets go. The door opens, hitting Catherine in the cheekbone. She groans.) </p>
<p>(He leans in close to her.) </p>
<p><strong>Adam Novak</strong>: You're not worth the trouble.</p>
<p>(Adam Novak leaves.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CATHERINE'S RESIDENCE - BEDROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(The phone rings. Catherine groans and sighs. The phone continues to ring.) </p>
<p>(She answers it.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to phone) Hello.</p>
<p>[INT. CATHERINE'S RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT -- LATER] </p>
<p>(Dressed, Catherine sneaks over to her mother sleeping on the couch.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (whispers) Mom, Mom. Grissom just called. I've got to go in. I'm backing up grave.</p>
<p>(Catherine's mother wakes up and sniffs.)</p>
<p><strong>Lily Flynn</strong>: What? Vodka, with an Altoid chaser.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I brushed my teeth. </p>
<p>(She notices the cut on Catherine's cheek.) </p>
<p><strong>Lily Flynn</strong>: What did you do, walk into a door?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, listen, Lindsey's got a dentist appointment before school. I wrote all the information down in the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>Lily Flynn</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay? Thank you.</p>
<p>(Catherine's mom settles to go back to sleep.) </p>
<p><strong>Lily Flynn</strong>: Oh, good grief, girl.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. GARAGE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Catherine walks over to the crime scene. Lights flash around her. Off screen, we hear a camera snap.) </p>
<p>(In the parking structure, David Phillips checks the body while Grissom snaps photos.) </p>
<p>(Catherine walks up to them.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I appreciate this. Everyone's out. I'm short.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You're welcome.</p>
<p>(Catherine looks at the body as Grissom snaps more photos. She notes that the victim's head is covered by her jacket.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Clotted blood hasn't retracted yet.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: She hasn't been dead long.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We have an ID?</p>
<p>(Det. Vartann joins them.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Yeah, building manager took a peek. ID'd her as Alice Granger. Apartment 207. Moved here about a month ago.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: David, you want to take the, uh, jacket off her face?</p>
<p>(David Phillips removes the jacket to show that the woman is blonde. Grissom looks at Catherine and notices the cut on her cheek.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What happened to you?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I walked into a door. Can we not talk about it?</p>
<p>(David checks the wound on the top of the victim's head.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Gunshot. Looks like a small caliber weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No cartridge casings.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: No purse, no car. I put out a bolo. Possible car jacking.</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: [GARAGE - NIGHT] Alice Granger is in the garage when a person with a gun comes up behind her. The woman takes off running. The person follows her. She falls and is shot.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Usually when a killer covers the victim's face, it suggests familiarity. An act of contrition.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [NIGHT] Alice Granger is dead. The killer drapes her jacket over her face.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (nods) Maybe she knew her attacker.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Great. Carjacked by a friend.</p>
<p>(Det. Vartann's phone rings. He answers it.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: (to phone) Vartann. Yeah, got it. (He hangs up.) We got a 20 on her car.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You go; I'll stay with the body. I'll meet you there. </p>
<p>(Catherine nods.) </p>
<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO: </p>
<p>[INT. CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Catherine follows the officer's car to the next crime scene. They pull up in front of the Highball.) </p>
<p>(In the reflection of the rear view mirror, we see Catherine's eyes widen as she realizes where they are.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. HIGHBALL - PARKING LOT -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Catherine looks around the place as she and Det. Vartann head over to the officer standing near Alice Granger's car.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: You see anybody get out of the car?</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: No, sir. Saw it on patrol.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: You checked the bar?</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: I waited for you. No one's exited since we got here.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Okay, I'll see you inside.</p>
<p>(The officer leaves. Catherine looks inside the car through the windows.) </p>
<p>(She looks around, then at the technicians standing nearby.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Can you open it up?</p>
<p><strong>Technician</strong>: Uh, yes, ma'am.</p>
<p>(The technician jimmies the lock and opens the car door for Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>(She looks inside the driver's side. Under the car seat, she finds a gun.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I found a gun under the seat. </p>
<p>(Grissom joins them. Catherine takes the gun out and shows it to them.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: .22 Beretta.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, that's small enough to be the weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: So he shoots her, takes her car, and stops off for a drink. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He could still be in there.</p>
<p>(Catherine stops examining the gun and looks at them.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Let's find out.</p>
<p>(Det. Vartann turns and heads into the bar.) </p>
<p>(Grissom holds a bag open.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did you hear the one about the cop and the monkey who walk into a bar?</p>
<p>(Catherine puts the gun in the bag.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm not in the mood.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Neither was the monkey.</p>
<p>FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[INT. HIGHBALL -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>[SLOW MOTION]</p>
<p>(Det. Vartann and Catherine walk into the bar. Catherine looks around at the various people still at the bar. Her eyes settle on the blonde-haired bartender<br />
- the same one who served her drinks earlier in the night.) </p>
<p>[RESUME MOTION]</p>
<p>(The officer reports to Det. Vartann.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Except for the Saturn, all the cars in the lot are accounted for.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>(The officer leaves. Det. Vartann starts to question the bartender.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Hi. You recognize this girl?</p>
<p>(Catherine walks up to the bar.) </p>
<p><strong>Bartender</strong>: Yeah. She's been in a few times.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: How about last night?</p>
<p><strong>Bartender</strong>: (nods) Yeah.</p>
<p>(The bartender turns and looks at Catherine. She recognizes Catherine from earlier. Catherine shakes her head.) </p>
<p><strong>Bartender</strong>: Throwing them back pretty good, too.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: You see anybody hassle her?</p>
<p><strong>Bartender</strong>: She was getting a lot of attention. She didn't really seem to mind.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Did you see her leave with anyone?</p>
<p><strong>Bartender</strong>: No. She was wasted. Had me call her a cab.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Around what time?</p>
<p><strong>Bartender</strong>: We were really slammed. Maybe 2:00 ... 2:30.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Which cab company?</p>
<p><strong>Bartender</strong>: Lucky Cab.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Well, that would explain why her car's still here.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Doesn't explain the gun.</p>
<p>(Det. Vartann turns and walks away. Catherine leans toward the bartender.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (whispers) Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Bartender</strong>: Why? Do I know you?</p>
<p>(Catherine smiles, turns and leaves.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Robbins goes over the body with Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: I dug it out of the right frontal cortex. The bullet lacerated the right occipital lobe. It crossed the mid-line, destroying the vital structures of the brain and bounced off the left frontal calvarium.</p>
<p>(Grissom looks at the bullet.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hmm. This is a .25 caliber.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: What, disappointed?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We found a .22 in the victim's car. This just ruled that out as the murder weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: So shoot me. (Robbins goes back to the victim.) Stellate tear means close contact. See the muzzle impression around the entrance wound?</p>
<p>(Grissom leans in for a closer look of the muzzle impression on the top of the shaved victim's head.) </p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV of: The muzzle of the gun is close to the victim's head. The gun fires. The smoke clears, leaving an impression on the scalp.) </p>
<p>(End of CGI POV. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This could help identify the firearm.</p>
<p>(Grissom takes a ruler and measures the angle of the entry wound.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This is an unusual point of entry.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Yeah, I measured the trajectory. Ten to 15 degrees left of vertical.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Shooter would have to be standing over her.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Which would make him a giant, except for this.</p>
<p>(Robbins lifts up the sheet and shows Grissom her knees.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Abrasions on her knees.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So ... maybe she was kneeling.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Begging for her life.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Sara and Catherine go over the victim's clothes. Sara takes out a credit card from the pocket.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So, Judge Wilson tells me I'd have better luck with a blue suit than a gray suit. What is that? Do you think he meant that? Do you think he was flirting with me or ... ?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I thought judges were supposed to be color blind.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah, right. That's cute.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I found some particulate on the jacket. Not sure what it is. I'll get it to Hodges.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Pocket contents: Credit card, car keys, lipstick and one matchbook.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Can I see that?</p>
<p>(Sara shows it to Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: There's no name, just a phone number.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [HIGHBALL - NIGHT] Adam Novak writes down his number on a matchbook. He gives it to Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Adam Novak</strong>: Give me a call.</p>
<p>(Catherine takes the matchbook.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'll have Vartann run it down.</p>
<p>(Sara opens the matchbook.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You know, I've got to go pick up Lindsey. Could you cover for me?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p>(Catherine stands and heads out of the lab.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Tell her I said, &quot;hey.&quot;</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CAR (MOVING) -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Catherine drives home and pulls up the driveway. She engages the brakes.) </p>
<p>[INT. CATHERINE'S HOUSE - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Catherine rushes into the house and goes to the kitchen to check the garbage. The bin is empty.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Lindsey!</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What happened to the trash?</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey</strong>: I took it out, like you always tell me to. It's Thursday.</p>
<p>(Catherine sighs.) </p>
<p><strong>Lindsey</strong>: Uh, hello, Mom, you okay?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, I'm great.</p>
<p>(Catherine's mom steps into the kitchen and follows Catherine through the living room.) </p>
<p><strong>Lily Flynn</strong>: Are you sure about that? You want me to be the babysitter, but you want me to be deaf and blind too? </p>
<p>(Catherine heads back out the front door.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Can't get into this now, Mother. I'm in a jam.</p>
<p><strong>Lily Flynn</strong>: You haven't seen your daughter all week.</p>
<p>(Catherine steps outside, her mother following her.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Save the sermon.</p>
<p><strong>Lily Flynn</strong>: I was a working mother too, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to herself) There but for the grace of God ... </p>
<p><strong>Lily Flynn</strong>: Don't just assume that my time means nothing to me.</p>
<p>(Catherine lifts the curb-side trash bin lid up and finds it empty.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Damn it.</p>
<p>(She shuts it and heads back to the car.) </p>
<p><strong>Lily Flynn</strong>: Catherine?</p>
<p>(Catherine's phone rings.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I threw something away. It's gone.</p>
<p><strong>Lily Flynn</strong>: You're throwing more than you know away.</p>
<p>(Catherine opens her car door and answers her phone.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to phone) Yeah? Uh ... yeah, just wait till I get there. Yeah. </p>
<p>(Catherine hangs up. She turns to look at her mom.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mom ...</p>
<p><strong>Lily Flynn</strong>: Go. Go. I'll be here when you get back.</p>
<p>(Catherine's mom turns and heads back into the house, leaving Catherine standing by the car.) </p>

<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Results from Alice Granger's jacket. Found trace elements of iron, chromium, manganese and carbon.</p>

<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: More specific, automotive sheet metal. The metallic balls would've been released into the air during the welding process.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: A person welding and the sparks flying. End of flash.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So you're saying our killer has metal balls?</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Yes ... maybe. Turns out that the victim worked in a car dealership, so she could've gotten metal balls on the job. And just in case you're wondering, working here, I'm developing them too. </p>

<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Bullet is a .25 auto caliber Winchester full metal jacket. You can't shoot .25s from a .22 caliber pistol.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Which means the semi-automatic you found in Alice Granger's car isn't the murder weapon.</p>

<p><strong>Douglas Granger</strong>: I don't understand why you're asking me this. I'm her brother, not her husband.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: You still own a lot of guns. A .22 pistol, Colt .25, among others.</p>
<p><strong>Douglas Granger</strong>: That's right.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We found the .22 in Alice's car.</p>
<p>(Douglas Granger sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Douglas Granger</strong>: If she carried it in her purse instead of leaving it in the car, she might still be alive.</p>
<p>(Det. Vartann glances at Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: I don't follow.</p>
<p><strong>Douglas Granger</strong>: I gave her the gun last week.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Then what? You shot her with your .25?</p>
<p><strong>Douglas Granger</strong>: Are you insane? It's no mystery who killed her. </p>
<p>(Quick flash from Catherine's POV of Douglas Granger.)</p>
<p><strong>Douglas Granger</strong>: Jeff Simon, her ex-boyfriend. Guy was stalking her. </p>
<p>(Quick flash from Catherine's POV of Douglas Granger's clasped hands and face.)</p>
<p><strong>Douglas Granger</strong>: She changed her phone number, changed jobs, moved a half dozen times. No matter where she went, there he was. Last week, I was over at her new apartment. Jerk sitting in his truck, in front of the building.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Is that when you gave her the gun?</p>
<p>(He sighs.) </p>
<p><strong>Douglas Granger</strong>: Taught her how to shoot it. Helped her get a restraining order. Got zero help from you guys. &quot;Catch him in the act.&quot; That's all we heard.</p>

<p><strong>Jeff Simon</strong>: I didn't kill Alice. I loved her.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Is that your idea of love? Stalking her with a GPS unit?</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Simon</strong>: I wasn't stalking her. I wo-worried about her.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: So that restraining order she filed against you was because you're a nice guy.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Simon</strong>: Let me tell you about Alice. She ... liked to party ...</p>

<p><strong>Jeff Simon</strong>: She needed me to look out for her.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, there's a problem with your story. She called a cab.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Simon</strong>: I'm telling you, Alice got into a Chrysler or... a Buick? It was blue, maybe black. And the guy she was with, maniac driver. Complete moron.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Wait, wait. You ... you followed them?</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Simon</strong>: I had to. But I was pulled over by the cops. They kept me on-on the side of the road for over an hour.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: What time was this?</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Simon</strong>: It was around 2:00. It was a buck-fifty ticket. I'm innocent.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Cut the crap. We found trace amounts of automotive sheet metal on her clothing. You work around cars. If Alice picked it up from you, you were in violation of the T.R.O.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Simon</strong>: Lady, until we broke up, we spent every waking minute together. She'd come over to my shop on her lunch break just to get some.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It was over, Jeff. She didn't want you to be her lover, her protector. She didn't want you within a hundred yards. Whatever trace from you we found on her was fresh.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Simon</strong>: She worked around cars, too. I'm telling you, I'm innocent!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You were living a fantasy, thinking you still had a chance. When reality set in, you killed her.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>Mia Dickerson</strong>: Two contributions.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Two?</p>
<p><strong>Mia Dickerson</strong>: One was a match to the wife's DNA. The other was from an unknown male. I found the same unknown male contribution on the swabs from the Alice Granger homicide.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, it's unlikely that they're connected.</p>
<p><strong>Mia Dickerson</strong>: They're not. I also matched that unknown male contribution to a rape kit from the day shift.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Cross contamination?</p>
<p><strong>Mia Dickerson</strong>: That's why I raised the alarm. I was able to narrow the time frame to the last 48 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Are you saying that all the DNA evidence from the last two days has to be resubmitted and retested?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We don't have any choice. It's potentially all contaminated. (to Mia) Document everything. </p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So ... you're having a good time and ... Holly had had enough.</p>
<p><strong>Co-worker 1</strong>: Yeah. We carpooled, so she took a cab home.</p>
<p>(Det. Sam Vega turns and nods at Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Sam Vega</strong>: I'd like to show you some pictures. (He puts the sheet of six photos on the table in front of them.) See if you recognize anyone.</p>
<p>(They look at the photos, then point to picture #4 of Adam Novak.) </p>
<p><strong>Co-worker 1</strong>: He bought us a round. </p>
<p><strong>Co-worker 2</strong>: He tried to get friendly. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: When Holly left, did you see that man again?</p>
<p><strong>Co-worker 2</strong>: Actually, no.</p>

[INT. CSI -- FORENSIC AUTOPSY - HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(The hallway is cluttered with bodies on gurneys. Doc Robbins stands between a couple of the gurneys when Catherine turns the corner.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hell of a backlog, here, doc.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Yeah. Traffic pile-up on I-15. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Holly Pearson?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Mm.</p>
<p>(Robbins turns and heads into the autopsy room.) </p>
<p>[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Robbins and Catherine stand around Holly Pearson's body as Robbins reports.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: C.O.D.'S a one shot to the back of the head. Absence of gun powder and stippling suggests a non-contact wound. I dug this out.</p>
<p>(He gives her the bullet. Camera zooms in for a close-up of the bullet.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: .25 caliber. It's the same as the first victim.</p>
<p>(He takes the bullet and puts it aside.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: You know, I got something you might find interesting. I emptied the stomach and she hadn't eaten for hours. </p>
<p>(Robbins leads Catherine over to the scope.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: A small amount of white zinfandel -- less than a glass, vintage undetermined, and a tiny scrap of meat. Take a look.</p>
<p>(SCOPE VIEW: Skin cells.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Surface tissue of a human tongue. Those are the taste buds.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [NIGHT] The Man tries to kiss Holly Pearson and she bites his tongue.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) She bit her attacker ... when he tried to kiss her.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: This woman did not go gently into that good night.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - LAB] </p>
<p>(MONITOR VIEW: Two bullets. The computer beeps and the view changes to the side-by-side markings on the bullets.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (o.s.) Hey.</p>
<p>(Warrick continues to work. Nick walks into the lab.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Heard you may be looking at a second victim?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah. Bullets from both homicides are from the same gun.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I just got off the phone with courthouse security. That keycard that you and Catherine found belongs a guy named Adam Novak. (shrugs) Only prints I found on the card were his.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, let's call PD and bring him in.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CATHERINE'S CAR (MOVING) -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Catherine is driving home. We see her reflection through the rear-view mirror.) </p>
<p>(As she nears her home, she sees a car parked on the side of the road.) </p>
<p>(She sees Adam Novak standing out front talking her mom and Lindsey. Lindsey waves and they all watch as Catherine parks her car and engages her brakes.) </p>
<p>(Alarmed, Catherine takes her seatbelt off and takes out her phone. She dials<br />
9-1-1 and sets it aside on the car seat.) </p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong>: (from phone) 9-1-1. What is the nature of your -- </p>
<p>[EXT. CATHERINE'S RESIDENCE - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(Catherine gets out of the car.) </p>
<p><strong>Adam Novak</strong>: I see that beauty runs in the family.</p>
<p><strong>Lily Flynn</strong>: No.</p>
<p>(She slams the door and unsnaps her gun. She approaches them.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mom, Lindsey, go inside the house.</p>
<p><strong>Lily Flynn</strong>: (smiling) Believe it or not, Catherine does know how to say, &quot;Hello, how are you? Would you like a cup of coffee?&quot;</p>
<p>(Catherine joins them.) </p>
<p><strong>Adam Novak</strong>: I was talking to your mother about the case we're working.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mom, we're fine. Take Lindsey inside.</p>
<p>(Catherine gives her mom a look and shifts her eyes over to Adam Novak. Her mother stops smiling. She grabs Lindsey's hand and heads for the house.) </p>
<p><strong>Lily Flynn</strong>: Let's go.</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey</strong>: I don't, I don't want to.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Lindsey.</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey</strong>: Are you going to go out again?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No. I'm coming in. I want to hear about your day.</p>
<p>(Lindsey and Catherine's mother head inside the house.) </p>
<p><strong>Adam Novak</strong>: It was a pleasure meeting you.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What the hell are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>Adam Novak</strong>: I want to know why you're setting me up, manipulating evidence to make me look guilty. All because I came on too strong?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I want you out of here.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Novak</strong>: I didn't get my signals crossed. You changed the play, and you're screaming foul. That's some power trip, babe. Who's the guilty one here?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You want to talk to me, call your lawyer. Set up an appointment down at PD.</p>
<p>(Sirens wail in the distance.) </p>
<p><strong>Adam Novak</strong>: You think I killed her?</p>
<p>(Catherine takes a step back, pulls out her gun and holds her other hand in front of him to keep his distance.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Back off.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Novak</strong>: You going to shoot me?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: If you take one more step.</p>
<p>(Police sirens wail and lights flash as they approach. Adam Novak turns and sees the cars. He turns back to Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Adam Novak</strong>: You bitch.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You came to my house.</p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - OBSERVATION ROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Catherine watches as Grissom and Det. Vartann question Adam Novak with his lawyer.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mr. Novak, would you stick out your tongue, please? </p>
<p><strong>Lawyer</strong>: What is this about?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, right now, it's about his tongue.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: And two dead women. We believe the second victim, Holly Pearson, bit her attacker's tongue.</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - OBSERVATION ROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Open up, please.</p>
<p>(Adam Novak sticks out his tongue for Grissom to look at. Grissom shines his flashlight on it.) </p>
<p>(Thinking Grissom's done, Adam turns away. But Grissom stops him.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Uh-uh. Once more.</p>
<p>(Adam Novak sticks out his tongue and Grissom snaps a photo of the teeth marks on it.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Thank you. That's all I need.</p>
<p>(Grissom leaves the room.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Have a seat.</p>
<p>(Adam and his attorney sit down.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: You comfortable? We're going to be a while.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Novak</strong>: I know how this looks.</p>
<p><strong>Lawyer</strong>: Adam, I ...</p>
<p><strong>Adam Novak</strong>: I advise some of the stupidest guys that come through this room. And it's my job is to keep their mouths shut. And I know what you're thinking -<br />
- that I killed Alice Granger.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [NIGHT] Adam Novak chases Alice Granger. She trips and falls to her knees. He shoots her in the head.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: You're a mind reader.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Novak</strong>: I already admitted that I picked her up at a bar the other night. What I didn't mention, and you didn't ask was that I gave her a ride home.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [CAR - NIGHT] Adam Novak and Alice Granger are in his car. They lean toward each other ... ) </p>
<p><strong>Adam Novak</strong>: (V.O.) It got hot and heavy. We both got what we needed.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Adam Novak</strong>: Then she said good night and got out of the car. I drove off.</p>
<p><strong>Lawyer</strong>: Uh, do you have any evidence at all that refutes my client's account, or suggests otherwise?</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Our evidence pertains to the second victim, killed last night with the same gun, and we believe that a portion of your client's tongue was in her stomach.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Novak</strong>: I can explain that.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Oh? Really.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Novak</strong>: Her taxi never showed up.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [EXT. HIGHBALL - NIGHT] Holly Pearson waits outside for her taxi. Adam Novak comes out of the Highball and walks over to her.) </p>
<p><strong>Adam Novak</strong>: (V.O.) I was drunk. Out of line. Bad couple of days, thanks to you guys.</p>
<p>(He and Holly start walking.) </p>
<p><strong>Adam Novak</strong>: (V.O.) I was looking for a little release and I chose the wrong girl.</p>
<p>(He grabs her and starts kissing her. She struggles against him and pushes him away.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: And what happened next?</p>
<p><strong>Adam Novak</strong>: Her taxi finally showed up.</p>
<p><strong>Lawyer</strong>: I spoke to both the bartender at the Highball and the cab company, and a cab was ordered and drove the victim home.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Mr. Novak, have you ever been to Holly Pearson's house?</p>
<p><strong>Adam Novak</strong>: No. I have no idea where she lived.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Then how do you explain your courthouse keycard which we found near her body? CSI matched the prints on the card. Only yours.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Novak</strong>: Every attorney in the Public Defender's office is issued one card. Mine has never left my car. I keep it in the center console. You don't need a warrant. You have my permission to check. It should be there.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Well, that won't be hard to verify, because your car's already at CSI.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY / GARAGE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Catherine walks down the hallway toward the garage. Nick is standing with the car.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Nick.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The center console. Was there a parking lot car key inside?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No. Two sticks of gum and a pack of condoms. Why?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Suspect claims some incriminating evidence found at the second crime scene wasn't his. It looks like he was lying. We got him.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I don't know how you're going to take this, but I think this car was recently broken into. These scratches ... they look fresh. B&amp;E 101. </p>
<p>(Nick points to the scratches in the driver's side window.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The Slim Jim.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: A Slim Jim is pushed into the car door through the window slot. Camera zooms into the door showing the slim Jim pushing down onto the door lock mechanism.)</p>
<p>(End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Somebody could've swiped his keycard.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And then locked the car back up. Novak wouldn't be the wiser until he drove into the courthouse again. Did you find any prints?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Smudges and partials, inside and out.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (nods) Run 'em.</p>

<p>[INT. JUNKYARD - DAY]</p>
<p>(Det. Vartann and Catherine question Jeff Simon.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Let's run through the night Alice died again.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Simon</strong>: We've been through this. I have an alibi.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Your alibi only proves you lost track of her. You knew where Alice lived.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Have you been in Adam Novak's car recently?</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Simon</strong>: No. I don't even know an Adam Novak.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: But you identified his vehicle as the car that Alice left the bar in.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Simon</strong>: I didn't know whose car it was.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Then why did we find your prints in it?</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Simon</strong>: Maybe somebody's trying to frame me.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No, but I think that you're familiar with the concept. You were obsessed with Alice, and when you saw Adam having at her, you flipped out.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [NIGHT] Jeff Simon sits in his car and watches Adam Novak and Alice Granger kissing.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I mean, here's a woman that you can't get any traction with, yet she's willing to do a stranger she picked up in a bar.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [NIGHT] Alice Granger gets out of the car and giggles. Jeff Simon sits in his car, hands gripping the steering wheel as he watches her.) </p>
<p>(He turns his lights on.)</p>
<p>(Alice turns around.)</p>
<p>(Jeff gets out of the car.) </p>
<p><strong>Alice Granger</strong>: Jeff?</p>

<p>(Quick flashback to: [HIGHBALL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT] Jeff Simon breaks into Adam Novak's car and steals Adam's card key.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) The next night, you came back and saw his car in the parking lot. Creative justice. You could get them both.</p>
<p>(Cut to: Adam is hitting on Holly outside the Highball.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) It was just bad luck that Holly Pearson met Adam that night.</p>
<p>(Cut to: Adam follows Holly home.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) You had no reason to kill her, but you followed her home and worked up the nerve.</p>
<p>(Adam turns and sees Holly on the sidewalk looking for her key.) </p>
<p>(He gets out of the car. Holly looks up and sees him. She turns and starts running. Jeff takes out the gun and follows her.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(Jeff cover's Holly's face with her jacket. He turns and leaves. He takes Adam's card key out of his pocket and drops it on the ground.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>

[INT. CSI - DNA LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Mia is tossing all the kits away. Grissom appears in the doorway.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You figured out the source of the contamination?</p>
<p><strong>Mia Dickerson</strong>: I got a positive result off my negative control. Matched the contamination. Turns out somebody at the manufacturer forgot to put on their mask and then sneezed or coughed on what was supposed to be a sterile product.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You have to collect everyone's swabs.</p>
<p><strong>Mia Dickerson</strong>: Kits. Trucks. Vests. Work stations.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How long till the new shipment gets here?</p>
<p><strong>Mia Dickerson</strong>: It's on its way. Until then, do it old school.</p>
<p>(Grissom turns and leaves.) </p>
<p>[INT. CSI - HALLWAY - DAY -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Grissom writes in a file as he walks down the hallway.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Gil.</p>
<p>(He looks up; Catherine steps out into the hallway and joins him.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'd ask you out for a drink, but under the circumstances, it's, uh ...</p>
<p>(He looks at her, then goes back to his file. He doesn't say anything.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay, how long is this going to go on?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I don't know, Catherine.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Gil, it was an act of omission.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How many times have we heard a public defender say that?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I went out after work. Is it a crime to want a little human contact?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I guess that's why I don't go out.</p>

<p>[EXT. BUDDHIST TEMPLE (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p><strong>Cue Sound</strong>: MONKS CHANTING</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. BUDDHIST TEMPLE - MAIN PRAYER HALL -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Camera pans the room to show a group of Buddhist Monks praying and chanting. Their eyes are closed. The camera slowly moves toward the monk in the middle facing the large golden Buddha statute.)</p>
<p>(He raises his head and opens his eyes.)</p>
<p>(Someone raises a rifle and cocks the trigger. He fires.)</p>
<p>(Blood spatters onto the lit candle in front of him. The monk falls backward to the floor, blood seeping from the bullet hole in the middle of his forehead.)</p>
<p>FLASH TO WHITE:</p>
<p>[EXT. BUDDHIST TEMPLE (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>CUE: THREE MORE GUNSHOTS IN SUCCESSION</p>
<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. BUDDHIST TEMPLE - FRONT WALK -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(GRISSOM and SARA walk toward the front of the temple. NICK is walking down the temple stairs to meet them.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: &quot;Wherever you live is your temple, if you treat it like one.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: State your source.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Buddha.</p>
<p>(They meet up with NICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Paramedics just pronounced. Four dead, no witnesses. Coroner's on his way. Guy in the robe flagged down an officer.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: &quot;Guy in the robe&quot; is a monk, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah? Well ... </p>
<p>(NICK glances back at the lone monk dressed in orange robes standing on the stairs in front of the temple. He turns back to GRISSOM and SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: He's a quiet monk. Non-native, from Thailand.</p>
<p>(They head for the temple.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. BUDDHIST TEMPLE - MAIN PRAYER HALL -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and SARA push the curtain aside and they all view the crime scene.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Rug's low pile, smooth. I'll try to dust-lift.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (nods slightly) Okay. Let's hug the walls.</p>
<p>(SARA nods.)</p>
<p>(They enter the room )</p>
<p>(Grissom shines his flashlight on the monks and sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Gunshot to the head. Times four.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Gold statues ... money trees ... that's a lot of loot to leave behind. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This wasn't a robbery. This was a hit.</p>
<p>(They continue to survey the room. NICK leans down and examines the bodies. GRISSOM finds a symbol scratched into the wall.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Five years ago, West Vegas ... German tourist took a wrong turn, ended up dead. This &quot;placa&quot; was sprayed across the windshield of their rental car. It's the Snakebacks.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Gangbangers? At a Buddhist Temple?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Stippling around entry.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and SARA turn around to look at NICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Close range. Looks like they were shot one at a time. How do you get one vic -- let alone four-- to sit still while you put a bullet between their eyes?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: They were praying.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, for mercy. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: For whoever was shooting them.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO: END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<hr />
[EXT. BUDDHIST TEMPLE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM examines the garden out back. As he looks around, he finds the discarded rifle.)</p>
<p>(Nearby, SGT. O'RILEY is questioning ANANDA, the lone monk.)</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. O'Riley</strong>: What can you tell me about the victims?</p>
<p><strong>Ananda</strong>: We came from Thailand to share Buddhism here in Nevada.</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. O'Riley</strong>: But you didn't share the last couple hours together. Where were you?</p>
<p><strong>Ananda</strong>: I was at the bank. We're raising money to build a school. I was making a deposit.</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. O'Riley</strong>: Where are the other monks?</p>
<p><strong>Ananda</strong>: On a retreat. They come back tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: May I ask a question? This is a high-crime area. Have you had any problems here before? Like break-ins or burglaries?</p>
<p><strong>Ananda</strong>: The past ... is in the past.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: True. But sometimes, it leaves its fingerprints on the future.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM pulls out the rifle he found from the bag he's holding to show it to ANANDA.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<hr />
[INT. BAR -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks into a bar to talk with her former mentor, JIMMY TADERO. She smiles at the man sitting at the bar as she passes him.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (pats him on his shoulder) Aren't you on duty?</p>
<p>(She reaches JIMMY TADERO. He stands to meet her.)</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy Tadero</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy Tadero</strong>: How you doing, kiddo?</p>
<p>(They give each other a warm hug.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay. How are you.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy Tadero</strong>: Fine. Sit.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE sits. She signals the bartender for a drink.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Whew. Attitude adjustment?</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy Tadero</strong>: For the wife. Says she can't face me without it.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Ah. How is Mrs. Tadero?</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy Tadero</strong>: Counting the days till I retire. Nice job on the Logan case.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy Tadero</strong>: Hoo-hoo! Wild ride!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy Tadero</strong>: You did good.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy Tadero</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well ... I had a good teacher.</p>
<p>(They each take a sip of their drink.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, did you see it? The confession? </p>
<p><strong>Jimmy Tadero</strong>: On tv, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy Tadero</strong>: I always regretted the jury didn't give him the chair but I'll take cancer, long as he's gone.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [ON TELEVISION] MARK/DWIGHT KELSO is in the hospital bed with a nasal cannula on. The caption on the bottom of the television screen reads: Prison Hospital / MARK KELSO.)</p>
<p><strong>Mark/Dwight Kelso</strong>: (raspy) I've made a lot of mistakes. I killed that guy in Reno. But I did not kill Stephanie Watson. (gasping breath) God is my witness, I did not kill her.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy Tadero</strong>: Deathbed denial. Negotiate with god for a better seat in hell.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What if Kelso didn't kill Stephanie?</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy Tadero</strong>: I looked him in the eyes fifteen years ago. He did it.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: STEPHANIE WATSON walks down the back stairs to the alley. MARK/DWIGHT KELSO walks up to her and grabs her from behind. He takes the knife and stabs her in the abdomen with it. She screams. He drops the knife and runs away.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What if he didn't? I mean ...</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy Tadero</strong>: Witnesses saw him bothering her in the club that night. Uniform picks him up a block from the alley. Knife cut on his hand. Come on, Cath!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (sighs) Well ... maybe I'm just afraid that if I accept that he killed her that it's over, and Stephanie's really dead. </p>
<p>(She hangs her head down.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (mutters) I ... I don't know.</p>
<p>(JIMMY TADERO puts his hand over CATHERINE'S on the bar.)</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy Tadero</strong>: What never lies?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The evidence.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - EVIDENCE ROOM -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and WARRICK search through the darkened evidence room.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The statute says that once the convicted party is executed or dies, the evidence can be destroyed. I-it's not here.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Relax. They said it'd be here.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, well, people make mistakes.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, that's why we have computer tracking. Fourteen ... it was fifteen, right?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah. Fifteen ...</p>
<p>(WARRICK finds the box.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Stephanie Watson, right?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah. </p>
<p>(WARRICK pulls the box down. They look at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, that's it. </p>
<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - EVIDENCE ROOM - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(The contents of the evidence box are out on the table. CATHERINE and WARRICK go through the old evidence.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: This was my old life.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah? We all have a past, huh?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE picks up an old crime scene photo. The label reads:</p>
<p>WATSON, STEPHANIE<br />
CASE #2548713<br />
MARCH 9, 1987 ]</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (sighs) Stephanie was my best friend.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: At the club, the night of the murder, STEPHANIE WATSON meets up with CATHERINE backstage.)</p>
<p><strong>Stephanie Watson</strong>: Hey, we still on for tonight?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (smiles apologetically) I got a gig. I promised him I'd be there. Forgive me?</p>
<p><strong>Stephanie Watson</strong>: Just this once.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I never saw her again.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What exactly are we looking for?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (sighs) Peace of mind that they got the killer.</p>
<p>(WARRICK picks up the bloodied knife and holds it out to CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, I'd start with this.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE stares at the knife.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. BUDDHIST TEMPLE - HALLWAY -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(O'RILEY interviews DAVID SUDDAHARA, the cook.)</p>
<p><strong>David Suddahara</strong>: Forgive me. English is my second language.</p>
<p><strong>O'Riley</strong>: I understand you fine. So, you're the part-time cook here? (DAVID SUDDAHARA nods.) How many days a week do you work at the temple?</p>
<p><strong>David Suddahara</strong>: Three.</p>
<p><strong>O'Riley</strong>: You have a key?</p>
<p><strong>David Suddahara</strong>: No need. The door is always open. I told the monks.</p>
<p><strong>O'Riley</strong>: Too trusting. In this neighborhood, yeah. They ever have any problems with gangs?</p>
<p><strong>David Suddahara</strong>: Couple months ago I saw spray paints on the back wall. Gang signs. I wanted to file a police report, but Ananda ... told me not to.</p>
<p><strong>O'Riley</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>David Suddahara</strong>: I told you. </p>
<p><strong>O'Riley</strong>: &quot;Monks are too trusting.&quot;</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. BUDDHIST TEMPLE - MAIN PRAYER HALL - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(SARA takes a print off of the carpet.)</p>
<p>(Quick CGI to under the roller and the sheet to show between the sheet and the flat carpet and the electricity that's being generated. End of quick CGI.)</p>
<p>(SARA get the tape and uses the tape to mark where the sheet has been used on the carpet. She lifts it up carefully and sees the shoe print. She thinks about it for a moment, the flips the sheet back over.)</p>
<p>(Short time cut to: The camera slowly &quot;walks&quot; along the carpet to show the blocked area of masking tape markers of where SARA has already tested for shoe prints. We see evidence marker #1 where a print has been found. Several tape marker blocks up, we find evidence marker #2, evidence marker #3 and evidence marker #4.)</p>
<p>(Sara is examining the first of four cushions the monks were found on. She finds a stray bullet cartridge.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. BUDDHIST TEMPLE - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(NICK looks around and finds the Madonna, &quot;Ray of Light&quot;, CD next to the portable CD player. He puts it back. He picks up another item, shakes his head then moves along.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. BUDDHIST TEMPLE - MAIN PRAYER HALL - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(SARA examines the Buddha statute in the room. She looks at the blood spatter on the unlit candle. She examines one of the smaller Buddha statues and finds something.)</p>
<p>(Camera zooms in to the black thing stuck to the statue.)</p>
<p>(SARA picks up the statue. She looks up at the other statue and sees a wad of gum stuck the Buddha's forehead. She removes the soft gum.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. BUDDHIST TEMPLE - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(NICK goes through the desk drawer where he finds a magazine, &quot;Naughty Not Nice&quot;<br />
BIG BODACIOUS BADES.)</p>
<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. BUDDHIST TEMPLE - FRONT STAIRS -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(NICK and SARA sit on the stairs out front. NICK holds out the bagged magazine in front of him.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Interesting reading for a man of the cloth. That monk had it in the bottom of his desk drawer. (He puts it aside.) And he was the guy handling the money. You hide one thing from your brothers, then maybe he was hiding more.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah, but just 'cause you're stashing trash doesn't make you a killer.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, I'm just ... talking it out, Sara. What'd you find?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I found some boot prints on the prayer room rug. Monks don't wear boots, right, Nick?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No, no, or read p0rn or commit murder.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I also found a smudge with some trace material on a small statue. It was a partial, some ridge detail, but not make-able and a wad of gum that was stuck to the big Buddha. All of which is definitely pointing to an outside job.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, whatever. Outside, inside. Why shoot four people, then leave the murder weapon behind the temple where even a blind man could find it?<br />
(afterthought) And I hate taking off my shoes.</p>
<p>(SARA smiles. NICK stands up and walks down the rest of the stairs carrying his bagged magazine. SARA puts the sample back into her kit.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC PATHOLOGY -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(ROBBINS goes over the four autopsies with GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: All were shot in the third eye, the sixth chakra, vortex of consciousness. I was a gray's anatomy man, until I lost my legs. I started getting phantom pains no drug or exercise could control. I began studying the chakras.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, I do know that the seven chakras correspond to the body's seven energy centers.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Each has a color and a vibration. </p>
<p>(Standing next to one of the bodies, ROBBINS points to the part of the monk's body he's referencing. Quick CGI colors the area with a burst of the image of the Chakra.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Muladhara, the root chakra, keeps us in the physical world. Svadisthana, seat of sexual energy. Manipura, melting pot of spiritual and earthly desires. Anahata, the loving heart. Visuddha, where feelings are given expression. Ajna, the third eye. Saharsrara, the crown connecting the mortal human to the timeless universe.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Let's go back to the third eye.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Ajna, the hub of higher consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: If someone were threatened by that consciousness, that would be a logical target, yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Hmm, there's a very good chance your killer's a Buddhist.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - DNA LAB]</p>
<p>(GREG SANDERS goes over the blood evidence from the knife with CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Now, this is where Ecklie swabbed the blood sample from the blade fifteen years ago. It's your friend's, Stephanie Watson. And we got the second sample from the handle end. Perfect match to Dwight Kelso, the guy convicted for Stephanie's murder.</p>
<p>(Close up of the evidence bag reads:</p>

<p>(CATHERINE looks at GREG.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Thank you, Greg. Thank you.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks down at the knife.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Had to be hard on you. Losing a friend, someone that you ...</p>
<p>(CATHERINE abruptly walks out of the lab.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm taking this to Trace.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - TRACE LAB -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE examines the knife under a different color light.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Did I miss something?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You see that?</p>
<p>(GREG moves to stand next to CATHERINE to look at the knife.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Hmm, it's blood. That's a weak sample. That's probably why Ecklie took the thicker one.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Fifteen years ago, we figured, why light up something you can't analyze in the first place?</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Yeah, except now, we can replicate DNA a million times, even from the most minute sample of blood.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Priority.</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Let me know what you find out.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE leaves.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Yes, ma'am.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - BALLISTICS LAB -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>[SCOPE VIEW]</p>
<p>(Two bullets are being examined side by side.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Bobby D. Shot the test bullet through the rifle you found behind the temple. It's on the right.</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Tampering with evidence is against the law.</p>
<p><strong>Ananda</strong>: The temple is a holy place.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Maybe, but a crime had been committed there.</p>
<p><strong>Ananda</strong>: Please understand, I was obeying my teachings.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Do your teachings allow you to keep pornography?</p>
<p><strong>Ananda</strong>: Someone left the magazine at the temple. I kept it in case this person came back.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, right.</p>
<p><strong>Ananda</strong>: If you are no longer attached to seeking pleasure, pictures of naked women mean no more than pictures of waterfalls. I abstain from erotic behavior not because we believe s*x is sinful but because preoccupation with worldly pleasure diverts us from the path.</p>

I just signed off on the authorization to destroy evidence in the Stephanie Watson homicides since I was the primary, and then I learned tonight that the evidence has been checked out by you and Warrick. You care to explain that?</p>

<p>(CATHERINE looks at two photos. One of a close up of a left hand with a cut on the index finger, and the other of DWIGHT KELSO holding a sign: &quot;DWIGHT KELSO&quot;.)</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, but after those German tourists were killed the Snakebacks were pretty much wiped out. The cops really came down hard on those guys.

<p>(GRISSOM gives GREG SANDERS instructions on how to process the gum.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Well, I have to warn you, any food I find in the gum is not going to be unique. Why don't you just give me a suspect I can match to?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I can't give you what I don't have, Greg. All we're going to have is what we get from this gum.</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: All right, then I guess it's slice and dice.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM leaves the lab. GREG goes to work on the gum.)</p>

[INT. CSI - LOUNGE -- DAY]</p>
<p>(WARRICK walks into the lounge with CATHERINE'S test results.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Results on Jimmy Tadero's sample. I just got it back from DNA.</p>
<p>(He gives them to CATHERINE in an envelope. CATHERINE takes the envelope and sighs. She starts to open the envelope, then puts it abruptly back down on the table in front of her.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Not going to take a look at it?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE laughs.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: There was a shooting one night in the club and Jimmy pulls out his revolver and takes down the bad guy. The guy's on the floor, dying. Even though this was fifteen years ago, we still knew about aids. Jimmy then puts his gun away, he leans down -- he starts giving this guy mouth-to-mouth after having just shot him. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE smiles proudly at the memory.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Forget his own life, he's going to bring this guy back. And he did. </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You want me to open it?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE sighs heavily. WARRICK reaches for the envelope and opens it.)</p>
<p>(Camera holds on CATHERINE.)</p>

[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM -- DAY]</p>
<p>(Inside the interview room, through the glass window in the door, we see JIMMY TADERO and a POLICE OFFICER laughing. CATHERINE pauses outside the doorway and looks in. JIMMY turns around and sees CATHERINE. The POLICE OFFICER steps aside.)</p>
<p>CAMERA SLOW MOTION</p>
<p>(CATHERINE reaches the door and opens it. JIMMY TADERO turns around.)</p>
<p>RESUME MOTION</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks into the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You've been excluded on the murder weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy Tadero</strong>: I could have told you that. Did you compare the unknown against the club owner, Ted?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, I compared it to Ted. I compared it to every male in CODIS. There were no hits, nowhere. Have a seat, Jimmy.</p>
<p>(They both sit down.)</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy Tadero</strong>: I screwed up -- you want to hear me say it? I liked Kelso. Maybe I was wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (nods) Yeah, you were.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy Tadero</strong>: So now what?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (shakes her head) You know now what. </p>
<p><strong>Jimmy Tadero</strong>: You're not serious. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You put a man away for life on planted evidence, Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy Tadero</strong>: He was a scumbag. He copped to another murder.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Scumbag or saint, what you did is a capital crime. You can't play with evidence, especially in a murder.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy Tadero</strong>: I can get life in prison if you turn me in, do you know that? Maybe even the death penalty. Do you know that?!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What do you want me to do? What do you want me to do? Do you want me to look the other way? Do you want me to dummy my report?</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy Tadero</strong>: I can't believe you're doing this to me. I gave you your career.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I earned my career and you did this to yourself. You fabricated evidence, Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy Tadero</strong>: You were two steps away from turning tricks. This is the thanks I get?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE doesn't say anything. JIMMY knows that he's gone too far.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (hurt) I danced, period. And instead of feeling sorry for yourself, think about this. When you were out there planting evidence on a case that you couldn't break, Stephanie's real killer got away. And he's still out there ... (pause) ... because you sold the one thing a cop can't afford to sell: Your integrity. So you tell me, between the two of us who's the whore?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Arrest him.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE stands up to leave the room. JIMMY stands up and holds out his wrists as the POLICE OFFICER puts the handcuffs on him.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE takes his jacket and puts it over the cuffs.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You can hate me all you want. I'm going to see you through this.</p>
<p>(JIMMY nods.)</p>
<p>(The OFFICER leads JIMMY out of the room. CATHERINE stands there with tears in her eyes.)</p>

[EXT. SIDEWALK MARKET -- DAY]</p>
<p>(ANANDA walks through the market carrying his bag of groceries. He greets people along the way.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM pulls up in front of ANANDA.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: If you see the Buddha on the side of the road, kill him.</p>
<p><strong>Ananda</strong>: Because the true Buddha is inside of us so that is the false Buddha or a tired monk who doesn't drive because he can't control his anger.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM smiles at the humor.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Climb in, I'll give you a lift. </p>
<p>(ANANDA opens the car door and gets in.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We've cleared the father. The son has also been cleared.</p>
<p><strong>Ananda</strong>: And you're looking for my help. You know my religion better than I know your science.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: There was a gang placa that was scrawled into the walls of your temple. It was put there to mislead us. The weapon you found on your desk was also put there to mislead us. The only other unexplained evidence we have is the chewing gum. We found traces of curry and saffron.</p>
<p><strong>Ananda</strong>: Somebody ate a meal, then chewed gum.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sometimes the best evidence we get comes from what people do when they're not thinking. Old habits, routines. I don't think the gum was put there to mislead us. I think it was just a mistake.</p>
<p><strong>Ananda</strong>: And you want to know what I eat for dinner. (beat) Curry and saffron.</p>

[INT. BUDDHIST TEMPLE - KITCHENS -- DAY]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and ANANDA are in the kitchen.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's the real stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Ananda</strong>: The neighborhood kids thought we imported drugs. We just imported spices.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And the five of you ate together that night? Any guests?</p>
<p><strong>Ananda</strong>: No.</p>
<p>(SGT. O'RILEY walks into the kitchen.)</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. O'Riley</strong>: How come you don't leave your cell phone on?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We're in a temple, O'Riley.</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. O'Riley</strong>: Oh, sorry. I just left the bank. Mr. Ananda here, you're playing fast and loose with the school fund money. </p>
<p>(SGT. O'RILEY hands GRISSOM the file folder. GRISSOM looks at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. O'Riley</strong>: You raised just over $13,000 for the school fund, but you only deposited $12,000. You planning any more trips to Disneyland? </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: According to the bank, you opened the school fund account on the same day as the murders. Where did you have the money before that?</p>
<p><strong>Ananda</strong>: In a box in my office. CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. BUDDHIST TEMPLE - ANANDA'S OFFICE - DAY -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM opens the carved box.)</p>
<p>(Camera zooms in on a clump of yellow powder inside the box. GRISSOM leans in to look at the powder.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Curry powder. Your temple employs a part-time cook.</p>
<p><strong>Ananda</strong>: Mr. Suddahara moved on.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: After you caught him with his hand in the till? </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Inside ANANDA'S office, DAVID SUDDAHARA opens the box and removes some of the money. He looks up and finds that ANANDA is in the doorway watching him.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Why didn't you tell us about Mr. Suddahara before?</p>
<p><strong>Ananda</strong>: Because a man steals doesn't mean he also kills.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at SGT. O'RILEY.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>

[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM -- DAY]</p>
<p>(SGT. O'RILEY sits in the room with DAVID SUDDAHARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. O'Riley</strong>: Got any more of that gum, Mr. Suddahara?</p>
<p><strong>David Suddahara</strong>: Fresh out.</p>
<p>(The door opens and GRISSOM walks into the interview room reading a file folder.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yep, his DNA matches the gum sample.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM sits down.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You thought Ananda was going to report you to the police for stealing the money.</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. O'Riley</strong>: Went home, got his rifle, came back to make sure he didn't talk. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And he'd gone to the bank to protect the rest of the money but you didn't know that.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Inside the Buddhist Temple, DAVID SUDDAHARA carries the rifle.)</p>
<p><strong>David Suddahara</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p>(The monks continue to pray.)</p>
<p><strong>David Suddahara</strong>: Did he go to the cops already? If they ask what I look like, here's your answer.</p>
<p>(He cocks the rifle and shoots. The first monk falls backward onto the floor.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm curious about one thing, though. Why did you shoot them all in their sixth chakra?</p>
<p><strong>David Suddahara</strong>: I shot them between the eyes.</p>
<p>(Camera holds shortly on GRISSOM'S expression.)</p>

<p>(Inside the temple, there are two figures sitting side-by-side chanting.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks up to the veil-covered doorway and looks inside. He pushes the veil aside.)</p>
<p>(Sitting next to ANANDA is PETE HUTCHINS, JR. He turns his head slightly and looks back at GRISSOM.)</p>

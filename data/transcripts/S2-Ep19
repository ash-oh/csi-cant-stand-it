<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Off Screen, a phone rings.)</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Off Screen, the phone continues to ring.)</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p><strong>Answering Machine</strong>: No one is available. Please leave a message.</p>
<p>[CLOSED CAPTION READS: ANSWERING MACHINE: This is 469-5256. Please leave a message at the beep.]</p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT JANE HALLOWAY'S RESIDENCE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The answering machine beeps.)</p>
<p>(Camera close up of a telephone. There are 64 messages on the answering machine.)</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: (over phone) Jane, you there? Pick up. Okay ... I'll call back later.</p>
<p>(JANE GALLOWAY, a blond-haired woman, sits crouched and cowering on the floor against the hallway wall next to the answering machine table. She clutches a baseball bat tightly. The person on the answering machine hangs up. The phone begins ringing immediately. It rings once. The answering machine picks up.)</p>
<p><strong>Answering Machine</strong>: No one is available. Please leave a message.</p>
<p>[CLOSED CAPTION: ANSWERING MACHINE: This is 469-5256. Please leave a message at the beep.]</p>
<p>(The answering machine beeps.)</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: (over phone) Slut. You can't hide from me, bitch. Jane, you there?</p>
<p>(JANE GALLOWAY is terrorized by the sudden change of message. She looks at her front door. The three locks on her door don't move. She clutches her baseball bat and nervously chews on her fingernails.)</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: (over phone) Now, didn't I tell you ... not to bite your nails?!</p>
<p>(JANE GALLOWAY freezes. She realizes that this person over the phone can see her. She gets up and rips the phone cord from the wall, stands and runs to the bathroom at the end of the hallway. She bangs against the bathroom window, both are covered and nailed shut.)</p>
<p>(Unable to get the window open, she runs out of the bathroom and back down the hallway into her bedroom and slams the door shut. She frantically looks around and backs herself into her closet. She shuts the door in front of her. She sits in the dark, cowering in fear.)</p>
<p>(She opens the closet door a crack and looks out. She sees the bedroom door slowly open wider. Other than that, nothing. Her dog whimpers and scratches at the closet door.)</p>
<p><strong>Jane Galloway</strong>: Shoo, Peanut. Go away. Go away.</p>
<p>(The dog continues to whimper. She opens the closet door and grabs the dog and pulls him in with her. She shuts the closet door again. She pushes herself into the furthest corner of the closet away from the door.)</p>
<p>(Two gloved hands suddenly appear out of the darkness her and grab her from behind. She screams. The hands stifle her cries, they cover her mouth. She struggles. She screams. She tries to get away. She fights.)</p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. JANE GALLOWAY'S RESIDENCE - BATHROOM -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(JANE GALLOWAY, is bent over her toilet. Hugging it. CATHERINE snaps a photograph. GRISSOM stands on the side shining his flashlight on the victim. CATHERINE continues to snap photographs.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Posed?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Reading my mind.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE moves the camera slightly and takes a picture of something across the room. GRISSOM immediately shines his light there. The bathtub has streaks of red on its rim.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What do you make of the smears?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE takes out a swab from her kit and moves to collect a sample.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It's definitely not blood. Wrong color, texture.</p>
<p>(She lifts it up to her nose and smells it.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It's hair dye.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Her hair's still wet. You think the assailant surprised her while she was dyeing her hair?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Who called it in?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Neighbor lady -- doing the dishes with her window open. Heard the dog yelping, evidently. Called the cops.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE notices the bathroom windows.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: There's no sign of forced entry. The bathroom window's nailed shut.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and CATHERINE look around. GRISSOM walks out into the hallway and notices the doggie bed against the wall.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So, has anyone seen this dog?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Dog bed, dog bowl, dog food ... no dog.</p>
<p>(They both walk out of the bathroom and through the hallway. CATHERINE notices the front door.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Triple locks on all the doors. Every shade drawn. State-of-the-art alarm system. As far as we know her place was perfectly hermetically sealed until the cops batter-rammed their way in.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Prisoner in her own home?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, how did he get in?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: A better question -- how'd he get out?</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO: END OF TEASER. ROLL TITLE CREDITS.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<hr />
[INT. JANE GALLOWAY'S RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM pushes the curtain away. The living room windows are covered also.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Aluminum foil.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Keeps the sunlight out. GRISSOM: Keeps the eyeballs out, too.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. JANE GALLOWAY'S RESIDENCE - BATHROOM]</p>
<p>(Camera close up on NICK. He's staring intently at the victim poised over the toilet bowl. For some unknown reason, this scene disturbs him. He's so intent on the scene in front of him that he doesn't notice GRISSOM enter the bathroom through the door behind him. He doesn't hear GRISSOM approach.)</p>
<p>(NICK jumps as GRISSOM appears right behind him.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sorry, Nick. You've been staring at this girl for ten minutes. Do you know her?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (quietly) No.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Why don't you go do the bedroom? I'll get the coroner in here and finish up in the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM motions to the bedroom. NICK leaves the bathroom.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. JANE GALLOWAY'S RESIDENCE - BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE is looking for body fluids on JANE GALLOWAY'S bed with an ALS. NICK walks in and puts his kit down.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, Catherine, I'll get that.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No. I got it.</p>
<p>(Without taking her eyes off the bed, she holds out her hand to NICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Tweeze me. Thank you.</p>
<p>(She picks up a single strand of hair and holds it up for NICK to look at.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, what do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: A little thick for a human hair.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No, I've seen them this thick.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(NICK pulls out a bindle. CATHERINE puts the hair inside.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I'll get it to the lab.</p>
<p>(NICK turns away. CATHERINE stops him.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, and don't forget what's under the bed.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Why, what's under the bed?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Something that you would have caught eventually ... &quot;Crime Stopper&quot; ...</p>
<p>(NICK chuckles.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No one's going to let me live that one down, are they?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No. You know, now that you're a celebrity, you may want to think about getting a new shirt.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah? Well ... I'm short on options. Besides, the dry cleaners keeps losing my stuff.</p>
<p>(NICK lifts up the bedding and glances under the bed where he finds a plastic bag. GRISSOM enters the bedroom.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What'd you get?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Grocery bag with a red smudge.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Good. Fume it. Tell Sara and Warrick to grab a couple shovels and dig in, too.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY]</p>
<p>(NICK walks through the hallway. As he passes the bulletin board, he stops to glance at the latest issue of the &quot;Crime Stopper&quot; newsletter posted on the boards. On the cover is a front page article on &quot;Nick Stokes&quot;, complete with photograph on the right. He sighs and rips the newsletter off the hanging clipboard.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - BREAK ROOM]</p>
<p>(As NICK enters the break room, we can hear laughter and giggling. NICK smiles and shakes his head. WARRICK and SARA are sitting at the break table, huddled over the latest &quot;Crime Stopper&quot; issue.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Who wrote this?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You're kidding me, right?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: &quot;Nick Stokes, Crime Stopper.&quot;</p>
<p>(NICK chuckles.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You went Hollywood on me, man.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: And I quote, &quot;in his off time, he enjoys creating and inventing toys.&quot; That's fascinating. What kind of toys do you make, Nick?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I thought I got my hands on all those departmental newsletters. Where'd you get those?</p>
<p>(Both WARRICK and SARA look up innocently at NICK. NICK has the article that WARRICK and SARA were reading.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Greg.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Greg.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, that figures. All right, listen, Grissom wants us to divide and conquer. Blond hair for you, Warrick.</p>
<p>(NICK hands WARRICK the bagged strand of hair.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I do love a blond.</p>
<p>(NICK puts the file folder on the table in front of SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Sara, you're on phone records.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yay.</p>
<p>(NICK slowly leaves the room. He crumples the newsletter on his way out.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey, I wasn't done reading that.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yes, you are.</p>
<p>(NICK tosses it into the trash can as he leaves the room.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY]</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: We know two things for certain. Jane Galloway died from a lack of O2 and she is a natural blond.</p>
<p>(ROBBINS and GRISSOM both pause and turn to look at CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What are you looking at me for?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sorry. So, what -- suffocation?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: It certainly looks that way.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV to close up of an eye being opened by two fingers. The eyes redden and the skin around the eye turns a blue-ish color. Flash to white. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Uh, petechial hemorrhaging in the eyes, deoxygenation led to cyanosis, hence the blue lips ...</p>
<p>(Quick Flash to close up of JANE GALLOWAY'S face with focus on her lips turning a bluish-color. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: ... blue fingertips ...</p>
<p>(Quick Flash to close up of fingertips turning a bluish-color. Flash to close up of face with blue lips turning a bluish-color. Resume to CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: ... and blue face.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No ligature marks on her neck.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: If she had struggled with her assailant that effort alone could have limited her oxygen intake causing further O2 depletion of the brain ...</p>
<p>(Camera close up of JANE GALLOWAY'S head. The camera moves in closer to her forehead and goes through the brain and through the skull to show a tangled maze of nerves and veins as electrical impulses and flashes of light travel its path. Flash to white. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Easy kill.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sexual assault?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: No physical findings. You'll have to check the kit.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, he murders her, poses her, yet he doesn't rob her or rape her.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So, what's his agenda?</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI -- LAB]</p>
<p>(WARRICK walks into the lab. GREG is sitting at the table reading a &quot;Teen&quot; magazine with Pink on the cover. He doesn't move when WARRICK enters.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: How's that platinum blond coming?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Wrong question.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Come on, Greg I'm not getting anything out of trace. I was hoping you could help me out here.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I took a snip, ran a crossed immuno-electrophoresis.</p>
<p>(GREG puts his magazine aside and picks up the bag with the hair sample. He tosses it to WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Didn't pass.</p>
<p>(GREG goes back to his magazine.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Not hair? Not human? What are you reading?</p>
<p>(GREG turns the cover over and shows it to WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: This is Pink. Pink, this is Warrick.</p>
<p>(GREG looks at the cover.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Do you know how hot you are? Ssss!</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Bet I know someone who's hotter and I'm not talking about looks.</p>
<p>(GREG looks at WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: How mad is he?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Watch your back.</p>
<p>(WARRICK leaves the lab.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - PRINT LAB]</p>
<p>(NICK is fuming the plastic bag when GREG walks in. He knocks lightly on the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Heard you were looking for me?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Greg. Come here. I want to talk to you for a sec. </p>
<p>(GREG hesitates at the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p>(GREG walks in and stops when he reaches NICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: What's up?</p>
<p>(NICK slaps GREG on the back and grasps the back of his neck.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Stop invading my privacy, man, I don't like it. I'm just trying to do my job around here. I don't need the extra attention.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Okay. But, I mean, you are the one who's doing the &quot;Forensic Spotlight&quot; in the department newsletter.</p>
<p>(NICK tightens his grip on GREG'S shoulder. GREG winces in pain.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I didn't do anything, man. Someone from the community wrote a letter of commendation. Public affairs ran it. Cool?</p>
<p>(GREG nods.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p>(NICK lets go of GREG and walks around the tank. GREG sighs and looks into the tank.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: So, uh, what are you fuming?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Plastic bag from the crime scene. I'm trying to get lucky -- see if I can get some prints off it.</p>
<p>(NICK opens the top of the tank and starts to fan the fumes. GREG stares intently at the plastic bag inside.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Did she die of suffocation?</p>
<p>(NICK stares at GREG, amazed that he got it in one. GREG still stares at the plastic bag inside the tank. He glances up at NICK when he doesn't get a response.)</p>
<p>(NICK catches on that GREG sees something. He moves back around the tank to stand next to GREG. On the plastic bag is the imprint of JANE GALLOWAY'S face.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to the plastic bag wrapped around JANE GALLOWAY'S head. She struggles and screams. Flash to white. End of flashback. Resume to NICK.)</p>
<p>(Camera holds on NICK.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY -- DAY]</p>
<p>(BRASS, GRISSOM and SARA walk through the hallway. GRISSOM is holding an open file folder.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Did some digging on Jane Galloway. Her boyfriend had a TRO against him.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: And according to the phone records the guy called Jane thirteen times the day of the murder.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: And that's thirteen times too many according to the restraining order. We're going to check out his house.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'll be on my cell.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM hands the folder to SARA. She and BRASS leave. WARRICK appears in the hallway.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Grissom, you got a second? I got a mystery.</p>
<p>(WARRICK leads GRISSOM to the lab.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
(Microscope view of the strand of &quot;hair&quot; found at JANE GALLOWAY'S residence.)</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - LAB - DAY -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No becke line.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hair refracts light under cross polarization but glass doesn't.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, it's not a hair. It's a synthetic fiber. Glass-- what do you think, fiberglass?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: This could be a lot of things.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You'll figure it out.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM leaves. Camera holds on WARRICK.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. ADAM PIORIO'S RESIDENCE -- DAY]</p>
<p>(BRASS pounds on ADAM PIORIO'S front door. Both he and SARA wait for a response. There's no answer.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Looks like the boyfriend skipped out on us.</p>
<p>(SARA and BRASS leave ADAM PIORIO'S house #25054. As they walk away from the house, SARA notices something.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey, Brass? Isn't that his car?</p>
<p>(Sure enough, there's a car parked across the street in front of a Chevron Tahoe with Nevada Plates GRO-480.)</p>
<p>(BRASS approaches the car with his gun drawn. SARA is on her cell phone calling it in. BRASS knocks lightly on the side of the car as he makes his way to the front seat to let whomever is in the car know that he's approaching.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Control, this is P-9241 requesting backup and medical assistance. The 1800 block of Newhaven Road. Possible 419.</p>
<p><strong>Dispatcher</strong>: P-9241, copy.</p>
<p>(In the front seat of the car, a man is hunched over the steering wheel, his face bloodied and bruised.)</p>
<p>(BRASS puts on a latex glove to check the man's pulse. SARA unholsters her gun to cover him.)</p>
<p>(The man in the front seat jumps as BRASS touches him. This startles BRASS.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: All right, all right. Get out of the car, get out of the car.</p>

<p><strong>Adam Piorio</strong>: Look, we broke up a few weeks ago. She ... she started acting weird for no reason.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: She had a TRO against you. Something must have happened to spook her.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Piorio</strong>: She changed overnight. She... she wouldn't return any of my phone calls. She started calling in sick at work. Barricading herself in her own house.</p>

<p><strong>Adam Piorio</strong>: We started arguing.</p>

<p><strong>Adam Piorio</strong>: We just broke up. All right, I was ... I was rolling on &quot;e&quot; last night. Give me a break.</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (to walkie-talkie) Patrol. Request immediate backup. Immediate backup. Officer down. I need emergency medical assistance! Eight-two-six ...</p>
<p>(He exits the house and back down the stairs to render aid to NICK who hasn't moved from his position down in the bushes below. WARRICK hangs up and checks NICK who still hasn't moved.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Nick! Nick.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO BLACK.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>

<p>FADE IN.</p>

[INT. HOSPITAL - NICK'S ROOM]</p>
<p>(The doctor just finishes checking up on NICK who's asleep in the hospital bed. The doctor leaves and walks out of the room.)</p>
<p>[INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY OUTSIDE NICK'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(SARA and CATHERINE stand as the doctor exits NICK'S room to give them an update. GRISSOM and WARRICK are also there.)</p>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong>: Concussion, two cracked ribs, sprained wrist, five stitches to the forehead. It could have been a lot worse.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: But 's going to be all right?</p>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong>: He needs rest. But I don't see why he can't go home relatively soon.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Thank you, doctor.</p>
<p>(The doctor leaves.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Damn it. Grissom, this guy was right there. I could have had him.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You helped out Nick. That was the right thing to do.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Doesn't feel like the right thing.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You know, Nick was alone. The Stalker could have killed him and didn't.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, I wonder why. Let's go back over there.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE is already walking down the hallway, WARRICK straightens to follow.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'm going with you.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM puts a restraining hand on his shoulder as he turns to leave.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No, no. You need to calm down a little. Talk to Nick when he wakes up.</p>
<p>(SARA remains behind in the hallway next to WARRICK.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>

[INT. NIGEL CRANE'S RESIDENCE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and GRISSOM stand in front of the living room window. The same window NICK was pushed out from. GRISSOM is reading from a clip board he carries.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Nigel Crane, age 37. No criminal record. Working for Luna Cable for eleven years. No immediate family, lives alone. Last seen by co-workers two days ago. No priors.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Not a stick of furniture ... except for a computer and a chair.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and CATHERINE both look at the laptop on the crate against the wall and the chair in front of it. CATHERINE puts her kit down to examine the window more closely. GRISSOM walks forward examining the ceiling as he goes.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM enters the kitchen and immediately notices the step ladder in the pantry. He puts the clip board on the counter and glances up at the door in the pantry ceiling. He turns off his flashlight and turns on the pantry light. He climbs the step ladder and pushes the ceiling door open.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. NIGEL CRANE'S ATTIC - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM reaches up and turns on the attic lights. He glances around and sees all the comforts of home. He also sees the video tape library and various electronic surveillance equipment. All the video tapes are labeled and dated.)</p>
<p>CUT BACK TO:</p>
<p>[INT. NIGEL CRANE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE opens the cabinet door and pulls out the trash bin. She starts going through the trash when GRISSOM falls to the pantry floor with a loud thud, scaring CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (startled) What the hell?!</p>
<p>(GRISSOM points to the attic.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He lives up there. Not down here. Works, sleeps changes his clothes ... everything in the attic. He looks down on the world separating himself from others. Fascinating, really.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well ... you're going to love this.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE points to the side of the trash bin. There's a long streak of red on its inside.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Red dye.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yup. Now what?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM holds up a digital tape.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Dinner and a movie?</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - AUDIO/VISUAL LAB]</p>
<p>(On the television monitor, a montage of clips of various people walking on the streets of Las Vegas is shown.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM, CATHERINE and ARCHIE JOHNSON watch NIGEL CRANE'S library. The stack of video tapes are on the table in front of GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Nigel Crane</strong>: (v.o. on tape) Walking pukes. Soulless, lost, useless, sick puppets. Little sheep looking for direction. Gullible ... (video fizz) From an airplane they used to look like ants. And now ... they're all ants all the time. You squash one ...</p>
<p>(The video clips are intermixed with video clips of NIGEL CRANE himself.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well. Just think, this is only tape one.</p>
<p><strong>Nigel Crane</strong>: (v.o. on tape) They all start running around in a panic.</p>
<p>(Camera holds on GRISSOM as he watches the tape.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY]</p>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong>: Now, these painkillers are the real deal, okay? Don't overdo it. Plenty of rest. No work for at least a week.</p>
<p>(The doctor hands the medication to WARRICK. NICK is sitting in a wheelchair and SARA'S behind him.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Will do, thank you, doctor.</p>
<p>(The doctor leaves. SARA pushes the chair and they all walk down the hallway.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: The gloves, you find them?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Catherine thinks he might have got away with them. But, uh, Grissom did find some wacky video collection.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Of what?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (interrupting) Now, did you not just hear the doctor? You're supposed to rest. We're on it, okay?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, relax, Ironside.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - AUDIO/VIDEO LAB - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE, GRISSOM and ARCHIE JOHNSON continue to watch the video tapes. The current one in the machine is the night vision view of JANE GALLOWAY sleeping.)</p>
<p><strong>Nigel Crane</strong>: (on video) I see you, Jane. Do you feel me? Do you feel me?</p>
<p>(The video tape fast forwards.)</p>
<p><strong>Nigel Crane</strong>: (on video) You ... you will never get me. No. Not the way he does. And we all get what we deserve. And I ... I got a friend.</p>
<p>(SARA and WARRICK enter the lab.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: How's it going?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How's Nick doing?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, groggy. How's the epic?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Epic.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Gotten any clues as to where this guy might be?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Not really, not yet.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE sees something on the video screen.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Archie, freeze it.</p>
<p>(The video tape pauses. CATHERINE points to the screen.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Do you see that behind him? To the left hand of the screen? Can you focus the pixels?</p>
<p>(ARCHIE JOHNSON starts typing. He click and drags the area CATHERINE points to and enhances the image.)</p>
<p><strong>Archie Johnson</strong>: Okay, we're now at 26 times magnification. Rendering at 1086 lines.</p>
<p>(The image enlarges and clears. It's the article of NICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: That's the &quot;Crime Stopper&quot; article.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Isn't our newsletter for in-house only?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Do you think he knows Nick?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: He may know him well enough to read his e-mail.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Found that photo of Nick and his prom date. Used Jane Galloway to emulate the photo?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Why would he do that? Why Nick?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Nick has satellite cable, right?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Lunar Cable- a hundred and fifty channels.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Wait a minute we've been doing this the wrong way. We need to see the last tape.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns around to the stack of tapes on the table behind him. He digs out the last tape and hands it to ARCHIE JOHNSON.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Archie, play this.</p>
<p>(ARCHIE hits play. Video camera close up of NIGEL CRANE instantly appears on screen.)</p>
<p><strong>Nigel Crane</strong>: (on tape) It's like he, he's ... he's the kind of guy I always wanted to, um ... to be. And that's why it's so great, because ... we're friends now. I feel like I can count on him, you know? And you know what? I think if it came right down to it he would lay his life down for me. Ask him. A-a-ask Nick. Nick, would you let me stop your heart?</p>

<p>[INT. NICK STOKE'S RESIDENCE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(NICK takes some tablets with a drink of water. He settles himself slowly and painfully on his sofa. He leans back and closes his eyes. There's a knock at the front door.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Who is it?</p>
<p><strong>Morris Pearson</strong>: (o.s.) My name is Pearson. Morris Pearson. We haven't met. I worked with Mr. Grissom on the Jane Galloway case.</p>
<p>(NICK gets up off the sofa and walks to the front door.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: It's almost one in the morning. What do you want?</p>
<p>(NICK peers through the peep hole. It's MORRIS PEARSON.)</p>
<p><strong>Morris Pearson</strong>: I've had more visions. Please let me in.</p>
<p>(Nick opens the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, maybe but look ...</p>
<p>(MORRIS PEARSON immediately steps into the house. NICK tries to get him to leave, but MORRIS PEARSON is insistent and continues to walk into the house. He rambles as he walks.)</p>
<p><strong>Morris Pearson</strong>: Please, please let me in.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I can't just let you in my...</p>
<p><strong>Morris Pearson</strong>: Please, please, please...</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, hold up.</p>
<p><strong>Morris Pearson</strong>: I saw this house. I saw this house, I saw the number I saw the street name. Something is wrong here. Something terrible is going to happen here</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Sir ...</p>
<p><strong>Morris Pearson</strong>: I can feel it.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Sir. Sir ... You're going to have to leave.</p>
<p><strong>Morris Pearson</strong>: Please, please, listen to me.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Get out of here.</p>
<p><strong>Morris Pearson</strong>: (yells desperately) Listen to me!</p>
<p>(Both men stop yelling at each other.)</p>
<p><strong>Morris Pearson</strong>: I saw the address. I saw this address.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You saw my address?</p>
<p>(NICK looks at MORRIS PEARSON. He walks slowly toward him. MORRIS PEARSON continues to walk into the house.)</p>
<p><strong>Morris Pearson</strong>: Yeah, but that's not it, that's not it. I saw, I saw ... I saw crashing. I saw ... falling and crashing-- I saw somebody seeing through the back of his head. I don't know, I don't know ...</p>
<p>(MORRIS PEARSON stops walking in NICK'S living room. He suddenly swings around to look at NICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Morris Pearson</strong>: Green tea! Green tea! Does that mean anything to you? Green tea?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I don't know.</p>
<p>(NICK sighs and shakes his head. NICK'S phone rings.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Just ... (he answers it.) Hello?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Nick, listen, he's been in your house.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Who?</p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH:</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - HALLWAY]</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Nigel Crane, the Stalker. Brass is one his way with two uniforms to put at your door.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, well, I'm not alone.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Your psychic's here.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Good, keep him there.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM hangs up the phone.)</p>
<p>CUT BACK TO:</p>
<p>(NICK hangs up his phone. He takes out his weapon from the cabinet beside the phone and turns to find MR. PEARSON. Only, he's not in the living room anymore.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mr. Pearson. (Gun cocking.) Mr. Pearson. Mr. Pearson ...</p>
<p>(NICK walks down the hallway. He checks the room. He checks the back door. It's locked and chained. He looks out the window. He doesn't see anything.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mr. Pearson, you back here?</p>
<p>(He walks back the hallway and looks in the next room. The wood floors creak. He hears a muffled thump.)</p>
<p>(NICK stands still and listens. He looks up at the ceiling. He holds his gun pointed at the ceiling and slowly walks back to the living room. From up above, we see that his living room carpet has a large, green letter &quot;T&quot; in the center.)</p>
<p>(NICK holds his gun drawn upward. A body crashes through the ceiling roof and down to the living room floor. Ceiling plaster and dust plumes everywhere. NICK drops his gun. Through the dust, NICK recognizes MORRIS PEARSON. He moves closer to check the man's pulse when NIGEL CRANE jumps down through the hole in the ceiling startling NICK.)</p>
<p>(NICK notices NIGEL and reaches for his gun. NIGEL'S quicker and picks it up first.)</p>
<p><strong>Nigel Crane</strong>: Oh, man. You got to ... you got to watch who you let in here. Guy was snooping around all over the place. You know, smart move. Spare gun.</p>
<p>(NIGEL CRANE slaps the side of the gun twice. He moves backward and points to the cabinet by the phone.)</p>
<p><strong>Nigel Crane</strong>: Ah. Keep it right by the phone right? Right next to your address book and, and take out menus.</p>
<p>(NIGEL CRANE checks the front door.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Cops are on their way.</p>
<p><strong>Nigel Crane</strong>: Yeah. I heard that.</p>
<p>(NIGEL CRANE moves to the living room and pulls down the blinds. That's when NICK notices it.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You wearing my clothes?</p>
<p><strong>Nigel Crane</strong>: Oh, yeah. I'm ...</p>
<p>(NIGEL CRANE looks back proudly at NICK. He exhales deeply.</p>
<p><strong>Nigel Crane</strong>: You know, I-I-I picked these up at the dry cleaners and I ... I hope you don't mind. It's just that ... I'm sorry I, I just get a little confused about what's yours and what's mine.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You know what? I'm a little confused here myself. Uh, why don't you refresh my memory. When did we meet?</p>
<p>(NIGEL CRANE looks incredulously at NICK. He snorts.)</p>
<p><strong>Nigel Crane</strong>: Sports package. Hundred fifty channels. I-I-I even threw in a few movie channels. Free. We-we-we talked, like, forever. I mean, it's like I knew you my entire life.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You installed my cable.</p>
<p><strong>Nigel Crane</strong>: Yeah. The ... the minute I met you I knew we connected. Because you told me what you did and I knew exactly what you were talking about, because ... that's what I do. I do it, too. You know, I observe people. I-I-I notice everything about them. I watch them. All the time.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Like you watched Jane Galloway?</p>
<p><strong>Nigel Crane</strong>: Jane was cool. But, um, it would have never worked out between us, you know. Never. I mean, she had a boyfriend and she was kind of stuck up. And you know what, she would have totally, totally gotten between us. So, you know, consider that a gift.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: A gift?</p>
<p><strong>Nigel Crane</strong>: Yeah. Prom night. Your date. Melissa.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to the photograph of MELISSA over the toilet bowl fast asleep. White flash to JANE GALLOWAY poised over the toilet seat dead. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Nigel Crane</strong>: Bent over the toilet puking her guts out. Is that ringing any bells, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nigel Crane</strong>: You know, I mean, Jane's hair was the wrong color but, you know obviously, I fixed that. Because I know how much you love redheads. You know, you ... you mentioned her name in your sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You watch me sleep?</p>
<p>(NIGEL CRANE looks down at MORRIS PEARSON.)</p>
<p><strong>Nigel Crane</strong>: You, um ... you want to open him up?</p>
<p>(NIGEL CRANE crouches low over the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Nigel Crane</strong>: Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No, no, it's, uh ... it's not my job. You should know that. It's the coroner's gig.</p>
<p>(NICK crouches over the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Nigel Crane</strong>: Are you humoring me, Nick?</p>
<p>(NICK shakes his head.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Nigel Crane</strong>: You know ... we made friends that day and every time since you just blew me off. Do you know that? You just completely blanked me.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to NICK walking up the sidewalk looking through his mail. A man walks by on the sidewalk. NICK passes him and walks up his driveway.)</p>
<p><strong>Nigel Crane</strong>: (V.O.) You are so self-absorbed.</p>
<p>(White flash to a close up of the man, NIGEL CRANE, looking back at NICK. White flash to NICK and WARRICK walking up the stairs to NIGEL CRANE'S house. NIGEL CRANE is down on the steps below watching them walk up to his front door.)</p>
<p><strong>Nigel Crane</strong>: (V.O.) I was right in front of your face.</p>
<p>(Flash to white. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(NIGEL CRANE stands up. Now that he thinks about it, he's pretty upset at being ignored.)</p>
<p><strong>Nigel Crane</strong>: Manners, Nick! Manners!</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, now, Nigel, now we got a D.B. here, huh? You're going to help me with the crime scene, right?</p>
<p><strong>Nigel Crane</strong>: No, no, I'm going to ... I'm going to ...</p>
<p>(NIGEL points the gun at NICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Nigel Crane</strong>: ... give you a brand-new one. I'm going to do better than that. I'm going to give you the best you ever had. Stand up, Nick. Stand up.</p>
<p>(NICK stands.)</p>
<p><strong>Nigel Crane</strong>: Nick, you know what a nine-millimeter slug does to a skull at close range? You know?</p>
<p>(NIGEL CRANE pulls his gun back and holds it in front of his face.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nigel Crane</strong>: Blow it right apart, right? Brains like strawberry swirled. Whipped cream, everywhere. And you.</p>
<p>(NIGEL points the gun back at NICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Nigel Crane</strong>: You'd have to scoop that stuff up, right? Yeah, little pieces of skull and bone and brains. All in individual baggies with the victim's name on the label.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You know I don't want to disappoint you, Nigel, but this isn't the first time I've had a gun in my face.</p>
<p>(NICK takes a step toward NIGEL.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: How do you want this to end, Nigel?</p>
<p><strong>Nigel Crane</strong>: How do I want this to end? I want you to be able to remember my name.</p>
<p>(NIGEL CRANE pulls the gun back from NICK and toward his own throat. NICK quickly realizes what NIGEL CRANE has planned and lunges for the gun. The two struggle for its possession.)</p>
<p>(At the same time, POLICE OFFICERS batter ram through the front door crashing it in and splintering the door frame. BRASS and several OFFICERS rush in to the house, their guns drawn.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Gun! OFFICER: Get down! Get down!</p>
<p>(NICK successfully gains possession of the gun, holds it up at the ceiling and takes a step back. The OFFICERS manage to subdue NIGEL CRANE.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Put him down. OFFICER: Cuff him. OFFICER: Get him secured.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p>(BRASS turns to support NICK, who breathes heavily with the effort.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: It's, it's done. All right?</p>
<p>(NICK nods and breathes heavily.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
(NIGEL CRANE sits alone at the table in the interrogation room continually murmuring the same line over and over again. Through the reflection in the glass, we see NICK watching from the observation room next door.)</p>
<p><strong>Nigel Crane</strong>: (murmuring) I am one, and who am I? I am one, and who am I? I am one, and who am I? I am one, and who am I? I am one, and who am I? I am one, and who am I? I am one, and who am I?</p>
<p>[INT. OBSERVATION ROOM]</p>
<p>(Also in the Observation room, CATHERINE, GRISSOM, WARRICK and SARA watch with NICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Why me?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I don't think it was about you, Nick. Or Jane Galloway, for that matter. I think it was more about Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. His premise is that social beings strive to belong. In Nigel's mind, Jane Galloway was someone he could control which was okay for a while but you ... you were someone he could actually become. See, Maslow's Fifth Tier of the Hierarchy is Self-Actualization.</p>
<p><strong>Nigel Crane</strong>: (V.O.) I am one, and who am I? GRISSOM: The problem for Nigel is that you would have to die in order for that to happen. Or else he would.</p>
<p>(In the room next door, NIGEL STANDS up and slowly walks toward the two-way mirror.)</p>
<p><strong>Nigel Crane</strong>: (background) I am one, and who am I?</p>
<p>(Cut to SARA and WARRICK sitting in the back of the observation room.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Twenty-five years to life, Nick. It's over.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: It's not over for me. It's over for Jane Galloway.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (sighs) Well, we should get back to the lab.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE stands an puts a comforting hand on NICK'S shoulder.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM also stands. In the back, WARRICK and SARA move toward the door. They slowly exit the room.)</p>
<p>(NICK hasn't moved yet. Through the two-way mirror, he watches NIGEL CRANE who walks along the mirror murmuring to himself the same line over and over again.)</p>
<p><strong>Nigel Crane</strong>: I am one, and who am I? I am one, and who am I?</p>
<p>(He holds out both his hands in front of him as if reaching for something in front of him. NICK still doesn't move.)</p>
<p><strong>Nigel Crane</strong>: I am one, and who am I? I am one, and who am I? I am one, and who am I? And who am I?</p>
<p>(Two officers take NIGEL CRANE away. NICK is left standing there in front of the mirror.)</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>

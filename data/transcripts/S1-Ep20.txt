[EXT. ROADWAY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Women are laughing. A car, Nevada license #OVK 195, drives by. There are two women inside the car.)</p>
<p><strong>Charlotte</strong>: That club was hot!</p>
<p><strong>Lisa</strong>: We're just warming up, my girl.</p>
<p>(LISA turns the car and CHARLOTTE doesn't recognize where they are.)</p>
<p><strong>Charlotte</strong>: Wait, wait, wait. I don't think this is the right way.</p>
<p><strong>Lisa</strong>: (turns to look at CHARLOTTE) It's a shortcut.</p>
<p>(She laughs.)</p>
<p><strong>Charlotte</strong>: A shortcut to where?</p>
<p>(The car hits over something.)</p>
<p><strong>Charlotte</strong>: Stop. Stop the car.</p>
<p><strong>Lisa</strong>: It was just a pothole.</p>
<p>(CHARLOTTE looks back. LISA looks in the mirror.)</p>
<p><strong>Charlotte</strong>: I think you hit someone.</p>
<p>(The tires screech as she stops the car.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. ROADWAY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(The ambulance drives off. The road has been taped off and OFFICERS and other Emergency Personnel walk around.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and SARA get out of the vehicle and make their way toward SGT. O'RILEY who fills them in.)</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. O'Riley</strong>: Blonde behind the wheel. Girlfriend in the passenger seat called it in. Vehicular manslaughter.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at the body down on the roadway. WARRICK snaps a photo. SARA leans over to look at what he's photographing. There are three evidence markers on the roadway, #2-#4, marking pieces of a car taillight.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Taillight?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM shines the flashlight in the plastic bag to show the beer inside.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You been drinking, Warrick?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No. I'm having a block party. I marked it where I found it -- over on the sidewalk over there.</p>
<p>(WARRICK points to the side. GRISSOM and SARA both turn to look at the body. They put their kits down.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM lifts the boy's shirt to expose his chest. SARA takes photos of the chest.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Two distinct tire treads -- one wide ... one narrow.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Given the extensive bruising from the wide tread mark, victim was killed by a larger vehicle. Not that compact.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes off his glasses and looks over at SGT. O'RILEY who is walking toward the car with the two girls. He stops and turns around when GRISSOM calls to him.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hey, O'Riley, I wouldn't book those suspects just yet. I think they ran over a corpse.</p>

[EXT. ROADWAY -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(NICK flashes the siren on and off to get SARA and GRISSOM'S attention. SARA and GRISSOM head toward the car where NICK and CATHERINE are inside.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What's up?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: We got a call about ten minutes ago-- a shooting at Vegas Grounds Coffee Shop, eighth and main. Multiple fatalities.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We want this one.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You guys get over there. Keep me in the loop. Keep the media out of it.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Right. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE shifts in her seat and coughs to get GRISSOM'S attention.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, remember about three months ago I applied to the American Academy meeting in Chicago? Well, the deadline for your approval is end of shift today.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's not a problem.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: There's important papers to be presented ...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You don't have to explain -- Consider it done.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns to let them leave.)</p>

[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(DR. ROBBINS goes over his findings with GRISSOM, SARA and WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Printed your hit-and-run. AFIS found a match -- Brian Clemonds, 22, born in Vegas, and he's deaf.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You can tell he's deaf by his fingerprints?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Actually, yes -- he was printed as part of a state aid program in '81. To confirm, I examined his ear canal.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV to: Inside the ear to the malleus.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: (V.O.) Normally, the malleus is shaped like a hammer -- a long, smooth handle connecting to a blunt head -- but Brian's malleus is knotted, both of them-- birth defect.</p>
<p>(The malleus morphs from normal to deformed. End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: There's a college for the deaf about a mile from where we found him.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So, Brian takes a walk crosses the street, doesn't hear the car, gets creamed.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The vehicle -- probably a truck or an SUV, based on the width of the tire tread-- takes off. Later, along comes a compact - thump -- runs over his dead body.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Maybe, maybe not. </p>
<p>(DR. ROBBINS lifts up the sheet to show them the right hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: See the dried blood on his knuckles? No associated wounding. Blood's probably not his.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You know what that means -- smackdown -- the kid was in a fight.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: That ended in murder.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did you send a sample of his blood to DNA?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: When you find the suspect you'll nail him with his own body fluid.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Has his family been notified?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. VEGAS GROUNDS COFFEE SHOP -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The ambulance drives away. CATHERINE and NICK walks up the sidewalk to the coffee shop.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: One person dead, it's a shame; more than one's a party.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Get ready to pull a double.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and NICK sign in with the OFFICER near the door. They walk into the crime scene and look around.)</p>
<p>(NICK heads for one of the bodies. He notices the CD player and picks up the earphones to listen.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Speed metal. Couldn't hear a bomb go off over this.</p>
<p>(BRASS walks up to them.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Welcome to the caffeine wars. I got four dead, one on the way to the hospital. The kid who belonged to those headphones.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I count two -- where are the others?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: One behind the counter. One in the back room.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Guy wasn't light with the ammo. This place is raining shell casings.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks up to one of the bodies and recognizes him.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, I know this guy.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I bet you do. Who doesn't know Frankie Flynn? Used to own the Orpheus. Lost his gaming license a couple of years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, yeah. Too many dips in the chips.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, you got that r</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Who's the muscle?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: This is Al Robson -- Frankie Flynn's bodyguard.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Cash taken?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Till's full, and all the wallets are accounted for. I don't think anyone was interested in the, uh, cash ... or the coffee.</p>
<p>(NICK and CATHERINE both head for the back of the counter.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You're thinking hit?</p>
<p>(BRASS looks around.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Maybe. Frankie drives a bulletproof car. What does that tell you?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE sees the dead girl behind the counter and closes her eyes for a moment. She sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: She's probably still in high school.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE turns and heads for the back of the shop. She pushes the door open. She and NICK both see the other girl dead at the back of the room. NICK groans at the sight.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE closes her eyes. NICK walks past CATHERINE to check on the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Bless her heart.</p>
<p>(He kneels down. BRASS walks into the back.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Assuming Flynn was the target, and it was a hit the shooter followed Flynn ...</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [SHOOTER'S POV] of FRANKIE FLYNN and AL ROBSON as they walk into the coffee shop.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) ... in the front door ... shot the muscle first ...</p>
<p>(The SHOOTER raises his gun and points at AL ROBSON first. ROBSON reaches for his gun, but the SHOOTER fires. ROBSON goes down.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) ... then Flynn ...</p>
<p>(The SHOOTER turns and fires at FLYNN.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: The BOY with the ear phones on senses someone approach him from behind. He turns.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) ... and some poor kid minding his own business. </p>
<p>(He stands and the SHOOTER fires.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The girls were last.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: THE SHOOTER walks around the counter to the first girl hiding behind the counter. He fires.)</p>
<p>(The final girl hears the gunfire and tries to run out through the back.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) ... four dead. One is still alive.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(BRASS' beeper goes off. He checks it and reads the message.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Make that five. Guy died on the way to the hospital.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE turns around to look at BRASS.)</p>

<p>(GRISSOM and an OFFICER walk up to the door. GRISSOM rings the door bell. The light goes on inside.)</p>
<p>(The porch light goes on outside and the door opens.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mrs. Clemonds?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Clemonds</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: My name is Gil Grissom. I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.</p>
<p>(He holds up his ID for her to look at.)</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Clemonds</strong>: Crime lab?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: May I come in for a minute?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Clemonds</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(She steps aside and GRISSOM walks into the house. The officer waits outside. She closes the door. GRISSOM steps inside and looks around. He notices the bell near the floorboards.)</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Clemonds</strong>: My son is deaf. That bell is connected to the doorbell.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The bell sets off vibrations which reverberate on the floorboards so that he knows someone's at the door.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Clemonds</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mrs. Clemonds, I'm here about your son Brian. There's no easy way to say this.</p>
<p>(She starts to cry.)</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Clemonds</strong>: Oh, god, please, no.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Brian was killed tonight.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Clemonds</strong>: No, no, no. </p>
<p>(She slowly sits down on the couch, crying.)</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Clemonds</strong>: This is my fault.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No. No, it's not.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Clemonds</strong>: When I was pregnant, I had the German measles and the virus took away his hearing. It's my fault.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No, Mrs. Clemonds... we think he might have been murdered.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Clemonds</strong>: (shakes her head) Murdered?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Would you like to talk to a Family Services Counselor?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Clemonds</strong>: (she laughs weakly) Talking is overrated, Mr. Grissom. Just find out who did this to my boy. Please.</p>

<p>(DAVID PHILLIPS assists while DR. ROBBINS goes over the bodies with CATHEIRNE.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: It's been a hell of a night. First the deaf kid, now a hit. It's going to take a while to process all the bodies.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What do you know about Flynn?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: I always start with the celebrities. Frankie Flynn, 38 gunshot wounds to the head and the abdomen.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Any bullets recovered?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Only one -- out of the head -- nine-millimeter .357. I deal with the pin cushions. Ballistics deals with the pins. Shooter could have saved himself a lot of trouble if he'd waited a month or two.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Invasive colon cancer. On his way out.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Guess he got off easy.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Hmmm.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE turns to the next body.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I.D.?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Erin McCarty, 20.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Wonder if she even knew she was pregnant.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Just keeps getting better. Someone notify the husband?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Cop said she's single -- she lives at home with her mother.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: How far along was she?</p>

<p>(Cut to: NICK takes out a bullet casing from the wall. The marker on the wall reads: NS-12.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Another nine-millimeter, just like our casings.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah. Nine bullets, all the same caliber. Looks like Robson never got a shot off. I wouldn't want him as my bodyguard.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks in.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Need help with the measurements?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Sure.</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: They didn't make it.</p>
<p>(BRAD KENDALL sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Brad Kendall</strong>: Did you call their parents?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Once the coroner makes a positive I.D. Their families will be notified.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Shooting occurred around closing time. Is it customary for your employees to close up?</p>
<p><strong>Brad Kendall</strong>: (upset) Erin locked up twice a week -- 10:00 on the nose. She was training Alice - moving on at the end of the month. I can't believe they're gone.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (loudly) Dr. Gilbert ...</p>
<p>(SARA turns around to look at the interpreter who stands behind them.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (looking at the interpreter) We need your help. Brian Clemonds was murdered.</p>
<p>(DR. GILBERT can't see what SARA'S saying.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Was he having any difficulties?</p>
<p>(WARRICK turns around to look at the interpreter &quot;talk&quot; to DR. GILBERT.)</p>
<p>(SARA turns to look at the interpreter.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Anyone have a grudge against him? </p>
<p>(DR. GILBERT watches them, then shakes her head. SARA misinterprets the motion and then continues her questioning, but she's again looking at the interpreter.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We understand you don't want a homicide investigation upsetting your students.</p>
<p><strong>Jane Gilbert</strong>: I'm severely deaf, and I can communicate fine. I'd appreciate it if you'd look at me when you speak to me. I wear a hearing aid and I can read lips. You could have asked if I needed an interpreter.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you.</p>
<p><strong>Jane Gilbert</strong>: There are 152 students at my school. We live together, we study together, we eat together. We're a family. And Brian is dead.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Dr. Gilbert, we're just following protocol. We need to speak with Brian's friends; his roommates. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We'll also need access to his records.</p>
<p><strong>Jane Gilbert</strong>: The crime didn't happen here -- it happened out there.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'm not accusing anybody of anything.</p>
<p><strong>Jane Gilbert</strong>: Neither am I, but there are more of you, right? Send someone else - someone with more understanding of this school of my students.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: But we're here now, and evidence is time-sensitive.</p>
<p><strong>Jane Gilbert</strong>: How can you solve a crime without understanding the victim?</p>
<p>(Frustrated, DR. GILBERT signs to the interpreter. SARA turns to look back at HALLEY.)</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How'd it go at the college?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: They're not cooperating.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, we didn't have a warrant, so she kicked us out.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What did you do?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What did we do? We met with the president, asked a few questions.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: She was kind of hostile.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Like it's our fault we can hear.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: All right. Let's go.</p>

[EXT. GILBERT COLLEGE OF THE DEAF -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Back at the college, GRISSOM, WARRICK and SARA make their way across campus.)</p>
<p>[INT. DR. GILBERT'S OFFICE - DAY]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks into the office.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Dr. Gilbert? I'm Gil Grissom, with the Crime lab. You kicked my people out of your office.</p>
<p><strong>Jane Gilbert</strong>: Well, I'm kicking you out, too.</p>
<p>(She stands up and indicates the door.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM stops her and signs as he speaks.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (speaks &amp; signs) Look, your student is dead. Don't you want to know who's responsible? I do. </p>
<p>(SARA and WARRICK turn to look at each other, surprised to learn this new aspect of GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Jane Gilbert</strong>: Your people can't solve this crime.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (speaks &amp; signs) Why? 'Cause they don't understand the victim? Help them understand.</p>
<p><strong>Jane Gilbert</strong>: When a deaf person meets a hearing person the hearing person so much as says, &quot;I'm normal, you're not.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (speaks &amp; signs) Is that what you think I'm saying? A student is dead. Maybe you feel responsible. Maybe you're angry. But don't be angry with us. We want to help you.</p>
<p><strong>Jane Gilbert</strong>: If I agree to cooperate you will include me in your investigation?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yes, I will. I welcome your involvement. Now, may I see Brian Clemonds' file? Please?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[FILE ROOM]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks through the file.)</p>
<p><strong>Jane Gilbert</strong>: I did nothing wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Brian filed six complaints against his roommate -- Paul Arrington.</p>
<p><strong>Jane Gilbert</strong>: Paul lost his hearing less than a year ago-- a tumor. He hasn't adjusted. He's angry.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And he took it out on Brian. Assaulted him. Brian requested a new roommate. Request denied?</p>
<p><strong>Jane Gilbert</strong>: There were no other available beds.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I want to speak to Paul.</p>
<p><strong>Jane Gilbert</strong>: He doesn't read lips or sign.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (speaks &amp; signs) You don't need to hear or speak to communicate. Or ... commit murder.</p>

<p>(GRISSOM, SARA and WARRICK wait to see PAUL ARRINGTON.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So, you going to tell us how you learned to sign?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No.</p>
<p>(SARA looks at WARRICK. He doesn't say anything.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, the president of the college is a real whack job.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sara, you see deafness as a pathology. For Dr. Gilbert, her deafness is not her handicap -- it's her way of life.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You know, I think you might be siding with her.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: As long as you see this as us versus them, you're going to have problems on this case.</p>
<p>(WARRICK turns and sees DR. GILBERT and PAUL ARRINGTON walk down the hallway toward them.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: The roommate's here.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This explains what we're doing. </p>
<p>[OBSERVATION ROOM]</p>
<p>(WARRICK and SARA walk in to the observation room to watch.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (through speakers) I need for Paul to read it.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What was that all about? Grissom signs.</p>
<p>(SARA shuts the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Do you know what Grissom drinks when he goes out at night?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: He goes out?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Exactly. Who knows anything about that guy? Hey, check that out. </p>
<p>(They watch as GRISSOM puts a head band on PAUL ARRINGTON'S head.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Oh, I've read about this machine. Very Frankenstein.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Brain printing. They call it a visual polygraph.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You've used one of these before?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, back in '97 Grissom and I used one to interview this rapist. The guy was mute but his brain waves spoke loud and clear.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So, you show the suspect slides of the crime scene and if he's our guy ...</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: ... then the oscillator will give him away.</p>
<p>[INTERVIEW ROOM]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM sets the machine up and starts with the first slide. It's of DR. GILBERT.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at the monitor.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Good. He recollects you.</p>
<p>(DR. GILBERT nods. The next slide goes up of the &quot;LIBRARY AND LEARNING RESOURCE CENTER&quot;.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He recollects the college.</p>
<p>(The third slide of BRIAN CLEMONDS goes up on the screen.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He recollects Brian.</p>
<p>(The next slide is of the crime scene where BRIAN is on the roadway.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This is a shot of the crime scene.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at the monitor.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No recollection.</p>
<p>(The next slide goes up. It's a close up of BRIAN on the ground, dead. DR. GILBERT is mortified by the picture. PAUL tries not to show it, but he's upset by the picture. DR. GILBERT watches PAUL carefully and sees it. GRISSOM watches the monitor.)</p>
<p>(She reaches out and rubs his shoulder in comfort.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No recollection of the crime scene or of Brian under these conditions.</p>
<p><strong>Jane Gilbert</strong>: May we go now? </p>
<p>(GRISSOM notices that the pictures are upsetting to them. He turns the monitor off. He removes the head band from PAUL.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM leans over the table and writes something on the pad in front of PAUL. When he's done, he pushes the pad in front of PAUL so he can see it: I'm sorry Paul.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM steps back. PAUL looks at the message, shakes his head, then pushes the pad away.)</p>
<p>(In the observation room, SARA and WARRICK watch as they all head for the door. Before she leaves, DR. GILBERT turns to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Jane Gilbert</strong>: If you want to find the killer look outside the school.</p>
<p>(DR. GILBERT leaves the room.)</p>
<p>(After a moment, GRISSOM turns to look at the observation room.)</p>

[INT. CSI - GRISSOM'S OFFICE -- DAY]</p>
<p>(The clock reads 5:17. Although the second hands moves, we hear nothing. GRISSOM stares at the clock. The camera swings down to show that GRISSOM is tapping the tip of his pen down on the table. Again, we hear nothing.) </p>
<p>(The camera moves over to the tank where GRISSOM keeps his pet spider. He looks down at the spider. We hear nothing.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks into the room. GRISSOM doesn't notice her.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (no audio) Grissom!</p>
<p>(GRISSOM doesn't look up. CATHERINE takes a step closer to his desk.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (no audio) Grissom!</p>
<p>(Again, GRISSOM doesn't turn around. CATHERINE starts to look worried at his non-response.)</p>
<p>(Finally she yells.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (muffled) Grissom!</p>
<p>(He starts and turns around.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM sees CATHERINE and takes out the ear plugs.)</p>
<p>(Immediately, the usual sounds of the office bustle is heard. He places the ear plugs on the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sorry. I was thinking.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: About what it's like to be deaf?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: About what it's like to hear.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Sara told me that you spoke in sign and now you're putting plugs in your ears.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm on a case.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mm-hmm. Is that why you forgot about the conference?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (confused) The what?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You missed the deadline. No Chicago for me.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (remembers) Oh, Catherine ...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: This is the one meeting I needed to attend. I don't always want to be second banana. I can probably do your job. I know that I can do Ecklie's.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I forgot. I'm so sorry.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Make sure to submit the paperwork by the end of the day.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I thought you said that it was too late.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, I knew you'd forget so I upped the deadline -- gave you a buffer. Don't forget again.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE leaves the office.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM sighs, then looks for the paperwork on his desk to get it done.)</p>

[INT. CSI - LAB -- DAY]</p>
<p>(SARA runs the tire treads from the body through the database looking for a match. WARRICK walks into the room carrying an evidence box. He puts the box down.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Those the tire treads from the crime scene?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (nods) I photo'ed the victim's torso and imaged the tread mark-- scanned it -- got it running through a tread assistance CD ROM.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Any hits?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Not yet. CD database-- 11,033 patterns.</p>
<p>(WARRICK exhales at the number as he takes out a shirt.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Could take a while.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Checking out the dead guy's clothes.</p>
<p>(WARRICK looks at the clothes and finds something unusual.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Whoa. What are these?</p>
<p>(Camera zooms in for an extreme close up of some bugs on the shirt.)</p>
<p>(Curious by his reaction, SARA walks over to take a look. She leans in close.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: They look like lice.</p>
<p>(SARA straightens up and tucks her hair back.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Lice?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Wasn't our dead guy clean?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah, he was. Lice adhere to hair follicles. I didn't find any stray hairs on him.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, he was in a fight, right? Maybe his attacker had lice and they crawled off on his sweater and they got comfy and the stray hair blew away.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks by the doorway. He sees them inside and stops.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to SARA) Hey. Any luck on the tire treads?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Computer's still processing but Warrick found something pretty interesting.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM steps into the lab.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You know anything about lice?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah. They make your head itch. And, after head colds the most common medical problem affecting children.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Little problem no one talks about, huh?</p>
<p>(GREG rushes into the lab for GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Hey, Grissom, can I see you a second, Stat.</p>
<p>(He looks up and sees SARA. GREG waves to her. SARA smiles back. GREG leaves the lab.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns around and tells SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Stay on the tire treads. (SARA nods.) Warrick?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM leaves the lab. WARRICK rushes to get a sample of the lice.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah. Right behind you.</p>
<p>(SARA looks at the evidence package on the table. She reads the label, then opens it up. She pours its contents out onto the table. The three pieces of tail light fall onto the table.)</p>
<p>(She takes the flashlight and looks at the numbers, SAE(2)AIP2 ... )</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Frankie Flynn.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE grabs the paper just as BRAD KENDALL turns and walks into the office.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hey, Brad, thanks for coming in. We just got a few more questions.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE sits down. The door closes behind him.)</p>
<p><strong>Brad Kendall</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So you used to work for Frankie Flynn?</p>
<p><strong>Brad Kendall</strong>: Yeah. At the Orpheus. I was a waiter in the coffee shop. He came in all the time.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Sit down. Sit down.</p>
<p>(BRAD KENDALL sits down.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Did you see him outside the coffee shop?</p>
<p><strong>Brad Kendall</strong>: (sighs) Once in a while. He owned the place. He was everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Why don't you tell us about your CCW permit.</p>
<p><strong>Brad Kendall</strong>: I made cash deposits. I carry a concealed weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What kind?</p>
<p><strong>Brad Kendall</strong>: Glock, nine millimeter.</p>

<p>(GRISSOM and WARRICK follow GREG who walks through the hallway, then stops and turns around to look at them.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: I am the man.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Why? What did you do? Let me guess. You ran a DNA profile on the blood from the dead guy's knuckles and you got a match.</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You ran a DNA profile and something very distinctive popped up?</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Not quite.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You made it out of bed and you dressed yourself?</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What is it, Greg?</p>
<p>(GREG turns around and points to the scope. GRISSOM puts his things down and looks.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Just put your nose down the scope.</p>
<p>[SCOPE VIEW]</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Dots of blue light on a red sea.</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Pyoverdin.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Pyoverdin. A pigment excreted from pseudomonas aeruginosa which is a bacteria occasionally found in the bloodstream.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So what does that give us?</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Your killer has fluorescent blue dots in his blood.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So the guy's a glow-stick. How does that help us track him down?</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: (laughs) Haven't I done enough for one day?</p>
<p>(SARA walks into the lab.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We have a lead -- I found a partial serial number on the broken taillight.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I saw it. It's missing six digits. It's useless.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Maybe on its own but the tire tread database kicked out a match. The tire belongs to a ford explorer. A p235-75, manufactured specifically for their SUVs. Only one with the same partial serial number is registered in Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What do you call a guy with blue-dotted blood, lice and keys to a ford explorer?</p>
<p>(SARA smiles.)</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Big Al would already be dead. It doesn't make any sense.</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Like this.</p>
<p>(NICK turns off the back room light and heads for the light on the tripod. CATHERINE gets the small mirror and puts it on the shelf to reflect the light. Together, they work to find the missing bullet.)</p>
<p>(NICK moves the light until it hits the mirror. CATHERINE moves the mirror to show where the bullet could've possibly gone. The light winds up on a bag of<br />
100% COLUMBIAN.)</p>
<p>(NICK checks the bag.. He picks it up and opens it. He pours the beans out and finds the missing bullet. He looks back at CATHERINE and smiles.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I love this job.</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Assuming Erin was running for her life the shooter follows her in the back room shoots her twice -- he would have been shooting toward the parking lot.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: He shot toward the parking lot first and then toward the front of the store.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: He'd only shoot toward the front if there's somebody there. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So who was in the line of fire? What if we have it backwards? What if ... the shooting began back here ... with Erin?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, and somebody else saw. Frankie Flynn was an innocent bystander. Wrong place, wrong time.</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah. Brass talked to her parents. There was no guy in her life.</p>

<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: Check this out.</p>
<p>(BOBBY puts in the barrel and shows it to NICK. Camera zooms in for a close up to show the dent.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Could be an incomplete tool mark. Maybe the guy dropped his gun. Either way, we still don't have the barrel.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: This is true.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: But we've got Kendall's ammo. What about bullet batching?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: Match the bunter marks?</p>

<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: ... on a microscopic level, we should find similar characteristics ...</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Which would link Brad's ammo to the crime even though we can't link his gun.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: Not as airtight as matching the barrel.</p>

<p><strong>Mark Rucker</strong>: (laughs) Do I have to answer that?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm going to just, uh ... rearrange your part a little. Hmm. According to Adam Walkey you were with him in his SUV the other night and your head lice ... confirmed his statement. They also tell me that you were driving.</p>

<p><strong>Mark Rucker</strong>: It's not a classic. It's crap. It's always been crap. Now, this ... this is tight.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) You started taunting him. And then everything escalated.</p>
<p>(They beat BRIAN up and leave BRIAN on the road.)</p>

Charlotte: That club was hot!
Lisa: We're just warming up, my girl.

Charlotte: Wait, wait, wait. I don't think this is the right way.
Lisa:  It's a shortcut.

Charlotte: A shortcut to where?

Charlotte: Stop. Stop the car.
Lisa: It was just a pothole.

Charlotte: I think you hit someone.

CUT TO:

 


Sgt. O'Riley: Blonde behind the wheel. Girlfriend in the passenger seat called it in. Vehicular manslaughter.

Sara: Taillight?
Warrick: Yeah.

Grissom: You been drinking, Warrick?
Warrick: No. I'm having a block party. I marked it where I found it -- over on the sidewalk over there.


Grissom: Two distinct tire treads -- one wide ... one narrow.
Sara: Given the extensive bruising from the wide tread mark, victim was killed by a larger vehicle. Not that compact.

Grissom: Hey, O'Riley, I wouldn't book those suspects just yet. I think they ran over a corpse.
HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS


FADE IN.



Sara: What's up?
Nick: We got a call about ten minutes ago-- a shooting at Vegas Grounds Coffee Shop, eighth and main. Multiple fatalities.
Catherine: We want this one.
Grissom: You guys get over there. Keep me in the loop. Keep the media out of it.
Catherine: Right. 

Catherine: Hey, remember about three months ago I applied to the American Academy meeting in Chicago? Well, the deadline for your approval is end of shift today.
Grissom: It's not a problem.
Catherine: There's important papers to be presented ...
Grissom: You don't have to explain -- Consider it done.
Catherine: Thank you.
Grissom: Good luck.

CUT TO:

 

Dr. Albert Robbins: Printed your hit-and-run. AFIS found a match -- Brian Clemonds, 22, born in Vegas, and he's deaf.
Sara: You can tell he's deaf by his fingerprints?
Dr. Albert Robbins: Actually, yes -- he was printed as part of a state aid program in '81. To confirm, I examined his ear canal.

Dr. Albert Robbins:  Normally, the malleus is shaped like a hammer -- a long, smooth handle connecting to a blunt head -- but Brian's malleus is knotted, both of them-- birth defect.

Grissom: There's a college for the deaf about a mile from where we found him.
Warrick: So, Brian takes a walk crosses the street, doesn't hear the car, gets creamed.
Sara: The vehicle -- probably a truck or an SUV, based on the width of the tire tread-- takes off. Later, along comes a compact - thump -- runs over his dead body.
Dr. Albert Robbins: Maybe, maybe not. 

Dr. Albert Robbins: See the dried blood on his knuckles? No associated wounding. Blood's probably not his.
Warrick: You know what that means -- smackdown -- the kid was in a fight.
Sara: That ended in murder.
Grissom: Did you send a sample of his blood to DNA?
Dr. Albert Robbins: When you find the suspect you'll nail him with his own body fluid.
Grissom: Has his family been notified?
Dr. Albert Robbins: Not yet.
CUT TO:


 
Nick: One person dead, it's a shame; more than one's a party.
Catherine: Get ready to pull a double.
Nick: Thank you.


Nick: Speed metal. Couldn't hear a bomb go off over this.

Brass: Welcome to the caffeine wars. I got four dead, one on the way to the hospital. The kid who belonged to those headphones.
Catherine: I count two -- where are the others?
Brass: One behind the counter. One in the back room.
Nick: Guy wasn't light with the ammo. This place is raining shell casings.

Catherine: Hey, I know this guy.
Brass: I bet you do. Who doesn't know Frankie Flynn? Used to own the Orpheus. Lost his gaming license a couple of years ago.
Catherine: Oh, yeah. Too many dips in the chips.
Brass: Yeah, you got that r
Nick: Who's the muscle?
Brass: This is Al Robson -- Frankie Flynn's bodyguard.
Nick: Cash taken?
Brass: Till's full, and all the wallets are accounted for. I don't think anyone was interested in the, uh, cash ... or the coffee.

Nick: You're thinking hit?

Brass: Maybe. Frankie drives a bulletproof car. What does that tell you?

Nick: She's probably still in high school.


Nick: Bless her heart.

Catherine: Assuming Flynn was the target, and it was a hit the shooter followed Flynn ...
 
Catherine:  ... in the front door ... shot the muscle first ...

Catherine:  ... then Flynn ...


Catherine:  ... and some poor kid minding his own business. 


Catherine: The girls were last.


Catherine:  ... four dead. One is still alive.


Brass: Make that five. Guy died on the way to the hospital.

CUT TO:




Grissom: Mrs. Clemonds?
Mrs. Clemonds: Yes?
Grissom: My name is Gil Grissom. I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.

Mrs. Clemonds: Crime lab?
Grissom: May I come in for a minute?
Mrs. Clemonds: Okay.

Mrs. Clemonds: My son is deaf. That bell is connected to the doorbell.
Grissom: The bell sets off vibrations which reverberate on the floorboards so that he knows someone's at the door.
Mrs. Clemonds: Yes.
Grissom: Mrs. Clemonds, I'm here about your son Brian. There's no easy way to say this.

Mrs. Clemonds: Oh, god, please, no.
Grissom: Brian was killed tonight.
Mrs. Clemonds: No, no, no. 

Mrs. Clemonds: This is my fault.
Grissom: No. No, it's not.
Mrs. Clemonds: When I was pregnant, I had the German measles and the virus took away his hearing. It's my fault.
Grissom: No, Mrs. Clemonds... we think he might have been murdered.
Mrs. Clemonds:  Murdered?
Grissom: Would you like to talk to a Family Services Counselor?
Mrs. Clemonds:  Talking is overrated, Mr. Grissom. Just find out who did this to my boy. Please.

CUT TO:



Dr. Albert Robbins: It's been a hell of a night. First the deaf kid, now a hit. It's going to take a while to process all the bodies.
Catherine: What do you know about Flynn?
Dr. Albert Robbins: I always start with the celebrities. Frankie Flynn, 38 gunshot wounds to the head and the abdomen.
Catherine: Any bullets recovered?
Dr. Albert Robbins: Only one -- out of the head -- nine-millimeter .357. I deal with the pin cushions. Ballistics deals with the pins. Shooter could have saved himself a lot of trouble if he'd waited a month or two.
Catherine: Why?
Dr. Albert Robbins: Invasive colon cancer. On his way out.
Catherine: Guess he got off easy.
Dr. Albert Robbins: Hmmm.

Catherine: I.D.?
David Phillips: Erin McCarty, 20.
Dr. Albert Robbins: Wonder if she even knew she was pregnant.
Catherine: Just keeps getting better. Someone notify the husband?
David Phillips: Cop said she's single -- she lives at home with her mother.
Catherine: How far along was she?
David Phillips: About six weeks.
Catherine: She knew.

CUT TO:

 


Nick: Another nine-millimeter, just like our casings.
Brass: Yeah. Nine bullets, all the same caliber. Looks like Robson never got a shot off. I wouldn't want him as my bodyguard.

Catherine: Need help with the measurements?
Brass: Sure.

Officer Metcalf: Captain, I got the manager outside.

CUT TO:

 

Brass: Okay.
Officer: That's the guy right there.
Brass: This one?
Officer: Yep. That's the one.

Brass: I'm Detective Brass. Catherine Willows. Nick Stokes from the crime lab.
Brad Kendall: Brad Kendall. I heard it on the news. They're saying it was some kind of a hit. Where are Erin and Alice?
Brass: They didn't make it.

Brad Kendall: Did you call their parents?
Nick: Once the coroner makes a positive I.D. Their families will be notified.
Catherine: Shooting occurred around closing time. Is it customary for your employees to close up?
Brad Kendall:  Erin locked up twice a week -- 10:00 on the nose. She was training Alice - moving on at the end of the month. I can't believe they're gone.
CUT TO:


 
 
Sara:  Dr. Gilbert ...

Sara:  We need your help. Brian Clemonds was murdered.

Warrick: Was he having any difficulties?


Sara: Anyone have a grudge against him? 

Sara: We understand you don't want a homicide investigation upsetting your students.
Jane Gilbert: I'm severely deaf, and I can communicate fine. I'd appreciate it if you'd look at me when you speak to me. I wear a hearing aid and I can read lips. You could have asked if I needed an interpreter.
Sara: I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you.
Jane Gilbert: There are 152 students at my school. We live together, we study together, we eat together. We're a family. And Brian is dead.
Warrick: Dr. Gilbert, we're just following protocol. We need to speak with Brian's friends; his roommates. 
Sara: We'll also need access to his records.
Jane Gilbert: The crime didn't happen here -- it happened out there.
Sara: I'm not accusing anybody of anything.
Jane Gilbert: Neither am I, but there are more of you, right? Send someone else - someone with more understanding of this school of my students.
Warrick: But we're here now, and evidence is time-sensitive.
Jane Gilbert: How can you solve a crime without understanding the victim?

Halley: Um ... she's kicking us out.


CUT TO:

 

Warrick: Hey.
Grissom: How'd it go at the college?
Sara: They're not cooperating.
Warrick: Yeah, we didn't have a warrant, so she kicked us out.
Grissom: What did you do?
Sara: What did we do? We met with the president, asked a few questions.
Warrick: She was kind of hostile.
Sara: Like it's our fault we can hear.
Grissom: All right. Let's go.
CUT TO:

 



Grissom: Dr. Gilbert? I'm Gil Grissom, with the Crime lab. You kicked my people out of your office.
Jane Gilbert: Well, I'm kicking you out, too.


Grissom:  Look, your student is dead. Don't you want to know who's responsible? I do. 

Jane Gilbert: Your people can't solve this crime.
Grissom:  Why? 'Cause they don't understand the victim? Help them understand.
Jane Gilbert: When a deaf person meets a hearing person the hearing person so much as says, &quot;I'm normal, you're not.&quot;
Grissom:  Is that what you think I'm saying? A student is dead. Maybe you feel responsible. Maybe you're angry. But don't be angry with us. We want to help you.
Jane Gilbert: If I agree to cooperate you will include me in your investigation?
Grissom: Yes, I will. I welcome your involvement. Now, may I see Brian Clemonds' file? Please?
CUT TO:


Jane Gilbert: I did nothing wrong.
Grissom: Brian filed six complaints against his roommate -- Paul Arrington.
Jane Gilbert: Paul lost his hearing less than a year ago-- a tumor. He hasn't adjusted. He's angry.
Grissom: And he took it out on Brian. Assaulted him. Brian requested a new roommate. Request denied?
Jane Gilbert: There were no other available beds.
Grissom: I want to speak to Paul.
Jane Gilbert: He doesn't read lips or sign.
Grissom:  You don't need to hear or speak to communicate. Or ... commit murder.
FADE OUT.

FADE IN.



Sara: So, you going to tell us how you learned to sign?
Grissom: No.

Sara: Well, the president of the college is a real whack job.
Grissom: Sara, you see deafness as a pathology. For Dr. Gilbert, her deafness is not her handicap -- it's her way of life.
Sara: You know, I think you might be siding with her.
Grissom: As long as you see this as us versus them, you're going to have problems on this case.

Warrick: The roommate's here.


CUT TO:

 

Grissom: This explains what we're doing. 


Grissom:  I need for Paul to read it.
Sara: What was that all about? Grissom signs.

Warrick: Do you know what Grissom drinks when he goes out at night?
Sara: He goes out?
Warrick: Exactly. Who knows anything about that guy? Hey, check that out. 

Sara: Oh, I've read about this machine. Very Frankenstein.
Warrick: Brain printing. They call it a visual polygraph.
Sara: You've used one of these before?
Warrick: Yeah, back in '97 Grissom and I used one to interview this rapist. The guy was mute but his brain waves spoke loud and clear.
Sara: So, you show the suspect slides of the crime scene and if he's our guy ...
Warrick: ... then the oscillator will give him away.



Grissom: Good. He recollects you.

Grissom: He recollects the college.

Grissom: He recollects Brian.

Grissom: This is a shot of the crime scene.

Grissom: No recollection.


Grissom: No recollection of the crime scene or of Brian under these conditions.
Jane Gilbert: May we go now? 




Jane Gilbert: If you want to find the killer look outside the school.


CUT TO:


 


Catherine:  Grissom!

Catherine:  Grissom!


Catherine:  Grissom!



Grissom: Sorry. I was thinking.
Catherine: About what it's like to be deaf?
Grissom: About what it's like to hear.
Catherine: Sara told me that you spoke in sign and now you're putting plugs in your ears.
Grissom: I'm on a case.
Catherine: Mm-hmm. Is that why you forgot about the conference?
Grissom:  The what?
Catherine: You missed the deadline. No Chicago for me.
Grissom:  Oh, Catherine ...
Catherine: This is the one meeting I needed to attend. I don't always want to be second banana. I can probably do your job. I know that I can do Ecklie's.
Grissom: I forgot. I'm so sorry.

Catherine: Make sure to submit the paperwork by the end of the day.
Grissom: I thought you said that it was too late.
Catherine: Well, I knew you'd forget so I upped the deadline -- gave you a buffer. Don't forget again.


CUT TO:



Warrick: Those the tire treads from the crime scene?
Sara:  I photo'ed the victim's torso and imaged the tread mark-- scanned it -- got it running through a tread assistance CD ROM.
Warrick: Any hits?
Sara: Not yet. CD database-- 11,033 patterns.

Sara: Could take a while.
Warrick: Yeah.
Sara: What are you doing?
Warrick: Checking out the dead guy's clothes.

Warrick: Whoa. What are these?


Sara: What?
Warrick: They look like lice.

Sara: Lice?
Warrick: Wasn't our dead guy clean?
Sara: Yeah, he was. Lice adhere to hair follicles. I didn't find any stray hairs on him.
Warrick: Well, he was in a fight, right? Maybe his attacker had lice and they crawled off on his sweater and they got comfy and the stray hair blew away.

Grissom:  Hey. Any luck on the tire treads?
Sara: Computer's still processing but Warrick found something pretty interesting.

Warrick: You know anything about lice?
Grissom: Yeah. They make your head itch. And, after head colds the most common medical problem affecting children.
Warrick: Little problem no one talks about, huh?

Greg Sanders: Hey, Grissom, can I see you a second, Stat.


Grissom: Stay on the tire treads.  Warrick?

Warrick: Yeah. Right behind you.


Sara: A few more numbers and this could have been cake.
CUT TO:


 
Brass: Guess who used to sign Brad Kendall's paychecks six years ago?
Catherine: Frankie Flynn.
Brass: Oh, yeah.

Brass: Hey, Brad, thanks for coming in. We just got a few more questions.

Brad Kendall: Sure.
Brass: So you used to work for Frankie Flynn?
Brad Kendall: Yeah. At the Orpheus. I was a waiter in the coffee shop. He came in all the time.
Brass: Sit down. Sit down.

Brass: Did you see him outside the coffee shop?
Brad Kendall:  Once in a while. He owned the place. He was everywhere.
Catherine: Why don't you tell us about your CCW permit.
Brad Kendall: I made cash deposits. I carry a concealed weapon.
Catherine: What kind?
Brad Kendall: Glock, nine millimeter.
Brass: We'll need to see the weapon and any spare ammo.
Brad Kendall: Yeah, of course, I'll bring it in.
CUT TO:



Greg Sanders: I am the man.
Warrick: Why? What did you do? Let me guess. You ran a DNA profile on the blood from the dead guy's knuckles and you got a match.
Greg Sanders: No.
Grissom: You ran a DNA profile and something very distinctive popped up?
Greg Sanders: Not quite.
Warrick: You made it out of bed and you dressed yourself?
Greg Sanders: No.
Grissom: What is it, Greg?

Greg Sanders: Just put your nose down the scope.

Grissom: Dots of blue light on a red sea.
Greg Sanders: Pyoverdin.
Grissom: Pyoverdin. A pigment excreted from pseudomonas aeruginosa which is a bacteria occasionally found in the bloodstream.
Warrick: So what does that give us?
Greg Sanders: Your killer has fluorescent blue dots in his blood.
Warrick: So the guy's a glow-stick. How does that help us track him down?
Greg Sanders:  Haven't I done enough for one day?

Sara: We have a lead -- I found a partial serial number on the broken taillight.
Grissom: I saw it. It's missing six digits. It's useless.
Sara: Maybe on its own but the tire tread database kicked out a match. The tire belongs to a ford explorer. A p235-75, manufactured specifically for their SUVs. Only one with the same partial serial number is registered in Vegas.
Grissom: What do you call a guy with blue-dotted blood, lice and keys to a ford explorer?

Warrick: A suspect?

Grissom: A killer.
FADE OUT.


;


FADE IN.



Jane Gilbert: You found the car that ran over Brian?
Grissom: Yes. 

Grissom: The SUV's registered to Adam Walkey. He's 18 years old; no prior complaints. We're processing it now. I promised to keep you informed.
Jane Gilbert:  You kept your word.
CUT TO:



 
Warrick: Hmm.

Sara: Lice?
Warrick: Creepy critters in the driver's seat.

Sara: So ... that's why Grissom's late.
Warrick: You just don't like other women in his life.
Sara: I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.
Warrick: Affirmative on the head lice.
Sara: Taillights match.
Grissom: We have a suspect.
CUT TO:



Randy Painter: I'm advising Adam to invoke his fifth amendment rights.
Sgt. O'Riley: No charges have been filed and I haven't asked a question.
Randy Painter: Go ahead and ask. He won't answer. 
Grissom: Well, that's why I suggested we meet here. I don't need him to talk. I just want his blood. 
Randy Painter: Well, for that, you're going to need a warrant. 

Randy Painter: This warrant is for blood ... 

Randy Painter: ... and a scalp search.

Grissom: It's a licemeister.  We're going to comb your hair.

CUT TO:



Catherine: Talk to me.
Nick: Good news, bad news. Same caliber, different gun.

Catherine: Bobby?
Bobby Dawson: Striations don't match. 

Bobby Dawson: The gun that killed those five people at the coffee house isn't your store manager's. The good news is -- all of the nine millimeter bullets fired at the scene ... from the same gun. 

Bobby Dawson: You're looking for only one guy.
Catherine: Well, what about the breach-face marks on the casings?
Bobby Dawson:  Indeterminate.
Catherine: Hmm. 

Catherine: Well, well ... looks like you got zip.
Brass: I got a ton of people out interviewing every two-bit stiff that ever had a beef against Flynn. They're all doing the smart thing -- keeping their mouth shut.
Catherine: So we have no statements or physical evidence indicating it was a hit on Flynn.
Nick: What we have is five dead bodies.
Catherine: Yeah ... why?
Brass: You know something I don't know?
Catherine: Not yet. 

Catherine: Nick?
Nick:  Smoke and mirrors.
CUT TO:




Nick: If it was a hit, the guy came to the front door took out Al and Frankie, and got the witnesses. Bullets will confirm it. Shooter was standing here when he shot Al ...

Nick: ... bamm. Once in the chest. This is Flynn. 

Nick: One miss ... 

Nick: ... One hit ... one through and through.


Catherine: Headphones.

Catherine: Ricochet. Through and through.



Nick: Each victim gets a different color. Blue beams are isolated. The kid with the cd player was alone.

Catherine: Flynn was closest to the door.

Nick: Shooter was positioned between Flynn and the front door. Flynn eats it ... ? Nah.
Nick: I would have taken out big Al ... bodyguard first.
Catherine: Me, too.
Nick: Ident found both of the bodyguards' paws on the counter.



Catherine: What if the shooter was here when he shot big Al?
Nick: Big Al would already be dead. It doesn't make any sense.
Catherine: If the shooter walked through the front door.
Nick: What if he came through the back?


Catherine: Erin McCarty-- the employee who was supposed to close up.
Nick: Yeah. Yeah. Shot twice in the back while headed for the rear exit.


Catherine: If she was headed towards the parking lot, how do you explain this ricochet?
Nick: What?

Nick: Like this.

(NICK moves the light until it hits the mirror. CATHERINE moves the mirror to show where the bullet could've possibly gone. The light winds up on a bag of
100% COLUMBIAN.)

Nick: I love this job.
Catherine: The ricochet went out into the store.  There's no hole in the door. There's no hole in the door 'cause the door had to have been open.
Nick: Assuming Erin was running for her life the shooter follows her in the back room shoots her twice -- he would have been shooting toward the parking lot.
Catherine: He shot toward the parking lot first and then toward the front of the store.
Nick: He'd only shoot toward the front if there's somebody there. 
Catherine: So who was in the line of fire? What if we have it backwards? What if ... the shooting began back here ... with Erin?
Nick: Yeah, and somebody else saw. Frankie Flynn was an innocent bystander. Wrong place, wrong time.
Catherine: The target was Erin ... the pregnant girl and the rest was damage control.
CUT TO:


 
Warrick: Adam Walkey doesn't have lice?
Grissom: Not even lice eggs.
SARA; Maybe he got rid of them since the other night.
Grissom: Delousing agents take time to kick in. There would have been evidence of the infestation.

Greg Sanders: Hey... got good news. Walkey's blood sample ...
Grissom: Pseudomonas aeruginosa?
Greg Sanders: Fluorescent blue.


Warrick: Same as the blood we found on Brian's knuckle.
Grissom: Greg, start a DNA comparison. This gives us enough to hold Walkey.

Warrick: It's just like Dr. Gilbert said ... the killer came from out here.
Grissom: Dr. Gilbert can afford her personal bias. We can't. 

Grissom: And we need a lot more than day-glo bacteria to get a conviction. 
FADE OUT.


FADE IN.


 
Nick: You really think Erin knew she was pregnant? I mean, six weeks?
Catherine: Twenty-year-old girl, living at home? She would have taken a test if she was five seconds late -- panic city.
Nick: Yeah. Brass talked to her parents. There was no guy in her life.
Catherine: Well, it's not immaculate conception. If the guy was Mr. Right she would have told her folks. Which means he was Mr. Wrong. Maybe Mr. Married.


Dr. Albert Robbins: Back for more?
Catherine: You still have the pregnant girl?
Dr. Albert Robbins: Mortuary is going to pick her up later this afternoon.
Nick: Stall them. We want a paternity test.
Dr. Albert Robbins: At six weeks?
Catherine: Six weeks with half of someone else's DNA in her body.

CUT TO:

 

Sara: Check this out. 

Sara: This fabric matches the victim's sweater.
Warrick: That's the muffler. And this is the back of the car.
Sara: And the taillight was smashed.
Warrick: There's no way this car was moving forward when it ran over Brian Clemonds' body.
Sara: Who drives backwards on a downtown street?
CUT TO:



Sgt. O'Riley: First degree murder. That's how we see it.

Randy Painter: It's okay.  In that case, my client is now prepared to make a statement. Tell him, Adam.
Adam Walkey: I may have hit the guy.
Sgt. O'Riley: That's some statement.
Adam Walkey: Okay. I remember hitting something. It was dark. I-I just kept driving. Didn't look back.
Grissom: Adam ... we found lice in the driver's seat of your vehicle but your scalp was clean. Was there anyone else there? A witness who might support your account?

Adam Walkey:  Yeah, someone was with me. Mark. Mark Rucker. He can confirm everything I told you.

Jane Gilbert: I want to see him. 

Jane Gilbert: Is that the coward who killed Brian?

Jane Gilbert:  What happened? He scare you? Talk a little funny? Make a lot of noises? Screamed? Or maybe he just looked at you the wrong way?
Adam Gilbert: Get away from me!

Jane Gilbert:  You make me sick.

CUT TO:

 

Jane Gilbert:  You said you'd include me.
Grissom: You offered to help with my investigation and now you're compromising it.
Jane Gilbert: You found the killer.
Grissom:  Who says it was a hit-and-run. Not murder. He has a witness.
Jane Gilbert: Who will lie for him.
Grissom: The witness can say whatever he wants. The important thing is that Adam Walkey was not alone when he killed Brian.

Grissom: Until now, I did not know who was with him.
Jane Gilbert: And now you do.
Grissom: His witness is our other suspect.
CUT TO:


 
Nick: 911 page?

Nick: What's up?
Bobby Dawson: Right gun, wrong barrel.
Nick: Son of a bitch swapped the gun barrel out.
Bobby Dawson: Check this out.

Nick: Could be an incomplete tool mark. Maybe the guy dropped his gun. Either way, we still don't have the barrel.
Bobby Dawson: This is true.
Nick: But we've got Kendall's ammo. What about bullet batching?
Bobby Dawson: Match the bunter marks?
Nick: Every casing's got two pieces of information on it: Manufacturer and caliber.
Bobby Dawson: Etched in by an electrodischarge machine. 

Bobby Dawson: Every casing from a given batch of ammo has the same markings.
Nick: So if you compared the casings we collected at the crime scene with the casings from Brad Kendall's gun...
Bobby Dawson: ... on a microscopic level, we should find similar characteristics ...
Nick: Which would link Brad's ammo to the crime even though we can't link his gun.
Bobby Dawson: Not as airtight as matching the barrel.
Nick: But still enough to build a case.
Bobby Dawson: What about motive?
Nick: Well, Catherine's working on a hunch.
CUT TO:



Brad Kendall: Me? The father? No way. I'm married. I don't fool around.
Brass: Would you like us to explain the mechanics of s*x in the workplace?
Catherine: You're the manager. Erin was the employee.
Brass: You had the power. Happens all the time.
Brad Kendall: You got it all wrong.
Catherine: Maybe we do-- we all make mistakes-- but, just to be sure why don't you give us a sample of your DNA and you'll be on your way.
Brad Kendall: I don't believe this. Talk to anyone. I'm not like that.
Brass: I've got a court order.

Brad Kendall: It was a one-time thing. I didn't even know she was pregnant.
CUT TO:

 
 
Sgt. O'Riley: I read him his rights. Last chance for a lawyer.
Mark Rucker: I didn't do anything. Why would I need a lawyer?
Sgt. O'Riley:  Fire away.
Grissom: I have just one question: Does your head itch?
Mark Rucker:  Do I have to answer that?
Grissom: I'm going to just, uh ... rearrange your part a little. Hmm. According to Adam Walkey you were with him in his SUV the other night and your head lice ... confirmed his statement. They also tell me that you were driving.
Mark Rucker: Yeah, yeah, I was with him. And, like he told you, we didn't know he hit the guy.
Sgt. O'Riley: How do you know what Adam told us?

Grissom: Now, why don't you tell us what really happened.
Mark Rucker: Well, it was around midnight ... 

Mark Rucker:  ... and we were listening to the radio. I changed the station. Adam got pissed.
Adam Walkey: Dude, what are you doing? That song is a classic.
Mark Rucker: It's not a classic. It's crap. It's always been crap. Now, this ... this is tight.

Mark Rucker: Wh-what was that?
Adam Walkey: Probably a dog. Let's get out of here.

Mark Rucker: We just kept driving. It's the truth.
Grissom: The evidence says otherwise.
Mark Rucker: What are you talking about?
Grissom: Well, there weren't just lice in the SUV. There were lice on the victim's sweater.
Mark Rucker: So who cares about lice?
Grissom: Do you know what lice eat? 

Grissom: Blood. I'm pretty sure I can prove that the lice on Brian Clemonds came from your head.
Mark: We got out of the car.

Mark Rucker: We got to call the paramedics.
Adam Walkey: We tell anybody, we are in trouble. We could go to jail.

Mark Rucker: But I didn't want to leave him like that. Adam talked me into it. He had a scholarship to duke next year, you know. He couldn't risk it.

Grissom: Let me tell you what I think happened.

Grissom:  You and Adam saw Brian walking out of a liquor store carrying a six-pack. You're underage. Maybe you wanted him to front you some beer.

Adam Walkey: Hey, man, can you do us a favor?
Grissom:  Brian doesn't respond.
Adam Walkey: Hey!  What's his problem? MARK RUCKER: Let's find out.

Grissom:  ... Then you got out of the car.

Adam Walkey: Hey, moron, we just want you to buy us some beer. MARK RUCKER: How about we just grab yours, huh? ADAM WALKEY: What do you want? MARK RUCKER: What do you say? You going to give it up?
Grissom:  You started taunting him. And then everything escalated.

Grissom:  The blood on the victim's knuckles led us to Adam.

Grissom:  The average male loses 80 hairs a day. A stray hair left behind lice, which brings us to you.



Grissom: It would have ended there but, as you were about to drive away, something caught your attention.

Grissom:  Something in your rearview mirror.



Grissom: And you took off.
Mark Rucker: I want a lawyer.
Grissom: Let me tell you something, son.
Sgt. O'Riley: Gil, the interrogation is over. He's requested counsel.

Grissom: Fine. No more questions.

Grissom: Just this. You want to know why Brian Clemonds ran away from you? It was dark, you were shouting at him and he didn't understand what you were saying. Brian Clemonds was deaf. 

Grissom: He was afraid of you. But you were more afraid of him ... weren't you?

CUT TO:


 

Brad Kendall: What am I looking at?
Nick: Microscopic surface analysis. This ought to make things more clear.
Catherine: A bunter tool makes a unique mark.

Nick: Casings from your gun are on the right. Casings collected from the crime scene are on the left.
Catherine: They're identical. You came here that night ... to kill Erin.

Catherine: You came in through the back. Erin was in the office.
Brad Kendall: We got to talk.
Erin McCarty: I'm tired of talking to you.
Brad Kendall: Listen to me!
Erin McCarty: I'm tired of listening to you.
Brad: I will take care of this.
Erin McCarty: All you take care of is yourself.
Brad Kendal: Erin, think! Use your head for once. I'm not going to let you ruin my life!

Erin McCarty: I already have thought about it. I'm going to have this baby and you are going to support it. 

Erin McCarty: I'll let you know if it's a boy or a girl.


Catherine: But Alice saw so you shot her.

Catherine:  You thought that Erin had locked up but there was a kid drinking coffee 
(BRAD looks up and sees the customer at the table. The door opens and FLYNN and AL ROBSON walk into the shop. 
Catherine: ... and then things got out of hand.



Brass: Brad Kendall, you're under arrest for the murder of Frankie Flynn, Al Robson, Roy Hinton, Alice Neely and Erin McCarty.
Nick: Six weeks pregnant with your child.

Brad Kendall: I didn't mean for it to happen like that. I just wanted to talk.
Catherine: Is that why you brought your gun?
CUT TO:



Grissom: Some people are just afraid. 
Jane Gilbert: And that's why they killed Brian. Because he was different. You don't see us as different.

Grissom: You're not.
Jane Gilbert:  Who taught you to sign?
Grissom:  My mother.
Jane Gilbert:  Tell me about her. And use your hands. You're a little rusty.


Grissom:  She lost her hearing when she was eight.

Grissom:  ... loved to swim. I asked her what it was like to be deaf. She told me to stick my head under the water ...
Jane Gilbert:  True.
Grissom:  She taught me not to make fun of &quot;she&quot; ... &quot;you&quot; ...
&quot;everyone&quot; ... &quot;the same&quot;.

Jane Gilbert:  ...
Grissom:  ...
Jane Gilbert:  ...

FADE TO BLACK.

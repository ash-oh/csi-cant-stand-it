<p>(Lightning flashes and thunder crashes. It's raining in Nevada tonight.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CAR -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The driver drives through the rain. There's a small film reel charm hanging from his rear-view mirror. It's a heavy rain outside.)</p>
<p>(The driver sees a hitchhiker standing outside the side of the road carrying a sign, &quot;VEGAS&quot;. The driver passes him by, slows the car down and thinks about it.)</p>
<p>(He reverses the car and stops to pick up the hitch-hiker. PETE WALKER opens the car door and calls out.)</p>
<p><strong>Pete Walker</strong>: Hey, you need a lift? (The hitchhiker climbs into the car and closes the door.) So, where are you headed?</p>
<p><strong>Paul Millander</strong>: It's not where I'm headed.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. GOOD SPRINGS - WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Police cars park in the front of the home, their lights flashing. CATHERINE exits the vehicle. She and GRISSOM meet up with the DETECTIVE.)</p>
<p><strong>Det.</strong>: Welcome to Good Springs.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Long drive.</p>
<p><strong>Det.</strong>: Well, I know it's out of your jurisdiction, but your name is on the tape.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>Det.</strong>: Inside. We left the recorder where we found it.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>Det.</strong>: Victim's wallet.</p>
<p>(The DETECTIVE hands the wallet to CATHERINE. He lifts up the crime scene tape for GRISSOM and CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>(They head into the warehouse.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. GOOD SPRINGS - WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Inside, the place is empty except for a single bathtub in the center of the large room. GRISSOM and CATHERINE walk to the tub.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (reading) Pete Walker, California. Date of birth: August 17, 1957. It's got to be the work of Paul Millander. What do you think brought him back out?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (looks around) The rain?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hasn't changed his M.O .-- Kills men whose birthdays are on the anniversary of his father's murder.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: In descending order -- first victim was August 17, 1959; second victim, August 17, 1958; this guy, 1957.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE picks up the micro cassette tape recorder.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Ready for this?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I have a pretty good idea what it's going to say.</p>
<p><strong>Pete Walker</strong>: (anxiously) (on tape) My name is Pete Walker. I reside at 715 Lady El Sol and I'm 44 years of age. I'm going to kill myself. I'd like to say &quot;I love you&quot; to my mother. I'm so sorry, I never wanted to put you through this. I just can't do it anymore.&quot;</p>
<p>(On the tape, there's a gunshot.)</p>
<p><strong>Paul Millander's Voice</strong>: (on tape) Happy... birthday, Mr. Grissom.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Isn't your birthday in August?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: August 17, 1956.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks shocked. GRISSOM doesn't.)</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER. ROLL TITLE CREDITS.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
[INT. GOOD SPRINGS - WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(SARA, NICK and WARRICK walk in and up to GRISSOM and CATHERINE who are already working on the bathtub.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey. Is it true? Millander?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah, it's true. Gunshot, suicide script leaves the body in a bathtub.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM bags the tape recorder.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Paul Millander. Remember the first victim? Royce Harmon?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Scene from 1X01: Pilot and of ROYCE HARMON in the bathtub.)</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: Scene from 1X08: Anonymous and of STUART RAMPLER in the bathtub.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) Stuart Rampler, second ... </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: ... and now ... Pete Walker.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Grissom, Catherine briefed us about your birth date.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, what's up with that?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Coincidence. Make anything more of it gives Millander more power than he deserves.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: We work together; he can't outsmart all five of us.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yes, he can. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (takes over) Plan of attack -- split up. Nick, take the tape over to A-V. Break it down. Warrick, Sara -- examine the perimeter. We need to know how he got in and got out. We'll stay with the body.</p>
<p>(NICK, SARA and WARRICK pick up their kits and leave.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to CATHERINE) Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Anytime.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. GOOD SPRINGS - WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(SARA walks up to WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Rain washed away everything. What I got will never hold up in court.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, I got some mud prints. Check these out.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: This is the point of origin. They stop at the warehouse threshold.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: He must've taken off his boots before he stepped in. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Only one set of prints ... </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Check out the depth of the impression compared to mine.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: He carried the body in. The extra weight explains the deeper impression.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Shoot it.</p>
<p>(WARRICK puts a ruler down next to the print and SARA snaps a picture.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. GOOD SPRINGS - WAREHOUSE - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE snaps a photograph.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Cath ... Come here, take a look at this.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at the body in the bathtub. CATHERINE stands up to see what he wants her to look at.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's not lividity.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: He's got stippling on the side of his face. </p>
<p>(Camera close up of the stippling on the skin.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: From what I can tell, he was shot once in the chest. Unburned gunpowder wouldn't plume this way.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No entry wounds near his face.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'll have Robbins check for leaks. Maybe he can find a hidden bullet.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE stands up and walks over to the other side of the body. She finds a strand of hair.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Wait ... wait a minute. I got something.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE picks it up.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hello, Dolly. Dark hair, 12 inches. Female?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So another victim ... or an accomplice?</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - A/V LAB -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(NICK and ARCHIE go over the tape recording.)</p>
<p><strong>Pete Walker</strong>: ( Recorded voice ): My name is Pete Walker. I reside at 715 Lady Del Sol ...</p>
<p><strong>Archie Johnson</strong>: First things first. This tape was not recorded in the warehouse. No auditory echo.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Contained quarters first.</p>
<p><strong>Archie Johnson</strong>: Yeah, a car, a small SUV. The tape was an inch from his mouth. Sibilant pops bear that out. Helps that the killer uses hi-fi mini-cassettes. Picks up everything let me get rid of the wipers.</p>
<p>(ARCHIE clicks on the keyboard and plays a sound extracted from the main tape. It's a low whirring noise.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What is that, that whir sound?</p>
<p><strong>Archie Johnson</strong>: I don't know yet. But ... recognize this?</p>
<p>(ARCHIE extracts another sound from the main tape. He plays it. It's a country song.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Oh, yeah. Willie Hank's &quot;Don't Pay the Ransom.&quot; I'll contact the local country and western stations get a time and tape on when the song aired. Establish a timeline. What else?</p>
<p><strong>Archie Johnson</strong>: Now, here's where it gets funky. Watch my sensor levels.</p>
<p><strong>Pete Walker</strong>: (on tape) My name is Pete Walker. I reside at ... </p>
<p><strong>Archie Johnson</strong>: See how the color wands gravitate towards the bottom right corner?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Archie Johnson</strong>: There's an auditory imbalance.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: From what, a blown speaker?</p>
<p><strong>Archie Johnson</strong>: A blown left speaker. Sounds like the driver's side one blew.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Pulling all of the sound bottom right. Now if that were true the victim may have been sitting in the passenger seat.</p>
<p><strong>Archie Johnson</strong>: What does that get you?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Millander was driving.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. GOOD SPRINGS - ROADSIDE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(SARA and WARRICK walk up to BRASS who is holding the &quot;VEGAS&quot; sign.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I believe hitchhiking is illegal in Clark County.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, you got me. Came with the car along with the registration. The R.O.'S our vic Pete Walker.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Who flagged it?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Nevada State Patrol.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So, this is Walker's car. Millander was hitchhiking. Guy stops to do a favor ... ends up dead.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, but how would Millander know that the guy who'd pick him up had a birthday August 17, 1957?</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(ROBBINS goes over the initial findings with GRISSOM. He does a scan on the body and stops over the bullet hole.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: There's the initial bullet hole. No other leaks. Died from a single gunshot wound to the chest just like the others.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The others didn't have stippling on the side of their faces. Unburned gunpowder doesn't change direction and stick. </p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV of a gun shot in the chest and the gunpowder puffing away from the bullet hole. End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Unless ... he turned his face away from the gun.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Not likely due to the origin of the facial burn.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Stippling adhering to the side of the victim's face. End of flashback. Resume to present.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Nobody misses from this distance.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: True.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I think this might be intentional.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Scene from 1X08:Anonymous. Inside Halloweird, PAUL MILLANDER shows a sculpture to GRISSOM. Half of the face is normal, the other half is deformed.)</p>
<p><strong>Paul Millander</strong>: I-I-I call it &quot;good versus evil.&quot;</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He's telling me he's going to show me both sides.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. PETE WALKER'S CAR -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(SARA and WARRICK examine PETE WALKER'S car.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I found some G.S.R.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p>(WARRICK takes a sample.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: That's why Grissom didn't find a bullet.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It went out the window.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It went out the window.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: PETE WALKER sitting in his car reading from the script. The window is rolled down. PAUL MILLANDER turns the gun on PETE WALKER and fires.)</p>
<p><strong>Pete Walker</strong>: I'm so sorry. I never wanted to put you through this. I just can't do it anymore. I've lost hope.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'm going to call Nick, tell him we found out what that unidentified whir sound was -- the window going down.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - DNA LAB]</p>
<p>(Scope view of the hair tag.)</p>
<p><strong>Sanders</strong>: Your planted hair is full of information. It's got a complete follicular tag.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, the vic had light brown hair so we know it's not his.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Could be Millander's.</p>
<p>(GREG shows CATHERINE the results.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, that's impossible. The amelogenin on the follicle came back xx-- female.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, back to that again. Another victim, or an accomplice?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, but what decade?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Look under 400-X. The tag cell is aged.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks at the scope. Scope POV shows the follicular tag.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So Millander planted an aged hair? But once exposed, the tag would dry up and fall off, especially in transport.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Not if he nurtured it. Kept it in a freezer.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: That would work.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay, so what's he trying to tell us? That he used to kill women?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Maybe just one.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Grounds?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (shakes his head) I don't know yet.</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>

<p>FADE IN.</p>

[INT. CSI - GARAGE]</p>
<p>(NICK examines PETE WALKER'S car. He checks out the glove compartment, the dash and finds receipts in the front seat divider.)</p>
<p>(In the background, someone enters the garage.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Is this the car the guy was killed in?</p>
<p>(NICK is startled by GREG.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: He was killed in the warehouse -- and don't sneak up on a person like that.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Now you know how I feel, like ten times a day. So what's this Millander guy's thing?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: He saw his dad killed when he was a kid over some money dispute. Ends up killing guys himself.</p>
<p>(On the bottom of the front seat divider, NICK finds a number, 909987-23.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Check that out. Eight digit number with a dash.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Hmm ... Pep boys receipt? Dry cleaning tags?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, whatever it is it happened during the summer. Paper only burns itself into plastic in high levels of heat.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: So what kind of paper item would you she into the center console in the heat of summer? </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Something you didn't want. Or something you had to keep.</p>
<p>(NICK'S pager beeps. He checks it.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Pow-wow.</p>
<p>(NICK gets out of the car and leaves the garage.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Later.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI -- LAB]</p>
<p>(Everyone's in the lab around the table. They're talking about the case. Their voices muted. GRISSOM sits there thinking.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (muted) Nevada state patrol found the victim's vehicle here. Found the body in good springs here.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (muffled) Warrick and I found stippling on the passenger side seat back.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (muffled) We were thinking Millander posed as a hitchhiker overpowered Walker, and then faked a gunshot in the car.</p>
<p>(The audio clears when NICK speaks.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I put a call into three area country and western stations. Got the FCC list ... during the time of the victim's suicide recording KWV had Willie Hank's &quot;Don't Pay the Ransom&quot; playing from 1:47 A.M. To 1:51 A.M.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And what time was sunrise this morning?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: 5:13 A.M. So that's about a three hour window. He was racing daylight.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So in that time he had to get the recording and get rid of the body.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Made the recording in the car killed him in the warehouse.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No, he carried him into the warehouse.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Mud prints -- one set in, one set out.</p>
<p>(SARA puts the footprint photos on the table. NICK looks at them.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Are we sure he didn't kill him in the car? He was shot in the warehouse. He was incapacitated in the car.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Okay, how?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Grissom, you want to add something to this?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah. None of it matters. It's one of those few cases where physical evidence isn't helping us much. I mean, put it in context. The victim's birthday is always on the anniversary of the murder of Millander's father. Staged like his father's death. A planted hair, a planted fingerprint ... it's all biographical. He's using the evidence to tell us a story.</p>
<p>(BRASS appears in the doorway.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hey... Peter Walker, our victim worked for cinema road services in Valencia, California. Drives the newly released film reels back and forth to Vegas. </p>
<p>(BRASS walks into the lab and joins them around the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Drops off the new reels every Tuesday for Friday's release. Brings the old one back. </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Drives the same route all the time?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, according to his mileage log.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Did Walker have any kind of record?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Pretty much a boy scout except for a speeding ticket.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Speeding ticket? How long ago?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: July 2, last year.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (nods) Summer.</p>

<p><strong>Officer Kevin Yarnell</strong>: Why is it any business of yours?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You wrote tickets to three people who ended up dead.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Kevin Yarnell</strong>: You think I had something to do with it? Look, I'm a good cop. I protect and serve. I even go to court on my days off.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You mean court dates for speeding tickets?</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You know where I'm from ... and I know who you are.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Douglas Mason (Paul Millander)</strong>: I'm not who you think I am. Local police have been out here twice this past year about this man -- Paul Millander, is it? Every time his story's in the paper. I've heard I look like him.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Identical.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Douglas Mason (Paul Millander)</strong>: You've heard of the doppelganger syndrome?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That every person is supposed to have an exact double somewhere in the world?</p>
<p><strong>Judge Douglas Mason (Paul Millander)</strong>: Do you believe in it?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Never been proved.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Douglas Mason (Paul Millander)</strong>: A swiss neurobiologist recently published papers supporting its viability. Brugger, I think his name is. Stands to reason this Millander is my doppelganger. The monkey wrench for you is that we're both here in the State of Nevada.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM stands up.)</p>
<p>(JUDGE MASON grabs a-hold of the cell bar and leans in.)</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No. The judge just got sloppy. (CATHERINE hands GRISSOM the container.) Thanks.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM opens the container and fumes the bar. Fingerprints appear.)</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, men and women both have testosterone in their systems. No big deal, right?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, this is. This testosterone's endogenous.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What? What do you mean? Like outside the body?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Injections. Supplements.</p>
<p>(SARA looks at the results.)</p>

<p><strong>Paul Millander (Judge Mason)</strong>: To which I reply, &quot;old habits die hard.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Mason</strong>: Truth is, I think he just enjoys his private time.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Millander (Judge Mason)</strong>: Dear. As a Judge, I don't want the outside world privy to my private life because they'll use it against me.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We have to disprove this Judge Mason. Birth certificate -- was he born in Mulberry?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, that's the first thing Brass looked into. Apparently, the records building burned down in 1982.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Burned down?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Ruled arson. No suspects ever found.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So Judge Mason has no birth certificate. How convenient. Man, this guy plays way out in front.</p>

[INT. CSI - PRINT LAB -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks into the lab to check with CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did I miss something?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It's a kid's fingerprint from the baseball card.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Clear ... concise ... anonymous.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Brass found no prints from little Pauline no birth records, no death certificate. I'm going to use the prints from the only other kid who lived in the Millander house.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Here come de Judge.</p>
<p>(The computer shows a comparison match.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Ridge analysis proof. Judge Mason is ... </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: ... Paul Millander.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM'S pager beeps. He checks it.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's ... it's Greg.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns around to look at the DNA lab.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to CATHERINE) Come on.</p>

[INT. CSI - DNA LAB - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and CATHERINE walk into the lab. SARA is already there with GREG.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Okay. The hair you found in Pauline Millander's bedroom two x chromosomes-- female.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You didn't beep me for that.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, Sara had me compare it to the hair found in the tub at the crime scene. They're a perfect match. (beat) DNA identical.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So her brother planted it?</p>
<p>(GREG looks at SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well ... not exactly. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah, he planted it. He planted his own hair.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Millander. It's a female hair.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: With endogenous testosterone. Pauline was taking male hormone injections.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at the test results.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: My theory? s*x change.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You know, when I was back at the house I saw several photographs of Pauline and nothing of Paul. In fact, the only proof of Paul is a hidden baseball card.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: There is no birth or death record for Pauline.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Paul killed Pauline. But he didn't murder her.</p>

<p><strong>Isabelle Millander</strong>: Pauline went away and came back a very strange man. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: PAULINE MILLANDER walking into the elevator carrying a yellow suitcase. The elevator doors open and a young PAUL MILLANDER in a wheelchair is wheeled out of the hospital carrying a yellow suitcase. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Isabelle Millander</strong>: And I wouldn't let him stay here -- not like that.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mrs. Millander, we believe that your son has murdered three people and that he's living under the assumed name of Judge Douglas Mason. I need your permission to collect some hairs from Pauline's bedroom for use in court.</p>
<p>(ISABELLE MILLANDER looks at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM questions PAUL MILLANDER. They both sit at opposite ends of the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We took this hair from your childhood bedroom when you used to be Pauline.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Millander (Judge Douglas Mason)</strong>: They told my parents I had an &quot;endocrinic ambiguity.&quot; My chromosomes said female, but my body wasn't that sure. The doctors told my parents to raise me as they saw fit. Unfortunately, they disagreed.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So, uh ... you were a girl when you were inside the house and a boy when you were out in the world?</p>
<p><strong>Paul Millander (Judge Douglas Mason)</strong>: I managed. Until ... that night.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: PAULINE looks out from a crack in her bedroom door. She sees her father thrown into the bath tub and hears a gunshot fired. She watches as two men leave. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Paul Millander (Judge Mason)</strong>: (upset) A boy ... could have saved his father.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You did what you could do. You testified against them.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: PAULINE MILLANDER up on the courtroom stand.)</p>
<p><strong>Lawyer</strong>: Do you see the man who killed your father in this courtroom?</p>
<p>(PAULINE stutters and struggles to get the answer out. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Paul Millander (Judge Mason)</strong>: (stuttering) Y ... yes.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM watches in surprise. PAUL MILLANDER sits back in his chair and looks at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Paul Millander (Judge Mason)</strong>: They went free.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And you started to identify with the aggressors. </p>
<p>(PAUL MILLANDER looks at GRISSOM and smiles proudly.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Why are you smiling?</p>
<p><strong>Paul Millander (Judge Douglas Mason)</strong>: I am ... comfortable sharing this with you. My, uh ... my mother wouldn't hear it. Against her wishes, I cut off my hair. Started wearing big shirts. Big boots. If I got tough enough ... no one would ever hurt me. I went to the clinic ... and became a man. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sexual reassignment. Not just a man, though-- a Judge. Doesn't get much more powerful than that </p>
<p>(PAUL MILLANDER sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: But none of it solved your problems, did it? Or else you wouldn't have killed three innocent men.</p>
<p>(PAUL MILLANDER doesn't respond. GRISSOM stands up and carries the warrant to PAUL MILLANDER. He puts it on the table in front of him and takes out a swab.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I have a warrant for your DNA.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Millander</strong>: Identity is so fluid, you know.</p>
<p>(Holds out his hand for the swab.)</p>
<p><strong>Paul Millander</strong>: May I?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM hands the swab to PAUL MILLANDER. PAUL MILLANDER takes the sample and caps the swab. He hands it back to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: See you in court.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM heads back to his seat to get his things.)</p>
<p><strong>Paul Millander (Judge Douglas Mason)</strong>: Aren't you wondering about your birthday? August 17, 1956.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM picks up his things and heads for the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Paul Millander (Judge Douglas Mason)</strong>: Why I didn't kill you, since you were next?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM opens the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Paul Millander (Judge Douglas Mason)</strong>: I've already picked my next victim, if you're curious.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns around and looks at PAUL MILLANDER.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It doesn't matter, Paul -- you'll be in jail.</p>

<p>(GRISSOM walks up to CATHERINE who is speaking with the prosecutor.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What is going on? I thought Millander was supposed to be arraigned at<br />
8:00.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, this is just ridiculous. I mean, you'd think they'd make an exception in this case -- three murders. This guy's telling me that Millander is representing himself. Pro pers are always last on the docket.</p>
<p>(This concerns GRISSOM. He walks out of the courtroom. CATHERINE watches GRISSOM leave.)</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You going home?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah. They know where to find me.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I re-read the backgrounds of Millander's victims. I think that he slipped up. You know how every victim read the suicide note &quot;I'd like to say 'I love you' to my mother&quot;? Well, Pete Walker had no mother. (beat) She died in childbirth.</p>

<p>(The door closes behind him. GRISSOM turns on the flashlight. He takes a couple of steps forward and turns to look in the Dining Room. ISABELLE MILLANDER is sitting at the Dining Room Table with her back facing GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mrs. Millander?</p>
<p>(She doesn't respond. GRISSOM walks up to her and sees the knife in her abdomen. The food in front of her is untouched.)</p>

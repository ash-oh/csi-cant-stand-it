<p>(The bright white guard light turns toward the camera.)</p>
<p>FLASH TO WHITE:</p>
<hr />
[INT LAS VEGAS PRISON - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Guards strap the PRISONER in orange to his chair.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: The wall clock reads: 11:58 p.m.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: The guards strap The PRISONER'S legs to the table, uncuffs his hands and straps his arms down to the table. They cut his orange prison uniform and stick a needle in his arm. His cut shirt is pushed aside and electrodes are attached to his chest to monitor his hearbeat.) </p>
<p>(The guards leave.)</p>
<p>(The camera pans from the execution cell, through the observation mirror and down to the next room where six large syringes are laid out on the table in front of the warden and other officials.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: The PRISONER is spread out on the table and strapped down so he can't move.)</p>
<p>(The clock reads: 11:59:00.)</p>
<p>(The PRISONER breathes rapidly. He looks to the side at the window where the curtain to the observation room is closed. The curtains open and behind the window are several rows of witnesses. The camera lingers on the man and woman sitting up front and center. The woman is startled at the sight in front of her and reaches for her husband's hand.)</p>
<p>(The PRISONER sees them, then turns his head away. The woman clutches in her lap, a picture of a young woman, her daughter.)</p>
<p>(The audience waits. The clock counts down with every passing second ...<br />
11:59:54 ... 11:59:55 ... )</p>
<p>(Camera cuts to focus on the man's neck where his pulse beats rapidly just beneath his skin.)</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV to the blood flowing rapidly through his veins. Through his veins, where it comes out to his heart. We watch the heart beat for a moment. End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(The man picks up the first syringe (#1) filled with a clear liquid. He uncaps the needle and injects the liquid into the IV tube.)</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV to: The liquid flows through the IV tubes, then through the man's veins where we see red blood cells ... and we see more red blood cells. End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: Camera close up of the PRISONER'S left eye where we see the pupil dilating.)</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV cut to the heart beating slower than before. End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: Camera close up of the man's face as his eyes start to close. His eye lids close.)</p>
<p>(For a moment, there is silence in the execution room. There is silence in the observation room. The solid tone of the heart monitor flatlining is heard.)</p>
<p>(A telephone rings cuts through the silence.)</p>
<p>(The medic answers it.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT LAS VEGAS PRISON - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(The door to the Execution Room bursts open and life-resuscitating machines are wheeled into the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Medic</strong>: Let's go. We have a stay of execution. We've got thirty seconds to revive him.</p>
<p>(Two medics and a physician works on reviving the condemned prisoner. The medics perform CPR while the physician injects something into the IV.)</p>
<p>FLASH TO WHITE:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM is walking down the hallway while reading a file folder. CATHERINE catches up to him and fills him in. She hands him some papers.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Grissom ... a stay. New evidence appeal: Hair analysis. I already over-nighted the six pubic hairs found on the victim to norfolk -- Department of Criminal Justice -- for mitochondrial DNA analysis. </p>
<p>FLASH TO WHITE:</p>
<p>(Close up of Mailing label to &quot;MT DNA LAB / DEPARTMENT ... &quot;. White flash to man pushing cart with SENDEX box stamped RUSH on it. White flash to man tossing the SENDEX box in the back of a truck. White flash to SENDEX box (stamped RUSH) on the mailing conveyer belt and the box being picked up by a pair of hands. Flash to white.)</p>
<p>RESUME TO PRESENT:</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and GRISSOM continue to walk through the hallway.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Defense thinks DNA's a magic pill for exoneration. I doubt if it's going to change the outcome. </p>
<p>(They turn and enter the office.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - GRISSOM'S OFFICE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks into his office and heads for his desk. He hasn't said a word back to CATHERINE. CATHERINE steps into the office.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (shakes her head) You don't know what I'm talking about.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM sits down at his desk.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: People v. John Mathers. Serial. Western LVU. I was a rookie ...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Three dead co-eds?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: All sexually assaulted, but no semen was found. Suspected he wore a condom. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Dumped in garbage bags. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Case with the strongest evidence was victim number three: Charlene Roth. Mathers, a campus security guard got Murder One for that.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: When are you going to get the test back?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I put a rush on it.</p>
<p>(Flash to white. Camera view of the SENDEX box and label. A hand with a stamp stamps &quot;RUSH&quot; on it in red. Flash to white. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Is this your first one?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: First to exhaust all of his appeals and get an execution date. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE sits down in the seat across GRISSOM'S desk.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: How many have you had?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Two. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM goes back to the papers he's looking at and flips a page over.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So, how do you feel about it?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mathers was convicted and sent to death row by a jury of his peers. I played a small part. I presented my findings ... </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Non-responsive.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM interrupts CATHERINE. CATHERINE looks at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay. I haven't figured out how I feel yet. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's just about evidence. It's not up to you whether he lives or dies. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM flips the papers back over.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Case has no face.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS.</p>

[EXT. RESTON'S RESIDENCE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Camera close up of a man in a blood-stained shirt sitting on the side walk. He looks completely out of it. Police sirens are heard in the background.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Cops did a welfare check on this residence. A girl, 17, didn't show up for work and they found dad passed out on the sofa in a blood-soaked t-shirt.</p>
<p>(BRASS, GRISSOM and SARA approach the man.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did he have anything to say about his daughter?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Mr. Reston, uh, can't remember what day it is. Claims he was in a bar fight.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: &quot;Pass&quot; test?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: His blood alcohol level is .37.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Ooh ... alcoholic.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks away to leave it to SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Lucky me.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(SARA kneels down in front of the man and puts her case down. BRASS also kneels down and speaks to the man.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (loudly) Hey, buddy! This is Sara Sidle of the Las Vegas Crime Lab. She's going to ask you some questions.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Sir, I need your shirt and I need to see your hands.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Shirt and hands!</p>

[INT. RESTON'S RESIDENCE -- NIGHT]</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p>(NICK looks around at the messy place. GRISSOM moves to stand next to NICK.)</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Don't insult the pigs, Nick. They're actually very clean.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. RESTON'S RESIDENCE - DEBBIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(The door opens. GRISSOM and NICK walk into the daughter's bedroom. He turns on the light. The differences are immediately.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And this would be the girl's room.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Doesn't seem like the same house.</p>
<p>(There are two dead bolt locks on the bedroom door.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Dead bolts on her bedroom door.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Trying to keep something out.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p>(NICK snaps a picture of the locks. GRISSOM turns to look at the bedroom.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: A bedroom refrigerator?</p>
<p>(He opens it to check out its contents.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: There's milk, fruit ... a toaster?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Guess they weren't much on family dinners.</p>
<p>(NICK snaps more pictures. GRISSOM checks out the closet.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Nick?</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (takes the towel) I'll bag it.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - LAB]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE has photographs spread out all over the table. She holds a stack of photographs in her hands and looks through it.)</p>

<p>(Quick flashback to: A MAN tying the ends of the garbage bag together. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(WARRICK walks into the lab.)</p>
<p><strong>Brown</strong>: I heard Mathers had that I.V. In his arm and everything, when that call came in. Never had a death penalty case get that far. Just working it all out?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah. Old case, new eyes, new technology. </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: This evidence was processed, what, fifteen years ago?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: That was before DNA. Now that the case has been reopened I can re-evaluate all three murders. We always thought Mathers was good for the other two, but if they overturn Charlene Roth with the new DNA, we can go back and try Mathers with the other two murders with the new evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Keep Mathers in prison. </p>
<p>(WARRICK looks at the file. CATHERINE watches WARRICK for a moment ... wondering ... )</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You pro or con?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Pro, if he did it. The applications sucks, though. There's a lot of brown skin on that row.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What about you?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I try not to give it much thought. I stick to the work.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Campus police found the victim Charlene Roth in this trash bag.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: The trash bag, yeah. I was looking at that. Processed with superglue, rhodamine, laser. No prints found though.</p>
<p>(WARRICK opens the file again and looks at the report and photo of CHARLENE ROTH found dead in the trash bag.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Who's working the print lab tonight?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Franco. Just off of days.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks out of the lab carrying an evidence bag.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - STAIRWAY/HALLWAY - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks down the stairs to the print lab. She's carrying an evidence bag. GREG catches up to her. He walks with her.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Hey, I hear you're cheating on me with an out-of-state DNA analyst.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Apples and oranges, Greg. Fifteen-year-old hair samples no roots, room-temperature storage.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Room temp?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, that's how we stored hair evidence back then. Microscopy was king.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Really? I thought Elvis was king.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And you are how old?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Age is irrelevant in our relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Maybe so, but face it, Greg you just don't have the equipment.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: The government results won't give you an individual profile and you can't put them through CODIS.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, maternal lineage is good enough on this one. No one else on Mathers' mother's side is a suspect. So, if it's a match, the stay is lifted he's back in the chamber. If not, we're back in court.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks away from GREG.)</p>

<p>(CATHERINE walks into the lab. JACQUI FRANCO lifts her head and looks at CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Jacqui ... I'm so glad you're back on nights. Got a good one for you.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE puts the evidence package on the table. JACQUI turns it and reads the label.)</p>
<p><strong>Jacqui Franco</strong>: Trash bag? Yeah, love it. </p>
<p>(She shakes her head and goes back to work.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Give it some vacuum metal deposition. </p>
<p><strong>Jacqui Franco</strong>: Hottest thing going for plastic. If there's anything to be found, my machine'll find it.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And, um, super-rush. You're in a race with the federal lab.</p>
<p><strong>Jacqui Franco</strong>: Make my night; love to compete with the Feds. You and me need to catch up. How's Lindsey?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Second grade, tons of homework.</p>
<p><strong>Jacqui Franco</strong>: Lucky for her she got your smarts, not Eddie's.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hmmph. Now I know why I missed you so much. So, page me as soon as you're done.</p>
<p><strong>Jacqui Franco</strong>: Mm-hmm. Putting you up first. You owe me a beer.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks out of the lab.)</p>

<p>(GRISSOM and NICK examine the backyard. They pass a bar-b-que and a shovel leaning against a log.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Looks like somebody's been doing some digging.<br />
(In the back of the yard there is a tool shed. They head for the tool shed.)</p>
<p>[INT. RESTON'S RESIDENCE - TOOL SHED - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and NICK look around inside. NICK finds a gun on the shelf. He picks it up and looks at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Glock. Laser sight. Slide's missing. Mr. Reston was a bit of a garage tinkerer.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Great. Drunks with guns.</p>
<p>(SARA enters the tool shed. She lingers by the door. GRISSOM picks up a gun case and opens it.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: M11-9. Empty box.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: He didn't have any kind of weapon on him.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay, we're into it.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'm going to take Reston's shirt back to Greg.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mm-hm. Do me a favor?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Inside, bloody towel, bagged and tagged.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You got it.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Woo. After this place, I need a shower.</p>

[INT. COFFEE SHOP -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE is inside the shop ordering a latte.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (placing her order) I would like a vanilla ice soy blended latte, please.</p>
<p>(A WOMAN approaches CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Sally Roth</strong>: Ms. Willows.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yes?</p>
<p><strong>Sally Roth</strong>: Sally Roth. My husband Tom heard from a friend that you came here.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm sorry. Do I know you?</p>
<p><strong>Sally Roth</strong>: We're Charlene Roth's parents.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (sighs) Mr. and Mrs. Roth. I'm sorry. I didn't recognize you.</p>

<p><strong>Man</strong>: I don't know what I can tell you. I've only been here since '95.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, is there anyone in the art department who was here when the first murders took place?</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: A couple of the guys predate me. I'll ask around.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM examines the can of brushes.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Are any of these brushes made with badger hair?</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: We artists covet our brushes. (The MAN puts his brush down and picks up his glasses. He puts them on.) That's Russian Blue Squirrel ... Japanese Synthetic ... Badger.</p>
<p>(He takes his glasses off and resumes painting.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: In the oil paint sample we collected we found both badger hair and nylon bristles.</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: Anyone who's studied art would never use nylon with oils unless they were using the paint for something else. When brushes age ...</p>
<p>(Camera close up of a blue paint can. A brush is dipped into the paint and when removed, leaves behind brush hairs.)</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: (V.O.) ... they shed hairs. Then, if they used a nylon brush the next time ...</p>
<p>(A second brush is dipped into the same paint. End of close up. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Say I wanted a badger hair paintbrush -- where would I buy one?</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: Student union sells them. Most art stores. You can get them cheaper on the internet.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM examines the MAN'S glass lens. The MAN stops and looks at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sorry. I was admiring your frames. Nice.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM puts the glasses back down on the table.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - DNA LAB/HALLWAY]</p>
<p>(GREG walks out into the hallway to catch GRISSOM and CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: The results are back on the zip tie you removed from Debbie Reston's wrists. No foreign epithelials, but I did find an errant hair DNA tag still attached. It's not Debbie Reston's. </p>
<p>(GREG gives the results to CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Catherine asked me to cross-check everything with the old cases. It actually belongs to Janet Kent.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Janet Kent-- the first victim?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So Janet Kent's killer saved some of her hair and planted it on Debbie Reston fifteen years later on the night that John Mathers was set to be executed.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: John Mathers is the copycat.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah. And the original killer's still out there playing a really twisted game.</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - LAB]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM is in the lab testing the paint samples.)</p>
<p>(He puts a bit on the card marked &quot;Paint Sample #3&quot;. He places the card in the machine, closes it and starts it.)</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV of the light beam reading the sample. End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM waits for the results. On the monitor the results for &quot;Charlene Roth&quot; appear.)</p>
<p>(The monitor clears then shows a paint comparison of the four paint samples for the four victims: DEBBIE RESTON, CHARLENE ROTH, JANET KENT and MARCIA REESE. The test comparison shows that the only different sample is the sample from CHARLENE ROTH.)</p>
<p>(Camera holds on GRISSOM.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI -- LOCKER ROOM]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE opens her locker and removes her bag. She closes the locker and heads out.)</p>
<p>[HALLWAY]</p>
<p>(She sees GRISSOM in the hallway. She walks down the hallway, GRISSOM follows her.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh. Hey. Mathers' execution's back on. The Roths asked me to sit with them.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Is that a good idea?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I just need to do it.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It's like your first autopsy ... your first murdered child. You can make it through that you can keep doing this work.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM shows CATHERINE the results of the paint sample comparison.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: All the paints match all the victims except for Charlene Roth. See, being capable of matching paint samples that are fifteen years apart that's why I keep doing this work.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (smiles) Well, that's the difference between you and me.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE leaves. She passes SARA on her way out walking in toward GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (to CATHERINE) Hey. (to GRISSOM) Dean of the art school came up with a name. A Cody Lewis. He was a grad student at WLVU in the late '80s same time the three girls were murdered. He left just after the Roth case for a post-doc in Louisiana.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Where is he now?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: WLVU since September. He's an assistant professor there.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT -- INTERROGATION ROOM]</p>
<p>(BRASS looks at a photo of CODY LEWIS' painting. It's of a woman with her hands tied.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So you like to paint dead girls?</p>
<p><strong>Cody Lewis</strong>: I paint what I feel.</p>
<p>(BRASS turns around and looks at CODY LEWIS.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, sure. You know, you're an artist. So back in '87 when you painted this girl what were you feeling? That you wanted her to die? (pause)<br />
What's the subject matter this week? More dead girls?</p>
<p><strong>Cody Lewis</strong>: I haven't been doing a lot of painting lately.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Uh-huh. So it's just a coincidence that another coed gets murdered right after you show up in Vegas, right?</p>
<p><strong>Cody Lewis</strong>: Listen, I painted that fifteen years ago. Right after that second girl was murdered ... Marjorie something. Really affected me. Affected everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, but it affected you more. Because you knew the first victim. Right? Janet Kent.</p>
<p><strong>Cody Lewis</strong>: Yeah, I knew Janet.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Come on, Cody, man. You two had a thing. </p>
<p><strong>Cody Lewis</strong>: We had a date. I took her to a Springsteen show. We had drinks afterwards and that was it.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So what, did she reject you? Did she give you the, uh ... &quot;Cody, we can still be friends&quot;? That speech?</p>
<p><strong>Cody Lewis</strong>: No. Never got that far.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I was just wondering, because some guys can't take &quot;no&quot; for an answer. But that's not you, right?</p>
<p>(Camera holds on CODY LEWIS.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI -- GARAGE]</p>
<p>(NICK, SARA and WARRICK checks out CODY LEWIS' car.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay, I'm getting this to trace. Hey, check out the vehicle's upholstery. It's black and it's a Chevy ... </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We got nothing. Nobody cleans a car this good. There is no evidence that Debbie Reston was transported in this vehicle.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Still doesn't rule out Cody Lewis as a suspect.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - PRINT LAB -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(JACQUI checks out the print. NICK waits for the results.)</p>
<p><strong>Jacqui Franco</strong>: You got to wonder when a guy gives it up this easily. Prints, DNA, his car ... </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, well ... maybe he's thinks he's some kind of smart guy you know, covering all the bases.</p>
<p><strong>Jacqui Franco</strong>: Or maybe he didn't do it.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What's that?</p>
<p><strong>Jacqui Franco</strong>: His prints don't match the partial on the Debbie Reston trash bag.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Wonderful.</p>
<p>(JACQUI nods her head.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>(NICK turns to leave.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. PRISON - NIGHT]</p>
<hr />
[INT. EXECUTION OBSERVATION ROOM]</p>
<p>(The GUARD near the door puts a small packet of ammonia in CATHERINE'S palm.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Guard</strong>: Ammonia ... in case anyone starts to feel ... unsteady.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE takes a seat next to SALLY ROTH in the front row. CATHERINE looks around a bit, then turns to face the front. The curtains to the window are closed.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: In the next room, the GUARDS tie JOHN MATHERS' arms down to the table. They secure his ankles to the table. They strap on the belt at his waist. They remove his handcuffs to secure his right hand. They inject the needle into his arm and secure the heart monitor electrodes to his chest. Camera close up of his eyes as he's being prepared.)</p>
<p>(The curtains to the observation room window open. JOHN MATHERS turns his head and sees CATHERINE up front and center.)</p>
<p>(The last guard leaves the room.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
SCENE #46</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - BRASS' OFFICE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(On his laptop, BRASS scrolls through the photographs of the murder cases.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I keep racking my brain going over these unsolved murder cases and I keep coming back to the fact that they're fifteen years apart. That means he's either out of town or in the joint.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Why wouldn't he take his business to some other college if it was only about young girls?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: It's got to be personal. He wanted to kill those girls.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
SCENE #47</p>
<p>[INT. EXECUTION OBSERVATION ROOM]</p>
<p>(The first syringe is injected into the I.V. tube.)</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV through the tube and fast forward with the liquid to the red blood cells. End of CGI POV.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: A close up of JOHN MATHERS' left eye with pupil dilating.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: CGI POV of the heart beating very slowly. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: JOHN MATHERS on the table struggling to breathe and CATHERINE watching in the background.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: TOM ROTH looks at SALLY ROTH. SALLY ROTH watches JOHN MATHERS, a picture of her daughter CHARLENE is clutched in her hands.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to CHARLENE ROTH struggling against her attacker. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(Cut back to: TOM ROTH.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: JOHN MATHERS on the table.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: Close up of JOHN MATHERS chest and his breathing. Camera hold on his ear. Camera cut to his dilated eye.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: CATHERINE watches through the window. SALLY ROTH reaches over and holds CATHERINE'S hand. She looks at CATHERINE.)</p>
<p>(JOHN MATHERS' eyes flutter closed. The heart monitor flatlines.)</p>
<p>(Camera holds on CATHERINE.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - BRASS' OFFICE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I mean, I don't know much about bugs, but most animals hunt in their own backyard.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: True of insects as well. You know why?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: It's where they feel most comfortable.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And where they can blend in the best.</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: Students walk across the campus. Special note of the men wearing glasses. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This guy had ties to Western LVU. He paints a railing on a campus walkway. I tried it; took me about five minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: My guys were all over that school. Nobody remembers seeing anything.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Probably because there wasn't much to see. </p>
<p>(Quick flash to: Students walk across the campus. Nothing special there.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) He must've looked as though he belonged. </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Like the insects, he blended in.</p>
<p>(BRASS sighs heavily.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah. </p>
<p>(BRASS opens his desk drawer and pulls out a bottle.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You off the clock?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I guess.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. PRISON -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks back to her car. On the other side of the wire fence are protesters with signs. The guard opens the wire gate, she walks through it and into the crowd.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - BRASS' OFFICE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: He's going to kill again.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah. And all we've got is a partial fingerprint and an M.O. that may lead us in the right direction.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know sometimes in this job I'd rather be lucky than good. Maybe next time we'll get lucky.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I don't believe in luck. My only real purpose is to be smarter than the bad guys to find the evidence that they didn't know they left behind and make sense of it all. Makes me very uncomfortable to realize that this guy may be smarter than me.</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>

THE DOOR SLAMS SHUT:

 
Brass: A truck driver making a delivery found him.
Catherine: TOD?
David Phillips: About two or three hours ago.
 
Grissom: Neck contusion.
 
Catherine: Looks like he went down fighting.
Grissom: Any ID?
David Phillips: Just this. 
 
Grissom: Palermo room key.
Catherine: Nice clothes.
Brass: Well, they do make the man.
 
Grissom: He's got some kind of transfer on his pants.
 
Catherine: Yeah, and on his shirt. So what's a guy dressed for a party with a key to this hotel doing out here?
Grissom: I don't know. But the party's over.




 
 
Catherine: Got smudges that look like white paint up here. Similar to the trace on the vic's clothes.
 
Grissom: Same down here. So whatever it is, it must have been wet.
 
 
Catherine: I don't see any wet paint signs up here either.
 

 
 
 


 
Overhead: Two performances nightly of Palermo's fabulous show, &quot;The Girls of India.&quot; Now on display at Palermo Jewelers -- diamonds at Romanoff's.

 
(The manager swipes the card key in the machine. The monitor shows the room:
2147.) 

 
 
Manager: The room is registered to a Jeffrey Powell of Van Nuys, California.
Catherine: He check in with anybody?
Manager: No. The reservation was for one person. He checked in yesterday, paid with a corporate credit card. 
Nick: Do you remember the name of the company?
 
Manager: Sheritown Inc.
 
Nick: Sheritown Inc. We're going to need access to all of the surveillance footage from tonight, all right?
Manager: You got it.
Nick: Okay.
 

 
Nick: Two glasses. Think our vic got lucky?
 
Catherine: Oh, yeah.
 
Catherine: He got lucky, all right. He got lucky with a blonde.
 
Nick: Jeans ... full of holes. Must've been wearing them a long time. 
Catherine: Either that or he just bought them and paid a fortune.
 
Nick: I remember my first time to Vegas. I got one of these - &quot;Guide to Blackjack&quot;. Everybody dreams of hitting it big out here, don't they? 
 
Catherine: Yeah, well, if that ever ends you can kiss Vegas good-bye.
 
Nick: We have a winner.
 
Catherine: Jackpot.
 
Catherine: Ooh, Sasan. Cost him more than all of his other clothes put together.
 
Catherine: There's some kind of blue powder trace on the pocket. Nicky, take this.

Nick: California driver's license.
(The information on the CALIFORNIA DRIVER'S LICENSE reads:
JEFFREY POWELL
623 VAN NESS AVE.
LOS ANGELES, CA 90028
s*x: M HAIR: BLK EYES BRN
HT: 5-8 WT: 155
Nick: Company credit card.
 
Nick: Amateur Speedway Association card.

Nick: Guy liked fast cars.
 
Catherine: Except he was driving a Toyota.
Nick: No cash. This sounds like a classic trick roll.
 
Nick:  Kid from of town on a lucky streak-- 
Jeffrey Powell: I cannot lose tonight!
 
Nick:  He's an easy mark.


 
Nick:  Get him up to the room ...
 
Nick:  loosen him up ...
 
Nick: ... jump him and dump him.

 
 
David Phillips: Mom was right -- always wear clean ones. Because you never know what could happen. What do you think that is?
Warrick: Why don't you take a whiff?
David Phillips: Why am I always the guy who has to sniff the shorts?
Warrick: 'Cause it's your job.
 
David Phillips: You do it.
 
Warrick: Red wine.
 
Warrick: It's not on his pants. What about the shirt?
David Phillips: No.
Warrick: So he must have changed after the mess.
 
David Phillips: Oh, I already went through his pockets.
 
David Phillips: Of course, I was double-gloved.
Warrick: Clothes are brand new.
 
David Phillips: Hmm ...
Warrick: Looks like a callus.
 

 
 
Nick:  There's a long-haired blonde.
(Camera cuts wide and we find we're in the ...

 
Archie Johnson: Yeah, I've been watching this for a while now.
Nick: Time stamped 10:52 P.M. He entered his room a couple of minutes later. Manager said the last time he used his card key was 10:54 P.M.
Archie Johnson: We look forward about an hour ... 

Archie Johnson: Jeff leaves his room alone.
 
Nick: He doesn't have a jacket on. He's probably not going too far.
Archie Johnson: So he gets off the elevator, goes into the casino, and nine minutes later, ... 
 
Archie Johnson: ... same blonde goes down in the elevator.
Nick: Mm-hmm.

Nick: Grab that.
 
Nick: Print that.
 
Archie Johnson: After the vic gets off the elevator, I lose him in the casino crowd for about fifteen minutes.
Nick: How do you lose him? Aren't there a hundred cameras in there?
Archie Johnson: And at four hours of video each, that's four hundred hours of video I got to go through.  The vic was found at the loading dock off the shopping arcade.
 
Archie Johnson: And here, he's heading for the arcade here. That's the last time I've got him on camera. There's no surveillance in the arcade hall. Only in the individual stores.
 
Nick: Freeze that.
 
Nick: Enhance that bag.
 
Nick: The vic was wearing a Sasan jacket. 
Archie Johnson: Hah. Check this out. Bingo.
(Archie checks the store map and finds it:
B-102C
2,798 SF
SASAN BOUTIQUE
Nick: I'm going shopping.


 
 
Nick: But you were working last night.
Erica: Yeah, we've been short-handed.
Nick: Do you, uh, do you recognize either one of these people?
 
Erica: No. Sorry.
 
Nick: How about this? Recognize that?
Erica: Sure. That's from the new spring line. The leather's like skin. It's incredible. Show me that picture again.
 
Erica: Now I remember. He bought a whole outfit. Even wanted underwear. We don't sell underwear.
Nick: Credit card receipt, anything like that?
Erica:  He paid cash. He was flashing a wad. 
Nick: Mm-hmm. Buy anything for her?
Erica: Nothing. She didn't need anything. Looked perfect. Was making my job real easy. 

 
Erica: That guy would have bought anything she wanted him to, Mr. Stokes.
 
Nick: Thank you.
 

 
 

 
 
Robbins: I found extensive contusion involving the anterior aspect of the neck with hemorrhage in all the strap muscles. The thyroid, cricoid and arytenoids cartilages are all multiply fractured.

RESUME VIEW
 
Robbins: The hyoid bone is fractured as well.
Catherine: The blunt-force trauma to the neck?
Robbins: Yeah. COD is asphyxiation due to obstruction of the airway. Took a few minutes to die.
Catherine: Any idea of the source of the BFT?
Robbins: Well, I enhanced the contusion on the neck using UV photography.
 
Robbins: Looks like there's a defined edge on the weapon.
Catherine: Yeah, that could be anything. How about prelim tox results?
Robbins: Well, tox detected methamphetamine, sildenafil and oxycodone.
Catherine: Stimulant, erection and a painkiller. Party in a pill.
Robbins: Where was that on my wedding night?


 
 
Greg: This couple look familiar?
Lenny Andretti: Sweet red Ferrari. F-360 Spyder.
Greg: When did you see them?
Lenny Andretti: Last night-- I brought the car when they left. Around 8:15. They're gone a couple hours. The car - pfft -- was amazing.
Sara: Did they happen to tell you where they were going?
Lenny Andretti: No.
Sara: Do you know what time they got back to the hotel?
Lenny Andretti: Uh, a little after ten. The guy gave me a Benjamin. I kept an eye out on that baby, I didn't want any of these other maniacs putting their paws on it.
Sara: What about the girl? You ever seen her before?
Lenny Andretti: I don't think so.
Sara: She strike you as a working girl?
Lenny Andretti: I'll say this, if she was hooking, then she was top shelf, just like that car. I felt kind of like that garage guy in &quot;Ferris Bueller's Day Off&quot;? You know, he likes the car so much, he takes it out for a spin for, like, the whole day. Not that I'd ever do that.
Sara: Of course not.
Lenny Andretti: Whoa, look, I had nothing to do with the damage on that car.

 
Lenny Andretti: I mean, it was pristine before they took it out.
Greg: They were in an accident? How bad?
Lenny Andretti: Look, any scratch on that beauty is a tragedy and this was, like, a dent. You know what? They looked like they didn't even care. Anything else I can do for you?
Sara: Um, thanks.
Lenny Andretti: Lenny. Lenny Andretti. No relation.

 
 
Hodges: The trace for your vic's jacket pocket was primarily talc.
Catherine: Blue baby powder?
Hodges: No. Take a look.

Catherine: Birefringent crystals. Pretty. What are they?
Hodges: It's a mixture of silica and axolite, two abrasives. But when found with talc, it suggests only one use.
Catherine: And that would be?
Hodges: In 1897, William Spinks received a patent for what came to be known as
&quot;Spinks Billiard Chalk.&quot;
INSERT: MONTAGE
 
Hodges:  You may be surprised to know that cue-tip chalk does not contain chalk at all; it is a mixture of axolite and silica.

RESUME VIEW: 
Hodges: The abrasives give grip to the tip when it hits the ball.
Catherine: Stop trying to make that sound dirty. Our vic had a callus on his hand.
Hodges: Mmm ...
Catherine: Don't. Which means that he was probably playing a lot of pool.
Hodges: Where do you go in this town to shoot stick with a hot blonde and a Ferrari?


 
 
Brass: There's at least a half a dozen of these high-end pool halls in Vegas. The word on the street is a lot of out-of-town money comes through here.
Catherine: Well, it's closer to Palermo; it's a good place to start.
 
Brass: Hey, buddy, how's it going? Have these two been in lately?
 
Jake: No. It's pretty dark in here, wouldn't recognize my own mom if she came in.
Brass: It wasn't so dark you couldn't count your vig from that game over there. 
Jake: It's not illegal to bet on a pool game in Nevada.
Catherine: -- but it is illegal for the house to take a cut a gaming license. I don't see one on the wall. 
Jake: That's because nothing like that's going on here.
Brass: So, if we asked everyone in here, no one would say that you're taking a piece of the action?
Jake: Let me take another look.
Brass: Sure. Knock yourself out.
Jake: I never see the guy. Girl's kind of a regular here. Name's Heidi.
Brass: So, I guess your eyes do get used to the dark.
Catherine: You know where we can find this Heidi?
Jake: Oh, man ...
Brass:  You know, I don't see that license anywhere. Look, here's what we're going to do. Get on the phone. Call Heidi. Tell her a distinguished gentleman has just come in with a large wad of cash looking for some action. That'd be me.


 
Brass: Heidi Wolff? How you doing? I'm Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police. Can I talk to you for a minute?
Heidi Wolff: About what?
Brass: Do you know this guy?
 
Heidi Wolff: No. Apparently, you think I do. 
Brass: Oh, I know you do. You want to tell me how he turned up dead?
 




 
 
Brass: So you spent the night with Jeff Powell.
Heidi Wolff: And he was alive when he left me. 
Brass: Oh. He left you?
Heidi Wolff: Yeah. Believe it or not. Look. He was getting kind of weird on me.
INSERT FLASHBACK

 
Heidi Wolff: Hey. Where you going?
Jeffrey Powell: Don't worry, I'll be right back. You know, I think I may just have to fall in love with you.
 

BACK TO SCENE: 
Heidi Wolff: So I put on my clothes and I got out of there. I was looking for fun, not a lifetime commitment.
 
Brass: Is that what you call fun? Rolling a guy, taking his money?
Heidi Wolff: I didn't take his money.
Brass: Heidi, Heidi, ho. Look, we know Jeff was waving around a large wedge of cash. And the money was gone when we found him. You're an expensive date, Heidi.
Heidi Wolff: I'm a professional gambler. Probably the only one in Vegas who declares every dollar. You can check my tax returns.
Brass: We checked the hotel sheets.
Heidi Wolff: We had s*x. Is that against the law? No.
Brass: No.
Heidi Wolff: We won some money shooting pool. Is that against the law? No.
Brass: You gave him drugs. Is that against the law? Yeah. Look, here's the way I see it breaking down. You left the room nine minutes after he did. You went downstairs. You checked with your partner. You killed the kid, you took the cash, end of story.
Heidi Wolff: Let's get this straight. He was a sweet kid and I'm sorry he's dead, but I had nothing to do with it. And I'm done talking.

 
 
Greg: According to the DMV, of the 12 Ferrari F-360 Spyders registered in Vegas, only three are red. Two of them are privately owned, and a rental company has the third. And since the vic owns a Toyota in LA and Heidi Wolff drives a beetle ... 
 
Sofia Curtis: ... you figured this would be a good place to start.
Robert Rhoda: Welcome to Extravagant Auto. Robert Rhoda.  If what you're dreaming about's on four wheels, I can get it for you.
Sofia Curtis: Actually, we're looking for a red Ferrari Spyder. 
Robert Rhoda: The lady likes fast cars. And I just happen to have one. But it got into a little fender-bender, so it's going to take a day or so to get it fixed.
 
Sofia Curtis: We'll take it as is.

 
 
 
 
Greg: Looks like paint transfer on the left rear quarter. Clear coat's been peeled front-to-back.
Sofia Curtis: Which means the Ferrari was the faster vehicle.
Robert Rhoda: The Ferrari is always e faster vehicle.
 
Sofia Curtis: Ooh. Nice dent to the front bumper.
 
Robert Rhoda: You're looking at $15,000 of damage there.
Sofia Curtis: Who rented it?
Robert Rhoda: Can't help you with that. Our customer records are confidential. In any case, we're not making a police report about the damage.
Sofia Curtis: No need. We're impounding it.
Robert Rhoda: What?
 
Greg: Looks like the interior's been cleaned. I'll call auto transport and have them tow it back to the lot.

Sofia Curtis: Mr. Rhoda, what are you doing?
Robert Rhoda: I'm documenting my loss. I'm filing for crime victim compensation.
 

 
INSERT: MONTAGE 
 

 
ECU: A RED PAINT SAMPLE
 

 
 
Greg: Grissom? Hodges confirmed the paint transfer on the Ferrari is a black acrylic enamel.
Grissom: That doesn't narrow it down much.
Greg: Well, it gets better. It's a GM paint, with traces of fiberglass-reinforced plastic. Which means, we're looking for a black Corvette.
Grissom: I'll have Brass put out a broadcast. Nick ran the vic's credit card.
&quot;Sheritown, Inc.&quot; is based in L.A., run by a guy named Mick Sheridan. I'm going to meet him at the PD.
Greg: Mick Sheridan the movie producer? I grew up watching his action blockbusters -car chases, ninjas, cyborg death machines. We used to make body armor out of tinfoil, and re-enact the scene all over the neighborhood. What about you? You were a green beret kid? Secret agent?
Grissom: I'm not telling. And stay away from my tinfoil.
 


 
 
Mick Sheridan: I'm sick about this. Of all kids. Jeff. I can't stop crying.
Brass: You want something to drink?
Mick Sheridan: Oh, thanks, uh ...  Small Pellegrino, room temperature.
 
Grissom: Mr. Sheridan, can you tell us anything about this girl?
 
Mick Sheridan: I don't know her. Jeff must have met her here. I loved him like a son. Smart. Hard-working. I hired him right out of law school.
Grissom: What kind of work did he do for you?
Mick Sheridan: An assistant. He wanted to learn from the bottom up, like I did.
Brass: Oh, right, he used to be an actor.
Mick Sheridan: Yeah. But I had a nasty habit -- I wanted to eat regularly. And didn't want to work as a waiter to do it.
Grissom: Did Jeff have any nasty habits?
 
Grissom: We found several different drugs in his bloodstream.
Brass: What was Jeff doing Las Vegas?
Mick Sheridan: Um ... about a month ago, when he was making copies of my divorce settlement, he spotted a provision that my wife's lawyer had rephrased. My lawyers had missed it. He saved me millions of dollars. So to thank him, I gave him a vacation.
Brass: You give him any cash?
Mick Sheridan: Couple hundred bucks, corporate credit card. Told him to have fun.
Grissom: Fun, huh?
Mick Sheridan:  Yeah. I'll be regretting that for the rest of my life.

Sara: I guess the broadcast paid off. Black Corvette.
Greg: Parking enforcement found it abandoned off Durango near Russell.
Sara: Right between the pool hall and the Palermo?
 
Greg: Yup.
 
Sara: This would have been impossible to drive away.
 
Greg: Yeah. Bummer.
Sara: Please tell me there's something more to this guys and cars thing beside the obvious penis-extension metaphors.
Greg: So you want me to lie?
 
 
Greg: Red paint transfer.
 


 
 
 
Greg: I'll get a sample to Hodges. See if he can match this to the Ferrari.
 
Sara: It's a rental.
Greg: Extravagant Automobiles?
Sara: No. Zenith?
Greg: Yeah, night to be in the car-rental business. 
Sara: Driver's name is Randy Bolen. Local address. Let's go talk to him.


 
 
Sofia Curtis: &quot;Randy Bolen. Misdemeanor possession, assault, felony possession for sales ... &quot; you can't help but break the law, can you? What's with the forehead?
 
Sofia Curtis: Well, you got that bruise somehow. Want me to add leaving the scene of an accident to the list?
Randy Bolen: It was a fender bender. Not my fault.
Sofia Curtis: Sure about that?
Randy Bolen: Yeah.
Sofia Curtis: Because your car and the Ferrari were both rented.
Randy Bolen:  So what? It's a coincidence.
Sofia Curtis: You're a local. Why did you need to rent a car?
Randy Bolen: I can't afford one all the time, so I rent one when I can.
Sofia Curtis: What were you doing all night before your fender bender? 
Randy Bolen: What was I doing? I was shooting pool. Place called the ... the Cue-T.
Sofia Curtis: How'd you play? Did you win any money?
Randy Bolen: You know, you win some, you lose some.

SERIES OF CUTS OF THE POOL GAME
 
 
 
Sofia Curtis: I guess that would be lose some. How much?
Randy Bolen: Ten grand.
Sofia Curtis: That's a lot of money for a guy like you.

 
 
Randy Bolen: I've had worse nights.
Sofia Curtis:  Yeah, I'm sure you have. You're having one now.
 
Sofia Curtis: These the guys you played?
 
Randy Bolen: Yeah.
Sofia Curtis: Now, there's a coincidence, because they were in the Ferrari, which makes you a very sore loser.

 
 
Randy Bolen: Okay. So I rubbed him a little. It was a stupid thing to do. 
Sofia Curtis: Not as stupid as killing him.
Randy Bolen: What, that kid-- he's dead?
Sofia Curtis: Yeah.
 
Randy Bolen: I want a lawyer.

 
 
Sofia Curtis: According to his record, Randy Bolen used to be a professional stunt driver.
Nick: Must not have been a very good one.
Sofia Curtis: He teaches at that track off Boulder Highway where middle-aged guys get to act out their Grand Prix fantasies.
Nick: Mm-hmm, okay. A guy like that gets beat by a punk kid on the street it's gonna be an assault on his manhood.
Sofia Curtis: He's got a temper.
Nick: Okay. I'll see if I can place him at the hotel. I'll let you know.
 
 
 
Nick: Hey, Arch.
Archie Johnson: Hey.
Nick: Surveillance footage from the Palermo?
Archie Johnson: Yeah. I just found something really interesting.

Archie Johnson: Now, that's the blonde from the elevator.
 
Archie Johnson: There she is again. And here's Jeff Powell.

Archie Johnson: This is where his evening begins, when he meets her for the first time.
 
Nick: Ooh. She didn't look too happy.
Archie Johnson: Yeah.
 
Archie Johnson: Keep watching when she points at something. Keep your eyes on her wine.

 
Nick: You think that was on purpose?
Archie Johnson: Well, sure looks that way. Take a look at this.
 
Archie Johnson: Girl was loaded.
Nick: It's safe to say she wasn't after him for his money.

 
 
Sara: Hey.
 
Catherine: Hey.
Sara: Warrants came through on the rental agreements.
Catherine: Jeff Powell went a little crazy with his corporate card and rented the Ferrari himself?
Sara: No. Heidi Wolff rented it. The reservation was held in her name by a company called Caprice Unlimited. This is where it gets interesting. Caprice Unlimited also rented Randy Bolen's Corvette.
Catherine: What kind of business is it?
Sara: All I know so far is that they're unlisted.
Catherine: Well, nothing's entirely unlisted these days.
 
Catherine: Caprice Unlimited.
 
Sara: Mm-hmm.

Catherine: Uh, something other than, &quot;a guy is dead, and it looks like you're involved.&quot;

Anthony Caprice: Anthony Caprice. There's no crime here. 
That was a job interview. Over $150,000 has been spent on this event. It's for several golf club salesmen. They're from Kansas City. Japanese formality will mesh very nicely with their inherent Midwestern restraint.

Anthony Caprice: These scenarios take weeks to craft. I learn everything ...

Anthony Caprice: Secret longings -- they have a ... a kind of electricity. They're often much more visible than we would want them to be.
Grissom:  And, uh, Jeff Powell's evening -- the girl, the car, the billiards -- all paid for by Mick Sheridan?

Anthony Caprice: Everybody likes to be in control. You don't have to be rich to want that.

Sara: If you're so law-abiding, why did Heidi Wolff and Randy Bolen lie to the police about what happened? Did you tell them to do that?
Anthony Caprice: All my employees have a very strict non-disclosure agreement that they have to sign, although, I'd never expect them to lie to the police. Maybe you just asked them the wrong questions. 
 
Anthony Caprice: Here's a copy of Mr. Powell's scenario. Every event that they talked about was meticulously planned in advance and timed down to the minute.
Grissom: And his murder?
Anthony Caprice: Tragic.

Mick Sheridan: Well, I hope this means you know what happened to Jeff. That's the first time that the tower yanked back my Gulfstream on takeoff.
Brass: No kidding. Well, there's always a first for everything. 
 
Brass: We can talk in here.
Mick Sheridan: Something wrong with your office?
Brass: No.

 
Brass: You seem to have bad luck with the people who work for you.
Mick Sheridan: If that's a joke, it's in pretty poor taste.
Brass: Three years ago, you were busted with an eight ball of cocaine in your luggage. You claimed that your personal assistant had planted it.
Mick Sheridan: That's because he did. The charges against me were dropped. The poor kid had a serious problem. I got him into a program. Understand he's doing better now. 
Brass: I hear you bought him a car to shut him up and take the rap.
Mick Sheridan: The media spins everything ... 
 
Brass: The media. We found an ounce of cocaine in Jeff Powell's personal effects. He was buying drugs for you.
Mick Sheridan: I don't do drugs. And I had no idea that Jeff had a drug problem.
Brass: Last time, you bought a car, this time, an elaborate fantasy to shut him up. The problem is, he's dead. And that makes you responsible.
Mick Sheridan: Captain Brass ... you've seen too many of my movies. I'd like to call my attorney now.


SUBJECT: JEFFREY POWELL
TIME / ACTORS / ACTION
5:00 PM / HEIDI + RANDY /
-Drive to 20511 Fornum Rd.
-HEIDI collects $7,000 cash for evening.
-RANDY collects $12,000 cash for evening.

6:00 PM / HEIDI /
-Rent reserved Ferrari at Extravagant Automobile Rentals
-Drive to Palermo. Utilize valet parking. Tip at least $20.
7:00 PM / RANDY /
-Rent reserved Corvette at Zenith Rental Cars.
-Drive to Cue-T. Play pool and wait for HEIDI to arrive.
7:15 PM / HEIDI /
-SUBJECT has been told the scene at Palermo begins at the casino bar.
-SUBJECT believes &quot;early bird gets the worm.&quot;
-Confirm sub-rosa he is there. Then proceed with ...
7:15 PM / HEIDI /
-Enter the Palermo bar and negotiate close proximity
-Act upset. Point out random high roller as abusive
 
 
Sara: The script for Jeff's fantasy starts with Heidi and Randy renting the cars at 6:00 P.M. Then it says Randy drives the Corvette to the Cue-T and waits.
Catherine: And Heidi takes the Ferrari. Finds Jeff at the Palermo bar.
 

 
Sara:  Her instructions were: &quot;Act upset. Make up story about abusive high roller boyfriend. Allow Jeff to offer comfort.&quot;
Heidi Wolff:  No, I'm not.
Jeff Powell: Anything I can do for you?
Heidi Wolff: It's my damn boyfriend.

Nick: Any guy would help a beautiful woman in distress, right? 
Grissom: Some guys are intimidated by beauty ... 

Grissom: ... or fear rejection. Evidently, Caprice knew Jeff well enough to know he'd want to help her.
 
 
Sara:  Heidi's next instructions were to repay subject's kindness by buying drink.&quot;
Catherine: Which she then accidentally spills on his clothes.
 
 
Catherine:  Insists on buying him a new outfit, one that he couldn't afford on his own.
 
 
Sara:  Everything was scripted down to the minute -- the clothes, ... 
 
Sara:  ... the Cue-T, ... 
 
Sara:  ... the car.
 
BACK TO SCENE: 
Grissom: Sheridan told Caprice that Jeff had been shooting pool since he was a kid. So betting on and winning a big money game was probably just part of the fantasy.
Nick: Yeah, and he was a NASCAR fan. So the whole staged car chase, narrow getaway was everything he dreamed about.
Catherine: As was the partying in his hotel room. And the s*x.
 
Sara: Not quite. According to the script, &quot;your employment ends with the good-night kiss. You are not requested to perform, nor compensated for, any activity you initiate beyond this point. 
 
Sara:  Should nature take its course, you are on your own.&quot;
 
Jeff: C'mere.
 
 
Grissom: So the staged fantasy ended at Jeff's hotel room.
 
Grissom: Which means he was off script when he was killed.
 
Nick: I don't get it. After a night like that, I would have felt like Superman. Why leave the girl?

 
 
Grissom: The victim got to the shopping arcade fifteen minutes after he got off the elevator. It's not that long a walk. I need to know what he was doing during that time.
 
Archie Johnson: There's your guy.
 
Grissom: Whatever he's reacting to is off camera.  Somewhere in the direction of the baccarat tables.
Archie Johnson: When the blonde came up to the vic in the bar the first time, she pointed in that same direction.
Grissom: What's going on over there?
 
Grissom: He's playing solo with the dealer. That's ten or twenty thousand a hand. Guy's a whale.
 
Archie Johnson: Your vic's really going at him.
 
Grissom: You know, Heidi was only supposed to tell a story about a high roller boyfriend. Maybe she actually picked somebody out.
 
Grissom: What are you doing?
Archie Johnson: I've been looking at video three days solid now. My butt fell asleep.

Archie Johnson: Wait a second. I've seen those guys behind him somewhere else.
 
Archie Johnson: Hang on.
 
Archie Johnson: Jeff went from the casino to shopping arcade, and right behind him ... there they are. Same guys.
 
 
Grissom: Well, call me Ishmael.
Archie Johnson: Why?
Grissom: You need to read more, Arch.


 
 
Grissom: Jeff was a winner at everything he tried that night.
Sofia Curtis: And he was falling in love.
Catherine: Which can make a guy do some pretty stupid things. So anytime more than $10,000 hits the table, the casino's required to ID the player. 
Grissom: Which may help us harpoon the whale.
Catherine: Yep.
 
Pit Boss: What's the occasion?
Sofia Curtis: We're investigating the death of the young man on the casino's loading dock.
 
Grissom: Are you familiar with this guy?
Pit Boss: That's Dennis Kim. Flies in four, five times a year from Seoul to play baccarat. Very generous player. We reserve a table exclusively for him while he's in town.
Sofia Curtis: He still in town?
Pit Boss: Yeah. He's at his table right now.

 
Pit Boss: There's Mr. Kim, right there.
Sofia Curtis: Mr. Kim, we need to speak with you for a moment.
 
Dennis Kim: Yes?
Sofia Curtis: Do you recognize this man?
 
Dennis Kim: Why?
Catherine: He's dead.
Grissom: Just before he died, he was talking to you.
 
Dennis Kim: Oh, yes, I remember him. He was shouting about some girl.


 
Jeff Powell: Hey you! Hey! Guess what? 
 
Jeff Powell: Heidi, she doesn't need you or your money anymore, man. That's right. Because she has everything she needs now -- love and respect. So you go ahead and play your little card game. All right? 'Cause you the playa. But I'm the man. The man.
 
BACK TO SCENE
Dennis Kim: Crazy boy.
 
Catherine: Did you guys see where he went?
 
Dennis Kim: 
Bodyguard 1: 
 
Catherine: Well, we're gonna need to take those shoes.  White paint.
Dennis Kim: And if I don't permit this?
Grissom: We'll just hold your men until we get a warrant.
(Kim thinks about it for a moment, then -- 
Dennis Kim: 
 
Grissom: Kamsahamnida. 
Dennis Kim: 
 




 

 
 
Catherine:  The bodyguards dragged Jeff through the service corridor. 
 
Catherine:  Between the drugs and the confidence, he must've put up quite a fight.
 
Jeffrey Powell: Hey!
 
 

 
Catherine: Most likely, he was still alive when they left. They probably thought they just had taught him a lesson.
Grissom: They did: Don't confuse fantasy with reality.
 
Greg: Well, hush money or not, you have to admit that whole fantasy night thing was a pretty cool gift from a very generous boss.
 
Sara: Greg, don't you have a birthday coming up?
Greg: Why, yes, Sara, I do.
 
Catherine: I'm thinking ear-shredding rock, a beautiful model, boatloads of sushi and ... latex?
Greg: Eh, that was last year.
 
Grissom: I think fantasies are best kept private.
 
 
Nick: Hey. Want to know why Jeff left the girl and went downstairs?
Catherine: Okay.
Nick: This was dropped off at the Palermo. Manager sent it over.
 
Catherine: Nice rocks.
Nick: Mm-hmm. Jeff must have spent the ten g's he won playing pool on it.
 
Nick: Gift wrapped, never picked it up.
Catherine: Yeah, there was a jewelry store right across from the service corridor entrance.
 
Jeff Powell:  Most I ever spent on a girl.
 
Jeff Powell: Most I ever held in my hand at one time.
 
 
Nick: You know, the biggest fantasy in Vegas is that everything here happens by chance. Nothing here happens by chance. The odds are set before you get off the plane.
 
Greg: You know, I'd settle for a birthday breakfast.
 
Catherine: Now that is a fantasy.
 
 
(Hold on Grissom and we ...

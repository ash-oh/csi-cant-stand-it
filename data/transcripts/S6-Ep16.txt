<p>[INT. SIDLEY RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Angie walks around the living room with a glass of champagne in her hand as she admires the photo nudes on the walls.. She's dressed in her black lace underwear and an open shirt. ) </p>
<p>(She looks over at Martin, who is starting a fire in the large fireplace.) </p>
<p><strong>Angie</strong>: You know, first time I had s*x was in front of a fire ... on a bear skin rug.</p>
<p>(She sits down on the bearskin rug.) </p>
<p><strong>Angie</strong>: It was so romantic.</p>
<p>(Martin laughs wryly as he joins her. He picks up his glass.)</p>
<p><strong>Martin Sidley</strong>: Gee, and all this time ... I thought you were still a virgin.</p>
<p><strong>Angie</strong>: (snickers) Yeah, right. You only asked for my number 'cause you heard I was easy.</p>
<p><strong>Martin Sidley</strong>: Oh, you found me out.</p>
<p><strong>Angie</strong>: I did.</p>
<p>(As they laugh, something from inside the chimney falls into the fire. The fire crackles and grows larger.) </p>
<p><strong>Angie</strong>: Cheers.</p>
<p>(They clink glasses and sip. Angie sees the smoking coming out of the fireplace. Something is blocking the chimney.) </p>
<p><strong>Angie</strong>: Oh, my God!</p>
<p>(The smoke alarm beeps.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. SIDLEY RESIDENCE - FRONT -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(The police and fire department vehicles are parked outside the Sidley residence.) </p>
<p>(The firemen climb up the roof to check the chimney. They peer inside and find a dead body.) </p>
<p><strong>Fireman</strong>: We've got a body! Alert homicide and CSI!</p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO: </p>
<p>[INT. SIDLEY RESIDENCE - ATTIC -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(The attic door opens. Sara and Nick climb inside to check the chimney.) </p>
<p>(Sara looks around and sees various items - bikes, roller skates, boots, crutches - around. She sees a dead, petrified rat in a trap.) </p>
<p>(Nick puts his kit down.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Chimney extends about four feet from the roofline ... assuming the vic was average height ... and didn't curl up ... head should be right about here.</p>
<p>(Sara drills her way through the bricks in the chimney.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Good!</p>
<p>(She clears off some bricks.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(She and Nick clear the bricks. Nick punches through the clay backing and they find the burnt remains.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Whew! Smoldering flesh has the stench of burnt pork ... except much worse.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I smell a little decomp, but mostly the fireplace down below. The body's really positioned too far to be in that condition.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Which means ... the vic was charbroiled somewhere else, tossed in the chimney, and smoked.</p>
<p>(Nick nods.) </p>
<p>CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[INT. SIDLEY RESIDENCE - ATTIC -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Nick and David Phillips stand in front of the open chimney looking at the burned body.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Check out that mold. It's just eating away at the flesh.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: That much mold would suggest he was burned at least a few days ago.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: He?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: I measured the pelvic bone -- sub-pubic angle's less than ninety degrees. He's male. Any suggestions on how to proceed? </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Wrap and roll.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Great.</p>
<p>(David picks up a sheet and hands it to Nick. David spreads a second sheet out on the attic floor. Nick wraps his sheet around the body.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay, you get the head.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: On three ...</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: One, two ... three.</p>
<p>(They remove the body from the chimney.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Mm! He's lighter than I expected.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Most of the muscle and flesh have burned away. He's pretty well drained of fluids. He probably weighed twice as much when he was alive.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Well, that would explain how the killer was able to carry him up to the roof and then foist him down the chimney.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah. Get him to the morgue.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. SIDLEY RESIDENCE - FRONT - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Sofia talks with Martin Sidley.) </p>
<p><strong>Martin Sidley</strong>: I started the fire and the smoke just started pouring out.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: And it was just the two of you in the house.</p>
<p><strong>Martin Sidley</strong>: Yeah. </p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>(Meanwhile, Brass talks with Angie.) </p>
<p><strong>Angie</strong>: I had just gotten off work; I came over for a nightcap.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So how long have you known each other?</p>
<p><strong>Angie</strong>: Mm ... a few months.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Do you live alone?</p>
<p><strong>Martin Sidley</strong>: Yeah. Divorced. Have a son in college.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Did you hear anything up on the roof in the past week or so?</p>
<p><strong>Martin Sidley</strong>: Well, no, I was out of town on business till yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: And when was the last time you used the fireplace?</p>
<p><strong>Martin Sidley</strong>: A few months ago ... around Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I mean, there was a dead man in your chimney. Didn't you notice anything when you lit the fireplace?</p>
<p><strong>Angie</strong>: Martin's got a rat problem. Um ... the little suckers get caught in the traps, and just stink for a couple of days. We smelled something, but we figured it was ...</p>
<p><strong>Martin Sidley</strong>: ... a rat.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (o.s.) Excuse me, Mr. Sidley? </p>
<p>(He turns around to find Sara standing behind him.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: There's a ladder leaning against the side of the house ... ?</p>
<p><strong>Martin Sidley</strong>: Yeah, that's mine. It been there since ... about New Year's, when I took down the Christmas lights.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'd like to get a set of your fingerprints. I'm going to be dusting the ladder for prints. I'd like to eliminate yours.</p>
<p><strong>Martin Sidley</strong>: Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(David goes over the body, taking various swab samples. He lifts a plastic credit card-shaped item out of the victim's shirt pocket. He looks at it and places it in a metal bin.) </p>
<p>(Nick walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Crispy though and through. Based on the melted fibers, he was probably wearing a polyester shirt.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, synthetics are just plastic polymers. They melt instead of burn.<br />
(Nick sees the burned plastic in the metal bin.) What's that?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Oh, some sort of plastic. I found it where his shirt pocket would've been. I'm thinking maybe a credit card.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Good, good. I'll work it up; try to get an ID.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY] </p>
<p>(Catherine walks through the hallway when Warrick finds her.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Catherine ...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Do you remember this Caroline Fitzgibbons case? About a year ago? </p>
<p>(She takes the file from him.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Of course I do, yeah. Missing person, we never found her.</p>
<p><strong>Brown</strong>: Yeah, she was a minor, allegedly having an affair with a Mr. Martin ... Sidley?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Ugh, yeah, what a creep.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [EXT. SIDLEY RESIDENCE - FRONT PORCH - DAY] Catherine is at the front door talking with Martin Sidley.) </p>
<p><strong>Martin Sidley</strong>: She's an aspiring photographer. I recently purchased several of her self-portraits.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mr. Sidley, her father says that she was headed over here the day before yesterday, and he hasn't heard from her since. </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Would you mind if we come in?</p>
<p><strong>Martin Sidley</strong>: You know, now's not a good time. So, unless you have a warrant, the answer is no.</p>
<p>(He closes the door on them.) </p>
<p>END OF FLASHBACK CUT TO: </p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS SCENERY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[EXT. SIDLEY RESIDENCE - FRONT -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Warrick and Catherine exit their SUV. Sara sees them.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What are you guys doing here?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We were hoping that you'd invite us to help out with your investigation.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Invite you?!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Warrick and I were looking for a missing person about a year ago, and we tried to get a warrant to search this residence. The owner denied us access.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Now that it's a crime scene, it's fair game, if you're part of the investigation. </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You're picking up what we're putting down. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, I've processed room-to-room, photo-documented, sketched the layout ... feel free to dig a little deeper. I'm gonna dust the chimney for prints. I'll be on the roof for awhile.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Nick processes the burned ID card. Greg walks in and looks around at the monitor.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I'll take &quot;video spectral analysis&quot; for two hundred, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, it's a charred piece of plastic found in chimney guy's pocket. It may be a credit card. I'm trying to get some ID off of it.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: That's a gym membership card.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: How do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: The logo in the corner -- it's Burt's Gym -- I belong to the one on Flamingo.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Oh, yeah? You, uh ... been pumping iron there, Greg?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yeah, a little, uh ... Muy Thai. It's competitive kickboxing. Gotta balance weights with cardio, you know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, okay, thanks. Anyway, I'll, uh, check it. Maybe I can get a membership name.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Oh, you won't. Member names are printed in black ink. VSA only brings out the colors.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Oh. Maybe it'll help us clear up the photo.</p>
<p>(Nick works on the photo and comes up with a picture.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. SIDLEY RESIDENCE - ROOFTOP -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Sara is on the roof. She dusts the chimney bricks and removes a set of prints.) </p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[INT. SIDLEY RESIDENCE - LIVING ROM - DAY]</p>
<p>(Catherine looks around the living room. On the side are framed photos of a beautiful, blonde-haired woman, Caroline Fitzgibbons.) </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The photo of Caroline Fitzgibbons from the file folder. End of flashback.) </p>
<p>(Catherine turns around to look at the living room.) </p>
<p>(Sara carefully makes her way down the side of the roof to the vent.) </p>
<p>(She takes out a camera and snaps a photo of the vent. She dusts and finds a print.</p>
<p>(Catherine uses the ALS on the hardwood floors on the base of the stairs.) </p>
<p>(Various dissolves as Catherine works throughout the room.)</p>
<p>(Warrick snaps a photo in the bedroom. He looks around. He opens the chest at the base of the bed. He walks over to the desk and opens the drawer. He snaps a photo of the drawer.) </p>
<p>(Sara turns around and finds a white piece of thin plastic. She snaps a photo and picks it up.) </p>
<p>[INT. SIDLEY RESIDENCE - FOYER / LIVING ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Using the ALS, Catherine finds something on the stairs. She quickly swabs it and tests it for blood. It tests negative. Warrick walks down the stairs and notices the photos in the living room.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, hello, Caroline. She was, what, like 16? Isn't it a felony to purchase pornographic pictures of a minor?</p>
<p>(Warrick snaps a photo of the photo.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, believe it or not, exceptions are made for photographs with serious artistic or scientific merit.</p>
<p>(He walks over to the other photos hanging on the walls.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (scoffs) Oh, yeah. These look real scientific.</p>
<p>(He snaps photos of them as well.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I don't make the rules. So found a large, diffuse pool of fluorescence here on the wood floor. It's consistent with bleach or some other cleaning compound.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Bleach on a wood floor, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mm.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I presume you pheno'ed it?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah. It was negative for blood.</p>
<p>(Warrick looks at the stairs.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'm looking for the tiniest crack between the planks. You know, you can scrub blood off a surface, but you can't scrub beneath it.</p>
<p>(Warrick takes out a pocket knife and pries it in the crack in the stairs.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah ...</p>
<p>(A piece of the board clatters to the floor. On the board is a spot of blood.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We got blood.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Catherine talks with Martin Sidley and his lawyer Duane McWane.) </p>
<p><strong>Martin Sidley</strong>: As I told you last year, I knew Caroline professionally. We had coffee a couple of times. She was a promising photographer; I'm a collector. We had a lot to talk about.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: How many times is &quot;a couple of times&quot;?</p>
<p><strong>Martin Sidley</strong>: I don't know, five or six times over a month or two.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Were they dates?</p>
<p><strong>Martin Sidley</strong>: Well, we weren't having sexual relations, if that's what you're getting at.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Was she ever in your house?</p>
<p><strong>Martin Sidley</strong>: Yeah, I invited her over to see my collection. Look, I'll admit that I was attracted to her, but when she told me her real age, I told her, it was inappropriate for us to see each other.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: How very responsible of you. And you had that conversation how many days before she went missing?</p>
<p><strong>Duane McWane</strong>: I'm sorry, but we're not here to talk about Caroline, all right? So unless you're on some kind of cold-case fishing expedition ...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We found an old blood pool in your living room. You want to tell me about that?</p>
<p><strong>Duane McWane</strong>: Don't answer that. Ms. Willows, let's get something straight. You found a body in the chimney, so you searched his house for clues, but you had no legal right to look for any evidence unrelated to this case.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We were just working the scene.</p>
<p>(Catherine places an evidence bag with the piece of wood on the table. She clears her throat.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: This piece of wood was pried from your living room. The surface was scrubbed with a cleaning agent, but we found a spot of blood ... right there.</p>
<p>(She points to the spot of blood on the wood.) </p>
<p><strong>Martin Sidley</strong>: You mean, you ripped up my damn floor. What is going on here?</p>
<p><strong>Duane McWane</strong>: As soon as this is over, I intend to file an emergency motion to limit the scope or your warrant. I also intend to file a motion in limine to exclude this evidence, which was illegally seized, in violation of my client's fourth amendment rights. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: This house was processed in accordance with CSI protocol, but do what you have to do.</p>
<p><strong>Martin Sidley</strong>: You've been coming at me since day one, and I'm starting to resent it.</p>
<p><strong>Duane McWane</strong>: Martin ...</p>
<p><strong>Martin Sidley</strong>: You have a problem with me because I appreciate younger women? I had nothing to do with that girl's disappearance. You want to come after me? You're going to regret it.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Your client has a bit of a temper.</p>
<p><strong>Duane McWane</strong>: Well, if you don't have any questions pertaining to the dead body in his chimney, we're done here.</p>
<p>[OBSERVATION ROOM]</p>
<p>(Nick watches as Duane McWane gets to his feet. Catherine holds up a hand.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Sit down. Please. </p>
<p>(Catherine turns to the window and nods. Nick leaves the observation room.) </p>
<p>[INTERVIEW ROOM]</p>
<p>(Nick walks into the room.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Gentlemen, this is Nick Stokes. He's a colleague of mine. We found identification on the decedent in the chimney.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: A gym card. Actually, it was found in his pocket. The Crime Lab restored the charred image, but we couldn't get a name. We we're hoping you could help make a positive ID.</p>
<p>(Nick puts the photo on the table. Martin looks at his lawyer. Duane McWane nods.) </p>
<p>(He looks at the photo.) </p>
<p><strong>Martin Sidley</strong>: This belonged to the person in my chimney?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yes, sir. You recognize him?</p>
<p><strong>Martin Sidley</strong>: Well, this is-this is Tad. This is my son.</p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Dr. Robbins goes over the body with Nick.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Let me guess: He burned to death.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: I can't confirm COD.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Come on, Doc, this isn't a hard one. </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: His bones are fractured; check out the femur.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: It's not uncommon to find bone fractures in fire victims.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI EFX: The bones are on fire, crackle and break.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (V.O.) The body produces heat, causing the long bones to contract and fracture.</p>
<p>(End of CGI EFX.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Well, that's right, but check out the chips in the skull.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Bone chipping is also a symptom of extreme heat.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI EFX: The skull burns and the bones chip away.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (V.O.) Very good. So, if we didn't know better, fire could be the cause of death.</p>
<p>(End of CGI EFX.) </p>

Ms. Willows, the man paid her $800 for her photos and told her she had a great eye. (He gives the plastic bag to Catherine.) I brought her brushes and combs. Anything else I could find.

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I know why a John Doe was stuffed down the Sidley's chimney. When you and Warrick were working that missing person's case, you couldn't get a warrant, and Martin wouldn't let you in, right?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Don Fitzgibbons tried to gain access to the house through the son ... </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: But the son wouldn't cooperate.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I think he knew that if the house became a crime scene, CSI could get in there.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, it's a logical theory, but to kill someone and stuff him in a chimney in hopes of getting information on your missing daughter ...</p>
<p>(Sara pulls up the prints.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Check out the screen. On the left is an unknown fingerprint I lifted off the chimney cap. On the right is a partial I lifted off of Don Fitzgibbons' post-it you took out of Tad's dorm room. Now, the print on the post-it is only a partial, but it's a match to the chimney cap.</p>
<p>(She compares the prints. They match.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I also found trace evidence on the roof. Polyethylene plastic. Don Fitzgibbons works at Desert Palms Hospital. I just got off the phone with the administrator. The hospital's body bags are made out of ...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Polyethylene plastic?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Don Fitzgibbons has access to those body bags.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [EXT. SIDLEY RESIDENCE - ROOFTOP - NIGHT] Don Fitzgibbons is up on the roof and pulls the body in the body bag up to the chimney. He pulls the body bag and snags it on the roofing. A piece is left behind.) </p>
<p>(He climbs up the chimney and unscrews the chimney cap. He takes the body out of the bag and dumps it into the chimney.) </p>
<p>END OF FLASHBACK CUT TO: </p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Catherine talks with Don Fitzgibbons.) </p>
<p><strong>Don Fitzgibbons</strong>: It's true. All of it. You gonna arrest me?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You just admitted to murder; I think you know the answer.</p>
<p><strong>Don Fitzgibbons</strong>: Hold on. I didn't kill anyone.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And the body in the chimney?</p>
<p><strong>Don Fitzgibbons</strong>: (sighs) I took the body from Desert Palms Hospital, from the morgue. He was already dead, a John Doe. Auto accident in a stolen vehicle. Car exploded, he was burned beyond recognition. Ms. Willows, I stole a dead body and I trespassed, but that's it.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And Tad Sidley's ID? Did you place the gym card on the body?</p>
<p><strong>Don Fitzgibbons</strong>: You're a mother, right?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Don Fitzgibbons</strong>: Why do you think I did it?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You wanted Martin Sidley to know what it's like to lose a child.</p>
<p><strong>Don Fitzgibbons</strong>: (nods) When I was in Tad's dorm room, I snagged it. I scorched the surface of the card to make it look like it belonged to the John Doe ... to make Martin believe that it was his son. I'd hoped that you'd be able to restore the image. (crying) Look ... I wish I could say that I was sorry for the trouble I've put you through, or the-the petty crimes that I've committed, but I didn't hurt anyone ... and Martin Sidley is behind bars, and my daughter's getting her funeral. And that's all I wanted.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm sorry. I'm sorry that we couldn't find your daughter without your help.</p>
<p>(He nods.) </p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>
<p><strong>End</strong></p>

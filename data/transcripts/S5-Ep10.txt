<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY COMMUNITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[EXT. EMPTY LOT - COMMUNITY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Brass and Sofia stand around a dead body while Grissom crouches down to examine it closer.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, the gang unit says our D.B. is a sixteen-year-old Tyson Plummer.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: How many holes in the victim?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I count four.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Eleven shell casings. Shooter emptied the gun -- so he was moving and shooting. Only hit the vic four times.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: She talks to herself.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hey, it works for me.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Bullets that missed hit the outside building wall.</p>
<p>(She turns and looks back at the gun holes in the outside building wall.) </p>
<p><strong>Kid 1</strong>: (o.s.) Hey, man, what ya doing in my back alley! </p>
<p>(Greg is standing on the side mapping the area when the kid's shouts draw his attention. On the sidewalk, he sees two kids playing near the trash. One kid holds out his hand as if holding a gun at the other kid.) </p>
<p>KIDN 1: Bang, bang, bang, bang.</p>
<p><strong>Kid 2</strong>: Man, you know Andre didn't cap him like that.</p>
<p>(Greg ducks under the crime scene tape and makes his way toward the two kids who continue arguing.) </p>
<p><strong>Kid 1</strong>: Did too.</p>
<p><strong>Kid 2</strong>: Did not!</p>
<p><strong>Kid 1</strong>: Did too!</p>
<p><strong>Kid 2</strong>: How you gonna tell me?</p>
<p><strong>Kid 1</strong>: I saw him ...</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Hey, guys, can I talk to you for a sec?</p>
<p><strong>Kid 2</strong>: Run!</p>
<p>(The two kids turn, see Greg and run. Greg continues to walk slowly toward them.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I just want to ask you a few questions.</p>
<p>(The older kid turns and bumps into the trash bin. He falls, scrambles to his feet and runs. Greg doesn't chase after them.) </p>
<p><strong>Kid 2</strong>: Yo man! Wait up!</p>
<p>(The kids disappear down the block. Greg turns and sees something disturbing. He kneels down to get a better look at a dead body in a trash bin.) </p>
<p>(The dead child is rail thin and shoved into the trash bin.) </p>
<p>(Greg dials his phone.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (to phone) Grissom ...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (from phone) Go ahead, Greg.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (to phone) We got a young male D.B. by the dumpster.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to phone) I'll be right there.</p>
<p>(Grissom glances at Brass. He walks over to the dumpster where Greg is standing.) </p>
<p>(At the crime scene tape surrounding the empty lot, a young man ducks under it. The officer guarding the tape tries to stop him.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Hey, hey!</p>
<p>(He knocks the officer's hands away.) </p>
<p><strong>Leo Plummer</strong>: Get your damn hands off me!</p>
<p>(Sofia turns around to look at the disturbance. Brass approaches the officer and Leo Plummer.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Whoa, whoa. I can't let you touch him. What's your name?</p>
<p>(The young man gets a look at the dead body on the ground and he gasps.) </p>
<p><strong>Leo Plummer</strong>: I'm Plummer. Leo. That's my brother right there. They didn't have to do him like that, Dawg.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I know you know who did this, Leo.</p>
<p><strong>Leo Plummer</strong>: Ain't your problem, man. Whoever did this is gonna get got.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, no, don't say stuff like that. Because only two things can happen: You in shackles or you on a slab. So, let's break the odds this time. What do you say?</p>
<p><strong>Leo Plummer</strong>: You done with me, Bacon? 'Cause I got family to go bury.</p>
<p>(Leo turns and heads back to the crime scene tape. Brass turns and heads back to the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(Near the tape, there's a disturbance as voices rise.) </p>
<p>(Camera whirls around and we see another young man running through the crowd toward Leo Plummer. He pulls out a gun and fires at Leo Plummer's back. Leo is shot point blank several times in the back.)</p>
<p>(Grissom is examining the body and is startled by the gunshots. He looks up.)</p>
<p>(Greg moves to take cover behind the dumpster.) </p>
<p>(A woman screams as the gunshots end. The young man with the gun takes off running. The crowd disburses.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: This is Lincoln three. We've got a four-fifteen-A on scene.</p>
<p>(Grissom watches as Sofia takes off running after the suspect alongside several other officers.) </p>
<p>(Grissom looks at Greg.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Hell no, I'm not okay. Who the hell's shooting at us?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I don't know, but I think our single just turned into a triple.</p>
<p>(Grissom stands up and heads for the newest body at the scene.) </p>
<p>SMASH CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. COMMUNITY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Sara walks up to David Phillips and Greg around the body of the kid in the rubber trash bin. Greg snaps photos as David checks the kid out.) </p>
<p>(In the background, we hear the indistinct police radio transmissions.) </p>
<p>(Sara slows down and puts her kit on the sidewalk as she kneels in front of the body.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Somebody tried to just throw him out with the trash.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: If the dumpster wasn't full he would've ended up at the landfill.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: He hasn't been dead long. He's just coming out of rigor, so I'd say less than twenty-four hours.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: He wasn't in the box long enough to mummify, but the kid looks like an ad for hunger relief. Okay, let's, um, transport him in situ.</p>
<p>(Sara turns and looks at Greg.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Be very careful moving the body. You okay?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yeah. Fine.</p>
<p>(Off to the side, two officers struggle with a man in handcuffs.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Come on, let's go.</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: (o.s.) Rodney King, yo! Rodney King. Yo! Y'all see this? That's Rodney King, Dawg! Let me go, Dawg! Let me go, man!</p>
<p>(The two officers lead the man in handcuffs to the car and put him in the backseat.) </p>
<p>(Sofia walks back toward Grissom and Brass.) </p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: Get off me, man! That's Rodney King, Dawg! Let me ... Get off! Get off me! Get off! Get off me! Bitches! We call it brutality!</p>
<p>(The car door slams shut.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, uh ... you think these concerned citizens are taping the capture of a vicious killer?</p>
<p>(Brass points back to the observers behind the crime scene tape with their camcorders out. The coroners lift up the gurney with the wrapped body on it.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: If they're taping now, maybe they caught that second shooting on video. Maybe you could collect the cameras.</p>
<p>(Brass looks at Sofia and taps his own temple. He smiles and chuckles as he leaves. Grissom turns and looks at Sofia.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I love this guy.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It says &quot;forensics&quot; on our jacket.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: I'm aware of that.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We had plenty of cops chasing the suspect.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: I wasn't chasing the suspect. I was chasing the evidence. I knew the idiot was likely to dump the gun. </p>
<p>(She takes out the bagged gun and hands it to Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: All we have to do is ballistics-match the weapon to both victims. Case closed.</p>
<p>(Grissom takes the gun and looks at Sofia.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. PRISON -- DAY] </p>
<p>(The door buzzes and opens for Warrick and Nick.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, man.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: (o.s.) What's up?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>(They walk through the door and meet with Det. Vartann.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Suspects wait in central holding to be processed and transferred to jail. They assaulted the officers with feces and then the cops went in.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Great.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: To bust some heads.</p>
<p>(The closer they get, the smellier it gets. On the floor are the brown feces stains.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hoo ... so, you've got a Samuel Mendez with a cracked skull listed as death imminent, right?</p>
<p>(They stop in front of the cell with the crime scene taped around it.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Yeah. It's why they kicked it up to homicide.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You think the cops used excessive force here?</p>
<p>(Nick puts his case down and walks over to the empty cell.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Well, if they did it's mitigating circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(The officer removes the tape to open the cell. Nick looks at the mess on the wall.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, well, if they'd've thrown a bunch of feces at me, I would have cracked some skulls too.</p>
<p>(On the middle of the bare floor, there's a gun.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: This is the last place I thought I'd see a gun.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: It was found under the victim.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Could be his.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Arresting officer must have done a lousy search.</p>
<p>(Warrick puts a ruler down and snaps a photo of the gun.) </p>
<p>(Nick stands up and looks around the small cell at the mess.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Wow ... this is a lot of crap. What, did they squat on cue?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Overflowing toilet. There's enough ammunition right there.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So, the cops bust in to get the prisoners under control when they start throwing raw sewage?</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: The prison cell doors open and the guards enter. The fight between the guards and the prisoners starts.)</p>
<p>(End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, there must have been some real bad asses in here. Looks like it got pretty heated.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. PRISON -- HALLWAY - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(The prisoners are lined up in a row. They're all wearing towels and carrying their clothes.) </p>
<p><strong>Overhead</strong>: (p.a.) ... Security Officers for lockdown debriefing.</p>
<p>(An officer puts a package on the car next to the other packages.) </p>
<p>(The next prisoner steps up to Nick.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You want to tell me what happened here?</p>
<p>(The prisoner has a large bruise around his left eye.) </p>
<p><strong>Prisoner 1</strong>: Cops iced the kid. What else you want to know?</p>
<p>(Nick takes a photo of the prisoner.) </p>
<p><strong>Prisoner 1</strong>: Could tell he was a fish from the jump, though.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: A fish?</p>
<p>(Nick snaps another photo.) </p>
<p><strong>Prisoner 1</strong>: New to the game.</p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO: </p>
<p>(The officer takes his boots.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: (o.s.) You want to go to the hold, boy?</p>
<p>(The next prisoner steps up and spits in front of Nick into something off screen.)</p>
<p>(Nick stares up at the very tall Prisoner 2.) </p>
<p><strong>Prisoner 2</strong>: What?</p>
<p>(The prisoner hands the guard his shoes. Nick takes a couple of photos.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You see what happened?</p>
<p>(Prisoner 3 is sporting a large bruise on his left eye, which is shut from the swelling.) </p>
<p><strong>Prisoner 3</strong>: The po-po gutted the fish. I saw the whole thing. Same thing they did to me. Two beatings in one day. Rodney King, yo.</p>
<p>(Nick snaps a photo of Prisoner 3.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. PRISON HOSPITAL - DAY]</p>
<p>(Catherine is standing next to the victim's bed. The victim is hooked up to a lot of machines - still alive, but barely. Next to the bed, she has a camera set up on a tripod. She holds the ruler against the injuries on the victim's head and snaps a couple of photos of it.) </p>
<p><strong>Dr. Franks</strong>: I'm sorry, uh, who are you?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm Catherine Willows. I'm with the Crime Lab.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Franks</strong>: Oh. I'm Dr. Franks, attending. Have you located his family yet?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Franks</strong>: I need to find someone to sign a release, take him off the ventilator.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: He's brain dead?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Franks</strong>: Oh, yeah. I'm hoping the family will donate his organs.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Tell me about his injuries.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Franks</strong>: He's got blunt-force trauma to the frontal and sphenoid bones.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The victim is punched in the face. End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Dr. Franks</strong>: It fragmented his skull, damaged his temporal arteries and imbedded in his brain.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV: The brain cuts and blood spills out. End of CGI POV. Quick flash to: The victim falls to the ground with blood running down his face. End of flash.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, those are shoe prints on his face, which suggests that he was attacked while he was down.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: The victim is already down on the ground. Someone stomps on him with the heel of his boot. End of flash.) </p>
<p><strong>Dr. Franks</strong>: Well, he came from county lock-up. Must have been a hell of a fight.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY - DAY] </p>
<p>(The lid is removed from the rubber bin. Sara holds the flashlight above and looks into the bin at the dead boy. She sees some blond-colored hair on the boy's jeans.) </p>
<p>(David Phillips reaches into the bin to carry the boy's body out. Sara glances at Greg. David removes the body. Greg replaces the lid on the bin and removes the bin off the table.) </p>
<p>(David puts the body on the table.) </p>
<p>(Sara takes a tape lift of the blond-colored hair from the boy's jeans. Someone coughs. She puts the tape lift on the side.) </p>
<p>(Greg examines the bin. Inside, he finds some yellow powder and nail scratchings. He takes a sample of the powder.)</p>
<p>(Back on the body, Sara finds another blond-colored hair strand. She picks it off of the jeans and puts it in a plastic baggie.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY - DAY]</p>
<p>(Robbins goes over his findings with Sara. He shows her the x-rays.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: The victim's about five years old. He was just losing his baby teeth. X-rays show metaphyseal fractures to the right humerus and acromion. They're called corner or bucket-handle fractures.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Shake the baby?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: It's more like snatch and shake. Violent shaking creates shearing forces, causing fragment fractures at the end of the growth plate. It's highly specific for abuse.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: A little boy is sitting on a swing.) </p>
<p><strong>Voice (man)</strong>: (o.s.) I said, Get up!</p>
<p>(A hand grabs the boy's arms and twists. Quick CGI POV to: The bones inside the boy's arms break.) </p>
<p>(End of CGI POV. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: How old do you think these fractures are?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Well, this kind of fracture doesn't usually heal with callus you can easily see. My guess, less than six months.</p>
<p>(Robbins and Sara turn back to the body. Robbins pulls back the sheet.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: He is emaciated. He looks drawn. The only thing missing is a swollen belly.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: It's called cachexia. The soft tissue is diminished and drawn around the skull. The eyes are sunken, and there's prominent tenting where the skin should retract.</p>
<p>(Sara touches the body's ribs.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: His ribs are poking through his skin. He starved to death, didn't he?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: C.O.D. is renal failure due to starvation. His intestinal tract was virtually empty, except for these brown flecks I found. </p>
<p>(He hands Sara a glass container with some powder inside. She looks at it.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Hepatic steatosis, the liver goes yellow and greasy. Ketoacidosis, fat stores are used for energy, and then rhabdomyolysis - the muscles broken down for fuel. Think of the body as digesting itself.</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: A little boy crying. The camera zooms in toward the boy's chest.)</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV to: The skin on the chest dries up and stretches over his ribs.)</p>
<p>(Camera pulls back out past the ribs ... and the clothes ... to the dead little boy in the rubber trash bin.) </p>
<p>(End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: This took weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: I have to admit, this seems especially cruel and unusual.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: When kids are involved, it usually is.</p>

<p>[INT. PRISON - OFFICE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Warrick and Det. Vartann talk with Lt. Kim.) </p>
<p><strong>Lt. Arthur Chen</strong>: It's 10-by-18-foot cell built for 25 people. We've got thirty-five mutts and no place to put the extras. Between the yo's, the cholos and the rednecks, it was bound to happen.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Thirty-five guys, that's a lot of men to fit in one room.</p>
<p><strong>Lt. Arthur Chen</strong>: Cops round them up, we process them. It usually doesn't take long, but today we got jammed.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: What was the problem?</p>
<p><strong>Lt. Arthur Chen</strong>: Computer went down, plumbing backed up. You name it, we had it.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Any rival bangers in the same cell?</p>
<p><strong>Lt. Arthur Chen</strong>: No. I rechecked the roster. We don't want the yo's killing each other in custody. Why we bother, I'll never know.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You ever think an overcrowded cell mixed with bad plumbing was the reason they threw the contents?</p>
<p><strong>Lt. Arthur Chen</strong>: They don't need a reason. Bad monkeys at the zoo.</p>

<p><strong>Lt. Arthur Chen</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Don't you search them again when they get here?</p>
<p><strong>Lt. Arthur Chen</strong>: Is there something you want to get off your chest?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (wry chuckle) A gun in a cell is sloppy police work, man.</p>

<p><strong>Lt. Arthur Chen</strong>: I don't like what you're implying about me or my men.</p>
<p>(Warrick stands up.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Then maybe you need to dial down your attitude. A man is brain dead here! I don't care what he was like when he was alive, and neither should you, don't you think?</p>
<p><strong>Lt. Arthur Chen</strong>: All I know, there's one less b*st*rd I gotta watch my back for. There's five of us, so the odds are in their favor. You're a crime scene tech. I'm law enforcement, which means you don't get to tell me what to do in my jail.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: If I find out you used excessive force on an unarmed prisoner, you won't have a jail.</p>
<p><strong>Lt. Arthur Chen</strong>: I think we're done here.</p>
<p>(Lt. Kim heads for the door.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I don't think so. Not quite. I'm going to need your armor, your shields, your boots and your batons. (shouts) Right now!</p>

<p><strong>Delia Brooks</strong>: Five. Takes battered women a while to see the light, but once they do, there's no going back.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Okay, so the Malton boys were placed in foster care while mom served her sentence.</p>
<p><strong>Delia Brooks</strong>: A single mother, she reinstated her parental rights as soon as she got out of jail. After what happened to her son, she didn't want anything to do with Child Services.</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, I compared all thirty-four pairs -- I came up with one sole pattern ... (Warrick puts the pair of boots on the table in front of them.) ... and one suspect -- Vincent Mendoza ... booked for meth manufacture.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, the official C.O.D. was blunt force trauma to the head, not stomping.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, it's not unreasonable to think the same guy that caused the blunt force trauma can also stomp him.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, that all sounds good, but why go to all that trouble?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Because the gun was hot. Ran it though IBIS. It was used in an execution-style murder.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The last thing the guy wanted to do was to get caught with a gun that had a body on it.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, well, this victim looks like the perfect patsy to drop a gun on.</p>
<p>(Nick picks up the photo of the victim with the shoe print and looks at it.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah ... little fish in a tank full of sharks.</p>
<p>FADE OUT (to sound of chomping).</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Det. Vartann and Warrick interview Vincent Mendoza with his lawyer, Margaret Finn, next to him.) </p>
<p><strong>Margaret Finn</strong>: What's on the table, gentlemen?</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Murder, two counts.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Your client killed a man in a holding cell and tried to frame the cops for it.</p>
<p><strong>Vincent Mendoza</strong>: That's bull and you know it.</p>
<p><strong>Margaret Finn</strong>: Shh. Let's hear the corroborating evidence, and it'd better be good.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Mr. Mendoza was hooked in a raid on a meth lab. Problem was, he was carrying a concealed weapon and had no time to ditch it.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: He dropped the weapon down his pants, planned to get rid of it in Central Holding before the cavity search.</p>
<p><strong>Margaret Finn</strong>: So far, I'm not hearing anything you can actually prove.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, I'm sure Vincent here knew a lot of people inside since he is a repeat offender. But only one man didn't fit, huh? Fear must've been rolling off him in waves so strong you could probably smell it.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [CENTRAL HOLDING] Vincent Mendoza watches as the guard walks down the corridor toward them. He walks to the back of the cell and unzips his pants where he removes the revolver.)</p>
<p>(On the bench, Sam Mendez turns and glances nervously at him.) </p>
<p><strong>Vincent Mendoza</strong>: What you looking at, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Sam Mendez</strong>: Nothing. Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Vincent Mendoza</strong>: I said, what're you looking at, Mark?</p>
<p><strong>Sam Mendez</strong>: Nothing. Nothing.</p>
<p>(Vincent Mendoza grabs Sam and slams him against the wall. He starts bashing his head against the toilet. He tosses him to the ground and drops the gun intentionally on the ground near the body.) </p>
<p>(He stomps on Sam Mendez.)</p>
<p><strong>Inmate</strong>: (shouts) 911! 911, man!\</p>
<p>(A fight breaks out in the small cell.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(Vincent Mendoza looks at Warrick and chuckles.) </p>
<p><strong>Vincent Mendoza</strong>: Typical. Knew you guys would try to pin this on me. I wasn't anywhere near the fish.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: You sure about that?</p>
<p><strong>Vincent Mendoza</strong>: That's what I said, isn't it?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, it's good to know, since your boot prints were found on the victim's head.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: See, you didn't want to get caught with a gun used in another homicide. A meth dealer, your partner, was found in the desert two weeks ago.</p>
<p><strong>Margaret Finn</strong>: Any one of those guys could've carried a gun into the holding cell.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It's not likely, unless you can explain how Vincent here got his pubic hair and feces caught in the gun's hammer.</p>
<p><strong>Margaret Finn</strong>: Give us some time.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: How's twenty-five to life sound?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. SEVEN SINS -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Brass and Sara walk into the strip joint.) </p>
<p><strong>Lyric</strong>: True respect and ghetto love / now raise it up / 'cause everything in life gonna come to an end / because it ... </p>
<p>(They walk over to a woman in the back.) </p>
<p><strong>Divine</strong>: Forty buys the lips, a hundy gets you south. Goes double for around the world.</p>
<p>(The guy she's with nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Divine</strong>: You got a car? (He nods again.) You sure about that?</p>
<p><strong>Guy</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Divine</strong>: 'Cause you don't look like you got a car to me.</p>
<p>(Brass walks up to them and points to his badge on his jacket pocket.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Take a hike, John. I'm her next appointment.</p>
<p>(The guy she's with leaves.) </p>
<p><strong>Divine</strong>: I didn't do nothing but sit here, officer.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: On your feet.</p>
<p>(She gets to her feet.) </p>
<p><strong>Divine</strong>: Can't believe you're gonna ruin my day for this. You don't have enough to charge me with solicitation. </p>
<p>(Sara reaches out and touches Divine's blond hair. Divine pulls away.) </p>
<p><strong>Divine</strong>: Hey! Watch it, bitch.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It's a wig, hair is consistent. Could you open your mouth for me, please?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Come on, you can do that in your sleep, honey. Open up or we'll have to stick you with a needle.</p>
<p>(Divine rolls her eyes and opens her mouth.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - CATHERINE'S OFFICE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Grissom steps up, carrying his fetus pig in a bottle. He lingers in the doorway and knocks on the door.) </p>
<p>(Catherine's sitting behind her desk. She looks up and sees him.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Taking your pet for a walk?</p>
<p>(Grissom walks in and sits down.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Know how much you like my little fetal pig, so I'm giving him to you as an office-warming gift.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: That is so thoughtful. Now tell me why you really stopped by. You checking up on me?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What've you heard? Who talked to you?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: See? You've been on the job for a week and you're already paranoid.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (laughs) When I was your right-hand and your left, I always knew that if it hit the fan, that you'd be the one to get dirty.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hey, that's the job.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, that's the job. (Grissom nods.) Did you ever play politics?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I once ran for president of the science club in junior high. Mary Hardy beat me out by one vote.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm going to guess that you didn't vote for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm not any good at politics. And it's cost me. It's how I lost Nick and Warrick.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Your loss was my gain.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah. And at least they're in good hands.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Brass and Divine sit across the table from each other.) </p>
<p><strong>Divine</strong>: We been sitting here a long-ass time.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What can I say? I like your company.</p>
<p><strong>Divine</strong>: What'd you bring me down here for? I was only trying to make a few bucks.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(Sara knocks on the door and walks in carrying a file folder. She slides the folder across the table toward Divine.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: DNA's a match.</p>
<p><strong>Divine</strong>: Match to what?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: To one of your hairs that you left on the body of a little boy.</p>
<p><strong>Divine</strong>: I don't know what you're talking about.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No? I wonder why anyone would leave one kid with you much less three.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You have seven alleles in common with the dead boy. Although that's not enough to say you're related, it's certainly enough to keep digging.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know, I ran your wants and warrants. It kicked out some aliases. I mean, Devine's a street name. But you're also known as Darlene Lewis, married briefly to a grifter. And a.k.a. Darlene Malton. Hey, that's the same last name as the victim.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: To starve anyone is beyond me, but to do it to a child ... a relative, is unforgivable.</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: Divine empties out the rubber trash bin and puts Devon inside. She shoves the cover back on the bin.) </p>
<p>(End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Divine</strong>: Wasn't even like that. My cousin Candy left me with them bad-ass kids and no money. How am I supposed to feed them?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You don't look like you've missed any meals to me.</p>
<p><strong>Divine</strong>: Know what, skinny bitch, go to hell. I just scrape by.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: If you couldn't take care of them, why didn't you just turn them over to Social Services?</p>
<p><strong>Divine</strong>: I promised I wouldn't. Little D got hurt last time. She would've killed me.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What's she going to do when she finds out her son is dead?</p>
<p><strong>Divine</strong>: I did the best I could.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Okay, where are the boys now?</p>
<p>(Divine glances over at Sara.) </p>
<p><strong>Divine</strong>: Uh-uh, you're not gonna blame this on me. I want a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You can have a lawyer after you give me the address. But let me tell you something -- if those boys die, I'm going to make it my business to see you get the death penalty.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. DIVINE'S RESIDENCE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(A couple of neighborhood kids walk by and see Greg standing out in the front yard.) </p>
<p><strong>Neighborhood Kid</strong>: What's up, white boy? What you looking at?</p>
<p>(Brass walks out of the house.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: There's no one in the house.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Where are the kids?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I don't know, let's check around back.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(Brass, Sara and Greg move around the house to the back yard.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (V.O.) So, turns out that mom was sending money after all. I found this letter inside mailed from Seattle with three hundred bucks in it for the kids' upkeep. And that skanky bitch used it to buy a new TV.</p>
<p>(They look around the backyard and see the hut to the storage shed. It's bolted shut from the outside.) </p>
<p>(Brass and Sara pull out their guns. Brass unlocks the door.) </p>
<p>(He opens the door.)</p>
<p>[INT. DIVINE'S RESIDENCE - STORAGE SHED - DAY -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Brass, Sara and Greg walk into the cellar. The stairs lead down beneath the ground. The paint is peeling from the walls.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Paint chips.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Smells like a toilet.</p>
<p>(They reach the bottom and start walking between the shelves.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, she never let them upstairs. (calls out) Kevin, Raymond ...</p>
<p>(He reaches the back of the storage shed and looks in between the last shelving and the wall. He sees a pair of legs on the floor.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, no. I'm going to call an ambulance.</p>
<p>(He backs away to make the call. Sara steps forward to check on the little boy.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (to radio) This is Detective Jim Brass. I need EMS.</p>
<p><strong>Dispatch</strong>: (from radio) Copy that, EMS. Over.</p>
<p>(Sara checks for a pulse and finds one.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (shouts) He's alive! We need water and blankets.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (o.s.) I'll get them.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Oh, my gosh.</p>
<p>(Behind Sara, a small hand reaches out and touches her shoulder. She turns around and sees another little boy crying.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey. Are you Kevin or Raymond?</p>
<p>(Sara holds the little boy as he cries.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It's all right. It's all right, you're safe now. It's okay.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(An officer escorts Divine through the hallway past Brass and Sara, who watch from the reception desk.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, Seattle P.D. has located Candace Malton. They're putting her on a plane tonight. They said she's pretty broken up.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: She left her kids with her hooker cousin. She should've known better.</p>
<p>(Brass nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Where are you going to take her first, the hospital or the morgue?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Guess I might as well get it over with. I mean, once she sees the kids she's not going to want to leave them. (He shrugs.) What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Go with the living, Jim. The dead can wait.</p>
<p>(Sara turns and leaves.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - LAB -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Sara is at the laptop computer. She turns to her right and sees Grissom in his office looking at a book. Sofia sits on the edge of his desk and he closes the book to talk with her. She reaches out and touches the book in his hand.) </p>
<p>(Sara turns to her left and sees Warrick, Nick and Greg in the break room relaxing.)</p>
<p>(Catherine walks through the hallway and stops when she sees the guys in the break room. They're sharing a bag of popcorn between them.) </p>
<p>(Catherine smiles wistfully and sighs. She glances at her wristwatch, turns and heads back the way she came.)</p>
<p>(Cut back to: Sara also turns and glances sideways back to her right. She looks at her laptop and types in at the LEXISNEXIS TOTAL RESEARCH SYSTEM, search terms for the following:<br />
THE PEOPLE VS. LAURA SIDLE W/2<br />
MODESTO, CALIFORNIA, 1984.</p>
<p>(Camera holds on Sara.) </p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK</p>

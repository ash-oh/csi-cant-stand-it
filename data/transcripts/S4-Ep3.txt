<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>[EXT. HOME - STREET - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(A stream of liquid hits the ground. The empty can follows and hits the asphalt with a clang. TWO MEN, one carrying a crow bar, walk purposefully toward the house.)</p>
<p>[EXT. FOSTER RESIDENCE - BACKYARD - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(The two men jump over the backyard fence. They use the crowbar and pry the backdoor open.) </p>
<p>[INT. FOSTER RESIDENCE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(They walk into the house.)</p>
<p><strong>Intruder 1</strong>: Hey, this place is a dump.</p>
<p><strong>Intruder 2</strong>: I'm telling you, this bitch is loaded and no one's seen her for weeks.</p>
<p>(They walk through the passageway and into the living room. The place has been trashed.)</p>
<p><strong>Intruder 2</strong>: (alarmed) What the hell.</p>
<p><strong>Intruder 1</strong>: This place is trashed. Hey, man, you trying to make me look stupid?</p>
<p><strong>Intruder 2</strong>: No, man. I swear. Somebody must have beat us to it.</p>
<p>(Looking around the room, they see a closed closet door with a chair wedged under the knob.)</p>
<p><strong>Intruder 2</strong>: What the hell is this?</p>
<p>(Outside, there's a short, abrupt siren sound of a cop car approaching.)</p>
<p><strong>Intruder 1</strong>: I'm out, man.</p>
<p>(They both turn and head out of the house as fast as they can.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. FOSTER RESIDENCE - BACKYARD - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(The two INTRUDERS run out to the backyard, through the same way they came in. They jump over the fence. On the other side, they are greeted by two OFFICERS with their guns drawn and pointed at the two men, headlights shining straight at them. They look up and see various police cars waiting for them, blocking their escape route.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: (overhead) Gentlemen, put your hands on your heads, please.</p>
<p>(They two INTRUDERS put their hands on the back of their heads.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. FOSTER RESIDENCE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(GRISSOM examines the doorknob and the chair.) </p>
<p>(Camera pulls back to show both GRISSOM and WARRICK dusting the chair for prints. There's no telling how long they've been there, but no matter, they're thorough and are still working on the chair.)</p>
<p>(Behind them, an OFFICER stands guard watching them work.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Smudges. Nothing but smudges. Doesn't anybody use formica anymore?</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: First thing we did when we saw this was call you guys. Didn't touch a thing.</p>
<p>(WARRICK and GRISSOM continue to work on dusting the chair for prints.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: So you going to open it?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Eventually.</p>
<p>(They're through with the chair. GRISSOM looks at the door knob. Both he and WARRICK get to their feet. They each take a hold of the chair and pulls it away from the doorknob.)</p>
<p>(WARRICK puts the chair aside.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM steps forward and starts dusting the doorknob. He finds one print. He takes out a tape lift and carefully gets the print.)</p>
<p>(The OFFICER sighs and mutters to himself.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: This is going to take all day.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sun Tzu once said, &quot;If you wait by the river long enough, the bodies of your enemies will float by.&quot;</p>
<p>(He hands the tape lift with the print to WARRICK. They're ready to open the door.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM reaches out and opens the closet door.)</p>
<p>(Inside, they find the mummified figure of a dehydrated woman on the floor.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: But those were brutal times.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. FOSTER RESIDENCE - YARD -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The DAVID PHILLIPS pushes up a gurney through the yard and up the walk to the front door. He picks up his paperwork and opens the door.) </p>
<p>[INT. FOSTER RESIDENCE - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Inside, WARRICK is just beyond the door blocking it from being opened.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey, hold up.</p>
<p>(He pushes the door shut.)</p>
<p>(The mail hole opens up and DAVID peers through the opening.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Warrick?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey, David. Give me a minute and let me clear a path here, okay?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: All right, I'm not going anywhere.</p>
<p>(WARRICK picks up the mail in front of the door on the floor.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: All right.</p>
<p>(He looks down at the postage mark on the mail: LAS VEGAS / SEP 06 '03 / NV.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: There's at least four weeks of mail here, Grissom.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM is still kneeling down just inside the closet looking at the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Four weeks of 100 degree days, zero percent humidity. Eventually, the body tissues sublimate ...</p>
<p>(Quick CGI flashback to: MADELINE FOSTER is in the closet, just barely alive, just barely dead.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) ... cell fluids vaporize ...</p>
<p>(MADELINE FOSTER dies. CGI takes over and the body slowly decomposes and mummifies, the flesh hardening on her body.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) ... and all that's left ... proteins, fats and minerals.)</p>
<p>(End of CGI flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(WARRICK continues to leaf through the mail.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Turns a grape into a raisin.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, the desert was making mummies long before the Egyptians.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at the body and notices her hands. He looks up at the door and sees something.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Take a look at this. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM shines the light on the door. WARRICK moves in closer for a look. On the lower edge of the door, there are fingernail claw marks with flesh and blood smudged into the markings.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And look at her fingers. </p>
<p>(They both look down at her damaged fingertips.)</p>
<p>(Camera zooms in for a close up of the pieces of wood embedded in her broken and ravaged nail bed.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: She tried to claw her way out.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah. Which means she was alive when she was entombed.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks up and around the closet.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. FOSTER RESIDENCE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Outside, BRASS questions the INTRUDER who broke into the house.)</p>
<p><strong>Intruder 2</strong>: She was supposed to be, like, this old widow, right? Like, always going out to dinner and coming home with shopping bags. Bitch had insurance money and word was that she kept it in a box hidden under her bed.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: A retired grade-school teacher living on a pension ...</p>
<p><strong>Intruder 2</strong>: Listen, man, we didn't kill her.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (simply) No, I know that. What I want to know is, other than the back door, did you or your partner touch anything in the house?</p>
<p><strong>Intruder 2</strong>: No. There was nothing left to touch, man.</p>
<p>(BRASS nods.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - SUNRISE]</p>
<p>[INT. FOSTER RESIDENCE - KITCHEN -- MORNING] </p>
<p>(WARRICK walks around and looks through the small kitchen. He sees a small dainty tea set out on doilies on a serving tray. Next to it on the counter, he finds a piece of chocolate cake with a huge bite in it.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey, Griss. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks into the kitchen.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Don't you think this is kind of odd? A woman who spends the time making tea like this leaves a chunk of chocolate cake on the counter.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: With a big bite out of it?</p>
<p>(WARRICK picks up the plastic container. The label on it reads: LAVISH CAFÉ.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah. Some crack head brutalizes an old lady, leaves her in a closet, and grabs a snack on the way out.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hopefully. Take it back to the lab.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns and walks back into the living room. He opens the closet door, walks inside and closes the door behind him.)</p>
<p>[INT. CLOSET - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Inside the small closet, GRISSOM looks around. He looks down. He looks up. He sees the light above, reaches up and taps the bulb.)</p>
<p>(He turns off his flashlight.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [INT. CLOSET] The door opens and the WOMAN is pushed inside.)</p>
<p><strong>Madeline Foster</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p><strong>Male Voice</strong>: Shut up! Get in!</p>
<p><strong>Madeline Foster</strong>: Oh!</p>
<p>(Cut to: CLOSE UP: A chair is wedged under the door knob.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: MADELINE FOSTER reaches up and turns the closet light on.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM stands in the exact spot the woman was in when she turned the light on. He looks around the closet, then focuses on the markings on the door.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: MADELINE FOSTER struggles with the doorknob, trying to get it open. The chair won't budge. She hits her hands on the door trying to push it open; she grabs and jiggles the doorknob.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to GRISSOM. Continue sounds of MADELINE FOSTER struggling inside the closet.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM stretches out his hand and places it on the door imagining MADELINE FOSTER clawing the door with her fingernails.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: MADELINE FOSTER desperately claws at the door. She grabs at the doorknob.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to GRISSOM. Continue sounds of MADELINE FOSTER struggling inside the closet.)</p>
<p>(Quick flash of MADELINE FOSTER inside the closet struggling to get out. She slowly slides to the floor. She curls up into a fetal position on the closet floor. The light burns out. In the darkness and by the light coming through the crack under the door, MADELINE FOSTER looks up at the closet ceiling. End of flashback. Resume to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p>(Camera holds on GRISSOM.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(MADELINE FOSTER'S body is out on the autopsy table as ROBBINS goes over his findings with GRISSOM.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Fluoroscope showed no bullet or stab wounds, and apart from multiple fractures of her fingers and hands, no other apparent injuries.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So whoever boarded her up in the closet maybe didn't intend to kill her.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (shrugs) Yeah. They must have thought somebody'd find her -- a friend or relative.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: She lived alone. Only relative was a nephew. Brass is looking for him.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Live alone, die alone. In this case, from massive dehydration. Rule of threes: Three minutes without air, three days without water, and three weeks without food. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Three days must have felt like three years.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Warrick said you found a possible print at the scene. Need to rule hers out?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah. Also need a dental impression.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Well, that'll be easy.</p>
<p>(ROBBINS reaches out and removes the dentures from her mouth. He drops it into the metal bin on the side table. GRISSOM watches as ROBBINS cuts off the tip of her finger.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS COMMUNITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[EXT. TIMMEL RESIDENCE - BACKYARD -- DAY] </p>
<p>(The OFFICER leads CATHERINE out to the backyard.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, what do we have here?</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Well, boy was out playing, found the weapon, fired one shot, dropped the weapon. No one's touched it since.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hmm. </p>
<p>(She looks down at the gun on the ground.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay, thanks.</p>
<p>(The OFFICER leaves.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE puts her bag down and kneels to pick up the gun. She looks at it and checks the cartridge. She sees something red inside the trigger guard and takes it out.)</p>
<p>(Camera zooms in for a close up for the red piece.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. TIMMEL RESIDENCE - BACKYARD - DAY -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(MRS. TIMMEL holds NATHAN on her lap as CATHERINE walks over to them.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, Nathan. How's your foot?</p>
<p><strong>Nathan Timmel</strong>: I got a rocket ship band-aid.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hmm. Yeah, I see that. Mrs. Timmel, does the gun belong to someone in the house?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Timmel</strong>: No, absolutely not. My husband and I don't believe in guns. We moved here from the city because it was supposed to be safer.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Nathan, where did you find the gun?</p>
<p><strong>Nathan Timmel</strong>: Seymour found it.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Seymour?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Timmel</strong>: (whispers) His imaginary friend.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to MRS. TIMMEL) Oh. (to NATHAN) So, you were playing with Seymour, and he found the gun where?</p>
<p><strong>Nathan Timmel</strong>: (points) Over there.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, where exactly?</p>
<p><strong>Nathan Timmel</strong>: In the backyard.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Was it buried? Did you dig it up?</p>
<p><strong>Nathan Timmel</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: NATHAN walks out into the backyard and picks up the gun from the base of the tree. He points it downward ... and fires. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Will you ever play with guns again?</p>
<p><strong>Nathan Timmel</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY OUTSIDE MORGUE]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM leans against the wall as BRASS talks with him.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We don't need an I.D ...</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, the nephew said he wanted to see her. Insisted on it. Made me curious. </p>
<p>(A young man walks slowly toward them.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You Connor Foster?</p>
<p><strong>Connor Foster</strong>: Yeah. I'm sorry I'm late. I got lost. (He looks around.)<br />
This is the morgue, huh?</p>
<p>[INT. MORGUE]</p>
<p>(A small group gathers around the door to the morgue body storage unit. DAVID PHILLIPS opens the door and pulls out the table with the body on it.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You have to prepare yourself for this. Your aunt was found in an advanced state of decomposition.</p>
<p>(DAVID pulls back the sheet. CONNOR FOSTER looks at the body and turns away.)</p>
<p><strong>Connor Foster</strong>: Oh, this is messed up. This is really messed up. </p>
<p>(He turns back and glances at the body, then jumps.)</p>
<p><strong>Connor Foster</strong>: Whoa! She just moved. Did you see that? </p>
<p>(BRASS and GRISSOM glance at each other at CONNOR'S bizarre behavior.)</p>
<p><strong>Connor Foster</strong>: I'm telling you, she just moved.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Sometimes, when you see the body of someone you know, someone you've seen move before, you want them to move.</p>
<p><strong>Connor Foster</strong>: That's not her. This lady's too thin. That's not her skin, either. My aunt always wore sunblock.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Dry mouth. Diaphoresis. Red eyes, dilated pupils.</p>
<p><strong>Connor Foster</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: It means you're high.</p>
<p>(CONNOR looks at BRASS and GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Connor Foster</strong>: I got to go.</p>

<p>(BRASS and GRISSOM interview CONNOR FOSTER. CONNOR takes a sip of his drink.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Where are you living these days, Connor?</p>
<p><strong>Connor Foster</strong>: At the YMCA off industrial, near the underpass.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Nice. How's work?</p>
<p><strong>Connor Foster</strong>: I don't have a job. I used to.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah. Yeah, two years ago, your aunt reported a pearl necklace stolen. You were busted trying to hock it at a pawn shop.</p>
<p><strong>Connor Foster</strong>: She dropped those charges.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, sure. Anything for her favorite nephew. And what have you done for her? She was lying in a coat closet for over a month. You didn't call. You didn't stop by.</p>
<p><strong>Connor Foster</strong>: (interrupting) I don't call her much. We only have dinner on holidays. Whenever she sees me, it makes her kind of sad.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Do you get the munchies?</p>
<p><strong>Connor Foster</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: When you're high.</p>
<p>(When CONNOR doesn't answer, GRISSOM leans forward intently.)</p>

<p>(CATHERINE walks into the lab. RICH has his back to the door.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, Rich. </p>
<p>(RICH turns around.)</p>
<p><strong>Rich</strong>: Whatcha got for me?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Found this somewhere where it didn't belong. </p>
<p>(She takes the gun out and hands it to him.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Unregistered. No prints.</p>
<p>(He checks the gun out.)</p>
<p><strong>Rich</strong>: Huh. Sweet piece.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Rich</strong>: .32 beretta tomcat. Titanium frame, stainless steel barrel and slide. Super lightweight.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, light enough for a five year old to use.</p>
<p><strong>Rich</strong>: Ouch.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: He's okay. Thank god.</p>
<p><strong>Rich</strong>: Good. </p>
<p>(RICH walks over to the cabinet to get some bullets for the gun.) </p>
<p><strong>Rich</strong>: .32 caliber. Not many of these in circulation.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, that's a good thing.</p>
<p><strong>Rich</strong>: Potentially.</p>
<p>(He finds the bullets.)</p>
<p><strong>Rich</strong>: Okay. Here we go.</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Autopsy ruled those premortem. At least a day old. It was a close shot, non-contact, downward angle. No primer residue on the hands. T.O.D. was approximately 2:00 A.M. No one found the body until 7:00 A.M. A lot of wind ... </p>

<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Apparently bloated fingertips.</p>
<p>(GREG inks the fingertip.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Come on, you got a lot of new skills to master. Field work's a little messier than your test tubes and your GCMS.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yeah, and a lot less accurate.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: One continuous motion, nice and easy.</p>

<p><strong>Michael Kirkwood</strong>: Yeah, yeah, (He glances behind him.) I'm, uh, sorry, officers. There's been a misunderstanding. (He motions to his daughter.

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Table against the closet door, chair shoved under the knob. It is the same M.O.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Any connections between the victims?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, both victims were left alive, we think. I mean, the old lady's death was probably unintentional, and the girl's rape was ... </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Crime of opportunity?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: If you're out to rob somebody's house, why would you do it when they're home?</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Two crime scenes, two prints-- both yours.</p>

<p><strong>Frank Maddox</strong>: (on footage) Failure's not an option. It never has been. You feeling me, Terrango? You can keep on running, but I will keep coming. I will never stop.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Them's fightin' words. Did he get his man?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE turns back to the lab table. WARRICK follows her.)</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, that probably hurt business.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, yeah, it did. After that case, his recovery rate went down practically to zero.</p>
<p>(She picks up a crime scene photo and looks at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What about suicide?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No. It's a non-contact wound at a downward angle. It's a textbook murder.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Maybe too textbook. A bounty hunter would know how to fake it. Let's check out his right sleeve. Very odd. It's unbuttoned - it's pulled way down. It would explain why there weren't any prints on the gun.</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, you know all your customers this well?</p>
<p><strong>Ryan (waiter)</strong>: I try to chat up the ones that come in alone. I feel bad for<br />
'em.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So both women came in alone?</p>
<p><strong>Ryan (waiter)</strong>: Every week.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Where were you after your shift on Thursday night?</p>
<p><strong>Ryan (waiter)</strong>: Oh, uh... I was best man at my friend's wedding. The Luxor has that new wedding chapel. You get it at a discount if you use it on a weekday. I can give you a number if you ...</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (interrupts) Down, boy.</p>
<p>(RYAN stops talking.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Ryan (waiter)</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p>(RYAN picks up his tray of beer bottles and leaves.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I kind of doubt that a clean-cut guy like Ryan is hanging out with snaggletooth Steve.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No, but I'd bet somebody here was.</p>
<p>(They look around the small café at the other waiters.)</p>

[EXT. MASLOW PARK -- DAY] </p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks up to the balloon vendor. She shows him her I.D.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>Balloon Vendor</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You here every day? </p>
<p><strong>Balloon Vendor</strong>: Seven days a week, till the sun goes down. I got a wife, a kid, and 2.3 dogs to support.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Do you recognize this man?</p>
<p><strong>Balloon Vendor</strong>: Oh, yeah. He was here a few days ago. A little bigger than my average customer.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Did he buy any balloons?</p>
<p><strong>Balloon Vendor</strong>: Four big reds.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: FRANK MADDOX buys four big red balloons from the balloon vendor. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'll take what he bought.</p>
<p>(Cut to: CATHERINE sits on the wooden bench and ties the bag with the weight equivalent to the handgun to the balloons. She lets it go and the balloons easily carry the bag up into the air.)</p>
<p>(She smiles. She knows how FRANK MADDOX was killed.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(GRISSOM, WARRICK, NICK and SARA are back at the lab. SARA stands in front of the clearboard with the pen while the other stand around the lab table.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We know Jansson's partner knew the customers at the restaurant.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Education, employment history and a driver's license are required for all employees.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I've made a timeline of Steve Jansson's illustrious life span. Places he's lived, the places he's been arrested-- you know, the highlights.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You find any commonalities?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, Eric Shultz. Lives in the same neighborhood.</p>
<p>(SARA draws a connecting line from ERIC SCULTZ'S picture to &quot;RESIDENCE HISTORIES&quot;.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Jose Cortez. Worked at the Wilson Street Grill from '93 to '94.</p>
<p>(SARA draws another connecting line.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: But the busboy, Kelly James -- not only went to the same high school, but graduated from the same juvie center.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It's always nice when they come out worse than when they went in.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (to GRISSOM) What do you think? That's our guy, right?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's a connection. It's not enough to compel DNA.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So we have nothing?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No, we have a name, and we know where he works.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I'll find out where he was the night the Kirkwoods were invaded.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM'S pager beeps. He checks it.)</p>

[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(The OFFICER leads SUZANNA KIRKWOOD down the hallway.) </p>
<p>(SLOW MOTION to: SUZANNA looks up and sees another OFFICER leading a MAN in prison orange down the hall in the opposite direction toward her. The MAN in orange looks at her as they pass by.)</p>
<p>(SLOW MOTION: SUZANNA sees a mother holding a distraught daughter in her arms as she cries. She sees a MAN in a tank top and tattoos leaning against the wall talking with a MAN in a gray suit.)</p>

<p>(BRASS stands with GRISSOM, SARA and a couple of LAWYERS. He glances at his watch.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Lineup's almost ready to go. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to the LAWYERS) Listen, when she I.D.s Kelly James, we're going to need a DNA sample and an immediate hold, no bail.</p>
<p><strong>Public Defender</strong>: He's not a flight risk.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He's a risk.</p>
<p>(The OFFICER turns the corner with SUZANNA. They join the group.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey, Suzanna. </p>
<p>(Everyone is suddenly aware of her and the conversation stops. BRASS looks down and glances over at SARA. GRISSOM glances at SARA. SARA looks back at GRISSOM and their eyes meet. SARA turns to SUZANNA.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Um, why don't we go hang out until they're ready for us? We'll get a glass of water or something.</p>
<p>(SARA leads SUZANNA away from the group.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - WAITING ROOM - DAY -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(SARA and SUZANNA sit on the waiting room seats.)</p>

<p>(SUZANNA'S quiet as she stares at the air in front of her.)</p>
<p><strong>Suzanna Kirkwood</strong>: (softly) Do you ... you want to hear something stupid?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>Suzanna Kirkwood</strong>: My boyfriend and I had been talking about having s*x for a of couple months. I always said no because I was afraid that my parents would find out.</p>
<p>(SARA doesn't say anything.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY - DAY -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(MICHAEL KIRKWOOD sits in the hallway chair. GRISSOM turns the corner and walks toward him.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mr. Kirkwood, I'm sorry. The other day, I thought you were saying that you &quot;wouldn't&quot; help me, and now I realize that you 'couldn't'.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Kirkwood</strong>: (shakes his head) I never got a good look at them.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM nods.)</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I already cleared it with the Public Defender.</p>
<p>(SARA looks at SUZANNA.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY - DAY -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(GRISSOM sits down next to MICHAEL KIRKWOOD and listens.) </p>
<p><strong>Michael Kirkwood</strong>: She's 16. I only had two jobs left -- teach her to think for herself, keep her safe. I got one right.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(Camera opens on SUZANNA who is having a difficult time with this. BRASS instructs her on the process.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Here's how this works: There are five guys in a line. We're going to ask each of them to step forward, turn to the side, and then face forward again.<br />
(SUZANNA nods.) Now, if you want a second look or you need more time, just let us know. When you're ready to make a decision, write it down on this piece of paper. (BRASS hands her a piece of paper.) Remember, you can see them, but they can't see you. Okay?</p>
<p>(SUZANNA nods. She looks through the window to the other side of the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Suzanna Kirkwood</strong>: He already knows it's me.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Suzanna, you can do this. I know you can.</p>
<p>(SUZANNA shakes her head ... then gathers her courage and nods.)</p>
<p><strong>Suzanna Kirkwood</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(BRASS and SARA take a step back.)</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: (over intercom) Number one, please step forward. </p>
<p>(The first MAN steps forward into the light.)</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: (over intercom) Turn to the left. Step back. </p>
<p>(He turns to the side, then steps back into the shadows.)</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: (over intercom) Number two, step forward. Turn to your left.</p>
<p>(The second man steps forward into the light.)</p>
<p><strong>Michael Kirkwood</strong>: (V.O.) You know, people say ... </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY - DAY -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p><strong>Michael Kirkwood</strong>: ... you never forget. Truth is... you do forget. And then you remember. It makes it worse. It was like, uh, it's like my brain ... doesn't know where to put it.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The door bursts open and the two men enter the house. One of them grabs the woman walking toward the door. He pushes her back into the hallway as she struggles and screams.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: The two men push MICHAEL KIRKWOOD, hands tied behind his back, into the closet with LINDA KIRKWOOD. Sounds of crying and pleading in the background, echoing in his mind.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Michael Kirkwood</strong>: You know, it must've run through a million times in my mind ... somebody breaks in. I get a baseball bat. Get everybody out the back door. Call the cops. My family's safe. And I just stood there ...</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(SUZANNA stands in front of the window, visibly shaking at the ordeal. The voice over the intercom calls for the next man to step forward.)</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: (over intercom) Number four, step forward.</p>
<p>(He steps forward into the light.)</p>
<p>(Camera refocuses from SUZANNA'S reflection to the man standing beyond it. It's him. It's KELLY JAMES.)</p>
<p>(At the sight of him, SUZANNA is frozen, trapped in her memories.)</p>
<p>(Both BRASS and SARA can tell by her reaction that this is the MAN, yet they can't say anything.)</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: (over intercom) Turn to your left.</p>
<p>(The MAN turns to face the left.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback of: The two men assaulting SUZANNA. Cut to: Her parents tied and trapped in the closet as they hear her screams.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>

<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY - DAY -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(MICHAEL KIRKWOOD talks and GRISSOM listens.)</p>
<p><strong>Michael Kirkwood</strong>: And when Suzanna was a little girl, Linda made me put those, um, the child-proof locks on all the kitchen cabinets. I complained. You know what she said to me? She said, uh, &quot;The least we can do is make her safe in her own house.&quot;</p>
<p>(MICHAEL KIRKWOOD looks down at his hands. GRISSOM'S heart goes out to the man.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mr. Kirkwood ... you didn't do anything wrong.</p>
<p>(MICHAEL KIRKWOOD sighs.)</p>
<p>(SUZANNA steps out stiffly into the hallway and walks toward her father. He gets to his feet and catches her as she cries.)</p>
<p><strong>Michael Kirkwood</strong>: (whispers) Baby.</p>
<p>(He kisses her forehead and leads her aside.)</p>
<p><strong>Michael Kirkwood</strong>: Oh, it's okay, it's okay. Shh.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM gets to his feet as SARA and BRASS turn the corner, his eyes on the KIRKWOODS. GRISSOM turns around as SARA and BRASS reach him.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: She froze up. She couldn't do it.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Her reaction should be enough.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to BRASS) What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (sighs) Well, we've got enough to hold this Jansson kid, but the other guy ... unless she writes a number down, there's nothing we can do.</p>
<p>(SARA looks at GRISSOM and they share a look. SARA looks down while GRISSOM turns to look back at the KIRKWOODS.)</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, he'll be back. We'll get him eventually.</p>

<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. TIMMEL RESIDENCE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(CATHERINE and WARRICK walk through the park as she explains her theory about the death and the gun.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Frank Maddox - bad-ass bounty hunter on his way down. Loses his rep, loses his edge ... </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Loses his manhood. Guess he thought he had nothing left to live for.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Except maybe one thing: Going out with his boots on. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [EXT. MASLOW PARK - NIGHT] FRANK MADDOX sits on the park bench and sets up the gun with the balloons.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) He picks a known hot spot, and waits until it gets dark. </p>
<p>(He stands up and points the gun to the back of his head ... )</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) Angles the gun down...</p>
<p>(... and fires. He falls to the ground, releasing his hold on the gun and the balloons.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) ... and the balloons make it look like murder.</p>
<p>(The balloons carry the gun up.)</p>
<p>(Different angle on the balloons rising and the dead body on the ground.) </p>
<p>(Various angles of the balloons carrying the gun up.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (V.O.) On a windy night, a balloon can go for miles.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Until ... </p>
<p>(CATHERINE lifts up her glasses and looks closely at the tree where she sees the red rubber of the burst balloon.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The weight of the gun pulls the worn balloons down into the tree where it bursts on the branches. The gun falls to the ground.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: NATHAN TIMMEL walks into the back yard and picks up the gun. He looks at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Cue Sound</strong>: GUNSHOT.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>

<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - GRISSOM'S OFFICE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM sits at his desk reading and listening to Classical music on the player.)</p>
<p>(Outside, we see BRASS walk through the hallway and stop just outside GRISSOM'S office door. He looks grimly at GRISSOM when he raises his head to look at him.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Get your kit.</p>
<p>(Without waiting for a response, BRASS walks away. GRISSOM pauses for a moment.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. KIRKWOOD RESIDENCE - FRONT WALK -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>GRISSOM and BRASS walk up to the crime scene. The OFFICERS there hold the crime scene tape up for them to walk under.</p>
<p>As they approach the body on the sidewalk, the CORONERS push a gurney past them. On the other side of the crime scene tape standing in the front walk of the house are the KIRKWOODS. SARA stands next to them.</p>
<p>The gurney passes by and GRISSOM sees SUZANNA KIRKWOOD lying in a pool of blood. GRISSOM stares at the body.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he looks up and sees MICHAEL KIRKWOOD with his arms around his wife, LINDA -- both staring at their daughter's body.</p>
<p>He shifts his gaze slightly and looks directly at SARA Their eyes meet and hold. There are just no words for this. Her tear-filled gaze breaks contact and shifts downward to SUZANNA on the ground between them.</p>
<p>ANGLE ON: Camera moves slowly across a top view of the entire scene ... from the KIRKWOODS and SARA ... to SUZANNA ... to the OFFICERS working on the crime scene ... to GRISSOM standing unmoving next to his kit ... to the crowd gathering just beyond the crime scene tape.</p>
<p>This is not just another crime scene.</p>
<p>Suddenly, SARA moves. She lifts up the crime scene tape and enters the crime scene with her kit. However, without looking up, she walks by the body as BRASS watches her.</p>
<p>GRISSOM looks down at SUZANNA. He kneels down next to her and begins to put on this gloves to get to work.</p>
<p>The KIRKWOODS stand aside and watch.</p>
<p>SARA sits quietly in the car, tears falling from her eyes as she watches the scene in front of her and </p>
<p>SUZANNA on the ground.</p>
<p>GRISSOM puts on his gloves.</p>
<p>Camera holds on GRISSOM.</p>

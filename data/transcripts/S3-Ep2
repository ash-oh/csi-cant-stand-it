<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH:</p>
<p>[INT. CASINO -- THE WALLFLOWERS - PERFORMANCE]</p>
<p><strong>Lyric</strong>: [&quot;Everybody Out of The Water&quot;, performed by The Wallflowers]<br />
... on your mark, get set / let's go / you got to move now, before she explodes / look out the window, lookout below / back away from the glass / well, there she blows / the city's been leveled / the hills are in flames / the streets cracked open / and they're pushing up clay / temperature's dropped / the sky is gray / and it ain't even over / here comes drivin' rain / it ain't me that you feel / it's something moving around in here / well, that's blood, that's tears / this ain't a warning / everybody out of the water... </p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
<strong>Lyric</strong>: and up on dry land / take what you can / cuz you won't be here again / everybody out of the water ...</p>
<p>[INT. PALMS HOTEL &amp; CASINO - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(A group of young women walk through the casino's lobby to enter the performance area. The camera runs in slow motion. They're dressed up for a night out on the town.)</p>
<p>(Cut to TOM HAVILAND shooting craps at the crap table. He's surrounded by a group of people and having a wonderful time.)</p>
<p>(Cut to one of the young women from the group walking through the crowd with her friends. She looks up and sees TOM HAVILAND at the crap table.)</p>
<p><strong>Fan (woman)</strong>: Tom Haviland! Oh, my god. It's really him. I loved him in &quot;I-<br />
95&quot; and ... and that other movie with Julia Roberts.</p>
<p>(Cut to the crap table. TOM HAVILAND holds the dice. He blows on the dice and prepares to set his bet.)</p>
<p><strong>Tom Haviland</strong>: Odds on six and eight. Give me thirty-five on the hop and a quarter on the horn for the boys.</p>
<p><strong>House</strong>: Thank you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Haviland</strong>: All right.</p>
<p>(TOM HAVILAND shakes the dice, blows on it and lets it go. In slow motion, the dice roll across the crap table, hits the back board and rolls back to where it finally stops on a three and a five.)</p>
<p><strong>Lyric</strong>: ...Now I'm treadin' high water / to get back to you / looking for a little spot of something to cling to / there's too many bodies / there's not enough room /<br />
God help me and God help you ...</p>
<p>(The table crowd lets out a loud cheer.)</p>
<p><strong>Lyric</strong>: ...they say nobody panic / help is on its way, we're already on it / you've got to be brave / if you can fix it now then don't make us wait / man they're ain't nobody coming / back away from the gates ... </p>
<p>(RAYMOND LESTER walks up to TOM HAVILAND.)</p>
<p><strong>Tom Haviland</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Raymond Lester</strong>: How you doing? So what are you in the mood for, huh? A little French, Italian ...</p>
<p><strong>Tom Haviland</strong>: No, man, I had Italian last night. How about Chinese?</p>
<p>(TOM HAVILAND has his eyes somewhere across the crap table. RAYMOND LESTER follows his gaze and smiles.)</p>
<p><strong>Raymond Lester</strong>: Oh yeah, Chinese. Hey, man. I've got you.</p>
<p>(RAYMOND LESTER leaves. TOM HAVILAND continues with his game. He blows on the dice and lets it roll. It stops on two fives. The table crowd goes wild.)</p>
<p>(Across the table, RAYMOND LESTER approaches two Chinese-looking women. He puts his arms around their shoulders and speaks to them. They both smile.)</p>
<p><strong>Lyric</strong>: Everybody out of the water / get up on dry land / take what you can / 'cause you won't be here again / well, I loved you then / like I love you now / that won't matter anyhow / well, this is the new frontier / everybody out of the water ...</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. PALMS HOTEL &amp; CASINO -- BEDROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(TOM HAVILAND and the two women from the Casino walk down the sunken bedroom floor to the large bed in the center of the room. They slowly discard their clothing as they reach the bed.)</p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH:</p>
<p>[THE WALLFLOWERS PERFORMANCE]</p>
<p>(The woman in the red dress falls back on the bed. TOM HAVILAND straddles her and the other woman in black straddles her behind him.)</p>
<p>(Camera close up of the women touching and caressing TOM HAVILAND. Camera close up of TOM HAVILAND in slow motion. Music fades. Slow deep breathing sounds louder.)</p>
<p><strong>Lyric</strong>: ... everybody out of the water ...</p>
<p>FLASH TO WHITE:</p>
<hr />
[INT. PALMS HOTEL &amp; CASINO -- BEDROOM -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM is carrying his CSI kit and walking down the short steps to the sunken bedroom. He approaches the bed. BRASS is already there. He turns his cell phone off.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The subject, Tom Haviland, says he had a romp with two ladies between<br />
1:00 am and 2:00 am. Then he left them in the sheets and went back to the crap table. He returned a half an hour later and found Kim like this with her throat slashed.</p>
<p>(Sprawled out on the bloodied bed is the woman in black. GRISSOM crouches low next to the bed. He shines the light from his flashlight on the victim's neck.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The extent of the coagulation suggests she died before that. Possibly before 1:00 am.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: When he puts himself in the room.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You said &quot;ladies.&quot; Where's the other one?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Uh ... Tonya. He said she was gone when he returned.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Gone? That's an elastic term.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, Mr. Haviland's assistant a Raymond Lester, notified hotel security and called 9-1-1.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What do we know about Raymond?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Eyewitnesses place him downstairs at the time this took place. Mr. Lester is in ... LA at a morning meeting. He's flying back this evening.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And Mr. Haviland?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: He's in the other room.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. PALMS HOTEL &amp; CASINO - ROOM NEXT TO BEDROOM]</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: (o.s.) Do you do your own stunts?</p>
<p>(TOM HAVILAND holds a stock publicity photograph and signs it. Surrounding him are three men talking with the movie star.)</p>
<p><strong>Tom Haviland</strong>: Yeah, I do my own stunts, but, look, I don't want to dog on the guys who use stunt doubles, right? Believe me, when you're hand gliding over the Grand Canyon, you should think twice.</p>
<p>(The man laughs at the response.)</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: (o.s.) I've always wanted to try that. Would you mind making it out to my girlfriend please ...</p>
<p>(The camera pulls back. Off to the side some distance away, WARRICK and GRISSOM watch. GRISSOM puts his glasses on and watches with no expression on his face. WARRICK turns from watching TOM HAVILAND and looks at GRISSOM'S non-expression.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You don't recognize that guy, do you? It's Tom Haviland, movie star.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM nods slightly.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Clark Gable was a movie star.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM approaches the group.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Excuse me, fellas.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Haviland</strong>: Keep the peace, boys.</p>
<p>(The mini-crowd leaves.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mr. Haviland, my name's Gil Grissom. I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Haviland</strong>: (smiles) Oh, well, do you have a sheet of paper? 'Cause I'm kind of running out of things to write on here. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Tom Haviland</strong>: Oh. My bad.</p>
<p>(TOM HAVILAND looks down and re-caps the pen in his hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I need to ask you did you, by any chance, touch the victim after you found her?</p>
<p><strong>Tom Haviland</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>Tom Haviland</strong>: Look, I wouldn't want people to know, but I got creeped out. I kept my distance waiting for the ambulance.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's all you did?</p>
<p><strong>Tom Haviland</strong>: Well, I did ask her who did it. And she said Tonya.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Really? The other girl.</p>
<p>(TOM HAVILAND nods.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hey, Warrick?</p>
<p>(WARRICK, standing off to the side, walks toward the two men.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Would you mind if we took a look at your hands?</p>
<p><strong>Tom Haviland</strong>: Yeah, sure.</p>
<p>(TOM HAVILAND holds both his hands out palms up.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Palms down, please. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns on his flashlight and shines it on TOM HAVILAND'S fingernails. WARRICK shifts slightly as he knows what GRISSOM is looking for.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You said you never touched the victim.</p>
<p>(TOM HAVILAND shakes his head. No. WARRICK uses a swab on TOM HAVILAND'S cuticles. Camera close up on the swab as it picks up a dark residue under the nailbeds. WARRICK looks at the swab tip.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It's blood. I guess you forgot to scrub the back of your hands, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Tom Haviland</strong>: I get one phone call, right?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sure, just like in the movies.</p>

[INT. PALMS HOTEL &amp; CASINO - LOBBY -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Camera view in slow motion. TOM HAVILAND, handcuffed behind his back and escorted by BRASS, GRISSOM, WARRICK and an officer, walk through the hallway. They turn the corner and just outside the glass doors in the center of the casino lobby is a large group of reporters intermixed with fans and curious onlookers.)</p>
<p>(Normal camera speed resumes when the security officers open the glass doors. The crowd pushes against the group of officers there to provide security.)</p>
<p><strong>Reporter</strong>: Tom, did you do it?</p>
<p><strong>Reporter</strong>: Tom! Tom!</p>
<p><strong>Fan (male)</strong>: You're the best, Tom. Stay strong.</p>
<p><strong>Reporter 1 (woman)</strong>: Captain, can you tell us exactly what prompted PD to arrest Tom for this murder?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Conflicting statements and forensic evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Reporter 2 (man)</strong>: Could you be more specific?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Blood evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Reporter 3 (man)</strong>: What kind? Where did you find it, exactly?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: That's all for now. When we have more information, we'll release it to you. Thank you excuse us.</p>
<p>(BRASS with TOM HAVILAND push onward through the casino lobby. The reporters follow in their wake shouting their questions at the men. WARRICK and GRISSOM remain behind then turn to move to the side.)</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I like his movies. (she shrugs) Some of them are good.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM has a thoughtful look on his face. CATHERINE pulls the phone away from her ear and puts it away.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: DA just got the call. Tom's manager hired Marjorie Wescott to defend him.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM considers the news.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: &quot;Soundbite&quot; Wescott?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Guilty, rich client, high-profile case it's right up her alley. Publicity for her new cable show.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Forget about who's involved. We do this like we do any other case.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, I'm going to get this blood evidence to DNA. I'll catch up with you guys later.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: All right.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Witnesses place Tom Haviland at this table before and after the time of the murder.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I'll look for transfers.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, well, he's already admitting to sleeping with the victim so hair and fiber evidence won't mean anything.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(NICK ducks under the crime scene tape, turns and holds it up for GRISSOM. GRISSOM doesn't move.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You coming?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm just going to supervise on this one.</p>

<p><strong>Hank Peddigrew</strong>: I need to talk to you.</p>
<p>(SARA snaps a photo.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Uh ... can it wait till after work?</p>
<p><strong>Hank Peddigrew</strong>: It's about work. When I tried to revive the victim the bra was in the way, so I repositioned it. I didn't think about it until I was at the elevator.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Oh, um ... can you tell me where it was exactly?</p>
<p><strong>Hank Peddigrew</strong>: A little ... a little over here.</p>
<p>(HANK PEDDIGREW points a little to the right of the bra. SARA moves the bra.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p>(He nods.)</p>
<p><strong>Hank Peddigrew</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Thanks? Thanks nothing. I'm going to have to put it in my report.<br />
&quot;Evidence moved due to life-saving efforts&quot; with before and after pictures.</p>
<p><strong>Hank Peddigrew</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p>(SARA smiles. HANK PEDDIGREW leaves. SARA lifts the camera to take another picture. CATHERINE enters the bedroom.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I could live in that bathroom. So, I've checked every plumbing fixture in this place. There's no blood.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE rests her kit down and crouches next to SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Grissom said he found blood under movie boy's nailbeds.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, let's see. Hotel suite. Probably a weapon of opportunity. Corkscrew, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Corkscrew would be consistent with this tissue damage.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Is it all the way down to the larynx?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Transected the superior thyroid artery external carotid, causing exsanguination. Both laryngeal branches of the vagus nerve and her larynx were severed. Vagus nerve controls the muscles in the larynx. Any injury to this nerve and its surrounding muscle results in immediate paralysis of the throat.</p>

We'll recap the story as we wait for a live feed from a downtown news conference with Haviland's attorney. Several witnesses have already spoken to police about Haviland's actions outside the murder ...</p>

<p>(Quick flashback to the hotel bedroom. A woman is screaming. TOM HAVILAND swings his hand and the woman's screaming stops. She falls back against the bed. Flash to white.

<p>(Quick flash back to TOM HAVILAND standing in front of the sink. Flashback is green-tinged to show that it was done without the light on and in darkness. Sounds of water running can be heard. TOM HAVILAND washes his hands and his chest from the blood. He glances behind him. White flash to camera view of TOM HAVILAND'S bare feet.)</p>

<p>(GREG walks in holding the test results. He hands them to GRISSOM and gives his report.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I got it right here. The forensic sample matches the reference. The blood on Tom's hands was definitely the victim's. Triple-checked the data.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We got our guy then.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Oh, here she is.</p>

I'm holding in my hand compromised, contaminated evidence, ladies and gentlemen. </p>

<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I'm only done processing half the evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You're going to have to call in help, because if the judge thinks that our evidence isn't strong enough to go to trial he's going to dismiss the charges on Tom.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Can't the DA drop the charges and we'll refile when we get our evidence together?</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hey. What happened to you? You were a pioneer in forensic science. How many bad guys did you put away in Hennepin County?</p>
<p><strong>Phillip Gerard</strong>: My share. How many innocent men have been locked away since then because of sloppy investigating shortcut forensics?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You look for mistakes in any lab you'll find them.</p>
<p><strong>Phillip Gerard</strong>: I shouldn't be able to, Gil.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Humans are fallible.</p>
<p><strong>Phillip Gerard</strong>: Not this fallible -- compromised blood, sweetheart deals ...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No, no, no, no. You're subverting good evidence. These are good people. </p>
<p><strong>Phillip Gerard</strong>: &quot;The Accused is entitled to the best defense possible.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The Accused is entitled, yeah. He's a movie star, that's why he's entitled. He's killed two women. You know it. But you're willing to decimate these CSIs so that you can spoon-feed a jury into letting him walk.</p>
<p><strong>Phillip Gerard</strong>: A jury believes me because of my reputation just like they do you.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The difference is, Philip, I get the same paycheck regardless of what I testify to.</p>
<p>(PHILLIP GERARD sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Phillip Gerard</strong>: I'm saying this as a friend. For the reputation of CSI, tell the DA to drop this, re-file down the road.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM nods at his former mentor, truly seeing him for the first time.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What about the victims' families? Who's their friend? </p>
<p>(PHILLIP GERARD doesn't respond.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: My guys will see you in court.</p>

<p>(GREG looks up from the test results on the table back into the microscope. He picks up the paper and heads out the door. He crosses the hallway and heads straight for GRISSOM'S office where GRISSOM sits behind his desk.)</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - GRISSOM'S OFFICE - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Psst, Grissom. (speaking quietly): We got a development. I went over those swatches that Sara gave me from the bed sheet.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Are you whispering?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I don't want that Gerard guy to hear me.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, he's not here, so stop it.</p>
<p>(SARA appears next to GRISSOM'S desk. She looks from GREG to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What's, uh, going on?</p>
<p>(GREG straightens.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, um ... I was testing those swatches that Sara gave me, and three of the swatches came up Kim. The other four, with the spatter amelogenin results are XY.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Blood's from a male?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Tom Haviland's.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: No. And not his friend Ray's, either.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: There was another guy in that room. That's, that's great. The defense has us moving so fast we can't make sense of our own evidence.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM holds up a hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's what they want.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Should we call the DA and let him know?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Tell him what? That we might have found a motive for the movie star?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Motive. What are you talking about?</p>
<p>(Before GRISSOM can respond, NICK interrupts from the doorway.)</p>

<p>(The camera pans back giving a top view of the scene. BRASS, GRISSOM and PHILLIP GERARD observe from the side.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Did, uh, Tom Haviland ever play a boxer? Girl's face looks like hamburger meat.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Looks like uncontrollable rage to me.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Grissom, you might want to come down here.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM doesn't move from the side.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Just say it, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Beans and franks. Tonya's a man.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Looks like that old Hollywood saying: &quot;Never get caught with a dead girl or a live boy.&quot; So, let's see Tom's in bed with what he thinks are two girls. He reaches down on one, becomes very confused. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to the hotel bedroom. TOM HAVILAND kissing the woman in red. His hand moves on the woman's body. TOM HAVILAND looks up, confused. White flash to end of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Most guys would have just cleared the room and gargled with whiskey. But movie boy, who brags about doing his own stunts, couldn't take the thought of having a man in his bed so he freaked out.</p>
<p>(Quick Flashback to hotel bedroom. Sounds of a man throwing punches. TOM HAVILAND striking the woman in red on the bed, his chest spattered with blood. Flash to white as TOM HAVILAND doesn't stop and continues to throw punches in fast forward. White flash to end of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM glances over at PHILLIP GERARD.)</p>
<p><strong>Phillip Gerard</strong>: I'm just here to observe CSI's investigating techniques.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, Nick is the Primary on this.</p>
<p><strong>Phillip Gerard</strong>: You're not running evidence. Or have you changed your mind? </p>
<p>(GRISSOM doesn't respond.)</p>
<p><strong>Phillip Gerard</strong>: By the way, tell your mother I say 'Hello' next time you talk. I was so impressed that night we all had dinner. The sign language ... how you interpreted for her. Fluid, didn't miss a beat.</p>
<p>(Somehow, this doesn't surprise GRISSOM; it only annoys him.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What'd you do, subpoena my doctor?</p>
<p><strong>Phillip Gerard</strong>: Knowing your genetic predisposition for hearing loss?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You've become a bottom feeder, Philip.</p>
<p><strong>Phillip Gerard</strong>: Your work is dependent upon your five senses. The fact that you're losing one of yours wouldn't bode well for any evidence you introduced.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You know, all those years I worked for you, you never got to know me at all, did you?</p>

<p>(SARA appears. She folds her arms against her chest and leans against the doorway behind GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I've looked at everything in that hotel room. Nothing matches that pattern.</p>
<p>(Without looking up at her, GRISSOM responds.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What about the booking photos of Tom? Were you able to make comparisons off those?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I told Brass that I needed them; he hasn't sent me anything yet. </p>

<p>(Extreme camera close up of MARJORIE WESCOTT'S lips as she speaks. Now, though we can just barely make out the words as she says them, we definitely know what she's asking. GRISSOM has the question and answers it confidently.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: On visual comparison.</p>
<p>(Camera immediately cuts to PHILLIP GERARD.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The Accused has a distinct waffle-like scar characterized by diamond-shaped patterns on his left knee.</p>
<p>(On the courtroom monitor, the photograph from &quot;The National Informer&quot; appears on screen. TOM HAVILAND and an unknown dark-haired woman are sitting on the beach. TOM HAVILAND'S knee is bent exposing an injury. The monitor does a close up on TOM HAVILAND'S scar.)</p>
<p><strong>Marjorie Wescott</strong>: So, Tom has a scar on his leg. Whoop-de-do. There's no forensic database for scars. It's not a discipline.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yes, but it's unique to The Accused. He says he got it in a stunt on his last film. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM picks up TOM HAVILAND'S statement from the file in front of him.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: According to Mr. Haviland in his statement and I quote, &quot;It happened when I was rappelling down the Alps firing an AK-47 with my free hand.&quot;</p>
<p>(A soft rumble of laughter ripples through the courtroom's audience. NICK and CATHERINE both smile and laugh softly.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: But he actually got it tripping on his way into the wardrobe trailer.</p>
<p><strong>Marjorie Wescott</strong>: Objection. There's no question to the witness here, your honor.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Your honor, it's a preliminary hearing. May I?</p>
<p><strong>Judge Peter Croft</strong>: The witness may proceed.</p>
<p>(MARJORIE WESCOTT sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The production report by the Unit Production Manager on the film that day and I quote, &quot;Tom Haviland slipped on wardrobe trailer number thirty-eight, step number two. He sustained cuts to his knee and was bandaged by the company medic. The production was shut down for half a day.&quot; The company medic documented it with Polaroid photos and I have managed to acquire step number two ... from trailer thirty-eight. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM clicks on the laptop keyboard.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I think these graphics will help explain my findings.</p>
<p>(On the courtroom monitor, an extreme close up of the trailer step pattern appears on screen.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The Step.</p>
<p>(The full screen image of the trailer step reduces to half-size on the left of the screen with the image of the scar pattern of TOM HAVILAND'S knee appearing on the right half of the monitor.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The Scar.</p>
<p>(The image of the scar pattern is watermarked and layered over the image of the trailer step on the right. Digital identifiers appear on screen and mark the matching points on both scar and trailer step. It's a perfect match.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The Sheet.</p>
<p>(The blood pattern found on the bloodied bed sheet appears on the right half of the screen. The image of the blood pattern is watermarked and superimposed over the pre-existing image of the trailer step and scar pattern. Digital identifiers appear on screen and mark additional matching points on the cumulative image. There's no denying the evidence. From trailer step to The Accused's scar to the bloodied sheet. It's a perfect match.)</p>
<p>(PHILLIP GERARD looks at the evidence on the monitor. He blinks and raises his head slightly. JUDGE PETER CROFT glances from the monitor to the defense. MARJORIE WESCOTT turns away from the monitor and looks back at the defense table. TOM HAVILAND swallows. Camera cuts to NICK who looks very pleased with the evidence.)</p>
<p><strong>Marjorie Wescott</strong>: No further questions, your honor.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Peter Croft</strong>: You may be excused, Dr. Grissom.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM closes the file folder in front of him and stands. He picks up the folder and leaves the stand. The camera follows him as he makes his way through the courtroom. In the background, court proceeds.)</p>
<p><strong>Judge Peter Croft</strong>: (o.s.) I'm binding this case over for trial sixty days from today.</p>
<p><strong>Marjorie Wescott</strong>: (o.s.) We'd like a continuance, your honor.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Peter Croft</strong>: (o.s.) I'll take it under submission.</p>
<p>(As GRISSOM passes the defense table, PHILLIP GERARD stops him.)</p>
<p><strong>Phillip Gerard</strong>: Gil ... good work.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: My Team did it, Philip. I got good CSI's.</p>
<p>(As he smiles and speaks, GRISSOM signs the following to PHILLIP GERARD.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Oh, and, uh, my mother says hello.</p>
<p>(Without a backward glance to his former mentor, GRISSOM looks forward at and proceeds toward his CSI Team sitting in their seats waiting for him. They all stand and quietly slip into the aisle behind him as he walks past them. All of them leaving the courtroom together. In the background, the proceedings continue.)</p>
<p><strong>Judge Peter Croft</strong>: (o.s.) Bailiff?</p>
<p><strong>Marjorie Wescott</strong>: (o.s.) I'd like to make a motion for a bail hearing, your honor.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Peter Croft</strong>: (o.s.) It's a double murder, Counselor. Request for bail is denied. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM and the CSI Team pause at the doorway. They turn around to look back at the courtroom just in time to hear the JUDGE and to see the Bailiff preparing to handcuff The Accused.)</p>
<p><strong>Judge Peter Croft</strong>: The Accused is remanded into custody of county jail.</p>
<p>(The gavel sounds the JUDGE'S decision with finality. The CSI Team smiles and one after another they proudly exit the courtroom together. With a smile on his face, GRISSOM follows them out.)</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>
<p><strong>End</strong></p>

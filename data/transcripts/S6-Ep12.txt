<p>[INT. VARIOUS DANCE CLUB - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(People in a dance club party, the music blaring.)</p>
<p>(Two girls and a guy hurry into one of the rooms.)</p>
<p>(In one of the darkened private rooms, a man and a woman are in bed.) </p>
<p>[INT. DESMOND RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Bianca Desmond enters the bedroom. Chelsea Wannamaker is in bed sleeping. Bianca climbs into bed with Chelsea and lies down, staring at her. She brushes the hair from her face, waking her.) </p>
<p><strong>Chelsea Wannamaker</strong>: Hey, lady. Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Bianca Desmond</strong>: I can't sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Chelsea Wannamaker</strong>: You want to try to eat something?</p>
<p><strong>Bianca Desmond</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Chelsea Wannamaker</strong>: All right. I'll go get Ahren. You get dressed.</p>
<p>(Chelsea climbs out of bed. She picks up her robe and puts it on.) </p>
<p><strong>Chelsea Wannamaker</strong>: Ahren?</p>
<p>(She heads out of the bedroom.) </p>
<p>[INT. DESMOND RESIDENCE - STAIRS / GARAGE - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Chelsea goes down the stairs.) </p>
<p><strong>Chelsea Wannamaker</strong>: Ahren?</p>
<p>(She walks through the house looking for Ahren.) </p>
<p><strong>Chelsea Wannamaker</strong>: Ahren?</p>
<p>(She heads for the garage. She opens the garage door and gasps.) </p>
<p><strong>Chelsea Wannamaker</strong>: Ahren...</p>
<p>(She finds Ahren dead in the center of the floor in a large pool of blood. She goes down the garage steps.) </p>
<p><strong>Chelsea Wannamaker</strong>: (gasps) Ahren ... Ahren ...</p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
[INT. DESMOND RESIDENCE - GARAGE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(David Phillips is in the garage with the body. Brass stands near the tape just outside the open garage door. He holds up the tape as Grissom and Warrick both duck into the garage.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Okay, Ahren Green, 29 years old, lives here with Bianca Desmond, that's the brunette. The blonde is Chelsea Wannamaker. She was just spending the night. One was asleep, one was in the bathroom. They said Ahren was probably working on his bike.</p>
<p>(Warrick snaps photos of the body - the blood on his hands, the blood near his groin, the body's face.) </p>
<p>(David checks the body's pupils.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: His pupils are dilated. Lividity is consistent with body position. Looks like he bled out from a stab wound to his upper leg or pelvic area.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, in my experience, I found that most threesomes end up being one too many. So, David, uh ... check and make sure that they didn't pull a Lorena Bobbitt. </p>
<p>(David glances at Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Take a look.</p>
<p>(David pulls the pants waist up and sticks his hand inside to check.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: No, we're good. My man's all there. We're ... good.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Something must be wrong with his gear. He could be partying with two hot chicks inside, but he's out here working on his bike at 4:00 in the morning?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Maybe he wasn't invited.</p>

<p>[INT. DESMOND RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hold out your hands, please?</p>
<p>(Sara shines the ALS on Bianca's hands while Brass watches. There are splotches all over the back of her hands.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: And the other side.</p>
<p>(Bianca flips her hands over to show the splotches on the palms as well. Sara removes her goggles.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What were you doing right before Ahren was killed?</p>
<p><strong>Bianca Desmond</strong>: Cleaning.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: With what?</p>
<p><strong>Bianca Desmond</strong>: Bleach. It's the only thing that works.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know, you could put some clothes on if you want, if you're cold.</p>
<p><strong>Bianca Desmond</strong>: She won't let me back in my room.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. DESMOND RESIDENCE - GARAGE - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Warrick snaps photos of the tools on the work area.) </p>
<p>(Grissom examines the scratches on the concrete floor.) </p>
<p>(Warrick continues to snap photos of the tools.) </p>
<p>(Grissom takes a tape lift of the particles in the gouges.)</p>
<p>(Camera zooms in to show the particles lifting off the concrete and sticking onto the tape.) </p>
<p>(Grissom presses the tape lift closed.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Man, I give this guy an &quot;A&quot; for organization. He's got a spot for everything. Why is that helmet over there?</p>
<p>(He points to the helmet on the floor.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Maybe he threw it, defending himself.</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: The attacker flips open a knife and fights with Ahren Green. The attacker stabs Ahren in the upper leg. End of flash.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, but he looked like he was in pretty good shape. It'd be kind of hard for one of those women to wrestle him down.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Not if she walks softly and carried a big knife.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. DESMOND RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Brass questions Bianca Desmond: </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: How long have you known Ahren?</p>
<p><strong>Bianca Desmond</strong>: Six months.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Did, uh, did he have any enemies that you know of?</p>
<p><strong>Bianca Desmond</strong>: No, I mean ... I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You don't know ... I mean, you two lived together right?</p>
<p><strong>Bianca Desmond</strong>: Yeah, but we were still getting to know each other.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>Bianca Desmond</strong>: We met one night at Light. He was in town for a motocross race. It was love at first sight. I asked him to come back here, and he never left. We actually just decided tonight to move to Colorado together.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What, just pick up and leave all this?</p>
<p><strong>Bianca Desmond</strong>: My father has a cabin where we could stay.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Did Ahren have a job?</p>
<p><strong>Bianca Desmond</strong>: Yeah. Motocross racing.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Right. You said that.</p>
<p><strong>Bianca Desmond</strong>: He's a professional athlete.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: And you, what about you? What do you do? </p>
<p><strong>Bianca Desmond</strong>: I'm in fashion.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Mm-hm. What's the matter?</p>
<p><strong>Bianca Desmond</strong>: I have the worst luck with men.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>Bianca Desmond</strong>: They're either jerks or they leave me, or they get killed. What's wrong with me?</p>

<p>[INT. GARAGE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Nick and Catherine exit their vehicle. They meet up with Sofia Curtis and head over to the dead body in the garage.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What do you got?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Well, I wasn't sure if I should call it in as a 419 or a 401a.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hit and run?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: You tell me.</p>
<p>(They walk over to the car that's smashed up against the concrete garage wall. The victim is pinned up against the car and the wall.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mm, I don't know. When you run, you usually take the car.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: The vic's Sylvia Mullins. Works in one of the offices upstairs. The security guard found her.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Did you run the plates?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: That's why I went with the 419. RO's the vic.</p>
<p>(Sofia walks away to leave the scene to them. Nick sighs.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hit with her own car in her own spot.</p>
<p>(Sofia talks with the guard.) </p>
<p><strong>Guard</strong>: Ms. Mullins must have been working all night. You know, tax season.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: She's an accountant?</p>
<p><strong>Guard</strong>: Has her own firm up on 11.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Did you see anything on your monitors?</p>
<p>(He turns and looks at the security video.) </p>
<p><strong>Guard</strong>: Uh, no. But I heard the crash. I sort of fell asleep.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: We're going to need to see your tapes.</p>
<p>(He nods.) </p>
<p>(Catherine and Nick examine the car and the items around the victim.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Cell phone, a shoe and a briefcase. Probably lost them all on impact.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Looks like she saw the car coming. Impact's pretty evenly distributed. The car hit her straight on.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Most cars have to be going at least 14 miles an hour to trigger the airbag.</p>
<p>(Catherine opens the car door and looks inside. She notices the ignition missing.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, I can't be sure, but it looks like somebody popped the ignition.</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: The carjacker uses a screwdriver and pops the ignition. End of flash.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Carjacking gone bad? Vic gets off the elevator, walks to her spot ...</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: Sylvia Mullins walks out into the garage and automatically heads to her parking space. She's on the phone and doesn't notice the car missing till she's standing in the parking space.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) ...on the phone, distracted, catches the guy stealing her ride ...</p>
<p>(She turns around. The car starts and heads straight for her.) </p>
<p><strong>Sylvia Mullins</strong>: No! </p>
<p>(The car hits her in the abdomen and pins her to the wall. The carjacker runs.) </p>
<p>(End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: He runs her over and splits.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Pedal to the metal.</p>

<p>[INT. DESMOND RESIDENCE - BATHROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Greg is in the bathroom using the ALS on the walls. There are splotches everywhere. Sara walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: ALS is lighting up everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Evidently she bleaches everything. So there could be some false positives.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yeah, including her teeth. Check out the cabinet.</p>
<p>(Sara opens the cabinet and looks inside.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Lots of teeth whitener and acne cream. (She turns to look at Greg.) Are you thinking what I'm thinking?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Speed freak.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Definitely.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Maybe she killed Ahren in the garage, then came up here to take a Silkwood shower. </p>
<p>(Quick flash to: Bianca is in the shower washing the blood down the drain. End of flash.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Okay, but she's claiming she loved him. What's her motive?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. DESMOND RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(Brass talks with Chelsea Wannamaker.) </p>
<p><strong>Chelsea Wannamaker</strong>: Uh, we started out at Light and then we went to Road Runner, and from there we were at Double Down, and then Copper K, and then we ended up at Drai's.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Drai's, that's a good place to end. So what are you on besides meth?</p>
<p><strong>Chelsea Wannamaker</strong>: Not meth. Glass.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>Chelsea Wannamaker</strong>: We did some coke at the club, had a couple of drinks. There was this guy that gave us these, uh, these blue pills, but I had to come home and lie down.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Ecstasy.</p>
<p><strong>Chelsea Wannamaker</strong>: We only do this when we're, when we're clubbing. I mean, it's just a hobby, it's not a habit. We have it under control.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, the dead guy from the garage might beg to differ.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. DESMOND RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(Sara and Gregg ALS the sheets. There are splotches on the sheets.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Eww, busy.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: If Bianca killed him, and then came up here to take a shower, wouldn't she have left a trail?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p>(Greg ALS's the carpet. He finds something.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: It appears she missed a spot.</p>

[INT. DESMOND RESIDENCE - GARAGE - DAY]</p>
<p>(Warrick moves the evidence bags to the counter. He finds some sticky liquid on the ground next to a stack of soft drinks. The cardboard containers are soaked. He looks it over and finds a can with a bullet hold in it.) </p>
<p>(He looks out of the garage and visualizes the shooter.)</p>
<p>(CGI EFX: The shooter stands just outside the garage. He raises his gun and fires. The bullet hits the soft drink can. End of CGI EFX.)</p>
<p>(Warrick shakes the can and hears something metal inside. He pops the can open and drains out the liquid into a red plastic bucket. The bullet falls out. He picks up the bullet and looks at it.) </p>

<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: (to phone) Las Vegas Coroner's office.</p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>(Warrick is at the garage.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: David, it's Warrick. Have you washed the body yet?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: I just got started, but I can be done by the time you get here.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No, stop. I uh, just found a bullet. I have no idea who fired it. Do me a favor: Test his hands for GSR and run it through the fluoroscope.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>(Warrick hangs up. Grissom ducks under the crime scene tape and enter the garage. Warrick holds the bullet up for him to see.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Who brings a gun to a knife fight?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The winner?</p>

<p>(Nick and Catherine walk through the hallway.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: The killer knew how to steal a car.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No prints?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No. No, it's wiped clean.</p>
<p>(They walk into the A/V Lab.) </p>
<p>[INT. CSI - A/V LAB - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, Arch. You get anything off the parking garage camera?</p>
<p><strong>Archie</strong>: Um, sort of.</p>
<p>(He shows the video.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What's up with the focus?</p>
<p><strong>Archie</strong>: That's what I was wondering, too. Check out what happened about an hour earlier.</p>
<p>(He goes an hour back and shows that someone reaches up and changes the focus on the camera.) </p>
<p><strong>Archie</strong>: It's an old security cam. Adjustable focus ring.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Killer was camera shy.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: For good reason.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: This wasn't a carjacking gone bad. It was premeditated.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: If he touched the camera, maybe I can get some prints off it.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Keep working the video, Arch. See if you can get us a face.</p>
<p><strong>Archie</strong>: Yeah.</p>

[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY - DAY]</p>
<p>(Robbins reports his findings to Grissom. Behind him, David Phillips works on something.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Fluoroscope detected no bullets. But there are peri-mortem bruises on his wrists and forearms, look like defensive wounds.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: COD?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: The weapon went pretty deep. Punctured the femoral artery. I'd say he bled out in a matter of minutes, if his dilated pupils are an indication of amphetamines in his system. The faster the heart rate, the faster the blood pumps. Now, for the details. The fatal blow. Weapon appears to have a triangular shape. Angle of entry was upwards.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Like a cornada.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: I'm sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: A cornada-occupational hazard for matadors during a bullfight. The bull rears up and gores them.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: (absently interrupts the conversation) So just find a bull with a bloody horn, and you've got your killer.</p>

<p>(Bobby Dawson walks through the hallway as he reports his findings to Warrick.) </p>
<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: So your &quot;soda-can killer&quot; was a copper-washed .22. Now I could only get general rifling characteristics -- six lands and grooves with a right-hand twist, um, but ...</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: But not enough individual characteristics to run it through IBIS.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: Exactly. Sorry, man.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: That's all right.</p>
<p>(Bobby Dawson turns and leaves. Warrick continues on through to the Trace Lab.) </p>

<p>(Hodges turns around.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hodges.</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Your victim did not have GSR on his hands.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Okay, what about metallic trace from the garage floor?</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Thank you, Hodges, for performing that incredibly elaborate test requiring copious concentration and an advanced degree.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So you don't have any results from the metallic trace on the garage floor?</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: But I will. That's the beauty of me.</p>

<p>(Nick goes through the contents in Sylvia Mullins' bag. He takes out a tape recorder, camera and other items.) </p>
<p>(He turns the tape recorder on.) </p>
<p><strong>Sylvia Mullins</strong>: (from tape) Well, Mr. Miller, what I would recommend is adding some tax-deferred investments to your portfolio. Like a Roth IRA. That'd be perfect for you.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Miller</strong>: (from tape) I never got what that Roth stood for.</p>
<p>(Nick turns the tape recorder off.) </p>
<p>(He opens Sylvia Mullins' planner and finds an entry for Kelly Gordon and Walter Gordon. Surprised by the find, Nick checks the tape recorder again.) </p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: How long ago was that?</p>
<p><strong>Justin Cole</strong>: A few months.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Did you stop by recently to check out the competition?</p>
<p><strong>Justin Cole</strong>: No. We lost touch.</p>

<p><strong>Justin Cole</strong>: It was good while it lasted.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: We found your blood in her bedroom. And her dead boyfriend in the garage.</p>

<p>(Hodges and Wendy Simms walk in.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: As much as I love your generalizations, actually, this time you're wrong. The metallic scrapes on the garage floor were titanium. The phone guy's tool was carbon steel.</p>

<p>(Sara continues to process the ink.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Sara reports her findings to Warrick and Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: There were two different inks on the work order, which means the date on the work order was compromised. Tom Harper made a service call to Bianca's house not in December, but ten months earlier, in February. </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Why would the guy lie?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It appears that he was a lot more to her than just the phone guy. Our bachelorette was a very busy girl. </p>
<p>(Sara turns and points to the phone logs she has highlighted and posted on the walls.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Phone calls from Bianca to Tom are in yellow, from Bianca to Justin are in blue, and from Bianca to Ahren are in pink. There was always overlap. Bachelor number one: Tom, phone guy -- strong showing from February 18 until June-ish. She called him two, three times a day. And then around June 5, bachelor number two enters the picture -- Justin. Ten days of overlap and then all the calls to Tom stopped until ...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The week Justin was shot and moved out.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Exactly. Ahren entered the picture about five days later in mid-<br />
September. At that point, all the phone calls to the other guys stopped until just about a week ago.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: When she started calling Tom again.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Every time this chick calls Tom, somebody gets shot.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's like thermite.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Thermite?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: When you combine two seemingly harmless elements -- aluminum and rust -- press them together, add heat ... it creates an explosion so hot it'll burn through steel. Powerful but uncontrollable. It burns and burns until it burns itself out, finally consuming both elements.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I guess some people just shouldn't be together.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Tom Harper is climbing down a telephone pole when officer cars pull up below. Brass and Sara exit the car.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Tom Harper! Come on down!</p>
<p>(Tom steps down from the pole.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You made me find you twice, Tom. That's a drag.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Harper</strong>: What's the problem?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know, I think you saw Bianca in her panties more than once.</p>
<p>(Sara notices Tom's climbing spikes attached to his shoes. She kneels down for a closer look.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Now those could change a man. (Camera zooms in for a close-up to show the blood still on them.) And it looks like they did.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) -- DAY] </p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Brass interviews Tom Harper.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know, it's fill in the blank. If it walks like a stalker, talks like a stalker ...</p>
<p><strong>Tom Harper</strong>: I'm not a stalker.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Then what's this? Excellent service? Here's the top of the telephone pole near Bianca's house.</p>
<p>(Brass shows Tom a photo of the cut wires.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Ahren was tapping your girl, so you started tapping her phone.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Harper</strong>: I only listened when I thought she was in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Look, her father called her at 7:00 A.M. New York time, that's 4:00 in the morning in Vegas. You had to be on the pole to hear it because we were on the scene an hour later.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [NIGHT] Tom Harper is on the top of the telephone pole and hears the phone message to Bianca.) </p>
<p><strong>Harry Desmond</strong>: (from phone) Bianca, honey, it's Daddy. I got your message about moving to Colorado with Ahren. </p>
<p>(Cut to: Ahren is in the garage. He turns around and finds Tom behind him.)</p>
<p><strong>Tom Harper</strong>: Stay away from Bianca.</p>
<p>(Tom takes out a gun and points it at Ahren.) </p>
<p><strong>Ahren Green</strong>: Who are you? </p>
<p><strong>Tom Harper</strong>: You're not taking her to Colorado.</p>
<p><strong>Ahren Green</strong>: The hell I'm not.</p>
<p>(He throws the helmet at him and the two men fight. The gun goes off and they continue to fight.) </p>
<p>(Ahren punches Tom back to the ground. He goes after him. Tom stabs him in the upper leg with the spikes in his boots. Tom grabs his things and leaves.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Tom Harper</strong>: I just wanted her to be happy.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: With you and no one else.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Harper</strong>: No. Those other guys were jerks. I only wanted to scare him off.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, like you did with Justin?</p>
<p><strong>Tom Harper</strong>: That worked.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, but Bianca didn't come running back to you, so I guess you had to scare her, too.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [INT. DESMOND RESIDENCE - DAY] Bianca Desmond is sitting on the sofa when Tom walks in. She turns around and sees him.) </p>
<p><strong>Bianca Desmond</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>Tom Harper</strong>: I came to see you.</p>
<p><strong>Bianca Desmond</strong>: I think you should leave.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Harper</strong>: Your mom wants us to be together.</p>
<p><strong>Bianca Desmond</strong>: My mom?! Let go!</p>
<p>(They two struggle.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Tom Harper</strong>: Her mother and I weren't always going to be around to clean up her messes.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Wait a minute. Are you telling me that Chelsea asked you to hurt these guys?</p>
<p>(He nods.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(Brass interviews Chelsea Wannamaker.) </p>
<p><strong>Chelsea Wannamaker</strong>: So you have some lunatic stalker telephone repairman claiming that I told him to kill my daughter's boyfriends? Give me a break.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We have multiple calls to him from Bianca's house and it was not her. We also have on the record that you called him from your cell.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Coincidentally, right around the time Justin was shot and Ahren was killed. We call that 'solicitation for murder.'</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: But you'd probably call it, what, good mother?</p>
<p><strong>Chelsea Wannamaker</strong>: I love my daughter.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, apparently, a lot of her boyfriends, too.</p>
<p><strong>Chelsea Wannamaker</strong>: I called Tom. I asked him to scare Justin away. He was after Bianca for her money. I mean, we have to protect ourselves.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, but Ahren didn't love her for her money. What was wrong with him?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So he was good enough for you, but too good for your daughter, was that it? </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I mean, finding a soul mate is hard enough, but competing with your mother, that shouldn't be an issue. That goes against ... I don't know, nature.</p>
<p><strong>Chelsea Wannamaker</strong>: I was attracted to Ahren ... and I was just trying to keep him away from Bianca and me.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Lady, you unleashed an unstable man that you knew was in love with your daughter. You had to know that that was not going to end well.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Catherine catches Nick in the hallway.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, hey, Nick. Nick.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We caught a break. </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: The security guard confessed.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No. Archie isolated a frame of the killer turning the focus ring.</p>
<p>(She shows him the photos of the killer's hand. On the center of the hand is a tattoo.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: She did it.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE KELLY'S APARTMENT -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Sofia Curtis, a couple of officers and Nick approach the door with guns drawn.) </p>
<p>(Sofia pounds on the door.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Las Vegas Police! Open up!</p>
<p>(There's no answers. Sofia nods and an officer smashes the door open.) </p>
<p>(Sofia and the officers enter.) </p>
<p>[INT. KELLY'S APARTMENT -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Sofia finds Kelly sitting on the bed.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Kelly Gordon, you're under arrest for the murder of Sylvia Mullins. Stand up.</p>
<p>(She doesn't move.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Stand up!</p>
<p>(Kelly stands up. She's very lethargic. Sofia has a hard time keeping her hands up to pat her down. Kelly looks at Nick.) </p>
<p><strong>Kelly Gordon</strong>: (quietly) Care why I did it?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Doesn't really matter now.</p>
<p><strong>Kelly Gordon</strong>: She told me my dad didn't leave me anything. He never would've done that. He loved me.</p>
<p>(Sofia cuffs her.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: So you killed her?</p>
<p>(Nick looks at the bottle on the bedside table.) </p>
<p><strong>Kelly Gordon</strong>: The ransom was her idea. She didn't get the money. She took it from me.</p>
<p>(Kelly falls back to the bed and convulses.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: She's OD'ing. She's OD'ing right now.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Call a paramedic.</p>
<p>(In the background, we hear an officer making the call.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Vicodine, INH, methadone. Kelly! </p>
<p>(Nick leans over her.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Kelly! Kelly!</p>
<p>(Kelly stops convulsing.) </p>
<p>(Nick looks at Sofia. Sofia checks for breath, then starts chest compressions.)</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>

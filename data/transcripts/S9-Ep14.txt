							<p>I responded to a recovered missing person's vehicle at the Orpheus Casino.</p>
<p>When I oped the trunk, I observed a rolled up carpet with a large dark stain, which appeared to be blood.</p>
<p>Inside the carpet, I discovered the body of Amber Jones.</p>
<p>I also observed three gunshot wounds.</p>
<p>One to the right shoulder.</p>
<p>Two to the abdomen.</p>
<p>The Medical Examiner was able to recover all three of the bullets.</p>
<p>They were nine millimeter caliber, six lands and grooves, right hand twist.</p>
<p>Consistent with the following four firearms.</p>
<p><em>**************</em></p>
<p>A Ruger, Luger, Walther and Beretta.</p>
<p>Dr. Langston, did you recover a murder weapon at the scene?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Has it ever been found?</p>
<p>No, the weapon is still missing.</p>
<p>Can you tell us if the defendant owns a gun?</p>
<p>Yes. Congressman Griffin has one firearm registered in his name.</p>
<p>A Beretta 92.</p>
<p>Were you able to compare the congressman's Beretta against the coroner's bullets?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>The congressman stated that his gun had been stolen.</p>
<p>So, he must've filed a police report?</p>
<p>The congressman claimed that he didn't know his gun was missing until CSI asked him to produce it.</p>
<p>LVPD!</p>
<p>Drop the gun!</p>
<p>Drop it!</p>
<p>Drop the weapon now!</p>
<p>Everybody stay down.</p>
<p>Catherine!</p>
<p>There was just one shot. It came from right outside the door.</p>
<p>What happened here?</p>
<p>He had a gun. He was headed for the courtroom.</p>
<p>I tried to get him to stop, but he just looked at me and blew his brains out.</p>
<p>I did not fire my weapon.</p>
<p>That's Dominic Humphreys, the congressman's Chief of Staff.</p>
<p>The prosecution's key witness.</p>
<p>And that... is a Beretta 92.</p>
<p>CSI Season09</p>
<p>Episode14 Miscarriage of Justice Congressman!</p>
<p>Congressman, how do you feel about Dominic Humphreys' suicide?</p>
<p>Why do you think he did it?</p>
<p>Dominic Humphreys was my friend.</p>
<p>His death is not only a great loss to me, but to the people of the state.</p>
<p>Then why was he a witness for the prosecution?</p>
<p>That's all I want to say.</p>
<p>That's enough, no more questions!</p>
<p>The only reason a guy eats his gun in a courthouse is to make a statement.</p>
<p>Bullet looks like a through-and-through.</p>
<p>A lot of times, you'll find the bullet in clotted blood and brain matter.</p>
<p>So, that's where you want to start.</p>
<p>Nine millimeter hollow point.</p>
<p>That'll get the job done.</p>
<p>Nick, this was in his pocket.</p>
<p>Looks like it's signed by Dominic Humphreys.</p>
<p>I'm the congressman's Chief of Staff.</p>
<p>On that day, he called me around 5:00.</p>
<p>And he said, &quot;Oh, my God, &quot;Amber's dead.</p>
<p>Please... help me.&quot;</p>
<p>So, I drove to her house.</p>
<p>When I got there, she was...</p>
<p>She was on the kitchen floor.</p>
<p>Dead.</p>
<p>I saw that she was shot.</p>
<p>There was a lot of blood. So much blood; it was everywhere.</p>
<p>Just tell me what happened next.</p>
<p>I asked him what happened and he swore he didn't kill her.</p>
<p>That he found her like that, he had just come over to apologize, and she was already dead.</p>
<p>I believed him because there was no gun.</p>
<p>Then...</p>
<p>I told him to leave.</p>
<p>That I would take care of it.</p>
<p>This was given in exchange for reduced sentence.</p>
<p>Counsel, obviously, this plea testimony is no longer admissible.</p>
<p>Mr. Whitten can't cross-examine a dead man.</p>
<p>That doesn't preclu the people om presenting the physical evidence.</p>
<p>Your Honor, the congressman just wants to clear his name.</p>
<p>If the state's not going to drop the charges, we'd like to proceed as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Miss Willows, you said the suicide gun might also be the missing murder weapon?</p>
<p>How long will you need to confirm that?</p>
<p>Eight minutes? Eight hours?</p>
<p>Depends on how well the bullets are marked.</p>
<p>Plus, we are still processing the crime scene.</p>
<p>All right, then, I'll give you till tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Got anything?</p>
<p>Found fibers on your gun.</p>
<p>Where?</p>
<p>Bottom of the slide.</p>
<p>The bottom of the slide is exposed only when you're loading or firing the gun.</p>
<p>Did you identify the fibers?</p>
<p>Uh, yes. Blue-black dyed wool cashmere blend.</p>
<p>Dominic Humphreys was wearing a khaki suit when he shot himself.</p>
<p>So, they're not from the suicide.</p>
<p>Fibers must've got caught in there some time before that.</p>
<p>Which means that if this is the gun that killed Amber Jones, and you can match those fibers to the congressman's clothes, we've got a slam dunk.</p>
<p>So, get the gun to Ballistics.</p>
<p>I'll get a search warrant.</p>
<p>Vic left the keys in the ignition.</p>
<p>I wouldn't call a suicide a &quot;vic&quot;.</p>
<p>All I'm saying is, he knew he wasn't coming back.</p>
<p>This must've been the last thing he looked at.</p>
<p>Which makes him even more selfish.</p>
<p>If he really loved her, he wouldn't have killed himself.</p>
<p>My husband was convinced he was going to die in prison.</p>
<p>He was terrified. He wrote a will, took out life insurance.</p>
<p>I should have seen it coming.</p>
<p>Why? Did Dominic talk about what was going on?</p>
<p>No. He just kept talking about what he had lost.</p>
<p>How his life was over.</p>
<p>Dom graduated top of his class fr law school.</p>
<p>He wanted to change the world.</p>
<p>They were going to do it together.</p>
<p>He idolized Edward.</p>
<p>So, you'd say the congressman was more than just his boss?</p>
<p>He would've done anything for that man.</p>
<p>I blame him. This is Edward's fault.</p>
<p>Mrs. Humphreys, did your husnd ever say anything about Amber Jones, talk about the murder?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Did you know your husband had a gun?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>If it had been in the house, I would've known about it.</p>
<p>Fire two!</p>
<p>Gun's registered to the congressman.</p>
<p>It's his missing Beretta.</p>
<p>This is the gun that killed Amber Jones.</p>
<p>Humphreys said there was no gun at the scene.</p>
<p>He lied under oath.</p>
<p>&quot;Dear Edward, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>&quot;Sorry I wasn't a better man.</p>
<p>Sorry that I put you through this.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;I was just trying to protect you.</p>
<p>Amber was going to destroy all our dreams.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's why I I shot her.</p>
<p>I killed Amber Jones.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Forgive me.</p>
<p>Please tell my wife that I love her.&quot;</p>
<p>What does that say about my conclusions?</p>
<p>The ones I testified to in court that are part of the public record?</p>
<p>There's nothing wrong with your conclusions, Ray.</p>
<p>They were based on valid, scientific investigation.</p>
<p>And they were signed off by me, your supervisor.</p>
<p>But Humphreys had the gun. He confessed.</p>
<p>My experience as a doctor tells me, Catherine, that people tend to tell the truth when they know they're going to die.</p>
<p>Humphreys lied under oath.</p>
<p>And his confession is just words.</p>
<p>And the gun is equivocal.</p>
<p>I mean, we know that he cleaned up the crime scene.</p>
<p>Maybe the gun was there, too, and he lied about that.</p>
<p>Or maybe he stole it from the congressman's apartment, killed Amber with it, and the congressman is telling the truth.</p>
<p>Well... the A.D.A.is moving forward with the case.</p>
<p>They haven't declared a mistrial?</p>
<p>The judge is going to allow the jury to hear about the gun as well as Humphreys' suicide confession.</p>
<p>Which means I'll be back on the stand.</p>
<p>Ray, you testified that congressman Griffin was the most likely suspect.</p>
<p>Which was true based on the evidence that we had at the time.</p>
<p>And now, we have new evidence.</p>
<p>And when the evidence changes, we modify our theory to make it fit.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>What's our theory now?</p>
<p>I don't know yet.</p>
<p>Dr. Langston, I want to revisit the autopsy results.</p>
<p>The defendant claims he never had intercourse with Miss Jones.</p>
<p>Did you find any evidence to the contrary?</p>
<p>Objection! Leading.</p>
<p>Sustained. But the witness may answer the question.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>We discovered that the victim had occluded fallopian tubes.</p>
<p>Our tests confirmed that Miss Jones had advanced chlamydia.</p>
<p>Because chlamydia is highly contagious, it provided us with a method to confirm whether orot there had been sexual contact.</p>
<p>The congressman tested positive for the same strain of chlamydia as the victim.</p>
<p>Which means he lied again.</p>
<p>Objection.</p>
<p>Withdrawn.</p>
<p>There were dark fibers found in the gun slide.</p>
<p>No match to what Humphreys was wearing when he killed himself.</p>
<p>So they could be from Amber Jones' shooter?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>That'll be a good thing to know before the trial's over.</p>
<p>We searched the congressman's apartment before, but we weren't looking for fibers.</p>
<p>The judge has limited this warrant to just his clothing.</p>
<p>One of his attorneys will be there for you.</p>
<p>Great. So, I get a baby shark as a chaperone. That'll be fun.</p>
<p>Let me guess, I get the suicide closet.</p>
<p>No lawyer. Just the widow.</p>
<p>I'd rather have the lawyer.</p>
<p>Nick.</p>
<p>This is going to take a while.</p>
<p>Well, we don't have a while.</p>
<p>Langston is back on the stand.</p>
<p>So, you got some fresh eyes on this one.</p>
<p>Could Dominic Humphreys have killed Amber Jones?</p>
<p>Let's start with opportunity.</p>
<p>Did he have time to kill her?</p>
<p>We've only got approximate T.O.D.</p>
<p>We found her body on a Saturday.</p>
<p>And she died someti Wednesday.</p>
<p>Okay, here's what I got. Amber's last phone call was at 10:07.</p>
<p>She called in sick to The Tassel Room. She's a dancer.</p>
<p>Now, phone records also confirm that the congressman called Humphreys at 5:03 PM.</p>
<p>And the ca lasted three minutes.</p>
<p>And according to both men, the congressman made the call after he discovered Amber's body.</p>
<p>I need your help.</p>
<p>No, Amber's dead! Oh, my God.</p>
<p>I'm at her house. What do I do?</p>
<p>That puts T.O.D. sometime between 10:07 AM and 5:03 PM.</p>
<p>Humphreys was at a high school with the congressman from 9:30 AM... until noon.</p>
<p>Okay, and then, he chaired a hearing from 2:30 till 5:00.</p>
<p>He has no alibi from noon to 2:30.</p>
<p>He claimed he went to lunch. Alone.</p>
<p>Well, then he had plenty of time to kill her.</p>
<p>So, how much do they pay you to stand in a closet?</p>
<p>I get it, they don't pay you to talk.</p>
<p>What the hell is going on here?</p>
<p>This is harassment.</p>
<p>Ma'am, I gave the search warrant to your attorney.</p>
<p>I'm here looking for evidence.</p>
<p>You don't have enough evidence?</p>
<p>Well, you're not going to find anything here because my husband isn't guilty.</p>
<p>Ma'am, if you don't let me do my job, I'm going to have to get a uniform to remove you.</p>
<p>From my own apartment?</p>
<p>You people never stop.</p>
<p>You've already destroyed our lives. Haven't I lost enough?</p>
<p>I'm all done here, Mrs. Humphreys.</p>
<p>Thank you for your cooperation.</p>
<p>Do you think Dom killed her?</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>My husband's already dead.</p>
<p>I need to know.</p>
<p>Look, I'm sorry, I can't talk to you about the case.</p>
<p>No one will talk to me.</p>
<p>Not the police, not my friends.</p>
<p>They don't know what to say, what to think.</p>
<p>My advice, get out of this house.</p>
<p>Go stay with your family.</p>
<p>Dom was my family.</p>
<p>On the news, they said there was a note.</p>
<p>What did it say?</p>
<p>He said he loved you.</p>
<p>Did he say why?</p>
<p>Mrs. Humphreys...</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>You don't understand.</p>
<p>Actually, I do.</p>
<p>Your husband's note... whatever it says, it's... it's not going to take away your doubts or your questions.</p>
<p>Some people just can't be saved.</p>
<p>Dr. Langston, you testified that you discovered Miss Jones was killed in her kitchen.</p>
<p>Now, how did you figure that out again?</p>
<p>I searched for latent and cleaned up blood stains using luminol.</p>
<p>Thluminol revealed a torso-shaped blood pool that was on the floor and had recently been cleaned up.</p>
<p>It also revealed high velocity blood spatter on the walls that was consistent with a gunshot...</p>
<p>Thank you, but I'm not interested in that right now. Let's move on, shall we?</p>
<p>Now, you testified you found one fingerprint from my client. Where did you find that?</p>
<p>I found the congressman's print on the tilt rod of the blinds covering the front wdow.</p>
<p>Now, wasn't that in the living room?</p>
<p>But the murder happened in the kitchen, so aren't the two unrelated?</p>
<p>Which question would you like me to answer?</p>
<p>Can you tell the jury what chemical you used to determine when my client touched the tilt rod?</p>
<p>There isn't one.</p>
<p>There isn't one.</p>
<p>So are you saying that that one print proves my client pulled the trigger?</p>
<p>No, but it does prove he lied.</p>
<p>Until I found that print, the ngressman denied he was ever in the house.</p>
<p>Okay, Humphreys admitted cleaning up the scene, but why a casino parking lot?</p>
<p>Why would Humphreys dump Amber's body there? He had to know about surveillance.</p>
<p>I mean, that's how you caught him, right?</p>
<p>He was setting up a fall guy.</p>
<p>Figured it was worth the risk.</p>
<p>Humphreys was trying to frame Amber's stalker ex-boyfriend. Tommy Ruby.</p>
<p>He's a limo driver at the casino.</p>
<p>Now, he was our prime suspect.</p>
<p>But we couldn't talk to him. He blew town right after the murder.</p>
<p>How did Humphreys know about him?</p>
<p>Because Humphreys helped Amber file a T.R.O. against Tommy a few weeks before she died.</p>
<p>All right, I get the picture.</p>
<p>Humphreys was the congressman's little bitch.</p>
<p>One of Humphreys' jobs is party planning for the congressman.</p>
<p>The night before Amber died, Humphreys called her up.</p>
<p>Amber, he wants to see you.</p>
<p>Get over here as soon as you can.</p>
<p>Get this-- the congressman keeps two apartments in his building.</p>
<p>One is for him and the Missus, the other is for &quot;entertaining&quot;.</p>
<p>So we know they had a date that night, buit wasn't all fun and games.</p>
<p>I mean he even admits they had an argument.</p>
<p>Now he claims he got so drunk he passed out.</p>
<p>But he saw her trying to steal his wallet, so he hit her so hard he split her eye open.</p>
<p>Which he only owned up to because Langston found Amber's blood in the apartment.</p>
<p>Now, Humphreys drove her to the emergency room, and he signed her out.</p>
<p>He did everything the congressman asked him to do, so if the congressman ordered Humphreys to kill Amber, then why did he show up at her house that afternoon?</p>
<p>He wouldn't.</p>
<p>So, killing Amber is all Humphreys' idea?</p>
<p>Is that what we're concluding?</p>
<p>Are you familiar with a suicide note left by Dominic Humphreys?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>But I can't testify to it, because I...I didn't process the scene.</p>
<p>No, that's right. You're still a rookie, aren't you?</p>
<p>That has nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>I'm handing you a copy of the note, which is marked as defense exhibit M.</p>
<p>Allow me to summarize the contents.</p>
<p>Mr. Humphreys confessed to the murder of Amber Jones.</p>
<p>Now, didn't you testify that my client was the most likely suspect in her murder?</p>
<p>Yes, I did-- however...</p>
<p>You still stand by your own conclusion?</p>
<p>In light of the new evidence...</p>
<p>Yes or no?</p>
<p>No...I can't.</p>
<p>All right, settle down, quiet.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Hello, Matty.</p>
<p>My name is Ray, Ray Langston.</p>
<p>I know. Seen you on the stand.</p>
<p>You're a very brave girl, you know.</p>
<p>I think your mother would be very proud of you.</p>
<p>I'm not even sure who my mom really was.</p>
<p>She always used to say she was... a real dancer, an artist.</p>
<p>First, she dies, and then I find out she's full of crap.</p>
<p>She was just a stripper.</p>
<p>Well, whatever the tru is about your mother's life, she didn't deserve to die.</p>
<p>You must be hungry.</p>
<p>Would you, uh, care for this?</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Really, I can get another one.</p>
<p>I probably shouldn't be eating this anyway.</p>
<p>My stomach's upset.</p>
<p>How long have you had that rash on your arm?</p>
<p>I don't know, a couple days.</p>
<p>May I see if you have a fever?</p>
<p>Just need to touch your neck.</p>
<p>I'm a doctor-- it's okay.</p>
<p>Matty, I'm going to ask you a question, and I apologize if it seems a bit awkward.</p>
<p>Um, have you noticed that you haven't been urinati a lot lately?</p>
<p>I'm not like my mother.</p>
<p>I don't have any diseases.</p>
<p>I know, I know, but I think you may be very sick.</p>
<p>We should get you to a hospital as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy, my man!</p>
<p>Bad idea to get in a bar fight when every cop in the county is looking for you.</p>
<p>I've been out of town.</p>
<p>All right, I just got back yesterday.</p>
<p>Look, I just stopped by the club to say hey to my girls.</p>
<p>The Tassel Room.</p>
<p>Amber Jones was one of your girls-- remember her?</p>
<p>You left town the day she was murdered.</p>
<p>Kind of makes you look guilty.</p>
<p>Yeah, but they caught the guy that shot her.</p>
<p>That, uh...the congressman.</p>
<p>Look, I didn't do nothing.</p>
<p>You were stalking her.</p>
<p>That's her side of the story.</p>
<p>According to Amber's daughter, you were parked outside her house the day before her mother was murdered.</p>
<p>Amber filed a temporary restraining order against you.</p>
<p>She was afraid for her life.</p>
<p>Leave my mom alone!</p>
<p>You're not supposed to be here!</p>
<p>I'm calling the cops and getting your ass arrested!</p>
<p>Matty's got it all wrong.</p>
<p>All right, I was just trying to make amends.</p>
<p>See, I'm in the 12-step program.</p>
<p>Making amends is part of my recovery.</p>
<p>Okay, I'm on step nine.</p>
<p>Oh, I think you missed a couple of steps there, Tommy, 'cause you're drunk.</p>
<p>You smell like a brewery.</p>
<p>Can't walk in a straight line.</p>
<p>I took Amber's death really hard.</p>
<p>All right, it set me back.</p>
<p>See, I never got a chance to tell her that I truly forgave her for ruining my life.</p>
<p>You're either a stalker... or you're the best eyewitness ever.</p>
<p>What's it going to be?</p>
<p>Oh, that's easy.</p>
<p>What do you want to know?</p>
<p>When was the last time you saw her?</p>
<p>The day after her kid kicked the crap out of my limo.</p>
<p>I was in between pickups, and she received a package from Worldwide...</p>
<p>World...World-Send.</p>
<p>That's when I saw her.</p>
<p>She looked like hell.</p>
<p>She was always such a tease.</p>
<p>Got a kick out of making guys want her.</p>
<p>It was 4:01 P.M.</p>
<p>I remember, because I got a call from my dispatcher.</p>
<p>Uh, I had to bounce 'cause I was running late.</p>
<p>That's the last time I saw her.</p>
<p>What about me? Can I go?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>You're not going anywhere.</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>Well, we never found a World-Send package, but we didn't process the house until four days after the fact.</p>
<p>If we can confirm that she got a delivery just after 4:00, that narrows the T.O.D.to between 4:00 and 5:00.</p>
<p>That means that Dominic Humphreys didn't kill her.</p>
<p>Brings us back to the congressman.</p>
<p>Amber Jones was a single mom, struggling to support her teenage daughter.</p>
<p>Congressman Edward Griffin...is a married man.</p>
<p>He seduced her.</p>
<p>Took advantage of her.</p>
<p>He admits being physically violent.</p>
<p>And when Amber became a liability to his marriage and his career, he murdered her.</p>
<p>The defense would have you believe that Dominic Humphreys committed this crime.</p>
<p>After all, Mr. Humphreys confessed to it before taking his own life.</p>
<p>But that's another lie in a giant web of lies.</p>
<p>The evidence proves beyond a reasonable doubt Mr. Humphreys had an alibi and could not have killed Amber Jones.</p>
<p>The defendant needs to be held accountable for his actions.</p>
<p>Find him guilty.</p>
<p>Amber Jones lost her life, and that's a tragedy.</p>
<p>But she's not the only victim here.</p>
<p>My client lost his life, too.</p>
<p>Now, this man is not perfect.</p>
<p>He had an affair.</p>
<p>He and his wife have dealt with that privately, and she's forgiven him.</p>
<p>But I'm going to tell you what really happened.</p>
<p>My client went to Amber Jones' house to apologize for losing his temper and to end the affair.</p>
<p>He found her body.</p>
<p>And that's when he made a mistake he will regret for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>He didn't call 911.</p>
<p>He called Dominic Humphreys.</p>
<p>He made a mistake.</p>
<p>But he's not killer.</p>
<p>Well, your suspicions are correct.</p>
<p>Matty was being poisoned.</p>
<p>Boric acid.</p>
<p>50 micrograms per milliliter.</p>
<p>ALT levels over a 1,000.</p>
<p>BUN levels 86.</p>
<p>Her kidneys are shutting down.</p>
<p>Based on the level of organ damage, I'd say that she's been ingesting it for about eight weeks.</p>
<p>Do you know the source?</p>
<p>Not yet.</p>
<p>You're putting her on dialysis?</p>
<p>That's about all we can do at this point.</p>
<p>****permanent organ damage?</p>
<p>Not yet.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>How's Matty?</p>
<p>She'll live, but they haven't ruled out permanent damage.</p>
<p>Langston.</p>
<p>I found trace levels of boric acid in Amber Jones' blood and organs.</p>
<p>Consistent with a one-time dose.</p>
<p>Well, low levels don't rule out chronic poisoning.</p>
<p>Right, the only way to confirm how long she was being poisoned is through hair analysis.</p>
<p>And the only way to do that is for us to get some of her hair.</p>
<p>I'll get a warrant to exhume the body.</p>
<p>I think Amber was the target and her daughter was collateral damage.</p>
<p>Well, if poisoning was the weapon of choice, why change weapons and shoot her?</p>
<p>All right, let's say I'm the killer.</p>
<p>I decide to poison Amber.</p>
<p>She doesn't die, so I panic.</p>
<p>And I shoot her.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Amber's been dead eight weeks, yet her daughter is still being exposed to the poison, so the source has got to be in their house.</p>
<p>Got to be hard to sleep in the same house where your mom was killed.</p>
<p>Well, they say kids are resilient.</p>
<p>Nobody's that resilient.</p>
<p>She's probably blaming herself.</p>
<p>Voice of experience?</p>
<p>Boric acid can be ingested or absorbed through the skin.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go check out the shampoos and body washes.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Is Riley all right?</p>
<p>I think this whole case has, uh, hit a nerve.</p>
<p>Well, she's not shy.</p>
<p>If she wanted to talk about it, she would.</p>
<p>Source of the poison has to be something that's been around for at least two months.</p>
<p>I'll start with any open items.</p>
<p>We have a winner.</p>
<p>Looks like somebody tampered with their drink mix.</p>
<p>Purchased at Skadden Pharmacy.</p>
<p>Well, it looks like she usually shopped at Nathan's Market.</p>
<p>You don't buy food at a pharmacy unless you're there picking something else up.</p>
<p>Hey, did you find any, uh, prescription meds?</p>
<p>Just an antibiotic and a hydrocodone.</p>
<p>You got something?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This prescription was filled the night before Amber was murdered.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>David, would you hand me a rubber band, please?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I'll get this to Henry stat.</p>
<p>Matty looks just like her mother.</p>
<p>Did you note this at autopsy?</p>
<p>If I had, no way I would have cut through it.</p>
<p>It must have developed later.</p>
<p>Embalming fluid can enhance discoloration.</p>
<p>Contusion had to have occurred perimortem.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the bruise would have blossomed earlier.</p>
<p>It's a shoe impression.</p>
<p>Jury, have you reached a verdict?</p>
<p>Yes, Your Honor, we have.</p>
<p>Will the defendant please rise?</p>
<p>&quot;In the matter of State of Nevada v.Edward Griffin, &quot;</p>
<p>&quot;we the jury find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree.&quot;</p>
<p>Settle down.</p>
<p>Quiet!</p>
<p>Please remand the defendant into custody.</p>
<p>We're live at the courthouse, where, just moments ago, Congressman Griffin was remanded into custody after he was convicted in the murder of local resident Amber...</p>
<p>Oh, we got a conviction.</p>
<p>Jury came back quick.</p>
<p>Well, this case isn't over yet.</p>
<p>I called the pharmacist at Skadden's.</p>
<p>On the night before Amber died, the emergency room Doc called in two prescriptions-- an antibiotic and a painkiller.</p>
<p>They were picked up and paid for by Dominic Humphreys.</p>
<p>Well, he took her to the E.R.and then drove her home.</p>
<p>Yeah, but the meds weren't the only thing he picked up.</p>
<p>Check it out.</p>
<p>Bandages, medical tape, antibiotic ointment, energy drink mix, crackers, soup.</p>
<p>Roach poison?</p>
<p>Humphreys was the one trying to poison her?</p>
<p>And then the congressman decided to shoot her?</p>
<p>That's what it looks like.</p>
<p>Obviously, he didn't care that he poisoned her daughter, too.</p>
<p>We found new evidence on Amber Jones' body.</p>
<p>You got to be kidding me.</p>
<p>Shoe impression bruise.</p>
<p>Developed after the embalming.</p>
<p>Its only seven inches long.</p>
<p>Well, it has to belong to the killer.</p>
<p>Can't be the congressman's.</p>
<p>Seven inches-- that's got to be female.</p>
<p>The only female with access to the murder weapon is Mrs. Griffin.</p>
<p>Did the wife have an alibi from 4:00 to 5:00?</p>
<p>I remember Mrs. Griffin telling Brass that she was in bed recovering from a miscarriage.</p>
<p>Her hormones are already in overdrive, and then she catches her husband cheating.</p>
<p>She might have caught more than that.</p>
<p>Amber gave the congressman chlamydia.</p>
<p>I think he gave it to his wife.</p>
<p>Chlamya can cause a miscarriage.</p>
<p>Well, that's one hell of a motive.</p>
<p>This bruise is not specific enough to identify the shoe.</p>
<p>No, but we can get a warrant for her clothes.</p>
<p>Maybe we can match the fibers from the gun slide.</p>
<p>Call the A.D.A.</p>
<p>Let her know that she won't be taking tomorrow off.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>We found these gloves in your closet.</p>
<p>Blue-black dye, wool and cashmere blend.</p>
<p>It proves you killed Amber Jones.</p>
<p>You two need to watch the news.</p>
<p>Her husband was just found guilty.</p>
<p>Hey, I get it.</p>
<p>You lost your baby because he couldn't keep it in his pants.</p>
<p>Your husband's conviction will be overturned. That's the good news.</p>
<p>The bad news is, unless you talk to us, you'll be the one on trial.</p>
<p>You don't have to say a word to these people.</p>
<p>I can't go through this again.</p>
<p>I had...just come back from seeing my doctor, and I needed to talk to my husband.</p>
<p>But he wasn't home.</p>
<p>I saw his wallet on the dresser.</p>
<p>That meant he was downstairs.</p>
<p>He had cheated before.</p>
<p>But when he ran for office, we made a deal.</p>
<p>He could look, but not touch.</p>
<p>I'm the one who hit the little bitch, not him.</p>
<p>But you didn't stop there, right?</p>
<p>The next morning... my doctor called and told me...</p>
<p>I had chlamydia.</p>
<p>That's what killed my baby.</p>
<p>I'm 40 years old.</p>
<p>We had been trying to get pregnant for over three years.</p>
<p>It was my last chance.</p>
<p>My last chance to be a mother.</p>
<p>Then I...I found my husband's cell phone bill, and I just started calling numbers until I found hers.</p>
<p>Do you want something to drink?</p>
<p>Yeah, thank you.</p>
<p>I told her I was there to apologize.</p>
<p>That I'd been thinking about it all night.</p>
<p>No!</p>
<p>Please. Please don't kill me. Please.</p>
<p>Please! I have a daughter!</p>
<p>Because of you, my daughter is dead.</p>
<p>So you left, but you forgot the gun?</p>
<p>You figured Dominic would clean up after you, too.</p>
<p>No, Dominic didn't know anything about it.</p>
<p>He would never help me.</p>
<p>He always thought I was a liability to my husband's career.</p>
<p>So when did your husband realize that you...killed Amber?</p>
<p>As soon as you told him his gun was missing.</p>
<p>You have an STD.</p>
<p>You should go to the doctor.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>I would have killed him, not her.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Matty's going to be all right.</p>
<p>No permanentamage.</p>
<p>Glad to hear it.</p>
<p>Ray.</p>
<p>You deserve this.</p>
<p>Thank you, Catherine.</p>
<p>Talk about baptism by fire.</p>
<p>Yeah, but you made it through it.</p>
<p>You never quit.</p>
<p>Do you think she really dropped the gun?</p>
<p>Or do you think she left it there to frame him?</p>
<p>My money's on the frame.</p>
<p>I think she dropped it.</p>
<p>Heat of the moment.</p>
<p>Or maybe both things are true.</p>
<p>She accidentally dropped the gun, and then decided to leave it there to punish him.</p>
<p>Well, we'll never know.</p>
<p>But what we do know--</p>
<p>Ray got it right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Ray had a lot of help.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>
<p>A lot of help.</p>
<p>Teamwork.</p>
<p>Makes the dream work.</p>

<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY – EARLY MORNING]</p>
<p>[INT. CHURCH – EARLY MORNING] </p>
<p>(Two nuns, Sister Elizabeth and Sister Bridget, walk into the church. Both are carrying large vases of flowers. The vases are so large, they can barely see in front of them. Sister Elizabeth sniffs the air.) </p>
<p><strong>Sister Elizabeth</strong>: Urine.</p>
<p>(Sister Bridget sniffs the air. They make their way to the front of the church.) </p>
<p><strong>Sister Bridget</strong>: I don't smell it.</p>
<p><strong>Sister Elizabeth</strong>: Ever since Father started leaving the church open at night -- </p>
<p><strong>Sister Bridget</strong>: -- the church has gotten a lot more use.</p>
<p><strong>Sister Elizabeth</strong>: Yeah, as an orgy house and a toilet.</p>
<p><strong>Sister Bridget</strong>: No. People come in at all hours of the night to pray.</p>
<p><strong>Sister Elizabeth</strong>: &quot;Dear Jesus, please keep me from blowing all my laundry money on the nickel slots at the Gas 'n' Go.&quot;</p>
<p>(Sister Bridget puts her vase down on the floor next to a pew. Sister Elizabeth continues to the front. She sees a stream of liquid leading to the base of the statue of Jesus.) </p>
<p><strong>Sister Elizabeth</strong>: Oh, somebody's done their business right here next to Jesus.</p>
<p>(She puts her vase down on the floor near the statue of Jesus. She steps back, her eyes wide and fixed on the statue in front of her. Sister Bridget heads over.) </p>
<p><strong>Sister Bridget</strong>: Oh, no, not again.</p>
<p>(She turns and sees the older nun's reaction. She looks at the statue of Jesus and sees the blood on the palms of the statue's open hands.) </p>
<p>(The two nuns look at each other. Sister Bridget gasps. Sister Elizabeth crosses herself.) </p>
<p><strong>Sister Elizabeth</strong>: Right here on the eve of the apocalypse, a miracle.</p>
<p>CU: BLOODY STATUE HAND</p>
<p>(SLOW MOTION. A single drop of blood falls and spatters on the statue's hand.)</p>
<p>(The two nuns look up.) </p>
<p>(There hanging from the rafters is a woman dressed in a white gown, her arms spread out wide and away from her body.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CHURCH -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Sirens wail in the distance.) </p>
<p>(Crime scene tape is attached to the pews to block aisle entry. Grissom and Brass stand at the base of the statue, looking up at the dead body hanging from the rafters.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Somebody went to a lot of trouble to get her up there.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Why? I wonder. Somebody had a grudge against the church or somebody in the church.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Or maybe they were just mad at God.</p>
<p>(They look at each other, then turn and look up at the body above them.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, Jesus died for our sins. What sin did she die for?</p>
<p>FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[INT. CHURCH -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Warrick stands on the ground taking photos of the dead body. Nick is on the rising platform nearby.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You know if you think about it, this is one of the oldest ways to kill somebody.</p>
<p>(The platform stops near the pulley system holding the body up in mid-air.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Considering where we are, highly symbolic. All right, what do you got? How we gonna do this?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, the two-by-four is tied to the scaffold with a single loop. There is an empty pulley up here. We could lower her down with that.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (looking up) That's probably how the killer got her up there in the first place. Then he ditched the rope. (looks around) I wouldn't be surprised to find it around here someplace.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: First things first. We'll use our rope; I'll run it through this pulley, and then let you take the weight. I'll mark the rope, cut the knot; down she goes.</p>
<p>(Warrick picks up their rope from the ground.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(Nick tightens the rope around the two-by-four. He has the rope through the pulley.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You take the weight. I'll cut it on three.</p>
<p>(Down below, Warrick braces himself as he holds the end of the rope.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: One, two, three.</p>
<p>(Nick cuts the rope.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Got it?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, ready. (groans) Oh. Whoever tied her up there had to be strong enough to deadlift her weight.</p>
<p>(Nick brings the platform down with the body.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, either that or highly motivated. You know how it is once somebody's adrenaline gets pumping. Feel like they can do anything.</p>
<p>(The platform and the body reach the ground.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: All right, that's it.</p>
<p>(Warrick and Nick put the cross and body flat on the plastic over the ground.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. CHURCH – FRONT (STOCK) -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Sirens wail in the background. An officer ducks under the crime scene tape and walks away.) </p>
<p>[INT. CHURCH – HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Greg finishes fingerprinting the two sisters, Sister Elizabeth and Sister Bridget. Brass stands nearby as they talk. The sisters wipe the ink of their fingers.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Look, shouldn't Father Frank be here by now?</p>
<p><strong>Sister Elizabeth</strong>: Father Frank lives in mañana land.</p>
<p><strong>Sister Bridget</strong>: Well, I'm sure he's on his way. Father Frank is a wonderful priest. And since he's been here, church attendance has tripled.</p>
<p><strong>Sister Elizabeth</strong>: (gruffly) Among our female congregants.</p>
<p>(Sister Bridget sighs. She turns back to Brass and smiles.) </p>
<p><strong>Sister Bridget</strong>: And we have sponsors for our building fund.</p>
<p><strong>Sister Elizabeth</strong>: One sponsor.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: The Big Hombre?</p>
<p><strong>Sister Elizabeth</strong>: The car dealership.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CHURCH -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Robbins wipes his liver thermometer. Grissom stands nearby with his clipboard.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Time of death was sometime between 2:00 and 4:00. Nasty head wound. She was actively bleeding, so she had to have been alive when she was tied to the cross. Good chance she died of suffocation.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Like Jesus.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Well, Jesus had a footrest. He was able to lift himself up and take short breaths. But this young lady was hanging. Her pectoral muscles probably became paralyzed and the intercostal muscles were unable to function. She was able to breathe out, but not breathe in.</p>
<p>INSERT: CGI ENHANCEMENT</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (V.O.) In time, carbon dioxide built up in her lungs and bloodstream. Edema built up in the chest cavity. Heart went into fibrillation.</p>
<p>BACK TO SCENE.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Gruesome torture in any century.</p>
<p>(Catherine walks up the aisle.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: In eighteen years, this is my first crucifixion. In a Catholic church with no crucifixes.</p>
<p>(Catherine notes the blood on the palm of the statue of Jesus.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I imagine the priest is a resurrection theologian, as opposed to a crucifixion theologian. They believe in forgiveness rather than penance.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We could all use a little forgiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: She was bleeding from her head wounds, and the beating didn't take place up there.</p>
<p>(Catherine notes the blood at the base of the statue of Jesus.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, the blood pool is gravitational. And the blood trail ...</p>
<p>(She looks around at the trail on the floor.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: ... the tips are pointing towards the statue. She was bleeding on the way in. I'll backtrack, see if I can find the point of origin.</p>
<p>(Catherine follows the blood to the door.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. CHURCH – FRONT -- DAY] </p>
<p>(A crowd of reporters and on-lookers have gathered around the front of the church. Father Frank Berlin pushes his way through the crowd to the church. Marty, a crackhead, follows him and gets too nervous with the police there.) </p>
<p><strong>Marty</strong>: Uh, ... I-I got to go, Father. I'll see you.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Berlin</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(Marty leaves. Frank Berlin stops at the tape barrier and talks with Officer Mitchell.) </p>
<p><strong>Frank Berlin</strong>: I'm the pastor of the church.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Mitchell</strong>: (over his shoulder) Hey, Captain. He'll take care of you.</p>
<p>(Officer Mitchell holds up the tape and Father Frank Berlin ducks under it.) </p>
<p><strong>Frank Berlin</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>(Brass walks over to him.) </p>
<p><strong>Frank Berlin</strong>: Father Frank Berlin.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'm Jim Brass, Las Vegas Police. You were supposed to be here 45 minutes ago. Where you been?</p>
<p><strong>Frank Berlin</strong>: Been serving breakfast at the shelter. I understand there's been a death in the church. How soon before you're out of here?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Father, this is a murder investigation.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Berlin</strong>: It's just we hold mass at ten o'clock.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, I understand. Sorry, Father, but, uh, this is a crime scene. You're not gonna get your church back for a while.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Berlin</strong>: Is it all right if we set mass in the community center?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, sure, I have no problem with that.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CHURCH – FOYER / SANCTUARY – DAY]</p>
<p>(Sisters Elizabeth and Bridget are wiping their hands. They stand up when Father Frank Berlin walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Frank Berlin</strong>: Sister, would you tell the choir we'll be singing &quot;In Paradisum.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Sister Bridget</strong>: I'll take care of it, Father.</p>
<p>(Sisters Bridget and Elizabeth leave. Greg gets up and follows Frank Berlin and Brass, who walk to the church sanctuary.) </p>
<p><strong>Frank Berlin</strong>: We sing the hymn for the dead every time we have a death.</p>
<p>(They turn and enter the church sanctuary and walk down the aisle toward the body.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Sisters couldn't identify the victim, so we'll need you to take a look.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Berlin</strong>: Sorry. I didn't mean to sound cavalier. It's just we've had over half a dozen deaths this year. We've never had to close the church.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: That's because in this neighborhood those derelicts and drug addicts died of heatstroke, overdose and old age. None of them were strung up in the rafters.</p>
<p>(They reach the front. Grissom turns around.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Father Frank Berlin, this is Gil Grissom from the Crime Lab.</p>
<p>(Robbins turns the victim's head toward Frank Berlin so he can see her.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Do you recognize her?</p>
<p>(Frank Berlin is quiet and distressed. Obviously he does recognize her. He shakes his head, no.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'll take that as a no.</p>
<p>(Grissom watches Frank Berlin.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Excuse me, Father. Is that blood on your jacket?</p>
<p>(Frank looks at the blood on the back of his upper arm.)</p>
<p><strong>Frank Berlin</strong>: Yeah. We had a fight in the shelter. I had to break it up.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We're gonna need to take your clothes.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Berlin</strong>: No, you can't have my clothes.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Then you have to come downtown to the police station.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: If you're gonna say mass later, you have to change anyway, right?</p>
<p>(Frank Berlin turns and leaves. Grissom motions to Greg.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Greg, go with him, collect his clothing.</p>
<p>(Greg shrugs and leaves to follow Frank Berlin.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Is it a bigger sin to lie if you're a priest?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I hope so.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CHURCH – HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Catherine follows the blood trail. She looks up and sees the candles on the stand near the window. She walks over.) </p>
<p>(She looks around. She takes a bill out, puts it in the donation slot. She takes a match from the matchbox and lights it.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: This one's for you, Sam.</p>
<p>(She lights the candle and blows the match out. She crosses herself.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CHURCH – STAIRS -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Greg follows Frank Berlin down the stairs. Greg carries the bag of clothes with him.) </p>
<p><strong>Frank Berlin</strong>: When will I get those back? I only have three sets of clothes.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Respectfully, Father, a woman's been murdered in your church and your clothes have blood on them. You're lucky you're not under arrest.</p>
<p>(Greg continues walking. Frank Berlin stops and sits down on the steps, upset.) </p>
<p>(Greg stops walking. He turns around and watches Frank Berlin for a moment. Greg turns and continues walking.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Sara gathers trace from the victim's body. She finishes marking the envelope and puts it on the tray. She picks up another envelope and gathers scrapings from under the victim's fingernails.) </p>
<p>(She finishes and sets it aside. She picks up the magnifying glass and looks at the victim's feet. She finds a thorn in the victim's feet and snaps a photo of it.) </p>
<p>(She removes the thorn and looks at it. She continues working.) </p>
<p>(The door opens and Grissom walks in. Without looking up, Sara knows it's him. Grissom puts his gloves on. Sara pulls out another thorn from the victim's feet.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Was there bougainvillea at the crime scene?</p>
<p>(Grissom stops and thinks about it.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Two shrubs at the entrance of the church. A row of four on the wall of the community center. Three bushes behind the rectory adjacent to the statue of St. Jude.</p>
<p>(She turns and smiles at him.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Did you anticipate that question in order to impress me with your powers of observation?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Memory's a gift.</p>
<p>(Sara goes back to examining the victim's feet. Grissom looks at the victim.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Mmm. From whom?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Who do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, I wouldn't necessarily call myself an atheist, but I am not sold on the notion of a higher power. However, I used to love the stories of the saints.</p>
<p>(Grissom notices a bruise pattern around the victim's neck. He puts his glasses on.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This job certainly challenges your faith.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yes, it does, but I have science.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I believe we need a little of both.</p>
<p>(Grissom thinks about it a moment. He takes his glasses off.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Sometimes I think we made up God just to have someone to blame for our mistakes. </p>
<p>(Grissom's quiet and doesn't answer her. He gets an idea and quickly leaves the room.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (calls out) It's just a theory.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. CHURCH – BACK -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Catherine puts evidence marker #18 down next to a drop of blood on the stone walkway. She continues walking and puts evidence marker #19 down near some blood near a statue.) </p>
<p>(She snaps a photo of it and looks around. Near the bushes, she finds a high-heeled sandal on the ground. She snaps photos of it and looks around the area. She finds the second matching sandal on the bougainvillea bush. She picks up the sandal and puts it on the ground next to the other sandal.) </p>
<p>(She looks around and sees a set of keys on the ground nearby. Catherine walks over and picks it up. She looks at it.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(Catherine steps out onto the sidewalk and holds out the car keys. She points it down the long row of cars and presses the alarm.)</p>
<p>(The car alarm blares behind her. She turns around and looks at the car parked right in front of the church.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CHURCH -- DAY] </p>
<p>VARIOUS DISSOLVES OF: </p>
<p>(Warrick checks the scaffolding for prints. He climbs up the ladder and swabs the scaffolding. He tests the swab.) </p>
<p>(Warrick looks around. He climbs up and finds a piece of hair on the scaffolding. He picks it up and puts it in a bindle.) </p>
<p>(He swabs some blood on the metal scaffolding. He tests it. It tests positive.)</p>
<p>(He climbs up further and finds a blood smear on the scaffolding.)</p>
<p>[INT. CHURCH – WALKWAY/BACK ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Nick is walking through the side hallways. He finds things lying against the wall. He opens a backroom door and finds the mother lode.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (chuckles) Hey.</p>
<p>(He steps inside and finds rope and other supplies.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (shouts) Hey! Hey, I found it. Rope, nails, hammers, everything.</p>
<p>(Nick lifts up the rope and finds more hammers under it. He picks up the topmost hammer and examines it.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (softly) Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – GRISSOM'S OFFICE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Grissom walks in his office. He heads for his desk. He opens his top right-hand drawer and picks up a small wooden box.) </p>
<p>(He takes the box and walks out of his office.) </p>
<p>[INT. CSI – FORENSIC AUTOPSY – DAY -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(Grissom walks back into the room. Sara is examining the body. She doesn't look up.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Something I said?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No, dear.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I didn't offend you, did I? Did I say something offensive to you as a Catholic?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm not really a Catholic anymore, you know. I suppose I practice a kind of secular Catholicism that involves ritualizing certain aspects of everyday life and imbuing them with a spiritual intensity they might not otherwise possess, but I don't want to put too fine a point on it.</p>
<p>(Grissom opens the box and takes out rosary beads.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: And the rosary beads are a part of that.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This belonged to my mother.</p>
<p>(He holds the beads up against the bruising around Jane Doe's neck. It matches.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Take a look at this pattern.</p>
<p>(Sara leans in to look. She picks up the camera and snaps photos of the beads and bruising.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Five series of ten beads, each representing the &quot;five mysteries&quot; separated by five &quot;our father&quot; beads.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Who would strangle someone with a rosary?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Probably the same person who would crucify someone in a church.</p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN: </p>

<p>(Grissom walks out of the church and heads over to Father Frank Berlin, who is talking with a man. When he's finished, the man leaves. Father Berlin picks up the scrub brush and starts working on removing the black ink from St. Jude's back.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: St. Jude. (Frank Berlin turns around.) Patron saint of lost causes.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Berlin</strong>: And that's why it's so difficult to keep the local kids from defacing this statue. Did you run those tests on my clothes?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We did. The blood on your clothes is not a match to the blood on the victim.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Berlin</strong>: So do I get my clothes back?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Not just yet. </p>
<p>(Frank Berlin turns to leave. Grissom stops him.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I have a favor to ask.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Berlin</strong>: You steal my clothes and then you want to ask for another favor?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We'd like permission to search your rectory and the nuns' apartments.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Berlin</strong>: Just because someone dies in our church doesn't mean we have anything to do with it.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, we want to eliminate you as suspects.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Berlin</strong>: That's what you said when you fingerprinted us, and the truth is you don't have enough for a warrant.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You're right. But you have nothing to hide.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Berlin</strong>: You really think if I killed a woman, I'd leave her body in my own church?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's so obvious that it obviates suspicion.</p>
<p>(In the background Sister Bridget walks over toward them. The church bells start to ring.) </p>
<p><strong>Frank Berlin</strong>: Mmm, I'm not that smart.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, that's hardly the argument to make.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Berlin</strong>: What is it you're looking for?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Rosaries.</p>
<p><strong>Sister Bridget</strong>: Mr. Grissom, I didn't realize you were here.</p>
<p>(Frank Berlin takes the glass of water from her.) </p>
<p><strong>Frank Berlin</strong>: That's all right, Sister. We don't have to hide anything from Mr. Grissom. Uh, he's here to confiscate our rosaries. I don't know where mine are. Do you?</p>
<p><strong>Sister Bridget</strong>: It's probably in the sacristy.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We'll need all the rosaries.</p>
<p><strong>Sister Bridget</strong>: Uh, even Sister Elizabeth's? She's not going to like that.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Berlin</strong>: Happy day for Sister Elizabeth, for she delights in what she dislikes.</p>
<p>(Grissom notes Sister Bridget smiling at Father Frank Berlin.) </p>

<p>(Nick sprays the hammers. Warrick finds the matching rope ends.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: The killer used materials from the church: the rope, the 2x4s, and one of these hammers. I just haven't found it yet. But all this was in the same utility closet.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: He didn't bring anything with him?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hmm-mm.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What does this feel like to you?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Inside job.</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: I've solved your case.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Bull.</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: No, cow. Those hairs you found on the scaffold ... not human. </p>
<p>(Warrick looks at the scope.) </p>

<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Bovine.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: They have red cows?</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: You betcha, partner. Guernseys. Maybe the scaffold was used somewhere else. Like on a farm.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Or maybe it was secondary transfer.</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Well, you can take care of that. I've done all the heavy lifting. As usual.</p>

<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I saw you at the crime scene. I thought you were on desk duty until the coroner's inquest.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yeah, I was starting to get a serious case of trucker butt so I told Grissom that I wanted to, uh, get back out with the team.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, there's no therapy like work.</p>
<p>(Catherine turns and looks at Greg.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You doing okay?</p>
<p>(He motions absently to the bruises still evident on his face. It looks somewhat painful.) </p>

<p><strong>Hugo Bombay</strong>: What ... what's going on?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: You tell me.</p>
<p><strong>Hugo Bombay</strong>: I loaned my car to a woman I work with last night. She sings at my club. Charlotte Danville. Is she all right?</p>
<p>(Sofia puts a photo on the table. He looks at it. It's the victim's morgue photo. He takes a moment.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Was this your friend?</p>
<p><strong>Hugo Bombay</strong>: Yeah, that's her. (He pushes the photo back to Sofia, visibly upset by the image.) Who did ... who did this to her?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Why did she borrow your car?</p>
<p><strong>Hugo Bombay</strong>: (stares at photo) She had to ... she had to do another set and needed to change her clothes.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Doesn't she have her own car?</p>
<p><strong>Hugo Bombay</strong>: She had a Toyota Solara. Totally tricked out.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: So why did she borrow yours?</p>
<p>(He flips the photo over.) </p>
<p><strong>Hugo Bombay</strong>: I don't know. I didn't get the whole story. She seemed upset. She was talking to this guy.</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: [INT. CLUB – NIGHT] Charlotte Danville sits at a table and talks with someone. A waitress walks over and whispers to her.) </p>

<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Not without an alibi. Where did you spend the night?</p>
<p><strong>Hugo Bombay</strong>: I allowed myself to succumb to the pleasures of Donna. And she kept me up to the wee hours of the morning gratifying her abnormal lust.</p>
<p>(Marty turns around and waves to a buxom brunette sitting out in the waiting room. Donna waves back.) </p>

<p><strong>Cody White</strong>: Well, this car's already been cleaned and detailed. It's ready to be sold.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, I guess it's a change of plans.</p>
<p><strong>Cody White</strong>: No. No, there's not a change of plans. This baby's staying right where she sits. I'm not in the give-away-the-car-to-cops business. I'm in the sell-the-car-to-willing-victims business.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Mr. White, we have a court order to examine this car for evidence related to the murder of Charlotte Danville.</p>
<p><strong>Cody White</strong>: Whoa, whoa, whoa, Charlotte? She and I are friends. I ... I knew her.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, I know. We have a witness who places you arguing with her last night. You may be one of the last people to see her alive.</p>
<p><strong>Cody White</strong>: Yeah. I was with her. I went to see Charlotte to give her the car. Helped Charlotte through a rough patch, but lately she's been ducking me.</p>

<p>(They look around the living room. Catherine finds blood.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Fight must've started here. Got some blood, some here on the pillow. But no blood trail. The real beating took place in the bushes at the church.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: This was just the opening act.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Explains the bloody tissue found in the back seat of Hugo's car. I guess she got a bloody nose or a fat lip here, ran out and used Hugo's car to go to the church.</p>

<p><strong>Frank Berlin</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know, Father, when we asked you if you knew her, you said you didn't.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Berlin</strong>: After I saw Charlotte's body, I don't recall being asked any questions. Um, uh, maybe I said &quot;no&quot; to what I was seeing. I don't really remember much about yesterday.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sister, excuse me, but ... could you tell us how you managed to haul the victim's body to the top of the scaffolding?</p>
<p><strong>Sister Bridget</strong>: I used the rope and the pulley, the one the workmen use.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: But why did you kill her?</p>
<p><strong>Sister Bridget</strong>: Because she had to be stopped. She was coming for Father, and I couldn't let that happen. Now ... do your job. Arrest me.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sister, how much do you weigh?</p>
<p><strong>Sister Bridget</strong>: 123 pounds.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's a question of physics. Charlotte weighed 140 pounds, plus the weight of the cross. You don't weigh enough or have enough strength to have hoisted the body 17 feet into the air.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, you know, he told me that he broke up a fight at the shelter.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I think Sister Bridget found the bloody hammer and confessed to the murder because she thought Father Frank was guilty.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: If she thinks he did it, maybe he did it. But why does she think that he did it?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You know, his move from St. Bart's to St. Jude's involved a female parishioner who committed suicide. No charges were filed, but the parish board asked that he be removed.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I can do you one better. Catherine found two sets of semen stains on Charlotte's bedding. Unknown contributor on the bed skirt. Probably doesn't get washed as often. But the one on the sheet is a match to Father Frank. It's probably more recent. And here is the big thing: Uh, Doc Robbins says that Charlotte was about ten weeks pregnant.</p>

<p><strong>Cody White</strong>: It's like I told you before, I was helping her out. I was letting her live there and use the car till she got on her feet. She came back to Vegas broke and strung out, and I was helping her.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So it was supposed to be a short-term thing?</p>
<p><strong>Cody White</strong>: It was supposed to be short-term, but it was endless. Sort of like renovating St. Jude's.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So is that what the fight in the church was about?</p>
<p><strong>Cody White</strong>: No, that's not what the fight was about. I went to talk to him about Charlotte. I thought maybe taking the car back had something to do with her death. I don't know. Then he said something; I said ... I don't even remember, to tell you the truth. But I'll tell you this: he lost it. I've never seen Frank like that.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So do you always have personal conversations in the confessional?</p>
<p><strong>Cody White</strong>: Can't talk to him in his office with that Sister Bridget hovering around. Besides, I'd never want his relationship with Charlotte to be open to misinterpretation.</p>

<p>(Sara is in the car, wearing a mask, and spraying luminol on the car seats.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hi. I heard Grissom wants us to keep digging. This Charlotte's car?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah. I found blood smears, but they've been washed. Cody said he repo'd the car at the club and drove it back to the lot. There shouldn't be any blood in this car.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, unless Father Frank drove it that night, and we've got no reason to believe that he did.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Which brings us back to Cody.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Do you have a big enough sample for DNA?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No. But I do know one spot the detailers never hit.</p>
<p>(Sara sprays the pedal. It lights up.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Bloody shoe impression on the brake pedal.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, I'll compare it to Father Frank's shoes. If it's not a match, I'll get a warrant for Cody's shoes.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'll get a sample of the blood to DNA.</p>

[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) – DAY]</p>
<p>[EXT. HOMBRE MOTORS -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Sara and Sofia wait for Cody White to read the warrant. Cody is wearing a cowboy outfit complete with yellow hat.) </p>
<p><strong>Cody White</strong>: I'm trying to shoot a commercial here, so I don't see why this can't wait.</p>
<p>(He looks at the warrant.) </p>
<p><strong>Cody White</strong>: I can't even read this, so why don't you tell me what it is that you want?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Your boots and a DNA sample.</p>
<p><strong>Cody White</strong>: Well, there's my wife. (shouts) Candy! Get my damn lawyer on the phone now.</p>
<p><strong>Candice White</strong>: What's wrong?</p>
<p><strong>Cody White</strong>: Would ... would you just do it, please?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We found rust-colored fur on the scaffold at the crime scene.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Well, I'll call a judge and get him to amend the warrant to include the vest.</p>
<p><strong>Cody White</strong>: J-j-j-j-j-J... hold on for a minute, all right? J-Just hang on?</p>
<p>(Greg appears behind them carrying a plastic bag with cowboy boots in it.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Hey, I found these in his office. Positive for blood on the right sole.</p>
<p><strong>Cody White</strong>: Where's my wife? (shouts) Candy?!</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, Big Hombre, it looks like you're going to the hoosegow.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – INTERVIEW ROOM A -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Brass and Grissom talk with Frank Berlin.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, you don't like crucifixes, but maybe you made an exception when you found out Charlotte was pregnant, hmm?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Father ... I want you to take a look at this.</p>
<p>(Grissom puts the crime scene photo of Charlotte hanging from the rafters. Frank Berlin looks at the photo and grimaces sadly.) </p>
<p><strong>Frank Berlin</strong>: I'm responsible for her murder. I could never do that.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: In my world, Father, you're either guilty or innocent.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Berlin</strong>: Well, in my world, you can be both.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – INTERVIEW ROOM B -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Sofia interviews Cody White.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: The blood on your boot is Charlotte's. Your footprint was found on the brake pedal of her car in blood. The lab also matched hair from your fur vest to hair found dried in the blood of the victim in the church.</p>
<p>(Cody White shrugs and laughs.)</p>
<p><strong>Cody White</strong>: No matter how much evidence you have, I'm the Big Hombre. I get whatever I want, including store-bought justice.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: And yet, the one thing you couldn't get was Charlotte's love.</p>
<p><strong>Cody White</strong>: Yeah, like I said, I only saw her that last time to get the car.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [INT. CLUB – NIGHT] Charlotte sings and plays piano as Cody White listens.) </p>
<p>(She finishes and the audience applauds.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(Charlotte sits at Cody White's table.) </p>
<p><strong>Charlotte Danville</strong>: Thanks for coming.</p>
<p><strong>Cody White</strong>: Come on. I'd come every night if you wanted me to. You know that.</p>
<p>(Charlotte takes the keys out of her bag and puts them on the table.) </p>
<p><strong>Charlotte Danville</strong>: Here's the car back. You're a good friend.</p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: No, you gave her the car. You gave her everything. And how did she pay you back? She dumped you for your best friend.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [INT. CLUB – NIGHT] Charlotte puts the keys on the table.) </p>
<p><strong>Charlotte Danville</strong>: Here's the car back. And I'm moving.</p>
<p><strong>Cody White</strong>: Why would you do that?</p>
<p><strong>Charlotte Danville</strong>: I can't do this anymore. It's not right. I'm in love with another man. I'm sorry, Cody.</p>
<p><strong>Cody White</strong>: That's what you got for me? You got, you're sorry? I'm sorry, too.</p>
<p>(He angrily knocks the glass over, spilling the drink all over her dress. She gasps and stands up.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – INTERVIEW ROOM A -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Grissom and Brass talk with Frank Berlin.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We, uh, found a letter you wrote to the bishop and pulled it off your computer. &quot;The spirit has left my vocation. I've crossed a line in my discipline and committed an act unfit for the priesthood.&quot; What act is that?</p>
<p><strong>Frank Berlin</strong>: Putting my love for Charlotte above my love for God.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So, you were leaving the priesthood?</p>
<p><strong>Frank Berlin</strong>: I was leaving because I loved her, and I wanted to be with her in all ways. Her dying doesn't change that. I still love her.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [INT. CHURCH] Frank Berlin talks with Charlotte.) </p>
<p><strong>Frank Berlin</strong>: I talked to the monsignor. It's a complicated process, but I told him I'm leaving.</p>
<p><strong>Charlotte Danville</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>Frank Berlin</strong>: I prayed about it. What came to me was that God is love. Wherever there is true love, God is, as well. I have to follow my heart.</p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Frank Berlin</strong>: And we only made love once, but in the wake of that, I found the husband in me, the father in me. I wanted to be those men for her. And I always loved her.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And what if the baby wasn't yours?</p>
<p><strong>Frank Berlin</strong>: A child is always welcome.</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – INTERVIEW ROOM B -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Cody talks with Sofia.) </p>
<p><strong>Cody White</strong>: Yeah, I decorated her condo, you know that? I bought her that car. Special-ordered the paint to match the color of her eyes. She didn't care as long as she had a place to stay. That's all she cared about.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: She cared about Father Frank, didn't she? Did you suspect that she was leaving you for him?</p>
<p><strong>Cody White</strong>: Should have, but I didn't.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [INT. CHARLOTTE'S APARTMENT – NIGHT] Charlotte changed and steps out into the living room. She finds Cody sitting there.) </p>
<p><strong>Charlotte Danville</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>Cody White</strong>: Look, I'm sorry about the dress, all right?</p>
<p><strong>Charlotte Danville</strong>: I have to get back to the club.</p>
<p>(Charlotte grabs her things off the table. Cody gets up and grabs Charlotte's arm. She gasps.) </p>
<p><strong>Cody White</strong>: Wait, wait, wait. I want to know who you're leaving me for.</p>
<p><strong>Charlotte Danville</strong>: No.</p>
<p>(He slaps her. She falls backward over the chair.) </p>
<p><strong>Cody White</strong>: What is that?</p>
<p>(He sees the rosary on the floor. He picks it up.) </p>
<p><strong>Cody White</strong>: It's Frank, isn't it? (shouts) Isn't it?</p>
<p>(He uses the rosary and chokes her. She gasps.) </p>
<p><strong>Cody White</strong>: It's always been Frank.</p>
<p>(Charlotte kicks Cody off her. She scrambles to her feet.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – INTERVIEW ROOM A -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Brass and Grissom talk with Frank Berlin.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know, he doesn't think you did it. But I think that you know who killed Charlotte. He came to the church that day to confess, didn't he?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [INT. CONFESSIONAL] Cody confesses to Frank.) </p>
<p><strong>Cody White</strong>: Bless for I have sinned. My last confession was two weeks ago. I lied to my wife seven times. I cheated an old lady out of a classic car. And I killed my best friend for cheating on me with you.</p>
<p>(Frank turns and looks at Cody when he realizes what he just said.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Frank Berlin</strong>: You know I can't discuss that.</p>
<p>(Brass sighs.) </p>
<p><strong>Frank Berlin</strong>: You know, in Vegas, it's routine to hear the most heinous sins, and as a priest, you listen, and in Christ's name, you forgive.</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – INTERVIEW ROOM B -- DAY] </p>
<p><strong>Cody White</strong>: I knew she'd go running to him. She'd always run back to Frank, and I knew he wouldn't be there. He was never there.</p>
<p>(Sofia sits down.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Is that when you thought of crucifying her in Frank's church?</p>
<p><strong>Cody White</strong>: I don't know how I came up with that. You know, Frank always used to talk about the problem of human evil. How ... you better watch out 'cause it'd come into you in times of despair. Something terrible came into me that night. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [EXT. CHURCH] Charlotte is walking outside the church when Cody jumps out and hits her. She falls to the ground. He jumps over her and chokes her.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CHURCH – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Cody hammers the plyboards together. He uses the string and ties Charlotte to the make-shift cross.) </p>
<p>(As Charlotte comes to, Cody uses the pulleys to lift Charlotte and the cross up to the rafters.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Cody White</strong>: I loved Charlotte more than anything.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: The paternity test came back. You were the father. </p>
<p>(Cody turns and looks at Sofia.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: You killed your own baby.</p>
<p>(Cody cries.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) – NIGHT]</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – HALLWAY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Father Frank Berlin alone sits in the hallway. Grissom walks down the hallway toward him. From the opposite end of the hallway, officers escort Cody White out of the interview room and past Frank Berlin. Frank gets to his feet.) </p>
<p>(Cody stops in front of him.) </p>
<p><strong>Cody White</strong>: You were my friend. You should have come to me like a man.</p>
<p>(The officers lead Cody away.) </p>
<p>(Grissom watches them go. He turns and looks at Frank Berlin.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Can you forgive him?</p>
<p><strong>Frank Berlin</strong>: That's Christ's mandate. You know what that means.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You have no choice.</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>

<p>[INT. RIDGE VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL – HALLWAY -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>VARIOUS DISSOLVES OF: </p>
<p>(Three cheerleaders with their pom-poms run through the hallway.)</p>
<p>(The trophy case with various awards.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) Primitive people refused to be photographed, fearing the camera would steal their soul. </p>
<p>(Just beyond the trophy case are large photos of various high school students –<br />
Sheila Latham, Charlie Kellerman with his camera, Megan Cooper in her cheerleader uniform and Ryan Lansco in his basketball pose.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) Like any good hunter, the photographer stalks, takes aim, and shoots an image. Who's to say that when the shutter traps that moment in time those primitive fears weren't well founded?</p>
<p>(We continue past the wall and into the – </p>
<p>[INT. RIDGE VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL GYM – NIGHT – CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(A basketball game is in progress. Photographers stand on the side snapping photos of Ryan Lansco on the court.)</p>
<p>(On the sidelines is a group of photographers. The game is in timeout and the cheerleaders step out onto the court. Ryan Lansco turns and smiles at his girlfriend, Megan Cooper.)</p>
<p>VARIOUS SHOTS OF:</p>
<p>(Ryan's parents are sitting in the audience. Sheila Latham is in the stands cheering her team.) </p>
<p>(The photography teacher, Diane Kentner, helps a student take photos.) </p>
<p>(The cheerleaders continue their routine.)</p>
<p>(A camera flashes and a PHOTO is taken.) </p>
<p>Various PHOTOS SHOTS of:</p>
<p>-- Megan Cooper.<br />
-- Ryan Lansco.<br />
-- Sheila Latham. </p>
<p>(The game continues. Megan takes a seat next to Charlie Kellerman. They watch the game. The score is 42-HOME, 43 GUEST. There's ten seconds left on the clock.) </p>
<p>(The buzzer sounds and the ball is in play. Ryan Lansco gets the ball and passes to a teammate. He moves into position and gets the ball again. He shoots. He scores. Time runs out. The buzzer sounds. Game is over.) </p>
<p>(Everyone rushes out onto the court. Megan runs to Ryan. Ryan's father runs up to congratulate him.)</p>
<p>PHOTO FREEZE-FRAME: The scene is frozen and captured. Camera pulls back -- out of the gym and into the hallway.</p>
<p>(We linger on the large photos of the students hanging on the wall. The first one of Ryan Lansco – as he slowly vanishes. The second photo of Megan Cooper as she also vanishes.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – BRASS'S OFFICE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Megan's parents – Brenda and Sam Cooper – and Ryan's parents – Eddie and Linda Lansco – are in Brass's office.) </p>
<p><strong>Sam Cooper</strong>: Megan has no reason to run away. She's always been a happy kid and we trust her implicitly.</p>
<p><strong>Brenda Cooper</strong>: Captain, this is not like her. Of course it's no accident they're missing together.</p>
<p><strong>Eddie Lansco</strong>: Ryan has a scholarship to Duke. He's not going to throw it away for some chippie.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Cooper</strong>: Excuse me? &quot;Chippie?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Linda Lansco</strong>: Your daughter's the one who's calling our house twenty-five times a day.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: All right, all right, all right. This isn't helping. Now, the kids have been missing since last night. Why'd you wait till now to report it?</p>
<p><strong>Brenda Cooper</strong>: We thought that Megan was sleeping over at Sheila's.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Sheila who?</p>
<p><strong>Brenda Cooper</strong>: Uh, Sheila Latham, her best friend. When I called Megan on her cell phone this morning, I couldn't reach her, so I called the house, and, uh, she wasn't there. And Sue Latham didn't know anything about a sleep-over.</p>
<p><strong>Eddie Lansco</strong>: Ryan doesn't have a curfew. But he never stays out all night.</p>
<p><strong>Linda Lansco</strong>: He's not answering his cell phone, and his van is missing.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Cooper</strong>: Captain, please, find my daughter before she does something stupid.</p>
<p><strong>Brenda Cooper</strong>: Stupid I can live with. I need to know they're okay.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. RIDGE VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL – PARKING LOT – DAY]</p>
<p>TOP VIEW DOWN: Officer car #682 is parked across three parking stalls. </p>
<p>(Officer Mitchell walks around the car.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (from radio) The last place they were seen was the parking lot at the school after the game.</p>
<p>(Grissom is carrying his kit and headed to parking stall #42.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to phone) These two kids have only been missing for fourteen hours. They could have eloped to Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (from phone) I know it's a favor, but ...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to phone) All right. But you owe me one for getting me out of bed on a Saturday morning.</p>
<p>(Grissom hangs up and meets up with Officer Mitchell.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mitch?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Mitchell</strong>: This is Ryan Lansco's assigned parking spot. His drives a blue '72 Ford van. It's missing.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What do you want me to test?</p>
<p>(He indicates the dark drops on top of the oil spots in the middle of the parking stall.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer Mitchell</strong>: Doesn't look like transmission fluid.</p>
<p>(Grissom opens his kit and takes out his gloves.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did you have assigned parking when you were in high school?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Mitchell</strong>: No. I didn't even have a car.</p>
<p>(Grissom swabs a sample and tests it.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, it's blood. I hope they're in Mexico.</p>
<p>FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[EXT. RIDGE VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL – PARKING LOT – DAY]</p>
<p>(Nick and Grissom check the parking lot for more blood drops. More officer cars are there.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Forty may be the new twenty, but 16's the new 30, between cars and cell phones and the Internet.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, well, the world's become a very small place, Nick. All the vices are closer to home.</p>
<p>(Nick swabs a stain on the asphalt and tests it. It tests positive.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p>(Nick and Grissom continue through the ground and head toward the track field.)</p>
<p>(On the field, Nick finds some polyfill caught in the metal gate hinge.) </p>
<p>(On the track, Grissom finds more polyfill.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: More polyfill.</p>
<p>(Nick nods. Together, they continue searching for more evidence. Nick stops to check something on the track. Grissom sees blood on the football equipment.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hey, Nick?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This looks like arterial spraying. Something bad happened here.</p>
<p>(Grissom points to more blood on the equipment.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: A little blood in the parking lot, a lot of blood here. But very little in between?</p>
<p>(They look around the field. Nick sees something.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey. Look at that equipment shed door.</p>
<p>(They head over to the shed. The door is partially opened. Grissom checks the ground on his way there.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Some kind of broken glass.</p>
<p>(There's a shoe print on the door near the knob.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, this was kicked in.</p>
<p>(Grissom uses the end of his flashlight and pushes the door open. They look inside.)</p>
<p>(There's a cheerleader's top on one of the machines. There's also a jersey with<br />
‘LANSCO‘ embroidered draped on another machine.) </p>
<p>(Grissom and Nick look at each other.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – WAITING ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Sofia gives Sheila Latham a cup of something to drink. Sheila's mother, Sue, is there also.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Sheila.</p>
<p>(Sofia sits down.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Megan told her parents she was spending the night with you.</p>
<p><strong>Sheila Latham</strong>: (shrugs) But first she was ... gonna hook up ... with Ryan after the game.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Do you know where?</p>
<p><strong>Sheila Latham</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Sue Latham</strong>: Sheila ...</p>
<p><strong>Sheila Latham</strong>: What? I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Sue Latham</strong>: Excuse me? Your best friend is missing and you're at a police station. Act accordingly. And sit up straight.</p>
<p>(Sheila sits up straight.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>Sheila Latham</strong>: Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. I just have a headache.</p>
<p><strong>Sue Latham</strong>: Were you drinking last night?</p>
<p><strong>Sheila Latham</strong>: Mom, no! (to Sofia) Look ... a couple of us went out for burgers and then I came home. Megan was supposed to call me on my cell ... and I was going to go downstairs and let her in.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: And did she call?</p>
<p><strong>Sheila Latham</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: And you weren't worried?</p>
<p><strong>Sheila Latham</strong>: I thought it was just an overtime make-out session. I fell asleep. And now I'm here.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – HALLWAY – DAY]</p>
<p>(Catherine and Grissom walk through the hallway.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Both kids have an ATM card. Neither's been used since they went missing. No calls were placed from either of their cell phones. There's an APB out on Ryan's van-- no hits. An APB has gone out to local hospitals-- nothing yet. I know. It sucks.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Any calls placed before they went missing?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Where do I start? Megan and Sheila phoned each other about a dozen times. A handful of calls were placed to Charlie and Bonnie. They're both on the cheerleading squad. &quot;Hair up or down? Black socks or gold socks?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How about Ryan?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Ryan, uh, and Megan exchanged a few calls. He phoned home twice. His last call was after the game to a Diane Kentner. She is the photography teacher at the high school. Warrick is following up and ... I'm going to collect DNA exemplars from the kids' houses. My favorite part.</p>
<p>(Catherine walks away.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. RIDGE VALLEY HIGH – EQUIPMENT SHED -- DAY]</p>
<p>(Nick takes an impression of the shoe print off the shed door. Greg is gathering the jerseys off the equipment.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Wish I had one of these back in high school.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What's that? A letter jacket?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: No. No, a love shack. Back seat of my car got real old, real fast. I was getting so much play my senior year, I seriously considered getting a hearse.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, I never accused you of not being smart. Greg, you're a little weird, but ... a hearse?</p>
<p>(Nick indicates the ropes tied to the equipment.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So what's with the ropes, Casanova?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, I don't think they were working out. Looks like what started out as a good time went bad.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – TRACE LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Hodges puts the glass pieces together and takes the large piece and puts it in a dish. He puts it under a scope. Grissom walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: I'd know those footsteps anywhere. The glass you found on the track is optical glass. Camera lens, not spectacle. Camera lenses have one side that's round and one side that's flat for a high refractive index.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It bends the light more.</p>
<p>(Hodges takes the results out of the printer.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: It also has magnesium fluoride and calcium fluoride coatings for anti-reflection. </p>
<p>(Grissom looks at the test results.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: You're looking for a high-end, non-compact camera -- Nikon, Leica, or Canon -- that's missing its lens.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Thank you, David.</p>
<p>(Grissom turns to leave.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. RIDGE VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL -- HALLWAY – DAY]</p>
<p>(Warrick meets with Diane Kentner.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Warrick Brown from the Crime Lab. (They shake hands.) Thanks for coming in on a Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>Diane Kentner</strong>: Diane Kentner. I took these photographs of Megan and Ryan.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You took these.</p>
<p><strong>Diane Kentner</strong>: Yeah, I teach photography.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, that's a nice shot right there.</p>
<p><strong>Diane Kentner</strong>: Thanks. That's Charlie Kellerman. I try to take pictures of what the kids are passionate about.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So I guess he's passionate about photography.</p>
<p><strong>Diane Kentner</strong>: Yeah. That and Megan. Charlie's in love with her. She's in love with Ryan. Ryan's in love with his future. Ah, high school.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah. Did you notice any drama yesterday in class between Megan and Ryan?</p>
<p><strong>Diane Kentner</strong>: No. I mean, if a day goes by that a teenage girl doesn't cry in my class, it's a rarity. But yesterday, it wasn't Megan. And Ryan's head was already in the game. He's got a lot of pressure on him. He's oldest of six. His parents are already counting the money that he's gonna make from his first NBA contract.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hmm. Ms. Kentner, what kind of cameras do you use in class?</p>
<p><strong>Diane Kentner</strong>: We have a couple of junky ones. Students usually bring their own.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: And what about your own personal collection?</p>
<p><strong>Diane Kentner</strong>: Well, I'm old school. I mean, I took these with a Hasselblaad, but ... otherwise, I use a Minolta I've had forever. Why?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Just following up on some evidence. And Ryan called you after the game last night.</p>
<p><strong>Diane Kentner</strong>: Yeah, he wanted copies of the photos the photography club had taken.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: And he called you on your cell?</p>
<p><strong>Diane Kentner</strong>: Yeah, I put it on the syllabus. You can have it if you want.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No, thanks. I've ... I've already got it.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. RIDGE VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL – TRACK FIELD – DAY]</p>
<p>(Greg and Nick look at the football equipment.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I'm not seeing any evidence of other people. It's possible that the basketball player snapped, killed the cheerleader, took her body and drove off.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What about the busted door?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: He starts out the big romantic ...</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: Ryan is carrying Megan on his back. He kicks the door open.) </p>
<p><strong>Megan Cooper</strong>: Oh, don't break your million-dollar foot.</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Lansco</strong>: Shh.</p>
<p>(They go into the equipment room.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (V.O.) And that's when things went south.</p>
<p>(Ryan removes Megan's clothes.) </p>
<p><strong>Megan Cooper</strong>: Hey. Stop. I told you Come on. I want to wait till prom.</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Lansco</strong>: It's gonna be fun.</p>
<p>(He puts her wrists in the ropes.) </p>
<p><strong>Megan Cooper</strong>: Stop it!</p>
<p>(End of flash.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: She pushes him off, makes a run for it. But he realizes that an attempted rape charge might crash a Duke scholarship, so he chases her down and bashes her head in.</p>
<p>(Nick's phone rings. He answers it.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (to phone) Stokes. Oh, hey, Wendy. Really? Yeah, thanks.</p>
<p>(Nick hangs up.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: How does your theory account for the fact that all the blood's Ryan's?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: It doesn't.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay. Let's say I'm a Lovers Lane rapist. I stalk them. I want me a high school cheerleader. What's the first thing I do?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: You take out the basketball player. Grab her, take her somewhere more private.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Why take Ryan's body?</p>
<p>(Greg shakes his head.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (to the officers) People ... let's spiral out.</p>
<p>VARIOUS DISSOLVES OF: </p>
<p>(Nick, Greg and the officers search the field for evidence.) </p>
<p>(Nick and Greg are walking further out to the road. They find debris on the ground. Nick takes his camera out. He sees the broken glass and items.)</p>
<p>(He kneels down in front of the bloodied shoe.) </p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[EXT. RIDGE VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL – ROAD – DAY]</p>
<p>(Greg snaps photos of the debris. Grissom walks up to him.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Greg.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Accident debris. Broken turn signal light. Lots of pieces of grille for a physical match. Shoes match the description of the sneakers Megan Cooper was wearing last night.</p>
<p>(Greg picks up the shoe.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: So far, the only blood I found was on the shoes.</p>
<p>(Grissom looks over at Nick, who is headed their way.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: This road has almost no traffic at night. Take a look at this.</p>
<p>(Nick shows Grissom the tire prints.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Looks like acceleration marks.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Start out heavy, and then they fade out as the vehicle gains momentum.</p>
<p>INSERT: CLOSE-UP of tire burning rubber.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: They're in a direct line with the accident debris. That tells me it's probably related to the impact. If Megan was hit by a car, hard enough to knock her out of her own shoes, I doubt she just walked away from this.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So far there's no reports of anyone fitting Megan's description being admitted to area hospitals.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I had a friend once that got hit by this big-ass van. Knocked him like two hundred feet in the air.</p>
<p>(Grissom looks out at the area.) </p>
<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO: </p>
<p>(Nick and the officers are searching the tall grass on the side of the road. Grissom is at the top of the hill using the height to look around. He sees something.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Nick!</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Straight ahead of you about twenty yards.</p>
<p>(Nick heads off in the direction and sees the body on the ground. He starts running toward the girl.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah! Yeah, I got her.</p>
<p>(He checks for a pulse.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Is she still alive?</p>

<p><strong>Sheila Latham</strong>: Look, let's just get him in the van. I'll drive; you follow.</p>
<p>(Charlie and Sheila put Ryan in the back of the van.) </p>
<p><strong>Sheila Latham</strong>: Move. Move!</p>
<p>(They shut the door.) </p>
<p>BACK TO SCENE.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Where is Ryan?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Kellerman</strong>: (crying) I just told you everything I know. We left him in the van.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What about Megan?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Kellerman</strong>: The second we barged into that field house, she freaked out and took off. I-I didn't even know she was in the hospital until her parents called.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay, come here and take a look at this.</p>
<p>(Nick shows him the photo.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Sheila's holding the camera; you're holding the cue cards. Who's holding the light? Was there somebody else there?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Kellerman</strong>: (shakes his head) Uh-uh.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hmm? </p>
<p><strong>Charlie Kellerman</strong>: I-I was holding the light and the cue card.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Kellerman</strong>: (nods) It was just Sheila and me.</p>
<p>(Nick sits back in his seat.) </p>
<p><strong>Charlie Kellerman</strong>: And now, it's just me.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – LAB] </p>
<p>(Grissom opens the container with Sheila's crabs in it. He takes one out and extracts a sample of blood from the crab. He tests the sample.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI -- DNA LAB]</p>
<p>(Wendy shares the findings with Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Wendy Simms</strong>: Okay, we got quite the smorgasbord here. Um, the only constant from the crabs is Ryan. He's half the DNA on each of the combos. And the other contributors were Megan, Sheila, several unknowns, and everybody's favorite photography teacher, Diane Kentner. Certainly hope she gave him an A.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It proves s*x with a minor. Even if we can't get her for Megan's hit-and-run, it's enough for a search warrant.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) – NIGHT]</p>
<p>[EXT. WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Warrick and Grissom meet up with Brass and several officers outside the warehouse.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So, what you find at Diane's house?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Uh, not much, but propped up on a dresser was a rental agreement to this address and a key.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Looks like she drew us a map.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Looks like it.</p>
<p>(Brass pounds on the door.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (shouts) Diane Kentner, open up! Las Vegas Police!</p>
<p>(Warrick notes the smashed car light.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: There's our busted headlight.</p>
<p>(There's no answer.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(Brass unlocks and opens the door. He takes his gun out.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Let's go.</p>
<p>(Flashing lights come from inside the warehouse. A high-pitched whir sounds.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What the hell is that?</p>
<p>(Brass and the officer enter the warehouse. Warrick and Grissom follow.) </p>
<p>[EXT. WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(A camera clicks and whirs. Brass and the officers maneuver their way into the warehouse's main room.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hold it. Hold it. Hold it. Hold it.</p>
<p>(He holds the officers back and goes in first. Up on the sheeting on the walls are larger-than-life sized projections of Ryan Lansco.) </p>
<p>(Brass turns the corner first. He sees more projections of Ryan up on the sheeting covering the walls. A camera snaps, flashes and whines. Brass and the officers head to the back.) </p>
<p>(The camera sounds get louder. They head deeper into the warehouse.)</p>
<p>(He turns the final corridor and sees the image of Ryan dead up on the screen. They continue forward. More projections of Ryan are up on the walls.) </p>
<p>(Warrick and Grissom are the last to follow.) </p>
<p>(They turn the last corner and find DIANE KENTNER in bed with RYAN LANSCO. Both of them are dead.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Now I remember why I don't like modern art. I'm gonna go call the coroner outside.</p>
<p>(Brass turns and heads back out. The camera continues to snap, flash and whine. Warrick looks at the scene.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'm slipping, Grissom. I talked to this woman twice, and this body was here the whole time.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No one could have predicted this.</p>
<p>(Warrick picks up the empty prescription container from DIANE'S hands.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: She was on a daily dose of lithium. Bipolar.</p>
<p>(click, high-pitched whirring)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What is this, Grissom, Romeo and Juliet?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Postmortem photography-- memento mori. In the 19th century, a photo of your dead loved one was a popular keepsake. Death remembered. One last look.</p>
<p>(Up on the walls, a series of images are played out in sequential order.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p>(The images show Megan pushing Ryan.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Charlie told Nick that Sheila pushed Ryan.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Charlie lied ... to protect Megan.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. HOSPITAL – MEGAN'S ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Nick knocks on the door before entering.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: How you feeling?</p>
<p><strong>Megan Cooper</strong>: Okay, considering. Oh, my parents are in the cafeteria if you want to wait.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Oh, no, no, I'm ... I'm good. I just wanted to show you something.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What do you think about that?</p>
<p>(Nick shows Megan the photo of Megan pushing Ryan.) </p>
<p><strong>Megan Cooper</strong>: Is that me? What am I doing?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Oh, it looks like you're killing your boyfriend. You tell me. </p>
<p><strong>Megan Cooper</strong>: Who took this?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Ms. Kentner.</p>
<p><strong>Megan Cooper</strong>: Oh, come on. Obsess much?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Oh, so, you do remember?</p>
<p><strong>Megan Cooper</strong>: No. Not what happened that night. </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I wish I could get selective amnesia. There's a lot in my past I'd like to forget about.</p>
<p>(They look at each other.) </p>
<p><strong>Megan Cooper</strong>: If I did push Ryan, and he died, then that was wrong. Don't you think that I've been punished enough?</p>
<p>(Nick says nothing. He turns and leaves.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – HALLWAY – DAY]</p>
<p>(The Lanscos follow Brass through the hallway.) </p>
<p><strong>Eddie Lansco</strong>: Are you telling me you're not gonna prosecute the girl that killed my son?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The DA decided not to file. I mean, my guess is that he probably felt he couldn't get a conviction.</p>
<p><strong>Linda Lansco</strong>: Wh ... Where's the justice in that?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Everybody involved in this thing has been punished in some way. I mean, Diane and Sheila are dead. Charlie's probably going to jail, and Megan ...</p>
<p><strong>Eddie Lansco</strong>: Got away with murder.</p>
<p>(The Lanscos leave. Brass watches them go.) </p>
<p>[Intro: &quot;Good Enough,&quot; by Evanescence.]</p>
<p>[INT. RIDGE VALLEY HIGH SCHOOL – HALLWAY – DAY]</p>
<p>(A shrine of flowers has been placed under the photos of Sheila, Charlie, Megan and Ryan. The principal walks up to the photos and removes Charlie's photo. He turns and leaves. We linger on the pile of flowers against the wall.) </p>
<p>[INT. SARA'S APARTMENT – BATHROOM – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Sara picks up the straight razor off the bathroom counter. She looks in the mirror and hold up the razor.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You trust me?</p>
<p>(She turns and looks at Grissom, who has shaving lather on his beard. Sara faces him.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Intimately.</p>
<p>(He turns his head and lifts his chin slightly to the side. Sara puts her hand on Grissom's ear and raises the razor. She starts to shave off his beard and we -- </p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>

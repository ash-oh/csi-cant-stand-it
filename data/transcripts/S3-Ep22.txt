[EXT. HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL STADIUM - NIGHT]</p>
<p><strong>Lyric</strong>:<br />
[&quot;Like Her&quot;, Album: Solace, by Mandalay]<br />
I read you / god, I'm good at it / I'm so spot on / cold shapes of air / compress that dissonance / if you dare / and you breathe it in </p>
<p>(Under the bleachers, a YOUNG MAN and a YOUNG WOMAN kiss each other. She pulls away from him.)</p>
<p><strong>Young Woman</strong>: Stop.</p>
<p><strong>Young Man</strong>: (groans) Oh, come on! We've gone way further than that.</p>
<p>(He looks at her expectantly and smiles. She smiles, grabs his hand and leads him away from under the bleachers.)</p>
<p><strong>Lyric</strong>: And I'm high enough from all the waiting / to ride away when you're inhaling / and I'm high enough from all the waiting / to ride away when you're inhaling / 'cause I love you </p>
<p>(They run hand-in-hand across the field toward the opposite end of the stadium.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: They run up the bleachers and toward the announcers box.)</p>
<p>(cc) YOUNG WOMAN: Linda said you can see the strip from here.<br />
(cc) YOUNG MAN: Yeah, you can. I mean, that's what I heard, too.<br />
(cc) YOUNG MAN: Come on!</p>
<p>[INT. HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL STADIUM - ANNOUNCER BOOTH -- NIGHT</p>
<p>(The door opens. They laugh at each other. He looks inside and gasps. She looks inside and screams.)</p>
<p>(On the floor is the body of a WOMAN. There's blood on the ground and another drop of blood drips from her head to the ground.)</p>
<p>FLASH TO WHITE:</p>
<hr />
[INT. HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL STADIUM - ANNOUNCER BOOTH -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Out on the track below, cop cars are parked. Inside the booth, GRISSOM, BRASS, NICK and DAVID go over the scene. NICK puts his kit down. DAVID is already going over the body. GRISSOM stands next to BRASS and takes in the scene.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The vic's wallet was still in her purse. One credit card, couple of<br />
20s. Nebraska ID. Her name was Alison Carpenter, age 28.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: A little old for a student.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: School district has been contacted. They're checking their records.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks around. DAVID looks at her pupils.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Petechial hemorrhaging indicates strangulation.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: She definitely died here.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Yeah, lividity bears that out. She wasn't moved.</p>
<p>(BRASS turns and indicates the door behind them.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The padlock's been cut. It was rusted over, definitely not recent.</p>
<p>(NICK checks out the countertop.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Beer bottles.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, it's high school.</p>
<p>(NICK picks up a used condom.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Lover's lane.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM checks out the body and notices her hands.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Defensive wounds on her hands.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Sexual assault?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM kneels down and lifts up her dress.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: She's not wearing any underwear.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM goes back to checking the body and scene out. NICK turns to check out the countertops. GRISSOM spots something on the victim's leg. It appears to be a cut. He looks around and moves the door slightly where he sees the matching blood on the bottom of the door.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The door is pushed open and hits the victim on her leg leaving the mark. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns around and looks back at the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: David, I thought you said she wasn't moved.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Paramedics say they didn't touch her.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Kids who found her swore they didn't touch her either.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at the victim's face, the urgency building in his voice as he realizes something.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: There's still sweat on her upper lip. (to DAVID) Take a liver temperature.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Let me just finish this ... </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (firmly) Now, David.</p>
<p>(DAVID gets the digital thermometer out and gets the body's temperature.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Ninety-eight point one.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: She's been dead less than an hour.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The killer's still on her.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<hr />
[EXT. HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL STADIUM]</p>
<p>(NICK rushes by the officer cars. He's carrying a heavy duffle bag.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: NICK runs up the bleachers.)</p>
<p>[INT. HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL STADIUM - ANNOUNCER'S BOX - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(NICK turns the corner and sets the bag down next to the body. GRISSOM immediately opens the bag and they all work together to put the chamber together to build an area around the body in which to print her.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Latent prints on skin, oil on oils, we're cutting it pretty close here.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yes, we are.</p>
<p>(The frame is built.)</p>
<p>(The plastic is put over the frame and is taped down to the ground.)</p>
<p>(NICK places the cyanoacrylate fumer inside with the body. He backs away and closes the plastic around the chamber. The men stand around the frame built around the body. They each wear a mask over their faces.)</p>
<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL STADIUM - ANNOUNCER'S BOX - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(DAVID carries the duffle bag and leaves the room. GRISSOM and NICK check the body out.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM moves the head.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Nothing usable around the neck.</p>
<p>(NICK checks out her legs. He finds something.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I think I've got a partial on the ankle.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM checks it.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Very few sweat glands around the ankle. Prints survive longer. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The door is pushed back and hits the woman on her leg. The killer reaches down and grabs her ankle to move the leg. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at the victim's face again.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Fortunately for us.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY TO LAB -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(WARRICK and CATHERINE walk down the hallway. WARRICK carries a file; CATHERINE holds a bagged container of green liquid.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: There's nobody in the evidence vault. I guess we're still between shifts.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, well, we'll log it in tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You know, O'Riley interviewed the victim's wife.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: She said her husband was in the garage drinking and just &quot;done fell over.&quot;</p>
<p>(They walk into the print lab. CATHERINE opens the fumer and puts the bagged container of green liquid inside next to the burn plate. She closes the fume hood.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, the ever-popular DFO. </p>
<p>(They leave the lab and walk down the hallway.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Right up there with the &quot;mysterious dude&quot; defense.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Right. You thinking poison?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I wouldn't be surprised. Wife had two priors for spousal abuse. Seems pretty straight up to me.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, that would be nice -- an easy case.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: These double-ups are killing me.</p>
<p>(They reach the front desk where CATHERINE signs the log book on the counter.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Although I'll take it when I can get it. These nannies do not work cheap.</p>
<p>(WARRICK hands the clerk the file in his hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, how is Lindsey, by the way?</p>
<p>(They head down the hallway.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: She got caught fighting at school.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Lindsey? Fighting?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Ah, she lost her dad recently. She's just having a hard time.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. FOOTBALL STADIUM - LOT -- DAY]</p>
<p>(SARA and NICK go over the parked car next to the bleachers.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Company said the vic checked the car out three days ago. The contract was for a week.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: It's a generic econo-box. Might as well just paint a bull's-eye on it. You got the front?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(NICK looks at the back seat.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I've got a ripped-up pair of panties. Possibly the vic's. Bag that for me, will you?</p>
<p>(He hands SARA the panties and picks up the ALS.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Whoa. s*x in the backseat.</p>
<p>(SARA finds something.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Blister pack.</p>
<p>(She finds something on the car floor.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What have you got?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Ceramics, maybe?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, who's working trace tonight?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hodges.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Oh, great. Guarantee you that kiss-ass will have the results to Grissom before we do.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So I'm thinking the vic was car-jacked, dragged to a secluded location ...</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: A woman screams and is pulled into the back seat of the car. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: ... raped, murdered, body dumped. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Killer had her in the car. Easy getaway. But still, why take her all the way up the bleachers, to risk getting caught in a room with only one way out?</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY]</p>
<p>(ROBBINS goes over ALISON )</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Cause of death was asphyxiation due to strangulation. Multiple round oval bruises over the interior and lateral neck with occasional crescentic red abrasions.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Fingertip bruises and fingernail scratches.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Apparently. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No ligature marks.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: None that I could find, but take a look at this. (points to her neck)<br />
The, uh, bruises are concentrated on the left side of the neck. On the right side, there's only one.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM puts his hand over the neck marks.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Killer strangled her with his right hand. One hand only.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Yeah, prolonged pressure on the jugular.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: ALISON CARPENTER is being held up against the wall by the killer's right hand around her neck. She struggles. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He must have been looking right in her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Yeah, that takes hate. I'll get a measurement of the, uh, grip size.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What about the SART kit?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: It's on Graves' desk, but he's pretty backed up, more than usual.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Bruises on her hands, her arms, upper torso -- it's consistent with rape.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Maybe not. I did a vaginal clock on her. Signs of activity at 11:00, 12:00, and 1:00, and that would imply rough s*x, not rape.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: May have started as s*x, but it ended as murder.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<hr />
[EXT./INT. MOTEL ROOM -- DAY]</p>
<p>(BRASS and NICK check out ALISON CARPENTER'S motel room.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Alison Carpenter was a waitress at a coffee shop outside Omaha. The boss said that she asked for this week off over a month ago. And, uh, no immediate family.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Single woman on vacation in Vegas ... alone?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, weird. We're looking into it.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Who takes a tape recorder with them on vacation?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, I keep one by the bed. In case I dream anything useful.</p>
<p>(NICK looks at BRASS.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What? I can't have deep thoughts?</p>
<p>(BRASS laughs.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Just kidding.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY -- DAY]</p>
<p>(DAVID HODGES catches up with GRISSOM in the hallway. GRISSOM is reading through a file.)</p>
<p><strong>David Hodges</strong>: Hey, boss. Just analyzed the evidence found in your vic's rent-a-car.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You should be telling Nick or Sara.</p>
<p><strong>David Hodges</strong>: (brushes it aside) Yeah, couldn't find them. They must be on another break. Anyway, the blister pack is methadone. 40 milligrams, former smack addict dose. (beat) And that ceramic chip? Not ceramic. It's acrylic with a quartz resin composite used primarily in dental crowns. Cheap ones.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Good work.</p>
<p><strong>David Hodges</strong>: Yeah, thank you. Listen, I'd like to think that and I ...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Now go tell Nick or Sara.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM continues down the hallway leaving DAVID HODGES behind. He sighs.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - PRINT LAB - DAY]</p>
<p>(JACQUI FRANCO goes over the partial print with GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Jacqui Franco</strong>: Problem is AGIS doesn't play real nice with partials. So here's what I'm going to do. I'll pick eight or nine distinctive features, run those through the system, and examine anything with a 60% or better match.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You could end up with over 100 hits.</p>
<p><strong>Jacqui Franco</strong>: You trying to discourage me? It's all about interpretation. Knowing what's commonplace, and what's unique.</p>
<p>(JACQUI continues to work. The computer beeps. The monitor reads:</p>
<p>No Match<br />
4,742 Possible Matches Found</p>
<p>(JACQUI lines a portion of the print. And continues the search. The computer beeps. The monitor reads:</p>
<p>No Match<br />
501 Possible Matches Found</p>
<p>(She continues to work on the print and continues the search. The monitor reads: </p>
<p>No Match<br />
9 Possible Matches Found</p>
<p><strong>Jacqui Franco</strong>: That's where skill comes in.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You still have to check each one by hand.</p>
<p><strong>Jacqui Franco</strong>: You're going to have to sign my time sheet.</p>
<p>(JACQUI and GRISSOM look at each other.)</p>
<p>(GREG rushes into the lab excited at what he's found.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Grissom! I'm about to rock your world. The semen inside your victim --<br />
I got a DNA match through CODIS. It's Jason Kent. Ring a bell? 1987, they called him &quot;The Circle Killer.&quot;</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. APARTMENT - HALLWAY - DAY]</p>
<p>(BRASS and GRISSOM walk down the hallway toward JASON KENT'S apartment. They're accompanied by other officers.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Guy's only been out of jail six weeks.</p>
<p>(BRASS knocks on the door. JASON KENT opens it.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Las Vegas police. This a bad time?</p>
<p>(BRASS walks into the apartment.)</p>
<p>[INT. JASON KENT'S APARTMENT - DAY -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know, I know a couple of guys who worked your case. Viking circle? Remember that girl you suffocated while you were raping her? What was she, a cheerleader, homecoming queen, or both?</p>
<p><strong>Jason Kent</strong>: She was a friend.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, I didn't expect that. I expected you to say, uh, &quot;No, I'm innocent&quot; or &quot;No, it was an accident.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Jason Kent</strong>: I served my time.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: That's right. You did the whole bit. The whole fifteen years. You're a hard-core ex-con. This must really piss you off.</p>
<p><strong>Jason Kent</strong>: You know what? I know the conditions of my release. So you can check whatever you'd like. You want to tell me what this is about?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You're under arrest for the murder of Alison Carpenter. Last night, your old high school, go monarchs.</p>
<p><strong>Jason Kent</strong>: I'm not talking to you without a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Looks like you bit your lip. May I see your hands, please?</p>
<p>(JASON KENT holds out his hands. GRISSOM looks at them.)</p>
<p>Recently clipped your nails, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: And you're such a smart guy, bet you flushed them down the toilet.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM checks out JASON KENT'S bathroom. He picks up the nail clippers. Camera zooms in to note that there's some skin still attached to the clippers.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks pleased with the find.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI -- BREAKROOM]</p>
<p>(SARA sits at the table and takes her sandwich out of the bag. She takes a bite and looks up. In the hallway, GRISSOM walks with his nose in a file. He stops to sign some papers then continues on.)</p>
<p>(SARA sees this. She gets up from her seat and follows him.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY-LAB-HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM stops in the DNA lab where GREG is working.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How'd you do with the nail clippers?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Right over here. Figured it wasn't high priority since I'd already ID'd the semen in the victim.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That only proves that they had s*x. The nail clippers can place Jason Kent at the murder scene. His nails, her DNA, traces of the booth, et cetera.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Killer, victim, location.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Holy trinity, Greg. I need that.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM finishes with GREG and leaves the office.)</p>
<p>(SARA follows him.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Why bother? His semen was found inside the victim.</p>
<p><strong>Attorney</strong>: A finding from a crime unit that blows up its own DNA lab? You really think that's going to carry a lot of weight?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (over speakers): I understand you're in a methadone program.</p>
<p><strong>Attorney</strong>: So what? My client's a recovering addict. He got hooked in prison. The war on drugs works about as well on the inside as it does on the street.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, methadone puts him in the victim's car.</p>
<p><strong>Attorney</strong>: There are thousands of methadone users out there.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did our lab examine the physical evidence?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah, we pulled those records, too. The analysis had yielded a black tar heroin </p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You know, they got him on the heroin once. They didn't follow up with the trace.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So how did Jason Kent get the heroin?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Uh ... you-you know how these guys are. All they do 24/7 is figure out how to beat the system. We figure the drugs probably came from Jesus.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM reaches the reception area and someone passes him a stack of papers.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So what are we saying? Jesus sells Jason Kent heroin. Kent falls into debt, and pays him off with Alison Carpenter?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Inside the Correctional Facility's Interview Room, JASON KENT meets with ALISON CARPENTER.)</p>
<p><strong>Alison Carpenter</strong>: I'll-I'll get the money somehow. I'll work another shift, and we'll ... pay him later.</p>

<p><strong>David Hodges</strong>: Chloroform, methanol and acetone. I cleaned the pan.</p>
<p>(HODGES looks up at them.)</p>

<p><strong>Jacqui Franco</strong>: That's it.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So it's not his print?</p>
<p><strong>Jacqui Franco</strong>: Couldn't be. 'Cause it belongs to another guy. Ten points of commonality. I think I could get a couple of more, not that we need it.</p>

<p>(CATHERINE puts the plastic covering with the blue dots over the room layout.)</p>

<p><strong>Director Robert Covallo</strong>: You hadn't identified the liquid?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Not yet, no.</p>
<p><strong>Director Robert Covallo</strong>: And it was consumed in the explosion so I guess we'll never know what it was. In any event, you placed this unidentified chemical under the fume hood.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>Director Robert Covallo</strong>: Next to an active heat source.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I didn't know that at the time.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It's my responsibility. I didn't follow procedure.</p>
<p><strong>Director Robert Covallo</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Because there's 24 hours in the day and I'm pulling 16 for the county, spending three pretending to sleep and the other five lying to my daughter that everything's going to be all right.</p>
<p><strong>Director Robert Covallo</strong>: There were 13 active cases in DNA. They are all now tainted or destroyed.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What do you want to hear? I screwed up. I'm sorry.</p>

<p><strong>Lawyer</strong>: Testimony from Mickey D.? Hearsay from a gangbanger?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, there's more. You left prison without paying your tab and when Jesus sent his collection agency after you, you figured you'd pay him back just the way you did in the joint.</p>

							<p>COLD OPEN:</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>[EXT. ORPHEUS (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The limo pulls up in front of the hotel.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: A woman leans out the driver's window and hands the valet a cash tip.) </p>
<p><strong>Valet 1</strong>: Thank you. Have a good night.</p>
<p>(The woman drives away. As he heads back, a second valet walks by him on his way to his own customer.)</p>
<p><strong>Valet 2</strong>: Eagles covered, bro. Cough up the twenty.</p>
<p><strong>Valet 1</strong>: Man, backdoor touchdown. Man, kills you every time.</p>
<p>(The first valet hands the money over to the second valet. He grins and laughs as he checks the bill out.)</p>
<p><strong>Valet 2</strong>: Ha-ha!</p>
<p>(Cut back to the front door: SHERIFF RORY ATWATER and his dinner party walk out of the hotel. The women laugh at something he says. He heads over to the valet.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: [DRIVER'S POV] ADAM WATSON drives up the hotel front heading for the valet service.)</p>
<p>(Resume: VALET 2 walks toward the driver's window.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: SHERIFF RORY ATWATER tips the HEAD VALET and hands him the ticket for his car.)</p>
<p>(VALET 2 reaches the car's driver and leans in through the open window.)</p>
<p><strong>Valet 2</strong>: Welcome to the Orpheus. You checking in or just donating?</p>
<p><strong>Adam Watson</strong>: Checking in.</p>
<p><strong>Valet 2</strong>: Any bags, sir?</p>
<p>(ADAM WATSON looks at the passenger seat to indicate the carry-on next to him.)</p>
<p><strong>Adam Watson</strong>: I got this one. Grab the one in the trunk.</p>
<p>(VALET 2 walks around the back of the car. No sooner than he reaches the trunk, it explodes sending him flying high up into the air. Patrons around the area scream and duck at the unexpected attack; fire engulfs the car interior shattering the car glass. The VALET'S body lands on the asphalt with a thud.)</p>
<p>(SHERIFF RORY ATWATER watches from the side, crouched low.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. ORPHEUS - FRONT -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Emergency Personnel, Fire Units and Officer Cars assist with helping the injured. The Fire Units work on putting the car fire out.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and CATHERINE exit their vehicle and make their way toward the scene. SHERIFF RORY ATWATER speaks with a couple of members of the BOMB SQUAD. He looks up and sees GRISSOM and CATHERINE walking toward him. He turns and heads toward them.)</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Rory Atwater</strong>: Car bomb. Driver and valet are dead. Another valet is critical. Got at least a dozen injured. I was having dinner here; was on my way out. It'd gone off a couple of seconds later, you'd be picking my badge up off the ground.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Thank God you're all right. (GRISSOM points to the area behind him.)<br />
Sheriff, did they, uh, sweep the area for secondaries?</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Rory Atwater</strong>: Bomb squad says it's all clear.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (looking around) We'll photo-document the scene. Overalls from all angles. Aerials as well.</p>
<p>(Suddenly consecutive gunfire rings out in the area. GRISSOM grabs CATHERINE and pushes her toward the nearest vehicle to shield her from the gunfire. The SHERIFF ducks down and heads for the vehicle as well.)</p>
<p>(Uninjured people scream and run for cover.)</p>
<p>(The gunfire continues.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM stays where he his using his body to cover CATHERINE. The SHERIFF draws his gun and stands up looking around for the shooter.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks around.)</p>
<p>(The gunfire stops.)</p>
<p>SMASH CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. ORPHEUS - FRONT -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and SHERIFF RORY ATWATER look into the open trunk at the partially burned suitcase inside.) </p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Rory Atwater</strong>: Guess it wasn't a sniper.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (explains) Fixed ammunition in the trunk. The gunpowder must have heated up, and the, uh, rounds cooked off.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI of: Inside the back of the trunk, the suitcase is burning. Camera pushes into the suitcase where we see the box of ammunition burning. Sounds of the rounds going off as they heat up and explode. End of CGI. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE stands to the side of the car.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm going to start marking the evidence.</p>
<p>(She steps away. GRISSOM moves from the back of the car to the front as he narrates what he thinks happened.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I believe the, uh, glass pressure traveled from the rear of the vehicle, through the front ...</p>
<p>(GRISSOM reaches the driver's side shining his flashlight on the steering wheel. He moves the light down to the floor where he finds a pair of feet flat on the floor cut off at the ankles.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: ... and evidently separated the driver's body at the ankles. (louder)<br />
David, we have body parts in the car!</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: I've been looking for the feet.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I found 'em.</p>
<p>(The SHERIFF stands to the side, his arms crossed looking at what GRISSOM'S showing him.)</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Rory Atwater</strong>: We gotta ID the driver ASAP.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at the dash.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, the VIN number's still attached.</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Rory Atwater</strong>: (to the officer) Write that down. Call in the DMV.</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: (cc) Yes, sir.</p>
<p>(Cut to: DAVID PHILLIPS holds a burned hand cut off at the wrist. He gently wraps it in a white cloth.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: CATHERINE places evidence markers on the ground as she sees something worth examining further. She places evidence marker #34 on the ground next to an empty bullet casing. She straightens, takes a couple steps forward then places evidence marker #35 on the ground next to what looks like a gun.)</p>
<p>(She photographs it.)</p>
<p>(In the background, a black vehicle pulls up. NICK exits the car. He looks around, sees her and walks over to her.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Sorry, Catherine. Traffic's backed up all the way to the strip.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE picks up the gun.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Got a sig-sauer. Probably the driver's.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I'll start bagging. Gather the detritus and separate out the bomb components.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (distracted) Okay.</p>
<p>(She points the camera downward and snaps another picture.)</p>
<p>(Cut back to: The media van pulls up in front of the hotel.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Here's press. You're on. Wish I could help, but, uh, I got a vehicle to process.</p>
<p>(The SHERIFF runs a hand through his hair.)</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Rory Atwater</strong>: Come on, Grissom -- a bomb goes off these days, they're going to assume it's a hit. What are you thinking?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm not thinking. I'm just looking.</p>
<p>(The SHERIFF heads for the media vans and crew setting up their equipment.)</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Rory Atwater</strong>: (over his shoulder) That's good. Can I use that?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Camera pans across the strip to a large lit billboard on THE MEDITERRANEAN for MYLES RUEBEN, &quot;Prince of Soul&quot;.)</p>
<p>[INT. THE MEDITERRANEAN - SUITE - NIGHT] </p>
<p>(WARRICK, SARA and a detective walk into the hotel suite. There's a body floating face down in the bubbling hot tub.) </p>
<p><strong>Detective Vartann</strong>: Amelia Rueben. Twenty-five.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: She a guest? Or a guest of a guest?</p>
<p><strong>Detective Vartann</strong>: Myles Rueben's wife.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Who found her?</p>
<p><strong>Detective Vartann</strong>: About forty minutes ago, a maid walked in for &quot;turn-down&quot; service. Called hotel security.</p>
<p>(WARRICK starts taking pictures of the scene.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Still on a timer.</p>
<p>(SARA sees something. She puts her kit down and reaches into the tub to pull out a glass.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Got a wine glass.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Does Myles know?</p>
<p><strong>Detective Vartann</strong>: He's still onstage.</p>
<p>[INT. THE MEDITERRANEAN - ON STAGE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(MYLES RUEBEN is on stage singing to a thrilled audience.) </p>
<p><strong>Myles Ruben</strong>: (lyrics) hold up, slow to row / let's lay low before you go too far / remember who you are / why you want to start givin' me the third degree / all of this responsibility... /</p>
<p>[HOTEL SUITE] </p>
<p>(SARA opens her kit. WARRICK looks around the room and finds the wine bottle on the dressing table.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Got a wine bottle. </p>
<p>(He takes a picture of it, puts his camera aside and picks up the bottle to check it.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Almost empty.</p>
<p>(SARA glances over her shoulder at WARRICK.)</p>
<p>[ON STAGE]</p>
<p><strong>Myles Ruben</strong>: (lyrics)<br />
Love ain't gonna get me till I know I'm ready ... </p>
<p>[HOTEL SUITE]</p>
<p>(WARRICK glances from the bottle to SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Alcohol. Hot tub. A little bit too relaxed.</p>
<p>(Camera shot of AMELIA RUEBEN face down in the tub.)</p>
<p>[ON STAGE]</p>
<p><strong>Myles Ruben</strong>: (lyrics) ...That you see / you see / just a part of me / just a part of me ... </p>
<p>[HOTEL SUITE]</p>
<p>(ROBBINS checks the body temperature. The body is now out of the hot tub and on a gurney.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Temperature of the spa water makes liver temp irrelevant. But given the redness of her eyes, I'd estimate she's been dead less than an hour.</p>
<p>(SARA processes the hot tub buttons.)</p>
<p>(In the background, we can hear MYLES RUEBEN sing.)</p>
<p>[ON STAGE]</p>
<p><strong>Myles Ruben</strong>: (lyrics)<br />
You're having visions of happy ever after, lost in love / </p>
<p>[HOTEL SUITE]</p>
<p>(ROBBINS places the white sheet over AMELIA RUEBEN'S head, covering her.)</p>
<p>[ON STAGE]</p>
<p><strong>Myles Ruben</strong>: (lyrics) why you want the rush / why you want the rush / but yeah, I care for you / but I can't trust my heart the way that you do / 'cause when it comes/to love ... </p>
<p>[HOTEL SUITE]</p>
<p>(The CORONER'S office wheels the gurney away. SARA lifts a print off of the hot tub button.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It just dawned on me what's Rueben's biggest hit was.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What's that?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: &quot;Amelia.&quot;</p>
<p>(SARA turns and glances over her shoulder at WARRICK.)</p>
<p>[ON STAGE]</p>
<p><strong>Myles Ruben</strong>: (lyrics)<br />
Girl, love ain't gonna get me / gonna get me / till I know I'm ready / you think you know me / oh / but I'm hopin' that you see / you see / just a fantasy... </p>
<p>(Backstage, the curtains shift as WARRICK, SARA and SAM HOPKINS, MYLES' manager enter. They stand on the side and watch MYLES RUEBEN onstage.)</p>
<p><strong>Sam Hopkins</strong>: I'll handle this when Myles breaks for the encore. Been the kid's manager since '97.</p>
<p><strong>Myles Ruben</strong>: (lyrics)<br />
But I'm hopin' that you see... </p>
<p><strong>Sam Hopkins</strong>: I should be the one to tell him.</p>
<p><strong>Myles Ruben</strong>: (lyrics)<br />
Just a part of me / I'm always gonna be / just a fantasy / a fantasy. </p>
<p>(The song ends to the audience cheering and applauding. MYLES RUEBEN backs away and rushes off stage. A towel is handed to him and he walks down the steps toward SAM.)</p>
<p>[BACKSTAGE]</p>
<p>(Using the towel, MYLES dabs the sweat from his face.)</p>
<p><strong>Myles Ruben</strong>: How was that, Sam? Sound good?</p>
<p><strong>Sam Hopkins</strong>: (unenthusiastic) Great, Myles. The best.</p>
<p><strong>Myles Ruben</strong>: What? What's wrong? I missed a high note, huh? Man ...</p>
<p><strong>Sam Hopkins</strong>: No, no, no. Everything sounded great. (He glances at WARRICK and SARA) Listen, Myles, these are Crime Scene Investigators. Myles, uh ... there's been an accident.</p>
<p><strong>Myles Ruben</strong>: (panicking) An accident? What, is it my mother? Did-did something happen back East?</p>
<p><strong>Sam Hopkins</strong>: No, no, no. Your mother's fine. Look, Myles, it's, uh ...</p>
<p>(SAM falters. He looks down, unable to continue. SARA picks it up.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Mr. Rueben, I'm very sorry to have to tell you this, but your wife is dead.</p>
<p>(MYLES is stunned. He looks at SAM. SAM nods. MYLES looks around, lost.)</p>
<p><strong>Myles Ruben</strong>: (mumbling) I gotta ... I gotta ... </p>
<p>(He turns and looks back at the audience who is clapping and chanting for an encore.)</p>
<p><strong>Audience</strong>: (chanting) Amelia! Amelia!</p>
<p>(He shakes his head and turns to SAM.)</p>
<p><strong>Myles Ruben</strong>: Turn the houselights up, Sam. There's no encore tonight.</p>
<p>(MYLES walks past SAM and heads out. Everyone watches him go.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY / GARAGE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(GREG turns the hallway corner and walks into the garage where GRISSOM is working on the car.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I heard about the bombing. I'm here to help.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I located the seat of the explosion. The bomb was attached to the fuel tank. </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Gas-enhanced. Bomber maximized his bang. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM doesn't look up, but motions to under the car.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You really want to help, climb under here and find the initiation switch.</p>
<p>(INTERCUT WITH: [UNDER THE CAR] GREG is on a dolly and pushes himself under the car. He uses his flashlight to examine under the car.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM examines the car steering wheel.)</p>
<p>(GREG continues to examine under the car. He finds something.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Got a stray wire.</p>
<p>(He follows the wire.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Leading away from the gas tank, right into the center of the dash.</p>
<p>(Camera zooms to show us a close up of the frayed edge of the wire.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Nowhere near the loom.</p>
<p>(Back in the front seat, GRISSOM shifts his gaze from examining the steering wheel to the dash.)</p>
<p>(The damaged dash morphs back into its pre-explosion state. GRISSOM sees something.)</p>
<p>(Quick CGI through the digital clock in the dash in to the mechanism inside. A small jolt of electricity sets off inside the clock.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) The digital clock was the switch.</p>
<p>(The camera follows the blue electrical jolt through the wiring in the digital clock.)</p>
<p>(End of quick CGI. Resume to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It was time-activated.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: What's next?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Nick has to reconstruct the bomb.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - LAB -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(NICK empties the tray with the bomb parts onto the table. He separates the larger pieces out of the mix and sets them aside. He picks up a piece, looks at it, then sets it aside.) </p>
<p>(He picks up another piece, examines it and sets that aside next to the first piece.)</p>
<p>(He empties the contents of the second tray onto the table and sorts through those items. He examines every item piece by piece and sorts through them.)</p>
<p>(Finally, he's left with the wire. He examines the wire and sets it aside.)</p>
<p>(Camera zooms in to the group of small fragments on the table.)</p>
<p>(Quick CGI: The fragments assemble themselves to show a pipe. Inside the pipe, is the wire. Finally, the exploding cap twists onto the end of the pipe. Camera pulls away to show the pipe resting on some clay stuck to two red stands.)</p>
<p>(End of quick CGI. Resume to:</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - GRISSOM'S OFFICE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(NICK reports his findings to GRISSOM and SHERIFF RORY ATWATER.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: It was a pipe bomb. Initiated by a lightbulb filament.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Bomb was attached to the fuel tank.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: There were still magnet and solder fragments attached to the pipe.</p>
<p>(NICK shows the photo to the SHERIFF.)</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Rory Atwater</strong>: Did you find any kind of timing device?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Digital clock in the dash.</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Rory Atwater</strong>: What about the type of explosive used?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I was about to analyze the chemical residue left on the bomb frags.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Be sure to do an organics and inorganics test.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Will do.</p>
<p>(NICK leaves the office. The SHERIFF sighs, steps toward the seat in front of GRISSOM'S desk and sits down.)</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Rory Atwater</strong>: So ... what does it all mean?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What does what all mean?</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Rory Atwater</strong>: Don't play dumb with me, Gil. Explosions lead the news. I need to know who, and I need to know why.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, the evidence is only teaching us about the bomb, not the bomber.</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Rory Atwater</strong>: What about a signature? Is there anything distinct, unusual about this particular bomb?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (shakes his head) No. (thinks about it) Nothing.</p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(ROBBINS goes over the preliminary findings with SARA and WARRICK.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Amelia Rueben didn't drown. If she had, there'd be fluid in her nasal sinuses. </p>
<p>(Quick CGI to: AMELIA RUEBEN face-down in the water. Her head is submerged under the water. Camera zooms in toward her nose and in through her nose to show her sinuses. Water fills up the sinuses.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (V.O.) Clear as a bell.</p>
<p>(End of quick CGI. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What was the cause of death?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>(WARRICK opens and references back to the file folder.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (surprised) She was only 25. Was there some kind of defect?</p>

<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: Relatively nondescript. Uh, the blue stuff, sent a sample to Trace. Pretty sure it's from some sort of bag that melted in the explosion.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Right. And the bullets from the Camaro's trunk?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: A-ha. Pre-fragmented ammo. Now they're unique. Exemplar's under the magnifier. </p>

<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: It's designed to enter a target, but not exit.</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: A bullet is fired from a gun and impacts through a clothed target. The shirt disappears to reveal the chest and an x-ray view of the chest. The camera angle turns sideways to show the bullet enter the chest and dissipate inside the body.)</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: ... but not the plane.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: Right. Nowadays, magsafes are sold commercially, but there's really not much of a market. So chances are, your driver's a Federal Air Marshal.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: All right, let's talk about drinking. There was a bottle of wine found near the tub. Did you have a drink with her?</p>
<p><strong>Sam Hopkins</strong>: No. Never. I don't touch it. I'm on call 24/7. Myles can pick up the phone, have me do anything, anytime. Fly to L.A., pick someone up at the airport. </p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So you're saying the bomb was already in the car when he drove out? Well, that can't be. According to the manager, the Camaro was only in the lot for, uh, nine minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, it takes longer than that to hard-wire a bomb. Which can only mean that the bomb was already in the car when it was returned.</p>

<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Hey, got the DNA results back from that bloody band-aid that Grissom found at Dunbar's apartment. Compared it to his DNA. Not a match. But I did find seven alleles in common.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: His son.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: No. It's female. Mother, sister, daughter.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, according to his wife, his mother's deceased. He's an only child. So, that leaves a daughter. Well, there's no way there was a kid at that apartment.</p>
<p><strong>Ronnie Litre</strong>: Well, maybe she was living in Henderson.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Forget &quot;secret agent.&quot; Roger Dunbar was living a secret life.</p>

<p>(They turn and see her.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Good evening. We're with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.</p>
<p><strong>Debbie Dunbar</strong>: Oh, god. Did something happen to my husband? He was supposed to be home on Monday night. I've been calling his cell. He's not at work.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Is this your husband?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE holds out a copy of ROGER DUNBAR'S Nevada Driver's License. She takes it from her.)</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You're currently married to him?</p>
<p><strong>Debbie Dunbar</strong>: Yes. What is going on?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks over at the trash bin.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, your husband is a suspect in a criminal investigation. Currently, he's in police custody.</p>

<p><strong>Amy Dunbar</strong>: Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Which side do you want?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'll take the west wing.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It's a nice place.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p>(SARA walks toward the bar area and opens the cabinet. She looks inside, then closes the cabinet.)</p>
<p>(WARRICK looks around the living room.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You could record a whole album in this studio.</p>

<p>(SARA looks up and heads back to the living room. WARRICK shakes his head, then looks around again.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I don't know, I think it sounds kind of isolating, living in a fishbowl.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Wouldn't be isolated. You'd have a butler, a maid service, laundry service.</p>
<p>(He picks up some staff paper.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Sheet music. Guy writes his own stuff.</p>
<p>(Under it, he finds a pair of yellow rubber gloves.)</p>

<p><strong>Myles Ruben</strong>: Yeah. I use it to clean my windows.</p>

<p><strong>Myles Ruben</strong>: I write songs late at night. Windows are my chalkboard.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [LIVING ROOM] AMELIA sits on the bar counter leafing through a magazine as MYLES writes.)</p>

<p><strong>Myles Ruben</strong>: (singing) ...clearly see... </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Mr. Rueben ... your wife was poisoned. We suspect window cleaner was slipped into her wine.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Did you have a fight?</p>
<p><strong>Myles Ruben</strong>: Not lately.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: But you have had fights in the past.</p>
<p><strong>Myles Ruben</strong>: Who doesn't? I mean, fighting, loving, laughing ... it all comes from the same place, man. It's passion. And we loved each other passionately.</p>
<p>(He shakes his head as he remembers.)</p>
<p><strong>Myles Ruben</strong>: When we met, it was Fate.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: MYLES RUBEN is on stage. He speaks out to the audience.)</p>
<p><strong>Myles Ruben</strong>: But you know what I need right now? I need a woman. I need a woman to come up here and be my inspiration. </p>
<p>(He points into the audience at AMELIA.)</p>
<p><strong>Myles Ruben</strong>: You, baby. Second row. Come on up here.</p>

I can see by the love in your eyes / you've been hurt by love / so it's hard for you to trust a guy ... </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Myles Ruben</strong>: I was looking for love. She was looking for the same thing. She loved my music. I loved her smile.</p>
<p>(SARA turns and looks at WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Myles Ruben</strong>: It's hard being on top, you know? I mean, everybody loves you. Wants their piece. That's why we fought. I mean, all the time. Every night. She knew she could never have me to herself. (He starts to loose it, but composes himself.) Look, I got sound check for the late show in an hour. Can I go?</p>

<p><strong>Detective Vartann</strong>: Room service guy's out. He left before the cork was popped.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So, did Myles kill Amelia and the manager's covering for him or did the manager kill Amelia and Myles doesn't have a clue?</p>

[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM] </p>
<p>(BRASS shows copies of both marriage to ROGER DUNBAR.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Bigamy is a Class D Felony. If convicted, you could be sentenced from one to four years in prison, do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>Roger Dunbar</strong>: I'd just married Beth, when I met Debbie. She was a student. UNLV. She got pregnant. I did the right thing. Ever since, it's been Monday through Friday with Debbie and weekends with Beth. They both think I travel for a living. </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I know I keep coming back to this, but, uh ... I mean, I got to ask you. What's with the empty apartment? Do you have a girlfriend on the side as well?</p>
<p><strong>Roger Dunbar</strong>: No.</p>
<p>(ROGER turns to his lawyer, RANDY PAINTER, and they confer.)</p>
<p><strong>Randy Painter</strong>: Just tell them the truth.</p>
<p>(ROGER turns back to BRASS and CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Roger Dunbar</strong>: My life is really a balancing act. Early on, I took Debbie to dinner and Beth saw it on a credit card statement. So instead of a P.O. Box, I figured why not rent a cheap apartment, you know? Have a night to myself once in a while.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We found a band-aid with your daughter Amy's blood at your apartment. So, you bring your daughter there, but not your wives?</p>
<p><strong>Roger Dunbar</strong>: Oh, no. It's not like that. You know how kids are.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: AMY DUNBAR is wearing a helmet. She runs up the sidewalk toward her dad as she holds out the band-aid in her hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Amy Dunbar</strong>: Dad, take this. It keeps falling off.</p>
<p>(He tucks the band-aid in his pocket.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Roger Dunbar</strong>: I emptied my pockets at the apartment.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mr. Dunbar, we collected both of your children's volcanoes and supplies. And we found a pair of pliers at your home in Henderson. Those pliers were used to make both of the volcanoes.</p>
<p><strong>Roger Dunbar</strong>: That's right. I needed pliers in Henderson, so I borrowed Beth's pliers from Mesquite.</p>
<p><strong>Randy Painter</strong>: There's no crime in that.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm just really confused. Um ... your wife, Beth, told us that you couldn't build a volcano to save your soul. Yet your wife, Debbie, claims that it was all you that made your daughter's volcano. So, what is it?</p>
<p><strong>Roger Dunbar</strong>: Well, I watched Beth when she made Timmy's volcano. So, then when Amy had a science project, I knew the drill. Now, granted, it wasn't as symmetrical as Beth's and the lava flow was a little anemic, but ... Amy liked it.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: When did you borrow those pliers?</p>
<p><strong>Roger Dunbar</strong>: I don't know. Couple weeks ago. Why?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You never returned them to your wife, Beth?</p>
<p>(He puts a hand to his mouth as he realizes his mistake.)</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey. I dusted the bottle. I got prints.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I've got burns. You first. Sam or Myles?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Amelia's.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - MORGUE] </p>
<p>(The table with AMELIA on it is pulled out. WARRICK and SARA walk into the room. WARRICK puts on a pair of gloves.) </p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: This should just take a second. Could you give me her right hand, please?</p>
<p>(ROBBINS shows the back of AMELIA'S hand. WARRICK holds out the glove. They find correlating burns to match the holes in the glove.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Three acid burns.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: This is not a murder. It's a suicide.</p>

<p><strong>Myles Rueben</strong>: I knew she wasn't happy. I guess I just didn't pay attention.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You shouldn't blame yourself for this.</p>
<p><strong>Myles Rueben</strong>: Shouldn't I? Why shouldn't I? I spend most of my time making them happy. I never ... I never took the time to make her happy.</p>
<p>(Out in the show room, the audience chants for MYLES.)</p>
<p><strong>Audience</strong>: (chanting) Amelia, Amelia!</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We found these pliers in your car's glove box. You used them to fix the hose bib. And to ... make a bomb.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mrs. Dunbar ... how long have you known about Roger's double life?</p>
<p><strong>Beth Dunbar</strong>: His other wife's name is Debbie. Once or twice a year he'd call me by that name. I ignored it. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's very difficult for two people to live a lie, let alone three.</p>
<p><strong>Beth Dunbar</strong>: Look, when Roger and I were together, he was a good husband. Terrific father. It was almost like being in a state of suspended honeymoon. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Really? So what changed?</p>
<p><strong>Beth Dunbar</strong>: He asked me to get his dirty laundry out of the trunk of his car.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: BETH opens the car trunk and reaches in to get the laundry. She also sees the bag next to it.)</p>
<p><strong>Beth Dunbar</strong>: (V.O.) There was a plastic bag with all the makings of a volcano. Including the stars I had hand-cut for my son. </p>
<p>(She reaches into the bag and picks up the gold stars.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Beth Dunbar</strong>: I'd always suspected there was another woman, but never ... another family. So. Two weeks ago Sunday, I followed him. He, uh, dropped off his rental car and walked to some apartment building. Then he changed his clothes, and got into a nicer car, and drove out to Henderson.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Why didn't you just leave him? Turn him in? </p>
<p><strong>Beth Dunbar</strong>: He made a fool out of me. A mockery of our life.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mrs. Dunbar, you killed three innocent people.</p>
<p><strong>Beth Dunbar</strong>: (shakes) That was never my intention. That bomb was supposed to go off at 8:30 on his way to the airport.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Why a bomb?</p>
<p><strong>Beth Dunbar</strong>: It, it's not much harder to make a bomb than a volcano.</p>

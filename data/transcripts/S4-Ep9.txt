Valet 2: Eagles covered, bro. Cough up the twenty.
Valet 1: Man, backdoor touchdown. Man, kills you every time.

Valet 2: Ha-ha!





Valet 2: Welcome to the Orpheus. You checking in or just donating?
Adam Watson: Checking in.
Valet 2: Any bags, sir?

Adam Watson: I got this one. Grab the one in the trunk.






Sheriff Rory Atwater: Car bomb. Driver and valet are dead. Another valet is critical. Got at least a dozen injured. I was having dinner here; was on my way out. It'd gone off a couple of seconds later, you'd be picking my badge up off the ground.
Grissom: Thank God you're all right. 
Sheriff, did they, uh, sweep the area for secondaries?
Sheriff Rory Atwater: Bomb squad says it's all clear.
Catherine:  We'll photo-document the scene. Overalls from all angles. Aerials as well.






SMASH CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS




 
Sheriff Rory Atwater: Guess it wasn't a sniper.
Grissom:  Fixed ammunition in the trunk. The gunpowder must have heated up, and the, uh, rounds cooked off.


Catherine: I'm going to start marking the evidence.

Grissom: I believe the, uh, glass pressure traveled from the rear of the vehicle, through the front ...

Grissom: ... and evidently separated the driver's body at the ankles. 
David, we have body parts in the car!
David Phillips: I've been looking for the feet.
Grissom: I found 'em.

Sheriff Rory Atwater: We gotta ID the driver ASAP.

Grissom: Well, the VIN number's still attached.
Sheriff Rory Atwater:  Write that down. Call in the DMV.
Officer:  Yes, sir.




Nick: Sorry, Catherine. Traffic's backed up all the way to the strip.

Catherine: Got a sig-sauer. Probably the driver's.
Nick: I'll start bagging. Gather the detritus and separate out the bomb components.
Catherine:  Okay.


Grissom: Here's press. You're on. Wish I could help, but, uh, I got a vehicle to process.

Sheriff Rory Atwater: Come on, Grissom -- a bomb goes off these days, they're going to assume it's a hit. What are you thinking?
Grissom: I'm not thinking. I'm just looking.

Sheriff Rory Atwater:  That's good. Can I use that?



 
 
Detective Vartann: Amelia Rueben. Twenty-five.
Warrick: She a guest? Or a guest of a guest?
Detective Vartann: Myles Rueben's wife.
Sara: Who found her?
Detective Vartann: About forty minutes ago, a maid walked in for &quot;turn-down&quot; service. Called hotel security.

Sara: Still on a timer.

Sara: Got a wine glass.
Warrick: Does Myles know?
Detective Vartann: He's still onstage.
 
 
Myles Ruben:  hold up, slow to row / let's lay low before you go too far / remember who you are / why you want to start givin' me the third degree / all of this responsibility... /
 
 
Warrick: Got a wine bottle. 

Warrick: Almost empty.


Myles Ruben: 
Love ain't gonna get me till I know I'm ready ... 


Warrick: Alcohol. Hot tub. A little bit too relaxed.


Myles Ruben:  ...That you see / you see / just a part of me / just a part of me ... 


Robbins: Temperature of the spa water makes liver temp irrelevant. But given the redness of her eyes, I'd estimate she's been dead less than an hour.



Myles Ruben: 
You're having visions of happy ever after, lost in love / 



Myles Ruben:  why you want the rush / why you want the rush / but yeah, I care for you / but I can't trust my heart the way that you do / 'cause when it comes/to love ... 


Warrick: It just dawned on me what's Rueben's biggest hit was.
Sara: What's that?
Warrick: &quot;Amelia.&quot;


Myles Ruben: 
Girl, love ain't gonna get me / gonna get me / till I know I'm ready / you think you know me / oh / but I'm hopin' that you see / you see / just a fantasy... 

Sam Hopkins: I'll handle this when Myles breaks for the encore. Been the kid's manager since '97.
Myles Ruben: 
But I'm hopin' that you see... 
Sam Hopkins: I should be the one to tell him.
Myles Ruben: 
Just a part of me / I'm always gonna be / just a fantasy / a fantasy. 



Myles Ruben: How was that, Sam? Sound good?
Sam Hopkins:  Great, Myles. The best.
Myles Ruben: What? What's wrong? I missed a high note, huh? Man ...
Sam Hopkins: No, no, no. Everything sounded great.  Listen, Myles, these are Crime Scene Investigators. Myles, uh ... there's been an accident.
Myles Ruben:  An accident? What, is it my mother? Did-did something happen back East?
Sam Hopkins: No, no, no. Your mother's fine. Look, Myles, it's, uh ...

Sara: Mr. Rueben, I'm very sorry to have to tell you this, but your wife is dead.

Myles Ruben:  I gotta ... I gotta ... 

Audience:  Amelia! Amelia!

Myles Ruben: Turn the houselights up, Sam. There's no encore tonight.


 
 
Greg: I heard about the bombing. I'm here to help.
Grissom: I located the seat of the explosion. The bomb was attached to the fuel tank. 
Greg: Gas-enhanced. Bomber maximized his bang. 

Grissom: You really want to help, climb under here and find the initiation switch.



Greg: Got a stray wire.

Greg: Leading away from the gas tank, right into the center of the dash.

Greg: Nowhere near the loom.



Grissom:  The digital clock was the switch.


Grissom: It was time-activated.
Greg: What's next?
Grissom: Nick has to reconstruct the bomb.

 
 





(End of quick CGI. Resume to:


Nick: It was a pipe bomb. Initiated by a lightbulb filament.
Grissom: Bomb was attached to the fuel tank.
Nick: There were still magnet and solder fragments attached to the pipe.

Sheriff Rory Atwater: Did you find any kind of timing device?
Nick: Digital clock in the dash.
Sheriff Rory Atwater: What about the type of explosive used?
Grissom: Not yet.
Nick: I was about to analyze the chemical residue left on the bomb frags.
Grissom: Be sure to do an organics and inorganics test.
Nick: Will do.

Sheriff Rory Atwater: So ... what does it all mean?
Grissom: What does what all mean?
Sheriff Rory Atwater: Don't play dumb with me, Gil. Explosions lead the news. I need to know who, and I need to know why.
Grissom: Well, the evidence is only teaching us about the bomb, not the bomber.
Sheriff Rory Atwater: What about a signature? Is there anything distinct, unusual about this particular bomb?
Grissom:  Nothing.





 
 
Robbins: Amelia Rueben didn't drown. If she had, there'd be fluid in her nasal sinuses. 

Robbins:  Clear as a bell.

Sara: What was the cause of death?
Robbins: Cardiac arrest.

Warrick:  She was only 25. Was there some kind of defect?
Robbins: No, her heart was in perfect condition. In fact, I have it over here. 

Robbins: See the myocardium? There's no evidence of hemorrhage, infarct or scarring. No coronary occlusions. I can't explain it.
Warrick:  It's like a mystery of the heart.


 
 
Bobby Dawson: So, that sig-sauer you found ...
Catherine: Yes.
Bobby Dawson: Relatively nondescript. Uh, the blue stuff, sent a sample to Trace. Pretty sure it's from some sort of bag that melted in the explosion.
Catherine: Right. And the bullets from the Camaro's trunk?
Bobby Dawson: A-ha. Pre-fragmented ammo. Now they're unique. Exemplar's under the magnifier. 

Bobby Dawson: Copper jacket contains lead shot sealed with a clear epoxy plug.
Catherine: I've never seen anything like that.
Bobby Dawson: It's designed to enter a target, but not exit.


Catherine: Penetration, not perforation. Why?
Bobby Dawson: Well, say you're on a commercial flight. Plane gets hijacked. US Air Marshal needs to take down the hijacker ...
Catherine: ... but not the plane.
Bobby Dawson: Right. Nowadays, magsafes are sold commercially, but there's really not much of a market. So chances are, your driver's a Federal Air Marshal.

 



Sara: It's a match. PRT on the hot tub dial was Sam Hopkins.
(Monitor shows the following information:
SAM HOPKINS
493 PYRAMID WAY
LAS VEGAS, NV
Manager for Myles Ruben
No prior Criminal Record
&lt;&lt;File 02157.5784&gt;&gt;
Warrick: Rueben's manager? Amelia was butt-naked in the hot tub. What was he doing in her room tweaking dials? 
Sara: While her husband's onstage?

Greg: Spectroscopy just got back. Hydrofluoric acid in her system.
Sara: Isn't that an industrial solvent?
Greg: High-powered stuff. Mainly used to remove rust, clean glass, brighten aluminum, dissolve silicas ... and commit murder. 
Warrick: She was poisoned. That would explain her heart attack.

 
 
Sam Hopkins: You're killing me, Jimmy. You're killing me. All night the spotlight was off. Way too hot on his face. It's too hot on me right now. They guy's not Wayne Newton, all right? Can you see it on my face, Jim? I need ... Jimmy. Thank ... I need a cast shadow on him for all the love songs.

Warrick: Mr. Hopkins, could you answer the question, please.

Sam Hopkins: Sorry.

Sam Hopkins: Yes, I was in Amelia's room. I'm in there all the time. We're like family.
Sara: We know you were close. Do you always turn on the hot tub for her?
Sam Hopkins: I represent one of the biggest headliners in town. Wear a lot of hats: Manager, marriage counselor, confidante. I kept Myles happy by keeping her happy.

Sam Hopkins: Amelia, anything else I can get for you?


Sam Hopkins: Look, sweetheart. Here's how this works. You give him his space, he sings his heart out. Honey, we all prosper. Let me set up a dinner for you two -- quiet, alone -- after the show.
Amelia Ruben: No work. Never happen.
Sam Hopkins: Relax.

Sam Hopkins: Give me an hour.


Warrick: But you must admit, the boss' wife, naked in a hot tub, looks kind of funky.
Sam Hopkins: Look at me. Do I look like a threat? The reason I've succeeded in this business, I don't squat where I eat, you know what I mean?
Sara: All right, let's talk about drinking. There was a bottle of wine found near the tub. Did you have a drink with her?
Sam Hopkins: No. Never. I don't touch it. I'm on call 24/7. Myles can pick up the phone, have me do anything, anytime. Fly to L.A., pick someone up at the airport. 
Warrick: So, you'd do just about anything for him then?
Sam Hopkins: When it comes to Myles, yeah. What's this all about?
Sara: Mr. Hopkins, Amelia didn't drown. She was poisoned.
Sam Hopkins: Poisoned? By who?
Warrick: That's what we're trying to find out.

 
 
Brass: According to the DMV, the Camaro was one of yours, is that right?
Manager: Yeah, it was rented to an Adam Watson. Waived insurance. Government discount.
Brass: Well, we have reason to believe Mr. Watson was a US Air Marshal.
Manager: Right. How could I forget him? He threw it in my face when I told him we were out of compacts.

Adam Watson: I'm a US Air Marshal, okay? I travel for a living. I don't need this crap.

Brass: But you found him a car.

Manager: I'll put you in a full-size and won't charge you for the difference.
Adam Watson:  No, forget it. 

Adam Watson: I'll take the Camaro.

Brass: What time was that?
Manager: Vehicle entered the lot at 9:31 P.M. Mr. Watson drove out nine minutes later.
Brass: Thanks a lot.

Manager: The Guy worked for Homeland Security. You think maybe some terrorist blew him up?
Brass:  You'll be the first to know.

Brass: Well, it's been confirmed. The driver, Adam Watson, was a Federal Air Marshal.
Grissom: So, one of us needs to call the Sheriff.
Brass: I'll flip you for it.
Grissom: Well, before we make that call, what time did the Air Marshal drive off the lot?
Brass: Nine-forty. Why?
Grissom: Well, the bomb went off thirty minutes later. It takes that long to get from here to the Orpheus.
Brass: So you're saying the bomb was already in the car when he drove out? Well, that can't be. According to the manager, the Camaro was only in the lot for, uh, nine minutes.
Grissom: Well, it takes longer than that to hard-wire a bomb. Which can only mean that the bomb was already in the car when it was returned.
Brass: So, who rented the car before him?


Brass:  Roger Dunbar! Open up! Las Vegas police!
 
 

(The OFFICERS walk out of the rooms and reholster their guns.
Officer: Clear.
Brass: Stand down.

Brass: Good job, guys.

Brass: Okay, well. This guy was obviously on a week-to-week lease.


Catherine: Left some clothes behind ... and a paper shredder. I'll bag it.)


Brass: No sign of any bomb-making material. I'll go check the garage.




Catherine: &quot;Dr. Amerian, 4:00 P.M.&quot; Oh, today. 

Catherine: I'll make an appointment.
FADE OUT


;



 

 
Roger Dunbar: You drag me out of my dentist's office. You throw me in a squad car. Now you're accusing me of planting a car bomb?
Brass: Mr. Dunbar, you rented a Camaro from thrift rite rental. Returned it last night, 9:30 P.M. It blew up a half an hour later in front of the Orpheus.
Roger Dunbar:  It's all over the news. That was my Camaro?
Brass: Yeah.
Roger Dunbar: But this is crazy. 
Brass: So, what happened? You have a beef with the rental car company?
Roger Dunbar: No. I-I get double miles. I'm a premier card member.
Brass: Oh, I'm sure you are.
Roger Dunbar: You know what, I'm not saying another word without an attorney.
Catherine: That's your right, Mr. Dunbar.

Catherine: Warrant for your clothes.

Catherine: Strip. Everything in the bag.


 
 

Nick: ID'd the explosive.
Grissom: Ammonium perchlorate.
Nick: Yeah, rocket fuel. GCMS picked up the other half of the equation-- gasoline.
Grissom: Combination of the two creates an unstable mass. Both shock-and friction-sensitive.
Nick: Ammonium perchlorate's available at any chemical supply store. You can gas up on every corner. Anyone could've made this bomb.

Grissom: Sheriff? What can we do for you?
Sheriff Rory Atwater: Need a little clarification. I know Captain Brass has a suspect in custody. Where it get a little hazy for me, is I'm not getting his connection to the Air Marshal.
Grissom: Well, it's entirely possible that Mr. Watson was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Sheriff Rory Water: Another thing, you said that the switch was a digital clock. The bomb had been set to go off at a designated time, right? How do we get a wrong time?

Nick: I can answer that, too.

Nick: Take a look.

 of the frayed wire.
Grissom: Short in the wire.
Nick: Compromised the timing device. Made the bomb unpredictable.
Grissom: We may never know when that bomb was supposed to explode.

 
 
Warrick: I got your page. You'd be a good maitre d'. Checking glassware for spots?
Greg: You know, a hot tub is just like a dishwasher. Washes away all of the impurities.
Warrick: Including hydrofluoric acid, huh?

Greg: '93 pinot.  I found trace amounts of hydrofluoric acid in the vino.
Warrick: So, somebody did spike the wine.
Greg: Oui.

 
 
Warrick: We just want to know what happened the other night. Did you open the bottle for her?
Room Service Waiter: Hey, Amelia requested me. I was up there every night. I hooked her up. And she wasn't drinking no Italian Rotgut either. She was ordering '93 pinot from Russian River Valley. That's three-fifty a bottle, twenty percent delivery charge. You do the math.
Sara: Was anyone there with her?
Room Service Waiter: No.
Sara: What about Sam Hopkins?
Room Service Waiter: No, that mutt wasn't there.
Warrick: &quot;Mutt&quot;?
Room Service Waiter: Yeah, that manager scumbag. You bring a bottle of wine when he's there, forget about it. He signs for the bill and stiff city. Now, when the Prince of Soul is there, that's a different story. He'd give you $500 just to get lost.
Sara: But you didn't see Myles the other night?
Room Service Waiter: Yeah, I saw him for a sec. He came in between shows. He showed me the door.

Myles Ruben: Whoa, whoa, whoa. My man.

Myles Ruben: There's only one man who practices chivalry around here, and it ain't you, Ducky.


Room Service Waiter: Hey, I could tell they were in love, you know? But he was never around. I mean, I felt bad for Amelia. She'd have four times a night.
&quot;You forgot the fork. Can you bring some salt? How about some ice?&quot; If you ask me, I'd say she was lonely.
Warrick: Did you ever see them fight?
Room Service Waiter: No, but I heard 'em. And I'm sure 2202 and 2206 heard
'em, too. Hey, but I don't bite the hand that feeds me.

Warrick: Thanks.

AMMONIUM PERCHLORATE


 
 
Catherine: There was rocket fuel in the bomb and rocket fuel on your t-shirt.
Randy Painter:  That you need to explain.
Roger Dunbar: Well, I'm not really sure, but my son, he's got this science project due. You're right, I'm not supposed to help, but, really, all the parents do. We made a volcano. Spilled some of the chemicals.
(Quick flashback to: ROGER DUNBAR adds the chemicals to the volcano. It bubbles, sizzles, and gurgles as liquid pours out from the top. Then it spurts
- all over his shirt.)

Brass: We've been to your apartment. What volcano? What kid?
Roger Dunbar: Timmy. Third grade. Mesquite Elementary.
Brass: You're divorced?
Roger Dunbar: No. No, well, look, here's the situation is the family, they live in Mesquite, and I'm there on the weekends.
Brass: And during the week?
Roger Dunbar: I-I'm in sales, so I travel all over the country.
Randy Painter: Which is why he rents a car when he's in town. It's cheaper than leasing.
Brass: Cheaper. All right, but it still doesn't explain the empty apartment.
Roger Dunbar: Look, I... like being married. I ... love my wife, my kid, but ... I need my space. I-I-I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings, so I just tell them that I'm out of town even when I'm not.
Brass: We're going to need your home address.
Roger Dunbar: No, look ... I'm begging you. Please don't blow things for me with the wife.

 
 
Timmy Dunbar: Mom, what's going on?
Beth Dunbar: I don't understand.
Catherine: Mrs. Dunbar, could you and your son wait outside, please?
Officer: Ma'am, come with me. I'll fill you in.



Grissom: Catherine, there is a volcano on the table.

Grissom: Aluminum powder. Polyvinylbutadiene. Ammonium perchlorate.
Catherine:  The three ingredients to make lava flow.

Catherine: In fifth grade, I built one of these as my science fair project. It was awesome. First place should've been mine. But they ended up giving it to this kid with some lame red ant colony.

Catherine:  That was you.
Grissom: Yeah, only my ants were Black Argentinians.
Catherine: Uh-huh.
Grissom: I learned at a very early age that the bugs always win.
Catherine: Right.


 
 
Beth Dunbar: Trust me, Roger didn't build a bomb. I love my husband, but he's inept. Just last week, the hose bib cracked. Front yard was a river. Roger was helpless till I got home.
Catherine: Well, what about that volcano? Your husband said that he helped your son build it.
Beth Dunbar: He watched. I'm a teacher. Timmy knows which parent to go to for help.
Catherine: Mrs. Dunbar, your husband told us that he was in sales.
Beth Dunbar: He's with the State Department. You know, all that sensitive government stuff. Keeps him on the road. He doesn't say much about it.
Catherine: As far as you know, has he talked about his job with anyone else? Any other family members? Friends?
Beth Dunbar: His parents are dead. Roger's an only child. He doesn't have time for friends. There was this one night, years ago. We were both a little drunk and ...  Roger confessed he was CIA.


 
 
Nick: Hey, I made one of those in third grade. Science fair. Should have won, too.
Grissom: Got to let it go Nick.
Nick: Bomb end-cap with tool marks. Given the orientation and spread of the marks, consistent with pliers, vise-grips.
Grissom: There were no vise-grips in the Dunbars' toolbox.
Nick: Hmm.
Grissom: But given that the bomb and the volcano were similarly constructed ...
Nick: We can compare the tool marks on both end-caps. Doesn't matter what you make; it's what you make it with.

Grissom: Not even close.
Nick: Mm-mm. So, whatever tool made the volcano did not make the bomb.

 
 
Ronnie Litre: Okay, I reconstructed the contents of the paper shredder. Five bills. All in Roger Dunbar's name. Addressed to 2175 La Pressa.

Catherine: His son.
Greg: No. It's female. Mother, sister, daughter.
Catherine: Well, according to his wife, his mother's deceased. He's an only child. So, that leaves a daughter. Well, there's no way there was a kid at that apartment.
Ronnie Litre: Well, maybe she was living in Henderson.
Catherine: Forget &quot;secret agent.&quot; Roger Dunbar was living a secret life.

Debbie Dunbar: Can I help you?

Catherine: Good evening. We're with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
Debbie Dunbar: Oh, god. Did something happen to my husband? He was supposed to be home on Monday night. I've been calling his cell. He's not at work.
Catherine: Is this your husband?

Debbie Dunbar: Yes.
Catherine: You're currently married to him?
Debbie Dunbar: Yes. What is going on?

Catherine: Well, your husband is a suspect in a criminal investigation. Currently, he's in police custody.

Grissom: Mrs. Dunbar? Do you have a daughter?
Debbie Dunbar: Amy.
Grissom: Is she entered in the science fair?

 
 
Amy Dunbar: You can't take it.

Grissom: Amy, did you use this the tool to work on the inside of your volcano?
Amy Dunbar: Yeah, my dad did.
Catherine: He helped you build it?
Amy Dunbar: Yeah.
Debbie Dunbar: I teach yoga. I have no idea how this works. It was all Roger.
Grissom: When's your science fair?
Amy Dunbar: Friday.
Grissom: Well, we'll do our best to get this back to you by Friday, okay?
Amy Dunbar:  Okay.


 
 
Warrick: Which side do you want?
Sara: I'll take the west wing.
Warrick: It's a nice place.
Sara: Uh-huh.


Warrick: You could record a whole album in this studio.

Warrick: This guy's got it made.

Sara: The life of a celebrity.


Sara: I don't know, I think it sounds kind of isolating, living in a fishbowl.
Warrick: Wouldn't be isolated. You'd have a butler, a maid service, laundry service.

Warrick: Sheet music. Guy writes his own stuff.

Warrick: Dishwashing gloves. Dry erase markers.

Warrick: Slate Industrial Glass Cleaner.  The ingredients -- distilled water and hydrofluoric acid. Fatal if swallowed.


 
 
Detective: You're sure you want to waive your right to an attorney?
Myles Ruben:  I got nothin' to hide.
Warrick: Do you recognize this product?
Myles Ruben: Yeah. I use it to clean my windows.
Warrick: Don't you have a maid or someone to do that for you?
Myles Ruben: I write songs late at night. Windows are my chalkboard.

Myles Ruben:  Only what you feel / now I can ... 

Myles Ruben:  ...clearly see... 

Sara: Mr. Rueben ... your wife was poisoned. We suspect window cleaner was slipped into her wine.
Myles Ruben: It can't be. I was there. I opened that wine.
Sara: Did you have a fight?
Myles Ruben: Not lately.
Warrick: But you have had fights in the past.
Myles Ruben: Who doesn't? I mean, fighting, loving, laughing ... it all comes from the same place, man. It's passion. And we loved each other passionately.

Myles Ruben: When we met, it was Fate.

Myles Ruben: But you know what I need right now? I need a woman. I need a woman to come up here and be my inspiration. 

Myles Ruben: You, baby. Second row. Come on up here.


Myles Ruben: 
I can see by the love in your eyes / you've been hurt by love / so it's hard for you to trust a guy ... 

Myles Ruben: I was looking for love. She was looking for the same thing. She loved my music. I loved her smile.

Myles Ruben: It's hard being on top, you know? I mean, everybody loves you. Wants their piece. That's why we fought. I mean, all the time. Every night. She knew she could never have me to herself.  Look, I got sound check for the late show in an hour. Can I go?
Warrick: Sure.
Detective Vartann: We might want to talk to you later.

Sara: Wife's been dead less than 48 hours.
Warrick: Well, there's a man who definitely has his priorities straight.
Sara: Okay, three people have admitted to being with Amelia the night that she died. The room service waiter, Myles, and Myles's manager.
Detective Vartann: Room service guy's out. He left before the cork was popped.
Sara: So, did Myles kill Amelia and the manager's covering for him or did the manager kill Amelia and Myles doesn't have a clue?

 
 
Brass: Bigamy is a Class D Felony. If convicted, you could be sentenced from one to four years in prison, do you know that?
Roger Dunbar: I'd just married Beth, when I met Debbie. She was a student. UNLV. She got pregnant. I did the right thing. Ever since, it's been Monday through Friday with Debbie and weekends with Beth. They both think I travel for a living. 
Brass: I know I keep coming back to this, but, uh ... I mean, I got to ask you. What's with the empty apartment? Do you have a girlfriend on the side as well?
Roger Dunbar: No.

Randy Painter: Just tell them the truth.

Roger Dunbar: My life is really a balancing act. Early on, I took Debbie to dinner and Beth saw it on a credit card statement. So instead of a P.O. Box, I figured why not rent a cheap apartment, you know? Have a night to myself once in a while.
Catherine: We found a band-aid with your daughter Amy's blood at your apartment. So, you bring your daughter there, but not your wives?
Roger Dunbar: Oh, no. It's not like that. You know how kids are.

Amy Dunbar: Dad, take this. It keeps falling off.


Roger Dunbar: I emptied my pockets at the apartment.
Catherine: Mr. Dunbar, we collected both of your children's volcanoes and supplies. And we found a pair of pliers at your home in Henderson. Those pliers were used to make both of the volcanoes.
Roger Dunbar: That's right. I needed pliers in Henderson, so I borrowed Beth's pliers from Mesquite.
Randy Painter: There's no crime in that.
Catherine: I'm just really confused. Um ... your wife, Beth, told us that you couldn't build a volcano to save your soul. Yet your wife, Debbie, claims that it was all you that made your daughter's volcano. So, what is it?
Roger Dunbar: Well, I watched Beth when she made Timmy's volcano. So, then when Amy had a science project, I knew the drill. Now, granted, it wasn't as symmetrical as Beth's and the lava flow was a little anemic, but ... Amy liked it.
Catherine: When did you borrow those pliers?
Roger Dunbar: I don't know. Couple weeks ago. Why?
Catherine: You never returned them to your wife, Beth?

Roger Dunbar: I've been meaning to do that.


 
 
Catherine: Same characteristics. We got a match. 

Catherine: Take her in.
Officer: Come with me, Mrs. Dunbar.

 
 

Sara: Hey. I dusted the bottle. I got prints.
Warrick: I've got burns. You first. Sam or Myles?
Sara: Amelia's.

 
 
Robbins: Well, you're just in time. She gets shipped in an hour.
Warrick: This should just take a second. Could you give me her right hand, please?

Sara: Three acid burns.
Warrick: This is not a murder. It's a suicide.



(End of flashback. Cut to:
 


 
Myles Rueben: I knew she wasn't happy. I guess I just didn't pay attention.
Warrick: You shouldn't blame yourself for this.
Myles Rueben: Shouldn't I? Why shouldn't I? I spend most of my time making them happy. I never ... I never took the time to make her happy.

Audience:  Amelia, Amelia!

Sam Hopkins: What do you want to do, kid?

Myles Rueben: The show must go on, right?
Warrick: It's your call.


Myles Ruben: 
Amelia / ooh, Amelia / ooh, Amelia / I see the love in your eyes you've been hurt by ... 


 
 
Catherine: We found these pliers in your car's glove box. You used them to fix the hose bib. And to ... make a bomb.
Grissom: Mrs. Dunbar ... how long have you known about Roger's double life?
Beth Dunbar: His other wife's name is Debbie. Once or twice a year he'd call me by that name. I ignored it. 
Grissom: It's very difficult for two people to live a lie, let alone three.
Beth Dunbar: Look, when Roger and I were together, he was a good husband. Terrific father. It was almost like being in a state of suspended honeymoon. 
Grissom: Really? So what changed?
Beth Dunbar: He asked me to get his dirty laundry out of the trunk of his car.

Beth Dunbar:  There was a plastic bag with all the makings of a volcano. Including the stars I had hand-cut for my son. 


Beth Dunbar: I'd always suspected there was another woman, but never ... another family. So. Two weeks ago Sunday, I followed him. He, uh, dropped off his rental car and walked to some apartment building. Then he changed his clothes, and got into a nicer car, and drove out to Henderson.
Catherine: Why didn't you just leave him? Turn him in? 
Beth Dunbar: He made a fool out of me. A mockery of our life.
Catherine: Mrs. Dunbar, you killed three innocent people.
Beth Dunbar:  That was never my intention. That bomb was supposed to go off at 8:30 on his way to the airport.
Grissom: Why a bomb?
Beth Dunbar: It, it's not much harder to make a bomb than a volcano.

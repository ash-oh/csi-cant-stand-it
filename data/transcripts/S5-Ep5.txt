							<p>DUE TO ADULT CONTENT, VIEWER DISCRETION IS ADVISED</p>
<p>COLD OPEN.</p>
<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH:</p>
<p>[INT. BEDROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Various flashes of a Man and a Woman nearly-naked and kissing passionately.) </p>
<p>[EXT. DRIVEWAY - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(A man quickly walks out from his driveway, his wife struggles to keep up with him.) </p>
<p><strong>Wife</strong>: Honey, slow down.</p>
<p>(He pauses for a moment as she catches up with him. They keep going. She's trying to put her heels on as they cross the street to the neighbor's house.) </p>
<p><strong>Wife</strong>: Hold on a second. Hold on.</p>
<p><strong>Husband</strong>: (hurrying) Leave it alone. We're already late.</p>
<p><strong>Wife</strong>: Well, if you hadn't told the sitter the wrong time ...</p>
<p>(They're nearly there.) </p>
<p><strong>Wife</strong>: How do I look?</p>
<p>(He doesn't look.) </p>
<p><strong>Husband</strong>: You look great.</p>
<p>(They continue on to the neighbor's house.)</p>
<p>[INT. DOOR - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(The doorbell rings. Erin Brady, the Hostess of the party, opens the door. She's wearing a see-through black teddy as she greets her guests. There are others at the party also semi-dressed.) </p>
<p><strong>Erin Brady</strong>: Well, hey.</p>
<p><strong>Husband</strong>: Sorry we're late.</p>
<p><strong>Erin Brady</strong>: No, I'm so glad you guys could make it.</p>
<p>(She reaches out and grabs the bottle of champagne the Husband is holding. She turns and motions them inside the house.)</p>
<p>(The party is well under way. The guests are half-naked and making-out on the couches and wherever there's space.) </p>
<p>(As the hostess heads into the house, a woman party guest is leaving.) </p>
<p><strong>Party Guest</strong>: Hey, sweetie, I gotta run. Thanks for everything.</p>
<p><strong>Erin Brady</strong>: Gotta be safe.</p>
<p><strong>Party Guest</strong>: (to the husband and wife) Bye-bye.</p>
<p>(The party guest leaves as the hostess heads further into the house.) </p>
<p><strong>Erin Brady</strong>: You guys want a drink?</p>
<p><strong>Wife</strong>: Mm ... I'll have champagne.</p>
<p><strong>Erin Brady</strong>: Coming up.</p>
<p>(The Husband reclines on the couch next to a woman in her black, lacy underwear. The woman smiles and meets the wife as the wife heads off in a different direction leaving her husband with the woman.)</p>
<p>(On the dining room table, a man and a woman, party guests, are necking.)</p>
<p>(The Wife continues walking through the house. She stops in the kitchen and greets another couple. In the middle of the kitchen, she removes her dress.) </p>
<p>[EXT. HOUSE - POOLSIDE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(A woman jumps into the pool.)</p>
<p>(At poolside, a Man is kissing a Woman on his right. He turns and kisses the woman on his left.)</p>
<p>(The party continues.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. SIDEWALK - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(A dog barks.) </p>
<p>[INT. HOUSE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Inside, the party continues.)</p>
<p>(A woman screams.)</p>
<p>(Everyone stops and looks in the same direction.) </p>
<p>WOMAN <strong>Guest</strong>: Did you hear that?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. FOUNTAIN - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(There's a dead woman's body in the water fountain in the center of the road. David Phillips leans over the edge of the fountain as he waits for the water to be turned off.)</p>
<p>(Brass walks up to him.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What's the matter? Can't do your work? (yells) Hey, fellas, what's the holdup? Come on. I told you half an hour ago turn the damn fountain off! Give me a break.</p>
<p>(Together, Grissom and Sara duck under the crime scene tape on the way to the fountain. Just outside the tape are the party-goers. Grissom puts his kit down.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (to Grissom) You can't find good help.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: As Lord Byron once said, &quot;In the desert, a fountain is springing.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, this one sprung a dead woman ... Vanessa Keaton. She lived over there. (He indicates the house nearby. Grissom turns to look.) A neighbor walking her dog found her.</p>
<p>(Grissom takes note of the crowd around the tape.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This is a pretty well-dressed crowd for this time of night.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, you know, it's a shindig. 43 Niagara Circle. The vic was there with her husband. Who left the party early. That's Dan Keaton, and that's his daughter Amy.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You know, you might want to sneak some photos of this crowd.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: A gated community, middle of nowhere -- if this wasn't an accident, they're all suspects, aren't they?</p>
<p>(Sara turns around and snaps photos of the people in the crowd.) </p>
<p>(The water in the fountain is still running. David does the best he can as he looks at the body.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Foam in her nose and mouth. It's consistent with drowning. Abrasion on her forehead is fresh. And ... (He reaches for her wrist.) ... lividity is unfixed.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, since water motion has no effect ...</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: She's been dead less than two hours.</p>
<p>(The fountain water shuts off.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Thank you. Finally!</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Still waters run deep.</p>
<p>FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS COMMUNITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. KEATON RESIDENCE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Brass interviews Dan Keaton who is moaning and rubbing his head.) </p>
<p><strong>Dan Keaton</strong>: I can't do this right now.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What, a little hung over? Too much to drink, maybe? We'll have a police officer get you some water.</p>
<p>(Brass turns to the officer standing behind him.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Danny, help him out. </p>
<p>(Danny leaves to get the water.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, the last time you saw your wife was at the party?</p>
<p><strong>Dan Keaton</strong>: Erin and Paul Brady's.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: But you left early without your wife, right?</p>
<p><strong>Dan Keaton</strong>: Yeah, I wasn't in the mood. She was.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: For what?</p>
<p><strong>Dan Keaton</strong>: Partying.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What time did you leave?</p>
<p>(Amy Keaton walks down the stairs.) </p>
<p><strong>Dan Keaton</strong>: Around 11:00, I think.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Anyone see you come home? Maybe your daughter? This is Amy, right?</p>
<p><strong>Amy Keaton</strong>: I went out with friends. (She sits next to her dad on the bottom stairs.) My curfew's 1:00. I was a little late.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, Amy, did you see your parents when you came in?</p>
<p><strong>Amy Keaton</strong>: My mom was in Detroit. Vanessa's my stepmom. The tv was on in their room. I snuck into my room and went to bed. The sirens woke me up.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (nods) The sirens, huh?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. STREET -- DAY] </p>
<p>(The Coroners remove the body on the gurney. Sara and Greg watch. Greg is holding the camera.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You know, they never go home until they see the body taken away?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Necrophilic voyeurism.</p>
<p>(The crowd starts to disburse. Sara kneels down next to the fountain and looks inside. She picks up a black shoe.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Hot shoes.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You think these are sexy, huh?</p>
<p>(Greg shrugs.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Did you know that shoes like these put degenerative stress on the hip joints, throw off the curve of the spine, and the tilt to the pelvis, over time, women get headaches, sore backs, shortened calf muscles and bunions, of course.</p>
<p>(Sara stands up.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I take it back.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: First thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Vanessa Keaton was walking home. She had a few. Her feet hurt. She takes off her shoes. Dolce vida.</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: [NIGHT] Vanessa Keaton is barefoot and playing on the fountain. She walks on the concrete side, laughing. She slips and falls into the fountain, hitting her head on the concrete center. End of flash. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: There's no sign of blood or hair. Nothing to suggest contact.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: The fountain was on. Maybe the action of the water washed away evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: How do we know it was an accident? Maybe she wasn't alone.</p>
<p>(Greg things about it.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: We don't know that.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We're going to need a water sample and a bag for the shoe, of course.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(Greg walks over to his kit to get the things.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. VIDEO ARCADE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Nick and Warrick duck under the crime scene tape.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You okay to drive?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No. After a triple and three back-to-back scenes, I'm tired. I'm going to take a ten in the car before we head back.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: That's better than bouncing off the curb, I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah. Okay, you ready to run it?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (sighs) Sure.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Landlord's working late, trying to fix up the place for the new tenant, kicking up dust, paint fumes. Door's open for ventilation. Killer strolls in. Next thing you know, landlord's deli meat.</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: The Landlord is leaning over the saw as he works. The saw is running; his back is to the door. Someone walks up to him and pushes him down into the saw. He screams. Blood spatters on the wall. End of flash. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, we have this eviction notice. So, that means no business. No business, no cash, so that could rule out robbery as a motive.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I'm having Detective Cavalier run down the evicted tenants. It's a Melissa Poolie and a Charlie Pinscher.</p>
<p>(A man dressed in a white worker outfit walks into the door. The officer tries to stop him.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer At Door</strong>: Sorry, can't let you in.</p>
<p>(He points to his hat.) </p>
<p><strong>Marty Gleason</strong>: Take a look.</p>
<p>(He heads into the place carrying his kit.) </p>
<p><strong>Marty Gleason</strong>: Hey, you guys call yourselves investigators? You've been here four hours. You haven't figured this out yet?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Crime scene cleanup.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Blood bucket brigade.</p>
<p><strong>Marty Gleason</strong>: Hey, I prefer bio-recovery services.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You know, it's funny. I don't see an American bio-recovery badge.</p>
<p><strong>Marty Gleason</strong>: See, all you really need is a strong stomach, a thorough knowledge of solvents, a little sensitivity, a little tact. (He sees the bloody wall.) Whoa. Man! (He walks over to the wall.) There must be three quarts of blood in there. Hey, you're using anhydron. I charge extra for that. Cha-ching, cha-ching. You got photos, swabs. (He turns back toward Nick.) Did you finish the sketch?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Marty Gleason</strong>: Great. Hey, you guys have done everything but leave.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What's the rush, Marty?</p>
<p><strong>Marty Gleason</strong>: Ah, the wife of the deceased, she would like this mess cleaned up as soon as possible. New tenant moves in on the first.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay, Marty. I'll have the Detective release the scene.</p>
<p><strong>Marty Gleason</strong>: All right. (Marty puts his kit down on the ground.) Well, I'll get my gear.</p>
<p>(Marty heads out.)</p>
<p>(Nick yawns.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY - DAY]</p>
<p>(Robbins finishes stitching up the Y-incision. Grissom stands next to the table watching.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: One of the most attractive women I've had on my table. But beauty's skin deep and inside, we all look pretty much the same.</p>
<p>[Note: </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (points) What about this abrasion?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Have you no poet in you?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Beauty is truth, truth, beauty. That is all you know on earth and all you need to know -- except cause of death.</p>
<p>[Note: </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Pulmonary edema due to drowning. I sent samples of the water in her lungs to trace. The abrasion's serious enough to cause loss of consciousness. You may want to look at this though. You want to come over here? Let's turn her over.</p>
<p>(Grissom walks around the table. They turn over the body where Robbins points out four holes in her back.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Puncture wounds?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Four, uniform diameter, perimortem, non-lethal. No corresponding holes in her dress.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So she wasn't wearing it when she was stabbed.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Collected lubricant from the labia. Which means, uh ... I don't know if she had a date with her husband or herself. I sent an SAE kit to DNA. Personal observation - (Robbins picks up the black lacy underwear and shows it to Grissom.) -- you don't wear la perla to a tupperware party.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: La perla?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Very expensive. I gave some to my wife once. She accused me of having an affair. You know, s*x on the steel.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Lubricant and lingerie. I don't think the evening turned out the way she planned, do you?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM] </p>
<p>(Det. Cavaliere interviews Charlie Pinscher.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Cavaliere</strong>: So your business goes bust and Mr. Basengi evicts you.</p>
<p><strong>Charles Pinscher</strong>: Pac-man, Pong, loved these games. Thought it was a sure thing.</p>
<p>(Nick walks into the room.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Cavaliere</strong>: Well, today, it's all 3-d interactive. You know, I got kids.</p>
<p><strong>Charles Pinscher</strong>: You want some advice?</p>
<p><strong>Det. Cavaliere</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Charles Pinscher</strong>: Never go into business with somebody you're sleeping with.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Melissa Poolie?</p>
<p><strong>Charles Pinscher</strong>: Bitch.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Cavaliere</strong>: We haven't been able to find her. You know where she is?</p>
<p><strong>Charles Pinscher</strong>: We broke up. At least I think we broke up. She skipped town without telling me, stuck me with the rent.</p>
<p>(Det. Cavaliere walks around the table and sits down.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Cavaliere</strong>: So you were angry at her, you were angry at him.</p>
<p><strong>Charles Pinscher</strong>: I didn't kill him.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: He was holding your inventory hostage. How much you got tied up in Centipede and Space Invaders?</p>
<p><strong>Charles Pinscher</strong>: Every penny I got. About 20k.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Cavaliere</strong>: You must have wanted it back. Hey, did you stop by the store last night?</p>
<p>(Charlie hesitates.) </p>
<p><strong>Charles Pinscher</strong>: (carefully) No, but I called him. Asked if we could maybe work something out. Told me to go screw myself, he'd see me in court.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mr. Pinscher, I'm going to need to go ahead and get your fingerprints.</p>
<p>(Charlie Pinscher groans.)</p>
<p><strong>Charles Pinscher</strong>: You're going to find my prints all over that place. It was my store, mine and Melissa's.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I expect to find your prints in certain places, sir. We're just doing this to rule you out.</p>
<p><strong>Charles Pinscher</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - DNA LAB - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Mia Dickerson is in the lab putting her latex gloves on. David Hodges walks by in the hallway and notices something. He opens the lab door and walks inside.) </p>
<p><strong>David Hodges</strong>: You alternate hands when you double glove?</p>
<p><strong>Mia Dickerson</strong>: Yes. And I don't like being watched.</p>
<p><strong>David Hodges</strong>: If you alternate, there's more contact between the exposed latex of the first glove and atmospheric microbes.</p>
<p>(She stares at him for a beat, then starts removing her latex gloves.) </p>
<p><strong>David Hodges</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Mia Dickerson</strong>: (annoyed) You know, it would have been better if you didn't say anything, but you did making it impossible for me to concentrate, and now I have to sanitize and start over.</p>
<p>(The opposite door opens.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Hey, Hodges, you got the results of our drowning victim?</p>
<p>(Hodges turns to look back at Greg.) </p>
<p><strong>David Hodges</strong>: Yeah, in five. I'm in the middle of the rest of my life.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (insistent) Well, I kind of need them now.</p>
<p>(Hodges turns and smiles at Greg.</p>
<p><strong>David Hodges</strong>: (to Mia) I'll be back.</p>
<p>(Mia rolls her eyes at Hodges and Greg leave the lab.)</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - TRACE LAB - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Hodges and Greg walk back into the Trace Lab.) </p>
<p><strong>David Hodges</strong>: Good thing you didn't have to take a spelling test to work the field.</p>
<p>(David picks up the jar and shows the label to Greg.) </p>
<p><strong>David Hodges</strong>: &quot;Funtain&quot; water?</p>
<p>(The label reads:<br />
Article: QORPAK Exhibit No. 47-104B<br />
Date Found, Located or Developed: 3/21 BRADY HOUSE<br />
Where This Article was Found: FUNTAIN<br />
Investigation Officer: G. SANDERS<br />
Cat. No.: 47-10-43 1037ZKIX )</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: My people are Norwegian. That's how we spell it. So, is the &quot;funtain&quot; water in her lungs?</p>
<p><strong>David Hodges</strong>: All bodies of water contain unicellular algae.</p>
<p>(Hodges sets up the scope.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Called diatoms. They're unique, like fingerprints. Diatoms from one body of water don't match those from any other.</p>
<p><strong>David Hodges</strong>: Well, you're roughly right. Here, take a look.</p>
<p>(He moves aside and lets Greg look through the scope.) </p>

<p><strong>David Hodges</strong>: The diatoms on the left are from the water found in your victim's lungs and the diatoms on the right are from the fountain. Not a match.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Not even close. Which means she didn't drown there.</p>
<p><strong>David Hodges</strong>: I'll throw you a bone.</p>

<p><strong>Greg</strong>: She blew you off, didn't she?</p>
<p>(Hodges turns back with a test tube.) </p>
<p><strong>David Hodges</strong>: The water from the fountain is heavily chlorinated. No, she didn't blow me off. I didn't ask her out. But this sample, found in your vic's lungs, contains polymethylhexalene biguanide ... and anyway, I heard she blew you off first. It's a chlorine alternative. It's less irritating.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (nods) Yeah. When you have to go outside a marriage for passion, you're in trouble. And you're asking for trouble.</p>
<p>(He looks over at the Brady's.) </p>

<p><strong>Tom Cunningham</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, we matched the water in her lungs to your spa. And I see what appears to be a blood smear on the stone.</p>
<p><strong>Meg Cunningham</strong>: Well, sometimes we forget to lock the gate.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So your neighbors come in and use the spa?</p>
<p><strong>Meg Cunningham</strong>: It's possible.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, I guess so, I mean, you share everything else. Why not?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So what time did you leave the party?</p>
<p><strong>Tom Cunningham</strong>: Around 11:30.</p>
<p><strong>Meg Cunningham</strong>: But we didn't come right home.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Where'd you go?</p>
<p><strong>Meg Cunningham</strong>: We went to the Bellagio. A nice, romantic night out, just the two of us.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Cunningham</strong>: Sometimes being with others gives you the urge to be alone.</p>
<p>(Tom puts a hand casually on Meg's shoulder. She instinctively stiffens and glances at the hand before relaxing. Grissom notes the movement.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I see.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, we're going to compel a DNA sample, so we'll know if you were intimate with Vanessa Keaton.</p>

<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: What about her?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Swears he has nothing to do with it. You got a C.O.D.?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Blunt-force trauma to the occipital region. No trace in the wound track.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Do you have any idea what hit her?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Yeah. The impact's deep. Weapon was probably heavy. (He picks up the ruler and places it against the body's forehead to measure the wound.)<br />

<p><strong>Meg Cunningham</strong>: D-do I need a lawyer?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I mean, that's your call, that's your right, but let me point out that if you're covering for your husband, that's conspiracy after the fact. Now, are you prepared to go to jail over this?</p>
<p>(She chuckles.) </p>
<p><strong>Meg Cunningham</strong>: Look, I-I answered your question.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Okay, what if I told you the hotel maid told us that you weren't with Tom, what would you say?</p>
<p><strong>Meg Cunningham</strong>: I'd say she was lying.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know, I'm trying to help you out here, and I want to help you out, okay? But you got to cut the crap. Okay? Come on, tell me what happened. I mean, security confirmed that you were with a female. Late 20s, blonde, I mean, she even paid for breakfast with her credit card. So ... I'll tell you what, why don't we start over, okay? And you tell me what happened.</p>
<p><strong>Meg Cunningham</strong>: Look, Tom asked me to think about our son. He begged me to say we were together. I swear, I don't know ... anything that went on between him and Vanessa. I don't know.</p>

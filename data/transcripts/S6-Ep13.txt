<p>VARIOUS B/W FOOTAGE OF OLD LAS VEGAS, SHOWS</p>
<p>FADE INTO:</p>
<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[EXT. O'NEILL RESIDENCE -- FRONT - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Party guests climb up the front steps. Sam Braun is greeted at the entrance.) </p>
<p><strong>Doorman</strong>: Good evening, Mr. Braun. Go right in.</p>
<p>(Sam Braun continues into the party.) </p>
<p>[INT. O'NEILL RESIDENCE -- FRONT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Sam Braun mingles as he makes his way into the party.) </p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong>: How are ya?</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: Good to see you. How've you been? Drop by the Tangier's. Dinner's on me.</p>
<p>(Camera pans over the table and we see a display of books, &quot;Kisses &amp; Kisses&quot;).</p>
<p>(Various cuts of the guests at the party. Most of them are from an older crowd.) </p>
<p>(Sam greets a dark-haired woman.)</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: Hi! How are you!</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(Sam shakes hands with a white-haired man.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(Sam passes a waiter and grabs a glass of wine off the tray.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[INT. O'NEILL RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The double doors open and Tim Duke, dressed as a waiter, walks in. He takes out a revolver and cocks the weapon.) </p>
<p>(Sam Braun walks up to the edge of the dance floor, his eyes on the woman dancing center stage with her partner.) </p>
<p>(In the dressing closet, Tim Duke walks through and puts the gun down on the counter. He opens a drawer.) </p>
<p>(The woman continues to dance with her partner as others watch and applaud.) </p>
<p>(The song ends.) </p>
<p><strong>Lois O'Neill</strong>: Woo! I haven't been this out of breath since I bet Frank Sinatra I wasn't ticklish.</p>
<p>(The crowd watching laughs.) </p>
<p><strong>Lois O'Neill</strong>: In a few minutes, there'll be cake and champagne, so stick around; the party's not over yet.</p>
<p>(Lois walks off the dance floor and Eve Girard meets up with her.) </p>
<p><strong>Eve Girard</strong>: You've got eight minutes to change. I'll come help you.</p>
<p><strong>Lois O'Neill</strong>: No, no, no. I'm fine. Go get the cake ready.</p>
<p><strong>Eve Girard</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Lois O'Neill</strong>: And, Eve ... light the candles.</p>
<p>(Eve looks at her, nods and smiles. She turns to leave and bumps into Li'l Cherry.) </p>
<p><strong>Eve Girard</strong>: Oh ... hi.</p>
<p>(Eve leaves; Li'l Cherry turns to Lois.) </p>
<p><strong>Li'l Cherry</strong>: Oh, hey, happy birthday. Um, I got to go soon ... I got to go do my show. So ...</p>
<p>(Lois turns and looks at Li'l Cherry.) </p>
<p><strong>Lois O'Neill</strong>: For years, I did two shows a night, partied with the boys for hours, got a little sleep, played some tennis, gave interviews, got on stage and did it all over again. That's talent. You've got a look. Pace yourself, honey.</p>
<p>(The woman looks at Lois as Lois turns to head upstairs.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. O'NEILL RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The doors open. Brass, Grissom and Greg walk in.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Lois O'Neill's bedroom ... the stuff dreams are made of.</p>
<p>(Grissom points to the dead body in the walk-in closet.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Or nightmares.</p>
<p>(They head for the walk-in closet.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did, uh, Miss O'Neill tell you about this guy?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We don't know where she is. She disappeared about an hour ago. Her assistant went looking for her, found the victim. ID'd him as Tim Duke.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Gun left on the body ... isn't that how the mob used to do it?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, back in the day, Lois O'Neill was famous for singing and dancing. She was also famous for being the girlfriend of Tony Constantine, one of the founding fathers of Vegas. </p>
<p>(Grissom snaps a couple of pictures of the dead body with the camera.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Looks like a bank vault.</p>
<p>(Greg points to the gold-colored door at the end of the closet. Greg heads over to the door.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, the founding father has placed a high priority on home security. Have we been in there yet?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No, it hasn't been cleared yet. I'll go get the combination.</p>
<p>(Brass turns and leaves.) </p>
<p>(Greg puts his kit down on the ground. He sees two dents on the door.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Ricochet marks.</p>
<p>(Grissom walks over and snaps a couple of pictures.) </p>
<p>(Greg takes out a glove and finds something on the carpet.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Possible bullet fragments.</p>
<p>(Grissom snaps another photo.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Bullets here, body there ...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Moving target, maybe.</p>
<p>(Brass returns with Eve Girard.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Gentlemen, this is Eve Girard, Miss O'Neill's assistant. Would you open the vault, please?</p>
<p><strong>Eve Girard</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'll be downstairs.</p>
<p>(Eve walks over to the door and twists the combination lock. The lock clicks. She pushes the door open and steps aside.)</p>
<p>(Grissom turns his flashlight on and steps inside.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>(He looks around. We hear whimpering coming from off screen. Grissom turns and finds Lois O'Neill cowering on the floor under the counter.) </p>
<p><strong>Lois O'Neill</strong>: Just get it over with.</p>
<p><strong>Eve Girard</strong>: Lois!</p>
<p>(She rushes over to her.) </p>
<p><strong>Eve Girard</strong>: Lois! Oh, my God!</p>
<p>(Eve helps Lois to her feet. She clings to Eve.) </p>
<p><strong>Lois O'Neill</strong>: Oh ... I thought this was my last birthday.</p>
<p>SMASH CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[INT. O'NEILL RESIDENCE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Lois is sitting on the sofa and sipping from a coffee cup.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: In the middle of the party, you went upstairs to change. Isn't that unusual?</p>
<p>(Lois laughs.) </p>
<p><strong>Lois O'Neill</strong>: No, I ... I always wear one outfit to greet guests, another for dinner and dancing, and another for dessert.</p>
<p>(The waiter brings Lois a glass of brandy. She adds it to her drink.) </p>
<p><strong>Lois O'Neill</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, uh, Tim Duke, the waiter ... did you know him before this?</p>
<p><strong>Lois O'Neill</strong>: He worked the children's hospital dance a few weeks ago. He was charming.</p>
<p>(She takes a sip from her drink.) </p>
<p><strong>Lois O'Neill</strong>: I thought he could use the job.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>Lois O'Neill</strong>: I was changing. I'd ordered a drink brought up.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: A gun fires. Tim Duke grunts and falls to the floor. Lois O'Neill is in her vault changing. She sees him crawling on the floor.) </p>
<p><strong>Lois O'Neill</strong>: (V.O.) He was crawling, to get away.</p>
<p>(She closes the vault door. Outside, two shots ricochet off the door.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Lois O'Neill</strong>: And then I heard another shot.</p>
<p>(She imitates the sound of a gunshot.)</p>
<p><strong>Lois O'Neill</strong>: (cries) That's, uh ... that's when I knew it was a mob hit.</p>
<p>(Greg nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Lois O'Neill</strong>: Look, if you find his family, I'd like to do something for them. I mean, after all, if he hadn't come in just then, I'd be dead.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Who'd want to kill you?</p>
<p>(She turns and looks at Greg. She sees his name on his jacket.) </p>
<p><strong>Lois O'Neill</strong>: Do you have a first name, Sanders?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Greg.</p>
<p><strong>Lois O'Neill</strong>: Greg ...</p>
<p>(She turns and takes a book off the table next to her. She looks at Brass and holds out her hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Lois O'Neill</strong>: Do you ... ?</p>
<p>(Brass hands her his pen.) </p>
<p><strong>Lois O'Neill</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>(Lois signs the book. Brass glances over at Greg and they both share a grin.) </p>
<p>(She hands him the book.) </p>
<p><strong>Lois O'Neill</strong>: Hot off the press. I didn't hold back. I named names. After all this time, I thought, who'd care?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, maybe you thought wrong.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. O'NEILL RESIDENCE - BEDROOM CLOSET -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Sara snaps a photo of the dead body. David Phillips finishes taking the liver temperature.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Based on liver temp, been dead one to two hours. It looks like two shots -- to the chest, and a through-and-through to the head.</p>
<p>(She takes more photos.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Not a lot of blood. Shot to the heart . Sometimes it collects in the chest cavity rather than bleeding out.</p>
<p>(David finds a wad of bills in the dead man's pocket. He takes it out and quickly looks at it, counting the amount.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: A thousand ... when I was a waiter back in college, if I had three twenties in my pocket, it was a good night.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: At Chuck E. Cheese, that was a good week.</p>
<p>(Sara finds a crack vial.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Crack vial? Could explain the cash; maybe he was dealing.</p>
<p>(David nods.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: And these ...</p>
<p>(He opens the man's hand to show her the black burn on the man's fingertip.) </p>
<p>(Sara snaps a photo of it.)</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: Someone burns crack in a smoking pipe. He inhales and burns his finger on the glass tube. End of flash.) </p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
[INT. O'NEILL'S RESIDENCE - BEDROOM - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(Catherine stands in front of the bedroom side table up against the wall. She's standing very still and staring at something. Sara exits the bedroom closet.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Found a crack vial on him, and $1,000 in cash.</p>
<p>(Catherine turns and shows Sara the table full of framed photos.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Presidents, movie stars ... a drug-dealing waiter isn't the kind of guy usually associated with Lois O'Neill. On the other hand ... (She picks up a particular photo.) Tony Constantine.</p>
<p>(She picks up another photo of four showgirls. She looks at the photo and chuckles.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The Copa girls from the Sands. (points) That's Lois O'Neill.<br />
(points) That's my mother.</p>
<p>(She puts the photo back down on the table and notices the note on the flowers arrangement.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (reads) &quot;Happy birthday to my beautiful doll! Love always, Tony&quot;?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I thought he was dead.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Dead, like Jimmy Hoffa. The only guys who know aren't telling.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. O'NEILL RESIDENCE - LOBBY - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Nick goes over the itinerary with Eve Girard.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: This party is organized like an invasion plan. &quot;6:15: Bar set up and ready. 6:25: Lois greets guests in foyer. 7:15: Lois changes into her dinner outfit.&quot; Talk about attention to detail.</p>
<p>(Eve holds out three video tapes for Nick.) </p>
<p><strong>Eve Girard</strong>: From the security cameras on the perimeter of the building.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What about the interior cameras?</p>
<p><strong>Eve Girard</strong>: With all the extra measures, Lois felt they weren't necessary. Frankly, I think she just didn't want to be caught on tape first thing in the morning.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hmm. I'll need a list of all the guests who were here tonight.</p>
<p>(She hands him the list.) </p>
<p><strong>Eve Girard</strong>: Guests and staff, their affiliation and recent accomplishments ... Lois likes to personalize conversation. Everyone's still here.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (nods) You're thorough.</p>
<p><strong>Eve Girard</strong>: Well, that's my job.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. SECOND FLOOR BALCONY - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Catherine steps out onto the balcony and looks around at the railing.) </p>
<p>(She looks down and sees a white cloth on the concrete.)</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: Someone in a tux walks out onto the balcony and slips over the railing. He drops the white cloth as he leaves. End of flash.)</p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
[INT. O'NEILL RESIDENCE - FOYER - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Undersheriff Jeff McKeen talks with Grissom.) </p>
<p>Undersheriff <strong>Jeff Mckeen</strong>: Grissom, do you have any idea who's in this crowd?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I sure do.</p>
<p>(Looks at the guest list and notes. Nick stands on the side and watches.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: &quot;Under-Sheriff Jeff McKeen. Arrival: 6:38 pm. Wife: Amanda. Recent accomplishment: Ran marathon for children's hospital, placed tenth in his age group.&quot; Good job, Jeff.</p>
<p>Undersheriff <strong>Jeff Mckeen</strong>: More than one of these VIPs has the governor's home number, which is why my phone's been ringing with orders to let them go.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, no one on this list came late or left early, so everyone here is still a suspect, until they're not.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: And based on our interviews so far, only a few people actually left the room when Lois O'Neill was gone. </p>
<p>Undersheriff <strong>Jeff Mckeen</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Among others, her ... a pop star known as Li'l Cherry. She was due onstage at Mandalay Bay half an hour ago.</p>
<p>Undersheriff <strong>Jeff Mckeen</strong>: Keep her and anyone else who left the room. Let the rest go.</p>
<p>(Grissom looks a little surprised by the order. He looks at Nick and nods. Nick sighs.) </p>
<p>(Catherine walks up to Grissom and shows him the handkerchief in a plastic bag.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Found this handkerchief hanging off the balcony. I'll get it to Hodges.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Good. By the way ... Sam's here.</p>
<p>(Grissom points. Catherine turns around and sees Sam Braun sitting alone on the couch.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He's one of the guests who was out of the room when the murder occurred.</p>
<p>(She turns and looks at him.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, I should say hi to dear old Dad.</p>
<p>(Catherine walks over to Sam Braun.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hi, Sam.</p>
<p>(He looks up and sees her.) </p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: Mugs.</p>
<p>(He automatically rises to his feet as Catherine sits down next to him. They both sit down.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Sam, when you left this room tonight, where did you go? Upstairs? </p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: Just walked around downstairs, saying hello to the old ghosts. You know, I introduced Lois and Tony, back when I was a floor manager. She was in the line with your mother.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (nods) Mm. Maybe Mom fell for the wrong gangster.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: Lily was a sweet girl. But Lois ... she had to be a star. A real Coal Miner's Daughter from Rackville, Pennsylvania. But once she met Tony, she never had to go back.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You always were a sucker for a hot dancer, weren't you, Sam?</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: Me and Lois -- I love her, but I like to be in the driver's seat. Like this dancer I'm seeing now -- she's working tonight; that's why I came stag.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Must be serious. That's the first time you haven't asked me how Mom's doing. She's fine, by the way.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(Nick walks over to talk with Bobby Jensen.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mr. Jensen. I'm Nick Stokes. I'm with the Crime Lab. I'm familiar with your daughter's case. </p>
<p>[Note: Reference to episode CSI-5X07: Formalities]</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Sorry for your loss. You knew Mr. Constantine, right? (He nods.) Were there any other friends of Mr. Constantine here tonight?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Jensen</strong>: Yeah, there were friends here. And enemies.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You want to elaborate a little bit more on those enemies?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Jensen</strong>: Stokes, you trying to get me in trouble?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, man, I'm just trying to get to the bottom of what happened here tonight. Several witnesses said they saw you leave the room. Alone.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Jensen</strong>: I went outside to have a cigarette-- told her I wouldn't smoke in the house. Filthy habit. Trying to quit.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mm.</p>
<p>(Grissom walks up to talk with Li'l Cherry. Her bodyguard stands nearby.) </p>
<p><strong>Li'l Cherry</strong>: (to phone) Frickin' cops won't let me go. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Miss Cherry?</p>
<p><strong>Li'l Cherry</strong>: (to phone) Bye-bye.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm with the Crime Lab. I need to ask you a few questions.</p>
<p>(She scoffs, ignores him and starts dialing.) </p>
<p><strong>Li'l Cherry</strong>: (to phone) Hey, it's me. Are they freaking out backstage?</p>
<p>(Grissom grabs her wrist and pulls her phone away from her ear.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Excuse me ...</p>
<p><strong>Li'l Cherry</strong>: What the ... ?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Please?</p>
<p>(She shuts her phone. He glances down and sees the burn on her finger.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Where did you go when Miss O'Neill left the ballroom early this evening?</p>
<p><strong>Li'l Cherry</strong>: Uh, the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Do you recall what time you came back?</p>
<p><strong>Li'l Cherry</strong>: What, do you punch a clock every time you take a leak?</p>
<p>(He glances down and notices the bruises on her knees.) </p>

<p><strong>Lawyer</strong>: There. My client denies the pipe is hers, denies any drug use, doesn't know the victim and has no prior relationship to Miss O'Neill. There's nothing to discuss.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The pipe was in your possession. Plus, you were displaying symptoms of crack use publicly.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: And you were at a recent party where the victim, who also used crack, was working.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: And now you admitted to leaving the ballroom after Ms. O'Neill.</p>

<p>(She finds the crack vial.) </p>
<p><strong>Tim Duke</strong>: What are you gonna give me?</p>

<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: You wiped down the gun with a handkerchief ...</p>
<p><strong>Lawyer</strong>: No one has established that my client had a gun.</p>

<p><strong>Li'l Cherry</strong>: It's cool. Um ... it wasn't just, uh, Lois's birthday tonight, it was also my bodyguard's birthday, and I scraped my knees giving him his present.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: You're going to need to cancel your shows for awhile. We're holding you on possession of paraphernalia, and unlawful use.</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah. I've been through the footage throughout the entire day. I've got party, staffers going in and out the back door. But, get this - same time, different entrance.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Fingerprints are just oil, water and amino acids, Greg. They don't last forever.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: No kidding. You ever hear that expression &quot;old money&quot;? This stuff was ancient -- some of it's signed by Eisenhower's treasury secretary. Series dates all before 1965. Same with the grand we found on the vic.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: &quot;Ancient?&quot;</p>

<p>(Grissom steps out of his office. Greg is just behind him.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Miss O'Neill! Nice to see you. What's all this?</p>
<p><strong>Lois O'Neill</strong>: An army travels on its stomach. I wanted you and your people to know how grateful I am for all you've done for me.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, thank you. But, uh, we can't accept anything that might influence the outcome of the case -- it's our policy.</p>

<p><strong>Lois O'Neill</strong>: You'd have to ask Tony. Where is the money now?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's in our evidence vault.</p>
<p><strong>Lois O'Neill</strong>: Oh. And, uh ... when will it be returned?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We have to finish our investigation first.</p>

<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Yeah. Deformed, medium caliber, consistent with a .38. Take a look at the heart.</p>
<p>(Robbins shows Grissom the heart.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Bullet passed into the base of the right ventricle, crossed the intraventricular septum and destroyed the av node.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Could the victim have crawled around after suffering that kind of damage?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Negative. He would have been paralyzed instantly.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Could the shot to the head have occurred first?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: You are &quot;O&quot;-for-two. Check out the brain.</p>

<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So his heart had already stopped pumping.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: From the absence of blood, I'd say that this shot was at least ten minutes after the shot through the heart.</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: All right, this is what we got so far: we got a loser boxer, who's a crack head, probably selling drugs -- and someone buys him two tickets to Sardinia. Why?</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, but who killed him? And why?</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, for one thing, he's a player.</p>
<p><strong>Lily Flynn</strong>: I don't expect monogamy from him.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (groans) Oh. I can't believe this.</p>
<p><strong>Lily Flynn</strong>: And I am not promising that he'll get it from me, either.<br />
(Catherine turns around and gets an envelope from behind her desk.) What are you doing?</p>
<p>(She holds the envelope open.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Put it in the envelope.</p>
<p><strong>Lily Flynn</strong>: Why?!</p>
<p>(Lily puts the handkerchief in the envelope.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Because we haven't cleared Sam as a suspect.</p>
<p><strong>Lily Flynn</strong>: He can't be! He has been so wonderful to me these past few weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, this has been going on for weeks, huh?</p>
<p>(Catherine sits down.) </p>
<p><strong>Lily Flynn</strong>: We have a history together, Catherine. We were young together. Some day, maybe you'll understand.</p>
<p>(Catherine looks at her mother.)</p>

<p>[INT. LIMO (PARKED) - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Catherine settles in the seat across from Sam Braun.) </p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: You want to see me, Muggs, all you need is a phone.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You lied about being in Lois O'Neill's bedroom.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: I was in that bedroom once. In 1967. As a gentleman, I would prefer not going into details.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Your handkerchief puts you there when the waiter was shot.</p>
<p>(Sam pulls out a handkerchief from his jacket pocket.) </p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: One of these? Lois and I were going over old times. She got a little weepy. What she did with it after that, I don't know. My housekeeper made me a dozen for Christmas. I've only got half left.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So quit giving them away.</p>
<p>(Sam chuckles.) </p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: Oh ... you're mothering me.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You know, Sam, this is the second time that I thought that you might be a killer.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: Come on, you know better.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The thing is, I don't. It never occurred to me for a minute that this is something that you wouldn't have done. And that wouldn't bother me, except you're dating my mother.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: Look, I'm being good to Lil this time around. Give us a chance. Give me a chance. You'll see.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Making up for stabbing one girl by being kind to another. Hmm.</p>
<p>[Note: Reference to episode CSI-3X23: Inside the Box]</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: If you weren't my daughter ...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What? What would you do, Sam?</p>

<p>(Grissom and Sara walk in. They stop and watch Hodges.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Vanity, thy name is Hodges.</p>
<p>(Startled, Hodges quickly caps the pen.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: This isn't what it looks like. I actually like my gray hair. The few that I have. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (smiling) Hodges, don't you know that gray hair can be very attractive?</p>
<p>(Grissom perks up and glances sideways at Sara. Hodges turns and smiles at Sara.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The ring?</p>
<p>(Dazed by Sara's smile, Hodges nods automatically.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: The ring? (He shakes himself out of it and turns to get the results as he reports.) The ring. The ring was positive for GSR.</p>
<p>(Hodges hands the results to Grissom to look at. Sara reads it over his shoulder.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: That means Lois could be the shooter.</p>

<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: From the containment of the blood, it appears she was shot while lying down.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Asleep ... or surprised by someone she trusted?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Nick just found out that Tim Duke's airline tickets were purchased by a credit card under the name of Double-X Associates.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: That's Lois O'Neill's company.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How do you know that?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: She was the double-kiss girl.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yeah, you can't say her name without kissing twice. Lois O'Neill --<br />
Kiss-Kiss. XX.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Huh. Well, Nick also found out that the only two names authorized to sign on that card were Lois O'Neill and Eve Girard.</p>
<p>(Grissom pauses.) </p>

<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Grissom, you know I was looking into that Pan Am heist in '65?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: On your own time, I hope.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: It's related to our case. I just got off the phone with the FBI Lab at Quantico. Bobby Dawson sent them ballistics on the gun we found on Tim Duke.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: It's a match to the gun that was used to kill a guard in the Pan Am heist. So I sent them serials on the cash we found.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Also a match to the Pan Am heist?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Right-o, Daddy-O.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Congratulations, Greg.</p>
<p>(Greg nods. Grissom turns and heads back to his desk to sit down. Greg walks over to his desk.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This is Doc Robbins' preliminary autopsy report on Lois O'Neill. When he opened her up, he found that her body was riddled with advanced tumors.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p>(Greg sits down.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: She knew she was going to die. That's why she wrote the book, 'cause she knew that if she was gone, there'd be nobody left to tell the true story.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You read it. Do you think that's how she wanted to go out?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: No. But, uh ... looking beautiful -- yeah. In all the papers -- yeah. Murdered ... only if she was the one who called the shots.</p>

<p><strong>Bobby Jensen</strong>: No, she had guts. She staged her exit like a pro. The book, the party ... she only made one mistake -- she hired an amateur.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Tim Duke? Also known as Vincent Pullone?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Jensen</strong>: A wimp and a thief. Lois would give you all the cookies you wanted, but you stuck your hand in the cookie jar ... she'd chop it off.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [BEDROOM CLOSET] Lois talks with Tim Duke.) </p>
<p><strong>Lois O'Neill</strong>: Try to relax, honey. This'll be easy. I'll be on the bed, one shot. Don't be sloppy.</p>

<p><strong>Bobby Jensen</strong>: She didn't want to involve an old friend.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Until yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yesterday afternoon, Lois O'Neill wired $250,000 to your sister in Sarasota. Now you were Tony C's driver. The only one he trusted to bodyguard Miss O'Neill. You took care of her right until the end.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Jensen</strong>: Well, who else do I have to take care of?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: My guess is she wired you the money, but being a friend you refused. So she sent it to your sister instead.</p>
<p>(He wipes his mouth and chuckles softly.) </p>
<p><strong>Bobby Jensen</strong>: She sent it to my sister. You know, you've got a choice between checking out all shriveled up, in a hospital, or at home, looking like a million bucks. Any guy who'd do that for a good friend, he's okay by me. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [BEDROOM] Lois is on the bed.) </p>

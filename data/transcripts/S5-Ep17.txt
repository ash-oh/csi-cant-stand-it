<p>[INT. HOTEL CASINO - MAIN FLOOR - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[INT. FOUR ACES- FRONT DESK - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Martha Krell rolls her bag to the front desk. The Front Desk Clerk looks at her.) </p>
<p><strong>Front Desk Clerk</strong>: Welcome back, Mrs. Krell.</p>
<p><strong>Martha Krell</strong>: I told you, it's Martha.</p>
<p>(She takes her card.) </p>
<p><strong>Front Desk Clerk</strong>: Your room's ready and I have your credit card on file. </p>
<p>(She turns to her co-workers as she leaves.) </p>
<p><strong>Martha Krell</strong>: See you in the morning. I'm beat.</p>
<p>(The elevator door opens. She walks inside and presses the button.) </p>
<p><strong>Front Desk Clerk</strong>: (o.s.) Call me if you need anything, Martha.</p>
<p>(She smiles as the elevator doors close.) </p>
<p>(The Front Desk Clerk looks up.) </p>
<p>(The elevator light for the second floor lights up.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. FOUR ACES MOTEL - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(The stairwell door opens and a man in a dark-colored jacket steps out. He looks down the hallway one way, then notes the EXIT door down the other hallway.) </p>
<p>(Off screen, the elevator bell dings.) </p>
<p>(The man in the dark-colored jacket and white sneakers heads toward the EXIT door. He follows the hallway and sees Martha Krell heading down the hallway with her luggage in tow.)</p>
<p>(He starts walking quickly and purposefully toward her.)</p>
<p>(Martha Krell reaches the motel room door and uses the card key to unlock the door.)</p>
<p>(The man reaches Martha Krell quickly. He swiftly grabs her and pushes his way into her motel room, her scream muffled by his hand over her mouth.) </p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO: </p>
<p>[INT. FOUR ACES MOTEL - KRELL'S ROOM] </p>
<p>(Brass, Grissom and Sara walk into the room. Officers are there.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Decedent's name is Martha Krell. Flight attendant. She checked in this afternoon.</p>
<p>(Brass stops near the bed where Martha is dead on the bed, her blood seeping into the sheets.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Apparently, she was stabbed to death. The coroner's en route.</p>
<p>(Grissom and Sara put their kits down.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Weird ... no sign of struggle.</p>
<p>(They look around the room.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No clothes, no luggage.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Bedspread's undisturbed. (Sara notes the trash bin.) Trashcan is empty and the inside is spotless. It's possible a liner's been removed.</p>
<p>(Grissom looks at the dead body.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Take a whiff.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Smells clean.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Smells like a hospital.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Bleaches and deodorizers. Killer attacked the victim, then cleaned and sanitized the room.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Ah, but here's the smell of the blood still, and all the perfumes in Arabia will not sweeten this little room.</p>

<p>[EXT. FOUR ACES MOTEL - STREET OUT FRONT -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Officer car lights flash.) </p>
<p>[INT. FOUR ACES MOTEL - KRELL'S ROOM] </p>
<p>(Close-up: The DFP450 thermometer gage reads 83 degrees. David Phillips removes it from the liver.) </p>
<p>(A camera snaps and flashes.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Her liver temp's 83 degrees. She's been dead approximately ten hours.</p>
<p>(Sara is taking picture of the body.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'd like to get a clear photo of her wounds. Can we lay her out?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Oh, yeah. Grab her feet.</p>
<p>(Sara puts her camera down. She grabs the feet while David holds on to the victim's upper body. As they flatten the body out, we hear the joints cracking.) </p>
<p>(David picks up the victim's bloodied hand and looks at it.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Defensive wounds.</p>
<p>(Sara picks up her camera and takes more photos.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Incised.</p>
<p>(He looks down the body at the stab wounds. Sara snaps more photos.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: At least a dozen.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: She did not want to die.</p>
<p>(Off screen, the motel room door opens. Greg walks in with his kit.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I just got the call.</p>
<p>(Sara turns and looks at Greg.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Where's Grissom?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Bathroom.</p>
<p>(Greg tilts his head, puzzled.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Working the, uh, case.</p>
<p>(Greg heads for the bathroom.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. FOUR ACES MOTEL - KRELL'S ROOM -- BATHROOM] </p>
<p>(Greg walks into the bathroom and finds Grissom sitting in the tub holding his flashlight down at the drain.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hand me my multi-tool, will ya, Greg? I need a Phillips.</p>
<p>(Greg puts his kit down and picks up Grissom's multi-tool. He takes out the Phillips screwdriver and hands it to Grissom.) </p>
<p>(Grissom takes the tool and starts unscrewing the drain.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, the stabbing was brutal, but the crime scene is clean. No cast-off, no spatter. So, I want to know if the killer washed blood down the drain.</p>
<p>(Grissom removes the drain cover. He holds it up and looks at its underside with his flashlight. He puts it aside. He uses the forceps and removes a wad of hair in the drain. He holds it up and looks at it with his flashlight.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Swab and phenol this, will ya?</p>
<p>(Greg takes a swab from Grissom's open kit on the toilet and kneels down to swab the wad of hair. He tests it with phenol and the swab tip turns pink.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Blood.</p>
<p>(Grissom holds out the wad of hair for Greg to take.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Label it. Send it to DNA.</p>
<p>(Greg takes the forceps from Grissom.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. FOUR ACES MOTEL - KRELL'S ROOM -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(Close-up of: Martha Krell is on the gurney. The coroner covers her with a sheet.)</p>
<p>(Grissom steps out of the bathroom. He removes his latex gloves and watches as the coroner wheels out the victim's body. He heads over to Sara.) </p>
<p>(Sara is dusting the hotel table. Grissom stops and stands next to her.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Usually in hotel rooms, we find too many prints. (She sighs.) Not a single one. Just wipes and swipes.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. FOUR ACES MOTEL - LOBBY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Brass interviews the Front Desk Clerk.) </p>
<p><strong>Front Desk Clerk</strong>: Ms. Krell was a real nice lady. She brought me a Dodger baseball cap.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Wow. So you were friends? </p>
<p><strong>Front Desk Clerk</strong>: Not really. Airlines buy a chunk of rooms for their trolley dollies, discounted. She's just staying here for a few months.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So you discovered the body.</p>
<p><strong>Front Desk Clerk</strong>: Her supervisor called to say her A.M. flight was canceled. She wasn't answering her phone. He asked me to make sure she got the message.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So you knocked on her door, and when she didn't answer, you just went right in?</p>
<p><strong>Front Desk Clerk</strong>: Yeah. I got a master key.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, I knew that. Does the hotel have surveillance?</p>
<p><strong>Front Desk Clerk</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Thank you. You've been a big help.</p>
<p><strong>Front Desk Clerk</strong>: Right on.</p>
<p>(The Front Desk Clerk leaves. Hayden Michael steps up toward Brass.) </p>
<p><strong>Hayden Michaels</strong>: Excuse me. I'm Hayden Michaels. I'm the Manager of the Four Aces. I just got the call. Anything we can do to help?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Thank you. I'll let you know.</p>
<p><strong>Hayden Michaels</strong>: Detective, if this hits the media, this is really going to hurt our business.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What are you asking me?</p>
<p><strong>Hayden Michaels</strong>: Anything you can do to keep it out of the press?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Look, I'm trying to catch a killer. I got no control over the press. If this makes the news, then it is what it is.</p>
<p>(Brass turns and leaves.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[EXT. HAWKINS' RESIDENCE - DAY]</p>
<p>(Officers put up crime scene tape around the front of the house.) </p>
<p>(Catherine and Nick exit their vehicle and head for the house carrying their kits. They pass an officer escorting Martin Hawkins out the front walk, another officer escorting Yvonne Hawkins and a third officer escorting their son, Matthew Hawkins.) </p>
<p>(The officer opens the back seat car door for Martin Hawkins.)</p>
<p>(Catherine passes Matthew Hawkins on her way to the house.) </p>
<p>(Detective Chris Cavaliere meets up with Catherine and Nick.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Chris Cavaliere</strong>: Hey. Victim's in the bedroom. Ty Hawkins, 12.</p>
<p>(He leads them into the house.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />

<p><strong>Det. Chris Cavaliere</strong>: Mother came in to wake him ... found him like this.</p>
<p>(Det. Cavaliere, Nick and Catherine look at the little boy bruised and beaten under the bed sheet. Nick sighs.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Beaten to death.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Chris Cavaliere</strong>: This many blows; it was personal. </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Liver temp makes T.O.D. around midnight.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Chris Cavaliere</strong>: No sign of forced entry. Nothing's missing. All the doors and windows were locked except for the screen door. Parents claim they keep that locked.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You find a weapon?</p>
<p><strong>Det. Chris Cavaliere</strong>: Negative. Family's been transported down to the station. I'm gonna go down and take their statement. Hey, when you're done here, roll by. We'll ink them.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p>(Det. Cavaliere leaves.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Boy's not even safe in his own bed.</p>
<p>(Nick sighs again.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'll take the inside.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, I could use the fresh air.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. HAWKINS' RESIDENCE - TY'S BEDROOM -- AFTERNOON] </p>
<p>(Catherine takes a swab of Ty Hawkins' bed. She picks up the bat and looks at the knob at the base of the bat handle. She swabs the head of the bat. She puts the bat down and tests it. Negative. She looks at the swab.) </p>
<p>(Catherine removes the sheets off the bed.)</p>
<p>(Camera pulls back out of the bedroom through the bedroom window and out of the house ... </p>
<p>[EXT. HAWKINS' RESIDENCE - BACKYARD-AFTERNOON -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>( ... where Nick is standing with his camera to take a photo of the shoe print in the dirt just outside Ty Hawkins' bedroom window.) </p>
<p>(He puts the ruler aside and puts a metal ring around the shoe print. He smashes the bag of plaster and pours it over the shoe print.) </p>
<p>(Nick stands up.) </p>
<p>(Camera zooms back into the house through the bedroom window ... </p>
<p>[INT. HAWKINS' RESIDENCE - TY'S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON -- CONTINUOUS] </p>

<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[EXT. HAWKINS' RESIDENCE - BACKYARD-AFTERNOON -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(Nick has found the word &quot;BRAT&quot; written on the bedroom window. He dusts it.) </p>
<p>(Inside, Catherine dusts the window jalousies.)</p>
<p>(Outside, Nick dusts the word on the window glass. He leans in close and snaps a photo of it.)</p>
<p>[INT. HAWKINS' RESIDENCE - UTILITY ROOM - AFTERNOON -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(Catherine walks into the utility room and opens the washer. She takes out some bed sheets and other clothing. She uses an ALS on the clothes and finds some urine stains on the clothing and the bed sheets.) </p>
<p>[EXT. HAWKINS' RESIDENCE - BACKYARD-AFTERNOON -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(Nick walks over to the trash bins. On the ground are some heavy lead pipes. He snaps photos of it. He picks one up and looks at the treading at the bottom. He puts the pipe down and snaps a photo of it.) </p>
<p>[EXT. HAWKINS' RESIDENCE - DRIVEWAY -AFTERNOON -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(Catherine opens the back of their SUV. She takes her sunglasses off. Nick walks up to her carrying a lead pipe.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Found a pile of pipes by the side of the house; one seems to be missing. This is an exemplar of a possible murder weapon. And I cast a shoe impression just outside the kid's bedroom window. Also some graffiti on the window -- B-R-<br />
A-T. Maybe somebody had it in for the kid. </p>
<p>(Catherine slips her jacket on.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, I bagged the bloody sheets from the bed. Found boxers, a t-shirt and a fitted sheet in the washer. ALS'd for blood, found urine.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (nods) Mm. Well, whoever killed the boy knew how to get in and out of this house without waking the family.</p>
<p>(Catherine closes the back door.) </p>

<p>[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Robbins goes over Martha Krell's body with Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: No mystery here. Ms. Krell was violently stabbed to death. C.O.D. exsanguination.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: SAE kit?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: She was raped. Contusions to the vaginal introitus and an eighth-inch hemorrhagic laceration at the vaginal fourchette. Six o'clock position. The attack was brutal.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Aren't they always? I don't know why people think that rape has anything to do with s*x.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: If a guy just wants s*x, he can hire a hooker.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What else?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Well, there is some good news. Motile sperm in the t mount. I've sent the kit to DNA for analysis.</p>

STEIN, SUE<br />
MAY 12 1999</p>
<p>(Sara walks to the office and lingers in the doorway.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (smiles) Ecklie, what's up?</p>
<p>(Ecklie looks at Sara.) </p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: I paged Grissom.</p>
<p>(Sara walks into the office.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: And he paged me. How can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Five years ago, there was this, uh, day-shift case, homicide.<br />
(Ecklie lays out the photos on the trace table. Sara moves in closer for a better look.) The victim was a flight attendant named Sue Stein from Palo Alto, California. (Sara moves to stand next to Ecklie.) She was raped and murdered in a local hotel. Killer was never apprehended. </p>
<p>(Camera focuses in on a particular photo of the victim. She's dressed in her underwear and on her side on the bed. A similar scene to the one she just left.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [FOUR ACES MOTEL - DAY] David Phillips is standing over the victim's body while Sara snaps photos of her.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p>(CU: Sara's eyes. She looks at the photos on the table. The crime scene from five years ago is very similar to the one they're investigating. The victim is on the bed bloodied from stab wounds. There are defensive cuts on her left hand.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [FOUR ACES MOTEL - DAY] David Phillips lifts up Martha Krell's bloodied right hand.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>

<p>(Quick flashback to: [FOUR ACES MOTEL - DAY] Camera moves over the table wiped clean.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p>(CU: Sara's eyes. She looks at the photos on the table. Ecklie looks at Sara.) </p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Vic's clothing and suitcase were missing. Room was immaculate, smelled like disinfectant.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Same signature.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: One difference. In the, uh, prior case, body was found in a first floor room. Sliding glass door facing the pool was unlocked.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Ms. Krell was killed on the second floor. There was only one way into her room.</p>
<p>(Ecklie nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Was there semen present in Sue Stein's SAE kit?</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Yeah. Ran it through CODIS. No hit. I asked Mia to compare it with the semen from the recent attack.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Is that fingerprint from your crime scene?</p>
<p>(Ecklie hands the print tape and photo to Sara.) </p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Only print we found. Impressed in Sue's blood on the bedspread near her hips. Underlying pattern on the fabric made it impossible to read.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: That was then. (Sara looks at Ecklie.) This is now.</p>

<p>(Nick rips open a towel wipe and hands it to Martin Hawkins. Det. Chris Cavaliere questions Martin Hawkins.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Chris Cavaliere</strong>: Now, your wife said that you both went to bed after the news.</p>
<p><strong>Martin Hawkins</strong>: I already told you that. Twice. </p>
<p>(Martin Hawkins nervously wipes his ink-stained fingertips on the towelette.) </p>

<p><strong>Martin Hawkins</strong>: How could my wife and I sleep ... (He takes a deep breath.) ... through it all?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mr. Hawkins, would you stand up, facing me, so I can take some photos?</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Look, Jesse, we appreciate you coming down here voluntarily, but if you clam up, we're gonna have to file an obstruction of justice charge, and that's not good ... for you. Let's make it easy on yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's it? A compromised wad of hair?</p>
<p><strong>David Hodges</strong>: No, uh, I called you to discuss the bleach. The hairy wad smelled a bit woodsy to me. Which is odd, considering it should only smell like bleach. </p>

<p><strong>David Hodges</strong>: That disgust you?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No, actually, it's the first time you've ever done anything to impress me.</p>

<p><strong>Lucy</strong>: The guests sometimes complained about the bleach smell after we cleaned the bathrooms. A few years ago, I started adding cedar chips to the bottles. Makes it smell better.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Lucy, who else has access to your bleach?</p>
<p><strong>Lucy</strong>: Just the maids.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Are they all female?</p>
<p><strong>Lucy</strong>: Yes.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Or dad could have worn it and dumped it in the park.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Or this sweater could have accidentally been left in the park, and Walter, the homeless guy, could have picked it up and worn it when he entered the house through the screen door and killed Ty. But none of the evidence goes to motive.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Not our problem at the moment. Let's just stay focused on the sweater. It's tied to the victim and this scene. We need to tie it to the killer. Hey, how tall would you say Matt Hawkins?</p>

<p><strong>Adam Matthews</strong>: Is that an accusation?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, a woman was murdered in your client's hotel. He has a right to hear our theory. The killer is clearly a psychopath. He's killed more than once. I'm sure that before his first rape and murder he fantasized about it for years.</p>

<p>(Adam Matthews looks at Grissom smugly.) </p>
<p><strong>Adam Matthews</strong>: Well, then you just set my client free.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: On the contrary. Western Airlines issues this exact type of &quot;wheelie&quot; to all its flight attendants. Since Martha's wheelie wasn't in the hotel room, we thought maybe the killer took it ... as a souvenir. This particular suit case ...</p>

<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS COMMUNITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[EXT. KINGSLEY RESIDENCE - FRONT DRIVE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(The Biker parks his motorcycle.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: A car pulls up a second driveway and parks. Dennis Kingsley steps out of the car and shuts the door.)</p>
<p>(The Biker on the motorcycle removes his helmet and stands next to his bike.) </p>
<p>(He takes his briefcase and walks into the house.)</p>
<p>(Dennis Kingsley heads into his own house.) </p>
<p>[INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(The door opens. Dennis Kingsley steps into the house and puts his plastic bag on the counter. He takes out a bag of English muffins, a box of Tetley British tea and a jar of something and lines it up perfectly on the counter.) </p>
<p>(He takes the empty bag and heads out of the room.) </p>
<p>[INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Dennis Kingsley puts on his dressing gown and shuts the door. He opens the door to the far room at the end of the hall and slips inside.) </p>
<p>(The door closes behind him.) </p>
<p>[INT. BASEMENT STAIRS - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Dennis Kingsley makes his way down the basement stairs. He comes to two double doors.) </p>
<p>(He opens the doors and enters into what appears to be a British-decorated study.) </p>
<p>[INT. BASEMENT - STUDY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Dennis Kingsley flicks on a switch on the table and violin music starts playing. He walks over to the window and pushes the curtain aside to reveal a fake scene just out of the basement window of a horse-drawn carriage pass by.) </p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO:</p>
<p>(Dennis Kingsley is playing his violin in front of the fake fire in the fireplace.) </p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO: </p>
<p>[INT. BASEMENT - STUDY - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Dennis Kingsley is dead with a gunshot wound to his temple. Someone snaps a photo.) </p>
<p>(Grissom is kneeling in front of the victim as he looks around.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Deerstalker cap ... violin ... meerschaum pipe ... even a Persian slipper with tobacco stuffed in the toe, I imagine.</p>
<p>(Greg snaps more photos of the scene.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: All in all, a meticulous recreation of 221-B Baker Street: Residence of the world's greatest detective, Sherlock Holmes.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Also known as Dennis Kingsley, delivery guy. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Ask Greg. It's his case. It's his final proficiency -- emphasis on the &quot;final&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Okay, Dr. Watson, run it.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Victim's in a relaxed position in front of a fake fire. Alcohol. Solitude.</p>
<p>(He leans forward to look at the wound.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Powder burns around the entrance wound. Close to contact shot.</p>
<p>(Greg straightens.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: It all suggests suicide.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, if he killed himself, where's the weapon?</p>
<p>(Greg swallows. He sighs.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Huh ... family and friends who discover a body sometimes remove the weapon to make it look like murder. No suicide stigma and better chances of collecting any life insurance.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: From the look of the place upstairs, this guy lived alone, and the neighbors heard the shot, so ... pretty good. I guess I'll, uh, go interview the neighbors.</p>
<p>(Brass turns and leaves.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: So, are you going to say, &quot;the game's afoot&quot;?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I didn't know you were a Conan Doyle fan, Greg.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I'm not. I saw a Sherlock Holmes movie once by mistake.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, just so you know ... those movies never ended like this.</p>
<p>(Grissom flashes his flashlight at the dead body.) </p>
<p>FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. KINGSLEY RESIDENCE - FRONT DRIVE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Brass is standing in the neighbor's driveway talking with the Biker. He finishes up and turns to leave.) </p>
<p><strong>Biker</strong>: I'll see if I can hook you up. Give me a call.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: All right. Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>(He heads back to Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Anything useful?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, I found out if I ever need a home loan, as a public servant, I'm pre-approved. You know, the guy looks like a, uh, drug dealer. Turns out he's a mortgage broker.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, we all have our costumes, Jim.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(Brass and Grissom watch as two men and a woman in costume appear out of the fog walking down the street toward them.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, apparently some more than others.</p>
<p>(The three costumed individuals stop in front of Brass and Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I assume you're friends of Mr. Kingsley?</p>
<p><strong>Nelson Oakes (Dr. Watson)</strong>: We are friends of Mr. Holmes.</p>
<p><strong>Kay Marquette (Irene Adler)</strong>: Invited guests, in point of fact.</p>
<p><strong>Josh Frost (Prof. Moriarty)</strong>: This is all so contemporary.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, I'm with the Las Vegas crime lab.</p>
<p><strong>Nelson Oakes (Dr. Watson)</strong>: Ah, a colleague. Perhaps we can be of some assistance.</p>
<p><strong>Kay Marquette (Irene Adler)</strong>: (eagerly) Yes. Have you discovered any shoe impressions in the soil?</p>
<p>(She moves forward as if to look for herself, but Grissom stops her.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Not yet. This is a crime scene.</p>
<p><strong>Josh Frost (Prof. Moriarty)</strong>: Oh, a scenario created for our own entertainment, yes?</p>
<p>(Grissom turns around to show them Dennis Kingsley's dead body being wheeled out on the gurney. A sobering sight. They put the body in the back of the coroner's van.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I guess it depends on what you find entertaining.</p>
<p><strong>Josh Frost (Prof. Moriarty)</strong>: Oh, God.</p>
<p>(The coroner shuts the door on the body.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. KINGSLEY RESIDENCE - BASEMENT - STUDY - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Greg is going through the blood on the floor when Sara walks up to him.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Anyone for pizza?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Very funny.</p>
<p>(Greg finds and picks up the bullet amidst the puddle of blood and pieces of brain.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p>(Sara kneels down next to Greg to look at the bullet.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Ooh. BFB. Big freakin' bullet.</p>
<p>(Greg looks at the bullet under the magnifying glass.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Nose is mushroomed. Looks like pure lead. Two cannelures consistent with a revolver. One, two, three, four, five, six lands and grooves. Left hand twist.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Which usually means ... ?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Colt .45?</p>
<p>(Sara nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Are you checking up on me?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No, no, no, no. Grissom said he was just evaluating you on processing this one room, so ... I figured maybe you could use some help with the rest of the house.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>(Sara stands up and starts looking around. Greg tucks the bullet into a bindle.) </p>
<p>(Sara picks up the empty old-fashioned glass syringe and looks at it.) </p>
<p>(Camera zooms in to show the residue of something in the glass syringe.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Guess everyone needs a hobby.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. KINGSLEY RESIDENCE - FRONT DRIVE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Brass and Grissom speak with the other members of the mystery club.) </p>
<p><strong>Kay Marquette (Irene Adler)</strong>: We would study the Holmes text in cases and important 19th century events.</p>
<p><strong>Nelson Oakes (Dr. Watson)</strong>: We met every Thursday night.</p>
<p><strong>Josh Frost (Prof. Moriarty)</strong>: You make it sound like a bowling league. This is a serious literary association.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Open on an old photo slide of a dead woman. [STUDY] The group sit around the table discussing the photo slide.) </p>
<p><strong>Josh Frost (Prof. Moriarty)</strong>: As usual, Dr. Watson, subtlety is lost upon you. You see a stab wound above her breast and overlook the absence of blood on the chair as well as the fact that her skirt is raised. This body was posed, and quite beautifully, I might add.</p>
<p><strong>Nelson Oakes (Dr. Watson)</strong>: Moriarty, if evil for evil's sake were a pathological condition, it would be your diagnosis.</p>
<p><strong>Kay Marquette (Irene Adler)</strong>: Gentlemen, your disdain for one another distracts you from the truth. The wedding picture on the wall? The victims were husband and wife.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis Kingsley</strong>: As usual, Miss Adler, your deduction is correct. It was indeed a crime of passion.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Sounds fun. When was the last time you saw Dennis Kingsley?</p>
<p><strong>Josh Frost (Prof. Moriarty)</strong>: Last Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>Kay Marquette (Irene Adler)</strong>: He said that he was going to make this meeting really special.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [STUDY] The group sits at the table.) </p>
<p><strong>Dennis Kingsley</strong>: It seems our time here tonight has ended, and that, I fear, is the gist of the announcement I must share with you now. Next week will be the final meeting of our society, but I give you my word: It shall be an evening none of you will ever forget.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Kay Marquette (Irene Adler)</strong>: I didn't think that he meant this.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We're going to need names and contact information.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It would also be helpful if you'd let us take your fingerprints.</p>
<p><strong>Nelson Oakes (Dr. Watson)</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Elementary. So we can rule you out. You've all obviously been in the study on numerous occasions. We need to find out if the prints we find are relevant.</p>
<p><strong>Josh Frost (Prof. Moriarty)</strong>: So you actually think this is something other than suicide?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know, I think you ought to drop the accent.</p>
<p><strong>Josh Frost (Prof. Moriarty)</strong>: I can't. I'm English.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. KINGSLEY RESIDENCE - BASEMENT - STUDY - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Greg looks at the floor. He finds something on the floor and snaps a photo of it.) </p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[SARA]</p>
<p>(Close-up of the door leading to the basement. Sara examines it focusing on the scratches on the wood near the doorknob and plate.) </p>
<p>(Greg finds something on the floor near the table leg. He picks it up and looks at it.) </p>
<p>(Sara sits down at the table in front of the laptop. He presses the spacebar and the screensaver with the meerschaum pipe on it stops. She looks at the screen for a moment.)</p>
<p>(She turns and picks up the framed photo of Dennis Kingsley sitting on the couch with his wife and daughter.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(Greg looks up from his camera as Sara walks into the room to share her findings.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: There's possible signs of forced entry at the back door. It could be recent. Also, I think the vic had a family at some point. Brass is on it.</p>
<p>(Greg snaps a photo of a red book with blood on its cover, &quot;The Hound of the Baskervilles&quot;.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Check this out.</p>
<p>(He shows her the book, evidence marker #6. Sara kneels down next to Greg.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The Hound of the Baskervilles. I read that in tenth grade.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Oh, yeah - I was supposed to.</p>
<p>(Sara chuckles. He shows her the stain on the book page edges.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: There's a blood stain on the page ends.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p>(Greg puts the book back on the table in the position he found it in.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The spatter goes across and over. That stain did not come from this event.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: [THE BOOK ON THE TABLE] A gun fires, blood spatters on the book cover. End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It could be the vic's, or it could be stage blood, for that matter.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Do you think an obsessive neat freak like our vic would leave something like that on one of his most prized possessions?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I think ... there's only one way to find out.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAKE (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[EXT. ROADSIDE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(An officer's car is parked on the side of the road. Warrick walks alongside the roadway. He turns and visualizes the accident.) </p>
<p>(Quick visualization of: The jeep swerves on the road. It passes right through Warrick and off screen. Warrick turns and continues to visualize the jeep traveling down the road where it smashes into the tree.)</p>
<p>(End of visualization. Resume to present.) </p>
<p>(Warrick makes his way across the road.)</p>
<p>[EXT. ROADSIDE - CRASH SITE - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Nick approaches the van with the body in it. David Phillips and Det. Chris Cavaliere are there.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Chris Cavaliere</strong>: Hey, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, Chris.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Chris Cavaliere</strong>: Nevada power guys -- they saw the jeep, called it in. I ran the plates. R.O. is, uh, Cory Demayo, 25. Lives on Florentine. (Nick snaps a couple of photos of the body as he listens.) Spoke to the roommate. Driver fits the description.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Vic's got a contusion on his forehead. Probably from the impact.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, I can see that. It's just hard to believe that's what killed him.</p>
<p>(Warrick walks up to the group.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I didn't see any skid marks on the road up there. There's no signs he tried to brake.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Well, maybe he fell asleep at the wheel.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Uh, coming over that embankment? That would've woke him up. Key's still in the ignition. Car's in drive. Engine's not running.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Did the paramedics open this door?</p>
<p><strong>Det. Chris Cavaliere</strong>: Vitals were taken through the open window. Door was ajar when we arrived on the scene.</p>
<p>(Warrick finds a joint in the car. He picks it up and shows it to Nick.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey, Nick, check this out.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Guy was getting high. Think that's the reason he missed the curve up there?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You think?</p>
<p>(Warrick finds something else.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Ah. We got a wallet.</p>
<p>(He hands the wallet over the body to Nick who hands it to Det. Cavaliere.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>(Det. Cavaliere checks the Nevada Driver's License. It reads:<br />
DEMAYO, CORY<br />
6878 FLORENTINE RD.<br />
LAS VEGAS</p>
<p><strong>Det. Chris Cavaliere</strong>: Cory Demayo. Fits the description. No cash, no plastic.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: This is a pretty remote place for an accident. But you think someone saw it, took advantage of the situation?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Maybe he wasn't alone. Maybe the passenger survived, then emptied out his wallet, took off.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (nods) Maybe.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY - DAY]</p>
<p>(Greg snaps photos of the body.)</p>
<p>(He removes the evidence bag from around the victim's right hand. He snaps photos of the hand and takes samples from it.) </p>
<p>(Greg continues to process the body.) </p>
<p>(He snaps photos. He flips the victim's arm over and we see the needle marks on his inner arm.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - LAYOUT ROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(Sara and Robbins talk while looking at the photos spread out on the table in front of them.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: This guy really dress up like Sherlock Holmes?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: At least once a week, evidently, like those civil war re-enactors. I, uh, never understood that.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Yeah. In any event, C.O.D. was no surprise. Perforating contact range, gunshot to the right temple.</p>
<p>(Greg appears the doorway with the tox report.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Got the tox. Cocaine metabolites in the vic's urine. 500 nanograms per M.O.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: You only see levels that high in chronic users.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Those are the track marks.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yeah, but there was also morphine in his blood and in the syringe. (He hands the report to Robbins.) Seven percent solution, morphine sulfate and water. Sherlock went from crack to smack.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Morphine metabolites in his system but no heroin metabolites? He wasn't on street junk. This is pharmaceutical-grade stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: And at a pretty hefty dose, too. How fast for the injection to take effect?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Given his size, he would've been incapacitated in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Not much time to undo the works, put away his antique syringe, pick up a gun and blow his brains out.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Wait a minute. The GSR test on his hand was positive. What are you getting at?</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: [STUDY] Someone else pulls the trigger. End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, maybe Sherlock had some help.</p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>

<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - INTERVIEW ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Det. Chris Cavaliere and Warrick interview Lyle Davis, Cory Demayo's roommate.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Chris Cavaliere</strong>: Hey, when was the last time you saw Cory?</p>
<p><strong>Lyle Davis</strong>: Yesterday. Just kicking it, like me.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: How'd you get that bruise on your dome, man?</p>
<p><strong>Lyle Davis</strong>: Oh, uh, windsurfing.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Chris Cavaliere</strong>: Hey, you guys go out there together?</p>
<p><strong>Lyle Davis</strong>: Yeah. Well, he's got the wheels, so ... </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So you drove back together?</p>
<p><strong>Lyle Davis</strong>: No. I sort of hooked up with this chick, so I bounced.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Nice. You know the chick's name?</p>
<p><strong>Lyle Davis</strong>: Uh, Jennifer.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Chris Cavaliere</strong>: Jennifer who?</p>

<p><strong>Lyle Davis</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No? All right, let me tell you what I think happened. You and Cory got stoned, and you drove away. Cory lost control of the jeep ...</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (V.O.) ...at which point, you couldn't wake him up,<br />
(Lyle goes through Cory's wallet and takes the money inside.) </p>

<p><strong>Lyle Davis</strong>: I didn't get back in the car with Cory, and if I had, I wouldn't have left him!</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Lyle, we're going to need a DNA sample from you.</p>
<p><strong>Lyle Davis</strong>: (alarmed) What? Why?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Just to prove that, uh, your lips weren't on that joint that we found in the jeep.</p>
<p><strong>Lyle Davis</strong>: All right, man. Let me just be straight with you guys for a second here. I admit Cory and I sparked up at the lake, okay? But then he took off. Three weeks ago, I was busted for pot, okay? The judge gave me diversion. You guys file charges, I'm screwed. I will never get into dental school.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: And you weren't willing to do that?</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The world's greatest detective makes suicide look like murder?</p>
<p>(Greg nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Why would he try and frame his best friend in the process?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, Watson said they were friends, but who knows what kind of relationship they really had. Maybe they hated each other. Maybe Dennis couldn't stand the thought of anyone else being Sherlock. Besides, I thought motive wasn't our business.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It's not. Write it up, give the report to Grissom. Way to go.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: All right.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - GARAGE] </p>
<p>(Nick and Warrick are busy prepping the dummy for their experiment. They wrap the dummy completely in plastic wrap.)</p>
<p>(Through several time cuts, they proceed to make a gel mold of the dummy.) </p>
<p>(They take the mold off of the dummy.)</p>
<p>(Nick slaps the flat of his hand on the gel dummy's head.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY TO GARAGE] </p>
<p>(Catherine walks into the garage. She finds Nick standing on the jeep setting the experiment up. The gel dummy is behind the driver's seat.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What ... what is going on?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: We're finishing up the case.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Do you know how much ballistic joe costs?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I didn't know you did.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I just thought you guys were gonna go over your notes, look over the case file.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, hold on now. We found electrical burn marks on the roll bar and the jeep's undercarriage. And we found blown out fuses on the instrument panel and the starter. That would explain why the jeep wasn't running.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, we called Nevada Power, and they confirmed there was a downed power line the day of the accident.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, you're saying the victim was electrocuted?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So we replaced the fuses, we connected the jeep to a power source, and we hooked up gelatin man here to a meter.</p>
<p>(Nick bounces on the jeep.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Watch it wiggle, see it jiggle, I get it. Well, you're gonna need at least six milliamps to prove your theory.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I'm on it.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(They start the car engine.)</p>
<p>(Warrick puts his goggles on.) </p>
<p>(He flips the switch.) </p>
<p>(The latch holding the pipe releases and swings down, connecting with the jeep.)</p>
<p>(From their safe distance away, they see the jeep spark at the connection.) </p>
<p>(The milliamps meter remains at zero.) </p>
<p>(Catherine, Nick and Warrick watch the jeep sparks burn out.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Congratulations. You killed the jeep, but the victim's still alive. The current never even made it past zero. So, either your theory is wrong, or you've got a problem with your experiment. Are there any variables in the case that haven't been duplicated here?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Same vehicle, power's good. So, why isn't Mr. Wiggles connecting?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: He's naked.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, let's dress him up.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(They finish putting clothes on the gel dummy.)</p>
<p>(They start the car engine. Warrick, Nick and Catherine put their goggles on. Warrick flips the switch.) </p>
<p>(The powerline hits the jeep bar.)</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV to: The surge of electricity sparks through the jeep bar and down to the side of the jeep frame. It makes contact with the victim's wrist watch, through the victim and out through the metal rivets in the victim's shorts. End of CGI POV.)</p>
<p>(The milliamps meter is at seven.) </p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO: </p>
<p>(Warrick, Nick and Catherine meet at the jeep.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So, the current came into the vehicle from the roll bar, and it went out through the undercarriage.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It needed an entry point and exit point.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Entry through the, uh, the watch on his wrist and then exit through the rivets in his shorts.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Right across his heart, stopping it cold.</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: [ROADSIDE-DAY] The jeep is traveling down the road. It hits the downed power line and runs over the metal mile marker just as the power line hits the jeep bar.) </p>
<p>(Cut to: The jeep rolls down the side of the hill and stops at the bottom in front of the tree.)</p>
<p>(End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So I know that I've never said this to you guys before, but ... hide the evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (chuckles) Thanks for getting our back.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We're a team, guys.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Oh, since we're a team, you gonna help us clean up?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(Catherine laughs.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No. I'm the boss.</p>
<p>(She turns and leaves. Warrick and Nick chuckle.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Catherine meets Ecklie in the hallway.) </p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: I thought you told me you closed the Cory Demayo case. Catherine, nothing happens in this lab that I don't know about.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Then I'm sure you know the case is now closed.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Did I make a mistake promoting you?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, you should have given me the day shift. But I'm making it work.</p>
<p>(Catherine walks away.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - GRISSOM'S OFFICE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Grissom reads through Greg's final report.) </p>
<p>(He thinks about it and flips back to the report:<br />
MORPHINE .07</p>
<p>(Grissom picks up the police autopsy report. He reads through it:<br />
ADDITIONAL TESTING PERFORMED<br />
COCAINE Elevated</p>
<p>(He picks up the first report with the syringe contents: MORPHINE.)</p>
<p>(He again looks at the autopsy report: COCAINE.) </p>
<p>(Something's not adding up. Camera holds on Grissom.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - LOCKER ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Greg is putting on his shoes while listening to rock music on his earphones.) </p>
<p>(Grissom appears in the doorway holding the open file folder.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Greg.</p>
<p>(Greg doesn't hear him.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (louder) Hey, MTV boy. (Greg removes the earphones and turns the music off.) I have a question about your report.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: According to autopsy, the victim showed long-term effects of cocaine abuse.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: That's right.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: But according to tox, the substance in the victim's syringe was a seven percent solution of morphine.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The victim was an obsessive compulsive. In the stories, Holmes' preferred stimulant was a seven percent solution of cocaine, not morphine.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Evidence out of context.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did you ever consider the possibility that the victim didn't realize what he was injecting himself with?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: No. You think someone switched his coke with morphine?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You found the victim's fingerprints on the gun, but you found no prints on the surgical tubing, no epithelials either. Does that make sense if it was a suicide?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I guess not.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Do you have any other suspects who have access to morphine or surgical tubing?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I can find out.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I would do that.</p>
<p>(Grissom turns and leaves. Greg sighs heavily as he buttons his jacket and kicks his locker door closed.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - LAB -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Grissom is examining the tubing under the magnifying glass. Greg walks into the lab.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I went through the medical records for all of our suspects. As far as I can tell, none of them have ever been prescribed morphine. I think Watson's our best bet. The guy is a security guard at Desert Palms; he was certainly around morphine.</p>
<p>(Greg looks over Grissom's shoulder as Grissom cuts open the tubing.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Tobacco leaves. Run a quick comparison. This has to belong to one of our suspects.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Brass interviews Kay Marquette, Irene Adler. Greg watches from the observation room.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Do you like your life?</p>
<p><strong>Kay Marquette (Irene Adler)</strong>: What kind of question is that?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, I mean, I've seen how happy you are at work. And then I know you come home to Mom and I guess she has terminal cancer. That's got to be tough.</p>
<p><strong>Kay Marquette (Irene Adler)</strong>: Yeah, well, you try giving enough attention to someone who never gave you any. </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: But the Sherlock Holmes Club, that's got to be one bright spot, hmm?</p>
<p><strong>Kay Marquette (Irene Adler)</strong>: The one place I could go every week where no one was grabbing my butt or staring at my breasts. The one place I could talk, think.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You must have been pretty devastated when Dennis Kingsley decided to break up the club, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Kay Marquette (Irene Adler)</strong>: (shrugs) It was a disappointment.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [STUDY - NIGHT] Dennis Kingsley talks with his group.) </p>
<p><strong>Dennis Kingsley</strong>: Next week will be the final meeting of our society. But I give you my word, it shall be an evening none of you will ever forget.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I think it's a lot more than that. </p>
<p><strong>Kay Marquette (Irene Adler)</strong>: I don't know what you mean.</p>
<p>(Brass slides the report across the table toward Kay.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well ... the tobacco -- your blend is Cavendish.</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: The contents of Kay's purse are a pipe and some surgical tubing.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Okay, why don't I tell this like a story, you know, like the end of a story, all right? Because I like the part where the detectives solve the crime. So here goes. On the day of the murder, you broke into Denny Kingsley's house. That's easy enough, the lock's crummy. You snuck downstairs. You replaced his cocaine with morphine, because you knew he was a creature of habit. So now all you had to do is wait.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [STUDY - NIGHT] Kay sets up the suicide and pulls the trigger.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So you sprinkle some of Dr. Watson's pipe tobacco in the carpet. You scoop up some of Denny's blood, to splash on Watson's shoes later. Why the elaborate frame-up of Watson? He had as much to lose as you.</p>
<p><strong>Kay Marquette (Irene Adler)</strong>: Because he's the one that told Denny to give it all up and go back to his family. Because he's the one that wanted to be Sherlock Holmes, because he didn't care what it was doing to me.</p>
<p>(She sniffles and leans forward.) </p>
<p><strong>Kay Marquette (Irene Adler)</strong>: You see, Detective ... (British accent) Denny would have wanted his murder to be the perfect puzzle. A mystery worthy of the master.</p>
<p>(She starts laughing.)</p>
<p>(Camera refocuses on Greg in the observation room.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Greg walks dejectedly through the hallway. At the end of the hallway, Warrick and Nick are talking.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, Greg, Grissom wants to see you.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Like now, in his office.</p>
<p>(Greg turns around and sighs heavily. Might as well get this over with.) </p>
<p>(He heads for Grissom's office.) </p>
<p>[INT. CSI - GRISSOM'S OFFICE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Greg walks into the office. He sees a dark figure behind Grissom's desk in his chair.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Grissom. You wanted to see me.</p>
<p>(The chair swings around and we see that it's Mr. Gel Dummy dressed up as Grissom, a large sign stuck on his chest:<br />
YOU PASSED!</p>
<p>(Everyone steps out into the room - Nick, Warrick, Sara, Catherine and Grissom. Ecklie is with them. They cheer and applaud him. Sara gives Greg a hug. Catherine kisses Greg's cheek and gives him a hug.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well done.</p>
<p>(Everyone shakes his hand. Grissom smiles proudly at Greg.) </p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Congratulations, Sanders. Good work.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Okay, gang, there's people to put in jail. Let's get back to it, shall we? Come on, come on, now. Party's over. Let's go.</p>
<p>(Everyone leaves.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Good job.</p>
<p>(Greg looks at Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I don't get it. I got the wrong guy, the wrong manner of death.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I don't expect you to be correct in all your interpretations all the time. You collected the evidence. You thought there was something missing, you went back and found it. Hey, that's the job. Congratulations, Greg.</p>
<p>(They shake hands.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>(In the doorway, Catherine holds up a bottle of champagne while the others hold their glasses. They're waiting for Greg.) </p>
<p>(Greg goes to join them. He rushes over and they hand him his glass.) </p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong>: Cheers. To you.</p>
<p>(Camera holds on Grissom as he watches them celebrate.) </p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK</p>

<p>[EXT. OAKLEY'S OLD WEST TOWN -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(A man wearing an old leather duster and a cowboy hat walks through the middle of the town's dirt road. His spurs jingle with every step.) </p>
<p>(Lightning flashes and thunder rumbles.) </p>
<p>(The man stops and puts his thick leather gloves on. The wind howls, stirring up dust.) </p>
<p>[INT. OAKLEY'S OLD WEST TOWN -- SALOON – CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(The dark-haired woman drinks a shot and puts her glass down on the bar counter. She turns. It's Lady Heather.) </p>
<p>(The saloon doors are pushed open and the man walks in. Lightning flashes and thunder rumbles.) </p>
<p>(She turns and leans against the bar.) </p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: You're late.</p>
<p>(The man takes the thick rope he has hanging from his belt and unravels it. He rolls the rope around his hand.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(The man has the rope wound around Lady Heather's neck. He kicks a random bar chair over.) </p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: Now say it.</p>
<p>(He holds the rope tight around her neck.) </p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: I said ... say it.</p>
<p>(He keeps his hold on the rope. Lady Heather gags.) </p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: You have to say it. Say it.</p>
<p>(Lady Heather gags. Her hand slips from gripping his arm as she loses consciousness.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. OAKLEY'S OLD WEST TOWN – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The lights in the western town are turned on. The dirt road is lit up. The paramedic rolls the gurney toward the ambulance as Catherine walks past. She sees it's Lady Heather.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Is she going to be okay?</p>
<p><strong>Paramedic</strong>: Yes, ma'am, she's stable. Severe trauma to the neck.</p>
<p>(Lady Heather's eyes open.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Heather, I'm Catherine Willows. I don't know if you remember me. It's going to be all right.</p>
<p>(Brass joins Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Like a bad penny, some people just keep showing up.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Did you call Grissom?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No.</p>
<p>(Catherine nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Who found her?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Guy over there in the ten-gallon -- Vernon Porter.</p>
<p>(Catherine turns and sees a man dressed as a sheriff talking with an officer.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: He's a night watchman. All the employees are required to wear that cowboy getup. That's the job that cops get after they retire.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You've got something to look forward to, Jim.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yes, ma'am.</p>
<p>(They turn and walk over toward the saloon. Catherine sees some spit on the wooden floor near the spittoon.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Chewing tobacco. Looks fresh.</p>
<p>(She puts evidence marker #1 down near the spit.) </p>
<p>[INT. OAKLEY'S OLD WEST TOWN -- SALOON – CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Catherine and Brass enter the saloon. Piano music plays in the background. Catherine looks around the saloon at the gaming tables and life-sized western mannequins sitting at the tables.) </p>
<p>(Catherine sees the overturned bar stool.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Lady Heather has a house for this. Why take her show on the road?</p>
<p>(Brass motions to the player piano.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Do you think you know how to ... ?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(Catherine turns the piano off.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, you're a genius. (He motions to the floor.) Well, this is where we found her.</p>
<p>(Catherine sees the rope on the floor.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Did she have ligature marks?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: On her neck, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, that doesn't make any sense. She was a dominatrix. Not a submissive.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Maybe the party just got out of control.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Or somebody didn't know the rules.</p>

<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[INT. CSI – BREAK ROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Greg is in the break room going through some files. Grissom walks in carrying his cup.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: These files are out of control. Typos, white-outs, names missing, whole sections missing.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Twenty years ago, the county was still using typewriters. Did you find anything?</p>
<p>(Greg picks up a paper.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Ernie Dell's foster child. Donna Catalani. Lived with the Dells for a year. Her CASA report came with a supplemental. They forgot to black out her social security number.</p>
<p>(He hands the paper to Grissom, who puts his glasses on to look at it.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: We can use that to track her down, unless the adoptives changed it.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Good. I'll run it. I have to pull you off of this. Days is down to four CSI's. You're on loan-out.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Why can't Days keep anybody?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Money, stress, Ecklie, maybe. Just help them with their backlog.</p>
<p>(Grissom turns and leaves the room.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>[EXT. OAKLEY'S OLD WEST TOWN -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Brass talks with Vernon Porter.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So you're sure that the gate was locked?</p>
<p><strong>Vernon Porter</strong>: I come on at 6:00 when Oakley's closes. The first thing I do is lock the gate.</p>
<p>(He shows Brass the keys on his large key ring hanging from his belt.) </p>
<p><strong>Vernon Porter</strong>: Make my rounds every two hours. </p>
<p>(As Brass watches, Vernon tucks a large wad of tobacco in his mouth and chews.) </p>
<p><strong>Vernon Porter</strong>: 8:00, 10:00, 12:00 -- everything was Code 4.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: When did things go Code 3?</p>
<p><strong>Vernon Porter</strong>: Found the main gate unlocked at 0214. Went to check out the street, heard that music. Found her on the floor, called it in.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. OAKLEY'S OLD WEST TOWN -- SALOON – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Sara snaps a photo of the broken bootle on the counter. Catherine examines the piano.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: This is a family theme park. I'm assuming they don't actually serve alcohol here. Must have brought their own.</p>
<p>(Sara picks up the label:<br />
THE GLEN EDMONDS<br />
30 YEAR OLD<br />
PURE SINGLE MALT SCOTCH WHISKEY<br />
PRODUCT OF SCOTLAND<br />
UNHURRIED SINCE 1924 )</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (reads) Single malt, twelve years old.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: S &amp; M is a rich man's sport. Kind of like hockey -- a lot of equipment.</p>
<p>(Catherine takes a swab of something under the piano.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: How much do you think a night like this would cost?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Heather told me, five years ago, she was clearing 20 grand a week.<br />
(Sara's shocked.) And that was before ladyheather.com.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What is she like?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Beautiful ... smart, intense ... charming. The only woman I've ever seen rattle Grissom. I mean, he kind of liked that forensic anthropologist, Terry Miller. Remember her?</p>
<p>(Sara puts the label in a bag.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(She picks up her camera. Catherine opens an evidence bag.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: But she wasn't enough of a challenge for him.</p>
<p>(She picks up the rope and puts it in the bag.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Heather, on the other hand ... uninhibited and can beat him at mental chess. </p>
<p>(Sara snaps a picture.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: They had chemistry. And he is a scientist.</p>
<p>(Catherine stands up.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I have no proof and I know he'd never tell me, but I'm certain they spent the night together. Wonder which one wore the chaps.</p>
<p>(Way too much information.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Lots of ... (clears throat) ... coins and toothpicks. They don't sweep under here.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I mean, more power to him, really, to find somebody outside of work<br />
'cause you start fishing from the company pier, and ... asking for trouble.</p>
<p>(Sara picks up a glass and looks at it.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I got a shot glass. Looks like there's some lipstick around the rim.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: My fantasy does not include costumes, or pain ...</p>
<p>(Sara turns and looks at Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: -- and certainly not sawdust.</p>
<p>(Catherine brushes the sawdust off her pants.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You?</p>
<p>(We hold on Sara's stunned expression.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) – NIGHT]</p>
<p>[EXT. STREET -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Sofia, Nick and Warrick walk over to the body on the concrete.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Patrol found her.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Any witnesses?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: No. No businesses open, no cars on the side streets.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So how'd she get here?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Well, in this neighborhood, unless she's a hooker, I doubt she walked. I'm going to go make some calls, see if any of these places have any security cameras.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>(Sofia leaves them.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: That's a pretty nasty head wound. Where's Super Dave?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: He's probably at the 420 on Flamingo. They left their purse.</p>
<p>(Warrick picks up the bag.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Oh! The thing is heavier than my kid. Ever get hit in the head with one of these? </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No. Gentlemen don't get hit in the head with those.</p>
<p>(Nick snaps a photo of the victim's face.) </p>
<p>(Warrick takes out several driver licenses. We see the one on the top and the address of the second under it:<br />

<p>JEFFREY LANIER<br />

LAS VEGAS, NV 89151 ) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Keysha Sayrun?</p>
<p>(Warrick holds out the driver license to compare the photo to the victim.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, that's not her.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Maybe it's not her purse.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: There's a whole bunch of wallets in here. Driver's permit. Kid's only 15 --</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: -- has got a credit card? She's got to be a pickpocket.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Aw, man, that's a shame. Look at her. She could be anything she wanted to be. Makes you wonder what happens to people.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I got her.</p>
<p>(Warrick finds the right ID.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Faith Maroney. Twenty-five ... from Southern Highlands.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Sometimes I miss the days when I didn't take this job so personally, Warrick.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah? Well, I miss the days when we only had five homicides a week.</p>

[INT. CSI – GRISSOM'S OFFICE -- NIGHT] </p>

[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) – NIGHT]</p>
<p>[INT. HOSPITAL – LADY HEATHER'S ROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Lady Heather talks with Brass.) </p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: I was planning an Old West party. I was checking out the facilities.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So why couldn't you check them out during normal business hours?</p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: It was my normal business hours.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know, we spoke to the night watchman. He said the gate was locked. How did you get in?</p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: I know the owner.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Do you know him the way you know Judge Fincher? Because I know that's how you got out of jail last time. I need a name.</p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: Mr. Oakley. I have his number, but not on me. You'll have to look it up.</p>
<p>(There's a knock on the door. Sara walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hi. I'm with the Crime Lab. Sara Sidle.</p>
<p>(Lady Heather watches Sara walk in and put her kit down on the table.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'm here to collect your clothes and trace evidence from your body.</p>
<p>(She looks away.) </p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: Can I say no?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Why would you want to? (to Brass) Did the nurse forget to collect an SAE kit?</p>
<p>(Sara takes her camera out.) </p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: Not necessary.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You don't want help, that's okay by me. Just don't waste my time. I've got a lot of cases on my desk that need my attention. So when you come out of your haze, give me a call.</p>
<p>(Brass leaves.) </p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: I don't respond well to men who judge me based solely on my profession.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I get that a lot, too. (She offers Heather a smile.) Law enforcement.</p>
<p>(Lady Heather smiles back. Her smile fades.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: May I move your hair?</p>
<p>(Lady Heather nods.) </p>
<p>(Sara reaches out and gently moves Lady Heather's hair aside to expose the bruises on her neck. She snaps photos of the markings. Lady Heather closes her eyes.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: These look like rope marks on your neck.</p>
<p>(Lady Heather opens her eyes. Sara takes a couple more photos.) </p>
<p>(Lady Heather's eyes brighten as she sees someone outside the room, behind Sara.)</p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: (softly) Grissom.</p>
<p>(Sara turns around and finds Grissom standing in the open doorway.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'll be done in a minute.</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What's the matter, Doc; you been hitting it a little too hard?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: No, canine-induced insomnia. We're fostering some puppies-- Jack Russells. Had me up all night. How about a puppy to keep you company?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No, if I stay up all night, it's not going to be because of a puppy. COD?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Okay, uh, blunt force trauma to the left temporal region of the skull. The skull's fractured.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Any idea what kind of weapon might have been used?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: No, but I found these imbedded in the skull.</p>
<p>(Robbins lifts the pan with the sample on it.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Paint chips? Could she have been hit by a car?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Well, it's possible. But if she was standing when she was hit, I'd expect to find pedestrian fractures on her legs. And there are no run-over marks, so she wasn't in a prone position.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So if she wasn't standing or lying down ...</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: She was somewhere in-between.</p>

<p><strong>Officer Mitchell</strong>: Your call.</p>
<p>(Officer Mitchell leaves.) </p>
<p>(Nick looks down on the road and finds yellow paint chips. Behind him, a station wagon takes the corner and smashes into the police car parked on the road behind Nick.) </p>
<p>(The car horn blares.) </p>
<p>(The passenger door of the station wagon opens and a man crawls out.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Mitchell</strong>: (muffled) </p>
<p>(He heads around the car to check on the driver. Nick heads for the passenger.) </p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Not the street. Not the street.</p>

<p><strong>Chandru &quot;Dru&quot; Kambhatla</strong>: He tries to steal my fare. She tries to steal my wallet, and I am arrested.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So why didn't you just report the accident?</p>
<p><strong>Chandru &quot;Dru&quot; Kambhatla</strong>: You hit a pedestrian, it is always your fault.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, you were stopped and Gus hit you, pushing your cab into her. Now, that's not your fault. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>Chandru &quot;Dru&quot; Kambhatla</strong>: Gus said it was. And he has been driving for thirty years. My cab hit her, so I am guilty.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, well, Gus doesn't know the law, but I do. What else did he say to you? Mr. Kambhatla, this may be the last chance you have to tell me the truth, now.</p>
<p><strong>Chandru &quot;Dru&quot; Kambhatla</strong>: We made a deal.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay. Okay. What kind of deal?</p>
<p><strong>Chandru &quot;Dru&quot; Kambhatla</strong>: He said if I don't report him for staging, and hitting me, then he would keep quiet about me hitting the girl. And I can stay in this country ... with my mother and sisters. I need to be here to make money for them. I'm telling the truth now. Is going to be okay, right?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No, sir, unfortunately, that's not the way it works. I've got you for obstruction, for fleeing the scene, and now you're an accessory. I'm sorry, man. I know you're confused, but ... you just made a deal with the wrong guy.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LADY HEATHER'S RESIDENCE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Brass, Catherine and several officers arrive on Lady Heather's front door. Catherine knocks. Lady Heather opens the door.) </p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: This isn't a good time.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We have a warrant to search your house. And you'd better put some sunblock on because we're going downtown.</p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: My memory isn't any better than it was yesterday. I'm not up to it.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, we'll swing by the hospital. And you can explain to them why you checked yourself out early, against doctor's orders.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We're investigating a homicide.</p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: I don't understand.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Where were you last night?</p>
<p>(She opens the door for them.) </p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: You may come in.</p>
<p>[INT. LADY HEATHER'S RESIDENCE – DAY -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(Catherine and Brass walk into the house.)</p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: I was here.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Can anyone verify that? Preferably someone not on the payroll.</p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: Captain Brass would like to know where I was last night.</p>
<p>(Catherine and Brass turn around. Grissom steps out into the room carrying a coffee cup.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: She was here ... with me.</p>
<p>(Grissom takes a sip from his cup. Catherine turns and looks at Lady Heather. Everyone looks at each other.) </p>
<p>(We hold on Grissom.) </p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>

<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) – DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. CSI – GRISSOM'S OFFICE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Catherine talks with Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You were there all night. Want to explain why? Look, I know that you don't go home and cuddle your insects every single night, but why would you go there knowing that we're in the middle of an investigation? And now she's a prime suspect with you as her alibi.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It was a social call, that's all.</p>
<p>(Grissom sits down.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, when your personal life gets tangled up in a case, that's off limits?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Isn't that a little hypocritical? </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Apparently so.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You know I'd slap you, but I think you'd enjoy it too much.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Look, I went to Heather's on a hunch. There's something not right with her.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (disgruntled) Your timing sucked.</p>
<p>(Catherine notices the miniature on Grissom's desk.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What's this? So now you're building your own?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah. Keeps my hands busy.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – BRASS'S OFFICE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Brass talks with Lady Heather.) </p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: You think I paid someone to kill Porter and then used Grissom as my alibi?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: And with your history, yes. How do you know Vernon Porter?</p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: He did some work for me. I helped him get the job at Oakley's.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know what? That's the first thing you said to me that doesn't sound like a lie. What kind of work?</p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: I needed to locate someone.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So an ex-cop does some legwork for you. So what happened-- did you have a falling out or he threaten you?</p>
<p>(She takes her phone out and lets Brass listen to the message.) </p>
<p><strong>Electronic Voice</strong>: (from phone) First skipped message. Received yesterday at<br />
12:02 p.m.</p>
<p><strong>Vernon Porter</strong>: (from phone) Hey, Heather, Vernon. Looks like you got yourself into something. If you need anything, call me. Call me anyway. Let me know you're okay.</p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: Does that sound like a man who wants to hurt me, Captain Brass?</p>
<p>(She closes the phone.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, I don't know, Heather. I don't know. I mean, you get assaulted at Old West Town where he works, he calls it in, then he ends up dead. What is it, just one big coincidence?</p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: I already told you I was there on business. Mr. Porter had nothing to do with it.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, but it was your business that got him killed. Come on, come on, we both know that you weren't there for some western hoedown. So what were you doing there?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – LAYOUT ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Catherine and Sara are at the table. Wendy walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Wendy Simms</strong>: The semen on the tissue in the bathroom did not come from Vernon Porter.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, the underwear that I pulled from the toilet was a 38-inch waist. Porter was a 34. He didn't attack Heather.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: But we know he was there.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: One of Heather's clients pays for a kinky Wild West fantasy only to discover he had an audience?</p>
<p><strong>Wendy Simms</strong>: Well, I don't want to derail this but why kill Porter and not go after Heather?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: 'Cause she's not talking. Her business is based on discretion. Couldn't count on Porter's discretion.</p>
<p>(Catherine's phone rings. She checks the message.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So this client goes back to Oakley's the next night and shoots Porter.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, Mandy got a hit off the revolver and the ammo box.</p>
<p>(Catherine's message reads:<br />
2. MANDY<br />
GOT A HIT. SUSPECT<br />
BENJAMIN OAKLEY</p>
<p>From: Mandy<br />
To: Catherine<br />
Received: 05/10 1:48 PM</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Benjamin Oakley.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: His family owns the place. He had access.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, I'm calling Brass.</p>
<p>(Catherine turns and heads out. Wendy also leaves the lab. Grissom walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to Grissom) Sara will fill you in. (to phone) Hey, Jim ...</p>
<p>(Grissom looks at Sara.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We may have a suspect.</p>
<p>(Sara gathers up the photos from the table. Grissom watches her for a moment.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm the only one Heather trusts.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I get it.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sara ...</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah? </p>
<p>(Grissom looks like he wants to say more.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It's fine. Do what you need to do.</p>
<p>(Sara takes the photos and leaves the room.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – GRISSOM'S OFFICE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Grissom is reading TEXTBOOK OF PSYCHIATRY. He's reading Chapter 9, &quot;Mood disorders, suicide and parasuicide.&quot;) </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Lady Heather talks with Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: When the submissive accepts they're in control, that's when they embrace their true power. They can say &quot;stop.&quot; They can choose to either end the pain or continue enduring it. But ... higher consciousness doesn't negate our animal instinct to survive.</p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p>(Judy startles Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Judy Tremont</strong>: Dr. Grissom, you requested a custody file from the court.</p>
<p>(She hands him the file.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Thank you, Judy.</p>
<p><strong>Judy Tremont</strong>: I'm assuming it's for your investigation into the Miniature Killer. Everybody in the lab believes you're gonna get him.</p>
<p>(She smiles and gives him two thumbs up. He nods. She leaves the office.) </p>
<p>(Grissom looks at the papers:<br />
HEATHER KESSLER, PETITIONER<br />
VS.<br />
JEROME KESSLER, RESPONDENT</p>
<p>FOCUS ON THE WORDS: </p>
<p>DENIES VISITATION RIGHTS TO PETITIONER,<br />
DISSOLVE TO: MORE WORDS</p>
<p>MATERNAL GRANDMOTHER, HEATHER KESSLER</p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO: MORE WORDS</p>
<p>FULL CUSTODY AWARDED TO JEROME KESSLER, MATERNAL GRANDFATHER OF THE CHILD.</p>
<p>QUICK FLASH TO:</p>
<p>(There are two framed photos on the mantle. The first is of Heather and her daughter, Zoe. Grissom picks up a second framed photo of Jerome Kessler with the baby girl. The photo appears to be taken without their knowledge.) </p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: She's all I have left of Zoe. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Scene from 6X15: Pirates of the Third Reich) </p>
<p>[INT. FORENSIC AUTOPSY – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Zoe's body is on the table. Lady Heather caresses her daughter's cheek.) </p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: Can you tell if she's ever given birth?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: There was some scarring on her pelvic bones, but given the condition of the body, it's hard to say for sure.</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: CU: THE PHOTO OF JEROME AND THEIR GRANDDAUGHTER.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This is your granddaughter. Did you take this picture?</p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: I hired someone to find her. I can't give her love, but I can give her the freedom to be who she wants to be.</p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. CITY (STOCK) – DAY]</p>
<p>[EXT. PARK -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Grissom talks with Jerome Kessler.) </p>
<p><strong>Jerome Kessler</strong>: Is this official police business?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Kessler</strong>: Did Heather send you?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No, I'm just a friend of hers.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Kessler</strong>: Did she tell you about me?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Kessler</strong>: We were married very young. Didn't last long. Heather left without telling me she was pregnant. I wasn't aware I had a child until after Zoe was already dead.</p>
<p>(Grissom nods and looks over at Alison playing on a blanket.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's Zoe's daughter, Heather's granddaughter.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Kessler</strong>: Her name is Alison. So why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm just trying to understand what's happening to her.</p>
<p>(Alison walks up to Jerome to hand him something. He leans forward and listens to her childish babbling.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm aware that the court has denied her visitation rights.</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Kessler</strong>: Wouldn't you?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm not sure. (Jerome is quiet.) Has Heather tried to give you any money for Alison?</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Kessler</strong>: Yes, the day before yesterday I got a call from the bank. Heather had set up a very generous trust fund for her, no strings attached. I assumed she sold her house.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Can you tell me how much?</p>
<p><strong>Jerome Kessler</strong>: $843,508. I know Heather had closed her business a few months ago, trying to convince the judge she'd be a fit guardian, so it had to be from the sale.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I wonder if she calculated the exact amount it would cost to raise a child and put her through college, especially at Harvard. That's where she sent Zoe. But it wasn't her house that she sold.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – INTERVIEW ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Catherine and Brass interview Benjamin Oakley.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You took a shot at Porter.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: That's attempted murder. Your dad's not going to like that, Benny.</p>
<p>(Catherine shows him the warrant.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: This is a warrant for your DNA.</p>
<p><strong>Benjamin Oakley</strong>: Why do you need my DNA?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: To prove that you also attacked Heather Kessler.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: And that makes two attempted murders. And that adds up to a lot of jail time, bud.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Open up.</p>
<p><strong>Benjamin Oakley</strong>: I didn't touch her, okay? I didn't kill Porter.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What do you want, a gold star for being a bad shot?</p>
<p><strong>Benjamin Oakley</strong>: (sighs) Porter knew I lied. He wanted fifty grand to keep his mouth shut. And I was gonna pay him. I went to the bank to get the money, but somebody drained the account.</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: [BANK] Benjamin goes to the bank. The transfer amount on the screen is for: $843,508.00. The remaining balance is for: $31,053.86.) </p>
<p><strong>Benjamin Oakley</strong>: There was a million dollars in that account last week. Who authorized the transfer?</p>
<p><strong>Bank Officer</strong>: (o.s.) Jack Oakley.</p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Benjamin Oakley</strong>: I went there to kill my father. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [INT. GUN SLINGER MUSEUM] Benjamin opens the display case and takes a gun out.) </p>
<p><strong>Benjamin Oakley</strong>: (V.O.) I knew he was going to meet Heather, but for some reason, she didn't show. And Porter got up the courage to ask my dad for the money. He'd seen my father with Heather.</p>
<p>(Cut to: Jack and Vernon argue in the street.) </p>
<p><strong>Jack Oakley</strong>: You sick b*st*rd!</p>
<p><strong>Vernon Porter</strong>: You got 24 hours, then I turn you in!</p>
<p>(Vernon takes a couple steps out and stops when he sees Benjamin exit the museum.)</p>
<p>(A gun fires. Porter falls to show Jack with the smoking gun in his hand.) </p>
<p>(Benjamin raises the gun and points it at his father. Jack advances on Benjamin. Benjamin fires wildly and hits the glass in the saloon.) </p>
<p>(Jack walks up to Benjamin.) </p>
<p><strong>Benjamin Oakley</strong>: (V.O.) The Marquis de Sade's got nothing on my old man. Inflicting pain is his idea of foreplay.</p>
<p><strong>Jack Oakley</strong>: You're your mother's son, not mine.</p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Benjamin Oakley</strong>: Do you know how much money he spent abusing women? He didn't leave anything for my mother and me except for more abuse. It had to stop.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Where is he?</p>
<p><strong>Benjamin Oakley</strong>: His phone's off; every time his phone's off, he's with her.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Is he at the saloon?</p>
<p><strong>Benjamin Oakley</strong>: No, he wouldn't do that, not after Porter.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: He's got to be at Heather's.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) – DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. HEATHER'S PLACE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(The officer puts the cuffs on Jack Oakley.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So your sick fantasy was to kill her.</p>
<p><strong>Benjamin Oakley</strong>: I didn't do anything. She solicited me. Strictly a business deal. She needed the money. I paid her close to $1 million for this, you know that? That's about all I'm gonna say. I'll be talking with my lawyer.</p>
<p>(The officers leave with Jack.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Too bad you spent the million. You could use it on your defense.</p>
<p>(Brass turns to look at Lady Heather sitting in her chair.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Look, Heather, for what it's worth, I think you're in the clear. The DA's not gonna press charges. Attempted murder, assisted suicide, the lines are kind of blurred. But do yourself a favor. Get some help.</p>
<p>(Heather doesn't say anything.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. HEATHER'S RESIDENCE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(The officers escort Jack to the car and put him in the back seat.) </p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO: </p>
<p>(The officer cars leave. The place is quiet and empty.) </p>
<p><strong>Cue Sound</strong>: KNOCKING</p>
<p>[EXT. HEATHER'S RESIDENCE – FRONT PORCH – DAY]</p>
<p>(Heather opens the door. Grissom smiles at her.) </p>
<p><strong>Heather</strong>: Leave me alone. I didn't ask you to save me.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I know. What am I supposed to do? I'm your friend. Besides, there's someone I want you to meet.</p>
<p>(He motions for her to step outside. He takes her hand and she joins him on the porch.)</p>
<p>(Jerome Kessler walks toward her with Alison in his arms.) </p>
<p>(Heather looks at Grissom, then goes to meet her grand-daughter.) </p>
<p><strong>Heather</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p>(Grissom watches them.) </p>

[INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(A woman is preparing to take a bath. She wraps a towel around her naked body. She removes her underwear while the water in the tub fills with hot water and bubbles.)</p>
<p>(She tests the temperature of the bath water with her foot.)</p>
<p>(She adds bath oil/bath scent to the water.)</p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO:</p>
<p>(Close up of a cosmetics kit being unrolled.)</p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO:</p>
<p>(The woman is sitting in front of a dressing mirror. She is facing the mirror and her back is to us. We can't see her face. She puts her hair up and holds it in place with a hair clip.)</p>
<p>(She selects a pair of tweezers from the cosmetics kit.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(Top view shot of the bath tub filling with water.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: The woman starts on her pre-bath ritual.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: A top view of the bath tub with bath bubbles and a fashion magazine, &quot;VEGAS&quot; on the floor nearby. The water flows over the lip of the tub onto the floor. The water and bath bubbles cover the magazine completely from our view.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. WAITING ROOM -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM is reading a book. It's very quiet.)</p>
<p>(The nurse looks up at GRISSOM. GRISSOM looks up at the nurse and we hear a cell phone ring. He answers his phone.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (on phone) Grissom. (pause) I'll be right there.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM stands and approaches the nurse.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Please tell the doctor that I have to reschedule my appointment. Thanks.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM doesn't wait for an answer. He leaves.)</p>
<p><strong>Nurse</strong>: She should be right with ... you.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. UNDER THE BRIDGE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(BRASS is there talking with a man with a clipboard in a jacket. He's standing in front of a shopping cart ... and there's a dead body in the shopping cart, but you don't really notice it.)</p>
<p>(Behind them, GRISSOM'S SUV pulls up to the police tape, parks and GRISSOM emerges carrying his kit. He locks his car and approaches BRASS and the shopping cart with the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Any I.D. Yet?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Nothing but a blanket.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM flashes his light on the body and we see that it's a woman and she has cuts and blemishes on her face. She's wrapped in a blanket and her eyes are closed. He looks around at the environment. He turns left and right and sees some homeless people sleeping on the ground with their shopping carts near them.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: She live here?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Ah ... we don't know. Patrol called it in. Well, whoever she is she's not talking.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM moves in closer to the body for a better look. As he does, her mouth begins to move. Her mouth suddenly opens and a rat crawls out.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Whoa.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I think she just ratted herself out.</p>
<p>(Camera holds on BRASS.)</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO: END OF TEASER. ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>[Captioning sponsored by CBS CBS productions and Volkswagen. Captioned by media access group at WGBH access.Wgbh.Org]</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
[EXT. GROUND VIEW OF THE HIGHWAY - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The camera starts with the billboard and pans around the bridge to stop on an overhead shot of the crime scene. The Coroner's van pulls away. Police Radio Transmissions can be heard in the background.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks around looking for evidence to mark for collection. In his left hand, he holds yellow markers. The number showing on the next marker is #4.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM sees something on the ground and places the number 5 marker down next to something that could possibly be blood on a rock and a small pool of it near by. He continues to look around. He spots the shopping cart and approaches it.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM starts looking through the cart. He moves the blanket away and sees a purse underneath. He pulls out a day planner. He goes through the bag and sees six syringes on the bottom of the purse.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) Drug use?</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. FORENSIC AUTOPSY]</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: No visible track marks. Tox screen came up empty except for botulin.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Food poisoning?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: I'll know more when I cut open her stomach. Heard about the rat. Hope he didn't have any children. Take a look at these tiny puncture wounds in her forehead. Indicates repeated injections. You sure she's homeless?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sometimes I'm not sure of anything.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Educated guess: Beautification. She was injected with pig botulism. </p>
<p>(Flash to white. Flash CGI of syringe penetrating the skin in the forehead to the muscle beneath and liquid spurting out. The needle pulls out. End of CGI.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Botox ... the ultimate wrinkle cream.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How did it get into her bloodstream?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Bad doctor. Missed the muscle. Shot directly into her supratrochlear vein.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Amazing the advances we make in science and the primitive uses we find for them.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: People are still animals. Signs of possible torture. A lot of scarring. Some old, some new.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What about the crater in her check?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: The dove-tail abrasion of the margins was caused by the scraping of the handle of some weapon. Tells me the blade was completely inserted -- more than once.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks down at the woman's arm. We see only smooth skin.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: There's no ligature marks anywhere. I'd think she would need to be restrained for something like that, wouldn't you?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Give me a few hours; I'll know more.</p>

[INT. CSI -- LAB]</p>
<p>[SARA turns on the light for the overhead projector. She has the day planner open on screen. She flips the page to the date: 05/09/02 written in the top right corner. The page has the following: </p>

<p>(WARRICK walks into the lab.)</p>
<p><strong>Brown</strong>: Show and tell. Who?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Showing but not telling. I found a day planner in the shopping cart.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It's written in code. &quot;T to the third power. C 1023, minus ten O.K. equals zero.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Looks like ginkwork. It's the kind of thing speed freaks do when they've been up for ten days straight and they've already taken apart the radio.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah. I write everything down in shorthand. You couldn't read it.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Shorthand?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Keeps things in order.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You're not a control freak or anything?</p>
<p>(SARA doesn't look at WARRICK. She smiles and mumbles ... )</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No.</p>
<p>(WARRICK sees something across the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Sara ... what's a homeless woman doing with a day planner and a $300 handbag?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: That handbag costs $300?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: How'd you know that?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I bought one for an ex-girlfriend once.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p>(Camera holds on WARRICK as he glances back at SARA and chuckles at her reaction.)</p>

[INT. CSI - A/V LAB]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks into DUSTY'S OFFICE. DUSTY is taking a image of the victim's mutilated face and is reconstructing it digitally on the computer.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Dusty, we got no hits on the fingerprints and no one fitting her description has been reported missing.</p>
<p><strong>Dusty</strong>: Oh, she's not missing? She's in my world. I'm just mirroring some good cheek on top of some bad cheek.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Dusty</strong>: I'll fix her forehead. </p>
<p>(DUSTY works on clearing the injuries off of the victim's face so that they can better identify her.)</p>
<p><strong>Dusty</strong>: Her chin ... what a mess.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Dusty</strong>: I'm going to do a little cloning here. She actually had a really nice complexion. Perfect porcelain face.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What can you do about the hair?</p>
<p><strong>Dusty</strong>: It's a macro. What kind of hair do you want her to have? Blonde? ... like Courtney love?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Sounds good to me.</p>
<p><strong>Dusty</strong>: Let's give her some eyes ... blue.</p>
<p>(DUSTY finishes the digital reconstruction and looks at the image of the woman. She frowns.)</p>
<p><strong>Dusty</strong>: I know her from somewhere.</p>
<p>(This surprises CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You do?</p>
<p><strong>Dusty</strong>: Yeah.</p>

<p>[Headline on the bottom reads: &quot;Bill Belt: magic act&quot;]<br />
[Ad on the back of the magazine: &quot;Great Expectations&quot;]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM glances down at the magazine and then looks back up at CATHERINE who put it there.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Why are you showing me this?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The cover girl, Ashleigh James -- she's your girl in the shopping cart. P.D.'S tracking down her agency now. Somebody wanted her dead.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes out the post-mortem photograph of Ashleigh James and looks at the two pictures side by side. The magazine cover on the left and the post-mortem picture on the right.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: They also wanted her ugly.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>

[EXT. ASHLEIGH JAMES' LOFT - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and CATHERINE get out of the car with their CSI kits just outside ASHLEIGH JAMES' loft. They meet BRASS outside. The officers behind him stand next to door #929.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: It's called gentrification.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It's not doing anything to gentrify them.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Tell that to the mayor. The landlord's on vacation. It's a good thing because he's got a swimming pool in his basement.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. ASHLEIGH JAMES' LOFT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Ashleigh James apartment ...</p>
<p>[CLOSED-CAPTION READS: BRASS: ... tub overflowed.]</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Who turned the water off?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The first officer on the scene found the door open. After that, he didn't touch a thing.</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: (o.s.) Captain?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, what have you got?</p>
<p>(BRASS leaves the two alone to see what the officer wants. CATHERINE continues straight on into the loft. GRISSOM turns left and examines the many Ashleigh James pictures on the wall.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, Narcissus would be proud.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Very much a woman, yet still a little girl.</p>
<p>(The camera notes the three rag dolls on the bed that CATHERINE'S referencing.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM stops by a small table with burned candles and candle wax on the table top. There is also some white powdery substance on it.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I thought Doc Robbins said the victim's tox screen came back negative.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No, she wasn't a user. But maybe the boyfriend was. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE finds a man's toiletry kit in the cabinet. She opens it and holds out a man's razor.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Let's hope he nicked himself.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM holds up a scoop of the white powdery stuff and smells it.)</p>

<p>(BRASS tosses the car keys to NICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Find anything?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No. Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Anything out front?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Just a couple of homeless guys.</p>
<p>(NICK opens the car and sees it littered with wrappers and other food junk. There are empty drinking cups and carriers. NICK picks up an empty wrapper and turns to BRASS.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You, uh, you sure this is the vic's?</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Contextualizing. Shopping cart in the lab is like a lion in a zoo. I needed to see it in its natural habitat.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Question: How did Ashleigh James get from her loft to this underpass?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: She didn't walk.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm pretty sure she was pushed.</p>
<p>(Both SARA and GRISSOM look thoughtfully back in the direction of ASHLEIGH JAMES' loft.)</p>
<p>(Then, like a dance, GRISSOM looks right, SARA looks right. Then GRISSOM looks left; SARA looks left. They're both thoughtful and thinking. They both turn to look to their right once more. Finally, SARA sees something.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Grissom ... is that Ashleigh James?</p>
<p>(High above the highway overpass, ASHLEIGH JAMES' picture is on a billboard: )</p>
<p>[&quot;Welcome to Las Vegas Yours to Discover. Call 555-JACKPOT&quot;]</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: She was under her own billboard.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Coincidence?</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey. You like crossword puzzles. How are you at deciphering codes?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Aren't you putting the shopping cart before the horse? In order to decipher a code you need to know the alphabet for the code. In order to know the alphabet, you need to know the author.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM moves to look at the shopping cart.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So, what's the cart telling us?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: About the victim? </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, the victim had no relationship to the cart except for the fact that we found her in it. I'm more interested in the person who used to call this cart home.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, aside from the leather day runner and the Kate Swan bag -- which appear to be from Ashleigh James's world -- you got mostly collectibles. Newspapers, review journals, the Sun ... various editions going back several months. A couple of tennis rackets ... </p>
<p>(GRISSOM picks up a newspaper and begins leafing through it as SARA talks.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: ... a broom, an umbrella, a pot ... I guess some kind of glove or something.</p>
<p>(He flips the newspaper over and sees a full page photograph ad of ASHLEIGH JAMES.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I stand corrected.</p>
<p>(SARA picks up the next newspaper and notices the same thing: a full page photograph ad of ASHLEIGH JAMES on the back of the paper.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I have a feeling whoever owned this cart ... was an Ashleigh James fan.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Rod Darling</strong>: Sorry about what happened but she wasn't a client anymore. I dropped her a couple of months ago.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Did you forget to pack? We found men's clothing and personal items at her place.</p>
<p><strong>Rod Darling</strong>: She was a screwed up kid looking for a father figure. </p>

As he walks down the same alley that ASHLEIGH JAMES traveled, he passes the homeless man and his dog. He sees a man digging through a trash can. He moves in closer to the man and looks himself into one of the garbage bins. He reaches inside the garbage bin.)</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It depends.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM moves in a little closer to the Homeless Man to take a better look at the scarf. The Homeless Man takes a wary step back.)</p>
<p><strong>Tookie</strong>: Ooh, hey. Don't even think that you can play me, my man.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm not playing. I've got a gal named Sara, and she would love that scarf. What do you say? </p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes off his jacket and holds it out to the man.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Trade me.</p>
<p><strong>Tookie</strong>: Yeah. What the hell.</p>
<p>(The man takes the scarf off and gives it to GRISSOM. He grabs the jacket as he does so. He turns away and resumes exploring the trash.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns on his flashlight and takes a closer look at the scarf he holds. A woman witnesses the trade and takes exception. Carrying a green plastic crate full of stuff, she approaches GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Cassie James</strong>: Hey. Hey, hey, Mister. Hey, Mister, that is Tookie's scarf. That is his scarf. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks up just in time to pull the scarf away from the homeless woman's grasp as she tries to take it from him. He points the flashlight at her face. She shys away from the glare.)</p>
<p><strong>Cassie James</strong>: I gave it to him. That is Tookie's. Are you a Taker ... or are you a Giver, Mister?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm a Trader. I traded Tookie my jacket for this scarf.</p>
<p><strong>Cassie James</strong>: Yeah ... and fleas can tell time.</p>

<p>(CLOSE UP of post-mortem ASHLEIGH JAMES' face lying on the autopsy table. Camera moves to give us a lovely top view of the contents of the pan that DOC ROBBINS is working on. Or was working on. We see the red Y-shaped blood stain on the sheet covering the body. GRISSOM walks in.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: I found blisters in the back of her throat.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What? Forced oral?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: That's what I thought until I noticed worn enamel on the tooth. (holds up a tooth for GRISSOM to look at) In conjunction with this red mark on the knuckle of her middle finger. (lifts up her right hand from beneath the sheet to show GRISSOM) Which made me realize it wasn't sexual abuse.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Eating disorder.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI Flash of ASHLEIGH JAMES sticking a finger down her throat. Accompanying gagging track and sloshing water for sound at appropriate cues. Camera continues down ASHLEIGH JAMES' throat ... all the way down till it hits the good stuff coming back up ... and up ... and up all the way back up ASHLEIGH JAMES' throat where the camera stays one step ahead of it ... till we get behind it and see it pass her teeth on its way out. How fun. End of CGI Flash. Resume on DOC ROBBINS.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: She was bulimic and anorexic. Which explains the down on her skin. (he pulls away the sheet from her left shoulder) Lanugo. Characteristic of premature babies and anorexics.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: She doesn't seem that skinny.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Not this week. Last week, or the week before, who knows? Binge-and-purge.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Till her entire system is in a state of shock.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: You know what's next.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Body starts feeding on its own muscle. Is that what killed her?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Uh, starvation and purging weaken the immune system. But cause of death: Failed kidney, fueled by septicemia.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Blood infection. Caused by the injuries to her face?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Probably, but she's been septic for at least a month. She has anemia borne of chronic disease. Her red cell count's low, iron's low. ESR is extremely high.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So she didn't just die. She's been dying for a long time.</p>

<p>(Clicking sound of metal balls hitting each other. GRISSOM'S thinking. There's a knock on his door. He looks up as CATHERINE walks in.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What do you know that's good?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Cassie James's psych profile.</p>
<p>[He hands the file to her. From what we can see, the report reads: </p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: &quot;Classic Paranoid Schizophrenic&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Which explains why the interrogation room was too hard on her. For schizophrenics, you know, the tighter the space, the more unbearable the feelings tend to be.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, if you ask me that's not the only psych evaluation we need.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Ashleigh James?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: That poor girl. Definitely lacking in the self-image department.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: She suffered from septicemia, indicative of chronic abuse. But ... what if Cassie wasn't the one who inflicted Ashleigh's facial wounds?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, we know it's not the ex-boyfriend -- no evidence. Not the agent -- wouldn't jeopardize an asset. And if it's not Cassie, who's left?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I don't know.</p>

<p>(The camera pans over the evidence on the table: Starting from the left, there are two full page ads from two newspapers side by side. The newspaper on the right has marker #13 on it. Marker #17 free-floats above the newspaper ad on the left. Next to and above that is the stack of mail procured from ASHLEIGH JAMES' car with marker #18 on it. Next to the newspapers are two magazine covers. Next to that are four close-up post-mortem photographs of ASHLEIGH JAMES' face. The rest of the table is covered with junk food containers, cups and various wrappers from the car.)</p>
<p>(SARA is organizing the things on the table. She's grouping all the wrappers together. She collects the wrappers and stops. Something on the wrapper she's holding catches her eye. She goes back to the notebook on the overhead.)</p>

<p>(SARA is sitting on a stool next to the image of ASHLEIGH JAMES' day planner on the television monitor.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: ... So what I realized was bulimia is a zero sum disease. That's why she has a plus sign over here and a minus sign over there. Whatever went in had to be exactly canceled by what went out.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You're talking about BDD: Body Dysmorphic Disorder.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yes. One theory suggests it's neurobiological. Another psychological -- that people with extreme sexual or emotional anxiety unconsciously displace their feelings into the arena of appearance, because it's more manageable.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You feel like crap, blame your face.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Or your skin, or your hair or that zit on your forehead.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I knew this dancer. Every night she'd stare at herself in the mirror for three hours.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Meticulous grooming, when a person suffers from BDD becomes a destructive compulsion. There's one line in her daybook that keeps repeating over and over and over again: &quot;I'm not even.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So you're saying she knew she was slipping.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No. (she points to the screen) She literally means even. A large number of BDD sufferers are convinced that they're not symmetric. That one side of their body or their face doesn't match the other.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: All animals prefer symmetry in their mates. The male Japanese scorpion flies with the most symmetrical wings gets the most mates.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So, really we're not talking about being beautiful at all.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: In terms of entomology being beautiful is about being even. It signals the fitness to procreate.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So, we're not really talking about looks. We're talking about survival of the species?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The bottom line is the same: Control and Perfectionism. That's what her code was all about.</p>
<p>[SARA adjusts the monitor to focus in on a particular grid in the day planner. This is a different (+)/(-) grid:</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Let's take &quot;HBWC/3, 1590 BC, 90 BF, 3930 S, 114 TC.&quot; Three hamburgers with cheese. </p>
<p>(Quick Flashback to ASHLEIGH JAMES eating the hamburgers quickly in her car. End of flashback.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Content 530. 530 times three is where she gets 1590 BC. That's BC for &quot;bad calories.&quot; And at 30 grams a pop 90 grams of BF.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Bad fat?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah. The rest of her formula involves sodium, total carbohydrates and the actual weight of everything she ate.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE closes her eyes at the thought.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And so, she was, uh ... operating like a scientist seeking a perfect formula to take her pain away.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Or disappear altogether. Which brings me to the minus side of her equation. She would write down the number of times she T'U'D, threw up, in this case twice-- or EVO'D.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: &quot;Evo'd&quot;?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Moving her bowels. The directions on her disposable enema box use the term &quot;evacuate&quot;. So, after her burger binge, she &quot;3 EVO'd, 14 G, 2 T'U'D, 9 G, 3 #1.&quot; She evo'd three times. But her calculations didn't stop there ... &quot;G&quot; stands for grams.</p>
<p>(Quick Flashback to ASHLEIGH JAMES carrying a ziploc'd baggie to the scale. Flash to white. ASHLEIGH JAMES looking down at the weight with a worried look on her face. Flash to white. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Fourteen gram ... wait a minute. You're telling me that she weighed her bowels?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah. We bagged it.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Input and output down to the last quarter gram.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, that makes sense why the blood and skin under Ashleigh James's fingernails is a perfect match to Ashleigh James.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: She attacked herself. </p>
<p>(Quick Flashback back to the teaser -- to ASHLEIGH JAMES sitting in front of her vanity mirror as in the teaser. Her hair is up. She's wrapped in a towel. She reaches for her cosmetics kit. The reflection in the side mirror shows a reflection of ASHLEIGH JAMES' face mutilated. Flash to white. Blood drips into the sink. Flash to white. Side camera view of ASHLEIGH picking and digging at her own face. Flash to white.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) I mean, Ashleigh was convinced that everything about her needed to be fixed. The real problem was inside her head. She couldn't deal with that so she tried to fix the outside. Hence, the digging and picking and purging and bleeding.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present. Camera on GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: To us, it would be torture. To her ... some sort of release.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Which is why Rod cut her loose. She was no longer &quot;bankable&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Also why Frank was so angry at Rod.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, he destroyed Frank's vision of her.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So the victim and the killer became one and the same. The very nature of addiction -- whether it be self-medicating herself or self-mutilating -- is that the very behavior we use to survive it becomes a behavior that ends up killing us.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: But wait, that still doesn't answer how Ashleigh ended up in a shopping cart by the freeway.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, the fingerprints explain that.</p>
<p>(Quick Flashback to ASHLEIGH JAMES struggling out of the bathroom. She falls against the wall leaving a bloodied handprint behind. Flash to white. She barely makes it over to her bed where she collapses on it in a heap. Flash to white. CASSIE appearing in the doorway and finding her sister on the bed. Flash to white. CASSIE shutting the faucet off. Flash to white. CASSIE crying over her sister and dragging her off the bed. Flash to white. End of flashback. Resume to present on GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I think Cassie was trying to take care of her sister. She pushed her to a place where she thought she'd be safe. Where she thought she could see herself for how beautiful she really was. </p>
<p>(Quick Flashback to ASHLEIGH JAMES in the shopping cart. CASSIE is pushing her to the bridge. The billboard can be seen in the distance. Flash to white. CASSIE kisses her sister's hair and cries. Flash to white. CASSIE walking away, leaving her sister in the cart below the billboard. Flash to white. End of flashback.)</p>
<p>(Resume to present. Camera on pictures of CASSIE JAMES' mug shot on the right and ASHLEIGH JAMES' magazine cover on the left. WARRICK is looking at the photographs he's holding. He asks the final, lingering unanswered question: ...)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What happened to these girls?</p>

<p>(CASSIE is back out on the street. GRISSOM is with her carrying her shopping cart to the sidewalk. He puts it down as CASSIE starts rummaging through the sidewalk garbage bins.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm sorry about your sister, Cassie.</p>
<p><strong>Cassie James</strong>: The dead don't bleed.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: True. Death does have some advantages. Would you like me to help you get in a shelter?</p>
<p><strong>Cassie James</strong>: No, I would need a shelter from a shelter. No, no, no. Out here, I can hunt and I can range and I can find the things that I need out here. I mean, you never know what you need until you find it.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Or until you lose it.</p>
<p><strong>Cassie James</strong>: I mean, all we are is what we try to get rid of. Fat and newspapers and loneliness and cat food cans. And there are going-away people and there are left-behind people but, you know, everybody's secrets ... everybody's secrets are the same.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Were your and your sister's secrets the same?</p>
<p><strong>Cassie James</strong>: My sister didn't have secrets. Her secrets had her. That... I told you I didn't ... I don't know. I mean, you know, y-y-you-you can pick through a million lives and never have one of your own.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Looking for things, analyzing them ... trying to figure out the world -- that's a life.</p>
<p><strong>Cassie James</strong>: You never know what you need until you find it. And the next thing I find it might be the thing that changes everything.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What will you do when you find it?</p>
<p><strong>Cassie James</strong>: Sleep ... the most perfect sleep.</p>

<p>(The camera follows GRISSOM as he walks along the sidewalk. The usual noise of the bustling city is gradually reduced to general muffled sounds and the occasional clear, identifiable sound.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM stops to look at the water fountain and we can hear the sounds of the water fountain as he stops to look at it. Even that sound is muffled and unclear.)</p>
<p>(He moves to cross the street and is startled by the sound of a car screeching to a halt when it's nearly upon him. Only then does he stop. Something's terribly wrong.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM continues across the street and stops when he gets to the other side. We still can't hear anything other than muffled unrecognizable sounds. GRISSOM stands there and looks out at the silent world in front of him.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom (v.o.)</strong>: Obviously most of crime scene investigation is about seeing. But much of it is about hearing as well. Listening. Knowing how to listen. Not just to what people are saying but how they say it ... how their tone of voice matches their facial expressions or body posture. So, even if I read lips and know what they're saying ... it's not enough.</p>

[INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE]</p>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong>: We're both scientists, Mr. Grissom, so let me tell you the science. You've got otosclerosis. Basically, this means a bony growth has begun to form around the base of the stapes. What this does is prevent the stapes from moving and passing vibrations to the inner ear effectively neutralizing sound waves.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (nods) It's hereditary -- my mother.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong>: Most doctors think so. But there's no way to know when it's going to show up and there's no way to reverse it once it does.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Right. How long do you think?</p>

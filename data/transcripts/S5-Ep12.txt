<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>CUE MUSIC: SPANISH MUSIC</p>
<p>[EXT. STREET - DAY]</p>
<p>(From the POV of a car driving by, we pass two kids walking along the sidewalk.)</p>
<p>RESUME VIEW</p>
<p>(A boy sits in the back of a truck with his sandy-colored dog. The boy knocks on the glass and motions for the people in the cab to raise the volume for the music on the radio. The driver increases the volume to the kid's satisfaction. He nods his approval and goes back to petting his dog.) </p>
<p>(They continue passing by the town's shops and the people out for a morning walk.) </p>
<p>(The truck continues to move down the road. The driver slows the truck down and pulls over curbside. The kid in the back of the truck jumps out and grabs a stack of papers from the back.)</p>
<p>(The current paper is an issue of HOY with the headline, &quot;Carreras Mortales&quot;.)</p>
<p>(The boy opens the paper dispenser and puts in the paper.)</p>
<p>(Various cuts of: People standing in front of a shop and a shop owner pulling in a display.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: The truck pulls up curbside. The boy jumps out of the back of the truck and grabs a stack of papers. He puts the papers on top of the dispenser and takes out a coin. He puts the coin in the dispenser and opens the door.)</p>
<p>(Inside is a severed head, bald and bloodied.)</p>
<p>(The kid gasps.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. CURBSIDE - STREET - DAY]</p>
<p>(Catherine works at unscrewing the base of the paper dispenser with an electric power tool.)</p>
<p>(Nick snaps photos of the other paper dispensers.) </p>
<p>(A crowd has gathered right outside of the crime scene tape. They line the streets watching them work.) </p>
<p>(Det. Sam Vega talks with the people watching.)</p>
<p>Catherine finishes and the dispenser is raised off the sidewalk.) </p>
<p>(The coroners carry the dispenser away.)</p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO: </p>
<p>[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY - DAY]</p>
<p>(Doc Robbins carries the severed head and places it in a pan.)</p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH:</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - LAB - DAY]</p>
<p>(Dissolve to: Nick puts on a pair of latex gloves. Behind them in the lab is the paper dispenser. Camera pushes in on the blood spatter on the top-most paper, right under the headline: Carreras Mortales.) </p>
<p>(Camera flashes of: Doc Robbins works on the head. He injects a syringe into the head.)</p>
<p>(Back in the lab, Nick removes the stack of papers in the dispenser.) </p>
<p>(Catherine holds the camera and watches Doc Robbins take a swab of the head's nose. She snaps a photo.)</p>
<p>(Nick removes a wrapper from the dispenser. He drops a couple of coins on the lab table next to him.)</p>
<p>(Catherine continues to snap photos as Dr. Robbins works. He opens the head's mouth and looks inside.)</p>
<p>(With his forceps, he pulls out a long, thin, dead snake.)</p>
<p>(Catherine's jaw drops at the sight.)</p>
<p>(Dr. Robbins turns and looks at Catherine.) </p>
<p>(Camera lingers on the dead snake.)</p>
<p>FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Robbins goes over the head with Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Female, early 30s, Hispanic descent, vitreous potassium was 11.74 milli-equivalents per liter, so PMI's approximately six hours.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So time of death roughly 1:00 A.M. </p>
<p>(Robbins nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: C.O.D.?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: From what I got here, I can't tell you much. Minimal dilation in the pupils indicates decapitation was postmortem. (He points to the scalp.) Scalp shows naked follicles without hairs, no inflammation around them indicates removal was postmortem as well.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Ripped out in chunks.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: Hair being ripped out from the scalp. End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Takes time and dedication to do something like that.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And a lot of hatred. So her eyebrows have been shaved off and drawn back on with eyeliner. I know that's popular among Latinos in 28th Street. She could be a banger or a girlfriend of one.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Well, either way, at least she took good care of her teeth.</p>
<p>(Robbins hands her the victim's bridgework. On the inside is a set of numbers:<br />
942774274.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What is that, nine digits? Social Security number.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Dentists usually put on some form of identification on removable bridgework. It's better than a license plate.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - LAB -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Nick is working on the top-most newspaper. He's dusting for prints. He finds a couple of prints. He uses both his hands and motions as if placing the head in the middle of the paper. The sides of his hands are touching the paper.) </p>
<p>(Quick flash of: The killer puts the head down on the paper, the sides of his hands touching the paper. End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY - DAY]</p>
<p>(Nick and Catherine walk down the hallway as Nick reports to Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Pulled a couple of likely palm prints on the newspaper the head was on, but I don't think that's going to be our best bet.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay, start with those, but make sure you run the partials off the box as well 'cause I got Ecklie looking over my shoulder, so, uh ... </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Cover your ass.</p>
<p>(Nick heads off in another direction.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: My pleasure.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. - DAY]</p>
<p>(Jesse Menken examines the snake while Nick watches.)</p>
<p><strong>Jesse Menken</strong>: Large, elevated vertebral scales. Definitely not your typical U.S. Crotalus. </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Herpetologists always throwing the Latin around. What's wrong with just calling him &quot;rattlesnake&quot;?</p>
<p><strong>Jesse Menken</strong>: My specialty, my jargon. Stripes at the base of the neck makes it crotalus simus, indigenous to southern coastal Mexico.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Apparent Mexican vic on a Mexican newspaper with a Mexican snake. You don't find a whole lot of these buzz-worms around Vegas anyway, do you?</p>
<p><strong>Jesse Menken</strong>: Nowhere outside a zoo. These snakes like to burrow in damp soil. They like it hot and humid. We're hot and dry. For a snake, big difference.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What are the chances that thing just crawled in their on its own?</p>
<p><strong>Jesse Menken</strong>: (scoffs) In a newspaper dispenser in the middle of a desert city? No way. I think it was dead when it was shoved down the victim's throat.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[EXT. ROOFTOP PARKING LOT -- NIGHT ] </p>
<p>(Warrick walks toward the crime scene.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The only car up here. Security called it in.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Is that a handicap van?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Dead guy's in the driver's seat.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Any witnesses?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Nope. And no surveillance either. We ain't on the strip, baby. Five hundred bucks and a Nevada license. Vincent Decarlo, 28.</p>
<p>(Warrick takes the bag with the ID information inside from Brass. He puts his kit down near the open front passenger door.)</p>
<p>(Inside, David Phillips takes down the body stats.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It's an expensive-looking Italian suit just to be a chauffeur.</p>
<p>(Warrick checks the back of the van.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It's a wheelchair. Any indication he's handicapped?</p>
<p>(David Phillips looks.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: He's not wearing prosthetics and his soles are worn.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Somebody's missing their wheels.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Gunshot wound to the head. Looks like it came through the windshield.</p>
<p>(They both turn and look at the hole in the windshield. Outside, Sofia appears on the hood and examines the hole in the windshield.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Crater on the windshield faces out. Which means that the shot came from inside the van.</p>
<p>(She looks at the gun hole and notices that it lines up with the wheelchair in the back of the van.)</p>
<p>(Sofia visualizes what happened.) </p>
<p>CGI VIEW</p>
<p>(Backward motion. The hole in the windshield slowly fixes itself.)</p>
<p>(A gun fires.)</p>
<p>(The virtual bullet breaks through camera frame and heads for the windshield.)</p>
<p>(Close-up: From the outside of thewindshield, the bullet bursts through the glass.)</p>
<p>(End of CGI slow motion. Resume to present.) </p>
<p>(Warrick looks at Sofia, surprised to see her there.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Swing's tapped out. Catherine asked if I could lend a hand.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>(Sofia walks around to the back of the van.) </p>
<p>(Warrick notices a spot of blood on the victim's lapel.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You see that blood spot on the lapel? It's inconsistent with the head wound. To avoid cross-contamination, you think you could cut that out for me?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Oh, sure.</p>
<p>(Sofia climbs in to the back of the van and looks at the dead body from behind.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Possible GSR.</p>
<p>(Quick close-up to: The GSR on the back of the chair.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Which means the shot was fired from the wheelchair.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: How'd he shoot him in the face?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Hey, Vinnie.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: Vincent Decarlo turns around to look behind. End of flash.)</p>
<p>(Sofia holds out her index finger as if holding a gun pointed at the driver. She mimics shooting the gun at the driver.)</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: Vincent Decarlo is shot and the bullet exits out the front windshield.) </p>
<p>(End of flashes. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So we got a guy who fired a shot from a wheelchair and then escaped on foot.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. NEW YORK CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) -- NIGHT</p>
<p>[INT. JUAREZ RESIDENCE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Det. Sam Vega shows Nick and Catherine into the apartment.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Sam Vega</strong>: Social came back on the dental work of Veronica Juarez. No immediate family in the states. Apartment's leased in her name.</p>
<p>(He picks up a framed photo off the nearby shelf.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, that's why bangers have girlfriends; sign things they can't.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: This is a pretty nice place. A long way from 28th Street.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Sure is.</p>
<p>(Catherine picks up a framed photo of two women. Sam Vega finds something.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Sam Vega</strong>: Catherine, Nick.</p>
<p>(Nick and Catherine walk over to him. He points to the degree hanging on the wall from the University of Texas El Paso to Veronica Juarez in Bachelor of Science - Communication.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Gangbanger girlfriend with a degree?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Sounds like a rock band.</p>
<p>(They continue to look around. Catherine uses the ALS on the bedspread. Nick picks up a digital camera off the desk and looks at the photos.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, Vega? Check out these pics.</p>
<p>(Det. Sam Vega walks over to Nick.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Think she liked to party?</p>
<p><strong>Det. Sam Vega</strong>: That barely looks like the same girl.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Sam Vega</strong>: I'm going to check out the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(Vega walks away.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, there's no signs of sexual activity.</p>
<p>(Catherine opens the bedside table drawer. She finds something.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, hang on now.</p>
<p>(She takes out a small plastic bag with something inside.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: That looks like pure crystal meth.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You could be up for a week straight on that stuff and not even know it.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Perfect drug for this town.</p>
<p>(Sam Vega walks out of the kitchen holding a piece of paper.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Sam Vega</strong>: Hey, you think that our vic was a groupie?</p>
<p>(He shows the Extremo poster to them.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Looks like a mariachi band with artillery. </p>
<p><strong>Det. Sam Vega</strong>: I had a big dose of them when I worked with a gang unit in LA.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The band?</p>
<p><strong>Det. Sam Vega</strong>: The scumbags who listen to that music. Sinaloa cowboys. Big drug producers.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay. We've got a female victim with a degree, Mexican artwork, drugs and Sinaloan cowboys.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. CLUB - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Det. Sam Vega and Nick exit the parked car and head for the club.)</p>
<p>[INT. CLUB - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The place is crowded. The band on stage sings.)</p>
<p><strong>Lyric</strong>: no me puedes negar, lo que te hago sentir no me puedes negar lo que sientes por mi </p>
<p>(The song ends; the crowd applauds.)</p>
<p>(The club owner shouts to the already hyped-up crowd.) </p>
<p><strong>Club Owner</strong>: (shouts) Que paso, que paso,que paso?! Hacienda corona! Como estan, como estan, como estan, como estan todos? Que bueno, que bueno, que bueno! Otra cancion! Otra cancion!</p>
<p>(The band sings another song.) </p>
<p><strong>Lyric</strong>: Yo me paso las noches tomando quierendo olvidar su recuerdo buena aquella noche maldita ... </p>
<p>(Det. Sam Vega and Nick walk into the club and head over to the bar. Vega shows him Veronica Juarez' DMV photo.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Sam Vega</strong>: Carnal, conoces esta muchacha? Sordo, contestame!</p>
<p><strong>Juanito Concha (barback)</strong>: That's Carla.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Carla? Not Veronica?</p>
<p><strong>Juanito Concha (barback)</strong>: Nah. The girl in the picture there told me her name was Carla.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Sam Vega</strong>: Yeah, well, the bouncer says that she hangs out here a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Juanito Concha (barback)</strong>: Yeah, I guess so. Yeah.</p>
<p>(Nick turns and listens to Extremo on stage.) </p>
<p><strong>Lyric</strong>: ...Que por ser poderoso que mi vida jamas pasaria </p>
<p>(He turns back to the bartender.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: She, uh, friends with the band?</p>
<p><strong>Juanito Concha (barback)</strong>: I don't know about friends. I mean, her and every other girl in here jocks 'em. I mean, Extremo, bro, they're the best. Come on.</p>
<p>(Vega and Nick listen to Extremo.) </p>
<p><strong>Lyric</strong>: Yo soy malo<br />
y no puedo negar<br />
que desde me acuerdo<br />
no he sido<br />
la vieja resulto<br />
mentirosa... </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I know my Spanish is a little rusty, but I think he just said, &quot;She was a liar, she wasn't who she said she was.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Lyric</strong>: ... Pero en cambio le robe su vida </p>
<p><strong>Det. Sam Vega</strong>: &quot;She stole my heart, so I stole her life.&quot;</p>

<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>

<p>(Extremo steps off the stage.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CLUB - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Nick and Vega wait to talk with the lead singer. As the band files out the stage and through the hallway, fan girls crowd the doorway shouting for them.) </p>
<p>(Vega stops the lead singer.)</p>
<p><strong>Det Sam Vega</strong>: LVPD. We need to talk.</p>
<p><strong>Rafael Salinas (lead singer)</strong>: Leave your card, I'll send you a picture and autograph, huh?</p>
<p>(He slaps Nick on his arm, then turns to continue down the hallway. Nick chuckles following him.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: That's not really what I'm after, my man.</p>
<p>(The manager stops Nick from following Rafael Salinas, the lead singer, into the back room with the rest of the band.) </p>
<p><strong>Manager</strong>: Whoa, whoa, whoa.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>Manager</strong>: I'm their manager. El Jefe. You want to ask my band questions, you can ask me first.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Great. What can you tell us about the song they just played?</p>
<p><strong>Manager</strong>: What do you want to know?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Quite frankly, the lyrics are very similar to a homicide we're investigating.</p>
<p><strong>Manager</strong>: That narco-corrido was written ten years ago. It's a classic. (to Vega) Surprised you haven't heard it.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Sam Vega</strong>: I don't listen to crap about doing drugs and killing cops.</p>
<p>(Someone comes up to the manager and says something to him. The man leaves. The manager turns to Nick and Vega.) </p>
<p><strong>Manager</strong>: Why don't you buy a CD on the way out. All right?</p>
<p>(The manager tries to leave. Nick stops him.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, I might do that. Listen, one more thing, if you could. (Nick shows him the photo.) This girl, you know who she is?</p>
<p><strong>Manager</strong>: That's Carla. She's dead?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Manager</strong>: That's too bad.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah.</p>

<p>(Sara walks up to Grissom's office and knocks on the door.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (smiles) Hi.</p>
<p>(She steps inside. Grissom looks up and takes his glasses off.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You got a minute?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We really haven't had a chance to talk since the staff changes. (She sits down.) I, uh ... I wanted to let you know that I said some things to Ecklie that might have done the team a disservice.</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p>(The worker turns around. Nick recognizes him.)</p>

<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO: </p>
<p>(The lead singer talks with Catherine. Nick looks around his locker.) </p>
<p><strong>Rafael Salinas (lead singer)</strong>: I was seeing Carla ... until Veronica Juarez's article came out. I figured out who she was.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And then?</p>
<p><strong>Rafael Salinas (lead singer)</strong>: Then I dumped her ass. What do you think? She put down my music, my band, made it look like everyone involved in narco corridos was a drug dealer or a criminal. She lied to me.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The Extremo lead singer, Rafael Salinas, is angry with Veronica Juarez.) </p>
<p><strong>Rafael Salinas (lead singer)</strong>: Asi es como pagas?</p>
<p>(He shouts angrily at her.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Rafael Salinas (lead singer)</strong>: Narcocorridos are entertainment. The drugs, they're an economic activity woven in the fabric of Sinaloan history. The music does nothing more than reflect that.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Narcocorridos also depicts actual events.</p>
<p><strong>Rafael Salinas (lead singer)</strong>: So does the 6:00 news. A lot of people were pissed off when she wrote that trash.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So you're saying that she deserved to die?</p>
<p><strong>Rafael Salinas (lead singer)</strong>: I'm saying she was a two-faced bitch who got off on our music at night, wrote about how disgusting we were during the day, when she was the one smoking, snorting, screwing everything she could find.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: After her tox screen, we know that Miss Juarez didn't do drugs. And ... I seriously doubt that she was having s*x with you.</p>
<p><strong>Rafael Salinas (lead singer)</strong>: Listen ... I didn't kill Veronica. But she was a pocha, a traitor, and people like that aren't taken lightly in Sinaloa.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We're not in Sinaloa.</p>
<p><strong>Rafael Salinas (lead singer)</strong>: When you're inside la hacienda corona, you might as well be.</p>

[INT. CSI - BREAK ROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Warrick is sitting at the table. Sofia walks into the room.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: I identified the casings recovered at the scene. They don't match Dax Blanchard's 9-mil. So, did he have any other firearms?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Nothing registered.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Well, head stamp on the casings was a little unusual.</p>
<p>(She shows the photos to Warrick.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: &quot;DWM?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Deutsche waffen und munitions fabrik.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, that's World War II-era German.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Well, it's one thing to collect old guns; old ammunition comes from a trophy -- an enemy gun a soldier brings back from battle.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So, our shooter's an old soldier.</p>
<p>(She gives him a look.) </p>

<p>(Stuart Manslow talks with Warrick.) </p>
<p><strong>Stuart Manslow</strong>: Bonnie had Alzheimer's, you know. And that son of a monster sold her twice a day. Once in the morning, and again that night, because ... he knew she had forgot that she bought the first time. I tried to talk her out of it, but Vincent just kept on calling. And Bonnie just kept on a-buying.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So, what did you do about it, sir?</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Manslow</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What'd you do about it?</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Manslow</strong>: Vincent started calling all of us. I played along. I told him I didn't have a checking account, so the b*st*rd offered to drive me to the bank. I wanted him to think that I was weak. So I borrowed Bonnie's wheelchair. He drove me to the bank. Pushed me right up to the teller. Oh, he was helpful. And then he drove me back to the casino.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Why did you have him park on the roof?</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Manslow</strong>: Why not? Nobody parks on the roof.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [VAN - NIGHT]</p>

<p>(Warrick stops walking toward him, his eyes on the gun in Stuart's hand. Unsure of what Stuart is going to do, Warrick becomes very cautious.) </p>
<p><strong>Stuart Manslow</strong>: You know, the world has changed. (Warrick swallows, his eyes on the gun.) When I was serving my country, I knew who my enemy was.</p>
<p>(Stuart shakes the gun in his hand.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: The gun, please, sir.</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Manslow</strong>: Now the enemy is ... some punk ... calls you up on the telephone ... and wants your credit card number.</p>
<p>(Stuart looks at the gun.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Sir? The gun.</p>
<p>(Stuart sighs.) </p>

							<p>There's a concrete bridge built in 1938.</p>
<p>25 feet from there... look west.</p>
<p>That's where you'll find Joel.</p>
<p>His directions to the crime scene were very precise.</p>
<p>We found the bones of a male body buried in three feet of dirt.</p>
<p>The hyoid bone was broken, which indicates death by strangulation, so... pending DNA, we're tentatively ID'ing him as JoeSteiner, the first victim of Nate Haskell, the Dick and Jane killer.</p>
<p>We found another male d.b.in close proximity.</p>
<p>We estimate he's been dead no longer than 24 hours.</p>
<p>His name is Jeffrey Masters.</p>
<p>He was strangled like the others.</p>
<p>He has a wife-- Maureen.</p>
<p>She's not at home, she's not answering her cell.</p>
<p>According to friends, the two of them were out clubbing last night.</p>
<p>We have a broadcast out.</p>
<p>But you're not 100% certain she's actually missing.</p>
<p>How are you so sure they're victims of this Dick and Jane killer?</p>
<p>Well, Sheriff, we believe the killer is actually one of his accomplices.</p>
<p>DJK's signature is post-mortem stab wounds to the male.</p>
<p>They're his version of notches on a gun.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Masters was stabbed ten times.</p>
<p>He and his wife would be the tenth couple taken overall.</p>
<p>The M.O.of the killer is, he usually targets a couple-- a male and female.</p>
<p>He strangles the male, then dumps the body; Takes the female, holds her hostage, tortures her; eventually, he kills her, too.</p>
<p>How much time do we have?</p>
<p>It's hard to say.</p>
<p>We placed CSI Grissom undercover in a college seminar in which Haskell was being interviewed.</p>
<p>Haskell implied that he kept one of his female vics alive for three days.</p>
<p>The general rule of thumb is, we probably have less than 48 hours.</p>
<p>This is quite the PR crapper you've dumped me in.</p>
<p>LVPD and the Crime Lab run some kind of a sting operation in a class about serial killers, and the serial killer uses it to reach out from behind bars and kill again?</p>
<p>Want to know how you can make it up to me?</p>
<p>Find the girl.</p>
<p>CSI Season09</p>
<p>Episode10 One to Go A new body at the site of his first kill can't be a coincidence.</p>
<p>I think that Nathan Haskell somehow got a message to someone.</p>
<p>No, , I agree-- I spoke to the warden at Ely.</p>
<p>The only communication Haskell's had with the outside world in the last 48 hours was the phone call to Langston, and that seminar you were in.</p>
<p>Also, Sheriff Buick wants to start a task force about this, and he's asked me to ask you to stay on-- so I'm asking.</p>
<p>Okay, I have an answer.</p>
<p>I'll keep you informed.</p>
<p>Tell us your definition of fun.</p>
<p>Fun is taking something away from somebody.</p>
<p>Oh, you never forget your first.</p>
<p>Welcome back to Question the Answer!</p>
<p>Dana's our current leader and passed Joel.</p>
<p>Okay, it looks like you've been the jumper today, jumping all over the board.</p>
<p>What's your category, Dana?</p>
<p>How about happiness for $800?</p>
<p>And happiness for $800 it is.</p>
<p>Okay, &quot;In the central nervous system, this plays an important role&quot; in modulation of happiness.&quot;</p>
<p>Can you... Question the Answer?</p>
<p>What is the thalamus?</p>
<p>I'm sorry, that's wrong.</p>
<p>Serotonin is the chemical that produces happiness in a person.</p>
<p>Serontonin is released, happiness is the result.</p>
<p>Yes, it is.</p>
<p>Yes, sir. Absolutely.</p>
<p>Okay. I will.</p>
<p>Okay. Come in.</p>
<p>I need a favor.</p>
<p>It's something you're going to have to clear with the sheriff.</p>
<p>What, do you have bugs in my office?</p>
<p>No. I have bugs in my office.</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>What are we talking about?</p>
<p>Sheriff Burdick is reorganizing the department.</p>
<p>From now on, the crime lab will report directly to him.</p>
<p>He just made me the new undersheriff.</p>
<p>Congratulations, conrade.</p>
<p>And I have a great idea for your first official act.</p>
<p>Dr.Langston, I was just going to call you.</p>
<p>I'll, uh, save you the trouble.</p>
<p>Come on in.</p>
<p>What's on your mind?</p>
<p>When I was doing my background research on Haskell, I found something very interesting.</p>
<p>Now, as you pointed out in class, he's 5'10&quot;, 160 pounds.</p>
<p>Most of his male victims were over 200 pounds.</p>
<p>One was a football player, uh, one was a black belt, but none of them had defensive wounds and none of them were bound.</p>
<p>Now, most people respond to being strangled by fighting back.</p>
<p>Unless they're already unconscious.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>My feeling is that DJK subdued them first, and I doubt it was using some kind of stranglehold, that would've left bruises.</p>
<p>Well, all the male vics had THC in their system.</p>
<p>But even the most potent cannabis would not completely incapacitate an able-bodied male.</p>
<p>So, maybe DJK was using something stronger.</p>
<p>Something mixed in with the dope.</p>
<p>GHB, Diphenhydramine, Salvinorin-A, Fentanyl...</p>
<p>Any of these in the proper dosage would render a subject incapable of fighting back.</p>
<p>I thought if you could I.D.it, it might be helpful.</p>
<p>I realize that this might be a long shot, but I--</p>
<p>No, no, no.We'll try.</p>
<p>I'll take this to Tox.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Dr. Grissom...</p>
<p>I don't like feeling like an accomplice to murder.</p>
<p>You told me you'd keep me in the loop on this.</p>
<p>I intend to hold you to that.</p>
<p>You don't have to.</p>
<p>I've arranged with the lab to retain your services as a special consultant.</p>
<p>I mean, we need all the good brains we can find. What do you think?</p>
<p>Oh, I'm in.</p>
<p>I have a theory of my own.</p>
<p>Tell me.</p>
<p>I think that Haskell's accomplice was someone from your class.</p>
<p>Whose idea was it to talk to Haskell?</p>
<p>Uh, one of my students from last semester...</p>
<p>Dan Forester.</p>
<p>Okay, so how does a clean-cut, good-natured PhD student like yourself end up writing letters to a serial killer in jail?</p>
<p>Well, maximum security felons aren't allowed unsolicited phone calls.</p>
<p>You look like a smart kid. Don't be a smart-ass.</p>
<p>Well, I was tired of secondary sources.</p>
<p>I mean, there's only so much you can learn about the emotional dynamics of psychopaths from books and psychologists, retired police officers reliving their past glories.</p>
<p>I wanted first-hand material, and that's what I told Professor Langston.</p>
<p>He thought it was an outstanding idea.</p>
<p>Is that true?</p>
<p>Unfortunately, yes.</p>
<p>Why'd you pick Haskell?</p>
<p>Well, he was the only one with a response.</p>
<p>We sent letters to about half a dozen.</p>
<p>You recognize these people?</p>
<p>Uh, no.</p>
<p>How about these people?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Okay, how about now?</p>
<p>Nate Haskell somehow managed to kill at least three people from inside his cell.</p>
<p>That means he has an accomplice on the outside.</p>
<p>Me?</p>
<p>You can't possibly believe that I had anything to do with this.</p>
<p>I'm not a suspect, am I?</p>
<p>Well, it was your &quot;outstanding idea.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, I may have misrepresented that slightly.</p>
<p>Now, I don't know whose idea it was first, but we were all having coffee after class last term, and several of us drafted that letter.</p>
<p>I suppose, yeah, I may have been the one that personally took it to Professor Langston, but he redrafted it and sent it to Haskell.</p>
<p>Who were the other students? I need their names.</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>You don't know.</p>
<p>Sincerely, I don't remember. I...</p>
<p>Are these people really dead?</p>
<p>Courtesy of your pen-pal.</p>
<p>So, what do we do next? Do we interview everyone that was in the class?</p>
<p>Well, even if we can find them all, there must be 50 students.</p>
<p>I don't think Maureen Masters has that kind of time.</p>
<p>We have to figure out who Haskell was communicating with.</p>
<p>Maybe we can see for ourselves.</p>
<p>Ever have the feeling you were being watched?</p>
<p>Even in a crowded room, someone making eye contact with you, just for a second, triggers a powerful response.</p>
<p>It's the brain filtering through a mass of visual information, telling you what's important.</p>
<p>Yeah... like which predator wants to eat you.</p>
<p>If Haskell was communicating with someone in this class, I'm betting that they made eye contact with each other.</p>
<p>More than once.</p>
<p>Are we going to try to match eyelines with the students?</p>
<p>The University wouldn't allow the students' side to be recorded for liability and security reasons.</p>
<p>Okay-- there.</p>
<p>We thought he said this to Mrs. Steiner.</p>
<p>He's clearly talking to his accomplice.</p>
<p>Joel was the first.</p>
<p>Joel lives in the perfect place, the place where it all began.</p>
<p>If I could get out of here, believe me, I would bring him some company.</p>
<p>Pretty clear now what Haskell meant by that.</p>
<p>I'll loop it.</p>
<p>Joel was the first.</p>
<p>Joel lives in the perfect place, the place where it all began.</p>
<p>Andi I could get out of here, believe me, I would bring him some company.</p>
<p>If I could get out of here, believe me, I would bring him some company.</p>
<p>Mrs. Steiner was standing right there.</p>
<p>It's hard to tell who he's really talking to.</p>
<p>Nything else he say stand out?</p>
<p>Yes, um...</p>
<p>Try two-and-half minutes in.</p>
<p>Someone asked how he selected his victims.</p>
<p>Did you ever buy a car?</p>
<p>You go down to the showroom, you're pretty sure you're going to get one, but why the red one, why not the blue one?</p>
<p>Nobody knows, but justne of them speaks to you.</p>
<p>That's the one you gotta have.</p>
<p>Nobody knows, but just one of them speaks to you.</p>
<p>That's the one you gotta have.</p>
<p>He's looking right here.</p>
<p>Dan Forester.</p>
<p>Brass already interviewed him.</p>
<p>We don't think he's our guy.</p>
<p>You know, if you're alrea a serial killer's accomplice, why take a class about serial killing?</p>
<p>Maybe because he screwed up with Ian and Justine.</p>
<p>Big time.</p>
<p>Did anyone ask Haskell for any pointers?</p>
<p>Try four hours, 23 minutes in.</p>
<p>Someone asked him how he was able to manage to control his victims.</p>
<p>You have to give them hope.</p>
<p>If you bring a human being to the brink of death, and then you offer a chance-- no matter how small a chance-- to survive... they'll grab it.</p>
<p>And they'll thank you for it.</p>
<p>And then you can do whatever you want.</p>
<p>And believe me...</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>Thomas Donover.</p>
<p>Let's see if we can find Thomas.</p>
<p>Hallie Donover?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Where's your husband? - He ain't in there.</p>
<p>He-He... He's gone... He's gone camping.</p>
<p>Where?</p>
<p>Um, Mount Charleston.</p>
<p>He goes to Red Rock Canyon, different places, I don't know.</p>
<p>All clear.</p>
<p>What's going on?</p>
<p>Where's your husband work?</p>
<p>Right now, kind of nowhere.</p>
<p>No, sir, but he's in construction.</p>
<p>You know, these day's the city's pretty dead.</p>
<p>But he's going back to school.</p>
<p>Yeah, we know that.</p>
<p>So you have absolutely no idea where your husband is?</p>
<p>No, sir.</p>
<p>Tom goes camping a lot, and he doesn't always tell me where he's going.</p>
<p>I don't ask, so...</p>
<p>You always keep tabs on your wife?</p>
<p>Yeah. That's why I'm divorced.</p>
<p>Everybody take a room.</p>
<p>We're looking for anything that tells us where Tom Donover could be.</p>
<p>Shoe tread's a match to Tolliver's house and Justine in the desert.</p>
<p>This is definitely our guy.</p>
<p>His browser history is clean.</p>
<p>The laptop is filled with encrypted files.</p>
<p>I'm going to get it back to the lab.</p>
<p>But this guy knows how to cover his tracks.</p>
<p>Do you have your cell phone on you?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Let's get it on; let's call your husband up.</p>
<p>We need to talk to him.</p>
<p>Yeah, you're welcome to try it, if you like.</p>
<p>Tom turns his cell phone off when he's camping.</p>
<p>He likes his alone time, so...</p>
<p>You have to give them hope.</p>
<p>If you bring a human being to the brink of death, and then you offer a chance-- no matter how small a chance-- to survive, they'll grab it.</p>
<p>And they'll thank you for it.</p>
<p>And then you can do whatever you want.</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>Just don't kill me.</p>
<p>I'm going to give you a little rest.</p>
<p>No, don't!</p>
<p>You can relax. You act like I'm going to turn you into the Joker or something.</p>
<p>The only way through that door is to break it down.</p>
<p>I've locked us both in here on purpose.</p>
<p>There are a few windows around.</p>
<p>You could probably try those, but that would be dangerous, because I would shoot you in the back of the head.</p>
<p>I'm sorry.</p>
<p>It won't happen again.</p>
<p>The only way out of here alone is dead.</p>
<p>The only way out of here alive is with me.</p>
<p>Now, if you behave, do what I say, and you make me happy... you'll get out of here just fine.</p>
<p>I'll make you happy.</p>
<p>I'll do whatever it takes.</p>
<p>Good.</p>
<p>Now, when we do leave, I can't be seen with you looking like this.</p>
<p>You need to make yourself presentable.</p>
<p>Well, this sure feels familiar.</p>
<p>You, me, a serial killer...</p>

<p><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div></p>
<p>Who's he?</p>
<p>Dr. Ray Langston.</p>
<p>He's an expert on the Dick and Jane killer and he's a consultant on the case.</p>
<p>We usually don't need a consultant.</p>
<p>When the team gets a case like this, we go into hyperdrive.</p>
<p>It's why we get up in the morning.</p>
<p>I can't imagine my life without it.</p>
<p>And you are?</p>
<p>David Hodges. Trace.</p>
<p>Pleasure to meet you.</p>
<p>Likewise.</p>
<p>So the red flags are the original DJK body dumps?</p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p>The green ones are Tom Donovers?</p>
<p>That's correct.</p>
<p>What are the white flags?</p>
<p>The last places the victims are seen alive.</p>
<p>They were all abducted in Arizona, Nevada and California.</p>
<p>But the male bodies were all found here in Nevada You know, Joel Steiner was last seen at the Desert Rose Arena.</p>
<p>His body was found 40 miles away just off the 215.</p>
<p>Couple number two was last seen in Bullhead, Arizona.</p>
<p>And the male body was found just off the 93.</p>
<p>He dumped the male bodies like... like they were trash, like he wasn't really interested in them.</p>
<p>Maybe he dumped them where it was convenient-- on the road to somewhere else.</p>
<p>Lake Mead?</p>
<p>The only problem is Lake Mead has 550 miles of shoreline.</p>
<p>I can cut that in half.</p>
<p>Greg found didymodon nevadensis on the bottom of Tom Donover's sneaker.</p>
<p>That moss only grows on the north side of Lake Mead.</p>
<p>This is what we live for.</p>
<p>Hey, I was checking the attic.</p>
<p>A lot of dust-- but a box was recently disturbed with a bunch of VHS tapes in it.</p>
<p>DVD player, stacks of DVDs.</p>
<p>No VCR.</p>
<p>I'm listening.</p>
<p>Well, Gerald Tolliver had a VCR at his house, but no tapes.</p>
<p>And we know he took souvenirs.</p>
<p>I found concert ticket stubs from the summer of '97.</p>
<p>This tape was made about the same time.</p>
<p>I want to get this back to the lab.</p>
<p>You look exhausted-- why don't you let me take care of that.</p>
<p>No, no, no. I'm fine.</p>
<p>I'll push through it.</p>
<p>It's just...</p>
<p>It feels like Grissom's last big game, you know.</p>
<p>I want to win it for him.</p>
<p>Recognize this guy? How about him?</p>
<p>That's uh... that's Gerry Tolliver.</p>
<p>He's an old friend of Tom's from Reno, I think.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Kind of friend always putting the arm on you for money when you're doing okay, you know?</p>
<p>He's a sleazy guy.</p>
<p>No, what he is, is he's dead.</p>
<p>He's dead; so's that guy-- they're both dead.</p>
<p>So's this guy and this guy-- and all these ys here. They're all dead.</p>
<p>See, your husbans a murderer. Where is he?</p>
<p>Do yourself a favor, tell me-- where is he?</p>
<p>But he made me promise not to tell.</p>
<p><em>********</em></p>
<p>Tox.</p>
<p>Hey, Henry, it's Catherine.</p>
<p>Grissom said that you were testing tissue samples from the DJK victims for the presence of some incapacitating agent?</p>
<p>Yes. Actually I just finished.</p>
<p>Dr. Langston was right.</p>
<p>They all showed high levels of...</p>
<p>Salvinia divinorum?</p>
<p>Usually Grissom does that.</p>
<p>Are you bucking for a promotion?</p>
<p>Yes or no, Henry.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>It's an intense hallucinogenic.</p>
<p>It'll knock you on your ass for 15 to 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Mandy, it's Catherine.</p>
<p>The print I just sent through, it's priority one.</p>
<p>We're looking for anyone who might lead us to Tom Donover.</p>
<p>If you get a hit, get it to Brass ASAP.</p>
<p>2-0-3-Charlie, this is 3-David-34 coming up on a pedestrian fitting your description.</p>
<p>3-David-34, that's him on the left.</p>
<p>Let's grab him. Let's grab him.</p>
<p>Control, this is 3-David-34 in foot pursuit of one male Caucasian, east on Fremont.</p>
<p>Requesting backup.</p>
<p>Oh, man.</p>
<p>It appears that the drug dealer was pretty heavy into his own inventory.</p>
<p>His tox was positive for THC and opiates.</p>
<p>Fresh red around the needle marks, and they were oozing when he was brought in.</p>
<p>This guy shot up less than 24 hours ago.</p>
<p>Did you check his urine?</p>
<p>Yes. Urine-heroin levels were 3,000 nanograms per milliliter.</p>
<p>The half-life of heroin in the system is 24 hours.</p>
<p>So, when Jeffrey Masters was murdered, and Maureen was kidnapped, he had to have at least twice that amount in him.</p>
<p>He wouldn't have been able to stand up, let alone help.</p>
<p>Which makes him another dead end.</p>
<p>Guys. You gotta see this.</p>
<p>Oh, my God! That was awesome!</p>
<p>I cannot believe you got those tickets, baby!</p>
<p>Thank you, thank you, for our almost-getting- married present.</p>
<p>Got this video from Tom Donover's attic.</p>
<p>That's Joel Steiner and his fiance Tiffany Cohen, DJK's first victims.</p>
<p>11 years ago. The night they disappeared.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>That's Tom Donover... and Gerald Tolliver.</p>
<p>Honey, I got something that'll keep the party going over here.</p>
<p>And the &quot;something&quot; is probably a joint laced with salvia.</p>
<p>Yeah. Gerald likes souvenirs.</p>
<p>I'm guessing that Tom probably grabbed this videotape after he killed him.</p>
<p>Could be why he killed him.</p>
<p>Keep watching.</p>
<p>I'll do whatever you say.</p>
<p>I know you will.</p>
<p>That's Nate Haskell.</p>
<p>That's all there is.</p>
<p>We got a better view of the house?</p>
<p>We know that Tom was continuing in DJK's work.</p>
<p>It would make sense that he would carry it out in the same place.</p>
<p>Certain places hold a special power for some people-- Stonehenge, the pyramids-- that house could have the same kind of power for Tom.</p>
<p>Could be his sacred ground.</p>
<p>His wife said that he went camping a lot.</p>
<p>Bet that's his favorite spot.</p>
<p>That's as good as it gets.</p>
<p>We checked Nate Haskell and Tom Donover for property titles.</p>
<p>Neither one of them owns anything in Lake Mead.</p>
<p>Maybe the house belonged to one of their relatives.</p>
<p>Well, that could take you forever to run that down.</p>
<p>Have Archie pull stills of the house.</p>
<p>Get them to every local unit in the area; have them check with real estate offices; see if anybody can recognize it.</p>
<p>Recognize what? A house with a window in it?</p>
<p>Maureen Masters is running out of time, and the only person who can get us to where she is is Nate Haskell.</p>
<p>This is the most fun Haskell's had in a decade.</p>
<p>He's not going to help us. It's a waste of time.</p>
<p>What we're doing now is a waste of time.</p>
<p>'cause when I took those women, they stopped being somebody's sister or daughter or fiance.</p>
<p>They became what I wanted them to be.</p>
<p>I don't want to die.</p>
<p>It could just be our little secret, and I won't say anything, I promise.</p>
<p>Don't do this!</p>
<p>Oh, God... no!</p>
<p>It's a shame to hide that face behind this hair.</p>
<p>I don't like it.</p>
<p>What is that?</p>
<p>What are you doing?</p>
<p>I'm going to finish your haircut.</p>
<p>Marco...</p>
<p>Marco...</p>
<p>You're supposed to say &quot;Polo.&quot;</p>
<p>Strange time to be stargazing, don't you think?</p>
<p>Ansel Adams often forgot when he took his photographs, so a bunch of astronomers tried to figure it out using the image itself.</p>
<p>By referencing the moon's position in relationship to known landmarks and lunar azimuth tables, they were able to determine the date and time the photo was taken.</p>
<p>I thought we could reverse the science.</p>
<p>We know when this was made.</p>
<p>Maybe the moon can tell us where.</p>
<p>Forensic astronomy?</p>
<p>I will never forget the things you've taught me.</p>
<p>You're the best student I ever had, Nick.</p>
<p>Let's see if we can figure this out.</p>
<p>Professor Langston, how good to see you.</p>
<p>What brings you here?</p>
<p>I came... to gloat.</p>
<p>Please. Come in, Nate.</p>
<p>We got these from a videotape of one of your kills.</p>
<p>It's hard to believe, isn't it?</p>
<p>Now, in all fairness, you did say that only dummies take souvenirs, and Gerald Tolliver was a pretty dumb guy.</p>
<p>Maybe that's why Tom Donover killed him.</p>
<p>I've been thinking that maybe that's the reason Tom Donover decided to follow in your footsteps, and carry on with the work.</p>
<p>Anyway, none of that really matters now, because, s you can see, we found your house in Lake Mead, and... we have Tom. and the girl. She's alive.</p>
<p>Then what do you need me for?</p>
<p>Closure.</p>
<p>You once told me that you'd been thinking about it a lot.</p>
<p>Well, I've been thinking about it, too.</p>
<p>I need you to tell us where the girls' bodies are buried, Nate.</p>
<p>Us? So you're working with that cop now?</p>
<p>We're gonna find them eventually. You know that.</p>
<p>We'll dig, we'll dredge the lake, we'll tear that house of yours down to the studs, if we have to.</p>
<p>Now why don't you save us the trouble?</p>
<p>Tell me what I need to know.</p>
<p>Look, maybe I can get something out of it for you.</p>
<p>Like what, you're gonna reduce two consecutive life terms down to one?</p>
<p>Like, maybe I can guarantee that this isn't the last conversation you'll have with someone who isn't shoving your food through a hole in the door.</p>
<p>I promise you, Nate, you don't tell me what I need to know... the only person who will hear the sound of your voice ever again... is going to be you.</p>
<p>You follow the fence in the backyard.</p>
<p>To where?</p>
<p>To where, what?</p>
<p>There is no fence in the backyard.</p>
<p>You thought you could make me slip up and give you something you want.</p>
<p>You thought you could get inside my head.</p>
<p>Get him out of here.</p>
<p>A person has to do what I've done to understand me.</p>
<p>You have no idea what I've started.</p>
<p>I'm a teacher, too, and my students are everywhere.</p>
<p>They're out there, and I've cut them free.</p>
<p>Get him out of here.</p>
<p>They're spreading the word.</p>
<p>By the time you find them, it' be too late, because they'll just pour blood on your hands.</p>
<p>She's already dead.</p>
<p>Get him out of here!</p>
<p>She's already dead.</p>
<p>That's it.</p>
<p>All right, I can sharpen that up.</p>
<p>Gris, I just, uh, want you to know how much I appreciate you putting me out in the field.</p>
<p>I'm sure there were times you wish I probably didn't.</p>
<p>Well... you changed my life.</p>
<p>Got the moonrise tables foLake Mead.</p>
<p>It's not gonna get much better than this.</p>
<p>So the moon is waning gibbous.</p>
<p>On June 15, 1997, the moon rose at 7:46 p. m.</p>
<p>This video was recorded at 10:41 p. m.</p>
<p>That's two hours and 55 minutes after moonrise.</p>
<p>That puts it about 45 degrees above the eastern horizon.</p>
<p>So that view is west to east.</p>
<p>You know, those peaks look like they're roughly the same height.</p>
<p>I've got the topo map.</p>
<p>Look for two peaks that are approximately the same elevation with that geographic relationship.</p>
<p>Arch Mountain, 3, 335 feet, and Hamblin Mountain, 3, 310.</p>
<p>Fits the bill.</p>
<p>The moss on Tom Donover's shoes can only be found on the north side of the lake.</p>
<p>So... draw a vector from the center of those two peaks to the north shore.</p>
<p>Black Mesa.</p>
<p>If you let me go right now, I won't tell anybodwhat happened.</p>
<p>You can't! I did everything that you asked!</p>
<p>Sorry, I lied.</p>
<p>Don't move! Don't move! Guns down!</p>
<p>Okay, you're okay. You're all right, Maureen. You okay? There we go.</p>
<p>It's okay, it's okay. It's okay, Maureen. Okay, look at me.</p>
<p>This is Sniper One. I saw pink mist. Do you copy?</p>
<p>This is Brass. Suspect is down. Code four.</p>
<p>Copy that. We're comin' in.</p>
<p>A penny for your thoughts?</p>
<p>He was sitting right there.</p>
<p>He was looking at me; I was looking at him.</p>
<p>All I saw was... another student.</p>
<p>That's all I saw.</p>
<p>I guess I'm tired of getting fooled.</p>
<p>People lie, Professor.</p>
<p>The only thing we can count on is the evidence.</p>
<p>Thank you for letting me help.</p>
<p>It was something I... well, it was something I really needed to do.</p>
<p>I don't know if you'd have any interest... but we have a job position open at our lab.</p>
<p>You're serious?</p>
<p>I can't imagine myself as a cop.</p>
<p>We're not cops.</p>
<p>We come from a wide variety of backgrounds.</p>
<p>You're a medical doctor; you're totally qualified.</p>
<p>It's an entry-level position.</p>
<p>The hours are terrible, the pay's bad...</p>
<p>But money's not exactly the object, is it?</p>
<p>I think you'd be a great help to CSI.</p>
<p>And you might really enjoy it.</p>
<p>I'll think on it.</p>
<p>Okay. So this is really real.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>Then, as your friend and colleague, I feel it is my obligation to inform you what a colossal mistake you're making.</p>
<p>Hodges... Guys like us don't just get to hang it up.</p>
<p>This job is who we are.</p>
<p>We are the thin blue line between order and chaos.</p>
<p>You take yourself out of the equatio who knows what's gonna happen?</p>
<p>That's the Butterfly Effect.</p>
<p>You taught me that.</p>
<p>The bad guys will win more if we don't have you.</p>
<p>Who is Watson without Sherlock Holmes?</p>
<p>Watson was a genius in his own right.</p>
<p>It's the right time for me to go.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>

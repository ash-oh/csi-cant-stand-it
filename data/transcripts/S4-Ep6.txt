<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(A box is on the autopsy table. It's addressed to:<br />
DR. ROBBINS<br />
3026 WESTFALL AVENUE<br />
LAS VEGAS, NV 89109</p>
<p>(ROBBINS cuts the string and cuts the box open. Inside is a large blue plastic tub. ROBBINS takes the tub out and pushes the empty box to the side as he concentrates on the blue tub. He cuts the tape around the cover of the tub and opens the lid. Inside is a head.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p>(ROBBINS puts his glasses on to examine the head. GRISSOM walks into the room and appears at his side.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I heard you got some head.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Just came in. How'd you know?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I arranged house seats for David to see Celine, so he pages me the minute you get anything perishable.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Sellout.</p>
<p>(ROBBINS reaches into the tub and removes the head. GRISSOM takes a deep breath.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Oh ... formaldehyde.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Yeah, it fixes tissue, but it destroys DNA.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No ID through CODIS. Quite a bit of leaf litter. </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Puncture wound above the orbital plate.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That looks like animal activity. </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Heavy decomp. It's going to be, uh ... virtually impossible to determine time of death. This neck wasn't severed. It was disarticulated. No skill involved.</p>
<p>(ROBBINS puts the head down on the table and turns it to the left. On the left cheek, there's a knife cut.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Oh-oh. I take that back. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That took skill.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV: Camera zooms into the cut - past the skin, into the muscle and flesh. End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(ROBBINS turns to look at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The unkindest cut of all.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (nods) Hmm.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(DAVID HODGES removes the leaf litter from the head while ROBBINS works on washing the head.) </p>
<p><strong>David Hodges</strong>: There's more plant material here than geological. </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Hair roots and scalp are relatively clean.</p>
<p><strong>David Hodges</strong>: So the vic wasn't buried?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: You tell me.</p>
<p><strong>David Hodges</strong>: I will. Leaves and needles and dirt -- that's good as a map.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks into the room and up to the table. She frowns when she sees HODGES and ROBBINS working on the head.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Any idea when Grissom'll be back?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Nope. It's going to be a while.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE glances down at the paper work in her hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Jackpot, Nevada. Where the hell is that?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. MOUNTAIN LANDSCAPE (STOCK) - DUSK]</p>
<p>[EXT. TOP VIEW: ROADWAY (STOCK) - DUSK]</p>
<p>[EXT. LAKE (STOCK) - DUSK]</p>
<p>[EXT. TOP VIEW: VARIOUS ROADWAY (STOCK) - EARLY MORNING]</p>
<p>[EXT. MOUNTAIN LANDSCAPE (STOCK) - MORNING]</p>
<p>[EXT. TOP VIEW: ROADWAY (STOCK) - DUSK]</p>
<p>[EXT. JACKPOT -- GAS STATION -- DAY] </p>
<p>(The sign says: PAY AT THE PUMP. GRISSOM'S car travels up the road, past the gas station, and parks next to the Sheriff's car in the diner parking lot.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. JACKPOT -- DINER - DAY]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks into the diner.)</p>
<p><strong>Cook</strong>: Order's up, sweetie.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM closes the door behind him. There's quite a lot of activity in the full diner. He takes off his glasses and heads for the waitress behind the counter.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Good morning. I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab, and I ...</p>
<p><strong>Gloria</strong>: (interrupts) Hey, Alan! 'S guy's here about the head.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks around. The Sheriff's sitting at the table and waves him over. As he heads in that direction, it appears that everyone in the diner already knows about the head.)</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: Bet a wolf got him.</p>
<p><strong>Man 2</strong>: There's no wolves around here dumbass. Bears.</p>
<p><strong>Man 3</strong>: Ten bucks says satanic cult.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM approaches the Sheriff's table.)</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: Lieutenant Alan Brooks. This is my brother Leland.</p>
<p><strong>Leland Brooks</strong>: How do you do?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Gil Grissom, Las Vegas Crime Lab. May I?</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: Have a seat. Things must be pretty slow in Vegas to get one of you guys out here so quick.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, the Elko County Sheriff made the request. We were happy to respond. It's an interesting case.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: Mmm, not particularly.</p>
<p><strong>Leland Brooks</strong>: It was probably some hiker or transient who got lost, took a bad luck fall.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Must have been a heck of a fall. His head's in a plastic jar.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: Listen, I filed the report. I sent in the head. Five'll get you ten, there's not much left of that body out there but coyote turds.</p>
<p>(LELAND chuckles.)</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: Look, nobody from this community's been reported missing. And I just don't have the resources to go searching for what might be left.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, you do now.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: There'd better be a whole lot more of you out there.</p>
<p>(MARTY COOPERMAN gets up and heads for the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: Have a good one, Marty.</p>
<p>(MARTY COOPERMAN leaves without saying a word.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Lieutenant, the preliminary autopsy revealed a single, straight, two-inch cut on the victim's jaw. It was a blade mark. So, there's not just a body out there, there's also a killer.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - TRACE LAB]</p>
<p>[SCOPE VIEW]</p>
<p>(DAVID HODGES explains what CATHERINE'S looking at in the scope.) </p>
<p><strong>David Hodges</strong>: Of all the plant life gathered from the head, the conifers are the key. The one on the left -- abies zasiocarpa. The one on the right is picea engelmannii, engelmann spruce.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Spruce and fir trees. Typical mountain forest.</p>
<p><strong>David Hodges</strong>: Typical for 9,000 feet above sea level. The wood fragments are either cottonwood or aspen. And aspens only grow in areas that have been cleared.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Fire, roads or ... logging.</p>
<p><strong>David Hodges</strong>: After a major forest fire, manzanita bushes grow like weeds for decades.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No manzanita leaves here.</p>
<p><strong>David Hodges</strong>: Which means that the head was on a damp north-facing slope, at least 9,000 feet up, cleared, but not recently exposed to fire.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. JACKPOT - OUTSIDE DINER -- DAY]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and ALAN BROOKS leave the diner. GRISSOM'S phone rings. He answers it.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to phone) Grissom.</p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH:</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - HALLWAY ON THE WAY TO GRISSOM'S OFFICE]</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Is the service actually bad out there or are you just keeping your phone off?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm sorry. I should've called. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: This trip wouldn't have anything to do with you ducking case reviews, now would it?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How can you think that? You wouldn't mind taking care of those for me, would you?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, your job, my pay. Why would I care?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'll make it up to you.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, you had better. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE reaches GRISSOM'S office and her jaw drops at the stacks of files on his desk that he needs to review. The desk is a mess.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hodges ID'd your leaf litter.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Good. Thanks. I owe you one.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM hangs up.) </p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: Trouble with the wife?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah. She hates it when we're apart.</p>
<p>(He shrugs.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAKE (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[EXT. SYLVIA ROGERS RESIDENCE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(GRISSOM interviews SYLVIA ROGERS while ALAN BROOKS watches.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So your dog found the head?</p>
<p><strong>Sylvia Rogers</strong>: Well, Tripper's not exactly a Chihuahua. Goes where he wants, comes back for dinner. Sometimes he brings dinner back.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: SYLVIA ROGERS walks out of the house with a dish of food for the dog.)</p>
<p><strong>Sylvia Rogers</strong>: Tripper! Come on, buddy, dinner.</p>
<p>(She puts the dish down. The dog barks and she looks. She sees he's playing with the head.)</p>
<p><strong>Sylvia Rogers</strong>: Oh, what is it this time, a rabbit or a possum?</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Is he okay?</p>
<p><strong>Sylvia Rogers</strong>: Well, he got a little lethargic after chewing on that he took him to the vet, ran some tests. He got better. I just want to keep him that way. Where there's a head there's got to be hands and feet, and sooner or later, he'll dig 'em up.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: Or what's left of 'em. No offense, Sylvia, but he's not exactly a scent hound.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: All animals can smell rotting flesh. Studies have shown that when domestic pets bring back human body parts, usually the remains are within a half-mile radius.</p>
<p><strong>Sylvia Rogers</strong>: They do studies on that?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It occurs more than you think. Have you noticed any buzzards or vultures around?</p>
<p><strong>Sylvia Rogers</strong>: All the time.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>(She leaves. GRISSOM turns and looks at the hillside.)</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: So, are we done here?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This slope faces north, doesn't it?</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You know that old expression, &quot;heads will roll&quot;? It's true -- especially downhill.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM heads for the north slope.)</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: (to radio) Barry, drop the doughnut. You're gonna earn your pay today.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. NORTH SLOPE - DAY -SHORT TIME LATER]</p>
<p>(A couple of OFFICERS walk up the slope. GRISSOM and ALAN BROOKS follow them.)</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: Afraid you gonna trip over something?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm hoping. Bodies make good fertilizer. You often see fresh, green shoots near a gravesite.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: Must be nice to know the answer to every little thing.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I prefer questions actually.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: And I don't, I suppose. Remember that waitress, Doris? Well, she's got an ex-husband likes to smack her around every once in a while. High school's got a dozen meth-heads who like boosting motorcycles and then drag racing 'em down main street, when they think nobody's watching. Fire chief's a closet pyro, and so forth. See, I don't have a lot of time to ask questions about buzzards and such. </p>
<p>(He points to the tree GRISOSM'S looking at.) </p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: That's an aspen tree, in case you were wondering.</p>
<p>(Up on the hillside the OFFICERS call down to them.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Lieutenant! Over here.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[TOP OF THE HILL] </p>
<p>(GRISSOM reaches the top of the hill and sees the two OFFICERS standing just over the body. One of them is gagging.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Step away from there, would you please, fellas? Don't disturb the scene.</p>
<p>(They both rush aside as one of the OFFICERS throw up.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM kneels next to the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Carabid beetles. Second instar maggots. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM picks up a bug.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Formica obscuripes.</p>
<p>(Camera zooms in for a close up.)</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: Let me guess. You like bugs?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, I do. They're perfect. They always do their jobs. </p>
<p>(He glances at the Sheriff.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (declares) This body's been here four to seven days.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM stands up.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How deep would you say this hole is, Lieutenant?</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: I'd say about four feet, depending on ... how he's stuffed in there.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Takes a fair amount of dedication to dig a hole this deep up here, don't you think?</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: Unless the killer had help.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes a picture of the blood on the rock near the body, then kneels down to look at the spatter.)</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: It's like you said -- he was cut.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This blood's not from a cut. The drops imply directionality. The stellated circles imply ... </p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV of: The blood spatters on the rock.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) ... perpendicular impact. </p>
<p>(End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This spatter is in direct line with the victim's carotid. It's arterial spurt.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: Are you saying he was alive when he was buried?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I think that the cut we found on his jaw ... was a lure to draw predators.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The knife cuts into the victim's cheek as he screams. Cut to: Growling as the animal rushes forward. The victim screams. Cut to: Blood spattering on the rock.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and gets to his feet.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This wasn't just murder. It was torture.</p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. HILLSIDE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks out at the tree-covered mountainside, waiting. ALAN BROOKS gets impatient.) </p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: Hey, Einstein, we going to stand here all day or what?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You're going to have to be patient, Lieutenant. The scene hasn't been released yet. You know, this may be a variation on an old native American form of punishment. The body was bound and buried up to its neck. Tree sap was poured over the head to attract ants.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: Punishment for what?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You see? That's a good question.</p>
<p>(DALE STERLING appears on the hill, huffing and puffing with exertion.)</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: It's about time, Dale.</p>
<p>(DALE STERLING looks at the body in the ground.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You are the coroner, I presume.</p>
<p><strong>Dale Sterling</strong>: Mr. Grissom. Dr. Dale Sterling. I sent you the head. How can I help?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, we can't touch the body until you authorize it.</p>
<p><strong>Dale Sterling</strong>: Oh. </p>
<p>(DALE STERLING looks at ALAN BROOKS, then he looks over at the other OFFICER. They all look puzzled by this. Game, DALE STERLING looks down at the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Dale Sterling</strong>: He's dead. You're authorized.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: Thanks, Doc. That's nice work. Can we get it out now?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: There may be evidence in the gravesite. We need to preserve it.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: Okay, so what do you want to do, call your lab? Have them send the right gear, the right guys, what?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The site's already been compromised. We'll make do with what we have here. Now, for each foot of dirt that's removed, go on a separate bag. I'll sift through it later.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: All right. Out of the way, Doc. Pardon me.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hold on. Make sure your shovels don't get within six inches of that body.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: Can we please get on with getting him out of there? We're losing light.</p>
<p>(They start to dig the body out.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAKE - EVENING]</p>
<p>[INT. DALE STERLING'S OFFICE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(GRISSOM faces the wall with a degree on it from: THE UNIVERSITY OF VETERINARY STUDIES for DALE STERLING.) </p>
<p>(DALE STERLING takes off his jacket and sees GRISSOM looking at the wall.)</p>
<p><strong>Dale Sterling</strong>: I was in the 99th percentile on the MCATs. I could have gone to med school. I chose to be a vet.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, veterinary school's harder to get into than medical school. That's not what I was looking at. This is you and that gal from the diner.</p>
<p><strong>Dale Sterling</strong>: Doris. We were married. High school sweethearts. Didn't work out. </p>
<p>(The body is put on the examining table.)</p>
<p><strong>Dale Sterling</strong>: I know how to cut. I could ... I could do the autopsy right here. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Only a licensed pathologist can perform an autopsy. All we're allowed to do is search for evidence on the body.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: And then what?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Then we take it to Vegas. Tonight. We'll need someone to drive the body.</p>
<p>(BARRY is just about to sit down, when ALAN BROOKS looks at him.)</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: Barry, it's your lucky day. Get your car. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Our medical examiner will send you his report. You'll need to sign the death certificate as to cause and manner of death.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks around at the body. DALE reaches into the pants pocket.)</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No ligature marks.</p>
<p><strong>Dale Sterling</strong>: Well, he wasn't tied up?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Apparently not.</p>
<p><strong>Dale Sterling</strong>: Well, no one just lets themselves get buried alive.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, maybe the killer had a gun on him.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: Well, you can't dig a hole and hold a gun on an unbound victim all at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Dale Sterling</strong>: Well, maybe the hole was dug earlier?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That would imply premeditation.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: Or more than one killer.</p>
<p><strong>Dale Sterling</strong>: Maybe the victim was drugged.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sylvia Rogers' dog got sick after chewing on the victim's head, correct?</p>
<p><strong>Dale Sterling</strong>: That's right.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did you do blood work?</p>
<p><strong>Dale Sterling</strong>: I sent it off to a lab in Reno. Still waiting for the results.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Call the lab. Have them do a full drug and tox panel on the blood. </p>

<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: Why, is that French for 'evidence'? Straight drive, Barry. Stay out of the casinos.</p>
<p><strong>Barry</strong>: You got it, boss.</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: He's got you pushing his paperwork, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, no. I'm trying to avoid that. His headless D.B. had a Western LVU bookstore receipt in his pocket. Grissom just unraveled it.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Really?</p>
<p>(WARRICK walks into the office.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Wow! Some of these books are a hundred bucks a pop. Tuition, plus room and board -- that's at least another 10k.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You got to have money to go to college these days.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, well, I missed that boat. So, most of these are freshman textbooks. Core curriculum.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, that's at least two thousand students. Maybe you'll get lucky with the victim's prints.</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Gone almost a week. That normal?</p>
<p><strong>Eric Brooks</strong>: Yeah, he's an art student, you know. He goes off a lot, and for days sometimes.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Lieutenant?</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The victim was on his way out of town. We know he didn't get very far. So where's his vehicle?</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: (loudly to the diner crowd) Anybody here seen a black or blue mystery vehicle?</p>
<p><strong>Customers</strong>: No. CUSTOMERS: Uh-uh. CUSTOMERS: No.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: Well, I'd say that car's long gone by now.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: If the killer was a local, he could have ditched the car somewhere near here.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: Do you have a local suspect?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's a theory.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And like any theory, it doesn't mean anything unless you can prove it.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: Uh-huh. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I know you don't have any men to spare, so I called the highway patrol. They're sending troopers up there to secure the site.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: Oh, well, nearest station's in Elko. Should take 'em a couple hours to get here.</p>

Shame to see so much work go to waste.</p>
<p>(ALAN BROOKS steps back. GRISSOM walks out of the barn and pushes the door partially closed behind him.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What does that mean exactly?</p>
<p>(THE SHERIFF leans back against the fence, his hands on the rail.)</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: Well, unless you've managed to improvise yourself a warrant as well, this is an illegal search.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This barn had been broken into, which makes it a crime scene, even without the murder victim's car inside, so I don't need a warrant. Who owns this place?</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: Nobody. Owner died a few years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, then who's responsible for the property?</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: His nephew. Marty Cooperman. </p>

<p><strong>Marty Cooperman</strong>: Oh, I haven't been up there for years.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's understandable. It's hard to get to. Not too many gas stations around here. You must do pretty good business.</p>
<p><strong>Marty Cooperman</strong>: Yeah, I got the only pumps for 23 miles. I do pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You know, uh, the victim's car was full of gas. So you must've seen him, right, even though you said you didn't?</p>
<p>(MARTY turns around to look at GRISSOM.)</p>

As a matter of fact, back in high school he and Marty Cooperman played football together. One Friday night, after a couple of beers, Marty started busting on Leland. And Leland just busts him back. And I helped. And we fractured Marty's leg in three places.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So I should be grateful that you showed restraint with me.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: No, I didn't do it for you. A man shouldn't go through life ashamed of who he is.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks down at LELAND BROOKS' fingerprint card.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. CORRAL -- DAY] </p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks up to SAM BRAUN. He leans against the fence watching a horse being exercised. CATHERINE shows SAM the check.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: A way to get you to talk to me. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, I didn't come here to talk. I came to give it back.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: Not enough?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You're a murderer.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: Not in the eyes of the law. You look good, Mugs. How's Lindsey? She likes horses, right?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Lindsey's none of your business. You keep her out of this.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: I'm her grandfather.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, well, nothing I can do about that.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Bruan</strong>: Catherine, it's just a gift. You need the money.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And the next time you stab one of your showgirls and you need CSI to cover it, I'm supposed to help you out, right?</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: Take a good look at me. Plenty of fresh air, sun on my face. You think I need your help?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I don't need your Charity.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: You know what your problem is? You enjoy making life hard.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You're lucky Lindsey's too young to understand that.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: Cash it, or tear it up. Do whatever you want. I have one son in jail ... another in the ground. I never did right by your mother. But I'm damn sure going to try to do right by you.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - LOCKER ROOM] </p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks down at the check in her hand. She looks at it, then moves to tear it up, but pauses. She can't do it. She looks at the check again.) </p>
<p>(GREG appears in the doorway.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Hey, Catherine ...</p>
<p>(CATHERINE hides the check and turns around.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey. What's up?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: A possible inconsistency.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. OFFICE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at LELAND'S finger print card. DALE STERLING interrupts him.) </p>
<p><strong>Dale Sterling</strong>: Hey ... you have a phone call. Line two. I think it's your wife.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Thanks. (to phone) Hello, dear.</p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH:</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - GRISSOM'S OFFICE]</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The day Ross Jenson left Vegas, he used MapQuest to get directions from his dorm to jackpot.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, that makes sense. From what I've been able to gather, this was his first and only visit up here.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, that doesn't make sense. He was involved with someone in jackpot for several months. There were traces of aspen leaves in his dorm room closet. I just assumed he'd been there before.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, if I believe this was his first and only visit, how do we explain the leaves in his closet?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: He has a roommate.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Does the roommate have a name?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, his name is ... Eric Brooks.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (repeats out loud to DALE STERLING) Eric Brooks?</p>
<p><strong>Dale Sterling</strong>: Oh, yeah, that's Leland's boy. You guys going to tell him about his dad?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at DALE.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM] </p>
<p>(BRASS and CATHERINE interview ERIC BROOKS.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Did you know your father was having a sexual relationship with Ross Jenson?</p>
<p><strong>Eric Brooks</strong>: My dad's not gay.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Was Ross?</p>
<p><strong>Eric Brooks</strong>: We never talked about it.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Were you in Jackpot, Nevada last weekend?</p>
<p><strong>Eric Brooks</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Ross Jenson was ... visiting your dad. We found his car ditched in a barn outside town.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We got your fingerprints from a former ROTC commander of yours, and ... they matched a print that we recovered from the steering wheel.</p>
<p><strong>Eric Brooks</strong>: (shrugs and shakes his head) He let me borrow his car all the time. We were roommates.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: That's right. You don't own a car. You ride a motorcycle.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: View of the single tire tracks in LELAND BROOKS' driveway with sounds of a motorcycle in the background. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Eric Brooks</strong>: Yeah. So?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Could I see the bottom of your shoes, please?</p>
<p>(ERIC BROOKS puts his foot on the table for CATHERINE to look at. She compares the shoe with the print.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, that's an unusual wear pattern. Matches the shoe print we recovered from the barn near the vehicle.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Put a lot of miles on your bike. It shows.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The shoe on the motorcycle stirrup. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You were there.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: ERIC BROOKS arriving at home and findings his dad with ROSS JENSON.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) Eric must've known for a while. </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. JACKPOT - SHERIFF'S OFFICE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(GRISSOM and ALAN BROOKS talk with LELAND.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How did you intend to keep the relationship from your own son?</p>
<p><strong>Leland Brooks</strong>: I've been hiding it my whole life.</p>
<p>(LELAND looks at his brother, ALAN.)</p>
<p><strong>Leland Brooks</strong>: You knew.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: Yeah ... I figured you'd tell me when you were ready. I saw you with Ross. I stopped by here last weekend. You and he were taking a walk.</p>
<p><strong>Leland Brooks</strong>: I'm sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: You got nothing to be sorry about. Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Leland Brooks</strong>: Lee, it turns out Eric ...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mr. Brooks, your son killed Ross Jenson.</p>
<p><strong>Leland Brooks</strong>: That is t possible.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: According to the evidence, it is.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: ERIC BROOKS reaches into the car and takes out ROSS JENSON'S thermos.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) We tested the thermos and found traces of GHB.</p>
<p>(ERIC pours the drugs into the thermos.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH:</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIE ROOM]</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You used Ross' drugs to subdue him.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: It's a long drive from Jackpot to Vegas. You knew he'd stop for a refill before he left town.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: ROSS JENSON takes a drink from his cup. Cut to: ROSS JENSON starts to get woozy. He falls asleep and his car goes off the road.)</p>
<p>(ERIC finds ROSS out cold in the car.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Leland Brooks</strong>: (crying) Eric never could deal with the fact that his mother left. And, uh, she just wanted a husband. All I wanted was a family.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIE ROOM]</p>
<p><strong>Eric Brooks</strong>: People in town ... they said my dad was &quot;different.&quot; But he wasn't. He was just lonely. And Ross, like, totally used that to ruin him. It was all Ross.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: That why you drugged him? Drove him into the woods? Put him in a hole ... </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: ERIC walks ROSS to the hole.)</p>
<p><strong>Ross Jenson</strong>: Where are you taking me?</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: ... buried him up to his neck ... </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: ERIC starts to cover ROSS with dirt. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: ... cut him ...</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: ERIC takes out his knife and cuts ROSS on the cheek.)</p>
<p><strong>Ross Jenson</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p>(He screams.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Why didn't you go the distance? Why didn't you finish him off yourself?</p>
<p><strong>Eric Brooks</strong>: Because I wanted him to suffer.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Because he was in love with your father? Or because he wasn't in love with you?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAKE - DAY]</p>
<p>[EXT. GAS STATION -- DAY] </p>
<p>(MARTY finishes the repair on GRISSOM'S car window.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I don't suppose that comes with a warranty?</p>
<p><strong>Marty Cooperman</strong>: Nothing around here does, Mr. Grissom. Thanks for the business.</p>
<p>(ALAN BROOKS walks out of the building.)</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: Hey, Marty.</p>
<p>(MARTY doesn't say anything and heads back to the gas station.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Does he ever talk to you?</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: Not one word since high school. Listen, when we found that torso in the hole, on the crest of that hill ... I recognized the kid's shirt, and I knew he'd been with Leland, so ...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So you assumed your brother was capable of murder.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: Didn't even ask him what happened.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Questions, remember? Not asking them is what got everybody in trouble here in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Brooks</strong>: You don't keep any secrets, Mr. Grissom? Not even from your wife?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (amused) I used to. I'm trying to change.</p>
<p><strong>Brooks</strong>: It's a bitch. Have a good trip.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM gets into his car.)</p>
<p>(He glances in the back seat and finds his field kit. He looks at the SHERIFF standing outside. He smiles, then starts the car and leaves heading out of Jackpot.)</p>

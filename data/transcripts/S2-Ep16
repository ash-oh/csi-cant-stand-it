[INT. HOCKEY GAME - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(A hockey game is being played on the ice. A player gets smashed against the safety glass smearing blood on it. The crowd surges to its feet.)</p>
<p><strong>Terry</strong>: What are you waiting for? Call it!</p>
<p>(The REFEREE blows the whistle. The game is on hold as the player makes his way to the bench. The DOCTOR pushes his way to get to the player. He puts his bag down.)</p>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong>: Come on, come on. Coming through.</p>
<p>(The player steps off the ice.)</p>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong>: Sit down and let me have a look. Okay, you're out. DOCTOR: Myles will move in from the second line.</p>
<p><strong>Terry Rivers</strong>: Forget about Myles, I'm going back in. Stitch me.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong>: Terry, will you relax? It's a weekend league, it's not the NHL.</p>
<p><strong>Terry Rivers</strong>: It is to me.</p>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong>: You're not 100%.</p>
<p><strong>Terry Rivers</strong>: What are you, a doctor or a coach? Do me a favor, stitch.</p>
<p>(The game commences on the ice. The doctors stitches up the cut under TERRY'S left eye.</p>
<p><strong>Terry Rivers</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p>(The DOCTOR hands TERRY some pills and he swallows them. TERRY goes back out on the ice. The game continues.)</p>
<p>(TERRY gets control of the puck. He takes it to the goal. He hits the puck toward the goal, but doesn't stop. He slams into the Goalee and flies feet over head. He lands in front of the goal. The other players tackle him and pile up on him. It's a big mess in front of the goal.)</p>
<p>(The REFEREE blows the whistle stopping the game as the players get on their feet.)</p>
<p>(On the bottom of the stack, TERRY lies there unmoving. His eyes are open.)</p>
<p><strong>Referee</strong>: Hey Jack, get over here. He's hurt bad.</p>
<p>(The woman player takes off her helmet. The other player looks down at TERRY, not liking how he looks just lying there on the ice.)</p>
<p><strong>Player</strong>: (worried) Get the doc.</p>
<p>(Camera holds on TERRY RIVERS.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. HOCKEY RINK]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and CATHERINE walk out onto the ice. BRASS is already there in the center. GRISSOM looks around.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Where's the body?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: On the bench -- he was moved there after he collapsed in front of the net. Apparently, uh the guy was responsive enough to be helped off the ice. He died a few minutes later.</p>
<p>(BRASS, GRISSOM and CATHERINE cautiously walk toward the bench. BRASS removes the blanket covering the body on the bench. GRISSOM leans in to look at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (pointing) This looks fresh.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, according to the on-site doctor, he took on across the cheek earlier in the second period.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE points to the large gash in the side of the neck.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, I guess is must be from the third period. Looks like that other team worked him over pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hockey, rough game.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, it's murder.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO: END OF TEASER. ROLL TITLE CREDITS.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<hr />
[INT. HOCKEY RINK - STANDS -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and SARA sit side-by-side in the stands.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Two minutes for elbowing. Four minutes for high sticking. Ten minutes, unsportsman-like conduct.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Boys will be boys.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, sounds like these boys went to a fight and a hockey game broke out.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You just don't like sports.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's not true-- I've been a baseball fan my whole life.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Baseball. Well, that figures. All those stats.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's a beautiful game.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Since when are you interested in beauty?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (without looking up) Since I met you.</p>
<p>(Startled, SARA turns to look at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So, we'll start at the opposite goal work our way across the blue line to center ice.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM stands up and leaves.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. ICE RINK -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and SARA start to methodically walk the ice looking for evidence. They start at the far end of the ice.)</p>
<p>(Dissolve to: SARA and GRISSOM are at the middle of the ice ring.)</p>
<p>(Dissolve to: GRISSOM is up front. His kit is open and he puts his gloves on. SARA is in the middle of the rink and busy taking pictures.)</p>
<p>(Dissolve to: SARA is up front to the right of the rink. She's taking pictures of something on the ice. GRISSOM is in the middle to the left on his hands and knees looking at something.)</p>
<p>(Camera close up of a sliver of something off-white being picked up and put into a bindle.)</p>
<p>(Dissolve to: GRISSOM and SARA both on their feet and walking in opposite directions up and down the ice.)</p>
<p>(Dissolve to: GRISSOM on his hands and knees in the front left of the ice. SARA is on her feet in the middle right of the ice.)</p>
<p>(Dissolve to: SARA walks backward down the center of the ice. GRISSOM is way back on the left standing still.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: GRISSOM takes a swab sample of the blood on the safety glass. He caps the swab, turns and looks over at SARA. He walks over to her and kneels down looking at something on the ice. SARA puts something in a bindle.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes a sample of the blood on the ice.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It's not much to go on. Maybe we should be looking off the ice.</p>
<p>(And with that, an engine starts. SARA and GRISSOM turn their heads and see the zamboni machine enter the ice.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. LOCKER ROOM]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE talks with the </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, why did you move the body?</p>
<p><strong>Doc</strong>: You ever tried treating someone on the ice wearing just street shoes?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Then Mr. Rivers was still breathing?</p>
<p><strong>Doc</strong>: When I brought him back to the bench, yes. Then I performed CPR, and he didn't respond.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Did you also do the stitch work?</p>
<p><strong>Doc</strong>: I'm the on-site doctor for this facility. The stitches held, and I advised Terry not to go back on the ice.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, if he'd listened, he'd still be alive.</p>
<p>(The DOCTOR sighs. CATHERINE turns around and looks at all the players in their towels.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What do these guys play for? A little money? Imitation Stanley Cup?</p>
<p><strong>Tommy Sconzo</strong>: (quietly) We play for the pride of it.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE turns around to talk with the player dressing.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And the joy of kicking ass. You are...?</p>
<p><strong>Tommy Sconzo</strong>: Tommy Sconzo.</p>
<p>(TOMMY turns around.)</p>
<p><strong>Tommy Sconzo</strong>: Right wing, first line. Hitting's part of the game. Take away the physical aspect you've got figure skating. Guys out there doing triple lutzes.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Is that how you lost the, uh...? The sit spin? </p>
<p><strong>Tommy Sconzo</strong>: Second period, number nine. The guy's a real McCracken.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Which means?</p>
<p><strong>Tommy Sconzo</strong>: He gave me a high stick to the mouth. That's why my guys crashed the goalie. An eye for an eye, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: That why your guy ended up dead?</p>
<p>(The question unsettles TOMMY.)</p>
<p><strong>Tommy Sconzo</strong>: What can I tell you, lady? It all happened so fast, you know?</p>
<p>(He turns back to his locker.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Usually does.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. BACK ROOM]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and SARA walk the hallway. At the end, they come upon the zamboni.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: &quot;There are three things in life that people like to stare at. A rippling stream, a fire in a fireplace and a zamboni going round and round.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Charlie Brown. &quot;I love a zamboni.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We all do.</p>
<p>(Cut to: GRISSOM uses a mirror and looks under the machine at its tires.)</p>
<p>(SARA looks at the zamboni's engine.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM finds something. He picks it up.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The thing I love about zambonis is they pick up everything. Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm afraid the other part of this tooth might be in there.</p>
<p>(SARA turns to look at the large pile of ice against the wall.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Time to combine Foyeer's Law of Conduction with Newton's Law of Cooling.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Pile of ice measures nine feet by five feet ... by ... nine feet. Without the calculus, I'd estimate ... a hundred cubic feet. Current temperature, one degree celsius.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The heaters max out at 90 degrees, but the variables are constantly changing.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Let's ballpark it.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I don't know, 50-cubic-foot melt per hour, if we're lucky?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: 120 minutes for a tooth ... the whole tooth ... and nothing but the tooth.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />

[INT. HOTEL]</p>
<p>(NICK and WARRICK cross the lobby. They hear bells ring and an excited woman screaming at her win.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Whoo! There's a winner.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Easy come, easy go.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. HOTEL - LOUNGE]</p>
<p>(LILLIE IVERS sings.)</p>
<p><strong>Lyric</strong>: If I should die this very moment / I wouldn't fear / for I've never known completeness / like being here / wrapped in the warmth of you / loving every breath of you / still my heart this moment / oh, it might burst / could we stay right here / to the end of time / till the earth stops/turning? </p>
<p>(WARRICK and NICK enter the lounge. NICK meets up with LOCKWOOD.)</p>
<p><strong>Lockwood</strong>: Lockwood, Homicide. DFO's in the back.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Lead the way.</p>
<p>(NICK turns around to look at WARRICK who is simply mesmerized by the lounge singer. NICK leaves to follow LOCKWOOD. WARRICK remains behind and watches the lounge singer.)</p>
<p><strong>Lyric</strong>: ...Seas run dry / I've found the one / I have waited for / all this time ... </p>
<p>(WARRICK leaves the lounge.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. HOTEL - BACKROOM - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p><strong>Lockwood</strong>: Stan Grevey, 35. Backup sax player. One of the waitresses found him.</p>
<p>(NICK and WARRICK put their kits down and look at the scene.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Tiny scrubbing bubbles.</p>
<p>(Camera zooms in to show the white powder at the corner of the victim's mouth.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, after somebody wiped them down. Paramedics?</p>
<p><strong>Lockwood</strong>: Nope. Just pronounced, that's it.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Just pronounced? </p>
<p>(NICK reaches over and lifts the victim's lip up. There's something caught in between his teeth.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Had an interesting diet. Cowhide.</p>
<p>(WARRICK checks STAN GREVEY'S arm and finds needle marks.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: He tied himself off.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yup.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: All the signs of an O.D ... without any of the paraphernalia.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Your waitress say anything about a needle butane torch, that sort of thing?</p>
<p><strong>Lockwood</strong>: No, not a word just said he reminded her of Coltrane.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Coltrane, huh?</p>
<p>(WARRICK takes a sample of the powder on the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: See if I can get this back to Gregor at the lab. He could tell us what we're dealing with. Two coasters, one glass?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What do you think? Our guy having a little party with the waitress?</p>
<p><strong>Lockwood</strong>: She was just coming on shift. She came through me. Already cleared her.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, somebody was here ... grabbed the stuff took their glass. </p>
<p>(WARRICK takes the extra coaster. He looks over and also finds a soft contact lens on the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Forgot this on the way out.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Bet the contact wasn't his.</p>
<p>(LILLE IVERS walks into the back room checking up on her friend. She's smiling.)</p>
<p><strong>Lillie Ivers</strong>: Hey, how's he doing?</p>
<p>(WARRICK stands up and stops LILLIE IVERS from walking in further to the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Whoa, miss.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Whoa, whoa ... miss, you can't come in here.</p>
<p><strong>Lillie Ivers</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'm sorry, he's dead.</p>
<p><strong>Lillie Ivers</strong>: (surprised) He's dead? What are you talking about? They told me he wasn't feeling well. He was backing me up an hour ago. (shocked) What happened to him?!</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (quietly) Miss ... why don't we step outside for a minute?</p>
<p>(NICK watches as WARRICK leads LILLIE IVERS out of the room. LILLIE turns her head to look back at STAN GREVEY.)</p>

[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks into the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: What took you so long?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I was watching ice melt.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Tox screen came up empty except for quinine. Must have had malaria in the past six months. Either that or he's a big gin and tonic drinker. I've ordered up his medical records. If I was this guy I'd have been popping pain pills. Hairline fracture of the ulna bruised kidney, ten stitches off the orbital bone fractured nasal bone, all recent. Healed rib fractures. </p>
<p>(ROBBINS opens TERRY RIVERS' mouth.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: He should have worn a cage. </p>
<p>(Holds up the tooth. He puts it on the side.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: I bet he was proud of every last battle scar. What is it about organized sports?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, organized sports is the paradigmatic model of a just society. Everyone knows the same language everyone knows the rules. And there's a specific punishment handed out the moment someone tries to cheat. Instant morality.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: So, uh, what did this guy do in real life?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Stockbroker.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Competition junkie.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Aren't we all?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Not me, not anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No? How'd you get to be Chief Medical Examiner? Look, we're all carrying prehistoric genes in a postmodern world. We get our meat from the grocery store instead of with a club or a knife. We have to work off our, uh, testosterone somehow.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Foibles of youth.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah. So, cause of death?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Not sure. (ROBBINS sighs. He points to the cut in the neck.) This cut nicked his carotid. Double-edged, clean blade, hockey skate, uh ... </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to the hockey skate cutting the neck. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Fun continues. Basilar artery also suffered significant trauma. Evidence of blood in the intimal space. Possibly enough to cause syncope.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Loss of consciousness.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Well, it could explain why the vic ended up in the bottom of that pile.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So did his death cause his fall or did his fall cause his death?</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO BLACK.</p>

<p>(CATHERINE talks with BRASS. CATHERINE collects the team's gear.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What'd you get from area 51?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Terry Rivers was an instigator. Always stirring the pot.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Every fire needs a match. So, I guess this is their equipment?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, down to the last stick. Here's a copy of the team roster.</p>
<p>(BRASS hands CATHERINE the list.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay.</p>

<p>(CATHERINE looks at the list and calls out.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Ms. Gallagher?</p>
<p>(The woman near the motorcycle turns around.)</p>
<p><strong>Jane Gallagher</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Catherine Willows Crime Lab. I understand you play for area 51. Did you see much ice time during the game?</p>
<p><strong>Jane Gallagher</strong>: No, they just let me take off my cheerleader uniform and warm the bench.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You know what? Been there, done that. Just asking a question here.</p>
<p><strong>Jane Gallagher</strong>: I played 24 minutes, 12 seconds -- about my season average. I also lead the team in assists.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh ... you've got good peripheral vision. You see the ice really well.</p>
<p><strong>Jane Gallagher</strong>: I didn't see what happened to Terry.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You're a real teammate. Down the line, just one of the guys.</p>
<p><strong>Jane Gallagher</strong>: You're looking in the wrong direction. Now, we may have disliked Terry, but his own teammates ... hated him.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Any reason why?</p>
<p><strong>Jane Gallagher</strong>: How would I know? I'm just a girl. Can I go now?</p>
<p>(JANE GALLAGHER sits on the bike and puts on her helmet.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Nice bike.</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Potential killer?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Why don't you just catch us up there, boss?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: In a minute. First things first -- your contact lens was worn by a near-sighted person. And since I was born with perfect eyesight I'm experimenting with what it would feel like to be near-sighted.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Don't tell us you're wearing our evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Come on, Greg.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Give me some credit. Borrowing a pair of lenses from Archie in A/V. Giving me a headache, though.</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Mannitol-- that's that baby laxative used to cut heroin with.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: China white? You sure?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: The GSMS does not kid around.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: West coast heroin is MEXICAN BROWN. 20, 30% pure, tops. What's china white, 75%?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Uh, your sample's 91.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: 91%? No wonder the guy O.D.'D. That's a death sentence.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Doesn't make any sense, man. The money from dealing heroin comes from the cutting. The more you cut, the more money you make. There's no profit margin in selling stuff that's too pure.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, speaking on a meta-level ... isn't it obvious? The overbearing patriarchal structure of modern organised sports represents a socially palatable sublimation of what Jung refers to as the &quot;Shadow of the Unconscious.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: These blades skated through the blood pool.</p>
<p>(SARA continues to spray luminol on the skates. She finds something. She picks up the skate.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Blood spatter. Good guess -- this is the one that did the damage.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: You know, I had a roommate in college freshman year, from Edmonton, went on to play for the Swedish Elite league. Anyways, he set his blade at half an inch, tops. And I should know, because he made me get them sharpened.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: These blades are probably set at a quarter of an inch.</p>

<p><strong>Jane Gallagher</strong>: Okay, so I changed teams. Big deal. I wanted to win.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The fact that Terry Rivers churned and burned your brokerage account out of ten grand that didn't enter into it?</p>
<p><strong>Jane Gallagher</strong>: Terry was a stockbroker. He did really well for himself --<br />
Rolex, Beemer. He said he could do the same for me. I gave him some money. If I wasn't willing to take a risk I'd have put it in a bank.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You weren't the only one, were you?</p>
<p><strong>Jane Gallagher</strong>: No. All the guys had money with him. I mean, Terry was a salesman. You listened to him talk for five minutes and your hair was on fire.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Ms. Gallagher, your skate had a certain blood spatter on it. It indicates that you're the one that nicked Terry River's carotid artery.</p>

<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yep.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Little lie, big lie.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: There was blood in the sample. Not uncommon in early pregnancy. Women get mucosal tears in their esophagus because they yak so much. So, I tested the blood for the presence of human choriogonadotropins. She is definitely with child. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: She wasn't showing. She's skinny as a rail. But ... still, why lie about it?</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So we just double-checked the search warrant returned from Terry Rivers apartment. There was no quinine found in the location. He never had a prescription for quinine.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, according to Doc Robbins he never had malaria.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Do you have his medical file?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Let me see it.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Right here.</p>
<p>(SARA hands CATHERINE the file.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So Jane Gallagher is officially no longer a suspect.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Didn't have access to quinine let alone know it would kill him.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So who did know?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Terry was a roughneck. He dished it out so the other players dished it out harder.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Which they wouldn't have done if they had known about his heart. They would have played tentatively. Which in hockey is a sacrilege.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Someone besides Terry had to know.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE finds something.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Somebody did. You can withhold medical information from your friends all you want but it's still going to be in your hospital record.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Anyone with access to Terry's medical records knew how to kill him.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. OFFICE]</p>
<p>(BRASS, GRISSOM and SARA question the TEAM DOCTOR)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How many patients do you have with malaria?</p>
<p><strong>Team Doctor</strong>: I'm an orthopedist. None.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Not according to the pharmacy in your medical building. Last month you wrote a prescription for quinine -- an anti-malaria medication.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Malaria in Las Vegas. No wonder they were out of stock.</p>
<p><strong>Team Doctor</strong>: Look, a friend of mine was going to Africa. I did him a favor. That's it. Now, is there a crime in that?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well ... a man is dead.</p>
<p><strong>Team Doctor</strong>: It hurts getting stitched. It hurts even more when you get home. I always give the guys something for the pain.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So you're the go-to guy?</p>
<p><strong>Team Doctor</strong>: I am the on-site doctor for this facility. Nothing more and nothing less.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM picks up a framed photograph of the TEAM DOCTOR with JANE GALLAGHER.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Is this Umbria or Tuscany?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Italy. That's pretty serious.</p>
<p>(The TEAM DOCTOR stands up and takes the photo from GRISSOM. He doesn't say anything.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: But Jane's had a couple of boyfriends since that trip, right? </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: JANE kissing TERRY RIVERS in the locker room. The TEAM DOCTOR is in his office and he sees this. He seems upset by it. Cut to: JANE kissing TERRY RIVERS in the car and the TEAM DOCTOR walking outside and seeing JANE in the car with him. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Terry was an injury waiting to happen, wasn't he? And when it did, you were there on the bench with two little pills in your hand. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: TERRY RIVERS gets his cut stitched up. The TEAM DOCTOR reaches into his bag and pulls out the quinine. He gives TERRY RIVERS two pills. TERRY swallows them and heads back out on the ice. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Team Doctor</strong>: So what? So what if I gave him quinine?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: It's like giving a candy bar to a diabetic if you know he's a diabetic.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: And you knew, doctor. Terry Rivers had a heart condition.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: TERRY RIVERS in the hospital with the doctors working on him. The TEAM DOCTOR stands out in the hallway with JANE GALLAGHER.)</p>
<p><strong>Jane Gallagher</strong>: I need you.</p>
<p><strong>Team Doctor</strong>: Oh, yeah, since when? </p>
<p><strong>Jane Gallagher</strong>: Look, we tried it out, it didn't work. We're friends. I don't want the whole world to know that I've been with Terry. Please?</p>
<p>(JANE reaches up and kisses The TEAM DOCTOR. He agrees.)</p>
<p><strong>Team Doctor</strong>: Okay, okay. I'll stay with Terry.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You were always cleaning up her messes weren't you, Doctor?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Jane told us she paid you a visit a couple of days ago. She thought she had the flu ... but she didn't. She's pregnant. And with the father out of the way, you knew who she would turn to.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: But Tommy Sconzo is the father.</p>
<p>(The DOCTOR turns around to look at GRISSOM. This news surprises him. GRISSOM nods.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You killed the wrong guy.</p>
<p>(The DOCTOR hangs his head and takes a deep breath.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (o.s.) Let's take a little drive.</p>
<p>(The DOCTOR stands and leaves. BRASS follows him.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. BAR]</p>
<p>(NICK and WARRICK talk with the BARTENDER. The BARTENDER takes his contact off.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You're nearsighted? I bet this is going to match the contact lens we found at the crime scene. Let me ask you another question. Why deal 91% pure china white? Did you have a beef with the victim, or what?</p>
<p><strong>Bartender</strong>: I never met the guy.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You're going to have to do better than that. You intentionally sold him stuff that was too pure.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We know he's not the only guy you dealt it to.</p>
<p><strong>Bartender</strong>: Look, I didn't mean to harm anybody, all right? I didn't know what I was cutting. Probably got a bad batch.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Bad batch?</p>
<p>(LOCKWOOD puts the cuffs on the BARTENDER.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, do yourself a favor, slick. If you don't know enough about something, stay out of it.</p>
<p><strong>Lockwood</strong>: It's too late for that.</p>
<p>(LOCKWOOD takes the BARTENDER away. NICK and WARRICK remain behind. NICK looks at WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You want to talk about it?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'm going to meet Lillie. I'll see you back at the lab. Okay? You don't know me.</p>
<p>(WARRICK leaves. NICK watches him leave.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (quietly) Obviously.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. BALCONY -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(LILLIE leans on the balcony railing. She looks out into the night sky.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (o.s.) You hiding from me?</p>
<p>(LILLIE turns around and sees WARRICK walking toward her.)</p>
<p><strong>Lillie Ivers</strong>: Are you looking for me?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah. (LILLIE smiles at him.) I wanted to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>Lillie Ivers</strong>: Oh, yeah? About what? (WARRICK hesitates.) Come on, tell me. We're not strangers anymore, remember?</p>
<p>(LILLIE puts a hand on WARRICK'S cheek.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, you're right.</p>
<p>(WARRICK reaches out an cups LILLIE'S cheek. She leans into his hand and smiles.)</p>
<p><strong>Lillie Ivers</strong>: Warrick Brown. (WARRICK looks at LILLIE. He's not smiling anymore.) What?</p>
<p>(WARRICK reaches over and pushes LILLIE'S sleeve up. He sees the needle marks up her inner arm.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'm sorry, Lillie. Life's too short. Good-bye.</p>
<p>(WARRICK lets her go and he takes a step back. He turns around and walks away from her. WARRICK leaves LILLIE on the balcony.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. HOTEL CASINO LOBBY]</p>
<p>(WARRICK walks across the lobby. He looks at the gaming table. He sits down. He pulls out his wallet and slides a bill at the dealer.</p>
<p>(NICK takes the seat next to him.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I'm playing cards ... with my friend.</p>
<p>(WARRICK looks over at NICK.)</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>

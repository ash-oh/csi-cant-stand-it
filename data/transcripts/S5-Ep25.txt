<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>CUE MUSIC: (PRE-LAP)</p>
<p>[&quot;Lucky Too&quot;, Bob Neuwirth, from the album &quot;Look Up&quot;]</p>
<p>[INT. NICK'S CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(As Nick drives, he sings along enthusiastically with the music.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (singing)<br />
It was Christmas in Las Vegas / when the locals take the town<br />
Theresa hit a streak / and laid her waitress apron down </p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS STREET - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(TOP VIEW DOWN of the stretch of street that Nick is driving on.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (singing) she was playing penny poker </p>
<p>[INT. NICK'S CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(As Nick drives, he sings along with the music.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (singing)<br />
over at the old Gold Spike<br />
she's tired of Texas hold 'em<br />
so she switched to let it ride </p>
<p>(Outside view of Nick driving his car.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (singing)<br />
then over on Fremont Street<br />
six pits won her a car<br />
she rode it up the strip to where the flashy hotels are </p>
<p>(Nick's car moves out of camera frame.)</p>
<p>[EXT. TROPICANA HOTEL/CASINO (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[EXT. PARKING LOT (FLAMINGO AND KOVAL) - NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Nick pulls up into the empty parking lot.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (singing)<br />
at first, she hit a royal<br />
not a dirty one this time<br />
and then she drew four deuces ... </p>
<p>(Nick shuts off the car. The music shuts off. Nick gets out of his vehicle, putting his camera around his neck. He shuts the door and gets his kit out of the back seat.) </p>
<p>(He heads over to the crime scene.) </p>
<p>(He spits on the ground on his way there.) </p>
<p><strong>D.A. (officer)</strong>: (o.s.) Nick.</p>
<p>(Nick meets up with the officer at the scene.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: D.A. What's going on out here?</p>
<p><strong>D.A. (officer)</strong>: Well, anonymous 9-1-1 caller reported body parts in this area. I rolled and found this.</p>
<p>(The officer points his flashlight down at some insides in a bloody puddle on the concrete.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hmm. Tasty.</p>
<p>(The officer nods. Nick puts his kit down and snaps several photos. He opens his kit and tosses out an evidence marker.) </p>
<p><strong>D.A. (officer)</strong>: Have any idea how long it's going to take you to get this stuff out of here?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well ... I can't move the, uh ... the &quot;body&quot; until the coroner releases the scene. It's a busy night. It's probably gonna take a while, man.</p>
<p>(Nick snaps another photo.) </p>
<p><strong>D.A. (officer)</strong>: Great. Hey, you mind if I step away for a second? I need to get some fresher air.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, sure, take your time.</p>
<p>(The officer turns and walks away from the scene leaving Nick with &quot;the body&quot;.)</p>
<p>[OTHER POV]</p>
<p>(Someone is standing away from them and watching Nick and the officer. He sees the officer walking back to his car.) </p>
<p>[RESUME VIEW]</p>
<p>(Nick snaps another photo. He straightens and takes a whiff of the smell.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Whew!</p>
<p>(Nick turns and sees the officer retching near his car door.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, you, uh ... want some gum?</p>
<p><strong>D.A. (officer)</strong>: No, thank you.</p>
<p>(Nick pops a piece of gum in his mouth and smiles as he tucks the rest in his pocket.) </p>
<p>(Nick takes more evidence markers out of his kit and starts looking around the area. The officer continues to cough and retch in the background near his car.) </p>
<p>(Nick walks around the lot and finds a broken cigarette, the tobacco spilled out on the concrete.)</p>
<p>(Nick puts evidence marker #4 out near the cigarette and snaps a couple of photos.) </p>
<p>[OTHER POV]</p>
<p>(Someone watching Nick moves, ducking behind his cover.) </p>
<p>[RESUME VIEW]</p>
<p>(Nick continues to look around the area.) </p>
<p>(He finds some tire tracks near the area. He puts his things down.) </p>
<p>[OTHER POV]</p>
<p>(A far shot of the area shows that Nick has moved a distance away from the initial crime scene, the police car and the officer.) </p>
<p>[RESUME VIEW]</p>
<p>(Nick snaps a photo of the tire tracks with evidence marker #3.)</p>
<p>(Nick looks around and sees an evidence bag with a Styrofoam cup inside sitting on the concrete sidewalk near the red fire hydrant.)</p>
<p>(Nick puts his flashlight down on the ground, takes out and puts on a couple of latex gloves.) </p>
<p>[OTHER POV]</p>
<p>(The person watches as Nick stands up.)</p>
<p>[RESUME VIEW]</p>
<p>(Nick heads toward the cup. He turns and looks back as he hears the officer still coughing and retching in the background. Nick smiles and shakes his head. He continues toward the cup.) </p>
<p>(Nick reaches the cup near the fire hydrant and puts his camera down. He looks at it, then turns to look back at the officer.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey ...</p>
<p>(We hear the officer still coughing off screen.) </p>
<p>(Nick looks at the cup. He picks up the bag and notices that it's actually an evidence bag.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, that's peculiar.</p>
<p>(Suddenly, a huge, dark figure appears behind Nick as he looks at the cup.)</p>
<p>FLASH CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. PARKING LOT (FLAMINGO AND KOVAL) - NIGHT] </p>
<p>(A car pulls up into the parking lot now filled with officer cars. Catherine and Grissom both step out of the vehicle and head over to Brass, who is grilling the officer at the scene.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Think! Did you see anybody else in the area?</p>
<p><strong>D.A. (officer)</strong>: (shakes his head) I didn't see anything, sir. (Brass sighs.)<br />
I mean, I only took my eyes off him for a couple seconds ... </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You're not supposed to take your eyes off him ever.</p>
<p>(Grissom and Catherine walk over to the initial crime scene and pass Brass on their way.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: He's been gone maybe twenty-five minutes.</p>
<p>(Grissom takes out his flashlight and shines it on the bloody innards on the concrete paving next to evidence marker #1.)</p>
<p>(He looks to the side and finds the tire marks next to evidence marker #2.)</p>
<p>(Continuing the evidence trail, they pass more tire marks and evidence marker<br />
#3.) </p>
<p>(At evidence marker #4, they find Nick's vest and things. Catherine steps forward and puts her bag down and takes out a couple of gloves. Grissom continues on.) </p>
<p>(She puts the gloves on and picks up her flashlight to examine the vest. Looking at the vest, Catherine sees something white. She picks it up and looks at it.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I got some white fibers on Nick's vest.</p>
<p>(She smells it.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Smells like alcohol.</p>
<p>(She puts it in a bag.) </p>
<p>(Meanwhile, Grissom has reached the red fire hydrant and sees the Styrofoam cup in the evidence bag. He considers it for a moment, something appearing off to him.) </p>
<p>(He walks over to it and puts his kit down. He takes out a pair of gloves and puts them on.) </p>
<p>(Catherine is still looking at the vest.)</p>
<p>(Grissom picks up the evidence bag and looks at it.) </p>
<p>(Catherine sees him. She stands up and walks over to him.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Why'd you bag that?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I didn't.</p>
<p>(Catherine kneels down next to Grissom and looks at the bag.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It's the wrong color tape. No initials on the seal. That's not Nick's evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Maybe it's a message.</p>
<p>FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FLASH IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[CU: BULLET] </p>
<p>(The bullet is standing straight up. Someone picks up the bullet.) </p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[WORKSHOP]</p>
<p>(The bullet is placed in a mounted clamp. Someone tightens the clamp, squeezing the bullet.) </p>
<p>(CLOSE-UP: A knife.) </p>
<p>(Someone wearing black gloves twists the sharp end of an Xacto knife.)</p>
<p>(A blonde-haired woman with her mouth taped stares off to the side and whimpers with fright.)</p>
<p>(The new knife tip is tightened.)</p>
<p>(A second blonde-haired woman watches and whimpers.) </p>
<p>(The person cuts into the tip of the bullet. The clamp is released and the bullet removed.) </p>
<p>(The bullet is placed in the top of the cartridge.)</p>
<p>(We see there are two blonde-haired women tied and taped up, their backs to the other.) </p>
<p>(The person loads the cartridge into the gun.) </p>
<p>(He cocks the gun.)</p>
<p>(The women's screams are muffled. He places the muzzle of the gun against the forehead of one of the women.)</p>
<p>(He squeezes the trigger.)</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO: </p>
<p>[INT. CSI - LAB - NIGHT]</p>
<p>LEGEND: EARLIER THAT NIGHT</p>
<p>(The gun fires. Red and blue colored ink spatters against the wall as the bullet hits the dummy.) </p>
<p>(Grissom smiles.)</p>
<p>(He picks up the photo of the blood spatter and walks up to the wall to compare the two. Camera does a quick pan of the blue ink spatter into the red ink spatter on the wall.) </p>
<p>(Grissom looks at the dummies. There are two dummies back to back much in the way the two women were sitting.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Two heads are better than one.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Grissom shares his findings with Sara as they walk through the hallway.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Spatter patterns are a match. One bullet, two victims.</p>
<p>(Sara follows him, the open file folder in her hands. They walk into his office.) </p>
<p>[INT. CSI - GRISSOM'S OFFICE - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Grissom sits down behind his desk.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No, no, no, no. Grissom, that isn't possible. I sampled every square inch of that scene, and there was only one DNA type on the bloodstains.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How 'bout that? Our mystery vics are identical twins.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (surprised) Twins?</p>
<p>(Grissom nods smugly.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, that's different.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Technically, it's the same.</p>
<p>(Sara looks down and sees something new on Grissom's desk.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What's this?</p>
<p>(She picks up the framed certificate.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (excited) I just got it. It's a certificate of honorary ownership of Trigger, &quot;The Smartest Horse in the Movies,&quot; issued by Roy Rogers to the Children of America. Roy felt that the children of America were the true owners of Trigger, so any kid that would write him, he'd send 'em one of those.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: And where did you get it?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Museum, which used to be in Victorville, California, and is now in Branson, Missouri.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Roy Rogers, the cowboy?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: King of the cowboys. (Sara nods, oh.) I wrote to him when I was four. He sent me one of those. I lost it, so I thought I'd replace it.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (amused) And then you thought you would frame it.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(Grissom clears his throat and holds his hand out for the certificate. He takes it back from her.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - BREAK ROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Hodges and Greg sit at the table, a Dukes of Hazzard board game between them. Greg listens as Hodges explains the game to him) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: The object of the game is to be the first one to make it to Uncle Jesse's farm without running into Roscoe. Now, there's two ways to do that. You can either take the dirt road or the highway. Dirt road is slower because you can only roll with one dice, but it's safe because you don't run into any of the Hazzard cards that you would find on the highway, right? </p>
<p>(Hodges scoops up the dice from the board.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: But when you are on the highway, you get to roll two dice, which makes you go faster. </p>
<p>(He drops the dice on the board.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Pretend I'm gonna take the highway, so I'm gonna move General Lee eight spaces. (He moves his red plastic car piece.) One, two, three, four, five ... eight. </p>
<p>(His piece lands on a TAKE A HAZZARD CARD square.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: I hit a Hazzard card. (He picks up a Hazzard card.) Now, Hazzard cards you don't want. (He reads.) &quot;Cooter splashes mud on your windshield.&quot;<br />
You lose one turn, all right?</p>
<p>(He puts the card down and looks at Greg.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Think you got it?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I think I got it.</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: All right, cool.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: All right, well, I've never been one to take the path of least resistance, so I'm going for the dirt road. One dice.</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: You know, far be it from me to wax nostalgic, but, uh, I kind of miss the old Greg. Ugly t-shirts, goofy hair, semi-pornographic magazines ...</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yeah, well, at least I had a style to change. (Greg blows on the dice and rolls.) Four. (He moves his green plastic car piece.) One, two, three, four. &quot;Take a Duke card.&quot; What's a Duke card?</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Duke cards are good. You want one of those 'cause it gets you through the dirt road a lot faster.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Okay, so Duke cards, good; Hazzard cards, bad.</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Correct.</p>
<p>(Greg picks up a Duke card.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (reads) &quot;You jumped over a pile of rocks. Move five extra spaces.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yeah-hoo.</p>
<p>(Greg moves his piece.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Oh, and by the way, uh ... this is just the work me. You haven't had the full David Hodges experience.</p>
<p>(Hodges smiles and nods.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I think I'm having it right now.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Archie Johnson follows Conrad Ecklie through the hallway.) </p>
<p><strong>Archie Johnson</strong>: Aw, come on, you can't unfund me now. I ... I'm committed to presenting the paper at SWAFS next month.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: If it means that much to you, pay your own way. Show a little dedication to your discipline.</p>
<p>(Ecklie grabs his messages and continues down the hallway.) </p>
<p><strong>Archie Johnson</strong>: Oh, yeah. Tragically, my banking account isn't as dedicated as I am.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: One word: Plastic.</p>
<p><strong>Archie Johnson</strong>: Wait. How 'bout you kick me a little overtime under the table, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Over my dead body. Have you been to Grissom's office? You think the City of Las Vegas pays for his etymology library, his insect collection, his shrunken head collection? No. Take initiative. People notice.</p>
<p>(And with that, Ecklie leaves.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - LOCKER ROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Warrick and Nick are in the locker room.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: ... So I took my girl to that Ultimate Fight Championship on Saturday night.</p>
<p>(Warrick grabs his shirt and puts it on.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Oh, yeah, yeah, down over at the, uh, Spur?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah. Almost ended up getting into a smackdown of my own.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No way. You almost got into a beef?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You know, Tina doesn't like me carrying a gun. I play down the fact that I'm a cop when I'm with her anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, yeah, you play the scientist card. (Warrick takes his gun out of the locker.) You're a &quot;copologist.&quot;</p>
<p>(They chuckle.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So, uh, we're standing out in front of the hotel, making out and this guy walks up to me, gets in my face, and asks me how she is.</p>
<p>(Warrick puts the cartridge in the gun, checks the chamber and tucks the gun in his hip holster.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No, he didn't.</p>
<p>(Warrick nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I tell him to get lost. He says, &quot;Make me.&quot; (Nick chuckles.) So I took a step forward and out of nowhere his big, fat bodyguard, looking like wimpy from Popeye, walks up and starts to close in on me.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So, this is out in front of the hotel?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It was at the valet parking, which might as well be in Arizona, it's so far away from the lobby. This fat boy is looking like he's obviously carrying some sort of weapon. And I'm standing there naked as a p0rn star with my girl.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Did you tell them you're a &quot;cop&quot;?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: They didn't seem to care. One of the guys sounded Russian, like he was wanna-be Mafia.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Fat boy was obviously his bodyguard.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So, uh, you know, I wasn't physically afraid of the guys, but something was kind of sinister about them. They were provoking me, but they weren't making a move. It was almost like they were waiting for me to make a move. Say if I smacked big-mouth, fat boy would've came over and stabbed me or something. Even fat boy was vibing me not to take the bait.</p>
<p>(Nick checks his gun and tucks it into his holster.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So what happened?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, valet finally brought Tina's car up. So, I maneuver her around these guys and I put her in her car, and I turn my back to them and let 'em talk this smack.

<p>(Catherine gives both job slips to Warrick. She turns and heads back to her office.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Duke it out.</p>
<p>(Nick shakes his fist at Warrick.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Boy! Better flip a coin. I'll hurt you.</p>
<p>(Nick digs in his pocket for a coin.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, you better flip that coin.</p>
<p>(Nick flips the coin up.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Call it in the air.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Heads.</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Have fun at the trash run.</p>
<p>(Nick sighs. He smiles as he backs away.)</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: People use what they know.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: All right, so, where are we on possible suspects?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: So far, none of Nick's active or recent cases stands out. And his old stalker's still bend bars.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Maybe it's a random act.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, that's possible. Because whoever staged the crime scene couldn't have known that Nick was going to respond.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Your honor. Mrs. Stokes. I'm, uh, sorry that we're meeting under these circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Bill Stokes</strong>: Have you been able to make contact with the animals who took my son?</p>
<p>(Grissom sits down.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No, we haven't yet, but ... they should be contacting us in roughly four hours.</p>
<p><strong>Jillian Stokes</strong>: We were able to rustle up $20,000 cash. Our bank's prepared to wire another $100,000. Now, we can sell the cars. We can hock the ranch ... we can make the number, but it's gonna take at least another day.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Judge Stokes ... </p>
<p>(Mrs. Stokes pushes the envelope across the table toward Grissom and Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Jillian Stokes</strong>: (interrupts) Can we give them ... the money we have now, try to buy more time?</p>
<p>(Catherine looks at Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I don't think that will help.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Bill Stokes</strong>: There's got to be something we can do.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You've already done it by coming here, by showing your support ... </p>
<p><strong>Jillian Stokes</strong>: We're not here to show support. We're here to get Nick home.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We're not sure who has your son ... or why.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Stokes</strong>: Well ... what the hell do you know?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Very little.</p>

<p>(Undersheriff McKeen hangs up. Ecklie walks up to him.) </p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Sir. </p>
<p><strong>Undersheriff McKeen</strong>: Tell me you found him so I can tell the sheriff when his plane lands.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: I wish I could. Listen, I've been looking over my budget. There are a number of things we can do within the lab itself to raise the ransom.</p>
<p><strong>Undersheriff McKeen</strong>: There's no way -- not even a situation like this -- that's going to make the sheriff cut back on services to our taxpayers.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: We wouldn't have to. I'm proposing we eliminate all overtime on lab work except for priority cases, stop hiring based on attrition, reassign existing personnel based on peak staffing needs. Over the next fiscal year, that should clear at least a million.</p>
<p><strong>Undersheriff McKeen</strong>: Assuming any of those measures actually saves money, which isn't really the issue here, is it?</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: I'll take the heat.</p>

You could walk down the streets in this town 15, 20 years ago with 50,000 bucks stacked on the top of your head in singles, and nobody would bother you. (He points to Sam Braun.) Except this guy. He would bother you.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: It's either your money or it's my money.</p>

<p><strong>Tony Curtis</strong>: Take it easy.</p>
<p><strong>Frank Gorshin</strong>: Easy? What do you mean easy? You talking about yourself? (as Rodney Dangerfield) Or her? I'll tell you, if she's easy, I've got my whole day planned.

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: Why should I?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Considering the problems that you've had with the law, you could use some good publicity.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: Do I look like a man that needs publicity? If you're coming to me like a cop with a tin cup in your hand, the answer is no.</p>

<p>(Grissom opens the bag. Inside are stacks of cash.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Catherine, if the press finds out about this, it'll look like Sam Braun bribed the lab.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: He's a casino owner. A leader of industry. Never convicted of any crime. And right now, I don't care about the integrity of the lab at the moment. I care about Nick.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, well, so do I, but nonetheless ...</p>

<p>(Grissom heads for the building. He climbs up the front steps and slides the door open.) </p>
<p>[INT. CARNEY LANE - DAY]</p>
<p>(Inside the building, we see the Ford parked inside. Grissom takes his sunglasses off and notices the Ford. He puts the leather bag on the floor near the door and takes out a flashlight. He looks around the sparse building. On the side is a dead dog.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Las Vegas Crime Lab.</p>
<p><strong>Walter Gordon</strong>: (o.s.) Through the door.</p>
<p>(Grissom picks up the bag and heads inside. As he gets closer to the dog, he hears flies buzzing.) </p>
<p>(He continues forward past the dog feeding dishes and over to the file box on the floor. He walks past it toward the door to the next room.)</p>
<p>(In the next room, a man sits behind the desk and watches Nick through the live feed on the computer monitor.) </p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yes.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (interrupts) Normally, you'd be 100% right, but this time, you're<br />
100% wrong. We want Nick back, no tricks.</p>
<p>(Walter Gordon kneels down and zips the bag open. He looks at the $10,000 pack of $100 bills. He chuckles.)</p>
<p><strong>Walter Gordon</strong>: This looks real.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It is real. Where is Nick?</p>
<p>(He tosses the money back into the bag.) </p>
<p><strong>Walter Gordon</strong>: You know, I was under the impression it was against departmental policy to negotiate with terrorists.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Are you a terrorist?</p>
<p><strong>Walter Gordon</strong>: Depends. </p>
<p>(He shines his flashlight on Grissom's face.) </p>

[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Brass and Sara interview Kelly Gordon.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So at trial, you testified that you went with your boyfriend to visit a buddy of his. And when you went in the house, your boyfriend blew the guy away.</p>
<p><strong>Kelly Gordon</strong>: He wasn't my boyfriend. I knew the guy two weeks. Why am I here?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: A Styrofoam cup with your DNA on it was found in that house. You claimed you dropped it running for your life.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: The Styrofoam cup hits the ground, spilling its contents on the floor.) </p>
<p>(Quick flash to: Kelly Gordon runs out of the building.)</p>
<p>(End of flash. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Kelly Gordon</strong>: My word against a cup, and the next five years, I'm being traded for cigarettes by my cellmate.</p>
<p>(She looks at them. They say nothing and she gets the feeling that they don't care about her story.) </p>
<p><strong>Kelly Gordon</strong>: You're not reopening my case. What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Your father took it pretty hard.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: He was an aerospace engineer, right? Good with explosives?</p>
<p><strong>Kelly Gordon</strong>: So, this is about my dad?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (sighs) You know, we had your visitor's log. Your father stopped coming to see you six weeks into your sentence.</p>
<p><strong>Kelly Gordon</strong>: Seeing your daughter turned into some ... hood rat's lesbian s*x slave can be rather emotional.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Why did he come see you last week? Did you know what he was planning to do?</p>
<p><strong>Kelly Gordon</strong>: I don't know. What did he do?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: He kidnapped a friend of mine. A CSI. And then he blew himself up. Tried to take some cops with him.</p>
<p><strong>Kelly Gordon</strong>: How many did he get?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hey, we're all still here.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (interrupts) Nick is still missing.</p>
<p><strong>Kelly Gordon</strong>: Who's Nick?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The CSI is still missing. Do you know where he is?</p>
<p><strong>Kelly Gordon</strong>: That's pretty funny -- you guys not being able to find something.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, look, if you cooperate, we can get your sentence reduced.</p>
<p><strong>Kelly Gordon</strong>: (nods) You know what I used to do before this? Back when I was alive? I used to grow things. Outside. I was studying horticulture. Flowers. My cellmate, Trish, gave me one for Valentine's Day. </p>
<p>(She puts her left hand palm open on the table to show a white flower tattoo on her palm.) </p>
<p><strong>Kelly Gordon</strong>: Want to smell it? (harshly) I hope your friend dies.</p>

[INT. CARNEY LANE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Catherine snaps photos of the Ford from inside the front seat.) </p>
<p>(She opens the glove compartment and snaps more photos.)</p>
<p>(Greg sits inside the empty warehouse and goes through the different items in the large plastic bin. He picks up what looks like a tooth and looks at it. He drops it in the red bucket just behind him.) </p>
<p>(He reaches into the tub for the next piece.)</p>
<p>(A distance away from them, Warrick is sketching a layout of the scene. He's doing it half-heartedly, his mind elsewhere. Frustrated and unsatisfied with the sketch, he rips the paper out of the book and tosses it aside.) </p>
<p>(Greg continues to sift through the tub, writing down what he finds.) </p>
<p>(He picks up a wire and holds it up.)</p>
<p>(Camera zooms in for a close-up of the wire ends.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (thinking out loud) Hey, I found a trigger wire. Maybe ... once we reassemble all the components, we'll be able to tell where the bomb came from. Maybe that ...</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (interrupts) Yeah, maybe, maybe, maybe. (losing it) Maybe if we count up all the damn &quot;maybes,&quot; maybe Nick will be alive!</p>
<p>(Angry, Warrick kicks the plastic container toward Greg. It hits the floor, spattering liquid near him. Greg stands up.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (shouts) You know what I'm saying?!</p>
<p>(Catherine stops and stares at Warrick.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (irritated) Was that necessary? Never mind my clothes. Look at the evidence.</p>
<p>(Greg puts the clipboard down.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p>(Warrick throws his clipboard on the floor and walks away.) </p>
<p>(Catherine gets out of the car and follows Warrick.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Sorry, Greg. I'll go talk to him.</p>
<p>(Catherine catches up with Warrick near the doorway.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, Warrick, hey. Hey, how you holding up?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'm not.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I just can't help thinking that could have been me in that box, you know? We flipped a coin for that trash run.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, Nick is not inside a box because of the flip of a coin.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: If that was me, I would have ...</p>
<p>(He presses his two fingers against the side of his forehead as if it were a gun, his implications clear.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (firmly) Hey, you know what? I know you. I don't believe that. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (upset) No. You're wrong. I wouldn't have lasted this far. Catherine, if something happens to Nick, if we don't bring him back in one piece ...</p>
<p>(Before he can finish that sentence, Greg calls out from off screen.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (interrupts) Hey, guys, come here. I found something.</p>
<p>(Catherine and Warrick head over to Greg.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Look at this.</p>
<p>(Taking the bent-out-of-shaped jug that Warrick kicked, Greg pours some of the liquid on the ground and we see the outline of something there just under the dirt.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: There's something underneath there.</p>
<p>(Warrick, Catherine and Greg start brushing away the dirt form the lid.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Oh, got an edge right here. All right.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Another over here.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Greg, get some crowbars.</p>
<p>(Greg runs to get the crowbars. Warrick and Catherine continue to brush the dirt away from the lid. Greg returns with the crowbars.) </p>
<p>(He hands Warrick one.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Do you think Nick could be under here?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I don't know, man. It would have to be at least six feet long.</p>
<p>(They lift the concrete lid up and off the patch of dirt.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, but if he buried him lengthwise, and who's to say he didn't ... he could be.</p>
<p>(Suddenly, there's a very real urgency and they start to dig. Catherine puts her mask back on and starts digging.) </p>

(Warrick and a couple of others dig out the area with shovels. Catherine and Greg stand on the side just behind some lights and watch.) </p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[NICK] </p>
<p>(In the darkness, Nick hears something - scraping, scratching sounds - coming from outside and above the box.) </p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (shouts) Hey!</p>
<p>[WARRICK]</p>
<p>(Warrick and the others continue to dig.) </p>
<p>[NICK]</p>
<p>(Nick shakes his glow stick for more light.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (shouts) I'm in here!</p>
<p>(He knocks on the Plexiglas in front of him.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (voice cracking) Hey!</p>
<p>(Nick starts to sing, louder than before. The scraping, scratching, crunching noises continue.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (singing) It was Christmas in Las Vegas / when the locals take the town ... Teresa hit a streak / and laid her waitress apron down ... </p>
<p>[WARRICK]</p>
<p>(Warrick hits something and stops.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I hit something.</p>
<p>(He uses the tip of the shovel and taps at it. There's a hollow thumping noise.) </p>
<p>[NICK]</p>
<p>(The scraping, scratching, crunching noises continue. Nick taps on the Plexiglas with his knuckles.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (singing) She was playing penny poker / over at the old Gold Spike ... </p>
<p>[WARRICK]</p>
<p>(Warrick puts the shovel aside. He sits in the hole and starts digging with his hands. Catherine and Greg stand just outside the hole and watch.) </p>

<p>(The crunching sounds continue.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: The air.</p>
<p>[CATHERINE]</p>
<p>(Catherine leans forward.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It's Plexiglas.</p>
<p>(Catherine reaches into the hole and helps dig out the dirt.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Nick!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Nick?</p>

<p>(Nick knocks on the Plexiglas.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (yells) Hey, I'm right here!</p>

<p>[INSIDE THE BOX POV] </p>
<p>(The dirt covering the top of the box is brushed away.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Nick! Hold on there, buddy!</p>
<p>(Warrick and Catherine brush the dirt aside.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Nick?</p>
<p>(They continue to brush the dirt aside.) </p>
<p>[RESUME VIEW]</p>
<p>(They look inside the box and see a dead dog.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It's a dog. (upset) It's a dog.</p>
<p>(Warrick shakes his head in frustration, stands up and gets out of the hole.) </p>
<p>[NICK]</p>
<p>(Meanwhile, the crunching sounds inside the box continue. Nick looks down at the gun shot holes near his feet. The pressure of the dirt around the coffin is causing the Plexiglas to crack.) </p>
<p>(Helpless to stop it, Nick watches the glass surrounding him crack.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (pleads) Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.</p>
<p>(The cracking continues.) </p>

<p>SMASH CUT TO: </p>
<p>[EXT. FOREST (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - GARAGE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Warrick puts his pen down. He picks up the fan unit and looks at it. Next to him is the open Plexiglas coffin, it's lid open.) </p>
<p>(Warrick takes the hose off the fan and looks inside the unit.) </p>
<p>(He takes the hose off the coffin and looks at the attachment there.) </p>
<p>(He walks around the coffin and looks inside.)</p>
<p>(He peels off the vent piece and looks at it.) </p>
<p>(He walks around the unit and looks at the battery attached to the side.)</p>
<p>(He puts the fan back together and attaches it to the fan. The light inside the coffin goes on and the fan runs.) </p>
<p>(He looks at the monitor reading. It goes from 9.3 to 15.4.) </p>
<p>[NICK]</p>
<p>(Meanwhile, the Plexiglas at Nick's feet has broken inward under the pressure. His legs are partially covered with dirt.) </p>
<p>(The Plexiglas continues to crack around him.) </p>
<p>(Nick has the tape recorder in his hand. He clicks it on.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: My name is Nick Stokes. If anybody finds this tape, turn it in to the Las Vegas ... PD. There should be a reward.</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mom ... (voice cracks) ... Cisco ... well, this is a lousy way to say good-bye, but it's all I've got.</p>
<p>(Grissom watches.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I love you. You raised me right ... and I'm going to miss you.<br />
(swallows) As for the rest of you guys, I know you did the best you could to find me.</p>
<p>(Grissom watches, his mouth moving as he reads what Nick's saying on the monitor.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Grissom ...</p>
<p>[CU: GRISSOM'S EYES]</p>
<p>[MONITOR ON NICK]</p>
<p>(With no audio available on the live-feed, Nick continues speaking into the tape recorder as Grissom watches, reading and understanding. He responds quietly to what Nick's saying.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (quietly) No, you never did, Nick.</p>
<p>(Grissom continues to watch the monitor. Suddenly, Nick looks down at his feet and appears to lose it. He drops the tape recorder and it falls near his head. He's looking down at his feet.) </p>
<p>(Sara and Archie watch the monitor.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: He's going into convulsions. (louder) He's losing it.</p>
<p>(Sara turns and looks back at Grissom. Grissom looks at the monitor.) </p>
<p>(Nick appears to be in full-mode panic.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What's going on?</p>
<p>(Grissom's just as puzzled as she is.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What is -- ?</p>
<p>(Staring at the monitor, he sees something.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Wait a minute.</p>
<p>(Grissom enhances the view on the live-feed, zooming the camera's focus on the wall near Nick's head. He sees it: The ants on the side of the glass coffin.) </p>
<p>(Sara turns and looks back at Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Ants.</p>
<p>(Nick isn't panicking. He's screaming.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: My God, he's being eaten alive.</p>

<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[GROUND] </p>
<p>(The camera view starts low to the ground following the ants' movement. We hear the scraping, crunching sounds the ants are making. The camera continues along the dirt up to the Plexiglas hole.) </p>
<p>[NICK]</p>
<p>(The ants are all over Nick's shoes, pants and clothes.)</p>
<p>(The camera continues to pan slowly up. Nick digs into his pocket and takes out a latex glove.)</p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[INT. CSI - A/V LAB-NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Sara is standing just behind Grissom as they both watch Nick over the monitor. We can see the ants covering Nick's face. He keeps his eyes shut tight and tears off something to shove into his nose.) </p>
<p>(Although he's in pain, Nick forces himself to stop moving. Grissom approves.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (smiles grimly) That's it, Nicky. Stay still. (beat) They won't bite. (beat) As much.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - GARAGE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Catherine, Warrick and Greg continue to work on the Plexiglas coffin, hoping that there's some clue as to where Nick is buried.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: This has got to be a prototype. It was probably built to test how long he could keep somebody alive inside.</p>
<p>(Greg is under the coffin. He swabs a circular pressure indention on the bottom, under it. Hodges leans forward, peering at Greg. He points to the circles.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Now, what are those?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p>(Hodges stands up.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: All right, based on this battery and what's running off of it, and the fact that we kept the damn light on for as long as we did, I figure Nick's got another ninety minutes left, now.</p>
<p>(Greg and Catherine remain quiet.)</p>

<p>(Another ant barely walks over the lens, but not much.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah. That's it.</p>
<p>(Grissom sits in front of the monitor.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Come on. Little more.</p>
<p>(Sara steps up behind Grissom and watches what he's doing.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (coaxing) Keep coming. Show me what you're made of. Come on, buddy.</p>
<p>(An ant dances across the edge of the lens.) </p>
<p>(Finally, it lands dead center on the lens.)</p>

<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - GRISSOM'S OFFICE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(With the photo in his hand, Grissom rushes back to his office. He heads for his library and pulls down the large book. He flips through the pages ... and finds it.) </p>

<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - BREAK ROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Grissom briefs the team.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (talking quickly) They're fire ants, very rare in Nevada. They don't like our soil. The only places you find them around Vegas are in plant and tree nurseries.</p>
<p>(Grissom stops walking behind Catherine who is in front of the computer.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: There's eleven nurseries in the greater Las Vegas area.</p>
<p>(Archie has the map of the area spread out in front of him.) </p>
<p><strong>Archie Johnson</strong>: Okay, I've got the web cam trace down to here.</p>
<p>(He draws a large circle in black ink on the map.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: And the data from the black box in Walter Gordon's truck gave us a 23-mile travel radius.</p>
<p>(Greg adds another circle, cutting the area down even more. Warrick walks out with the printout of the nurseries. He quickly scans the list.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Okay, I've got two nurseries within the overlap area. Here and here.</p>
<p>(He adds two 'X' marks to the map within the overlapping area. Sara remembers something.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Wait, wait. Wait, wait. Kelly Gordon, the daughter, worked with plants. Hold on. Hold on.</p>
<p>(Camera follows Sara as she runs out of the lab and down the hallway to Grissom's office. She picks up the file folder from his desk and checks the information. She runs full circle back to the break room.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You guys, Nick is here.</p>
<p>(She points to the left-most blue 'X' on the map.) </p>
<p>HARD CUT TO: </p>
<p>[EXT. ROAD - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(A long line of officer cars rush down the long stretch of highway - lights flashing, sirens blaring.) </p>
<p>(The lead car pulls off the road to the right.)</p>
<p>(Inside one of the cars, Grissom drives.) </p>
<p>(The long line of officer cars and other emergency personnel vehicles follows.) </p>
<p>(In his car, Warrick glances at his watch: 0:10 minutes left.) </p>
<p>(They reach the nursery where the owner is waiting for them.)</p>
<p>[EXT. NURSERY - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Grissom exits his car and walks up to the owner.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You said on the phone you had a fire ant mound. Where is it?</p>
<p><strong>Nursery Owner</strong>: People usually prefer to stay away from it.</p>
<p>(The owner of the nursery shows them the fire ant mount. Grissom turns and looks at the rest of his team.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: All right, look. Fan out. Look for loose soil. Anything that might've been dug up recently.</p>
<p>(They disburse. Brass walks up to Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: That's the whole place.</p>
<p>(The officers jog down the road, looking for anything recently dug. Catherine walks slowly down the side of the road. At her hip, she has an electronic emitter. She points the wand end down on the ground as she walks by. The unit gives of an electronic hum and a very slow, steady beep.) </p>
<p>(More officers disburse through the trees.)</p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong>: Right down there. Let's go! Right now.</p>
<p>[CATHERINE]</p>
<p>(Catherine continues following the main road through the nursery. The unit at her hip starts to beep a little more rapidly.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (shouts) He-e-ey! I'm picking up the web cam transmitter.</p>
<p>(Sara, Warrick and other officers turn and rush toward Catherine.) </p>
<p>(Catherine continues down the main road.) </p>
<p>(She turns the corner and continues walking. She nearly trips on the vent pipe as she steps on something hollow just below the dirt.) </p>
<p>(She turns and sees the coffin's vent pipe sticking straight up out of the ground.) </p>
<p>(She points her wand down at the pipe and it beeps a little faster. Just a few yards away from the first vent pipe is another vent pipe sticking out of the ground.) </p>
<p>(She walks over to the second vent pipe and the beeping speeds up.) </p>
<p>(Catherine puts her things down and starts digging near the vent pipe, pushing the dirt away with her bare hands.) </p>
<p>(In the dirt, she finds a plastic bag with the small video transmitter unit inside.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (shouts) This is it! I found it! It's here.</p>
<p>(The others run to Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (shouts) I found it! This is it!</p>
<p>(Catherine leans in close to the vent pipe and shouts inside.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Nick! Nick, we're here. Hang on!</p>
<p>(Camera zooms in through the vent pipe, down through the vent and into the coffin where Nick is sealed up tight.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (o.s.) Nicky!</p>
<p>(Nick's face is covered with ants. Nick gives a muffled groan.) </p>
<p>(Camera zooms in extremely close showing one ant biting him.)</p>
<p>(Camera zooms over to another ant biting him.)</p>
<p>(Camera zooms over for an extreme close-up of another ant in the process of biting him, its mandibles sinking in through his skin.)</p>

<p>(Nick is on the table. He's dead.) </p>

<p>(He picks up Nick's hand and arm to show the large welts and discolored pustules.) </p>

<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Would you care to do the &quot;y&quot; incision?</p>
<p>(On NICK, eyes wide open and wide awake and on the table. A large butcher's knife is passed across the table right in front of him.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Well, &quot;Y&quot; not?</p>
<p>(David takes the large butcher's knife from Robbins. David turns and sinks the knife into Nick's chest. We hear a lovely squishy sound of flesh being cut.)</p>
<p>(Nick doesn't flinch.)</p>
<p>(David puts the large butcher's knife aside as Robbins peels the flesh over the left side of Nick's chest open. The music continues in the background.) </p>
<p>(David peels back the flesh over the right side of Nick's chest open.) </p>
<p>(CLOSE-UP OF NICK'S FACE. Nick's eyes open.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (o.s.) Mind your hands and feet.</p>
<p>(The saw starts whirring.) </p>
<p>(Both David and Robbins are wearing face protection as Robbins wields the huge chain saw over Nick's chest.) </p>
<p>(He sticks the tip of the huge chain saw in Nick's chest, blood spurts everywhere.) </p>
<p>(Nick doesn't flinch and watches dispassionately. Nick blinks. Blood spatters on his chest.) </p>
<p>(The chain saw continues to whir as Robbins uses it to cut through Nick's rib cage. Blood is everywhere. Robbins turns the chain saw off.)</p>
<p>(Nick blinks and looks over at Robbins.) </p>
<p>(Having sufficiently covered much of their clothing and everything else with a thick layer of Nick's blood and mulched flesh, Robbins puts the chain saw aside and removes his face protection. Robbins looks at the cut he's just made.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (appreciatively) Yes.</p>
<p>(Robbins reaches in and cracks open Nick's chest, removing the rib cage with a grunt. He holds the piece and looks at David before tossing it carelessly over his shoulder. It hits the floor with a thunk.) </p>
<p>(He looks inside Nick's chest.) </p>

<p>[RESUME VIEW]</p>
<p>(Robbins reaches in and starts pulling out Nick's intestines like one very long sausage.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (appreciatively) Nice.</p>
<p>[CU: NICK'S FACE]</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Lung. </p>
<p>(Nick watches as Robbins passes his lung across the table in front of him. David takes it.) </p>
<p>[RESUME VIEW]</p>
<p>(In living color. Suddenly, where David used to be standing, Judge Stokes leans across the table.) </p>
<p><strong>Judge Bill Stokes</strong>: (cheerfully) So, Doctor. How did my son die? Anaphylactic shock?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: No, no, he didn't live long enough for that. COD was asphyxiation.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Bill Stokes</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (teaching mode) When the blood oxygen drops to less than 16% and the CO2 builds up, there's a rapid loss of consciousness. Death within minutes with no disfiguring physical findings.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Bill Stokes</strong>: He'll look great at the funeral.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Oh, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Bill Stokes</strong>: His mother will appreciate that.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Good.</p>
<p>(Robbins reaches into the chest cavity and pulls out Nick's beating heart.) </p>
<p>[CU: NICK'S EYES]</p>
<p>(Nick watches them. We hear Nick's heart beating.)</p>
<p>(Robbins holds Nick's heart in his hand.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Your son had a good heart.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Bill Stokes</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p>(Robbins puts Nick's heart in Judge Stokes' hand.)</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO: END OF NICK'S HALLUCINATION RESUME TO PRESENT</p>
<p>[NICK]</p>
<p>(Suddenly, Nick's eyes open. He's still in the box, his face is cast in the greenish-colored hue from the glow sticks. Ants cover his face.) </p>
<p>(Camera pulls back.)</p>
<p>(Nick's still in the box. His eyes widen with panic. He's on the verge of losing it.) </p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[EXT. NURSERY - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Warrick and other officers dig quickly in the area surrounding the vent pipe. Grissom and the others stand off to the side, watching.) </p>
<p>(Warrick continues to dig.)</p>
<p>(Suddenly, his watch beeps. He stops digging and looks at his watch: 0:00.) </p>
<p>(Time's up.) </p>
<p>[NICK]</p>
<p>(Inside the box, the whirring sound of the fan slowly stops as the battery runs out of juice. Nick hears it and realizes what's happening.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (groans softly) Oh, my God. No, no, no, no.</p>
<p>(The hand holding the gun shakes as he screams weakly. He slowly pulls the gun up toward him.) </p>
<p>[WARRICK]</p>
<p>(Meanwhile, outside, Warrick glances back at Catherine. He goes back to digging.)</p>
<p>(Then he hits the coffin cover.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I hit something.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (shouts) We got you, Nicky!</p>
<p>(Warrick puts the shovel aside and starts clearing off the dirt with his hands.) </p>
<p>[NICK]</p>
<p>(Inside the box, Nick struggles against the ants and his sudden lack of fresh oxygen.)</p>
<p>(He presses the muzzle of the gun against his chin.) </p>
<p>[WARRICK]</p>
<p>(Warrick quickly brushes the dirt away from the edges of the coffin, trying to clear the cover.) </p>
<p>[NICK] </p>
<p>(Inside, Nick grimaces and screams weakly, the gun still pressed to his chin.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (muffled) Hey!</p>
<p>(Light from outside the box reflects off of Nick's face, but Nick has his eyes tightly shut.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (muffled) Hey!</p>
<p>(Warrick clears off more dirt and we can see his blurry figure just outside the box glass.) </p>
<p>(Warrick works furiously, brushing the dirt away from the cover.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We got you, man! Hey, Nicky!</p>
<p>(Inside the box, Nick wipes the condensation off the glass with his hands.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Nicky! Yeah. Hey, hold on there.</p>
<p>(Warrick gets a good look at Nick.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey, put that down. Put that down.</p>
<p>(The end of the box is cleared and we see Nick shaking uncontrollably inside.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Put that down. We got you. We're gonna get you out of here. </p>
<p>(Inside, Nick is in pain as the ants continue to attack him.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hang in there. (shouts) Oh, my God. We need that fire extinguisher! Give me that fire extinguisher.</p>
<p>[GREG]</p>
<p>(Greg runs back to the vehicle and removes the fire extinguisher from the back.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (o.s.) These ants are getting at him, man.</p>
<p>(Greg runs back with the fire extinguisher.) </p>
<p>[WARRICK]</p>
<p>(There's a commotion as people scramble.)</p>
<p>(Warrick wedges the shovel under the coffin cover and lifts it up a crack as Greg kneels down with the fire extinguisher.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Short bursts, Greg. Don't suffocate him!</p>
<p>(Greg shoots a couple of bursts from the fire extinguisher into the coffin.) </p>
<p>(Camera zooms in and follows the burst along Nick's arm and we watch the ants freeze and die on the spot.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hang on, buddy. Hang on. Almost had him.</p>
<p>(Warrick motions for the others to help clear off more of the coffin cover.) </p>
<p>(Sara, standing on the side, turns and shouts over her shoulder.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Get the paramedics!</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (to Nick) Hang on. Hang on. We'll kill those ants, okay? You listen to me.</p>
<p>(Again, they lift up the cover as Greg shoots more CO2 into the coffin to get the ants off Nick.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(Catherine's phone rings. She answers it.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to phone) Willows.</p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[INT. CSI - GARAGE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Hodges is on the phone as he stands over the prototype Plexiglas coffin in the garage.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: (to phone) Yeah. Hey, boss ...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to phone) (interrupts) We found him. We're getting him out now.</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: (to phone) That's great. Wai-wait. Don't-don't hang up. Just-just listen.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to phone) What? What?</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: (to phone) (carefully) Those dimples on the bottom of the prototype. GCMS found traces of semtex on each one.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to phone) You got to be kidding me.</p>
<p>(Meanwhile, they've cleared the coffin cover and are getting ready to open it.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: One, two, three.</p>
<p>(But before they move, Catherine stops them.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (shouts) Everyone out of the hole. That box is ready to explode!</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Are you kidding?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Get out of there now!</p>
<p>(Everyone but Warrick clears the hole. Warrick doesn't move.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'm not leaving without Nick.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: There are charges under the box!</p>
<p>(Grissom stands out on the side, thinking. Suddenly, he turns and sees the backhoe nearby. We can see him thinking, his mind working out a solution.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (stubbornly) I'm not leaving here without him.</p>
<p>(TOP VIEW DOWN. Warrick is the only person remaining in the hole, his hands just under the coffin cover - refusing to move, refusing to abandon Nick.)</p>
<p>(Grissom gets an idea.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Warrick, Catherine's right. Get out of the hole now. (firmly) I know what we're gonna do. Just trust me.</p>
<p>(Warrick looks back at Grissom. He slowly releases his hold on the coffin cover. He turns back and looks at Nick.)</p>
<p>(Inside the box, Nick screams and thumps weakly on the cover as he sees everyone leave his line of vision.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Help!</p>
<p>(Nick sees Warrick leave.) </p>
<p>(Outside, Grissom shouts the instructions to the officers.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We need 200 pounds of dirt over here right now, and we're gonna use that backhoe to get it.</p>
<p>(The group of officers run to the backhoe.) </p>
<p>(Grissom jumps into the hole. Nick is screaming and hitting the coffin cover.) </p>
<p>(Grissom lands on the cover and brushes the dirt away from the glass.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Nick!</p>
<p>(Nick can see Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Can you hear me?</p>
<p>(Inside the box, Nick quivers and shakes.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's gonna take us a minute to get you out of there, okay? Nick!</p>
<p>(But Nick's not listening. All he wants is out of the box. He continues to hit the box cover with his hands.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Pancho!</p>
<p>(Reacting to the familiarity, Nick stops struggling.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Listen to me.</p>
<p>(Grissom puts his right hand flat on the box cover.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Put your hand on my hand.</p>
<p>(Nick concentrates and puts his left hand flat on the box cover directly under Grissom's.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Good. Now listen. There may be explosives under the box. They're probably set on pressure switches.</p>
<p>(Camera zooms into the box and past Nick's head. It zooms down deeper past the box to the explosives lined up under it.)</p>
<p>(Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We need to equalize your body weight before we can pull you out, okay?</p>
<p>(Nick breathes heavily inside the box.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Pancho, nod your head if you understand me.</p>
<p>(After a brief moment, Nick slowly nods his head.)</p>
<p>(Grissom stands up and yells back to the officers.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Okay, we're gonna use the dirt from the backhoe to equalize his weight. (He turns and looks at Sara.) I need a rope and a caribiner.</p>
<p>(Sara takes off running to get the items.) </p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p>(Grissom kneels back on the coffin to talk with Nick. He puts his hand back flat on the glass over Nick's hand.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: All right, Pancho, we're gonna open the lid and get you out, but I need you to stay lying down. Okay? Or else you'll blow us all up. (Nick nods.) You understand that?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (o.s.) Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Do you promise?</p>
<p>(Nick nods. The backhoe engines get louder as the machine approaches.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Pancho, say, &quot;I promise.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (crying) I promise.</p>
<p>(Catherine directs the backhoe over toward Nick.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (motions) Bring it over. This way!</p>
<p>(The backhoe arrives. Grissom looks at the cover.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to Nick) Don't move.</p>
<p>(Grissom and Warrick open the coffin lid.) </p>
<p>(Nick lets out a loud sob as he cries. He reaches out his hand blindly, grasping Grissom's arm as he reaches into the coffin to place his hand over Nick's chest.) </p>
<p>(Warrick reaches into the coffin to grab Nick.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (softly) I got you. I got you. </p>
<p>(Nick grabs Warrick's hand, all the while talking quietly to him.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (softly) Lay still. Lay still. It's okay. It's okay.</p>
<p>(The initial wave of panic subsides. Nick calms down.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (panting) Okay, okay.</p>
<p>(Nick looks at Grissom and nods. Grissom turns and shouts over his shoulder.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: All right, bring that over.</p>
<p>(The backhoe, filled with dirt, is driven over to where Nick is.) </p>
<p>(Grissom latches the hook and rope around Nick's belt buckle. He stands outside the hole and holds the end of the rope.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Okay, Pancho, I want you to close your eyes and hold your breath.</p>
<p>(Nick nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to the driver) Now!</p>
<p>(The dirt is dropped into the hole, filling it.) </p>
<p>(Grissom and everyone standing behind him hold onto the rope.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Ready? Go!</p>
<p>(A beat later, they tug hard and jerk Nick right out from the loose dirt and out of the coffin. Nick comes flying out of the dirt, landing on the ground hard.) </p>
<p>(A moment later, the coffin explodes shooting dirt straight up into the air; the dirt and dust billows around the area.) </p>
<p>(Warrick steps past Grissom toward Nick who remains twitching on the ground, his eyes shut.)</p>
<p>(But, he's alive.) </p>
<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO:<br />
(Nick is wrapped securely on the gurney, lifted up and placed in the back of the ambulance.) </p>
<p>(Warrick and Catherine climb into the back of the ambulance while Ecklie, Grissom, Sara, Brass and Greg remain outside.) </p>
<p>(Nick reaches out and Warrick grabs Nick's hand. Catherine places her hand on Nick's leg as the EMTs shut the ambulance doors.) </p>
<p>(The ambulance drives away. Sara, Brass and Greg stare at the ambulance.) </p>
<p>(Grissom sighs heavily.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I want my guys back.</p>
<p>(Ecklie turns and looks at Grissom.) </p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[EXT. HIGHWAY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>(A lone vehicle travels up the long stretch of desert highway.) </p>
<p>[EXT. WOMEN'S CORRECTIONAL FACILITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. WOMEN'S CORRECTIONAL FACILITY - VISITOR'S ROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(A guard escorts Kelly Gordon, #2232, to her chair. She sits down. Nick sits on the other side of the window and waves to her.) </p>
<p>(He motions to the phone. He picks his side up and after a moment, she reluctantly picks up her side.) </p>
<p><strong>Kelly Gordon</strong>: You the one?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (smiles) Yeah. (clears his throat) Yeah, back at you.</p>
<p><strong>Kelly Gordon</strong>: What do you want me to say? I'm sorry?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No, you didn't do anything to me. And what your dad did, I ... I guess it's 'cause he loves you so much.</p>
<p>(Not believing it for a moment or perhaps she just doesn't want to hear it, she hangs up. Nick tries to stop her.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, Kelly. Kelly.</p>
<p>(Nick is barely holding it together. He motions to the phone again.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Pick it up.</p>
<p>(Kelly picks up the phone. Nick leans forward.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: In a few years ... when you get out of here ... don't take it with you.</p>
<p><strong>Kelly Gordon</strong>: That's it?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah. Yeah, that's it.</p>
<p>(Kelly hangs up and looks to the guard off screen.) </p>
<p><strong>Kelly Gordon</strong>: We're done.</p>
<p>(Kelly stands up and leaves Nick with the phone in his hand. He takes a moment and takes a breath.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: That's it.</p>
<p>(Nick hangs up the phone. He wipes his nose.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (quietly) That's it.</p>
<p>(He stands up and leaves.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. WOMEN'S CORRECTIONAL FACILITY - HALLWAY - DAY]</p>
<p>(The guard escorts Kelly Gordon down the long hallway back to her cell. She puts Kelly in her cell and locks the door.)</p>
<p>(Kelly climbs up on her bunk and clutches her pillow to her. She hunkers down in a corner of her bed and stares out in front of her. Camera holds on her and we can see that she's thinking about what Nick said.) </p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>

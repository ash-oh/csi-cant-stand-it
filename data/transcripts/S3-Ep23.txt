<hr />
[INT. FIRST MONUMENT BANK - DAY]</p>
<p>(The bank teller hands the customer his cash. The sign next to the teller reads: Transactions after 3:00 p.m. will be processed on the next business day. The teller smiles and continues to do business with the customer.)</p>
<p>(Inside the bank, there's a line waiting for the next available teller.)</p>
<p>(The little boy at the front of the line turns around and looks at DET. CYRUS LOCKWOOD who stands near the end of the line. LOCKWOOD searches his pockets and pushes his jacket aside. On his waist is his gun and badge. LOCKWOOD notices the little boy watching him. The little boy smiles and continues to stare at LOCKWOOD. JIMMY'S MOM notices JIMMY staring at LOCKWOOD.)</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy's Mom</strong>: Jimmy, stop staring.</p>
<p>(JIMMY looks up at his mom and smiles. JIMMY'S MOM smiles at LOCKWOOD.)</p>

<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. FIRST MONUMENT BANK - DAY -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(The gunmen open the front door. The guard standing in front of the door turns around. The first gunman swings his fist and knocks the guard in the jaw. The guard spins around and falls to the floor.)</p>
<p>(The customers in the bank turn around to see what the commotion is about.)</p>
<p>(The second gunman raises his weapon to the ceiling and fires, getting everyone's attention. The customers start to scream.)</p>
<p><strong>Gunman</strong>: Up against the glass, now! GUNMAN: Come on. Let's go. Move it! GUNMAN: Move it! Come on. Let's go!</p>
<p>(The customers rush toward the teller glass to comply.)</p>
<p><strong>Gunman</strong>: (to the other gunman) Let's go. Let's go! Up there!</p>
<p>(One of the gunmen heads straight for the security camera and starts to cover the lens.)</p>
<p>(LOCKWOOD watches everything happen cautiously. He puts his checkbook back into his breast pocket and heads for the glass with the rest of the customers.)</p>
<p><strong>Gunman</strong>: Get near the glass. Don't move!</p>
<p>(One of the gunmen gathers the customers to make sure that they comply.)</p>
<p>[SECURITY CAMERA VIEW]</p>
<p>(The gunman climbs up the chair, stares into the camera, and starts smudging something black onto the lens. The view of the gunman and the rest of the bank is slowly blackened out.)</p>
<p>[INT. FIRST MONUMENT BANK - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(The gunman points his gun at JIMMY'S MOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Gunman</strong>: (loudly) Lady! One peep, and you die. GUNMAN: The boy, too.</p>
<p>(LOCKWOOD hears the threat.)</p>
<p>(The final gunman walks into the bank. He walks up to the teller glass.)</p>
<p><strong>Gunman</strong>: Hands on the wall, now! Move it!</p>
<p>(The gunman fires at the teller glass and breaks it. The women scream. JIMMY'S MOM pulls JIMMY aside as the glass shatters around them. She puts her arms protectively around JIMMY'S head.)</p>
<p>(The gunman jumps onto the teller counter and heads for the bank vault. He grabs the BANK MANAGER with his hands up standing in front of the glass doors. He pushes him in through the glass doors and follows him.)</p>
<p><strong>Gunman</strong>: Move it, let's go! Come on! Come on! Come on!</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. FIRST MONUMENT BANK - VAULT - DAY -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(POV inside the vault. The front doors of the vault are clear and see through. The GUNMAN pushes the BANK MANAGER up against the door.)</p>

<p>(The BANK MANAGER hurriedly punches in a &quot;5&quot;, a &quot;4&quot; &amp; several other numbers on the keypad in front of the glass doors.)</p>
<p><strong>Gunman</strong>: Open it! Open it! GUNMAN: Open it!</p>
<p>(The GUNMAN opens the doors and walks inside the vault. He looks for a specific box. He puts down his bag and pulls out some explosives. He sticks it on the four corners of the bank box. The third explosive pack goes on the bottom right corner of box #748.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>

<p><strong>Woman</strong>: (hysterical) (b.g.) I have to get out of here!</p>
<p>(The GUNMAN turns to the other customers.)</p>
<p><strong>Gunman</strong>: Any one of you moves a muscle, I'll blow you away.</p>

[INT. FIRST MONUMENT BANK - VAULT - DAY -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(The GUNMAN inside the vault finishes putting on the explosives packs on the corners surrounding a particular box.)</p>
<p>(When finished, he grabs his bag and runs out of the vault. He kneels down just outside the glass doors and takes out a detonator. He pushes the buttons on the small black box.)</p>
<p>(Quick CGI to: The camera travels rapidly along the vault boxes toward The specific box and stops at the explosives pack on the bottom right corner where the red light on the receiver unit starts to blink and beep. End of CGI. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(It explodes.)</p>

<p>(JIMMY moves. His mom turns to get him. The GUNMAN sees the sudden movement. He turns and swings around and sees LOCKWOOD with his weapon out. The GUNMAN fires and hits LOCKWOOD. LOCKWOOD falls to the ground.)</p>
<p>(JIMMY'S MOM screams.)</p>
<p>(The GUNMAN from inside the vault runs out carrying his bag.</p>
<p><strong>Gunman</strong>: Got it! Go! Go! GUNMAN: Let's go!</p>

<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. FIRST MONUMENT BANK - DAY -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(The gunmen walk out of the building.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: The gunmen pass the FIRST MONUMENT BANK sign.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: The gunmen climb into the back of the white van.)</p>
<p><strong>Gunman</strong>: Go! Go! Go!</p>
<p>(The last GUNMAN closes the van's back doors after everyone is inside. The van speeds away.)</p>
<p>(As soon as the van turns the corner. Several police cars arrive in front of the building.)</p>
<p>(The officers exit the vehicles and set up a blockade of sorts in front of the bank. Their car doors are open, the officers are kneeling and pointing their weapons at the bank. In the background, we see the white van turn the corner and travel out of camera sight.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>

<p>(CATHERINE and GRISSOM walk into the bank. DAVID PHILLIPS is working on LOCKWOOD'S body. BRASS kneels down next to him.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: This crew was in and out. Three, maybe four guys, depending on who you talk to. Detective Lockwood drew his weapon protecting a woman and a child.</p>
<p>(BRASS picks up LOCKWOOD'S badge.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Wrong place, wrong time.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: There is no right time to kill a cop.</p>

<p>(CATHERINE notices and follows him. GRISSOM takes off his glasses.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Beveled edges on the inside. The shot came from outside. We need to get a picture of this.</p>

<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. FIRST MONUMENT BANK - VAULT -- DAY -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(BRASS leads GRISSOM and CATHERINE into the vault. The place is a mess. Electricity crackles and hisses.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: See the blast marks? Charges were placed in corner quadrants. Four boxes up, five across. The rest looks like collateral damage.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Whoever did this knew precisely what they were after.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, the one good thing about their precision ... it'll narrow our focus.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>

<p>(Cut to: The locked box in the center of the four explosive devices pops right out amidst other paper items. End of CGI. Resume to SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Four corners.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What does that tell us?</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, god.</p>

<p>(GRISSOM is working on the video from the security camera.)</p>
<p>(On tape, the time clock starts at ??:27:22 where the GUNMAN runs into the bank and heads straight for the security camera at full speed. There is no hesitation. He jumps up and smears black stuff on the lens with his hand. The clock ends on ??:32:03.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM sits in front of the video. WARRICK stands off to the side.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Lockwood was a good cop. It's too bad. (beat) Grissom, I just talked to Hodges. That black substance from the camera lens? The FTIR spit back magnesium aluminum, silicate, talc, methylparaben, and sunscreen. All of these chemicals are consistent with camouflage cream.</p>

<p>(Quick flashback to: One of the gunmen putting on black face paint. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>

<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: I wanted to. Every day I see people I don't know, but I saw a lot of Lockwood, and I did get to know him. I felt like I owed it to him.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And this Whiting guy worked here at the Rampart ... They're both your hotels .... How does that look for business?</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: Mugs, I got a P.R. Department that deals with that. When one white tiger killed another one in the secret garden at the Mirage, the P.R. Department had it buried on page 16e, under the car ads, about ... this big.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Right. They made it go away.</p>

<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Uh, yeah. The, uh ... blood flecks from the safe deposit box-- two distinct samples. I only got one hit, though. </p>
<p>(GREG picks ups the test results, his hands noticeably shaking. GRISSOM reaches into his pocket for his glasses.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Uh, the primary sample belongs to Vivian Verona, a cocktail waitress. She was killed on the top floor of the old pike's gambling hall about two years ago. Here's the report.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes the report and looks it over.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Multiple puncture wounds, different depths, possibly two knives ...</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I've pulled the crime scene photos for you, too. </p>
<p>(GREG hands GRISSOM the photos.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Case still pending. Murder weapon was never found. Now, the secondary blood sample came back N.D. Uh, could be the killer. You always say murder's messy.</p>
<p>(GREG holds the second test results in his hands.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Greg, your hands are shaking.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: No, they're not.</p>
<p>(Concerned, GRISSOM takes the paper from GREG.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hold your hands out.</p>
<p>(GREG holds his hands out flat in front of him, palms down. GRISSOM looks at them as they shake.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Uh ... they've been shaking ever since ... </p>
<p>(GREG glances up and points at the DNA LAB next door. GRISSOM looks up and sees what GREG is looking at.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I can't really make it stop.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Is it affecting your work?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (chuckles) Well, if I was a bomb expert, maybe. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM doesn't laugh.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: No, I ... I think I have it under control. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It'll stop. If you need me, I'll be around.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM leaves the lab. GREG looks down at his hands.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - EVIDENCE ROOM]</p>
<p>(Camera close up of one of the photographs. Its a picture of a celebration. In the photo, VIVIAN VERONA is wearing the rainbow-colored scarf and is standing in the front smiling. The banner behind the small group of people reads: &quot;$50,000 tip&quot;.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM studies the photo.)</p>
<p>(He picks up a second photo of the crime scene where VIVIAN VERONA is dead on the floor without her rainbow-colored scarf. He picks up a third photo.)</p>
<p>(WARRICK walks into the evidence room. He holds up the bagged scarf.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I have your scarf back from Sanders.</p>
<p>(He tosses the scarf onto the table. GRISSOM picks up the bag and compares it to the photo. It appears to be the same scarf.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM holds the evidence bag up to WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I need you to open this evidence bag and cut me an identical piece of fabric.</p>
<p>(WARRICK takes the bag.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You want me to replicate the blood pattern?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(WARRICK reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out a pair of scissors. He cuts the bag open. At that moment, GRISSOM glances up from the photos he's looking at and sees WARRICK cutting the bag with the pair of scissors.)</p>
<p>(He realizes something.)</p>
<p>(NICK appears in the doorway, his mouth full of apple.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You guys need a hand?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM sees NICK, then turns back to WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Warrick, hand me those scissors. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks up at NICK.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Nick, give me that apple.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (resistant) But I didn't get any lunch.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (firmly) Give me the apple. You're not supposed to eat in here.</p>
<p>(NICK hands GRISSOM the scissors. GRISSOM looks at the apple and scissors. He picks up a photograph of the wounds on VIVIAN VERONA. He holds it up for them to see.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Two puncture wounds, right?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes the scissors and puts it into the apple.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Scissors. That's what was wrapped in the scarf.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI -- LAB]</p>
<p>(Close up of the computer screen of the scarf. On screen, the computer works at reconstructing what was wrapped inside.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: These don't look like your ordinary household pair.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No, man, look at the blades. They're almost double the size of the handles.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What's the purpose of scissors that long?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Murder.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks into the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I hear scissors, I hear murder. What did I miss?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We may have the murder weapon.</p>
<p>(SARA walks into the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey, Vivian Verona worked for Sam Braun -- a cocktail waitress at Pike's Gambling Hall. Murdered the night before it was imploded in a penthouse suite.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Sounds like somebody wanted her to disappear in the rubble. Bet you Braun hired his own clean-up crew for that one.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The pyro guys found her on their last walk-through. They assigned a CSI, but the case ran cold before it even got started. There was no suspect and no motive.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM stares at the monitor.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Warrick, enhance the blade area.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hmm, let me see if I can flip it around so we're not looking at an eye chart.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: R-p-r-T.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (softly) Rampart.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns to look at CATHERINE.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - LOCKER ROOM]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM appears in the doorway. CATHERINE is putting her jacket on.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (muttering) He's not returning any m my phone calls. I just need to confront this Sam Braun business once and for all. I'll drive.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm not going with you.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE closes the locker door. GRISSOM steps into the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm scheduled for surgery at Desert Palm.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE stops and looks at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Surgery? </p>
<p>(GRISSOM doesn't say anything. CATHERINE walks toward him.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Your hearing?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (nods) Yep.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm not. Has to be done.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What can I do?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Nothing. I'm fine. Take care of the case.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, eh, mm ... that's it?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's it. Um ... (he thinks about it) ... good luck.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM leaves the room. CATHERINE stands there and shakes her head.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>

[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT -- HALLWAY]</p>
<p>SLOW MOTION</p>
<p>(OFFICERS escort ROBERT &quot;ROB&quot; RUBIO through the hallway. BRASS leads them to the Interview Room. Other OFFICERS stand along the hallway as they pass by.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(BRASS interviews ROBERT RUBIO who is handcuffed in his seat.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You must really like the ham steak at the Primm. One more mile north -- you're gone forever.</p>
<p><strong>Roberto Rubio</strong>: They got good ham.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: That's good to know. I'll know what to get you for your last meal ... for killing a cop. You know the rifle we found in your trunk? The bullets match one we pulled out of a friend of mine -- Detective Cyrus Lockwood.</p>
<p><strong>Roberto Rubio</strong>: Tough losing one of your own.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You lost three of yours. Ballistics made a match there, too.</p>
<p>(BRASS leans in, his hands flat on the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, you're ex-military. That why Sam Braun hired you to be head of security at the Rampart?</p>
<p><strong>Roberto Rubio</strong>: You asking me, or you telling me?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'm telling you. My guess is Sam needed a job done, he came to you.</p>
<p><strong>Roberto Rubio</strong>: You know, when I get out of here, I'm going to take pleasure in putting air in your head.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Let me put a fact in yours. You left a lot of yourself behind, killer.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: ROBERT RUBIO aims and fires three times. He picks up his bag and leaves. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, here's the deal. You give up your boss, you get to spend the rest of your life in a jail cell, not on death row.</p>
<p><strong>Rubio</strong>: I'll take death row. I'll live longer.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<hr />
[INT. HOTEL/CASINO - SAM BRAUN'S OFFICE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Camera pans across framed photographs hanging on the wall. CATHERINE stands near the wall looking at the photos. SAM BRAUN sits behind his desk looking at CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Tangiers, pike's gambling hall ... Where are the Rampart scissors, Sam?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE turns around and heads for the seat across SAM'S desk.)</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: I think they went to one of those silent auctions. You know, the kind where you put a number down and remain anonymous.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Uh-huh. I'm sure they went to a good cause. How much money they make?</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: More than I anticipated.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE takes a seat.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I think that we're past playing games, Sam. I need the truth.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: You sure about that?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, yeah. Now more than ever.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: Benny killed Vivian. He caught her cheating on him ... with me.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: BENNY MURDOCK walks into the room where he finds SAM BRAUN with VIVIAN VERONA. He gasps.)</p>
<p>(cc) VIVIAN VERONA: I can explain.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: When I heard he was dying, I went to see him. He told me he killed her with my scissors from a ribbon-cutting ceremony. He always kept the scissors-- had them shadow-boxed for me.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: VIVIAN VERONA is dead on the floor. BENNY MURDOCK stands over her with the bloodied pair of scissors in his hands. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: He stashed them in the safe deposit box.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Why would Benny ... do that? Why would Benny ... murder Vivian and then keep the incriminating evidence, not even attempt to wash off the blood?</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: You're asking me to answer on his behalf? I don't know. Maybe he was paranoid. Figured you would drag Lake Mead.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Let me just get this straight. To protect Benny after he's already dead, you hire Rob Rubio and three cronies to commit Federal Bank Robbery to steal back a pair of scissors?</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: They weren't just any pair of scissors ... they were tied to a legacy. If Benny goes down, I go down. Forty years ... building a reputation ... (he snaps his fingers) ... gone. Games are meant to be played downstairs not upstairs ... so I ask Rob to take care of it.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We have the safe deposit box in our possession, Sam, along with the bloodstained sash the scissors were wrapped in. We recovered two different blood samples -- one belonging to Vivian, and the other unknown. I guess I didn't have a good enough reason until now, but ... I tested my DNA against the unknown sample.</p>
<p>(She sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And wouldn't you know ... there were seven alleles in common.</p>
<p>(He leans forward and shakes his head.)</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: That supposed to mean something?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It means that you and I are biologically related. You killed her, Sam ... and Benny covered for you. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: SAM BRAUN walks into the hotel room and finds VIVIAN VERONA with BENNY MURDOCK. They both stand when they see SAM. SAM grabs the pair of scissors on the side table and walks toward them. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Part of the old double standard. No woman that you're with is ever going to be with another man.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: VIVIAN VERONA is dead on the floor. The camera moves up and shows SAM BRAUN holding a pair of bloodied scissors and standing over VIVIAN VERONA'S body. He leans over and takes VIVIAN VERONA'S blue scarf. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: I swear on your mother ... it didn't happen that way.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, now, that holds a lot of weight. To this day my mother still sits at home waiting for your call.</p>
<p>(He leans back in his chair.)</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: Do you really think I could murder someone?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Science ... tells me that you did. So, yes, I do. (Her voice breaks.) It's just such a lousy way to find out that you're my father.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />

[INT. DESERT PALM - EXAM ROOM -- EVENING]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM sits in his hospital gown on the examination table. The NURSE removes the blood pressure band from his arm.)</p>
<p><strong>Nurse</strong>: They're preparing the surgery right now, Mr. Grissom. I'll be right back.</p>
<p>(The NURSE leaves the room. GRISSOM waits. CATHERINE appears in the doorway.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns to look at her.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I just wanted to see you. And I didn't want you to go in without wishing you good luck.</p>
<p>(Behind CATHERINE, The transporter appears with the wheel chair for GRISSOM. GRISSOM stands up and walks up to CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Thank you ... for being here.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE reaches out and hugs GRISSOM. They look at each other.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to the transporter) I don't need that.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM heads down the hallway. CATHERINE turns to watch him leave. She smiles.)</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>

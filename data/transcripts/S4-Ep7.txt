<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. JUDGE BRENNER'S COURTROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(WARRICK is on the stand.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I searched the vehicle at the CSI garage. I discovered the knife under the passenger's seat.</p>
<p><strong>Prosecutor</strong>: Now, is this the knife you found?</p>
<p>(The PROSECUTOR hands the container with the knife to WARRICK. He looks at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yes, it is.</p>
<p><strong>Prosecutor</strong>: Hmm. Who was the registered owner of the vehicle?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Michael Fife, the defendant.</p>
<p>(They glance over at the Defense Table.)</p>
<p><strong>Prosecutor</strong>: Please describe the physical condition of the knife when you discovered it.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: The knife was wrapped in a white towel. Both the towel and the knife were caked with dried blood.</p>
<p><strong>Prosecutor</strong>: And how did you process this evidence?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I swabbed the blood and sent a sample to the DNA lab. The lab technician ran the sample through CODIS. The DNA sample was a match to a recent rape and homicide victim, Rachel Lyford.</p>
<p><strong>Prosecutor</strong>: Rachel Lyford who lived in unit seven of the Saturn Arms apartment complex. The same complex as the defendant?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: That's correct. </p>
<p><strong>Prosecutor</strong>: Is this knife consistent in size and shape to the fatal wounds sustained by Rachel Lyford?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yes, it is.</p>
<p><strong>Prosecutor</strong>: Thank you. Your honor, we have no further questions for CSI Brown.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Brenner</strong>: Mr. Matthews.</p>
<p>(The DEFENSE ATTORNEY stands and walks forward.)</p>
<p><strong>Defense Attorney Matthews</strong>: Mr. Brown, you stated that you found the knife in Mr. Fife's vehicle. Is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yes, that's correct.</p>
<p><strong>Defense Attorney Matthews</strong>: Why did you search his vehicle?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I received a call from Officer Watson. He informed me that he had pulled the defendant over to cite him for a broken taillight. After running his plates, it was discovered that the defendant had an outstanding warrant for drugs. He then arrested Mr. Fife and ordered a respond and tow. At which point, he asked me to search the vehicle for drugs. That's when I found the knife.</p>
<p><strong>Defense Attorney Matthews</strong>: Mm-hmm. At what point did you secure the warrant to search Mr. Fife's vehicle?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Officer Watson would have secured the warrant prior to calling me.</p>
<p><strong>Defense Attorney Matthews</strong>: Officer Watson never secured a warrant. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM and WARRICK both look alarmed at this development.)</p>
<p><strong>Defense Attorney Matthews</strong>: Did you?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Defense Attorney Matthews</strong>: Your honor, the knife is a product of an unlawful search, and under NRS Chapter 179, we submit the knife and the towel be ruled inadmissible. Furthermore, all evidence acquired as a result of the seizure must at this time be excluded.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Brenner</strong>: So ruled. Fruit of the poisonous tree. What else do you have?</p>
<p>(The PROSECUTOR gets to his feet.)</p>
<p><strong>Prosecutor</strong>: Additional evidence is pending. The knife would've been more than sufficient for the purpose of a prelim.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Brenner</strong>: You have no other evidence to present?</p>
<p><strong>Prosecutor</strong>: Not at this time. </p>
<p><strong>Judge Brenner</strong>: I find insufficient evidence to hold the defendant over for trial. He's free to go.</p>
<p><strong>Prosecutor</strong>: Your honor, the defendant is accused of raping and killing a 19-year-old woman. You can't just let him back on the street. </p>
<p><strong>Judge Brenner</strong>: Are you suggesting that I violate his constitutional rights, counselor?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM stands up and leans toward the PROSECUTOR.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (whispers) Ask him for 24 hours. </p>
<p><strong>Prosecutor</strong>: Your honor, we received no prior notice of this motion. Um ... we would ask for a continuance and opportunity to reopen.</p>
<p>(beat)</p>
<p><strong>Prosecutor</strong>: We're only asking for 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Brenner</strong>: Okay. If you can't make your case, Mr. Fife walks. We will recess for 24 hours.</p>
<p>(The JUDGE bangs his gavel and court is adjourned. WARRICK picks up the knife container off of the witness counter and heads toward GRISSOM.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The murder weapon's been excluded, that's all. We still have a lab full of evidence we can process.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We've been completely blind-sided here.</p>
<p>(OFFICER WATSON interrupts them.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer Watson</strong>: Brown, what is going on?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You got to be kidding me.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Watson</strong>: You were unprepared. All the evidence you CSIs collect, and all you bring into this courtroom is a knife? Come on.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I found the knife. I processed the knife. I presented the knife. All you had to do was the paperwork.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Watson</strong>: Yeah, blame it on the cop, huh? Look, you wouldn't even have a suspect if I didn't pull that guy over.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: If you'd've followed protocol, our suspect would be going to trial.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM holds up a hand to OFFICER WATSON.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: If you have a problem with CSI, file a complaint -- we're busy.</p>
<p>(OFFICER WATSON sighs and steps away. GRISSOM and WARRICK head out of the courtroom.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What about what you said about never rushing evidence?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, for the next 24 hours, we're breaking the rules.</p>
<p>(They walk out of camera frame.)</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - HALLWAY -- AFTERNOON] </p>
<p>CLOCK: 5:04 P.M.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and WARRICK walk through the hallway and meet up with SHERIFF RORY ATWATER.) </p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Rory Atwater</strong>: Grissom.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sheriff. We need to talk ... (waves a finger at WARRICK) ... about him.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Nice to finally meet you, too, Sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to WARRICK) Why don't you go ahead and start the briefing? I'll be in in a minute.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(WARRICK leaves.)</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Rory Atwater</strong>: Where to?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM shows THE SHERIFF to the office.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(WARRICK bangs his forehead in frustration against the locker door. Feeling the weight of the case on his shoulders, he takes a moment and sits there.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[GRISSOM'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(SHERIFF RORY ATWATER and GRISSOM walk into his office. GRISSOM heads for his desk while the SHERIFF looks at the things on the office shelves.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Warrick Brown followed protocol. You cannot pin this mess on him.</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Rory Atwater</strong>: Warrick Brown was on the stand. He's the face of the case. It's all about perception. If Fife walks, the public only hears one thing -- &quot;evidence against a killer was thrown out of court because CSI conducted an improper search.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You think I don't know that?</p>
<p>(The SHERRIF points to the pig fetus in a bottle on the shelf.)</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Rory Atwater</strong>: What the hell is this?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's irradiated fetal pig. I used the tissue to determine the effects of radiation ...</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Rory Atwater</strong>: (interrupts) Look, Grissom, you and your team have done exemplary work. </p>
<p>(He takes a seat at GRISSOM'S desk.)</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Rory Atwater</strong>: Thanks to the crime lab, some very difficult cases have gone our way. You've elevated the status of the whole bureau.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Uh-huh. Then why are you here?</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Rory Atwater</strong>: I'm holding a press conference in an hour where I'll be telling the media that this case is under your purview.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM chuckles.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Oh, it is about perception, isn't it?</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Rory Atwater</strong>: Glad we understand each other. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM nods.)</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Rory Atwater</strong>: Uh... why don't you call my office next week? (whispers)<br />
Put a little lunch on the books, hmm?</p>
<p>(The SHERIFF gets to his feet and heads for the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I work nights.</p>
<p>(The SHERIFF turns around to look at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Rory Atwater</strong>: So make it a dinner.</p>
<p>(The SHERIFF leaves the office.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - CONFERENCE ROOM -- EVENING] </p>
<p>CLOCK: 5:15 P.M. CLOCK: 5:16 P.M.</p>
<p>(WARRICK conducts the meeting.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Impound towed the vehicle to the garage. Michael Fife's outstanding warrant was for marijuana possession, so that's what I was looking for.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [INT. CSI - GARAGE] WARRICK searches the back seat of the car and finds the bloodied knife wrapped in the towel under the seat.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I swabbed the knife and I sent the blood sample to Greg.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I ran it through CODIS and matched it to another case.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: My case. Rachel Lyford, 19. Murdered in her apartment.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE hands out some papers to everyone.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [INT. SATURN ARMS APT] RACHEL LYFORD is dead on the bed.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The assistant coroner examined the body. Based on the vaginal introitus, he suspected rape. I processed the scene. There was nothing probative. There were no prints, no DNA. Everything I collected is in the vault.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Now, once Warrick found the knife, the D.A. thought there was sufficient probable cause and rushed the prelim.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks to the room and lingers in the doorway.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Further processing of the evidence became a low priority, pending the trial date.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This is a rush case. Everyone's in the pool for 24 hours. Warrick, you need to see Robbins. Have him walk you through his notes on the autopsy. Nick, Sara, the Judge issued a warrant for Fife's vehicle. Detail is towing it back to our garage.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hold on. Warrick's already searched the car and the knife's been excluded. What exactly are we hoping to find?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I don't know. But the knife and the towel are invisible evidence. The jury will never see them. So we have to find something that's visible.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Uh, listen, I recognize the importance of this, but I'm in the middle of my own homicide investigation.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'll talk to your detective. Explain the deal.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, it's not about the detective. It's about my own responsibility.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (firmly) I'm handing out assignments, Sara. It's not a negotiation.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'll go back to the scene and look at it with fresh eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Deadline's 4:00 P.M. Tomorrow. &quot;Once more into the breach.&quot;</p>

[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - AFTERNOON]</p>
<p>[EXT. CSI - GARAGE -- AFTERNOON] </p>
<p>CLOCK: 6:18 PM</p>
<p>(NICK and SARA wait for auto detail to bring the car. SARA leans against the wire fence, still perturbed by the meeting. NICK finishes his phone call and walks toward her.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: That was auto detail. There's a traffic jam on Flamingo. Tow truck should be here any second.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You know what pisses me off?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Lots of things.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (ignoring him) Victims aren't equal. High profile cases get priority.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: A ticking clock gets priority.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Every case is a ticking clock. The only difference between a cold case and a hot case is time. </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I don't care if you're working on the hottest case of your career. If your supervisor tells you to leave a scene to go wash his car, you do it. </p>
<p>(SARA looks at NICK. She can't believe what she just heard.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (clarifies) You don't have a career without a job.</p>
<p>(AUTO DETAIL arrives with the car. Or what's left of the car.) </p>
<p><strong>Auto Detail</strong>: Heard you're on a rush. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: That's not the right car, man.</p>
<p>(He checks his chart.) </p>
<p><strong>Auto Detail</strong>: Uh, registered owner Michael Fife, BMW 325. Impounded ten days ago.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What the hell happened?</p>
<p><strong>Auto Detail</strong>: It's been pancaked.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: We can see that. Why?</p>
<p><strong>Auto Detail</strong>: Hey, I just move 'em.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: This is evidence in an active investigation. </p>
<p><strong>Auto Detail</strong>: Paperwork mix-up?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Or some moron checked the wrong box. You can just unload it here.</p>
<p><strong>Auto Detail</strong>: Sign here. I got to get back to the lot.</p>
<p>(SARA signs the paper and hands it back to AUTO DETAIL.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY] </p>
<p>(ROBBINS goes over the autopsy photographs with WARRICK.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Body was released last week. Cremated at Desert Haven. I.D.'d by the sister, pretty girl. Couldn't stop crying.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, Rita. They were real close. Lived together up until a couple months ago. These stab wounds look like they're limited to the neck and upper torso area, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Fatal stab was to the left side of the neck.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [INT. SATURN ARMS APTS] RACHEL LYFORD fights as she gets stabbed.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (V.O.) The blade traversed the subcutaneous tissue,<br />
(Quick CGI POV to: The knife cuts through her flesh. Close up of the knife sinking in through muscle and blood. Nice squishy sound effects for added viewing pleasure.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (V.O.) ... sternocleido-mastoid muscle, jugular venous complex,<br />
(End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: ... the carotid artery and the vagus nerve. She bled right out. Raped. No semen in the vaginal vault. I don't know if it's relevant, but check out the abrasion. There was something around her neck.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Noted. What is this foreign substance on her wrist?</p>
<p>(WARRICK points to something in the photo.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Pre-autopsy. David snapped the photo before he washed her body. He's in clean up.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY] </p>
<p>(WARRICK walks into the room. DAVID PHILLIPS is at the stove boiling something in a large pot.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Bringing your laundry to work again, David?</p>
<p>(He lifts up the heavy bone and shows it to WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: I'm cleaning a pelvis.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Great. I'm here about one Rachel Lyford. You prepped her body?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Yeah, ten days ago. I thought it was Catherine's case.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It's mine now. You notice this foreign substance on her wrists?</p>
<p>(WARRICK shows the photograph to DAVID and points to the substance.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: It was flaky. Like the glaze on a doughnut? I sent a sample to trace.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Trace. Thanks. You're the man. Have fun.</p>
<p>(WARRICK leaves the room.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - TRACE LAB -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>CLOCK: 7:13 P.M.</p>
<p>(WARRICK walks into trace, but before he can say anything, DAVID HODGES answers his question as he looks through the scope. He doesn't even lift his head up.) </p>
<p><strong>David Hodges</strong>: Sample's still running through the GCMS. I'll let you know.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: How'd you know that I was...</p>
<p>(HODGES looks at WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>David Hodges</strong>: (interrupts) 4-1-1 from David. (drawls) Hey, I heard about court today. Must have been embarrassing, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hodges, why'd you leave L.A. Again? Never mind, it's probably none of my business.</p>
<p>(WARRICK leaves trace and walks out into the hallway.)</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - HALLWAY - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(BRASS calls out to WARRICK.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hey, Rick, you okay? 'Cause I'm here to drop some more pressure on you.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p>(They both continue down the hallway.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Rachel Lyford's sister showed up at the police station. Man, she was angry. She was firing on all cylinders.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I don't blame her.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Apparently, Rachel wore a silver chain around her neck. It wasn't with her personal effects. (WARRICK flips through the file folder in his hand.) Had her father's army dog tags on it and the family wants it back.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You came all the way over here for dog tags?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well ... the Sheriff asked me to find it. You know, Rory Atwater's been in office for - what? -- Four months, so it's political. He doesn't want the victim's sister bad-mouthing his department.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Mm-hmm. Check it out.</p>
<p>(WARRICK shows BRASS the photo of the abrasions on RACHEL LYFORD'S neck.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Dr. Robbins found consistent abrasions on the back of her neck, so ... that's probably your chain.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Uh-huh. Okay. Killer took a souvenir. I'll let the Sheriff know. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: All right.</p>
<p>(BRASS turns back; WARRICK moves forward through the hallway.)</p>

<p>(GRISSOM dusts a beer bottle. WARRICK enters the room.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What do you got?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Got a print off this bottle I found in the garbage. It was the only bottle like it. None others in the apartment.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Need a hand?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You could do the sheets.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Done.</p>
<p>(WARRICK grabs a set of gloves to put on as GRISSOM tapes the print. WARRICK looks at the knives on the table.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You know, the steak knife I found in that car matches that set.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We only found five knives in Rachel's kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Five's an odd number of steak knives.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Exactly. Weapon of opportunity, perhaps?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Perhaps.</p>
<p>(WARRICK glances up at the clock: It's 7:49 PM. He turns to work on the sheets.) </p>
<p>(WARRICK spreads the sheet out on the table and sees something smudged in with the blood. He picks up a magnifying glass to look at it.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Grissom, what do you make of this? We noted a similar type substance on the girl's wrists.</p>
<p>(He hands the glass to GRISSOM to look at.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Doesn't look like it belongs on the victim or her sheets.</p>
<p>(WARRICK glances up at the clock again. This time, GRISSOM notices the movement. It's still 7:49 P.M.) </p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns to look at WARRICK.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Stop it.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Watching the clock.</p>
<p>(WARRICK takes a swab sample of the substance on the sheet.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (frustrated) It's just that new evidence is coming in and the old evidence hasn't even been processed yet. We're running out of time here, you know?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: If you're watching the clock, you're not watching the case.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, not even you can stop time.</p>

<p><strong>Michael Fife</strong>: I want to hear what they have to say.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Several hours ago, we found blood-stained threads in the back of your client's car. DNA ran the blood. It is consistent with Rachel Lyford's. It is admissible into evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Now, what do you have to say?</p>
<p><strong>Michael Fife</strong>: I don't know anything about any threads.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: How well did you know the victim? That's an easy one.</p>

<p><strong>Defense Attorney Matthews</strong>: You don't have to submit to this, Michael. Just say the word.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Fife</strong>: No, I got this one. The night before Rachel was killed, there was a party in the courtyard ...</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You might want to control your temper, Mike. It can get you in a lot of trouble.</p>
<p><strong>Defense Attorney Matthews</strong>: Detective Brass, if you were to make your case, we'd be back in court, not an interrogation room.

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Fife still could have raped and murdered Rachel.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, the toilet bowl was clean. The semen belongs to whoever flushed the toilet last, but there was a drop, not a smear.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Look, we have no evidence that he raped her, no evidence that he killed her, and even if we consider the invisible evidence, it still doesn't give us enough to put him at the scene of the crime during the commission of the crime.

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Except, if we ask him, we show our cards, and his lawyer will know that we're looking in another direction.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, then he'll petition Judge Brenner for fife's immediate release.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How do you feel about letting him walk?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We've got, what, less than seven hours. Let's not pull any punches. If the evidence is leading us away from Fife, I say we go with it.</p>
<p>(Camera holds on WARRICK.)</p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>CLOCK: 10:11 AM</p>
<p>(BRASS is re-interviewing FIFE with his attorney MATTHEWS present. WARRICK sits in the back listening.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Let's establish a sequence of events. Walk us through the night of the party at your apartment complex right up until your arrest the next day. Don't skip a beat. </p>
<p><strong>Michael Fife</strong>: Devil's in the details, huh?</p>
<p>(BRASS shrugs.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Could be.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Fife</strong>: (sighs) I hung out until about midnight. Drank my six pack. Hit on a couple girls. Struck out. Went back to my apartment, passed out. In the morning, I drove up to Green Valley and installed a chandelier, two sconces. At noon, I went back to my apartment, and I made a tuna fish sandwich. Lettuce, tomato, spoon of relish. Wheat bread. Then ... I took a leak. I don't want to skip a beat.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Outstanding.</p>
<p>[OBSERVATION ROOM]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and CATHERINE watch the interview.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (through speaker) So, then what?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, I liked your tough act yesterday.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: &quot;I hand out the assignments. This isn't a negotiation.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What, too much?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (shakes her head) Not enough.</p>
<p>[INTERVIEW ROOM]</p>
<p><strong>Michael Fife</strong>: That afternoon, I had a job in Henderson. On my way, I stopped, uh, at a car wash. It was a lunch-hour discount.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What car wash?</p>
<p><strong>Michael Fife</strong>: Reliant, on Chardon Circle. It's about a block from my apartment.</p>
<p><strong>Defense Attorney Matthews</strong>: Why are you asking about a car wash?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: At Reliant, did the attendant say anything about your broken taillight?</p>
<p><strong>Michael Fife</strong>: No. Yeah, in fact, I mean, they should've said something.</p>
<p>[OBSERVATION ROOM]</p>
<p><strong>Defense Attorney Matthews</strong>: (through speaker) The tenor of these questions leads me to believe the focus of your investigation has shifted. This conversation is over, Michael.</p>
<p>(Hold on CATHERINE and GRISSOM.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. RELIANT CAR WASH -- DAY] </p>
<p>(WARRICK and CATHERINE speak with the MANAGER.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I just talked to the manager. Of course, he didn't recognize Fife from the six pack of photos. We're still cleared to look around.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: By bringing your car to a car wash, you pretty much open it up into the entire world, right? Vehicles are most vulnerable down that tunnel. So, I'm thinking that Michael Fife's taillight was intact when he arrived.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'm sure the attendant would have told him something. They're liable, right?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Exactly. So, his car proceeds on down the line, and then inside the tunnel, someone, presumably our killer, stashes the knife, breaks the taillight.</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Busted taillight's an equipment violation. NRS 485.511.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, you'd get pulled over for that pretty quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Right. And the killer is banking on some ambitious cop searching the vehicle. Okay, so, a broken taillight. The pieces fall into the water.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: The fragments have to run off through some kind of drain, right?</p>
<p>(WARRICK and CATHERINE approach the CAR WASH MANAGER.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Uh, excuse me, sir. A-are you the manager?</p>
<p><strong>Car Wash Manager</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Does your drain have a filter?</p>
<p><strong>Car Wash Manager</strong>: There's a screen trap behind the drain. Catches everything bigger than an ice cream sprinkle.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, when was the last time you had it cleaned?</p>
<p><strong>Car Wash Manager</strong>: About a month ago. Why?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm going to have to clean your traps.</p>
<p><strong>Car Wash Manager</strong>: (chuckles) Sorry, lady. Can't just close down the shop. I got customers.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I understand, sir, but you know, just let us shut you down for about an hour or so. Otherwise, we can get a search warrant, come back on Saturday, your busiest day, and, well ... it's up to you.</p>
<p><strong>Car Wash Manager</strong>: Soon as that Porsche Cayenne works its way through the line ... I'll shut her off.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The crime lab thanks you for your cooperation, sir.</p>
<p><strong>Car Wash Manager</strong>: You're welcome.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: All right, sassy.</p>
<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO:<br />
[INT. RELIANT CAR WASH -- DAY] </p>
<p>(CATHERINE and WARRICK check the filter and find the pieces of the tail light.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Look what I found. </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: A broken taillight.</p>
<p>(WARRICK looks up at the CAR WASH MANAGER.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey, could two cars get too close to each other and have an accident in here?</p>
<p><strong>Car Wash Manager</strong>: There's no way. Photocell technology. Whole system shuts down if the cars get within three feet of each other. Believe me, in this tunnel, accidents do not happen.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Which means the taillight was broken on purpose.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The car goes through the tunnel and someone breaks the tail light. Cut to: The pieces of the tail light fall through the drain.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - WAITING ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(BRASS speaks with the car wash workers who are there to submit DNA samples. WARRICK and CATHERINE put their gloves on.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Okay, uh, thank you, thanks for coming down here and volunteering to give a DNA sample. We know you work hard, so, in an effort to be nice, we've provided some lunch, some burgers and stuff, compliments of the Las Vegas police department. Okay, let's form two lines now. Everybody whose birthday is from January to June in this line, everybody else over here. </p>
<p><strong>Car Wash Manager</strong>: How long is this crap going to take?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: As long as it takes, okay? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: All right, you guys, I'm going to be swabbing your left cheek, so, uh ... try not to bite down.</p>
<p><strong>Quinn</strong>: Uh, ma'am, I got to take a leak.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, you just hold on there. It's only going to take a second. Open.</p>
<p>(Various cuts of CATHERINE and WARRICK taking DNA swab samples.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE takes a swab sample from QUINN, the worker who asked to use the bathroom. From the back, we can see that he's wearing a chain around his neck.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Uh, Akers, do me a favor and escort this guy to the john.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Akers</strong>: Let's go.</p>
<p>(QUINN moves past WARRICK. WARRICK notices the chain around his neck as he walks out of the waiting room.)</p>
<p><strong>Quinn</strong>: (V.O.) You guys are making a big mistake. </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and WARRICK interviews QUINN in the presence of his LAWYER, MARGARET FINN.)</p>
<p><strong>Quinn</strong>: ... I don't know a Rachel Lyford, I swear.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Really? Well, I swear that you do. I found semen on the toilet in Rachel's apartment that matches your DNA</p>
<p><strong>Margaret Finn (lawyer)</strong>: You don't have to respond, but if you can explain the semen ...</p>
<p><strong>Quinn</strong>: I know a Rachel, okay? I never knew her last name. Did the girl that you guys are looking for live at the Saturn Arms Apartments?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, you do know her.</p>
<p><strong>Quinn</strong>: I ... here's the deal, okay? A car wax costs sixty bucks, okay? We give you discounts sometimes. I' show up early and, you know, I'll go to a girl's apartment before work, or whatever, you know, and all the guys do this. </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (interrupts) So, Rachel hired you to wax her car, is that it?</p>
<p><strong>Quinn</strong>: I only charged her 25.</p>
<p>(He chuckles.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [INT. SATURN ARMS APT.] RACHEL LYFORD opens the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Rachel Lyford</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>Quinn</strong>: Shiny as a new penny.</p>
<p>(She holds up the money and invites him in. He laughs and enters the apartment.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: And your story is that Rachel came on to you?</p>
<p><strong>Quinn</strong>: Yeah. She was all over me. She answered the door in, like, this sexy little thing, and stuff. Most of the time, when a woman answers the door, it's in sweats, they got the money ready. This was not like that.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE leans forward.)</p>
<p><strong>Quinn</strong>: (laughs) What am I supposed to think?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I don't think so.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [INT. SATURN ARMS APT] RACHEL LYFORD opens the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Quinn</strong>: Hey, I'm all done.</p>
<p><strong>Rachel Lyford</strong>: Uh, hold on a second. </p>
<p>(She turns to get the money to pay him. As she gets the money, he stands there and looks at her. She glances nervously at him, then shoves the money toward him.)</p>
<p><strong>Rachel Lyford</strong>: Okay, here you go.</p>
<p>(She tries to close the door, but he stops her, forcing his way into the apartment. She screams and struggles as he pushes her inside.)</p>
<p><strong>Rachel Lyford</strong>: Stop it! Stop it!</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: After raping her, you realized she had your name, knew where you worked. One call to the cops and you're looking at 25 to life.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: RACHEL LYFORD is crying on the bed. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You freaked. So, you killed her.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: QUINN opens the knife drawer and takes out a knife. He shuts the drawer and goes back to the bed. RACHEL turns around and starts fighting for her life. End of flashback. Resume to QUINN.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: After he kills her, the wraps the bloody knife in a towel. He takes his things and leaves. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Forget life; you're looking at the death penalty.</p>
<p><strong>Quinn</strong>: Lady, you are whacked.</p>
<p><strong>Margaret Finn (lawyer)</strong>: You didn't find the murder weapon in my client's car.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Your client went from Rachel's apartment to his job at the car wash. He took the knife with him. A few hours later, Michael Fife drove in, and he planted the knife in his car.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [INT. RELIANT CAR WASH] QUINN breaks the tail light, the pieces fall down the drain. He opens the back door, lifts up his shirt and plants the knife and towel under the chair. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Margaret Finn (lawyer)</strong>: He just happened to hide the murder weapon in a car that belonged to one of Rachel's neighbors?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It wasn't a coincidence. It was your lucky day. You recognized the parking permit in his car window.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The parking permit in the car window. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You broke the taillight, you stashed the knife. Instant suspect.</p>
<p>(WARRICK holds up the dog tags.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You recognize these?</p>
<p>(He puts the dog tags on the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: The name on the dog tags is Aaron Lyford. That's Rachel's father.</p>
<p><strong>Quinn</strong>: She gave them to me.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: She gave them to you.</p>
<p>(beat) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Why did you try to hide them?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [EARLIER] QUINN goes to the bathroom and as he passes him, WARRICK notices the chain on the back of his neck.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (V.O.) Why did you take off to the bathroom with the dog tags on? And you came back with them missing. </p>
<p>(Cut to: WARRICK goes into the men's room to check the bathroom stalls.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (V.O.) So, I checked it out.</p>
<p>(He checks the trash and the stalls. In one of the bowls, the finds the dog tags.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: This is an autopsy photo.</p>
<p>(WARRICK puts the photo on the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: The abrasions are evidence. Those dog tags were ripped from her neck.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: QUINN rips the dog tags from RACHEL'S body. He looks at them and leaves. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: She gave them to you ... over her dead body.</p>
<p>(Camera holds on QUINN.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. JUDGE BRENNER'S COURT -- DAY] </p>
<p>(WARRICK is on the witness stand. It's a different court; different defendant.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: The defendant arrived at the station on his own accord. He provided us with a sample of his DNA, and we rushed that sample to our lab for analysis.</p>
<p><strong>Prosecutor</strong>: You compared Mr. Quinn's DNA to DNA from semen recovered at the crime scene, is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yes, that's correct. It was a match.</p>
<p><strong>Prosecutor</strong>: Judge, we have no further questions.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Brenner</strong>: Ms. Finn?</p>
<p>(DEFENSE ATTORNEY MARGARET FINN gets to her feet.)</p>
<p><strong>Margaret Finn (lawyer)</strong>: Your honor, we have no questions for CSI Brown.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Brenner</strong>: Based on the evidence, I find sufficient probable cause to order the defendant to stand trial for the sexual assault and murder of Rachel Lyford.</p>
<p>(The gavel sounds. Court is adjourned. Everyone stands up as. WARRICK steps down from the witness stand and heads over to the LYFORDS.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'm terribly sorry for your loss. And your father's tags are in a safe place. I'll make sure they get back to you.</p>
<p><strong>Rita Lyford</strong>: Thank you for everything.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You're more than welcome.</p>
<p>(WARRICK turns to leave when SHERIFF RORY ATWATER walks into the courtroom.)</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Rory Atwater</strong>: Hey, sorry I'm late.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, I think you're right on time. There must be a press conference nearby, huh?</p>
<p>(SHERIFF RORY ATWATER chuckles.)</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Rory Atwater</strong>: I wanted to include CSI Brown in this. There might be a few questions outside my ... </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: ... purview?</p>
<p>(The SHERIFF turns around and heads for the front.)</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Rory Atwater</strong>: Want to meet me out in the corridor ASAP?</p>
<p>(WARRICK tries to get out of it.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Sheriff, I'm not too good with cameras.</p>
<p>(He turns to look at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You won't have to talk much.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Grissom, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: For what? </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (nods) See you back at the lab.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM watches as WARRICK leaves the courtroom.)</p>
<p>(Camera holds on GRISSOM, smiling.)</p>
<p>FADE TO WHITE.</p>

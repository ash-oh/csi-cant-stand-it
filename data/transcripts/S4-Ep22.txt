<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Sirens wail in the distance.) </p>
<p>[INT. UNKNOWN PLACE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(ERNIE MENLO sits in the chair in the center of the darkened room. In front of him stands two men - one holding a bright light on him, the other interrogates him.)</p>
<p><strong>Interrogator</strong>: I'm going to make this really simple. Who are you working with?</p>
<p><strong>Ernie Menlo</strong>: I'm, uh, unemployed at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>Interrogator</strong>: You got any idea what we did to chumps like you back in the day?</p>
<p><strong>Ernie Menlo</strong>: (swallows and tugs at his collar) Uh, no. Look, could you put the A.C. on in here or somethin'? That, or just, uh, let me go. I mean, you can't keep me in here. It's against the law.</p>
<p><strong>Interrogator</strong>: There's no law in this room.</p>
<p>(He looks at both his interrogators.)</p>
<p><strong>Ernie Menlo</strong>: (scared) You can't touch me.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. NEON GRAVEYARD -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Camera swoops down to show ERNIE MENLO'S dead body at the base of the &quot;W&quot; in the WHISKEYTOWN letter sign.) </p>
<p>[EXT. NEON GRAVEYARD - NIGHT - LATER]</p>
<p>(BRASS, GRISSOM and CATHERINE stand around the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Two shots to the back of the head. Double tap.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM shines his flashlight on the wound at the back of the victim's neck.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He's wearing a wig and a fat suit. It's not Halloween, is it?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: In this town, it's always Halloween.</p>
<p>(BRASS picks up the NEVADA DRIVER'S LICENSE. It reads: </p>
<p>MENLO, ERNIE<br />
2974 WESTFALL AVE<br />
LAS VEGAS, NV</p>
<p>LIC# 64836483749<br />
EXPIRES: 06-29-2009</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: &quot;Ernie Menlo.&quot; (BRASS waves a bill in the air.) Well, he wasn't carrying a very &quot;fat&quot; wad.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Rolex is still on his wrist. Probably rules out robbery. (She looks at GRISSOM.) What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I don't know. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns around and looks at the various signs abandoned and thrown away littering the area.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm looking for a sign.</p>
<p>CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. NEON GRAVEYARD -- DAY] </p>
<p>(CATHERINE is on the phone. A distance away behind her, GRISSOM is with DAVID PHILLIPS near the victim's body at the base of the &quot;W&quot;.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to phone) He's not in the system? (pause) Yeah ... gotta be.<br />
(pause) Okay. Thanks.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE hangs up the phone and turns to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, uh ... Brass ran the ID. There's no &quot;Ernie Menlo&quot; in the system. Fake.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: GSR in the wound track. No stellate tearing. Gunshots appear to be close range, but non-contact.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM bags the wig.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: No exit wounds.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks around the area.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, I don't see any shell casings either. So maybe the killer picked them up.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (shrugs) Professional hit?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE nods, then steps away a bit and looks at the ground.)</p>
<p>(DAVID picks up the victim's hand to show the lacerations on his knuckles.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Major fractures and lacerations on his hands. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Lividity's consistent with body position. I don't think it was a body dump.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So either he walked in or he got a ride. Either way, this gravel and glass makes good evidence.</p>
<p>(She indicates the fragments on the ground.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'll go ahead and bag a sample.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE takes the camera and walks away to look around the area.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM opens an evidence bag.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks a distance further and lifts the camera to snap more photos of the tire tracks in the dirt.) </p>
<p>(She stands near the HORSESHOE sign and looks out at the tire tracks of a vehicle that turned around by backing up.)</p>
<p>(As she stands there, she envisions the vehicle backing up, shifting gears, then driving off. The vision ends.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE takes out a tape measure and measures the tire marks. GRISSOM checks the victim's shirt pocket and finds a receipt folded inside. He opens it and reads it: </p>
<p># 3232<br />
RAMPART CASINO<br />
221 NORTH RAMPART BLVD.<br />
LAS VEGAS, NV 89145</p>
<p>Federal Identification Number: 88-0513636</p>
<p>WINNER'S Name: ERNIE MENLO<br />
2974 WESTFALL AVE<br />
LAS VEGAS, NV 89156</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: &quot;Rampart Casino.&quot; Well, his day started out good. He won $436,278. </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Rampart's always been lucky for me.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So where is this money?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns and walks away from DAVID PHILLIPS.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE finishes measuring the tread markings on the ground. She closes the tape measure. GRISSOM walks up to her.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I found some tire treads. I think the vehicle was making a three-point turn.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And it seems that robbery may be a motive after all.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE takes off her sunglasses as she looks at the receipt in GRISSOM'S hand.)</p>
<p>1 Gross Winnings: $436,278.00<br />
3 Type of wager: Roulette<br />
5 Transaction: 79362</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Wow!</p>
<p>(She notes the other information:<br />
PAYER'S name, Street address, City, state<br />
RAMPART CASINO<br />
221 NORTH RAMPART BLVD<br />
LAS VEGAS, NV 89145</p>
<p>Federal identification number: 88-0513636</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: &quot;Rampart.&quot; Guess I'll go check that out.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You can't. We found the body under the WHISKEY TOWN sign and the guy just cleaned out the Rampart Casino.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Coincidence.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Even if it is, they're still Sam Braun's casinos.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Why is that a problem?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He's your father. You can't be on this case.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Gil ... </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Catherine, you have to go home.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE hands GRISSOM the tape measure and the camera. She turns and leaves.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) -- DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- DAY]</p>
<p>(SARA, WARRICK and DAVID PHILLIP work on the victim's body.)</p>
<p>(Camera view down on ERNIE MENLO'S body on the autopsy table. He's still in the fat suit.)</p>
<p>(SARA picks up something off of his forehead and puts it in a clean envelope.)</p>
<p>(DAVID PHILLIPS puts the victim's clothes in a package. WARRICK works on the victim's lacerated hand. SARA removes the rolex watch. She looks at it. It's<br />
9:41 am.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No ticks. It's authentic.</p>
<p>(She flips the watch over and looks at the back.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Logo sticker isn't worn down. Watch could be new.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Guy hits the jackpot, has to celebrate. Goes and buys some bling-bling to impress the strippers with.</p>
<p>(DAVID lifts up the body's foot and sees the holes in the sock's heels.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What have you got?</p>
<p>(WARRICK and SARA both look at the feet.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Air conditioned socks.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p><strong>Lyric</strong>: ... I can hear the sound of violins </p>
<p>[INT. RAMPART CASINO - MAIN FLOOR - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The floor is crowded as people play at the tables.)</p>
<p><strong>Croupier</strong>: Insurance?</p>
<p><strong>Lyric</strong>: Long before it begins ... dealer wins.</p>
<p><strong>Croupier</strong>: Craps.</p>
<p>(The players sitting around the table groan.)</p>
<p><strong>Croupier</strong>: Seven!</p>
<p>(The players groan.)</p>
<p>(The roulette wheel turns</p>
<p><strong>Croupier</strong>: Twenty-four is even.</p>
<p>(The game ends and the players stand for the next people.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM stands in the middle of the main floor and looks around the room. He notes the cameras high up in the ceiling. BRASS walks up to him.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, I talked to the pit boss who signed the vic's W-2. He was pulling surveillance. He remembers the big winner.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM doesn't say anything. SAM BRAUN makes his way through the crowd toward GRISSOM and BRASS.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Sam Braun! What a surprise!</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: The fat kid ... he was cheating.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What do you do about it?</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: Well, we had a little chat. I didn't kill him.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did you take him to the box?</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: Gentlemen, these days, we call it &quot;The Holding Room&quot;.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. RAMPART CASINO - HOLDING ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(The door to the holding room opens. SAM BRAUN flicks the lights on and GRISSOM walks in. He looks around.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Smells like the cleaning crew just left.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM sets his kit down on the floor.)</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: Security brought the kid down here around 2:00 A.M. I came in. We talked. He walked out around three.</p>
<p>[SECURITY CAMERA VIEW]</p>
<p>(SAM BRAUN walks over to the camera as GRISSOM stands up. The camera reads:<br />
05-13-04 1:32 pm. SAM BRAUN points to the camera.)</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: It's all in there.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, good. We'll look at the tapes a little later.</p>
<p>[RESUME VIEW: HOLDING ROOM]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM points to the light switch.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Would you turn off the lights, please?</p>
<p>(SAM BRAUN turns around and flicks the lights off.)</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: It's well within my rights to have a discussion with anyone in my place. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM uses the ALS on the walls.)</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: The kid was cheating. I wanted to know how.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [HOLDING ROOM] SAM BRAUN talks with ERNIE MENLO.)</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: Nobody wins 400k at roulette. What's your system?</p>
<p><strong>Ernie Menlo</strong>: Clean living... good karma. But either you call the cops and book me now, or I'm out of here.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: You're no longer welcome at the Rampart.</p>
<p><strong>Ernie Menlo</strong>: Awesome. Okay, I'll take my money and go.</p>
<p>(ERNIE stands up to leave.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM continues to ALS the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: Do you have any idea the house advantage in roulette? </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Five point two six percent. Albert Einstein had a theory about roulette. He said the only way to win at roulette is to steal the money from the table when the croupier isn't looking.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: There's always someone looking.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM kneels down to look under the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, maybe it was an inside job, Sam. Maybe somebody bought off one of your guys.</p>
<p>(SAM smiles as he reads GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: I'm curious. What bothers you more? The fact that you couldn't pin a murder on me or that Catherine cashed my check?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM stops what he's doing and slowly stands up to look at SAM BRAUN.)</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: There were no strings on that money.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes off his glasses.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Just because you can't see something doesn't mean it's not there.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: (shrugs) Believe whatever you like. That kid walked out of here with my money. If you figure out how he ripped me off, would you let me know?</p>
<p>(SAM turns and leaves the room; GRISSOM watches him leave.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY] </p>
<p>(ROBBINS examines ERNIE MENLO'S feet as WARRICK watches.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: For what it's worth, these bruises correspond to the holes in his sock.</p>
<p>(ROBBINS walks around the body toward the head-side of the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, he's been worked over pretty good. He's got a nice fat lip.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Yeah. (ROBBINS reaches out and pulls the lower lip out to look inside.) There was a good clot in the wound, and the tissues were contused. I'd say it occurred at least an hour or two before death. I teased out a couple of small-caliber projectiles from his brain.</p>
<p>(He holds out the bullets. He gives them to WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: One was embedded in the right frontal cortex. The other lodged in the first cervical vertebra.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It's copper-washed lead. Must be a .22.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: You know, historically, .22s were the hit man's bullet of choice.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV: The gun shot sounds and the bullet hits the brain and swishes around inside.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (V.O.) They have the energy to enter into the cranial vault, but not enough to exit, so they just ricochet around inside, shredding the gray matter until they stop.</p>
<p>(End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: There's also extensive crush injury to both hands, with fractures of the metacarpals and the phalanges.</p>
<p>(ROBBINS picks up the body's wrist to show WARRICK the knuckles.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Bruises appear perimortem.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Any idea what might have caused that kind of damage?</p>
<p>(ROBBINS indicates the x-rays up on the view box behind WARRICK who turns around to look at them.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Given the fracture pattern, I'd guess it was some sort of blunt object. </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Maybe a ball peen hammer.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: What gets you to that?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: They used to tell me back in the days, the first time you got caught cheating, they'd give you a couple whacks on the hand with a ball peen hammer.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Ow.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: The second time, you'd lose a limb.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Third time?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: A long walk in the desert with a shovel.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI -- LAB] </p>
<p>(WARRICK takes out the victim's shoes from the package to look at them. On the underside of the shoe, he finds pieces of color glass shards embedded in the rubber.) </p>
<p>(He looks inside the shoe and finds an elaborate series of buttons and electronic switches. Camera zooms in to give us a nice view of the electronics. It ends on the Energizer battery inside the shoe.)</p>
<p>(WARRICK pulls the slip in out of the shoe.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI -- STAIRS] </p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks down the stairs as WARRICK fills him in.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: A computer in his shoe.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: As far as I could tell, it's a wireless receiver. It picks up a signal, solenoids drive the points up against the guy's foot, tells him what number to bet.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Based on what?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I don't know. Archie's working on it right now.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, if our vic was the receiver, there has to be a transmitter.</p>
<p>(SARA steps out of the lounge and joins them.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey, I got an ID on our vic. (She looks down at the papers in her hands.) A Teddy Keller. Everyone who buys a rolex gets registered at the point of purchase. So I ran the serial number. He bought the watch at the forum shops two days ago. And I got his home address.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, his driver's license was fake, so, this could be fake, too.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: A fake ID is for scamming a casino. A baller puts his real name on a roley. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns and gives SARA a look, surprised by what he just heard. She shrugs it off and waves the papers in her hand toward WARRICK.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What? He rubs off.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. KELLER'S APARTMENTS - POOLSIDE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(MR. GREEN, the landlord, shows BRASS and WARRICK to the apartment.) </p>
<p><strong>Joseph Greene (landlord)</strong>: Teddy Deller. That's apartment 27. Is he in some kind of trouble? Hey, John.</p>
<p>(He greets the MAN walking by off screen.)</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: (o.s.) Hey, Mr. Green.</p>
<p>(They continue walking.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: When was the last time you saw him?</p>
<p><strong>Joseph Greene (landlord)</strong>: I don't know. He's got a roommate -- Davis Mullins. Oh, yeah, they eat a tremendous amount of pizza. (They start up the stairs.)<br />
Tremendous amount of pizza and calzone. I feel like bopping that delivery guy every time he buzzes the gate.</p>
<p>(They reach the apartment door at the top of the stairs.)</p>
<p><strong>Joseph Greene (landlord)</strong>: Here we are.</p>
<p>(He knocks on the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Joseph Greene (landlord)</strong>: Anybody home?</p>
<p>(There's no answer. He knocks again.)</p>
<p><strong>Joseph Greene (landlord)</strong>: Hello?</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Get a load of this wheel. It's regulation. These things run about 1,500 bucks.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, they cleared almost half a mil. It's a good investment.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(BRASS turns to look at the rest of the apartment. WARRICK notes the various colored and numbered charts hanging on the wall.)</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Two taps to the head. Deja vu.</p>
<p>(DAVID PHILLIPS continues to attend to the body. In the back of the room, BRASS opens the closet door and checks the clothes on the hangers inside. On the closet shelf, he finds wigs, hats and various make-up applications.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: These guys liked to play dress-up.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You find any shoes back there?</p>
<p>(BRASS looks in the closet floor and not finding any, turns and checks out the room.)</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: That's ridiculous. Why bother?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Okay.</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Look, uh, it could be right.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Can you make sure that gets to trace?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Yeah. Sure.</p>
<p>(WARRICK stands up and walks over to BRASS who has just picked up an electronic shoe slip-in.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey, what're you doing, touching that? You got gloves?</p>

<p><strong>Chris Bezich</strong>: No. You just seem a little pissed off about it. (He glances at her a little embarrassed by his next confession.) I like it.</p>

<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: Mugs, I heard you had some time off because of me.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Neon glass.</p>
<p><strong>David Hodges</strong>: I checked out that graveyard once. Pretty interesting.</p>

<p>(WARRICK talks as GRISSOM examines the electronic shoe device.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Grissom, I have been in Vegas my whole life. I've known guys who counted cards, hedged bets, crushed a poker table with a lowball pair. I've seen guys beat the house with their hands ... but never with their toes.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM presses the buttons on the transmitter and watches as the three hammers in the shoe pad pop up and down.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Transmitter and receiver.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I was reading about these silicon valley types in the '80s called the ... eudaemonic enterprises. Have you heard of them?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The Eudaemon. Aristotle's presiding spirit of rationality.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: They say they figured out a way to beat the roulette wheel. Not through a betting system, but through physics.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's simple in principle.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM gives the roulette wheel a spin and goes into lecture mode.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: A fixed mass in a known orbit.</p>
<p>(He tosses the ball onto the wheel and the familiar sound of the ball hitting the wood is heard.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [TOP VIEW DOWN] of a spinning roulette wheel in the casino.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) As long as you can account for all the forces-- air resistance, friction, gravity -- you can land a probe on mars.</p>
<p>(Camera swings around the roulette table and finds the person with the transmitter watching the wheel spin.)</p>
<p>(Camera zooms in on the side of the spinning roulette wheel.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (V.O.) Well, they say that every roulette wheel is a little different. Tilt, wobble, bounce ...</p>
<p>(There are various cuts between the player with the transmitter and the spinning roulette wheel. It's obvious that he's watching the wheel very carefully.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (V.O.) So, the guy with the transmitter does the calibration, clocks the position of the ball, ... </p>
<p>(The roulette wheel slowly comes to a stop. The ball on the wheel very slowly stops in front of the player with the transmitter.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (V.O.) ... hits the switch ... </p>
<p>(Camera zooms down the player with the transmitter down to his toes. The players toes hit the switch.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (V.O.) ... and the computer does the rest.</p>
<p>(The camera continues to travel through the electronics in the shoe device. The lights go on and off.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (V.O.) Plays out the spin in milliseconds, ... </p>
<p>(White flash to: The transmitter sends the signal and the camera travels across the floor past the other players feet.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (V.O.) ... predicts the result, ... </p>
<p>(The signal goes into the receiver in the player's shoe.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (V.O.) ... and then transmits a code to the receiver about where that ball will land.</p>
<p>(The camera travels up and lands on TEDDY KELLER in his wig and fat suit at the other end of the roulette wheel table.)</p>
<p><strong>Player</strong>: All right, big money, big money!</p>
<p>(As he stares at the board, the right betting number pads glow. TEDDY reaches forward and starts to place his bets.)</p>
<p><strong>Teddy Keller</strong>: $1,000 on four, 22, five and 17.</p>
<p>(Camera close up of the roulette ball on the wheel. The ball stops.)</p>
<p><strong>Croupier</strong>: It's number 22.</p>
<p>(The camera moves from TEDDY KELLER to DAVIS MULLINS in the baseball cap with the transmitter. The crowd cheers.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: This setup gives you a 44-percent advantage over the house. For every hundred these guys bet, they're pulling in $2,200 an hour.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Nice return. But it's a complicated system.</p>
<p>(NICK walks into the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Complicated, huh? Maybe for a couple of pizza majors. But not for an electrical engineering grad student. AFIS got a hit on the print off the transmitter in the shoe. </p>

<p><strong>Seth Landers</strong>: Scam was 20 to 30k a night, max. We hit Pike's. Next day, Tangiers. Everything was great. We made fifty grand, and then Teddy and Davis got greedy. You can't crush a roulette table like that, and not expect someone to notice.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: The Tangiers, Pike's, Rampart ... these are all Sam Braun's places. You got something against him?</p>
<p><strong>Seth Landers</strong>: No. His casinos are old school. They're low tech. (WARRICK nods in understanding.) There's less interference for my gear.</p>

<p><strong>Lawyer</strong>: My client offered the young man a ride home. They stopped briefly at the neon graveyard, where they held a private conversation regarding the ethics of defrauding a casino.</p>
<p>(BRASS chuckles.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: That must have been some chat. We know he left the casino with the money.</p>
<p><strong>Lawyer</strong>: The young man returned the money as a sign of respect for my client and his position in the community.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'm sure he did.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and SAM stare at each other.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, what next? You gonna tell me you're being set up? It happens to you a lot, huh, Sam?</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You still liking Braun for these murders?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, why? Something change?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'm thinking Seth Landers and his pals had a woody for him. I went back to the Rampart, and I took some electronic noise measurements. The place is a mess of interference. Electronics in old casinos aren't shielded.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So, you're saying that the shoe computers would've worked better in one of the new casinos on the strip?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Definitely. A kid as smart as Seth wouldn't make a mistake like that.</p>

<p><strong>Joseph Greene</strong>: That's my son. Is he okay?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Let's stop playing dumb, Mr. Greene, huh? </p>
<p><strong>Joseph Greene</strong>: Would you mind stepping away from the machine? You're st-staring over my shoulder, you're looking at me. You're jinxing me, and I'm gonna have to ... </p>
<p>(BRASS reaches out and stops JOSEPH GREENE from pulling the slot machine handle.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: How's that? Is that better?</p>
<p>(They see JOSEPH GREENE'S injury.)</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The exclusion/exemption clause means you don't get to gamble. Period. Not even the quarter slots at the gas-and-go.</p>
<p><strong>Joseph Greene</strong>: Don't you have something better to do? Like find out who murdered those two kids in number 27.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You got any theories? It was your apartment building. Your son Seth fingered the guy you were sitting next to. A guy you don't know. The guy who put you in the black book.</p>
<p><strong>Joseph Greene</strong>: No. The gaming commission put me in the black book.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, for cheating, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>Joseph Greene</strong>: (chuckles and takes off his glasses) I did not cheat. I did not cheat. I didn't have to cheat. I beat the casinos. I beat 'em, and they ganged up on me, and, uh ... that was it, they didn't want me there anymore.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No, you beat Sam Braun's casino and he ended your gambling career. You're barred from the casinos for life. That sounds like motive to me.</p>
<p><strong>Joseph Greene</strong>: Motive for what, playing the quarter slots?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p><strong>Joseph Greene</strong>: Come on.</p>
<p>(BRASS sits down at the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Okay, look, here's a quiz. Teddy Keller, Davis Mullins and your son Seth were caught fleecing the Rampart. Now two of 'em are dead.</p>
<p><strong>Joseph Greene</strong>: I had no idea what those two boys were doing. But I will tell you this -- I will tell you that my son is a good kid, he's a good boy.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Then why'd you put him in the middle of your action? Why'd you use him to settle an old score? (sighs) Maybe Sam Braun's innocent. Maybe Seth whacked his partners because he got caught.</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: There's a lot of garbage build up. When was the last pick-up?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Metcalf</strong>: Day before yesterday. End of finals party last night.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Looks like blood. Let's hope the killer left his DNA behind. .22 revolver, two live rounds, four expended. Should be able to pull some prints off it.</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So we've got our murder weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, we found our murder weapon. I don't know the kid thinks up this elaborate scheme to cheat the casinos. Then he kills his partners. But he dumps his gun at his dorm?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: An rg .22. That's not a very bad ass' first weapon of choice.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No, it's a small caliber weapon for an up-close-and-personal hit. I don't really see the kid pulling a Gotti.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay, two victims, two taps to the head. But the loads are different.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, maybe he ran out of ammo. Went back and bought another brand.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: And reloaded, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: The bullets that were found in Teddy Keller's skull, were copper washed cci .22s.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: And the two rounds found in Davis Mullins were Remington Brass washed. So, based on the position of the cylinder Remingtons were fired first?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [APARTMENT #27] Close up of the gun cylinder as the chamber moves, advancing to the new bullets. Two gun shots fire. DAVIS MULLINS falls to the ground.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: [NEON GRAVEYARD] Close up of the gun cylinder as the chamber advances to the old bullets. Two gun shots fire. TEDDY KELLER falls to the ground.)</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No. Where did you go after Teddy Keller was taken?</p>
<p><strong>Seth Landers</strong>: You know what, you keep on asking me all these questions, but my lawyer says I'm not even supposed to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Okay, you don't have to talk to me. But you got to know you're looking at two counts of murder.</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Then talk to me. Tell me what happened. Where did you go? For real.</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So you went after Sam Braun to prove something to your old man.</p>
<p>(SETH gets to his feet and walks back to the bars.)</p>
<p><strong>Seth Landers</strong>: Yeah. I mean, I went after the whale, but I skinned it. I did what my dad could never do.</p>

<p>(WARRICK snaps more photos.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Plus ... what could be paint and blood smears.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: That blood could match the stains we found on Davis' shirt. I don't understand why he had to kill his kids. They were making a lot of money off of Braun. Dad was getting his revenge.</p>

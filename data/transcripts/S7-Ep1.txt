<p>[CIRQUE DU SOLEIL] </p>
<p>(BLURRY BOTTOM VIEW UP: The blurry image of an acrobat falls toward the camera in a controlled way. The closer he gets to the camera, the clearer he is. He slows and stops in front of the camera.) </p>
<p>VARIOUS VIEWS OF:</p>
<p>(Acrobats fly through the air and land feet first against a tall, black vertical wall. As their feet hit the wall, light patterns emerge. More acrobats fall and hit the wall feet first; a magnificent light pattern appears as they walk back up toward the ceiling in time with the dramatic music.)</p>
<p>(The audience applauds.) </p>
<p>INSERT: CUTS OF THE CIRQUE DU SOLEIL SHOW</p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[EXT. HOTEL - ROOFTOP PARTY - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(On top one of the hotels, a small party is taking place. The audience applauds lightly at a performance off screen. On the main floor, two women perform with lit hula-hoops.) </p>
<p>(Cameras snap as Sam Braun and his young guest arrive.) </p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[INT. HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(A man dressed all in black checks the wires around some explosives.) </p>
<p>[EXT. HOTEL - ROOFTOP PARTY - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Robert O'Brien stands in the front of the audience watching the women perform. After a moment, he turns and walks away.) </p>
<p>[INT. HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(A person cuts the wires hooked up to the explosives.)</p>
<p>(He walks away. We note the long wire extended through the passageway.) </p>
<p>[CIRQUE DU SOLEIL] </p>
<p>(The program continues.) </p>
<p>VARIOUS CUTS OF: THE PROGRAM, THE SCAFFOLDING AND BACKSTAGE.</p>
<p>[INT. HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(BLURRY IMAGE OF: The man shines a flashlight down the hallway.) </p>
<p>[CIRQUE DU SOLEIL] </p>
<p>VARIOUS CUTS OF: THE PROGRAM.</p>
<p>MULTIPLE INTERCUTS OF THE THREE SCENES:</p>
<p>[INT. HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The man unrolls more wire down the hallway from the explosives.) </p>
<p>(He presses the two buttons.) </p>
<p>INSERT: CGI - The current travels through the lines in the hallway and straight to the explosives, setting them off.) </p>
<p>(The RAMPART explodes.) </p>
<p>[EXT. HOTEL - ROOFTOP PARTY - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The guests at the rooftop party cheer as they watch the RAMPART fall.) </p>
<p>[CIRQUE DU SOLEIL] </p>
<p>(The program continues. One of the performers slides down the wall and sees a dead body on the floor underneath.)</p>
<p>[EXT. HOTEL - ROOFTOP PARTY - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(A woman guest leads a man to a nearby cabana. She giggles as they enter. A man is already there in the cabana, sitting on the cushions and slumped over. She bumps into him, turns and screams.) </p>
<p>(The reporters at the party rush over and start snapping photos of the dead man, a gun in his hand and blood dripping from his mouth onto his shirt.) </p>
<p>[CIRQUE DU SOLEIL] </p>
<p>(The workers at the Cirque crowd around the dead woman on the floor. The performers hanging from the wires up above watch.) </p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO: </p>
<p>[CIRQUE DU SOLEIL] </p>
<p>(The back door slides open. Grissom and Catherine walk inside and meet up with Sofia, who is there with the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I always liked the circus.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, it's fun trying to figure out the magic tricks.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, that's taking the fun out of it.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Hey, the coroner's on his way. (Catherine and Grissom put their kits down.) Vic's a Jane Doe, no ID.</p>
<p>(They look at the body.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Green powder on her dress.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Is she with the show?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: According to statements, she wasn't a part of Cirque du Soleil.</p>
<p>(Michael Souray quietly steps forward behind Sofia. He remains a discreet distance behind her.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, there's plenty of surveillance.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Yeah, but the body was discovered backstage.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What's it doing out here?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: I think he wants to tell you.</p>
<p>(She indicates Michael Souray behind her. He steps forward.) </p>
<p><strong>Michael Souray</strong>: Hi. Michel Souray, company manager of Ka. I'm sorry to meet you under these circumstances. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Why'd you move the body?</p>
<p>(As he speaks, we maneuver backstage: </p>
<p>[INT. HOTEL - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The doors open. Performers are still in costume and are mingling around.) </p>
<p><strong>Michael Souray</strong>: (V.O.) Backstage can be a dangerous place if you don't know your way around. </p>
<p>(Michael Souray escorts Catherine and Grissom backstage as they head to where the body was found.) </p>
<p><strong>Michael Souray</strong>: So the Cirque organization made a special agreement with Clark County. Any accidents that occur inside our facility are under Cirque jurisdiction. When we found the body, our personnel immediately transported her outside and the paramedics arrived within minutes. </p>
<p>[INT. HOTEL - BACKSTAGE -- UNDER THE PLATFORM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Michael Souray leads Grissom and Catherine under the stage's rising platform.) </p>
<p><strong>Michael Souray</strong>: I have no idea who the poor girl is and I know every face on our staff. Watch your step.</p>
<p>(He steps down off the main beam and maneuvers to the site.) </p>
<p><strong>Michael Souray</strong>: During the performance, the stages above you are always moving. </p>
<p>(He leads them to a spot with large drops of blood on the floor.) </p>
<p><strong>Michael Souray</strong>: We found the body here in the crush zone.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, we know where she died. </p>
<p>(They look up and around. Obviously, they're under the rising platform.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Where'd she come from?</p>
<p>(Cut to: Catherine and Grissom stand on the platform as it rises.) </p>
<p>(The platform reaches stage level and they look out at all the seats in the audience. It's an amazing view.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Where would you like to start?</p>
<p>(Grissom's speechless as he looks around.) </p>
<p>FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>

<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[EXT. HOTEL - ROOFTOP - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Warrick and Sara are at the crime scene. Warrick snaps photos of the body as Sara looks closely at it.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Looks like he ate a .38 special.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: The gun's still in his hand. How many suicides have you seen like that?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Personally? None.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Me, either.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I haven't found a suicide note.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Maybe it was staged.</p>
<p>(Sara stands up as David Phillips enters the cabana with his kit.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Sorry, got held up at the &quot;meet the future in-laws&quot; dinner.</p>
<p>(He puts his kit down. Sara turns around.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Did they love you?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: I got a little too excited talking about work. They stopped eating.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: David, the gun is still in his hand; it's yours to clear.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p>(David Phillips reaches for the gun. He struggles with trying to get the gun out of the dead man's grip.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Rigor's setting in fast. It happens when it's hot like tonight.</p>
<p>(The gun fires into the ground.) </p>
<p>(Women scream.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Oh! </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (to Phillips) You all right?</p>
<p>(Sara steps out of the cabana.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (loudly) It's all right everyone, a misfire.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey. At least we know one person who shot the dead guy.</p>
<p>(CUT TO: Outside the cabana, officers take statements, reporters snap photos, and Brass talks with Sam Braun. They're standing in front of a miniature model of the new hotel Sam is going to build in place of the RAMPART.) </p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: Good to see you on your feet again, Jim.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You've never seen me off them, Sam. You know, this is like old times. You, me, a party. A dead body.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: This is supposed to be a celebration. The Eclipse is going to be my legacy. We break ground next year.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So I'm guessing you knew the victim -- Robert O'Brien?</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: He invested in the Eclipse.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Did you hear the shot?</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: No. Must've taken place during the implosion.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You think he shot himself?</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: You think he didn't?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, he was about to make a lot of money in your casino; why would he?</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: Look, I hardly knew the guy ... or his partner, Joe Hirschoff. </p>
<p>(Sam turns around and indicates the man sitting and popping a couple of pills in his mouth.) </p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: They were marketing the project in LA. They had a little money, so I sold them a few shares.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: How much is a share?</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: Two million.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: When was the last time you saw him?</p>
<p><strong>Sam Braun</strong>: Everyone was gathering on the other side of the roof. I think he went off with his partner.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. NEW YORK CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(We hold on the MGM building and of the Cirque du Soleil &quot;Ka&quot; ad on the video boards.)</p>
<p>[INT. MGM HOTEL -- BACKSTAGE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Off screen, we hear the camera snap and see camera flashes.) </p>
<p>(Camera pans down and settles on Nick, who is drawing a map of the scene.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I got it.</p>
<p>(Grissom stops snapping photos to look at Nick.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Aircraft carrier. That's what this place reminds me of. Of course, an aircraft carrier was built for national security and this ... </p>
<p>(Nick looks up and sees the platform at its highest above him.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: ... is a ton of hi-tech, twisted steel for the sake of entertainment.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's not just entertainment, Nick. The Cirque's about the power of imagination -- it's how we were able to put a man on the moon.</p>
<p>(Nick looks up and around. Catherine finds a necklace and picks it up.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I've got a monogram necklace. A.F.D. Well, it's not an ID, but I'll settle for initials.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. HOTEL - ROOFTOP -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Brass and Sara interview Joe Hirschoff.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Did you and Mr. O'Brien arrive together?</p>
<p><strong>Joe Hirschoff</strong>: (nods) Yeah, we're in a suite downstairs.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: And you've been with him since?</p>
<p><strong>Joe Hirschoff</strong>: Mostly. A couple minutes before, um, the implosion, I went to get us margaritas. When I came back, Robert was gone. I knew he didn't want to miss it, so I went looking. </p>
<p>INSERT: FLASHBACK</p>
<p>(Joe Hirschoff turns and leaves the front of the crowd. Several cuts of him looking for someone.) </p>
<p>BACK TO SCENE.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Hirschoff</strong>: I was by the elevator. I thought maybe Robert had gone back to the suite. Then I heard that girl scream and ... I just knew.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Are you taking any medication? </p>
<p>(He takes the bottle of pills out and shows it to them. Sara takes a baggie out.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: May I see that?</p>
<p>(He hands her the bottle and she looks at the label:<br />

TAKE 1 TABLET AS NEEDED<br />
ALPRAZOLAM</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Alprazolam.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Hirschoff</strong>: It's for stress. My job is very stressful.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Does Mr. O'Brien own a gun?</p>
<p><strong>Joe Hirschoff</strong>: He hates guns; we both do.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Could you hold your hands out for me like this please?</p>
<p>(She demonstrates, hands out, palms down.) </p>
<p><strong>Joe Hirschoff</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Gunshot residue test.</p>
<p><strong>Joe Hirschoff</strong>: Robert shot himself.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: And this is how we prove it.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Right palm down.</p>
<p>(He holds out his hand and Sara dabs at them. She notices a smell.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Am I smelling alcohol on your hand?</p>
<p><strong>Joe Hirschoff</strong>: Yeah. When I saw Robert, I spilled the drinks.</p>

<p>[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Robbins records his exam.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Standard SAE was collected. No signs of sexual trauma indicated.</p>
<p>(He folds the sheet covering her chest back a little.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Several linear red-brown abrasions on the chest and back. Marginal contusions. Palpable underlying rib and sternal fractures.</p>
<p>(He feels the abdomen and hears crackling sounds.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Huh, Rice Krispies. Subcutaneous emphysema.</p>
<p>INSERT: CGI OF TISSUE UNDER THE SKIN</p>
<p>INSERT: FLASHBACK OF VICTIM UNDER THE PLATFORM BEING CRUSHED. THE VICTIM IS STILL ALIVE.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (V.O.) Air in the tissue indicates victim was most likely subjected to significant crushing force across the torso.</p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
[INT. HOTEL - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Catherine looks at the blood on the floor.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You know, this crush zone is clearly marked.</p>
<p>(She stands up and looks at Nick.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, and anybody familiar with the stage would know to avoid that area.</p>
<p>(Grissom turns his flashlight on and looks up at the underside of the lift.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Looks like blood on the edge of this lift. It might have been unavoidable.</p>

<p>[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY] </p>
<p>(Robbins examines the liver in the scale pan as he reports his findings to Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Her liver was lacerated. If she'd been alive when the crushing occurred, these lacerations would of resulted in hemoperitoneum and, uh, bilateral hemothorax.</p>
<p>(He turns back to the body on the table.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: But there was no significant hemorrhage in the abdominal or thoracic cavities.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So she was dead before she was crushed.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Yeah, COD was temporal laceration of the brain due to skull fracture. Initially, I assumed it was associated with a crushing trauma. It wasn't.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So the fatal blow was a separate event.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (nods) Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, the way things move around on that stage, it could have happened anywhere. She looks like she's probably in her mid-20s. She's in good shape.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(Catherine picks up the victim's hand and turns it over.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Is well toned. She got calluses on her hands and feet.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Could be a dancer or a gymnast.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: But if she wasn't part of Cirque, what was she doing there?</p>

<p>(Brass and Sheriff Burdick walk the hallways.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What can I do for you?</p>
<p><strong>Ben Burdick</strong>: This is about what I can do for you.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>Ben Burdick</strong>: I've asked the mayor to give you a commendation. Medal of Valor. Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (sighs) Well, that's-that's nice, uh, do I have to be there?</p>
<p><strong>Ben Burdick</strong>: As a matter of protocol, I'd say you damn well better be, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, you know, Ben, if --</p>
<p><strong>Ben Burdick</strong>: (interrupts) Look, I'm going to say a few nice things, hand you a plaque, we'll shake hands, a whole lot of reporters will be there to take pictures of the big event. It'll be magic.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Ben Burdick</strong>: My office will call you to set it up.</p>
<p>(The sheriff continues walking while Brass stops.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (mutters) I was going to vote for you anyway.</p>

[INT. CSI - TRACE LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Hodges reports his findings to Grissom, who looks through the scope at the powder.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: The green powder on your vic's dress is open-celled phenolic foam, holds more than forty times its weight in water. Reminds me of this girl I knew in college--</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (interrupts) I don't need to hear about that.</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: (continues) She was a florist. The foam's used almost exclusively in floral arrangements.</p>
<p>(Grissom looks at Hodges.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Wait a minute. </p>
<p>(He puts his glasses on and looks at the file.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The security guard at Ka said that he let a young woman through the artists' entrance with a delivery of flowers. He escorted her to the green room, but didn't remember seeing her leave.</p>
<p>(Grissom stops and thinks.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Ah, the old flower delivery trick. Works every time.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p>(Grissom takes his glasses off and leaves the room.) </p>

[INT. CSI - A/V LAB -- DAY] </p>

<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Cirque du Soleil has cameras all over that theatre. They use them for performance review. I went through all the feeds the Cirque guys sent over, and I have to tell you, Siegfried &amp; Roy's disappearing elephant no longer impresses me.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'll tell you how they did that later.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: There's the vic, right?</p>
<p>(On the video, they watch as a woman and a man slip through the backstage door.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yup, 11-D. Artists' entrance. Girl has the same kind of dress and hair color as the vic. As far as I can see, they managed to stay hidden backstage for most of the performance.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: It's dark, they're wearing black ... crew's focused on their jobs ... it's possible nobody saw them.</p>
<p>(On the monitor, they watch as the woman and man walk along the catwalk.) </p>

<p>(Greg shows them footage of the man playfully grabbing the woman from behind. She drops her purse.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: She dropped something.</p>

<p>(Catherine sits at the bar. The bartender leans over and points to a man sitting at the far end of the counter.) </p>
<p><strong>Bartender</strong>: The guy down there wants to buy you your next drink.</p>
<p>(Catherine turns and looks at the man. She shakes her head.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to the bartender) No, thanks.</p>
<p>(The bartender leaves. Catherine takes her drink and sips as she turns and listens to the music as she watches Nick on the dance floor.) </p>
<p>(She smiles and continues sipping from her drink.) </p>
<p>(Thinks start to get blurry for Catherine. The music fades in and out. She puts a hand to her head.) </p>
<p>(She looks around, the music mutes and fades in and out.) </p>
<p>VARIOUS DISSOLVES OF THE BAR</p>
<p>(The song fades. Nick waves to Catherine as he leaves with the blonde.) </p>
<p>SMASH FADE TO BLACK</p>
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[CU: CATHERINE'S EYE]</p>
<p>(It's quiet. Catherine opens her eyes.)</p>
<p>REVERSE POV</p>
<p>[INT. MOTEL ROOM - MORNING]</p>
<p>(Sunlight filters in through large holes in the closed curtains.) </p>
<p>(Catherine blinks. Sounds and voices slowly filter in from outside and register with her.) </p>
<p>(Catherine raises her head off the bed. We note that she is naked and face-down on a bed in an unknown room.) </p>
<p>(In the distance, a door slams.) </p>
<p>(TOP VIEW DOWN. Catherine looks around.) </p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[INT. DELANCY RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - MORNING] </p>
<p>(Close-up of a dish rack with dishes on it. With one continuous take, the camera moves over along the counter - past a paper towel holder, an old-fashioned toaster, some cut bread, the loaf and a knife. We continue past an open cookbook on a holder in front of an open window.) </p>
<p>(Uninterrupted, the camera continues along the kitchen - past a stove with a pot and pan on it - and along the counter where there are appliances, bottles of cooking supplies and other kitchen details.)</p>
<p>(The camera continues to pull back into the kitchen and past the island filled with framed photos of Izzy Delancy, a red bowl of fruit, bottled water, money and change on the counter next to the mail.) </p>
<p>(We continue to pull back past the counter. We note a filled dog dish on the floor. We reach the kitchen table - a fork, a plate of two over-easy eggs and bacon - all near a blood pool.)</p>
<p>(The camera continues down to the floor where the blood has spilled onto the carpet. Camera moves over to the person sitting in the chair in the blood pool.)</p>
<p>(We move over to the sneakers, up the jeans-covered legs - and up the blood dripping down the arms - and up to the bloodied doll's face. The doll's eyes are closed and head on the table in the pool of blood.)</p>
<p>(Camera pulls back to show the doll slumped over in its doll chair, head on the miniature table, a breakfast plate nearby.) </p>
<p>(We continue to pull back on the miniature kitchen scene.)</p>
<p>(Suddenly, the light coming from the miniature kitchen window is blocked and an eye peeps inside.) </p>
<p>(We move back across the kitchen and toward Grissom's eye.) </p>
<p>(Grissom blinks.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
TOP VIEW DOWN</p>
<p>(The light from the flashlight shines down on the miniature doll at the miniature table inside the miniature box.)</p>
<p>(Camera rises and we see a real dead body slumped over the table, head in a pool of blood. A breakfast plate of bacon and eggs is nearby.)</p>
<p>(Sofia looks from the miniature to the dead body.)</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Have you ever seen anything like this?</p>
<p>(Grissom stands up.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No. </p>
<p>(In the miniature, there's a folded newspaper on the table near the blood pool.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The detail is ...</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: -- terrifying.</p>
<p>(Grissom notes the cut bread, knife, mayo and other items on the counter in the miniature box.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Impressive. </p>
<p>(He looks over at the dead body at the kitchen table.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And yes ... terrifying.</p>
<p>(Next to the real dead body, there's a folded newspaper, too. Sofia looks form the dead body to the miniature box.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Which do you think came first: The chicken or the egg?</p>
<p>(Grissom looks at the miniature, then at the real body.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I've always been an egg man. But this time, I don't know.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. MOTEL ROOM - MORNING]</p>
<p>(We pan along the motel room floor and we see Catherine's dress, a black slip and her purse.) </p>
<p>(Off camera, we hear Catherine groan.)</p>
<p>(Catherine is still on the bed. She grabs her bag and sits up. She dumps the contents onto the bed.)</p>
<p>(She checks her wallet - her driver's license, credit cards and cash are still inside.) </p>
<p>(She looks at the closed curtains. She grabs the bedsheet securely around her as she stands up and heads to the window. She opens the curtains and is blinded by the sunlight.)</p>
<p>(Outside is a small motel swimming pool. She squints as her eyes adjust to the bright light and as she looks around. All she sees is a parking lot and more motel rooms.) </p>
<p>[INT. DELANCY RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - MORNING] </p>
<p>(Grissom snaps photos of the kitchen counter, which is exactly like the miniature kitchen counter. He picks up the ruler and moves it over to the kitchen sink as he snaps photos of the frying pan with two eggs, bacon and spatula.) </p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
(The miniature frying pan in the sink has two eggs, bacon and spatula.)</p>
<p>(Grissom puts the ruler down on the counter and snaps photos of the bag of potato chips.)</p>
<p>(He raises his camera and snaps photos of the gold records hanging on the wall. We focus in on the last record: IF DUSTY FELL, Izzy Delancy.) </p>
<p>(Grissom continues to snap photos. He puts the ruler down next to the folded LAS VEGAS REVIEW-JOURNAL and takes photos of it. He takes photos of the victim's head injury, of the breakfast plate in the pool of blood on the table.) </p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
(The miniature table.)</p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
[INT. MOTEL ROOM - MORNING]</p>
<p>(Catherine is standing in front of the mirror. She's wearing her black slip. She picks up the phone and dials.) </p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: (from phone) Las Vegas Crime Lab? How can I help you?</p>
<p>(Without a word, she hangs up quickly.) </p>
<p>(She thinks, then quickly heads back to the bed. She picks up a tampon, a comb, a tissue and a nail file. She looks down and notices a slip of paper on the carpet. She uses the tissue and picks it up.) </p>
<p>(Catherine heads back to the sink where she opens up an unused towel. She puts her supplies down on it. She opens the ice container and sets it aside. She opens a shower cap. She uses the nail file to scrape samples from under her fingernails into the shower cap. She sets it aside.) </p>
<p>(She takes a couple of tissues and wipes the sink drain. She sets that aside.)</p>
<p>(She opens the tampon and uses it to take a sample from herself. She sets it aside.)</p>
<p>(She takes the comb and a couple of tissues and sets out to get more samples form herself.)</p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
[INT. DELANCY RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - MORNING] </p>
<p>(Grissom snaps photos of the miniature. He lifts up the box cover and finds a miniature pot rack hanging from the ceiling. He snaps a photo of it.) </p>
<p>(He looks at the pot rack, then turns and looks back at the kitchen behind him. Sure enough, there's a pot rack hanging from the ceiling.) </p>
<p>(He sets it aside. He removes the box cover and snaps more photos of the miniature.) </p>
<p>(He pauses and turns to look back at the real crime scene.)</p>
<p>[INT. MOTEL ROOM - SHOWER -- MORNING]</p>
<p>(Catherine is taking a shower. As the water falls and steam rises, she covers her face with her hands and cries.) </p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>
<p>TO BE CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>End</strong></p>

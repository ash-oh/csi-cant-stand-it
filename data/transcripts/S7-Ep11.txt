Addie Finch:  Piece of crap.
 
Addie Finch: Jay? Is that you?



 
Catherine:  CSI processed the knife and found blood from four different sources, -- 


 
Catherine: -- three of which were intermingled together on the blade. One matched Addie Finch, the victim. 
 
Catherine: The other two were also female. And based on the number of DNA markers they have in common, they're either sisters or mother and daughter. They are not related to Addie Finch. And both remain unidentified.
ADA Jasmine Davis: And the fourth DNA source?
Catherine: When I disassembled the knife, I found blood on the tang, which is the steel area under the handle.
ADA Jasmine Davis: Were you able to identify this DNA?
Catherine: It was a match to the victim's son, Jay Gregory Finch.
ADA Jasmine Davis: The defendant.
Catherine: That's right.
ADA Jasmine Davis: No further questions, Your Honor.
Judge Hyak: Cross-examination, Mr. Novak?
 
Adam Novak: Did you recover the knife from the scene three years ago?
Catherine: No, the defendant turned it in to PD.
 
Adam Novak: A man comes home ... only to find his mother bleeding on the floor, a knife stuck in her chest. In a desperate attempt to save her life, he removes the knife from her chest. But it's too late. He takes the knife in question to the authorities, cooperates with their investigation, and then you charge him with murder.
Catherine: The defendant did not call for help, and he waited five days to turn it in.
Adam Novak: He was in shock. You found two unknown sources of blood on that knife. Isn't it possible that one or both of them killed Addie Finch?
ADA Jasmine Davis: Objection. Speculative.
Judge Hyak: I'll allow it.
Catherine: It's possible. However, Mr. Finch's blood was found isolated near the handle. Stabbing is a messy business. I believe that Mr. Finch cut himself ...
Adam Novak: You've been warned about speculation, Ms. Willows.
Catherine: It's not speculation.
Adam Novak: From his birth until the time of his mother's death, Mr. Finch lived in that house. Isn't it equally possible he cut himself on that knife at a separate occasion?
Catherine: Yes, but ...
Adam Novak: For the record, her answer was &quot;Yes, it's possible.&quot; No further questions.

 
ADA Jasmine Davis: Though Addie Finch received multiple stab wounds, the actual cause of death was a gunshot wound. Isn't that correct?
Catherine: We believe that the defendant stabbed his mother multiple times, stood over her while she was dying, and shot her in the forehead to complete the act.
Adam Novak: You recovered a bullet from Ms. Finch's body. Did you also recover a gun?
Catherine: No.
Adam Novak: So you have nothing with which to forensically match the bullet?
Catherine: The bullet was a .38. The defendant's father, who passed away in
1989, was seen in photographs holding a .38. We also found an empty gun case in the defendant's closet which tested positive for chromium steel.
Adam Novak: My belt buckle is also made of metal. If I kept it in a box, wouldn't it also test positive?
Catherine: Do you keep it in a velvet-lined gun box?
Adam Novak: No further questions.


 
Head Juror: On the sole count of murder in the first degree, we, the jury, find the defendant, Jay Gregory Finch ... not guilty.
 
Adam Novak: You won.
Jay Finch: Thank you.
Adam Novak: Take care of yourself.
 
Catherine: Quite the salesman, Mr. Novak.
 
Adam Novak: Not a hard sell.
Catherine: Finch is guilty.
Adam Novak: You once said the same about me. You were wrong then, too.
Catherine: Yeah, you're not a murderer; you just set them free.
FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS



 
 
Brass:  Why didn't you bring the knife directly in to us.
Jay Finch:  I get these anxiety attacks ... since I hit my head real bad playing football my senior year. I get these brutal headaches. So, I climb into my car and drive. Sometimes for days. It ... it calms me. Mom and I took care of each other. We were a good team.
Catherine: What a load of crap.  We found his bags packed near the door. Addie raised a momma's boy and she'd finally had enough. She was kicking his ass out and he snapped.
Nick: Did Finch have a history of violence?
Catherine: No, but his CT scan showed damage to the amygdala and the frontal lobe. That kind of injury has been known to change personality, to make a person more inclined to violence. We need to ID his other two victims. Charge Finch with a new crime. No double jeopardy. We can even use the knife again.
Nick: Catherine, we tried three years ago. There were no other female-related crimes in the Vegas metro area that week.
Catherine: He drove for five days, Nick.
Nick: Yes, and as I recall, we put out a broadcast covering cities statewide.
Catherine: But not to any of the small towns in between. They aren't connected to a central network.
Nick:  Needle in a haystack.
Catherine: It's our job to find a needle in a haystack.

 
 
Grissom: How did you know about this?
Hodges: I saw an approved leave of absence form on Ecklie's desk. Don't worry, I didn't say anything to anyone else. Did you think that you were going to teach at my alma mater in the dead of winter without warm clothes?
Grissom: I thought you went to college in San Diego.
Hodges: Graduate school. Undergraduate was all about the Bay State. Crazy times, my friend, crazy times. Those Hampshire girls down in Amherst? Insane.
Grissom: Thank you.
Hodges: You're welcome.

Hodges: What are you teaching?
Grissom: The seasonal fluctuations in observed behaviors of the Walden Pond swamp mosquito.
Hodges: Excellent. Yeah, I don't know what college was like for you, but for me it was a new beginning, a chance to reinvent myself. For the first time in my life, I felt like I fit in. Not like now. I mean ... you and I are close, but sometimes I just don't think the others get me.
 
Catherine: You got a second?
Hodges: He's kind of busy.
 
Hodges: Oh. When you get a chance, hit the Purple Pint. Ask for Cookie. Tell her Davey Hodges sent you. Drinks'll be on the house. 
Grissom: Crazy times.
Hodges: Yeah.
 
Catherine: Jay Finch got an oil change the day that he killed his mother. We compared the odometer reading on the work order against what it read when we impounded his car. The difference was 350 miles. We used that to create a search radius. Nick and I just spent six hours on the phone with sheriffs in every county inside that area. There was one unsolved case that matched our criteria in Larkston: a Laura Montoya and her 12-year-old daughter, Robyn.
Grissom: Why are we talking about this? Finch got off, didn't he?
Catherine: And I don't buy it. I need to go to Larkston.
Grissom: You can't.
Catherine: Look, I want a second shot at this guy. I want to get him before he kills again.
Grissom: I'm going on sabbatical. You're gonna be the acting supervisor while I'm gone.
 
Catherine: When are you leaving?
Grissom: Tomorrow night.
Catherine: I'll be back before then.
 
Catherine: How long have you known about this?
 
 

 
 
Adam Novak: Need a vacation?
Catherine: I guess I should be grateful you didn't stop by my house.
Adam Novak: And get a gun in my face? No, thank you. I can take a hint.
Catherine: What do you want?
 
Adam Novak: I'm here waving a white flag. Look, I owe you an apology. I regret the way I've behaved toward you in the past. I've sobered up, and I want to make amends.
Catherine: Climbing the 12 Steps. 
Adam Novak: Got a few more to go. 
Catherine: Well, you can check me off the list. Thank you for stopping by.
(Catherine turns her back on him and climbs into her car.
Adam Novak: Hey ... which pissed you off more, that Finch went free or that I won?
Catherine: I'm fifty-fifty.
Adam Novak:  There's still hope for me.
 
Nick: You all right?
Catherine: Perfect timing. Let's go.


 
 
Nick: Sabbatical's usually a euphemism for &quot;sayonara.&quot; I don't think Grissom's coming back.
Catherine: Why wouldn't he?
Nick: I don't know. He shaved his beard, he's lost a little weight, he's been leaving when shift is over. I think he even took a day off last week.
Catherine: Maybe he's got himself a girlfriend.
Nick: That's what I'm saying. You know, I thought you were going to leave a few months ago.
Catherine:  Why, 'cause I shaved my beard?
Nick:  No, I mean, I ... you don't really have to work anymore if you don't want to, right?
Catherine: What are you talking about?
Nick: Well ... Sam, with your dad ... the whole thing.
Catherine: Oh, is that what people think? That daddy's little girl got herself a big inheritance? Well, let me tell you something, Nicky. All of Sam's money is tied up in a big hole in the ground on a very nice piece of Strip real estate, but I got no dog in that fight.
 NICK: Well, I'm glad that someone's sticking around.

Sheriff Beth McGuire: Hey. Now you guys aren't here to make me look bad, are you?
Nick: No. 
Sheriff Beth McGuire: Just busting chops. Sheriff Beth McGuire.
 
Nick: Nick Stokes. Nice to meet you.
Catherine: Catherine Willows. Nice to meet you.
 
Sheriff Beth McGuire: Hi. I just read that file that you sent over. Jay Finch, he looks like a real son of a bitch. Laura Montoya, she was a good friend of mine. So, uh ...
 
Sheriff Beth McGuire: Hey, Ronnie. How you doing?
Ronnie: Hi, Sheriff. 
Sheriff Beth McGuire: I would really be happy to see this case solved.
Catherine: Yeah, as would we.
Nick: Why don't you ... run us through it, Sheriff?
Sheriff Beth McGuire: Okay. Uh ... Laura ... and her daughter were right ... here eating burgers and drinking shakes. They were the last customers of the night.
 
Sheriff Beth McGuire:  Luke Hanson closed up, and then he left and they were still right here, eating.

Jake Hanson: I'm heading home, girls. Don't you stay all night.
Laura Montoya: Stay hi to your mom, Jake.
 
Sheriff Beth McGuire: And I was called about 10:00 p.m. Couple of local skateboarders. They saw the blood and they just, you know, called it in.
Nick: No bodies?
Sheriff Beth McGuire: No. Just a blood pool ... here.  I found some blood drops leading out through the parking lot towards the main road.
Catherine: Abduction?
Sheriff Beth McGuire: I don't know. One minute, my best friend is just having an Oreo smoothie with her kid, and then the next minute all I got is blood drops.
Nick: Did you identify who the blood belonged to?
Sheriff Beth McGuire: We sent a sample to the Reno Lab. Came back a match to Laura. 
 
Catherine: Mother's the bigger threat. Probably took her out first. And once she was injured, the daughter got scared into compliance.
Nick: Any idea on the mode of death?
Beth McGuire: Well, I know your guy used a knife and a gun, but I didn't recover any weapons.
Catherine: We're gonna need a blood sample to compare to our knife.
Beth McGuire: I-I got that back in the fridge at the station.
Nick: You know, there are quite a few nicks in the pavement down here.
 
Catherine: So if Laura was seated here ... the shooter would've had to aim downward to impact the asphalt.
 
Nick: Then this would have been the trajectory of the bullet. Now, there's what appears to be a ricochet mark headed in the right direction.
 
Catherine: Killer shoots Laura from behind...

Nick: Wait a minute.
 
Nick: Oh, yeah. I think we're in business, ladies.




 
 
Warrick: Hey, Gris. So, uh, Hodges tells me you're flying the coop. What's the matter, you sick of baby-sitting?
Grissom: Just the opposite. I'm a teacher without any students.
Warrick: I've still got a lot to learn. Besides, having you around kinda keeps me honest.
Grissom: Whether you know it or not, you're the rock of my team. Catherine's going to be in charge for a while while I'm gone. Be there for her like you've been there for me and we'll all be fine.
Warrick: Thanks. It means a lot. You know I got you covered. What, are you sending those to the... the Louvre?
Grissom: Ernie Dell did kill with an artistic touch.


 
 
Nick: .25 caliber.
Catherine: Finch used a .38.
Beth McGuire: No dice, huh?
Nick: Finch could've used a different gun, but chances are, yeah, they're unrelated.
Beth McGuire: When you guys called, I ... I let myself believe that Laura was still alive. Well, now, I'm-I'm just gonna pray that she's dead. I just don't want to think about the alternative. 
Catherine: Thank you for your help, Beth.
 
Beth McGuire: I gotta call her sister in Denver. This'll be the second time I've gotten her hopes up.
Catherine: There was a first time?
Beth McGuire: Well, there was a double murder the day after Laura went missing. It was about twenty miles outside of Larkston--a Mary Acheson and her daughter, Heather Curtis.  At first, I-I thought it was related to the disappearance of Robin and Laura, but, but it wasn't. 
Catherine: Why didn't you tell us this before?
Beth McGuire: It's a closed case. We got the guy.


 
Beth McGuire: Robert Guffey. Okay ... He's in, uh ... Carson City. He's doing a life term in the Nevada State Prison. Yeah. His bloody fingerprints were all over the crime scene, and he confessed the next day.
Catherine: So you initially thought that Guffey was also good for your friend Laura and her daughter's abduction. What changed your mind?
Beth McGuire: There was no evidence to link him and, uh, he had an alibi. Plus, he would only admit to Heather and Mary's murders.
Nick: How'd he kill them?
Catherine: Stabbed, then shot.
Beth McGuire: This is Heather Curtis. She and her husband lived with Mary Acheson, her mother. So, uh ... Shawn was at work, and then he called home, and then when nobody answered the phone, he knew that something was wrong.
Nick: So the son was home?
Beth McGuire: He was hiding.
 
Beth McGuire: That. That's Robert Guffey.
Nick: So Guffey knew the victims?
Beth McGuire: He was their plumber. Yeah. Old house, bad pipes. Oh, he was there all the time.
Catherine: Says here he has a history of violence.
Beth McGuire: Beat his girlfriend. Oh, yeah, and his ex-wife has a TRO against him. But this is his very first murder. Unless, of course, he killed Addie Finch first. So maybe you're looking for my guy.
Catherine: Was Guffey in Vegas that week?
Beth McGuire: I don't know. I didn't ask him.
Nick: Did you recover a handgun?
Beth McGuire: Yeah. Oh, yeah, at his house. It was a .38, same caliber as your case.
Catherine: But you couldn't match the bullets to it?
Beth McGuire: Reno Lab said that the bullets were too damaged, you know, from bouncing around inside the victims' skulls so they just couldn't get any kind of comparison at all. 
Catherine: I'm assuming you have the blood samples from the two victims?
Beth McGuire: They're at the Reno Lab, but, uh ... I can do you one better. You can take your own samples.

 
 
Beth McGuire: Just a sec, I'm gonna open this thing.
 
Nick: You thinking what I'm thinking?
Catherine: Looks like Addie Finch's house.
 

 
Beth McGuire: Danny and Shawn got an apartment in town. They've never been back here. And Shawn, he can't quite bring himself to sell the place.
Nick: So, nothing inside's been touched in three years?
Beth McGuire: Nope. This door is a time machine.
 

 
Beth McGuire: This blood pool belongs to Mary, the mom. And, uh ... this blood down here belongs to Heather, the daughter.
Nick: Screen door's ripped.
Beth McGuire: Must have been a struggle. We printed it, only got smeared partials.
Catherine: Mary answers the door. The killer forces his way in ... stabs her.
 
Catherine: Heather comes to her mother's aid.
 
Heather Curtis: Mom?
 
Catherine:  Gets stabbed herself.
 
Catherine:  And flees to the kitchen.
 
Nick: The killer finishes Mary off and hunts Heather down.
Catherine: He catches up with Heather and executes her as well.
 
 
Beth McGuire: This is where we found Danny. Poor little guy had peed in his pants. He wouldn't come out to anybody but his dad.
 
Catherine: Is this the phone that you pulled Guffey's prints from?
Beth McGuire: Uh ... yeah. Guffey admitted to having made an anonymous 911 call from the house at 3:20 p.m. And he didn't stick around.
Nick: Whose blood on the door handle?
Beth McGuire: Oh, we tested it. That's a mixture of the victims'.
Nick: I think whoever did this might have seen Danny's toys in the backyard, thought the job wasn't done yet ... and went outside to finish it.
 

 
 
Nick: He shot the rabbits.
Beth McGuire: I believe that Guffey thought that Danny was inside. We got a confession. We didn't need those bullets, so we didn't collect them.
Catherine: So we found one bullet in Addie Finch, you found one in Mary, one in Heather. There're three in this hutch.
Nick: If all these bullets were shot from the same .38, six would kick it. Three murders, one gun, one killer.
Catherine: But was it Guffey, or was it Finch?
Nick: Well, these bullets should answer that question.
Catherine: Let's start digging.

DISSOLVE TO: 

DISSOLVE TO: 
 

Catherine: Hey.
 
Catherine: There's enough here for a comparison.
Nick: Good. Good, if it matches Guffey's gun, he stays in prison, but if it doesn't, we've got no gun to tie to Finch.
Catherine: You need to get all the evidence back to the lab.
 
Nick: What are you gonna do?
Catherine: I'm gonna go see Guffey.
Nick: He's not gonna talk to you, Catherine.
Catherine: We'll see.


 
 
Grissom: Hey, how's it going on your civil case? Did you get a lawyer?
Greg: LVPD said they'll provide me with an attorney.
Grissom: Get your own counsel, Greg. That's your right.
Greg: Well, are you gonna give me a raise? Because otherwise I can't afford that.
Grissom: Call the PPACE, talk to your union rep. This was an on-duty incident. They'll provide you with an attorney.
Greg: How's the union lawyer gonna be any different? 
Grissom: The department's only interest is the department. They'll throw you under the bus to protect themselves. When's your deposition?
Greg: Three weeks from tomorrow.
Grissom: Stick to whatever you put in the report. Don't waiver, be consistent. Everything's gonna be fine.

 
 
Catherine:  Hi, you've reached CSI Catherine Willows. Please leave a message at the tone.
Robbins:  Yeah, Cath, it's Doc Robbins.

 
Robbins:  I reviewed the autopsy photos on all three victims.
 
Robbins:  The wounds appear consistent in all three cases. Vics were stabbed in the chest, and then presumably while choking on their own blood, they were shot. COD for each: single GSW to the head.
 
 
Catherine: Robert Guffey?
 

 
Robert Guffey: I don't know you.
Catherine: You can call me Catherine.
Robert Guffey: Unless you're here for a conjugal, I'm not calling you anything.
Catherine: What do you like to be called?
Robert Guffey: &quot;The best I ever had.&quot;
 
Catherine: There was a murder that was committed in Vegas two days before the Acheson-Curtis murders. I think the same person committed both crimes and I think that person is you. Mr. Guffey, this is how this is going to work. Every time you answer one of my questions, I unbutton a button. Are you ready?
Robert Guffey:  Does that count as a question?
 
Catherine: You recognize this woman?
Robert Guffey: Nope.
 
Robert Guffey:  That's it. Playing ball.
Catherine: Why did you kill Mary Acheson and Heather Curtis?
Robert Guffey: Ah, 'cause sometimes women get killed.
 
Robert Guffey: Oh, don't be like that.
Catherine: Well, that wasn't an answer.
Robert Guffey: It was enough for those other cops.
Catherine: What's that supposed to mean?
Robert Guffey: That, uh, means I didn't do it.
Catherine: Well, then why did you confess?
Robert Guffey: They had me in a room for twelve hours ... no food, no water, no sleep. I had to beg to use the bathroom.
Catherine: So now you're claiming you were coerced.
Robert Guffey: I've been claiming that since day one. I recanted the next morning.  Button.
 
Robert Guffey: That bitch cop ... grabs my arm, points to this vein and says, &quot;That's where the needle will go when they put you down like the dog you are.&quot; If I wanted to avoid the death penalty, all I had to tell her was what she and-and-and her deputies wanted to hear.  That's worth two.
 
Catherine: Just pace yourself. How come your prints were found all over the house?
Robert Guffey: Front door was open ...
 
Robert Guffey: Mary? Mary?!
 

 
Robert Guffey:  There are two dead bodies at the Curtis house. No, no, no, no.

 
Catherine: So you called for help, but didn't stick around.
Robert Guffey: I done ... a few nights in prison for smacking my wife around, my girlfriend before that. I knew how it'd look. No good deed, right? How about just one more for good behavior?
Catherine: Let's see if your story checks out.
 

 
 
Grissom: Hey, Nick.
Nick: Hey.
Grissom: Where's Catherine?
Nick: Not back yet. I got a ride here with a local deputy.
Grissom: She told me she was going to be back before I left.
Nick: Oh, yeah. Listen, about that ... I told my folks when I went to college I'd be back, you know? Go to work at the D.A.'s office with my dad. You can kinda see how that turned out. Anyway, I just wanted to say it's been great, man. 
 
Nick: Really, I've learned a lot from you, man.
Grissom: I'll be back in four weeks. Stop hugging me.
 
Nick: Yes, sir.
 

 
 
 
Nick:  Hey, Catherine, I tested the rabbit bullet to Guffey's gun. No match.


Catherine: He's probably innocent.
Nick: But, but it did match the stria to the bullet that killed Addie Finch.
Catherine: Which brings us back to Jay Finch and his missing .38.
Nick: Yes, ma'am, it does.
Catherine: Well, look, the only way we're gonna get a conviction is we place Finch at the Curtis house. In the meantime, have Brass put a tail on Finch. I'm not sure if he's a flight risk. I don't want to take a chance.
Nick: Okay, okay. And hey, one more thing. Tell the sheriff that I ran the bullet from her abduction case through IBIS and there was no hit as well. Sorry.
Catherine: I'll tell her.
 

 
Catherine: Robert Guffey alleges that he was coerced into a false confession.
Beth McGuire: And you've never heard that one before?
Catherine: Did anything unorthodox happen during his interrogation?
Beth McGuire: What is your point, Catherine?
Catherine: Did you ever do an interrogation tired, Beth? Use your frustration, snap at the suspect just so you can go home? Use all that edge to get a confession?
Beth McGuire: Am I being interrogated now?
Catherine: You questioned Robert Guffey the exact week your best friend and her daughter disappeared. That's not just edge, that's a whole blade.
Beth McGuire: I was sure Guffey was guilty till you showed up. Who admits to a crime he didn't commit? Who does that?
Catherine: People under duress.
Beth McGuire: You come into this town, you make me wrong, and then you go ride off into the sunset. And where does that leave me?
Catherine: With the opportunity to right a wrong.


 
Receptionist: Sir, someone will be with you ...
Adam Novak: Look, I already told you, babe, I ain't going anywhere. So unless you want to have a really screwed-up day, I suggest you get her down here now.

Nick: Mr. Novak.
Adam Novak: Where's Willows?
Nick: Out. How can I help you?
Adam Novak: Why the hell is this department tailing my client? 
Nick: Concern for his safety?
Adam Novak: That's cute. Jay Finch was acquitted of his mother's murder. He deserves all the rights of a free man.
Nick: With all due respect, Mr. Novak, no laws have been broken here.
Adam Novak: You can't try Finch twice for the same crime.
Nick: No, but you can for a different crime.
Adam Novak: Oh, I see. This is a personal vendetta by CSI Willows.
Nick: Personal to who? 
Adam Novak: Me. She's a man-hater. No surprise, but how long do we have to pay for the sins of her father?
Nick: You know, Catherine and I get along just great. Maybe it's you.
Adam Novak: Well, you tell Catherine she continues badgering my client, I will file a claim with the Attorney General's office for oppression under cover of law.
Nick: Duly noted.
 


 
 
Shawn Curtis: What do you mean, he's innocent? He confessed.
Beth McGuire: I screwed up, Shawn.
Shawn Curtis: He dragged their blood through my house and took off. This is bull ... 
 
Shawn Curtis: I spent three years trying to get those memories out of my head. Are you telling me it's gonna start all over again?
Beth McGuire: I get that. I get that, Shawn. I really do. And I wouldn't drag you and Danny out here if it weren't important.
Catherine: Guffey was in your house, but probably after the fact. We believe we know who actually committed the crimes. 
Beth McGuire: And unless we find the evidence that he was in there, we'll never know for sure.
Catherine: Mr. Curtis, your son was the only one that got out alive. He may have seen something.
Shawn Curtis: I don't think I can go in there. How can I ask my son to do it?
Catherine: May I ask him?

Catherine: Thank you.
 
Catherine: Hi, Danny. I'm Catherine. I'm trying to catch the bad guy that hurt your mom and your grandma, and I could really use your help.
Danny: Do you think they're with God?
Catherine: What do you think?
Danny: I think they're still in there.
Catherine: Why?
Danny: They're waiting to fly up to heaven.
Catherine: What are they waiting for?
Danny: For me to say good-bye. 
 
 
 
Danny: Come on, Dad.

Danny: Mom had made cookies.
 
Heather:  Danny, I can hear you. Put the cookie back.


 
Danny: I hid in here.
 
Shawn: He's a lot bigger now. Heather always said he grew fast.
 
Danny: Then there was someone at the door.
 
Mary Acheson: No!
Man: This is my house!
Heather:  Mom, what's going on? Mom?

 

 


 

(Danny sits under the sink.
Catherine: And then what happened, Danny?
Danny: I heard him eat a cookie. Then he went out the back door. I heard some more bangs. Thought he was gone, and then he came back in through the front door, called the police.
 
Beth McGuire: Guffey.
 
Shawn: You did great, buddy.
 
Danny: Say good-bye, Dad.
Shawn: Good-bye, baby.

7:30 p.m.

 
Nick: Hey, Catherine. Wendy found two DNA markers from the bloody fingerprint on the cookie jar. Related females -- Heather and Mary.
Catherine: And the knife?
Nick: Also a match.
Catherine:  We got him, Nick.
 
Catherine: AFIS hit -- Jay Finch.





 

 

 
SWAT Leader: Mr. Finch, Las Vegas Police. Put the knife down. Stand back with your hands up.
 
Jay Finch: What are you doing in my house?
SWAT Leader: Mr. Finch, put the knife down.
Jay Finch: This is my house.
SWAT Leader: I'm not gonna ask you again. Put it down.
Jay Finch: No ...
 
SWAT Leader: Get him.
 
 



 
Catherine: Norman Bates is keeping his mother alive and well.
Nick: Yeah, looks like everything's still in the exact same place. 
Catherine: Including the gun. 
 
Catherine: He kept the gun case in here.
 
Nick: Well, we searched everywhere the first time. He ditched the gun.
 

 
Catherine: In court, he was always writing in his notebook. Now I know why.
 
Nick: Now I think I know why Finch stopped by the Curtis farm. He'd been driving for days. He was exhausted, disoriented. He thought he was home. 
 
Jay Finch: This is my house. MARY ACHESON: No, you have the wrong house.
Jay Finch: What are you doing in my house? MARY ACHESON: I'm sorry, you have the wrong house ...
 
Catherine: Old woman answers the door, denies him access ...
Nick: And all Finch saw was his mom.
Catherine: And then he saw red.
 
Jay Finch: This is my house!
 
Heather Curtis: Mom?
 
 


 
 
Adam Novak: Do you always get what you want?
Catherine:  Clearly not, but you don't have enough tricks in your bag to get him off this time.
Adam Novak: I don't take on cases I don't think I can win.
Catherine: Hey, you really want to defend the innocent? There's a guy doing life up in Carson City that could use an advocate -- Robert Guffey. Might even out your karma.
Adam Novak: Ah, you're worried about me.
Catherine: Just looking to keep my faith in the court system. Everyone deserves justice. If not the first time around, then the second.

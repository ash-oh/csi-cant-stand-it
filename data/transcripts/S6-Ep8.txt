<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p><strong>Reporter (woman)</strong>: (V.O.) This is Channel 8 news ... </p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY] </p>
<p>(A news helicopter flies overhead.) </p>
<p><strong>Reporter (woman)</strong>: (V.O.) ... reporting with an update to yesterday's wild police pursuit and shootout where three suspects and one police officer were killed by gunfire at Third and Jefferson ... </p>
<p>[EXT. MOTEL - PARKING LOT - DAY]</p>
<p>(Camera close-up of the long, thin line of blood on the asphalt. Camera follows the blood trail straight to Jose Fausto, dead on the ground.) </p>
<p><strong>Reporter (woman)</strong>: (V.O.) ... Shortly after being taken into custody, Jose Fausto, the last suspect, was gunned down by an unknown ... </p>
<p>[EARLIER]</p>
<p>[Scene from 6X07: A Bullet Runs Through It (1)]</p>
<p>(A gunshot rings out. A woman screams. Warrick is spattered with blood from Jose Fausto.)</p>
<p><strong>Cavaliere</strong>: Down! Everybody down! Down!</p>
<p>(Officers scramble, their guns raised and looking around for the shooter.) </p>
<p>(Camera lingers on Jose Fausto, dead on the parking lot ground.) </p>
<p>[EXT. MOTEL - PARKING LOT - DAY -- PRESENT]</p>
<p>(Officers tape up the parking lot crime scene. Warrick and Cavaliere kneel down next to the body.) </p>
<p><strong>Cavaliere</strong>: Somebody shot this guy in front of all these cops? They did not want him talking to us.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: This was not some doped up drive-by. The shooter had skill. Just one shot went through the ten ring. </p>
<p><strong>Cavaliere</strong>: How'd they know Fausto was here?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Cavaliere</strong>: I bet you he tried to reach out for help, you know? Maybe money or a ticket out of here.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'll check the phone records and see if there was any calls in or out.</p>
<p><strong>Cavaliere</strong>: Glad I'm not Vartann. He's got to tell the undersheriff.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY - DAY]</p>
<p>(Vartann and Undersheriff McKeen are walking through the hallway as Vartann delivers the bad news.) </p>
<p><strong>Undersheriff McKeen</strong>: Are you seriously telling me our only live suspect, a cop killer, was gunned down in your custody?</p>
<p><strong>Vartann</strong>: I'm sorry to say yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>Undersheriff McKeen</strong>: And you didn't catch the shooter?</p>
<p><strong>Vartann</strong>: That's also correct, sir.</p>
<p><strong>Undersheriff McKeen</strong>: Stop calling me sir, you worthless ... (He sighs.) </p>
<p>(They turn and walk into the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Undersheriff McKeen</strong>: Where's Grissom?</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: He's on his way.</p>
<p><strong>Undersheriff McKeen</strong>: All right, let's start without him.</p>
<p>(On the wall monitor are large photos of Jose Fausto, dead on the parking lot ground.) </p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Inside the conference room, Nestor Ortega presents his findings to Undersherrif McKeen, Ecklie and Vartann.) </p>
<p><strong>Nestor Ortega</strong>: Sergeant Adams and Officer Bell were making a routine traffic stop on a Buick. Before they were able to effect the stop, a stolen Caprice intervened.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [EXT. STREET - DAY]</p>
<p>[All flashbacks are scenes from 6X07: A Bullet Runs Through It (1)]</p>
<p>(A dark Caprice turns in front of the officers.) </p>
<p><strong>Nestor Ortega</strong>: (V.O.) Adams said they just cut him off and started firing.</p>
<p>(Gunfire erupts from the dark Caprice.) </p>
<p>(Additional officer cars join behind them.) </p>
<p><strong>Nestor Ortega</strong>: (V.O.) They were followed in pursuit by Officers Davis and Carroll and Detectives Brass and Curtis.</p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Nestor Ortega</strong>: The, uh, Caprice TC'd during the pursuit.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The dark Caprice flips over.) </p>
<p><strong>Nestor Ortega</strong>: (V.O.) And they just kept firing.</p>
<p>(The gunmen crawl out of the car and continue firing at the officers.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Vartann</strong>: We got three of them off of prints. Priors for narcotics and connections to the Mexican mafia.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: And additional set of prints from the Caprice came back to Jose Fausto, the guy shot at the motel.</p>
<p><strong>Undersheriff McKeen</strong>: I've heard enough about him. Why would these knuckleheads pull in front of a police car making a traffic stop and engage us in a gunfight?</p>
<p><strong>Nestor Ortega</strong>: If the Buick was moving drugs, maybe the Caprice was providing security, keeping the cops and rival gang members away.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: We don't have the Buick, so there's no evidence to confirm that.</p>
<p><strong>Undersheriff McKeen</strong>: Well, if these guys were a bunch of drug-dealing thugs, why on the news were they unarmed and we shot 'em in the back?</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Because that's what the eyewitnesses are saying.</p>
<p><strong>Undersheriff McKeen</strong>: Oh. And that we shot an innocent high school kid riding his bike.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Uh, Ricardo Estevez, male Hispanic, 22, shot in the alley east of Third.</p>
<p>(Ecklie circles the area on the map on the table.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [ALLEY BACK OF THIRD (EAST) - DAY] The gunman in a white t-shirt is shot.)</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: (V.O.) Three entrance wounds to the front torso, none to the back.</p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Ballistics matched the bullets to Sergeant Carroll's gun. Recovered a .45 auto next to the body.</p>
<p>(The overhead shows evidence marker #14 next to a gun by the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Nestor Ortega</strong>: Captain Brass states the suspect had it pointed at the sergeant when he came around the corner.</p>
<p><strong>Vartann</strong>: Now, we have eyewitnesses who claim that they saw the suspect with his hands raised just before he was shot.</p>
<p><strong>Undersheriff McKeen</strong>: Can we resolve this?</p>
<p><strong>Nestor Ortega</strong>: Sergeant Carroll partially confirms eyewitness accounts. When Captain Brass approached, he momentarily took his eyes off the suspect. When he looked back, the suspect was holding a gun.</p>
<p><strong>Vartann</strong>: Probably pulled it from his waistband.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: There's no evidence to place the gun in the suspect's hand at that point.</p>
<p><strong>Undersheriff McKeen</strong>: What about the guy in the other alley?</p>
<p>(He circles the area on the satellite surveillance photos.)</p>
<p>(Camera zooms into the photo for a flashback: The gunman in the black tank is shot.) </p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: (V.O.) Salvador Rosario, 19, also shot in the front.</p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Autopsy's pending. Chemical tests show that he held a gun. You're not going to believe this. A bullet from Officer Davis' gun hit the suspect's revolver, jamming the cylinder.</p>
<p><strong>Undersheriff McKeen</strong>: That would mean the revolver had to be pointing at Officer Davis.</p>
<p><strong>Vartann</strong>: There are several eyewitnesses who claim that they saw him plant the gun on the body.</p>
<p><strong>Nestor Ortega</strong>: It wasn't planted. It was mishandled.</p>
<p><strong>Undersheriff McKeen</strong>: Mishandled by who?</p>
<p><strong>Nestor Ortega</strong>: Contrary to policy, Officer Davis prematurely picked up the gun.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [ALLEY BACK OF THIRD (WEST) - DAY]</p>
<p>(Officer David picks up the gun.) </p>
<p><strong>Nestor Ortega</strong>: (V.O.) Detective Curtis instructed him to set it back down, which he did.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: What are you doing? Put it down.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Davis</strong>: Sorry, I was just trying to secure his gun.</p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: An eyewitness seeing that certainly could misinterpret it as planting a gun.</p>
<p>(Grissom walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Undersheriff McKeen</strong>: : Please tell me you've got some good news.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I have the autopsy findings on Leandro Chavez. He died of survivable wounds. Bled out at the crime scene waiting for transport.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Leandro Chavez is shot in the thigh. He talks to the officer watching him.) </p>
<p><strong>Leandro Chavez</strong>: Dame una ambulanica quey.</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: I don't speak Spanish.</p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Vartann</strong>: There's justification for this.</p>
<p><strong>Undersheriff McKeen</strong>: I can't wait to hear what that is.</p>
<p><strong>Vartann</strong>: Paramedics prioritized transport of the injured. Downed officer first, civilians next. By the time they got to the suspect, he'd passed on. You know, just a little retroactive birth control.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: See, this is the problem that the community has with us. You don't speak Spanish, so you think they don't speak English and then when you run your mouth ...</p>
<p><strong>Undersheriff McKeen</strong>: All right, keep on point here. Which one of these buttheads shot Officer Bell?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We have reason to believe that Officer Bell was killed by friendly fire.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Officer Bell is shot and falls to the ground. End of flashback.) </p>
<p>(Various photos of Officer Bell on the ground at the crime scene are shown overhead.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It was a through-and-through, and we haven't recovered the bullet yet. It's a big crime scene.</p>
<p><strong>Undersheriff McKeen</strong>: Unacceptable. Get back out there and find that bullet. I don't care if it takes everybody you got working around the clock.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I said we haven't found it yet. I didn't say we weren't looking.</p>
<p>FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Grissom and Undersheriff McKeen are walking through the hallway.) </p>
<p><strong>Undersheriff McKeen</strong>: Just do whatever it takes to find that bullet. Don't worry about the overtime. (He glances at his watch.) As soon as day shift comes in, I'll send them out, too.</p>
<p>(Undersherrif McKeen leaves down the hallway. Grissom meets up with Bobby Dawson and they continue down the hallway.) </p>
<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: Hey, Grissom. So Warrick recovered a nine-millimeter pistol from Fausto's motel room, and I matched it to the cartridge case from the kid in the hospital. I also found the kid's bike there.</p>
<p>(Bobby Dawson turns the corner and leaves. Grissom walks into his office.)</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - GRISSOM'S OFFICE - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Grissom mutters to himself.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Shot him in the back for his bike. Great.</p>
<p>(Grissom moves behind his desk.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: (o.s.) Hey.</p>
<p>(Grissom looks up and sees Sofia in his office.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: I left you a couple of messages.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Oh, yeah ... I haven't gotten to them yet. Sorry. You're on administrative leave, though. You should be home getting some rest.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Yeah, I tried. But I ... can't stop thinking about this ... this Bell shooting.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's understandable.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Grissom, I think there may be a possibility that maybe ... I shot him.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sofia ... we can't discuss the investigation.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: (interrupts) It's, it's something I remember when I was giving my statement.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Then it's already on the record.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: No, something I didn't mention.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sofia ...</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: (interrupts) Please listen to me. Bell was between me and the suspect. I was shooting over his cover, which is a violation of policy. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [GUNFIRE] Sofia is firing her gun. Officer Bell falls to the ground. End of flashback.)</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: I was, I was just trying to stay alive. But if I did it, I ...</p>
<p>(Sara walks into Grissom's office.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey, Grissom, I have a question.</p>
<p>(She stops when she sees Sofia.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Sofia? You're on administrative leave.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You should not be in this building.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: I was just talking to a friend. If I can't talk to a friend, who the hell am I supposed to talk to?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Any friend outside the department.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: And how many friends outside of work do you have, Sara? Maybe I should go talk to my mother. Oh, no, sorry. I forgot. She's a cop, too.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I can recommend a departmental psychologist.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: All right, then. This was a really bad idea. I'm sorry.</p>
<p>(Sofia turns and leaves the office.) </p>
<p>(Sara turns and looks at Grissom.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[EXT. MOTEL - PARKING LOT -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Detective Cavaliere walks over to Warrick.) </p>
<p><strong>Chris Cavaliere</strong>: Hey, listen. One of the officers searching for the shooter found an expended cartridge up there on the seventh floor.</p>
<p>(He points to a building across the street. Warrick looks down at the bloodstain on the ground, then back up at the building.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: That would put him in the right position.</p>
<p>(Cavaliere is already moving in that direction. Warrick follows him.) </p>
<p><strong>Chris Cavaliere</strong>: Freemont Street's not far. It makes for an easy escape.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. MOTEL ACROSS THE STREET -- HALLWAY / ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Detective Cavaliere and Warrick walk through the hallway. They pass by the officer standing outside the door of the room where the cartridge was found.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (to the officer) Good job.</p>
<p>(They walk through the main room and into the bedroom. There, on the floor is the cartridge.) </p>
<p>(Warrick looks at the cartridge, then out the window. It's an unobstructed view to the parking lot.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Nice.</p>
<p>(He puts a ruler down next to the cartridge and snaps some photos of it before picking it up.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: .223 Remington. Most likely from a semi-auto.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Cavaliere</strong>: Didn't even bother to pick it up.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah. Wasn't afraid of getting caught. I'll give it to Bobby. Have him run it through IBIS. See if the gun was used before.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. MOTEL - PARKING LOT -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Out in the parking lot, the area is bustling with observers and officers.) </p>
<p><strong>Cavaliere</strong>: (over radio) Vartann, this is Cavaliere. We've recovered an expended .223 cartridge case from a building overlooking the motel. It's on its way to the lab now. Scene here is secure. Patrol just called. They found a 411-a behind 5203 Maryland Parkway. Sounds like it might be the Buick Regal. I'm going to head over there now.</p>
<p>(Inside the car, Brass is listening to the police band radio.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. ALLEYWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Officer cars block the alleyway. In the center is a smoking car burned to a crisp.) </p>
<p><strong>Chris Cavaliere</strong>: Buick Regal, no plates. You run the VIN?</p>
<p><strong>Patrol Officer</strong>: Yeah. It came up stolen.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Cavaliere</strong>: Yeah. It's a good chance this is the car we're looking for.</p>
<p>(He looks inside.) </p>
<p><strong>Chris Cavaliere</strong>: Yep. Torched it to destroy any evidence. Let's get this thing towed back to the lab, okay?</p>
<p><strong>Patrol Officer</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. STREET - DAY]</p>
<p>(Sergeant Adams is with Nestor Ortega and Catherine. They're walking through the EASY AUTO PARTS parking lot as Sergeant Adams shows them what happened.) </p>
<p><strong>Nestor Ortega</strong>: Sergeant Adams, this is your standard after-shooting walk through, okay? Now I want you to describe to us exactly what happened yesterday morning.</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. Adams</strong>: We were southbound on Roosevelt. Bell observed a male and female Hispanic having a domestic dispute.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Where were they?</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. Adams</strong>: Over in that last spot.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: A man grabs a pregnant woman by her hair and pushes her into he car.) </p>
<p><strong>Sgt. Adams</strong>: (V.O.) They got out of a green Geo Metro. Walked this way. By the time we'd turned around, they'd gotten into the Buick Regal.</p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Sgt. Adams</strong>: They were driving away. She was pregnant, about to pop, just like Bell's wife. He said we should pull 'em over.</p>
<p><strong>Nestor Ortega</strong>: Which way'd they go?</p>
<p><strong>Sgt. Adams</strong>: Southbound on Roosevelt. As soon as we turned on Desert Springs, the Caprice cut us off.</p>
<p><strong>Nestor Ortega</strong>: Okay, thanks. Hey, hang around for about a minute or two, okay? I'll give you a ride home.</p>
<p>(Sgt. Adams steps aside as Ortega turns to Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Nestor Ortega</strong>: Your thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I wonder if that camera works.</p>
<p>(Catherine points to the security camera nearby. Ortega turns to look.) </p>
<p><strong>Nestor Ortega</strong>: Well, it's worth checking out. Come on. I'll even let you buy me a donut.</p>
<p>(Ortega walks out of camera frame.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(The bullets gathered from the crime scenes are lined up on the table and labeled. Also on the table is a clipboard and photos of the crime scene area.) </p>
<p>(Greg writes down something on one of the photos.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(Grissom walks into the lab from the hallway. Greg reports.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I got to the end of my road.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, the suspect started shooting near the intersection of Jefferson and Desert Springs. That's nearly 20 blocks north of the crime scene. All ammo evidence was 7.62-millimeter casings and bullets.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Only AK ammo? No police cartridge cases or bullets?</p>

<p>(Grissom thinks about it, then stands up.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Can you see me here?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah, I can see you.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, now.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What would make Bell stand up in the middle of a gunfight?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Maybe he had to change positions. We know that the suspects were starting to run, right?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay, he popped up, took one in the vest.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Let's assume that. We'll line up the exit trajectories with the apartment window, and we'll use lasers, but we may have to wait until it's dark.</p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO: </p>
<p>[EXT. MAIN CRIME SCENE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(It's dark. Grissom has a dummy positioned where Officer Bell stood behind his car door. In the dummy's neck is a laser rod.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (to phone) We're turning on the lasers. Is the candle in position?</p>
<p>(Inside the Torres' residence, Greg is in the living room and on the phone.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (to phone) I'm ready on this end. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (to phone) Let me know when the beam hits the candle. (to Grissom)<br />
Good to go!</p>
<p>(Down on the street, Grissom turns the laser light on.) </p>
<p>(In the Torres' apartment, Greg keeps his eye on the beam.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (to phone) Uh ... good height. Move it six inches to the left.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (to Grissom) Six inches to the left.</p>
<p>(Grissom moves the beam. Greg turns and sees the light going in the wrong direction, away from the candle.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (to phone) Oh, no, no. My left.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (to Grissom) He meant the other left.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: A little more. Little more. (The beam hits the candle.) Right there. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Perfect. (to phone) I'll call you back.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Okay, we got the exit. Now we need the entrance. Sara, turn your laser on.</p>
<p>(Sara turns her laser on. Grissom can't find the beam. He holds up his hand and sees the beam is completely off.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The path of my laser is off.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, it's a bad angle. Move it to the left.</p>
<p>(Sara tries, but can't.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Gris ...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It's blocked by the car. It's not possible.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Turn it off. Nick, turn yours on.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mine's been on the whole time. It's still blocked.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Raise it up. </p>
<p>(Nick raises the laser. It hits the dummy perfectly. Grissom and Nick both look at the path of the beams.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: He stood up.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [SHOOTOUT] Brass fires. As the suspect runs, Brass stands. He follows the line of sight of the suspect running.)</p>
<p>(He fires.)</p>
<p>(And hits Officer Bell in the neck.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p>(Everyone is silent.) </p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. BRASS' RESIDENCE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Grissom sits in his car waiting for Brass. Brass steps out and gets into the car.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hey. Well, your call was a little cryptic. Must've got the results from the ballistics test.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We did, but it was inconclusive, so I went back to the intersection and ran a reconstruction.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, I don't know how you reconstruct a war zone. You have no idea what it was like. I mean, it was a firefight. Have you talked to Sofia? </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It wasn't Sofia. You must have stood up ... fired at the suspects over the black and whites. Officer Bell stood up at the same time, right into your line of fire. Fausto shot him in the vest, which spun him a little. At the same time, you hit him in the neck.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (sighs) Oh, I-I swear, I was behind the car, I ... I-I stood up?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sheriff wants me to present our findings at a community meeting in an hour.</p>
<p>(Brass sighs.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Don't keep 'em waiting.</p>
<p>(Brass gets out of the car and leaves. He slams the car door behind him.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - OFFICE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Nestor Ortega talks with Sofia.) </p>
<p><strong>Nestor Ortega</strong>: I just received a report from the shooting review board. You've been cleared. (He gives her back her gun and her badge.) You can go back to work.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>(She takes her gun and her badge off the desk.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. COMMUNITY CHURCH (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. COMMUNITY CHURCH -- DAY] </p>
<p>(The church is filled with every seat taken. Reporters line the back. Grissom is standing up front to deliver his report.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hello. My name is Dr. Gil Grissom. I'm the night shift supervisor for the Las Vegas Police Department's Crime Lab. I'm not a police officer; I'm a scientist.</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: You work for the cops. That makes you a cop. You're not on our side.</p>
<p>(The audience clamors. Grissom waits for them to quiet down.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Actually, I'm a forensics expert. My job is to identify, collect, and examine physical evidence from a crime scene, to determine who did what to whom and how did they do it. I've been asked to come here today by the mayor and Sheriff Burdick to present our analysis of the evidence in this case to your community.</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: Why aren't they here? Why should we believe your evidence?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Physical evidence cannot be wrong. It doesn't lie. It's not influenced by emotion or prejudice. It's ... it's not confused by the excitement of the moment. I'm here, in God's house, to explain to you the truth about exactly what happened the other day. I'd like to start by showing you some photos. (Grissom shows the bullet on screen.) This is a bullet that was recovered from the Kevlar vest of Officer Daniel Bell, now deceased.</p>
<p>(Danilo Zamesca stands up.) </p>
<p><strong>Danilo Zamesca</strong>: (interrupts) What about my son? What-what does the evidence say about my son?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Okay, if you like, we can start there.</p>
<p><strong>Danilo Zamesca</strong>: Please.</p>
<p>(Grissom moves over to the second display.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This photo is a comparison of two cartridge cases. The one on the right was found next to your son. The one on the left was test-fired from Jose Fausto's pistol. As you can see, there are corresponding individual marks on both cartridges. These are unique, like fingerprints. It means that they were fired from the same gun. It proves that while attempting to escape from the police ... Jose Fausto shot your son Geraldo in the back.</p>
<p><strong>Danilo Zamesca</strong>: Why would he do that?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We recovered your son's bicycle from Jose Fausto's motel room. Your son was on his way to football practice.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY] Geraldo Zamesca is on his bike and riding down the sidewalk. Jose Fausto shoots him in the back. End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It appears that Jose Fausto shot your son so he could use his bike.</p>
<p>(Danilo Zamesca is quiet. He sits down.) </p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO: </p>
<p>[EXT. NEVADA MOUNTAINS (STOCK) -- DAY] </p>
<p>[EXT. COMMUNITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. BELL RESIDENCE - DAY]</p>
<p>(The side table is filled with framed family photos. The house is filled with family and friends there to support Tracy Bell and her family.) </p>
<p>(In the foyer is a large framed photo of Officer Bell in uniform.) </p>
<p>(Brass walks in. He's dressed in uniform as well.)</p>
<p>(Undersheriff McKeen is talking with Nestor Ortega. They both notice Brass. Brass removes his hat.) </p>
<p>(Sofia walks up to him.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Jim, I was just on my way out, but if you want me to stay ...</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No, I-I think I can handle it. I think. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(Sofia leaves. Brass walks in. The officers there clear away from him as he makes his way around the room. No one approaches him.)</p>
<p>(Brass sits down and puts his hand down on the seat next to him. The other officers stare at him. Brass fiddles nervously with his fingers.) </p>
<p>(Nestor Ortega takes the seat next to Brass.) </p>
<p><strong>Nestor Ortega</strong>: The shooting review board wants to talk to you. You're going to have to explain your tactical decision for shooting in the direction of a fellow officer.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'm ready when they are.</p>
<p><strong>Nestor Ortega</strong>: As far as I'm concerned, there's no question ... it was a bad shoot. </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'll have to live with that.</p>
<p>(Nestor Ortega stands up and leaves.) </p>
<p>(Brass looks over and sees Tracy Bell in the next room drying her tears. She steps out and heads into the main room.)</p>
<p>(Just then, Jeannie Bell skips and trips in front of Brass. He quickly reaches out and catches her from falling.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, whoa! Hey. What's your name?</p>
<p><strong>Jeannie Bell</strong>: Jeannie.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, that's a pretty name. (Tracy sees Brass with Jeannie and smiles.)<br />
Is that your mom over there?</p>
<p>(Jeannie nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Huh? Okay, be careful, Jeannie ...</p>
<p>(The officer standing next to Tracy leans over and whispers into her ear. Tracy looks over at Brass. Brass stands up and walks over to her.) </p>
<p>(The room gets quiet as everyone watches them. Tracy walks up to Brass.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Mrs. Bell ... I'm Jim Brass.</p>
<p><strong>Tracy Bell</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (voice breaking) I want you to know ... if there's, um ... if there's any, um ... </p>
<p>(She holds up her hand and stops him.) </p>
<p>(She reaches out and holds him as she cries.) </p>
<p><strong>Tracy Bell</strong>: (whispers) I know it wasn't your fault.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (crying) I ... I'm ... I'm so sorry.</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>
<p><strong>End</strong></p>

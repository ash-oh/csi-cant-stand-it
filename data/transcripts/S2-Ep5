[INT. APARTMENT COMPLEX - HALLWAY - DAY]</p>
<p>(The resident manager enters the darkened hallway of the apartment complex with two prospective renters, STEVE and NANCY.)</p>
<p><strong>Stu Evans</strong>: You'll like this apartment. My wife says it's the best of the lot. Now, the tenants moved out kind of quick so I don't normally show apartments before I've had a chance to look, so ... use your imagination.</p>
<p>(He unlocks the door to apartment #103 and pushes it open for STEVE and NANCY to look at. They both step inside ... aghast at what they see. There's blood on the walls and on the floor.)</p>
<p><strong>Nancy</strong>: (to STEVE) Oh, my god. Call 911.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. APARTMENT #103 - DAY]</p>
<p>(Camera close up of BRASS.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I worked in a slaughterhouse one summer. Looked a lot like this. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM is also standing in the middle of the room. He's not looking at the walls, he's busy testing the blood.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (V.O.) The lease is in the name of Clifford Renteria. He lived here with his girlfriend till they snuck out in the middle of the night. Gee, I wonder why.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: For all we know, this is animal blood.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, sure. Deer, sheep, llama.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: A deer hunter comes home from the mountains drunk decides to play butcher clean his kill. Chops his game up into oven-sized pieces for the winter. I mean, what does he care? He's renting.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM drops a small sample of the mixture into the hand-held test and waits for the results. BRASS uses his flashlight and shines it on the test. Results of the test indicate that the victim was definitely &quot;human&quot;.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Victim's human.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And a human has only eight pints of blood. So, whoever the victim is ... is now dead.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER. ROLL TITLE CREDITS.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<hr />
[INT. APARTMENT -- DAY]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM is looking through a small instrument used to measure the blood spatter.)</p>
<p>(QUICK CGI through the end of the instrument, up to GRISSOM'S eye, fade back down to the end of the magnifying lens to measure the blood spatter where 1 DIV = 1 MM. 20X. Flash to white. Resume on GRISSOM looking at the blood on the wall.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (o.s.) Any uniformity in the spray?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, by and large, the average diameter is about one millimeter.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Blood drops this size are characteristic of high-velocity impact like gunshot trauma but there's no bullet strikes on the walls ... ruling out murder by gun.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Just acquaint yourself, Sara. Don't interpret just yet, okay?</p>
<p>(SARA continues to look around the room. WARRICK is busy spraying luminol on the entire floor. When he's finished, he puts the spray canister down.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: All right. Show time.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM closes the shades disturbing a single fly which buzzes off. SARA,<br />
WARRICK and GRISSOM wait while the luminol begins to glow.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: This looks like a multiple. More than one vic. Acquainting myself.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Check out these &quot;voids.&quot; That's the real evidence.</p>
<p>(From the top view of the room, the entire floor glows except for certain &quot;voids&quot;.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Couch? We've only got 30 seconds till this luminol disappears.</p>
<p>(SARA starts taking pictures of the &quot;voids&quot; and anything else pertinent. </p>
<p>GRISSOM kneels to get a better look at the &quot;voids&quot; where he's standing.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Television, maybe? A magazine?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Triangle ... coat rack?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Guys ... </p>
<p>(Right where WARRICK is standing is an irregular shaped &quot;void&quot;.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What do you think that is?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Looks like it could be an electric saw.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: High-velocity, small spray.</p>
<p>(Close up on the &quot;void&quot; of the electric saw as it disappears ... )</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. MOJAVE DESERT NEAR LAKE MEAD -- DAY]</p>
<p>(On the other side of the power lines, the hills are on fire. A helicopter flying by drops water on the flames. The camera travels low along the ground and moves upward as the helicopter with red bucket passes by.)</p>
<p>(In the background we hear radio static and various radio dispatch transmissions.)</p>
<p><strong>Radio Dispatcher</strong>: 76 ROMEO, approaching ETS 4-NINER-SIX.</p>
<p><strong>Pine Ridge Command</strong>: 76 ROMEO, you're right on it.</p>
<p>76 ROMEO: Pine ridge command, go to white fire three. Dozer tender 1441. Air attack 140. O.V. Tens on order. Report to willow springs.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(NICK and CATHERINE carrying their CSI kits, pass by a group of fire fighters to get to the crime scene.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Zero humidity, record highs. 'Tis the season.</p>
<p>(They both meet up with DET. O'RILEY.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>Det. O'Riley</strong>: Hey. I don't even know where to start with this one. Take a look at that. A scuba diver ... up a tree.</p>
<p>(True to form, there's a dead person in scuba gear stuck up in a tree. The CSIs, DET. O'RILEY and DAVID PHILLIPS all look up at the figure in astonishment.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Wow.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: How the hell he'd got up there?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE is holding yellow evidence markers in her hand and is looking on the ground for anything unusual.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: He couldn't have climbed up there with all that crap on.</p>
<p><strong>Det. O'Riley</strong>: He got up there somehow.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, you know ... Lake Mead is just over the hill and the copters are dropping water.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks up at the helicopter and bucket whirring by. She turns to NICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You're serious?</p>
<p>(NICK smiles.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: That's a total urban legend. We're scientists, Nickie. No way that happened.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (looking up) Okay.</p>
<p>(Cut to CGI POV of a scuba diver in Lake Mead and a large red bucket being dropped into the lake. End of CGI POV. Resume on CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And I suppose you believe in Santa?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: After today ... oh, yeah.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. APARTMENT COMPLEX - HALLWAY JUST OUTSIDE APT #103 - DAY]</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: When I said Cliff Renteria and his girlfriend skipped out in the middle of the night, I didn't have the whole story. </p>
<p><strong>Stu Evans</strong>: I haven't seen Alison in over a month.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Any idea where she might be?</p>
<p><strong>Stu Evans</strong>: Renteria said she left town.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So you noticed that she was gone?</p>
<p><strong>Stu Evans</strong>: I manage the complex. I notice everything.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did you notice if Mr. Renteria left a forwarding address?</p>
<p><strong>Stu Evans</strong>: No. He just wrote the letter saying he was moving on. Listen, if you find him, you tell him he is not getting his deposit back, okay? The blood'll never come out.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hopefully not. That's all the evidence we have.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. MOJAVE DESERT NEAR LAKE MEAD -- DAY]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE searches the grounds for evidence. A helicopter whirs (o.s.) overhead. CATHERINE finds something and puts evidence marker #1 next to the scuba diver's pressure gauge. The needle is frozen stuck. She takes pictures of the pressure gauge.)</p>
<p>(Cut to NICK as he crouches low to the ground. CATHERINE approaches.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What do you make of that void? Green vegetation.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: There's a consistent burn over this whole area.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Except for that one spot.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, the chief said that the original fire was a class &quot;C.&quot; Downed power line. Winds keep shifting hot spots breaking out all over.</p>
<p>(NICK looks around and notices a burned cigarette butt and matchbook.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, well ... downed power line, huh?</p>
<p>(He motions to CATHERINE. She looks at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Good eye.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE puts down evidence marker #3 next to the matchbook and snaps a photograph of it. NICK picks the matchbook up.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Matchbook time-delay device.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Don't touch it. It'll disintegrate.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: That's the only reason I carry this stuff.</p>
<p>(NICK pulls out an aerosol can.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hair spray. Extra hold?</p>
<p>(CGI POV Close up of Hair spray adhering to the burnt matchbook sticks, coating them.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: The difference between walking and running. Guy lights a cigarette, sticks it in a matchbook takes a stroll.</p>
<p>(CGI POV of a newly lit cigarette being wedged under the matchbook sticks. Flash to white. Close up of the matchbook and cigarette on the ground. Flash to white. Close up of fire consuming both the matchbook and the cigarette. Flash to white. Resume on NICK and CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It buys an arsonist a five-minute head start.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. MONACO RECEIVING -- DAY]</p>
<p>(BRASS exits his car (Nevada license #IEP-353). He and GRISSOM approach CLIFFORD RENTERIA.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Monaco Receiving. Clifford Renteria, platform manager.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Gee, Brass, all in one shift. I'm impressed.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Are you Clifford Renteria?</p>
<p><strong>Clifford Renteria</strong>: Cliff. Who are you?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Las Vegas police. With the crime lab. Do you have any knowledge of the whereabouts of Alison Scott?</p>
<p><strong>Clifford Renteria</strong>: She's in Canada visiting her parents. Why?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We just came from your old apartment. We found some disturbing evidence there. Would you care to explain that?</p>
<p><strong>Clifford Renteria</strong>: Hey, he had it coming. I'll tell you that right now. Apartment stank, there were flies everywhere, no water. So I trashed the place.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Who had it coming?</p>
<p><strong>Clifford Renteria</strong>: The apartment manager. The lazy b*st*rd. Serves him right.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mr. Renteria, your apartment walls are covered in human blood. Are you aware of that?</p>
<p><strong>Clifford Renteria</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Do you have an explanation?</p>
<p><strong>Clifford Renteria</strong>: It's my blood.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Your blood?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You got a stigmata?</p>
<p><strong>Clifford Renteria</strong>: No. I get nosebleeds.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Nosebleeds?</p>
<p><strong>Clifford Renteria</strong>: From Hepatitis C. I got blood to spare. My nose is like old faithful. Finally came in handy.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You expirated blood from your nose all over your apartment walls to get back at your manager?</p>
<p><strong>Clifford Renteria</strong>: Yeah. I hope I made his clean-up job hell.</p>
<p>(A noise from behind him distracts CLIFF RENTERIA. He turns around and sees a worker.)</p>
<p><strong>Clifford Renteria</strong>: (to worker) That's not supposed to go anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: This guy blows ten quarts of blood from his nose onto his wall? You want to ask for a demonstration?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He's lying. Expirating from your nose would leave oval-shaped blood patterns. The ones we found in his apartment were V-shaped.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Mr. Renteria. We're going to need a sample of your blood -- from your arm, not your nose -- and a visit to your new apartment.</p>
<p>(CLIFFORD RENTERIA motions to the large truck #84438 behind them.)</p>
<p><strong>Clifford Renteria</strong>: That's home to me now. Been staying there about a week.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, may we see your furniture?</p>
<p><strong>Clifford Renteria</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. TRAILER]</p>
<p>(From inside the truck, the back opens and we see all CLIFFORD RENTERIA'S worldly possessions crammed in the back of the trailer-truck.)</p>
<p>(Camera cut to looking into the truck from the outside. We immediately see an electric saw in front of a large monitor-sized box with the label DM(TM) 604 S2.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Electric saw.</p>
<p><strong>Clifford Renteria</strong>: Used to do some landscaping.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Interesting lamp. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mr. Renteria, with your permission, I'd like to move some of your property to my lab for a closer inspection.</p>
<p><strong>Clifford Renteria</strong>: Hey, save me $250 a week truck rental. Keep it as long as you want. I'll sleep in the break room.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: That's after you come down and give us that blood sample.</p>
<p>(The truck door closes to black.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - LAB]</p>
<p>(Four people carrying various things walk by the glass lab wall. WARRICK walks into the lab carrying a large white box with the words &quot;PROPERTY OF FIREARMS&quot; written in black on the side. WARRICK is wearing a white jumper suit. SARA is also wearing the same type of white jumper suit.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You check nosebleed's tools yet?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No observable blood. Not even with pheno.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: That's because he probably ditched them after using them on the victim. Now we've just got to figure out which one.</p>
<p>(WARRICK puts the box down. It's filled with various types of electric saws.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: How long did Firearms give us these for?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Twenty-four hours, then we've got to get them back. Clean.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Let's do it.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(WARRICK zips up his white jumper, secures his gloves, turns the radio up.)</p>
<p>(Cut to SARA zips up her white jumper. WARRICK puts on his head gear with goggles.)</p>
<p>(Cut to SARA with her head goggles on mixes the paint they're going to use.)</p>
<p>(Cut to WARRICK pouring the paint in a large plastic container that they'll be dipping the saws in.)</p>
<p>(Cut to SARA dipping in a saw with a small round blade into red paint. Behind her, WARRICK is holding a different kind of saw.)</p>
<p>(Cut to SARA holding the saw with paint against a clear pexi-glass board backing. She turns the saw on and lets the paint spatter onto the backing.)</p>
<p>(Cut to Close up of a saw blade being dipped in paint.)</p>
<p>(Cut to WARRICK holding the electric saw against a clear pexi-glass board backing. He turns the saw on and it spatters paint onto the backing.)</p>
<p>(WARRICK and SARA repeat this test using the different saws in the box.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - GREG'S LAB]</p>
<p>(Close up on GREG.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (o.s.) So?</p>
<p>(GREG looks up and sees GRISSOM standing there. He didn't hear him enter.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: DNA results, um ... sixteen samples from the apartment walls and the one we just took from the guy's arm.</p>
<p>(GREG puts aside what he's working on, finds the file and hands it to GRISSOM. GRISSOM opens the file to review the findings.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This cannot be right.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Hey, I always double-check your stuff. But all the results are pointing one way.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What about the blood on the lamp?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: That is my next run. Just a little backlogged.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, get through it. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM leaves. GREG sighs.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT -- HALLWAY]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and BRASS walk through the hallway. GRISSOM is holding the file folder.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I thought you said the blood on those walls couldn't be his.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I also thought the metric system would catch on. Look, everything that starts with a faulty premise is bound to fail. I saw &quot;V&quot; patterns and I foolishly ruled out the nose.</p>
<p><strong>Clifford Renteria</strong>: I told you I had a condition, Hepatitis C. I was diagnosed when I was 18.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: And this relates to your magic nose, how?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hepatitis C destroys the liver and a whole host of clotting functions. Cliff, indeed, has blood to spare.</p>
<p><strong>Clifford Renteria</strong>: Thanks for coming around to my side. Which way is out?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Nobody released you. </p>
<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT -- INTERROGATION ROOM]</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mr. Renteria, I can't sign off on a case until I fully understand it. So, let me get this straight. You had a beef with your landlord and you decided to pay him back by blowing blood out of your nose all over the apartment walls. Is that about right?</p>
<p><strong>Cliff Renteria</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: A day? A week? A couple of months? How long did this take?</p>
<p><strong>Cliff Renteria</strong>: I don't know. About a month.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So, you get up in the morning, make coffee and go &quot;I think I'll blow some blood on the kitchen wall today.&quot; Get out of the shower grab your towel, go &quot;Hey, this looks like a nice spot to expirate a couple of pints.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Cliff Renteria</strong>: It wasn't like that. Something would set me off. The disposal was backed up, no hot water, the toilet was broken ... I knew the landlord wasn't going to fix it.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So, you made your statement through your nose?</p>
<p><strong>Clifford Renteria</strong>: I wasn't getting anywhere with words. Look, if it'll get me out of here any quicker, I'll show you. </p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So you got an ID on the scuba guy?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Jacques Cousteau. Kidding. Coroner's humor. But I'll tell you what I do know. He didn't die in that fire. No carboxyhemoglobin in his blood. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Means he didn't inhale any carbon monoxide. </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Tells us he stopped breathing before the fire started. Guy was probably killed someplace else and dumped.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Oh, he was dumped all right ... out of a chopper. Right, doctor?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Victim's injuries are inconsistent with a fall of that magnitude. No fracture of the pelvis no compression of the lumbar vertebrae no shortening of the body.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: There goes your theory, Nick. Good try, though. So what was the cause of death?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: His heart stopped beating. </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Heart attack ... consistent with being scooped out of Lake Mead.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: The human heart beats in a four-beat rhythm like a fox-trot. The two atria contract, then the two ventricles. Ba-boom, ba-boom.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So, what happened to this guy?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Commotio cordis. Cardiac concussion. The guy short-circuited. It's rare, but I've seen it. Couple of years ago a minor leaguer took a line drive to the chest. </p>
<p>(CGI POV of a baseball hitting the center of a &quot;Blaster's&quot; jersey. Camera moves forward through the jersey and into the heart where it starts to beat irregularly. Flash to white. Resume to present.)</p>

But the point is, that these rubber suits aren't very easy to put on. Neoprene and skin need a little romance to get together. And a capful of liquid soap works like a charm.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Excuse me. You said that Mr. Skeller was an experienced diver. Why would he be borrowing a tank?</p>

<p>(NICK puts the second sample under the microscope for CATHERINE to match. He steps aside while she works. Camera changes to microscope view of the two splinter pieces side by side.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Radial chains align. Pores match. Two pieces of ash wood, one source. So, Walden and Skeller get into an argument probably over their land.</p>
<p>(Quick Flashback to JERRY WALDEN arguing with BRUCE SKELLER.</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Walden</strong>: Buy yourself a hundred acres of rain forest, man! Cash in your end!</p>
<p><strong>Bruce Skeller</strong>: I'm not going to sell!</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Walden pushes Skeller he falls back onto the ash wood table.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: But that's not what killed Skeller. Robbins said he took a line drive to the chest.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Which escalates to a punch.</p>
<p>(Quick Flashback to JERRY WALDEN and BRUCE SKELLER arguing. JERRY WALDEN punches BRUCE SKELLER in the center of his chest. BRUCE SKELLER falls backward onto the coffee table, breaking it. End of flashback.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (smiles) I'll call O'Reilly.</p>

[INT. RESIDENT MANAGER'S APARTMENT #103]</p>
<p>(SARA and GRISSOM are standing in the small apartment's kitchen.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Scented candles, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Stu Evans</strong>: Food went rotten wanted to cover the smell.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You've re-plastered this wall recently?</p>
<p><strong>Stu Evans</strong>: I had rain damage. Funneled down, wrecked a five-foot area.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Huh.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes the picture hanging on the wall down.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You wouldn't mind if I, uh ... examined your vent, would you?</p>
<p>(The door opens and BRASS walks in. He's holding a warrant.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You don't have to ask his permission. I got a new warrant that covers his apartment. (to STU EVANS) Your wife being missing put it over. Funny you didn't mention that before.</p>
<p>(BRASS hands the warrant to STU EVANS who takes it and reads it. GRISSOM and SARA set up a small ladder that GRISSOM climbs to examine the vent.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did you know that your apartment shares heating ducts with the apartment next door?</p>
<p><strong>Stu Evans</strong>: Yeah, me and Cliff were always fighting about the temperature. So what?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns back to look through the vent. The camera moves backward through the vent to reveal among other things, more flies than one can count, dust and a congregation of Silphid beetles.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sara?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah ...</p>
<p>(GRISSOM gets down from the ladder and puts it away while SARA gets the hammer. Both she and GRISSOM start to rip the wall down.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hold up. Hold up. Hold up.</p>
<p>(SARA reaches into the hole in the wall and removes a white blanket.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Alklyd. There's blood on the blanket.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And Dermestidae Masculatus.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: That's Latin for &quot;you're hiding a dead body&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What's the matter? Didn't realize how bad a corpse can smell so you just decided to move it around the place?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You can tell us where the body is or we can, uh ... tear your place apart piece by piece. Whichever. </p>
<p>(Camera holds on STU EVANS.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>

[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERROGATION ROOM]</p>
<p><strong>Lewis (Jerry Walden's lawyer)</strong>: Look, you got squat. Jerry and Bruce signed with different pens. You found a cigarette butt at Lake Mead and wood chips on a tree-hugger. Bottom line, you got a dead guy up a tree and you don't know how he got there.</p>
<p><strong>Det. O'Riley</strong>: Hey, I'm just here to make the arrest.</p>
<p><strong>Lewis</strong>: For what? What have you got?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Plenty. Why don't we just start from the beginning. Bruce Skeller didn't die in any fire. He was killed at your house.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to JERRY WALDEN punching BRUCE SKELLER in the chest. Sound of BRUCE SKELLER taking the punch. End of flashback. Resume on CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: He didn't pick up any ash splinters from that forest. It's all Telarosa and Oak out there.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You had a dead body. So, you decided to get creative. Fire season, wet suit, liquid soap.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to JERRY WALDEN applying dishwashing liquid soap to BRUCE SKELLER'S feet. End of Flashback. Resume on CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You drove out to the lake, dumped the body ...</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to JERRY WALDEN carrying BRUCE SKELLER'S fully geared body and putting it down on the ground by the light of his car. Cut to JERRY WALDEN putting the mouthpiece in BRUCE SKELLER'S mouth. End of flashback. Resume on CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: ... and lit up. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to match flare and cigarette in mouth being lit. Flash to white. End of flashback. Resume on CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Not 'cause you wanted a cigarette. You lit up with a purpose.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to lit cigarette being placed inside a matchbook. JERRY WALDEN looking up. Flash to white. End of flashback. Resume on NICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: This gave you a head start. My guess is around, what, five-minute mark.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV of cigarette and matchbook combo catching on fire. Flash to white. Resume on CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You figured the fire department would label it a hot spot -- relate it to the original fire and the body would just burn up.</p>
<p><strong>Lewis</strong>: Still doesn't explain how Bruce's body wound up in that tree.</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Walden</strong>: I didn't put him there.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Actually ... you did. See, the thing you forgot about a scuba tank is it contains compressed air. Too much heat ... and kaboom.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to the air tank exploding and the body in scuba gear flying through the air in slow motion. As it descends, it gets caught in the tree's branches where it was eventually found. Flash to white. Resume on NICK.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and NICK exit the interrogation room. CATHERINE smiles. NICK sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Rocket Man.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah. Got to love this job.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. RESIDENT MANAGER'S APARTMENT #101]</p>
<p>(WARRICK and the rest of the Forensics team continue to tear down the walls of the Resident Manager's Apartment. WARRICK taps on the next wall he's going to knock through.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I got a hollow section.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Let's open it up.</p>
<p>(Using a hand-held box cutter, WARRICK cuts out a piece of the wall. He peels it open and out drops an ironing board.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Damn. Are we in the wrong apartment again?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I don't know. I don't mind being wrong. I just don't think I am this time. Okay ... start on the floorboards. I'm going outside.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM exits the building and begins checking his pulse while keeping an eye on his wristwatch. He calculates his heart rate. He's breathing loudly and pacing the floor. He leans against the brick wall. Off screen, the glass doors open and SARA walks out.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Ninety-five.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Normally my pulse is seventy. When it gets to 95, I realize how mad I am. I-I have ten people working around the clock on this thing.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You're too hard on yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No, no. I'm not mad at me. There's a body in there and that guy knows where it is!</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What's your pulse at now?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM sighs and pushes his cap up over his forehead.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You want to take a walk around the block? Get some air?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (sighs) No.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Clear your head ...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm fine.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM has his eyes closed. SARA reaches out and wipes his cheek. A lingering move that surprises GRISSOM in it's intimacy. He looks at her. She meets his eyes. She shrugs.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Chalk ... from plaster.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM wipes his cheek and absently glances at the back of his hand. He looks at SARA. She meets his eyes for a moment then looks away.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (gently) Better go wash up.</p>
<p>(SARA smiles and walks back in leaving GRISSOM behind. GRISSOM pulls his cap down and follows.)</p>
<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. APARTMENT #103 -- KITCHEN]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns on the hot water. Nothing comes out but a few drops. He tries the cold water. It works fine. He closes the water and tries the hot water again. Nothing. GRISSOM ponders the possible connection.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hey, Brass. When did The Shnoz say he lost his hot water?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: He wasn't exact.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to STU EVANS) You, uh, have no pressure for your hot water.</p>
<p><strong>Stu Evans</strong>: I got a plumber coming on Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, you know, my Uncle Herb was a plumber. I might be able to help. Where's your installation?</p>
<p><strong>Stu Evans</strong>: In the basement. But, really, I got a plumber coming.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. APARTMENT COMPLEX BASEMENT -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns on the light. The bulb blows.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You got an electrician coming, too? </p>
<p>(He turns on his flashlight and proceeds through the basement followed by BRASS and STU EVANS.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: A filtration system. It softens the water.</p>
<p><strong>Stu Evans</strong>: Yeah. Listen, you know, I got a guy on retainer. You don't have to do this.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, well, I'm non-union.</p>
<p>(He looks up at the pipes.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: There's no disruption to the cold water line. Hot water line ... water runs through the filtration tanks first and the water heater second, right?</p>
<p><strong>Stu Evans</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Why is it bypassed? You've cut off the water to the filtration tanks. </p>
<p><strong>Stu Evans</strong>: Something's wrong with that. I had no choice.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM knocks on the tank. It sounds full.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Brine tanks are usually hollow. Only got about eight inches of water at the bottom for the salt mixture.</p>
<p>(He knocks on tank again. It definitely sounds full.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Does that sound hollow to you?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM lifts up the cover to the tank. BRASS reacts to the smell. Camera cuts to inside the tank where we find STU EVANS' wife, dead and covered with Silphid Beetles. Flash to white. Resume outside of tank.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Not enough candles in the world ... </p>
<p><strong>Stu Evans</strong>: She nagged me.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns around to look at STU EVANS.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (incredulous) She nagged you?</p>
<p>(Camera holds on GRISSOM.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />

[INT. CSI - GRISSOM'S OFFICE]</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey, you want to grab some breakfast?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No, thanks.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM opens the container with the Silphid Beetle in it.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Come on ... we always get better service when you're there.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm having breakfast with a friend of mine.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM puts a piece of meat off of his plate into the container.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You're keeping him alive? Sara said you guys already solved the case.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He did.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (nods) All right.</p>
<p>(NICK and SARA leave. Camera holds on GRISSOM eating breakfast with his beetle.)</p>
<p>(Camera pans back down the hall.)</p>

<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(It's raining. Thunder rumbles; lightning flashes.) </p>
<p><strong>Cue Sound</strong>: (PRE-LAP) RING TONE</p>
<p>[PHONE BOOTH] </p>
<p>(Through the smoky glass, we see the figure of someone inside the phone booth making a call.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer Mularz</strong>: (over phone) LVPD. Officer Mularz. Can I help you?</p>
<p>(There's no response.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer Mularz</strong>: (over phone) Is anybody there?</p>
<p>(Inside the phone booth, someone wearing a hooded jacket is on the phone. There's a prolonged pause before the person speaks.) </p>
<p><strong>Whisperer</strong>: (to phone) I'd like to report a murder.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Mularz</strong>: (over phone) Your name?</p>
<p>(There's another pause.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer Mularz</strong>: (over phone) Hello? Is there somebody there?</p>
<p>(The person in the phone booth puts their gloved hand on the glass.) </p>
<p><strong>Whisperer</strong>: (to phone) The body can be found at 1812 White Oak Road.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Mularz</strong>: (over phone) I'd like to help you. Please identify yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Whisperer</strong>: (to phone) Send someone to pick up the body.</p>
<p>(The camera blurs on the figure inside the phone booth.) </p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO: </p>
<p>[EXT. BRADFORD RESIDENCE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(There's a full moon shining down on the scene. Officer cars are parked outside the residence.) </p>
<p>(Warrick, Grissom and Sara walk down the front drive toward the house. Brass exits the house to meet up with them.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So an anonymous call came into metro about an hour ago. (He checks his watch.) Investigating officer found the dead body. The coroner's inside.</p>
<p>(They turn and head toward the house.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The, uh ... the door was open. Unlocked.</p>
<p>[INT. BRADFORD RESIDENCE - HALLWAY - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Brass leads them through the hallway. They note the multiple tufts of hair on the floor.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So the house is owned by the decedent, Hayden Bradford. Neighbor says he lives alone.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The floor is covered in hair. Has he got a cat or a dog?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Nope. But as you can see our dead guy is ... I guess you could say he's hirsute.</p>
<p>(They reach the body and it's apparent that Hayden Bradford is very, very hairy.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: &quot;Hirsute&quot; is an understatement. It's like he's wearing a pelt.</p>
<p>(Grissom notes the hairy legs and arms. There's blood on his left shoulder where he was shot. Hayden's eyes are open.) </p>
<p>(We hear buzzing. Everyone checks their pager. Warrick motions to the pager next to the dead body.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey, David, would you grab that?</p>
<p>(David picks up the cell phone out of the victim's pocket and hands it to Warrick. </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>(Warrick checks it. The information shows:<br />
MISSED<br />
MICHELLE 702-555-0194</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: A missed call from a Michelle.</p>
<p>(Additional information of the calls missed shows:<br />
Michelle 702-555-0194 12:08 a.m.<br />
Michelle 702-555-0194 11:44 p.m.<br />
Michelle 702-555-0194 10:15 p.m.<br />
Michelle 702-555-0194 8:32 p.m.<br />
Michelle 702-555-0194 6:02 p.m.<br />
Michelle 702-555-0194 3:53 p.m. )</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: She called six times since 3:53 p.m.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Liver temp's 80 degrees. Been dead around twelve hours.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Which makes TOD around 3:00 p.m.</p>
<p>(Grissom examines a tuft of fallen hair.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Explains why he didn't take her calls. COD -- bullet to the chest.</p>
<p>(David pulls the shirt aside to show the wound.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: These strands are smooth, not coarse. They're human. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Are the roots intact?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah. (shrugs) Evidently, this guy was shedding.</p>
<p>SMASH CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. BRADFORD RESIDENCE - FRONT STREET -- DAY] </p>
<p>(David and James push the gurney out the front walk and across the road.) </p>
<p>(Catherine and Nick head toward them on the way into the house.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, Dave, James.</p>
<p>(Just then, the gurney's back wheel gets stuck in a rut in the dirt road. David struggles with it for a moment.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Aw, c'mon.</p>
<p>(David lifts up the gurney to get it out of the rut. Nick and Catherine walk past David.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, Dave, you've got to pick it up.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Lift with the knees, Super Dave, lift with the knees.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: (irritated) Thanks, I ... have done this before.</p>
<p>(David lifts up the gurney and the victim's right arm falls out from under the sheet and hangs off the side of the gurney exposing his very, very hairy arm.) </p>
<p>(Sara exits the house.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, Brass gave us a quick briefing. How can we help?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Warrick and I are processing the interior, room to room.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So that leaves the perimeter.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>(Sara leaves.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. BRADFORD RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(Warrick looks at the framed photos on the table. They are photos of Hayden with a pretty, blonde-haired woman. He picks up a photo as Sara re-enters the living room and heads for her kit.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, this victim definitely had a lady in his life.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: That's odd. There is not a single feminine touch in this house.</p>
<p>(Sara turns her flashlight on and looks around the room as she heads over toward Warrick. Warrick flips the framed photo over and removes it from the frame. On the back is some writing:<br />
MICHELLE<br />
CHRISTMAS 2004 )</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Michelle. Christmas, 2004.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Probably the same Michelle that tried to reach him six times on his cell phone.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. BRADFORD RESIDENCE - OUTER PERIMETER - DAY -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(Catherine and Nick walk around the side of the house, paying close attention to the ground and windows.) </p>
<p>(Catherine finds a broken window.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Broken window.</p>
<p>(She takes a photo of it.) </p>
<p>(She sticks her hand inside the broken pane and pushes the window open.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah. It slides. The front door was locked. The killer probably broke the window and exited out the front.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: The killer smashes the glass window. End of flash.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I'll need to print the window, but, uh ... why don't we get to this first.</p>
<p>(He points to the ground. They both kneel down in front of a large rock.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Doesn't look big enough to have done the job.</p>
<p>(Catherine sees the broken shards of glass on the ground and reaches out to pick one up. Nick dusts the rock for prints.) </p>
<p>(He finds a print and smiles.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: We have a print.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. BRADFORD RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - DAY -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(Sara and Warrick enter the bedroom. They note the various pictures and color schemes on the desk. Warrick takes the printed e-mail from the printer and reads:<br />
1/02/06<br />
From: casinodan(a)gmail.com<br />
To: misterbradford(a)gmail.com<br />
Date: January 2, 2006 12:08 pm pst</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: &quot;Hey, jackass-- this is your last chance. Pay your debt or I'll hunt you down.&quot; </p>
<p>(Sara stands up from what she's looking at to read the e-mail.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Makes our job easier when the suspect prints out his motive. He has an e-mail printout from casinodan(a)gmail.com to (a)misterbradford(a)gmail.com.</p>
<p>(Outside, Catherine and Nick continue surveying the perimeter of the house. Near the back of the house, they find a patch of disturbed dirt.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, that ain't no anthill. That dirt's fresh. Looks like something's buried there. </p>
<p>(Nick kneels down next to Catherine.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hang on.</p>
<p>(She snaps a photo of the dirt.)</p>
<p>(Nick brushes the dirt away and they find a gun.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No way.</p>
<p>(Catherine snaps more photos. Nick picks up the gun.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: .32 Beretta. Victim was shot, right? It's going to be hard to get a print, but I'll get it to Ballistics.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Robbins shaves the area around the bullet hole on Hayden Bradford's chest. Grissom watches.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, we knew he was hairy. I didn't realize the full extent.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Hypertrichosis. I've only read about it. Excessive hair growth. Genetic. Extremely rare. His case was relatively mild. In some individuals, hair grows everywhere except the eyes and the mouth.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The human werewolf syndrome.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: In Mexico, there's a family thirty members are afflicted. Two of the teen boys were recently adopted by the National Circus.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Great. The bearded lady, the dog-faced boy -- physical deformities as family entertainment.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: I cleared a path for the bullet. </p>
<p>(Robbins extracts the bullet and looks at it. He puts it in a bindle.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: I figured you'd want to get this to ballistics ASAP.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Thank you, Al.</p>
<p>(Robbins gives the bindle to Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: You know, Gil, we're all intrigued by our nightmares, and when we watch freak shows, basically we're all thinking the same thing.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, I'm glad they're not looking at me.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - A/V LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Greg walks into the lab. Archie is working at the computers.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Hey, Archie.</p>
<p><strong>Archie</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Please tell me you've ID.'d Casino Dan.</p>
<p><strong>Archie</strong>: Yep. The ISP provider sent over the subscriber information for a casinodan(a)gmail.com. It's registered to a Dan Nobler, who runs a gambling website.</p>
<p>(The information pops up on screen:<br />
Domain Name: CasinoDan.com<br />
IP Address: 121.198.253.172 )</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: If I wanted to visit Dan in person, where would I go?</p>
<p><strong>Archie</strong>: Well, the server for casinodan.com is in Argentina, which allows him to skirt U.S. gaming laws. However, he's got a Nevada business license. And I have the address.</p>
<p>(Archie holds out a slip of paper. Greg takes it and looks at it.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Anything else I should know?</p>
<p><strong>Archie</strong>: Uh, well, I don't know if it's relevant, but he recently opened an account with peopledetectors.com. </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Who was he looking for?</p>
<p><strong>Archie</strong>: I don't know. I'll triage the computer's hard drive.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. NOBLER RESIDENCE - FRONT WALK -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Warrick and Greg head for the Nobler residence. A car pulls up. Dan Nobler gets out.) </p>
<p><strong>Archie</strong>: (V.O.) Reconstruct the deleted e-mails. I'll get back to you on that.</p>
<p><strong>Dan Nobler</strong>: Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: You Dan Nobler?</p>
<p><strong>Dan Nobler</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We're from the Crime Lab. We need to ask you a few questions.</p>
<p>(Dan quickly walks past them and heads for the house. Warrick and Greg follow him.) </p>
<p><strong>Dan Nobler</strong>: Look, if you're here about my business, you can save it for my attorney.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No, actually we're inquiring about a Mr. Hayden Bradford. You sent him some threatening e-mails.</p>
<p>(Dan stops and turns around to look at them.) </p>
<p><strong>Dan Nobler</strong>: Bradford is a lying son of a bitch.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Care to elaborate on that?</p>
<p><strong>Dan Nobler</strong>: I run an online gambling business. Bradford had an account, ran up<br />
$10,000 in debt and refused to pay it.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Isn't it true in online gambling you have to submit your credit card, prior to gambling, to insure your losses?</p>
<p><strong>Dan Nobler</strong>: That's true. And when Brad was winning, it wasn't a problem. But when his luck changed, he called his credit card holder and said the charges were fraudulent. The credit card company issued a charge back and I got screwed.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Is that when you decided to hunt him down?</p>
<p><strong>Dan Nobler</strong>: Look, I wrote him an e-mail, hoping to scare him. Sorry. I was angry. If I write an apology, can we drop this? </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No, Mr. Nobler, I'm sorry, we can't do that. Mr. Bradford's dead.</p>
<p>(He looks at them both.) </p>
<p><strong>Dan Nobler</strong>: Any other questions, contact my lawyer. We're done here.</p>
<p>(He turns and heads into the house. Before he enters the house, he wipes his feet on the mat. Warrick sees him.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You see that?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yeah, the guy's a jerk.</p>
<p>(Warrick heads for the mat.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No, he wiped his feet on the mat. I'm hoping to get a little trace evidence here. Yeah, you see these pebbles? They look like the same ones that were found at the crime scene.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - BALLISTICS LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Bobby Dawson puts his earphonesand protective eyewear on. He picks up the gun and puts it in the firing container. He cocks the weapon.) </p>
<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: Fire in the hole!</p>
<p>(He fires.)</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV: The bullet travels out of the gun and into the container full of pellets. End of CGI POV.)</p>
<p>(Bobby removes the canister and empties out the contents into a plastic bin. He finds the bullet and puts it under the scope to scan into the computer.)</p>
<p>(Catherine enters the lab.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Bobby.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: Hey. </p>
<p>(He compares the two bullets.) </p>
<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: So, that, uh, buried gun y'all recovered, wasn't used to kill Bradford.</p>
<p>(He turns the monitor to show Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: GRCs aren't even close.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: Most bullets are copper, but take a look at the fatal bullet. It's silver.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: How do you kill a werewolf?</p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>

<p>(The door opens.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: No one's home.</p>
<p>(Hodges, Archie and Henry Adams walk in.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: We want to see the Wolfman.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Yeah, well, he's not available right now. I am trying to prep him for autopsy.</p>
<p>(They all surround the body.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Wow. And I thought Robin Williams had hairy arms.</p>
<p><strong>Henry Adams</strong>: Can I touch him?</p>
<p><strong>Archie</strong>: You mean &quot;pet&quot; him. </p>
<p>(Henry reaches out to touch him; David Phillips smacks his hand away. Archie raises a camera to snap a photo of the body.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: No! You may not touch or pet the decedent.</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Is it soft like fur or ... ?</p>
<p>(Henry Adams leans forward, turns and smiles for the camera. Archie snaps the photo.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: I was supposed to have him prepped hours ago. Please. Okay, you guys gotta go.</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Relax, Dave. It's not every day that Chaka ends up on a slab.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Yeah, I need you to leave.</p>
<p><strong>Archie</strong>: Whoa.</p>

[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Nick interviews Brent Moyer.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mr. Moyer, you're here about Hayden Bradford. Do you know him?</p>
<p><strong>Brent Moyer</strong>: Of course. He's one of my closest friends.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah ... yeah, I'm sorry. We found his body this morning. You didn't recently try to break in his home ... did you?</p>
<p><strong>Brent Moyer</strong>: Excuse me. What?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: We found a rock by a broken window, with your fingerprint on it.</p>
<p>(He chuckles.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Is that funny?</p>
<p><strong>Brent Moyer</strong>: No. It's just. Uh ... last week we were playing toss with a ball.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [EXT. BRADFORD RESIDENCE - FRONT - DAY] Brent and another guy are playing toss. The ball overshoots the catcher and smashes into the window. End of flash.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: That still doesn't explain to me how your fingerprint got there.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Brent walks up to the broken window.) </p>

<p><strong>Brent Moyer</strong>: He's a friendly, quiet guy. I've known him since high school. He's been dating my sister. Oh, God. She doesn't know yet, does she?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Who, Michelle?</p>
<p><strong>Brent Moyer</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I tried to call her cell phone and ...</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What's up?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: The anonymous call was traced to this phone booth, so I figured you'd want to process.</p>
<p>(Sara looks at the phone and sees the print powder on it.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: There is fingerprint powder on the phone.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Yeah, I got bored waiting. I thought you might need some help. No usable prints, but check out the floor.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: There's a lot of hair. Similar to the crime scene.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Brother and sister.</p>
<p><strong>Wendy Simms</strong>: (nods) Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: She's likely our anonymous caller. </p>
<p><strong>Wendy Simms</strong>: Yeah, well, given the amount of hair that you collected, she's also probably a very hairy woman.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Wendy, can you do me a favor?</p>
<p><strong>Wendy Simms</strong>: Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Can you see if any of the follicles from the crime scene are a match to the hairs from the phone booth?</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm assuming you contacted Allison.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, that's where it gets odd. Allison Bradford has never filed with the IRS, has never had a driver's license, has never filled out a W-2. How do you go through life without a paper trail?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: She's dead.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: There's no record of a death certificate. We found her hair in the phone booth. And DNA just confirmed that some of the hair follicles that we collected at the crime scene are hers.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, other than hair, when you and Warrick processed the house, did you find any evidence of a sister?</p>

<p>(The paneling opens to reveal a hidden bedroom. Catherine takes a step forward. Allison is hidden by the shadows coming from the light behind her.) </p>

<p><strong>Allison Bradford</strong>: You want to see what I look like?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No, I ... no. I don't want you to have to hide from me. Allison ... I'm a scientist. Excess body hair does not evoke fear ... or morbid fascination. It's simply a genetic quirk, like ... blue eyes or flat feet. </p>
<p>(Allison steps forward. Catherine's eyes widen imperceptibly. Catherine holds her hand out.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It's nice to meet you, Allison.</p>

<p><strong>Allison Bradford</strong>: And when I came out of my room, Hayden was dead.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Why did you wait twelve hours to call the police?</p>
<p><strong>Allison Bradford</strong>: Because I didn't want the call traced to the house, back to me, so ... I waited till midnight, and then I walked to a pay phone. You weren't supposed to find me.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Do you have any idea why someone would want to hurt your brother?</p>
<p>(She shakes her head.) </p>
<p><strong>Allison Bradford</strong>: He was my only friend. (cries) He was my connection to the outside world.</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No, I didn't.</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You talking about Allison?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah. Catherine said she's scared to death of people and what they'll think of her.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, if that's the case, why not try electrolysis or depilatory lasers?</p>

<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: I compared pebbles from the crime scene to the pebbles from Dan Nobler's doormat. They're consistent with each other -- a composite commonly known as pea gravel.

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: This is true; he did. But we believe that Mr. Nobler here stepped in the shards of glass. Listen, neither the glass nor the pebbles are probative on their own, but together, they put your client at the crime scene. Not to mention, his threatening e-mail gives us motive.</p>

<p><strong>Duane McWane</strong>: Dan ...</p>
<p><strong>Dan Nobler</strong>: No, look, I get ripped off by jerks all over the world. This guy was a local. I knew his address and, yeah, I wanted to shake him down. Let him know that by declaring credit card fraud, he was stealing from me.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm sorry, but I still don't understand why she believes you're dead.</p>
<p><strong>Rita Bradford</strong>: One day, Allison wanted to take a walk ... outside. I didn't want anyone to see her. We had a fight. I locked her in her room -- my own child - because she wanted fresh air. At that moment, I knew I needed to leave. I told Hayden to tell her I was in a car accident.

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, but Allison told you that Brent entered through the front door. The rock is extraneous evidence, isn't it?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, let's just leave Allison's testimony out of it. We simply inform the judge that our suspect's fingerprints were on a rock that may have been used to break a window at the murder scene.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: If you have no qualms about filing the petition, then file it.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, no, I don't have any qualms. It's just that my moral compass doesn't always point in the same direction as yours.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So if I tell you not to file it, you won't?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (carefully) I'd take it under advisement. Why, is that what you're recommending?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How many times have we been prevented from getting a warrant when we knew we had the right guy?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Way too many.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Right. So rock and roll.</p>
<p>(They continue walking out of camera frame.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. MOYER RESIDENCE - FRONT YARD -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Sofia Curtis and several officers walk up to Brent Moyer's front door. She knocks.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Las Vegas PD. We have a search warrant.</p>
<p>(The door opens.) </p>
<p><strong>Brent Moyer</strong>: What's going on?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Please step outside.</p>
<p>(Brent steps outside.)</p>
<p>[INT. MOYER RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Sofia and the officers look around the living room. She sees the rifle rack and four rifles on the wall. The television set is on.) </p>
<p>(They continue into the kitchen.)</p>
<p>(In the room, Sofia finds the mold and slivers of silver on the worktable.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(Catherine and Sofia Curtis question Brent Moyer with his lawyer, Margaret Finn.) </p>
<p><strong>Brent Moyer</strong>: Why would I kill my best friend?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: That's a very good question.</p>
<p><strong>Margaret Finn</strong>: A bullet clamshell isn't enough for the DA to file. What am I missing here?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Our Trace Lab analyzed the silver found in the bullet mold. It's identical composition to the bullet in the victim. DA says it's a slam dunk.</p>
<p><strong>Brent Moyer</strong>: Hayden was going to marry my sister.</p>
<p><strong>Margaret Finn</strong>: (interrupts) Brent, I recommend that ...</p>
<p>(He looks at her. She stops. He continues.) </p>
<p><strong>Brent Moyer</strong>: I couldn't let that happen. He was diseased. Wasn't a problem for me. But my sister deserved better.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: So you killed him?</p>
<p><strong>Brent Moyer</strong>: Did you see his body? Hayden was a monster passing for a regular Joe. My parents blamed me for introducing them. You know, the werewolf disease, it's hereditary. It means my sister could've given birth to freaks.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And the silver bullet?</p>
<p><strong>Brent Moyer</strong>: Figured it was appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So you left your parents', you went back to your place to make the bullet and then you went over to Hayden's.</p>
<p><strong>Brent Moyer</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So it was premeditated. I guess you can forget heat of the moment as a mitigating factor here.</p>
<p><strong>Brent Moyer</strong>: I did the right thing. My sister's out there waiting. Since I confessed, can I at least go out and talk to her? Explain why I did it.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Why don't I do that for you.</p>
<p>(Sofia stands up and leaves.) </p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Sofia exits the interview room and walks over to Michelle, sitting in the hallway.)<br />
<strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Ms. Moyer ... your brother confessed to killing Hayden. </p>
<p>(Sofia sits down next to Michelle.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: After our last conversation, I checked the TV listings. There was no golf tournament that night. I think you were calling Hayden to warn him about Brent.</p>
<p>(She nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Michelle Moyer</strong>: I had just announced our engagement to my family. Brent flipped out. I was upset. Everyone was yelling at me. I went for a long walk to clear my head. And when I got back, Brent was gone. He told my parents that he was going to &quot;speak&quot; with Hayden.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: But you had your doubts.</p>
<p><strong>Michelle Moyer</strong>: My brother has a temper.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Why didn't you tell us this before?</p>
<p><strong>Michelle Moyer</strong>: When Brent called and told me that Hayden was dead, he said that if I told you guys ... if I implicated him ... </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: He threatened you. (She nods and cries.) It's okay. (She puts a comforting hand on Michelle's leg.) You're safe now.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. BRADFORD RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Allison holds a cup in her hand.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Allison ... what are you going to do now?</p>
<p><strong>Allison Bradford</strong>: I'll be okay. It's not like when I was a kid. I can pretty much get anything I need off the Internet.</p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[EXT. BRADFORD RESIDENCE - FRONT - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(A car pulls up.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) And you're set with money?</p>
<p><strong>Allison Bradford</strong>: (V.O.) I'll manage.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) Allison, I have every confidence that you're going to be just fine here, but ... </p>
<p>(The car parks and the door opens. Rita Bradford steps out of the car.) </p>
<p>[INT. BRADFORD RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: If you ever need anything, would you please give me a call?</p>
<p><strong>Allison Bradford</strong>: I-I will, Ms. Willows.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Catherine.</p>
<p><strong>Allison Bradford</strong>: Catherine. I haven't been completely honest with you. I told you my mother was dead, but that's not true. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm not sure I follow.</p>
<p><strong>Allison Bradford</strong>: Hayden told me she was in a car wreck ... </p>
<p>[EXT. BRADFORD RESIDENCE - FRONT - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Rita Bradford walks toward the front door.) </p>
<p><strong>Allison Bradford</strong>: (V.O.) ... and I called the funeral home to send flowers and they had never heard of her, so I called the local hospitals. Same thing. </p>
<p>(Rita stops before she reaches the front porch. She stares at the door.) </p>
<p>[INT. BRADFORD RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(Allison plays with the rim of her cup.) </p>
<p><strong>Allison Bradford</strong>: Recently, I contacted peopledetectors.com and, apparently, she lives in Las Vegas. She just couldn't live with me.</p>
<p>[EXT. BRADFORD RESIDENCE - FRONT - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Outside, Rita turns and heads back to her car.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) So you were the one that contacted peopledetectors.</p>
<p>(Rita walks back to the car and reaches for the door handle. She stops and suddenly turns around.) </p>
<p><strong>Allison Bradford</strong>: (V.O.) Yeah. When my brother was out, I used his computer.</p>
<p>(She heads back to the front door. She walks up the front steps and stops in front of the door.) </p>
<p>(She takes a deep breath.) </p>
<p>(She raises her hand and knocks.) </p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>
<p><strong>End</strong></p>

							<p>COLD OPEN:</p>
<p>[EXT. SKY AT HIGH ALTITUDE (STOCK)]</p>
<p>(Camera opens on the sea of clouds at the bottom of the screen with the sun barely over the horizon. The wing tip of an airplane appears on the left of the screen. The camera moves over and the plane turns as it flies toward the camera.)</p>
<p>(In the background, fast-tempo techno pop music plays.)</p>
<p>(The camera zooms into the left engine.)</p>
<p>(Quick CGI through the engine, into the plane, through the electrical system, up toward the main cabin, through the gas pipe and out into the main cabin. End of Quick CGI. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. PLANE - MAIN CABIN - DAY -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(The gas flame flares in the pot over it. They guests don't pay any heed to it. They continue to mingle, laugh, and drink.)</p>
<p>(The party hostess, HARPER FITZGERALD, holds a martini glass in her hand and mingles with her guests. A man kisses her on her cheek.)</p>
<p>(A woman is getting a massage in the middle of the room.)</p>
<p>(HARPER FITZGERALD talks a bit with the woman getting the massage. The Steward, JASON BANKS, replenishes the food on the table.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: Ext. The plane hits some turbulence.)</p>
<p>(Cut back to: Int. Main Cabin. HARPER FITZGERALD and guests rock unsteadily on their feet as they feel the turbulence.)</p>
<p>(The blue FASTEN SEAT BELT sign turns on. The CAPTAIN'S voice filters through the P.A.)</p>
<p><strong>Captain</strong>: (on P.A.) Hey, folks, we've hit a little more of that pesky turbulence. If you'd kindly take your seats we should be arriving on the hour.</p>
<p>(Guests start to plop down onto the nearest seat. JASON BANKS approaches HARPER FITZGERALD who is still standing.)</p>
<p><strong>Jason Banks</strong>: (to HARPER) Fasten your seatbelts please.</p>
<p>(HARPER FITZGERALD takes her seat. She turns to the woman next to her and raises her martini glass.</p>
<p><strong>Harper Fitzgerald</strong>: Cheers.</p>
<p>(The camera moves past the other party guests and focuses on the closed back door at the back of the room. A horse whinnying can be heard faintly through the party noise.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. PLANE - CARGO HOLD - DAY -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(The camera pans backward and down slowly. The horse continues whinnying. The cargo hold is padded with silver insulation and is filled with the passenger's things - a couple of motorbikes, a tray of food and, in the center of the cargo hold, a stall with a horse tied inside.)</p>
<p>(The camera moves past the tray of food, past the second motorbike, and focuses on the horse. Next to the horse on the ground in the stall on the straw is a dead woman.)</p>
<p>FLASH TO WHITE:</p>
<hr />
[INT. AIRPLANE HANGAR -- DAY]</p>
<p>(BRASS stands in the middle of the hangar waiting as GRISSOM and CATHERINE walk inside. They glance at the horse in a different hold to the right of the door. They walk up to BRASS.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The victim's name is Lori Hutchins. </p>
<p>(The woman's body is still on the bottom of the horse's stall.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Apparently, she chaperoned the horse on trips all the time. Baggage handler found the body in the cargo hold after the passengers had disembarked.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We're going to need to process everyone on that plane.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, they're being corralled as we speak, partner.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Where to start?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: First witness, first suspect.</p>
<p>(Everyone turns to look at the horse.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The horse?</p>
<p>(beat)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<hr />
[INT. AIRPLANE HANGAR -- DAY]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE interviews the STEWARD (JASON BANKS), the CO-PILOT and the CAPTAIN. They all stare at each other for a long moment. Finally, CATHERINE starts.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: All right, let's talk about Lori Hutchins. What can you tell me about her?</p>
<p><strong>Jason Banks</strong>: She was sweet, polite, quiet.</p>
<p><strong>Co-pilot</strong>: (GLASSES) Horses were her life. She was great with them.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And she always traveled down below with the horse?</p>
<p><strong>Jason Banks</strong>: Checked on her twice during the flight. Brought her dinner about three hours in. She was worried about the horse, but that was nothing new.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So nothing unusual.</p>
<p><strong>Co-pilot</strong>: There was some turbulence, but nothing outrageous.</p>
<p><strong>Captain</strong>: We had an emergency call button down there, if something went wrong. Lori never used it.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. AIRPLANE HANGAR]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM examines the horse's travel stall for evidence. He snaps some pictures of blood spots and finds a small pair of scissors with a piece of hair stuck to it.)</p>
<p>(NICK walks up to the stall and lingers near the doorway.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Where's the horse?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: USDA facility. Mandatory 48-hour quarantine.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: A hundred-pound woman trampled by a 1,400-pound horse? Doesn't seem very fair.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM finds something.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Tranquilizer dart.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Changes the odds a little.</p>
<p>(Under the straw, GRISSOM finds the rifle.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mmm.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah ... heavy artillery.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: More than one way to handicap a horse.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. AIRPLANE - CARGO HOLD - DAY]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks into the cargo hold with her kit. She looks around at the two motorbikes and other stuff.)</p>
<p>(She lingers at the brown pieces of something on the ground. She puts a sample in a bindle and packs it away. She continues her examination. She sees something pink in the ceiling lining. She takes out a small stool and extracts the tranquilizer dart.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: In the cargo hold, the horse rears. LORI HUTCHINS tries to calm the horse down, but doesn't succeed. She turns around and picks up the tranquilizer gun and cocks it. She fires.)</p>
<p>(The plane hits some turbulence and rocks LORI HUTCHINS on her feet. The dart hits the ceiling instead as she falls backward on the ground. The horse rears up. LORI HUTCHINS is thrown forward into the stall. The horse comes down on her.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(NICK walks into the cargo hold.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What have you got?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Trainer had all these small syringes. Why go for the big guns instead?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mmm ... I don't know. Maybe she didn't want to get too close to a spooked horse. What about this food?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Steward said he brought her some dinner.</p>
<p>(She lifts the cover off of the plate and looks at it. She puts the cover back on.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Guess she wasn't very hungry.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Looks like someone stepped in horse crap. (NICK kneels down.) And what was the vic wearing?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Work boots, I think.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: That's a funky print.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks at the print.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh ... a J.P. Tod's driving loafer.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hmm?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I may shop the outlets ... but I read vogue.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. DEATH VALLEY -- DAY]</p>
<p>(LOCKWOOD escorts SARA and WARRICK to the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Lockwood</strong>: This is Death Valley, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You get lost out here, you're toast.</p>
<p><strong>Lockwood</strong>: That may have been the idea.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(They reach the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Lockwood</strong>: Helicopter tour pilot noted it and called it in.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Deathbed ... casket-ready. Laying in the hell's gate section of death valley.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Poetic.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: More like suicidal.</p>
<p>(She snaps some pictures.)</p>
<p><strong>Lockwood</strong>: Is that bird crap?</p>
<p>(SARA takes a sample of it.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Could be.</p>
<p>(WARRICK checks the boy's pockets for ID. He takes out a wallet and reads the information on it.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Toby Wellstone. Mckinley High School. 12/12/87.</p>
<p>[ID # 8438291]</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What's that on his hand?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Looks like a transdermal patch. Fetanyl. Pores in the hand make for faster absorption. Intentional overdose.</p>
<p><strong>Lockwood</strong>: I'll notify the parents.</p>
<p>(LOCKWOOD leaves.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We're 85 miles from Las Vegas, one mile from the closest road. If this was a solo job, how did he get here?</p>
<p>(WARRICK points to some tracks on the ground nearby.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I see some tracks over there, but ... they could be from anything: A surveyor's tool ... a remote-controlled car ... </p>
<p>(SARA raises the camera to take a picture of the marks.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Anything with wheels.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. AIRPLANE - MAIN CABIN -- DAY]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE checks out the main cabin. BRASS walks in.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, I'll tell you. Some days, it's tough to be me. You know, I wish that the seats were as organized as that bar. We have the passenger manifest. No assigned seating, 12 passengers 24 shoes, 36 lawyers.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What was this, a smoking flight?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, I think we've established the fact that these people do whatever it is they want.</p>
<p>(NICK grimaces and stares at the rumpled sheets on the bed.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Now, please, don't make me ALS.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, man, I don't want to go blind any more than you do.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks down and finds a used condom on the bed. She opens a bindle and reaches down to pick it up.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh ... looky here. (She holds it out for NICK.) Little DNA party.</p>
<p>(NICK shudders. CATHERINE puts it in the bindle. She looks into the trashcan and sees something else.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Ooh. Bloody towels. (She holds the trashcan for NICK to look inside.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, at least something made it into the trash can.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT (STOCK) - EARLY EVENING]</p>
<hr />
[INT. USDA FACILITY -- DAY]</p>
<p>(The USDA GUARD stationed at the doorway stops a woman from walking into the facility. She argues with him as CATHERINE and GRISSOM appear.)</p>
<p><strong>USDA Guard</strong>: I'm sorry, ma'am. You may not enter the quarantine area.</p>
<p><strong>Merrit</strong>: I know it's 48 hours, I know the rules, but I need to see my horse. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE and GRISSOM walk up to the guard and show him their IDs. He waves them in and turns back to the irate woman.)</p>
<p><strong>USDA Guard</strong>: You can go in.</p>
<p><strong>Merrit</strong>: I want to talk to Dr. Stevens.</p>
<p><strong>USDA Guard</strong>: I'm sorry, ma'am.</p>
<p><strong>Merrit</strong>: He's my vet.</p>
<p><strong>USDA Guard</strong>: Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hi, Dr. Stevens.</p>
<p>(DR. STEVENS attends to the horse. He turns around when CATHERINE calls out to him. She shows him her ID.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: How's she doing?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stevens</strong>: Shaken up. Horses are incredibly sensitive to change. Travel's hard on them.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: How about losing a trainer?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stevens</strong>: Like losing a best friend. I just don't understand how this could've happened.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We're going to need to pull some samples from that horse.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stevens</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(DR. STEVENS takes some samples from under the horse's hoof. He takes some skin samples and puts it in a bindle. He hands it to CATHERINE. She pulls out a pen to label it.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM checks out the HIGH FOLLY's backend. He notices something. The Camera zooms in to note the stitches.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This looks recent. What happened here?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stevens</strong>: High Folly is what we call a &quot;dirty mare.&quot; Prone to serious uterine infections.</p>
<p>(DR. STEVENS holds HIGH FOLLY'S head as CATHERINE extracts something from between her teeth.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stevens</strong>: Caslick stitching keeps out fluids and bacteria.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So you stitch her up until it's time to breed?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stevens</strong>: I know it sounds bad, but I promise having an acute infection is worse. And there's no greater tragedy than a champion who can't breed.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Is this some kind of food?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE holds out the sample. DR. STEVENS looks at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stevens</strong>: I don't know. It could be.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We'll need a blood sample. We found a tranquilizer gun in the container. We want to double-check it.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Stevens</strong>: You'd never use a tranq gun on a horse. The impact energy would cause an immediate adrenaline response. Make the horse more agitated.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We'll still need that sample.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) -- DAY]</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY TO MORGUE -- DAY]</p>
<p>(SARA meets up with WARRICK as they head to FORENSIC PATHOLOGY. WARRICK carries and looks through a file.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey. Nobody's here to claim the body?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Nope. I don't know what's worse, consoling a grieving parent, or finding a kid with no parents at all.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No parents?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No, this kid has been through seven foster homes in seven years. System lost track of him a year ago.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Mckinley high school said the same thing. He was out more than he was in. Kid was a ghost.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - MORGUE -- DAY]</p>
<p>(ROBBINS pulls out the table with TOBY WELLSTONE'S body on it.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Treated himself to a hamburger with pickles and ketchup, chocolate shake, and what I can only assume was super-size fries.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So that's what killed him.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: That's a five-course meal to a teenager.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: More like a last supper, I'm afraid. He took a synthetic narcotic, fentanyl. By patch and by pill.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, that's a painkiller.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Used in hospitals, post-surgery.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What is ... cisapride?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: That what separates the attempts from the corpses. It's a prokenetic agent that speeds up the body's absorption of fentanyl and it keeps the stomach acids from going into reflux.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI to: Stomach sounds. Stomach acids. A pill falls into the stomach and starts fizzing. End of CGI. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No nausea, no vomit.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No vomit, no chance of survival. Kid did his homework.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Permanent solution to a temporary problem.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Maybe not so temporary. 80% of all completed suicides have tried previously.</p>
<p>(ROBBINS holds out TOBY WELLSTONE'S wrist to show the scars.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: From the scarring, I'd say twice before.</p>
<p>(He pauses and looks down at the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Third time's the charm.</p>
<p>(He pulls the sheet over the body.)</p>

<p>(She takes a piece of brown shavings from that sample and drops it into a second filter set up on top of a second glass tube.)</p>
<p>(She takes some CHLOROFORM and puts some of it in each sample.)</p>
<p>(NICK walks in. CATHERINE looks up.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, fashionista.</p>
<p>(He holds up the bag with a shoe in it.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Brass collected all the shoes. You were right. Not only did we find a match, but I also found trace elements.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Equus caballus?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Horse dung all the way. Brass is bringing her in now.</p>

<p>(ROBBINS goes over the findings with GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Our horse trainer has paramortem bruising and scraping, ranging from minor to major, all consistent with being trampled. What's not consistent is this: Pinpoints.</p>
<p>(ROBBINS shows GRISSOM the body's right pupil. GRISSOM looks at ROBBINS, surprised.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: An opiate overdose?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Torphine. A thousand times as potent as morphine.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Tranquilizer.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Mm-hmm. One of the bruises contains a puncture wound about the same size as that dart you found.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes off his glasses and looks at ROBBINS.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How do you shoot yourself in the shoulder with a tranquilizer rifle?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Someone else shot her.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And framed the horse.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You have any idea what caused the infection?</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Why didn't you tell us that Jill and Toby had access to these?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: MRS. FROMMER asks JILL to get her pills.)</p>

<p><strong>Mrs. Frommer</strong>: Not helping a child in danger is a misdemeanor. You might as well write me a parking ticket.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We're going to write you up on murder, and then I'm going to call Child Services.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Frommer</strong>: Go ahead. I am next of kin, and without a record, I'm going to get her back in a second.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What have you got?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We got animal, mineral, and now vegetable.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I ran the trace on the remainder of the diamonds. Lentils and carrots.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Carrots on the karats.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm thinking Lori packed the diamonds.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: After she fed the horse, evidently.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: LORI HUTCHINS feeds HIGH FOLLY some carrots.)</p>
<p><strong>Lori</strong>: There you go. That a girl.</p>

<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: She was the only one who got close to that horse.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So Dr. Stevens didn't have one partner, he had two.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And Lori was the only one who knew there was five packages, which would explain why Stevens left one behind.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay, so, we've got a dead woman, a dead horse, a runaway vet, and ... a couple million dollars worth of uncut diamonds that are unaccounted for.</p>
<p>(NICK opens the second Info box and picture of ERICA DOLINKY, Ski Instructor. Additional Info reads: Birthplace, Las Vegas / s*x: Female / Age: 31 / Eyes: Brown / Hair: Brown / Height: 5'10&quot;.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, diamonds are worthless unless you have a buyer.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What if the vet repackaged the diamonds, took them with him. PD traced him to the Caymans.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: But why would he smuggle them into the country only to smuggle them out again?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Flight Steward's story checks out. Lori Hutchins had an ante-mortem gash on her right forearm.</p>
<p>(NICK opens the third Info box and picture of TREVOR NELSON, Masseuse.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Ski instructor ... massuese ... geez. Is there anyone not on Harper's payroll?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, you met her. Would you be her friend for free?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What about Harper? It was her plane, Meredith's horse. She didn't care what happened to the horse.</p>
<p>(NICK opens the Info box and picture for HARPER FITZGERALD. He then opens the next Info box and picture for RHONE K.-CONFER.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, but she's got no reason to smuggle diamonds. Reward's not worth the risk.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (under her breath) Rhone Kinsey-Confer. Hey, what if we were thinking about this whole thing a little too globally? I'm going to find out what Rhone's mother's maiden name is. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE picks up the phone and dials.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What's his mother got to do with it?</p>

<p>(The officers confiscates the diamonds.)</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Kinsey</strong>: I bought those diamonds. They're mine. What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hey, Mrs. Kinsey, did you ever stop and think that maybe your family discount was a little too good to be true? Did you really think your son mined those rocks himself? Come on. Think about it.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Tantalus. Stuck in hell, forever staring at the fruit just out of reach.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Except you couldn't do it without Lori. My guess is her death was an accident.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did she care more about the horse than she did the diamonds?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: RHONE and LORI argue in the cargo bay of the plane.)</p>
<p><strong>Rhone Confer</strong>: Can't you give her a pill or something?</p>
<p><strong>Lori Hutchins</strong>: I'm taking the diamonds out.</p>
<p><strong>Rhone Confer</strong>: No, you're not. We've come too far to have this fall apart now. It's not worth the horse's life.</p>
<p><strong>Lori Hutchins</strong>: Yeah, well, it is to me.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Rhone Confer</strong>: Prove it.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Would you mind taking off your shirt?</p>
<p><strong>Rhone Confer</strong>: I don't want to.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, that's unfortunate, because ... your tax evasion allows us to expand your warrant. And your shirt -- that's just the beginning.</p>
<p>(BRASS opens the warrant and puts it on the table.)</p>
<p>(RHONE CONFER sighs and unbuttons his shirt.)</p>
<p><strong>Rhone Confer</strong>: What are you looking for?</p>
<p>(RHONE'S shirt falls open. In the middle of his chest is a large red, black and blue bruise.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Evidence of a struggle. Oh, and there it is.</p>
<p>(RHONE looks down at his chest.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: High-powered pneumatic guns don't need to be loaded to leave a mark.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: RHONE CONFER picks up the rifle and shoots; the backfire hitting him in the shoulder. The tranquilizer dart lodges in the cargo bay's ceiling.)</p>

<p>(RHONE grabs the rifle away from LORI HUTCHINS. He then grabs a tranq dart out of the holder and stabs it into LORI'S shoulder. She falls down backward into HIGH FOLLY'S stall.

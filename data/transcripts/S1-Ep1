<p><strong>Jim Brass</strong>: Suicide.</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: You think so, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Jim Brass</strong>: You got the sleeping bag for easy cleanup, the bathtub to catch the bullet, open window so the stench alerts the neighbors ... god bless him.</p>
<p>(JIM BRASS coughs. He flips the lights on. GRISSOM puts on his glasses to look at the scene.)</p>
<p><strong>Jim Brass</strong>: Oh, geez ...</p>
<p>(JIM BRASS clears throat )</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks around and finds something. He picks it up.)</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: Pupa, stage three.</p>
<p><strong>Jim Brass</strong>: English. I'm not an entomologist.</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: It's the third stage of larva metamorphosis. This guy's been dead seven days. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM puts the larva into a specimen container.)</p>
<p><strong>Jim Brass</strong>: That's a maggot, and he stinks. Oh, good, it's almost 11:00. Maybe if I'm lucky I can break out of here in time for a shot at the first rack of the Krispy Kreme.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM finds the microcassette tape recorder in ROYCE HARMON'S grip. He picks it up.)</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: I think we may have our suicide note.</p>

<hr />
[INT. PAIGE HARMON'S RESIDENCE - LATER -- NIGHT]</p>

<p>(They shake hands.)</p>
<p><strong>Holly Gribbs</strong>: Nice office.</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: Thanks. (beat) Would you mind taking off your jacket and rolling up your sleeve?</p>
<p><strong>Holly Gribbs</strong>: For what? </p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: I need a pint of your blood. It's customary for all new hires.</p>
<p><strong>Holly Gribbs</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: (he chuckles) So many reasons.</p>
<p>(HOLLY takes off her jacket.)</p>
<p><strong>Holly Gribbs</strong>: I-I haven't even clocked in yet.</p>

<p>(NICK punches the SOLVED magnet proudly with his fist. He smiles.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick Stokes</strong>: (under his breath) One more, baby, one more.</p>
<p>(NICK stares at the board proudly. WARRICK turns the corner and puts a hand on NICK'S shoulders. He turns to look at the board, too.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick Brown</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Nick Stokes</strong>: There he is. What's up?</p>
<p>(WARRICK takes the &quot;SOLVED&quot; magnet off of the WHITEBOARD and puts it directly in his column: &quot;WARRICK&quot; over the block: CRIME #99: ASSAULT. The other block in his list include: #100: ASSAULT and #98: ROBBERY.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick Brown</strong>: Ninety-nine. You and me, dead heat. Next crime solved gets promoted to CSI-3, man.</p>
<p><strong>Nick Stokes</strong>: Yeah, yeah, choice of shift, $8,000 raise, extra week vacation--  oh-ho, it's all about Cabo, bro.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick Brown</strong>: Twenty bucks, by the end of shift, I'm the man.</p>
<p><strong>Nick Stokes</strong>: Is there anything you won't bet on?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick Brown</strong>: Nah. It's college football season, man. I won eight of ten this weekend. Kilt 'em. Outside the Huskers and them punk-ass Irish, I'm up about four G's.</p>

[INT. GRISSOM'S OFFICE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM opens the refrigerator and puts a bottle inside. HOLLY GRIBBS holds a piece of cotton against the inside of her elbow as she's just given GRISSOM some blood.)</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: We scrutinize the crime scene, collect the evidence recreate what happened without ever having been there. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM closes the refrigerator door and turns around to look at HOLLY.)</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: Pretty cool, actually.</p>
<p><strong>Holly Gribbs</strong>: I just got out of the academy -- I already know this.</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: Of course you do. Then if you'll just sign these waivers for personal injury or death while in the line of duty, we can begin our shift.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM hands her a clipboard with the forms and gives her a pen. HOLLY leans over the desk and starts to sign the papers. She gets dizzy and stops.)</p>
<p><strong>Holly Gribbs</strong>: Mmm...</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: What's the matter?</p>
<p><strong>Holly Gribbs</strong>: Um ... I'm kind of light-headed.</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: Sit down, sit down. You're probably low on blood sugar. I've got just the thing.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns around and reaches into the refrigerator. There between the jar with the yellow liquid and the jar with the green sample, he takes out the jar with something black inside.)</p>
<p>(He opens it and offers it to HOLLY.)</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: Here, try one of these.</p>
<p><strong>Holly Gribbs</strong>: No offense, but I don't think I want to eat anything that's been in this office.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM pulls the jar away from her and looks at her. HOLLY reaches in the jar and takes one out. She examines it. GRISSOM also takes one.)</p>
<p><strong>Holly Gribbs</strong>: Is there a grasshopper in here?</p>
<p>(Looking directly at HOLLY, GRISSOM pops the grasshopper into his mouth and chews. HOLLY grimaces.)</p>

[INT. CSI - CONFERENCE ROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Everyone sits at the conference table. BRASS prepares to hand out assignments.)</p>
<p><strong>Jim Brass</strong>: When we get some free time, try and catch up on your reports. I'm getting a lot of heat from the sheriff's office. There, I said it. Administration, not my favorite thing. All right, here we go. Nick Stokes, 414, trick roll. Victim found drugged and robbed at the scene. </p>
<p>(NICK winces at the assignment.)</p>
<p><strong>Jim Brass</strong>: Warrick Brown, 407, home invasion, forced entry. Person reporting crime fired multiple rounds at the suspect. Suspect's condition is ... (BRASS glances up and sees HOLLY.) ... unknown. Anyone seen Catherine Willows?</p>

[INT. CSI - CAPTAIN BRASS' OFFICE - LATER -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(JIM BRASS is in his office. HOLLY GRIBBS stands in front of his desk.)</p>
<p><strong>Jim Brass</strong>: So your mother is Lieutenant Jane Gribbs from Traffic, is that right?</p>
<p><strong>Holly Gribbs</strong>: (smiles) Yes, sir. </p>
<p><strong>Jim Brass</strong>: Well, Congratulations, Gribbs. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM is also in the office. He takes a seat at the couch. BRASS holds out her file.)</p>
<p><strong>Jim Brass</strong>: You're the fifth person I've been forced to hire. We're the number two crime lab in the country. We solve crimes most labs render unsolvable. Now what makes you think you belong here?</p>
<p>(HOLLY glances at GRISSOM. When it's apparent that he's not going to answer for her, HOLLY turns back to BRASS.)</p>
<p><strong>Holly Gribbs</strong>: Sir, with all due respect I thought the key to being a lucid crime scene investigator was to reserve judgment until the evidence vindicates or eliminates assumption. </p>
<p>(BRASS glances at GRISSOM and smiles.)</p>
<p><strong>Holly Gribbs</strong>: You're prejudging me. I graduated with honors in criminal justice at UNLV.</p>
<p><strong>Jim Brass</strong>: (flippantly) Yeah, so?</p>
<p><strong>Holly Gribbs</strong>: That's not fair.</p>
<p><strong>Jim Brass</strong>: Fair? Well, you think putting a juiced-in Lieutenant's daughter on this shift is fair? You know, I've been in the field 22 years. I've seen it all. I've seen people like you come and go, and you know what? They don't amount to nothing but headaches and bad press. Dismissed.</p>
<p>(BRASS takes a seat at his desk.)</p>
<p><strong>Holly Gribbs</strong>: Fine.</p>
<p>(HOLLY leaves the office.)</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: Think you got through to her?</p>
<p><strong>Jim Brass</strong>: You're scheduled to appear at an autopsy at 12:30 A.M. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM stands up.)</p>
<p><strong>Jim Brass</strong>: They're cutting up that bozo put a hole in his chest. Take her with. I think every new hire should experience an autopsy on their first night.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns to leave the office.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and WARRICK cross under the crime scene tape and make their way to the front of the house.)</p>
<hr />
[INT. HOME - SUMMERLIN - FOYER -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The front double doors and open wide. Sprawled in the middle of the foyer is the dead body. CATHERINE looks down at it.)</p>
<p>(She looks up and sees the HUSBAND, WIFE and BABY standing in the middle of the living room. She and WARRICK both put their kits down on the ground as they prepare to get to work. CATHERINE looks up at the WIFE holding the BABY.)</p>
<p><strong>Wife</strong>: It's okay, shh.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine Willows</strong>: Ma'am ... are you all right?</p>
<p><strong>Husband</strong>: She's fine. She's just a little shook up is all.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick Brown</strong>: Somebody want to tell us what happened here tonight?</p>
<p><strong>Husband</strong>: My wife invited her drunk friend to stay here so he could get back on his feet. Two weeks tops, she says. That was six months ago.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The BABY'S screaming. JIMMY, the friend, sits on the couch laughing and watching tv. The HUSBAND walks into the house and picks up the CHILD.)</p>
<p><strong>Husband</strong>: Jimmy, Jimmy! Please take your sweaty feet off the head pillow. They stink.</p>
<p>(JIMMY throws the glass on the floor and it breaks.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: The HUSBAND tosses JIMMY out of the house. Cut to: The HUSBAND hands JIMMY his bags. Cut to: The HUSBAND gives JIMMY some money.)</p>
<p><strong>Husband</strong>: (to JIMMY) Here's a 20-- twice as much as you came with. Hit the road.</p>
<p>(Cut to: JIMMY pounds on the closed front door.)</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>: Open up!</p>
<p>(JIMMY grabs the door handles and tries to open the locked doors. He screams at the closed door.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: Inside, The HUSBAND loads his gun and stares at the front door. JIMMY continues to scream and pound on the door.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: JIMMY takes a step back and kicks the door open. He walks uninvited into the house. The HUSBAND gets the gun loaded. His WIFE screams.)</p>
<p>(The HUSBAND aims and fires.)</p>
<p><strong>The Husband</strong>: Call 911.</p>
<p>(The CHILD cries in the background.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Husband</strong>: That was it. I feared for my wife and my baby. Let's put the baby to bed.</p>
<p>(They head out of the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine Willows</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick Brown</strong>: Oh, he's lying. That's why I took this job. I can always tell when whitey's talking out his ass. It's a gift.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE puts the camera down and looks at WARRICK. She smiles.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine Willows</strong>: It's also your 100th.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick Brown</strong>: Yeah, that, too. So tonight you might say I'm extra suspicious.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE takes a picture of the shoe print on the front door.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine Willows</strong>: Why don't you print that tread and see how good you are?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE hands WARRICK a tape. He takes the shoe print. CATHERINE takes another picture of the door. WARRICK crosses over to the door to computer the two.)</p>
<p>(From the side, the HUSBAND watches.)</p>
<p><strong>Husband</strong>: Why are you doing that?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick Brown</strong>: It's just procedure, sir. We just want to make sure the shoe on the suspect is the same shoe that kicked down your door.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks at the shoes and stops.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine Willows</strong>: Wait ... wait a minute.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick Brown</strong>: What's the matter?</p>

[INT. HOTEL - MR. LAFERTY'S ROOM 1413 -- MORNING]</p>
<p><strong>Cue Sound</strong>: KNOCKING</p>
<p>(MR. LAFERTY opens the door. NICK is standing there holding up a paper package tied around the top with crime scene tape.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick Stokes</strong>: Room service.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Laferty</strong>: You're kidding me. </p>
<p>(MR. LAFERTY takes the package as NICK smiles at him. He opens the package and finds his wallet and other missing things.)</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Laferty</strong>: My stuff! You found my stuff!</p>
<p><strong>Nick Stokes</strong>: Yeah, yeah, your wallet, your cash, credit cards ... </p>
<p>(NICK holds out the ... )</p>
<p><strong>Nick Stokes</strong>: ... wedding ring ... </p>
<p>(MR. LAFERTY looks at it and sighs with relief.)</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Laferty</strong>: Oh, thank god.</p>
<p>(He grabs the ring and puts it on.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick Stokes</strong>: Okay, next time you wanna take a shot go to the dice table. At least if you crap out, you can go home broke instead of busted, you know what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Laferty</strong>: I sure do. Thank you.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - BREAK ROOM -- MORNING]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM dangles NICK'S new ID badge in front of him.)</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: Congratulations, Nickie, my boy. You are now a C.S.I. Level 3.</p>
<p><strong>Nick Stokes</strong>: Whoo!</p>
<p><strong>Warrick Brown</strong>: Good job, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>Nick Stokes</strong>: Thanks. Uh, hey, Warrick, listen I heard about the whole thing with the shoe and ...</p>
<p><strong>Warrick Brown</strong>: Forget it, man. It's all you.</p>
<p>(WARRICK stands up and they shake hands.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick Stokes</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: All right.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine Willows</strong>: Let's get some breakfast. It's on me!</p>
<p>(BRASS appears in the doorway and sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Jim Brass</strong>: (gravely) Sorry to break up your party but I need grave to pull a double. Holly Gribbs has been shot. She's in surgery now. Apparently the suspect returned to the scene. They don't think she's gonna make it. Brown, I'm putting you on administrative leave pending a full report of your whereabouts. So wash your face and change your socks. You have a long day ahead of you.</p>
<p>(BRASS turns and leaves the room.)</p>
<p>(WARRICK sighs.)</p>
<p>(CAMERA holds on GRISSOM.)</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>

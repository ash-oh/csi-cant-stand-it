<p><strong>Man</strong>: (V.O.) I saw you with him. I know you're lying.</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: (V.O.) (screaming) You've got it all wrong. I'm telling you. Nothing happened.</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: The MAN wraps the belt around the woman's neck and chokes her.)</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: Nobody cheats on me.</p>
<p>(The WOMAN continues to scream and yell.)</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: I hate you. How could you do this to me?</p>
<p>(The MAN chokes the WOMAN. She struggles.)</p>
<p><strong>Lizette</strong>: (V.O.) His fingerprints were all over that belt.</p>
<p>[INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY]</p>
<p><strong>Lizette</strong>: That's the only way it could have happened.</p>
<p><strong>Bob Durham</strong>: I'm with Lizette, all right? We heard from the D.A. They called the cops last week on a domestic disturbance.</p>
<p><strong>Davis</strong>: Kimble was just getting warmed up. Believe me. I know the type.</p>
<p><strong>Brown-haired Juror</strong>: Husband was a casino host. Just happens to come home in the middle of a shift? Come on.</p>
<p><strong>Jervis</strong>: Oh, look, we've really talked this thing to death, haven't we?</p>
<p><strong>Tara Newsome</strong>: (stilted) Chris, can we please put this to another vote?</p>
<p>(CHRIS looks around the table at the faces of the other anxious jurors. After a long pause, he comments.)</p>
<p><strong>Chris Gibbons</strong>: The burden of proof is beyond a reasonable doubt. </p>
<p>(Everyone lets out a frustrated breath.)</p>
<p><strong>Chris Gibbons</strong>: We don't have that. There was somebody else in the house that day. The cable guy.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The CABLE GUY is choking MRS. KIMBLE when MR. KIMBLE comes in and breaks it up.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Chris Gibbons</strong>: Cable guy's got priors. He skipped town.</p>
<p><strong>Bob Durham</strong>: You're still on the cable guy theory? His fingerprints weren't even on the belt.</p>
<p>(JERVIS bites his nails nervously.)</p>
<p><strong>Chris Gibbons</strong>: He could have worn gloves.</p>
<p><strong>Jervis</strong>: (frustrated) I can't take this anymore! </p>
<p>(JERVIS stands up and goes to the window. He opens it.)</p>
<p><strong>Jervis</strong>: Who keeps shutting this damn window?</p>
<p><strong>Lizette</strong>: Lunch will be here soon. Let's take a break.</p>
<p>(Everyone stands up.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[HALLWAY NEAR VENDING MACHINES]</p>
<p>(JERVIS stands at the vending machine with the DARK-HAIRED WOMAN.)</p>
<p><strong>Jervis</strong>: This guy is driving me nuts.</p>
<p>(On the other side of the hallway, BOB DURHAM talks with DAVIS.</p>
<p><strong>Bob Durham</strong>: We've got to get Chris Gibbons replaced. </p>
<p><strong>Davis</strong>: Oh, I pointed him in the right direction, but he didn't snap.</p>
<p>(TARA NEWSOME walks up to the JERVIS: </p>
<p><strong>Tara Newsome</strong>: I'd kill for a candy bar right now.</p>
<p>(The BAILIFF walks out into the hallway to make an announcement.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Hey, people. Your lunch is getting cold.</p>
<p>(Everyone heads back into the conference room.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(The jurors open the double doors to the conference room and the group walks inside. They're preoccupied chatting with each other. Suddenly they stop and notice CHRIS GIBBONS lying on the floor dead.) </p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO:</p>
<p>[INT. CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(GRISSOM ducks under the crime scene tape barring the doorway. He walks into the conference room carrying his kit. He meets BRASS who is standing over the body.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Chris Gibbons, UNLV grad student. The jury's been sequestered two and a half weeks on a murder trial.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Twelve strangers ... stuck in a room with no exit. It's like Sartre said: &quot;Hell is other people.&quot;</p>

<p>(White flash to:</p>
<p>[INT. COURTHOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM stands over the body taking pictures. BRASS walks up to him.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What do you got?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: My early opinion? Blunt force.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: CHRIS GIBBONS sits at the conference table. Someone walks up to him, grabs his head and slams it against the table. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(They both kneel down to look over the body. GRISSOM notices the bracelet.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He's got a, uh, medical alert bracelet. Allergy to penicillin.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well ... we got eleven potential suspects.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM finds a strand of hair on the victim's shirt. He picks it up with a tweezer.)</p>
<p>(Camera zooms in for a close up of the hair.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Do you have one with blond hair?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah. There's one I know of. Um, Miss Davis -- she's a stripper at The Shimmer.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at the hair and notices that it doesn't have a tag.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: There's no tag cells, and she's not a natural blonde, and it looks synthetic.</p>
<p>(BRASS stands over by the counter looking through the slips of paper.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hey, this is Vegas, baby. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at BRASS.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (reading) Guilty. Guilty. &quot;Not Guilty.&quot; Eleven &quot;guilty,&quot; one &quot;not guilty.&quot; Now that's motive.</p>
<p>(BRASS turns to GRISSOM and holds up the slips of paper.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. COURTHOUSE - HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(The jurors stand out in the hallway talking amongst themselves. CATHERINE walks up to them.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (loudly) Excuse me. May I have your...?</p>
<p>(The crowd doesn't notice CATHERINE and continues conversing.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (louder) Excuse me. May I have your attention, please?</p>
<p>(The crowd slowly quiets down.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Thank you. I'm Catherine Willows. I'm from the crime lab.</p>
<p>(The BROWN-HAIRED JUROR gets to his feet.)</p>
<p><strong>Brown-haired Juror</strong>: So it's a mistrial, right?</p>
<p><strong>Tara Newsome</strong>: Can we go home?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No. I'm sorry. No one is going anywhere. Ms. Davis. I'll start with you. Will you follow me, please?</p>

[INT. COURTHOUSE - ROOM - DAY -- CONTINUOUS] </p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Miss Davis, we found a synthetic blond hair on the victim's body. Care to explain?</p>
<p>(MS. DAVIS removes her wig.)</p>
<p><strong>Davis</strong>: Girl to girl. I'm a dancer. I came off the pole. I teased him a little bit. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: CHRIS GIBBONS stands in front of the vending machines. MS. DAVIS approaches him and leans her back against the machines, looking at CHRIS.) </p>
<p><strong>Davis</strong>: I need a release, so why don't you get us out of here, and I'll ...</p>
<p>(She moves closer to him, her arms around his neck and whispers into his ear.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Did he take you up on your offer?</p>
<p><strong>Davis</strong>: Well, if you ask me, arguing was his turn-on.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Lucky for you. Attempting to influence is a category D Felony. It's up to four years in prison and a $5,000 fine.</p>
<p><strong>Davis</strong>: Am I under arrest?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Woman to woman? The pole is there for a reason. It's what you hang on to so the creeps don't pull you out of there. Smarten up.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(NICK is at the front counter signing some papers.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Thanks, man.</p>
<p>(He finishes and heads out when DETECTIVE VARTANN rounds the corner and finds him.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Stokes.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Detective. Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Hey. You've got a minute?</p>
<p>(They shake hands.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah. Sure, what's up?</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Four years ago, you and Grissom worked a missing persons out in Moapa Valley? She lived on a farm with her husband?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Wow. Um ... (trying to remember) ... yeah, I remember uh-uh, Rita?</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Rita Westonson.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Found nothing suspicious. Nothing criminal. Figured she wanted to skip town, disappear.</p>

[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(NICK and DET. VARTANN interview FAYE MINDEN.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Faye, it's been four years since your sister went missing. Now, CSI conducted a full investigation -- found nothing suspicious, nothing criminal. Why are you coming forward now?</p>
<p><strong>Faye Minden</strong>: I lied to you back then, and I live with the guilt every day.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Miss Minden? It's my duty to advise you of your right to counsel.</p>
<p><strong>Faye Minden</strong>: I don't want an attorney. I admit I withheld information. That's why I'm here. And if I have to go to jail, so be it. I just want to do right by my sister.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay. Let's start from the beginning. Your sister disappeared over a weekend ... </p>
<p><strong>Faye Minden</strong>: Rita didn't disappear. Her business trip to Fresno got cut short, and she came home early.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The barn door opens and RITA WESTONSON sees her husband AARON with another woman.)</p>
<p><strong>Faye Minden</strong>: (V.O.) And she found Aaron, her husband, in the barn with another woman.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>

<p>(Quick flashback to: RITA is hit and she falls to the ground. AARON stands over her.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Now if memory serves, her husband had an alibi?</p>
<p><strong>Faye Minden</strong>: Yeah. He was camping in red rock with Harris Mathey.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: That's his business partner, right?</p>
<p><strong>Faye Minden</strong>: Yeah, but Harris owed Aaron a lot of money. He would have said anything.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: If that's true, Mr. Mathey is guilty of conspiracy after the fact.</p>
<p><strong>Faye Minden</strong>: He died last month. And he's the only one who knew, besides me.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Do you know what Aaron did with Rita's body?</p>
<p>(She looks at NICK and nods.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: AARON carries RITA'S body and puts it in a barrel. He slides the barrel to the back of his truck and fills the barrel up with gas.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Faye Minden</strong>: He drove her out to the river, about a half mile from his farm, and, um, set her on fire. She burned all night, and then in the morning, he dumped her ashes in the water.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Miss Minden ... how did you come across this information?</p>
<p>(She looks at them both.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You were the other woman.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />

<p><strong>Jervis</strong>: You ever been on a jury before?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The jury sits around the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Lizette</strong>: How many grad students does it take to screw in a lightbulb?</p>
<p><strong>Jervis</strong>: I can't take this anymore!</p>
<p>(JERVIS surges to his feet and heads for the window to open it. He uses his hand, the one that he's been biting, and opens the window leaving a smudge of blood on the opener.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Jervis</strong>: It's the worst experience of my life.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Would you hold your hands up for me, please?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks over to him as he holds out his hands over the table, palms down.)</p>
<p><strong>Jervis</strong>: The case was a lock anyway. I mean, Kimble obviously had...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mr. Jervis. I need to remind you that you're still under judge's orders not to discuss the case.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE puts on her gloves.)</p>
<p><strong>Jervis</strong>: That's great. This guy's dead, and I still can't go home? Let me tell you something. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE swabs JERVIS' bloodied fingertips.)</p>
<p><strong>Jervis</strong>: From the very beginning, day one day after day, this guy is the only holdout. Do you want to know what my boss calls me? &quot;Mr. Replaceable&quot;.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The jury argues around the table while CHRIS GIBBONS sits at the head smiling, watching yet not participating . JERVIS sits next to him and finally blows up. He grabs CHRIS GIBBONS by the arms.)</p>

[INT. CSI - LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(NICK takes out the photos from the closed case box and goes through them. GRISSOM walks past the evidence room and finds NICK looking over the file. He walks into the room.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Homicide just called. They're reopening the Rita Westonson case based on new information from the eyewitness?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: File's thinner than I remembered.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You think we missed something?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: We figured she skipped town, wanting to disappear. At the time, that was a reasonable conclusion based on the evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Does the witness seem credible to you?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, if she's lying, she's obstructing justice and wasting my time, but if she's telling the truth, we may have closed the investigation early.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: At the time, you were a level two, I believe. So closing the case would have been my decision.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, it would have. I'm checking out her story. I'll see if it holds up.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Let me know.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks out of the lab.)</p>

<p>(He points to the hives covering CHRIS GIBBONS' chest.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hives? Whoo. Severe allergic reaction.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Cause of death: Anaphylactic shock. Outer skin becomes irritated, the eyes inflamed, throat closes ...</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV of the throat as the camera pulls back. The walls in the throat constrict and the person gasps. Camera pulls back out through the mouth. End of CGI POV. Resume to flashback of CHRIS GIBBONS standing in the conference room choking.)</p>
<p>(CHRIS falls and hits his head against the table.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: He was allergic to penicillin, but that's not the kind of thing you can just easily slip someone.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: No, but you can inject it. </p>
<p>(ROBBINS moves further down the body and lifts up the sheet to show SARA the puncture wound in CHRIS GIBBONS' thigh.) </p>
<p>(Camera zooms in for a close up of the puncture wound.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Puncture wound is consistent with a hypodermic needle.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: He wore a medic alert bracelet. Everyone hated him, and everyone knew how to kill him.</p>

<p>(FAYE MINDEN shows NICK and DET. VARTANN where the body was burned.) </p>
<p><strong>Faye Minden</strong>: Haven't been back here since that night. Sometimes it feels like yesterday; sometimes it feels like it never happened. Funny, the things you remember.</p>
<p>(She looks around and continues walking. NICK eyes her strangely. She comes to an area and slows as she takes in the place.)</p>
<p><strong>Faye Minden</strong>: Who could've imagined?</p>
<p>(She sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Faye Minden</strong>: This is it. This is the spot under the tree.</p>
<p>(DET. VARTANN points.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>Faye Minden</strong>: Yes. This is where Aaron burned her body. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [NIGHT] AARON lights a match over the barrel as FAYE watches. Inside the barrel is RITA'S body in gasoline, her dead eyes wide open and staring at nothing. He tosses the match in and watches it burn.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Faye Minden</strong>: I remember the ... yucca plant was flowering.</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No. So I stuck a moisture testing probe into the ground at the burn site, registered 18%. Now anything over 10% is indicative of full saturation over the last couple of years.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The river might have washed away all trace of hydrocarbons.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Exactly, but before it washed away, some of the hydrocarbons could have seeped into the ground into the tree's roots. Roots carry nutrients to the tree. Some of the hydrocarbons could have hitched a ride. Oaks don't bear fruit, but this one bears witness. </p>
<p>(NICK turns around to the board where he has more than 18 photos of the tree rings posted. He explains it to GRISSOM.) </p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did the assay test show any other food allergies?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: No, uh-uh.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So the cause of death is still anaphylactic shock.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Okay, what caused it?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And who?</p>
<p>FADE OUT</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[MONITOR] </p>
<p>(The NEVADA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION DATABASE is loading up to the computer. NICK waits. DET. VARTANN walks into the lab.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: I got your page. Who shot your dog?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Trace Tech. He analyzed the fuel from Aaron's pump. Confirmed it's diesel. The hydrocarbons found in the tree were from unleaded gasoline.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Means the fuel on Aaron's farm was not used to cremate Rita's body. Maybe it pumped unleaded four years ago. Converted to diesel at some point since.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Ah, I thought the same thing myself, so I called the NDEP.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: The permit for Aaron's fuel tank was specifically for diesel. </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Where does that leave us?</p>
<p>(The database finishes the search and a map appears on screen.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: NDEP's database for Clark County. Now, the red dots represent the areas of permitted fuel tanks.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Isolate Moapa.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Aaron's farm's located at the cross streets of White Oak and Stansberry.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: The burn spot is a half mile east along the river.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Only two permitted fuel tanks up in that area. The one on the left is Aaron's. We can exclude that one .</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Who owns the other one?</p>
<p>The information box appears:<br />
LOCATION: 2157 Whispering Leaves Dr.<br />
REGISTERED <strong>Owner</strong>: FAYE MINDEN</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Faye Minden.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(ROBBINS examines the hives on CHRIS GIBBONS' body and explains it to GRISSOM.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: We've ruled out food allergy as the cause of death. If it was an environmental agent, I expect one of the other jurors had a reaction as well. His body reacted to something. It's why I'm reexamining the exposed areas of his body -- face and the neck.</p>
<p>(ROBBINS finds something. Camera zooms in as ROBBINS extracts the stinger from CHRIS' neck.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Look at this.</p>
<p>(He holds it out to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Apis mellifera linnaeus. We're looking for another body.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS COURTHOUSE (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. COURTHOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(GRISSOM and SARA search the floors for the source of CHRIS GIBBONS' allergies.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Greg ran the assay test for bee venom on Chris Gibbons. IG levels were spiked.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Was Gibbons even aware that he had a bee allergy?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Brass finally tracked down his allergist. Gibbons was allergic to a lot of things.</p>
<p>(They continue to search the floors. SARA finds it.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The killer, I presume.</p>
<p>(She picks up the dead bee from the table leg. GRISSOM kneels down next to her.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Or what's left of him.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [BEE'S POV] The bee flies around the room and stings CHRIS GIBBONS on the neck. CHRIS starts to gasp for breath.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: He had an immediate reaction to a bee sting.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Lost consciousness, fell forward, hit his head on the table.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You know how Jervis was complaining that it was too hot. He said he opened the window.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [CONFERENCE ROOM] JERVIS stands up, frustrated.)</p>
<p><strong>Jervis</strong>: I can't take this anymore! </p>
<p>(He heads over to the window.)</p>
<p><strong>Jervis</strong>: Who keeps shutting this damn window?!</p>
<p>(As he holds the window open, we see the bee slip into the room.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, that explains it. It was an outside job.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM glances at SARA. She smiles.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. MINDEN RESIDENCE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(NICK and DET. VARTAN'S car drives up and parks in front of FAYE MINDEN as she speaks with the FOREMAN.) </p>
<p><strong>Faye Minden</strong>: Okay, good. Thank you.</p>
<p>(NICK and DET. VARTANN exit the vehicle. FAYE sees them and smiles.)</p>
<p><strong>Faye Minden</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Faye Minden</strong>: Heard you were over at Aaron's farm.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yep.</p>
<p><strong>Faye Minden</strong>: (smiling) I bet that shook him up. Thank you for pushing forward with the investigation.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: And we continue to push forward. We need to take a sample of fuel from your pump.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah. Yeah, you wouldn't mind, would you, Faye?</p>
<p><strong>Faye Minden</strong>: My pump?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Faye Minden</strong>: Well, what'd he say? Didn't I tell you he'd turn on me?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Oh, he didn't say anything. Just want to take a look.</p>
<p>(NICK walks over to the gasoline tank. It's green and labeled: UNLEADED. He puts his kit down.)</p>
<p><strong>Faye Minden</strong>: My trees are Douglas Firs. The ... the needles grow in spirals around the twigs. It's amazing. Any time you guys want, you come back here, take your pick. Free of charge.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: The pump on Aaron's farm is diesel. Your sister was cremated with unleaded.</p>
<p>(He looks at her for an explanation. She thinks about it.)</p>
<p><strong>Faye Minden</strong>: You know what? Thinking back now, I-I remember Aaron's pump was empty, and, uh, he insisted we drive over here. He used mine. Sorry for the confusion.</p>
<p>(NICK looks past FAYE at her barn.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>Faye Minden</strong>: Please say you believe me.</p>
<p>(NICK doesn't say anything and heads for the barn.) </p>
<p>[BARN] </p>
<p>(The barn doors open and NICK walks inside. He looks around. The camera notes the barrels lined up along side the inner wall. NICK walks inside and sees the various tools lined up on the table. He sprays the tools looking for evidence of blood.) </p>
<p>(The cutters glow.) </p>
<p>[EXT. - DAY -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(NICK walks out of the barn carrying the cutters.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I believe you, Faye. You see, blood evidence doesn't disappear over time. Your sister was murdered ... by you.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [BARN] The barn door opens and RITA walks inside.)</p>
<p><strong>Rita Minden-Westanson</strong>: Faye? Faye, you in here?</p>
<p>(FAYE jumps RITA from behind and hits her with the cutters.) </p>
<p>(Cut to: FAYE lights a match and throws it into the barrel.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (V.O.) Unleaded gasoline, barrels for incineration, cast off on the walls. DNA consistent with Rita Westonson. </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to GRISSOM'S OFFICE.)</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - GRISSOM'S OFFICE] </p>
<p>(NICK explains the results of the investigation to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Faye killed Rita to be with Aaron. And a couple of weeks ago, hears he's getting engaged to her younger sister Terry. They couldn't handle it, man. She just freaked. So she tried to pin Rita's murder on Aaron.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Four years ago when I decided to close the case, did you agree with my decision?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes the file and heads back to his desk.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, you were following protocol.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And now?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Now I'd fight you on it, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Rita Westonson was a dependable, predictable girl. We never answered the question why she just woke up one morning and walked away from the rest of her life.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It happens. And that's what the evidence was telling us.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, that's what the physical evidence was telling us. We should have dug deeper. You can't just ignore the human element, Grissom.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I agree, Nick. But when you start to have feelings for the people involved, you risk your objectivity.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So what? You know, I'm always getting criticized for empathizing with the victims and their families, but that's who I am. That's how I do my job. And as far as the promotion goes, it's all good, man. I can live without it. I'm not you.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Good. We certainly don't need another me around here.</p>
<p>(NICK leaves. GRISSOM starts typing.) </p>
<p>To: Robert Cavallo, Assistant Director, CSI From: Gil Grissom, Night Shift Supervisor, CSI Subject: CSI promotion</p>
<p>Dear Sir,<br />
I strongly recommend Nick Stokes for the promotion to Lead CSI.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM stops typing and he smiles.)</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK</p>

[INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(BARRY SCHICKLE and three other boys come out into the hallway. One of the boys is carrying a basketball. A school bell rings in the background.)</p>
<p><strong>Barry Schickle</strong>: I'm telling you, man.</p>
<p><strong>Friend</strong>: See ya, bro.</p>
<p><strong>Barry Schickle</strong>: Later, losers.</p>
<p>(The three boys walk down one hallway and BARRY SCHICKLE walks down another hallway. BARRY SCHICKLE looks behind him to make sure that no one's there, reaches into his backpack with one fluid motion and pulls out a spray can. He stops in front of the long row of student lockers and with a final look to make sure that he is truly alone, he confidently sprays &quot;STICK&quot; in orange on a particular locker. He shows no hesitation. It's as if he's done this a million times before.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. HIGH SCHOOL - BATHROOM - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Close up of door handle as BARRY SCHICKLE enters the men's bathroom. He positions himself in front of the urinal and faces the mirror. Something distracts him and he turns around. He ducks as the first gunshot hits the corner of the mirror, shattering it. The next three shots hit Barry in the back. He falls to the floor.)</p>
<p>FLASH OF WHITE TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. HIGH SCHOOL - BATHROOM - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Barry Schickel. Wallet's still with him. With cash. &quot;A&quot; student. Recently voted class clown.</p>
<p>(BRASS and GRISSOM are standing over the dead body. An officer stands just on the inside of the men's bathroom door. GRISSOM kneels down next to the body for a closer look.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Strange, people usually aren't scared of class clowns.</p>
<p>(He looks up at BRASS. BRASS also kneels down next to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Who said the shooter was scared.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Shot him in the back.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: With his zipper down and his hands otherwise engaged.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah. We're looking for a coward.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO: END OF TEASER. ROLL TITLE CREDITS.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<hr />
[INT. HIGH SCHOOL - ENTRANCE / HALLWAY -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Two people from the coroner's office wheel out BARRY SCHICKLE'S body in a bag on a gurney. They pass WARRICK and CATHERINE on the way out as they walk into the school. Both are carrying their CSI kits. They turn the corner and Catherine sees the janitor cleaning off the orange spray-painted graffiti on the locker. The same graffiti made by BARRY SCHICKLE.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Janitor</strong>: Removing graffiti.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: There's been a murder here. Nothing gets cleaned.</p>
<p><strong>Janitor</strong>: School policy, Miss. I have to get this graffiti down as soon as ...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Everything is Evidence. Policy of the Las Vegas Crime Lab. Should we call the Sheriff?</p>
<p>(The janitor takes one look at CATHERINE'S unwavering expression and relents.)</p>
<p><strong>Janitor</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>(The janitor puts his cleaning things down and leaves everything as is. WARRICK and CATHERINE continue on.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Bet you were like that in high school.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Worse.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Oh, you were the girl I ran away from.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah. Till you caught me.</p>
<p>(WARRICK laughs. CATHERINE smiles.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. HIGH SCHOOL - MEN'S BATHROOM -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(BRASS is questioning the School's Principal while GRISSOM is busy looking at the bullet lodged in the mirror.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, you say that football practice was over at 5:45?</p>
<p><strong>Principal Perrin</strong>: That's right.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: And it was okay for a student like this victim to return to the school property to use the restroom. That wasn't out of the ordinary?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM locates the bullet.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (interrupting) Hand me a bindle.</p>
<p>(PRINCIPAL PERRIN momentarily turns to GRISSOM. The unknown person off screen hands GRISSOM a bindle. He continues to extract the bullet lodged in the wall.)</p>
<p><strong>Principal Perrin</strong>: Place isn't locked up till the janitor leaves end of his shift eight, eight-thirty. Until then, the kids at after-school events use the facilities.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM removes the bullet.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (interrupting) Brass ...</p>
<p><strong>Principal Perrin</strong>: (more than annoyed) Excuse me, one of my students is dead. Are we interrupting you?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns around to look at the man.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah. A little.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (to PRINCIPAL PERRIN) That's okay. I'll drop by your office. We'll finish it there.</p>
<p>(PRINCIPAL PERRIN leaves the men's room.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (to GRISSOM) You found a slug. So, the treasure hunt paid off, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, it better. We have a point of reference.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM puts a pink marker in the bullet hole in the wall.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, the nerd squad is off and running. I'm going to ... uh ... burn a little shoe leather and see whether the victim had a beef with anyone.</p>
<p>(BRASS leaves the men's room.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. OUTSKIRTS LAS VEGAS - RED ROCK -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(A Police Rescue helicopter flies over head.)</p>
<p><strong>Rescue One</strong>: (over radio) Rescue One over drop site. We have a visual, Baker One. </p>
<p>(On the helicopter, Sara is in her #36 hat and Nick in his #19 hat both waiting to be taken to their location.)</p>
<p><strong>Rescue One</strong>: (over radio) Stand by for Eastern Approach.</p>
<p>(The Rescue helicopter hovers over it's location.)</p>
<p><strong>Rescue One</strong>: (over radio) CSI. Ready for descent.</p>
<p><strong>Man on Rescue One</strong>: (to NICK) You're good to go.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay! There he is. Let's get down there.</p>
<p>(Both NICK and SARA throw their ropes off the helicopter. NICK turns to SARA ... )</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Ready?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (smiling) I'll race you!</p>
<p>(They both rappel down their ropes and in no time, they're on the ground.)</p>
<p><strong>Rescue One</strong>: (over radio) CSI is through the air.</p>
<p><strong>Rescue One</strong>: (over radio) CSI is on the ground.</p>
<p>(On the ground, they are met by an Emergency Services Man standing guard over the large leather bag.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Stokes! Sidle! Crime Lab. Did you open the bag?</p>
<p><strong>Hank Peddigrew (emergency service man)</strong>: Only long enough to see one gnarly looking hand. Well, skeleton of a hand.</p>
<p>(SARA takes off her helmet. NICK crouches low to look at the bag. He notices the smell.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Anyone touch the bag since?</p>
<p><strong>Hank Peddigrew</strong>: With that smell?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I thought you Emergency Service guys were tougher than that.</p>
<p><strong>Hank Peddigrew</strong>: Hey, I'm plenty tough.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (smiling) Down, boy. It was a joke.</p>
<p>(NICK gets up from his position next to the body and walks toward SARA. He has a large grin on his face and is laughing openly at SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (to SARA) He-he. Nothing like flirting over a D.B.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (to PEDDIGREW) You want to airlift the body to the coroner's. We'll radio ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Hank Peddigrew</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Great.</p>
<p>(SARA pulls out a knife and begins to cut the handles off from the bag.)</p>
<p><strong>Hank Peddigrew</strong>: Are you supposed to do that already?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Body's coroner's. Property's ours.</p>
<p>(Camera holds on HANK PEDDIGREW'S smile, then refocuses on NICK as he looks up and puts his helmet back on. The helicopter overhead drops the hook. The hook is attached to the basket holding the bag. It takes off, taking its cargo with it.)</p>
<p><strong>Rescue One</strong>: (over radio) We have the basket. Copy that. Rescue One returning to base.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. HIGH SCHOOL - MEN'S BATHROOM -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(WARRICK and CATHERINE walk in. Apparently they are a bit late. GRISSOM has been busy in their absence.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hi. </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Construction on Flamingo. I'm sorry. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to WARRICK) Give me a hand, will you? </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(WARRICK puts his kit down. GRISSOM takes out some pink-colored string and begins unraveling it and heads toward the bullet hole in the wall. WARRICK takes a closer look at the hole.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: A .38? </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: .44. Here, take this. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM hands the string to WARRICK. CATHERINE notices an orange smudged-up thumbprint on the wall in the bathroom stall. The camera does a close up of the print.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Brass said the victim had a can of spray paint, right? </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Orange, by my kit. It was in his backpack.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE snaps a picture of the print. She turns and looks at the spray can in the zip locked baggie near the backpack. She crouches down, picks up the paint can and sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did you get something? </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Paint from another source. I'm going to find out who belongs to that locker. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE leaves. WARRICK is holding the spool of pink string and is standing on the opposite side of the bathroom from GRISSOM who is holding the end of the string against the bullet hole in the wall. They're trying to estimate the height and position of the shooter.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Kind of weird being in a high school. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: They do have a timeless quality. </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What were you? A jock or a brain?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I was a ghost.</p>
<p>(WARRICK laughs at the response. GRISSOM smiles.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Here.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM removes the pink marker from the bullet hole in the wall and looks across the room at WARRICK.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Shooter was standing right there. </p>
<p>(WARRICK holds out his index finger and thumb as if holding an imaginary gun. He fires.)</p>
<p>(Begin bluish-white hazy flashback. Camera moves along the pink-colored string in the same trajectory as the bullet shot. The other gunshots follow. As it passes the urinal, it hits BARRY SCHICKLE, who is standing there with this backpack. The camera continues it's movement till we see GRISSOM also in the frame. BARRY SCHICKLE falls to the floor in a puddle of blood ... and disappears. End of flashback.)</p>
<p>(Resume on GRISSOM. GRISSOM kneels where BARRY SCHICKLE fell. Right in front of the blood markings on the floor.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And ... ? </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Reconstruction guys can give us a more precise angle measurement, but I'm thinking ... five-four ... maybe three. We got ourselves a shorty.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT CSI - CORONER'S OFFICE]</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Let's see what metal shows up. </p>
<p>(Using a machine to x-ray into the bag without actually opening it, DAVID PHILLIPS, NICK and SARA examine its metallic contents.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, there's no gun on our dead body. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Wouldn't it be easier to just unzip the bag and see what kind of shape our vic is in?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: (smiling) I like to put that off till the last possible moment with decomps. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I see a coin. Looks like a half dollar. </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Silver, whole. (Off SARA'S look) I've done a few of these. </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What's that? There. About four inches long. What is that? </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: It looks like a pin. It's a medical implant. </p>
<p>(They pull the table the bag rests on completely through the machine.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Oh, and that's a plate in the skull. The head's been rolled.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'd say we're dealing with a man.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Yeah, and by the sound of things he's been dead about two months. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Sound? </p>
<p>(DAVID PHILLIPS reaches out to rustle the bag. Inside, we hear the shloshing sound of liquid.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: You weren't here when ESD brought this in. </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, it wasn't from lack of trying.</p>
<p>(SARA looks at NICK ... and smiles.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Let's go to the V.I.P. room ... I'll show you what I mean. </p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY IN FRONT OF LOCKERS]</p>
<p>(Extreme close up of orange fingerprint. Flash to white. Camera moves back to reveal the bright light of the flashlight shining on the bottom of the orange spray-painted letter &quot;t&quot; on the locker. CATHERINE fingers the portion of the letter that was smudged.)</p>
<p>(Camera slowly moves left and stops on JULIA BARRETT, the school's counselor.)</p>
<p><strong>Julia Barett</strong>: That's Dennis Fram's locker. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And was this a first or has the deceased spray-painted his locker before? </p>
<p><strong>Julia Barett</strong>: Look, I'm the school counselor I don't know every move these kids make.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, that's obvious or a young man wouldn't be dead. Tell me what &quot;stick&quot; means. </p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. HIGH SCHOOL - MEN'S BATHROOM]</p>
<p>(Close up on a walkie-talkie shaped hand-held device. Camera moves back and we see that WARRICK is holding the device out in front of him and doing a slow air-sweep of the bathroom stall where the shooter was supposedly standing.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM passes by WARRICK and notices the device.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Is that a Polymer Sensor Proboscis? </p>
<p>(WARRICK stops what he's doing and shows the device to GRISSOM, who takes it and looks at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Cyranose 320. Company sent it to me, gratis for a week. They figure if it helps, CSI will buy one.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Electronic noses run like ten grand.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, well ... what if the shooter chews a certain kind of tobacco or has a unique halitosis and the e-nose picks up on it?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: If that thing ran out of here and bit the shooter in the ass, the county would not approve a $10,000 purchase order.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM hands the device back to WARRICK, turns and heads toward his kit. He kneels and begins putting something together. WARRICK slowly sweeps the air in the stall as GRISSOM speaks.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I thought it was our job to speak for the victim no matter what it took ... and to hell with the budgets.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Our job is to think, Warrick. Machinery should never matter more than our mind. Try this ... </p>
<p>(GRISSOM stands and hands WARRICK an Erlenmeyer flask, a tube with a rubber stopper and a pump. He squeezes the pump a few times before giving it all to WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Glass tube. Air pump ... </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Air pump. Cost about ten bucks.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns and heads out the restroom.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Absorption agent?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns back to WARRICK, glances down at his kit and smiles.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Fresh out. Improvise.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM leaves the restroom and WARRICK holding the ten grand e-nose in his right hand and the ten dollar air pump in his left hand.)</p>
<p>(WARRICK sighs.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY IN FRONT OF LOCKERS]</p>
<p>(Out in the hallway, four boys stand with a guard near the yellow-taped barrier blocking off the hallway. CATHERINE fills GRISSOM in on the kid who belonged to the spray-canned locker. The school counselor, JULIA BARRETT is with them.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And Miss Barrett says that a Dennis Fram had been bullied by the deceased all year. He spray-painted his locker many times always something to do with his build. &quot;Skinny,&quot; &quot;shorty&quot; ... that kind of thing.</p>
<p><strong>Julia Barett</strong>: Dennis is slight and Barry always picks on him for it.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Can you arrange for us to meet with Dennis?</p>
<p><strong>Julia Barett</strong>: Of course, but he would never hurt Barry. He's a good kid. He's totally nonviolent.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, then, this will be brief.</p>
<p>(JULIA BARRETT sighs. She turns and walks down the hallway toward her office. GRISSOM starts to follow. CATHERINE turns back to look at the locker. )</p>
<p><strong>Julia Barett</strong>: (o.s.) We can call him from my office.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM notices that CATHERINE isn't following. He stops. JULIA BARRETT continues down the hallway.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You coming?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, I'll catch up to you.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns and follows JULIA BARRETT. CATHERINE looks around and sees THE JANITOR carrying a ladder walking along the hallway past the various colored signs hanging on the wall. He stops when CATHERINE calls out to him.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey ... I need to talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>Janitor</strong>: (defensively) I didn't clean anything.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (shakes her head) It's not about that.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>

[INT. HIGH SCHOOL - JULIA BARRETT'S OFFICE]</p>
<p>(JULIA BARRETT is sitting behind her desk. GRISSOM is leaning against a pillar in her office and DENNIS FRAM is standing in front of JULIA BARRETT'S desk.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How tall are you, Dennis?</p>
<p><strong>Dennis Fram</strong>: (looks nervously at JULIA BARRETT) Five-three ... and one quarter.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Have you washed your hands in the last hour?</p>
<p><strong>Dennis Fram</strong>: Yeah. Why?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Changed your shirt?</p>
<p><strong>Dennis Fram</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'd like to do a test on your shirt if I may.</p>

							<p>FLASH IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(It's raining. Thunder rumbles, lightning flashes.) </p>
<p>[EXT. DESERT STATE MENTAL HOSPITAL - OUTER FENCE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Camera slowly pans downward and we note the prison-like barbed-wire fence surrounding the hospital. The echoes of thunder rumble through the night.) </p>
<p>[EXT. DESERT STATE MENTAL HOSPITAL -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Nurse Nanette Faber holds her umbrella as she hurries up the front walk toward the hospital. We see the shadow of a person standing near the second floor middle window just above the front door.) </p>
<p>[INT. DESERT STATE MENTAL HOSPITAL -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Through the closed front door glass we see Nurse Nanette Faber closer her umbrella as she walks up the front steps. Thunder rumbles in the background.) </p>
<p>(The front doors open and she walks inside.) </p>
<p>(She stops at the security desk and smiles at the Len, the security guard.) </p>
<p><strong>Nanette Faber</strong>: Hey, Len.</p>
<p>(He puts her ID badge and a LC-110 A-H safety alert alarm on the counter. She takes them and smiles at Len.) </p>
<p><strong>Nanette Faber</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>(She rounds the corner and stops at the metal checkpoint where two more security guards wait behind a table. She puts her bag and things in the plastic tray.)</p>
<p><strong>Security Guard</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>Nanette Faber</strong>: (mumbles something)</p>
<p>(She signs in on the clipboard, then walks through the metal detector. The machine beeps.)</p>
<p>(On the other side, she gets her ID and alarm from the security guard.)</p>
<p><strong>Nanette Faber</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>[CU: CARD SWIPE]</p>
<p>(Nanette Faber swipes her card into the wall security lock and punches in her access code, 5-2. The light switches from red to green and the door buzzes.)</p>
<p>(She opens the door and walks inside.)</p>
<p>[INT. DESERT STATE MENTAL HOSPITAL - UNIT 2C -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(She walks up to the panel and presses the button on top, releasing her keys. She removes the keys and walks over to the grated metal door nearby.) </p>
<p>(She uses the key, unlocks the door and slips inside.) </p>
<p>(The door shuts behind her.) </p>
<p>[INT. DESERT STATE MENTAL HOSPITAL - UNIT 2C -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Nanette Faber reaches the nurse's station. She uses the key, unlocks the door and slips inside. She takes off her jacket. The door closes behind her. Thunder rumbles in the distance.) </p>
<p>(Nurse Joanne McKay is already there. She doesn't look up as she writes in her clipboard.) </p>
<p><strong>Joanne McKay</strong>: Some night, huh?</p>
<p>(Nanette Faber reaches for the clipboard.) </p>
<p><strong>Nanette Faber</strong>: It's ugly out there.</p>
<p>(She heads out to do her nightly shift bed checks.) </p>
<p>[INT. DESERT STATE MENTAL HOSPITAL - UNIT 2C -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Nanette Faber walks over to the door to Unit 2C. She opens the door and enters the unit.)</p>
<p>(She walks up to the first door and uses the flashlight to peer into the door window to check that Earl Simmonds is in the room. He is there sitting on a chair near the door. In the darkness, Earl Simmonds stares back at her. She turns the flashlight off and he looks away. Thunder rumbles in the background.)</p>
<p>(She jots down notes on the clipboard as she heads to the next room.)</p>
<p>(Again, she uses the flashlight and peers into the room. Charles Pellew is sleeping on the bed. She heads to the next room.) </p>
<p>(She looks inside and sees Adam Trent sleeping. She turns, writes on her clipboard as she heads for the next room.) </p>
<p>(She peers in through the door window and finds the bed empty. She looks on the floor and sees Robbie Garson on the floor, his head bloody.) </p>
<p>(Nanette Faber opens the door and rushes inside to check. She sees the blood spatter on the floor near Robbie Garson's head.) </p>
<p>(She hears a sound behind her, turns and finds another inmate, Kenny Valdez, crouching on the floor near the wall, his hands and mouth bloody.) </p>
<p>(She takes a step back and pulls the security alarm. Immediately, it starts beeping. The lights in the unit flash as Nanette Faber keeps her flashlight on the inmate in front of her.) </p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
[INT. DESERT STATE MENTAL HOSPITAL - UNIT 2C - HALLWAY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(The hospital administrator leads Brass, Grissom and Sara out toward the grated door to the unit.) </p>
<p><strong>Hospital Administrator</strong>: We have two types of patients here: The criminally insane and sexually violent predators, all with multiple convictions.</p>
<p>(He inserts the key into the door.) </p>
<p><strong>Hospital Administrator</strong>: We get all the inmates the prisons can't handle.</p>
<p>(He turns around and looks at Brass, Grissom and Sara.) </p>
<p><strong>Hospital Administrator</strong>: Keep your kits closed and locked when not in use. Um, Ms. Sidle, best if you remove the vest. New uniforms upset them.</p>
<p>(He opens the grated door as Sara puts her kit down on the ground to remove her vest.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. DESERT STATE MENTAL HOSPITAL - UNIT 2C -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(He opens the door to the unit and they walk in. The guard outside closes the door.) </p>
<p>(They head toward the nurse's station.) </p>
<p><strong>Hospital Administrator</strong>: We're mostly concerned with maintaining psychiatric remission. We want to stabilize symptoms and reduce an individual's risk of violence to himself and to others.</p>
<p>(He stops. In front of him is a line of inmates being led through the hallway. They're headed in their direction. The hospital administrator immediately instructs his visitors.) </p>
<p><strong>Hospital Administrator</strong>: Oh, uh, could you actually stop here and put your backs against the wall, please. (to Brass) It's, uh, standard safety procedure. </p>
<p>(Brass, Grissom and Sara have their backs to the wall as the inmates walk by.) </p>
<p>(One of the inmates, Jake, looks directly at Sara, smiles wildly at her, opens his mouth and sticks his tongue out, wiggling it obscenely at her.) </p>
<p><strong>Leon Madera</strong>: Put your tongue in your mouth, Jake.</p>
<p>(As he follows the others, Jake turns and keeps his eyes on Sara, a wild grin on his face. He disappears into the room.) </p>
<p><strong>Hospital Administrator</strong>: We're moving them all to the day room.</p>
<p>(Off screen, we hear a door buzz and unlatch open.) </p>
<p>(The hospital administrator leads Brass, Grissom and Sara down the hallway.) </p>
<p>[INT. DESERT STATE MENTAL HOSPITAL - UNIT 2C -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Through the closed door window, we see the hospital administrator leading the others to the hallway outside the crime scene.) </p>
<p><strong>Nanette Faber</strong>: (o.s.) This is not good. The hospital doesn't need this.</p>
<p>(The door opens and they walk inside.) </p>
<p>(Nurse Nanette Faber, Nurse Joanne McKay and Lieutenant Reed Owens wait out in the hallway for them.) </p>
<p><strong>Hospital Administrator</strong>: This is Captain Brass. Dr. Grissom and Ms. Sidle are from the Crime Lab.</p>
<p><strong>Reed Owens</strong>: Lt. Reed Owens, Desert State Hospital Police.</p>
<p><strong>Hospital Administrator</strong>: We have our own internal police team and Lieutenant Owens was the first officer on the scene after the call came in.</p>
<p><strong>Reed Owens</strong>: The victim was found by Nurse Faber at approximately 12:10 A.M.</p>
<p><strong>Nanette Faber</strong>: Joanne was coming off shift, I was coming on. Doing bed checks, I found Robbie on the floor. Kenny was in the corner covered in blood.</p>
<p>(Grissom breaks away from the group and heads for the room.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Are the patients locked in their rooms at night?</p>
<p><strong>Hospital Administrator</strong>: No. The doors are left unlocked.</p>
<p>(Grissom shines his flashlight into the room.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So they're free to roam around?</p>
<p><strong>Hospital Administrator</strong>: Locked rooms usually lead to patients trying to harm themselves.</p>
<p>(He notes the blood on the walls.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Where's Kenny now?</p>
<p><strong>Nanette Faber</strong>: He's been taken to seclusion.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[SECLUSION]</p>
<p>(Kenny Valdez is strapped to the bed as he screams. Leon tightens the strap around his chest.)</p>
<p>(The door opens and Nurse Faber enters the room. She checks his chart. Behind her, Grissom, Sara and Brass also step into the room.) </p>
<p><strong>Leon Madera</strong>: Shh-shh-shh.</p>
<p><strong>Nanette Faber</strong>: Leon, let's get a couple more milligrams of lorazepam into him.</p>
<p>(Sara notes the gashes in Kenny's left arm.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: How did he get those wounds?</p>
<p><strong>Leon Madera</strong>: Oh, Kenny's a self-mutilator. He suffers from Renfield's syndrome; gets off on blood.</p>
<p>(Nurse Faber holds Kenny's head still.) </p>
<p><strong>Nanette Faber</strong>: Shh ... </p>
<p><strong>Leon Madera</strong>: Couple of weeks ago I caught him gouging himself with a carpet staple.</p>
<p>(As he talks, Leon injects Kenny.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He was wearing these clothes when you found him?</p>
<p><strong>Nanette Faber</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p>(As if knowing what he's thinking, Sara turns to look at Grissom. He motions with his head for them to step outside. He and Sara leave the room.) </p>
<p>[INT. DESERT STATE MENTAL HOSPITAL - UNIT 2C - HALLWAY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Grissom and Sara talk out in the hallway.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: There was blood spatter all over the victim's room.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Blood but no spatter on Kenny's clothes.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm not sure this is our guy.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (looks around) Locked unit. Finite number of suspects.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Crazy or not ... here we come.</p>
<p>FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS </p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[INT. DESERT STATE MENTAL HOSPITAL - UNIT 2C -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(One of the inmates stands at the window watching the rain outside. Thunder rumbles in the distance.) </p>
<p>(Inside at the table, Jake and an inmate play cards with Charles Pellew. It appears that they're using cigarettes as chips. Jake drops a cigarette into the pot.)</p>
<p>(The inmate has all red cards -- a King of Diamonds, Queen of Hearts and Jack of Diamonds. Jake glances over at Earl as they play.) </p>
<p>(Across the table from them is Charles Pellew. The television set behind him shows a polar bear and her cub.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(Earl Simmonds threads an imaginary string through an imaginary needle. He licks the imaginary string and tries to get it through the imaginary needle.) </p>
<p>(Outside in door, Brass and Grissom watch.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Who's this guy knitting an imaginary sweater? How's he know when it's finished?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: His brain tells him that what he's doing is real. He has no reason to doubt it. </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Or any desire to.</p>
<p>(Other inmates in the room include Robert Salter, who sits on the couch staring out in front of him, and Adam Trent, sitting on another couch reading a book while biting his nails.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: They asked John Nash how he could believe that extraterrestrials were sending him messages. He said that the messages came to him in the same way that his mathematical ideas did. So he had to take them seriously.</p>
<p>(Behind them, Valerie Dino walks up to them.) </p>
<p><strong>Valerie Dino</strong>: Hey. Valerie Dino. I'm the on-call doctor.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did you pronounce?</p>
<p><strong>Valerie Dino</strong>: Yeah. The administration asked me to set up some rooms for your interviews, but, uh, personally, I don't see what you hope to accomplish. These patients are criminals with severe mental disorders. They're not going to give you a straight answer.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (smiles) No one ever does.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. DESERT STATE MENTAL HOSPITAL - UNIT 2C - HALLWAY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(The door opens and the gurney with Robbie Garson's body on it is wheeled out of the hallway.) </p>
<p>(Sara lingers out in the doorway looking into Robbie Garson's room. She's holding a camera in her hand and looking at the room assignments.)</p>
<p>DESERT STATE MENTAL HOSPITAL<br />
UNIT 2C ROOM B</p>
<p>NAME: ROBBIE GARSON<br />

<p>(She raises her camera and takes a photo of the sign.) </p>
<p>[INT. UNIT 2C -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Sara steps into the room. Thunder rumbles outside, lightning flashes.) </p>
<p>(She looks down at the blood on the floor with the finger marks in the middle of it.)</p>
<p>(She snaps a photo of the blood on the edge of the bed sheets and photos of the blood on the floor.) </p>
<p>(She crouches down and snaps more photos of the blood near the dresser.)</p>
<p>(She stands up and opens the dresser drawer.) </p>
<p>(She snaps a couple of photos of its contents. Thunder rumbles outside. Sara looks up and around the room, something on the walls near the bed catches her eyes.) </p>
<p>(On the wall are a couple of photos. The topmost is of two men sitting in chairs and is held up by blue tape. The bottom one is of a faded man. Next to the top photo is a space, but there's remnants of some blue tape still on the wall.) </p>
<p>(Sara walks over to the wall and snaps a couple of photos of it.) </p>
<p>(At first, she tries to scrape off the blue substance on the wall, but realizes that it's tape and peels it off with her fingertip. She places it in a bindle.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. DESERT STATE MENTAL HOSPITAL - UNIT 2C - INTERVIEW ROOM 1 -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Grissom interviews Ronald Salter. Ronald picks at the hair near his right ear. He doesn't look at Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Ronald Salter</strong>: I definitely heard something. He said, &quot;I'll get in!&quot; No, no, it was, &quot;I'm coming in.&quot; I heard him say it. And it's not like he isn't serious.</p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH QUICK FLASHES OF THE INMATE'S RECORD</p>

<p>(Grissom looks at Ronald Salter.) </p>

<p><strong>Ronald Salter</strong>: The, uh, perpetrator.</p>
<p>[QUICK FLASH: RECORD]</p>
<p>HALLUCINATIONS, DELUSION</p>
<p>(Grissom looks at Ronald Salter.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Can you tell me anything else about him?</p>
<p><strong>Ronald Salter</strong>: Oh, no, I couldn't.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>Ronald Salter</strong>: (whispers) He's here.</p>
<p>(Grissom's eyes shift around the room. Finding nothing, he looks at Ronald.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: In this room? </p>
<p>(Ronald taps the side of his right temple.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Is his name Ronald?</p>
<p><strong>Ronald Salter</strong>: No. My name is Ronald.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What's his name?</p>
<p><strong>Ronald Salter</strong>: He doesn't have a name. He's a cricket.</p>
<p>(Again, Ronald taps the side of his right temple.) </p>
<p><strong>Ronald Salter</strong>: Here.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: A cricket?</p>
<p><strong>Ronald Salter</strong>: Yes. Trying to burrow a hole in my head. </p>

<p>(Brass has his pen poised on the paper in front of him as he interviews Earl Simmonds.) </p>
<p><strong>Earl Simmonds</strong>: I don't sleep.</p>
<p>(Brass looks at him.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Never? </p>
<p>(Earl shakes his head.) </p>
<p>(Earl's hands move as if he were knitting.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So what do you do at night?</p>
<p><strong>Earl Simmonds</strong>: Day, night, it don't make no difference. I think.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: About what?</p>
<p><strong>Earl Simmonds</strong>: Bitches.</p>

<p>[INT. DESERT STATE MENTAL HOSPITAL - UNIT 2C - ROOM B -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(She moves the sheets aside and finds something.)</p>
<p>(She checks the pillows and the rest of the bed.) </p>
<p>(She lifts up the mattress and finds some magazine photos on the wire frame. She sits down and removes her goggles. The magazine pages are from a clothes catalog - photos of teenaged boys.)</p>

<p>[ADAM TRENT]</p>
<p><strong>Adam Trent</strong>: What are you going to do? Are you going to convict me of murder and put me in a bad place?</p>
<p>(Adam smirks and starts biting his nails.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Is it you?</p>
<p><strong>Adam Trent</strong>: Check the files, sir. I'm a rapist, not a murderer.</p>
<p>[INMATE]</p>
<p>(Brass looks across the table at an elderly inmate.) </p>
<p>[INT. DESERT STATE MENTAL HOSPITAL - UNIT 2C - ROOM B -- NIGHT] </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Robert Garson?</p>
<p>(The inmate stares back at him without saying anything.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hmm?</p>
<p>(Brass looks at the inmate trying to find a response. There is none.)</p>

<p>(Sara removes a hair brush from the vent and looks at it carefully as she sets it on the drawers.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's not just his subconscious. This guy's got stuff buried everywhere.</p>

<p>[INT. DESERT STATE MENTAL HOSPITAL - DR. DINO'S OFFICE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Grissom and Sara sit in Valerie Dino's office. She reads from the letters they've found.) </p>
<p><strong>Valerie Dino</strong>: &quot;Dearest Angel, I think of you wherever I go. You are my prince. I miss you. Write to me. Your only love, Mother.&quot; (She sets it aside and picks up another letter.) Another one. Uh ... &quot;It rained today. I thought of that time when you and I got caught in the storm at the lake. The fire ... I came home and made your favorite dinner. I even set a place for you ... &quot; so on and so forth.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: That does not sound maternal to me.</p>
<p><strong>Valerie Dino</strong>: (shakes her head) It's not.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Incest?</p>
<p><strong>Valerie Dino</strong>: Fully consummated. Mother-son incest is rare and deeply pathological. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Oedipal complex taken too far?</p>
<p><strong>Valerie Dino</strong>: Oedipus ... implies son to mother. In this case, the mother was seeking the love and creating the codependence. We call this a Jocasta Complex.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Oedipus' mother.</p>
<p><strong>Valerie Dino</strong>: When Adam was nine his father died. His mother replaced her dead husband with her son.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: That's got to mess you up.</p>
<p><strong>Valerie Dino</strong>: Yeah. Adam is schizo-affective, suicidal, and a pathological narcissist. When he was a teenager he was unable to retaliate against his mother and incapable of actual intimacy, so ... he started raping women.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Always women?</p>
<p><strong>Valerie Dino</strong>: Yes. Which is why I don't think he killed Robbie.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We found Adam's semen in Robbie's bed.</p>
<p><strong>Valerie Dino</strong>: You see, that surprises me. Like any good psychopath, he rarely veers from his pattern. Adam is a single-celled organism who exists wholly for himself. He must've been getting something tangible in return.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What? Drugs? Cigarettes?</p>
<p><strong>Valerie Dino</strong>: Drugs aren't his issue. And as far as I know he doesn't smoke. Um ... </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So, uh, what can we learn from his artwork?</p>
<p>(She looks at the drawings.) </p>
<p><strong>Valerie Dino</strong>: Uh ... he starts with an innocuous object: a tree, a cat, an oboe -- all of which he morphs into something deadly. You can see ... all of them.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So, what should be safe turns into something unsafe.</p>
<p><strong>Valerie Dino</strong>: Mother becomes lover.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What about the mother? Do you have any idea where she is?</p>
<p><strong>Valerie Dino</strong>: She lives near Reno.</p>
<p>(She shakes her head.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Based on the postmarks, it seems like she stopped writing him.</p>
<p><strong>Valerie Dino</strong>: Every time a letter came, a manic episode followed, then a severe depression, including one suicide attempt. So I started sending the letters back. Eventually, she stopped writing. </p>

<p>(Adam Trent bites his nails as he's questioned by Sara. Grissom sits on the side, watching. Valerie Dino is also in the room. Thunder rumbles softly in the background.) </p>
<p><strong>Adam Trent</strong>: Did I kill him? Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>Adam Trent</strong>: He was queer.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: But you had s*x with him.</p>
<p>(Adam Trent stops biting his nails and looks at Sara.) </p>
<p>[QUICK FLASH: ADAM'S POV]</p>
<p>(Sara.) </p>
<p>[RESUME VIEW]</p>
<p><strong>Adam Trent</strong>: No. He had s*x with me. He was the punk.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Was it consensual?</p>
<p><strong>Adam Trent</strong>: I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So why did you do it?</p>
<p><strong>Adam Trent</strong>: I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Okay. So then what happened?</p>
<p><strong>Adam Trent</strong>: I took his head and I smashed it into the floor.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [ROBBIE'S ROOM] Adam Trent smashes Robbie's head against the hard floor. Blood spurts on the ground.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: And that's how you killed him?</p>
<p>(He looks at her for a long moment. Suddenly, Sara turns and glances at Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Adam Trent</strong>: (deep breath) What? You don't believe me?</p>
<p>(Sara looks at Adam.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'm just wondering if that's how you killed him.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Trent</strong>: Yes. I'm saying this and this is true. And if you don't believe me, just look in the bucket in the latrine.</p>
<p>(Again, Sara turns and looks at Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Adam Trent</strong>: Okay ... (Sara turns and looks at Adam.) Do you really want to know why I killed him?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p>(Adam looks at Sara.) </p>
<p>[QUICK FLASH: ADAM'S POV]</p>
<p>(He looks at Sara's face, then down to her breasts.) </p>
<p>(He looks at her right hand on the table between them. We note that her index fingernail is painted gold.)</p>
<p>(Cut back to: Sara's face.)</p>
<p>[RESUME VIEW]</p>
<p>(Adam goes back to biting his nails. We notice that his nails are bleeding.) </p>
<p>(He puts his hand aside and stares at Sara.) </p>
<p><strong>Adam Trent</strong>: It's because I'm crazy.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. DESERT STATE MENTAL HOSPITAL - LATRINE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(The security guard opens the door to the latrine. Sara and Grissom enter. Grissom's carrying his kit. They walk inside looking around.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Not a word about suffocation.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, his nails weren't long enough to leave those tears in the pillow. And there would have been traces of blood from his cuticles.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Something is off.</p>
<p>(At the end of the bathroom near the showers are the janitor's bucket and mop. Sara walks into the small walkway and takes out her flashlight. She switches it on and puts on a glove.) </p>
<p>(She kneels down next to the bucket and removes a bundle of clothes. She puts the bundle on the floor and unrolls it. They immediately see the blood on the front of the shirt.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, there's our blood splatter.</p>
<p>(Sara opens up the pants and the boxer shorts. They immediately notice the red stain in the front of the shorts.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What is that on the crotch?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Lipstick.</p>

<p>(One of the inmates stands near the window looking down outside.)</p>
<p>(In the smoke break area, Sara picks up a single cigarette butt with lipstick on the end of it. She puts it in a bindle.) </p>
<p>(Sara turns to Lieutenant Reed Owens standing near her.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Where is Nurse McKay? I need to talk to her.</p>
<p><strong>Reed Owens</strong>: She's on lunch duty.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: All right. I can either take this and the underwear back to the lab and confirm the match, which will only extend our presence here. Or ... you can give me access to the nurse's station right now.</p>

[INT. DESERT STATE MENTAL HOSPITAL - HALLWAY / NURSE'S STATION -- DAY] </p>
<p>[HALLWAY POV]</p>
<p>(Camera slowly creeps around the hallway to reveal that Grissom and Sara are in the nurse's station. The door is wide open.) </p>
<p>[RESUME VIEW]</p>
<p>(Grissom looks at the various file folders. Sara is looking at a photo.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: This must be the photo that Nurse McKay confiscated from Robbie in group. The missing half? I found blue tape in Robbie's room. </p>
<p>(We see it's a photo of a young boy in yellow shorts standing between two other boys, his arms resting on their shoulders. Both faces of the two other boys are cut or torn out.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Kind of looks like Adam.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Where would Robbie get a picture of Adam?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, they were having s*x.</p>
<p>(Grissom tries a drawer and finds it locked. Sara turns over a small heart-shaped paperweight on the desk and finds &quot;J + A&quot; painted in black under it.) </p>
<p>(Grissom tries more drawers and finds them locked.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm going to find someone who can open these drawers.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(Grissom starts removing his gloves as he heads for the door. Sara is still looking at the various items on the counter, her back to the open door.) </p>
<p>[HALLWAY POV]</p>
<p>(Grissom walks out of the nurse's station. The door is wide open as he makes his way down the hallway.) </p>
<p>[RESUME VIEW]</p>
<p>(Sara is in the nurse's station, her back to the open door.)</p>
<p>[GRISSOM]</p>
<p>(Grissom walks down the hallway toward Lieutenant Reed Owens, who is at his post near the main door. Grissom stops in front of him and talks with him.) </p>
<p>[SARA]</p>
<p>(Sara is in the nurse's station studying the different photo of Adam that she's found.)</p>
<p>(Behind her, we see Adam Trent appear in the doorway. He turns and walks quietly into the nurse's station.)</p>
<p>(Sara hasn't noticed him.) </p>
<p>(With his eyes on Sara, Adam starts to close the door.) </p>
<p><strong>Adam Trent</strong>: Hey. </p>
<p>(Sara stops and turns around. She puts the photo down on the counter behind her.) </p>
<p>[GRISSOM]</p>
<p>(Outside in the hallway, Reed Owens is talking with Grissom. He points to the doorway on the right. Grissom turns and exits the hallway, disappearing through the door.) </p>
<p>[SARA] </p>
<p>(Back in the nurse's station, Sara stares at Adam Trent. Adam closes the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Adam Trent</strong>: Are you a spiritual person?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Sometimes.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Trent</strong>: Do you believe that everything happens for a reason? That bad things are there to teach us a karmic lesson?</p>
<p>(We hear Adam move slowly toward Sara. Sara backs away casually, reaching behind her, grabbing a syringe from the counter top.) </p>
<p><strong>Adam Trent</strong>: You know, maybe all our problems can be cured by tuning in to a higher frequency.</p>
<p>(Adam continues to talk with Sara.) </p>
<p><strong>Adam Trent</strong>: There's this one guy I read, he believes that illness, anxiety and fear all occur when people are vibrating at ten thousand cycles a second.</p>
<p>(Sara nods. Adam moves closer toward Sara. Sara moves. She uncaps the syringe and tries to jab it at Adam. Adam grabs Sara, turns her around and holds her in front of him.)</p>
<p>(The syringe falls harmlessly to the floor.) </p>
<p>[HALLWAY POV]</p>
<p>(Through the glass, we see Sara struggle against Adam. They both fall out of view as they sink down to the floor.) </p>
<p>[RESUME VIEW]</p>
<p>(Sara struggles against Adam. She tries to elbow him in the chest, but Adam has a firm hold on her. Adam takes out a pointed piece of hardened clay that he holds against Sara's throat.) </p>
<p><strong>Adam Trent</strong>: If they could just get up to a hundred thousand cycles per second they'd be in the realm of sound, light and spirit, and everything would be just fine. Right?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (nods) Yeah.</p>
<p>[HALLWAY]</p>
<p>(Grissom returns with an orderly. They both head back to the nurse's station.) </p>
<p><strong>Adam Trent</strong>: (o.s.) You know what I think? </p>
<p>[NURSE'S STATION]</p>
<p>(Adam has a firm hold on Sara.) </p>
<p><strong>Adam Trent</strong>: I think I'm just vibrating at the wrong frequency.</p>
<p>(Sara struggles against Adam's hold on her.) </p>
<p>[HALLWAY]</p>
<p><strong>Adam Trent</strong>: (o.s.) Don't --<br />
<strong>Sara</strong>: (o.s.) It's okay.</p>
<p>(Grissom and the orderly return to the nurse's station and find the door locked shut. The orderly jiggles the lock. It doesn't open.)</p>
<p><strong>Adam Trent</strong>: (crying) (o.s.) Do you think I'm smart?</p>
<p>[OFF ADAM AND SARA]</p>
<p>(Alarmed, Grissom steps to the side to look in through the window.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (o.s.) Yeah. ADAM TRENT: (o.s.) Yeah?</p>
<p>(Sara sees Grissom outside.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (nods) Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (o.s.) Oh, dear God.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Trent</strong>: (crying) Do you think I'm right?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (o.s.) Open the door.</p>
<p>(Adam presses the ceramic tip against Sara's throat.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (o.s.) I do.</p>

<p><strong>Adam Trent</strong>: (o.s.) You do?</p>
<p>(The orderly fumbles as he tries different keys.) </p>
<p><strong>Orderly</strong>: I can't. I don't have the right key. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (quietly) Just open it.</p>
<p>(Off screen, we hear keys jingling as the orderly struggles to find the right key.) </p>
<p>[NURSE'S STATION] </p>
<p>(Adam turns and finally notices that Grissom is there looking at Sara. Sara has stopped struggling as she looks back at Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Please open the door.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Trent</strong>: (to Sara and Grissom) Don't you move a muscle. I will grind you, you bitch. You hear me?</p>
<p>(Sara nods, her eyes averted and gazes down at the floor. We hear the alarms beep and lights flash.) </p>
<p><strong>Adam Trent</strong>: Do not look at them!</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Trent</strong>: Keep your eyes on the floor!</p>
<p>(Suddenly, Nurse Joanne McKay runs up to the nurse's station, her hands pressed to the window glass.) </p>
<p><strong>Joanne McKay</strong>: Wait! </p>
<p>(Adam turns and sees Joanne McKay through the window.) </p>
<p><strong>Joanne McKay</strong>: Adam -- </p>
<p>(Suddenly, he goes wild, his attention averted from Sara to Joanne. He points the ceramic piece to her, standing up, releasing his hold on Sara.) </p>
<p><strong>Adam Trent</strong>: You! You, go away! </p>
<p>(Sara turns and sees Nurse McKay. She quickly elbows Adam in the chest, pushing him away and getting to her feet. Adam falls back against the desk.) </p>
<p><strong>Adam Trent</strong>: (wildly) You! You, go away!</p>
<p><strong>Joanne McKay</strong>: (o.s.) No!</p>
<p>(Adam takes the clay piece and uses it to cut his own neck. Blood spurts out from the wound.) </p>
<p><strong>Joanne McKay</strong>: (o.s.) Adam! Stop!</p>
<p>(Sara opens the door and runs outside, ignoring everyone as she hurries past them. She walks quickly to the end of the hallway, getting as far away as she can.) </p>
<p><strong>Joanne McKay</strong>: (o.s.) (shouts) Get a medic in here!</p>
<p>(Grissom watches Sara, then turns back to look inside the nurse's station. The guard and an orderly hold Adam Trent, who struggles against them as he cries.) </p>
<p><strong>Guard</strong>: Hold still. Apply some pressure.</p>
<p>(Joanne McKay rushes into the nurse's station and kneels down to help them, pressing her hands against Adam's wound.)</p>
<p>(Grissom stares at them, then turns to look back at Sara.)</p>
<p>(Sara has reached the end of the hallway where the metal grate covering the window is. It's raining outside.) </p>
<p><strong>Joanne McKay</strong>: (o.s.) Where is it? Where is it?</p>
<p>(Off screen, we hear Adam crying.)</p>
<p>(Sara reaches the window and slams both her hands, palm forward on the metal grate.) </p>
<p>(She rests her forehead against the metal grate.) </p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: When my father died, my mother came to a place like this for a while for evaluation. It looked the same, it smelled the same. It smelled like lies.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You sure you're okay?</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: If you want, I can have somebody take your place.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I appreciate that. I do, I really do, but ... </p>
<p>(Down the hallway near the nurse's station, we see Adam Trent on a gurney with the security guard, orderly and a doctor standing over him. He's in restraints. Nurse Joanne McKay heads for Grissom and Sara.) </p>
<p><strong>Joanne McKay</strong>: I'll be right back.</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(Sara continues.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I kind of made a decision to move beyond that and ... I really want to finish this case.</p>
<p><strong>Joanne McKay</strong>: (interrupts) We have rules for a reason. </p>
<p>(Grissom turns and looks at Nurse McKay.) </p>
<p><strong>Joanne McKay</strong>: You people come in here disrupting things. You're unsafe. This is your fault.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You seem to take your job rather personally.</p>
<p><strong>Joanne McKay</strong>: What are you suggesting?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: That you had an intimate relationship with Adam Trent.</p>
<p><strong>Joanne McKay</strong>: (scoffs) That's ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Your lipstick is on his underwear.</p>
<p><strong>Joanne McKay</strong>: I gave Robbie my lipstick sometimes. Maybe he was wearing it when the whole thing ...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (interrupts) We didn't find any on his lips.</p>
<p><strong>Joanne McKay</strong>: Well, that's your problem. </p>

<p>(He walks up to the table nearest him in the center of the room with various un-fired and un-painted pottery pieces on it.) </p>
<p>(He notices a particular piece on the second table. It's a one-handled damaged vase.) </p>
<p>(He takes the piece in his hand and matches it to the vase as one of the missing handles.)</p>
<p>(Grissom turns and talks to the therapist sitting at his desk in the corner.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Excuse me. (The therapist looks up.) Adam Trent was working on this piece?</p>
<p><strong>Therapist</strong>: Yes. He made it on Monday. (The therapist stands up and heads over to Grissom.) But he never got a chance to fire it. Nurse McKay came in; they had a conversation. Actually, it was more of an argument, very heated, very loud. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [ART ROOM - DAY] Adam Trent is on the pottery wheel making his vase.)</p>
<p>(Nurse McKay walks up to him and kneels down next to him. She starts talking to him as Adam works on the piece.)</p>

<p><strong>Therapist</strong>: And then she yanked him out of class.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Was this on the wheel while they were arguing?</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: In the '60s, experiments were done on clay pots and painted canvas. Scientists were able to ferret out sounds that were captured during the creative process in the clay and the paint.</p>
<p>(They step into the A/V Lab. Sofia Curtis is there with the pottery piece on a turntable.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Trippy.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: It's actually not that out there. (As she talks, she flips the turntable on.) In the old days, the first gramophone recordings were made by taking the vibrations of sound and cutting them into wax cylinders while they were turning. </p>
<p>(Quick flash to: A woman plays the cello sitting next to an old fashioned gramophone.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: (V.O.) Based on the frequency and intensity of the sound, the stylus cut into the wax, creating distinct variances of depth and width.</p>

<p>(End of flashback. Resume to pottery.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: For playback, a mechanical transducer vibrated along a groove, generating a current which, when amplified, turned into sound.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: When the art therapist told me that there'd been an argument while Adam was on the wheel, I thought, well, maybe we can pull some sound off his pot.</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Okay. Joanne McKay, registered nurse, licensed by the Nevada board of Nursing 1978. Married Howard Trent 1980. The board requires you to get a new certificate when you get married. I guess you never complied.</p>
<p><strong>Joanne McKay</strong>: I've always gone by my maiden name.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I guess that makes it less embarrassing to check into the motel with your son. (She glares at him.) Oh, I'm sorry. You checked into a psycho ward instead.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: For what? To destroy his ego? To fill him with guilt? To make him hate himself so much he would take his own life just to be free of you?</p>
<p><strong>Joanne McKay</strong>: You have no idea what goes on between us.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Let's cut the umbilical cord, okay? Six months ago your letters started to come back. No more communication with Little Lord Fauntleroy. So you apply to Desert State. They were desperate for nursing staff, so you got a job.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [DAY ROOM - DAY] Valerie Dino introduces Joanne McKay to the inmates.) </p>
<p><strong>Valerie Dino</strong>: Gentlemen, this is our new nurse, Nurse McKay.</p>
<p><strong>Joanne McKay</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p>(Joanne turns and looks directly at Adam Trent. Adam looks away and starts biting his nails.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Bet it's tough to turn a folie a deux into a menage a trois. N'est-ce pas?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [ADAM'S ROOM - NIGHT] Adam brushes Joanne McKay's hair. He kisses her.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Even tougher that your son was cheating on you ... with a man no less.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [COURTYARD - DAY] Joanne watches as Adam meets with Robbie.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[ART ROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(Joanne talks with Adam.) </p>
<p><strong>Joanne McKay</strong>: You need to stop this.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Trent</strong>: Stop what?</p>
<p><strong>Joanne McKay</strong>: End it with Robbie.</p>
<p><strong>Adam Trent</strong>: Don't tell me what to do.</p>
<p><strong>Joanne McKay</strong>: End it or I will.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: But he didn't end it, did he? Robbie was lover's leverage. He was that thing that Adam kept in his back pocket and pulled out whenever he needed to distance himself from you.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So you had no choice but to get rid of Robbie. And being a good nurse, you knew his trigger.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [ROBBIE'S ROOM - DAY] Joanne takes the photo of Adam off Robbie's wall and gives it to Robbie.) </p>
<p><strong>Joanne McKay</strong>: I want you to talk about this in group today.</p>
<p><strong>Robbie Garson</strong>: B-but I thought that we ...</p>
<p><strong>Joanne McKay</strong>: It's okay. You can bring it.</p>
<p>(Joanne walks out.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[GROUP SESSION]</p>
<p>(Robbie looks at the photo in group.) </p>
<p><strong>Joanne McKay</strong>: Hey! Robbie. What do you got there? JOANNE MCKAY: There's no personal items in group.</p>
<p><strong>Robbie Garson</strong>: (stutters) B-but y-you ... you told me ... th-th-that I could bring this.</p>
<p><strong>Joanne McKay</strong>: I didn't say anything. (Joanne stands up.) Give me that. What is that, a picture?</p>
<p>(She tries to take the photo from him. Robbie hides the photo from her.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbie Garson</strong>: You remember?</p>
<p><strong>Joanne McKay</strong>: Give me the picture.</p>
<p><strong>Robbie Garson</strong>: No, do you remember? You remember? (shouts) No!</p>
<p><strong>Joanne McKay</strong>: Give me the picture.</p>
<p>(Robbie stands up and starts to struggle with Joanne McKay for the photo.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbie Garson</strong>: No, you don't tell me! You told me...!</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[SECLUSION] </p>
<p>(Robbie is being restrained on the bed.) </p>
<p><strong>Joanne McKay</strong>: Hang on! </p>
<p>(They struggle to restrain Robbie as he screams.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[ROBBIE'S ROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Joanne McKay is in Robbie's room. She takes his pillow and smothers Robbie Garson. He struggles against her, but she keeps the pillow firmly on his head.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You manipulated the situation and took advantage of his weakness.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Exactly what you have been doing to Adam for the past twenty years. And being such a good mother, you made him cover it up. (beat) Again.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [ROBBIE'S ROOM - NIGHT] Adam removes Robbie's body from the bed and places it on the floor. He smashes Robbie's head against the floor until a pool of blood gathers under his head.) </p>
<p>(Blood spatters on Adam's clothes.) </p>
<p>LATER:</p>
<p>(The door opens and Kenny walks in. He glances around, sees the blood on the floor and can't help himself. He rubs his hands in the pool of blood, smashing it against his mouth trying to drink it all in.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Joanne McKay</strong>: Why would my son do that?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Because he loves you as much as he hates you.</p>
<p><strong>Joanne McKay</strong>: You can't prove any of this.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Just the incest, which is a Class B felony. It carries a penalty of up to ten years.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: That's ten years away from Adam.</p>
<p><strong>Joanne McKay</strong>: Good luck getting him to testify.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (sighs) Well. Okay.</p>
<p>(Sara gathers her things and heads out of the room.)</p>
<p>(The officer in the room steps forward.) </p>
<p>[OBSERVATION ROOM -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(Through the reflection in the glass, we see Grissom is in the observation room watching. Sara leaves the room.) </p>
<p>(The officer reaches for Joanne McKay.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (o.s.) Joanne McKay, you're under arrest for the crime of incest ...</p>
<p>(Grissom turns and looks at Sara, who is standing next to him.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (o.s.) ... your rights. You have the right to ... </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, jail or no jail, ... (The officer has Joanne McKay handcuffed and standing as she listens to her rights.) -- I don't think she'll last six months. She'll die without her son.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: That would be better for both of them.</p>
<p>(Grissom turns and looks at Sara.) </p>
<p>(He nods, then quietly leaves the room. He closes the door behind him.)</p>
<p>(Camera lingers on Sara.) </p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>
<p><strong>End</strong></p>

Finlay: Jared Briscoe, the Gig Harbor Killer.
Murdered seven women.
Turner: A man's been wrongfully imprisoned.
Shaw: Who knew that psychopath Briscoe had a twin?
Russell: Do you think the brothers were working together?
My brother Jared is going to have a new day in court.
We're investigating the disappearance of my partner, Keri Torres.
Russell: Maya. When I was little, you always made me feel so safe.
Ryan: D.B., if you're not willing to put Maya into play in some kind of a way...
The greater good.
Keri's gonna make it.
Nurse: Sir, you can't be here.
You've been a bad boy.
Get in.

Hello, Maya.
It's been a long time-- remember me?
Please, don't.
Shh.
My brother once taught me-- a long time ago-- he said,
“If you love someone... set them free.”
Aah!
I could never hurt you.
I love you.
Aren't you gonna run, hmm? 

Come on. Yeah, like that.
Oh!

You're so beautiful like this.
I can do this all night.
Oh!
No, no, no, no, you don't want to do that.


Maya: Look, Dad, I don't want to argue with you about this.
I just want to go home. Back to Seattle.
Hey, come on, we've talked about this before, honey.
With everything that's going on--
Gig Harbor all over again.
Look, you said yourself you don't feel safe.
Well, it's easier for me to keep you safe here.
I know what I said, but that's because I was alone and scared.
But Ryan's getting back from London, and Katie's coming home from his folks' ranch.
Dad, I appreciate everything you've done.
Officer: Control, One-David-42, all clear.
Control: Roger that, David-42.
I know you just want to protect me, but...
I've got to get back to my life.
All right, I'm sorry, you're right, you're right.
It's what fathers do: We worry, right?
And I love you for it.
I booked a flight.
Tonight. I have a taxi picking me up.
No, no, I'll drive you there myself.
But you said you have that meeting with the sheriff.
Dad, it's fine.
All right, okay, but no-no... no taxis.
I'll, um... I'll have Detective Crawford pick you up.
No arguments. You hear me?
I hear you.
I love you, Dad.
I love you, too.
Maya: I'll call you from Seattle.
Russell: No, no, no, hey-- you will call me when you get to the airport here, and then you will call me from Seattle.
Maya: Okay, now you need to stop being a worrywart.
Russell: Not gonna happen.
Maya: Bye.
Russell: Bye.
It's happening tonight.

Thank you. Yeah.
You look good, Jared. Today's the big day.
I don't understand... any of this.
The judge reviewed the evidence.
Nothing ties you forensically to the murders.
He's thrown out your confession. You're gonna be a free man.
You're not listening to me.
Why am I here?
Jared, you listen to me.
This was not the plan.
You said, if I make a sacrifice, in return, I would live forever.
Ah, yeah.
Plans change.
Why?
I need you.
You need me.
Don't you miss what we had?
Of course I do.
So I say we can have it again.
And this time, I promise you, it'll be so much better.
And why should I trust you?
How can you say that? Look at me. Look in my eyes.
My eyes are your eyes.
My heart is your heart.
When is it happening?
If all goes according to plan, you'll be a free man in a few hours.
And we'll celebrate.
In Vegas.
I'll even have a little gift for you.
Something you've been dreaming about for a very long time.
I stand before you today a man fulfilled.
A man whose prayers have been answered.
Because today, after four long years of incarceration, my brother Jared Briscoe is a free man.
But Jared will not truly be free until those who have wrongfully imprisoned him are brought to account, and I will not rest until I've made them pay.


I don't believe this.
I heard Winthrop's gonna sue Seattle PD.
I'm waiting to be served myself, any day.
D.B., we cannot let this stand.
What are we gonna do? We're dead in the water here.
Keri Torres may be out of the hospital; she can't remember a thing about who kidnapped her.
Hodges is working on something.
That's news to me.
Well, you know how he is.
What does he have?
All he would tell me is that the strings from the crime scenes are starting to sing to him.
That's very helpful.
Russell.
Yeah?
We're all set. I'll pick up Maya at 7:00, take her to the airport.
Thank you.
Maya's leaving?
Yeah, she's, uh, she's going back home. Up to Seattle.
Crawford: For what it's worth, it was a good idea.
Yeah, I got to say I'm surprised that Winthrop didn't try to make a move, though.
I thought that Maya was down here visiting.
She was.
Wait a minute.
You took Avery Ryan's advice?
Does Maya know that she was down here as bait?
Crawford: In case you wanted to know, we had her under surveillance 24-7.
I'd hardly call that bait.
Really?
And what would you call it?
The greater good.

You cannot be serious.
Never had one lesson.
Shocking.
And this stuff isn't too pleasant, either.
Hodges: And yet it makes such beautiful music.
You're replicating the process that the killer used to make the strings for the crime scene.
The process, yes. The material, no.
Oh, well, so good to know you're not using real human tissue.
Although I haven't seen Henry around lately.

Very funny.
You are looking at catgut.
Interesting fact one: Catgut is used not just to produce strings for instruments, but also strings for tennis rackets as well as sutures.
Interesting fact two: Catgut isn't cat gut. It's usually sheep or goat...
Interesting fact three is the part where this has something to do with anything.
String manufacture like this is extremely hard to do.
At least at the level of competence shown by our killer.
Meaning what?
Meaning either our killer was an expert, which doesn't fit Paul Winthrop's résumé, or our killer recruited an expert and forced that person to do his stringing.
Evidence suggests the latter.
It suggests more than that.
Did the research.
There are half a dozen experts in the art of string craft west of the Mississippi.
One of them is in Vegas.
That face look familiar to you?
That's the woman that the killer held at The Mizu.
The one that Finlay shot.
Aah! Aah! Di...
She was never I.D.'d. No one ever reported her missing.
Huh. And now, thanks to this, we have her address.
Mm-hmm.
You want to go along?
Get a little fresh air?
For you? Yes.
The lock is busted.
Somebody broke in.
Oh, oh, boy.
You promised me fresh air.
Is that, uh...
Yeah, it's exactly what you think it is.
All right, wait here, all right?
Whoa, whoa, hey, d-don't you need backup?
Don't you need a gun?
Seriously, just stay here while I clear the place.
Copy that.

Whew.
The house is clear!
Got a body, though.
Woman.
She's been here for a while.

Someone enjoys reading about himself.
Looks like our killer has been camping out in Rebecca Lowell's house.
Hodges: Bad deal for her.
Enslaved to make his strings, then he squats in her digs.
Any idea who the dead woman was?
No, but hopefully we'll get an I.D.
You know, this place seems a little down-rent for a guy like Paul Winthrop to squat in.
Hodges: We have assumed that he's been working with a partner since he's been in Vegas, right?
Yeah.
So... maybe it's more his style.
Ants.
I hate ants.

How do you feel about body parts?

Man: All units. All units. We have a 444. Shots fired.
Officer needs assistance. Corner of Highland and Branch.
Code 3. Control, this is One-David-42.
Currently two blocks from that location.
We are responding but will require backup at 923 Altos Drive.


Hi there. You requested a ride to the airport?
I-I thought Detective Crawford was gonna take me.
Yeah, he got called away. I'm Detective Shaw.
I promise I'm just as safe a driver.
Don't I know you?
Yeah. I used to work in Seattle with your dad.
He just thought a familiar face might make you feel a little more comfortable.
You're here a little early.
Yeah, I know. I probably should have called, but there's a pileup on the I-15.
Oh. Well, okay.
Um, better safe than sorry.
Can I get your bag?
Mm-hmm.
Hey. Got your text.
You have something on the bodies Morgan and Hodges found?
Not all of them.
This poor woman remains unidentified.
But according to DNA, these body parts came from Emily Bartson and Pamela Kramer. Two missing girls here in Vegas.
Phillips: After all these weeks, we found 'em.
That's not all we found.
Finn, you're gonna want to see this.
We recovered partial prints from Rebecca Lowell's house. In the kitchen, in the living room, in the bedroom. Everywhere.
The prints came back to Daniel Shaw.
He's been there.
Staying there.
Shaw is Winthrop's partner.
So, you worked with my dad in Seattle?
That's right.
Then you must know Julie Finlay, too.
Yeah, I do.
How long you been in Vegas?
Not long.
My dad drag you down here, like Finn?
Yeah. Yeah, I guess you might say that.
It's funny. My dad talks about Finn all the time.
He's never mentioned you.
I guess we're just not as close.
I think, uh, you missed the turn.
Airport's back that way.
I'm going another way.
You're not taking me to the airport, are you?
No.
I don't know, Conrad. The situation's fluid right now.
Yeah. My house is a crime scene.
They're processing it right now.
And as for Maya, I have every available unit on.
I know. I know. Thank you.
I hope so, too.
D.B., I heard about Maya. What happened?
Surveillance team was pulled off by a false 444 call.
Somebody slipped in before Crawford could get there.
We found Shaw's fingerprints at the house with the bodies.
Yeah, well, I'm not surprised.
What do you mean?
Keep walking with me for a minute.
Man: This is One-David-30. Crossing Bartlet. Proceeding northbound.
Man 2: One-David-One. Crossing Temple.
We still got a visual on the suspect vehicle?
Copy that, One-David-Ten.
All units, be advised, suspect vehicle is continuing north on Everly Boulevard.
Maya: Where are you taking me?
Shaw: It's probably best if we don't talk.
Maya: We have to talk.
Shaw: No, we don't.
I can't believe you let this happen.
Like I said, we had surveillance 24-7.
For the greater good?
Maya agreed to wear the wire.
She wants to put these guys away.
For all of those women.
And for herself, too.
She wants to end the nightmares.
Well, you're playing a very dangerous game.
It's not a game at all.
We know Winthrop's M.O.
Shaw is not going to hurt Maya.
Not at least until he delivers her to Winthrop.
And we'll have eyes on the whole time.
Winthrop shows up, we take 'em out.
Who else knows about this?
Present company, Ecklie, and Nick and Greg are in the follow car.
Crawford: Along with eight support units.
Operation like this, the fewer people that know about it, the better.
Stokes: Charlie-04-Stokes. We've got eyes on and are hanging back.
Crawford: What are you guys seeing out there, Nick?
Stokes: Not much.
Looks like this guy's just out for a Sunday drive.
I don't think we've been made. He hasn't tried to shake us.
Let me talk to you for a sec.
Look, you don't agree with what I'm doing.
That goes without saying.
Something is really bothering me.
Tell me. I want to know.
I know what the evidence says, and I know what this looks like, but something is not adding up.
I need to see the evidence in Rebecca Lowell's house for myself.

Hey.
Hey, David.
You get an I.D. on the woman I found in the bed?
No name. Not yet.
But DNA came back. The dead woman was Rebecca Lowell's sister.
What was her C.O.D.?
A broken hyoid bone.
Suggests asphyxiation due to manual strangulation.
That's inconsistent with our killer's M.O.
So far, in Gig Harbor and Vegas, the women were beaten and stabbed.
Looks like you got a whole larvae farm there.
I know. And it's weird.
I found two distinct sets of first instar larvae.
The white are blowflies, and the brown are beetles.
The beetle and the blowfly are natural enemies.
And natural enemies suggests to me that the eggs weren't laid at the same time.
Put that together with the fact that neither insect developed past first instar, and I think we're looking at a sequence of events here.
So you're thinking that these bodies were moved.
Multiple times.

Frozen and refrozen.
Blowflies laid their eggs, the larvae froze to death, and then in a different place and time, the beetles had their chance.
If I can identify these species, isolate them to a specific habitat, it might give us a map to the killer's movements.
Sanders: We just turned onto Corvell.
Russell: Where the hell is he going?
I don't know. I don't get it.
All right, hold on. He's turning down an alley.
The car's stopped.
It's just sitting there.
Why are we stopping here?
Don't run.
He's making a call.
I can't hear anything.

I'm scared, Dad.
I keep thinking... what would you do?
I know that's what's gonna get me through this.

Love you, Dad.
I love you, too.
That person on the other end of the line, is that why you're doing this?
What do you want from me?
I just want the truth.
If I'm gonna die, I think I at least deserve that much.
You think that's gonna make it any easier?




Hodges.
What are you doing here?
Well, Morgan told me to stay, collect evidence.
In the dark?
You ever heard of work lights?
My mentor, Grissom, taught me to see the scene as the killer saw it.
That's great. But I would prefer work lights.


;
Sorry. It's not my fault that these floors are old and creaky.
What are you doing here anyway?
You found Shaw's prints here, right?
Everywhere.
Everywhere?
On the clippings, the work table and the freezer?
Well, no, not there, exactly.
I just suspect that when he wasn't lounging around, he was in serial killer mode and... wore gloves.
Um, far be it from me to listen to office gossip, but I understand that you and Shaw were close...
Hodges.
I-I'm sorry.
Boundaries. I get it.
Did you move this table?
Ah, well, my mentor...
The answer would be “no.”
Somebody moved the table.
Want to give me a hand?
Sure.


See what I mean about the floors?
Look at that.

And that is why you're a CSI.



Ran the partials from the strongbox.
They came back to our homeowner and string maker, Rebecca Lowell.
I don't think she was just making money from making strings.
Did you find something on the flash drive?
Files from an escort service.
Lady Aquarius Escorts, to be exact.
All of our victims are involved in the s*x trade, but we never knew how they were connected, or who was pimping them out.
They were all working for Rebecca Lowell?
File says yes.
Those are the names of all our victims.
And there's quite a client list, too.
Lots of prominent men, including Paul Winthrop.
Talk about a smoking gun.
For solicitation, not for murder.
Hmm.
I was looking at the receipts.
We are talking a lot of money.
Well, it's not surprising given the clientele.
What is the difference between a client and a friend?
Is it a price point?
I don't know.
I was just getting there.
Those are cops and judges from Las Vegas and from Seattle.
Money says bribes, protection.
Mm-hmm.
Shaw's on the list.
I don't believe it.
Cop on the take.
This connects him to Winthrop.
I have a daughter-- Kaitlyn.
She comes home from her grandparents' tomorrow.
Your dad taught you well.
How to humanize yourself in the eyes of a killer.
Do you have kids?
What does it matter?
Maya: Do you?
It's not going to work.
Then just tell me this.
Why me?
I know enough about those other girls to know that I'm not like them.
You're nothing like them.
Then why?
Is it because of my dad?
It's not just that.
Crawford: Okay, he's making another turn.
It's like he keeps going in a circle.
No, he's going back to the airport.
Winthrop got his brother released sometime this afternoon, right?
What time did they fly out of Seattle?
We have that information, right?
Winthrop's private jet took off from Seattle four hours ago.
That means they've already landed.
Guys, I think this is happening.
The meet's going down with Winthrop somewhere around the Executive Terminal at the airport.
He's going into a garage under an industrial building.
1017 Parkman Way.
Pull up that location.
That's Winthrop's building.
There's only one way in and one way out of this garage.
We go in, we're gonna get made.
What do you want to do?
Let's stick with the plan.
We wait for Winthrop.
What is this place?
Is this where it's gonna happen?
Quiet.
Just listen.

I went to a recital once.
Music like this. Strings.
There was a young girl playing the violin.
It was beautiful.
She was beautiful.
I couldn't believe that something so beautiful... could be mine.
But at the same time, I knew I didn't deserve her.
'Cause everything I touch, I destroy.
Because men like me are weak.
Because of that weakness, they commit crimes.
They commit sins.
Sins for which there is no going back.
She doesn't say anything.
Why isn't she saying anything?
There-there's something wrong. Damn it!
Guys, go in now!
All units, converge now!
Shaw: I want you to understand, I need you to understand, I didn't want this.
I didn't ask for this. I didn't choose this.
The choice was made for me.
Some things are just... ordained.
I sinned.
I sinned, and now you and I are both paying...
Son of a bitch played us.
Stokes: Russell, she's gone.
Nick, what happened?
Shaw pulled Maya's wire and left it in the car along with a digital recording of his voice.
Made it sound like they were still in there talking.
Any idea how they got out of there?
No, we're still working on that.
Hey, Nick? Over here.
Stokes: Hey, I think we just found Shaw's escape route.
We're checking it out right now.
Keep me posted.
They're long gone.
Well, look around here, man. There's got to be something.
Hey, here you go, Greg.
Come over here and take a look at this.
It's a wedding ring.
You think it's Maya's?
I do. She's a CSI's daughter, man.
She's a smart girl.
Leaving evidence behind like bread crumbs.
Next to what looks like tire treads.
Somebody peeled out of here.
I think she's trying to tell us they switched cars.
That might not be all she's trying to tell us.
Flecks of red paint here.
Must have been from the driver's door.
Shaw gives her the keys, tells her to drive.
She drops her ring by the rear tire and scratches the door getting in.
Sanders: Tire impressions and paint.
Could tell us what they're driving.
How is he doing?
Crawford: Not good.
Beating himself up.
He's not the only one.
I get it. We all want to get Winthrop and Briscoe.
And that son of a bitch, Shaw.
Should have heard him.
Talking about his exploits.
Some story about stalking a girl at a recital.
Who knows how many women he and those brothers have killed?
What exactly did he say about the girl at the recital?
His exact words were,
“It's hard to believe something so beautiful could be mine”&quot;
You scumbag.
That's it.
That's what?
I got to go.
Will you keep an eye on him?
I have only seen him like this once before, and it was not good.
You don't have to worry.
I'm not gonna run.
I'm not even gonna scream when you do to me whatever it is you're gonna do.
I'm not gonna give you the satisfaction.
You know, when I was a cop in Seattle, I didn't have much respect for people.
But I always respected your dad.
You're strong... like him.
You have no idea.
I am not going to make it easy.
Light's green. Go.
Hey.
I'm so sorry.
You heard about Maya.
I did.
Well, you were there yourself.
And I had a dad who held himself responsible for a decision that was just as much mine as it was his.
Doesn't make it any easier.
I know.
Look, we're gonna get her back.
We're gonna find her just like you guys found me.
Yeah. Yes, we are.
Greg ran the, uh... tread patterns and the, uh... the paint chip from where Shaw switched cars, and it came back to a 2014 red Chevy Impala, which is like a needle in a haystack around here.
There are hundreds of them in Nevada.
What about you? You're-you're running the-the bugs from the bodies, right, to track down the killer's movement?
Yeah.
We know that the bodies were moved at least a few times from the crime scene to The Mizu, where they were harvested to make the killer's strings.
And then Rebecca Lowell's house where you found them.
But given the condition of the larvae on the bodies, it looks like they were frozen and unfrozen more than that.
So there might be some other place they were kept.
Exactly.
Unfortunately, the species of blowfly that I found on the bodies is far too common to zero in on any specific location, but I'm hoping... that these guys are different.
Scolytus ventralis, the fir engraver beetle.
Yeah. Most common in northern Nevada, but I'm checking with the Bureau of Land Management to see if they've had any infestations closer to Vegas.
It could be where Shaw's taking Maya.
Well, that's where the... the hope part comes in.

I got a response from the Bureau.
“In the last six months, there have been reports of fir engraver beetle colonies threatening trees along Bighorn Ridge.”
That's right here.
That's a big area.
There are only a certain amount of roads in there, so they have to pass by a traffic camera at some point, right?
Right.
Good work. Thanks.
♪ ♪
D.B., I need to talk to you.
I know why Shaw's doing what he's doing.
Tell you the truth, I don't really care, and I need to get to PD. I need you to hear this.
The violin. The story about the girl at the recital.
That was not Shaw talking about one of his victims.
He was talking about his daughter.
I should've realized it right away. The violin-- it-it wasn't full size, it's a kid's instrument, and-and...
All right, slow down, slow down.
I ran the DNA on the violin.
It's female.
It's a familial match to the dead woman that we found in the bed, Rebecca Lowell's sister, and to Shaw.
D.B., he had a daughter.
You sure about this?
Yes, and it all makes sense now.
He was protecting the escort ring run by Rebecca Lowell, and in her records it says that her sister was one of the escorts.
So Shaw was involved with the sister and had a kid.
Yeah, and I confirmed the birth records.
Amy Lowell was born 2001.
And I don't think I'm the only one who's figured this out.
Winthrop. He is exploiting Shaw's one weakness.
And based on the evidence that I found in that house, I think that Winthrop murdered the mother and abducted the daughter and now he's holding her for one reason and one reason only.
To trade.
Maya for Amy.
My daughter for his.
Shut off the engine.

Give me the key.
Get out.
Why are you doing this?
Because you don't seem like the type.
A killer.
A man who preys on women.
Let's go.
Are they waiting for me?
You'll find out soon enough.
Winthrop: Maya.
Welcome.
My brother was right.
You're even more beautiful in person.
I told you so.
Four years in prison.
It was worth every day just for this moment.
You were right, brother.
Dreams really do come true.
We had a deal. Where's my daughter?
She's here. And you'll have her.
Just as soon as you slide that gun over here.
We wouldn't want any surprises, would we? I'm sure you can understand.
My brother and I don't have a lot of trust in cops.
Even dirty ones.
Well, I don't trust murderers.
I want to see Amy.
Crawford: Just got this from the Northeast Division.
That's Shaw's car traveling east on Sunrise Highway.
Russell: 6:27 a.m.
That's 20 minutes ago.
Yeah, if Shaw's meeting with Winthrop, Winthrop's M.O. says the location will be an industrial area or a warehouse district.
Right. Someplace isolated, away from prying eyes.
Pull up the map of Bighorn Ridge.
They're flooding this area with patrol units.
We've also scrambled air support.
We got eyes in the sky.
That's still a hell of lot of real estate.
Yes, it is.
But we're getting closer.
Control, this is Air-Seven.
Just identified the suspect vehicle.
Red Chevy Impala, license number Adam-Tom-David-Charlie 425.
What's your location, Air-Seven?
1500 block of Sunrise Highway.
Looks like some kind of warehouse.
Come on, let's go.
Yeah.
Amy.
Dad.
Ah, ah, ah, not so fast.
There'll be plenty of time for hugs and kisses later.
The gun.
You all right, sweetheart?
I want to get out of here. Where's my mom?
It's gonna be all right.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
So sweet.
Nothing like family, right, Jared?
When do I get what's coming to me?
Patience, brother.
You know we can't have any loose ends.
I should've figured you'd do this.
You should've figured a dirty cop would have a throwaway. Run.




You think you're smarter than me?
You've taken from me the only family I've ever had.
The only real family.
The only real love in my life.

I saw how you looked at your little girl.
I know how much she means to you.
She's not gonna get very far, 'cause I'm gonna find her.
And just so you know, when I do, I'm gonna do things to her you can't even imagine.


Don't move.
I'll get help.
Maya, you all right?
Yeah, I'm okay.
Where are they?
Inside. Shaw's wounded.
And Winthrop and Briscoe are dead, I think.
Let's roll, boys.

Check the back.
Briscoe's dead.
I got a pulse, but it's faint.
Charlie-04-Stokes. I need immediate medical at my location.
Maya said that Winthrop's dead.
But where the hell is he?

Hey.
Hey.
You must be Amy, yeah?
I'm Detective Crawford.
We're gonna get you out of here, okay?
Dad.
Hey.
You were so brave.
Learned from the best.
I was afraid...
I know. I know. Me, too.
Hey.
Hi.
How are you doing?
I've... been better.
How's Amy doing?
She's safe.
She's with Child Protective Services now.
They're not gonna let me see her, are they?
Well, that's probably just the same.
I was never a very good father to her anyway.
Just... some guy who showed up from time to time, took her to the park, got her some ice cream, then I was gone again.
I just wish you would've come to me before all this happened.
Maybe I could've helped.
I should've.
Yeah.
There's something you can do for me now.
Amy's got a grandmother, lives in Texas. She's a good woman.
I just can't bear to see her get lost in the system.
I'll make sure she doesn't.
You should just focus on getting better.
That's when the trouble starts, right?
When I get out of here?
I talked to Greg.
He and Nick are still processing the scene.
They found a blood trail leading from the building to a drainage tunnel, which led to a wash.
But no Winthrop?
No.
Russell: All these women.
Maya was almost one of them.
But she wasn't.
You came close, D.B.
The greater good.
Briscoe's dead, and Winthrop's on the run, a fugitive.
You can plaster his face everywhere, freeze his accounts.
You're in the driver's seat.
Why doesn't it feel like that?
No.
No, this guy's a predator.
He's an animal.
You know what they say.
Animals are most dangerous when they're cornered.

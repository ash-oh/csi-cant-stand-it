<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) -- DAY] </p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY COURTHOUSE (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: (V.O.) I need you to answer the same questions I asked you at the first trial.</p>
<p>[INT. LAS VEGAS COUNTY COURTHOUSE - JUDGE WITHERSPOON'S COURTROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(Trial is in session. The attorney is cross-examining Grissom who is currently on the stand. The jury box is full.) </p>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: And I need you to answer them honestly, just as you did back then. On December 20, 1999, you responded to a call at 2028 Boulder Highway. Is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: Can you describe the crime scene?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It was a hardware store. I entered through the back door.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [HARDWARE STORE] Camera's from Grissom's POV as he enters the hardware store and sees the body on the floor.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) The victim had been severely beaten. </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And our forensics determined that the murder weapon was a wrench.</p>
<p>(Jeffrey Sinclair picks up the evidence bag.) </p>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: Exhibit A. Do you recognize this object?</p>
<p>(He shows the evidence bag to Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yes. I bagged and processed this wrench. My initials are on the seal.</p>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: Where did you find it?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It was in a toolbox under the kitchen sink at Garbett's Gourmet, which is a restaurant next to the crime scene.</p>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: Now, are you certain that this wrench was used to kill the victim?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yes. We found trace blood in the metal grooves. And the DNA matched the victim's.</p>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: What, if anything, did you find on the handle?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We found the defendant, Mr. Garbett's, fingerprints. We also found his prints at the hardware store.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: [HARDWARE STORE] Max Larson is in the store when Jason Garbett walks in and attacks him. End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: What else did you find at the store?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [HARDWARE STORE] Jason Garbett tries to set a fire with some old crumpled newspaper. A book of matches is nearby.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) Well, it appeared that the killer tried to cover his tracks by setting a fire, ... </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) ... a lack of sufficient combustibles may have thwarted his effort.</p>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: Dr. Grissom. Exhibit B. Do you recognize this?</p>
<p>(The attorney gives Grissom the second bagged evidence. Grissom looks at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yes. It's a matchbook.</p>
<p>(While looking at the matchbook, Grissom sees something he hadn't seen there before.) </p>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: Did you find this matchbook at the scene?</p>
<p>(Grissom doesn't answer the question.) </p>
<p>(The evidence label on the bag reads:<br />
MATCHBOOK 002<br />
12-20-99<br />
2028 BOULDER HWY LV, NV<br />
GIL GRISSOM G.G.</p>
<p>(On the inside of the matchbook cover is a red thumbprint.) </p>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: Dr. Grissom, just so we can be clear, this is the matchbook that you found at the crime scene. Is that correct?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Your honor, may I take a short break?</p>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: Um ... prosecution requests a ten-minute recess.</p>
<p><strong>Defense Attorney</strong>: The defense asks that Dr. Grissom answer the question now.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Witherspoon</strong>: Answer the question, then we'll break.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yes, this is the matchbook I collected at the crime scene.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Witherspoon</strong>: All right, we'll take a ten-minute recess.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. COURTHOUSE - CONFERENCE ROOM - RECESS - DAY]</p>
<p>(Grissom is in a conference room looking through the reports.) </p>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: So, you wanna tell me what this is all about? Grissom, the defendant was found guilty at his first trial. The only reason we're back in court is because his new lawyer convinced some appellate judge the original jury instructions were faulty. This has nothing to do with the evidence.</p>
<p>(Grissom picks up the matchbook and sighs as he looks at it.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: There's a fingerprint on this matchbook.</p>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I don't remember it. It's not in my notes. </p>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: The evidence seal isn't broken. If the print's there now, it was there before.</p>
<p>(Grissom compares the print on the matchbook with the defendant's print card.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The defendant's fingerprints are all loop patterns. This is an arch. It's not a match. This is not the defendant's print.</p>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: Are you sure? </p>
<p>(Grissom takes his glasses off and puts the matchbook down on the table.) </p>
<p><strong>Jeffrey Sinclair</strong>: You know, when the defense hears about this, they are going to call every other piece of evidence into question. I don't need to tell you what that means.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I've given them reasonable doubt.</p>
<p>FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Grissom is returning back to work when Conrad Ecklie catches up with him.) </p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Heard we have a problem.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The Middle East has a problem.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: You missed a fingerprint on a key piece of evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm trying to keep an open mind.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Then how do you explain it?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: At the moment, I can't.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Could someone have substituted a different matchbook?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, the evidence seal wasn't broken. The matchbook's appearance is consistent with the crime scene photos.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Since your original testimony differs from the actual physical evidence, I thought I'd inform you I've opened a supervisory inquiry.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, that's good, Conrad. You know, I can't recall a lab director as expeditious as you.</p>
<p>(Suddenly, a gunshot sounds along with glass shattering.)</p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong>: (b.g.) Man! What happened! VOICE: (b.g.) Who's that?</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - BALLISTICS LAB - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Bobby removes his earphones. He stares at the broken glass when Grissom and Ecklie rush into the lab.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You okay, Bobby?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: Been better.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: What the hell happened?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: I was about to test-fire the mac-10 when it accidentally discharged. Don't know how it happened. Should've been more careful.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Whose, uh, whose case you working?</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: Uh ... (He glances nervously at Grissom.) Sara Sidle and Greg Sanders. Gun was found next to a dead body at an off-strip parking lot.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: All right. Make sure you file a report.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Dawson</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: (to everyone) Everybody back to work. (to Grissom) Just keep me posted.</p>
<p>(Ecklie turns and leaves.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Grissom meets with Catherine, Warrick and Nick to discuss the Max Lawson case.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I remember this case. The Garbetts owned a restaurant that was next door to the victim's hardware store. Max Larson owned the private alleyway that was behind both places.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [ALLEYWAY] Jason Garbett walks out and pulls the garbage bin off to the side.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) That's right. He blocked the alleyway with a dumpster.</p>
<p><strong>Jason Garbett</strong>: (under his breath) Jerk.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, the guy was a jerk.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, he claimed the restaurant's delivery trucks were clogging the alley.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Didn't the Garbetts sue to have the dumpster removed?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: They lost. There was no easement in their title.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And without access for deliveries, the restaurant business just dried up.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: All the physical evidence pointed to Garbett. And according to the victim's business partner, Garbett had an argument with the victim the day before the murder. </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Garbett's appeal didn't call the forensics into question. Why are we here?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm calling the forensics into question. (He holds up the matchbook.)<br />
I printed this matchbook. There was no print. Take a look at it now.</p>
<p>(He hands the matchbook to Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, the fingerprint's pink -- so you used ninhydrin?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [PAST] Grissom sprays the matchbook. End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, I know that on some surfaces, ninhydrin can take time to develop a print. It was in, uh, last May's &quot;Journal of Forensic Sciences&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I remember the article. But I can't remember whether the variables in the test case are consistent with ours.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, if the print matches the suspect, who cares?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It doesn't match. So, you and Warrick take over the file -- make sure all of the other evidence is beyond reproach. Catherine, you supervise. To avoid any appearance of impropriety, I'm going to be hands off.</p>
<p>(Grissom leaves the office.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - GRISSOM'S OFFICE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Grissom is in his office going through old magazines. There's a soft knock at his door.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sofia.</p>
<p>(Sofia walks into the office. She sees the &quot;Journal of Forensic Science&quot; magazines scattered on Grissom's desk.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: You do know that the &quot;Journal's&quot; back issues are available on-line. The lab has a password. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: When you read from a computer screen, you have to lean in. I like to lean back. Therefore, I prefer a hard copy.</p>
<p>(She glances down on the desk and picks up a &quot;Journal&quot;.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Is this what you're looking for?</p>
<p>(She hands it to Grissom. He looks at it.<br />
VOLUME 48<br />
NUMBER 3<br />
MAY 2003</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: May. Yes. Thank you. News travels so fast around here.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Ecklie travels fast. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Look, in case you're not up-to-date on your QA/QC memos, I've been the lab's Quality Control Officer for the past year.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Congratulations. That job requires a detail-oriented person.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Grissom, I've been assigned to your inquiry. I just wanted to give you the heads-up. I'll be impartial.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'd expect nothing less.</p>
<p>(Sofia turns and heads for the door.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: &quot;Margaritaville&quot;? </p>
<p>(She stops and looks at Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That is still the lab's password, right?</p>
<p>(She smiles and leaves.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Catherine, Warrick and Nick go over the case files.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Warrick, in your field report, you documented the collection of several hairs near the body, but DNA never analyzed them.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, the DA had sufficient evidence and filed charges before I could give the hair to Greg, so I moved on to another case.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Process the hairs now.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Catherine, do you remember why you were late to this crime scene? Eddie had a gig and you couldn't find a baby-sitter.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Actually, I kind of made that up. Eddie did have a gig. It ended early and he and I ... well, let's just say that not all my memories of him are bad ones. (to Warrick) Which reminds me you, at the time, were going out with that Assistant Manager of the Flamingo--</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Oh, Susan.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Boy, did she have it bad for you. She kept calling while we were working the scene. You had to shut your phone off.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, well, now she's VP of Food Services, so I get free steak and eggs every Sunday morning.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Free steak and eggs means she didn't know about the flight attendant.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Does everyone know my business around here?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay, Nicky, since you have such a good memory, why don't you explain the unidentified prints that you lifted from the murder weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I lifted six prints off the wrench. I ran them through I-AFIS. Five were a match to the suspect. One was unidentified. Now, at the time, we all agreed that that print was irrelevant, because the wrench was found in the common area.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay, well, we're going to have to compare that unidentified print with this matchbook print.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Will do. Hey, Catherine ... we didn't do anything wrong here.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I agree. But the prosecution may not see it that way.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC PATHOLOGY - DAY]</p>
<p>(Sara and Greg are walking into the room.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (o.s.) Well, the doc should be able to clear this up.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Hey, how's Bobby doing?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Shaken, but working hard. Trying to figure out why the gun discharged.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Well, fortunately, Bobby dodged his bullet -- unlike our victim.</p>
<p>(Sara glances down at the victim's arm and notices the &quot;RITA&quot; tattoo. Robbins and David go over the body with Sara and Greg.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: C.O.D's a single gunshot wound to the leg.</p>
<p>(Robbins points to the bullet hole.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: And it severed the femoral artery.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: We processed the guy's jeans. Tight GSR pattern around the entrance hole.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So, he was either shot by someone at close range who left the gun behind, or it was self-inflicted.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Why would the shooter leave the gun behind?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: He probably wouldn't.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: And most suicides are through the torso or through the head.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So if it wasn't intentional ...</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: It was accidental.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Greg ... insert this rod into the hole.</p>
<p>(Robbins hands Greg a colored rod. Greg inserts it into the bullet hole.)</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV of: The rod is inserted clear through the flesh and comes out the back of the leg. End of CGI POV. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Trajectory is up to down.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Consistent with a self-inflicted, accidental injury.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [NIGHT] The victim shoots himself in the leg and falls to the ground in pain. End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Have you been able to I.D. Him?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: No wallet. Prints didn't hit. No relatives came forward. So, I'm calling him John Doe Number 124.</p>

<p>(Nick scans the fingerprint from the matchbook into the computer as Catherine watches.) </p>
<p>(He scans the fingerprint from the wrench into the computer. He compares the two.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: A perfect match.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Someone other than the suspect touched the matches and the wrench.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: The wrench was found in a toolbox in the suspect's restaurant. The murder happened after closing.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Who else had access to that restaurant?</p>

[INT. CSI - WAITING ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Nick meets with Mrs. Katz.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mrs. Garbett.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Katz</strong>: It's, uh, Mrs. Katz now. I remarried.</p>
<p>(They shake hands.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Oh, okay-- Mrs. Katz. Duly noted. (She sits down.) Please, have a seat. I appreciate you coming down here and meeting with me.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Katz</strong>: Look, my ex-husband called me from jail. I know about the new trial. But this case has nothing to do with me. Not anymore. He got a life sentence. The crime lab testified.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You think he's guilty?</p>
<p>(She sighs.) </p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Katz</strong>: Jason was a quiet man. Bottled everything up. In twenty-five years of marriage, he raised his voice ... maybe ... a dozen times. But when he expressed himself ... the neighborhood knew.</p>
<p>(The door opens and Keith Garbett walks inside.) </p>
<p><strong>Keith Garbett</strong>: Mom, I got your voice mail.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Katz</strong>: Keith.</p>
<p><strong>Keith Garbett</strong>: What's going on?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Katz</strong>: Uh, Mr. Stokes is with the crime lab.</p>
<p><strong>Keith Garbett</strong>: Hi. Look, we'll help in any way we can.</p>
<p>(Keith sits down.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What I'd really like to do is get a list of anyone who had access to that restaurant five years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Keith Garbett</strong>: Sure. May I ask why? </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Recent evidence has come to light ...</p>
<p><strong>Keith Garbett</strong>: What evidence?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Oh, now that I can't discuss.</p>

<p><strong>Neil Jansen</strong>: Matchbook print. Everybody's talking about it.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, good. Scientific discoveries arise through discourse. Now ... ninhydrin works by reacting to one end of a protein chain to form ruhemann's purple ...</p>
<p><strong>Neil Jansen</strong>: Which makes fingerprints visible.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Protein chains are made up of a series of amino acids, sometimes a hundred units long. But only one end of the chain has the h-n-H ...</p>
<p><strong>Neil Jansen</strong>: The n-terminus. </p>
<p>(Quick flash of: the end of the protein chain. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Neil Jansen</strong>: It's the only part of the protein molecule that interacts with ninhydrin.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: But fingerprints are subjected to bacterial degradation, which causes the proteins to break down into smaller amino acids.</p>
<p><strong>Neil Jansen</strong>: Upping the number of n-termini.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And making the fingerprint more visible. But because new fingerprints are sometimes composed of fully intact proteins, you could spray ninhydrin, and not see a result for months, yes?</p>
<p><strong>Neil Jansen</strong>: Or in rare cases, years -- depending on the rate of degradation.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: My matchbook print was inside a plastic evidence bag. That could affect the rate.</p>
<p><strong>Neil Jansen</strong>: Let's see ... plastic ... plastic traps in heat and humidity.</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Oh, yes, ma'am. At minimum, they're looking at conspiracy.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: As far as we know, they could've been in it together. It's easier to overpower a guy when it's two against one.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, but I don't think it went down that way. After your father was convicted, you gave up on your veterinary practice. Moved back to Vegas -- spent every last dime you had on his defense. Now, that tells me you had a guilty conscience.</p>
<p><strong>Keith Garbett</strong>: It should tell you that I love my father.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Your father spent the last five years in prison, man. If you love him so much, why don't you tell the truth? Set him free.</p>
<p><strong>Keith Garbett</strong>: My father had nothing to do with it.</p>
<p><strong>Lawyer</strong>: Keith ... I never thought that they would convict an innocent man. So ... I kept quiet.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: To protect yourself.</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT -- OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Grissom and Conrad Ecklie both watch the interview.) </p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: We'll convene in my office at end of your shift.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Regarding what? This case is over.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Don't be late.</p>
<p>FADE OUT</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. TURLOCK RESIDENCE - FRONT - EVENING/NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Det. Vartann is waiting out front as Sara and Greg drive up.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: What's going on? Dispatch said to meet you here.</p>
<p>(Sara gets out of the car.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, three days ago we found a John Doe who was shot to death in an abandoned parking lot off strip. Uh, there was a mac-10 near the body. Gun is registered to a Paul Turlock, who happens to be the owner of the house.</p>
<p>(Greg joins them and they head for the house.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Oh, so you want to see if Paul Turlock and John Doe are one and the same.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(They reach the front door and see the newspaper on the ground.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Odds are looking pretty good so far.</p>
<p>(Det. Vartann takes out his gun and flashlight. Sara knocks on the door and it creaks open. He leans in toward the door as Sara takes out her weapon and gets behind Vartan.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Police! Anybody here?</p>
<p>(He lifts up his weapon and pushes the door open.)</p>
<p>[INT. TURLOCK RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Det. Vartann and Sara enter the residence with their guns raised. After a while, it's apparent that no one's there. Sara puts her gun down. Vartann puts his gun away.) </p>
<p>(Greg walks in and they all look around the house.)</p>
<p>(Greg sees a box and looks inside.)</p>
<p>(On the coffee table on an old newspaper, Vartann finds a photo of two men drinking beer.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Sara.</p>
<p>(She walks over.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Any of these look like your guy?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Guy on the end with the &quot;Rita&quot; tattoo.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Think Rita's his mom or his girlfriend?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: If it's not crossed out, it's definitely his mom.</p>
<p>(Vartann nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Mac in the box. Five of them. Serials obliterated. </p>
<p>(They both turn and head over toward Greg.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Files and grinding stone.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: It's all the tools needed to convert a semi into an auto and then cover your tracks.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Each modified weapon's a separate count. Each filed-off serial number's a separate count. This guy was looking at ten felonies.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Actually, he already got the death penalty.</p>
<p>(Vartann walks over and checks the answering machine.)</p>
<p><strong>Man's Voice</strong>: (answering machine) Hey, Paulie, we, uh, liked what we saw. The deal's a go. Five large for five units. I'll call you back to arrange a time.</p>
<p>(The answering machine beeps.)</p>
<p><strong>Man's Voice</strong>: (answering machine) Paulie. 9:00 P.M. Monday. </p>
<p>(The machine clicks off. Vartann turns and looks at Sara and Greg.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: That's tonight.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: &quot;We liked what we saw&quot;? That tells me that Paulie's already met with the buyers-- probably to show them the prototype of the mac-10.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Maybe they met at the parking lot where we found the body.</p>
<p>(Vartann looks at his watch.) </p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: You know, most likely they'd hook up at the same location to complete the sale.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Buyers don't know he's dead.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Lucky for us.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY TO LAB -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(We follow behind Conrad Ecklie as he walks down the hallway. He peers in through the window and sees Nick working. He opens the door.) </p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Hell of a job on the Larson case, Nick. If it weren't for you, the son would've walked.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (shrugs) It was a team effort.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Team effort? Just like the Westanson case, right? Last year, that woman who burned to ashes in a barrel of diesel fuel.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah. Yeah, I'm familiar with the case, Conrad.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: I reviewed Grissom's report. It seems to me that you were a ... one-man CSI machine. (He chuckles.) Grissom rejected Fay Minden's testimony, but not you.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (corrects) No, Grissom allowed me to pursue a new lead, under his supervision.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Did he offer you any other CSIs as support staff? (Nick catches on to what Ecklie's doing.) D-don't worry about it. I respect your independence. (Nick's not impressed.) Anyway, good work.</p>
<p>(Ecklie leaves the lab.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. PARKING LOT -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(A car drives into the parking lot and circles around. The engine stops and a man steps out of the car. He looks around and zips up his jacket.) </p>
<p>(Sirens wail as police cars circle and pull up into the parking lot. Vartann exits his car, his gun pointed at the buyer.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Keep your hands up. No sudden moves.</p>
<p>(Sara and Greg exit the car.) </p>
<p><strong>ATF Agent</strong>: ATF. I'm an agent.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: Just keep your hands where I can see 'em, and you won't get hurt.</p>
<p>(Another non-descript car pulls up. An ATF agent gets out of the car and holds out his badge.) </p>
<p><strong>John Calder (ATF)</strong>: Special Agent John Calder, ATF. He's an undercover agent.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I don't believe this.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Vartann</strong>: You're involved in a buy bust for some firearms?</p>
<p><strong>John Calder (ATF)</strong>: You boys burned us bad. We were gonna make an arrest tonight.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Suspect's name is Paul Turlock?</p>
<p><strong>John Calder</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Mr. Turlock A.D.'d a mac into his femoral artery. You guys are four days too late.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - ECKLIE'S OFFICE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Ecklie meets with Grissom and Sofia Curtis.) </p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: If I understand you correctly, the latent fingerprint on the matchbook ... continued to process itself after you were finished.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Theoretically, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: As I know you are aware, I've asked Sofia to review your handling of the Max Larson homicide. (to Sofia) Did Supervisor Grissom violate any procedures in mishandling the evidence?</p>
<p>(She looks at Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: I don't believe he mishandled anything. He followed laboratory protocol, and when he saw that the evidence didn't correspond to his records, he notified the D.A. and recused himself from case review.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Are you saying that, uh, his handling of the discovery of new evidence while on the stand is within our protocols?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: (carefully) As it applies to this case, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: In the, uh ... in the process of investigating this case, your ability to supervise has come into question.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Isn't that a little beyond the scope of this inquiry?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: Again, we have no evidence that Grissom violated any protocols or proce ...</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: (interrupts) Thank you for your input.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (tired) Okay, Conrad, what do you got? Let's hear it.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Well, taken individually, there's nothing specific that warrants disciplinary action. However, my investigation has led me to question the effectiveness of your team and your ability to lead it. I'm breaking you guys up.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: I've already spoken with the Director. Staff assignments are under my purview. Effective immediately, Catherine Willows will be promoted to Swing Shift Supervisor ...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Wait a minute, Catherine applied for days.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: I do what's best for the lab. I've decided to move the Swing Shift Supervisor to days ... </p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: I've been the Acting Supervisor of days for the past month -- I believe I've proven myself capable.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: (ignores her) Warrick Brown and Nick Stokes will report to Catherine. Greg Sanders, pending his proficiency, Sara Sidle and Sofia will report to you.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia Curtis</strong>: (stunned) You're demoting me.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: I think you and Grissom suit each other.</p>
<p>(Sofia stares at Ecklie in disbelief and shakes her head.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (quietly) Why are you doing this?</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: There's been a chronic lack of supervision on the graveyard shift. Your people have been covering for you, Gil. For your shortcomings. Before your mismanagement jeopardizes this lab, I'm rectifying the situation.</p>
<p>(Grissom shakes his head and scoffs.)</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: My decision is final.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. DINER -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Nick and Warrick meet with Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: He kind of talked to all of us.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It was more like he ambushed all of us. Real sorry, Grissom.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: There's no reason to be. Look, Ecklie doesn't have a scientific bone in his body. He starts with the answers he wants and then devises the questions to get them.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: This sucks. This guy has been kissing ass all his life, he's trying to tell me -- he's trying to tell us what makes a good supervisor. What makes a good team?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, if a team gets used to doing things a certain way just because that's the way they've always done them, then they start to lose their effectiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Oh, come on. You don't really believe that.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No. I believe that the longer a team works together, the stronger they become. But I'm not in charge of the lab, nor would I want to be.</p>
<p>(The waitress puts the bill on the table. Nick picks up the bill and looks at it.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I got this -- that's the kind of cash I'm bringing down right now.</p>
<p>(Nick leaves the booth.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I always knew there'd come a time when we weren't, uh, working together anymore. I just didn't think it'd be under these circumstances.</p>
<p>(Warrick's phone rings. He answers it.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (to phone) Brown. Okay. All right. No, I'll tell Nick. We'll see you there. Uh, congrats, by the way. (He hangs up.) (to Grissom) All right. My new supervisor.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Catherine?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (nods) Good.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, I got to get some rest. Swing shift starts at four in the afternoon. That's a big change.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Heracleitus once said, &quot;It is in changing that we find purpose.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, thanks to you, this job, I already know my purpose. See ya.</p>
<p>(Warrick gets up and leaves the booth.)</p>
<p>(Grissom sits at the table alone.) </p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK</p>

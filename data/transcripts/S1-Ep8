[INT. HOTEL MONACO - HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Camera close up of a tumbler. Someone drops three ice cubes and pours the rest of the vodka from the bottle into the glass.)</p>
<p>(He picks up the glass and walks around the room. He sits on the bed and drinks from his glass.)</p>
<p>(He stands up and walks into the bathroom to stand in front of the foggy mirror. He uses the back of his hand to wipe it clear. He stares at himself and sighs.)</p>
<p>(He turns around.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. HOTEL MONACO - HALLWAY -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns the corner to the hotel hallway and makes his way to the officer who stands just outside the hotel room door. The OFFICER signals GRISSOM inside the room.)</p>
<p>[HOTEL ROOM -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks into the room. BRASS is inside with two other OFFICERS. He looks at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh ... you're going to love this.</p>
<p>(BRASS pulls out a cloth from his pocket to open the bathroom door. They look inside.)</p>
<p>[BATHROOM -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(At the far end of the bathroom, is a tub ... with the dead body inside.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Ring any bells? Rub-a-dub-dub, dead man in a tub.</p>
<p>(BRASS and GRISSOM step into the bathroom. GRISSOM puts his kit down near the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Sleeping bag for easy cleanup. Open window so the stench alerts the neighbors.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks around.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's Royce Harmon all over again. </p>
<p>(Quick flashes of: A shot of the chest bullet wound. Flash to: The revolver in the man's left hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What do you think? &quot;Suicide&quot; note in the same place?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM steps forward.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You tell me, Karnak. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM cautiously look, reaches out and finds the tape recorder clutched in the body's right hand. He takes it and looks at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Now, that's weird.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Not weird. Intentional.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM presses play.)</p>
<p><strong>Recorded Voice</strong>: (from tape) ... narl loop sair momoph reet reet seer pute narfenging ...</p>
<p>(GRISSOM shuts it off.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What kind of language is that? Swedish?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's backward. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM thinks about it for a moment, then turns around to look at BRASS.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Would you excuse me a minute?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (nods) Sure. Okay.</p>
<p>(BRASS steps out of the bathroom and closes the door behind him.)</p>

<p>(BRASS shuts the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer Arvington</strong>: He okay in there?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Quincy wants to be alone. We had a case like this three months ago -- a guy found dead in his bathtub. Turned out the suicide was staged. Found a mini-recorder as a suicide note. </p>
<p>(BRASS turns to look at the closed bathroom doors.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Killer may have struck again.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Arvington</strong>: Why does he want to be alone?</p>
<p>(BRASS looks at OFFICER ARVINGTON.)</p>

818 Noeing Hill Court, Las Vegas, Nevada. I am 43 years of age, and I'm going to kill myself. I just can't do it anymore. I love you, mom.</p>
<p>(He shuts the recorder off and stands there a moment. He turns to look at his reflection in the mirror.)</p>

[INT. CSI - HALLWAY -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks into the hallway reading the assignment sheets in one hand; the bagged tape recorder in the other. He looks up and sees SHIBLEY walking toward him.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Shibley, take this recorder to the print lab. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM hands the tape recorder to SHIBLEY, then continues down the hallway.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Have Manny dust it and run prints on it right away.</p>
<p>(SHIBLEY gives GRISSOM a large envelope.)</p>
<p><strong>Shibley</strong>: Photos from tonight's suicide. Put a &quot;rush&quot; on them for you.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Photos. Thank you.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks down the hallway and stops when he hears what sounds like a football game whistle coming from the break room. He looks inside.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI -- BREAK ROOM - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(WARRICK and NICK play a video football game.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Oh! <strong>Warrick</strong>: Throw the flag, ref! NICK: Uncatchable, bro.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks into the break room.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (irritated) Hey! You guys want an assignment slip or a pink slip?</p>
<p>(WARRICK stands up; NICK shuts the game off and also stands up.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Just taking a little coffee break.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Is it true?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Same guy?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (calmer) I don't know. We'll see. Here. 410. Reckless driver out at Hoover Dam. Car went over a cliff. Anonymous caller. Could be foul play.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM gives WARRICK the assignment sheet.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Oh, me and him, working together? Oh, it's on.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You're going down, bro.</p>
<p>(WARRICK hands the sheet to NICK. The two gearing up for the challenge ahead.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (irritated) Hey! Work together tonight. All right?</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: &quot;The ones that got away.&quot; Fish.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Ah. I missed that one.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM stands in front of the large fish-shaped corkboard and takes down some photographs.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: First victim, Royce Harmon. About three months ago, Brass and I found this guy dead in his own bathtub, but his &quot;suicide&quot; was staged. I think the killer has killed again. </p>
<p>(He hands the photos to SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Photos of tonight's victim: Stuart Rampler. Play the &quot;pick six things that are different&quot; game. Bet you lose.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks at the photos.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: This guy's good.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Not good. Exceptional. Print examiner lifted a thumbprint off the mini-recorder near the tub of our first victim. The print came back this.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks around GRISSOM'S office and finds the fake hand. She shows it to SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The killer purchased one of these rubber hands laced the fingertips with cooking spray and proceeded to place false prints all around the crime scene.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: This guy is good. Whose prints are these?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Some guy who works in a warehouse making Halloween paraphernalia. Scary masks, air-brushed tombstones, rubber hands. Turns out he used his own hand for the mold.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So what do we do?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We split up. You and I go to the coroner. Sara, you go to the hotel. Dust every inch of that bathroom. Here. Use this --</p>

<p><strong>Paramedic</strong>: So far.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Call came in blind. You see who could have made it?</p>
<p><strong>Paramedic</strong>: No. We were first on the scene. Fire department came in two minutes behind. Place was dead quiet.</p>

<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: I've read Klausbach's report on Royce Harmon the first staged suicide.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Similarities?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Well, based on the entry wound, they were both murdered. But here's where it gets fun.</p>
<p>(DR. ROBBINS shows them the wound on the back of STUART RAMPLER'S left hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: That looks like he was shot trying to protect himself.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What else, Doc? My mind is painting.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: He was paid a little visit from Mr. Muzzle stamp.</p>
<p>(DR. ROBBINS shows them the bruise on the temple.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The gun is against STUART RAMPLER'S temple. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Forced into the tub at gunpoint?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Okay. Let's play it out.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns around. The clock behind GRISSOM reads 4:35pm.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The killer's got him at gunpoint, right? Standing over him like this.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: STUART RAMPLER puts his hand up to block the gunshot.)</p>
<p><strong>Stuart Rampler</strong>: No!!</p>
<p>(Quick CGI that follows the bullet as it pierces through flesh. End of CGI. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: But this time, things got messy. Royce Harmon didn't fight back. That's why there was no muzzle bruising to his temple.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Stuart Rampler was resistant. He didn't want to get into that tub too easily. He took a few jabs to the temple.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: But the killer just lost round one. We know how he gets his vics into the tub and we know that both deaths were homicides.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Not a bad start.</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: The skid start way up the road. I got him doing at least 70.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: More like 80.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: These grooves are from the car's frame. It balanced before it fell. </p>
<p>(NICK looks a the shoe prints in the dirt.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: This is where he bailed. Wide spacing, slipping of the heel. He ran.</p>
<p>(WARRICK takes a photo.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: The phantom driver.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [NICK'S VERSION] Inside the moving car.) </p>
<p><strong>Walter Banglor</strong>: Hey, hand me another beer.</p>
<p><strong>Phantom Driver</strong>: No, you've had enough.</p>
<p>(The car heads straight for the truck. Its horn blares. The car swerves.)</p>
<p><strong>Phantom Driver</strong>: Hey, hey...!</p>
<p>(Tires squeal. The car crashes through the railing and teeters on the edge of the embankment, its engine still running. The PHANTOM DRIVER bails. The Drunk Backseat Passenger, WALTER BANGLOR, stays in the car as it topples over and off the cliff.)</p>
<p>(The PHANTOM DRIVER runs away. WALTER BANGLOR screams as the car falls down the ravine.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So your drunk driver just got out and ran away?</p>
<p>(NICK looks at WARRICK and nods.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Where to?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I don't know. That's why we're up here. But he left his buddy hanging out to dry. I can tell you that.</p>
<p>(WARRICK points to the tire marks on the roadway behind NICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Then how do you explain car number two?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Driver ran to this point, car picks him up. Here are your tracks ... probably took him to the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Not if we have these. </p>
<p>(WARRICK looks down at the tracks in the dirt.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: They're kind of out of place. A walking stride up to the edge.</p>
<p>(WARRICK takes a couple of photos.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No. This is a crime, not an accident.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You care to back that statement up? My phantom driver against your criminal?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: How much?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Fifty.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I don't get out of bed for less than a bill.</p>
<p>(NICK laughs and they shake on it.)</p>

<p>(He moves to the side and picks up a bag of bills and shows it to SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. Evans</strong>: Ready for mail. It's almost as if he wanted to take care of some unfinished business before he checked out.</p>
<p>(SARA takes the mail out of the bag and goes through the bills.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, it's not likely. His suicide was staged.</p>
<p>(She notices something.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. Evans</strong>: It's an upside-down stamp. What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I don't know.</p>
<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO:</p>

[INT. HOTEL MONACO - BATHROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(SARA uses the Red Creeper on the bathroom pipes.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (impressed) Wow. This stuff rocks. I love bathrooms. Last time I printed a hotel bathroom, I had over 1,000 prints.</p>
<p>(SARA continues to dust the tub. She finishes.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Okay ... close the doors and hit the lights, daddy-O.</p>
<p>(EVANS closes the bathroom doors and turns the lights off. SARA uses her ALS and can't believe her findings.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Not a single print. </p>
<p><strong>Det. Evans</strong>: He wiped it clean. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah. This guy's a real pro. Not only did he wipe it clean -- it's sterile.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mrs. Harmon, we believe that the person who did this to your son may have done it to someone else and we need your help.</p>
<p><strong>Paige Harmon</strong>: Well, what can I do?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We talked to the second victim's girlfriend -- played his suicide recording for her. She confirmed that it was his voice. </p>
<p><strong>Paige Harmon</strong>: But I already told you that the voice on that tape was not my son's.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I know. We just need to be absolutely certain. Do you have a recording of your son's voice so that we could tie the killings together?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Anything, Mrs. Harmon -- a home movie? A recorded message off your answering machine?</p>
<p><strong>Paige Harmon</strong>: All I have are pictures. </p>
<p>(She remembers something.)</p>
<p><strong>Paige Harmon</strong>: I may have something.</p>
<p>(She stands up and picks up a picture frame.)</p>
<p><strong>Paige Harmon</strong>: Royce gave this to me for mother's day last year. (GRISSOM stands up.) It's a talking frame. It's all I have left.</p>
<p><strong>Royce Harmon</strong>: Hey, mom, it's Royce. I know you're always complaining you don't hear my voice in the house anymore. Well, now you can listen to it anytime you want. I love you, mom.</p>

<p>(NICK sits down and exhales. WARRICK thinks about it and starts his own theory.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Banglor shooting stick -- I'll give you that. Burping bourbons --<br />
I'll give you that, too. But he left solo. A few miles down the road,<br />
(WARRICK stands up and starts pacing the room as he goes over his scenario, evidence by evidence.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: ... Bentley thief flags him down ... </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [WARRICK'S THEORY] The MOTORIST flags the car down. End of flashback Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: ... spooks him into a skid ... boom, crash! </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The car headlights. End of flashback Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: He's robbed ... forced into the back ... pushed over the edge. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The MOTORIST pushes the car over the edge of the hill. End of flashback Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: With Banglor out of the way, the thief gets in his stolen Bentley ... hightails it out of there. No watch ... no rings, no cash ... stolen Bentley tire treads, converse all-star size 11 ... all bases covered. Victim, suspect, crime scene. Like a canary ... it sings.</p>
<p>(Done, WARRICK tosses the ball to NICK. He catches it. WARRICK takes a seat.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You know, I hate to admit it ... but I like your theory. It does work.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I was sitting here thinking the same thing about your phantom driver.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So, what do you think? Can two solid theories, each backed by evidence both be correct?</p>
<p>(WARRICK shrugs. NICK tosses the football to WARRICK.)</p>

[INT. CSI - PHOTO LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Everyone watches the bank ATM machine security camera footage. On the monitor, a bum stands directly in front of the camera. A second person stands off to the side directing the bum. He hands the bum the card.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (o.s.) There. There's our guy ... handing it off.</p>
<p>(On screen, the man on the side hands the bum a stack of cue cards. The bum turns the cards one after the other in front of the camera.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Life ... like holding a dove.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hold it too hard ... </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: ... you kill it.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hold it too soft ... </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: ...and it'll fly away.</p>
<p>(The bum continues to flip the cards. Thinking that he's done, the bum turns to the side to walk away, but the man pushes him back in front of the camera to continue flipping the cards.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: :Have we located this bum?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Brass's guys are looking for him. Okay ... significance of the flipping?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: He's obviously making a point.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What does the dove symbolize? Peace.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: But I don't think it's peace in terms of ... human civility or unrest. I think maybe it's &quot;peace of mind.&quot; (beat) What do you have to attain to have peace of mind? (realizing) Justice.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: &quot;I'm going to keep doing this over and over again until I get Justice.&quot;</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO BLACK.</p>

[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(GRISSOM opens the interview room. Inside is the bum.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: How you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (looking at the bum) Hmm. How'd you find him?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We canvassed a square-mile radius of the ATM machine. Started throwing bums hamburgers out the car window in a nice tight spiral. They ratted him out in 20 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You want to tell him how you were approached?</p>
<p><strong>Bum</strong>: You know, I think better when I eat.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No kidding?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Jim, call the steak house at Circus. Get this fella a porterhouse. </p>
<p>(BRASS picks up the phone.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: How do you like it -- Medium rare? No, you look like a well-done kind of guy.</p>
<p><strong>Bum</strong>: Rare.</p>

<p>(The door opens. NICK and WARRICK walk into the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, hey. How are you feeling, Mr. Banglor?</p>
<p><strong>Walter Banglor</strong>: Uh, better, I guess. I understand last night was exciting, though.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah. </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I'm going to come right out and say it. What happened to you is not right. The person responsible needs to be brought to justice. You tell me who that person is. Who was driving that car?</p>
<p><strong>Walter Banglor</strong>: Who the hell are you guys?</p>
<p>(WARRICK and NICK both talk at the same time.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'm Warrick ... NICK: I'm Nick ...</p>
<p>(They stop and look at each other.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I'm Nick Stokes. This is Warrick Brown. We're with criminalistics. We've been working your accident.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Actually, sir, I-I don't think it was an accident. I think you were robbed and any information that you remember about your attacker would be very helpful.</p>
<p><strong>Walter Banglor</strong>: I wasn't attacked. </p>
<p>(At this, WARRICK'S face falls.)</p>
<p><strong>Walter Banglor</strong>: I was drunk .. really drunk. </p>
<p>(At this, NICK'S face falls.)</p>
<p><strong>Walter Banglor</strong>: No way I should've been driving that car.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [POOL BAR] WALTER BANGLOR looses another game and puts his pool stick down on the table. He sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Walter Banglor</strong>: Yeah! I guess that's enough for me.</p>
<p><strong>Pool Player</strong>: Then it's time to pay up.</p>
<p>(Cut to: WALTER BANGLOR looks into his wallet, then glances at the POOL PLAYER in front of him.)</p>
<p><strong>Walter Banglor</strong>: Looks like I'm a little short.</p>
<p>(He chuckles. The POOL PLAYER turns to the THUG behind him and motions to WALTER.)</p>
<p><strong>Pool Player</strong>: Hit him. Take everything he's got.</p>
<p>(The THUG hits WALTER in the stomach and in the face.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: WALTER BANGLOR is driving home. He's drinking as he's driving. He's not paying attention to the road and is startled awake when the truck headed toward him honks his horn.)</p>
<p><strong>Walter Banglor</strong>: Jeez!</p>
<p>(WALTER gets control over his car and swerves. He crashes through the railing and teeters on the edge of the cliff.)</p>
<p>(To balance the car, WALTER crawls into the back seat. He fastens himself in just as the car tilts over the edge. And like a wild park ride, the car rolls down the hillside.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You mean you got hustled?</p>
<p><strong>Walter Banglor</strong>: I won the first game.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (astonished) You climbed in the back seat yourself?</p>
<p><strong>Walter Banglor</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So buckling up ... really did save your life. You know that?</p>
<p><strong>Walter Banglor</strong>: Yeah, I guess it did.</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: And the Bentley thief, size 11-- he could've been at that crime scene anytime last week. So we push on the bet? No winner?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (agreed) No loser. </p>
<p>(NICK'S pager goes off. The wall clock reads 4:02. NICK checks his pager.)</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You still have it? </p>
<p>(The BUM doesn't answer.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How tall was this man? Was he ... shorter or taller than Mr. Brass here?</p>
<p>(BRASS stands up.)</p>
<p><strong>Bum</strong>: A hair taller.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: By a hair, do you mean the hair of a rabbit or the hair of grizzly bear?</p>
<p><strong>Bum</strong>: Somewhere in the middle.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Okay. Let's say he was five-ten. What else do you remember about this man?</p>
<p>(BRASS takes a seat.)</p>
<p><strong>Bum</strong>: He had a narrow chin. Uh ... his eyes were blue -- deep-sea blue, you know? Uh, jet-black hair uh, Spock-like ears pointed nose, bushy eyebrows. Sunken cheeks with a bad complexion, almost pock-faced. </p>
<p>(As he talks, GRISSOM puts it together.)</p>
<p><strong>Bum</strong>: Uh ... thin as a soda cracker and his clothes were wrinkled, like, uh, he slept in them. Oh ... and when he spoke, he spoke with a ...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (realizing) ... stutter.</p>
<p><strong>Bum</strong>: Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Latex rubber surface, freshly dried paint a snip of scotch tape - </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It wouldn't be that hard to lift and replant.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sara, we'll be on headsets. Run everything you can on Paul Millander. Use forenz-l use nexus, search anything and everything.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (from radio) I got something out of the newspaper index.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What is it?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (reading) &quot;Two hotel security guards exonerated in alleged 'staged' suicide. Boy's testimony shaky.

Official cause of death was ruled ...&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to radio) ... suicide. (from radio) Check the date.</p>

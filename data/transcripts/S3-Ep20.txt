<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p><strong>Emcee</strong>: (V.O.) Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for the Comedy Hole's very own Michael Borland.</p>
<p>(The audience applauds.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. COMEDY HOLE - STAGE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(MICHAEL BORLAND is on stage doing his act.)</p>
<p><strong>Michael Borland</strong>: Look, look, the Kennedys killed Marilyn Monroe. I'm pretty sure the gunman in the grassy knoll was either Arthur Miller or Joe DiMaggio. &quot;Bang my wife...?&quot;</p>
<p>(He imitates a gunshot. There's sparse laughter in the audience.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. ALLEYWAY OUTSIDE COMEDY HOLE - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(DOUGIE MAX is outside in the alley facing the wall behind the trash cans. It's obvious that he's busy doing something. He's murmuring to himself, rehearsing for his act.)</p>
<p><strong>Dougie Max</strong>: (sotto voce) &quot;Hey, if you'd have me, I'd ask you to marry hell, somebody's got to clean my apartment.&quot;</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. COMEDY HOLE - STAGE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p><strong>Michael Borland</strong>: Hey, how many of you people know the theme to Gilligan's Island?</p>
<p>(The audience applauds.)</p>
<p><strong>Michael Borland</strong>: All right. Now, how many of you can recite the Bill of Rights?</p>
<p>(The audience doesn't respond, unsure of the connection between the two.)</p>
<p><strong>Michael Borland</strong>: That's-that's-that's ... who cares? It's really not that important. We don't use it anymore.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. ALLEYWAY OUTSIDE COMEDY HOLE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(DOUGIE MAX is facing the wall and mumbling to himself, still going through his act. He laughs.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. COMEDY HOLE - STAGE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p><strong>Michael Borland</strong>: I hear a lot of folks saying, &quot;you know, if it wasn't for the us, the, uh, French would be speaking German.&quot;</p>
<p>(There's mild applause from the audience.)</p>
<p><strong>Michael Borland</strong>: Yeah, well, if it, if it wasn't for the French, you'd be speaking Cherokee.</p>
<p>(The audience doesn't applaud. He's lost them.)</p>
<p><strong>Michael Borland</strong>: Oh, I'm sorry. Did I hurt your brains?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. ALLEYWAY OUTSIDE COMEDY HOLE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(DOUGIE MAX finishes up his rehearsal.)</p>
<p><strong>Dougie Max</strong>: (sotto voce) &quot;That's my time, everybody. Tip for the night: If you don't know what you're doing, don't do it harder. Good night, everybody!&quot;</p>
<p>(DOUGIE MAX laughs hysterically at his own joke. He looks down.)</p>
<p><strong>Dougie Max</strong>: Zip me up.</p>
<p>(He sighs and a loud zipper sound is heard. The WAITRESS rises between DOUGIE and the wall.)</p>
<p><strong>Waitress</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>Dougie Max</strong>: Yeah. Laugh.</p>
<p>(DOUGIE steps backward and opens the door back into the Comedy Hole.)</p>
<p><strong>Michael Borland</strong>: (V.O.) It recently came out that Jesus could've had siblings.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. COMEDY HOLE -- BACK HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(DOUGIE MAX bursts in through the back hallway and starts waving to the people as he makes his way to the main room.)</p>
<p><strong>Michael Borland</strong>: (V.O.) Could you imagine growing up having Jesus in your family? &quot;Why can't you be more like your brother?&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Dougie Max</strong>: (to the man) What's up, Dude?</p>
<p><strong>Michael Borland</strong>: (V.O.) &quot;Uh, 'cause he's the Messiah. He's the Son of God.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Dougie Max</strong>: (to the woman) Hi, Lis. All right!</p>
<p><strong>Michael Borland</strong>: &quot;When your brother's home, we always have wine.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Alan</strong>: (to DOUGIE MAX) Caught your act on the tube last night. You knocked them out. I had to turn up the volume, I was laughing so loud.</p>
<p><strong>Dougie Max</strong>: This art exhibit get any laughs?</p>
<p><strong>Alan</strong>: Hey, come on, you're my only headliner, you know that.</p>
<p>(MICHAEL sees DOUGIE head for the stage and he wraps it up.)</p>
<p><strong>Michael Borland</strong>: Well, I'm Michael Borland, and that's my time ... </p>
<p>(The audience doesn't applaud.)</p>
<p><strong>Michael Borland</strong>: ...and that's your silence. All right, now, ladies and gentlemen, let me introduce you to the headliner this evening ...</p>
<p>(The audience comes alive and starts to cheer. Rock music starts playing in the background.)</p>
<p><strong>Michael Borland</strong>: ... a man I'm sure you know from his hit TV show, &quot;Dougie to the Max&quot;, Mr. Dougie Max!</p>
<p>(The audience cheers. DOUGIE MAX makes his way to the stage from the back of the audience. He shakes people's hands as he passes them by. MICHAEL BORLAND puts the mike back on the stand and applauds, too. DOUGIE MAX stands up on stage and gives MICHAEL BORLAND a hug.)</p>
<p><strong>Michael Borland</strong>: Hey, man ... </p>
<p><strong>Dougie Max</strong>: (to MICHAEL BORLAND) Remember when I used to open for you?</p>
<p>(The rock music continues to play. The audience is ready for him. He takes a bottled water from the side and drinks.)</p>
<p><strong>Dougie Max</strong>: What's up, Vegas?!</p>
<p>(He looks around the audience and spits out the water at them. He drops the water bottle.)</p>
<p>(The audience continues to cheer and applaud.)</p>
<p><strong>Dougie Max</strong>: Hey, kid, it's a cruel world!</p>
<p>(The audience cheers and applauds. He tosses and twists the mike. He catches it.)</p>
<p><strong>Dougie Max</strong>: Ain't it great?! Bam!</p>
<p>FLASH TO WHITE:</p>
<hr />
[INT. COMEDY HOLE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(BRASS leads CATHERINE and GRISSOM through the hallway to the main room where the body is.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Welcome to the tragedy hall. Hey, you hear the one about the comedian who died onstage? (beat) Literally.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Buh-du-bum.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'll be here all week.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Maybe he slipped on a banana peel.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Buh-du-bum.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Crowd thought it was part of his act ... till he didn't get up.</p>
<p>(They finally reach the stage where DOUGIE MAX is.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hi, David.</p>
<p><strong>David</strong>: Hey, Catherine.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE kneels down next to the body and visually examines it.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, there's no foam on the mouth. No discoloration around the lips. Pupils aren't dilated. No overt evidence of a drug overdose.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: When was the last time a comedian died of natural causes?</p>
<p><strong>David</strong>: Clenched fist ... classic levine sign. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He's awfully young for a heart attack.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks around CATHERINE and toward the center of the stage.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, live fast, die young ... I forget the rest.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (shouts out to the back of the room) Excuse me! Could someone turn down the house lights, and turn up the stage lights? Thank you.</p>
<p>(The house lights turn down. The stage lights turn up.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I want to see what he saw ... right before he died.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What do you see?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What are you looking for?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: A punchline?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Buh-du-bum.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<hr />
[INT. COMEDY HOLE - MAIN ROOM -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The coroner's office wheels the body through the room past the various performers. THE COMEDIAN - [played by GILBERT GOTTFRIED] -- watches the gurney as it passes by him. MICHAEL BORLAND sits at the bar nursing his drink.)</p>
<p>[GILBERT GOTTFRIED]: See, here's a switch. They've got him rolling in the aisles. Well, I guess he's off to a better place.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Borland</strong>: (mutters) Any place would be better than this dump.</p>
<p><strong>Alan</strong>: (offended) Hey, hey, hey!</p>
<p><strong>Michael Borland</strong>: Sorry, Alan. I didn't see you.</p>
<p><strong>Alan</strong>: At least Dougie put laughter in the air and asses in the seats and drinks on the tab. (to BRASS) I loved that guy. Took me fifteen years to find the next Kinison, and the minute I do, he gets a sitcom. Now I have to pay him a king's ransom to come back here once a year, and this is where he started.<br />
(laughs) Figures the b*st*rd would die on me. You know, I-I should put up a sign, you know, like in Dealey Plaza, &quot;Kennedy shot here,&quot; &quot;Dougie Dropped here.&quot;</p>
<p>(THE BARTENDER approaches ALAN.)</p>
<p><strong>Bartender</strong>: Hey, Alan, you got a spot open now. What do you say tomorrow you give me some time?</p>
<p><strong>Alan</strong>: You got a job. You want to keep it? </p>
<p>(THE BARTENDER turns away.)</p>
<p><strong>Alan</strong>: (to BRASS) Dougie was a hack with hack material who caught a break and never let anybody forget it. Oh, you want suspects? (He turns around and points to the wall of pictures behind him.) Here, check out the wall. Any one of these guys'd kill to have his stage.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. COMEDY HOLE - GREEN ROOM -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The door opens and CATHERINE walks into the green room. She starts looking around. On the counter is a coffee grinder and various other drinking rubbish littering the countertop. )</p>
<p>(CATHERINE kneels down and checks out the food platter on the table. The card reads: DOUGIE MAX. She picks up a toothpick with a chunk of Spam (c) on it and smells it. She puts it down.)</p>
<p>(On the table below under the food platter, she finds remnants of white powder. She checks it out.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, china ...</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. COMEDY HOLE - CENTER STAGE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM kneels next to the stool with the bottles of water on it. GRISSOM has to collect the water and the bottles. BRASS stands in front of him watching.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Six bottles of Innoko water. Three partially filled, three unopened.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Don't go Cousteau on me here. It was all part of his shtick. He was like Tarkanian with the towel. You know, always biting and pacing. Dougie's mantra was, &quot;It's a cruel world. Ain't it great?&quot; (GRISSOM doesn't say anything.) Uh, it was low-brow. Strictly chug-and-belch.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Laughter is an involuntary motor response triggered by survival issues: Food, s*x, body functions ... death.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, it's a cruel world.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. COMEDY HOLE - HALLWAY TO THE MAIN ROOM -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE questions ALAN, the club owner.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, who has access to the green room?</p>
<p><strong>Alan</strong>: Well, according to who? According to me, just the talent. According to these meat sticks -- the world.</p>
<p>(ALAN and CATHERINE reach the main room where the performers are.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: All right. I would like to see everyone's wallet. I don't need to see your identification. Just open your wallets.</p>
<p>(MICHAEL BORLAND gives CATHERINE his wallet. She looks at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Michael Borland</strong>: Uh, it says I'm 180 pounds, but I'm 145. I know that, in Nevada law, if there's a 25-pound discrepancy, that ... that's actually against the law.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE hands his wallet back to him.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to MICHAEL BORLAND) Thank you.</p>
<p>(She looks at THE BARTENDER'S wallet, then hands it back to him.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>The Bartender</strong>: You're welcome.</p>
<p>[GILBERT GOTTFRIED]: (points to something in his wallet) In this one I'm wearing a thong.</p>
<p>(THE BARTENDER laughs at the joke.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: That's more than I needed to know. Thank you.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE hands his wallet back to him. She looks at the WAITRESS' wallet. She finds the white power on the edge of the credit card.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [BOTTOM CAMERA ANGLE UPWARD UNDER THE GLASS TABLE TOP]<br />
THE WAITRESS is cutting the cocaine on the table using her credit card. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: When was the last time you used this credit card?</p>
<p><strong>Waitress</strong>: What?</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. COMEDY HOLE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The doors open. BRASS and an OFFICER escort the WAITRESS out of the building. The WAITRESS is in handcuffs. In the background, the sound of a car revving its engine can be heard.)</p>
<p>(They put the WAITRESS into the police car.)</p>
<p>(BRASS looks and sees someone he recognizes, GEORGE STARK. GEORGE STARK exits his brand new red Ferrari, which is parked across the street. BRASS stands there and watches as GEORGE STARK hands the keys to the valet, then escorts the beautiful blonde woman into the restaurant.)</p>
<p>(BRASS doesn't look thrilled to see that. In fact, he looks very thoughtful.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY]</p>
<p>(ROBBINS goes over the body findings with GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: C.O.D.?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Myocardial necrosis. Just what you'd expect from a heart attack, only I didn't find any blockages consistent with coronary disease. He was remarkably healthy for a dead guy.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, Dougie Max had more than comedy in his blood. Tox came back positive for coke.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: The answer is ... the three main ways to take cocaine.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM sighs and turns to look at ROBBINS.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: All right, &quot;Alex&quot;. What is: Snorting it, smoking it, or injecting it?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Very good. The answer is normal nasal passages, clear lungs, and no track marks on the body.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Continuing this childish metaphor ... what is: How did the drugs get into his system?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: We'll have to wait for Final Jeopardy.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM sighs dramatically, shakes his head and turns to leave the room. ROBBINS continues to polish his cutting tools.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE interviews the WAITRESS in the presence of the WAITRESS' LAWYER.)</p>
<p><strong>Lawyer</strong>: My client has agreed to plead to possession and answer any questions. Nothing she tells you can be interpreted as criminal intent ...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, that's between you and the D.A. The preliminary tox screen on Dougie Max came back positive for cocaine.</p>
<p><strong>Waitress</strong>: Dougie was in a program, okay? It was my cocaine. He wasn't using.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It was in his blood.</p>
<p><strong>Waitress</strong>: Well ... Dougie always liked to do a little hum-and-coke before a show.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: During MICHAEL BORLAND'S show, DOUGIE MAX and the WAITRESS go outside. DOUGIE drops his pants, the WAITRESS kneels down in front of him. She puts a little bit of coke on her fingernail. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Cocaine on the foreskin, or any skin, for that matter, is not a stimulant; it's a numbing agent.</p>
<p><strong>Waitress</strong>: Right. That was the idea. You see, the goal wasn't to pop the cork. It was to ... shake the bottle.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Sounds frustrating.</p>
<p><strong>Waitress</strong>: Dougie liked to go out on stage frustrated.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: DOUGIE is on stage and fired up to do this act.)</p>
<p><strong>Dougie Max</strong>: (loudly and into the act) I ran away from home at age 25. I drank... and I whored ...</p>
<p>(The audience cheers.)</p>
<p><strong>Dougie Max</strong>: ... and I got my own show!</p>
<p>(The cheers get louder.)</p>
<p><strong>Dougie Max</strong>: Yeah, Dougie to the Max, bee-yatch!</p>
<p>(The audience roars with him.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Waitress</strong>: Gave him an edge. That was Dougie's philosophy: Go in hot ... burn the place down.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - LOUNGE ]</p>
<p>(NICK is pouring himself a cup of coffee. BRASS walks in carrying a file folder.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, you're making coffee. Good. I could use some.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: How do you take it?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Today, high-octane black. I need your help with something.</p>
<p>(NICK hands BRASS a cup. NICK takes a seat at the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Shoot.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: A few weeks ago, homicide gets called to Green Valley. A woman in her<br />
40s slips in the bathtub and drowns. You know, cracked skull, raccooned eyes --<br />
I mean, a traumatic death, but nothing suspicious. </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: CSI found what?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I didn't call them in. I ruled it an accident.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What changed?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Last night I saw the husband out on the town. I mean, I could tell you something, Nick. Three weeks ago, this guy was devastated.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: BRASS interviews GEORGE STARK in the bathroom. GEORGE STARK is sitting hunched over on the tub edge. BRASS listens to him.)</p>
<p><strong>George Stark</strong>: (sobbing) I should've been here. What am I going to do? I mean, she was my life.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Onward and upward.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No, but this is way upward. I mean, trades in his beat-up old Acura for a brand-new Ferrari. He's with a girl who gives more lift-off than-than Cape Canaveral.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (chuckles) People grieve in different ways, man.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, we've got two bottles of poisoned Innoko water -- one from a comedy club on western, the other from a convenience store halfway across town.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: What's the connection?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: There may not be one; it could just be random.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: So, how are we going to get this guy?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You know, they never caught the guy who put the cyanide in the Tylenol back in the '80s. They found out how the bottles were tampered with. That's where safety seals came from.</p>

Stop with the lies. Comedy, uh, comedy's supposed to be about The Truth. You know, uh, I killed tonight. And, uh, I killed ... uh ... two nights ago .... Dougie Max ... uh ... on this stage. </p>
<p>(Camera cuts to: GRISSOM -- grim -- in the back of the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Michael Borland</strong>: 'Cause I despised everything he stood for. Dumb people, like you. </p>
<p>(MICHAEL steps down from the stage and slowly makes his way to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Michael Borland</strong>: You think I did a disservice to the world by killing Dougie Max? You ought to give me a parade. But the shame of it is, is that, uh, an innocent kid got killed, too, and, uh ... I blame you.</p>
<p>(MICHAEL BORLAND points the mike to GRISSOM. GRISSOM doesn't crack a smile.)</p>
<p><strong>Michael Borland</strong>: Yeah, I, uh ... I didn't think you were going to get the joke.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Oh, I got it. (beat) It just wasn't funny.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM grabs the mike away from MICHAEL'S hand. The officers put him in hand cuffs. Camera holds on GRISSOM.)</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>
<p><strong>End</strong></p>

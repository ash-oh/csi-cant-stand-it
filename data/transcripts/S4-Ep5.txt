<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS ROADWAY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[INT. CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(LINDA JONES is driving her car. As she drives, she glances left and right as if looking for something. Her car hits something with a thud. She slams on the breaks and slows the car down a little. Rather than stopping to check it out, LINDA continues to drive as she tries to look behind at what she might have hit.)</p>
<p>(When she turns back to the road, she finds that she's headed straight for a truck. The trunk honks his horn at her.)</p>
<p>(She screams.)</p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO:</p>
<p>[EXT. ROADWAY - NIGHT - LATER]</p>
<p>(The TRUCK DRIVER talks with the OFFICER.)</p>
<p><strong>Truck Driver</strong>: You can breathalize me all you want, but the broad came right at me. I swear, it wasn't my fault.</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: (o.s.) Sir, I understand.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and CATHERINE approach the mangled car.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Ooh, that's what happens when 6,000 pounds of thrust meets three feet of hood.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This was not a fair fight.</p>
<p>(They look into the car at the body behind the wheel. CATHERINE looks at the road.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, now, how did she end up way over here? </p>
<p>(She sees the skid marks on the road.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: There must be 20 feet of rubber burned into this asphalt. She was braking hard.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: She definitely swerved out of her lane. I think I may know why.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM finds the paw prints on the road. CATHERINE looks at the paw prints.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh. What kind of animal are we talking about here?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: A big one.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The victim could have clipped the animal when it ran in front of her. </p>
<p>(They continue to look down the road.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, it can't have gone far.</p>
<p>(They both follow the paw prints to the side of the road. Just at the bottom of the hill, they find the body of a man in a Raccoon suit. GRISSOM stares at the suit.)</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. ROADSIDE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(CATHERINE reaches out and removes the mask from the body. Inside the suit is a man. CATHERINE looks inside the mask.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hmm. Ooh. Not much padding.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at the mask.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Whoa. This is incredibly detailed. Eyelashes, nostrils ...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, yeah. That's what you see out of. I once dated the Detroit Lions Mascot. Off-season. Dutch was his name.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The breadth of your social experience never ceases to impress me.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE smiles. GRISSOM takes photos of the body.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE takes something out of the mouth of the mask. It's a piece of blue-colored yarn.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Dutch never had furballs, though.</p>
<p>(She puts it in a bag.)</p>
<p>(DAVID PHILLIPS grabs his clipboard and walks over to the body. He stares down at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Are you all right, David?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: It's just ... disturbing. There was a big raccoon who hosted an after-school kids show when I was little. (smiles fondly at the memory)<br />
Stripey. Everybody loved him. I loved him. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: &quot;Stripey's&quot; brother suffered blunt force trauma caused by a violent collision with a moving vehicle.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [ROAD-NIGHT] The man in the raccoon suit is standing on the road waving a car down. The car heads straight for the man and hits him. He flies to the side of the road on impact. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(DAVID PHILLIPS gets to work.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: DAVID pushes the body up the hillside on a gurney toward the coroner's van.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The eternal question: Why did the man in the raccoon suit cross the road?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM glances sideways at CATHERINE.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - EVENING]</p>
<p>[INT. BIG &amp; BEST WAREHOUSE -- FREEZER -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(There's a man dead on the floor of a freezer. NICK and SARA stand over the body looking down at him.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Frozen stiff.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Looks like he died trying to get out. Trying to get to the door, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: It got messy. Check out the shotgun spatter.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Single blast. Went in, went out. Ooh. This has got to be the coldest place in Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Let's go. Vega's got the security guard.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah, he's not going anywhere.</p>
<p>(SARA and NICK stand up and leave the freezer.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. BIG &amp; BEST WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(NICK and SARA step outside to join DET. SAM VEGA interviewing the Security Guard PETEY.) </p>
<p><strong>Sam Vega</strong>: So, Peter, when you checked in at eight ...</p>
<p><strong>Security Guard Petey</strong>: (protests) Not Peter. Petey. P-E-T-E-Y.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, how you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Security Guard Petey</strong>: Good.</p>
<p>(NICK walks over to the vending machine.)</p>
<p><strong>Sam Vega</strong>: The shooter may have cleaned out the machines.</p>
<p><strong>Security Guard Petey</strong>: Those things hold a lot of dough.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Vega</strong>: Take was maybe, uh, $600.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: They shot a guy over a vending machine?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So, uh, Petey, where were you when all this went down?</p>
<p><strong>Security Guard Petey</strong>: I was in the guard shack. Where else would I be?</p>
<p><strong>Sam Vega</strong>: You tell us.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: If a guy walks into a freezer, shoots a guy and smashes six vending machines, I think I'd hear that.</p>
<p><strong>Security Guard Petey</strong>: The shack's out there.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You don't make rounds?</p>
<p><strong>Security Guard Petey</strong>: Look, I'm not supposed to leave the premises, okay?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay, but if you were here, you're a suspect. Come on, man. Middle of the shift, you're getting hungry. You figure, hey, I'll deck out and grab a bite to eat. Who's going to know, right?</p>
<p><strong>Security Guard Petey</strong>: I was gone five minutes, tops.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: When?</p>
<p><strong>Security Guard Petey</strong>: A little after 11:00. Grabbed a burger and came back.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What kind of burger?</p>
<p><strong>Security Guard Petey</strong>: In 'n' Out -- three blocks from here.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I love In 'n' Out. I always get the In 'n' Out double, animal style.</p>
<p><strong>Security Guard Petey</strong>: That's what I get.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You grill the onions?</p>
<p><strong>Security Guard Petey</strong>: Hell, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Now, that is crazy, Petey, 'cause you know, being an In 'n' Out kind of guy, I know it takes at least five minutes to grill the onions alone.</p>
<p><strong>Security Guard Petey</strong>: Come on, man.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: That time of night, you're lucky if you don't wait 20 minutes just to get to the window.</p>
<p><strong>Security Guard Petey</strong>: Look, my boss finds out I'm leaving the site every night to get my burger on, I'm toast.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Vega</strong>: You keep lying to us, you're going to be toast in a jumpsuit.</p>
<p><strong>Security Guard Petey</strong>: Around 11:00, this cat George -- he usually works days -- drives up and asks me where Al is.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Al Sesto? The guy in the freezer?</p>
<p><strong>Security Guard Petey</strong>: I told him he was back here. I came back. Everything was quiet. So I ate my dinner in my shack.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Vega</strong>: Where'd George go?</p>
<p><strong>Security Guard Petey</strong>: Beats me. His car's still in the parking lot.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Vega</strong>: You want to show me which one?</p>
<p><strong>Security Guard Petey</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p>(DET. VEGA and SECURITY GUARD PETEY leave. SARA takes a step toward NICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Unless he was slick, the guy that did this definitely left behind a print, and, frankly, nothing about this looks slick.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY TO FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(DAVID PHILLIPS escorts CATHERINE and GRISSOM to forensic autopsy.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Linda Jones, 35, single. We're trying to track down the next-of-kin. No mystery in cause of death, though.</p>
<p>(DAVID opens the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Your basic massive internal trauma.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: And then some.</p>
<p>(They walk into the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Anything unusual about our furry friend?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: We're about to find out.</p>
<p>(They walk into forensic autopsy. GRISSOM grabs a pair of gloves and puts them on.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did you know that raccoons have opposable thumbs?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, this one liked to wrap his around a bottle. &quot;30 days: One day at a time.&quot; He was a friend of Bill W.'S. </p>
<p>(She shows them the 30 days tag.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: I'll send the blood work down to tox.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks at the stitching in the suit.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (admiring) Oh, my -- hand stitching.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Lining looks like some kind of latex.</p>
<p>(DAVID starts to cut through the suit. He hits the bottom and blood spills out onto the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Whoa. That's a lot of blood for blunt force trauma.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: This isn't a costume. It's a six-foot condom. Explains why there was no blood on the road.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, his tailor didn't think of everything. His suit's not bulletproof.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE thinks about that one.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Shall we?</p>
<p>(They all help to flip the Raccoon over. CATHERINE opens the velcro and they find the bullet wound on his back.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Through and through.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: It's a high-velocity round. Gives the bullet a smooth entry in and out.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, he was shot and hit by a car.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Bad night.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Even for a raccoon.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. BIG &amp; BEST WAREHOUSE -- FREEZER -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(ROBBINS is standing over the body) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: The last time this happened they tried to chop the guy out. 1989-- year The Mirage opened.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: How'd it go?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Lost an arm and a leg. I miss the cold weather.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So, what are we going to use, hot water?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Boiling works best. Just, uh, spread it around the perimeter. Melt the ice.</p>
<p><strong>Coroner's Assistant</strong>: Guys, let's do it here.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: To preserve the body?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: That's right. Close as you can.</p>
<p>(They pour the hot water over the frozen blood.)</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV of the heat working on melting the blood. White flash to end of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong>: And up.</p>
<p>(They lift the body onto the gurney and wrap the blanket around it.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: All right, guys, let's go.</p>
<p>(The CORONERS' ASSISTANTS wheel the body out of the freezer.)</p>
<p>(Once they're gone, NICK looks at the blood spatter on the boxes and takes a sample of the pellet.)</p>
<p>(He extracts more pellets from the freezer.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: SARA dusts for prints on the vending machine glass.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: NICK looks at the blood on the ground. He moves over to the side and picks up a piece of something black and puts it in a bindle.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - LAB] </p>
<p>(CATHERINE enters the lab. WARRICK is looking through a scope.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hi, Warrick.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Anything on Mr. Raccoon?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah. I got an AFIS hit. Robert Pitt. Court-ordered to AA after a DUI.</p>
<p>(He points to the print out on the counter next to him. CATHERINE picks it up. WARRICK goes back to the scope.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, that's where he got the 30-day chip. Maybe he fell off the wagon after he hit 31.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: If I had to walk around dressed like Rocky Raccoon, I'd be drinking, too. I don't get this whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, hey, Warrick, it's Vegas. People come here to be animals.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I hear you. Take a look at this.</p>
<p>(He steps aside and lets her look through the scope.)</p>
<p>[SCOPE VIEW of the blue fur.]</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, yes, the blue fur ball.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, it's synthetic, not natural.</p>
<p>(GREG enters the lab.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Your manimal died sober. No alcohol.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: All this schmohawk had in his system was trace amounts of ipecac and civet oil, which, if you ask me, is even weirder than the raccoon suit he was wearing.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, ipecac's an emetic. I once gave it to Lindsey when she swallowed mothballs, but civet oil?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE shakes her head.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yeah. Civet's a wild cat. Its scent has been prized since the pharaohs for being an aphrodisiac.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS COMMUNITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. ROBERT PITT'S RESIDENCE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(The door opens; BRASS walks into the room. CATHERINE and an OFFICER follow.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Pitt was a computer programmer. No next-of-kin.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Ooh.</p>
<p>(They look around the place.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Not an architectural digest reader.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks in the bedroom.)</p>
<p>[BEDROOM]</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: If you want to know what the man really is all about, check out his bedroom.</p>
<p>(On ROBERT PITT'S bed is a stack of stuffed animals.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Now, this scares me.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: A man lives alone. Has no relatives. No attachments. So, he forms his own furry little family.</p>
<p>(BRASS looks at the calendar on the wall and notes the red circled dates from October 29, 2003 through November 1, 2003 for the &quot;PAF CON&quot; at the &quot;KINGS RIVER HOTEL&quot;.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: &quot;PAF con meeting.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What's PAF con?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I don't know, but whatever it is, it's still going on.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks at BRASS.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Minus one raccoon.</p>
<p>FADE OUT</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[INT. KING'S RIVER HOTEL -- LOBBY] </p>
<p>(It's the Plushies &amp; Furries PAF CON going on in the lobby. CATHERINE and GRISSOM walk into the lobby.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: PAF con?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The Plushies and Furries convention. And we're looking for a bright blue Plushie ... I think.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and CATHERINE stare at the group of people dressed in costume. GRISSOM look fascinated by the sight; CATHERINE looks perplexed.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This is fascinating. A whole tribe of people who prefer to interact as furry animals rather than human beings.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I think I'm having Hunter Thompson's flashbacks. This is weirding me out.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's not that weird. It's instinctual. Many native American tribes wore entire bearskins, including the bead, when they performed their war dances. They thought it made them brave.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm not getting the brave thing.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, think of stuffed animals as a Jungian archetype. What's the one quality they possess that a man like Bob Pitt might want?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: A full head of hair?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: They're lovable. We better divide and mingle.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM glances down at the schedule on the board:<br />

[INT. CSI - HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(RICH leads SARA and NICK back to the BALLISTICS LAB.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Uh, why did you page us?</p>
<p><strong>Rich</strong>: Your wood sample from the freezer.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: The one we gave Hodges?</p>
<p><strong>Rich</strong>: Yeah. He bounced it back to me.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'm lost.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What is normal s*x?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Uh, you think it's natural for a grown human to only be intimate with a talking animal?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, Freud said that the only unnatural sexual behavior was to have none at all. And after that, it's just a question of opportunity and preference. And evidently, many prefer the feel of fur to the texture of human skin.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Is this a, uh, general observation, or possibly a personal grievance?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Lee</strong>: At last year's convention, Rocky stole my girlfriend. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And in the wild, wolves are monogamous, but raccoons are promiscuous.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Lee</strong>: That's right. And I just, I knew, I knew since Sexy Kitty was Rocky's fave, he'd have his filthy raccoon mouth all over her again this year. All I wanted to do was make him sick enough so that he'd have to go home and stop cheating on my mate.</p>

<p>(CATHERINE starts looking for something in the back car seat.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Which begs the question: Why did she turn the car around and head back toward the hotel?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, she wasn't heading back to the hotel. She was heading back for him. 'Cause that's how car-fights always end. After about a mile or two, you start to feel guilty that you've abandoned the person, and you turn around. Except she didn't plan on an 18-wheeler finishing her off.</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Terra-cotta's the giveaway. It's a granite glue.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Granite glue?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah. It's used for adhering joints on big pieces of stone. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: House paint on his car; granite glue on his gun...</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, he used what was available. That's what people do.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, I understand the house paint, but where do you get granite glue?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I already checked. There's not too many places in clark county that specialize in granite installation, so...</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Okay, I will bet you a double-double animal style that one of them employs a guy with a blue 1984 monte carlo.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: That's a bet.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Excellent.</p>
<p>(NICK laughs, then follows SARA off camera frame.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[EXT. HOTEL FRONT -- DAY] </p>
<p>(GRISSOM and CATHERINE talk with the VALET. The VALET looks at the photo.) </p>
<p><strong>Valet</strong>: Damn straight I remember them. How often do you see a six-foot raccoon heaving out a car window? Dude was hammered, man. His girl... she was pissed.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Thank you. You've been very helpful.</p>
<p><strong>Valet</strong>: All right, no problem. Hey, I got that.</p>
<p>(The VALET returns to work.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, there's your car-fight. Now she thinks that he's back on the booze, which he denies, but the sicker he gets, the more she this he's lying.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: ROBERT PITT is getting sick. LINDA JONES is just plain angry. The two get into the car.)</p>
<p><strong>Linda Jones</strong>: I can't believe you're drinking again. You promised.</p>
<p><strong>Robert Pitt</strong>: I was not drinking. </p>
<p>(He closes the car door.)</p>
<p><strong>Robert Pitt</strong>: Must be food poisoning.</p>
<p><strong>Linda Jones</strong>: (scoffs) Oh? Didn't know they served food in a furpile.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The righteously angry versus the wrongly accused.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And the battle's just beginning.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [INT. CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT] They continue to argue. ROBERT PITT continues to get sick.)</p>
<p><strong>Linda Jones</strong>: Would you just take off the mask and talk to me?!</p>
<p><strong>Robert Pitt</strong>: No, just pull over and let me out of the car!</p>
<p><strong>Linda Jones</strong>: You want out?</p>
<p><strong>Robert Pitt</strong>: Ah ...</p>
<p>(She stops the car.)</p>
<p><strong>Linda Jones</strong>: Get out! Just get out!</p>
<p>(ROBERT PITT stumbles out of the car.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay, so it makes sense up to that point, but then what? He gets out and ... she shoots him?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm not so sure that people who dress up like cuddly forest creatures carry guns.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You don't think they allow plushies in the NRA? All right, then who shot him?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, we have a grassy knoll ... but no Lee Harvey Oswald.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(SARA, NICK and SAM VEGA interview VIRGIL.) </p>
<p><strong>Sam Vega</strong>: You're a triple threat -- robbery, kidnapping, murder. Big &amp; best foods, Al Sesto, George Bartell. Any of this resonate?</p>
<p><strong>Virgil</strong>: I don't know no al sesto.</p>
<p>(NICK puts photos of the shotgun on the table in front of VIRGIL.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Virgil, is that UR shotgun? We found it in your garage. If, uh, you look, you'll see a chip in the stock. We found that in the freezer at the Big &amp;<br />
Best foods.</p>
<p>(VIRGIL chuckles.)</p>
<p>(NICK puts a photo of the car on the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Is this your car? It was also in your garage. It has dual-layered paint, identical to the dual-layered paint chips we found on your kidnap victim.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Vega</strong>: Anything to say, tough guy?</p>
<p><strong>Virgil</strong>: Yeah. I want a lawyer.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. ROADSIDE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Various cuts of CATHERINE and GRISSOM looking for the bullet that killed ROBERT PITT.) </p>
<p>(CATHERINE'S metal detector beeps. She kneels down and finds the bullet.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, Grissom. Over here. I found the bullet.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks across the street and kneels down to look at the bullet.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well done. So, we got a sick raccoon with an abdominal through-and-through who was shot from what appears to be a fairly steep trajectory.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, either he was shot by a giant ... or he was, uh, on all fours.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [SITE VIEW] of Rocky Raccoon on his hands and knees. A gunshot rings out and hits the dirt. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Or both. I mean, imagine looked like out here at night and from a distance.</p>
<p>(They stand up.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We've been looking for ... a person who shot a person, but ... maybe we should be looking for a person who shot an animal.</p>
<p>(As they look up the road, they see a red truck drive by.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(As they walk VIRGIL out into the hallway, GEORGE BARTELL walks into the police department.) </p>
<p><strong>George</strong>: Hey, Virgil. What are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>Virgil</strong>: What am i doing here?</p>
<p><strong>George</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Vega</strong>: Why, you guys know each other?</p>
<p><strong>George</strong>: Yeah, that's my cousin.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Vega</strong>: Pahrump?</p>
<p><strong>Virgil</strong>: My own blood, and you set me up. After I saved your ass. I should have shot you in that freezer. You son of a bitch!</p>
<p>(He lunges for GEORGE. SAM VEGA holds him back.</p>
<p><strong>Sam Vega</strong>: Hey, hey! You looking for more time? Now come on.</p>
<p>(They leave.)</p>
<p>(NICK sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>George Bartell</strong>: (shakes his head) Oh, man. I'm so stupid.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Ah, you're not stupid. Man, your cousin just set you up.</p>
<p><strong>George Bartell</strong>: Bowling night.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Is that where you told him about the vending machines?</p>
<p>(GEORGE nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: And Petey's burger runs?</p>
<p><strong>George Bartell</strong>: My own cousin.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well ... George, sometimes people, they, uh, disappoint us.</p>
<p><strong>George Bartell</strong>: Why?</p>
<p>(NICK stares at GEORGE. SARA, at a loss of even trying to answer that question, shakes her head and looks expectantly at NICK.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Dogs bark in the distance. GRISSOM and CATHERINE are at the home of the man with the red truck.) </p>
<p><strong>Ranger</strong>: How you doing? Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We're with the Las Vegas crime lab. This your place?</p>
<p><strong>Ranger</strong>: Yeah. Must be here about that accident. Terrible thing. Like I said to the wife, the way these 18-wheelers fly down here ballin' the Jack, I ain't surprised. I'm surprised there ain't more accidents.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Why don't you give us a brief history of your evening?</p>
<p><strong>Ranger</strong>: Ah, well, I had dinner with the missus. Uh, fed the scraps to the dogs. Watched Jeopardy. Could hardly hear it, the dogs were, uh, so stirred up. Went outside to take a look, spotted a coyote. This is my business. Purebreds. Wouldn't want to lose one. So, I, uh, took care of it. Came back inside in time for Final Jeopardy.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - OFFICE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(GRISSOM and CATHERINE fill BRASS in.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So the raccoon was mistaken for a coyote. You gotta be kidding me.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: He was dosed intentionally but killed accidentally.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We got the Ranger's rifle, we collected a bullet at the scene, and ballistics made a match.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Bob Pitt was sick when he got out of the car, wounded when he got onto the road, and dead when he hit the dirt.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: ROBERT PITT gets out of the car and slams the door shut.)</p>
<p><strong>Linda Jones</strong>: Get out! Just get out!</p>
<p>(Cut to: Still in his costume, he throws up on the side of the road.)</p>
<p>(High above, the Ranger takes aim and shoots at the &quot;coyote&quot;. He fires.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: LINDA JONES turns the car around to pick ROBERT PITT up.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: ROBERT PITT crawls up onto the road.)</p>
<p>(He's in the middle of the road as the car approaches.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, the rancher's going to get off, Linda's dead, and Wolfie ... skates with a misdemeanor.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We took one look at those furry suits and thought &quot;foul play,&quot; but this was really just a domestic dispute gone mad.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hmm. Fur and loathing in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>(Camera pulls down and refocuses on the raccoon figure on the desk next to the badge.)</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>

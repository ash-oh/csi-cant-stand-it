							<p>Drop your weapon.</p>
<p>Drop your gun!</p>
<p>Drop your gun now.</p>
<p>You can't win; it's four on one.</p>
<p>Then I guess it's just about how many of you I take with me.</p>
<p>It's okay, Riley. We got you covered.</p>
<p>You're dead.</p>
<p>Nice shot, Willows.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>And, Adams, you get points for calling Sanders by your name to communicate your intentions.</p>
<p>That's a good job.</p>
<p>Hey, how many points does she lose for missing?</p>
<p>I don't want to be defensive or anything, but the only reason I missed was because Greg couldn't get out of the hold.</p>
<p>Oh, please.</p>
<p>Lee knows the signals better than we do.</p>
<p>And besides, you could've been more subtle.</p>
<p>Play nice, kiddies.</p>
<p>I need sidearm clearance and I've got to take a look at the tactical manual again.</p>
<p>These codes are very, very confusing.</p>
<p>Uh, the most important signal is Code Four.</p>
<p>Situation's secure-- Code Four.</p>
<p>Second most important: four eighty-two.</p>
<p>I know this. 482 is... What is it?</p>
<p>Lunch.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>And Riley's buying.</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>I'm buying? Well, then I hope you all like value meals.</p>
<p>This is Catherine.</p>
<p>Uh, uh, ten minutes out.</p>
<p>Copy that.</p>
<p>Multiple 419s at Green Valley and Elm. All hands on deck.</p>
<p>I looked at a house around the corner from here when I first moved to town.</p>
<p>I thought this was a nice neighborhood.</p>
<p>It is.</p>
<p>I heard this big crash, so I ran outside, and I saw three, maybe four guys fighting with Reggie Hatcher.</p>
<p>Bill came out running with his gun.</p>
<p>He tried to stop the fight, then they shot him.</p>
<p>It was likeHalo 3; everybody started shooting.</p>
<p>Next thing you know, I go down.</p>
<p>Okay, here's what we got.</p>
<p>A call came into 911 at 11:00 p.m.-- shots fired.</p>
<p>Neighborhood Watch captain was shot dead in the street.</p>
<p>A seven-year-old boy was shot and killed by a stray bullet when he came out to see what was going on.</p>
<p>All this happened in front of the Hatcher house.</p>
<p>Any suspect info?</p>
<p>Well, it's early, but what we know so far is it could be between two, three or four suspects, black, Hispanic or white.</p>
<p>They were driving an SUV that's either black, navy blue or dark green. Okay?</p>
<p>I know that doesn't give us much to work with.</p>
<p>There's plenty for us to work with here.</p>
<p>CSI Season09</p>
<p>Episode17 No Way Out to witnesses, the suspects' car was parked here in front of this house, facing the wrong way.</p>
<p>The suspects then proceeded on foot to the Hatcher house.</p>
<p>The owner, Priscilla Hatcher-- she was transported to the hospital with a head injury, so the interview was limited-- but she told me that a group of men-- uh, she wasn't specific about how many-- broke in, they roughed her up, they roughed up her son Reggie and her nephew Frankie.</p>
<p>So what do the son and the nephew have to say?</p>
<p>Well, they're in the wind.</p>
<p>We're looking for them.</p>
<p>So they could've been abducted.</p>
<p>Something bigger than a bullet came through this window.</p>
<p>You've got bloody glass, blood drops.</p>
<p>Fight looks like it came out this way.</p>
<p>Well, that confirms what Priscilla Hatcher said.</p>
<p>She said that her son Reggie got into a scuffle with one of the intruders, and they came through the window.</p>
<p>The Hatchers were the targets, yet suspects didn't park out front.</p>
<p>Maybe the suspects didn't want the vehicle to be seen.</p>
<p>Or didn't know which house they were going to hit.</p>
<p>Why don't you guys take the house.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>The Neighborhood Watch captain.</p>
<p>His name is Bill French.</p>
<p>He's a veteran.</p>
<p>Survived a tour in Iraq only to get gunned down in front of his own house.</p>
<p>It's a shame, really.</p>
<p>We have a gun here.</p>
<p>He got off two rounds.</p>
<p>.38 caliber.</p>
<p>Nine millimeter.</p>
<p>Shells all over the place.</p>
<p>Most of the recent gang shootings were with nines.</p>
<p>A blood pool and a blood trail away from the body.</p>
<p>Got to be from a second source.</p>
<p>Maybe the Watch commander shot one of the bad guys.</p>
<p>You got this, Riley?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Sir, I know this is hard.</p>
<p>I am just doing my job.</p>
<p>Just leave us alone.</p>
<p>Sir, please...</p>
<p>Listen, you can't take him.</p>
<p>I'll drive him to the hospital, okay? I'll drive him.</p>
<p>Sir, please. I need to take him.</p>
<p>You don't even know his name.</p>
<p>Excuse me.</p>
<p>I'm Greg Sanders. I'm with the crime lab.</p>
<p>What is your son's name?</p>
<p>Jason Morley.</p>
<p>All right, Mr. Morley.</p>
<p>Jason's no longer with us.</p>
<p>He's in a better place.</p>
<p>There's nothing any of us can do to change that.</p>
<p>But you have to let us take him, so we can figure out who did this.</p>
<p>David here will take very good care of your son. I promise.</p>
<p>Sir, please.</p>
<p>Okay. Okay. Okay.</p>
<p>Fresh collision damage.</p>
<p>And broken car lights.</p>
<p>Paint transfer. Got to be from our suspects' vehicle.</p>
<p>That's what I'm thinking.</p>
<p>Suspects' car is parked on the west side of the cul-de-sac, facing north.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>If that blood does belong to one of the suspects...</p>
<p>I'd say he got into his car, peels out, leaving behind these yaw marks...</p>
<p>Go, go!</p>
<p>Sideswipes the two parked cars?</p>
<p>Yeah, that's about it.</p>
<p>Riley.</p>
<p>Make sure that you process the collision damage on the two cars.</p>
<p>You got it, boss.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>This must be Reggie and his cousin Frankie.</p>
<p>Reggie was valedictorian of his high school class.</p>
<p>Smart kid.</p>
<p>Hope he has some street smarts, too.</p>
<p>I'll go take a look around the rest of the house.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>What do we have?</p>
<p>I got a pretty good handprint off the TV here.</p>
<p>We have two bedrooms--</p>
<p>Mom's and Frankie's.</p>
<p>Found a rolled up sleeping bag and Reggie's backpack on the floor in Frankie's room.</p>
<p>He's a student at WLVU.</p>
<p>I don't think he lives here though.</p>
<p>Maybe he comes home to do his laundry.</p>
<p>According to this... he lives right down the street.</p>
<p>It's all clear. Nobody home.</p>
<p>This is the house the SUV was parked in front of.</p>
<p>Yeah, Brass.</p>
<p>Okay, look, I'm going to want to talk to him. I'll be right there.</p>
<p>So a shooting victim just rolled in to Desert Palm Hospital.</p>
<p>Could be one of our suspects.</p>
<p>I'm gonna go. Are you okay?</p>
<p>I'm fine.</p>
<p>When can we talk to him?</p>
<p>Well, he's in rough shape.</p>
<p>The docs are working on him.</p>
<p>The bullet hit an artery. He's lost a lot of blood. I don't know... Hey, Doc.</p>
<p>He's dead, I'm afraid.</p>
<p>We found a gun on him.</p>
<p>It's in there with his clothes and a bullet that I pulled out of his leg.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>Nine millimeter.</p>
<p>Cuts on his face-- maybe he went through the window with Reggie.</p>
<p>Snakeback tattoos.</p>
<p>Guy's a gangbanger.</p>
<p>Marcus Garfield.</p>
<p>Five arrests for drugs and various armed assaults.</p>
<p>Well, the Snakeback gang's primary source of revenue is drugs.</p>
<p>But that street-- it's not in their territory.</p>
<p>Well, Reggie Hatcher was a student at WLVU, which is in their territory.</p>
<p>Maybe Reggie knew them.</p>
<p>That would make Reggie the target, not the house.</p>
<p>Then Reggie and Frankie are probably dead.</p>
<p>Let me drive.</p>
<p>Just give me a second here.</p>
<p>I'm trying to do Archie a favor, not get him fired.</p>
<p>He's at the Academy meeting.</p>
<p>In Denver. Which means he's snowboarding.</p>
<p>There is more to life than work.</p>
<p>That's a lesson I learned from your predecessor.</p>
<p>Where did it go?</p>
<p>Camera angle's too high. I can't isolate the driver's face.</p>
<p>Good. I thought I missed something.</p>
<p>With these tinted windows, you can't tell if anyone else is in the back.</p>
<p>But I did get you the license number.</p>
<p>And, uh, just for the record, Archie may be riding a half-pipe, but it's only in between lectures.</p>
<p>Such as, uh, &quot;Breath Analysis as a Forensics Tool.&quot;</p>
<p>That one's for me.</p>
<p>It's a part of our deal.</p>
<p>He got funded and I didn't.</p>
<p>R.O.is Marcus Garfield.</p>
<p>So I got you the driver.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>He may have driven to the crime scene, but he didn't drive to the hospital.</p>
<p>He's the one that got rolled out.</p>
<p>Hey, ran the bullets and the shell casings. All nine mill.</p>
<p>14 from the dead suspect's gun, 13 from some other nine.</p>
<p>27 in total.</p>
<p>So they were packing high-capacity semiautos.</p>
<p>Nick and Langston didn't recover any ammo evidence from the Hatcher house.</p>
<p>If they went there to kill Reggie, they would have shot him inside.</p>
<p>If they didn't want to kill him, what did they want?</p>
<p>Jim, what's up?</p>
<p>Copy that. On my way.</p>
<p>Brass may have just found both Reggie and Frankie.</p>
<p>Jim.</p>
<p>Oh, decomp.</p>
<p>The mall security smelled it, too.</p>
<p>When she was writing up the third parking violation.</p>
<p>The car's registered to Aaron Sweets.</p>
<p>He ran with the Snakebacks.</p>
<p>And according to his record, he knew Marcus Garfield.</p>
<p>James, come on in and open this up.</p>
<p>We're only about six or eight blocks from the crime scene.</p>
<p>Well, that's not Reggie or Frankie.</p>
<p>Who's buried in Grant's tomb?</p>
<p>Sweets. You see the candy cane?</p>
<p>Aaron Sweets.</p>
<p>Well, first ticket was written day before yesterday.</p>
<p>Well, that means Aaron Sweets is not our missing suspect.</p>
<p>That makes four.</p>
<p>All. 22s.</p>
<p>None of the players in our mess had. 22s. TOD?</p>
<p>Mr. Sweets here had assumed room temperature.</p>
<p>Been dead 24 to 48 hours.</p>
<p>So he was dead before the shoot-out?</p>
<p>I get gangbangers in here all the time.</p>
<p>Might be unrelated.</p>
<p>Scenes were six blocks apart in a nice neighborhood.</p>
<p>This isn't just a coincidence.</p>
<p>Marcus Garfield and an unknown suspect gained access to the Hatcher house there.</p>
<p>He's not unknown anymore.</p>
<p>I ID'd the handprint on the TV--</p>
<p>Robert Danward, aka Little Bobby.</p>
<p>Another member of the Snakebacks.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>We compared the blood on the glass to the DNA on the toothbrush found in Reggie's backpack.</p>
<p>Confirmed that Marcus Garfield and Reggie crashed through the window together.</p>
<p>The fight continued into the street.</p>
<p>According to the witnesses, the Neighborhood Watch captain confronted the suspects.</p>
<p>The bullet pulled from Garfield's leg matches the Watch captain's.38</p>
<p>The bullets they pulled from the Watch captain came from Garfield's nine.</p>
<p>One of Garfield's stray bullets hit Jason Morley who lived here.</p>
<p>He was the seven-year-old boy.</p>
<p>Aaron Sweets, another Snakeback, was shot four times with a.22</p>
<p>His body was found in the trunk of his car in a parking garage six blocks from the crime scene.</p>
<p>There was no. 22 ammo at the scene.</p>
<p>Can we find any connection between Sweets and Reggie?</p>
<p>Brass checked with WLVU.</p>
<p>Um, Reggie's a straight-A student.</p>
<p>He was accepted early admissions for graduate school next fall.</p>
<p>And I checked Reggie's cell phone and land line records.</p>
<p>No calls to or from our suspects.</p>
<p>What about Sweets?</p>
<p>Didn't have his number.</p>
<p>Try 555-0121.</p>
<p>Sweets called Reggie's land line six times in the last four days.</p>
<p>Well, that's our connection.</p>
<p>Has anyone checked Reggie's house?</p>
<p>The uniforms cleared it, but they were only looking for bodies.</p>
<p>I tore the kitchen apart.</p>
<p>No drugs, no weapons.</p>
<p>This doesn't really look like a college kid's place.</p>
<p>Reggie inherited this house from his grandmother.</p>
<p>Lots of sculpture, paintings.</p>
<p>Lots of phone jacks in Grandma's house, but no phones.</p>
<p>Did you see a phone in the kitchen?</p>
<p>No, and none in the master or guest bedroom either.</p>
<p>Let's try Reggie's home phone number.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Who puts a phone in the closet?</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait. Let me go first.</p>
<p>When you start carrying a gun, you can lead next time.</p>
<p>Odd place for a phone.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Piperidine, ether, cyanide.</p>
<p>Hydrochloric acid, magnesium turnings.</p>
<p>This is a PCP lab.</p>
<p>This is all highly explosive.</p>
<p>We should get out of here.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Word on the street is a college kid with talent as a mixer is pushing sherms in the Snakeback turf without paying them tribute.</p>
<p>Okay, so Reggie's got a target on his back because he's operating under a different business model?</p>
<p>You can get a degree, but it doesn't make you smart.</p>
<p>Any word on Little Bobby?</p>
<p>I heard he's taking some vacation time.</p>
<p>What do you want?</p>
<p>Hey, I just wanted to let you know we got the the guy who shot Jason.</p>
<p>He's a known gang member.</p>
<p>I'd like to rip his heart out.</p>
<p>I'd like to let you... but he's already dead.</p>
<p>I know it probably doesn't help.</p>
<p>You have to do this very often?</p>
<p>It's not part of my job.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I lost my wife last year.</p>
<p>Jason... just started sleeping in his own bed again.</p>

<p>Cops like coffee, right? You want a cup?</p>
<p>Sure.</p>

<p>She says Hazmat wants to know exactly what's down here.</p>
<p>Pure white powder.</p>
<p>Clear crystal finished product.</p>
<p>Usually this stuff looks like yellow sludge.</p>
<p>Reggie had it going on.</p>
<p>It's high grade.</p>

<p>Blood. Still wet.</p>
<p>Stop right there!</p>

<p>Hello?</p>
<p>Hey, guys.</p>
<p>Get over here.</p>
<p>Hey, you down there? I was in the neighborhood, thought I'd stop by, see if you need any...</p>
<p>It's okay. Riley... we don't need any help.</p>
<p>Okay, Sanders.</p>
<p>See you back at the lab.</p>
<p>Here, sit, sit!</p>
<p>We have a situation downstairs.</p>
<p>Suspects on the premises.</p>
<p>There's a surveillance camera over the front door.</p>
<p>I'm going to go call it in.</p>
<p>Hey, Greg.</p>
<p>Langston and Riley have been taken hostage at the PCP lab.</p>
<p>I don't know who or how many.</p>
<p>I'll call SWAT, notify Catherine.</p>
<p>You're Reggie, right?</p>
<p>Hey, man, you listen, okay?</p>
<p>I'm not gonna tell you again, okay?</p>
<p>Just sit there and shut up.</p>
<p>All right, Frankie, try to calm down.</p>
<p>How do you know who I am?</p>
<p>Reggie, your mother's in the hospital. She's worried about you.</p>
<p>She's worried about the both of you.</p>
<p>Reggie looks like he's hurt pretty bad, Frankie.</p>
<p>I can help him. I'm a doctor.</p>
<p>I can help him. All I need to do is look at him.</p>
<p>Go.</p>
<p>No, no, no, you sit.</p>
<p>I need more light to examine him properly. Can we bring him into the lab?</p>
<p>Yeah, okay, okay, okay.</p>
<p>But this better not be a trick!</p>
<p>We'll lay you down on three. One, two... three.</p>
<p>You hanging in there?</p>
<p>Is my mom okay?</p>
<p>I think she's going to be fine.</p>
<p>I didn't mean for any of this to happen.</p>
<p>Well, no one ever does.</p>
<p>Am I gonna die?</p>
<p>If you tried to take this glass out yourself, you probably would have.</p>
<p>You know, I was...</p>
<p>I was a big fan of Steve Irwin.</p>
<p>Me, too.</p>
<p>Hey, come on, man, there's nothing wrong with his head.</p>
<p>Get your finger off of there.</p>
<p>I need to check his vitals; his heart rate.</p>
<p>I want to make sure that he doesn't go into shock.</p>
<p>Look at me, Reggie. Open your eyes, look at me.</p>
<p>Good. Okay.</p>
<p>Frankie, Reggie's having a reaction to the chemicals in this room.</p>
<p>He's been in here too long and so have you.</p>
<p>We've to get the both of you out of here.</p>
<p>No, no, no, no. What do you think I am, stupid?</p>
<p>I think you care about what happens to Reggie.</p>
<p>Frankie, let him help me.</p>
<p>Oh, come on, Reg. Don't be on their side.</p>
<p>What, are you stuck on stupid, too?</p>
<p>Can't you see they're playing you?</p>
<p>You know, that's your problem.</p>
<p>You always let people sucker you.</p>
<p>My problem was I tried to help you.</p>
<p>I should've just let you die in the streets, man.</p>
<p>Mr. Book Smart.</p>
<p>Man, you ain't that smart.</p>
<p>You don't know nothing about the real grind like I do.</p>
<p>The real grind, Frankie?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The real grind?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The only thing you know is a gun.</p>
<p>Without that gun, you're nothing!</p>
<p>I'm nothing?</p>
<p>Man, without me, you wouldn't even have a dime for grad school!</p>
<p>I'm the one who turned your little chemistry projects into paper!</p>
<p>And then you want to go pay off Sweets like a chump.</p>
<p>Man, you didn't need to pay for protection!</p>
<p>Talking about, you need protection, this and that!</p>
<p>You didn't need protection! You had me!</p>
<p>I'm the one who killed Sweets!</p>
<p>I'm the one who protected your ass when you need it!</p>
<p>That was me! Me!</p>
<p>Look at me, Frankie!</p>
<p>What?</p>
<p>He's bleeding.</p>
<p>Sit back, Reggie, sit back, sit back.</p>
<p>All right, Frankie, he's gonna die if I don't help him.</p>
<p>You've got the gun-- that means you're in charge, so you better make a decision.</p>
<p>Okay. Do something, whatever.</p>
<p>I need, um, a towel, some kind of cloth to clean up this wound.</p>
<p>I have to irrigate the wound.</p>
<p>I need alcohol or water.</p>
<p>Do you have any of that here in the lab?</p>
<p>We also have to seal up all those chemicals.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay. Go.</p>
<p>Here... Here are paper towels. fresh water over there.</p>
<p>We don't have any lids here.</p>
<p>But I have some tape in my kit that will work, okay?</p>
<p>Okay. Go.</p>
<p>What the hell are you doing?</p>
<p>Frankie! You calling the cops, huh?</p>
<p>Is that what you doing, Miss Smart-Aleck, huh?</p>
<p>Leave it! Drop it!</p>
<p>Listen to me. If I don't pick up that radio... it's going to send out a &quot;horizontal alert.&quot;</p>
<p>Now, that means the police will know that we're in trouble within 30 seconds.</p>
<p>So just let me pick it up, okay?</p>
<p>Turn it off. Turn it off! T Turn it off! Turn it off!</p>
<p>Ray e-mailed me photos from the PCP lab, one of which includes a surveillance monitor.</p>
<p>The suspects have a clear view of the front of the house.</p>
<p>We got a three-man entry team right here. We'll find an alternate way in.</p>
<p>I'm running the show here, okay?</p>
<p>Hey, we got an open mic.</p>
<p>Look, tell me who's going to help me here with Reggie.</p>
<p>I need another pair of hands.</p>
<p>Reggie and Frankie are both in there.</p>
<p>Are you going to help me?</p>
<p>Sounds like Reggie's injured.</p>
<p>Which means there's probably only one gun in there-- Frankie's.</p>
<p>Get your... get your little nurse lady to help you.</p>
<p>That's right, go over there. Go help my cousin.</p>
<p>Frankie, listen to me.</p>
<p>You haven't hurt anyone yet. But if you... if you pull that trigger, that.</p>
<p>22 is going to change everything.</p>
<p>Frankie's got the.22</p>
<p>Sweets was killed with a.22</p>
<p>I haven't hurt anyone yet?</p>
<p>Is that what you just said?</p>
<p>I wasted a guy, okay?</p>
<p>I killed a gangbanger.</p>
<p>It's not like the court's going to execute me. I'm only 14!</p>
<p>So, go ahead! Just do something! Just fix my cousin!</p>
<p>What the hell are they doing here?</p>
<p>It's a damn news chopper.</p>
<p>This is restricted air space.</p>
<p>We'll get them out of here.</p>
<p>Cops?</p>
<p>It was the radio!</p>
<p>You tricked me, you bitch!</p>
<p>Frankie, that's enough.</p>
<p>You!</p>
<p>If he dies... then we all die.</p>
<p>Frankie, just let me answer the phone and tell them that we're okay.</p>
<p>No, no, they don't need to know squat.</p>
<p>Look, Reggie has got to get to a hospital.</p>
<p>But you said you could fix him.</p>
<p>I don't have the proper equipment.</p>
<p>He needs a surgeon. I'm not a surgeon.</p>
<p>But you're a doctor, right?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Yeah, so, so, so figure out something.</p>
<p>Doc... I don't feel good.</p>
<p>Everything is spinning.</p>
<p>Um, all right, I have, uh...</p>
<p>Well, I can use the ether to put you under.</p>
<p>I've got a scalpel in my kit to make the incision.</p>
<p>And hemostats, to clamp off the veins before I remove the glass.</p>
<p>Um, I still need other things.</p>
<p>I I need, uh, gauze, sterile gauze, a needle and thread, antiseptic.</p>
<p>We don't have any of that stuff.</p>
<p>Okay, I have all of that.</p>
<p>It's up in the first aid kit.</p>
<p>But it's in the truck, upstairs.</p>
<p>No... No. No one's going anywhere.</p>
<p>I can help Reggie, but I need the kit. I have to have it.</p>
<p>Let me tell them I'm coming up there.</p>
<p>This is another... another one of your tricks, isn't it?</p>
<p>This isn't a trick, Frankie.</p>
<p>I want us all to walk away from this, okay?</p>
<p>This is Adams.</p>
<p>Are you and Langston okay?</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah. We're okay.</p>
<p>Without alerting the suspects, can you describe the situation in detail?</p>
<p>We have a kid down here who is injured. He needs medical attention.</p>
<p>I'm going to come up and get the first aid kit from the truck.</p>
<p>Langston is going to stay here.</p>
<p>I have to be able to come back down.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>She's got to go back in, or Langston's dead.</p>
<p>Jack, give me a walkie.</p>
<p>I want to talk to her.</p>
<p>The front entrance and the street are covered by surveillance.</p>
<p>They'll be waiting for us to make our move.</p>
<p>Okay, I got it.</p>
<p>We got to try. I can't just sit here and do nothing.</p>
<p>The tree behind the Denali is the edge of frame.</p>
<p>Stay behind that.</p>
<p>Right. Yeah, I got that.</p>
<p>Why is she going to the back of the truck?</p>
<p>We keep the first aid kit in the back of the truck, Frankie.</p>
<p>You have to trust us.</p>
<p>She better not run.</p>
<p>How you holding up?</p>
<p>How many guns?</p>
<p>You armed?</p>
<p>Then you know what you got to do.</p>
<p>Frankie, bring me that bottle of ether, please.</p>
<p>Yes, that's it. Put it down there. Thank you.</p>
<p>I came right back.</p>
<p>Frankie, I'm going to open this up so you can see for yourself no tricks.</p>
<p>Please, please, don't... don't touch any of that.</p>
<p>You'll contaminate it, and Reggie could get infected.</p>
<p>Look, I'm going to need another pair of hands.</p>
<p>Which one of you is going to help me?</p>
<p>Ain't gonna be me.</p>
<p>Relax, Frankie.</p>
<p>You just worry about how you're going to get us out of here.</p>
<p>Be strong.</p>
<p>Riley, I want you to apply pressure here.</p>
<p>That's good. With your fingertips, just like that. Very good.</p>
<p>Reggie, I want you to understand exactly what I'm going to do.</p>
<p>First, I'm going to put you under.</p>
<p>Once you're under, I'm going to stop the bleeding, and once that's done, I'm going to try and remove the glass. All right?</p>
<p>Listen, tell my mom I love her.</p>
<p>You tell her that yourself.</p>
<p>You know, I only wanted to become a real scientist.</p>
<p>Maybe do some good.</p>
<p>I guess I thought I could handle everything.</p>
<p>Things got away from me.</p>
<p>Try and relax.</p>
<p>I shouldn't have run.</p>
<p>Don't fight it. Just relax.</p>
<p>Take a couple of deep breaths.</p>
<p>I have to cut him, Frankie.</p>
<p>It's very difficult to concentrate with you pointing that gun at me.</p>
<p>We can pump in CS gas.</p>
<p>On the west end of the house, there's a vent that leads directly into the lab.</p>
<p>Except we're talking about a 14-year-old kid with a gun that he's not afraid to use.</p>
<p>The gas could cause him to panic.</p>
<p>Yeah, one wild shot and he blows up the whole block.</p>
<p>Riley's armed. She's trained for this.</p>
<p>If she gets the opportunity, she will take it.</p>
<p>One thing we got going for us, time is on our side.</p>
<p>I say we trust them.</p>
<p>So do I.</p>
<p>We need more towels.</p>
<p>Hand me another hemostat.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>All right. Ready?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And... here we go.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Oh, my God! What did you do to him?</p>
<p>I need help.</p>
<p>He's not going to die, is he?</p>
<p>I need someone to put pressure on the artery.</p>
<p>Give me the gun.</p>
<p>I need someone to apply pressure to the artery while I make a pressure bandage, Frankie.</p>
<p>I need your hands.</p>
<p>Reggie needs your help. Give me the gun.</p>
<p>Come on, do some good for a change.</p>
<p>Frankie, I need you over herenow.</p>
<p>You see where my hand is? Put your hand there. You feel it? You got it?</p>
<p>That's it, right there. Keep the pressure tight. Good.</p>
<p>Code Four, suspect's disarmed.</p>
<p>We need an ambulance, Code Three.</p>
<p>Have your people treat him fairly, Captain.</p>
<p>He doesn't have to be a lost cause.</p>
<p>Somehow, I knew you were going to say that.</p>

<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY SCENES (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(It's raining. A lot.)</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS COMMUNITY (STOCK) -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Lightning flashes, thunder rumbles. It's still raining. A lot.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. STORM DRAIN - ENTRANCE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Camera lingers on the entrance to the storm drain.) </p>
<p>(A closer look at the drains. We hear the squealing of rats coming from inside. The squealing gets louder as the rats get closer.)</p>
<p>(Camera holds low to the ground on the entrance to the storm drain. The rats run out of the storm drain.)</p>
<p>(A beat later and we see the legs of homeless people running out of cover from the storm drain and into the rain.)</p>
<p>(As the last homeless person runs out of the storm drain, we hear the roar of water. It catches up to the last homeless person knocking him off his feet.) </p>
<p>(The homeless person scrambles to his feet to get out of the way.)</p>
<p>(The water continues to rush out of the storm drain. As it sweeps by, it rises above the camera level. Under water, we see a dead body get caught in the wire mesh partially blocking the storm drain entrance.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. STORM DRAIN - ENTRANCE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[CAMERA POV]</p>
<p>(Camera shutter clicks as photos are taken of the dead body. The outer layer of skin is red and partially damaged.)</p>
<p>(It's still raining.)</p>
<p>RESUME VIEW</p>
<p>(Grissom puts the camera down. He and Catherine are standing over the body inside the storm drain. Outside, we see an officer walk by. The water level is up to his upper thighs.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Who found him?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The police were sweeping the area looking for vagrants, trying to keep<br />
'em above water.</p>
<p>(He points to the body.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Take a look at his nose. Same thing with his chin ... his elbows ... and his knees. He lost all his points.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Like a rock in a tumbler.</p>
<p>(David Phillips makes his way into the storm drain.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: I'm sorry I'm late. Stopped to get my waders.</p>
<p>(He checks the body, starting from the lower legs and working his way up.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: No wallet. (He finds something else.) Oh, wait a sec. </p>
<p>(He digs into the pants pockets and finds a small container of white powder. He gives it to Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p>(Catherine looks at it.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'll get it to narco.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Take a look.</p>
<p>(Grissom finds a sharp piece of wood impaled through the body's neck.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Cause of death?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Water pressure could have done it.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Or a person.</p>
<p>(Grissom takes a photo of it.) </p>
<p>(David goes back to the body. Warrick makes his way into the storm drain and joins them.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey. Whoo! It's a mess. I've talked to every resident in the area. No one knows this guy. No unaccounted-for vehicles. I don't know what to tell you.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, at least we know where he came from.</p>
<p>(Grissom shines his flashlight into the darkness of the storm drain. Warrick turns and looks. Catherine grimaces.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Aren't we at least gonna draw straws?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No.</p>
<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO:<br />
[INT. STORM DRAIN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Catherine and Warrick make their way through the storm drain looking for evidence. The water in the drain is up to their knees.) </p>
<p>(They come to a level change. Catherine steps down. The water is now up to her hips. They look up at the grate above them.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We must be under the freeway by now.</p>
<p>(We hear the sounds of cars speeding by.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey. Did I ever tell you that the city paid me a dollar a square foot to rip out my lawn and replace it with rocks because we're in a drought?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Are you kidding me?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: This city was not made for rain.</p>
<p>(They continue to walk through the storm drain.) </p>
<p>(They step out of the tunnel they're in and into a juncture. The walls are painted with graffiti. They search around the area and find a body sprawled out on the floor, clothes drenched from the rain.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Catherine.</p>
<p>(They walk up to the body. Catherine takes out her radio.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to radio) Grissom. We got another body.</p>
<p>(The body awakens. Catherine and Warrick are both startled.) </p>
<p><strong>Homeless Man</strong>: I was taking a nap.</p>
<p>SMASH CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[INT. STORM DRAIN - TUNNELS -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Warrick questions the Homeless man.) </p>
<p><strong>Homeless Man</strong>: I'm real tired, okay? I just want to get some sleep.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I understand, I understand. Listen, I need to ask you a question. Have you ever seen this guy right here?</p>
<p>(Warrick shows him the Polaroid photo in a plastic bag. He looks at it.) </p>
<p><strong>Homeless Man</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You don't know him?</p>
<p><strong>Homeless Man</strong>: No, someone comes down here that don't belong, I mean, bad stuff can happen, okay? I-I-I just want to go home, okay? A-a-and you can't make me leave my house.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Nobody's making you do anything, okay? Now, you like coffee?</p>
<p><strong>Homeless Man</strong>: Well, yeah, as long as it's a decaf, one sugar, two cream, no skim, and hot -- your lawsuit hot.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Okay, you go with that officer over there. He'll get you a nice cup of coffee, all right?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. STORM DRAIN - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(Catherine is looking around the area.) </p>
<p>(She hears water movement from around the corner behind her. She looks and doesn't see anything.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Is that you, Warrick?</p>
<p>(After a very tense moment, Warrick appears from around the corner.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: There you are.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (sighs) Phew.</p>
<p>(She finds something caught in the tree branches.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Is that a sneaker?</p>
<p>(She picks it up.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Looks like an aquasock.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(She finds the other side.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Here's its mate. (They look at it.) Kind of upscale for a tunnel rat. So the vic was barefoot. The tunnel's full of murder weapons. Bum kills him, or finds the body and takes the socks? What was the guy doing here in the first place?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, maybe the vic was some punk, uh ... with an attitude. Decided to take it out on some homeless guy. You never know.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The way the body was ground down means that the water took him for a pretty long ride.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, we're already wet, so ...</p>
<p>(Catherine sighs. They continue down through the tunnels.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[EXT. INDUSTRIAL - STREET (TOP SIDE) - DAY]</p>
<p>(A man sits on the bus bench reading the morning paper.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (o.s.) Excuse me!</p>
<p>(The man looks around.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (o.s.) Down here!</p>
<p>(He looks down through the drain grate and sees Catherine looking up at him from below.)</p>
<p><strong>Man At Bus Stop</strong>: Oh. What's your problem, Sweetie?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Uh, no problem, sir. I'm just wanting to know what street I'm on. Under.</p>
<p><strong>Man At Bus Stop</strong>: Oh, it's, uh, Industrial. You're just South of Tropicana.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Man At Bus Stop</strong>: And I'm not holding the bus.</p>
<p>[INT. STORM DRAIN - TUNNELS - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to the man above) Don't bother.</p>
<p>(Catherine looks at Warrick.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: All right, so we're about a mile south of where we started.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, there's 300 miles of storm drains in Clark County, so we only have 299 left.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What, do we, uh, eenie-meenie-minie-mo it? Split up? What do we do?</p>
<p>(Warrick looks down the tunnel to the right.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No, that's a dead end.</p>
<p>(At the juncture he finds something floating in the water caught on some tree branches.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Sunscreen on a lanyard.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Fits with the aquasocks.</p>
<p>(Warrick looks at the tunnel to the left.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I say we keep going upstream.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I knew you were gonna say that. (Catherine starts through the tunnel. She ducks when the low concrete ceiling dips.) Watch your head.</p>
<p>(Warrick follows her.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Grissom watches as Robbins starts on the body. He begins with the Y-incision down the torso. Standing a distance away from the table is Greg who is also in the room for his first autopsy.) </p>
<p>(He looks away as the first cut is made.)</p>
<p>(Grissom notes Greg's reaction.)</p>
<p>(Robbins finishes the cut and pulls the skin open. Greg's eyes widen at the sight. Robbins turns to Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: I'm gonna need the drain pan.</p>
<p>(Grissom hands the drain pan to Robbins who puts it on the tray next to him. Water starts to drip from the roof into the drain pan.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: This town isn't built for rain, hmm?</p>
<p>(Robbins takes the hand saw and turns it on. He glances up at Greg. Greg puts his fingers in his ears as Robbins cuts into the rib cage. Blood spurts on Robbins' mask.)</p>
<p>(Finished, Robbins turns the hand saw off and sets it aside. Grissom watches Greg. Greg looks at Grissom.) </p>
<p>(Robbins grabs the rib cage piece and pulls it out of the body. He sets it aside. Robbins motions for Greg to move in closer.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Come on, don't be shy. Take a good look. In the end ... it's all we really are.</p>
<p>(Robbins cuts the aorta leading into the heart. Greg watches, his eyes wide. He looks at the victim's partially damaged face and back down to the victim's feet. He appears thoughtful.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: If you're gonna be sick, Greg, do it in the sink. </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (chimes in) Not in the drain pan.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I don't feel sick.</p>
<p>(Robbins makes a vertical cut in the neck. Grissom knows what's going to be there.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Take a look at the trachea. What do you see?</p>
<p>(Greg leans in for a look. Robbins peels the skin back.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Foam. Like the head of a beer. (Greg looks self-consciously at Grissom.) Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No. It's a good analogy. </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Pulmonary edema, fluids in the air passages.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: So he drowned?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, doesn't prove it. Same thing happens with, uh, heart failure or drug overdose.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: But the fact that the heart of the victim was a normal size, ... </p>
<p>(Greg's eyes move to the heart that Robbins is holding.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: ... and assuming tox doesn't show drug overdose, C.O.D. is most likely drowning, but I'm not gonna rule out blunt-force trauma.</p>
<p>(Robbins starts the hand saw up again. Greg takes a couple of cautious steps away from the body.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. STORM DRAIN -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Catherine and Warrick approach the storm drain entrance.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Daylight. Finally.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We gotta be into some golden time by now, right?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Oh, yeah. </p>
<p>(The water has completely drained from this area. In the entrance are some shrubs and leaves from trees.)</p>
<p>(A car passes nearby.) </p>
<p>(b.g.) ka-ching, ka-ching.</p>
<p>(Warrick and Catherine look around at the things left in the entrance.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What do we have here? (She picks up a helmet.) Brain bucket. (She looks inside.) There's something in the lid.</p>
<p>(Warrick looks at the wall and sees something caught inside.) </p>
<p>(She takes out the slip of paper and hands the helmet to Warrick.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hang on to that.</p>
<p>(Warrick takes the helmet. She looks at the Employee ID lanyard for<br />
TANGIERS CASINO<br />
CALVIN BERKOWITZ<br />
ID NUMBER 1654984<br />
LIFEGUARD )</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, it's our dead guy.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No way.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Calvin Berkowitz. Worked at the Tangiers. Lifeguard. So what's Calvin doing down here?</p>
<p>(Warrick looks back at the wall and takes out the large thick rubber tube.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It's an inner tube.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Guy gets the day off and decides to go surfing ... Vegas style.</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: [RAINING - NIGHT] Calvin Berkowitz gives a loud whoop and jumps into the channel with his tube. End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (nods) Oh, I heard about that. He grabs an inner tube, a helmet, jumps into the channel.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hits his head on something, drowns.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Current takes him down.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: That would account for all that body trauma.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: This isn't about drugs or beating up homeless dudes. It's just plain stupidity.</p>
<p>(Warrick snorts.)</p>
<p>(Case closed. They head out of the storm drain and into the light.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, that's what happens when you don't have a decent beach in Vegas.</p>
<p>[EXT. STORM DRAIN - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Catherine looks around the area.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, you know something? This is, uh, right around where I found Lindsay.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, when Eddie's car went off the road.</p>
<p>(Not liking the memories it's bringing back, Catherine sighs and shakes her head.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Ugh ... let's just get out of here. Can you take that?</p>
<p>(She hands the helmet to Warrick and starts the steep climb out of the channel.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Watch your step.</p>
<p>(Catherine starts the climb, slips and falls backward - into Warrick's arms.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey. Oh.</p>
<p>(She laughs heartily.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You all right?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, I think.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Whoa.</p>
<p>(For a moment, the laughter dies and they stare at each other.)</p>
<p><strong>S&amp;S Worker</strong>: (o.s.) Hey! </p>
<p>(Catherine and Warrick look up to find a Sewage Worker standing at the edge of the channel looking down at them.)</p>
<p><strong>S&amp;S Worker</strong>: You guys CSI?</p>
<p>(Warrick lets Catherine go.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO:<br />
[INT. INDUSTRIAL - DAY -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(Catherine and Warrick walk with the S&amp;S Worker as he leads them to the manhole.) </p>
<p><strong>S&amp;S Worker</strong>: Well, the city's been rehabbing manholes with fiberglass liners. All the hydrogen sulfide down there really eats up the concrete. Anyways, we, uh, pulled these out of the main.</p>
<p>(He hands Catherine the bone fragments. She looks at them.) </p>
<p><strong>S&amp;S Worker</strong>: We find a lot of small animal bones down there, squirrels, cats, rats, you know. But that's really tiny stuff. </p>
<p>(Catherine gives the bones to Warrick.) </p>
<p><strong>S&amp;S Worker</strong>: This looks more like people. Fingers or toes, or fingers and toes.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, animal bones can fool you. Pig's feet or sheep ribs are not much different from yours or mine.</p>
<p>(Warrick looks at the bone pieces.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Flaky texture. Probably a couple years old.</p>
<p>(Catherine looks down the hole.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (sighs) Yep. We're gonna have to flush the line.</p>
<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO:<br />
(The S&amp;S Workers are positioning the Vactor down into the manhole. Warrick looks at the worker.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You guys get a lot of jokes about this thing?</p>
<p><strong>S&amp;S Worker</strong>: (scoffs) What do you think?</p>
<p>(He smiles.)</p>
<p>(Camera zooms down the street to another open manhole.)</p>
<p>(Top view down inside the manhole shows Catherine placing the filter over the opening. She climbs up the ladder.)</p>
<p>(Warrick's phone rings. He answers it.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Vactor's in place. Ready when you are.</p>
<p>(Catherine takes out her radio and responds.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Rip it.</p>
<p>(Warrick motions to the S&amp;S worker.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Let's go.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV through the Vactor. The water flushes out of the vactor and down into the manhole. It travels through the sewage pipes, twisting and turning along the way flushing out all the guck that could possibly cause the clog.)</p>
<p>(It reaches the filter.)</p>
<p>(End of CGI POV. Resume to present.) </p>
<p>(Catherine removes the wire filter cap. Inside, she fines more bone fragments. Catherine sits down and takes out her radio.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to radio) Warrick.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (from radio) Yo.</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: How do we know the bones just didn't wash off the street?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well waste water sewage is a closed system. It's completely separate from the storm drains. Someone must have flushed it down a toilet, a sink, a tub, or tossed them directly into a manhole.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And the bones look pretty old, so it could just be from a grave robber getting rid of his leftovers.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: And they make a 90-degree turn before they connect to the main. Look at the size of these bones.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Uh. Florazene reacts to feces as well as blood, so I know that you're not looking for blood.</p>
<p>(Warrick sprays the walls.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No. These vaults are built big for access. They're not reservoirs. Water's supposed to stay down in the pipes.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And the only way the water would rise is if there's something blocking the pipe.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (nods) Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And loose bones wouldn't do that.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: But a whole body would.</p>

<p>(Grissom catches up with Nick in the hallway.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How are you doing with victim ID?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So far we've followed up on eleven missing persons who fit the profile, ruled out every one by case history.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What's the most recent case?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, we're only looking at people who've been missing more than a year. The condition of the bones ...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (interrupts) ... was misleading. Tissue in a sewer decomposes twenty times faster than normal. The victim could be missing as little as five weeks.</p>
<p>(Grissom walks away. Nick stops at that thought.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - A/V LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Nick is back at the computer going through missing persons. He goes back to the radius from the house on Tyler Street and comes up with a name: TRAVIS GILES. He's been missing for 6 weeks.) </p>
<p>CUT BACK TO:</p>
<p>[EXT. TYLER STREET - DAY]</p>
<p>(The Bomb Squad places a single pipe bomb in the secure container set up out in the middle of the road.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Are we clear to get back in there?</p>
<p><strong>Rick Dysart</strong>: (shakes his head) We're not through. We swept the house for booby traps. It was clean, but we still haven't done a full search yet.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, why don't you clear an area and we'll process behind you.</p>
<p><strong>Rick Dysart</strong>: Scene will still be under my authority.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I don't have a problem with authority.</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Fire in the hole!</p>
<p>(The bomb explodes.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - WAITING ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Nick interviews Travis' Grandmother, Mrs. Giles. She holds a photo of Travis.) </p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Giles</strong>: This is Travis's ninth grade picture. His father, my son, was a punk. He, uh, skipped out just after Travis was born. His mother's in Salt Lake. (She puts the photo down and slides it over to Nick.) She's a junkie. The only time she ever called Travis was to use him to get money out of me. I mean, she can barely take care of herself, let alone a kid. You know how many times I told him that.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, most of the time kids believe what they want to believe, you know. Did he run off to see his mom?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Giles</strong>: (nods) Mm. Yeah, it wasn't the first time. He's, uh ... about six weeks ago, I come home to a note. So I called his mom, and ... he just never, he never showed up.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Ms. Giles, do you, uh, do you recognize this boy?</p>
<p>(Nick shows her a copy of a WILLIAM McKINLEY HIGH SCHOOL Student Body ID Card and photo for Owen Durbin.)</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Giles</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Giles</strong>: (shakes her head) Mm-mm.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Do you have anything of Travis's he might have used on his body? Like a toothbrush, hairbrush, anything like that?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Giles</strong>: No, he took all that kind of thing with him when he left.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mmm.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Giles</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, it would help if I could get a sample of Travis's DNA. Look ...<br />
(He sighs.) Ma'am, I don't really know how to say this ...</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Giles</strong>: Don't bother. I know he's dead.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Brass puts Travis Giles' photo on the table as he interviews Owen Durbin. Terry Durbin is also there.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Is this a classmate of yours, Owen?</p>
<p><strong>Owen Durbin</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Okay, let's try that again. You two went to the same middle school, right?</p>
<p><strong>Owen Durbin</strong>: Maybe. I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You guess. Were you friends?</p>
<p><strong>Terry Durbin</strong>: I know my son's friends. That's not one of them.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Mrs. Durbin, may I speak with you for a minute in private? Excuse us, Owen.</p>
<p>(Brass pulls Mrs. Durbin aside.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know, sometimes kids get self-conscious around their parents. Maybe it would be better if I spoke to Owen by myself. He'll have an advocate present to make sure his rights are respected. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>Terry Durbin</strong>: I'm not leaving my son alone with you. My husband wouldn't like that.</p>
<p>(Terry Durbin returns to her seat next to Owen.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. DURBIN RESIDENCE - STAIRS / SECOND FLOOR -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Camera slowly travels up the stairs. Along the wall at various points in clusters, there are white stickers to note the blood spatter on the wall. At the top, Sara and Catherine are examining blood spatter on the wall.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Medium-velocity spatter.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: This looks like the point of origin.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: Someone stabs someone else at the top of the stairs.)</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV of: The knife cuts through flesh. End of CGI POV. Resume quick flash.) </p>
<p>(The victim turns and hits the wall. White stickers appear where the blood spatters. He hits the wall again, putting his hand out. More white stickers appear where the blood spatters. He falls against the railing - white sticker appear. He falls down the stairs.)</p>
<p>(End of quick flash. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(Catherine looks down the stairs. She takes out her phone and makes a call.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, this is Catherine Willows for Captain Brass.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY] </p>
<p>(Brass returns to the room where he's questioning Owen and Terry Durbin.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Tell me about the blood in your house.</p>
<p><strong>Terry Durbin</strong>: Blood? Where?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, the top of the stairs for starters.</p>
<p><strong>Terry Durbin</strong>: I don't know what you're talking about.</p>
<p>(Brass sits down and looks at Owen.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You do.</p>
<p><strong>Owen Durbin</strong>: I don't. Maybe it's the dogs'. When they go upstairs sometimes, sometimes they fight. </p>
<p><strong>Terry Durbin</strong>: They fight a lot.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. DURBIN RESIDENCE - SECOND FLOOR -- DAY -CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>[SCOPE VIEW OF THE BLOOD ON THE WALL]</p>
<p>(Catherine looks at the blood spatter measuring it.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Animal control said the Durbins' pit bulls showed no signs of recent injury. Dogs heal fast. I guess I'll go back to the lab and get a hematrace.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Don't bother.</p>
<p>(She sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The lowest point of spatter is 46 inches above the ground with a downward angle. Even if those dogs could walk upright, they couldn't have done this. Kid's a liar.</p>
<p>FADE OUT</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. DURBIN RESIDENCE -DAY] </p>
<p>(Warrick walks around the side of the building with his camera looking for evidence. He stops when he sees a pick leaning against the brick wall. He takes a photo of it.) </p>
<p>[INT. DURBIN RESIDENCE -HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Sara makes her way through the hallway into Owen's bedroom. On the wall on the outside of his bedroom door he has a lot of cut outs from magazines.)</p>
<p>[INT. DURBIN RESIDENCE - GARAGE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Grissom steps into the garage. He finds Lt. Rick Dysart going through some of the gadgets and things on the worktable.)</p>
<p><strong>Rick Dysart</strong>: We're not done yet.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Take your time.</p>
<p><strong>Rick Dysart</strong>: Got some det cord here.</p>
<p>(He tosses it back on the work table.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Isn't that high explosive?</p>
<p><strong>Rick Dysart</strong>: Stuff designed to be humped around by grunts. You gotta want it go off. Only one thing you need to worry about. (He looks at Grissom.) Ever see me running, make sure you keep up.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Got it.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. DURBIN RESIDENCE - OWEN'S BEDROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Sara opens the door to Owen's Bedroom and steps inside. She looks around. Inside on the wall, he has more cut outs from magazines taped and pinned to the wall.)</p>
<p>(Above his bed, he has a poster of pinhead.)</p>
<p>[EXT. DURBIN RESIDENCE - DAY] </p>
<p>(Warrick continues to walk around the house. He moves the trash bag away and takes a photo of something flat and furry.)</p>
<p>[INT. DURBIN RESIDENCE -OWEN'S BEDROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Sara continues to look through Owen's Bedroom.) </p>
<p>(She looks at Owen's fish tank and notes the dead fish floating at the top near the surface.) </p>
<p>(She looks around the room.)</p>
<p>(Under the bed, she pulls out a box of unlabeled video tapes.)</p>
<p>[EXT. DURBIN RESIDENCE - DAY] </p>
<p>(Warrick finds a metal barrel filled with ashes. It's the kind of barrel used to burn things in. He sifts through the ashes and finds a pair of shoes. He also finds some clothing.) </p>
<p>(He sets the folded clothes next to the shoes. He snaps photos of them both.) </p>
<p>[INT. DURBIN RESIDENCE -GARAGE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Grissom sees the blood spatter on the garage floor.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hey, Rick, watch your step. This could be blood evidence on the floor.</p>
<p>(Grissom snaps photos of the floor. Rick Dysart is working his way through the work table.) </p>
<p>(Warrick opens the garage door and walks in.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Okay, Grissom, I located some burnt clothes in a barrel out in the back. I'm thinking he was killed in the house, dragged out back and then dumped.</p>
<p>(Grissom notes the blood on the floor.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He might have been dragged in here. Make sure you bag that stuff.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, I'm all over it.</p>
<p>(Warrick turns and leaves the garage.)</p>
<p>(Grissom follows the blood drops to the back of the refrigerator. He looks behind the refrigerator and sees a knife hidden in a box. The knife handle is exposed.)</p>
<p>(Rick Dysart opens the refrigerator to check it out. What he sees makes his blood run cold. There are several bottles on both racks filled with various different color liquids.)</p>
<p>(Grissom uses his latex glove and reaches for the knife behind the refrigerator.) </p>
<p><strong>Rick Dysart</strong>: (stiffly) Don't touch a thing. Get out now.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Uh, I think I have some evidence back here.</p>
<p><strong>Rick Dysart</strong>: (firmly) Clear out now.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. DURBIN RESIDENCE - STAIRS/SECOND FLOOR -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Grissom runs up the stairs.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (shouts) Hey! The garage is packed with liquid explosives. They're gonna detonate in place. (Catherine can't believe it.) So grab what's important and get out now! That means you, too, Sara! Right now!</p>
<p>[INT. DURBIN RESIDENCE -OWEN'S BEDROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Sara starts dumping things in to the open evidence bag on the floor. She grabs it and starts grabbing the other packages.)</p>
<p>[INT. DURBIN RESIDENCE -SECOND FLOOR -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Catherine quickly grabs her evidence bags off the floor.)</p>
<p>[INT. DURBIN RESIDENCE -OWEN'S BEDROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Her arms filled with evidence packages, Sara runs out of the bedroom.)</p>
<p>[INT. DURBIN RESIDENCE -SECOND FLOOR -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Catherine clears out with her bags of evidence.)</p>
<p>[EXT. DURBIN RESIDENCE - DAY] </p>
<p>(Warrick gathers his bags and packages. He grabs what he can and goes.)</p>
<p>[INT. DURBIN RESIDENCE -GARAGE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(The Bomb Squad in protective gear puts some plastique in the center of the refrigerator.</p>
<p>[EXT. DURBIN RESIDENCE - DAY] </p>
<p>(They run a line out from the garage.) </p>

[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Roger Durbin explodes. Officers lead Roger Durbin down the hallway. He's in handcuffs and cursing all the way.) </p>
<p><strong>Roger Durbin</strong>: Sons of bitches! I'm gonna sue your ass into the ground. I hope you know that. Yeah. I'm gonna own you. I'm gonna own this whole place. In fact, maybe that's where I'll live. I'm just gonna move in here.</p>
<p>(Brass and Catherine stand in the doorway and watch him walk by.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Let me guess. He lawyered up.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, he stopped talking after I told him we blew up his house.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hmm. And what about the wife and son?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: They're still in play. How much longer is anybody's guess. But, uh, we need something more to go back at them with.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - LOUNGE - DAY] </p>
<p>(Grissom and his team review the case and what evidence they have.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, I think at this point we can agree that the murder weapon was a knife. These are pictures of a box of knives that I was unable to recover from the Durbin Garage.</p>
<p>(He hands out the photos of the box of knives.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So how about the tool marks?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I cast the stab marks in the victim's ribs. Bone deterioration removed all the individual characteristics. The best we can do is rule out the serrated blade.</p>
<p>(Catherine turns to look at Sara.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, what about the kid's videos?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Uh, no tape of the murder or body he dumped so far. I'm not holding my breath. Videos cover several years. Kid running around the house. Backyard barbecue kind of stuff. You know, home movies. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: A teenage boy with a shoe box full of home movies under his bed?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It's weird, I know. I'm still looking.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, we know Owen went to school with Travis Giles, right?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, that was a few years back, and we still can't place Travis at the house.</p>
<p>(Warrick passes around the photos of the clothes and shoes.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: With all the fire damage, the clothes are the right size, but I couldn't get any blood evidence off of it.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Even if we had that, we still don't have a blood standard for Travis. I mean, we can't even positively ID the victim.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - RECEPTION -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Mrs. Giles waits at the reception desk. Nick walks out to meet her.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Ms. Giles? Hi. What can I do for you?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Giles</strong>: I wasn't able to find a hairbrush or a toothbrush, but the only thing I have left of Travis's is ... this.</p>
<p>(From a black pouch, she takes out some baby teeth. Nick looks at the tooth.) </p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Giles</strong>: When he was little, I used to be his tooth fairy.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) -- NIGHT</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Brass and Catherine interview Owen Durbin and Terry Durbin.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: DNA from Travis Giles' tooth matched the blood that we found in your house.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: And now you're gonna tell us how it got there.</p>
<p><strong>Terry Durbin</strong>: (shakes her head) I don't know. Kids get hurt all the time. They fall down, cut themselves ... get nosebleeds.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What are you telling me, that a kid that you've never seen, a kid who's not even friends with your son, got a nosebleed in your house? Huh? You're lying. You know, we can make this quick, 'cause I got enough to arrest you right now.</p>
<p><strong>Owen Durbin</strong>: Look, it was an accident. All right, Travis came over one night, said he wanted to buy a knife.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [NIGHT] Owen Durbin meets with Travis Durbin.)</p>
<p><strong>Owen Durbin</strong>: (V.O.) So I gave him a knife. He said he couldn't pay. He tried to run.</p>
<p>(Travis grabs the knife and bumps into the wall and into the knife, stabbing himself. He falls down the stairs.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Owen Durbin</strong>: Wasn't moving, he was just lying there, knife stuck in him.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Now you're lying. </p>
<p><strong>Terry Durbin</strong>: Don't you call my son a liar.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Travis was stabbed twice. That's not possible if he just fell on the knife.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So what happened? He piss you off? Get in a fight? Maybe called you a mama's boy? Or did you just want to see what it felt like to stab somebody?</p>
<p><strong>Owen Durbin</strong>: Like I told you, it was an accident.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Then why did you dump the body down a sewer in the middle of the night?</p>
<p><strong>Terry Durbin</strong>: He didn't. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: He didn't do it alone. We found the victim's charred clothing folded. Kids don't fold anything, mothers do. You helped him clean up the mess.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, that's kind of funny, because, um, you're not much of a housekeeper.</p>
<p><strong>Owen Durbin</strong>: If you talk to my mother like that again, I'll kill you.</p>
<p><strong>Terry Durbin</strong>: Don't you say another word, baby.</p>
<p><strong>Owen Durbin</strong>: I'll kill both of you.</p>
<p><strong>Terry Durbin</strong>: I want a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, we really don't need a confession.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - GRISSOM'S OFFICE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Brass holds a drink in his hand as he talks with Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, the kid gets murder, mom's an accessory, and dad gets felony explosives. It's a family-value pack.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, it's appropriate. One way or another, they each had a hand in it.</p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH:</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - A/V LAB - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Sara is watching the video tapes from Owen's bedroom.)</p>
<p><strong>Terry Durbin</strong>: (o.s.) Come on, Roger. Do we have to?</p>
<p><strong>Roger Durbin</strong>: (from monitor) Just keep the camera on it, will ya? Watch.</p>
<p>(Roger ties some explosives to the head of a large frog.)</p>
<p>(He goes and stands next to Young Owen. The frog croaks. Off screen, the explosives detonate. Roger laughs.)</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - GRISSOM'S OFFICE - NIGHT]</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Violent environment, oblivious mother, disturbed child.</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - A/V LAB - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(On the monitor, Roger leads Young Owen to a large pot filled halfway with unidentifiable liquid.)</p>
<p><strong>Roger Durbin</strong>: (from video) Here, stir this.</p>
<p><strong>Young Owen Durbin</strong>: (from video) What's it for?</p>
<p><strong>Roger Durbin</strong>: (from video) Blowing stuff up.</p>
<p>(Roger laughs.)</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - GRISSOM'S OFFICE - NIGHT]</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: But you know, no matter how bad your kid turns out, it never changes how you feel about him.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Unconditional love between parents and offspring is biological, perpetuates the species.</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - A/V LAB - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(On the video, Young Owen Durbin stirs the pot.) </p>
<p><strong>Roger Durbin</strong>: (from video) Go ahead. That's good.</p>
<p>(Sara watches the video.) </p>
<p><strong>Roger Durbin</strong>: (from video) That's good. Get it good.</p>
<p>(Roger Durbin laughs.)</p>
<p>(The video monitor zooms in on Young Owen Durbin stirring the pot.) </p>

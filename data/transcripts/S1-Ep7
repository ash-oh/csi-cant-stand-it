[EXT. COLLINS' HOUSE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Camera opens on the front of the Collins' mail box. The sprinkler system is on.)</p>
<p>(Camera pushes in slowly to the bunny lawn decorations near the mail box.)</p>
<p>(The sprinkler system shuts off.)</p>
<p>(After a moment, the front door opens and a woman screams.)</p>
<p><strong>Tina Collins</strong>: (screaming) Help me! </p>
<p>(TINA COLLINS runs out of the house.)</p>
<p><strong>Tina Collins</strong>: (screaming) Oh, god, help me! Somebody, please! Please ... oh, god! Somebody help me!</p>
<p>(TINA COLLINS runs across the front lawn and out into the street, still screaming at the top of her lungs.)</p>
<p><strong>Tina Collins</strong>: Please! Help me! Help me!</p>
<p>(She runs to the next door neighbor's, the lights in the house having turned on at the screams.)</p>
<p><strong>Tina Collins</strong>: Help me! Help me! Please!</p>
<p>(She reaches the front door and starts pounding on it.)</p>
<p><strong>Cue Sound</strong>: (PRELAP) AMBULANCE SIREN WAILING</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. NEIGHBORHOOLD - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Emergency vehicles and Officer cars surround the house. GRISSOM drives up to the scene, the dispatch radio on in his car.) </p>
<p>(GRISSOM parks the car and exits the vehicle. He meets up with DET. O'RILEY. They head for the house.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Det. O'Riley</strong>: Heads up. The press is going to be all over this one.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did the count change since you called me?</p>
<p><strong>Det. O'Riley</strong>: Four dead: Mother, father, two teenage boys. The sisters were luckier. </p>
<p>(He points to a girl talking with an officer off to the side. She has a blanket wrapped around her.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. O'Riley</strong>: Teen girl heard a noise, hid in the closet. Alerted the neighbors after all the shouting was done. </p>
<p>(He points to a little girl sitting in the front seat of the police car.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. O'Riley</strong>: Younger sister's over there. They couldn't have killed their father tag team -- soaking wet.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at the house and sees an OFFICER run out of the house, a handkerchief pressed tightly to his mouth. He rushes toward the bushes at the side of the house to throw up.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What's the matter with your guys?</p>
<p><strong>Det. O'Riley</strong>: They've been inside.</p>
<p>(DET. O'RILEY puts his notebook into his coat pocket and walks away.)</p>
<p>(Grimly, GRISSOM stares at the house. He sighs.)</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO: END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<hr />
[EXT. COLLINS HOUSE - NEAR FRONT DOOR -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and SHIBLEY walk toward the open front door.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Put your equipment down, son. </p>
<p>(SHIBLEY puts his kit down. GRISSOM signs in and hands the board back to the officer at the door. He hands a pair of latex gloves to SHIBLEY. GRISSOM'S thoughts are at what lies beyond. GRISSOM puts his own gloves up.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Put these on. I'm going to do a preliminary walk-through. You're going to take my notes. </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. COLLINS' HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and SHIBELY walk inside.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks around. He sees the framed family photograph on the wall.)</p>
<p>(SHIBLEY also looks around and sees the light switch. He moves to turn it on. GRISSOM stops him.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Don't touch that! I want everything exactly the way it was. </p>
<p>(SHIBLEY withdraws. GRISSOM looks around and sees the stairs leading up to the second floor. On the way up, they pass more framed family photographs hanging on the wall.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The air smells like copper. Lots of blood. Breathe through your mouth.</p>
<p><strong>Shibley</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p>(On the stairway, they pass a statue of a rabbit in front of a photograph of rabbits.)</p>
<p>(They reach the second floor.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. COLLINS HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - HALLWAY - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(The first thing they see down the hallway is a pair of feet of the first dead body. There is blood spatter on the hallway walls. GRISSOM turns the corner and looks down at the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Male caucasian approximately 40 years old lying in a pool of blood. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks cautiously around the body. SHIBLEY appears and takes a look at the body as he writes. GRISSOM kneels down next to the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No drag marks. Body does not appear to have been moved. Multiple stab wounds to the back and neck. Looks like a single-edged blade. Force to such a degree that the left and right internal jugular veins have been transected. Head faces west. Feet pointing east. Approximately two feet from the north wall, one foot from the south.</p>
<p><strong>Shibley</strong>: (swallows as he's getting sick) Could ... could you take your own notes? I think that I'm going to be sick.</p>
<p>(Behind him, SARA appears. She looks at SHIBLEY and grabs the clipboard from him.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I got it. Go get some fresh air. </p>
<p>(SHIBLEY leaves, coughing as he goes. GRISSOM stares at SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I heard on the scanner. Quadruple. Figured you might need a hand.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You don't sleep, do you?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (shakes her head, unoffended) No. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns back to look around. SARA also looks around and latches on the bullseye symbol on the wall.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Blood swirl on the wall. Are you thinking cult? Manson?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (shakes his head, he doesn't know) Somebody left a message. I need to see the rest of it.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks around.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. COLLINS HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and SARA walk into the Master Bedroom. They walk toward the bed. On the bed, Mrs. Collins is dead.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM recites; SARA writes.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Female Caucasian. Appears to be one stab wound to the throat. Transection of left and right carotid arteries with exsanguinating hemorrhage. No defense marks. Cursory opinion: She was killed in her sleep.</p>
<p>(SARA looks around. Listening. GRISSOM also stops and looks around. In the silence, they can hear it. Something's dripping.)</p>
<p>(They both lean in toward the body.)</p>
<p>(Her blood hasn't clotted and is dripping down her fingertips to the floor.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (sighs) Do you feel this?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (nods) (quietly) Her soul's still in the room.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: But there's something else.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. COLLINS HOUSE - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(SARA takes a picture of the dead woman. GRISSOM walks out of the room and down the hall. He follows the blood spatter on the floor back to the body of MR. COLLINS.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM stops in front of the door that MR. COLLINS is in front of. It's BRENDA'S room. GRISSOM pushes the door open and walks into the room. He looks around. It appears to be a normal little girl's room.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: GRISSOM pushes the door open and walks into the sons' room. One of the boys is dead on the bed. GRISSOM lifts the sheet and looks underneath.)</p>
<p>(He checks the windows.)</p>
<p>(He looks at the other empty bed in the room. On the mirror is another bull's eye symbol. GRISSOM walks toward it and looks at it.)</p>
<p>(In the mirror's reflection, he finds the second son's body on the floor between the bed and the wall. He turns around to look at the body. The little boy was stabbed in the back. GRISSOM looks up and sees two bloodied hand prints on the wall. He closes his eyes at the sight.)</p>
<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. COLLINS' RESIDENCE - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks out of the house. He walks up to DET. O'RILEY.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. O'Riley</strong>: You want a barf bag?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (firmly) I want the paramedics that were in this house back here immediately -- police escort. Get them on this front lawn now.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks up to the next OFFICER.)</p>
<p>DET. O'RIELY: You'd think I work for you instead of the other way around.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to the OFFICER) Call dispatch. You tell my entire graveyard shift that I want them here ASAP -- all of them-- no exceptions. </p>
<p>(The OFFICER leaves. GRISSOM turns to look at SARA.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sara, those photos -- blown up times ten. Tell the lab that we need every forensics tool available to us here right away. This is the only crime scene in Las Vegas tonight.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns and walks away.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. COLLINS HOUSE - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(A reporter standing outside the house gives her news report.)</p>
<p><strong>Reporter 1 (woman)</strong>: The fear in this neighborhood just South of Las Vegas Boulevard is almost palpable. Scott Collins, his wife and two sons were brutally murdered in their beds. </p>
<p>(Camera moves past the woman reporter to another woman reporter behind her ... )</p>
<p><strong>Reporter 2 (woman)</strong>: ... the murder of four innocent ...</p>
<p>(Camera moves past the camera view screen for the first reporter ... )</p>
<p><strong>Reporter 1 (woman)</strong>: Authorities thus far have offered no comment fueling the fears of the neighbors that a killer is on the loose.</p>
<p><strong>Reporter 3 (man)</strong>: (o.s.) ... A multiple murder. And we will have more on this ...</p>
<p>(Camera lingers on the neighbors standing outside and watching.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. COLLINS HOUSE - FRONT LAWN - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks up to DET. O'RILEY who is talking with TINA COLLINS.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. O'Riley</strong>: It's okay. We'll give you clothes. The lab guys just want to see yours.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sergeant, may I?</p>
<p>(DET. O'RILEY steps aside. GRISSOM looks at TINA.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Tina ... I'm very sorry about what happened to you tonight. But everything we take from your house can help us find out what happened to your family.</p>
<p><strong>Tina Collins</strong>: (crying) When can I be with my sister? She's so scared.</p>
<p>(TINA looks over at BRENDA who is sitting quietly in the front of the police car.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Soon. Detective?</p>
<p>(A woman detective steps up to stand next to TINA COLLINS. GRISSOM turns and heads for the police car.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. COLLINS HOUSE - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks up to the police car.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to the OFFICER) Thanks.</p>
<p>(The OFFICER steps aside and GRISSOM kneels down in front of BRENDA COLLINS. BRENDA doesn't look at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hi. Is your name Brenda? </p>
<p>(BRENDA blinks, then looks at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm trying to find out who hurt your family. Do you think you could help me? Did anyone come into your room tonight? Through the door? Through the window maybe? </p>
<p>(BRENDA doesn't say anything.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (nods) Okay.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM stands up and turns to leave. BRENDA stops him.)</p>
<p><strong>Brenda Collins</strong>: (softly) The buffalo.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns around to look at BRENDA. He kneels back down in front of her.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The buffalo? Who's the buffalo? </p>
<p>(BRENDA doesn't respond. And she doesn't look at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Brenda?</p>
<p>(Sensing he's not going to get any more from her, he stands up and leaves. BRENDA watches him go.)</p>
<p>BLUR OUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. COLLINS RESIDENCE - NIGHT - SHORT TIME LATER]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks up to NICK, CATHERINE and WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: First rule for this crime scene: Do not do any interviews. Second rule: Don't talk to the Sheriff either.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Media have it right? Four dead?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The killer was here not two hours ago. He left part of himself behind. Catherine, I need you inside, mapping and blood samples.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Nick, Warrick-- the perimeter. I want to know how he got here how he got in, how he got out, and how he left.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I'll take the back. Warrick, you get the front?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p>(Cut to: A blurry image of the American flag.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: Various shots of the spectators standing around watching.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: The media crowd out in the front lawn.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM heads back into the house.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: DET. O'RILEY stands next to REPORTER 1 (WOMAN). He looks up when someone calls his name.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: (o.s.) Hey, O'Riley, Grissom wants to see you.</p>
<p>(He ducks under the crime scene tape and heads back toward the house.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. COLLINS HOUSE - KITCHEN -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks cautiously in the kitchen. DET. O'RILEY walks into the kitchen.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. O'Riley</strong>: They said you were looking for me.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hey, stop! Evidence!</p>
<p>(DET. O'RILEY stops and changes his course, staying off of the main floor and on the sides of the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. O'Riley</strong>: We got to hug the wall? This is the only room with no blood in it. There's nothing to disturb.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You guys will never get it, will you?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM continues to look around and notices the open knife drawer. He reaches over and pulls it open.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Knife drawer. One missing.</p>
<p><strong>Det. O'Riley</strong>: It's the only drawer open. The killer knew where they were going.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I think the suspect's been in this house before. And this is the first place they stopped tonight. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks down at the floor.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Good. Linoleum. The best surface.</p>
<p><strong>Det. O'Riley</strong>: Best surface for what?</p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO:</p>
<p>(GRISSOM is on his hands and knees mere inches from the floor holding a special light. He finds some shoe prints.)</p>
<p>(Short time cut to: GRISSOM has the print lifter on the floor.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. O'Riley</strong>: (o.s.) You guys got some toys ...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's not a toy, O'Riley. It's an electrostatic dust print lifter.</p>
<p><strong>Det. O'Riley</strong>: Okay ... </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Like a supercharged lint remover only it lifts footprints. Possibly our killer's.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM flips the sheet over and on the other side is a clear image of the shoe print.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. COLLINS HOUSE - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM questions the paramedics.)</p>
<p><strong>EMS #1</strong>: We did everything by the book, sir.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Relax. I just want to know where you walked in the house and who you touched in there.</p>
<p><strong>EMS #1</strong>: Well, we did use the main entry, and up the stairs. But once we saw the husband, we grabbed the walls. I felt the pulses in each room. Once I found they were dead, we booked.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Show me the bottom of your shoe.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes the shoe print and checks it against the EMS's.)</p>
<p>(The first one is not a match.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Now yours. </p>
<p>(The second EMS's shoes match the prints found in the kitchen. He stands up.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You fellows were both in the kitchen.</p>
<p><strong>EMS #1</strong>: We didn't see any bodies in there so I didn't think twice about walking on the surface.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: All right. Yours are the only clean prints I found. Thanks. You can go back to work.</p>
<p>(The paramedics leave. DET. O'RILEY walks up to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. O'Riley</strong>: News bim's waiting for you. Thinks you have an &quot;interesting look.&quot;</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks over at the media hanging just outside the crime scene tape.)</p>
<p><strong>Reporter 1 (woman)</strong>: Any truth to the rumor that a cult may have committed these crimes?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I don't know that.</p>
<p><strong>Reporter 1 (woman)</strong>: But you wouldn't rule it out?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I don't rule anything out.</p>
<p>(That small tidbid seemed to satisfy the news media. From behind him, someone calls him.)</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: Grissom.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sheriff?</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: The mayor has already called. So what have you got?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: I'm not asking you to lay out your whole case. Just give me something I can run with. I have got to feed the press and defuse the panic.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: As soon as I have something, you'll have something.</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: Here's a thought. Why don't you try being more like Ecklie?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I could speak volumes about Conrad Ecklie, but I have a crime scene to process so ... you'll have to excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>Reporter 1 (woman)</strong>: Sheriff, can you tell me what went on inside?</p>
<p>(SHERIFF walks over to the media and talks with them.)</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: Let me assure everyone that the situation is well under control. We don't have any suspects at this time, but our forensic crew ...</p>

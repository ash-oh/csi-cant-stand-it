							<p>I have been thinking about us a lot, though. All the moments.</p>
<p>I thought we could survive anything.</p>
<p>This trip has given me a lot of clarity.</p>
<p>That last year in Vegas, I could barely breathe, let alone...think.</p>
<p>Hey, Officers! I need your help.</p>
<p>We've got to preserve those tire tracks.</p>
<p>Take your stick, dig a trench.</p>
<p>Got to divert the water.</p>
<p>Catherine?</p>
<p>You covered the body with a tarp.</p>
<p>You contaminated the evidence.</p>
<p>First responder tarped it before I even arrived. Thought he was helping out.</p>
<p>I should be giving you grief. You were out.</p>
<p>Dispatch said you didn't acknowledge.</p>
<p>What do you know?</p>
<p>Trucker spotted the body.</p>
<p>Called it in.</p>
<p>Face is embedded with asphalt.</p>
<p>Got here as fast as I could.</p>
<p>See if he's got any I.D.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>Rigidity hasn't extended into the limbs. The lividity's blanching.</p>
<p>Probably been dead two to four hours.</p>
<p>Fingers and toes are gone.</p>
<p>Ligature marks around the posterior aspect of both wrists.</p>
<p>Tied up and dragged?</p>
<p>Well, then the rest of his body should look like hamburger. Roll him.</p>
<p>Burnt motor oil.</p>
<p>And his shirt looks like it was scorched.</p>
<p>He could have been tied to the undercarriage of a vehicle.</p>
<p>A vehicle with a high ground clearance. Truck or S.U.V.</p>
<p>We got to get this body out of here. Where are the easy-ups?</p>
<p>They're on their way.</p>
<p>Before I left, um, you said some things that I tried not to hear, but now, uh, I think you were right.</p>
<p>CSI Season 9 Episode 5</p>
<p>Looks like Hawk here played softball for Talmadge Media.</p>
<p>I'll have Brass run down his real name.</p>
<p>Two, three, four. Seven, eight, nine stab wounds in his shirt?</p>
<p>What's the matter, you got a migraine?</p>
<p>No. Go call Brass.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Well, I still have to do the paperwork and fill out a tox request on a hit-and-run.</p>
<p>Tissue was white, so, no blood flow.</p>
<p>Means, what happened to the face happened postmortem.</p>
<p>I can see his brains through his nasal cavities. That's cool.</p>
<p>Well, B.R.B.</p>
<p>Be right back.</p>
<p>My wife's got me into texting now.</p>
<p>No, that's it, Jim. Thanks.</p>
<p>Rope marks on the upper and lower torso, but no bruising.</p>
<p>Postmortem. So are the stab wounds.</p>
<p>Nipples are swollen.</p>
<p>And it looks like puncture wounds around the areola.</p>
<p>If it was tattooing, there'd be ink.</p>
<p>Piercing, there'd be metal.</p>
<p>I don't know, man. A kinky way to shoot up drugs?</p>
<p>I'll have Robbins work up a histo.</p>
<p>Eight and three quarter-inch tread width.</p>
<p>So, that's consistent with a small truck or S.U.V.</p>
<p>Boy, there must be a lot of clay in this soil.</p>
<p>Otherwise, this track would have totally washed away.</p>
<p>My shoes are ruined.</p>
<p>Why didn't you tell me to wear boots?</p>
<p>Or, better yet, hire some more CSIs.</p>
<p>Trust me, you were my last choice.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Catherine, man down!</p>
<p>Found a rope. Got a splinter.</p>
<p>Think I pierced an artery.</p>
<p>It looks like blood.</p>
<p>Nylon rope.</p>
<p>Must have been used to tie the body to the undercarriage.</p>
<p>When the rope melted, body dropped onto the road.</p>
<p>Killer's driving along.</p>
<p>Loses his cargo, pulls over, and drags the body out into the desert.</p>
<p>Must have been an accidental body dump.</p>
<p>Why go to the trouble to tie it up under the car in the first place?</p>
<p>Because if a cop stop you, they're going to look inside the car, not underneath it.</p>
<p>Let me take a walk through. Hang back a second.</p>
<p>All clear.</p>
<p>No sign of forced entry.</p>
<p>Apart from us.</p>
<p>Why don't you take this?</p>
<p>I'll check the back.</p>
<p>Well, I got an I. D.</p>
<p>Ian Wallace was a good-looking kid.</p>
<p>Smells like citrus.</p>
<p>Got a blood drop with an air bubble.</p>
<p>Got to be saliva.</p>
<p>Hey, somebody got punched.</p>
<p>Found more blood.</p>
<p>Somebody tried to clean up.</p>
<p>Ran tox on hamburger head.</p>
<p>Low levels of THC and alcohol.</p>
<p>For what's it worth, I don't think he was injecting weed or beer into his nipples.</p>
<p>Although, this one time, Hodges and I were growing botox, and he goes, and he injects it.</p>
<p>It's okay, Henry. I don't need to know any more.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>♪♪♪</p>
<p>Hello from below the equator and Puerto Ayora.</p>
<p>We've been at sea over a month now.</p>
<p>You wouldn't believe the crew.</p>
<p>Students, activists, scientists.</p>
<p>The dinner conversations alone are mind-blowing.</p>
<p>There's even this, uh, marine biologist that reminds me a little bit of you.</p>
<p>I wish that we could talk in person, but, uh, this is the best that I can do.</p>
<p>I want to apologize for being out of touch.</p>
<p>I have been thinking about us a lot, though. All the moments.</p>
<p>I thought we could survive anything.</p>
<p>This trip has given me a lot of clarity.</p>
<p>That last year in Vegas, I could barely breathe, let alone...think, but, um, now, for the first time in a really long time, I'm happy.</p>
<p>Ian's sports car is in the garage. Other spot's empty.</p>
<p>I did find some fresh oil stains and rope burns, though.</p>
<p>So, I'm thinking the killer probably pulled his truck into the garage.</p>
<p>Would have given him plenty of time to tie up the body.</p>
<p>Back door's unlocked. Anybody could have gotten in here.</p>
<p>Victim definitely lived with a chick.</p>
<p>Napkin holders, heart-shaped pillows.</p>
<p>Women's' magazines.</p>
<p>Yeah. Where is she?</p>
<p>I don't see a purse around here.</p>
<p>Maybe she roped him to the bottom of her truck and split.</p>
<p>I got a name.</p>
<p>Justine Stefani.</p>
<p>Okay. I'll have Brass put out a broadcast.</p>
<p>Puncture wounds didn't penetrate any of the significant blood vessels.</p>
<p>And there's no evidence of injection or scar tissue, so that rules out drug abuse.</p>
<p>Punctures were made by 18-gauge needles which pierced the areola.</p>
<p>They were arranged in a symmetrical pattern around the nipples.</p>
<p>Have you ever seen this?</p>
<p>Never.</p>
<p>Or this.</p>
<p>What appear to be minor burn marks on the upper and lower surfaces of the tongue.</p>
<p>There are no other burn marks in the oral cavity.</p>
<p>Histo confirmed the burns were electrical.</p>
<p>They grilled his tongue? That's sick.</p>
<p>Torture.</p>
<p>That would be my opinion at this time.</p>
<p>COD?</p>
<p>Manual asphyxia. Bruising around the trachea. Broken hyoid bone.</p>
<p>Killer strangled him with his bare hands.</p>
<p>So, Ian Wallace was restrained, his nipples were stimulated, he had minor burns on his tongue, and he was asphyxiated.</p>
<p>S and M?</p>
<p>Gone very, very wrong.</p>
<p>These stab wounds are brutal, random and postmortem.</p>
<p>Which is inconsistent with S&amp;M.</p>
<p>Well, it's hard to take pleasure in someone's pain once they're dead.</p>
<p>Which is the &quot;gone wrong&quot; part.</p>
<p>You're a doctor is that normal?</p>
<p>Grissom being socially awkward? Yeah, that's normal.</p>
<p>He won't talk to me.</p>
<p>And he doesn't appear to be sleeping much.</p>
<p>Grissom.</p>
<p>What are you doing here?</p>
<p>I should have called. I'm sorry. I...</p>
<p>I didn't know I was coming.</p>
<p>What do you want?</p>
<p>Thank you When was the last time you had a good night's sleep?</p>
<p>Bad dreams.</p>
<p>How can I help?</p>
<p>I, uh... have a body with S&amp;M type wounds, but there are inconsistencies.</p>
<p>So I was hoping to get your first impressions.</p>
<p>My first impression... is that you've changed.</p>
<p>Come on.</p>
<p>How have you been?</p>
<p>I got my Masters in psychology last year. I'm a licensed therapist.</p>
<p>I now have patients, not clients.</p>
<p>Let me guess you specialize in s*x therapy?</p>
<p>These wounds around his nipples are from needle play.</p>
<p>The arrangement is called &quot;stacking.</p>
<p>&quot; May I touch you?</p>
<p>Needles are inserted transversely and sagittally, which raises the nipple upward.</p>
<p>This causes the nipple to swell and become highly sensitive.</p>
<p>Which creates a &quot;pain&quot; button.</p>
<p>Any touch or pressure overwhelms the senses and releases a flood of endorphins.</p>
<p>So, uh... our victim is a submissive who enjoyed pain?</p>
<p>He also had electrical burns on his tongue.</p>
<p>Now I'm familiar with the use of gags in S&amp;M. And some are metal.</p>
<p>Did you ever use electricity?</p>
<p>I never used electricity above the waist.</p>
<p>It only takes six milliamps to stop the heart. It's too dangerous.</p>
<p>This is tongue bondage. It's used in medical exam fantasies as part of humiliation.</p>
<p>You ask the &quot;patient&quot; to stick out their tongue, grab the tongue with chopsticks, rubber band them to create a dental gag.</p>
<p>In a typical situation, one would use wood chopsticks, which would leave some bruising and if you're lucky, splinters.</p>
<p>In this case, metal chopsticks may have been used and electricity applied.</p>
<p>These are masochistic injuries.</p>
<p>So we're looking for a dominant?</p>
<p>He lived with a woman.</p>
<p>Was she into the lifestyle?</p>
<p>We don't know. She's missing.</p>
<p>I'd like to see photos of their bedroom.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's obvious.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's not.</p>
<p>All right, copy that.</p>
<p>I'll efax you the over-alls if we find anything.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Grissom wants us to look for any S&amp;M paraphernalia.</p>
<p>Once had a old lady in her 70's burglary victim.</p>
<p>Had to process her vibrators.</p>
<p>Some of them were burned out.</p>
<p>Why would you process her... tuning forks?</p>
<p>I'm thorough.</p>
<p>I got a booty smudge on the TV.</p>
<p>Justine super-sized herself.</p>
<p>Double-D implants.</p>
<p>Welcome to Vegas.</p>
<p>Positive for semen.</p>
<p>What does it say about me that I always find the smut?</p>
<p>That you're lucky.</p>
<p>Guess they were into S&amp;M.</p>
<p>You ever been tied up?</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
<p>I think you're more into hair pulling.</p>
<p>Knock it off.</p>
<p>Give me some pictures of that stuff, will ya?</p>
<p>Got a bloody shirt in a laundry basket.</p>
<p>Bloodstains match the puncture marks on Ian's pecs.</p>
<p>Which means he must have changed his shirt after the nipple action, but before he was killed.</p>
<p>Girlfriend could've redressed him, tossed the shirt in the basket out of habit.</p>
<p>Yeah, and then what?</p>
<p>Little Justine ties 200 pounds of dead weight up under her SUV?</p>
<p>Well, I could do it. It's just physics and leverage.</p>
<p>Takes brains not brawn.</p>
<p>I don't think you could.</p>
<p>I think you could do it. The killing part, too.</p>
<p>The trunk contains male slave gear.</p>
<p>Needle and electro play requires special equipment.</p>
<p>I don't see any dedicated S&amp;M room. So he didn't play at home.</p>
<p>Do you think he went to a professional?</p>
<p>Lower Linx is part of the amateur scene.</p>
<p>It has a well-equipped back room.</p>
<p>You have to know the right people. Rents by the hour.</p>
<p>It's a proven sociological fact that the public won't commingle with cops.</p>
<p>I try not to take it personally.</p>
<p>Yeah, me neither.</p>
<p>I'd like to talk to the owner.</p>
<p>Michelle Tournay. All my licenses are current. What do you want?</p>
<p>You recognize these people?</p>
<p>Do you have any security cameras?</p>
<p>Being Big Brother's your job.</p>
<p>Well, Big Brother would like to see the back room.</p>
<p>You know what I mean the real back room.</p>
<p>I'm done cooperating. Get a warrant.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That could take a couple of hours.</p>
<p>We'll wait.</p>
<p>Got a menu?</p>
<p>Who else has a key to this room?</p>
<p>Only me.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Looks like an oscilloscope.</p>
<p>This is the juice right here.</p>
<p>Hey, Jim, check it out.</p>
<p>Chopsticks.</p>
<p>What's the word?</p>
<p>s*x.</p>
<p>That love juice from near the TV was a mixture of seminal fluid and vaginal secretions.</p>
<p>Ian and his girlfriend?</p>
<p>Well, yes on him, but assuming that that was her toothbrush you gave me, definitely no on her.</p>
<p>That's motive.</p>
<p>Dom-girlfriend finds her man doing the nasty with some hood rat in their bedroom and kills him.</p>
<p>Yeah... I found more.</p>
<p>It's on the shirt that you gave me from Ian Wallace's laundry basket.</p>
<p>High-velocity blood stains?</p>
<p>Our victim wasn't shot.</p>
<p>No, but sometimes expiratory blood can actually mimic high-velocity gunshot spatter.</p>
<p>It's on the back of the shoulder. It's probably not his.</p>
<p>Maybe he's got the killer on his back.</p>
<p>Before I left, uh, you said some things that I tried not to hear, but now, uh, I think you were right.</p>
<p>If a relationship can't move forward, it withers.</p>
<p>There's a schism between the lovers.</p>
<p>Ian and Justine have different priorities, different roles.</p>
<p>She's the keeper of the hearth sentimental, traditional.</p>
<p>Mass card and rosary in her nightstand.</p>
<p>A good girl, afraid of the dark.</p>
<p>What about him?</p>
<p>Ian liked to compartmentalize.</p>
<p>It made him feel safe.</p>
<p>Everything had its place. Work, her, sports.</p>
<p>He kept his dark side locked in a trunk, hidden away from her.</p>
<p>Does Sara know you're here?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Am I your secret?</p>
<p>No, and you're not my therapist.</p>
<p>They found some evidence that Ian may have had s*x with another woman in their house.</p>
<p>That's his subconscious desire to be caught and punished, which is why he chose Justine as a partner.</p>
<p>He's got a mommy to hide things from.</p>
<p>The Virgin Mother.</p>
<p>Justine is an enabler, not a dominant.</p>
<p>Even if she discovered his infidelities, she couldn't harm him.</p>
<p>She's not your killer.</p>
<p>The Boulder City cop was able to run the burnt license plate.</p>
<p>The registered owner is Justine Stefani.</p>
<p>I'm guessing we're about 20 miles southeast of the original crime scene.</p>
<p>Those are breast implants.</p>
<p>Unlike most plastic, silicone is extremely heat resistant.</p>
<p>Justine Stefani had fake boobs. I saw a photo of her.</p>
<p>Doc Robbins will be able to match the serial numbers of those implants and confirm her identity.</p>
<p>Which our suspect is now a victom.</p>
<p>Serial numbers from the breast implants confirm the victim is Justine Stefani.</p>
<p>Dave, do you want to flip her over?</p>
<p>Third-degree burns over 75% of her body.</p>
<p>Doc, take a look.</p>
<p>The victim's arms were bound.</p>
<p>Ligature marks are ante-mortem.</p>
<p>Found a set of shoe impressions heading away from the highway.</p>
<p>Tire impressions followed them.</p>
<p>Found Justine's boots under the vehicle.</p>
<p>C.O.D. was multiple traumatic injuries homicide.</p>
<p>Compound fractures to both femurs indicate impact back to front.</p>
<p>Fractures are inconsistent with passenger injuries, but consistent with a pedestrian being hit by a vehicle.</p>
<p>Found a clump of Justine's hair on the skid plate.</p>
<p>She was ultimately killed by her own SUV.</p>
<p>Axle was cracked, making the vehicle undriveable, which is probably why the killer torched it.</p>
<p>A second set of impressions were consistent with a size nine athletic shoe.</p>
<p>The foot trail ended at separate set of tisions just off the road.</p>
<p>The killer may have flagged down a passing motorist or had an accomplice.</p>
<p>So we have two new suspects.</p>
<p>One of whom wears a size nine shoe, which is the equivalent of a woman's size 11.</p>
<p>The other suspect drives a vehicle with two different brands of tires.</p>
<p>Front were Pirelli P-235 70R 15s.</p>
<p>Rear were same size Michelin.</p>
<p>Can't narrow it down.</p>
<p>We know that Ian was killed at the house and transported in Justine's car, so Justine had to have been kidnapped from the house.</p>
<p>So whatever started at the Lower Linx ended at their house.</p>
<p>She must have walked in on it.</p>
<p>Why not just kill her there?</p>
<p>I mean, if you take a live female victim, there's a reason.</p>
<p>You want to take your time with her.</p>
<p>I did collect these metal chopsticks from the Lower Linx.</p>
<p>They're used in tongue bondage.</p>
<p>Now, the center saliva DNA is a match to Ian Wallace, but on the ends, the epithelial DNA, unknown female.</p>
<p>It did, however, match the DNA profile from the vaginal secretions at the house.</p>
<p>So Ian was sleeping with his dom.</p>
<p>You know, I got a real dominatrix vibe from Miss Tournay.</p>
<p>Her and Lady Heather could be sisters.</p>
<p>Who's Lady Heather?</p>
<p>Oh, that's a whole other Oprah.</p>
<p>Changing the channel, do we have enough to get a warrant for Ms.Tournay's DNA?</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so. I'll talk to the DA.</p>
<p>Oh, we also might have a lead on the other suspect.</p>
<p>I ran Justine's phone records.</p>
<p>Last incoming call was from a Martin Devlin at 8:12 P.M.</p>
<p>I have tremendous respect for law enforcement.</p>
<p>Risking your lives every day for so little reward.</p>
<p>How'd you get Justine Stefani's phone number?</p>
<p>Got it off a warm call list.</p>
<p>She was a Web site surfer, Jim.</p>
<p>Left her contact info.</p>
<p><div class="ads ads-topic topic-content"><br />
<ins class="adsbygoogle transcripts-topic-in-post" style="display:inline-block" data-full-width-responsive="true" data-ad-client="ca-pub-3808023418243141" data-ad-slot="1728561479"></ins>
<p><script>(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});</script></div></p>
<p>What'd you two talk about?</p>
<p>Life insurance, term for her and her soon-to-be fianc? She was a planner.</p>
<p>Did you talk to the boyfriend?</p>
<p>Only her, Jim.</p>
<p>You ever been to their house?</p>
<p>No, it was one phone call.</p>
<p>Chatted her up and talked some turkey.</p>
<p>Oh, did you close her on the insurance?</p>
<p>I had her going, then out of the blue, she hangs up.</p>
<p>Yeah, I lost that fish.</p>
<p>Sorry I can't be of more help, Jim. I...</p>
<p>But meeting me could be the best thing that ever happened to you.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah?</p>
<p>You see, most cops are under-insured.</p>
<p>And it's your family that'll suffer.</p>
<p>I can hook you up with catastrophic life, an umbrella policy and car insurance in less than ten minutes and it'll save you money.</p>
<p>Thanks. I'm all set.Thanks.</p>
<p>In the heterosexual world, men want to be dominated by women. and women by men.</p>
<p>So Wallace would have had a female dominant.</p>
<p>Well, we've confirmed that through physical evidence. She also slept with him.</p>
<p>Which is why one should always go to a professional. They know the boundaries.</p>
<p>I feel the same way about crime scene investigators.</p>
<p>And no one has more rigid boundaries than you.</p>
<p>We know there was at least one killer, but there may have been two.</p>
<p>But we don't know if it was a man or a woman.</p>
<p>If your dominant is the killer, she would most likely choose a slave to assist her.</p>
<p>Someone she could trust and control.</p>
<p>Which would be a man.</p>
<p>Amateurs often play scenes in groups.</p>
<p>And the dom would select slaves who share similar fantasies and fetishes.</p>
<p>Why did you lie to us about knowing Ian Wallace?</p>
<p>We have physical evidence linking him to your S&amp;M room, so we know you know him.</p>
<p>You had no right to ask the question, therefore I had no obligation to answer it.</p>
<p>I have a warrant to collect buccal swabs, take all your shoes, and search you SUV.</p>
<p>What do you need the stuff for?</p>
<p>Doesn't matter. I have a warrant. I can take it.</p>
<p>So why don't you tell me what's going on?</p>
<p>Yes, I facilitate people's BDS&amp;M scenes.</p>
<p>It's a way to make money.</p>
<p>It's not something I practice.</p>
<p>I'm an entrepreneur.</p>
<p>I majored in theater.</p>
<p>Don't you get it?</p>
<p>I get that you're looking at two counts of capital murder.</p>
<p>I hope you're a good actress.</p>
<p>Look, Ian came in a lot.</p>
<p>Got to know each other, I ended up sleeping with him.</p>
<p>At his house. We know that, too.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I have rules.</p>
<p>I'm not uptight about s*x, but I like my privacy.</p>
<p>Never been to his house, he'd never been to mine.</p>
<p>Open wide.</p>
<p>I'm not letting you take my DNA and put it in some system where it's gonna stay the rest of my life.</p>
<p>If you're innocent, what does it matter?</p>
<p>That just proves you're a fascist and this is a police state.</p>
<p>Help me out here, will you, Mitch?</p>
<p>Ma'am, if you don't let the CSI do his job, I'm gonna have to arrest you for obstruction.</p>
<p>Turned you on, didn't it? Bet you're standing at attention.</p>
<p>Hypocrite.</p>
<p>You're no different than the freaks that rent my back room.</p>
<p>So I got a match from that high-velocity bloodstain on the Ian Wallace shirt.</p>
<p>Your suspect has seven out of 13 alleles in common with a convicted felon named George Devlin.</p>
<p>Look, he's still serving time.</p>
<p>Justine got a call from a Martin Devlin the night she died.</p>
<p>Mr.Devlin, are you sure you don't want to call Legal Aid and ask for a senior attorney?</p>
<p>I trust her completely.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Let's start with the DNA sample.</p>
<p>We refuse. Too invasive.</p>
<p>We have a warrant.</p>
<p>Then I'll file a motion to quash it.</p>
<p>We have Mr.Devlin's blood on the victim's shirt and we have a mother lode of probable cause.</p>
<p>I'll argue that under the Daubert Standards, your DNA analysis is unreliable and invalid.</p>
<p>Please remove your shirt.</p>
<p>I said no.</p>
<p>Transitory evidence.</p>
<p>We don't need a warrant.</p>
<p>Come on. Let's go.</p>
<p>No, no...</p>
<p>Needle play.</p>
<p>You're into S&amp;M?</p>
<p>Stick out your tongue and say, &quot;Ah.</p>
<p>Boy, I hope you have a lot of insurance, Marty.</p>
<p>What are you accusing my client of?</p>
<p>We already have his dom in custody.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, she's going to roll on him, and then we have him on the hook for kidnapping and murder.</p>
<p>Oh, you like hooks, don't you, Marty?</p>
<p>I didn't kidnap anybody.</p>
<p>Is that a confession?</p>
<p>I'm advising you to remain silent.</p>
<p>So what happened? You and Ms.Tournay followed Ian Wallace home from the Lower Linx and then you had a fight?</p>
<p>One of you killed him.</p>
<p>Called his girlfriend told her she better come home.</p>
<p>Probably planned on framing her.</p>
<p>And then you lassoed him under Justine's car.</p>
<p>What kind of car do you drive, Marty?</p>
<p>Michelle was driving a Durango, and you were following behind like a nice little slave.</p>
<p>But then things get weird.</p>
<p>The body fell out on the road.</p>
<p>Justine made a break for it, and I bet you were the one who decided to set her on fire.</p>
<p>Stop... stop!</p>
<p>There are no safe words here, Marty.</p>
<p>This is a police station.</p>
<p>You like pain? 'Cause you're going to be in for a treat.</p>
<p>We're invoking. We're done.</p>
<p>I noticed in the autopsy report that Mr.</p>
<p>Wallace was stabbed after he was dead.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Which would make your dom a sexual sadist. That's highly unusual.</p>
<p>Why? There must be sexual sadists that seek out that world.</p>
<p>See, sexual sadists are typically charming loners.</p>
<p>They would be repulsed by a consensual, safe and communicative lifestyle.</p>
<p>When a submissive says &quot;stop, &quot; you have to stop.</p>
<p>That doesn't work for a sexual sadist. They get off on the terror of their subjects.</p>
<p>So you think that S&amp;M play was not involved in the murders?</p>
<p>They were separate events?</p>
<p>That would be my expert opinion.</p>
<p>May I make a personal observation?</p>
<p>As a friend, not as a therapist?</p>
<p>Everything I've told you, you could have read in a book.</p>
<p>I think the case is a mere pretext and you're here for a more personal reason.</p>
<p>Before I left, you said some things that I tried not to hear, but now, uh, I think you were right.</p>
<p>If a relationship can't move forward, it withers.</p>
<p>I've been waiting for you to decide.</p>
<p>But sometimes not making a decision is making a decision.</p>
<p>Where is Sara?</p>
<p>What stopped you?</p>
<p>I don't know. A lot of things.</p>
<p>Devotion to your work?</p>
<p>Loyalty to the team?</p>
<p>Fear of the unknown?</p>
<p>Do you regret your decision not to go with her?</p>
<p>It was beyond my control.</p>
<p>Really?</p>
<p>Most relationships are over before they end.</p>
<p>But it's still a death.</p>
<p>You mourn the loss, have conflicting emotions but oftentimes there's a sense of relief.</p>
<p>We've all experienced it, but no one wants to admit it.</p>
<p>I didn't say the relationship was over.</p>
<p>You didn't have to. Not making a decision was your decision.</p>
<p>Anyway, what I'm trying to say is, uh... you don't have to worry about me anymore.</p>
<p>I'm good.</p>
<p>I'm really good. And honestly...</p>
<p>I think it's better this way.</p>
<p>I think you're here because it's not home. It's not work.</p>
<p>And this is the only place that doesn't remind you of Sara.</p>
<p>I have a guest bedroom upstairs.</p>
<p>You can stay as long as you want.</p>
<p>I pulled Martin Devlin's info from his SIM card.</p>
<p>Guy's a big talker, but no calls to or from Michelle Tournay.</p>
<p>Did they text?</p>
<p>These are all the texts. Again, nothing to or from Michelle Tournay.</p>
<p>Devlin called our female vic at 8:12.</p>
<p>They talked until 8:29. He sent that text one minute later.</p>
<p>Are we ready to see this photo?</p>
<p>Holy crap.</p>
<p>That's our suspect's attorney.</p>
<p>I didn't see that coming.</p>
<p>Crisscross the phone number.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Who the hell is Marshall Jeffries?</p>
<p>Look, it's one digit off from Justine's number.</p>
<p>He must have panicked typed in the wrong number and sent the money shot to a stranger.</p>
<p>We have a new suspect.</p>
<p>How do you know Martin Devlin?</p>
<p>We just met.</p>
<p>Come on. I called Legal Aid.</p>
<p>There's no record of him in the database.</p>
<p>I'm sure it's a clerical error.</p>
<p>Counselor, isn't it a conflict of interest to represent Mr.Devlin while you're having an intimate relationship with one of his victims?</p>
<p>Lawyer by day, dominatrix by night.</p>
<p>Similar skill set.</p>
<p>I was at Ian's house the night of the murder... but I left just after that picture was taken.</p>
<p>Why'd you kill him?</p>
<p>I didn't.</p>
<p>So Martin did?</p>
<p>He swore to me he was innocent.</p>
<p>But I don't know.</p>
<p>The three of us did a scene together at the Lower Linx.</p>
<p>I lost control.</p>
<p>I got really turned on... kissed him.</p>
<p>Martin got jealous, stepped out of his role.</p>
<p>So you're in love with Ian, Martin's in love with you, they're both your slaves.</p>
<p>Sounds like a kinky soap opera.</p>
<p>Yes. I broke every rule.</p>
<p>Ian went home. I wanted to tell him how I felt, so I followed him.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>I can tell you feel the same.</p>
<p>You think I'm going to introduce you to my parents and let you raise my kids?</p>
<p>My girlfriend's going to be home soon. You got to go.</p>
<p>Get a grip. It was just s*x.</p>
<p>Martin came in the back door. He went after Ian.</p>
<p>This time, I didn't try to stop it.</p>
<p>Then Ian threw us both out.</p>
<p>I watched Martin drive away.</p>
<p>He could have gone back, but there is no way he would have killed the girlfriend.</p>
<p>Not like that.</p>
<p>We have evidence linking the lawyer to Ian.</p>
<p>Her DNA was at the Lower Linx as well as at the house.</p>
<p>Which means Michelle Tournay is no longer a suspect.</p>
<p>But there's an issue.</p>
<p>Lawyer wears a size six shoe.</p>
<p>Shoe impressions found in the desert are too big to be hers.</p>
<p>Plus, she drives a Mini Cooper.</p>
<p>So there's no match to the tire impressions.</p>
<p>Which means we can't place her at Justine's crime scene.</p>
<p>Or link her to Ian's body dump.</p>
<p>How about Martin Devlin?</p>
<p>The feet are too big, the car isn't a match.</p>
<p>I even checked both their credit records. Neither one rented a car.</p>
<p>So we're missing the third side of the evidence trinity.</p>
<p>We can link the scenes and the victims, but we can't link the suspects to the crime scenes.</p>
<p>The back door was unlocked. Anybody could have walked right in there.</p>
<p>So are we saying it was random. or they were targeted?</p>
<p>ThS&amp;M factor gave us all tunnel vision.</p>
<p>I disagree. We followed the evidence.</p>
<p>Which tells us that the same night Ian's play date went wrong, a couple of psychopaths just happened to torture, kidnap and kill our vics?</p>
<p>According to Locard's theory, we're still missing something.</p>
<p>There's still got to be evidence out there.</p>
<p>Heather... would you stay?</p>

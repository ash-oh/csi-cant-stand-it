<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS STRIP - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Police cars and a helicopter chase after a speeding vehicle. Sirens wail.)</p>
<hr />
[EXT. INTERSTATE 15 -- LVPD SQUAD CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(OFFICER METCALF is in one of the cars chasing the speeding vehicle and he's on the radio.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer Metcalf</strong>: Unit 584-Adam. Please be advised we're in pursuit of a BMW going southbound on Interstate 15 at a high rate of speed.</p>
<p><strong>Dispatch</strong>: (over radio) Roger, 158. You are cleared for maneuver.</p>
<p>(He swings out and tips the speeding vehicle in the rear bumper. The speeding vehicle continues on. He swings out again and tips the speeding vehicle in the rear bumper. This time, the speeding vehicle runs off of the road.)</p>
<p>(It comes to a stop on the side of the road. The Police Officer stops a safe distance behind it.)</p>
<p>(OFFICER METCALF jumps out of the police car with his gun drawn.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer Metcalf</strong>: Driver roll down your window. Let me see your hands.</p>
<p>(He slowly makes his way toward the car.)</p>
<p>(He reaches out a hand to open the car door.)</p>
<p>(Suddenly, the car door opens. He jerks back as two women dressed only in their underwear exit the car with their arms raised.)</p>
<p><strong>Anna Leah (blonde)</strong>: Don't shoot. Don't shoot! LORI (BRUNETTE): Don't shoot. Don't shoot.</p>
<p>(OFFICER METCALF raises his hand to stop the other officers from moving in. He reaches for his radio.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer Metcalf</strong>: (to radio) Dispatch, unit 584 is a code four. We got a couple of girls joyriding. (to the other officer) Rookie, clear the vehicle!</p>
<p>(The two women stand their with their arms raised.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: The ROOKIE checks the front seat of the car and finds nothing. She backs out and closes the door.)</p>
<p>(She walks around to the back of the car where she starts looking around. She finds some blood on the rear bumper.)</p>
<p>(Camera zooms in for an extreme close up of the blood.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. INTERSTATE 15 - SHOULDER (SOUTHBOUND) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM slams the car door shut. Carrying his kit, he makes his way toward BRASS. They both walk toward the back of the car.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: {unintelligible}</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: 4-19?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: More like a four.</p>
<p>(Puzzled, GRISSOM turns to look at the car. BRASS lifts up the trunk hood.)</p>
<p>[INSIDE TRUNK POV]</p>
<p>(The trunk hood is raised and GRISSOM'S eyebrows rise in surprise. He looks at BRASS, then bends to put his kit down. He straightens and glances down at the trunk's contents.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (quoting) Ichabod was horror-struck on perceiving that he was headless.&quot;</p>
<p>(BRASS glances at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: ...Sleepy hollow.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM glances back at BRASS.)</p>
<p>[RESUME REGULAR CAMERA ANGLE INTO THE TRUNK]</p>
<p>(Inside the trunk is a head severed at the neck. GRISSOM reaches in and lifts the eye lid to look at the pupil.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Vitreous humor is glazed over.</p>
<p>[INSIDE TRUNK POV]</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That means that, six to eight hours ago somebody lost their head. Then ... somebody lost their head.</p>
<p>(Both turn glance at each other, then glance back at the head.)</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY/RECEPTION AREA- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks into the hallway and tosses an envelope into the outgoing mail basket on the reception desk.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Sayonara.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - BREAK ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks into the break room, followed closely by SARA and NICK. They're extremely surprised to find GRISSOM already in the room and sitting behind the table.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, well, what a switch. You actually beat us here.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's Evaluation Day.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Where's Warrick?</p>
<p>(SARA turns around to look. She glances at NICK, who raises his eyebrows at her.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: He's working spillover -- personal thing -- kid he knows who's in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Oh, that's right. (shakes his head as he remembers) He told me. I forgot.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, maybe we should be evaluating you.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You're a riot, Alice. You and I are going to work the head case.</p>
<p>(He hands the assignment slip to CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Goody.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Nick, another homicide. 4-19, 40 miles outside of Baker.</p>
<p>(He hands the assignment slip to NICK. NICK takes it and pulls back to leave, thinking it's a solo.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay. Good. I'm on it.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sara, you go with him.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (thrilled) Yes! Road trip.</p>
<p>(She turns around and taps NICK on the shoulders.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'm gonna go switch boots.</p>
<p>(SARA leaves the break room. NICK appears less than thrilled. He turns around and looks at GRISSOM. GRISSOM sees the look. So does CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Cath, I'll catch up with you.</p>
<p>(She nods and leaves.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'll meet you at the autopsy. (glances back at GRISSOM) &quot;Head&quot;-topsy.</p>
<p>(She walks out of the room. NICK looks at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sit down.</p>
<p>(NICK sighs and sits down.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Look. Grissom I know this is a bad time to bitch to the boss but, uh, I've been a CSI Level 3 for nine months now. I was a CSI before Warrick. Warrick works D.B.'S solo. Why can't I?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Repeat after me. Silk, silk, silk.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: &quot;Silk, silk, silk&quot;?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: At do cows drink?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Milk.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (he shakes his head) Cows drink water. They give milk. A simple riddle. Common sense disguised in a puzzle of words, but an excellent barometer for evaluating someone's readiness.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (frustrated) Look, I'm not one of your suspects you can trick, okay? If I'm not ready, be a man -- tell me I'm not ready.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You're not ready.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You know why I took this job? Honestly? I wanted to pack heat, walk under the yellow tape, be the man ... but mostly, because I want you to think I'm a good CSI.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And that's the reason I have to hold you back.</p>
<p>(NICK shakes his head and looks away.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Anybody who's great at anything, Nick, does it for their own approval not someone else's.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Alone in his autopsy room, DR. ROBBINS has the tape player blaring while playing his crutch like a guitar. He sings along to the music, his back to the door. He doesn't see GRISSOM and CATHERINE walk into the room.) </p>
<p>(He glances behind him and sees them standing there. He quickly reaches over to turn the volume down.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: uh, voice sound familiar?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Kind of sounds like the daytime coroner.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Gary Telgenhoff?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Yep. A songwriter in his off-time. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (considers) It sucks.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, I just filed for divorce. I'm feeling a little confident.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to CATHERINE) I guess. (to ROBBINS) I like it.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, where's the head?</p>
<p>(DR. ROBBINS reaches over and turns the music off. He turns toward the head.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Well, police I.D.'d him at the scene when they ran his plates compared the DMV head shot to the head. Grissom, Catherine, meet Victor Dasilva.</p>
<p>(DR. ROBBINS pulls the sheet aside to show them the head. GRISSOM walks around to the front of the head.)</p>
<p>(He looks at the top of the head and sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What did this?</p>
<p>(Camera zooms in for an extreme close up of the top of the head with a three-pronged indentation on the scalp.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Hard to tell without making a mold.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Fatal blow?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: (nods) Looks like it.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE leans in close to look at the markings on the jaw.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Man, look at those chopping wounds on the jawbone. </p>
<p>(Camera moves in for an extreme close up of the wound markings.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: They almost look like practice swings.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It could've been dark. Bad aim, maybe?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Definitely a crime of passion.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You think a female could do this?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I could have.</p>
<p>(beat)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (sing-song-ish) Scared of you.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE stands up.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: If you want to know what exact tools were used we're going to need to boil the head.</p>
<p>(Suddenly, GRISSOM is interested in this part of the investigation. He straightens and looks at DR. ROBBINS.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Really? You want me to prepare it?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Sure. What, uh, additive do you put in your boil?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE stiffens and listens to the conversation.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Laundry detergent. Works great. It's like peeling off a rubber halloween mask.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM makes a motion down the front of the head as if he were peeling off the skin. CATHERINE nods her head, barely containing her excitement.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Excellent.</p>
<p>(She can't take it anymore.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, I'm out of here. I'm going to be with Brass ... see if I can get anything on those Victoria's Secret girls.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE turns and leaves the room. GRISSOM and DR. ROBBINS immediately resume their conversation about the head.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Where's your crock-pot, Doc?</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. GUARD GATE HUT - INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(WARRICK walks up to the parking lot. CHARLES MOORE stands there in his uniform with a clipboard in his hand. He turns when WARRICK calls out to him.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Mr. Moore.</p>
<p>(They both walk back to the guard gate.)</p>
<p><strong>Charles Moore</strong>: My grandson won't take my calls. He'll only talk to you.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I think James called me tonight because he thought I could help him.</p>
<p><strong>Charles Moore</strong>: That was a nice thing you did giving him your pager number when he went away but he should be calling me. I'm his grandfather. I deserve to know what happened.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: James is all right but, uh, there was a big brawl at the detention center. James was at the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>
<p><strong>Charles Moore</strong>: (fearing the worst) What's my grandson looking at?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: If he talks, he'll be dead inside a month. Now, if he keeps quiet, the D.A. will put the squeeze on him. He'll probably end up in the big house you could lose your boy forever then.</p>
<p><strong>Charles Moore</strong>: Why didn't James call me ... tell me?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: He probably knew what your advice would be. To do the honorable thing.</p>
<p><strong>Charles Moore</strong>: There's no honor in jail.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Not without a price. Look, a crime occurred. CSI's got full jurisdiction. I got myself assigned to the case. I'll see if I can take James out of the middle.</p>
<p>(MR. MOORE nods his head in appreciation, knowing that he can't do anything to help. WARRICK puts a supportive hand on his shoulder, then turns and walks away.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(BRASS and CATHERINE interview the two girls who are now barefoot and wrapped in blankets.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Can we offer you girls something to drink?</p>
<p><strong>Lori</strong>: Please don't say that word.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You want to tell us why two college freshmen were driving a stolen BMW with a head in the trunk?</p>
<p><strong>Anna Leah</strong>: We already told you. We had no idea that was in the trunk.</p>
<p>(She glances at her friend, LORI, who is looking away.)</p>
<p><strong>Lori</strong>: (mutters) Gross.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Now there's a start-- &quot;gross.&quot; Gross negligence-- flying down I-15 in a stolen car. Gross anatomy-- a human bowling ball in the trunk. Gross details-- let's hear it.</p>
<p>(The two girls look at each other.)</p>
<p><strong>Anna Leah</strong>: We lost our friends at bar 911.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [BAR 911] Inside the crowded bar, the girls are sitting at the counter having drinks.)</p>
<p><strong>Anna Leah</strong>: (V.O.) We had no ride home. We were bored. So, we started shots of tequila ...</p>
<p>(The two girls throw back their heads to drink the shots with a couple of guys at the bar.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Anna Leah</strong>: ... with some guy who looked like ... like Cat Stevens.</p>
<p>(The two girls glance at each other and chuckle at the memory.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [BAR 911] One of the guys standing between the two girls has his arm around both of them.)</p>
<p>(ANNA LEAH raises her arm up in the air and screams with excitement.)</p>
<p><strong>Anna Leah</strong>: Whoo!</p>
<p>(Cut to: [PARKING LOT OF BAR 911] Inside the van in the parking lot, they're with the stranger who looks like Cat Stevens.)</p>
<p><strong>Anna Leah</strong>: (V.O.) Next thing we know, we're in his van playing strip poker.</p>
<p>(LORI laughs and takes her tank top off and throws it at ANNA LEAH.)</p>
<p><strong>Lori</strong>: I can't believe we're doing this.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(ANNA LEAH laughs at the memory.)</p>
<p><strong>Anna Leah</strong>: It was a blast at first. Then, um ... </p>
<p>(She turns and looks over at CATHERINE and BRASS and she sobers up immediately.)</p>
<p><strong>Anna Leah</strong>: Then he said the creepiest thing.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [PARKING LOT OF BAR 911] Inside the van, as they're playing poker, they continue to play strip poker.)</p>
<p><strong>Stranger</strong>: So, I met this girl on the internet who offered me a round-trip ticket to fly out and help her end her life. She wanted me to shove a tennis ball down her throat.</p>
<p>(Cut to: [PARKING LOT] The van doors burst open and the two women in their underwear stumble out of the van. They search frantically for a way to get away from the Stranger.)</p>
<p>(ANNA LEAH sees the red car parked in the parking lot just outside the COLLINS U-STORE-IT sign and heads for it. She opens the door and finds that it's unlocked.)</p>
<p><strong>Anna Leah</strong>: Lori! Lori, over here! Lori!</p>
<p>(They both get inside the car. They take off.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Let me guess. You left your clothes in the van.</p>
<p><strong>Lori</strong>: We were so out of there. </p>
<p><strong>Anna Leah</strong>: This guy was weird. Like, way weird. I was thinking that he was going to pull a Silence of the Lambs on me and tell me to &quot;put lotion in the basket.&quot;</p>
<p>(LORI nudges ANNA with her elbow. The two girls fall silent. Then ANNA chuckles at the memory. She tries to stop herself, but can't. Soon, they're both chuckling.)</p>
<p>(BRASS and CATHERINE aren't impressed. They glance slowly at each other.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know what I think? I don't think you two are murderers. I think you're just felony stupid. But, for now, you're being booked on evading arrest, grand theft auto, DWI. You go with this officer here.</p>
<p>(They both stand up to do as they're told.)</p>

[EXT. -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(JAMES MOORE and WARRICK walk outside as they talk.) </p>
<p><strong>Man (over P.A.)</strong>: Lockdown is in effect. All guards remain at your posts.</p>
<p><strong>James Moore</strong>: I love my grandpa -- don't get me wrong -- but he's got no idea how it works in here. I'm not sure you do, either.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Why don't you tell me?</p>
<p><strong>James Moore</strong>: First off, this place only sees two colors: Black and white. You stay with your own. Despite what those chucks think upstairs this entire place is infiltrated with rolling 60s. Overflow from L.A.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: That's a lot of education in a short time, huh?</p>
<p><strong>James Moore</strong>: Yeah. I mean, I'm just trying to survive, man. I'm 60 days and a wake-up unless I get got.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: James, why don't you take a deep breath and tell me what happened here.</p>
<p><strong>James Moore</strong>: First, you got to tell me something. You got to tell me what side you're on.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Whose &quot;side&quot; I'm on? Who reached out to you, man?</p>
<p><strong>James Moore</strong>: Who put me in here?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: James, I'm trying to help you.</p>
<p>(JAMES glances at WARRICK and then makes a decision.)</p>
<p><strong>James Moore</strong>: All right. It breaks down like this --</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The two inmates walk up to each other. One of them is holding a shank in the palm of his hand.)</p>
<p><strong>James Moore</strong>: (V.O.) Kingpin from Gerson Park and Kingpin from L.A. County/Slauson both under one roof. It was time for one of them to stake their claim. </p>

<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Torso. Look at the width of the ribcage -- it's enormous -<br />
- and the shoulders are significantly larger in proportion and size compared to the average endomorph.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The bone structure is disproportionate.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: Correct. I measured the tibia and fibula around the ankle area then the radius and the ulna at the wrists -- the bones are 10-15% larger than the standard homo sapiens. Left fracture of the ischial prominence of the pelvis. Fracture of the pubis synphisus. Fracture of the lumbar spine vertebrae ...</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Suicide by hotel.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: This was not a hotel. What you see here is the flattening and expansion of the body that could only be caused by the impact of a very steep fall. If I know anything, I know two unequivocal truths: Dasilva's head does not belong to this body. And the reason I know that is because the torso is not human.</p>

<p>(NICK raises his head and gives it another look. He checks a pair of shoes, then sees something caught inside the cuff of the pants hanging.)</p>
<p>(He reaches over and picks it up. SARA moves the flashlight to give him more light. They both look at the peanut and nod at each other.)</p>
<p>(They both stand up and take a look at the clothes the pants belong to. It's a yellow shirt with a patch over the left breast that reads: SPUR'S CORRAL.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: &quot;Spur's Corral.&quot; I know that place. They give you peanuts for starters instead of bread or chips and salsa.</p>
<p>(NICK reaches for his phone.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I'm calling Grissom.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Look, you obviously don't need my help. I-I got go put something to rest. See you later?</p>
<p>(Using his teeth, NICK pulls out the phone's antennae. He starts dialing.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: All right. Thanks.</p>

<p>(DR. ROBBINS opens the morgue cabinet and pulls out the table with the sheet-covered body on it.) </p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: The body from the storage shed -- it's Victor DaSilva, all right. We ran his prints.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's nice that he still had his hands.</p>
<p>(He pulls the sheet aside.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: I was wrong about the cause of death.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The hammer didn't do it?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: No. He was shot point-blank in the heart.</p>
<p>(He points to the bullet hole.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: .380. Imagine the human heart as an apple.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV to: Camera on an red apple. A gunshot is heard and a high speed bullet appears from the left and pierces through the apple, ripping it to shreads.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Albert Robbins</strong>: (V.O.) Instant liquefaction.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We found everything else in that shed. I don't know why we didn't find a gun.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, maybe he was shot somewhere else.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: That would explain the plastic.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks confused, then moves to stand in front of CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What plastic? You never told me about any plastic.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I didn't? Oh. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE turns and walks away. GRISSOM follows her.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The victim was wrapped in a plastic sheet.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Victor DaSilva's entire house was covered in plastic. He was having it painted.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Really? Who's the painter?</p>
<p>(She stops in front of the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Nobody famous.</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You had access to victor DaSilva's house?</p>
<p><strong>Trent Calloway</strong>: Yeah, I was painting it.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You own a gun? I don't mean a paint gun.</p>
<p><strong>Trent Calloway</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay, let's get right to it. What's your shoe size?</p>
<p><strong>Trent Calloway</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I have a shoe fetish. I love feet.</p>
<p><strong>Trent Calloway</strong>: It's 13.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Take off your shoes and socks. We need to verify.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE takes a sheet of print paper and puts it down on the ground while TRENT CALLOWAY takes off his shoes and socks.)</p>
<p>(He sticks out his foot. CATHERINE uses a roller and applies the ink. She puts his foot down.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay ... step on the paper. </p>
<p>(TRENT CALLOWAY stands up and leaves his foot print behind. CATHERINE compares the print to the sock print.)</p>

[INT. SPUR'S CORRAL - DAY]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and BRASS are at SPUR'S CORRAL. Like a layer of carpet, peanut shells and skin remains litter the floor. GRISSOM stares at it as BRASS peels some peanuts. He tosses the shells and skins on the floor.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'd tell you not to step on the evidence, but, uh...</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, but what's the point? Pretty good gimmick they got here, though. You eat peanuts, toss the shells on the floor -- nobody gives a rat's ass.</p>
<p>(BRASS tosses more peanut shells on the floor as they make their way toward the RESTAURANT MANAGER and to NICK who is already there interviewing him.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You sure you can't help me out?</p>
<p><strong>Restaurant Manager</strong>: No. Victor DaSilva never worked here.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: We found one of your uniforms in his closet. Any idea how it got there?</p>
<p><strong>Restaurant Manager</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Guys ... look, boss, I'm sorry. I thought I was onto something here. I had a conflict in shoe sizes so I thought I'd play a hunch. Sara was right there. We were checking out the shoes ... (echo-y voice) ... and we found some peanuts in the cuff links and go up and Spurs Corral.</p>
<p>(As NICK speaks, GRISSOM is distracted by the large wall display behind him. A large decorated sombrero hanging on the wall.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Incidental.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I don't think so.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM continues to stare at the display. It's something that he recognizes.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: ...so that's why I buzzed you guys down. You got to follow your hunches, right?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, sure. Jim.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You still got that picture that you took from DaSilva's house?</p>
<p>(NICK seems confused by the leap in thinking.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah. Yeah. Here it is.</p>
<p>(BRASS reaches into his pocket and gives GRISSOM the picture.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at the picture. It's the same sombrero.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What? You're looking at the sombrero?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM stares at the torn edge of the photo.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The earrings. Victor DaSilva was here with someone he cut out of his life.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Probably his girlfriend.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM calls out to the RESTAURANT MANAGER.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Excuse me. You recognize this ear?</p>
<p>(The RESTAURANT MANAGER looks at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Restaurant Manager</strong>: You got to be kidding me. (He takes a look at the picture and is surprised that he actually does recognize it.) Wait a minute. Yeah, I do. I do recognize those earrings.</p>

[CAMERA CLOSE UP OF THE EAR WITH THE EARRINGS]</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Fred Applewhite?</p>
<p>(The camera pulls back a little to show FRED APPLEWHITE, a waiter at the SPUR'S CORRAL. He turns around and looks at GRISSOM, BRASS and NICK. He smiles pleasantly, a couple of menus tucked under his arm.)</p>

<p>(SARA approaches TERI MILLER as she works on the gorilla body.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I heard you were disassembling the gorilla.</p>
<p><strong>Teri Miller</strong>: For purposes of disease control. Per the CDC, I have to take samples and dispose of this animal immediately.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, I've been trying to find out who did this to her and, um, I have some questions.</p>
<p>(TERI continues to work.)</p>
<p><strong>Teri Miller</strong>: You ask, I'll answer.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Why did they amputate the gorilla's head?</p>
<p><strong>Teri Miller</strong>: It's a trophy. American fetishists would pay up to $10,000 for the head of a lowland gorilla.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The hands and feet?</p>
<p><strong>Teri Miller</strong>: Novelty items. Sold as ashtrays.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Here Nick and I were thinking it was to avoid I.D. Why skin it?</p>
<p><strong>Teri Miller</strong>: Purses, shoes, boots ... It's sad. Genetically we're 92.7% identical with gorillas. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It's hard to tell where the human ends and the animal begins.</p>
<p><strong>Teri Miller</strong>: Well said.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I checked out a couple of websites ... bushmeat[dot]net, gorilla[dot]org. I think she was killed probably in Cameroon or Congo transported to the port of Los Angeles. Dismembered, packaged ... loaded onto a small plane ... where they dumped what they couldn't sell but, uh, I just have to find the plane.</p>
<p><strong>Teri Miller</strong>: Needle in a haystack. Chances are, whoever did this are halfway around the world by now.</p>

<p>(FRED APPLEWHITE stands up and walks along the stretch of white paper spread out on the garage floor. As he walks, CATHERINE and NICK look through the sock print photos from the crime scene.)</p>
<p>(He reaches the end, turns around, and walks back to the stool.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay, great. Now, Mr. Applewhite ... this time, I want you to do something different. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE kneels down and pushes a fresh roll of paper along the floor. FRED APPLEWHITE moves to the second sheet of paper.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: This time ... run.</p>
<p>(FRED APPLEWHITE steps onto the fresh paper and runs across it.)</p>

<p>(GRISSOM points to the foot prints on the paper spread across the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: See the complete heel, arch and five little piggies? The next few steps, however ... </p>
<p>(GRISSOM, NICK and CATHERINE pushes the paper closer toward them so that he can see the prints they're looking at.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: ... the heel disappears. All of the pressure is put on ball of the foot and toes. Why? Because you were running. And my guess is that, on the day you had a head in your hand.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You see, everyone's foot makes a unique well impression. Check it out. </p>
<p>(NICK puts the sock print photos on the table in front of them.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: The, uh width ... ball of the foot ... instep ... arch ... and, uh ... </p>
<p>(NICK throws another photo on the table. This one is of the complete foot.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: ... size 11 for dessert.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mr. Applewhite your footprints ... place you at the crime scene.</p>
<p><strong>Fred Applewhite</strong>: Victor and I were partners. We shared everything including in our house and the storage shed.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We know that. When did you move out?</p>
<p><strong>Fred Applewhite</strong>: Three months ago. He found somebody else ... kicked me out.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: And you took all your possessions with you?</p>
<p><strong>Fred Applewhite</strong>: Not everything.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, you were hoping for a reconciliation.</p>
<p><strong>Fred Applewhite</strong>: Yeah. I thought, once Victor got this new guy out of his system he'd come around.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: But he didn't, did he? That's why you went to his house last night.</p>
<p><strong>Fred Applewhite</strong>: Who said I went there?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The plastic. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM holds up a sample.)</p>

<p>(GRISSOM holds up a photo of the body in the plastic in the trunk.)</p>

<p>(She playfully weaves her way through the swings, laughing as she goes.)</p>
<p><strong>Butchy</strong>: I got you, I got you! I got you! I got you. </p>
<p>(BUTCHY finally catches up to the girl. He pulls her down to the ground in the sandbox. They start kissing. He glances up and sees something. He stops kissing the girl, his eyes glued to whatever it is that he sees.)</p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong>: Butchy. keep going.</p>

<p>(GRISSOM walks around the body. It still hasn't been touched.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You've been walking in circles for ten minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: There's no sign of struggle. Whatever happened, happened somewhere else. This is a secondary scene.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Body dump?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Textbook. David, when we dig her up, I want you to tag her special processing. </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Yes, sir. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The only person who knows where the crime scene is has her mouthful of sand.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: A thousand square miles of desert in Vegas and this perp dumps the body in a sandbox.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He didn't put it here to hide it. He put it here to be found.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<hr />
[EXT. PARK -- SANDBOX- NIGHT]</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I think we got a van full of tools we can't use. Sand's a nightmare.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and GRISSOM sit off to the side looking at the scene trying to figure out the best way to get to the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: To get to the evidence, we may destroy the evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You get these haikus out of a book or do they just come to you?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Every time you find a body, you have to choose a path and when you take that path, Grasshopper, you risk destroying the evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We grab a trowel and some fine mesh screens and we just pretend like we're panning for gold ... Master.</p>
<p>(Cut to GRISSOM scooping up some sand and sifting through it. GRISSOM finds a barbie doll half buried in the sand. He picks it up.)</p>
<p>(Cut to CATHERINE sifting through the sand.)</p>
<p>(Cut to GRISSOM dusting sand off of the body.)</p>

[EXT. ASTRO CASH CHECKING -- PARKING LOT -- NIGHT]</p>

<p><strong>Det. Sam Vega</strong>: Gunshot victim shipped to desert palms. Santee Cherna, 32. Runs this check-cashing joint.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Cash business, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Det. Sam Vega</strong>: You bet. Was shot in the leg making his weekly bank run.</p>
<p>(They cross the crime scene tape.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Let me guess -- the guy makes his run same time every week.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Sam Vega</strong>: Night deposit.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: He's either stupid or suicidal.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Sam Vega</strong>: We can't arrest people for that, unfortunately.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Whole thing went down here?</p>
<p><strong>Det. Sam Vega</strong>: Sister heard a gunshot, saw a car take off.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Okay, I'm going to do a once-around.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: All right, I'll take the lot.</p>
<p>(WARRICK settles in. SARA leaves.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI -- LAB]</p>
<p>(The body found in the sandbox is now on the table. GRISSOM starts to take pictures. He makes special notice of the restraint marks on her ankles.)</p>
<p>(Flash to white. The body is flipped over and GRISSOM continues to take pictures. He notices something on her back. He picks it up and puts it in a bindle.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM puts on his goggles and turns off the lights. He uses the ALS down her body. He finds something on the back of her calf. He picks it up and looks at it.)</p>

<p>(Cut to GRISSOM mixing a mold mixture and putting it on the marks on her wrist.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. ASTRO CASH CHECKING - PARKING LOT -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(WARRICK is bagging the items found on the ground.)</p>
<p>(WARRICK also finds a small orange flyer on the ground. He looks up and notices that there are small orange flyers on the wind shields of the parked cars ... all except one.)</p>
<p>(WARRICK stands and approaches DET. SAM VEGA.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You run this car already?</p>
<p><strong>Det. Sam Vega</strong>: Oh, yeah. The RO's our vic. That's his spot.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Right here?</p>
<p><strong>Det. Sam Vega</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>(Cut to SARA kneeling in the alleyway behind the store. She calls out to WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey, Warrick! Check this out!</p>
<p>(WARRICK walks over.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We're dealing with some criminal genius here. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Grab the money bag, slice it and run.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You forgot the &quot;leave the evidence on the ground.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Let's see.</p>
<p>(SARA opens the bank bag left behind on the ground and leafs through the contents.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We got some checks, no cash ... and a deposit slip for $22,500.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So, our victim breaks out of the store with a bag full of dough ...</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Same time every week.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Guess somebody was casing the joint, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Or... it was an inside job.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CHECK CASHING STORE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p><strong>Carla Delgado</strong>: This morning everything was fine. Then some pendejo attacks my brother and we're out god knows how much money and now I'm stuck running this place alone.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Um, Ms. Delgado, I know you're upset ...</p>
<p><strong>Carla Delgado</strong>: Upset? Upset is for white people, lady. I'm pissed off. My brother was just shot in the thigh, okay? That's awful close to serious if you know what I'm saying.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Ms. Delgado, how long have you been here?</p>
<p><strong>Carla Delgado</strong>: Six years.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You have insurance?</p>
<p><strong>Carla Delgado</strong>: You better have insurance. You take 15% of a man's paycheck just to cash it. People use us, but they don't like us.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>(CARLA DELGADO leaves. WARRICK, SARA, and DET. SAM VEGA walk out of the store.)</p>
<p>[EXT. CHECK CASHING STORE - PARKING LOT - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So ... you think the brother might be behind this?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, I might bet my own paycheck on that one.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Sam Vega</strong>: But if that's true then our vic gets to collect the insurance money plus he gets to keep the money he stole for himself.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Nice scam.</p>
<p>(WARRICK holds up a sheet of colored paper advertisement for LUCKY LEE'S Chinese Restaurant.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Check it out. What's the first thing you do when you see one of these on your windshield?</p>
<p><strong>Det. Sam Vega</strong>: Chuck it.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Exactly. But the only guy to chuck his was the victim. I found one on the ground next to his car.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: That means whoever put these here wasn't gone long when the brother was shot. </p>
<p>(WARRICK nods.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Potential eyewitness.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- NIGHT]</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: She died two to four hours before she was discovered. Jury's still out on cause of death but considering the whip and ligature marks it's no stretch to say it was violent. Some of the scars on her back are years old. Some are fresh.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So what are we looking at? Rape, multiple sexual assaults?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: That's the strange part. Her body's a road map of abuse but there's no sign it was sexual. She hasn't had intercourse in months.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm thinking trade-in. Some lowlife gets tired of beating on the old model so he punches her ticket and starts shopping around for a version 2.0.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Here's a woman who's been beaten on a regular basis but look at the care she's lavished on herself. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM holds out her hands.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Manicured fingernails, manicured toenails. Perfect teeth, hair.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE lifts up the sheet.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Not to mention some serious breast augmentation. That is not a Tijuana boob job. Those puppies are top-of-the-line</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV camera angles down to the deceased's chest, through her breast and to the saline enhancement underneath with the serial number 414-55-5401 on it.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) ... at least we've got a pair of saline leads.</p>
<p>(End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to ROBBINS) Can you grab me one of those?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Left or right?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Dealer's choice.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI -- LAB]</p>
<p>(GREG is grounding up something in a mortar. NICK walks in and peers over his shoulder to see what he's doing.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What up, Einstein? Ooh, you got anything there?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: You think Einstein had people hovering over his shoulders all the time? If he did, do you think that we'd be walking around with e=mc squared t-shirts?</p>
<p>(NICK remains silent. He leans in to see what GREG is working on. GREG looks over his shoulder and gets annoyed.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Would you step back? Just give me some breathing room?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Maybe I'll tell you something about the silver sliver that Grissom found on sandbox girl's back.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: It's all yours.</p>
<p>(GREG puts the mixture on the card and puts it in the machine.)</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV as the machine processes the mixture on the card.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Let's see what the library has to say.</p>
<p>(The computer screen flashes the results.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Tempered steel with aluminum coating.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Then she was chained up.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: If she was, she was wearing something pretty funky.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: She was in the raw.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yeah, in a matter of speaking. Remember that sparkly stuff that Grissom got off her body?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I broke it down -- tree sap, ammonia and water.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Sounds like frat house gravy.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Liquid latex.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Never heard of it.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Really? It's all the craze right now, man. Girls paint it on guys. Guys paint it on girls. You can paint it on yourself if you want if that's what you're into. You can't get a date.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I got it.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Like I would know.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Sure, sure. I got it, man.</p>
<p>(NICK leaves.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<hr />
[EXT. PARKING LOT -- DAY]</p>
<p>(A man is busy putting flyers under the parked cars windshields. SARA and DET. SAM VEGA round the corner to the parking lot. They're carrying cups of coffee.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey, is that our guy?</p>
<p><strong>Det. Sam Vega</strong>: Detective Vega, LVPD. Can I see some ID?</p>
<p><strong>Businessman</strong>: I am a legitimate businessman. My card.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: How often do you distribute around here?</p>
<p><strong>Businessman</strong>: On this street? Every Thursday and Friday. Is that a crime?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, that depends. Did you see anything unusual last night? In the parking lot at Flamingo and Rhodes?</p>
<p><strong>Businessman</strong>: I don't know what city you live in, Missy but in Las Vegas, unusual is what happens when you leave the house.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Sam Vega</strong>: We can do this down at the station, if that works better for you.</p>
<p><strong>Businessman</strong>: Okay, okay. Um, some jerk told me if I touched his car he'd shove a flyer down my throat. Does that count:? </p>
<p><strong>Det. Sam Vega</strong>: Maybe. Did you get a good look at him?</p>
<p><strong>Businessman</strong>: Them. There were two. A couple of lowlifes in baseball caps.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What about the car? Did you notice the make?</p>
<p><strong>Businessman</strong>: Honda, maybe. All those tin boxes look alike.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. DR. CORNFELD'S OFFICES -- HALLWAY]</p>
<p>(DR. SIDNEY CORNFELD walks down the hallway. CATHERINE calls out from behind him. He stops and turns around.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Dr. Cornfeld? Catherine Willows, Las Vegas crime lab. I believe this is one of yours.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE reaches into her bag and pulls out a plastic container with the implant in it.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Sidney Cornfeld</strong>: Oh, yeah. 414 series. Firm, but plenty of give.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Spare me the sales pitch. We removed that from a homicide victim. I've got a photo.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Sidney Cornfeld</strong>: Judging by the size she had a pretty decent pair to start with. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE opens the file she's carrying and shows the Doctor the photograph of the deceased inside.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Sidney Cornfeld</strong>: Oh, she was a pretty girl.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm going to need her name.</p>
<p>(DR. SIDNEY CORNFELD reaches into his jacket pocket and checks his palm pilot.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Sidney Cornfeld</strong>: Let's see. Oh, yeah, here we go. Third-party billing, but I do recognize the address. They send me a lot of business. Mona Taylor. She must have worked there. Real shame.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'll tell you what's a shame -- that she was so pretty and perfect and still thought she needed implants.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Sidney Cornfeld</strong>: You shouldn't judge Mona for wanting to improve herself. Competition's intense especially for a young woman living in Las Vegas. Why don't you put yourself in her shoes.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Trust me-- I've been in her shoes. I got out of them.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Sidney Cornfeld</strong>: Oh, yeah, why is that?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: They were killing me.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE leaves.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<hr />
[EXT. LADY HEATHER'S DOMINION -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM, BRASS and CATHERINE walk up the driveway to an impressive home.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Are you sure the surgeon said this is where Mona Taylor worked?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Maybe she was a domestic.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No domestic has a $10,000 rack. Not even in Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, the DMV records indicate that she hit town from South Dakota three years ago. I figure the bright lights faded and she snagged a sugar daddy.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: How much business can one sugar daddy give a plastic surgeon?</p>
<p>(They ring the doorbell.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The eternal question to which we're about to find the answer.</p>
<p>(The door opens and LADY HEATHER appears. Both CATHERINE and GRISSOM are casually taken aback. BRASS doesn't seem surprised at all.)</p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: Let me guess -- three police officers looking for respite from having to control and dominate our big, bad city?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Close-- one police officer, two criminalists. May we come in?</p>
<p>(LADY HEATHER steps aside and they all enter the foyer.)</p>
<p>(In the background, a whip cracks and a man groans.)</p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: Another happy customer. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns to look at LADY HEATHER.)</p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: Now, would you prefer individual sessions or would you like to enjoy each other's submission?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns to look at CATHERINE. She laughs.)</p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: You don't have to decide now. Please, make yourselves comfortable and welcome to Lady Heather's Dominion.</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>

[EXT. LADY HEATHER'S DOMINION -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The flashlight shines on a car's Nevada License Plate, IAM4FUN, with registration for 12/2001.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: That's her.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: &quot;I'm for fun&quot;. Right.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: She drove herself to work.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: But she didn't drive home.</p>
<p>(NICK walks away and starts looking around. CATHERINE checks the car driver's side door.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It's still locked.</p>
<p>(NICK opens the trash can. He picks through it. CATHERINE peers into the car from the window.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Looks clean.</p>
<p>(NICK finds something in the trash can. He picks it up to examine it.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, Catherine .... come check this out.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What's that?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Liquid latex. Grissom found some on the victim. Sanders did a trace analysis. Stuff peels off like a glove.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Handy.</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Really? Were there any disturbances last night? Did you hear screams?</p>

<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: Captain Brass, surely you don't think sexual contact is the only means of fulfillment.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Lady Heather you don't what to know what I think. </p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: Her last client was at 11:00. She would have left at midnight.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Do you have any kind of log book? Some record of who was working that night? What they did with their time? That sort of thing?</p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: Would that get you excited?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Not particularly. But it might help us catch the creep who murdered Mona.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We need names and addresses. We also need to know which rooms she worked last night so we can examine them.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yes. I find all deviant behavior fascinating in that to understand our human nature we have to understand our aberrations.</p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: And you think what goes on here is aberrant?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I would say that whip marks and ligature contusions on a young woman are aberrant. Wouldn't you?</p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: Every job has it's peculiar hazards. Rock stars damage their ear drums. Football players ruin their knees. In this business, it's scars. But no one who works for me has ever sustained a serious injury.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mona did. She died.</p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: Not because she worked here that's your assumption. What happens here isn't about violence. It's about challenging preconceived notions of victorian normalcy. Bringing people's fantasies to life. Making them real and acceptable. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Like the theatre.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM puts down the mask he's holding and walks across the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: It's people who don't come to places like this that I worry about. The ones who don't have an outlet. Say ... someone like yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Oh, I have outlets. I read. I study bugs. I sometimes even ride roller coasters.</p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: And your s*x life?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It doesn't involve going to the theater.</p>
<p>(LADY HEATHER smiles.)</p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: In my experience, Mr. Grissom, some men go to the theater ... some men are the theater. Either way, what I offer is a chance for submission or control, whichever's required. Sometimes a client doesn't know what he wants until I show him.</p>
<p>(LADY HEATHER takes a seat.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: &quot;No man is a complete mystery except to himself.&quot; Marcel Proust.</p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: I bet he'd have enjoyed himself here.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Probably. No crime is a complete mystery, either. The whip marks on Mona Taylor were fresh.</p>
<p>(LADY HEATHER stands up surprised by this piece of information.)</p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: That can't be. Mona was Dominant with her clients. (thoughtful)<br />
I know that she sometimes saw clients off the books. I let her because she brought in so much business, but I just assumed she knew what she was doing.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: My guess is that one of her off-the-book clients ... is a regular. I mean, it is a repeat business, is it not?</p>

<p>(Cut to CATHERINE inside the car. She is opening the glove compartment. She takes out the watch box. She opens it and ands it to GRISSOM where finds a small piece of liquid latex stuck in the crease of the box. He holds the piece up so that CATHERINE can see it.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Latex. Like Hansel and Gretel, we just followed the bread crumbs all the way home.</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>

[INT. LADY HEATHER'S DOMINION -- DAY]</p>
<p>(LADY HEATHER enters her room carrying a tea pot. She walks over to the table set for tea. She pours the tea and puts the tea pot on the table. GRISSOM is standing off to the side. He turns around when she walks in.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Afternoon tea. How nice. </p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: I like a bit of civility before dark ... when all the needy little boys show up.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, I'm a little needy myself today. My lab pulled skin cells from Mona Taylor's straws.</p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: A DNA sample? I have several clients in law enforcement. X-X or X-Y?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: They're male.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM shows LADY HEATHER a photograph he brought with him. It's of CAMERON and EILENE NELSON at a formal function. Both are speaking with a man.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Have you ever seen either of these two people?</p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: Not the wife, but I have seen the husband.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I didn't say they were married. </p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: It's obvious. Look at the way he's clenching her hand with both of his and leaning toward her. And see how she's twisting away presenting herself to the wealthy alpha male? She's insensitive; he insecure. That's a setup for matrimony, not passion. She wants the dominant male to choose her so she can stop being dominant.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You're very good. You could work for me.</p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: You want to be my boss?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You never know. We both might learn something.</p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: Oh, I'm sure of that.</p>
<p>(They both sit down at the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: I can read anyone who walks through this door and know their desires. Sometimes even before they do. Why do you think I selected china and table linens?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You like fine things.</p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: Or maybe I knew you'd like them. Same way I know you enjoy most of the superficial trappings of civilization.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm that obvious, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: Only because you try not to be. You spend your life uncovering what goes beneath the surface of civility and acceptable behavior. So it's a release for you to indulge in something like high tea when it seems, if only for a moment, the world really is civilized.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM doesn't respond.)</p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: The most telling thing about anyone is what scares them. And I know what you fear more than anything, Mr. Grissom.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Which is?</p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: Being known. You can't accept that I might know what you really desire, because that would mean that I know you. Something, for whatever reason, you spend your entire life making sure no one else does.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Lady Heather, you're an anthropologist.</p>
<p><strong>Lady Heather</strong>: More tea?</p>
<p>(LADY HEATHER picks up the tea pot and refreshes GRISSOM'S cup of tea.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>

[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERROGATION ROOM -- DAY]</p>
<p><strong>Hector Delgado</strong>: But, see, I could give the money back. But my wife doesn't even know it. If, I like, give the money back to her brother I could go home, right? Right?!</p>
<p><strong>Det. Sam Vega</strong>: Tell us how it happened-- then we'll talk about the future.</p>
<p><strong>Hector Delgado</strong>: When I picked Carla up from work on Wednesday, I doubled back and I lifted the piece that Santee keeps by the register. I figured I'd return it Friday. Nobody would know.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Pretty smart, Hector.</p>
<p><strong>Hector Delgado</strong>: I couldn't use my car, 'cause Santee knew my car, so I hit up on a buddy.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to a red Honda stopping and a masked man jumping out to attack SANTEE CHERNA. The masked man holds a gun to SANTEE CHERNA. SANTEE CHERNA hits the man.)</p>
<p><strong>Santee Cherna</strong>: No ... ow!</p>
<p>(The man falls to the ground and fires the weapon at SANTEE CHERNA. He drops the money bag. The masked man picks it up and runs. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Hector Delgado</strong>: Look, it's not like they're out of anything. They're insured. For the money and his health. Nobody loses.</p>
<p>(SARA looks at WARRICK. WARRICK looks over at HECTOR DELGADO.)</p>
<p><strong>Hector Delgado</strong>: (hopeful) So can I go now?</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CHERNA CHECK CASHING - DAY]</p>
<p><strong>Carla Delgado</strong>: Hector's my husband, but I hope you keep him in jail a long time. </p>
<p><strong>Santee Cherna</strong>: He's not going anywhere, right? You commit a crime, you pay the price.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You got that right.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Oh, by the way we found the $5,000 you skimmed from this business in your jeans pocket.</p>
<p><strong>Carla Delgado</strong>: What? </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to WARRICK taking the jeans out of the evidence paper bag. He finds a wallet, some keys and a wad of cash. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Carla Delgado</strong>: You self-righteous b*st*rd. You stand there and bad-mouth my husband while you're robbing me behind my back?</p>
<p><strong>Santee Cherna</strong>: I was just borrowing it, I swear.</p>
<p>(CARLA DELGADO takes a step back and looks at DET. VEGA.)</p>
<p><strong>Carla Delgado</strong>: You going to arrest his ass?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. PARKING LOT -- DAY]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and CATHERINE go through the NELSON'S car. CATHERINE finds a coat jacket with sand on it. They look at each other.)</p>
<p>(EILENE NELSON drives up in her convertible.)</p>
<p><strong>Cameron Nelson</strong>: They had a warrant. I didn't want to bother you at work.</p>
<p><strong>Eilene Nelson</strong>: This qualifies as a harassment suit.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Too late.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: &quot;Grains of golden sand.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Eilene Nelson</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Edgar Allan Poe. Another man who was familiar with murder.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Played in any sandboxes lately Mr. Nelson?</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY]</p>
<p><strong>Eilene Nelson</strong>: As my husband's attorney, I'm advising him not to speak with you.</p>
<p><strong>Cameron Nelson</strong>: Eilene ...</p>
<p><strong>Eilene Nelson</strong>: Shut up, Cameron. I'll handle this.</p>
<p><strong>Cameron Nelson</strong>: No. No, I will not shut up. You know, I didn't ask you to be my attorney. You're just doing this to look out for yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Eilene Nelson</strong>: I'm looking out for our family. I'm the only one who's qualified.</p>
<p><strong>Cameron Nelson</strong>: Really? And how exactly is sleeping with Ronald looking after your family?</p>
<p><strong>Eilene Nelson</strong>: Cameron ...</p>
<p><strong>Cameron Nelson</strong>: Cameron ... what? What? You never gave a damn about me. And our child ... our child is just some yuppie pet designed to make you look better at the firm. Which happens to be the only family you probably really care about.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Mr. Nelson, you're very emotional right now. Why don't you just take a moment collect yourself. Let me get you a glass of water.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE stands up. She pauses by the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Eilene Nelson</strong>: No! No water, no gum, no anything. If you think you can trick him into giving you some DNA, you're mistaken.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks over at GRISSOM. GRISSOM stands and pulls out an evidence bag from the file he's holding. He holds it out to EILENE NELSON.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Liquid latex.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM puts the bag on the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Eilene Nelson</strong>: What is that supposed to mean? </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Your husband made Mona Taylor wear it every time that he paid to humiliate her.</p>
<p><strong>Eilene Nelson</strong>: Why would he do that?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Psychologically, she was a surrogate. In fetish club terms, she was a slave. Cameron would put a mask on her face and cover her body in liquid latex.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to MONA TAYLOR in chains and in the mask. CAMERON NELSON puts the watch on MONA TAYLOR'S bare wrist. Flash to white.)</p>
<p>(CAMERON NELSON painting liquid latex on MONA TAYLOR'S wrist. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He made her into nothing in order to make her into you.</p>
<p><strong>Eilene Nelson</strong>: My watch.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I guess that made it more real.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Cameron couldn't dominate you, so he dominated Mona. Only his last appointment, he got carried away.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to CAMERON NELSON striking MONA TAYLOR and yelling at her.)</p>
<p><strong>Cameron Nelson</strong>: Corporate bitch! You still think you're too good to touch your own husband? How about I make you beg for air? Huh? How about I make you ... beg for it?!</p>
<p>(Cut to CAMERON NELSON holding the end of the nose straws. MONA TAYLOR is struggling and screaming.)</p>
<p><strong>Cameron Nelson</strong>: Are you begging for it? Huh? I can't hear you, Eilene.</p>
<p>(MONA TAYLOR struggles and screams. She goes lax. CAMERON NELSON releases the straws. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Cameron Nelson</strong>: I had to pay some girl to pretend to be my wife.</p>
<p><strong>Eilene Nelson</strong>: Cameron, be quiet! If this is all you have, I am ... happy to go to trial.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mrs. Nelson, we're going to match Cameron's epithelials to the ones on the end of the straw.</p>
<p><strong>Cameron Nelson</strong>: Wait, wait, wait. Epithelials -- that's like ... that's like DNA, right? That's DNA?</p>
<p>(CAMERON NELSON turns to his wife.)</p>
<p><strong>Cameron Nelson</strong>: Okay, I got an idea. Why don't we test little Dylan's epithelials? Huh? See if his daddy isn't really your law partner. 'Cause, god knows, you haven't let me touch you in three years.</p>
<p>(CAMERON NELSON stands up.)</p>
<p><strong>Cameron Nelson</strong>: I'm out of here.</p>
<p><strong>Eilene Nelson</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>Cameron Nelson</strong>: Away from you. Other than that, I really don't care.</p>
<p>(CAMERON NELSON leaves the room escorted by an officer.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and GRISSOM turns the corner and walk through the hallway.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I just realized that you and I have a very healthy relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We do?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, when we have a problem, I don't paint Greg Sanders in latex and stick a straw up his nose.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Good. He'd probably like it.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE puts and arm on GRISSOM'S shoulder, stopping him.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Gil ... you're supposed to say something revealing back to me.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Okay. I never told anybody this, Catherine ...</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>

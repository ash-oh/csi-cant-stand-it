Karen Matthews: Jesse ... Jesse, can you hear me? Jesse, please!
 
Karen Matthews:  Jesse!!



 
Brass: Jesse Matthews, six years old.
 
Grissom: Is this an old photo?
Brass: Yeah, it's the only one the mom had. She said one minute, he's on the swing, the next minute he's gone.
Grissom: Abduction.
Brass: Well, the search radius is over a mile -- no sign of the boy.
Warrick: What about the father?
Brass: The father is, um ... Army Sergeant, uh ...  ... Dwight Matthews. Killed in Afghanistan four years ago.
Grissom: Any other family members? Grandparents? Boyfriends?
 
Brass: No, her parents are dead and her husband's parents -- she lost communication with them since he died.
 
Brass: Mrs. Matthews ... this is Gil Grissom and Warrick Brown from the Crime Lab.
Karen Matthews: I, uh ... I never bring Jesse to the park. But this afternoon, the backyard just couldn't hold him, so we came here and ... uh ... he was on the swings; I couldn't even get him off, and then I look around and he's gone; he's just ...
Brass: Mrs. Matthews, there's really nothing more you can do here. Why don't you let us give you a ride home?
 
Karen Matthews: I'm not leaving.  Not without Jesse.
 
Warrick: I called the team. 
 
Warrick: They always look so vulnerable.
Grissom: They are.





 
Greg: It's like trying to get an ID on swimmers from ripples in the pool. How about you?
 
Sara: Lots of little fingers ... and some big ones.
Greg: Helping hands?
 
 
 
Brass: Here, ma'am. Look at this picture. Do you remember this boy? It's not a recent photo.

Housekeeper: I had my hands full. I don't take my eyes off him ever.
 
Brass: Sure. I understand.
Housekeeper: But there was this man near the swings -- he kept looking around like he was waiting for something.
Brass: What'd he look like?
Housekeeper: He was a white guy, blue baseball cap ... that's all I remember.
Brass: Did he seem interested in one of the kids?
Housekeeper: Yeah. A boy. Could be that boy.  Mm ... it's hard to tell.
Brass: Okay ... thank you. Thank you very much.
Housekeeper: You're welcome.
 
 
Brass: Mrs. Matthews ...  I know this is difficult for you, but I have to ask you again -- do you remember seeing anyone hanging around near the swings? Anyone. Maybe, maybe a man in a blue baseball cap?
 
 
Karen Matthews: Yes.
Brass: Can you describe him?
Karen Matthews: He was white ... 
Brass:  ... white ... 
Karen Matthews: Uh ... just under six feet, I think.
Brass: Six feet. Great.
Karen Matthews: Jeans. 
 
 
 
 
Karen Matthews: Did he take Jesse?
Brass: We don't know.


 
 
 

 
Grissom: Our K-9 officers are going to need something that Jesse's worn recently.
Karen Matthews: Uh ... his jacket. It's in the car. I'll get it for you.
 


 
Officer: Okay, man. All right? Seek!
 
Officer: Let's go! Come on!
 
 

 
Karen Matthews: Whoa! Whoa! What are they doing?
Grissom: Pull the dogs back, please.

Officer: Heel!
 
Grissom: Can I see this jacket? 
 
Grissom:  Has Jesse ever worn this?
Karen Matthews: I just bought it for him. He's been growing so fast. I'm sorry, I ... 
Grissom: That's okay; we'll get something from your house.





 
 
Warrick: What do you make of this? 
 
Warrick: Possible struggle ... that could've been used as a weapon.  The blood drops could be castoff.
 
Warrick: Maybe the poor kid had to pee while his mom was in the car.
 
 

 
Warrick: Mrs. Matthews, I need you to take a look at something. Do you recognize these?
 
Karen Matthews: They're ...
 


 
 
 
 
Catherine: Mrs. Matthews inside?
Brass: Yeah. Every mother's worst nightmare.
 
Brass:  I checked her answering machine: No calls.
Catherine: Well, I'll get a DNA exemplar for Jesse and let her get some sleep.
Brass: She won't sleep.  Okay, Greg, let's do a little legwork, what do you say? You take this side of the street; I'll take the other -- find out if anybody's seen anything suspicious.
 
 
 
 
Catherine: Mrs. Matthews? 
 
Catherine: Mrs. Matthews? 
 
Catherine: I'm Catherine Willows from the Crime Lab.
Karen Matthews: Sorry about the mess.
Catherine: It's okay.
Karen Matthews: Jesse was so full of energy this morning. He didn't give me time to clean up.
Catherine: I understand. 
 
Catherine: This photo ... is it recent?
Karen Matthews: Uh, yeah, that's, uh, that's from last month.
Catherine: If it's all right with you, I'd like to borrow it. I'll get it to Nevada Child Search, and they can get it out to the media.
Karen Matthews: Sure.
Catherine: Thank you.
 
Karen Matthews: Jesse's home-schooled. We do art together ... music ... everything. 
(Catherine leans forward and notices the penciled lines on the side wall with indications of Jesse's height and age:
6 years - 36 1/2 &quot;
5 years - 34 &quot;
50 months
4 years - 31 1/3&quot;
 
Karen Matthews: Do you have children?
Catherine: I have a daughter. Thirteen.
Catherine: &quot;Thirty-six and a half inches.&quot; I'll add it to the physical description. And, Mrs. Matthews, our K-9 unit will need something with Jesse's scent.
Karen Matthews: Oh, right, right. Um ... maybe ... maybe his stuffed dinosaur? He holds it while he's sleeping.
Catherine: That'll work. And I will need something with his DNA: A toothbrush, hairbrush, pillowcase ...
Karen Matthews: Why do you need that?
Catherine: Well, if we locate anything that could lead us to him, we want to make sure we've got the right boy.
Karen Matthews: Well, I'll get those things for you.
 

 
 
Catherine: Hi. 
Officer Ackers: Hey. Captain Brass asked me to drive the lady's car home.
Catherine: Oh ... okay. Yeah, I'll let her know. 
 
Officer Ackers: Thanks.
Catherine: Mm-hmm.
 
(Catherine takes a moment and looks around the garage. She notices wrapped birthday presents stacked on the wall shelf. One of the labels reads:
HAPPY BIRTHDAY
JESSE!
LOVE, GRANDMA &amp; GRANDPA
(The next package she looks at is a Christmas present with the label:
TO: JESSE
FROM: GRANDPA &amp; GRANDMA
 
 
 
Ken McCracken: Since her husband died, kid's toys always laying around. I'm always tossing balls over my fence back into her yard. They keep to themselves, which is fine by me.
Greg: Sir, have you seen any suspicious cars in the neighborhood, or strangers?
Ken McCracken: I work all day and I don't spend my nights looking at the neighbors, okay?
Greg: Well, what about the weekends?

Greg: Aggressive little pooch. 
Ken McCracken: Oh, she's my sweetie. 
 
Ken McCracken: Who's my good girl? Queenie's my good girl. Yes, you are. Yes, you are.  Interesting how things work out.
Greg: What do you mean?
Ken McCracken: Her kid getting killed. This is Queenie. My last dog, Princess ... Princess died, and she did it.
Greg: Karen Matthews?
Ken McCracken: Four years ago. I found Princess hanging off the back fence. Supposed to look like it was an accident, like she got caught on collar and choked.
Greg: Did you see her do that?
Ken McCracken: No, but I knew. See, Princess used to bark through the fence at her kid. She just wanted to play.  If you ask me, you know what? The kid liked it, but Karen she just went off the deep end. 
Greg: Mr. McCracken, who told you her son was killed?


 
 
Catherine: Who takes care of the hamsters?
Karen Matthews: Jesse. When he remembers. Which is as about as often as he remembers to brush his teeth.
 
Catherine: Mrs. Matthews, has Jesse ever run away from home?
Karen Matthews:  He'd never do that.
 
Catherine: Was he upset about anything?
Karen Matthews: No. No. No. You're going to find him. If something happened, I'd know. 

Karen Matthews:  I'd know here. 
Catherine: Of course. I'd feel the same. 
 
Catherine: Mrs. Matthews, when the officer brought your car back, I noticed that there were gifts in the garage that were from your husband's parents.
Karen Matthews: The, um ... the colonel and his wife. We're, uh, we're not in touch anymore. Ever since Dwight was ... ever since Dwight died, my father-in-law thinks he should be raising Jesse, not me. He runs that house like an army barracks. Do you know what that does to a boy? Well, I saw what it did to Dwight, and I will not let him do that to Jesse.
Catherine: I'm still going to need some contact information.
 
Karen Matthews: They took him.




 
 


 


 
Warren Matthews: We haven't seen Karen or Jesse since, um ...  ... uh ... since ... 
Faye Matthews: We haven't seen them in four years, since the day we buried our son.

 
Warren Matthews:  Here. Here's your toy soldier.
 
Faye Matthews:  Warren, not today.
Warren Matthews:  He's my grandson. It-it's, it's a toy.
Karen Matthews:  I will raise my own son-- not you.

 
Warren Matthews: Jesse comes from a, from a long line of military men going all the way back to Bull Run. Were you in the service?
Brass: Yes, sir. Marine Corps.
Warren Matthews: I bet your dad was, too, right?
Brass: You know, we're here to talk about your family, not mine.
Faye Matthews: If we hadn't seen Jesse's picture last night on TV, we wouldn't know what he looked like now.
Warren Matthews: She blames me.
Faye Matthews: I do not.
Warren Matthews: Don't tell me what I know and don't know, all right?
Faye Matthews: Can I please just go to the bathroom?
Brass: Oh, absolutely. Absolutely.
Warren Matthews: Where is it?
Brass: It's. Uh ... down the hall to the right, through the door.
Faye Matthews: Excuse me.
 
Warren Matthews:  This is just between you and me. I saw Karen last week.
 
Warren Matthews: Oh, hi, Karen, uh, could I see Jesse please?
Karen Matthews: No.
 
Warren Matthews: Karen, he's my only grandson.
Karen Matthews: You can't have him, okay?
Warren Matthews: I don't want to keep him, Karen. I just want to give him these. Please.
 
Karen Matthews: Just leave us alone.
 
Warren Matthews: Jesse! It's Grandpa. Jesse!
Karen Matthews: No, please.
 
 
 
Brass:  Colonel?
 
Warren Matthews: Where's my wife?
Brass: She's in the ladies' room. It's okay. Do you get these uh ... these spells often? There's some memory loss?
Warren Matthews: It's early Alzheimer's.
Brass: That's a tough one.
Warren Matthews: All I wanted was to see my grandson. Find him for me.
Brass: We'll do our best, sir. We'll do our very best.


 
 
Warrick: Any luck with those prints from the swing?
Sara: Nothing on AFIS, but Brass did put out a bulletin for the guy in the blue baseball cap.
Warrick: I wouldn't get our hopes up -- it's a vague description.
Sara: What about the K-9 search?
Warrick: Nothing.
 
 
Warrick: What do you got for me?
 
Wendy Simms: Well, I ran the exemplar toothbrush against a blood sample from the men's room. It's not a match.
Warrick: What about the underpants?
Wendy Simms: Couldn't get enough epithelials for DNA 'cause the kid probably hadn't been wearing them for very long.
(The label on the evidence bag reads:

Evidence Description: BOYS UNDERPANTS
Location: Mesa Valley Park Men's Room
Warrick: I wonder why.
Wendy Simms: Well, I did confirm a positive result for urea in the underpants. And the quantity and distribution suggests that the kid wet himself.
Warrick: Ditched his wet tighty-whiteys and went back out to play. 
 
Wendy Simms: I got a hit on your blood. Conner Daly. Convicted of NRS
201.450. Out on parole.

Warrick: What's a 450?
Wendy Simms: That'd be &quot;s*x with dead body.&quot;

 
 
Warrick: Mr. Daly, where were you yesterday afternoon?
Conner Daly: Playing nickel slots downtown. I, uh .... I'm not trying to win the big jackpot or anything; just passing time. It relaxes me. 
 
Warrick: Where did you go next?
Conner Daly: Walked in the park. Fresh air. I'm allergic to smoke.
 
Warrick: Which park?
Conner Daly: One near my apartment.
 
Warrick: Would that be Mesa Valley Park?
Conner Daly:  Yeah. Then I sat down on a park bench and read a copy of the RJ that I picked out of the trash. What's this about?
Warrick: Did you go to the men's room at any time?
Conner Daly: Only when nature called.
Warrick: What did you do there?
Conner Daly: I amused myself.
Warrick: What did you do next? We found your blood on the floor.
Conner Daly: I get nosebleeds. Too much cocaine back in the day.
Warrick: Yeah. I'm sure we'll find that in your medical records. 
 
Conner Daly:  My whole damn life is on record. So, why don't you look at the freakin' records, huh?
Warrick: You have anger issues, Mr. Daly?
 
Conner Daly: Yeah.
Warrick: Would you take a seat for me, please. 
 
Warrick: What's that cut on your hand from? Pick the wrong partner?
Conner Daly:  No.
 
 
 
Conner Daly: Look, I'll send the county a buck-fifty. They can buy a new one.
Warrick: You recognize this boy?
 
Conner Daly: Looks like a kid that this guy brought into the bathroom but I didn't stay to watch.
Warrick: Did you get a look at the guy?
Conner Daly:  51's fan.
 
Conner Daly: His cap.

 
 
Paula Francis:  Las Vegas police may have a break in the case of a missing boy. An eyewitness has come forward with a more complete description of the suspect.
 
Paula Francis:  Authorities are now seeking this man in connection with the disappearance yesterday of six-year-old Jesse Matthews.

 
Paula Francis:  Initial reports from the scene only mention a man in a blue cap, but the police artist had a lot more to work with after the eyewitness came forward.
 
Karen Matthews:  Uh, uh ... I'm ju ... I'm just trying to stay positive. And, um, you know, I know that Jesse'll be safe at home again soon. 
Reporter :  Do you think there's anything else the police ...
Karen Matthews:  So. I know he'll be safe.
 
Paula Francis:  The boy's mother, Karen, is holding out hope that she'll see her son again. She's seen tragedy enough. Four years ago, she lost her husband in combat in Afghanistan.

 
 
 
Valerie Esposito: What's going on? 
 
 
Victor Esposito:  It's ridiculous.
 
Clerk: Sorry. Declined again. You have another card?
Victor Esposito: Aw, come on. That's the fourth time.
Valerie Esposito: Maybe we got identity theft-ed or something.
 
Valerie Esposito:  Hey, hey, leave that candy alone.
Clerk: It could be the card-reader. My manager'll be right back. If you guys want to get some coffee, it's on the house.
 
Brass: All right. Let's go.
 
Brass: Las Vegas police. You're under arrest.
Victor Esposito: What? VALERIE ESPOSITO: What?
 
Clerk: That's the kid from the news, right?
Brass: Yeah. You did good.
 
Valerie Esposito: What? 
Victor Esposito: Yeah, what the hell is going on here?
 
Valerie Esposito: Hey, let go of me. 
Victor Esposito: What are you arresting us for? Huh?
Valerie Esposito: Let go of me, huh! What the hell is going on here? 
Victor Esposito: What's going on? What are you arresting us for?!
Valerie Esposito: Get away from him. Get away from him!
 
Brass: It's all right, son. You're safe now ..

 
 
Karen Matthews: Oh, God, where is he?
Catherine: He's in with a social worker. He's okay. 
Karen Matthews: Jesse! 
 
Karen Matthews: Jesse! 
 
Karen Matthews: Oh, Jesse, thank God. Thank God you're okay. No, no, no, it's okay. Mommy is here. You're safe now.
 
Adam Esposito:  Mommy!
 
Adam Esposito: Mommy! 
Valerie Esposito: Adam!
Adam Esposito: Mommy!
 
Valerie Esposito: Adam! 
Karen Matthews:  No, your mommy's here, honey.
Valerie Esposito: No, please.  Get away from my kid!
 
Karen Matthews:  What did they say to you? 
Victor Esposito:  Adam! Don't say nothing!
Karen Matthews: What did they make you say, sweetheart?
Victor Esposito:  Look at me. Don't say nothing to nobody. You hear me, little man, huh? Don't say nothing!
 
 
Karen Matthews: Look at me. Just look at me. Don't look at those people. Just look at me. Just look right here.
 
Catherine: Jim?
Warrick: What the hell's going on?
Brass: That's Victor and Valerie Esposito. Transplants from Jersey. Check this out. 
 
Brass: It was with Mrs. Esposito's personal belongings at booking.
 
Catherine: He's got the same scar over his eye as in Karen's photos.
Warrick: So this kid has two moms?
Brass: King Solomon threatened to cut the baby in half. What are you going to do?
Catherine: King Solomon didn't have a DNA lab.

 
Karen Matthews: Here you go, sweetie.
 
Catherine: Hey, is it all right if he goes with CSI Brown for a little while? It won't be long.
 
Karen Matthews:  Okay.
Warrick: Hey. My name's Warrick. You want to go for a walk?
Karen Matthews: It's okay, sweetheart. He's a friend.
 
Warrick: Come on, we'll have some fun.
 
Karen Matthews: Oh, wait.
 
Karen Matthews: He gets cold.
 
Warrick: Thanks.
 
Karen Matthews: Thank you.
 



;



 
 
 
Warrick: Wow, everybody's so busy in there, huh? Hey, I hear you like dinosaurs. Which one's your favorite?
 
Warrick: You know what mine is? T-rex. 'Cause he's got teeth like this big. 
(Warrick hold out his hands to show the size of the teeth. Grudgingly, Adam looks sideways at Warrick, but he doesn't turn around. And he doesn't say anything.
Warrick: I bet you wouldn't want him for a pet, would you? 
 
Warrick: You want to see something cool? Come over here. Let's sit down.
 
Warrick: This is my special science kit. 
 
Warrick: Got all kinds of stuff in here. Let me see ... I got rubber gloves.
 
Warrick: Here ... put that on.  What else I got in here? I got pens that turn into flashlights. 
 
Warrick: You want to see something invisible? Go like this.
 
Warrick: See, there's nothing there, right? 
 
Warrick: But take my magic wand right here, and I put it in my special magic powder like this.  Watch this. 
 
Warrick: What appears is our fingerprints.  Now shine the flashlight on it. 
 
Warrick: Wow ... Good job. Will you be my assistant? 
 
Warrick: See, no two people's fingerprints are alike. Just like no two people's spit is the same. 
 
Warrick: So if I took my spit like this ... 
 
Warrick: Now you do it.
 
Warrick: See, even if I mix them up, I have a machine to tell me which one is mine and which one is yours. Now, I need you to tell me something. 
 
Warrick: Which one of these two pretty ladies is your mom?
Adam Esposito: That one.
 

 
 
Catherine: Thank you.
Valerie Esposito: Yeah, whatever. Can I see Adam now?
Catherine: Adam?
Valerie Esposito: Yeah. My kid.
Catherine: Well, once our lab confirms DNA, he can go home with his mother.
Valerie Esposito: Who the hell do you think I am?
Catherine: Mrs. Esposito ... did you adopt Adam?
Valerie Esposito:  Give me a break. Twenty-six hours in labor. Finally had a c-section.
 
 
Catherine:  Did you have twins?
 

 
 
Karen Matthews: Hi. Can I take Jesse home now?
Catherine: I need your help to tie up a few loose ends.
Karen Matthews: Of course, anything.
Catherine: Let's start with a sample of your DNA.
Karen Matthews: What?
Catherine: We have to follow procedure for everyone's protection. In fact, Jesse can't even be released without a positive match.
Karen Matthews: You know, he doesn't stay up this late.
Catherine: I'll make it a rush, I promise. 
 
Catherine: Open your mouth, please.
 

 
 
Catherine: It's the same kid. It's a doppelganger, with an identical scar.
Warrick: He picked Mrs. Esposito.
Catherine: I know there's cases in which the kidnappers threatened their victims, &quot;Tell them that I'm your mother or I'll kill your real mom.&quot;
Warrick: I don't think he's lying.
Catherine: I don't think that Mrs. Esposito's lying either. Karen Matthews had a house full of photos of him.
Warrick: Well, I'm sure the Espositos do, too.
 
Catherine: There's something off about this picture.
Warrick: It seems kind of set up, doesn't it?
 
Warrick: The pixel density's not the same.

 
 
Valerie Esposito: Where'd she get this picture of Adam? How'd she get it?
Victor Esposito: Maybe she's a stalker.
Valerie Esposito: No, she wouldn't have stalked us to Cape May. This isn't it. It's the only shore we've been to.
Catherine: Do you recognize anything in the picture?
Valerie Esposito: Yeah, that's the shirt his Nana gave him last summer. He only wore it that once, at our family reunion.
Catherine: Was Karen Matthews there?
Victor Esposito: No way.
Catherine: Mr. Esposito ... several witnesses saw a man matching your description at Mesa Valley Park ...  ... when Jesse disappeared.
Victor Esposito: Yeah, I'm there all the time. We live around the corner.
Valerie Esposito: We just had Adam's birthday party there last month.
Victor Esposito: Yeah.
Catherine: Were you there the day before yesterday?
Victor Esposito: Yeah, with Adam. Yeah.
 
Valerie Esposito: You told me you were taking him for ice cream. What were you doing in the park?
Victor Esposito: I had to meet a guy.
Valerie Esposito: A guy? Oh, my God. You're putting money down on a game? You promised you'd quit.
Victor Esposito: I did, all right? It's for a guy at work.
 
 
Victor Esposito: Three-to-one, right?
Bookie: Yeah.
 
Victor Esposito:  Adam.
 
Valerie Esposito: Well, you should have just took him for ice cream.

 
 
Warrick: So Karen took a picture of herself at the beach and Photoshopped Jesse in.
Archie Johnson: Right.
Warrick: So if that's really Adam Esposito, where did she get the pictures from?
Archie Johnson: Well, let us see.
 
Warrick: Where are you going?
Archie Johnson: Image search.
 
Archie Johnson: Family home page. My mom wants me to do one of these for our family.
Warrick: Ah. Click on where it says &quot;Adam's Birthday Party.&quot;
 
Warrick: That one.
Archie Johnson: Maybe Karen found the site. Cut out the kid's picture.
Warrick: That's Mesa Valley Park.

 
 
Warrick: Karen Matthews faked those photos that she gave Catherine.
Grissom: How?
Warrick: Cut-and-paste. The photos that she got off the Internet.
 
Grissom: The Espositos told Catherine that they were at the park with their son the day Jesse Matthews disappeared. Is that a coincidence?
Warrick: No. My guess is Karen's been downloading pictures from the family website for a while -- the most recent being from Mesa Valley Park.
Grissom: Could Karen have recognized the park from the pictures on the website?
Warrick: Yeah, and she went there hoping to see him again.
Grissom: But she reported him missing. That makes no sense.
 
Catherine: Hey, I got the DNA results. The boy is Adam Esposito. Victor and Valerie are his parents.
Warrick: There you go, she's lying. She doesn't have a son.
Catherine: Uh, not quite. She's got 13 alleles in common with the male DNA that we got from the toothbrush exemplar.
Grissom: So she does have a son.
Catherine: I was inside the house. Believe me, a kid does live there.
Grissom: And we're still looking for Jesse Matthews.




 
 
Brass: Karen Matthews.
 
Karen Matthews: Can I take Jesse home now?
Brass: I'm afraid not. No. The DNA confirms the boy's not your child.
Karen Matthews: I ... that's impossible.
Brass: Your actions regarding the Espositos constitutes stalking and possible kidnapping. Please go with this officer.
Karen Matthews: No, no ... what have you done with Jesse?
Brass: Ma'am ...
Karen Matthews: No. Where is he?
 
Officer: Ma'am ... Please ... 
Karen Matthews: Jesse?
Officer: Ma'am ...
Karen Matthews: Jesse? Jesse, where are you?!
 
Officer: Ma'am, please ...
 
Karen Matthews: I need to see my son!  Jesse! Jesse, where are you?!
 
Karen Matthews:  Please! Please! Jesse! Jesse! Jesse, where are you?!

 
 
Greg: &quot;Jesse David Matthews. Mother Karen, father Dwight. Born August 31, 1999.&quot; I also checked for a death certificate. Nothing on file.
Catherine: These are all in chronological order. Archie confirmed that all the photos taken along the top row were genuine. Up until the photo taken at the funeral in which he was two.
Sara: So, the rest of these were faked using Adam Esposito?
Catherine: Yeah.
Sara:  You talked to the neighbors. What did they say?
Greg: Jesse and Karen kept to themselves. But he was always leaving his toys around outside.
Sara: They saw his toys -- Did they see him?
Greg: Well, when I asked, &quot;When was the last time you saw Jesse?&quot; No one remembered exactly.
Warrick: What about his grandparents?
Catherine: They haven't seen him since the funeral.
Warrick: Has anyone seen Jesse since he was two? His teachers or a doctor, baby-sitters ... ?
Catherine: Well, he was home-schooled. And we're looking into a doctor and a sitter.
Warrick: Well, I guess we can impound her car and find out if there's any evidence that he was even in there.
Catherine: For four years she's created an elaborate fantasy -- which collided with reality at Mesa Valley Park.
 
 
Karen Matthews: Jesse.
 
Voice: Mommy! 
 
Karen Matthews: Jesse? Where are you?! Jesse?!
 
Warrick: I suppose she thought it was her son that was gone when she looked back at that empty swing.
Catherine: When she couldn't find him, she called the police. 
Sara: Jesse's been missing for four years. We're chasing a ghost.
 

 
 
Karen Matthews: We went to the park. I-I brought Jesse's new jacket. He was on the swings and when I wasn't looking, a man in a blue cap took him.
Catherine: Karen, tell me what happened four years ago after your husband was killed.
Karen Matthews: I-I ... that's a ... I am not the one that should be here. You should be talking to the man that took Jesse.
Catherine: Did Jesse get sick? Was there an accident?
 
Catherine: Karen? Did something happen to Jesse? Is Jesse dead?
Karen Matthews: You saw him. You were ... you were there while I held him in my arms. Why are you putting me through this? Tell me. Why?

 
 
Greg: So how do we do this?
Warrick: Old school. Soil probes. The probe goes deeper where the soil's been disturbed.
 
Greg: And that's where we dig?
Sara: On the one hand, you really want to find the body. Give it respect, provide closure ... on the other hand ... 
Warrick: Yeah.
 
 
Warrick: She would have buried the body where he would have still been close to her.
Sara: You know, I'm not finding any density changes.
Greg: Me neither.
 
Warrick: Somebody replaced this fence board right here. These other ones look like they've been chewed on.
Greg: Guy said that Karen freaked out when his dog barked at her kid. Maybe the dog chewed through the fence.
 
Warrick: There's definitely a change in density there.
Sara: Let's start digging.

 
 

 
Catherine: I found this in Karen's medicine chest. Olanzapine.
 
Grissom: That's a heavy-duty antipsychotic.
Catherine: Yeah. But the prescription is over four years old. I'll have Brass subpoena her medical records.
Grissom: You know, if she was being treated for psychosis, it could explain all of this, because she didn't overlook a single detail. I think she even did the finger paintings.
Catherine: It's hard for anyone to let go of someone they love.
Grissom: Yeah. After my dad died, my mom would still get him a present every Christmas. She'd put it under the tree. Christmas morning, the wrapping paper would be all crumpled up and, uh ... the tie or the sweater, whatever it was, would be hanging in their closet.
Catherine: How old were you when he died?
 
Grissom: Nine.
Catherine: Little guy.  I'll get started in Karen's room.
 
Grissom:  He taught botany. He, uh ... came home from school one hot, humid day, laid down on the couch. I was watching TV. My mom brought in some cold drinks ... but she couldn't wake him up. 
 
Grissom: No one would tell me why.

 
 
 
Receptionist:  Nick Stokes, you have a visitor in reception. Nick Stokes, you have a visitor in reception.
 
 
 
Nick: Hey, Hodges.
 
Hodges: Oh, hey, Nick. Did you hear you had a visitor?
Nick: Yeah, and you have a tissue sample with adherent hairs. Examine the hairs and get the tissue sample to DNA. Priority.
Hodges: I'll just drop everything I'm doing. Priority, Nick Stokes.
Nick: You're coming around, Hodges.
 
 
 
Nick: Hey. I, uh, I have a visitor?
 
 
Nick: Kelly?
Kelly Gordon: Hi.
Nick: Hi. You ... you got out.
Kelly Gordon: Couple days ago. 
Nick:  Mm ... 
Kelly Gordon: Parole Hearing Board liked my smile.
 
Nick: You know, I thought I saw you at a crime scene the other day.
Kelly Gordon: You did.
Nick: I did?
Kelly Gordon: Just checking it out.  You know how, when you came to see me, what you said about when I get out, not taking it with me? I've been thinking a lot about that. I wanted you to know.
Nick: You all right?
Kelly Gordon: Perfect.
 

 
 
 
 
Greg: That would be Queenie.

Sara: Even after four years, you'd expect to find some bones. There's nothing.
 
Warrick: Jesse liked dinosaurs.
 
 
Greg: Let's see what Hodges can tell us.
 

 
 
Grissom: The GCMS soil analysis found cadaverine, putrescine and several other organic compounds.
Brass: Yeah. English, please?
Grissom: It means there was a body buried in Karen's backyard. 
Catherine: Just too long ago to get any DNA. But Hodges also found traces of olanzapine.
Brass: Well, that's interesting, because a warrant came through on Karen Matthews' medical records, and after her son was born, Karen was treated for postpartum psychosis, which her doctors treated by prescribing olanzapine.
Grissom: Even a small amount of that stuff would be lethal to a two-year-old.
Catherine: Karen is already mentally fragile when her husband is killed. She gets into a very heated argument with the in-laws at his funeral, goes over the deep end, poisons Jesse and buries him in the backyard near the fence.

 
 
 
Brass:  But then she digs him up. Why?
Grissom:  We have evidence to suggest that the neighbor's dog ... 
 
 
Grissom: ... was digging in Karen's backyard. 
Catherine: The neighbor claims that Karen killed his dog. If the dog detected decomp and dug near the grave, ... 
 
 
Catherine:  Karen may have moved the body to protect him.
Brass:  So, where's Jesse's body?
 
Catherine: Nick found a patch of tissue and hair in trunk of Karen's car. The DNA matches the toothbrush. 
Grissom: If Karen doesn't tell us where to look, I doubt we'll ever find the body.
Brass: You know, as long as I do this job, I can never understand ... 
 
 
Brass:  ... how a mother can kill her child.
 
Grissom: Euripedes tried to understand it when he wrote Medea. &quot;I will slay my children without delaying long enough to hand them over to some more savage hand.&quot;
 
 
Grissom:  Medea, like Karen, was a soldier's wife.
Catherine:  His father was a soldier, his grandfather was a soldier, ... 
 
 
Catherine: ... Karen did not want that for Jesse.
Brass: Well, it's still murder.
 
 
 
 
Voice:  Mommy ... Mommy!

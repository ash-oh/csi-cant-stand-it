<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. SIDEWALK OUT FRONT OF RESIDENCE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(A boy and a girl kiss out on the front sidewalk.)</p>
<p><strong>Teenaged Girl</strong>: I'm so sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Teenaged Boy</strong>: I got to go, baby.</p>
<p>(He pulls away from her and starts to walk away.)</p>
<p><strong>Teenaged Girl</strong>: I'll call you tomorrow.</p>
<p>(The camera moves beyond them and into the house next door.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. PHELPS' RESIDENCE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(TRAVIS PHELPS plays a video game on the television.)</p>
<p><strong>Matthew Phelps</strong>: Get it off. I'm not going to say it again.</p>
<p><strong>Travis Phelps</strong>: Dad, just five more minutes and I'll be on level nine.</p>
<p><strong>Matthew Phelps</strong>: Now!</p>
<p>(AIMEE PHELPS walks out into the living room in her pajamas.)</p>
<p><strong>Aimee Phelps</strong>: Dad! You said I can watch nickelodeon.</p>
<p><strong>Matthew Phelps</strong>: You've watched enough tv for tonight. It's time to go to bed.</p>
<p><strong>Aimee Phelps</strong>: How come he doesn't have to?</p>
<p><strong>Matthew Phelps</strong>: Both of you, bed now!</p>
<p>(AIMEE PHELPS turns around and stomps off to her room. MATTHEW PHELPS walks up to the television set and turns it off.)</p>
<p><strong>Travis Phelps</strong>: Dad! You got to save it first!</p>
<p><strong>Matthew Phelps</strong>: This game saves it automatically.</p>
<p>(TRAVIS PHELPS stands up to go to bed. He passes by the table and grabs the can of soda.)</p>
<p><strong>Matthew Phelps</strong>: Oh, no, no, you know how much sugar's in that thing?</p>
<p>(As MATTHEW PHELPS stands to take the can of soda, gunshots burst in through the living room window.)</p>
<p><strong>Matthew Phelps</strong>: Get down!</p>
<p>(MATTHEW PHELPS dives for his son and covers him. The gunfire continues.)</p>
<p>(Outside, tires screech by.)</p>
<p><strong>Matthew Phelps</strong>: (shouts) Son, are you all right?</p>
<p>(His son, scared out of his wits, doesn't answer. MATTHEW PHELPS looks up.)</p>
<p><strong>Matthew Phelps</strong>: Aimee?</p>
<p>(MATTHEW climbs to his feet and runs to his daughter's room.</p>
<p><strong>Matthew Phelps</strong>: Aimee! Aimee! Aim ..</p>
<p>(He turns the corner and sees her room in shambles. The bullets tore through everything. And on the bed is his little girl, dead.)</p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. PHELPS RESIDENCE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The lights of the Emergency vehicles parked in the driveway flash in the night. A large crowd of neighbors and curious on-lookers has gathered outside the taped off area.)</p>
<p>(WARRICK and GRISSOM make their way toward BRASS.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Didn't you grow up in this neighborhood?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, not too far away. My grandmother still lives down the block. Lot of familiar faces.</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: Hey, Brown, you going to find the guy who did this?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We're going to do our jobs.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Jason Gilbert. Shot through and through. He going to be all right, though.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What was he doing here?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Visiting his girlfriend next door. He hit the deck when the shooting started. Didn't see a car.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Drive-by. His girlfriend see anything?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Nobody saw a thing. Little girl inside wasn't so lucky. Aimee Phelps, age nine.</p>
<p>(WARRICK starts at the name.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Phelps?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Father operates a rec center down the block.</p>
<p>(WARRICK heads for the house. GRISSOM notes WARRICK'S response.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. PHELPS' RESIDENCE - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(MATTHEW PHELPS holds a doll tightly in his hands. His head is lowered and his eyes closed.)</p>
<p>(WARRICK walks into the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What happened, man?</p>
<p><strong>Matthew Phelps</strong>: They killed my baby.</p>
<p>(He puts his head down and starts to cry. WARRICK puts a supportive hand on the man's shoulder.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (softly) I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks into the house and as he does with any other crime scene, he starts looking around.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I got here as quick as I could. What happened?</p>
<p><strong>Matthew Phelps</strong>: Cops said they were aiming at some white kid. I thought I was making a difference.</p>
<p>(MATTHEW PHELPS closes his eyes and starts to cry again.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You are making a difference. I'm living proof. I'm sorry.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks further into the house and notes the bullet hole in the bookshelf.)</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV to: Camera zooms forward taking the path of the bullet, through the cabinet, through the wall, through the pillow, and finally lodging in the little girl. End of CGI POV.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. PHELPS' RESIDENCE - AIMEE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM appears in the bedroom doorway. He walks inside and approaches the little girl's body on the bed. He kneels down next to the body and turns on his flashlight, noting the bullet hole under her chin.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM also notes the bullet hole in the wall. He stands up and goes to look at it. WARRICK appears in the doorway. He sees the body on the bed. He pulls out his gloves and sits down on the bed. He reaches out to touch the body. GRISSOM turns around and notes WARRICK'S behavior.)</p>
<p>(WARRICK sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You going to be able to handle this?</p>
<p>(WARRICK looks up at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (grimly) I want this case.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<hr />
[INT. PHELPS' RESIDENCE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(WARRICK examines the empty display shelf.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Matt told me his house was broken into about a week ago. They took all of his awards, his medals. Everything in this case. I hope whoever took it, it meant as much to them as it did to him.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM examines the bullet holes in the wall. He sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, we're obviously looking for an automatic.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No doubt. All this damage.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The bullets went through the glass, shed their jackets or disintegrated completely on impact with the wall.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV of the bullet hitting the wall and disintegrating. End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: All we have left are lead cores, which are of no comparison value.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and WARRICK look up as the Coroners remove the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The only bullet that may help us is inside that little girl.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. HYPERTRIX -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(NICK and DET. SAM VEGA walk up toward the business' front door.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hypertrix? Sounds like a breakfast cereal.</p>
<p><strong>Vega</strong>: Some internet service thing. I stopped thinking about that stuff when I found out my NASDAQ fund was worth less than my son's comic book collection.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Dot com ... dot bomb.</p>
<p><strong>Vega</strong>: The office floor where the DB's located is restricted-- authorized employees only.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I'll need the access log.</p>
<p><strong>Vega</strong>: I already spoke to building security.</p>
<p>(VEGA hands NICK a sheet of paper.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Cool.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. HYPERTRIX - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(DET. VEGA and NICK enter the office floor. The room is completely white.)</p>
<p><strong>Vega</strong>: Night shift started at 6:00 P.M.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: And since then, four people have entered the building, and nobody left.</p>
<p><strong>Vega</strong>: Three of them are still breathing.</p>
<p>(They stop in front of a secured door with a card key access. VEGA slips the card key through the reader. The door beeps, then opens.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. HYPERTRIX - COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(The door opens and NICK and DET. VEGA walk in. Immediately, NICK feels the temperature change.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Ooh. Hey, David.</p>
<p>(DAVID PHILLIPS is already inside the room kneeling before the body taking the body temperature.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Nick. Cool enough in here for you?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I'll manage. Most computers dissipate over two thirds of the energy they consume as heat. A/C's here for them, not the worker bees.</p>
<p><strong>Vega</strong>: Victim's name's Garret Kwan. Job title, CTO.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Chief Technology Officer. T.O.D.?</p>
<p>(DAVID PHILLIPS looks at the digital temperature gauge. It reads 86.3 degrees F.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Ambient here's about 65 degrees, which makes core temp drop roughly two degrees per hour. Figure he's been dead five to seven hours.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Apparent blunt force trauma. Minimal seepage around the wound. No blood on the floor. The paramedics roll him?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Uh, yeah. Said they found him face down, head towards the rack.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (to VEGA) Any sign of a weapon?</p>
<p><strong>Vega</strong>: Nothing obvious. No windows. Only one way in or out.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, but there's plenty of places to hide.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Someone hitting GARRETT KWAN over the back of the head from behind. He takes the hit and goes down. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay. One dead boss. Three live employees. I like the odds.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS COMMUNITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<hr />
[EXT. PHELPS' RESIDENCE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Evidence markers #2 &amp; #3 are put down on the ground next to blood spatter out on the sidewalk.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, Jason Gilbert, the kid who was shot, not too popular in the neighborhood. Just in a fight last week, down the street.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You saw his girl. She was hot. They're probably macking on her.<br />
(pause) Matt said he heard tires screech.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: And the bullets went from right to left.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Uh-huh. (BRASS figures it out and points somewhere to WARRICK'S left.)<br />
Over there?</p>
<p>(WARRICK turns his head and they both head in that direction. They find a mailbox overturned.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You know, it's a federal offense to be messing with the postal service.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Took that corner pretty hard, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(WARRICK takes a picture of the overturned mailbox. He picks the mailbox up and turns it right-side up.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Doesn't that dent look a little high to you? Like a truck or an SUV?</p>
<p>(WARRICK takes a picture of the dent.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: An SUV rounds the corner, tires screeching and hits the mailbox, making the dent and knocking it over. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'm not just another pretty face, you know.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: There's a silver paint transfer, though, right here.</p>
<p>(WARRICK points to the portion of the dent where the mailbox made contact with the vehicle.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Captain.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p>(They both turn around.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Just got a call. PJ's tavern, a few block away. Guy was brandishing an automatic weapon. They're holding him at the site.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<hr />
[EXT. P.J.'S TAVERN -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The Owner of the Tavern talks to the OFFICER. WARRICK and BRASS approach them.)</p>
<p><strong>Owner</strong>: This guy's a punk.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hey, tell me what you're telling him.</p>
<p><strong>Owner</strong>: (pointing) This guy's no good. He's been in here before, and every time it's trouble, so this time, I exercised my right not to serve him. You know what the little freak does? Lifts up his jacket, and shows me a piece. I tell him to take a hike.</p>
<p>(WARRICK looks over at GENE JAYCOBS who has suddenly taken an interest in WARRICK. His eyes never leave WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p>(WARRICK notes with interest the semi-automatic weapon that the OFFICER confiscated from GENE JAYCOBS.)</p>
<p><strong>Owner</strong>: Then he proceeds to tell me how I better watch my back, 'cause it wouldn't be the first time tonight he killed somebody.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No kidding. All right.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Jay ... Jacobs?</p>
<p><strong>Owner</strong>: No, it's Gene Jaycobs.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Gene Jaycobs. I knew that kid. I went to school with him. He got kicked out.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Okay, let's see what the lad has to say for himself. Thanks a lot.</p>
<p>(WARRICK puts on his latex gloves as he and BRASS head for GENE JAYCOBS.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hey, Gene! What's happening! Uncuff him.</p>
<p><strong>Gene Jaycobs</strong>: (to WARRICK) Do I know you?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (doesn't answer the question) Put your hands out in front of you.</p>
<p><strong>Gene Jaycobs</strong>: (nods) Oh, it's like that, huh?</p>
<p>(WARRICK takes a sample off of GENE JAYCOBS' hands.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I can process this now. It would tell me if you fired a gun within the last couple of hours. But I'm going to take this back to the lab, make you sweat it out.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Okay, officer, I think someone needs their cuffs put back on.</p>
<p>(The officers put the handcuffs back on GENE JAYCOBS. WARRICK walks away.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. HYPERTRIX - WHITE OFFICE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(TODD BENTON sits down in his chair.)</p>
<p><strong>Todd Benton</strong>: I know what that is. You're checking me for blood spatter. I watch the discovery channel. (beat) I found the body, I called the police. Not too smart, if I'm the one who killed the guy.</p>
<p>(TODD BENTON is talking to the wall. Or rather, he's practicing to himself. He pauses and evaluates what he says.)</p>
<p><strong>Todd Benton</strong>: (quietly): That's good.</p>
<p>(He stands up a little ... just enough to look over the wall. He sees NICK and DET. VEGA standing on the far end of the room. He sits back down.)</p>
<p><strong>Todd Benton</strong>: (muttering) Not too ... not too smart, if I'm the one who ... </p>
<p>(NICK and DET. VEGA approach TODD BENTON'S desk.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mr. Benton, could you stand up for me, please?</p>
<p>(TODD BENTON stands. NICK takes out his ALS and checks for blood. Just as he rehearsed, TODD BENTON runs through his lines.)</p>
<p><strong>Todd Benton</strong>: I know what that ... is. I know what that is. You're checking me for blood spatter. I watch the discovery channel. Look, I ... I found the body, I called the police. Not too smart, if I'm the one who killed the guy.</p>
<p><strong>Vega</strong>: Thanks for pointing that out. When was the last time you saw Garret Kwan?</p>
<p><strong>Todd Benton</strong>: I didn't; not tonight. I was working. Working halfway to carpal tunnel syndrome. So-called ergonomic chairs. Should be a crime, if you ask me. The chairs are ... okay, you know, it's, it's not like my office has a good view of the door. You should be talking to Charlie. Charlie has the good view.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Charlie?</p>
<p>(TODD BENTON points to the desk behind NICK. NICK turns around and sees the empty desk. He looks back at TODD BENTON.)</p>
<p><strong>Todd Benton</strong>: Yeah, okay, yeah, um, Charlie ... Charlie doesn't work here anymore, so that doesn't really help you.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Could you hold your hands out for me, please? </p>
<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. HYPERTRIX - WHITE OFFICES -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(NICK is checking out ANDERS MOLYNEAUX. He checks a swab.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Pretty easy to see the door to the server farm from here.</p>
<p><strong>Anders Molyneaux</strong>: That is a fact. And here's another. I didn't see anything. I was coding. Link. Compile. Debug. All night. The work absorbs me.</p>
<p><strong>Vega</strong>: What kind of work?</p>
<p><strong>Anders Molyneaux</strong>: My code monitors internet traffic and server load.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So you make your computer watch other computers that other people are watching?</p>
<p><strong>Anders Molyneaux</strong>: Just because you can't see the beauty in data flow doesn't mean it doesn't exist.</p>
<p><strong>Vega</strong>: What was your relationship to Garret Kwan?</p>
<p><strong>Anders Molyneaux</strong>: I'm employee number seven. Kwan was employee number six. Big brain by reputation, my boss by random chance.</p>
<p>(NICK looks at VEGA. VEGA nods.)</p>
<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. HYPERTRIX - WHITE OFFICES -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(NICK and VEGA question SERENA CHASE.)</p>
<p><strong>Serena Chase</strong>: You know, they, um, they confiscated all my murder weapons when I left Microsoft, so I don't know if you'll find anything.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, you don't exactly fit the corporate image.</p>
<p><strong>Serena Chase</strong>: Well, it's my image, the company doesn't get a say in it.</p>
<p><strong>Vega</strong>: Looks like you get special treatment around here.</p>
<p><strong>Serena Chase</strong>: Yeah, well, I earn it. I optimize 'net infrastructure. I saved this company $8.3 mill last year. Got a five-figure bonus. And, uh, yes, I did see Garret go into the server farm around 6:00, 6:30.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So your boss is laying there dead for five and a half hours plus, and you never even notice he's gone.</p>

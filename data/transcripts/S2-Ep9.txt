Craps Player: Five! Baby, go!
Craps Player: Seven. Whoo!

Dealer: Changing $100.

Max Duncan: Change $100, go ahead.


CUT TO:

Security: Section G-3 all clear. On route to H-4. And then soft count.

CUT TO:







CUT TO:

Security: Section G-4. SECURITY: Security three intersect at G-5. SECURITY: Where the hell is metro?!
CUT TO:


CUT TO:



Grissom: And the body count?
Brass: Five guards, three civilians wounded. One dead bad guy. Armed robbers snatched the lock boxes from the two high-stakes tables right off the rolling cage.
Grissom: Cash on wheels.
Brass: Busiest time of night. Three women-organized and muscled.
Grissom: Small time crooks, Jim.
Brass: Hey, they got away with 250K.
Grissom: Yeah? That's a mere pittance to a Vegas casino. Cashiers alone are sitting on a million and change.

Brass: Small time or not these ladies are dangerous.

Grissom: Dangerous, yes. Ladies ...

Grissom: ... no.

HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS





Warrick: These guys packed enough .45 caliber ammo for a small army.

Nick: Security managed to return a few rounds. Nine millimeter.
Warrick: Less than a year ago security couldn't even carry guns.
Nick: Times have changed.
Warrick: Yeah.
CUT TO:


Brass: The same M.O. as Laughlin. Last month, cottage casino, men dressed as women shot the place to hell. In and out in under five.
Grissom: My bet was that that was the practice run.
Brass: And the more you practice ...

Max Duncan: I don't know what the hell's going on with the world. Everything's crazy. I risk my life just coming into work. Makes you miss the mob days, huh? Back then, this never would've happened. And if it did, those scumbags, they'd be dead, every last one of them and we would never know about it.
Brass: Mr ... Mr. Duncan -- take a deep breath and tell us what happened.
Max Duncan: We'd just made a money transfer to the rolling cages. Then, bang-- the chandelier comes crashing down. Sounded like an explosion. So I dropped to my knees-- I took cover.
Brass: Anything else?
Max Duncan: Yeah, I started praying for the gunfire to stop.
Brass: Okay. Thanks a lot. And check in with triage before you leave. 

Brass: Well, that was helpful.
Grissom:  Actually, it was. Gives us a starting point.

Grissom:  The falling chandelier distracts the guards. Makes them easy targets.

Grissom: The armed robbers load up, head for the exits.
Brass: Quick escape.
Grissom: Chaos moving in one direction, the money moving in the other.
CUT TO:




Catherine: Can you imagine living out here?
Sara: It's peaceful.
Catherine: Peaceful? The town just lost five percent of its population.
Sara: I thought you said this was a single homicide.
Catherine: Yeah, in a population of 20.

Sara: We made it. State trooper.

Officer Spencer: Two hours to drive 75 miles. You guys got lost.
Catherine: What's the rush? Crime scene's not going anywhere.
Officer Spencer: Yeah, but I am. Body's behind the counter. Dustin Bale -- store clerk. Bullet through the chest. The register's empty.
Sara: Officer Spencer, did you touch anything?
Officer Spencer: Fourteen years as a state trooper. I know how to secure a crime scene without contaminating the evidence.
Sara: Sorry.
Officer Spencer: It's okay. Look, I cover 97.5 square miles. I got to book.

CUT TO:



Sara: Vomit?

Catherine: Not an expectorate. Potato. Blown to smithereens.

Sara: A poor man's silencer.

Catherine: Now, why would an assailant need silencer way out here?

Sara: Last paying customer -- eight hours ago.
Catherine: We just got the call. The place is open 24 seven. Why'd it take so long?

Sara:  The assailant flipped the sign on the way out, buying him time to get away.


Catherine: But now without getting his picture taken first.

Sara: It's plastic.
Catherine: You're joking.
Sara: Nine volt attached to a blinking light.
Catherine: Real or fake, it didn't work.
CUT TO:



Fraternity Guy: There was three of them.  They come from around the corner, guns drawn ... 

Cocktail Waitress: I think they came from over there.  There were two of them.

Elderly Woman: I said four. 
Brass: Right.
Elderly Woman: There were four of those lunatics. They were everywhere.
Brass: Right.
Elderly Woman:  Write it down.
Brass: I got it. Thank you very much. Excuse me.

Brass:  I've interviewed 17 people. No two accounts are alike.

Grissom: A Harvard Professor conducted an experiment. Asked a bunch of students to watch a basketball game -- count the number of times the ball was passed. 
Brass: Yeah, groundbreaking.
Grissom: During the game a person dressed in a gorilla suit ran across the court. Afterwards, the professor asked his students if they noticed the gorilla. Fifty percent responded, &quot;What gorilla?&quot;
Brass: That's wonderful, Gil. If I see a gorilla, I'll arrest it.
CUT TO:


Valet: The car was sitting right here.
Nick: Did you get a good look at it? Make, model?
Valet: No. It was beige, beat up. Hazards flashing. People leave their cars here all the time. I wait ten minutes then call for a tow.
Nick: Car peel out?
Valet: No. The driver gunned it but I didn't hear a screech.

Nick: Smells like burnt wood.
Valet: Motor oil? 
Nick: No. No, transmission fluid. But it's brown, not red.
Valet: Which means?
Nick:  It's not the right color.
CUT TO:



Grissom: Extraction is an art, Albert.
Robbins: I like to think so. So this is our cross-dresser in thee ? I.D.'d as Adam Brower, shot in the back with a hollow point -- close range. Mushroomed upon impact maximizing trauma.

Grissom: Caliber?
Robbins: Forty-five. 

Grissom: The guards were armed with nine millimeters and they weren't hollow point. So ... he was shot in the back by one of his own partners?
Robbins: Someone didn't want to share.

CUT TO:



Sara: Wow. A fumette. Did you get that out of some museum?
Catherine: Hey, don't knock it. It's still the best tool for lifting prints off cardboard.

Catherine:  Blow and print.

Sara: If you were in a hurry how would you get back there?
Catherine: Easy. Jump the counter.
Sara: Exactly what I'm thinking.


Sara: Shoe prints.
Catherine: Lay it out.
Sara: Suspect entered ... 

Sara:  ... shoots the clerk through the potato... then hops up and over, leaving behind shoe prints ... grabs the cash ... flips the sign from
&quot;open&quot; to &quot;closed&quot; and exits.

Catherine: How old is the killer?
Sara:  What are you thinking? 
Catherine: Shoe size is five, six tops. 
Sara: We may be looking for a minor.
CUT TO:



Grissom: You want to see me?
Warrick: Yeah.
Grissom: This is the video surveillance from that heist. This camera was trained on their entrance.

Grissom: All the disguises in the world and they dress like women.
Warrick: Ski masks are played out. Red and blue teamed up together and took out the guards and their rolling cage.

Warrick: Black shot down that chandelier.
Grissom: Well, Blue's the decedent I.D.'d as Adam Brower ... so enlarge red.

Warrick: No amount of makeup in the world could cover up that chunk of adam's apple. 
Grissom: That must be the one that killed Brower. .45 in the back at close range. 

Warrick: No honor among thieves.
Grissom: Photoshop black.

Warrick: No stubble ... no adam's apple.
Grissom: Dressed as a woman among men dressed as women. Now, see? That's a disguise.
HARD CUT TO BLACK.


FADE IN.



Catherine: Fluorescent powders?
Sara: Eh, why not? They're in the kit.
Catherine: Protocol's black.
Sara: Since when do you care about my choice of powders?

Catherine: Assistant coroners is four hours late and we are stuck out here until he transports the body. And I haven't heard from Grissom ...
Sara:  You know, I've never tried green ...
Catherine: I should've never been sent to this remote scene in the first place. I've got seniority. I deserve -- no, I've earned the right to pick my cases.

Catherine:  If I start eating, I will shut up.

Sara: Do you have a mirror?
Catherine: Since when do you care about your appearance?

Sara: Crime scene?? It's not for me.
Catherine: Sorry. 

Catherine: We can't touch it.
Sara: I'm just getting a better look.

Catherine: Oh, thank god. It's about time.
David Phillips: Nice to see you, Catherine. Well, I smell the body. Where is he?

Sara: Hey, David. I wasn't touching him.
David Phillips:  I know you better than that.
Catherine: So, uh, what took you so long?
David Phillips:  I made a wrong turn back at the fork.
CUT TO:



Nick: You're a surfer now?
Greg: Dude, I rip.
Nick: We're 300 miles from the nearest beach.
Greg: Surfing's just a state of mind. 
Nick: I got your page. Where's my report?
Greg: Oh, relax, bro. The gc mass spec's working on it. Should be done, um ... 

Greg: ... now.

Greg: Transmission fluid.

Nick: Yeah, thanks.  Type &quot;f&quot; with dexron.
Greg: So?

Nick: So ... you should be reading Car &amp; Driver instead of Sand and Surf. Someone put the wrong type of fluid transmission. See, Ford automobiles use a thick red Type-F transmission fluid. General Motors uses a thinner, yellow fluid with dexron. Now, when dexron's put into a ford it thins that Type-F fluid. Friction builds, gears grind. 

Nick:  The second gear is usually the first to go. Friction causes the engine to overheat, in turn cooking the transmission fluid turning it brown. 

Nick: Leak on the pavement is the first clue you've got a problem. 
Greg: Congratulations--you're looking for a Ford with a leak.
Nick: Not just Ford. The getaway vehicle has a stubborn second gear.
Greg: Which means it can't get very far.
Nick: My guess is it's already been dumped.
CUT TO:



Brass: Before Mr. Brower dressed up as a woman and heisted a casino, he was a janitor at an office park off Flamingo. Before that, he was &quot;out of town.&quot;
Fours years for grand larceny.

Warrick: Well, the manager's not in?
Brass: I got a warrant.
Warrick: I got a key.

CUT TO:



Brass: Whoo, tidy little camper, isn't he?
Warrick: Yeah.

Brass: What are we looking for?
Warrick: Anything that links Brower to his co-conspirators.

Brass: Dirty laundry?
Warrick: I'm thinking trace elements in the clothes could tell us where he was before the heist. I'm going to take it all back to the lab.
Brass: Okay. Let's see ...

Brass: Well, while you're at it don't forget his wigs and bras.
CUT TO:



CUT TO:



Catherine: Anything on the shoe print?
Sara: Skechers. Adult size five. Female.
Catherine: Well, at least, we're not chasing a kid.
Sara: How's the prints coming?
Technician: You two lifted 82 suspect prints. 43 are partial.
Catherine: We ID'd on from the &quot;open/closed&quot; sign.
Sara: Great.
Catherine: No. Not so great. State trooper.
Sara: You got to be kidding me. &quot;Officer Moron&quot; contaminated the scene.
Catherine: Yep. Well, I'll just beef him to his captain.
Technician: Tough. I like that.

Technician: Match. Print off the register.
Sara: What have you got?
Catherine:  Tammy Felton.
Sara: Who's Tammy Felton?
Catherine: A fugitive and clinical psychopath that Grissom and I put behind bars. She tried to play but I didn't bite. 

Catherine: Her biological parents posted bail and then she bailed on them.
Sara: Biological parents?
Catherine: Tammy was kidnapped as a child. Raised by her kidnapper. When she found out the truth, she killed him. Hey, finish running the prints.

Catherine: Tammy uses people. She wasn't alone.
CUT TO:


Catherine:  Grissom!

Grissom: If you're going to badger me about your crime scene location, put it in a memo.
Catherine: You don't read memos. Do you remember Tammy Felton?
Grissom: I always remember the ones that get away.
Catherine: She's back.

Catherine: She's been to Calnevari. She's a prime suspect in our convenience store homicide.

Greg: Grissom ...  I need you, ASAP. Please.

CUT TO:



Greg: So, ballistics sent me a bullet from the casino. It's a .45 so we know it came from one of the &quot;ladies'&quot; guns.
Grissom: And this is a special bullet?
Greg: No, but there was a foreign substance adhered to it.
Grissom: And the substance is special?
Greg: Not exactly.
Catherine: Just get to the point, Greg.
Greg: Tomato, to-mah-to, potato...
Catherine: Wait a second. There was potato on the bullet?

Greg: You bet. Strange, huh?
Catherine: There was potato on the bullet because there was potato inside the barrel of the gun.
Grissom: This bullet is from my investigation.
Catherine: Right. One of your armed robbers may have used a potato as a silencer prior to the heist.

Grissom: Tammy Felton?
Catherine:  Maybe.
Grissom: Three armed robbers. Adam Brower-- killed at the scene Tammy Felton ... we're still one suspect short.

Sara: Cath, got another match from the convenience store. The print on the outside doorknob belongs to an ex-con, Darin Hanson.

Sara: You know this guy, too?
Catherine: He ran with Tammy's father, mostly from the law. 
Grissom: So Tammy kills dad ... and she and Darin Hanson run off together. 

Catherine: A regular Bonnie and Clyde. Just what Vegas needs.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN.



Grissom: Let me see, Bobby.
Bobby Dawson: Yeah.

Bobby Dawson: Projectile on the left, .45 hollow point courtesy of Adam Brower's back. On the right ... 

Bobby Dawson: ... a .45 hollow point extracted from Dustin Bale -- dead clerk at the convenience store. 
Grissom: Bullets confirm the story told by the potato.
Catherine: Same gun. Two crimes. One case.
Grissom: Three suspects. Adam Brower, deceased. Tammy Felton, Darin Hanson, still at large.

Nick: Hey, guys. I just got a call from Brass. We got a possible getaway vehicle off I-93.
Catherine: What makes you think it's the right car?
Nick: It's beige abandoned, '77 mercury cougar. Mercury's a division of Ford. I'll drive.
CUT TO:



Brass: A trucker called it in.
Grissom: Well, if that's the getaway car there would have been a secondary vehicle parked nearby.
Nick: Yeah. Check for treads, Jim?
Brass: Yeah.

Grissom:  Shall we?
Catherine:  Let's go.


Nick: If you were stashing a car, where would you hide it?
Brass: All these bushes would provide good cover.
Nick: Oh ... check out that dirt displacement.
Brass: Yeah. Skid mark; one tire.
Brass: Where's the other one?
Nick:  There isn't one.

Nick: Dirt to pavement, then the trail goes cold.

Grissom: No damage. This car was barely moving. 
Catherine: It was dumped.

Catherine: Detail ... pop the trunk.

Catherine: Thanks.

Catherine: It's Tammy.
CUT TO:



Robbins: Contusions on the anterior neck. Streaking erythema on the lateral aspect of zone one. Cartilaginous tracheal rings are crushed.

Catherine: Hey, Doc.
Robbins: Catherine.
Catherine: She didn't put up a fight, did she?
Robbins: How'd you know?
Catherine: She was killed by the one person in life she trusted.

Catherine: Darin Hanson stared her in the face and she never saw it coming.
Robbins: Put his thumbs around her air pipe and pushed.

Robbins: I swabbed her neck. Affirmative for epithelials.

Catherine: I'll run them against Darin Hanson's DNA.
Robbins: Parents called. They're on their way in to I.D.
Catherine: How did they sound?
Robbins: Oddly, relieved.
Catherine: They finally know where she is.

CUT TO:



Nick: I'm not pulling it.
Warrick: I found similar dust on Adam Brower's dirty clothes. Check it out.

CUT TO:



Greg: Real-life fairy dust. 
Nick: Yeah, it turns grown men into criminals.
Warrick: What's the composition?
Greg: S-I ... O-2. Silica dust. Each particle's a hundred times smaller than a grain of sand.

Grissom: I thought you guys were processing the car?
Warrick: Yeah, um... what do you know about silica?
Grissom: It's used to make glass. It's mined in open pits. Why?
Nick: Silica found both on Adam Brower's clothing and the getaway vehicle.
Grissom: There's an abandoned silica mine outside calnevari.
Greg:  What don't you know?
CUT TO:



Grissom: Come here.

Nick: Motorcycle tracks at the vehicle dump site.

Nick: Yeah, that smells nice.
Warrick: Shouldn't smell at all, if this place is abandoned.

Grissom: Get your guns out.

Grissom: Say hello to Darin Hanson. 

Warrick: Shot with a .45. Execution style.
Nick: Adam, Tammy ... now Darin... all dead.
Grissom: And ... we're out of suspects.
FADE OUT.


FADE IN.



Grissom: Three armed robbers hold up the casino. Tammy's in black, Adam was the one in blue and that leaves us Darin.
Catherine: We found Darin and Tammy's prints at the convenience store. Hours before the heist, gets murdered.

Nick: Shot with the same gun used to kill Adam at the casino.
Grissom: The surveillance video tells us that Darin was the only one in position to shoot Adam.

Nick: Why did Darin kill Adam? 
Sara: Greed. Fewer slices. Bigger pieces. 
Catherine: Which explains why he killed Tammy.

Nick: That's confirmed?
Catherine: Epithelials on her neck are a match to Darin's DNA.
Nick: So, Darin thought he was getting the whole score.
Sara: But now he's dead. So, who killed him, and where's the money?
Grissom: And we still don't know why Darin and Tammy took out the convenience store clerk.
Catherine: Why kill a man for a few hundred bucks when you're about to steal a hundred thousand?
Sara: We've got more questions than answers.

Warrick: I just got off the phone with the Laughlin CSI assigned to last month's cottage casino case. He told me the casino's cameras captured four assailants, not three.
Nick: Maybe Tower Club surveillance missed something.
Warrick: Actually, it didn't. We did.
CUT TO:



Warrick: Tower casino surveillance. The screen on your left the camera's trained over where Tammy, Darin and Adam entered. The screen on your right is trained on the gaming tables. Okay, check it out.

Sara: What are we looking for?
Warrick: What, you missed him? All right. I'll play it again ... slower, just for you.  Now, keep your eye trained on the pit boss and the chandelier.

Sara: He ducked before the chandelier fell.
Nick: Yeah, before Tammy drew her gun.
Catherine: Play it again.

Grissom: Well done, Warrick. You found our mole.
Warrick: Yeah. Pit boss' name is Max Duncan. Started working there about three weeks ago. Before that ... 
Catherine: Let me guess. Laughlin, cottage casino?
Grissom: Yeah. I'll call Brass. He can make the arrest.
Catherine: I'll meet him at the station. Call you with an update.

CUT TO:




Brass: Max Duncan?
Max Duncan: Yeah. What the hell is going on here?
Catherine: You going somewhere?
Max Duncan: What's it to you?
Brass: I'll tell you how this works: I'll ask the questions; you give the answers downtown.
Max Duncan: I'm calling my lawyer.

Catherine: Good idea.
CUT TO:



Brass: Max ... are you clairvoyant?
Max Duncan: Excuse me?
Catherine: Surveillance tape from the Tower Club Casino. You ducked before there was a reason to cover.
Max Duncan: I saw a gun; I hit the ground.
Brass: Okay, let's try this. Why were you leaving town? Trying to beat a murder rap?
Max Duncan: No. I didn't kill anyone.
Catherine: You forget about Darin Hanson? Your car was covered with gray dust-
- silica. It places you at the murder scene.
Max Duncan: Well, I didn't kill him.
Lawyer:  Max ...
Max Duncan: I went there, but ...
Lawyer: I'm advising you not to say another word.
Max Duncan: No, I want to clear this up. All right, I went out to the mine, but I didn't kill Darin. He was already dead. All right, look, I ... I'll admit I helped him out. I ... I told him when and where to hit. That's why I ducked. But that's it.
Brass: That's a lot.
Catherine: And it still doesn't explain why you went to see Darin.
Lawyer: Max, that is enough.
Max Duncan: Well, I went to collect my share, but the money was gone. Darin was dead, and I panicked, but I didn't shoot him. You can't get me for murder on this.
Brass: When someone is killed during the commission of a felony all the conspirators are liable.
Catherine: Darin Hanson shot Adam Brower but you might as well have pulled the trigger.
Lawyer:  Let's make a deal.
Brass: Tell me, who else was involved? Who killed Darin?
Max Duncan: Look, Darin was the only one that I spoke to. I never even met the other three.
Brass: Then we got no deal. Officer.

Brass: You know what? I kind of believe him.
Catherine: Yeah, me, too. He confirmed a fourth. Darin plus three. Just like Laughlin.
Brass: So, the last man standing killed Darin.
Catherine: And he's still out there ... flush with cash and a .45 caliber.
CUT TO:



Archie Johnson: Surveillance stills from the laughlin heist. Four perps; we've identified three: Darin, Tammy and Adam. All deceased.
Grissom: Yeah. All murdered.
Archie Johnson: That leaves one.
Sara: I.D. the &quot;unknown&quot;, good chance we solve both cases: Laughlin and Vegas.
Grissom: Except all we got is a gun in drag.
Archie Johnson:  Well, that's why I'm here.

Archie Johnson: I've divided the photo into segments removed the disguise and rebuilt the original image based on male physiological norms. Now, it's not exact but you'll have an idea of what your guy looks like.

Sara: That's Dustin Bale. 
Grissom: The clerk from the convenience store.
Sara: Whoa. Hold on. He was killed hours before the tower club heist. In on Laughlin, out on Vegas. So, Darin took him out first. They cleared the register just to make it look like a robbery.
Grissom: But the pit boss said it was Darin plus three.
Sara: Because he knew there were four at the Laughlin heist.
Grissom: Well, maybe he didn't know that the clerk wasn't there. He wasn't counting wigs. He was hiding under a blackjack table.
Sara: And we're back to who killed Darin Hanson.
CUT TO:



Catherine: Bobby D.
Bobby Dawson: Yeah?
Catherine: We need your help.
Bobby Dawson: Another round from the casino heist?
Nick: Indirectly, yeah.

Bobby Dawson: Well, tip didn't blossom. Not a hollow point, so it's not from Darin Hanson's gun.
Nick: No, it's from his head.

Bobby Dawson: All right, 230 grains gives us a .45 automatic.
Catherine: What else?
Bobby Dawson: Okay, normally, lands and grooves are highly delineated.  These are smooth, polished, which means that your projectile was fired from a polygonal barrel. Be right back.

Bobby Dawson: These are the only types of .45 automatics with polygonal barrels. So, the gun that fired your bullet was either a Heckler &amp; Koch USP or a Glock.

Catherine: Narrow it further.
Bobby Dawson:  Well, that's what I'm doing: Dissecting your bullet.
Bobby Dawson: Hey, Nick.
Nick: Mm-hmm.

Bobby Dawson: Count the stripes.
Nick: One, two, three, four, five, six.
Bobby Dawson: Six lands angroves with a right-hand twist.
Nick: Mm-hmm.
Bobby Dawson: Glock's got eight; Heckler and Koch-- six. You got your gun.
Nick: Let's run ATF.
Bobby Dawson: Pretty unique weapon. Expensive. Not exactly what you'd buy out of the back of a van.

Bobby Dawson: Only take a second.

Bobby Dawson:  See? Can I call it? Only 18 registered in-state. Ten in Clark County; seven of them still in circulation.

Nick: Any names jumping off the page?
Catherine: Just one. It's out of left field. About 75 miles out.

CUT TO:




Officer Spencer: You're accusing me of murder?
Brass: And absconding with a quarter of mill stolen money.
Catherine: Where did you stash the cash?
Officer Spencer: I'm a state trooper.
Brass: How does a cop hook up with an ex-con like Darin?
Catherine: I can answer that. It's all in a day's work.

Catherine: A potato silencer muffles a bullet but won't silence it. You went in your gun drawn.

Darin Hanson: Take it easy, pal.

Catherine: You should have arrested them. But something happened, didn't it? My bet, Tammy made you an offer.

Officer Spencer: Drop the weapon.
Tammy Felton: Hey, uh, let's be smart about this. You can take us in or we can cut you in.

Catherine: They still had pockets full of cash from the Laughlin job. They offered you a finder's fee.

Officer Spencer: This isn't going to do it.
Darin Hanson: It'll hold you over ... till tomorrow.
Tammy Felton: Deal?



Officer Spencer: What are you doing?
Catherine: You patrol on 97.5 square miles. Is the calnevari mine a part of your jurisdiction?
Officer Spencer: No. I'm east of the mine.
Grissom: But you've been there haven't you?

Brass: Where is the cash?

Grissom: Jim, hit the overhead, will you?

Grissom: Silica is a crystal. It reflects the light. Even trace amounts will show up.  Huh. How about that?



Officer Spencer: More than I'd make in a lifetime.
Grissom: Was it worth it?
Officer Spencer: You wouldn't understand.
Catherine: That's right. We make the big bucks.
Officer Spencer: Look -- I was never &quot;that&quot; guy. You know, that guy that wins the jackpots gets promoted, catches the breaks? It was right there.
Brass: Yeah, well, you're still not that guy. Get him out of here.

Catherine: $250,000 turned a career cop bad.
Grissom: Yeah, well, he had his price.
Catherine: We all do.

FADE TO BLACK.

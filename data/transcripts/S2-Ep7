[INT. SUV - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(A speeding SUV peals around the corner.)</p>
<p>(Cut to a train running on the tracks.)</p>
<p>(Cut to the SUV speeding down the road. MEGAN TREADWELL, the driver of the SUV, looks to the side and notices the train. She hears the train whistle blow. Still, she steps on the gas, hoping to beat the train across the track.)</p>
<p><strong>Megan Treadwell</strong>: (urgently) Come on, come on, come on, come on. Come on, come on!</p>
<p>(The train crossing bell ring a warning. The train is approaching.)</p>
<p>(The SUV brakes screech. The train approaches. MEGAN TREADWELL steps of the breaks again, the car tires screech and still her car moves forward. Her car moves forward slowly, slowly through the crossing guard rail.)</p>
<p>(The SUV stops on the tracks. The train approaches. MEGAN TREADWELL looks out the car window and screams as the train smashes into her car.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Scene opens with a close up of a power saw cutting through the SUV door.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE approaches the scene carrying her CSI kit. BRASS turns around when CATHERINE reaches him and starts filling her in on the case.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Paramedics pronounced twenty minutes ago. Megan Treadwell. I ran her plates. Thirty-three tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: One-on-one with a train. Did she think that she could beat it?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks at BRASS, then heads toward GRISSOM, who is checking the train out. She puts her kit down.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM is busy looking at something on the front of the train. CATHERINE leans in for a better look.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Door handle.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Point of impact: Passenger-side door.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Dead center.</p>
<p>(They look on the side as Forensics carry the bagged body away on a gurney.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Question is: Why did the SUV cross the tracks?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (deadpans) To get to the other side.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at CATHERINE.)</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO BLACK. END OF TEASER. ROLL TITLE CREDITS.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<hr />
[EXT. TRAIN TRACKS -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks down the steps of TRAIN #4009. When she gets to the ground, GRISSOM is on his cell phone. He hangs up.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sheriff says we're holding up trains all over the country. This entire railroad division depends on keeping the main line open.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, it's not like we can take this back to the garage.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, unfortunately, his priority is clearing this train from the tracks. You have two hours.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns to leave. CATHERINE calls out to him.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Suspicious circs in town. This one's all yours.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Thanks, but you got to give me some guys.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sara's all you get.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: All I need.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. WESTERN STATE HISTORICAL SOCIETY (LIBRARY) -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM enters the library. He's met up by DET. RAY O'RILEY, who fills him in on the scene. In the background, the alarm continues to ring.)</p>
<p><strong>O'Riley</strong>: &quot;Burglary in progress&quot; call. Once we made entry, we found the victim downstairs. Never knew this place existed.</p>
<p>(O'RILEY and GRISSOM continue down the stairs to the lower level.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The Western States Historical Society. It's not on a lot of tourist maps.</p>
<p>(The alarm stops ringing.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. Ray O'Riley</strong>: I had them cut the wires.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We need to identify the source of the alarm, Ray. Security company said it was downstairs. The body's there, too.</p>
<p>(DET. O'RILEY opens the door and walks in. GRISSOM follows.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. WESTERN STATE HISTORICAL SOCIETY (LIBRARY) - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(O'RILEY and GRISSOM enter the lower room.)</p>
<p><strong>O'Riley</strong>: (looking up at the ceiling) Trying to get them to turn some more lights on in here.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: There are no more lights, O'Riley. It's a controlled environment. Notice how you're not sweating? It's probably sixty-six degrees in here. Thirty-five percent relative humidity. Too much light, too much heat degrades the books.</p>
<p>(In front of them, two firemen cut try to cut the lock on the cage.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What-- nobody's got a key?</p>
<p><strong>O'Riley</strong>: The curator's across town. He's on his way. She looks dead to me.</p>
<p>(The firemen put the cutters away and one gets out a power saw. He starts cutting the lock.)</p>
<p>(The door is unlocked. The fireman opens the door and GRISSOM steps aside for the paramedics.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You got first touch.</p>
<p>(The two paramedics enter the cage. They put their cases down and work on the woman on the floor. GRISSOM also walks inside after them and kneels in close to look at the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Medic</strong>: 10:48. MEDIC: Red foam, blue tint.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Foam could be from blood in her lungs. Edema. Skin is cyanotic. Maybe a blood disease. Leukemia. Meningitis. We'll know after the post.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM stands and gets out his camera. He starts to take pictures of the body. The camera flashes several times. Behind GRISSOM, outside the cage, a young man protests.)</p>
<p><strong>Aaron Pratt</strong>: Don't do that.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (turns around) Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron Pratt</strong>: These are very rare books.</p>
<p><strong>Det. Ray O'Riley</strong>: Aaron Pratt. Librarian. Only other person here when the alarm sounded.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did he tell you what he was doing here?</p>
<p><strong>O'Riley</strong>: Oh, yeah. Watching her. Set off the alarm, trying to get in the cage.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. WESTERN STATE HISTORICAL SOCIETY (LIBRARY) -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM questions the Librarian, AARON PRATT.)</p>
<p><strong>Aaron Pratt</strong>: I wasn't watching her. I always say &quot;good night&quot; to Veronica because I have to leave at 8:03 to catch the 8:10 bus. It's three blocks away. And sometimes the bus comes at 8:08, so I have to rush to catch it.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So you went down to the basement to say good night.</p>
<p><strong>Aaron Pratt</strong>: &quot;Good night, Veronica.&quot; &quot;Good night, Aaron.&quot; Sometimes she ... w-walks me to the bus.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did she walk you to the bus tonight?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron Pratt</strong>: &quot;Are you coming?&quot; &quot;No. You go ahead without me. I have more work to do.&quot;</p>
<p>(AARON gets very serious as he remembers what happens next.)</p>
<p><strong>Aaron Pratt</strong>: Then ... a uniball pen ...</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to a camera close up of VERONICA BRADLEY'S hand holding the pen and the pen slipping out from her fingers. This happens in slow motion. The pen falls. The pen rolls across the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Aaron Pratt</strong>: (V.O.) rolled across the desk ... fell onto the chair ... </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Aaron Pratt</strong>: ... hit the floor ...</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to the pen still rolling in slow motion.) </p>
<p><strong>Aaron Pratt</strong>: (V.O.) and stopped rolling at the wastebasket.</p>
<p>(The pen stops rolling. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Aaron Pratt</strong>: Then water ... water falls into her eyes.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You mean she was sweating?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron Pratt</strong>: From her forehead.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to a veil of water falling from VERONICA'S forehead past her eyes.)</p>
<p><strong>Aaron Pratt</strong>: (V.O.) Lots ...</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Aaron Pratt</strong>: ... and then, she grabs her stomach ... with both hands.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to VERONICA BRADLEY dropping the book and clutching her abdomen.)</p>
<p><strong>Veronica Bradley</strong>: Aaron ...</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Aaron Pratt</strong>: ... &quot;Aaron&quot; ... Then she put on her new face. Shelley's Frankenstein. Up and d-down ... flopping around like ...</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to VERONICA BRADLEY falling to the floor in seizures.) </p>
<p><strong>Aaron Pratt</strong>: (V.O.) ... a salmon on my uncle's fishing boat.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: She was convulsing.</p>
<p><strong>Aaron Pratt</strong>: I ... couldn't help her ... because the cage is locked and I don't have a key.</p>
<p>(NICK approaches the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, there. Warrick's got three residential burglaries, so ... </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mr. Pratt, will you excuse me for a moment?</p>
<p>(NICK and GRISSOM walk to the back of the room..)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: According to O'Riley this guy's body language says he's guilty.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I think he's autistic.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Autistic? You mean like Rain Man?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Rain Man was a savant. Extremely rare. Aaron Pratt is a high-functioning autistic man with superior right-brain ability.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Kind of sounds like you.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The crime scene's in the basement.</p>
<p>(NICK leaves to go to the basement.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>

[EXT. ROADWAY BY CRASH SITE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and SARA walk side-by-side with their eyes glued to the road trying to look for evidence.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Man, I hate rushing through a crime scene. Two years from now, no one is going to care that the Sheriff turned this into a &quot;scoop and run.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Call was made above our heads. Just document the time in your notes.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah, well, I'll let you testify on this one.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>(Off to the side of the road, a little dog comes running toward them. Both CATHERINE and SARA kneel to get the dog.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Aw ...</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey, little guy. Hey. Hey. Let's see.</p>
<p>(SARA checks his collar.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: His name is Maverick. He lives on Martingale Street in Henderson.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: That's not that far from here.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Guess I'll go call animal control.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'll be right back.</p>
<p>(SARA picks up the dog.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey. Come on, boy. Let's get you home.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. ROADWAY BY CRASH SITE - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(BRASS questions the TRAIN ENGINEER.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So let me get this straight, all you saw was a car trying to beat the signal?</p>
<p><strong>Train Engineer</strong>: I'm putting 55 miles an hour. It's dark. I got an oil leak, can't figure out where. I looked up and I saw something.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The SUV.</p>
<p><strong>Train Engineer</strong>: Like I said, it was dark. I thought it was stopping. I turned my head for one second. Next thing I know, it's in the middle of the tracks. With all due respect we've got the right of way out here.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Thanks for your time.</p>
<p>(BRASS nods. The TRAIN ENGINEER leaves. SARA walks up to BRASS carrying MAVERICK in her arms.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: That's not yours, is it?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I am collecting evidence. Do we have an address on the vic yet?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: 855 Martingale.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Vic had a passenger. Say hello to Maverick.</p>

<p>(GRISSOM walks into the room. ROBBINS is washing his hands. He turns off the faucet.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Have you finished with our lady of the library?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: As finished as I'm going to be. You were right. Cyanosis. Blood was unable to oxygenate her tissue.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV as the camera travels to the deceased's face. The deceased's head rises and eyes open. The camera continues down her mouth as it opens slightly. It travels down her wind pipe where the muscles closes the passage. End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Explains the blue face. Underlying cause?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: With blood in her lungs, asphyxiation's out. I found vomit in her throat, bloody stool, hemolysis and some irritation of the mucous membrane on her tongue. I won't know more till I get the blood test back. Could be blood-borne disease.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm thinking about homicide.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Then you know more than I do.</p>
<p>(ROBBINS looks at GRISSOM who's looking at the body. GRISSOM looks up at ROBBINS.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>

[INT. WESTERN STATE HISTORICAL SOCIETY (LIBRARY) - THE CAGE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(NICK is in the cage dusting for prints on the books. In the background, a well-dressed man descends the stairs.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Excuse me, sir.</p>
<p><strong>Stanley Hunter</strong>: It's fine.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Sir, you can't come in here.</p>
<p><strong>Stanley Hunter</strong>: I told the officer upstairs. I'm Stanley Hunter.</p>
<p>(At NICK'S blank look, he continues.)</p>
<p><strong>Stanley Hunter</strong>: The curator. Do you have any idea the damage you're causing? With your dust, flashbulbs. You see that?</p>
<p>(STANLEY HUNTER points to a book behind NICK. He walks forward toward it to emphasize it's importance.)</p>
<p><strong>Stanley Hunter</strong>: Right there, behind you. That is a 17th century text by Johannes Van Den Avelen. It's one of two volumes in the world. Now, do you go to the Louvre and put your hands all over the Raft of the Medusa?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Officer, Mr. Hunter would like to give a statement to Detective O'Riley.</p>
<p><strong>Stanley Hunter</strong>: Statement?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p>(Behind them, DET. O'RILEY and GRISSOM enter the room and stand just outside the cage as STANLEY HUNTER continues to talk to NICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Stanley Hunter</strong>: I just got here. I don't even know what happened. But what I do know is that these are masterpieces. One of a kind.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: They're evidence in an active criminal investigation -- also one of a kind.</p>
<p><strong>Det. O'Riley</strong>: Mr. Hunter, why don't we go upstairs and talk?</p>
<p>(STANLEY HUNTER leaves with DET. O'RILEY. GRISSOM puts his gloves on and looks around the room.)</p>
<p>(From a round POV, he views the table to the chair to the floor and he sees the pen near the wastebasket. GRISSOM walks over to it and picks it up. He looks at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The good news, Nick? We had a camera in here.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: There's no surveillance system.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, there is -- Aaron Pratt. We just have to figure out how to get the film out of his head.</p>

<p>(The tow truck takes the damaged SUV away. CATHERINE and SARA continue to take photographs of the crime scene.)</p>
<p>(Between evidence markers #16 and #17, there's a piece of glass. CATHERINE picks it up and looks at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Filament.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Train probably busted out her headlights. First thing on our list when we get to the tow yard.</p>
<p>(SARA looks at the treadmarks on the road. Something puzzles her about it.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Catherine ... check this out.</p>
<p>(SARA snaps a photo of it.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Two sets of skid marks.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: One set going forward ...</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to the SUV stopping and skidding to a stop. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: These skid marks are about seven feet shy of the gate.</p>
<p>(SARA walks over to the next set of skid marks between evidence markers #18 and<br />
#19.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The second set of skid marks are darker more rubber residue.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Could be an overlay.</p>
<p>(SARA snaps several photos.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Looks like the tires were spinning in place.</p>

<p>(GRISSOM is questioning STANLEY HUNTER inside the cage.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So, all of your chemicals in here are alkaline?</p>
<p><strong>Stanley Hunter</strong>: We're not dealing with the far ends of the ph range. See, old book pages are slightly acidic. The acid eats away the paper. We neutralize them by a solution that's slightly basic.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: To reach &quot;7,&quot; the neutral ph.</p>
<p><strong>Stanley Hunter</strong>: Exactly. Imidazole. Fifteen percent ammonia. That's the sort of thing we work with here. It's all about preserving the books. No, not that you could even assign a value but do you have any idea how much each of these books is worth?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Stanley Hunter</strong>: The first printed book was a Gutenberg Bible. It sold at Christie's for $5.3 million. Lewis and Clark's elk skin journal sold for<br />

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: All of that and you never thought about beefing up your security?</p>
<p><strong>Stanley Hunter</strong>: You know, special collections are kept in the vault. Any rare book removed from the vault gets scanned through a coder. If the book is to be read it's delivered to a secure room upstairs. And if Veronica was going to work on it, it stayed down here.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Is this one of the books that Veronica was restoring?</p>
<p><strong>Stanley Hunter</strong>: Yes. It ... it was published in 1797. The author was a British Botanist. It's worth an estimated $300,000. It's really not a dangerous profession.</p>

<p>(AARON stands up and walks over to the window.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Was Mr. Hunter having lunch with Veronica again?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron Pratt</strong>: Hard-boiled egg, celery, fruit salad, iced tea. Veronica was on a diet. She had to lose three pounds.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Was this lunch different from the other lunches you told me about?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron Pratt</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron Pratt</strong>: They fought.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Aaron, I want you to be very specific. Tell me what you saw.</p>
<p>(AARON looks out the window and remembers.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to STANLEY HUNTER'S office and his lunch with VERONICA BRADLEY. They're arguing.)</p>
<p><strong>Stanley Hunter</strong>: You did what?</p>
<p>(He hits her.)</p>
<p><strong>Stanley Hunter</strong>: All I have is my reputation and I'm not going to let you ruin it for me!</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Aaron Pratt</strong>: Veronica started crying. Mr. Hunter stopped yelling. He sat down. He started eating. He cut the hard-boiled egg in half.</p>
<p>(VERONICA is crying.)</p>
<p><strong>Aaron Pratt</strong>: (V.O.) He reached in the drawer and pulled out the salt shaker.</p>
<p>(VERONICA BRADLEY stops him from adding salt to the egg. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Aaron Pratt</strong>: No s*x, no food, no salt.</p>

<p>(GRISSOM and O'RILEY question STANLEY HUNTER.)</p>
<p><strong>Stanley Hunter</strong>: Poison? What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We're talking about ricin. The toxin that killed Veronica Bradley. You were dating her. You ate lunch together.</p>
<p><strong>O'Riley</strong>: Opportunity. So, you mix up a batch of ricin put it in a salt shaker. Next time you're breaking bread, she asks for the salt ... </p>
<p><strong>Stanley Hunter</strong>: It never happened.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We have a witness who says he saw you try to kill her.</p>
<p><strong>Stanley Hunter</strong>: What? Aaron? Are you sure you trust him?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Normally an eyewitness is the least reliable evidence we have. But in this case, it's the most reliable. Veronica knew about the forgeries. A career-ender, huh, Stanley?</p>
<p><strong>Stanley Hunter</strong>: For her, not for me. She's the forger.</p>
<p>(This surprises GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Stanley Hunter</strong>: Oh, Aaron, Aaron, Aaron. I suppose he indicted me for that, too? He's the one who came to me. Told me about the illustrations. Said they felt like his bus pass. Whatever that means.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>Stanley Hunter</strong>: He even knew the page numbers. So, I checked it out and he was right. Veronica was using me and mea culpa.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Why didn't you tell us about the forgeries earlier?</p>
<p><strong>Stanley Hunter</strong>: When she died, I thought the problem was solved. In this business, all you have is your reputation. There was a dozen books. I was going to remove them from the collection inform the board, collect the insurance and cut my losses. If you don't believe me go ask your very reliable witness.</p>

<p>(GRISSOM is standing on the inside of the cage. AARON PRATT is on the outside looking in.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Tell me again, what did you see?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron Pratt</strong>: Uniball pen rolls across the desk. Falls on the chair, hits the floor and stops rolling at the wastebasket. Then water falls into Veronica's eyes ...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (interrupting) Aaron, when you look at things you see pictures in your mind. Tell me the first picture you see of Veronica in this cage.</p>
<p><strong>Aaron Pratt</strong>: I already told you.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Tell me something you haven't told me. Tell me what Veronica was doing before you said good night.</p>
<p><strong>Aaron Pratt</strong>: She pulled out a canvas bag. Then she looked around.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Why was she looking around?</p>
<p><strong>Aaron Pratt</strong>: She was deciding something.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Tell me what &quot;Veronica deciding something&quot; looks like.</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Veronica Bradley must have loved uniballs. She had about a dozen at her house. Plus every known piece of forgery equipment.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM puts a swab in its box.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Some people bite their nails; she bit her pens. Bad habit.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM swabs the end of another pen.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I also found this under her refrigerator. Funny how people don't think to clean there.</p>
<p>(NICK holds out an evidence bag for GRISSOM to take. GRISSOM looks at it. Camera close up of a single castor bean.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Castor bean. Ricinus communis.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: set this guy off.</p>
<p>(SARA looks up.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: He spilled his coffee.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks around and finds the coffee lid with lipstick on the cap.)</p>
<p>(SARA walks around to the driver side.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (shaking her head) Not a good color for Croft.</p>
<p>(They're both putting the pieces together. CATHERINE also notices the coffee on the driver-side window. She rolls the window up to show the coffee stain.)</p>

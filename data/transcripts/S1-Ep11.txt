<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I need you to do some background for me on Warrick.</p>

[INT. MARTY'S MARKET - DAY]</p>
<p>(Camera moves low and fast along the main aisle. It turns up into an aisle and stops in front of the wheels of a shopping cart as it moves directly toward the camera.)</p>
<p>WO<strong>Man Over P.A.</strong>: Manager to register two, please. Manager to register two.</p>
<p>(The woman turns the aisle and heads into the fruits and vegetables section. She fills up a bag and continues shopping.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: The woman grabs a bag of buns and puts it into the cart. The camera keeps on the woman as she shops.

<p>[INT. MARTY'S MARKET - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(BRASS turns around to see GRISSOM. They make their way toward the aisle.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, if it isn't the boss himself! Where's your E-street band?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: They had another gig. How you doing, Jim? How's your old job?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Ah, I can sling scum all day long. You?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I curse more.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, yeah? Well, wait. The shopping cart's over here. The missing woman is Margaret Shorey. Lives with her sister. Went out to get groceries; never came home. Car's still in the parking lot.</p>
<p>(The STORE MANAGER walks up to the cart. GRISSOM puts his kit down on the floor. He walks up to the cart and looks inside the purse.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And her purse is still in the cart. With no wallet. </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Maybe she left the purse as a marker.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Chicken soup, ice packs ... pain reliever ...</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Sister broke her wrist in a car wreck.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hot dogs, hot dog buns ...</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Junk-food junkie.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks on the bottom of the cart and sees something yellow stuck to the bottom rail. He uses his finger to get a dollop of it which he smells, then tastes. BRASS watches and grimaces.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, that's sanitary.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mustard.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns around and look at the mustard on the shelf.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to the STORE MANAGER) Did you have any mop-ups in this aisle today?</p>
<p><strong>Store Manager</strong>: Yeah. Yeah, as a matter of fact, we did.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Life holds no surprises. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns around and takes a mustard bottle off of the shelf. He digs into his pocket to pay for it and hands the money to the STORE MANAGER.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: $1.98 for the mustard ... plus, my two cents.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM holds the bottle over the aisle and drops it, shattering it in front of BRASS.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Now, where would you go?</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (groans) Oh, man ...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hey, Brass, look at this.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You see this?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM holds the bathroom stall door open and looks at the inside of the stall door. BRASS gets up; the STORE MANAGER steps closer.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: See what?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This circumference? Looks like somebody did a brillo job on it.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: All I see is a clean door.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You know anything about this?</p>
<p><strong>Store Manager</strong>: Yeah, he's right -- we cleaned it up today. I had a complaint. Kids are always writing crazy stuff on bathroom doors. So I had one of my employees scrub it off.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Could I borrow a hammer?</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - LAB -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The camera snaps. &quot; ... ED 5 WOMEN ... &quot;)</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Dead body-- bonus.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Whoa, somebody likes their job.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Nick Stokes-- 416, fight at the Bellagio. She says she's a &quot;friend&quot; of yours.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Ex-girlfriend, Nick?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, that depends. Was she the assaulter or the assaultee?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You tell us -- you like leather or lace?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (chuckles) No, I'm not even going there. </p>
<p>(He turns and heads out the door ... then it hits him.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Lace.</p>
<p>(SARA looks up and smiles widely at him.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Catherine, you have a 418 -- an obituary on a stall door. I'll meet you in the garage but first, I've got to take care of Warrick.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, no. What are you going to do?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE stands up and gets her things. She passes GRISSOM on her way out.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I don't know.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE leaves. SARA lingers.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I filed my report.</p>

<p>(Steps into the locker room.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How was court the other day?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I handed it off to Michovitch, from days. Uh, I told Sara.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, because you had, uh, &quot;personal business.&quot;</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks a the file in his hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah. </p>
<p>(WARRICK turns around and sees GRISSOM holding the file and the video tape.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What's that?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You ... at the Monaco casino.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What? I don't believe this. Now you're pulling up film on me?</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We do.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Look, what you do on your time is nobody's business. What you do on my time is my business.</p>
<p>(WARRICK sighs and sits down.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I was at the casino. But I wasn't gambling.</p>

[INT. BERLIN RESIDENCE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The OFFICER takes KENNY BERLIN'S statement. In the back, SARA walks in and puts her kit down. The photographer walks in behind her.)</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (to the photographer) Get me a picture of the body ... the items on the bedsheet ... the window ... the drafting table.</p>
<p>(The camera shutter clicks.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Everything on the floor.</p>
<p>(She takes another look around the room, then turns to talk with the DETECTIVE.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Sara Sidle, crime scene investigation. And you are ... ?</p>
<p><strong>Kenny Berlin</strong>: (crying) I'm ... Kenny Berlin. That's my brother. I'm the one who found him.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Sorry for your loss. (SARA turns to look around the room.) You want to tell me what happened here?</p>
<p><strong>Kenny Berlin</strong>: I don't ... I don't know. I came... I came walking in the door, I saw my brother lying there ... stuff everywhere. All I could think was that ...</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Someone breaks the glass window and steps into the room. As the thief tosses the room, JEFF BERLINE walks in and interrupts him.)</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Berlin</strong>: Hey!</p>

<p><strong>Kenny Berlin</strong>: ... and then you guys showed up, and...</p>
<p><strong>Detective</strong>: (to KENNY BERLIN) Thank you. </p>
<p>(He and SARA step aside.)</p>
<p><strong>Detective</strong>: There have been several burglaries in the neighborhood; all benign.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Nothing benign about two $20s screaming, &quot;take me&quot; on the bar.</p>
<p><strong>Detective</strong>: Maybe he missed it?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah, well, it's hard to miss all that high-tech computer equipment. There's got to be five, ten grand there. First thing I'd take.</p>
<p><strong>Detective</strong>: He was interrupted.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Before or after he used a bedsheet to transport the silverware? Pillowcases are the norm, you know that. Something's not right.</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Gentlemen, Nick Stokes. I'm here for the 416; something about a &quot;special request.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Officer Pratt</strong>: Don't ask me. Go ask Catherine Zeta Jones over there.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Over where?</p>
<p>(They point.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>(NICK heads there.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Excuse me ... ma'am?</p>
<p>(The woman with the short hair waits impatiently, her back turned to them. When NICK calls out to her, she turns around. It's KRISTY HOPKINS. NICK recognizes her immediately.)</p>
<p><strong>Kristy Hopkins</strong>: Oh, Nick, hey ...</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You got to be kidding me.</p>
<p><strong>Kristy Hopkins</strong>: Oh, you probably don't recognize me with the shorter hair. My nipples are all better, you want to see?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, yeah, Kristy Hopkins, what are you doing here?</p>
<p><strong>Security Guard</strong>: (interrupting) I'll tell you what she's doing here-- she's cruising.</p>
<p><strong>Kristy Hopkins</strong>: No, I'm in here, minding my own business shopping for a dress spending my hard-earned money! (NICK reacts to that comment; she corrects herself.) Okay, semi-hard-earned money. When Squiggy over here starts harassing me saying he doesn't want my type in here. He grabs my arm, cops a feel then he spit on me, so I slugged him!</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Whoa, whoa, whoa ... he spit on you?</p>
<p><strong>Security Guard</strong>: Wait, you're not listening to this? This is such a crock.</p>
<p><strong>Kristy Hopkins</strong>: Oh, I'll show you ...</p>
<p>(KRISTY and the SECURITY GUARD start yelling at each other.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: All right, all right, break it up! Ease up! Ease up!</p>
<p>(OFFICER PRATT pulls the SECURITY GUARD aside; NICK pulls KRISTY aside.)</p>
<p><strong>Security Guard</strong>: Hey, hey, I'm pressing charges! I don't care who you know!</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Kristy!</p>
<p><strong>Kristy Hopkins</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>Officer Pratt</strong>: They're right -- I've got to take her in.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (to OFFICER PRATT) Just give me a minute, will you? (NICK pulls KRISTY to the side.) Get over here! I need your shirt.</p>
<p>(KRISTY stares at NICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Kristy Hopkins</strong>: Why is it every time we meet you're wanting me to take my clothes off?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Because every time we meet you put yourself in a position where you have to take them off.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. BERLIN RESIDENCE - NIGHT] </p>
<p>(SARA talks with KENNY BERLIN.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Using your arms -- how big's a whale?</p>
<p>(KENNY BERLIN spreads his arms out to show her.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Now freeze, don't move. (She positions his arms straight out.) Up.</p>
<p>(SARA starts examining KENNY'S clothing.)</p>
<p><strong>Kenny Berlin</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Checking for blood spatter.</p>
<p><strong>Kenny Berlin</strong>: (surprised) What blood? Am I a suspect?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: This is what I do. This is how I eliminate you as a suspect.</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: I'll take that for you.</p>
<p>(SARA hands the OFFICER her flashlight. She leans in close and finds something on the cuff of KENNY'S pants.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, that's good news; no blood, bud.</p>
<p>(In the background, a camera flashes. SARA reaches into her kit to take a sample of what she finds in the cuff of his pants. She puts it in a bindle.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I am going to need you to strip, though.</p>
<p><strong>Kenny Berlin</strong>: Right here?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Don't be shy on my account. But if you are, this nice detective will accompany you to the bedroom.</p>
<p>(SARA puts it in her kit and stands up.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Oh, and, uh, I'm going to need to take your window with me, too. </p>
<p>(SARA pulls the warrant from her jacket pocket.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It's all in the warrant.</p>

[INT. CSI - LAB -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(DR. RAMBAR examines the photographs of the writing on the bathroom stall door. He explains his findings to GRISSOM and CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rabar</strong>: The person who wrote this is left-handed.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And we know that because...?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rabar</strong>: The &quot;t-bar&quot; in &quot;catch,&quot; it's left-tending. And uneducated ... the contraction in &quot;IV'E&quot; is misplaced. Then we have the large, arched hood in the letter &quot;Y&quot; and the arches in the bottom of the &quot;L's.&quot; This indicates criminal tendency which is supported by the heavy pastiosity which suggests low impulse control.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Heavy pastiosity?</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Rabar</strong>: The pressure -- how firmly you put pen to paper.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Or marker to metal. Do we know anything else?</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Did you file a police report?</p>
<p><strong>Kenny Berlin</strong>: No, but you can check with my insurance company.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I already checked with my lab. They do this test, and guess what? The glass -- it floated.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You know what that means?</p>
<p><strong>Kenny Berlin</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It means the glass on your pants and the glass from your living room window have equal densities.</p>

[EXT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - PARKING LOT -- DAY]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and CATHERINE drive the SUV back into the parking lot. They pass NICK, who is talking with KRISTY HOPKINS next to her car.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: &quot;Us guys have to stick together, right?&quot; He said, &quot;right. You the man!&quot;</p>
<p>(She laughs.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So, I mean, I could have used an STR-DNA but it's too state-of-the-art; it's overkill. So I used an HLA-DQ A1, with a ... polymarker.</p>
<p>(She nods as if she understand, but NICK realizes that he's lost her.)</p>
<p><strong>Kristy Hopkins</strong>: That's-that's very, very interesting.</p>
<p>(She leans against the open car door and smiles at him.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (smiles) You don't care about this at all, do you?</p>
<p><strong>Kristy Hopkins</strong>: No. (chuckles) ... but to be honest with you, all I really care about is whether the charges against me are going to be dropped. (pauses)<br />
Are they?</p>
<p>(NICK takes a moment and let's her wait for his answer.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: DA threw out the case.</p>
<p><strong>Kristy Hopkins</strong>: Great. (chuckles) (deadpans) So I can shoplift at that boutique again? (NICK reacts to that statement.) (she laughs and grabs his shirt) I was kidding, I was kidding. Besides, they never have any good sales there, anyway. (chuckles) </p>
<p>(They stop laughing. Both standing incredibly close to the other.)</p>
<p><strong>Kristy Hopkins</strong>: I'd invite you out for coffee, it's probably a bad idea, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Kristy Hopkins</strong>: Yeah. But I can call you sometime, you know just in case I ever get into trouble or something.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (smiles) Maybe you should try not getting into trouble. You do owe me one.</p>
<p><strong>Kristy Hopkins</strong>: (seriously) I owe you two.</p>
<p>(She stands up and leans in to kiss NICK on the cheek. NICK takes a breath and a step back from her.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You know where to find me.</p>
<p>(He nods and walks away. KRISTY watches NICK leave. She smiles, then finally gets into her car.)</p>

[INT. BERLIN RESIDENCE - DAY]</p>
<p>(The DETECTIVE is on the phone. SARA and WARRICK walk into the living room.)</p>
<p><strong>Detective</strong>: (on phone) Is that right? (hangs up) Your boy Kenny just lawyered up.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, we got a warrant so that should give us the room for the night.</p>
<p>(SARA sits at the desk and turns the computer on. Nothing happens.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: There's something wrong with it.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Computers turn on. When they don't, it's for a reason. Did you plug it in?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The power light's on.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Really?</p>
<p>(WARRICK grabs the unit.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Let me check it out.</p>
<p>(He opens up the case and stops at what he finds inside.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, he's a sneaky S.O.B. I'll give him that.</p>
<p>(SARA stands up and looks inside.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Oh, no one is going to believe this.</p>
<p>(WARRICK snaps a photo.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: All right.</p>
<p>(SARA picks up the gun and looks at the handle.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Let me see that flashlight. There's scratches all over it.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Nothing really special about them.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: And the hotshot takes another strike. Check it out. Not enough to cause even a small scratch on your finger, but more than enough to use as a basis of comparison.</p>
<p>(Camera zooms into the piece of glass stuck in the bottom of the handle. WARRICK takes it out.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We match this to the broken window, we got him.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI -- LAB]</p>
<p>(WARRICK and SARA test the glass.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: One, two, three.</p>
<p>(The pieces of glass are dropped into two different glass containers.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Left one is from the broken window the other one is from the gun both dropping at an identical rate. Glass is from the same source.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So, Kenny broke the window from the inside using the butt of the gun.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: My theory ... the brother was the executor of the parents' estate. He controlled the family money.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Sounds like more than a theory.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I called the county clerk. With the brother out of the way, Kenny is the sole beneficiary.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: KENNY pulls a gun on JEFF.) </p>
<p><strong>Kenny Berlin</strong>: Do you have any idea how much money I've lost?</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Berlin</strong>: Kenny, come on. What are you doing? I'm your brother, okay? I already said I'd loan you the money, okay?</p>
<p><strong>Kenny Berlin</strong>: (shouts) Come on! $20,000? That doesn't even begin to solve my problems!</p>
<p>(KENNY fires twice. JEFF falls to the floor. KENNY looks around. He tosses the room. He walks over to the window and breaks it with the gun. He goes to the computer and puts the gun inside.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Slam that jail door. (He looks at SARA.) Makes you reconsider, doesn't it?</p>
<p>(SARA knows exactly what he's referencing.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I never said you weren't a good CSI.</p>
<p>(SARA walks away.)</p>

[INT. TRUCKING MAIN OFFICE]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and GRISSOM speak with the DISPATCHER. She shows them the monitor which has a picture of a map with all the trucks out on the road represented by flashing red rectangles. The screen is riddled with them.)</p>
<p><strong>Dispatcher</strong>: We're state-of-the-art here -- number one in vehicle satellite tracking. I can locate one or all of our trucks with just a click of a mouse, 24-7.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to CATHERINE) Do you ever worry that technology is going to make us obsolete?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (firmly) No.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Can you, uh, narrow your database? Say, eliminate all trucks that are not refrigerated?</p>
<p><strong>Dispatcher</strong>: Yeah, I think I can.</p>
<p>(The DISPATCHER works on the keyboard and some of the red dots disappear.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Can you eliminate all trucks that were not in Las Vegas yesterday? </p>
<p>(More red dots disappear.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Eliminate all trucks that only travel in state.</p>
<p>(More red dots disappear.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Now eliminate the trucks that don't deliver to supermarkets along the I-15.</p>
<p>(They work to reduce the number of truck possibilities. There are only three flashing red dots on the monitor.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This is very cool. Eliminate all trucks that did not deliver to Marty's Market yesterday.</p>
<p>(She enters in the field condition. Camera cuts to the monitor where there are four flashing red dots. All but one disappear.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: That's our guy. He delivered to all five towns -- all five supermarkets.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Where is he now?</p>
<p>(Camera zooms in to the red flashing rectangle on screen.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>

[EXT. -- DAY]</p>
<p>(A man signs a clipboard. He looks up when the police cars drive up and surround him. OFFICERS with their weapons drawn exit the cars.)</p>
<p><strong>Officers</strong>: Police! Get your hands up! OFFICERS: Come out now!</p>
<p>(BRASS gets out of the car with his gun drawn.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Police! Step away from the truck, put your hands on the back of your head! Keep your hands in sight! </p>
<p>(The truck door opens and a woman gets out of the front seat.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Get out of the truck! </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Hands over your head!</p>
<p>(BRASS walks up to the MALE TRUCKER with the clipboard in his hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Step away from the truck. Put your hands on the back of your head.</p>
<p><strong>Male Trucker</strong>: I'm just making my regular delivery.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Don't make me ask you twice. Move! Hands on the back of your head! Hands on the back of your head!</p>
<p>(The MALE TRUCKER puts the clipboard down and complies.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and CATHERINE get out of their cars, watch and wait.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Left hand on the wall, right hand on the wall. Check him for weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: (b.g.) Spread your legs.</p>
<p>(BRASS approaches the back of the truck.)</p>
<p><strong>Male Trucker</strong>: Hey, get away from my truck!</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's not your truck anymore. It's our crime scene.</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Check the cab. </p>
<p>(The OFFICER follows BRASS into the truck, then backs out. BRASS appears holstering his gun.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: It's all yours.</p>
<p><strong>Cop</strong>: (b.g.) All clean here, sir.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and CATHERINE step into the back of the truck.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: [INT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS])</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks inside, weaving in between the large pieces of frozen meat wrapped in plastic. He looks at a particularly long and thing piece of meat hanging in front of him and moves to unwrap it.)</p>
<p>(It's just a piece of frozen meat.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks past GRISSOM to the back of the truck where a smaller refrigerator unit is. GRISSOM watches her and helps her open it.)</p>
<p>(There's no bodies inside, just smaller pieces of items wrapped plastic.)</p>
<p>(They reach the back of the truck where they find another refrigerator unit. GRISSOM and CATHERINE open it. They both gasp at the frozen bodies inside.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE sighs.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. - DAY]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks toward the MALE TRUCKER.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We got three.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks past CATHERINE and turns the MALE TRUCKER around to face him.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (grimly) Where is she? Where is Margaret Shorey?</p>
<p><strong>Male Trucker</strong>: (flippantly) Screw you, man.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Look, pal, I already know what happened. I even know your type -- decent, trusting, middle-aged women.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Inside the bathroom at Marty's Market, MARGARET SHOREY is scrubbing the mustard off of her dress.)</p>
<p><strong>Girlfriend</strong>: Please help me. You got to help me! I locked my baby in the car!</p>
<p><strong>Margaret Shorey</strong>: Did you call the manager?</p>
<p><strong>Girlfriend</strong>: It is so hot, she's going to die. Please help me!</p>
<p><strong>Margaret Shorey</strong>: All ... all right. </p>
<p>(Cut to: Outside in the back of the market, the GIRLFRIEND leads MARGARET SHOREY to her &quot;car&quot;.)</p>
<p><strong>Margaret Shorey</strong>: Where's your car?</p>
<p><strong>Girlfriend</strong>: This way.</p>
<p>(The MALE TRUCKER jumps out from between the crates and grabs MARGARET SHOREY from behind. She screams.)</p>
<p><strong>Male Trucker</strong>: Go on! Write it!</p>
<p>(The GIRLFRIEND looks around as MARGARET SHOREY continues to scream. She hesitates, then heads back into the Market.)</p>
<p>(Cut back to: Inside the bathroom, the GIRLFRIEND uncaps the marker and writes the message on the stall door.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(BRASS grabs both the MALE TRUCKER and the GIRLFRIEND, each arm around each of their shoulders.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Okay. All right, listen. The first one of you lowlifes can name that tune gets to make a deal. Hmm? The difference between the chair or life in prison. So ...</p>
<p>(She looks around, then speaks up.)</p>
<p><strong>Girlfriend</strong>: He made me do it.</p>
<p>(The MALE TRUCKER lunges for her. She screams.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Cuff him.</p>
<p>(The officers take the Male Trucker away.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (softly) Hey, hey, hey ... Where is she?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(GRISSOM and CATHERINE head into the front of the truck. GRISSOM crawls inside and checks out their seats. They lift the mattress up.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: There's a lock. Are there any keys?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks around and finds some.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Try this.</p>
<p>(They unlock the compartment and find MARGARET SHOREY bound and gagged inside.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hello, Margaret. My name is Gil. This is Catherine.</p>

[INT. CSI - WAITING ROOM]</p>
<p>(SARA walks in to the main reception area. In the waiting room, a boy holding a football sits alone. He appears to be looking for someone.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You look lost.</p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong>: Oh... yeah. Do you know Warrick Brown?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah. You want me to tell him you're here?</p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong>: Oh, he's probably working. He works really hard. If you see him could you just tell him that, uh, Jason says thanks?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Okay. Will he know what for?</p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong>: Uh ... </p>
<p>(WARRICK walks in and sees JASON.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey, Jas, how you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong>: Better. Hey, thanks for busting me loose. My mom said she'll pay you back.</p>
<p>WARRICK No, you'll pay me back, Shorty. Just don't be pulling any more fire alarms.</p>
<p>(SARA looks down and puts it all together.)</p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong>: Oh, I won't</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Gets you more attention than you want.</p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong>: I know.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You still working on those moves I showed you?</p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong>: Yeah, every day after school.</p>
<p>(They spar for a moment; SARA smiles.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: How about that? How about that right there? Good.</p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong>: Hey, I got to go. My mom's waiting for me.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey, come here.</p>
<p>(WARRICK leans over and puts his hand around JASON'S shoulders to speak confidentially to him.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Apologize to your mom, all right? Let her know she can trust you.</p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: All right?</p>
<p>(SARA definitely overhears it.)</p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong>: Bye, Warrick. Uh ... see you next week.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: See you next week, jaws.</p>
<p>(JASON leaves.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So you went to the casino to win bail money.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: He needed my help. I didn't win anything, Sara. You're a CSI. You saw me enter a casino. Did you see me place a bet?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You want to tell me you didn't?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I don't have to tell you anything. (sighs) Look, I went there to collect a debt that was owed to me. (pause) We're supposed to be working together. Next time, just try talking to me instead of going around behind my back.</p>
<p>(WARRICK turns and leaves. SARA watches him walk down the hallway.)</p>

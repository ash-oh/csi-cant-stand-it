Narrator : Previously on CSI: 


Nick: May I see your discoloration?
Kristy Hopkins: You want to give me twenty bucks?
Nick: You want to do time?

CUT TO:


Warrick: You know what, I got to be somewhere. Can you handle this from here?
Catherine: Yeah.
CUT TO:
 
Conrad Ecklie: Warrick Brown had one of my guys sub for him in court, but I have it on good authority that he was gambling.
CUT TO:

Grissom: I need you to do some background for me on Warrick.
Sara: Warrick? Your favorite CSI.
Grissom: That's why I want you to handle it so that Ecklie can't accuse me of favoritism.
CUT TO:
 
Sara: I got this surveillance tape. He was in the casino. I'm sorry.
WHITE FLASH TO: END OF PREVIOUSLY ON.

Brass: Well, if it isn't the boss himself! Where's your E-street band?
Grissom: They had another gig. How you doing, Jim? How's your old job?
Brass: Ah, I can sling scum all day long. You?
Grissom: I curse more.
Brass: Oh, yeah? Well, wait. The shopping cart's over here. The missing woman is Margaret Shorey. Lives with her sister. Went out to get groceries; never came home. Car's still in the parking lot.

Grissom: And her purse is still in the cart. With no wallet. 
Brass: Maybe she left the purse as a marker.
Grissom: Chicken soup, ice packs ... pain reliever ...
Brass: Sister broke her wrist in a car wreck.
Grissom: Hot dogs, hot dog buns ...
Brass: Junk-food junkie.

Brass: Oh, that's sanitary.
Grissom: Mustard.

Grissom:  Did you have any mop-ups in this aisle today?
Store Manager: Yeah. Yeah, as a matter of fact, we did.
Grissom: Life holds no surprises. 

Grissom: $1.98 for the mustard ... plus, my two cents.

Brass: What are you doing?
Grissom: Now, where would you go?
CUT TO:




Brass:  Oh, man ...
Grissom: Hey, Brass, look at this.
Brass: What?
Grissom: You see this?

Brass: See what?
Grissom: This circumference? Looks like somebody did a brillo job on it.
Brass: All I see is a clean door.
Grissom: You know anything about this?
Store Manager: Yeah, he's right -- we cleaned it up today. I had a complaint. Kids are always writing crazy stuff on bathroom doors. So I had one of my employees scrub it off.
Grissom: Could I borrow a hammer?
CUT TO:




I've killed ...  ...
.... Catch ...  ...
... me ...  ...
... can ...  ...

Grissom:  &quot;Iv'e killed 5 women. Catch me if you can?&quot;

Grissom: Hey.

Grissom: Hey, kids. All right, listen, hey, I got to jet.
Catherine: Hi.
Grissom: Sara Sidle. 419.

Sara: Dead body-- bonus.
Catherine: Whoa, somebody likes their job.
Grissom: Nick Stokes-- 416, fight at the Bellagio. She says she's a &quot;friend&quot; of yours.
Catherine: Ex-girlfriend, Nick?
Nick: Well, that depends. Was she the assaulter or the assaultee?
Sara: You tell us -- you like leather or lace?
Nick:  No, I'm not even going there. 

Nick: Lace.

Grissom: Catherine, you have a 418 -- an obituary on a stall door. I'll meet you in the garage but first, I've got to take care of Warrick.
Catherine: Oh, no. What are you going to do?

Grissom: I don't know.

Sara: I filed my report.
Grissom: I read it.

CUT TO:



Grissom: Hey.
Warrick: Hey. I missed assignments; I know. I'm running late. What did I pull?

Grissom: How was court the other day?
Warrick: I handed it off to Michovitch, from days. Uh, I told Sara.
Grissom: Yeah, because you had, uh, &quot;personal business.&quot;

Warrick: Yeah. 

Warrick: What's that?
Grissom: You ... at the Monaco casino.
Warrick: What? I don't believe this. Now you're pulling up film on me?
Grissom: Casinos tape everyone who walks through their door, Warrick, you know that. I thought we had a deal.
Warrick: We do.
Grissom: Look, what you do on your time is nobody's business. What you do on my time is my business.

Warrick: I was at the casino. But I wasn't gambling.

CUT TO:



Officer: Okay, Rubio's Restaurant.

Sara:  Get me a picture of the body ... the items on the bedsheet ... the window ... the drafting table.

Sara: Everything on the floor.

Sara: Sara Sidle, crime scene investigation. And you are ... ?
Kenny Berlin:  I'm ... Kenny Berlin. That's my brother. I'm the one who found him.
Sara: Sorry for your loss.  You want to tell me what happened here?
Kenny Berlin: I don't ... I don't know. I came... I came walking in the door, I saw my brother lying there ... stuff everywhere. All I could think was that ...

Jeff Berlin: Hey!


Kenny Berlin: Hey, Jeff?

Kenny Berlin:  I-I called 9-1-1

Kenny Berlin: ... and then you guys showed up, and...
Detective:  Thank you. 

Detective: There have been several burglaries in the neighborhood; all benign.
Sara: Nothing benign about two $20s screaming, &quot;take me&quot; on the bar.
Detective: Maybe he missed it?
Sara: Yeah, well, it's hard to miss all that high-tech computer equipment. There's got to be five, ten grand there. First thing I'd take.
Detective: He was interrupted.
Sara: Before or after he used a bedsheet to transport the silverware? Pillowcases are the norm, you know that. Something's not right.

CUT TO:




Nick: Gentlemen, Nick Stokes. I'm here for the 416; something about a &quot;special request.&quot;
Officer Pratt: Don't ask me. Go ask Catherine Zeta Jones over there.
Nick: Over where?

Nick: Thanks.

Nick: Excuse me ... ma'am?

Kristy Hopkins: Oh, Nick, hey ...
Nick: You got to be kidding me.
Kristy Hopkins: Oh, you probably don't recognize me with the shorter hair. My nipples are all better, you want to see?
Nick: Yeah, yeah, Kristy Hopkins, what are you doing here?
Security Guard:  I'll tell you what she's doing here-- she's cruising.
Kristy Hopkins: No, I'm in here, minding my own business shopping for a dress spending my hard-earned money!  Okay, semi-hard-earned money. When Squiggy over here starts harassing me saying he doesn't want my type in here. He grabs my arm, cops a feel then he spit on me, so I slugged him!
Nick: Whoa, whoa, whoa ... he spit on you?
Security Guard: Wait, you're not listening to this? This is such a crock.
Kristy Hopkins: Oh, I'll show you ...

Nick: All right, all right, break it up! Ease up! Ease up!

Security Guard: Hey, hey, I'm pressing charges! I don't care who you know!
Nick: Kristy!
Kristy Hopkins: What?!
Officer Pratt: They're right -- I've got to take her in.
Nick:  Get over here! I need your shirt.

Kristy Hopkins: Why is it every time we meet you're wanting me to take my clothes off?
Nick: Because every time we meet you put yourself in a position where you have to take them off.
CUT TO:

 

Sara: Using your arms -- how big's a whale?

Sara: Now freeze, don't move.  Up.

Kenny Berlin: What are you doing?
Sara: Checking for blood spatter.
Kenny Berlin:  What blood? Am I a suspect?
Sara: This is what I do. This is how I eliminate you as a suspect.
Officer: I'll take that for you.

Sara: Well, that's good news; no blood, bud.

Sara: I am going to need you to strip, though.
Kenny Berlin: Right here?
Sara: Don't be shy on my account. But if you are, this nice detective will accompany you to the bedroom.

Sara: Oh, and, uh, I'm going to need to take your window with me, too. 

Sara: It's all in the warrant.

CUT TO:



Dr. Rabar: The person who wrote this is left-handed.
Grissom: And we know that because...?
Dr. Rabar: The &quot;t-bar&quot; in &quot;catch,&quot; it's left-tending. And uneducated ... the contraction in &quot;IV'E&quot; is misplaced. Then we have the large, arched hood in the letter &quot;Y&quot; and the arches in the bottom of the &quot;L's.&quot; This indicates criminal tendency which is supported by the heavy pastiosity which suggests low impulse control.
Catherine: Heavy pastiosity?
Dr. Rabar: The pressure -- how firmly you put pen to paper.
Grissom: Or marker to metal. Do we know anything else?
Dr. Rabar: Yes. Overall, the handwriting is cursive and round. This tells me it was written by a woman.

FADE TO BLACK.


FADE IN.



Warrick: Damn! Taking the whole window.

Sara: Grissom reinstated you.
Warrick: And you have a problem with that.
Sara: Let me guess. Grissom gets you to dime yourself off and now you both feel better? You're supposed to be in court. Instead, you're placing bets for a cheap thrill to satisfy nothing.
Warrick: Hey! This has nothing to do with you. So are we going to work together ... or not?
Sara: I'm already working.

CUT TO:




Sara:  You weren't in your office.
Grissom: And good morning to you, too, Miss Sidle.
Sara: Warrick has a problem. Ignoring it isn't going to make it go away. You asked me for a report and then you disregard my recommendation.
Grissom: I read your report.
Sara: So you feel comfortable jeopardizing a unit to placate an addict?
Grissom: I see the whole puzzle, Sara. You're only seeing one piece.
Sara: Then at least take him off my case.
Grissom: No. I trust him. Do you trust me?

Catherine: Grissom.  I've got something you'll want to see.

CUT TO:



Catherine: You know how you're always pushing that holy trinity stuff?
Grissom: Father, son, holy ghost?
Catherine: Victim, suspect, crime scene.
Grissom: That one, huh?
Catherine: Right. Well, we don't have a victim. We don't have a suspect. All we have is a crime scene -- the restroom at Marty's Market with the message, &quot;I killed five women.&quot; So, I figured there had to be four others.

Grissom: You found the other four victims?

Catherine: No. I found the four other crime scenes.
CUT TO:



Catherine: Brass ran our case through VICAP. 

Catherine: I made a few calls ...

Grissom:  &quot;Iv'e killed 1 woman.&quot; Victorville. Salt Lake City -- &quot;Iv'e killed 2 women. Catch me if you can?&quot; San Bernardino -- &quot;Iv'e killed 3 women ... &quot; &quot;Iv'e killed 4 women. Catch me!&quot; Mesquite. &quot;...5 women... &quot; Las Vegas.
Catherine: Five stall doors from five supermarket rest rooms. Five missing women, including Margaret Shorey.
Grissom: What else do you know about the crime scenes?
Catherine: Just like Marty's Market -- there was no physical evidence indicating that the women were killed there.
Grissom: Which means they were probably alive when these messages were written making these messages of intention, not fact. 

Grissom: What if we shuffle these doors like Pai Gow tiles?

Grissom: San Bernardino, California. Victorville, California. Las Vegas, Nevada. Mesquite, Nevada. Salt Lake City, Utah.

Catherine:  Interstate 15. God knows I've driven it enough times.
Grissom:  So has our suspect.

CUT TO:



Greg Sanders: Okay, dude, it's ready.

Greg Sanders: So this paper should have soaked up any foreign material on the shirt particularly amylase.

Greg Sanders: Now, I've done this procedure on jeans and leather jackets but never on something like this. It's very see-through. Very Jennifer Lopez.
Nick: Down, boy. What can you tell me? Is there saliva on it?
Greg Sanders: It's going to be a tough one to prove. This is only step one. You see, when a person talks saliva naturally comes out of their mouth. Let's say that we're tossing the hog back and forth, right?

Greg Sanders: What can you tell me about the hottie that goes inside this blouse, huh? Is it true she's a friend of yours?
Nick: What, is it on the internet? Might as well be. Just remember that.
Greg Sanders: My saliva's getting on you; your saliva's getting on me.
Nick: Gross.

Nick: What's that stuff?
Greg Sanders: Starch and iodine. If this is saliva, we're going to get the old dalmatian effect. So, Nick, uh, if I wanted to meet this friend of yours ... ?
Nick: No.
Greg Sanders: Figured.

Greg Sanders: That's a pretty big spot. That's more than just a spray. In fact, looks like a distinct glob of spit.
Nick: Then Kristy was telling the truth. But it doesn't mean it was the security guard's spit.
Greg Sanders: Step three.
Nick: I'm going to need a sample.
Greg Sanders: Well, the guy knows he did it. He's not going to cough it up.
Nick: If you saw the girl that went with this blouse ... you'd try.
CUT TO:



Kenny Berlin: You found what on my pants?
Sara: Glass. Any idea how it got there?
Kenny Berlin: Well, it's just a guess but someone broke into my car last weekend and smashed my window and made off with my CD player. So I must've been wearing those pants.
Sara: Did you file a police report?
Kenny Berlin: No, but you can check with my insurance company.
Sara: I already checked with my lab. They do this test, and guess what? The glass -- it floated.
Warrick: You know what that means?
Kenny Berlin: No.
Warrick: It means the glass on your pants and the glass from your living room window have equal densities.
Kenny Berlin: Sorry. I was never very good at science.
Warrick: The glass didn't come from any car window. That's science.
Sara: Anything else you'd like to tell us?
Kenny Berlin: Look, it's like I told you. I walked in the house ...

Kenny Berlin:  ... and I thought ...

Kenny Berlin: &quot;They're coming back, and they're going to kill me, too.&quot;

Kenny Berlin:  I heard a noise, and I walked to the window.

Kenny Berlin:  That must be when I got the glass in my pants.

Kenny Berlin: Look, somebody really did break into my car, okay? And I just remembered all that stuff just now. So, am I in trouble?
Warrick: You're free to go.
Sara: No, he's not.
Warrick: We're not cops; we can't hold him.
Sara: Just one more question. What do you do for a living?
Kenny Berlin: I'm a day trader.
Sara: You make a lot of money doing that?
Kenny Berlin: That's two questions.
Sara: Feel free to answer it anyway.
Kenny Berlin: Yeah, you can.

Sara:  But you don't, right?

Warrick: Showed him all your cards. Sucker play.
Sara: I was playing him. Cops ran Kenny's financials. He lost a pot in the market. Had a ton of margin calls. I'm surprised you didn't tag him as a fellow gambler.
Warrick:  Oh, you just don't let up, do you?
Sara: It's a flaw.
CUT TO:



Catherine: I'll flip you to see who drives.
Grissom: Where we going?
Catherine: Moapa.
Grissom: What's in Moapa?
Catherine: Besides the I-15?
CUT TO:


 

Brass: So my guys tell me that your guy Nick is helping a working girl at a five-star and it was quite a commotion.
Grissom: Really?
Brass: And if I know, it means a lot of other people know. People bigger than you and me. A kid from a crime lab doing favors for a hooker can't make the unit look too good, huh, boss?
Grissom: Yeah, well, I'll get into it.
Brass: I bet that's just what Nicky said.

Catherine: You two ladies done talking? It's hot out here.
Brass: That kid over there started to take a leak.

Brass:  Found the body.


Catherine: Well, it's not Margaret. This one's a blonde.
Grissom: And blue. This is bizarre. The body's cold.
Brass: In this heat?
Grissom: And she's stiff -- like a two-minute burrito that's only been nuked for a minute.
WHITE FLASH TO:


 
Dr. Jenna Williams: Meet Joan Sims from San Bernardino, California. We've been getting acquainted.
Catherine:  Missing woman number one -- disappeared from a supermarket restroom last July.
Dr. Jenna Williams: Cause of death was strangulation. I found ligature marks on the wrists and the ankles. That was the easy part. This one's weird. Like I-may-use-her-in-a-lecture weird.  Her decomp is completely backwards. It's supposed to begin on the inside but her organs are in better shape than her skin. Take a look at this.

Dr. Jenna Williams: I took tissue samples from her heart.

Grissom: Looks like the planet krypton.
Dr. Jenna Williams: More like kryptonite. Those are actually ice crystals, Superman. You want to know why she's blue? Cold to the touch in the middle of the desert? This lady was frozen -- kept on ice until approximately 12 hours ago.

Catherine: I-15? Refrigerated?
Grissom: That's how she was transported from San Bernardino to Vegas -- in a refrigerated truck. That's our crime scene.

Grissom: And it's mobile.
FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN.



Grissom: Hey, Nick, I been looking for you. 

Grissom: This girl you've been helping with the 416 .. .?
Nick: She got in a fight with a Security Guard.
Grissom: Is she a friend of yours?
Nick:  Are you asking me what I think you're asking me?
Grissom: Are you doing anything that could compromise the unit?
Nick: I don't believe this. You've always been so cool.
Grissom: I have to ask. It's part of the job.
Nick: Sanders ratted me out, right?
Grissom: No, Brass. Do you want to talk about this?
Nick: I don't think so.

Catherine:  What's his problem?
Grissom: Me, I guess. Did you find out anything?
Catherine: Brass got us a list of all the refrigerated trucks that made deliveries to the market yesterday. 
 
Catherine: There's a female trucker on it.

CUT TO:



Sara:  Not bad. I'm impressed.
Warrick: Yeah, passed up a chance to play semipro ball. Went to college instead.

Sara: I meant the Haeckel marks. Should tell us what we need to know.

Sara: This is the glass you line-drived.
Warrick: That's the glass you &quot;sawzalled.&quot;

Sara: Right angles face the same direction. Take a look.

Warrick: Oh, now I'm worthy?
Sara: Just take a damn look.

CUT TO:


Kenny Berlin: That's crazy. I loved my brother.
Warrick: Maybe you did, maybe you didn't, but we think you murdered him.
Kenny Berlin: Based on what?
Warrick: The evidence.
Kenny Berlin: What evidence?!
Sara: You ever heard of Haeckel marks?
Kenny Berlin: No.
Warrick: When a window is broken from the outside which is what a burglar would do ...

Warrick:  ... Haeckel marks form right angles to the inside of the window. 

Warrick: But when a window is broken from the inside which is what a Peckerwood like you would do

Warrick:  ... Haeckel marks form right angles to the outside of the window.


Sara: What did you use to break the window, Kenny?
Kenny Berlin: I didn't use anything. I didn't do it.  I want a lawyer.

CUT TO:



Warrick: Well, we know he did it.
Sara: We can't prove it, but we got a motive.
Warrick: He needed the money.
Sara: Okay, let's say killing his brother would get it for him.
Warrick: We're back to how do we prove it?
Sara: He's a day trader -- spends all day on his computer. If we want to know more about him that's where we should be looking.
Warrick: And his computer is ... ?
Sara: Still at the house.
Warrick: Still at the house. Well, we got probable cause.
Sara: Why don't we go get a ... ?
Warrick: Why don't you go get a new warrant?

CUT TO:



FISH ABOVE DOOR:  I want to know / can you help me, help me ... 

Grissom: That's my &quot;Big Mouth Billy Bass.&quot; It's better than a watchdog. I got valuable stuff in here, you know.
FISH ABOVE DOOR:  Drop me in the water ... 

Nick: Yeah, I bet there are a lot of people looking to steal your two-headed scorpion. Not to mention &quot;Miss Piggy.&quot; 

Nick: I was out of line earlier. I'm not sleeping with her, if it helps any.
Grissom: It does.
Nick: And, for the record she wasn't working -- she was shopping. And the security guard was a jerk, man. He pushed her around, then he spit on her. That's why she lost it.
Grissom: That sounds pretty straightforward. Why don't you put a rookie on it?
Nick: I can't. There's something about her. Looking at her. She doesn't have anybody else. I had Sanders run a test on the shirt. There's saliva on it but the problem is, I can't get a match. The security guard refuses to give me a sample.
Grissom: &quot;If Muhammad won't go to the mountain then the mountain must go to Muhammad.&quot; Think about it.

CUT TO:



Nick: Black, no sugar.
Security Guard: Yeah, thanks.
Nick: Like I said on the phone I don't want to seem biased here. This girl's nothing to me. She's a hooker.
Security Guard: Yeah, but you do know her.
Nick: Yeah, professionally. But my profession, not hers. I cut her some slack a while back. She's bad news but she's a babe.
Security Guard: Tell me about it. 
Nick: Yeah, between you and me, I should have busted her, but I thought I might get lucky.
Security Guard: Yeah.
Nick: Yeah. Next time she gets in a jam she throws my name out. My boss not pleased. So ...  I want you to write down your own statement seal it up in this envelope and I'll hand deliver it to the DA. It'll be good for both of us.
Security Guard:  Yeah. Thanks, man.
Nick: No problem. Us guys have got to stick together, right? That's right.
Security Guard: That's right. Yeah.


CUT TO:



Female Trucker: Of course I graduated high school. Hey, if this is going to take forever I could lay a urine sample on you, too gratis.
Grissom: A writing sample will be sufficient, thank you.
Female Trucker: What's that going to tell you -- whether I was writing under the influence?

Catherine: Do yourself a favor.
Female Trucker: Yes, ma'am. Now, what is it that you want me to write?
Catherine: &quot;I've got a kite. Can you see the women? Kill the lights.&quot;
Female Trucker: That's what you want me to write?

Catherine: Three times.

Catherine: Caucasian female with only a high school education and left-handed.

Brass: You can keep the pen as a souvenir.

Catherine: I'll be right back.
Female Trucker: Hey, come on! You're making me late.

Brass: Hey, hey, hey.

Brass: Two cheeks on the car. There you go.

INTERCUT WITH:



Catherine:  She's not the one.
Female Trucker: So, did I win something?
Catherine: The right to keep on trucking.

Brass: Here you go, bubba.
Female Trucker: Hey, we're outta here!
Grissom: You know, I'm starting to think that maybe we should be looking for a man. Only three percent of multiple killers are female. And a woman wouldn't need a trophy. And a body on ice is definitely a trophy.
Catherine: Well, Ms. Hard-ass travels with her boyfriend. I bet you a lot of guys travel with their girlfriends.
Grissom: What if it was a man with a woman who would do anything he asked?
FADE TO BLACK.


FADE IN.



Nick: &quot;Us guys have to stick together, right?&quot; He said, &quot;right. You the man!&quot;

Nick: So, I mean, I could have used an STR-DNA but it's too state-of-the-art; it's overkill. So I used an HLA-DQ A1, with a ... polymarker.

Kristy Hopkins: That's-that's very, very interesting.

Nick:  You don't care about this at all, do you?
Kristy Hopkins: No. 
Are they?

Nick: DA threw out the case.
Kristy Hopkins: Great.  

Kristy Hopkins: I'd invite you out for coffee, it's probably a bad idea, huh?
Nick: Yeah.
Kristy Hopkins: Yeah. But I can call you sometime, you know just in case I ever get into trouble or something.
Nick:  Maybe you should try not getting into trouble. You do owe me one.
Kristy Hopkins:  I owe you two.

Nick: You know where to find me.

CUT TO:



Detective:  Your boy Kenny just lawyered up.
Warrick: Well, we got a warrant so that should give us the room for the night.

Sara: There's something wrong with it.
Warrick: Computers turn on. When they don't, it's for a reason. Did you plug it in?
Sara: The power light's on.
Warrick: Really?

Warrick: Let me check it out.

Warrick: Well, he's a sneaky S.O.B. I'll give him that.

Sara: Oh, no one is going to believe this.

Warrick: All right.

Warrick: Let me see that flashlight. There's scratches all over it.
Sara: Nothing really special about them.
Warrick: And the hotshot takes another strike. Check it out. Not enough to cause even a small scratch on your finger, but more than enough to use as a basis of comparison.

Sara: We match this to the broken window, we got him.
CUT TO:



Warrick: One, two, three.

Warrick: Left one is from the broken window the other one is from the gun both dropping at an identical rate. Glass is from the same source.
Sara: So, Kenny broke the window from the inside using the butt of the gun.
Warrick: My theory ... the brother was the executor of the parents' estate. He controlled the family money.
Sara: Sounds like more than a theory.
Warrick: I called the county clerk. With the brother out of the way, Kenny is the sole beneficiary.
 
Kenny Berlin: Do you have any idea how much money I've lost?
Jeff Berlin: Kenny, come on. What are you doing? I'm your brother, okay? I already said I'd loan you the money, okay?
Kenny Berlin:  Come on! $20,000? That doesn't even begin to solve my problems!


Warrick: Slam that jail door.  Makes you reconsider, doesn't it?

Sara: I never said you weren't a good CSI.

CUT TO:



Dispatcher: We're state-of-the-art here -- number one in vehicle satellite tracking. I can locate one or all of our trucks with just a click of a mouse, 24-7.
Grissom:  Do you ever worry that technology is going to make us obsolete?
Catherine:  No.
Grissom: Can you, uh, narrow your database? Say, eliminate all trucks that are not refrigerated?
Dispatcher: Yeah, I think I can.

Grissom: Can you eliminate all trucks that were not in Las Vegas yesterday? 

Catherine: Eliminate all trucks that only travel in state.

Catherine: Now eliminate the trucks that don't deliver to supermarkets along the I-15.

Grissom: This is very cool. Eliminate all trucks that did not deliver to Marty's Market yesterday.

Catherine: That's our guy. He delivered to all five towns -- all five supermarkets.
Grissom: Where is he now?

CUT TO:



Officers: Police! Get your hands up! OFFICERS: Come out now!

Brass: Police! Step away from the truck, put your hands on the back of your head! Keep your hands in sight! 

Brass: Get out of the truck! 
Officer: Hands over your head!

Brass: Step away from the truck. Put your hands on the back of your head.
Male Trucker: I'm just making my regular delivery.
Brass: Don't make me ask you twice. Move! Hands on the back of your head! Hands on the back of your head!


Brass: Left hand on the wall, right hand on the wall. Check him for weapons.
Officer:  Spread your legs.

Male Trucker: Hey, get away from my truck!
Grissom: It's not your truck anymore. It's our crime scene.
Officer: Check the cab. 

Brass: It's all yours.
Cop:  All clean here, sir.








CUT TO:


Catherine: We got three.

Grissom:  Where is she? Where is Margaret Shorey?
Male Trucker:  Screw you, man.
Grissom: Look, pal, I already know what happened. I even know your type -- decent, trusting, middle-aged women.

Girlfriend: Please help me. You got to help me! I locked my baby in the car!
Margaret Shorey: Did you call the manager?
Girlfriend: It is so hot, she's going to die. Please help me!
Margaret Shorey: All ... all right. 

Margaret Shorey: Where's your car?
Girlfriend: This way.

Male Trucker: Go on! Write it!




Brass: Okay. All right, listen. The first one of you lowlifes can name that tune gets to make a deal. Hmm? The difference between the chair or life in prison. So ...

Girlfriend: He made me do it.

Brass: Cuff him.

Brass:  Hey, hey, hey ... Where is she?
CUT TO:

Grissom: There's a lock. Are there any keys?

Catherine: Try this.

Grissom: Hello, Margaret. My name is Gil. This is Catherine.
Catherine: We're going to take you home.
CUT TO:



Sara: You look lost.
Jason: Oh... yeah. Do you know Warrick Brown?
Sara: Yeah. You want me to tell him you're here?
Jason: Oh, he's probably working. He works really hard. If you see him could you just tell him that, uh, Jason says thanks?
Sara: Okay. Will he know what for?
Jason: Uh ... 

Warrick: Hey, Jas, how you doing?
Jason: Better. Hey, thanks for busting me loose. My mom said she'll pay you back.
WARRICK No, you'll pay me back, Shorty. Just don't be pulling any more fire alarms.

Jason: Oh, I won't
Warrick: Gets you more attention than you want.
Jason: I know.
Warrick: You still working on those moves I showed you?
Jason: Yeah, every day after school.

Warrick: How about that? How about that right there? Good.
Jason: Hey, I got to go. My mom's waiting for me.
Warrick: Hey, come here.

Warrick: Apologize to your mom, all right? Let her know she can trust you.
Jason: Yeah.
Warrick: All right?

Jason: Bye, Warrick. Uh ... see you next week.
Warrick: See you next week, jaws.

Sara: So you went to the casino to win bail money.
Warrick: He needed my help. I didn't win anything, Sara. You're a CSI. You saw me enter a casino. Did you see me place a bet?
Sara: You want to tell me you didn't?
Warrick: I don't have to tell you anything.  We're supposed to be working together. Next time, just try talking to me instead of going around behind my back.

FADE TO BLACK.

<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. HOTEL BALLROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(In the darkness of the deserted auditorium, the back stage door opens. Someone walks in. She's one of the event coordinators making final checks for the show the next day. She walks up to the lighting console and turns on the switches for the main stage lights. She smiles as they go on.)</p>
<p>(She steps down from the console platform and walks past the curtains to the stage itself. She walks along the red-carpeted catwalk and stops at the end. She takes a moment and looks out into the empty seats in front of her.)</p>
<p>(The camera slowly moves lower and angles upward where we see the event sign hanging in the background for the &quot;International Organization of Little People / Fashion&quot;. That's not all we see hanging in the background. The camera continues to angle upward where we see the shadow of a figure hanging from the rafters.)</p>
<p>(The event coordinator is satisfied with the stage preparations. She turns around to leave and gasps as she sees the figure hanging high above the stage.)</p>
<p>FLASH TO WHITE:</p>
<hr />
[INT. HOTEL LOBBY -- NIGHT]</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Is this some kind of convention?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Little People Convention. Every year they come from all over the world to a designated city. Socialize, network. It's their Prom, Olympics, and New Year's Eve all rolled into one.</p>
<p>(SARA, GRISSOM and NICK make their way across the hotel lobby. All around them, dozens of Little People mill about, the lobby a bustling as with any other convention.)</p>
<p>(As they walk, a man in a wheelchair rides in the opposite direction toward them. He nearly runs into NICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Oh, hey. Excuse me.</p>
<p><strong>Man In The Wheelchair</strong>: Don't think so, square jaw.</p>
<p>(The MAN IN THE WHEELCHAIR leaves NICK wide-eyed and jaw hanging. GRISSOM and SARA continue along the ballroom unaware of NICK'S close encounter.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Grissom, how do you know this?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I get the newsletter.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. HOTEL AUDITORIUM - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Lawrence Ames, clothing salesman from phoenix. He's 35, four foot, five inches tall. </p>
<p>(BRASS accompanies the CSIs into the crime scene. They make their way up the stairs leading to the stage. Off on the side talking with an officer is MELANIE GRACE, the event coordinator who discovered the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: One of the, uh, convention organizers found him. She was checking out the stage. There's a fashion show tomorrow if you're interested. She looked up and saw him.</p>
<p>(The body hanging from above is slowly lowered.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Guy does a suicide in a public place. He was trying to make a statement.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Suicide?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It's a reasonable suspicion.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Suicide among any disability group is above average.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Being a dwarf doesn't mean you're disabled, Nick. It means you're ... short. </p>
<p>(The body stops just inches from the ground.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I think we've got a little murder.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<hr />
[EXT. RESIDENCE - DRIVEWAY -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE slams the door to her Tahoe shut. She pockets the keys and with her CSI kits in hand, makes her way up the driveway. On the way, she's met by DET. DREW WOLF.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. Drew Wolf</strong>: My favorite CSI. I was hoping you'd get the call out.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Look who's back in town? So, what happened, Drew? You didn't like ... Idaho? Is that it?</p>
<p><strong>Det. Drew Wolf</strong>: Had everything but you.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE laughs at the flattery.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, right. So, what have we got?</p>
<p><strong>Det. Drew Wolf</strong>: One body, male caucasian. Looks like a home invasion. Listen, I'm headed next door. I'm going to talk to a neighbor who heard shouting, called 9-1-1. Keep me posted?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Always did.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. RESIDENCE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Catherine walks into the large sunken living room. Standing guard over the body, preserving the crime scene, is FIRST OFFICER CLARK.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p>(FIRST OFFICER CLARK turns to her and gags a little. He can't answer her. CATHERINE introduces herself.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Willows. (FIRST OFFICER CLARK gives CATHERINE his name.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You clear the place?</p>
<p>FIRST OFFICER CLARK: Just finishing.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks at the dead body. The man is lying face-up in the living room, blood spilled out in a pool under him from a wound in his head. CATHERINE takes out the camera and begins taking pictures. FIRST OFFICER CLARK, standing guard by the living room door, groans and looks green. He takes a deep breath.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE'S cell phone rings. She puts her camera down and answers it.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah? (pause) Hey, Warrick. (pause) Uh, yeah, it, uh ... some kind of home invasion gone bad. Don't run any lights. I'll just process till the coroner gets here. (pause) Okay. Cool.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE hangs up. FIRST OFFICER CLARK behind her swallows. The poor guy's turning green being in the same room with the dead body.)</p>
<p>FIRST OFFICER CLARK: We were just pulling out of the chili place when dispatch radio, uh, arrived on the scene at 1900 hours. My partner secured the perimeter. I've been in here ...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: This your first time on body watch?</p>
<p>(FIRST OFFICER CLARK gags and nods his head.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well ... alive ... it's inside your bowels. Dead, it ends up on the floor.</p>
<p>(The camera moves to the mess under the dead body to emphasize CATHERINE'S point. FIRST OFFICER CLARK'S eyes move to the mess also. He begins to gag uncontrollably and puts and arm up to stop himself from contaminating the crime scene.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE sees his distress and waves him out of the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Go. Go, go, go. Just get some air.</p>
<p>(The Young Officer takes off out of the room. CATHERINE chuckles. She goes back to processing the crime scene.)</p>
<p>(She moves to her print kit and begins dusting the floor. She looks around. She stands up and carrying her print kit, moves to another portion of the living room.)</p>
<p>(She dusts the sides of the cabinet doors and moves along the wall. CATHERINE looks down at her hands. The shadow inside the cabinet moves. CATHERINE looks up.)</p>
<p>(The figure inside the cabinet bursts out and grabs CATHERINE. In a cloud of fingerprint dust, the two struggle. He pushes her along the living room. CATHERINE continues to struggle.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (yells) Suspect on location! Suspect on location!</p>
<p>(He pushes her up against the wall. CATHERINE continues to fight back against the intruder. She manages to knock the intruder across the head, releasing his hold on her. For all that she's worth, CATHERINE fights. The intruder knock's CATHERINE across the head and pushes her down. CATHERINE falls to the floor landing in the dead body's pool of blood.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: In here!</p>
<p>(The intruder runs out the back.)</p>
<p>(Two police officers with their weapons drawn enter the living room. WARRICK follows, his gun also draw.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Out back.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Catherine, are you all right?</p>
<p>(The two officers cautiously follow in the direction the intruder left. WARRICK lingers behind. He kneels next to CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: He went out back. (to WARRICK) I'm all right. I'm okay.</p>
<p>(WARRICK leaves CATHERINE and follows the officers.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE slowly gets up. Her hands covered with the victim's blood, her own blood spilling from the gash in her forehead.)</p>
<p>(In the background, we hear: <strong>Warrick</strong>: Talk to me! Anything? )</p>
<p>(WARRICK returns to the house, FIRST OFFICER CLARK behind him.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: He must have gotten out the back window.</p>
<p>(WARRICK turns around and holsters his gun. For a brief moment, he's silent and thoughtful. He looks up at FIRST OFFICER CLARK in front of him.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (angry) You the First Officer on the scene? </p>
<p>(The officer nods his head.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: When you clear a place you clear it, do you understand?</p>
<p>FIRST OFFICER CLARK: Yes, sir, I'm sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We lost a CSI two years ago because of the same mistake!</p>
<p>(Still on the floor, CATHERINE speaks up.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Warrick ... ease up. My fault. I sent him out.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (to the officer) Use your radio and call for backup.</p>
<p>(FIRST OFFICER CLARK turns away and pulls out his radio. WARRICK kneels down next to CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (softly) Hey ... </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey. </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Are you okay?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah. I'm all right.</p>
<p>(WARRICK reaches out a hand to get a better look at the cut on CATHERINE'S forehead. CATHERINE moves back a little.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Don't touch me. </p>
<p>(She holds out her bloodied hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm evidence.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. HOTEL - AUDITORIUM]</p>
<p>(SARA lifts some fibers off of the deceased and envelopes it. The body of the deceased is resting on the gurney, the rope is still around his neck. DAVID PHILLIPS waits to accompany the body back to the Lab for processing.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I got some fibers here. Possibly secondary. (NICK is walking back up to the stage. He's carrying a cord of rope.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: This rope was identical to the rope around the victim's neck. It's used as a hand rail. (DAVID PHILLIPS prepares to cut the rope loose. GRISSOM stops him.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Wait, David. Got a hair in the knot.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV to the knot and the single strand of hair tied with the rope. End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Killer's in the rope. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I want to preserve this as is, so cut higher.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Yes, sir.</p>
<p>(DAVID moves the knife up higher on the rope he was about to cut. He cuts the rope and the body falls back flat on the gurney. Camera lingers on the deceased's neck. GRISSOM uses his flashlight and looks up where the deceased was found.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. RESIDENCE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE puts on a pair of latex gloves.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, um, hand me a swab, would you? (WARRICK turns around holding the swab out for CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You know I could do this for you. CATHERINE: Not going to hurt any less.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE takes the swab. She stands in front of the mirror and takes a sample from her head wound. She groans with the effort. Behind her, WARRICK winces.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: That cut is deep.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE caps the swab tip and hands it to WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Damn.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE turns back to the open van doors searching for some privacy.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: All right, um, hey, uh, turn around.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Huh?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Privacy. </p>
<p>(WARRICK moves to the left side and turns his back to CATHERINE effectively blocking her from the driveway view. She starts to remove her clothing.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The guy bodied me full-on. I don't want trace to miss one hair or one fiber.</p>
<p>(WARRICK holds open the evidence bag while CATHERINE puts her clothes in it.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You decent? </p>
<p>(WARRICK turns around. The Coroner's office exits the home with the dead body on a gurney. They pass WARRICK and CATHERINE. WARRICK starts to put on his latex gloves while CATHERINE buttons up her work jumpsuit.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Looks like we're up.</p>
<p>(WARRICK and CATHERINE head back into the house to collect the evidence.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY ROOM -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The body is on the table. GRISSOM lifts the sheet covering the deceased's legs.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: These scars are old. Tell me this wasn't bone-lengthening surgery. ROBBINS: Probably done when he was a teenager. Surgical pins are inserted into the bone ... </p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV of the apparatus externally attached to the surgical pins inside the leg bones. Camera passes through the skin to the bone as the bones are broken and CGI fills in the bone growing back.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (V.O.) ... and linked to an external screw. Turn the screw, it cracks the bones. Osteogenic cells flood in.</p>
<p>(End of Quick CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Callus forms to bridge the gap. The fractures heal and the bone gets longer. You have to break the bones every four to six hours a quarter millimeter at a time. Excruciating pain ... for an extra few inches.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What people will endure to be normal. </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: &quot;What fools these mortals be.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: So ... </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hanging?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: At least. C.O.D. was asphyxiation due to strangulation. Give me a hand here. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM and ROBBINS lift up the body so that they can see the back. ROBBINS pushes the deceased's left ear up.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Bruise behind the ear is characteristic of a hanging.</p>
<p>(ROBBINS pushes the hair at the back of the head away.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: This bruise is not.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What is that, blunt force?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Take a look at this. </p>
<p>(ROBBINS and GRISSOM move to the X-ray viewbox.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Separation of the first and second vertebrae prior to death.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He was paralyzed?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: That's something that would only happen to a dwarf with pseudoachondroplasia. Physiology can make for cervical spine instability.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So it's possible that whoever did this knew something about dwarf anatomy.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV to someone hitting the back of someone else's neck. Cut to a close up of the skeletal frame breaking between the first and second vertebrae. End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(Both GRISSOM and ROBBINS turn to look back at the body on the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Hmmm ...</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. RESIDENCE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Back in the house, WARRICK examines the large blood stain left behind by the deceased. CATHERINE follows more slowly. WARRICK moves on to the kitchen area. CATHERINE walks past the large blood stain on the floor. CATHERINE looks up at the cabinets along the wall where the suspect hid.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to the suspect pushing CATHERINE up against the wall and the two struggling.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Suspect on location! (Flash to white. End of flashback. Resume back to CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: He was drinking. </p>
<p>(WARRICK watches CATHERINE while he puts on his gloves.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It was beer. <strong>Warrick</strong>: I'll go process the back. (CATHERINE nods her head. WARRICK leaves the room.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. RESIDENCE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(WARRICK kneels at the back outside gate and lifts a footprint off of the door.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to the suspect hitting the door and boosting himself over the gate. Cut to the suspect falling over the back and getting away. End of flashback. Resume back to WARRICK.)</p>
<p>(WARRICK takes the print and stands. He heads back into the house.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. RESIDENCE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE kneels in front of the living room cabinet door. She pulls off something and bags it. WARRICK enters.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Denim fiber from the cabinet. Could be nothing. And lots of smudges but no prints worthwhile.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, I didn't get any prints either but I did get a partial shoe tread from the back gate. And I don't think our dead guy lived here.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Based on ...?</p>
<p>(WARRICK stares at the photograph on the refrigerator door. He pulls takes one down and hands it to CATHERINE. She looks at it. It's a photograph of a black man and a light-skinned woman. Both are smiling.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: These pictures. Got Detective Wolf looking for the homeowner's name from the real estate records.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, our home invasion robbery may be not a home invasion after all.</p>
<p>(WARRICK nods.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. HOTEL &amp; CASINO - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and SARA stand next to the machine that MELANIE GRACE is playing. SARA puts on a pair of latex gloves.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So, would you mind if we tape-lifted your shirt? Combed your hair for evidence?</p>
<p><strong>Melanie Grace</strong>: Evidence of what?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, the first person at a crime scene often turns out to be a viable suspect. </p>
<p><strong>Melanie Grace</strong>: I'm the one the found his body. I'm the one that called it in. SARA: If you're innocent it'll, rule you out.</p>
<p>(MELANI GRACE considers this and shakes her head slightly. She may not like it, but she consents.)</p>
<p><strong>Melanie Grace</strong>: Go ahead.</p>
<p>(SARA digs into her kit to get her stuff out. MELANI GRACE continues to play the machine. She glances over at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Melanie Grace</strong>: Does he ever talk?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah. At, uh, random intervals.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I was admiring your reaching tool.</p>
<p><strong>Melanie Grace</strong>: I have one I use to wipe my tush with. Would you like to take a look at that, too?</p>
<p>(SARA smiles as she collects the samples.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hey, if the world doesn't adapt itself to you, you have to adapt yourself to it, right?</p>
<p><strong>Melanie Grace</strong>: Yeah. You know, you probably think I'm cold. Pulling slots after I found Lawrence up there. This is the convention. Everything moves at warp speed.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'm done. Thank you.</p>
<p>(MELANI GRACE gets up and off of her seat. She starts to leave then turns around.)</p>
<p><strong>Melanie Grace</strong>: You know, fifty-one weeks in your hometown with nothing but average-sized people. I have to fit a lifetime into this week. We all do. Business connections, gambling, romance.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Excuse me. Did Lawrence have any problems in those areas?</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Da Vinci's &quot;Vitruvian Man.&quot; In the perfect human form, arm span equals height. You're very aware of what, uh people are looking for in a mate aren't you?</p>

[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERROGATION ROOM -- DAY]</p>
<p><strong>Jessica Marcus</strong>: The night before he died, Lawrence and I had a fight about Danielle.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to LAWRENCE AMES in front of his laptop. Behind him is JESSICA MARCUS.)</p>
<p><strong>Jessica Marcus</strong>: Are still in contact with her?</p>
<p><strong>Lawrence Ames</strong>: She e-mails or IM's. I don't answer. I love you.</p>
<p>(JESSICA picks up the reaching tool from the table and throws it across the wall.)</p>
<p><strong>Jessica Marcus</strong>: You're cheating on me!</p>
<p>(The reaching tool hits the wall and the plastic tip breaks. End of flashback. Resume to NICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Jessica Marcus</strong>: And I ran out of the house and I went to my dad. I was crying and he told me to leave Lawrence but I couldn't because ... I ... I loved him. And I'm having our baby. And I went back to our room and we made up. </p>
<p>(Through her tears, JESSICA smiles at the memory.)</p>
<p><strong>Jessica Marcus</strong>: And the next night ... he said he was going out to meet a friend.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to LAWRENCE AMES dressed up and headed out the door. JESSICA MARCUS leans down and gives him a kiss.)</p>
<p><strong>Lawrence Ames</strong>: I'll be back in an hour, babe.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Jessica Marcus</strong>: And he never came back.</p>
<p>(NICK nods.)</p>
<p>INTERCUT TO:</p>

[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERROGATION ROOM -- DAY]</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, what'd you have against the guy?</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Marcus</strong>: What are you, blind? He was a dwarf. My wife and I ... Our daughter ... a Genetic Miracle. One-in-four shot she'd be an average. And she was a beautiful average. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So your wife is also a dwarf.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Marcus</strong>: Yeah. Jessica didn't have to fight the world every day, like we did. We freed her from all that. But that little b*st*rd kept dragging her right back down into it.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So you killed him.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Marcus</strong>: I said I didn't like the guy. I didn't kill anybody.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks grimly at BRASS, then back to KEVIN MARCUS. GRISSOM and BRASS leave the room. BRASS closes the door and takes a deep breath. He looks at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Can we prove it?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Not yet. The rope was anchored to the lighting truss which was at least five feet over his head.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So?</p>
<p>(Inside the room, KEVIN MARCUS gets off his chair and puts his jacket back on.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He can barely lift his arms above his shoulders. He suffers from Lumbar Lordosis Swayback ... which is typical of C.H.H. And it limits his mobility even more.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hey, the guy put a rope around the victim's neck.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, but how did he hang him?</p>

<p>(CATHERINE moves to open her passenger side door. DET. DREW WOLF leans into the open window stopping her.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. Drew Wolf</strong>: Listen, Catherine. Me and Warrick can handle this. (WARRICK glances at CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'm going in. <strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, the guy assaulted you. You don't have to put yourself through this, you know. CATHERINE: I don't, I'll be scared of the next guy and the one after that.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE shakes her head, no. She opens the car door and gets out of the car. WARRICK gets out of the car also.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. ALVIN JOHNSON'S FAST FOOD PLACE - DAY -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Shoe tread, denim fiber, a lot of cooking grease. Based on that evidence, they all did it.</p>
<p>(WARRICK closes the file folder he's carrying and walks back to the DETECTIVE and CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. Drew Wolf</strong>: All right, so we take them one by one.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Transfer works both ways.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE steps up toward the line of cooks behind the counter. She unzips her bag and hands a stack of evidence paper sacks to WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Warrick?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE also takes out a stack of clean tissue. She hands one to the YOUNG MAN standing first in line.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Blow your nose.</p>
<p><strong>Young Man</strong>: I don't gotta.</p>
<p>(The YOUNG MAN looks at CATHERINE. CATHERINE doesn't break eye contact. She tilts her head up and holds the tissue out. The YOUNG MAN takes the tissue and blows his nose.)</p>
<p>(WARRICK hands CATHERINE the open evidence sack. The YOUNG MAN hands the tissue back to CATHERINE. She glances at it and puts it in the sack and puts it on the counter. She moves on to the next man standing in line. She holds out a tissue for him.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Guess.</p>
<p>(The man takes the tissue and nods his head. He blows his nose and hands the tissue back to CATHERINE. She puts it in the evidence sack and moves to the third man standing in line.)</p>
<p>(She holds out the tissue for the man, DWAYNE GALLO. DWAYNE GALLO looks down at the tissue and doesn't move to take it.)</p>
<p><strong>Dwayne Gallo</strong>: I don't think so.</p>
<p>(He looks away.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Then I guess I'll just have to look for myself. (CATHERINE moves back to her kit.)</p>
<p><strong>Dwayne Gallo</strong>: You want to look at my boogers, Lady, go ahead.</p>
<p>(WARRICK looks up.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey! </p>
<p>(DWAYNE GALLO stares at WARRICK. CATHERINE gets the instrument from her kit. She examines DWAYNE GALLO'S nose.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Nose hairs ... are nature's filter. Traps all kinds of things. Dust, dirt ... </p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV of what CATHERINE sees. Attached to the inner nose hairs are colored powder particles. End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: ... fingerprint powder.</p>
<p>(DWAYNE GALLO exhales and pulls his head away from CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You did it.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to DWAYNE GALLO coming out of the cabinet and attacking CATHERINE. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You inhaled the fingerprint dust I was using.</p>
<p>(He begins to speak. CATHERINE takes a step back.)</p>
<p><strong>Dwayne Gallo</strong>: We went up there to party 'cause the boss was out of town and I saw the z-mover first </p>
<p>(DET. DREW WOLF sees CATHERINE take the step back and he moves in to apprehend DWAYNE GALLO. He pushes DWAYNE GALLO down against the counter and maneuvering his hands behind his back.)</p>
<p><strong>Dwayne Gallo</strong>: ... but Teddy ... Teddy ...</p>
<p>(Quick flashback as TEDDY HENDERS sees the box on the floor. He picks it up.)</p>
<p><strong>Teddy Henders</strong>: Sweet ... z-mover ...</p>
<p>(DWAYNE GALLO stands and grabs the box out of TEDDY HENDER'S hands.)</p>
<p><strong>Dwayne Gallo</strong>: I saw it first.</p>
<p><strong>Teddy Henders</strong>: What? ...</p>
<p>(DWAYNE GALLO pushes TEDDY HENDERS back. And like two children, they begin to fight over the box.)</p>
<p><strong>Dwayne Gallo</strong>: I saw it first. </p>
<p><strong>Teddy Henders</strong>: It's mine. </p>
<p><strong>Dwayne Gallo</strong>: I saw it first.</p>
<p><strong>Teddy Henders</strong>: I called it.</p>
<p><strong>Dwayne Gallo</strong>: You want it, you b*st*rd?!</p>

[INT. HOTEL - THEATRE -- DAY]</p>
<p>(NICK and SARA return to the crime scene to look for some answers. They slowly make their way up the stage to where the body was discovered.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, did you get anything else off that laptop?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No, a bunch of the files were corrupted. Archie's taking another run at them.</p>
<p>(NICK looks around the stage and out at the audience. He sighs. SARA walks to under the lighting. She looks up. NICK joins her.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Victim was paralyzed, couldn't fight back. Kevin Marcus puts the rope around his neck makes a slip knot.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: And ties off the other end on the truss even though there is no way he could have reached it.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No way he could've reached it.</p>
<p>(SARA turns her back and looks out at the empty audience seats. NICK sighs and takes off his jacket. He kneels down on the ground. SARA turns around and notices NICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Nick, what are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Changing my perspective.</p>
<p>(On his knees underneath the lighting, NICK looks up and tries to grab the lights above. An impossible feat.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (groans) Oh, man. Can you imagine going through life at this height?</p>
<p>(SARA doesn't hesitate.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: They do okay. If the world doesn't adapt itself to you, you ...</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: ... adapt yourself to it.</p>
<p>(NICK nods. He looks back up at the lighting above. Then it occurs to him.)</p>
<p>(Quick Perspective to the sound of the wheelchair's motor as the seat begins to rise. He imagines the rope being thrown over the truss. End of POV. Resume to present.)</p>

<p>(SARA and NICK approach GRISSOM from behind.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Grissom?</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: We know how he did it.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERROGATION ROOM -- DAY]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM puts something on the table. Presumably it's a sample of the fibers that BRASS is talking about.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Your wheelchair was in the booth at the convention. The fibers from the seat cover to your wheelchair match the fibers we found on the victim. Uh, faux, fake sheepskin.</p>
<p>(KEVIN MARCUS looks up at his lawyer sitting next to him.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We also know how you got Mr. Ames into the theater.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes the single sheet of paper out from his file and puts it on the table in front of them.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Our lab retrieved a final instant message to Lawrence from Danielle. </p>

<p><strong>Lawrence Ames</strong>: Mr. Marcus, what are you doing here? (End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: It's enough to convict you. GRISSOM: May I ask a question? How did you get him into the wheelchair? (KEVIN MARCUS laughs to himself.)</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Marcus</strong>: Well ... I appealed to his vanity. I told him I needed a brochure model to sell my new chair.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to the theatre. KEVIN MARCUS is seated in the wheelchair.)</p>
<p><strong>Lawrence Ames</strong>: You don't want me near your daughter but you want me to hawk your chairs?</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Marcus</strong>: I never said you weren't handsome. I mean, come on -- your face, your build -- a million chairs, &quot;sold.&quot;</p>
<p>(KEVIN MARCUS gets up and out of the chair. He urges LAWRENCE AMES into it.)</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Marcus</strong>: Great, come on. Hop in. Hop in, let me see you in there. Come on. Model for me. </p>
<p>(LAWRENCE AMES reluctantly sits down in the chair. Flash to white.)</p>

KEVIN MARCUS looks up in success.)</p>
<p>(End of Flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Marcus</strong>: I couldn't let Jessica marry him. (he shakes his head) Any kid they have ... a fifty percent chance it would be a dwarf. You have to understand that.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at BRASS. Disbelief written all over his face.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's genetics.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Mr. Marcus, I think you should know ... your daughter is already pregnant by Lawrence Ames.</p>
<p>(KEVIN MARCUS looks from BRASS to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
SCENE #37</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You know what's really sad? This wasn't just a murder. It was a hate crime. </p>

<p><strong>Signing Student (female)</strong>: (spoken) Dr. Grissom, welcome back. GRISSOM: (signing) It's nice to see you.</p>
<p><strong>Signing Student (female)</strong>: (signing) Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (signing) I'm taking a class in lip-reading. (or as GRISSOM says it, &quot;speech&quot; reading.)</p>
<p><strong>Signing Student (female)</strong>: (signing) I think I should tell the teacher that you're a trouble-maker.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (signing, laughing and shaking his head) No. See you around.</p>
<p><strong>Signing Student (female)</strong>: (signing and spoken) Take care of yourself.</p>
<p>(The Signing Student pats him on his shoulder and leaves. GRISSOM smiles. He sticks his hands in his jacket pocket and takes a deep breath. He settles back against the column he's leaning against. The camera slowly pans away.)</p>

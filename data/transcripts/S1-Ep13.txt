Dominic Kretzker: Hi, Renee.
Renee: Hi.
Dominic Kretzker: Good afternoon, Mr. Ribero. How's the golf?
Mr. Ribero: Fine. How are you? 

Dominic Kretzker: Hi. You look lost.

Dominic Kretzker: Okay, the stairs are all the way back to the left and the Real Estate Office is at the end of the hall.

Dominic Kretzker: Okay? Bye.

Dominic Kretzker: Hello. Oh! Those for me?
Nicole: Hi, Dominic. Sign here.
Dominic Kretzker: Okay.  I'll tell you, though this is going to be worth a lot of money someday.

Nicole: I know, Elvis.
Dominic: Okay.
Nicole: See you.
Dominic: Okay, bye-bye.

Jake Richards: Domino, it's your turn to pick up dinner.
Dominic: Okay, Jake-O. Listen, uh, this goes to Cooley Real Estate.  I'll be back in ... hmm, about ten minutes, all right?
Jake Richards: You got it.
Dominic Kretzker: All right, buddy.

Catherine: Oh, these fire guys really know how to trash a crime scene.
Grissom: That's what they do. Put wet stuff on the red stuff.

Brass: We're all clear to go in, but here's what we got. Couple of head wounds. Elderly guy had his arm torn off. The only fatality so far is Jake Richards, a security guard. Body's still inside.


Brass: How big you think this bomb was?
Catherine: It's not the size of the bomb. It's the overpressure in the air around it.

Grissom: The Van Gogh effect. In stereo. Both ears gone.
Catherine: A perfectly symmetrical amputation. Means he was looking directly at the bomb when it went off.
Grissom: So either it drew his attention or it was contained in something that seemed benign.

Grissom:  Smell the sulfur?
Catherine: Uh-huh. 
Grissom: Got your lighter, Jim?
Brass: Sure.

Grissom:  Light this.

Catherine: Gunpowder.
Grissom: Well, we know the propellant. So would you care to make a preliminary call on this?
Catherine: I'd love to.

Catherine: Seat of the bomb is here. Victim was thrown ... three meters. His clothes are torn but not burnt, indicating a low-velocity propellant -- 6,000-
7,000 feet per second. Who? Why? Will he do it again? 
 
Catherine: Time will tell.
HARD CUT TO: END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS


FADE IN.


 

Grissom: The dirty little secret of bombs is how easy they are to make and use. 

Grissom:  Our murder weapon's here someplace in a thousand pieces. 

Grissom:  We have to find it and put it back together again.
Warrick: Where do we start?
Grissom: If it's not growing pick it up. We cart everything we find back to the lab.
Sara: And then what?
Grissom: Stay curious.

Sara: Can you fill in the blanks?
Catherine: Bombs explode. Weird thing is their components survive the explosion. If we can piece together this bomb, we're closer to finding who did this. So, Warrick, when you're photographing this debris can you, uh ... ?
Warrick: Uh, I know -- looky-loos.

WHITE FLASH TO:



 
Eric: Come on, Nick. It's my last night in Sin City. One more drink, man.
Nick: Oh, no. I just pulled a double and I still have to file my shift report.

Eric: Hey, you're off the clock. You'd have never passed up a wild night back at A&amp;M.
Nick: Well, I guess I grew up.
Eric: Too bad. Check that out.

Nick: Enjoy.

Eric: You must really love your job, man. 

Eric: Ladies ...

Nick: Here you go. Thanks, man.
Valet: Thank you.

Kristy Hopkins:  Get your hands off me! Let go of me. You don't own me. Nobody does.
Jack Willman:  You're not going anywhere. You got that? 

Jack Willman: Come on. Relax a little bit. Settle down.

Nick: Kristy? 
Kristy Hopkins: You don't own me, Jack. 

Nick: Kristy!
Kristy Hopkins: Nobody does.
Jack Willman: I know, I know.

Nick: Hey. Back off.
Jack: Hey, just mind your own business.
Kristy Hopkins:  Nick. 

Kristy Hopkins:  I know him. He's a cop.
Nick:  Crime scene investigator.
Kristy Hopkins: Nick, tell him to leave me alone.
Jack Willman: Nobody tells me to do anything.
Nick: Hey, we going to have a problem?
Jack Willman: No, officer, we're not going to have a problem. See you around, baby.

Nick: You okay?
Kristy Hopkins: Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. That was good timing. Thanks.
Nick: I suppose you need a ride.
Kristy Hopkins: Do you mind?
Nick: No. Come on.
Kristy Hopkins: Thanks.
CUT TO:



Kristy Hopkins: Seems like every time we run into each other I'm getting into trouble.
Nick: Not that it's any of my business but maybe you should think about changing careers.
Kristy Hopkins: Not every john is like that guy. Besides, I'm making a change. I'm going back to school.

Nick: Yeah?
Kristy Hopkins: I've always wanted to study communications. I'm good with people.
Nick: That's good.
Kristy Hopkins: You think so?
Nick: Yeah. Yeah.
Kristy Hopkins: Well, I'm going to go inside now. 
Unless, of course, you'd like to come in for a drink.
Nick: I don't think that'd be a good idea.
Kristy Hopkins: Come on. Just 'cause you're a crime scene analyst you don't have to analyze everything.

Catherine: F - P - 

Dominic Kretzker: Mr. Grissom.

Dominic Kretzker: Oh, uh ... hi, I've ... I've, um, I've seen you on tv before. I admire your work.
Grissom: Well, thank you. And your name is ... ?
Dominic Kretzker: Dominic. Uh, &quot;I-C&quot; rather than with the &quot;I-C-K&quot;... uh, Kretzker. I'm the, uh, Hansen Building Security Detail.
Grissom: Did somebody from homicide talk to you yet?
Dominic Kretzker: Yeah. As a matter of fact, they said that I was going to be talking to you, because, well, we are ... you know, we're both in law enforcement, and ...
Grissom: Right. Did you know the victim -- the other security guard?
Dominic Kretzker: Oh, yeah. He was one of my best buddies. As a matter of fact, you know, two minutes' difference it would've been my face all over the news instead of his, right?

Grissom: Would you, uh, like to be on the news?
Dominic Kretzker: Yeah. Yeah. I mean ... only if I could help people, yes. No, no. I know what you're thinking. Uh, you know, my building blows up I'm over at Arby's sucking down some extra sauce. You know, how could I want to help people, right?
Grissom: Well, I mean, realistically, what could you have done?
Dominic Kretzker: Well, I know a lot about bombs. You know, pipe, power, powder. The three &quot;Ps&quot; of mass destruction.
Grissom: Huh. Dominic ... with an &quot;I-C,&quot; not &quot;I-C-K&quot; ...
Dominic Kretzker: Yes sir?
Grissom: Would you be interested in helping me in my investigation?

Dominic Kretzker: Are you serious?  Yeah. Yes, sir. I'd be honored, sir. Oh. But we can't tell anybody on the day shift, though because they're going to get real jealous.
Grissom: That's good thinking. Would you excuse me a minute?
Dominic Kretzker: Yes.

Grissom:  Keep an eye on that guy.

Dominic Kretzker: Oh, yes!
CUT TO:



Grissom: Well, we got a live one out there. I got a cop baby-sitting him. How you doing?
Catherine: Well, are his initials &quot;F.P.&quot;?
Grissom: No. Dominic Kretzker. Why?
Catherine: I found this near the point of origin.

Catherine: Whoever did this is playing with us.
Grissom: Or he wants to get caught.

FADE TO BLACK.





Nick: Hey, it's me. You in the shower? What are you doing? Anyway, if you check your messages I don't have to work till later. So I thought, since you're between careers you might want to grab a late ... 

Nick: ... breakfast.

Officer Arvington: Hey, Nick, what's up?
Nick: Not a lot. What's ... what's going on?
Officer Arvington: It's a 419. Dead prostitute.
Nick: Who's the decedent? 
Officer Arvington: Kristine Marie Hopkins. Day shift's got it covered. You all right?

Nick: Yeah, I must've, uh ... I must've got my wires crossed. I'll see you.
Officer Arvington: All right, man.

CUT TO:

 

Dominic Kretzker: All right, you cram this thing here with gunpowder, all right? Then you cap it here, and you cap it here. Now the grains inside, all right ... they're going to ignite and cause smoke. Lots and lots of smoke ... now, the problem is, all that smoke's here man it's got nowhere to go. Okay? It starts cooking ... and then ... bob's your uncle... boom!
Warrick: Grissom was right: You do know a lot about bombs.
Brass: How did you learn so much?
Dominic Kretzker: Oh, they don't teach this stuff at universities. No, this is all trial and error.
Brass: So what, you just, uh, blow up bombs and study them?
Dominic Kretzker: Yeah. Yeah...

Margaret Finn: Margaret Finn, Public Defender. Cease and desist any conversation with my client. I've been assigned to you. Guess the PD was thinking of all the lawsuits Richard Jewell brought when he was wrongfully accused.
Brass: Someone died in that office building.
Dominic Kretzker: Ma'am, you seem like a very nice person but these people-- they've been very, very good to me.
Margaret Finn: I'm sure they have.
Warrick: Dominic, I think you should go with your attorney. Thanks for your help, though.

Dominic Kretzker: All right I'll see you guys later.

Dominic Kretzker: Listen, do me a favor. Will you tell Grissom that, if he needs me just call me at home, okay? 
Brass: All right. 

Dominic Kretzker: Let's roll.

CUT TO:

 

Sara: So all this stuff is from a five-meter radius of the point of origin?
Catherine: Yep.
Sara: How could the victim possibly have been in one piece?
Catherine: Vacuum effect. The air is being pushed out so fast ...

Catherine:  ... when the bomb detonates ... 

Catherine:  ... there's a calm at the center.



Sara: Calm, huh?
Catherine: Well, except for when he lost his ears.
Sara: Did you figure out what this &quot;FP&quot; stands for?
Catherine: I ran it through ATF's bomb database. No profile.
Sara: So our bomber's a newbie. Does he fit Grissom's wack job from the bomb site?
Catherine: Dominic the security guard? It's too soon to tell.

Grissom: I found something interesting.
Sara: What is it?

Catherine: Looks like a balance wheel from a clock.
Grissom: Bomb was time-delayed. This is a piece of the timing device.
Sara: What about the orange stuff?
Grissom: Heat of the explosion must have melted whatever it is all around the wheel. So, Sara?
Sara: Mmm?
Grissom: What's orange and melts?
Sara: I would have to investigate that.
Grissom: Thank you.

Nick: Hey, guys.  Can I steal you for a minute?
Grissom: I thought this was your day off.
Catherine: We're kind of busy here, Nick.
Nick: Yeah, I know, and I'm sorry, but I don't think this can wait.
Grissom: Okay.

CUT TO:

 

Grissom: You told me you weren't dating her.
Nick: I wasn't till last night after I broke up her fight with this guy, uh ... Jack.
Grissom: And Ecklie's at her house now.
Nick: Yeah, and I can tell you what he's going to find. My fingerprints; my DNA.
Grissom: What were you thinking, Nicky?
Nick: I wasn't.

Nick:  We had a connection, you know? A chemistry thing, I guess.

Nick:  She was irresistible, man.

Nick: I took off around four.
Grissom: Ecklie's going to be all over this.

Catherine: Hey, Nick ... I'm sorry to hear about your friend.

Nick: Who told you?
Catherine: Word travels. It was the day shift coroner.
Nick: So people know I was with Kristy last night?
Catherine: Not yet.
Nick: Maybe I should just go to Ecklie and tell him I was there.
Grissom: When you're a suspect and you're innocent, keep your mouth shut. I'll talk to Ecklie.
Catherine: Bad idea. You and Ecklie ... oil and water. Just let me get into it.

Nick: I can't just sit here.
Grissom: Okay, go for a walk. Maybe you'll accidentally bump into your guy, &quot;Jack?&quot;
Nick: Yeah.

Grissom: I.D. him, but don't approach him.

Nick: Okay.

Catherine: If Nick's arrested. it's not going to matter that he's cleared later.

Grissom: No. It's an automatic dismissal.

CUT TO:



Dr. Albert Robbins: 25-year-old female caucasian. Liver temp's indicating time of death at 0600. Petichial hemorrhaging, cyanotic tongue. Can I help you, Catherine?

CATHEIRNE; I just want to see the body, David.
Dr. Albert Robbins: Unless I'm mistaken, this is Ecklie's case.
Catherine: Eyes, no hands.

Catherine: Look at those ligature marks.
Dr. Robbins: Petichials ... blue tongue, the works.
Catherine: Raccoon eyes excoriation around the neck. She didn't give up easy.
Dr. Albert Robbins: Struggled and strangled.
Catherine: Ecklie find the murder weapon?
Dr. Albert Robbins: I only deal with bodies.
Catherine: Did you check for fingerprints on the body?
Dr. Albert Robbins: Not yet.
Catherine: Half-life of fingerprints on flesh ... they're disappearing as we speak.
Dr. Albert Robbins: Catherine, I like Nick, too. I know you're here for him. But what if I lift his prints from her?
Catherine: Then that's what you report. Evidence, Doc ...  ... all we got.

[SCOPE VIEW of the piece GRISSOM found earlier. He compares the damaged piece with a second in-tact piece.)
 
SARA; Hey.

Grissom: Could you find that and turn it off, please?

SARA; Find the clock our guy used?
Grissom:  Not yet.
Sara: This is a good choice. According to the bomb data center which has a record of every component used in any bomb -- from Ted Kaczynski to teenage boys playing with fireworks -- the most recent timing device of choice is made by TimeTell SnoozeWell, $10.99 at any local drugstore.

Grissom: You spoiled all my fun.

Warrick: Gris, can I get clear on something here?
Grissom: Anything's possible.
Warrick: Catherine gave me this &quot;FP&quot; which was part of the Hansen bomb and I'm supposed to figure out what tool the bomber used to engrave it.
Grissom: You isolate the tool, and then we trace it.
Warrick: Yeah, but he could've used any number of things to initial it. I mean, screwdriver, a drill bit, a box cutter.
Grissom: It's the same as guns -- we eliminate them one at a time.
Warrick: What are you guys doing?
Sara:  We're going to go blow up some bombs.
Warrick:  Oh, I definitely got the wrong end of this investigation.
Grissom:  Alas, poor Warrick.

CUT TO: 

 
 
Catherine: Oh, hey, uh Conrad, Grissom's in the field.
Conrad Ecklie: I need to speak with him.
Catherine: And I need to speak with you ... about Nick Stokes.
Conrad Ecklie: Well, let me guess ... about his involvement with a dead hooker?
Catherine: Come on. The hooker was a person. Her name was Kristy Hopkins.
Conrad Ecklie: I realize that. Thank you. I just came from the lab. His prints were all over Kristy Hopkins' house. Let's see, wine glass ... oh, bedside table.

Nick: How's it going, Cath?
Catherine: Nick, I don't think that you guys should be talking.
Nick: It's no big deal. What's up, Ecklie?
Conrad Ecklie: I need a DNA sample from you, Nick.
Nick: I assume you're trying to prove Kristy Hopkins and I were sexually active last night.
Conrad Ecklie: We found a condom, used.
Nick: And my DNA will match, no warrant necessary. And I have something else for you. 

Nick: I got this off a valet surveillance tape.
Conrad Ecklie: A license plate number? Vehicle belongs to Jack Willman. Had a fight with Kristy Hopkins outside the Orpheus last night around midnight.
Conrad Ecklie: Well, I'll look into it but come on -- your fingerprints, your DNA --that's what's going into evidence.
Nick: You just love that, don't you?
Conrad Ecklie: You think I want to believe that a CSI could commit murder? Hell, I don't even want to believe that a CSI could sleep with a hooker.
Catherine: You know what? Nick's private life ...
Conrad Ecklie:  Catherine, I'm sorry if you guys don't like where the evidence is pointing. But show me otherwise -- tell me I'm wrong. In the meantime, my hands are tied. I have protocol to follow.

Nick: I hate that guy.
Catherine: Okay, look, I'm going to get O'Riley to track down this Jack guy for questioning. But I am out on a limb for you here, Nick. Just don't make it harder with Ecklie, okay?
Nick:  Yeah.

CUT TO:



Grissom: We find the bomber by understanding the bomb. Fortunately, Catherine figured out the exterior container.
Sara: Aluminum briefcase.

Grissom: And we know the timing device.
Sara: Snoozewell.
Grissom: And the propellant.
Sara: Black gunpowder.
Grissom: So the final piece of the bomber's signature?
Sara: Identify the pipe containing the powder.
Grissom: Three bombs, scaled down five-to-one three different metal pipes. Different metals fly different distances when the same force is applied. Number one is a plumber's ex-flow pipe. Number two is an inflow pipe which is thinner. Number three is galvanized steel which is the thinnest metal of them all.

Sara: You ready?
Grissom:  Mm-hmm.
Sara: Let's do it, Dan.


Grissom: Green. That's the ex-flow pipe.

Grissom: Inflow pipe, blue.

Grissom: Red-- the galvanized steel.

Grissom: Last piece of green: Ten feet.

Grissom: Blue: 16 feet.

Grissom: Red: 20 feet.

Sara: Fragments from the galvanized steel traveled the farthest.
Grissom: 20 feet. Extrapolating five to one that would be 100 feet.
Sara: That's the outer limit of visible metal detritus at the Hansen building.
Grissom: So the bomb was housed in a thin container of galvanized steel -- like a muffler or a tailpipe. I've seen it before. It's a common container for homemades.
Brass: Don't you love the smell of sulfur in the afternoon? You might want to go and take a tour of Dominic Kretzker's house. I tracked down the sale of SnoozeWell clocks. Nine hundred twenty-six credit card purchases in the last three months in Clark County -- seven to Dominic Kretzker of Prairie Road.

Dispatcher:  15, cal 24 is your backup.

Dominic Kretzker: Hey, hey. 
Brass: That your scanner?
Dominic Kretzker: Yeah, that's how I knew you were coming. Makes me feel like I'm part of things. 

Dominic Kretzker: Mr. Grissom. What can I do for you guys?
Grissom: Dominic ... this is the type of device that was used to set off the Hansen bomb. We have proof that you purchased the same make of clock.
Dominic Kretzker: Yeah. Yeah, I recognize that. That houses a nice little detonator.
Brass: Want to show us that clock of yours?
Dominic Kretzker:  Why, sure. Come on in. 


Dominic Kretzker: The place is kind of a mess. Sorry.

Dominic Kretzker: Here.

Dominic Kretzker: Here it is.

Dominic Kretzker: Timetell Snoozewell. $10.99. Well, you can get it for half price if you got a coupon.

Grissom: The timing device is still intact.
Dominic Kretzker: Yeah, 'cause I haven't made the bomb yet.
Grissom: But you have made bombs before using parts from this make?
Dominic Kretzker: Well, yeah. Yeah. I blow them out in back all the time. I blasted a few of them a couple months ago.
Brass: Look what I found. Sulfur. You blow up any bombs recently?

Grissom: Is this from the Hansen bomb?
Dominic Kretzker: Sure is.
Brass: You keep your key piece of evidence that could nail you?
Dominic Kretzker: Hey, that's sentimental.
Brass: Well, that's cute.
Dominic Kretzker: No. I mean, it is. That's like, you know, Waco and Trade Center. That's historical. I didn't have a war, all right? I'm too flatfooted for the P.D. And that's as close to history as I'm going to get. I collect souvenirs. I mean, th-that's my building, you know. I mean ... that was my place of employment, man.

Margaret Finn: You're going to be sorry, talking to my client.
Brass: We called you. We left word.
Margaret Finn: Dominic, don't speak.
Dominic Kretzker: If I had anything to hide, I'd hide it. I'm pretty proud of that container piece, I'll tell you.
Brass: Well, maybe so but you're under arrest. Put him in the car.
Dominic Kretzker:  You-you kidding? Oh.

Dominic Kretzker:  Cuffs?
Brass: Well, vultures never sleep, huh?

Dominic Kretzker:  Could you do me a favor? Will you put the jacket over them? I don't want to be seen like this. Especially on TV. This is not who I am. 

Dominic Kretzker: Thanks, Partner.

Grissom:  I can't tell whether he's brilliant or... nuts.
Brass: Sound familiar? Tell you one thing: If he's guilty, he's putting on one hell of a show.

Grissom: I think the evidence raises some serious questions about your involvement.
Dominic Kretzker: That is crazy. I mean, come on. I'm one of the good guys. I know the cops went through my things. Did they find anything?
Grissom: Dominic, you have an attorney now. I can't really talk to you about your case. I was here on another matter and I thought I'd come by.
Dominic Kretzker: You do what I do.
Grissom: Excuse me?

Sara: Anybody report hearing any noise? Ticking?
Brass: No. No one heard anything.
Sara: Oh. It's not the firemen -- it's the rain. This crime scene is trashed.

Sara: What do you have?
Grissom: Form follows function. They've never been able to make a better one. Mousetrap.
Sara: That orange stuff again.
Grissom: Someone picks it up motion trips the trap, sets off the timer.

Sara:  Which sets off the bomb.



Sara: Be right back.

Grissom: We say nothing to the media or anybody. Our bomber's signature just got a little more sophisticated.

Sara: Excuse me. Hi. I'm with the crime lab. I'm sorry, but I have to take your jacket.

Grissom: I can't discuss it.
Dominic Kretzker: So I guess you're not going to be needing my expertise anymore. I mean, investigation-wise.  I knew it was too good to be true. 

Dominic Kretzker: Well, proud to have worked with you, sir.
Grissom: Dominic ... I'm not a police officer. I-I-I'm a Crime Scene Analyst.

Grissom: Good luck. Take care of yourself.

Det. O'Riley: How would you characterize your relationship with Kristy Hopkins?
Jack: Sir, we can just cut the crap. I saw him kill Kristy. I saw everything.
Det. O'Riley: Go on.
Jack: Well, Kristy and I, we had words. I was just swinging by her place to tell her I was sorry, but, uh ...

Jack Willman:  I didn't expect to see her with a guy. 

Jack Willman:  They were fighting. I couldn't make out what they were saying but he was pushing her around pretty hard.


Det. O'Riley: Could you I.D. this guy? 
Jack Willman: It was, like, Nick something. Kristy and I bumped into him at the Orpheus earlier.
Det. O'Riley: And you saw him kill her?
Jack: Well, I saw him get violent, and I took off.
Det. O'Riley: And you didn't try to help the girl?
Jack: He's one of you guys. He carries a gun. I'm no hero. So, could I go?

Det. O'Riley: Yeah.
 

Conrad Ecklie: The witness sounds believable.
Catherine: It's a load of crap, and you know it.

Sheriff Brian Mobley: I was listening. He seemed credible to me.
Catherine: Sheriff, you arrest Nick now you end his career.
Sheriff Brian Mobley: So, what can you offer me?
Catherine: Nothing, except my gut and ten years of experience. He didn't do this.
Conrad Ecklie: Ignore the evidence against Stokes it looks like special favors for CSI.
Sheriff Brian Mobley: Well, I can't have that. Not and keep my post.
Catherine: So give me twelve hours, access to the crime scene and evidence without filing papers on Nick.
Sheriff Brian Mobley: Twelve hours. But then we arrest Mr. Stokes with all the attendant documentation.

FADE TO BLACK.

Catherine:  How you doing, Greg?
Greg Sanders: Same as you. Worried about Nick.
Catherine: Yeah. I need to see his DNA from the crime scene. You have it, right?
Greg Sanders: A sample from the condom, yeah. Popsicled in the freezer. But, uh, it's not your case. Much as I want to help, no can do.

Greg Sanders: I would never doubt your word.
Catherine: Smart man.

Greg Sanders: Nick's little soldiers. It's all you.

Catherine: It takes about seven hours for bacteria to eat away at the tails placing the time of ejaculation at around 2:00 A.M. But Kristy's time of death was 6:00 A.M.
Grissom: Well, it suggests a lag between ejaculation and Kristy's murder but it doesn't disprove Nick's presence at the time of the homicide.
Catherine: You could be a little more supportive.

Sara: I have a new favorite color.
Grissom: Orange?
Sara: The orange polyester from the bomb is a match to the thrift-right jacket. Guess where their regional headquarters is located. 
Grissom: The Hansen Building.
Sara: You bet. I ran a Lexis search looking for disgruntled employees, irate customers anyone with a grievance against thrift-right.
Grissom: You get any hits? 
Sara: Norman Stirling -- former manager.
Grissom: How disgruntled?
Sara: Let go last year. Caused a commotion at HQ. Filed lawsuits against the company. Guy's been out of work ever since.

Grissom: Sitting around making bombs.
CUT TO:



Brass: Norman Stirling?
Norman Stirling: Yes. What's going on?
Sara: &quot;FP.&quot;
Norman Stirling: What?
Sara: You don't recognize those initials?

Norman Stirling: What's this about?
Brass: The bombing of the thrift-right car rental and the bombing of the Hansen Building.
Norman Stirling: A-a bomb? Are you kidding? I've never even been near a bomb my entire life.
Sara: Well, those orange jackets over there appear to match the materials the bombs were wrapped in.
Norman Stirling: I used to wear those to go to work.
Brass: You were let go by ThriftRright last year, and lost a court battle to get your job back. In fact, they filed a TRO against you for throwing furniture around their headquarters last July.
Norman Stirling: I want to call my lawyer.
Brass: Good. You can call him from the car. He can meet us at the PD. Take him in. Come on, let's go.

Norman Stirling:  Call your mom.

Catherine:  Kristy Hopkins was strangled with this sash. 

Catherine: It's fingerprint-free, but the force of the pull would have scratched off epithelials from the killer's hands, right?
Greg Sanders: Abraded, yeah.
Catherine: And can you extract DNA from epithelials?
Greg Sanders: If they're fresh enough.


Greg Sanders: Okay, epithelials are an affirmative. And they're good to go for DNA profiling. I'm just going to need something to compare it to.
Catherine: Jack Willman has a prior for a sexual assault so his DNA is on file.

CUT TO:



Nick: Well?
Catherine: I think that you and I should head over to the police station.
Nick:  DNA didn't pan out, huh?
Catherine:  Never have I seen such a clean match. Jack Willman killed her.




Nick:  Thank you. 
 
Catherine: Hey ... hey, I'm just doing my job. Besides, if they'd sent you to jail I'd get stuck with all your cases.

CUT TO:



Grissom: Dispatch said you were looking for me?
Warrick: Yeah. I finally matched this &quot;FP.&quot; To this electric etcher. Now, I made an exemplar. Boom! Identical type of striations. The manufacturer says that this etcher is only used for training purposes. And it's only sold in bulk. It was not sold to Norman Stirling.
Grissom: So who bought it?
Warrick: Las Vegas School District. I called the district, and we traced it down to one high school -- summit high. 

Warrick: Stirling's son goes there.

CUT TO:



Brass: Tyler, were you aware of your father's lawsuits against thrift-right car rental?
Tyler Stirling: It was kind of hard not to be. I mean, it's all him and my mom talked about for a year. Until she left.
Grissom: Do you miss your mother?
Tyler Stirling: I miss our old life.
Norman Stirling:  Is there something that we should be talking about? You know, in private?
Tyler Stirling: You said that's how corporations do it-- in private. See, they treated him great at work, in front of everyone. And then they let him go at the end of the day when no one's around. Thirty years of service, and then ... you know, they realized they could hire two young guys at half the price.
Brass: What does &quot;FP&quot; stand for? It was etched into both bombs. 
Grissom: We think you engraved it with an implement from your high school shop class.

Tyler Stirling: &quot;Fair play.&quot;

Norman Stirling: I used to yell that around the house -- that I was owed fair play.
Tyler Stirling: I mean, they threw him out like trash.
Norman Stirling: And you sent them bombs?!
Tyler Stirling: You said you wanted to kill them.
Norman Stirling: How did you even know how to do this?
Tyler Stirling: Off the internet. 

Tyler Stirling: Dad, are you mad at me? I did it for you.
Grissom: Tyler, did you make any more bombs? Where are they? Where are you keeping them?
Norman Stirling: Tyler ... if you did this for me ... please tell them where they are.
CUT TO:

Nick: Hi. Just the guy I wanted to see.

Catherine: O'Riley.

Nick: Tell me why you did it.
Jack Willman: I got nothing to say to you, cowboy.

Nick: She was going back to college, turning her life around getting out of the business, and you killed her for it! Why?
Jack Willman: Is that what she told you? She was getting out of the business? She was going to college to recruit more girls.
Nick: Do you think I'm going to believe the John that killed her?
Jack Willman: Oh, you think I was her client? I was her pimp. She was leaving me to start her own racket. So wake up. This isn't pretty woman. She's not Julia Roberts. You're not Richard Gere.

Nick: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I guess you're right. Because there's no happy ending for you. Twenty-five to life.
Catherine: Get him out of here.

Grissom:  Above the fold.

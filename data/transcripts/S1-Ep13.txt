[INT. HANSEN BUSINESS BUILDING -- SUNSET]</p>
<p>(DOMINIC KRETZKER walks down the stairs and greets the employees as they walk up to the second floor.)</p>
<p><strong>Dominic Kretzker</strong>: Hi, Renee.</p>
<p><strong>Renee</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>Dominic Kretzker</strong>: Good afternoon, Mr. Ribero. How's the golf?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Ribero</strong>: Fine. How are you? </p>
<p>(DOMINIC reaches the first floor and stops to help a woman.)</p>
<p><strong>Dominic Kretzker</strong>: Hi. You look lost.</p>
<p>(He looks at the piece of paper she's carrying and points her in the right direction.)</p>
<p><strong>Dominic Kretzker</strong>: Okay, the stairs are all the way back to the left and the Real Estate Office is at the end of the hall.</p>
<p>(The woman looks at him and nods.)</p>
<p><strong>Dominic Kretzker</strong>: Okay? Bye.</p>
<p>(DOMINIC stands in the middle of the lobby and sees NICOLE walk in carrying a large vase of flowers.)</p>
<p><strong>Dominic Kretzker</strong>: Hello. Oh! Those for me?</p>
<p><strong>Nicole</strong>: Hi, Dominic. Sign here.</p>
<p><strong>Dominic Kretzker</strong>: Okay. (he signs.) I'll tell you, though this is going to be worth a lot of money someday.</p>
<p>(He hands her back her pad. She hands him the flowers.)</p>
<p><strong>Nicole</strong>: I know, Elvis.</p>
<p><strong>Dominic</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Nicole</strong>: See you.</p>
<p><strong>Dominic</strong>: Okay, bye-bye.</p>
<p>(NICOLE leaves; JAKE RICHARDS walks up to DOMINIC.)</p>
<p><strong>Jake Richards</strong>: Domino, it's your turn to pick up dinner.</p>
<p><strong>Dominic</strong>: Okay, Jake-O. Listen, uh, this goes to Cooley Real Estate. (JAKE takes the flowers.) That's on two, all right? And the Fed Ex is running a little bit late on the pickup. (DOMINIC glances down at his watch.) I'll be back in ... hmm, about ten minutes, all right?</p>
<p><strong>Jake Richards</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p><strong>Dominic Kretzker</strong>: All right, buddy.</p>
<p>(DOMINIC leaves. JAKE takes the flowers and puts it on the counter. He glances up at the wall clock which reads 6:02. He then glances down and notices a ticking sound.)</p>
<p>(He looks over at the stack of boxes and things on the counter. He finally peers around the side of the counter and sees the briefcase sitting on the floor. The ticking sound comes from the briefcase.)</p>
<p>(Camera goes into slow motion. JAKE RICHARDS reaches for the briefcase. Everything and everyone slows down to a complete and silent halt.)</p>
<p>(It explodes.)</p>
<p>(JAKE is flung up and backwards as fire and smoke takes out a good portion of the lobby.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. HANSEN BUSINESS BUILDING -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and CATHERINE walk through the police vehicles and activity outside as they make their way to the crime scene.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, these fire guys really know how to trash a crime scene.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's what they do. Put wet stuff on the red stuff.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and CATHERINE meet up with BRASS in the front of what used to be the doors to the building. BRASS fills them in.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We're all clear to go in, but here's what we got. Couple of head wounds. Elderly guy had his arm torn off. The only fatality so far is Jake Richards, a security guard. Body's still inside.</p>
<p>[INT. HANSEN BUILDING - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and CATHERINE turn their flashlights on as they walk through the lobby. BRASS stands aside and looks around.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: How big you think this bomb was?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It's not the size of the bomb. It's the overpressure in the air around it.</p>
<p>(They make their way toward the body. BRASS reaches it first and kneels down beside it. GRISSOM and CATHERINE both put their kits down as they look at the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The Van Gogh effect. In stereo. Both ears gone.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: A perfectly symmetrical amputation. Means he was looking directly at the bomb when it went off.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So either it drew his attention or it was contained in something that seemed benign.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM continues to look at the body. CATHERINE looks up and around.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (sniffs) Smell the sulfur?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Uh-huh. [translation: yes]</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Got your lighter, Jim?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes a small sample scraping of the black stuff on the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to BRASS) Light this.</p>
<p>(The black powder on the knife explodes.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Gunpowder.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, we know the propellant. So would you care to make a preliminary call on this?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'd love to.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE stands up and moves to where the suitcase was on the floor indicated by the markings.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Seat of the bomb is here. Victim was thrown ... three meters. His clothes are torn but not burnt, indicating a low-velocity propellant -- 6,000-<br />
7,000 feet per second. Who? Why? Will he do it again? </p>
<p>(She shrugs.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Time will tell.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO: END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<hr />
[EXT./INT. HANSEN BUILDING - PARKING LOT -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Sirens wail in the background as emergency personnel continue to assist and sort through the damage.) </p>
<p>(Inside, GRISSOM looks around the floor among the debris.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The dirty little secret of bombs is how easy they are to make and use. </p>
<p>(Standing off to the side are WARRICK, SARA and CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (continued) Our murder weapon's here someplace in a thousand pieces. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at the flowers that were delivered just before the explosion on the ground.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (continued) We have to find it and put it back together again.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Where do we start?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: If it's not growing pick it up. We cart everything we find back to the lab.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: And then what?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Stay curious.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns back to look through the debris. SARA stares at him for a moment still unsure of exactly what they're doing, then turns to look at CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Can you fill in the blanks?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Bombs explode. Weird thing is their components survive the explosion. If we can piece together this bomb, we're closer to finding who did this. So, Warrick, when you're photographing this debris can you, uh ... ?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Uh, I know -- looky-loos.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. HANSEN BUILDING - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Various shots of the on-lookers. WARRICK crosses under the crime scene tape and starts taking pictures of the observers.)</p>
<p>[INT. HANSEN BUILDING - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Using a magnetic device, CATHERINE starts gathering the minute pieces of metal in the debris.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: SARA picks up a piece of metal and looks at it. She bags it.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: WARRICK looks at the damage to the lobby wall. The clock on the wall reads: 6:02.)</p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO:</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<hr />
[EXT. STRIP HOTEL/CASINO - THE ORPHEUS - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(NICK and his friend, ERIC, walk through the hotel toward the front door.) </p>
<p><strong>Eric</strong>: Come on, Nick. It's my last night in Sin City. One more drink, man.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Oh, no. I just pulled a double and I still have to file my shift report.</p>
<p>(NICK hands the valet his ticket.)</p>
<p><strong>Eric</strong>: Hey, you're off the clock. You'd have never passed up a wild night back at A&amp;M.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, I guess I grew up.</p>
<p><strong>Eric</strong>: Too bad. Check that out.</p>
<p>(ERIC indicates the two women walking down the sidewalk toward the building. He looks at them as they walk inside. They look at him as they walk by.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Enjoy.</p>
<p>(They shake hands.)</p>
<p><strong>Eric</strong>: You must really love your job, man. </p>
<p>(ERIC turns and round and calls out to the two women who just walked by. They turn around as he approaches them.)</p>
<p><strong>Eric</strong>: Ladies ...</p>
<p>(NICK chuckles, then turns to leave. The valet brings NICK'S car up to the drive. NICK reaches into his pocket for the tip and walks over to the driver's side.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Here you go. Thanks, man.</p>
<p><strong>Valet</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>(NICK is just about to get into the car, when he hears a disturbance off in the distance.)</p>
<p><strong>Kristy Hopkins</strong>: (o.s.) Get your hands off me! Let go of me. You don't own me. Nobody does.</p>
<p><strong>Jack Willman</strong>: (o.s.) You're not going anywhere. You got that? </p>
<p>(NICK looks up and sees KRISTY HOPKINS arguing with a man who has his hand grasping her upper arm.)</p>
<p><strong>Jack Willman</strong>: Come on. Relax a little bit. Settle down.</p>
<p>(NICK heads over to them.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Kristy? </p>
<p><strong>Kristy Hopkins</strong>: You don't own me, Jack. </p>
<p>(NICK starts to cross the street.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Kristy!</p>
<p><strong>Kristy Hopkins</strong>: Nobody does.</p>
<p><strong>Jack Willman</strong>: I know, I know.</p>
<p>(NICK finally reaches them and stops a distance away from them. He gets their attention.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey. Back off.</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: Hey, just mind your own business.</p>
<p><strong>Kristy Hopkins</strong>: (pleading) Nick. </p>
<p>(JACK tries to shush her.)</p>
<p><strong>Kristy Hopkins</strong>: (to JACK) I know him. He's a cop.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (corrects) Crime scene investigator.</p>
<p><strong>Kristy Hopkins</strong>: Nick, tell him to leave me alone.</p>
<p><strong>Jack Willman</strong>: Nobody tells me to do anything.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, we going to have a problem?</p>
<p><strong>Jack Willman</strong>: No, officer, we're not going to have a problem. See you around, baby.</p>
<p>(He kisses her on the neck, then lets her go. He leaves. KRISTY appears to be slightly rattled. NICK looks at her and notices.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>Kristy Hopkins</strong>: Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. That was good timing. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I suppose you need a ride.</p>
<p><strong>Kristy Hopkins</strong>: Do you mind?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No. Come on.</p>
<p><strong>Kristy Hopkins</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CAR (PARKED) -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(NICK and KRISTY sit in his car parked in her driveway.)</p>
<p><strong>Kristy Hopkins</strong>: Seems like every time we run into each other I'm getting into trouble.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Not that it's any of my business but maybe you should think about changing careers.</p>
<p><strong>Kristy Hopkins</strong>: Not every john is like that guy. Besides, I'm making a change. I'm going back to school.</p>
<p>(He looks at her and nods.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Kristy Hopkins</strong>: I've always wanted to study communications. I'm good with people.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: That's good.</p>
<p><strong>Kristy Hopkins</strong>: You think so?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Kristy Hopkins</strong>: Well, I'm going to go inside now. (pauses, then offers)<br />
Unless, of course, you'd like to come in for a drink.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I don't think that'd be a good idea.</p>
<p><strong>Kristy Hopkins</strong>: Come on. Just 'cause you're a crime scene analyst you don't have to analyze everything.</p>
<p>(She laughs. He laughs.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. HANSEN BUILDING]</p>
<p>(WARRICK, SARA and CATHERINE work at gathering evidence. WARRICK takes pictures. SARA extracts a tire out of the wall. CATHERINE picks up a portion of a gear. She dusts it off and looks at it under the glass. She finds a couple of letters etched into the gear piece.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: F - P - </p>
<p>(Meanwhile, GRISSOM walks outside.)</p>
<p><strong>Dominic Kretzker</strong>: Mr. Grissom.</p>
<p>(DOMINIC looks at GRISSOM and for a moment is flustered.)</p>
<p><strong>Dominic Kretzker</strong>: Oh, uh ... hi, I've ... I've, um, I've seen you on tv before. I admire your work.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, thank you. And your name is ... ?</p>
<p><strong>Dominic Kretzker</strong>: Dominic. Uh, &quot;I-C&quot; rather than with the &quot;I-C-K&quot;... uh, Kretzker. I'm the, uh, Hansen Building Security Detail.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did somebody from homicide talk to you yet?</p>
<p><strong>Dominic Kretzker</strong>: Yeah. As a matter of fact, they said that I was going to be talking to you, because, well, we are ... you know, we're both in law enforcement, and ...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Right. Did you know the victim -- the other security guard?</p>
<p><strong>Dominic Kretzker</strong>: Oh, yeah. He was one of my best buddies. As a matter of fact, you know, two minutes' difference it would've been my face all over the news instead of his, right?</p>
<p>(DOMINIC turns around to look at the news cameras and reporters just behind the crime scene tape.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Would you, uh, like to be on the news?</p>
<p><strong>Dominic Kretzker</strong>: Yeah. Yeah. I mean ... only if I could help people, yes. No, no. I know what you're thinking. Uh, you know, my building blows up I'm over at Arby's sucking down some extra sauce. You know, how could I want to help people, right?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, I mean, realistically, what could you have done?</p>
<p><strong>Dominic Kretzker</strong>: Well, I know a lot about bombs. You know, pipe, power, powder. The three &quot;Ps&quot; of mass destruction.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Huh. Dominic ... with an &quot;I-C,&quot; not &quot;I-C-K&quot; ...</p>
<p><strong>Dominic Kretzker</strong>: Yes sir?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Would you be interested in helping me in my investigation?</p>
<p>(DOMINIC stops and stares at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Dominic Kretzker</strong>: Are you serious? (he chuckles.) Yeah. Yes, sir. I'd be honored, sir. Oh. But we can't tell anybody on the day shift, though because they're going to get real jealous.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's good thinking. Would you excuse me a minute?</p>
<p><strong>Dominic Kretzker</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks over to the OFFICER standing nearby.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (about DOMINIC) Keep an eye on that guy.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM heads back into the building. The OFFICER turns to look at DOMINIC who is just thrilled beyond anything.)</p>
<p><strong>Dominic Kretzker</strong>: Oh, yes!</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. HANSEN BUILDING - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks into the building.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, we got a live one out there. I got a cop baby-sitting him. How you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, are his initials &quot;F.P.&quot;?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No. Dominic Kretzker. Why?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I found this near the point of origin.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE hands the gear piece to GRISSOM. He looks at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Whoever did this is playing with us.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Or he wants to get caught.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks up at CATHERINE.)</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<hr />
[INT. CAR (MOVING) -- DAY]</p>
<p>(NICK is driving and talking on his cell phone.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, it's me. You in the shower? What are you doing? Anyway, if you check your messages I don't have to work till later. So I thought, since you're between careers you might want to grab a late ... </p>
<p>(NICK pulls up in front of KRISTY HOPKINS' house and finds it surrounded by officer cars.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: ... breakfast.</p>
<p>(He pulls up. OFFICER ARVINGTON sees him.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer Arvington</strong>: Hey, Nick, what's up?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Not a lot. What's ... what's going on?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Arvington</strong>: It's a 419. Dead prostitute.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Who's the decedent? </p>
<p><strong>Officer Arvington</strong>: Kristine Marie Hopkins. Day shift's got it covered. You all right?</p>
<p>(NICK looks over and sees ECKLIE talking with the LEAD DETECTIVE and they're both walking down the driveway.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, I must've, uh ... I must've got my wires crossed. I'll see you.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Arvington</strong>: All right, man.</p>
<p>(NICK drives off.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - INTERVIEW ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(DOMINIC KRETZKER explains how bombs work to BRASS and WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Dominic Kretzker</strong>: All right, you cram this thing here with gunpowder, all right? Then you cap it here, and you cap it here. Now the grains inside, all right ... they're going to ignite and cause smoke. Lots and lots of smoke ... now, the problem is, all that smoke's here man it's got nowhere to go. Okay? It starts cooking ... and then ... bob's your uncle... boom!</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Grissom was right: You do know a lot about bombs.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: How did you learn so much?</p>
<p><strong>Dominic Kretzker</strong>: Oh, they don't teach this stuff at universities. No, this is all trial and error.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So what, you just, uh, blow up bombs and study them?</p>
<p><strong>Dominic Kretzker</strong>: Yeah. Yeah...</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So the final piece of the bomber's signature?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Identify the pipe containing the powder.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Three bombs, scaled down five-to-one three different metal pipes. Different metals fly different distances when the same force is applied. Number one is a plumber's ex-flow pipe. Number two is an inflow pipe which is thinner. Number three is galvanized steel which is the thinnest metal of them all.</p>
<p>(They reach the safe blast distance, then put on the earphones. SARA looks at GRISSOM and puts a hand on his shoulder to get his attention.)</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Fragments from the galvanized steel traveled the farthest.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: 20 feet. Extrapolating five to one that would be 100 feet.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: That's the outer limit of visible metal detritus at the Hansen building.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So the bomb was housed in a thin container of galvanized steel -- like a muffler or a tailpipe. I've seen it before. It's a common container for homemades.</p>

<p><strong>Dominic Kretzker</strong>: You mean you weren't just in the neighborhood? </p>
<p>(They both walk slowly toward the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Dominic Kretzker</strong>: That second bomb -- it wasn't remote, was it? Otherwise, I'd still be a suspect.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I can't discuss it.</p>
<p><strong>Dominic Kretzker</strong>: So I guess you're not going to be needing my expertise anymore. I mean, investigation-wise. (he sighs) I knew it was too good to be true. </p>
<p>(DOMINIC turns to GRISSOM and salutes him.)</p>
<p><strong>Dominic Kretzker</strong>: Well, proud to have worked with you, sir.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Dominic ... I'm not a police officer. I-I-I'm a Crime Scene Analyst.</p>
<p><strong>Dominic Kretzker</strong>: Yeah, but we know who really solves the crimes, don't we, sir?</p>
<p>(They shake hands.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Good luck. Take care of yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Dominic Kretzker</strong>: Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hey, Dom?</p>
<p><strong>Dominic Kretzker</strong>: Yeah?</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I ran priors. The guy's got an '88 conviction for sexual assaults.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: (smugly) Boy, if I ever get in trouble, I know which CSI I'm going to.</p>
<p>CATHERINE Let's watch the show.</p>
<p>[INTERVIEW ROOM]</p>
<p>(In the room, DET. O'RILEY takes a seat opposite JACK WILLMAN.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. O'Riley</strong>: How would you characterize your relationship with Kristy Hopkins?</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: Sir, we can just cut the crap. I saw him kill Kristy. I saw everything.</p>
<p><strong>Det. O'Riley</strong>: Go on.</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: Well, Kristy and I, we had words. I was just swinging by her place to tell her I was sorry, but, uh ...</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: JACK looks inside the house and sees KRISTY and NICK arguing loudly.)</p>
<p><strong>Jack Willman</strong>: (V.O.) I didn't expect to see her with a guy. </p>
<p>(NICK pushes KRISTY down on the couch. She grabs something and throws it at him.)</p>
<p><strong>Jack Willman</strong>: (V.O.) They were fighting. I couldn't make out what they were saying but he was pushing her around pretty hard.</p>
<p>(NICK grabs KRISTY and starts choking her.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Det. O'Riley</strong>: Could you I.D. this guy? </p>
<p><strong>Jack Willman</strong>: It was, like, Nick something. Kristy and I bumped into him at the Orpheus earlier.</p>
<p><strong>Det. O'Riley</strong>: And you saw him kill her?</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: Well, I saw him get violent, and I took off.</p>
<p><strong>Det. O'Riley</strong>: And you didn't try to help the girl?</p>
<p><strong>Jack</strong>: He's one of you guys. He carries a gun. I'm no hero. So, could I go?</p>

<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: The witness sounds believable.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It's a load of crap, and you know it.</p>
<p>(The door opens and SHERIFF BRIAN MOBLEY walks in.)</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: I was listening. He seemed credible to me.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Sheriff, you arrest Nick now you end his career.</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: So, what can you offer me?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Nothing, except my gut and ten years of experience. He didn't do this.</p>
<p><strong>Conrad Ecklie</strong>: Ignore the evidence against Stokes it looks like special favors for CSI.</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: Well, I can't have that. Not and keep my post.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So give me twelve hours, access to the crime scene and evidence without filing papers on Nick.</p>
<p><strong>Sheriff Brian Mobley</strong>: Twelve hours. But then we arrest Mr. Stokes with all the attendant documentation.</p>
<p>(The SHERIFF leaves the room. ECKLIE glances at CATHERINE and follows. CATHERINE turns back to look at the empty interview room.)</p>

[INT. CSI - DNA LAB]</p>
<p>(GREG works in his lab with his ear phones on. CATHERINE walks up to him and takes the ear phones off. She leans down and looks at GREG as he raises his head.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (quietly) How you doing, Greg?</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Same as you. Worried about Nick.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah. I need to see his DNA from the crime scene. You have it, right?</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: A sample from the condom, yeah. Popsicled in the freezer. But, uh, it's not your case. Much as I want to help, no can do.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: That's my case for the next twelve hours. Ask the Sheriff.</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: I would never doubt your word.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Smart man.</p>
<p>(GREG opens the freezer and takes out the envelope. He removes the slide and puts it under the scope.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Nick's little soldiers. It's all you.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Thanks, Greg. </p>
<p>[SCOPE VIEW]</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: When did you say this sample was frozen?</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Um ... 10:15 A.M. Why?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: These guys are all heads-- no tails.</p>
<p>(Something occurs to CATHERINE. GREG moves over to look through the scope. CATHERINE rushes out of the </p>

[INT. CSI - HALLWAY -- DAY]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE fills GRISSOM in on her theory.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The sperm found in the condom was frozen at 10:15 A.M. It's all heads, no tails.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm not quite up to speed on the particulars of ...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It takes about seven hours for bacteria to eat away at the tails placing the time of ejaculation at around 2:00 A.M. But Kristy's time of death was 6:00 A.M.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, it suggests a lag between ejaculation and Kristy's murder but it doesn't disprove Nick's presence at the time of the homicide.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You could be a little more supportive.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks away. SARA walks out of a nearby lab.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I have a new favorite color.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Orange?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The orange polyester from the bomb is a match to the thrift-right jacket. Guess where their regional headquarters is located. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The Hansen Building.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You bet. I ran a Lexis search looking for disgruntled employees, irate customers anyone with a grievance against thrift-right.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You get any hits? </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Norman Stirling -- former manager.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How disgruntled?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Let go last year. Caused a commotion at HQ. Filed lawsuits against the company. Guy's been out of work ever since.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: &quot;FP.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Norman Stirling</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You don't recognize those initials?</p>
<p>(Behind him, a couple of officers come in through the doorway from the house.)</p>
<p><strong>Norman Stirling</strong>: What's this about?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The bombing of the thrift-right car rental and the bombing of the Hansen Building.</p>
<p><strong>Norman Stirling</strong>: A-a bomb? Are you kidding? I've never even been near a bomb my entire life.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, those orange jackets over there appear to match the materials the bombs were wrapped in.</p>
<p><strong>Norman Stirling</strong>: I used to wear those to go to work.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You were let go by ThriftRright last year, and lost a court battle to get your job back. In fact, they filed a TRO against you for throwing furniture around their headquarters last July.</p>
<p><strong>Norman Stirling</strong>: I want to call my lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Good. You can call him from the car. He can meet us at the PD. Take him in. Come on, let's go.</p>

<p>(She stops and looks around. From the curtains, to the fireplace and on to the other curtains where she definitely notices something.)</p>

[INT. CSI - LAB -- DAY]</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) Kristy Hopkins was strangled with this sash. </p>
<p>(She puts the evidence bag aside and continues to explain what she wants.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It's fingerprint-free, but the force of the pull would have scratched off epithelials from the killer's hands, right?</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Abraded, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And can you extract DNA from epithelials?</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: If they're fresh enough.</p>
<p>(GREG gets to work. He takes a swab from the cord, then puts the sample under the scope.)</p>
<p>[SCOPE VIEW]</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Okay, epithelials are an affirmative. And they're good to go for DNA profiling. I'm just going to need something to compare it to.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Jack Willman has a prior for a sexual assault so his DNA is on file.</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (nods) DNA didn't pan out, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (smiles sadly) Never have I seen such a clean match. Jack Willman killed her.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: That night in KRISTY'S living room, JACK WILLMAN has the cord tied tight around her neck and chokes her. She struggles.)</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Dispatch said you were looking for me?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah. I finally matched this &quot;FP.&quot; To this electric etcher. Now, I made an exemplar. Boom! Identical type of striations. The manufacturer says that this etcher is only used for training purposes. And it's only sold in bulk. It was not sold to Norman Stirling.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So who bought it?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Las Vegas School District. I called the district, and we traced it down to one high school -- summit high. </p>

<p><strong>Tyler Stirling</strong>: It was kind of hard not to be. I mean, it's all him and my mom talked about for a year. Until she left.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Do you miss your mother?</p>
<p><strong>Tyler Stirling</strong>: I miss our old life.</p>
<p><strong>Norman Stirling</strong>: (quietly) Is there something that we should be talking about? You know, in private?</p>
<p><strong>Tyler Stirling</strong>: You said that's how corporations do it-- in private. See, they treated him great at work, in front of everyone. And then they let him go at the end of the day when no one's around. Thirty years of service, and then ... you know, they realized they could hire two young guys at half the price.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What does &quot;FP&quot; stand for? It was etched into both bombs. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We think you engraved it with an implement from your high school shop class.</p>
<p>(NORMAN looks at TYLER.)</p>
<p><strong>Tyler Stirling</strong>: &quot;Fair play.&quot;</p>
<p>(As soon as TYLER answers, NORMAN'S face falls with the realization that his son did it ... for him.)</p>

<p><strong>Tyler Stirling</strong>: I mean, they threw him out like trash.</p>
<p><strong>Norman Stirling</strong>: And you sent them bombs?!</p>
<p><strong>Tyler Stirling</strong>: You said you wanted to kill them.</p>
<p><strong>Norman Stirling</strong>: How did you even know how to do this?</p>
<p><strong>Tyler Stirling</strong>: Off the internet. </p>

<p><strong>Jack Willman</strong>: Oh, you think I was her client? I was her pimp. She was leaving me to start her own racket. So wake up. This isn't pretty woman. She's not Julia Roberts. You're not Richard Gere.</p>

Mr. Kretzker, a security guard at the Hansen Building, which was bombed just days ago, learned of the bomb threat at the High School and raced there to lend a hand. As a bomb enthusiast, Mr. Kretzker had extensive knowledge of how bombs worked. He'd located the bomb in a student's locker and was carrying it away from the student population to a container. But despite his expertise, he was unable to reach safety in time. (Repeats two more times.)]</p>

CUT TO:



Man: You're going to like my room. You can see the entire strip from my balcony ... and the bed.

Woman:  I usually don't do this. I-I mean, especially with somebody that I just met.
Man: Yeah? Well, I could tell that just by looking at you.

Woman: Uh ...
Man: Come on, don't worry, all right? You can trust me. Okay?
Woman: Promise?
Man: I never lie.

Woman: You are so bad.
Man: Yeah, I am.

CUT TO:



Sara: Hey. Dispatch said suspicious circs.
Brass: Yeah. We got an anonymous call to 9-1-1 at the same time the couple found him. A male voice said: &quot;A man has collapsed at the Devon. Hurry.&quot;
Grissom: Where's the man?

Brass: Oh, he's unconscious, but breathing. So paramedics took him to Desert Palm Hospital. There was no bullet wounds, no knife ... nothing.
Sara: You got a name?
Brass: Bob Fairmont. Upscale home developer.
Sara: &quot;A Fairmont Home, You'll Never Roam?&quot; Those billboards are everywhere.
Brass: Well, they took these pictures before they moved him. 

Grissom: Well, this is as phony as a chappaquiddick neck brace. See how the clothes are all bunched.
Sara: Collar's off to the side, leg fabric's gathered.
Grissom: It's impossible to redress an unconscious person to make it look like they dressed themselves. You notice anything about the suit coat?

Brass: Well, unless he's going to court or to church, there's no way he buttons all three buttons.

Grissom: Very good, Jim.  Why do they think they can fool us?
HARD CUT TO BLACK. END OF TEASER. ROLL TITLE CREDITS.


FADE IN.



Brass: I'm going to go to the hospital to talk to Fairmont's wife.

Grissom: Call me if you learn anything.

Nick: Hey, guys. I just pulled the manager out of a restaurant. Bob Fairmont was staying in room 2927. Catherine's parking the car.
Grissom: Let's go up.
Sara: We'll meet you there.
Nick: Okay.
CUT TO:



Grissom: Mr. Fairmont was staying in Murder Central.
Catherine:  Mmm.
Nick: &quot;Murder Central&quot;?
Sara: You never heard that phrase?
Nick:  Well, if I did, would I have asked the question?
(SARA looks smug as she got a reaction from NICK.
Grissom: Sara, you're with me in here.  You guys get the elevator.
Catherine: All yours, girl.
Sara: Thanks.

Nick:  Sara doesn't know what Murder Central means any more than I do.
Catherine:  Oh, Nick, give it up. We got a death imminent to worry about.
CUT TO:



Julia Fairmont: My husband's in surgery. Can't this wait?
Brass: I'm sorry, no. He was found under suspicious circumstances. Do you have any idea who may have redressed him or moved him?
Julia Fairmont:  He usually goes with women who look a lot like me ... only younger. And I'm embarrassed to say that I've been flattered by that, at times.
Brass: Do you have a name?
Julia Fairmont: I was very much on the outside of that part of his life.
Brass: I see.

CUT TO:



Sara: I know. The room's talking to us. They had champagne. 

Sara: They were celebrating something. 
 
Sara: No lipstick on either glass. 9-1-1 did say it was a man's voice that placed the call.
Grissom: Smell the musk? Hint of bleach? 
 
Grissom: Sexual intercourse.

Sara: They kept the drapes open. A married man who's not worried about ... photographs, long lenses ... 
Grissom: Well, he's either careless or arrogant, maybe.
Sara: Or he has a death wish.  34 C? If he was with a woman, who was the guy on the 911 call?
CUT TO:



Catherine: Hand me that magnifier.  Thank you.
Nick: What do you got?
Catherine: See those white specks? 
 
Nick: What do you think, cocaine?
Catherine: No, I don't think so.
Nick: How can you tell just by looking?
Catherine: Never you mind. 

Catherine: Let's just get this to trace.
CUT TO:



Nick: Okay, we're done in the elevator. You guys need a hand?
Grissom: Yeah, you want to dust the champagne bottle?
Sara: The average American hotel room is covered with stains invisible to the naked eye.
Grissom: Yeah, but they're not all biological. Some are soda stains, food stains, whiskey stains, you know.
Sara: No matter how clean or expensive the room seems that why always travel with nonoxinol nine.

Grissom: You sound like you're making a commercial. Nick, hit the lights, will you?

Grissom: Okay, we're looking for the freshest stains.
Sara: Soda, maybe ... maybe champagne ... oh! Someone's little soldiers ... more champagne.

Grissom: Hmm ... &quot;starlight, star bright, first star I see tonight.&quot; 

Grissom: Okay, I'll let you guys do the collection.
Nick: Thanks a lot.

Grissom: Oh, and Sara? 
Sara: Hmm.
Grissom: Last hotel room nearest the stairwell -- easy entry and egress for an intruder and if the victim fights back, fifty percent less chance of being heard.
Sara: Rooms only on one side. Murder Central.

Nick:  You are so busted.

CUT TO:




Catherine: I gave this to trace. Why do you have 
Greg: Well, because I deal in DNA. The smallest sliver of epidermal tissue.
Catherine: This is skin.
Greg: Scalp skin. Itchy. Can be embarrassing in social situations especially if one is wearing a dark shirt.
Catherine: Dandruff.

Greg: Good chance whoever moved the guy into the elevator ...
Catherine: Had a bad case of seborrhea.

Catherine: Thanks.

Greg: Hey, Catherine? Do you think Sara would ever go out with me?
Catherine:  As long as you don't tell her it's a date.

CUT TO:



Warrick: Hey, Cath... are you on this Fairmont case?
Catherine: House mogul caught with his pants on? Yeah, I'm just rolling to the hospital to get his clothes. Why?
Warrick: You know the Fairmont house was one of my first calls three years ago?
Catherine: You serious? For what?
Warrick: Shots fired. He shot himself while he was cleaning his gun.
Catherine: Wow!
Warrick: Yeah. And after hearing about tonight I'm wondering if that's what really happened. I'm going to pull his file and check it out.
Catherine: Let me know.
Warrick: I will.
CUT TO:



Nick: Nice shot.  Reservoir's still wet.

Sara: Why did he throw it?
Nick: Mmm. I'm only impressed if he aimed.
Sara: I wonder if the woman has any idea she left her DNA behind?
Nick: Not rocket science. Man's inside, woman's out.
CUT TO:



Brass: Wife says the guy's a player. She doesn't know the women.
Grissom: You tell her about the 911 tape?
Brass: The male voice? Oh, I just got back from central dispatch. The tape's lost. New computer system.
Grissom: Any ear-witnesses?
Brass: The dispatcher says it could've been a woman whispering. Or a very old person, gender indeterminate.
Grissom: That's about as good as an eyewitness.

Grissom: Grissom.  I'll be right there. 

Grissom: No lunch.

CUT TO:
SCENE #13


Grissom: We got a time?
Robbins: Well, all indications are he was brain-dead from the time he collapsed at the hotel
Grissom: From?

Robbins:  An artery out-pouches blood floods the subarachnoid space.
 
Robbins: Heart still beats, but the brain's dead. And it doesn't regenerate.
Grissom: Aneurysm from trauma ... infection...?
Robbins: Genetic predisposition. Both parents went that way. It increases a person's chance of stroke ten-fold. He looks like an athlete.
Grissom: Brain dead at 38, otherwise healthy and strong. Is this a Frankenstein?
Robbins: I was wondering when you'd ask. Prime donor candidate. Next of kin signed off.
Grissom: How many organs they take?
Robbins: Eight in under two hours.
Grissom: Man, those harvest doctors move, don't they?

Doctor: Kidneys, stat! DOCTOR: Go, go, go!

Doctor: Here comes the liver. Ready with a basin, please. Nurse: For ... DOCTOR: Right now. DOCTOR: And here we go!

Doctor: Clamp it. DOCTOR: Get it back, get it back. DOCTOR: Ready and got it. DOCTOR: Here we go.

Grissom:  All right, I'll notify the PD about the organs.

CUT TO:



Greg: So I was thinking. Maybe we could take our break at the same time.
 Together.
Sara: Sure.
Greg:  Really.

Sara: Semen. No surprise there.
Greg: Well, without the DNA sample from the hotel guy this test is pretty useless.

Sara: I'm more interested ... in who the woman is.
Greg: Well, just like the bra, I'm going to need a reference of her DNA in order to do anything, and that's not going to happen until ...

Sara: What the heck?
Greg: What?
Sara:  Stripes.

Greg: Stripes.
CUT TO:



Sara: Transverse white bands that appear six weeks after the onset of symptoms of toxicity.
Grissom: You got a closer view?

Grissom: Uh ...
Sara: They look like mees lines to me.
Grissom: Could be livor mortis.
Sara: Or white striae, indicative of heavy metal poisoning.
Grissom: We can't count on a photo to draw that kind of conclusion. We need the body.
CUT TO:



Sara: Don't take this wrong, Dr. Robbins, but ... how do you release a body that's been redressed and dumped in an elevator?

Robbins: I deal with cause of death, which was an aneurysm and therefore, a natural, and based on that his body is released to a mortuary.

Sara: The whole transplant thing didn't raise a flag?
Grissom: I thought I'd raised a flag with the good doctor when I told him I was going to notify the police department but evidently, I mis-communicated again.
Sara: Great.

(The results are as follows:
[Name: FAIRMONT, ROBERT Cause of Death: Natural Date: 12/13/01
Time of Death: 4:00 a.m. Case #: 29574
Destination: Desert Haven Mortuary ]
Robbins: All may not be lost. Here... body of Robert Fairmont released at 0400 hours to the Desert Haven Mortuary.
Sara: I know that place.
Grissom: Well, if they haven't embalmed him we can still get a blood sample test for heavy metal poisoning.
Sara: Good. I'll drive. 
 
Sara: You're not coming?
Grissom:  You found it, you run with it. 
 
Grissom: You can do it. Take Nick.
Sara: Okay.

CUT TO:



Sara: How long's he been in here?
Randy Gesek: 92 minutes at 1,600 degrees. At, exactly, was it that you wanted to see?

Nick: His fingernails.
Randy Gesek: I'm very sorry.
Nick: Who approved this cremation?

Randy Gesek: His wife, Julia Fairmont.
Sara: Same person who approved the organ transplants.

FADE TO BLACK.


FADE IN.

CUT TO:



Brass: You told me your husband was in surgery.
Julia Fairmont: He was.
Brass: Surgery to take his organs not to save his life.
Julia Fairmont: He was technically ... dead. He wanted to donate his organs. I was following his wishes. Why are you being so hostile?
Brass: Someone was poisoning your husband.
Julia Fairmont: What?
Sara: We don't know the dose or the duration but we do know the type of poison. We processed your husband's remains.

Sara:  Most poisons would be completely burned off by cremation but heavy metals are very resistant to heat. This heavy metal -- selenium. 

Sara: Did you notice that your husband's breath might have been garlicky?
Julia Fairmont: Garlicky?
Sara: The body will excrete demethyl selenide -- smells just like garlic.
Julia Fairmont: Uh... no.
Sara: The white stripes on his fingernails--did you notice those?
Julia Fairmont: Um ... we didn't see each other a lot. Bob was busy building his company.
Sara: That bother you, him never being home?

Julia Fairmont: I think it would bother any woman.
Sara: Did you know that the most common choice of premeditated murder among women is poison? They cite its passivity.
Julia Fairmont: I did not poison my husband.
Sara: You cremated his body.
Julia Fairmont: He wanted to be cremated. I cremated him. He wanted to donate his organs. I did that, too. Now, if there's nothing else, I will be at home preparing for my husband's memorial service. Excuse me.

Sara: Do you want us to notify you?

Julia Fairmont: Of what?

Sara: When we find out the exact amount of selenium given to your husband and over what period of time?
Julia Fairmont: I thought you couldn't tell.
Sara: Your husband's gone, but his organs are still out there.
Julia Fairmont:  Well, good. Yes, I would like to be notified.

CUT TO:



Carl Mercer: Straight up, am I going to die?
Physician: You have only a small fraction of the poison that was in your donor's body--one organ. With nothing new coming in it should work its way out.
Carl Mercer: I must've had 100 tests. How'd you doctors miss this?
Nick: A heavy metal like selenium presents so rarely that it's 
Carl Mercer: You don't look like a doctor.
Nick:  No, sir, no, I'm not. I'm Nick Stokes. I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
Physician: I'll be right outside.
Nick: Thank you, doctor. 
 
Nick: I was hoping I might be able to get a sample of that new kidney of yours.
Carl Mercer: A sample?
Nick: Biopsy. A sliver.
Carl Mercer: You mean open me up again?
Nick: Maybe an invasive scope. The only way I can get an accurate barometer of the poison in Mr. Fairmont's system is through one of his organs.
Carl Mercer: I'm sorry, young man but this is my kidney now.  I waited four years. I can't have anyone cut into me for it. I just can't.
Nick: Hey, I understand. Thank you for your time.

Nick: I like your watch, man, that's cool.
Carl Mercer: It broke while I was down in surgery--stuck on 11:00. Think the Lord's trying to tell me something?
 
Nick: Yeah, get it to a watch repair shop.  I hope you get to feeling better, Mr. Mercer.

CUT TO:




Sara: Nick struck out on the kidney. I got four &quot;no's&quot; over the phone. One yes from a recipient in Illinois-- heart.
Grissom: Useless-- heart has no memory for poison.
Sara: Why can't we cut the middle man and just check the wife's house for selenium?  All right, I know, something about constitutional law. Get probable cause, then get a search warrant ...

Greg: Sara! I was just looking for you. Still up for break?
Sara: Sorry, Greggo-- hot case. I'm going to go look at Nick's champagne bottle. How you doing with our DNA?
Greg: Uh ... inside-outside we're still looking for a reference for comparison but the epidermals are looking promising.
Sara: Nice.

Grissom: You want to clue me in?
Greg: Sara and I were just going out for dinner.
Grissom: On the case, &quot;Greggo&quot;.
Greg: Oh. Right.

CUT TO:



Claudia Gideon: Excuse me ... I'm Claudia Gideon, Bob Fairmont's secretary. I came to pick up his property.
Nurse: Oh, I'm sorry, but Ms. Willows already asked for them.
Catherine: His property is part of our investigation. I'm afraid I have to take it.
Claudia Gideon: Oh, fine. I was just doing my job.
Catherine: Yeah, me, too. Did you work for the Fairmonts three years ago, when Mr. Fairmont was shot?
Claudia Gideon: I was out sick that day.
Catherine: Interesting. 
 
Catherine: You have dandruff.

Claudia Gideon: Is that really proper etiquette?
Catherine: It is when I'm on a case. Do you mind?

Claudia Gideon: Where did you say you worked?
CUT TO:



Brass: I'm going to ask you again -- were you in that hotel room with Bob Fairmont?

Claudia Gideon: I was not, no.
Catherine: But you did redress him and place him in the elevator.
Claudia Gideon: You don't know what you're talking about.
Catherine: Well, that's dangerous to say to a scientist. 
 
Catherine: Dandruff is nothing more than sloughed-off skin. It has a nucleus just like a cell on your arm or your big toe. 
 
Catherine: These 13 DNA markers from this dandruff cell are a match to the dandruff that I recovered from your sweater. You were there. At that hotel.
Claudia Gideon: Okay, Mr. Fairmont told me earlier that day to meet him in his hotel room at 9:00 to pick up some papers, okay? When I got there, he was in bed -- naked,
 
Claudia Gideon:  ... unconscious.

Claudia Gideon:  He always told me reputation before health -- no scandals. I dragged him to the elevator.

Catherine: Let me guess -- you snuck out down the stairwell.

Brass: Who was Fairmont partying with in that room?
Claudia Gideon: I don't know.
Catherine: Well, we won't mind if we compare your DNA to the vaginal contribution of a condom that we recovered from Mr. Fairmont's room?
Claudia Gideon:  Sure, go ahead.
Catherine: Good. We'd like to show you something else -- about that accidental shooting three years ago at your boss' house.
CUT TO:



Warrick: In this reinactment, Fairmont shot himself while cleaning his gun? In this reenactment the story just doesn't add up. I think I fell for it because I was new and I wasn't too eager to talk to another guy about him almost shooting off his manhood. 

Warrick: This is the room as it was then based off of my crime scene photos. This is crime scene reconstruction, new school. Works backward, reverse time. 

Warrick: The bullet hit here.

Warrick: The only logical place for that bullet to have been shot from is four meters away, one meter high. He didn't actually shoot himself. Someone shot him.
Catherine: We're thinking it was you.
Brass: Admission form from the ER, 9/6/98. The person who brought Fairmont in on the accidental shooting... was you.
(BRASS puts a copy of the Record of Admissions Form from the Desert Palms Hospital in front of her. The application Information reads as follows:

Claudia Gideon: I didn't shoot him.
Brass: You didn't poison him, either. All these bad things just happen to you.
Claudia Gideon: I'm on call 24 hours a day, okay? Mr. Fairmont beeped me. I drove out to the house, and I took him in.
Catherine: Where was his wife?

Claudia Gideon: You'd have to ask her.
CUT TO:



Julia Fairmont: Yes, I shot him. He was supposed to go riding with me and he didn't show up till two in the morning. No calls, nothing. I was ... hurt.
Catherine: So, you just sat there in the dark and aimed south of his belt.
Julia Fairmont: I just wanted to scare him.

Bob Fairmont: It was a business meeting. BOB FAIRMONT: I swear. BOB FAIRMONT: I-it wasn't like before. BOB FAIRMONT: I was thinking about you the whole time.

Brass: So, why didn't you tell the truth then?
Mrs. Fairmont: I wanted to, but Bob wouldn't let me. He said that it would ruin his career -- Fairmont Family Estates.
Warrick: I'm presenting this case to the D.A., even if it is three years old.
Claudia: My husband's dead. We had our problems but I loved him I don't ... I don't much care what you do now.
Brass: Well, there's only two reasons a woman shoots a man. She either loves him or hates him.
Catherine: Or both.
FADE TO BLACK.

Greg: That's the sample Catherine pulled off of the secretary's blouse and the hotel man's clothes -- same source.
Grissom: Secretary moved the body.
Catherine: We just interviewed her. She copped to moving him. We're looking hard at the wife on the poisoning.
Grissom: The secretary has dandruff.
Catherine: We know. Dermatomycoses seborrhea -- we got it.
Grissom: Pical eczemas like that require prescription medication. The primary ingredient of those medications -- selenium sulfide.

Julia Fairmont: I don't really feel right about doing this.
Brass: Oh, this is your residence. Everything in Claudia's office is your property.

Catherine: Shampoo full of the same poison found in Bob Fairmont's remains?
Claudia Gideon: I don't know.
Brass: Aw, you have to do better than that.
Claudia Gideon: Maybe I pied it up at the pharmacy on lunch and put it there. I don't know.

Catherine: Cream cheese.

Catherine: Garlic cream cheese ...
Brass: Hides the bitter aftertaste.

Catherine: It explains away his bad breath.

Claudia Gideon: I did not poison him.

Catherine: We'll see.
Julia Fairmont: Aren't you going to arrest her?

Claudia Gideon: I haven't done anything.
Julia Fairmont: Other than poison Bob.
Claudia Gideon: Poison? I'm the one who looked out for him.
Julia Fairmont: You? I ran his home. I entertained his clients.
Claudia Gideon: Who made all of his dental appointments, huh? His haircuts? Who got his taxes in on time?
Julia Fairmont: You covered for his mistresses ...
Claudia Gideon: Why did he need mistresses?
Brass: Ladies ... don't go there.
Catherine: This is yours ... and these are yours.  There's the door. We build a case before we make any arrests.
CUT TO:



Nick: Hey, Mr. Mercer. I got your message. You wanted to talk to me?
Carl Mercer: Did you find out who poisoned Mr. Fairmont?
Nick: No. No, sir. ,I have found selenium in his office but... without actually knowing how much was in his system ... 
Carl Mercer: What if I could tell you? My body's rejecting the organ. Doctor says it's got nothing to do with poison. It's antibodies.
Nick: I'm sorry. 
Carl Mercer: I told you this watch stopped while I was down in surgery? It's funny ... it's like it knew all along the kidney wasn't going to take. Anyway... there's one last good thing I can do before I leave this earth. So ... how do we do this?

CUT TO:



Nick: I can't even talk Warrick into splitting a sandwich with me and this guy's willing to give us his kidney?
Grissom: You asked for it.
Nick: Yeah, that's my point. Carl Mercer risks dying sooner to help our investigation but who protects his rights?
Grissom: He has free will.
Nick: Well, so do I. I want to retract our request. I don't think any investigation for the dead is worth hurting the living.

Nick: What?

Sara: Guys? You're not going to believe this.
CUT TO:



Sara: Funny sometimes it is the simplest things that seems so difficult. I've been trying to match the partial from the champagne bottle to these known prints. It was upside down.

Grissom: Must've grabbed the bottle ...

Grissom: ... upside-down to pour.


Grissom: So ... who was he with?
Sara: Mrs. Fairmont.
Nick:  What? Player was in the hotel cheating with his own wife?
CUT TO:



Julia Fairmont: I was trying to ... rekindle our marriage. I ... got the room ... brought the champagne.

Bob Fairmont:  Oh, yes. Yes.

Julia Fairmont: He squeezed me in between business meetings at the hotel.
Brass: And you didn't think to tell me that when we first talked?

Julia Fairmont: No, because you asked me about him being redressed in an elevator ... and, besides, when I left him, he was ... alive watching the news.

Brass: Oh, so, he had a stroke alone, after you left.

Julia Fairmont: I'm not a doctor. I don't know when he had it.
Brass: Well, CSI is testing that champagne bottle for selenium.
Julia Fairmont: I didn't think poison caused strokes.
Brass: You seem to know a lot about poison for not being a doctor.
Julia Fairmont: I know a lot of things about a lot of things, but that doesn't mean that I killed my husband.
CUT TO:


Grissom: Yeah ... but what never lies?
CUT TO:



Sara: Fairmont had three gold crowns. They should've survived the cremation.
Grissom: At least partially. Heavy metal, after all.
Sara: His wife ... had them removed at the mortuary. That adds new meaning to the phrase &quot;gold digger.&quot;
Grissom: Actually, that's how the phrase got started. People used to dig up the bodies to extract the gold.
Sara: Now they just marry them. In some countries, this would be enough to have her arrested for murdering her husband.
Grissom: What's the most important component in a poisoning.

Sara: Poison.

Grissom: Patience.

CUT TO:



Nick: Ms. Fairmont ... Ms. Fairmont, you feeling okay?

Julia Fairmont: Yeah, I'm, I'm ...

Nick: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Julia Fairmont: Hey ... maybe I just need to sit down... for a minute.
Nick: Yeah, yeah, let's sit down here in the car for a sec. 

Nick: There you go. Relax, relax, relax.

Nick: yeah, I need an ambulance. Uh, Vegas PD, west parking lot.
CUT TO:





CUT TO:



Catherine: Hey, what's going on? We called the hospital. She's been released.
Nick: ER doc gave her a shot of hydropazeen ... sent her on her way.
Grissom: Hydropazeen? That's an antiemetic used to counteract heavy metal poisoning.
Nick: Which means ... somebody's been poisoning our suspect.
CUT TO:




Claudia Gideon: I don't know how it happened. Maybe she poisoned herself.
Brass: Why would she do that?
Claudia Gideon:  Why would she hide my shampoo in my office?
Brass: What, you know she did that?
Claudia Gideon: Well, it wasn't her husband. He was already dead. She's trying to frame me for killing him.
Brass: I mean, do you have anything beyond your suspicions that she did kill him?
Claudia Gideon: She had his gold fillings removed. Doesn't that tell you something about her?
CUT TO:



Julia Fairmont: I had his watch and ring removed, too. Do you want to see them? They're in a box at home.
Brass: You realize that doesn't look good?
Julia Fairmont: It can look however it wants. I have nothing to hide.
Brass: You mean since you yourself have been poisoned?
Julia Fairmont: Yeah, why aren't you asking Claudia Richards about that? First my husband, then me?
Brass: Why would she want to kill either one of you?
Julia Fairmont: I don't know. Maybe because he refused ... to leave me for her.
CUT TO:



Claudia Gideon: I had to wash his grungy coffee mug every night. I had to clean his toenail clippings off of his desktop. Why would I ever ask Bob Fairmont to leave anyone for me?
Brass: So, you think it was all in Mrs. Fairmont's head?
Claudia Gideon: He always said she was crazy.
Brass:  Okay, that's it. All right ... look, we're not leaving here till we get to the bottom of this.
Claudia Gideon: Then I hope she talks soon.

Sara: Nick, did you get anything 
Nick: Hey, Sara. Yeah. Sodium selenite-- selenium. 280 milligrams for a 180-pound man...

Sara: That's murder.
Nick: Yeah, well, it would have been murder for a 300-pound man.
Sara: This is different than the shampoo compound.
Nick: Yeah, it contains polysorbate 80 and vitamin E. That combination's found in selenium supplements injected in animals.
Sara: Animals? Like cats, dogs?
Nick: Mostly livestock, grazers.
Sara: To make up for the lack of selenium nutrient in the soil. How did Claudia get access to this stuff?
Catherine:  A dairy farm. 

Catherine: &quot;Gideon Dairy and Cheese.&quot; Largest supplier of milk in Connecticut, in fact. Brass talked to a local chamber-of-commerce type about Claudia's husband. You want to know who his secretary was?
Sara: Yeah.

Sara: Our Julia Fairmont.

CUT TO:



Sara: Ten years ago, you played secretary and you played wife.
Claudia: We have never represented we didn't know each other previously.
Julia: And I wasn't playing. I was a hard-working secretary.
Catherine: And you loved your husband Right up to the day he died ... of 240 milligrams of selenium.
Sara: Animal selenium, the kind used for cattle.
Claudia: Well, we did live in grazing country although, I have to say, Julia knew more about livestock than I did. She rode horses.
 
Julia: I took the job because Mr. G let me board my horse at the family stables.
Claudia: Oh, I hated the stables. The smell. Never stepped foot in them.
Sara: Implicating you, the secretary.

Sara: I don't believe this.
Catherine: Bravo. Ladies. You have got this down to a science.  Why did it happen the first time? Hubby ignored you or abused you or you got sick of him fooling around so you started slipping the ... 

Catherine:  ... cow stuff into his chocolate milk? Julia must have caught you.

Catherine: So the two of you struck a deal.

Claudia: I'm, uh ... I'm coming into a lot of money.

Julia: No, we are.

Sara: And then what? The two of you realized how quickly you could run through a couple million? So you went looking for another mark here in Nevada?
Catherine: But the difference is that you actually loved Bob Fairmont. 

Catherine: You shot him because he was cheating but that didn't get in the way of your long-term goals, did it?

Grissom: I just came from the D.A. Their attorneys were there as well. Based on everything we have the D.A. Is not going to move forward. He says it's a reject.
Sara: Brass doesn't have anything?
Grissom: Brass is still in the field.

Grissom: You're free to go.

Julia:  Where's the ladies' room?
Catherine: It's down the hall to your right.
Julia: Thanks.
Claudia: Pardon me.

Catherine: Well, no big surprise. We have proof of poison but no way to prove which one of them did it.
Sara: I like either one of them for the murder-- so will a jury.
Catherine: She-said/she-said defense? It's never going to fly. They'll raise each other as a viable suspect just like they did with us.
Grissom: That's what the D.A. said verbatim.
Catherine: See you back at CSI.

Sara: Wait. What? So, what, and just let them move on to another state, another husband?
Grissom: It's not always up to us.
 
CUT TO:



Grissom: Sara ... look ... 

Grissom: I know this isn't news to you but sometimes science isn't enough.
Sara: What are we doing? Digging up graves, chasing prints -- if it's no good in court ... if the killers win ...
Grissom: It isn't a competition. We don't win.  The courts are like dice. They have no memory. What works one week doesn't work the next.
Sara:  I know that. I do. I know that. That's why I'm mad. 
Grissom: But, see, if you get mad, then they do win.
Sara: You just said ... This is one of your riddles isn't it?
Grissom:  ... But, hey ... the good news? There's no statute of limitation on murder.

FADE TO BLACK.

[INT. DEVON HOTEL -- LOBBY -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(A MAN and A WOMAN walk through the lobby, their arms around each other.)</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: You're going to like my room. You can see the entire strip from my balcony ... and the bed.</p>
<p>(He turns her around, her back against the wall. Her hands come up against his chest.)</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: (nervously) I usually don't do this. I-I mean, especially with somebody that I just met.</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: Yeah? Well, I could tell that just by looking at you.</p>
<p>(The MAN presses the elevator door button. The elevator bell dings.)</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: Uh ...</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: Come on, don't worry, all right? You can trust me. Okay?</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: Promise?</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: I never lie.</p>
<p>(The MAN starts to kiss the WOMAN. He backs her up into the elevator.)</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: You are so bad.</p>
<p><strong>Man</strong>: Yeah, I am.</p>
<p>(He lifts her up and carries her into the elevator. He presses her against the elevator wall and starts kissing her. After a moment, the woman looks down and sees the dead body on the floor ... )</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. DEVON HOTEL -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(SARA and GRISSOM arrive at the scene. They duck under the crime scene tape and walk toward BRASS who is already there.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey. Dispatch said suspicious circs.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah. We got an anonymous call to 9-1-1 at the same time the couple found him. A male voice said: &quot;A man has collapsed at the Devon. Hurry.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Where's the man?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at the empty elevator. There are two cones on the floor ... and no body.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, he's unconscious, but breathing. So paramedics took him to Desert Palm Hospital. There was no bullet wounds, no knife ... nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You got a name?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Bob Fairmont. Upscale home developer.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: &quot;A Fairmont Home, You'll Never Roam?&quot; Those billboards are everywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, they took these pictures before they moved him. </p>
<p>(BRASS hands GRISSOM a stack of photos. GRISSOM puts his kit down and looks through the photos.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, this is as phony as a chappaquiddick neck brace. See how the clothes are all bunched.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Collar's off to the side, leg fabric's gathered.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's impossible to redress an unconscious person to make it look like they dressed themselves. You notice anything about the suit coat?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM shows the photo to BRASS. BRASS takes it and looks at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, unless he's going to court or to church, there's no way he buttons all three buttons.</p>
<p>(BRASS gives the photo back to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Very good, Jim. (to SARA) Why do they think they can fool us?</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO BLACK. END OF TEASER. ROLL TITLE CREDITS.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<hr />
[INT. DEVON HOTEL - LOBBY -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(SARA takes pictures of the elevator. GRISSOM studies the photos.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'm going to go to the hospital to talk to Fairmont's wife.</p>
<p>(SARA continues to take pictures.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Call me if you learn anything.</p>
<p>(BRASS leaves. NICK walks up to them.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, guys. I just pulled the manager out of a restaurant. Bob Fairmont was staying in room 2927. Catherine's parking the car.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Let's go up.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We'll meet you there.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. DEVON HOTEL - HALLWAY -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks toward room 2927. In front of them is the door to the stairs. NICK, SARA and CATHERINE follow. They all stop in front of the closed room door.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mr. Fairmont was staying in Murder Central.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (agrees) Mmm.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: &quot;Murder Central&quot;?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You never heard that phrase?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (exasperated) Well, if I did, would I have asked the question?</p>
<p>(SARA looks smug as she got a reaction from NICK.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sara, you're with me in here. (to CATHERINE and NICK) You guys get the elevator.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: All yours, girl.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM unlocks the hotel room door. He and SARA enter. CATHERINE and NICK walk back down the hallway.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (disgruntled) Sara doesn't know what Murder Central means any more than I do.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (puts a hand on NICK'S shoulder) Oh, Nick, give it up. We got a death imminent to worry about.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(BRASS questions JULIA FAIRMONT)</p>
<p><strong>Julia Fairmont</strong>: My husband's in surgery. Can't this wait?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'm sorry, no. He was found under suspicious circumstances. Do you have any idea who may have redressed him or moved him?</p>
<p><strong>Julia Fairmont</strong>: (shakes her head) He usually goes with women who look a lot like me ... only younger. And I'm embarrassed to say that I've been flattered by that, at times.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Do you have a name?</p>
<p><strong>Julia Fairmont</strong>: I was very much on the outside of that part of his life.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I see.</p>
<p>(BRASS puts his notebook back in his jacket pocket.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. DEVON HOTEL - ROOM 2927 -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Standing side-by-side, GRISSOM and SARA look at the room in front of them. They're silent as they look around the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I know. The room's talking to us. They had champagne. </p>
<p>(SARA walks into the room, GRISSOM remains by the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: They were celebrating something. </p>
<p>(She looks at the glasses.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No lipstick on either glass. 9-1-1 did say it was a man's voice that placed the call.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Smell the musk? Hint of bleach? </p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks up at the mirror over the bed. He notices that the bed is mussed.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sexual intercourse.</p>
<p>(SARA turns around to look at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: They kept the drapes open. A married man who's not worried about ... photographs, long lenses ... </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, he's either careless or arrogant, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Or he has a death wish. (SARA looks down and picks up a bra.) 34 C? If he was with a woman, who was the guy on the 911 call?</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. DEVON HOTEL - ELEVATOR -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and NICK work on the elevator.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hand me that magnifier. (NICK hands her the magnifier.) Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What do you got?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: See those white specks? </p>
<p>(Camera zooms for a close up of the white specks. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What do you think, cocaine?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No, I don't think so.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: How can you tell just by looking?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Never you mind. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE takes a tape lift of the white specks.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Let's just get this to trace.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. DEVON HOTEL - ROOM 2927]</p>
<p>(NICK opens the hotel room door and walks inside. GRISSOM and SARA are just putting on their goggles and taking out the ALS.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay, we're done in the elevator. You guys need a hand?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, you want to dust the champagne bottle?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The average American hotel room is covered with stains invisible to the naked eye.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, but they're not all biological. Some are soda stains, food stains, whiskey stains, you know.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No matter how clean or expensive the room seems that why always travel with nonoxinol nine.</p>
<p>(They stand up.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You sound like you're making a commercial. Nick, hit the lights, will you?</p>
<p>(NICK turns the lights off.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Okay, we're looking for the freshest stains.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Soda, maybe ... maybe champagne ... oh! Someone's little soldiers ... more champagne.</p>
<p>(They look up at the walls.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hmm ... &quot;starlight, star bright, first star I see tonight.&quot; </p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes off his goggles and heads for the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Okay, I'll let you guys do the collection.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Thanks a lot.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns around.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Oh, and Sara? </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Last hotel room nearest the stairwell -- easy entry and egress for an intruder and if the victim fights back, fifty percent less chance of being heard.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Rooms only on one side. Murder Central.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM nods his head and leaves the room. The door closes behind him.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (smiling) You are so busted.</p>
<p>(SARA turns around to look at NICK. She smiles.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - DNA LAB -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Camera close up of a scope view of the &quot;white specks&quot; found on the elevator floor. The magnification view is increased. Camera turns around and goes back up the viewer to the eye looking through the scope. End of scope view.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I gave this to trace. Why do you have </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, because I deal in DNA. The smallest sliver of epidermal tissue.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: This is skin.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Scalp skin. Itchy. Can be embarrassing in social situations especially if one is wearing a dark shirt.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Dandruff.</p>
<p>(GREG reaches out and brushes non-existent dandruff from CATHERINE'S shoulder.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Good chance whoever moved the guy into the elevator ...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Had a bad case of seborrhea.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE deliberately leans forward and brushes the non-existent dandruff from GREG'S shoulder.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE turns to leave the lab. GREG stops her.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Hey, Catherine? Do you think Sara would ever go out with me?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (thinks about it) Sure. (deadpans) As long as you don't tell her it's a date.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE leaves the lab.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE exits the DNA lab and walks down the hallway. WARRICK catches up with her.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey, Cath... are you on this Fairmont case?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: House mogul caught with his pants on? Yeah, I'm just rolling to the hospital to get his clothes. Why?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You know the Fairmont house was one of my first calls three years ago?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You serious? For what?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Shots fired. He shot himself while he was cleaning his gun.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Wow!</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah. And after hearing about tonight I'm wondering if that's what really happened. I'm going to pull his file and check it out.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Let me know.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I will.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. DEVON HOTEL - ROOM 2927]</p>
<p>(NICK picks up the used condom from the fixture on the wall.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Nice shot. (looks inside) Reservoir's still wet.</p>
<p>(NICK bags it.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Why did he throw it?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mmm. I'm only impressed if he aimed.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I wonder if the woman has any idea she left her DNA behind?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Not rocket science. Man's inside, woman's out.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI -- HALLWAY]</p>
<p>(BRASS fills GRISSOM in about the 911 tape.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Wife says the guy's a player. She doesn't know the women.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You tell her about the 911 tape?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The male voice? Oh, I just got back from central dispatch. The tape's lost. New computer system.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Any ear-witnesses?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The dispatcher says it could've been a woman whispering. Or a very old person, gender indeterminate.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's about as good as an eyewitness.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM'S phone rings. He answers it.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Grissom. (pause) What? (pause) I'll be right there. </p>
<p>(He hangs up and looks at BRASS.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No lunch.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns around and heads back down the hallway.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
SCENE #13</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY]</p>
<p>(ROBBINS goes over the findings with GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We got a time?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Well, all indications are he was brain-dead from the time he collapsed at the hotel</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: From?</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV to: A camera close up of the deceased's forehead. White flash to a view of the brain where blood starts to leak out.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (V.O.) An artery out-pouches blood floods the subarachnoid space.</p>
<p>(End of CGI POV. Resume to present.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Heart still beats, but the brain's dead. And it doesn't regenerate.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Aneurysm from trauma ... infection...?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Genetic predisposition. Both parents went that way. It increases a person's chance of stroke ten-fold. He looks like an athlete.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Brain dead at 38, otherwise healthy and strong. Is this a Frankenstein?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: I was wondering when you'd ask. Prime donor candidate. Next of kin signed off.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How many organs they take?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Eight in under two hours.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Man, those harvest doctors move, don't they?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The heart monitor beeps. The doctor puts the first organ in the pan.)</p>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong>: Kidneys, stat! DOCTOR: Go, go, go!</p>
<p>(Various flashes of the organs being removed and of various machinery monitoring the donor.)</p>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong>: Here comes the liver. Ready with a basin, please. <strong>Nurse</strong>: For ... DOCTOR: Right now. DOCTOR: And here we go!</p>
<p>(The second organ goes into the pan marked: &quot;Liver&quot;.)</p>
<p><strong>Doctor</strong>: Clamp it. DOCTOR: Get it back, get it back. DOCTOR: Ready and got it. DOCTOR: Here we go.</p>
<p>(The final organ is placed in the pan. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (nods) All right, I'll notify the PD about the organs.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM leaves the room.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - DNA LAB]</p>
<p>(GREG takes a swab from the condom. SARA reads through some papers as she waits.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: So I was thinking. Maybe we could take our break at the same time.<br />
(beat) Later this shift. (beat) Together.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (surprised) Really.</p>
<p>(GREG tests the swab. SARA leans in to look.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Semen. No surprise there.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, without the DNA sample from the hotel guy this test is pretty useless.</p>
<p>(SARA goes back to looking at the photos.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'm more interested ... in who the woman is.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, just like the bra, I'm going to need a reference of her DNA in order to do anything, and that's not going to happen until ...</p>
<p>(SARA rifles through the autopsy photos. She sees something.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What the heck?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (looking up) Stripes.</p>
<p>(Without further explanation, SARA walks out of the lab.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Stripes.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY]</p>
<p>(SARA and GRISSOM walk through the hallway. SARA shows GRISSOM the photos.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Transverse white bands that appear six weeks after the onset of symptoms of toxicity.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You got a closer view?</p>
<p>(SARA hands GRISSOM the photo she was looking at. Camera zooms in to the fingernails to show the white stripes.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Uh ...</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: They look like mees lines to me.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Could be livor mortis.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Or white striae, indicative of heavy metal poisoning.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We can't count on a photo to draw that kind of conclusion. We need the body.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY]</p>
<p>(SARA, GRISSOM and ROBBINS look at the empty table.)</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Fairmont had three gold crowns. They should've survived the cremation.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: At least partially. Heavy metal, after all.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: His wife ... had them removed at the mortuary. That adds new meaning to the phrase &quot;gold digger.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Actually, that's how the phrase got started. People used to dig up the bodies to extract the gold.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Now they just marry them. In some countries, this would be enough to have her arrested for murdering her husband.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What's the most important component in a poisoning.</p>
<p>(Hmmm ... trick question. SARA thinks about it.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Poison.</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: ER doc gave her a shot of hydropazeen ... sent her on her way.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hydropazeen? That's an antiemetic used to counteract heavy metal poisoning.</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Why would she do that?</p>
<p><strong>Claudia Gideon</strong>: (scoffs) Why would she hide my shampoo in my office?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What, you know she did that?</p>
<p><strong>Claudia Gideon</strong>: Well, it wasn't her husband. He was already dead. She's trying to frame me for killing him.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I mean, do you have anything beyond your suspicions that she did kill him?</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You mean since you yourself have been poisoned?</p>
<p><strong>Julia Fairmont</strong>: Yeah, why aren't you asking Claudia Richards about that? First my husband, then me?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Why would she want to kill either one of you?</p>

<p>(BRASS questions CLAUDIA GIDEON.)</p>
<p><strong>Claudia Gideon</strong>: I had to wash his grungy coffee mug every night. I had to clean his toenail clippings off of his desktop. Why would I ever ask Bob Fairmont to leave anyone for me?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, you think it was all in Mrs. Fairmont's head?</p>
<p><strong>Claudia Gideon</strong>: He always said she was crazy.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (scoffs) Okay, that's it. All right ... look, we're not leaving here till we get to the bottom of this.</p>

<p>(GRISSOM looks down at the Obituary for &quot;John Gideon, dies at 35&quot;.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: She donated his organs and cremated his body.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We don't have to chase down these organs. Ralph Parks rejected the organ that he got from Claudia's husband.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: An organ with a memory, maybe?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The most. Liver. </p>

<p>(NICK gives the printout to SARA. She looks at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: That's murder.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, well, it would have been murder for a 300-pound man.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: This is different than the shampoo compound.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, it contains polysorbate 80 and vitamin E. That combination's found in selenium supplements injected in animals.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Animals? Like cats, dogs?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mostly livestock, grazers.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: To make up for the lack of selenium nutrient in the soil. How did Claudia get access to this stuff?</p>

<p><strong>Claudia</strong>: We have never represented we didn't know each other previously.</p>
<p>Julia: And I wasn't playing. I was a hard-working secretary.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And you loved your husband Right up to the day he died ... of 240 milligrams of selenium.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Animal selenium, the kind used for cattle.</p>
<p><strong>Claudia</strong>: Well, we did live in grazing country although, I have to say, Julia knew more about livestock than I did. She rode horses.</p>
<p>(CLAUDIA smiles.) </p>
<p><strong>Julia</strong>: I took the job because Mr. G let me board my horse at the family stables.</p>
<p><strong>Claudia</strong>: Oh, I hated the stables. The smell. Never stepped foot in them.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Implicating you, the secretary.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: But the difference is that you actually loved Bob Fairmont. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: JULIA in bed with her husband. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>

<p>(The two women leave.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, no big surprise. We have proof of poison but no way to prove which one of them did it.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I like either one of them for the murder-- so will a jury.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: She-said/she-said defense? It's never going to fly. They'll raise each other as a viable suspect just like they did with us.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's what the D.A. said verbatim.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What are we doing? Digging up graves, chasing prints -- if it's no good in court ... if the killers win ...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It isn't a competition. We don't win. (SARA turns her head as GRISSOM continues.) The courts are like dice. They have no memory. What works one week doesn't work the next.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (nods and looks at GRISSOM.) I know that. I do. I know that. That's why I'm mad. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: But, see, if you get mad, then they do win.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You just said ... This is one of your riddles isn't it?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (gently) One of life's riddles ... (GRISSOM turns around to head back to the building. He turns back to SARA.) ... But, hey ... the good news? There's no statute of limitation on murder.</p>

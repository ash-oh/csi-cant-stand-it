<p>[EXT. RESIDENCE -- AFTERNOON]</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
(Outside the home, PETE'S Pluming and Piping van is parked in the driveway. Camera moves downward below the ground level and under the house.)</p>
<p>[INT. CRAWLSPACE UNDER THE HOUSE]</p>
<p>(Under the crawlspace of the house, the plumber carries his flashlight and crawls, examining the pipes for the leak.)</p>
<p><strong>Woman's Voice</strong>: (o.s.) What's taking so long? I just wanted you to fix the leak!</p>
<p><strong>Plumber</strong>: (looks up) Look, lady, to fix the leak I need to find the leak. (distracted)</p>
<p>(He continues to examine the pipes and crawls deeper under the house.)</p>
<p>(He crawls against the wall where his shirt catches on something, ripping the material. He stops.)</p>
<p><strong>Plumber</strong>: Hold on.</p>
<p>(He grunts as he shifts around to look at the wall. He turns up his flashlight)</p>
<p><strong>Woman's Voice</strong>: (o.s.) Did you find the leak?</p>
<p>(He brings his flashlight down and finds the bony tips of a skeleton embedded inside the foundation wall sticking out. He looks at it closely.)</p>
<p><strong>Plumber</strong>: I found something.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. RALSTON HOUSE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(NICK closes the car back door and carrying his kit, he heads for the house. He ducks under the crime scene tape toward the side of the house.)</p>
<p>[EXT. RALSTON HOUSE - SIDE YARD - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(NICK puts his kit down.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Okay, I'm ready up here. </p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CRAWLSPACE UNDER RALSTON HOUSE - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS</p>
<p>(Under the house, GRISSOM makes his way to the site.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hang on a minute. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM crawls up to the fingertips sticking out of the concrete.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Okay, I'm there.</p>
<p><strong>Nick (over radio)</strong>: Can you confirm it's human?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Metacarpal, phalanges ... no question about it. </p>
<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. RALSTON HOUSE - SIDE YARD - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks over to and around NICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hold on, Nick.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (sighs) There's got to be an easier way.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: When a body decomposes in concrete it leaves an air pocket, vacuum-sealed. We do this right, it'll open like a jar of pickles.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM starts to work on the bricks. When he breaks through into the air pocket, we hear the seal being broken.)</p>
<p>(They continue to break through the cement and finally get the hole wide enough to see the skeleton inside.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Ten bucks says the owner sells the house.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: By law, you got to disclose everything -- three bedrooms, two baths, and a skeleton.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - GRISSOM'S OFFICE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks into the room carrying the assignment sheets.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Okay, I'm late again. Nick's going to work with me on that unidentified body at Summercliff.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I hear it's just bones? What a rush.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: O.I.S. at the jockey club.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM holds out the assignment sheet. SARA stands up to get it from him.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Officer-involved shooting.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'll take a piece of that.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Good, I want you to double up. Listen, these deals are never easy so keep me informed, please.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Will do. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I drive.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Picture that.</p>
<p>(SARA and WARRICK leave the room. GRISSOM looks back down at the other assignment sheet in his hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, what do you have for me? I could use a rush.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM sits at the edge of the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, this qualifies: 4-26. But I can't give you the case.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Because?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Conflict of interest. The alleged rape victim is an exotic dancer.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (offended) Because I used to be one, I'll be biased?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No. Suspect's your ex-husband. (beat) He's asking for you, but you can't take it.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE stands up and looks at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Just let me do the prelim.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: All right. (He gives her the assignment sheet.) Do what you can. But after the preliminary, you pass it off, okay?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE doesn't say anything. She turns and leaves the room.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - OBSERVATION ROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks through the window at EDDIE WILLOWS, her ex-husband. He's sitting in front of the table, a tape recorder and microphone set up in front of him. She watches him for a long moment, then leaves the room.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(The door opens. CATHERINE walks inside.)</p>
<p><strong>Eddie Willows</strong>: (relieved) Thank god you're here.</p>
<p>(EDDIE gets to his feet. CATHERINE closes the door behind her.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Eddie.</p>
<p><strong>Eddie Willows</strong>: I didn't rape that girl.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE puts the open file folder on the table. She sits down.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: According to the police report she's telling a different story. I wonder what the rape kit's going to say.</p>
<p><strong>Eddie Willows</strong>: We had s*x, okay? But she was there with me one hundred percent. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks down at the file.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: In the parking lot behind the club.</p>
<p>(She looks back at EDDIE.)</p>
<p><strong>Eddie Willows</strong>: Well, some women like the outdoors.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Melanie know about this?</p>
<p><strong>Eddie Willows</strong>: Mel and I split up a while ago.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You might want to call her anyway. She can loan you the money for an attorney.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE picks up her bag, turns and heads for the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Eddie Willows</strong>: You're not going to help me? (yells) Cath, I am in a jam here!</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: A detective from s*x crimes has been assigned. I'm going to place another CSI.</p>
<p><strong>Eddie Willows</strong>: What about Lindsey?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE stops.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (puzzled) What about her?</p>
<p><strong>Eddie Willows</strong>: You want her spending sunday afternoons with me at Nevada State Prison ... or the mall?</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY]</p>
<p>(NICK and GRISSOM stand over the skeletal remains on the table between them.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Based on the auricular surface I'd say she died when she was about twenty.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: She?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's in the hips. Pelvic bone is definitely female. You know, for a ladies' man you don't know much about bone structure.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I know all I need to know. I figure she was killed before her cement bath.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, how?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: She was stabbed at least a dozen times -- a screwdriver, maybe ... like... a spike.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No. The gouges on her ribs are unusual. The instrument had to be ... slightly curved with some kind of serrated edge. Like crocodile teeth. Whatever killed this girl was not a traditional weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, stabbings are personal. She knew her attacker.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's the rule. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM leans in close to the head of the bones. He places a gentle hand on her skull.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Who are you?</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. PARKING LOT - STRIP CASINO HOTEL - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(WARRICK and SARA meet up with BRASS and the OFFICER, JOE TYNER.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Sara Sidle, Warrick Brown? Officer Joe Tyner.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p>(They shake hands.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer Joe Tyner</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Officer Tyner.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Joe Tyner</strong>: How you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Want to tell us what happened here tonight?</p>
<p>(BRASS answers the question.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: He responded to shots fired. The suspect fled the scene.</p>
<p>(WARRICK looks at OFFICER JOE TYNER.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Why don't you tell us what happened here.</p>
<p>(OFFICER JOE TYNER sighs.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: A speeding jeep, Nevada License #QLF 084, turns onto the main strip, tires screeching. The officer car right behind him.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer Joe Tyner</strong>: (to dispatch) Unit five. In pursuit of the fleeing 413 heading southbound on the strip.</p>
<p>(White flash to: The jeep turns off of the road and into a parking lot. The officer car follows. The jeep stops. The officer car stops. OFFICER JOE TYNER gets out of his car and draws his weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Joe Tyner</strong>: Get back in the car! </p>
<p>(The SUSPECT gets back into his jeep and closes the door. OFFICER JOE TYNER takes a step toward the jeep.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer Joe Tyner</strong>: Drop your keys to the ground! </p>
<p>(The SUSPECT drops the keys outside the jeep.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer Joe Tyner</strong>: Put your hands on the wheel!</p>
<p>(The SUSPECT puts both of his hands on the steering wheel.)</p>
<p><strong>Suspect</strong>: I didn't do it ... whatever you think I did! I'm looking at three strikes. I'm not going back. I'll show you my registration.</p>
<p>(The SUSPECT reaches for the glove compartment and opens it.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer Joe Tyner</strong>: No, put your hands on the wheel!</p>
<p>(The SUSPECT grabs a gun in the glove compartment, points it at his own head and fires.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer Joe Tyner</strong>: Then he turned the weapon on himself -- one shot -- right through the forehead.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Where's his gun?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Joe Tyner</strong>: I left it in the jeep.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'm going to go bag it.</p>
<p>(SARA heads for the jeep.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Officer, we're going to need your weapon, as well.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Joe Tyner</strong>: I never fired.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Drawn but not fired.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (shakes his head) It's just standard procedure.</p>
<p>(OFFICER JOE TYNER sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: It's okay. It's okay.</p>
<p>(OFFICER JOE TYNER takes out his weapon and hands it to WARRICK handle first.)</p>
<p>(SARA approaches the jeep and looks inside.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (o.s.) Were there any witnesses?</p>
<p>(She looks down at the body inside the front seat of the jeep. She takes the gun out of the SUSPECT'S hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (o.s.) We're going to need to seal off this lot.</p>
<p>(BRASS looks at WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Tyner told you what happened here. Whose side are you on?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: The officer told me a fleeing suspect committed suicide. I'm just verifying his account. You know how this works, Brass. Can we clear the jeep so I can do my job?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, at least test the dead guy's hands for gun residue.</p>
<p>(SARA steps up and joins them.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: At that proximity G.S.R.'S invalid. They'd both be covered, no matter who fired.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Can we get back to work?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(WARRICK turns and leaves. SARA stares at BRASS.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - GARAGE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The lights flicker on. GRISSOM stands in the middle of the garage over the large slab of rock that the skeletal remains were entombed in.)</p>
<p>(NICK walks in.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You brought the foundation of the house to our lab.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's a six-by-three-foot section. When the concrete dried it preserved a partial impression of our Jane Doe. Did you find out anything about the house?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I pulled the permits. Summercliff was built five years ago on nothing but desert.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That would explain why the body was so desiccated.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: House was sold subsequent to completion, so the homeowner isn't a suspect. Homicide is running a missing persons check.</p>
<p>(NICK reaches out to touch something. GRISSOM clears his throat to stop him. NICK stops mid-reach and looks at GRISSOM. NICK smiles and withdraws.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, if it wasn't for a leaky pipe she might have been down there forever.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I think our killer was counting on that.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM glances up at NICK, then turns back his attention to the slab in front of him.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - LAB - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(WARRICK is sitting at the lab table. SARA walks into the room behind him.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Why would a guy speed it all the way down the strip just to pull over and cap himself?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What are you getting at, Warrick?</p>
<p>(WARRICK puts the pen down and picks up the weapon in front of him. The one he was studying.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Officer's weapon: Smith and Wesson 5906.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Standard issue. </p>
<p>(WARRICK puts the gun down and lifts up the cartridge in his other hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: One bullet missing. Nothing standard about that.</p>
<p>(SARA takes it from WARRICK and looks at it. Camera close up of the bullets inside the cartridge.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Both gun's are nine millimeter automatics. Brass isn't going to like this.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I don't give a damn what Brass likes.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Like I do? If Tyner's dirty, he goes down. I just know what happens when you piss off the P.D.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, it's war.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - GRISSOM'S OFFICE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Camera close up of GRISSOM holding a tarantula in the palm of his hand. A woman walks up to the door and knocks on the frame lightly.)</p>
<p><strong>Teri Miller</strong>: Gil Grissom? </p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks up.)</p>
<p><strong>Teri Miller</strong>: Or should I call you spider-man?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's harmless.</p>
<p><strong>Teri Miller</strong>: Of course it is. </p>
<p>(TERI walks into the office, her eyes on the spider in GRISSOM'S hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Teri Miller</strong>: Orange-kneed tarantula. Nice specimen.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The tarantula's touch is very gentle.</p>
<p><strong>Teri Miller</strong>: It leaves no prints. They move without a trace. May I? </p>
<p>(TER holds out her hand and to GRISSOM'S astonishment, takes the tarantula in the palm of her hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Teri Miller</strong>: Ah ... </p>
<p>(TERI looks at the spider. GRISSOM stands up.)</p>
<p><strong>Teri Miller</strong>: Maybe I should introduce myself.</p>
<p>(She holds out her free hand to him. They shake hands.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Teri Miller does not need an introduction. (beat) I need you to make me a face.</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<hr />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(SARA and WARRICK interview OFFICER JOE TYNER.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer Joe Tyner</strong>: (annoyed) I didn't kill him. That's what I told I.A. It's what I told my superior. It's what I'm telling you.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Officer Tyner, your gun -- there's a bullet missing from the magazine.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Joe Tyner</strong>: I don't top off. I know it's against regulation, but the 14th bullet puts pressure on the spring, and the gun can jam.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Can anyone confirm your story?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Joe Tyner</strong>: (surges to his feet) It's not a story! </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Whoa.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Joe Tyner</strong>: And no ... I don't tell people how I carry. </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Do you? </p>
<p><strong>Officer Joe Tyner</strong>: Check the other magazines.</p>
<p>(BRASS walks into the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What the hell's going on here?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We're just having a talk with Officer Tyner here.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Next time, don't start without me. I'm the union rep on this one.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Then you should know. Tyner's magazine -- one bullet shy.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Is the expended round still missing?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah. It's not in the body, bullet's a round point wound was a through-and-through.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Joe Tyner</strong>: I did not fire a single round.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: And, with a record like yours we're supposed to just take you at your word?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Five civilian complaints -- three for excessive force. Two I.A. investigations.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Joe Tyner</strong>: I was cleared.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'm sure you were.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Joe Tyner</strong>: What is that supposed to mean? I don't have to take this crap!</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Tyner ... sit down, sit down. What you do need is for these guys to go out and find the missing bullet. </p>

<p>(TERI works on the mold on the slab of foundation in the middle of the garage. GRISSOM watches her work.)</p>
<p><strong>Teri Miller</strong>: It's like a human jell-o mold. The impression's only a partial. It's not going to be easy.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: They told me you were the top forensic artist in the country. </p>
<p><strong>Teri Miller</strong>: And Canada. I didn't say I couldn't do it. </p>
<p>(TERI turns and brings out a pail.)</p>
<p><strong>Teri Miller</strong>: Give me your hand. You'll enjoy this. It's as much science as art.</p>
<p>(Using GRISSOM'S hand, she guides him as he takes a scoop of the molding substance and puts it in the indentation in the foundation slab.)</p>
<p>(He continues to work. TERI takes the pail and lifts it to pour the rest of molding substance into the foundation.)</p>
<p>(Dissolve to: The molding substance solidifies and TERI removes it. She takes it over to the lamp and works on it. GRISSOM looks over her shoulder.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It doesn't really look like anything.</p>
<p><strong>Teri Miller</strong>: No light, no shadows -- no shadows, no perspective. </p>
<p>(She tilts the small sample and the impressions of a face can be seen.)</p>
<p><strong>Teri Miller</strong>: Now look.</p>
<p>(Dissolve to: TERI is sitting at the table with the head and half mold in front of her. GRISSOM takes the seat next to her.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So teach me.</p>
<p><strong>Teri Miller</strong>: Okay. First, I'm finishing off the plaster mold. We can't give her life with only half a face. Although most faces appear that way and the thin layer of slip makes the plaster and clay appear seamless. </p>
<p>(TERI takes GRISSOM'S hands and guides him as he helps apply the plaster mold.)</p>
<p>(Dissolve to: TERI finishes &quot;painting&quot; the face of the head in front of them.)</p>
<p><strong>Teri Miller</strong>: Her cheekbones and nasal spine indicate nordic descent. I've seen a few Norwegian brunettes but your girl's probably a blonde.</p>
<p>(TERI takes a blonde-colored wig and puts it on the head in front of them.)</p>
<p>(Dissolve to: TERI looks at a couple of brown eyes.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Brown eyes? I thought you decided she was nordic.</p>
<p>(TERI puts the eyes in the &quot;head&quot;.)</p>
<p><strong>Teri Miller</strong>: But, in this country, brown is a dominant eye color. And, more importantly, brown photographs better. You want to get her face out there, don't you?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah. I'm sure someone needs closure and somebody else needs to go to jail.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Ma'am, my name is Gil Grissom. This is Nick Stokes.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>Jason Hendler</strong>: (steps out from the back of the room) Honey, who's out there?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mr. Hendler, we're criminalists from the Las Vegas police department.</p>
<p><strong>Amy Hendler</strong>: What's this about?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We're investigating the disappearance of Fay Green. May we come in?</p>
<p>(AMY HENDLER turns around to look at her husband. He motions them inside.)</p>

<p>(JASON HENDLER leads them to the living room. He turns around and looks at GRISSOM. NICK looks around the place.) </p>
<p><strong>Jason Hendler</strong>: (quietly) Did you find her?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yes, I'm afraid we did. She'd been dead for quite a while.</p>
<p><strong>Jason Hendler</strong>: Hmm. (barely under his breath) You always hope ...</p>
<p>(AMY doesn't say anything.)</p>
<p>GRISSOM; Mr. Hendler ... would it be possible for us to look around?</p>
<p><strong>Jason Hendler</strong>: Fay only lived here for about a month, five years ago. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at him waiting for an answer.) </p>
<p><strong>Jason Hendler</strong>: I've got nothing to hide.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>(NICK walks around the group and into the living room. GRISSOM stands in the hallway, thoughtful. He walks down the hallway and into the room. That's where he finds the large fish tank. He leans in and looks at it.)</p>
<p>(AMY and JASON HENDLER follow GRISSOM. NICK enters the room also.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: A trigger and a lionfish.</p>
<p><strong>Jason Hendler</strong>: Yeah, that's right.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Interesting choices. Violent, carnivorous predators.</p>
<p>(As NICK walks around the room, looking about, the floor squeaks. GRISSOM immediately notices the sound and turns to look.)</p>
<p><strong>Jason Hendler</strong>: It's just a warped floorboard.</p>
<p><strong>Amy Hendler</strong>: It's been like that forever.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mr. Hendler, at any time, was your fish tank over here?</p>
<p><strong>Jason Hendler</strong>: Maybe, a while ago. Why?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did it ever overflow? (beat) Break?</p>
<p><strong>Jason Hendler</strong>: Not that I recall.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You said I could look anywhere, right?</p>
<p><strong>Jason Hendler</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to NICK) Got a pocket knife?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM kneels down and starts to pry the floorboard up and off.)</p>
<p><strong>Jason Hendler</strong>: What are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to JASON HENDLER) Pops out, pops in. </p>
<p>(NICK and GRISSOM look under the floorboard. He finds sand.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to NICK) What do you find inside an hourglass? </p>
<p>(GRISSOM stands up.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mr. Hendler, I think the tank was over here. I think it broke. I think you got water and artificial sand all over the place.</p>
<p><strong>Jason Hendler</strong>: I'd like you fellows to leave now, please.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Fine, we'll go. We'll be back ... with a warrant.</p>

[INT. CSI - DNA LAB]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks into the lab.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, Greg, what did the rape kit say?</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Nonoxynol-9, polyvinyl alcohol, and...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Glycerin?</p>
<p>(GREG looks up from the results, surprised that CATHERINE got it.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(She holds up the box.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It's a contraceptive film. (She points to the mug in his hand.)<br />
What are you drinking?</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Chamomile.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: May I?</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Sure.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE takes the mug from GREG and removes the tea bag inside. She pours the liquid into a glass container.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: So you used to work at the French Palace?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: That's right.</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: You know, my friends and I used to go there.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Really?</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Payday fridays.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Maybe I saw you perform?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (sighs) Oh, I doubt it.</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: Why?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks at GREG.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You would have remembered. </p>
<p>(GREG looks absolutely stunned. CATHERINE turns her attention back to the experiment. She removes one of the contraceptive films and dips it into the heated liquid.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, this film-- it's kind of hard to detect because it dissolves with body heat. And, as you know, Greg, s*x can make a body pretty hot.</p>
<p>(They wait for the film to dissolve.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: This stuff has to be inserted fifteen minutes to three hours before s*x.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Which means that April inserted the film while she was still at work.</p>
<p><strong>Greg Sanders</strong>: But how could she have known to put the birth control in before she was raped?</p>
<p>CATHERINE Exactly.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE drops the film and forceps into the glass container, stands up and walks out of the lab.)</p>
<p>(GREG lifts up the VCF box and looks at the back of it.)</p>

<p>(NICK and GRISSOM walk through the hallway)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Guess where Jason Hendler was employed five years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Summercliff Housing Development. A plumber, perhaps?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Close. A subcontractor. How did you know?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Why else would you be so excited? </p>
<p>(TERI MILLER walks through the hallway pulling her bags behind her. GRISSOM looks up and sees her.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hey! You weren't going to say good-bye to me?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I'll meet you outside. Hi, Teri.</p>
<p><strong>Teri Miller</strong>: Thought I'd let you off easy. But I did tack up my number on your big fish corkboard ... under &quot;cold cases.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The ones that got away.</p>
<p><strong>Teri Miller</strong>: Let's hope not.</p>

[INT. CSI - GARAGE]</p>
<p>(WARRICK and SARA show BRASS what they discovered.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So, check it out ... the laser is the path of the bullet. If you were Officer Tyner and you approached the suspect from the driver's side of the vehicle ... </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Vic was shot in the frontal lobe through the windshield. There's no way I could shoot the guy from here and mimic that trajectory.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: The laws of physics trump the eye witness. There's only one way this could've gone down.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: That night. The SUSPECT reaches for the glove compartment and opens it.)</p>
<p><strong>Suspect</strong>: I'll show you my registration!</p>
<p><strong>Officer Tyner</strong>: Put your hands on the wheel!</p>
<p>(The SUSPECT reaches for the gun inside. He pulls it out and shoots himself in the forehead.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Officer Tyner was telling the truth.</p>
<p>(cc) BRASS: And that's a surprise? </p>
<p>(cc) SARA: Ease up. Until now, none of us knew what really happened.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So I bet you think I owe you one, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We work. We get paid. You don't owe me anything.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (smirks) Fine with me. </p>
<p>(He turns and leaves the garage. SARA shakes her head and sighs.)</p>

<p><strong>April Lewis</strong>: He promised me a million things. I got tired of him lying.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Like what -- marriage, kids?</p>
<p><strong>April Lewis</strong>: Music videos. He kept telling me he'd put me in one but he never delivered.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And for that you set him up for rape?</p>
<p>(APRIL sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>April Lewis</strong>: No, it wasn't supposed to go this far, okay? I got this friend over at the trop. She got this high roller on a rape charge. He paid a ton to make it go away.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Wait a minute. You think that Eddie's got money?</p>
<p><strong>April Lewis</strong>: He is in the music business.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: He reps some bands off-strip.</p>
<p><strong>April Lewis</strong>: (disbelieving) No, I met a producer friend of his from L.A. and he's always throwing money around this place. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE starts to laugh. APRIL is puzzled by CATHERINE'S behavior. She turns to look at CATHERINE.)</p>

[INT. JASON HENDLER'S RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes the floorboard off. The HENDLERS watch. GRISSOM looks under the floorboard and doesn't find the sand there anymore.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I see you've cleaned house. I thought you might.</p>
<p><strong>Jason Hendler</strong>: I vacuumed up the sand. Big deal. Will you at least tell me what you're doing here?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm working, sir. Officer, would you hit the lights, please?</p>
<p>(The top light turn off. GRISSOM sprays the floors.)</p>
<p>JASON HENDLER You're getting my floor wet.</p>
<p>(NICK enters the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: It's luminol, sir. It dries quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Surface is non-reactive.</p>
<p><strong>Jason Hendler</strong>: I know what you're doing. You're looking for blood.</p>
<p><strong>Amy Hendler</strong>: My husband didn't do anything. Why are you harassing him?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Let's try the ALS.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Why use the Alternate Light Source if the luminol didn't pick up anything?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Luminol works on the surface. ALS chases the protein molecules in blood. It actually penetrates the wood. These floorboards are all made of maple -- high-end-but they've been lacquered.</p>
<p>(They look at each other.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Who lacquers maple unless they're trying to hide something?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah. </p>
<p>(NICK turns on the ALS and sweeps the floor. They find glowing spots of blood drops and hand prints on the floorboards. GRISSOM stands up for a better look.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Turn it off, Nick. Officer, hit the lights, please. </p>
<p>(The top room lights turn on.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mr. Hendler let me tell you what I think happened to Fay. On the night of her disappearance, the two of you got in a heated argument.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: JASON HENDLER and FAY GREEN arguing and fighting.)</p>
<p><strong>Fay Green</strong>: Don't you walk away from me!</p>
<p>(JASON grabs FAY. She pulls away and goes head first into the large fish tank, water spills everywhere. FAY falls to the floor.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Suffering a concussion, Fay falls to the floor. In the heat of the moment you decide to make it final. But Fay surprises you: She fights back. She pushes you off. She crawls a few feet away and you move in for the final attack. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The fish tank breaks. FAY is on the floor. JASON HENDLER is above her, hitting her with the hand tool. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: One thing that I don't know, though. What did you use to kill her?</p>
<p><strong>Jason Hendler</strong>: I didn't kill her.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, whatever the weapon it wasn't a knife, but it worked. You drove her body over to Summercliff where you were employed and you buried her in wet concrete.</p>
<p><strong>Jason Hendler</strong>: I worked the Summercliff job less than a week. Ask Amy. She worked for the same contractor.</p>
<p><strong>Amy Hendler</strong>: That's right. He got a better job in Reno. Jason wasn't even in Vegas when Fay disappeared.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: And you painted the floors, covered your tracks for what, aesthetic reasons?</p>
<p>(AMY sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Five years is a long time but eventually the past catches up to everybody.</p>
<p><strong>Jason Hendler</strong>: (insistent) I didn't kill Fay! I loved her. I STILL love her.</p>
<p>(JASON stops when he realizes what he just said. Everyone freezes. JASON turns around to look at AMY, who shakes her head in denial.)</p>
<p><strong>Jason Hendler</strong>: Amy, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Amy Hendler</strong>: You still love her?</p>
<p>(He looks at her and sighs. He doesn't deny it.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Officer, would you please arrest Mr. Hendler?</p>
<p>(A couple of officers walk into the room to handcuff JASON HENDLER.)</p>
<p><strong>Jason Hendler</strong>: Call my father. He'll get a lawyer. I didn't do it. It's okay.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to NICK) I'll ride along with the cops. Bring homicide up to speed. This is now a fresh crime scene.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM heads out.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I'll get to work.</p>
<p>(NICK looks over at AMY who stands in the room, stunned.)</p>
<p>(NICK leaves the room to get his things. In the next room, NICK reaches for his gloves. As he puts them on, his eyes latch onto the framed photos hanging on the wall. He looks at them absently, but something in one of the photos catches his eyes.)</p>
<p>(It's a black and white photo of a couple of people wearing mountain climbing gear. He remembers what GRISSOM told him in the autopsy room.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) &quot;The instrument had to be slightly curved with some kind of serrated edge like crocodile teeth...&quot;</p>
<p>(The camera moves in slowly to the climbing picks in the mountain climbers' hands. NICK realizes what the murder weapon is.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (eyes glued to the photo) Mrs. Hendler, do you and your husband do much rock climbing?</p>
<p>(The gun cocks.)</p>
<p><strong>Amy Hendler</strong>: (o.s.) Yes. </p>

<p><strong>Jason Hendler</strong>: I can prove I was in Reno when Fay disappeared. I've got records. You don't want to talk, fine. But I've got a question for you. Why do you care so much about the floors? I mean, Amy paints them every spring. It's no big deal.</p>

<p>(While FAY is on the floor, AMY reaches for the mountain climbing pick and beats FAY with it.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Amy Hendler</strong>: There was blood ... everywhere. No one else could see it ... but I knew it was there. A dead body is so heavy.</p>
<p>(NICK nods his head, tears in his own eyes.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Mrs. Hendler, I'm a good listener. (swallows) You got to give me the gun.</p>
<p><strong>Amy Hendler</strong>: (cries) I can't! (whispers) I'm sorry.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No, wait.</p>
<p><strong>Amy Hendler</strong>: But you arrested my husband.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Wait!</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Nick, don't move.</p>
<p>(AMY HENDLER holds the shaking gun on GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Please. I don't want to fire my gun any more than you do. For five years, you've been washing the blood off your hands. (She starts crying.)<br />
Let's put down the guns.</p>
<p>(AMY slowly lowers the gun. GRISSOM slowly walks toward her. NICK sees that it's going to be all right and turns around, his back to everyone.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes the gun from AMY.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You okay, Nick?</p>
<p>(NICK turns to look at GRISSOM.)</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You're welcome. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE takes off her sunglasses and looks at EDDIE.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I don't think that's such a good idea, though.</p>
<p>(EDDIE nods.)</p>
<p><strong>Eddie Willows</strong>: Cath, when are we going to talk about what happened between us?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What's to talk about? You cheated on me. I caught you. I've got a new life.</p>

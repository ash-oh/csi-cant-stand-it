Woman's Voice:  What's taking so long? I just wanted you to fix the leak!
Plumber: 


Plumber: Hold on.

Woman's Voice:  Did you find the leak?

Plumber: I found something.

Nick: Okay, I'm ready up here.

[INT. CRAWLSPACE UNDER RALSTON HOUSE - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS

Grissom: Hang on a minute. 

Grissom: Okay, I'm there.
Nick : Can you confirm it's human?
Grissom: Metacarpal, phalanges ... no question about it. 
SHORT TIME CUT TO:



Grissom: Hold on, Nick.
Nick:  There's got to be an easier way.
Grissom: When a body decomposes in concrete it leaves an air pocket, vacuum-sealed. We do this right, it'll open like a jar of pickles.


Nick: Ten bucks says the owner sells the house.
Grissom: By law, you got to disclose everything -- three bedrooms, two baths, and a skeleton.
HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS


FADE IN.



Grissom: Okay, I'm late again. Nick's going to work with me on that unidentified body at Summercliff.
Sara: I hear it's just bones? What a rush.
Grissom: O.I.S. at the jockey club.

Sara: Officer-involved shooting.
Warrick: I'll take a piece of that.
Grissom: Good, I want you to double up. Listen, these deals are never easy so keep me informed, please.
Warrick: Will do. 
Sara: I drive.
Warrick: Picture that.

Catherine: So, what do you have for me? I could use a rush.

Grissom: Well, this qualifies: 4-26. But I can't give you the case.
Catherine: Because?
Grissom: Conflict of interest. The alleged rape victim is an exotic dancer.
Catherine:  Because I used to be one, I'll be biased?
Grissom: No. Suspect's your ex-husband.  He's asking for you, but you can't take it.

Catherine: Just let me do the prelim.
Grissom: All right.  Do what you can. But after the preliminary, you pass it off, okay?

CUT TO:



Eddie Willows:  Thank god you're here.

Catherine: Eddie.
Eddie Willows: I didn't rape that girl.

Catherine: According to the police report she's telling a different story. I wonder what the rape kit's going to say.
Eddie Willows: We had s*x, okay? But she was there with me one hundred percent. 

Catherine: In the parking lot behind the club.

Eddie Willows: Well, some women like the outdoors.
Catherine: Melanie know about this?
Eddie Willows: Mel and I split up a while ago.
Catherine: You might want to call her anyway. She can loan you the money for an attorney.

Eddie Willows: You're not going to help me?  Cath, I am in a jam here!
Catherine: A detective from s*x crimes has been assigned. I'm going to place another CSI.
Eddie Willows: What about Lindsey?

Catherine:  What about her?
Eddie Willows: You want her spending sunday afternoons with me at Nevada State Prison ... or the mall?
CUT TO:



Grissom: Based on the auricular surface I'd say she died when she was about twenty.
Nick: She?
Grissom: It's in the hips. Pelvic bone is definitely female. You know, for a ladies' man you don't know much about bone structure.
Nick: I know all I need to know. I figure she was killed before her cement bath.
Grissom: Yeah, how?
Nick: She was stabbed at least a dozen times -- a screwdriver, maybe ... like... a spike.
Grissom: No. The gouges on her ribs are unusual. The instrument had to be ... slightly curved with some kind of serrated edge. Like crocodile teeth. Whatever killed this girl was not a traditional weapon.
Nick: Well, stabbings are personal. She knew her attacker.
Grissom: That's the rule. 

Grissom: Who are you?
CUT TO:



Brass: Sara Sidle, Warrick Brown? Officer Joe Tyner.
Sara: Hi.

Officer Joe Tyner: Hi.
Warrick: Officer Tyner.
Officer Joe Tyner: How you doing?
Warrick: Want to tell us what happened here tonight?

Brass: He responded to shots fired. The suspect fled the scene.

Warrick: Why don't you tell us what happened here.


Officer Joe Tyner:  Unit five. In pursuit of the fleeing 413 heading southbound on the strip.
(White flash to: The jeep turns off of the road and into a parking lot. The officer car follows. The jeep stops. The officer car stops. OFFICER JOE TYNER gets out of his car and draws his weapon.
Officer Joe Tyner: Get back in the car! 

Officer Joe Tyner: Drop your keys to the ground! 

Officer Joe Tyner: Put your hands on the wheel!

Suspect: I didn't do it ... whatever you think I did! I'm looking at three strikes. I'm not going back. I'll show you my registration.

Officer Joe Tyner: No, put your hands on the wheel!


Officer Joe Tyner: Then he turned the weapon on himself -- one shot -- right through the forehead.
Sara: Where's his gun?
Officer Joe Tyner: I left it in the jeep.
Sara: I'm going to go bag it.

Warrick: Officer, we're going to need your weapon, as well.
Officer Joe Tyner: I never fired.
Brass: Drawn but not fired.
Warrick:  It's just standard procedure.

Brass: It's okay. It's okay.


Warrick:  Were there any witnesses?

Warrick:  We're going to need to seal off this lot.

Brass: Tyner told you what happened here. Whose side are you on?
Warrick: The officer told me a fleeing suspect committed suicide. I'm just verifying his account. You know how this works, Brass. Can we clear the jeep so I can do my job?
Brass: Well, at least test the dead guy's hands for gun residue.

Sara: At that proximity G.S.R.'S invalid. They'd both be covered, no matter who fired.
Warrick: Can we get back to work?
Brass: Yeah.

CUT TO:




Nick: You brought the foundation of the house to our lab.
Grissom: It's a six-by-three-foot section. When the concrete dried it preserved a partial impression of our Jane Doe. Did you find out anything about the house?
Nick: I pulled the permits. Summercliff was built five years ago on nothing but desert.
Grissom: That would explain why the body was so desiccated.
Nick: House was sold subsequent to completion, so the homeowner isn't a suspect. Homicide is running a missing persons check.

Grissom: Well, if it wasn't for a leaky pipe she might have been down there forever.
Nick: I think our killer was counting on that.

CUT TO:



Sara: Hey.
Warrick: Why would a guy speed it all the way down the strip just to pull over and cap himself?
Sara: What are you getting at, Warrick?

Warrick: Officer's weapon: Smith and Wesson 5906.
Sara: Standard issue. 

Warrick: One bullet missing. Nothing standard about that.

Sara: Both gun's are nine millimeter automatics. Brass isn't going to like this.
Warrick: I don't give a damn what Brass likes.
Sara: Like I do? If Tyner's dirty, he goes down. I just know what happens when you piss off the P.D.
Warrick: Yeah, it's war.
CUT TO:



Teri Miller: Gil Grissom? 

Teri Miller: Or should I call you spider-man?
Grissom: It's harmless.
Teri Miller: Of course it is. 

Teri Miller: Orange-kneed tarantula. Nice specimen.
Grissom: The tarantula's touch is very gentle.
Teri Miller: It leaves no prints. They move without a trace. May I? 

Teri Miller: Ah ... 

Teri Miller: Maybe I should introduce myself.

Grissom: Teri Miller does not need an introduction.  I need you to make me a face.
FADE TO BLACK.


FADE IN.



Officer Joe Tyner:  I didn't kill him. That's what I told I.A. It's what I told my superior. It's what I'm telling you.
Sara: Officer Tyner, your gun -- there's a bullet missing from the magazine.
Officer Joe Tyner: I don't top off. I know it's against regulation, but the 14th bullet puts pressure on the spring, and the gun can jam.
Warrick: Can anyone confirm your story?
Officer Joe Tyner:  It's not a story! 
Sara: Whoa.
Officer Joe Tyner: And no ... I don't tell people how I carry. 
Warrick: Do you? 
Officer Joe Tyner: Check the other magazines.

Brass: What the hell's going on here?
Warrick: We're just having a talk with Officer Tyner here.
Brass: Next time, don't start without me. I'm the union rep on this one.
Sara: Then you should know. Tyner's magazine -- one bullet shy.
Brass: Is the expended round still missing?
Sara: Yeah. It's not in the body, bullet's a round point wound was a through-and-through.
Officer Joe Tyner: I did not fire a single round.
Sara: And, with a record like yours we're supposed to just take you at your word?
Warrick: Five civilian complaints -- three for excessive force. Two I.A. investigations.
Officer Joe Tyner: I was cleared.
Warrick: I'm sure you were.
Officer Joe Tyner: What is that supposed to mean? I don't have to take this crap!
Brass: Tyner ... sit down, sit down. What you do need is for these guys to go out and find the missing bullet. 

Brass: So what are you waiting for?
Warrick: I guess it's a good thing I sealed off that crime scene.

CUT TO:



Teri Miller: It's like a human jell-o mold. The impression's only a partial. It's not going to be easy.
Grissom: They told me you were the top forensic artist in the country. 
Teri Miller: And Canada. I didn't say I couldn't do it. 

Teri Miller: Give me your hand. You'll enjoy this. It's as much science as art.



Grissom: It doesn't really look like anything.
Teri Miller: No light, no shadows -- no shadows, no perspective. 

Teri Miller: Now look.

Grissom: So teach me.
Teri Miller: Okay. First, I'm finishing off the plaster mold. We can't give her life with only half a face. Although most faces appear that way and the thin layer of slip makes the plaster and clay appear seamless. 


Teri Miller: Her cheekbones and nasal spine indicate nordic descent. I've seen a few Norwegian brunettes but your girl's probably a blonde.


Grissom: Brown eyes? I thought you decided she was nordic.

Teri Miller: But, in this country, brown is a dominant eye color. And, more importantly, brown photographs better. You want to get her face out there, don't you?
Grissom: Yeah. I'm sure someone needs closure and somebody else needs to go to jail.

Teri Miller: There she is.

CUT TO:



Paula Francis:  As we first reported yesterday, the remains of an unidentified caucasian female were unearthed in Summercliff. The five foot four inch woman was approximately 20 years old.

Nick: Here you go.
Paula Francis:  Authorities are asking for the public's help in identifying the victim. 

Paula Francis:  If you have any information please call the Las Vegas P.D. Hotline.

Catherine: Hotlines ... hit or miss.
Grissom: I don't know. In my experience people usually remember a beautiful woman. 

Grissom: Uh, Nick, weren't you going to go and do the, uh... 

Grissom: At the ... ?

Nick: Yeah. Yeah, okay, I'll do that.

Catherine: So I saw Eddie. He actually... seemed scared.
Grissom: Did that make you happy?
Catherine: Um ... no. I'm not really sure what I ... feel.
Grissom: You're not still in love with Eddie?  Catherine, you have to hand off the case. Warrick can just double up.


David Phillips: Uh ... Grissom, Dr. Robbins wants to see you. Something about your skeleton.

Grissom: Okay. You have to pass off the case. If you compromise the investigation there's no going back. You could hurt Eddie just as much as you could help him.

CUT TO:



Grissom: Hey. I've already seen the marks on the ribs.
Dr. Albert Robbins: Uh-huh, but did you see the hairline fracture on the posterior skull?
Grissom: No.


Dr. Albert Robbins: Easy to miss, but it screams blunt-force trauma. Also, the middle ear has three bones. They're dusted with sodium and lodged against the malleus. I found a tiny ball of earwax with grains of sand.
Grissom: Salt and sand. Killed at the beach?
Dr. Albert Robbins: Not ruling it out.

Nick: Grissom. Hey, doc. Hotline's lit up. Five callers all I.D.'D the same woman -- Fay Green -- and her mother just confirmed.

CUT TO:


Mrs. Green:  I need to know what happened to my daughter.

GRISSOM We're trying to figure that out for you. 

Grissom: She was quite an athlete, huh?
Mrs. Green: Mm-hmm. Yeah.
Grissom: Did she scuba dive?
Mrs. Green: She had just been certified.
Grissom: Did, uh, Fay ... before she disappeared, go on any vacation? Go diving or spend time at the beach?
Mrs. Green: No, not that I recall. No.
Grissom: And she, uh ... lived here with you until she disappeared?
Mrs. Green: No, she had just moved in with her boyfriend, Jason Hendler. He still lives on Medley Place.
Grissom: And the, uh ... police interviewed him after she disappeared?
Mrs. Green: A couple of times. He had nothing to do with this.
Grissom: Well, how do you know that?
Mrs. Green: He loved my daughter. He was good to her.
Grissom: Did they... ever fight?
Mrs. Green: The first few months of a relationship nobody fights. 

Mrs. Green:  She was crazy about him.

CUT TO:



April Lewis:  I've given Eddie Willows twenty lap dances. He never got rough till last night.
Det. B. Evans: In the parking lot.
April Lewis: Yeah, he asked me to go for drinks you know, but out in the parking lot he starts kissing on me and I kind of laughed it off, but ... then he grabbed me and he slams me against the wall and... that pig.

Catherine: Hi. 

Catherine: Evans, I'm sorry I'm late. I'm Catherine ...  ... just Catherine. I'm a forensic scientist.
April Lewis: Scientist ... wow. You look so normal.
Catherine: Thanks.
Det. B. Evans:  Catherine, you sure want ... ?
Catherine: Yeah. 

Catherine: Those bruises from last night?
April Lewis: Yeah. A guy pinned me against a wall.
Catherine: Sexual assault nurse collect a kit yet?
Det. B. Evans: She just finished.
Catherine: Why don't you see if you can catch her. I'd like her to get a sample from under her fingernails.

April Lewis:  Uh ... what kind of sample?
Catherine: Anything that might, show up from a ... a struggle.
April Lewis: You'd think what that nurse took down below would be enough. The weird thing is ... I liked the guy.
CUT TO:



Sara: It's not here.
Warrick: Bullets just don't disappear.

Sara: Excuse me. No one's allowed inside the tape.
Valet: I saw what happened.

Warrick: Have you talked to the police?
Valet:  Police make me nervous. You guys aren't cops, are you?
Warrick: We're Crime Scene Investigators. We need to know what you saw.
Valet: I was kind of taking a break, hanging out at the P.T. Cruiser. I was laid back in the heated driver's seat when I heard the siren.

Officer Joe Tyner:  Put your hands on the wheel!
Suspect:  I didn't do it ... 

Suspect: ... whatever you think I did! Man, I'm looking at three strikes. 
(JERROD opens his car door and gets out of the car.
Suspect: ... I'm not going back. Just let me show you my registration.
Officer Joe Tyner: No! Hands on the wheel!


Warrick: And, just like that, the officer fired?
Valet: Just like that.
Sara: Missing bullet, eyewitness ... we better tell Grissom we got a war.
FADE TO BLACK.

FADE IN.



Grissom: I heard about your eyewitness. A valet who joyrides. He sounds reliable.  So, uh, how's the thing going on Eddie Willows?
Warrick: What thing?
Grissom: The thing that I told Catherine to pass off to you.
Warrick:  Oh, good. Um ... we just put some stuff through the lab.
Grissom: Get ahold of the DMV?
Warrick: I was just about to.

Grissom: Warrick? Why would you call the DMV on a rape charge?

Catherine: Okay. I didn't hand it off.
Grissom: Really?
Catherine: I'm sorry, Warrick.
Warrick: If you want me to suave anyone, I got to know the shot.
Catherine: I know. 

Catherine:  I'm sorry. 

Catherine: I'm doing this for Lindsey.
Grissom: You so much as breathe on the evidence, it's contaminated and I end up the bad guy.
Catherine: Eyes, no hands.
Grissom: What's the status?
Catherine: Skin samples from under the woman's fingernails are consistent with Ed's. I saw some bruises but Eddie's style has always been very ... involved ... vigorous.
Grissom:  Vigorous?

Warrick: She's trying to tell you Eddie likes it rough.
Catherine: Thank you, Warrick. Eddie said that she was into it.
Grissom: &quot;He said. She said?&quot; It's about the evidence, Catherine. 
 
Grissom: And you may not like where it takes you.

CUT TO:




Greg Sanders: So how many grains of sand in the ocean, huh?
Nick: I don't care about the ocean, just the sand in my skeleton. Can you pinpoint a beach?
GREG SANDERS; I don't know. I might have to do some field research.  Hey, you think Grissom would send me to Hawaii?

Nick: Why don't you ask him yourself?
Grissom: Ask me what?

Greg Sanders: Oh, nothing. I, uh ... I was just telling Nick about your sand. Well, it's not sand. It's not natural anyway. Here, check this out.

Greg Sanders: Now, if this were natural sand, the surface would be smooth. 

Greg Sanders:  This looks more like Fremont Street on a Saturday night ... rough.
Nick: Could the particles be sediment from the concrete where we found her?
Greg Sanders: No. No way. I analyzed the mineral content. It's feldspar and quartz. That's crushed gray sandstone. It's man-made, in a rock crusher.
Nick: What does that mean?
Grissom: It means she wasn't killed in Hawaii. 
(GREG freezes at being busted and slowly turns to look at GRISSOM. 
Grissom: Other than that ... he has no idea.

CUT TO:



Brass: Is this payback, Warrick? Is that what this is? I was tough on you, so Officer Tyner takes my heat?
Warrick: That's how you think I work?

Sara: Brass, this has nothing to do with anything.
Brass: D.A. is filing charges. On the testimony of a bleary-eyed car jockey who was 40 feet from the jeep.

Sara: Eyewitness is a bonus: Your cop's magazine was one bullet shy.

Officer Joe Tyner: That's you CSIs, always counting bullets.

Warrick: What's he doing here?

Brass: Joe, you shouldn't be here.
Officer Joe Tyner: You show up with your latex gloves and your little fancy metal boxes ... your little powders ... you have no idea what it's like to put your life on the line every day!

Warrick: Oh, you mean dealing with punk-ass cops who hide behind their union reps?

Sara: Wow, wow guys. Get off him. BRASS: Hey! Hey! Joe!


Warrick:  You're just a psycho! You don't deserve a badge!
(OFFICER TYNER breaks from BRASS and heads for WARRICK. He reaches WARRICK and finds GRISSOM in his face.
Grissom: Cut it out! Not in my lab, pal.
Officer Tyner: Scientists! I bet you've never even drawn your weapon.
Grissom: Yeah. I hope I never have to. Nick, walk this guy out the door.
Nick: Now, let's go.

Grissom: Sara.
Sara: Yeah. Come on, Warrick. Come on. Let's go.

Brass:  This is your fault, Gil. Your nose is so far down a microscope you have no idea what your people are doing.
Grissom: Yeah, I know one thing: My guys will not bend and they will not be intimidated.
Brass: Hey, I sat in your chair. Your guys have one job: To find the evidence. So where the hell is the missing bullet? Huh?


CUT TO:



Catherine: Eddie.
Eddie Willows: Catherine.  I'll take a root beer.
Waitress: Sure.
Catherine: What are you doing here?
Eddie Willows: I knew you'd be here. You got a routine: Turkey club, no bacon.
Catherine: You could be a detective. Thank you.
Waitress: You're welcome.
Catherine:  Well, you obviously made bail. Did you get a lawyer?
Eddie Willows: I got you and The Truth. Who needs a lawyer? 

Eddie Willows:  I came to tell you how great you are. It always comes out wrong. When I married you, I married up. I know that.
Catherine:  It wasn't all bad.

CUT TO:



Sara: You think the bullet's somewhere in the jeep.
Warrick: It's not in the body. It's not at the crime scene. I like our odds.
Sara: Let's do it. 




SHORT TIME CUT TO:

Sara: We have searched every single piece of metal. I think hide-and-seek is over.

Warrick: Yeah. We've searched every piece of metal. 

Warrick: Spare tire.

Sara: You've got to be kidding me.
Warrick: The tire sucked up the bullet and the treads covered its tracks.
SARA; We match the bullet to the cop's gun, the case is airtight.
CUT TO:



Warrick:  There's a match.

Warrick: We got Tyner. One bad cop going down.
Bobby Dawson: Well, actually, Warrick, the evidence round wasn't from the cop's gun. It was from the suspect's.

Sara: No way.
CUT TO:



Det. B. Evans: These guys never give up anything on their girls.
Catherine: Well, let me give it a try. 

Catherine: Excuse me, sir. 

Catherine: Can we see your permits?
Ted Beaton: Oh, hi, Gorgeous. How are you?

Catherine: Okay, Ted.
Ted Beaton: How you doing?
Catherine: I'm okay.

Ted Beaton: Hi. You should have seen this lady dance. Oh, was she good! You still working with the cops?

Catherine: Can't seem to get off the night shift. 
Det. B. Evans: You dressed like that?

Catherine: If you want to call that dressed. Yeah, Evans. Hey, Ted, you heard about this thing with Eddie and April?
Ted Beaton: Yeah, the night guy told me about it. Boy, Eddie never changes, huh? 

Ted Beaton: Bring back memories?

AMY HENDLER Can I help you?
Grissom: Ma'am, my name is Gil Grissom. This is Nick Stokes.
Nick: Hi.
Jason Hendler:  Honey, who's out there?
Grissom: Mr. Hendler, we're criminalists from the Las Vegas police department.
Amy Hendler: What's this about?
Grissom: We're investigating the disappearance of Fay Green. May we come in?

Jason Hendler: Yes.
Nick: Thank you.

CUT TO:


 
Jason Hendler:  Did you find her?
Grissom: Yes, I'm afraid we did. She'd been dead for quite a while.
Jason Hendler: Hmm.  You always hope ...

GRISSOM; Mr. Hendler ... would it be possible for us to look around?
Jason Hendler: Fay only lived here for about a month, five years ago. 
 
Jason Hendler: I've got nothing to hide.
Grissom: Thank you.
Nick: Thanks.


Grissom: A trigger and a lionfish.
Jason Hendler: Yeah, that's right.
Grissom: Interesting choices. Violent, carnivorous predators.

Jason Hendler: It's just a warped floorboard.
Amy Hendler: It's been like that forever.
Grissom: Mr. Hendler, at any time, was your fish tank over here?
Jason Hendler: Maybe, a while ago. Why?
Grissom: Did it ever overflow?  Break?
Jason Hendler: Not that I recall.
Grissom: You said I could look anywhere, right?
Jason Hendler: Yeah.
Grissom:  Got a pocket knife?

Jason Hendler: What are you doing?
Grissom:  Pops out, pops in. 

Grissom:  What do you find inside an hourglass? 

Grissom: Mr. Hendler, I think the tank was over here. I think it broke. I think you got water and artificial sand all over the place.
Jason Hendler: I'd like you fellows to leave now, please.
Grissom: Fine, we'll go. We'll be back ... with a warrant.

FADE TO BLACK.

Catherine: So, Greg, what did the rape kit say?
Greg Sanders: Nonoxynol-9, polyvinyl alcohol, and...
Catherine: Glycerin?

Greg Sanders: Yeah.

Catherine: It's a contraceptive film. 
What are you drinking?
Greg Sanders: Chamomile.
Catherine: May I?
Greg Sanders: Sure.
Catherine: Thank you.

Greg Sanders: So you used to work at the French Palace?
Catherine: That's right.
Greg Sanders: You know, my friends and I used to go there.
Catherine: Really?
Greg Sanders: Payday fridays.
Catherine: Uh-huh.
Greg Sanders: Maybe I saw you perform?
Catherine:  Oh, I doubt it.
Greg Sanders: Why?

Catherine: You would have remembered. 

Catherine: So, this film-- it's kind of hard to detect because it dissolves with body heat. And, as you know, Greg, s*x can make a body pretty hot.

Greg Sanders: This stuff has to be inserted fifteen minutes to three hours before s*x.
Catherine: Which means that April inserted the film while she was still at work.
Greg Sanders: But how could she have known to put the birth control in before she was raped?
CATHERINE Exactly.


CUT TO:



Nick: Guess where Jason Hendler was employed five years ago.
Grissom: Summercliff Housing Development. A plumber, perhaps?
Nick: Close. A subcontractor. How did you know?
Grissom: Why else would you be so excited? 

Grissom: Hey! You weren't going to say good-bye to me?
Nick: I'll meet you outside. Hi, Teri.
Teri Miller: Thought I'd let you off easy. But I did tack up my number on your big fish corkboard ... under &quot;cold cases.&quot;
Grissom: The ones that got away.
Teri Miller: Let's hope not.

CUT TO:



Warrick: So, check it out ... the laser is the path of the bullet. If you were Officer Tyner and you approached the suspect from the driver's side of the vehicle ... 
Sara: Vic was shot in the frontal lobe through the windshield. There's no way I could shoot the guy from here and mimic that trajectory.
Warrick: The laws of physics trump the eye witness. There's only one way this could've gone down.

Suspect: I'll show you my registration!
Officer Tyner: Put your hands on the wheel!


Warrick: Officer Tyner was telling the truth.
 BRASS: And that's a surprise? 
 SARA: Ease up. Until now, none of us knew what really happened.
Brass: So I bet you think I owe you one, huh?
Warrick: We work. We get paid. You don't owe me anything.
Brass:  Fine with me. 


CUT TO:



April Lewis: He promised me a million things. I got tired of him lying.
Catherine: Like what -- marriage, kids?
April Lewis: Music videos. He kept telling me he'd put me in one but he never delivered.
Catherine: And for that you set him up for rape?

April Lewis: No, it wasn't supposed to go this far, okay? I got this friend over at the trop. She got this high roller on a rape charge. He paid a ton to make it go away.
Catherine: Wait a minute. You think that Eddie's got money?
April Lewis: He is in the music business.
Catherine: He reps some bands off-strip.
April Lewis:  No, I met a producer friend of his from L.A. and he's always throwing money around this place. 

April Lewis: What? What's so funny?
Catherine:  Nothing.

CUT TO:



Grissom: I see you've cleaned house. I thought you might.
Jason Hendler: I vacuumed up the sand. Big deal. Will you at least tell me what you're doing here?
Grissom: I'm working, sir. Officer, would you hit the lights, please?

JASON HENDLER You're getting my floor wet.

Nick: It's luminol, sir. It dries quickly.
Grissom: Surface is non-reactive.
Jason Hendler: I know what you're doing. You're looking for blood.
Amy Hendler: My husband didn't do anything. Why are you harassing him?
Grissom: Let's try the ALS.
Nick: Why use the Alternate Light Source if the luminol didn't pick up anything?
Grissom: Luminol works on the surface. ALS chases the protein molecules in blood. It actually penetrates the wood. These floorboards are all made of maple -- high-end-but they've been lacquered.

Nick: Who lacquers maple unless they're trying to hide something?
Grissom: Yeah. 

Grissom: Turn it off, Nick. Officer, hit the lights, please. 

Grissom: Mr. Hendler let me tell you what I think happened to Fay. On the night of her disappearance, the two of you got in a heated argument.

Fay Green: Don't you walk away from me!


Grissom: Suffering a concussion, Fay falls to the floor. In the heat of the moment you decide to make it final. But Fay surprises you: She fights back. She pushes you off. She crawls a few feet away and you move in for the final attack. 

Grissom: One thing that I don't know, though. What did you use to kill her?
Jason Hendler: I didn't kill her.
Grissom: Well, whatever the weapon it wasn't a knife, but it worked. You drove her body over to Summercliff where you were employed and you buried her in wet concrete.
Jason Hendler: I worked the Summercliff job less than a week. Ask Amy. She worked for the same contractor.
Amy Hendler: That's right. He got a better job in Reno. Jason wasn't even in Vegas when Fay disappeared.
Nick: And you painted the floors, covered your tracks for what, aesthetic reasons?

Grissom: Five years is a long time but eventually the past catches up to everybody.
Jason Hendler:  I didn't kill Fay! I loved her. I STILL love her.

Jason Hendler: Amy, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Amy Hendler: You still love her?

Nick: Officer, would you please arrest Mr. Hendler?

Jason Hendler: Call my father. He'll get a lawyer. I didn't do it. It's okay.
Grissom:  I'll ride along with the cops. Bring homicide up to speed. This is now a fresh crime scene.

Nick: I'll get to work.



Grissom:  &quot;The instrument had to be slightly curved with some kind of serrated edge like crocodile teeth...&quot;

Nick:  Mrs. Hendler, do you and your husband do much rock climbing?

Amy Hendler:  Yes. 

Amy Hendler: That's what I killed her with.
CUT TO:



Jason Hendler: I can prove I was in Reno when Fay disappeared. I've got records. You don't want to talk, fine. But I've got a question for you. Why do you care so much about the floors? I mean, Amy paints them every spring. It's no big deal.

CUT TO:



Amy Hendler: Jason was in Reno. I came here to tell Fay that we would be together again one day.
NICK Mrs. Hendler, put the gun down.
Amy Hendler: Do you know he was engaged to me when he met her?

Amy Hendler: Where are you going? FAY GREEN: Stop it!


Amy Hendler: There was blood ... everywhere. No one else could see it ... but I knew it was there. A dead body is so heavy.

Nick: Mrs. Hendler, I'm a good listener.  You got to give me the gun.
Amy Hendler:  I'm sorry.
Nick: No, wait.
Amy Hendler: But you arrested my husband.
Nick: Wait!
Grissom:  Mrs. Hendler. 

Grissom: Nick, don't move.

Grissom: Please. I don't want to fire my gun any more than you do. For five years, you've been washing the blood off your hands. 
Let's put down the guns.


Grissom: You okay, Nick?

Nick: Yeah.
Grissom: Come on.

CUT TO:



Lindsey Willows: Hey, mom!

Eddie Willows: Morning.

Catherine: Morning. 

Catherine: Please don't tell me that you're in trouble again already.
Eddie Willows: You weren't home. I figured you'd be here. Lindsey loves this park. So, I thought I'd take you out to breakfast. Say thank you.
Catherine: You're welcome. 

Catherine: I don't think that's such a good idea, though.

Eddie Willows: Cath, when are we going to talk about what happened between us?
Catherine: What's to talk about? You cheated on me. I caught you. I've got a new life.

Eddie Willows: Cath ... 

Eddie Willows: Come on. Why do you fight the one thing we're good at?

Lindsey Willows: Daddy! Daddy!
Eddie Willows: Hey! There's my little girl.


FADE TO BLACK.

							<p>See, it just like I told you, right?</p>
<p>It really brings back the good old days, huh?</p>
<p>So, what do you think it's worth?</p>
<p>Riley...</p>
<p>425, suspicious remains at the city dump.</p>
<p>Awesome.</p>
<p>Trash run for the low man on the totem pole.</p>
<p>I promise not to abuse my power over you.</p>
<p>Watch your back, Riley.</p>
<p>And for our new CSI level three, 411A, recovered stolen vehicle at McCarran.</p>
<p>Nick, 402, possible arson at the Burger Giant.</p>
<p>Well, there goes the night.</p>
<p>Why don't we all meet up at the coffee shop after work?</p>
<p>Level three over here is gonna buy.</p>
<p>I'll take care of breakfast.</p>
<p>And the 419 in Green Valley.</p>
<p>Looks like the king gets to sit on the bench for now.</p>
<p>That it?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>I know this has been a tough year for all of us, and I've been thinking...</p>
<p>I mean, more than usual.</p>
<p>I made a decision.</p>
<p>I'm gonna leave CSI.</p>
<p>Catherine will become the new supervisor, so you'll be in good hands.</p>
<p>While I'm clearing my caseload, Ecklie's preparing a list of candidates for a new level one hire, so... you won't be shorthanded.</p>
<p>And I guess I just came off the bench.</p>
<p>419 at Mount Charleston.</p>
<p>Okay?</p>
<p>C.S.I.</p>
<p>Season09 Episode09 19 Down Sir? You okay?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I was just wondering what it would be like to go fly fishing.</p>
<p>Uh, a couple of hikers came across the body this morning.</p>
<p>According to them, it's not a popular trail.</p>
<p>How long do you think that's been here?</p>
<p>I don't know. Sealed bag, cool, moist environment.</p>
<p>Could be weeks, could be years.</p>
<p>But it's definitely human.</p>
<p>Call the coroner. Tell him he's got soup to go.</p>
<p>All right, so let me get this straight.</p>
<p>Grissom didn't say that he was leaving permanently, so he could be taking a leave of absence.</p>
<p>That's a form of leaving, right?</p>
<p>I think this is leaving, leaving.</p>
<p>What's he gonna do? Teach?</p>
<p>Write a book, go off and study bugs somewhere?</p>
<p>You know as much as I do, Nicky.</p>
<p>Star of David.</p>
<p>Looks like some kind of pendant.</p>
<p>Victim must have been Jewish.</p>
<p>These clothes are pretty generic.</p>
<p>Jeans, T-shirt, sneakers.</p>
<p>It's not gonna help with TOD or s*x.</p>
<p>There's hair in our soup.</p>
<p>Most of them are brown, but some of them are blonde.</p>
<p>So, maybe the vic got a piece of the attacker.</p>
<p>Or maybe the victim just had a streak of dyed hair.</p>
<p>Hodges...</p>
<p>Hodges.</p>
<p>Collect and separate both sets of hairs.</p>
<p>Get them over to Wendy.</p>
<p>Run exemplars for mitochondrial DNA.</p>
<p>It's best to stay busy.</p>
<p>Based on skull morphology and femoral bone dimenons, I'd say we're looking at a Caucasian male, around five feet, nine inches.</p>
<p>Partial fusion of the coronal-cranial suture says that he was at least 25 years old.</p>
<p>Any idea of COD?</p>
<p>Very good idea. Broken hyoid.</p>
<p>Strangulation.</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Are you really leaving?</p>
<p>Yep.</p>
<p>Think of it this way, Doc.</p>
<p>You'll have somebody new you can tell all your old jokes to.</p>
<p>I like the old guy just fine.</p>
<p>Are you, uh, running away from something?</p>
<p>Or running to something? Someone?</p>
<p>I'm running to my office.</p>
<p>I think you're nuts.</p>
<p>I am never going to retire.</p>
<p><em>JEWISH</p>
<p>48 RESULTS FOUND STAR OF DAVID PENDANT REFINE SEARCH LISTED AS MISSING IN 1997.POSSIBLE VICTIM OF THE &quot;DICK &amp; JANE KILLER&quot;</em></p>
<p>The Dick and Jane Killer's name is Nathan Haskell.</p>
<p>Suspected of killing at least 14 people in Nevada, California and Arizona in the mid-90s.</p>
<p>He was picked up at a sobriety checkpoint near Reno.</p>
<p>It was a lucky break.</p>
<p>The blood on his car matched a male DB dumped in the desert several weeks earlier.</p>
<p>And he had blood under his nails which matched another male DB who had just been found.</p>
<p>A witness placed him with one of the vics.</p>
<p>There was a potential murder weapon.</p>
<p>Case went to trial.</p>
<p>In the middle, Haskell changed his plea.</p>
<p>He got life without parole, and he's serving it at Ely.</p>
<p>I remember this guy.</p>
<p>He was called the Dick and Jane Killer because he targeted couples.</p>
<p>It says here not any of the female vics were ever found.</p>
<p>He refused to discuss the females, but seven male bodies were found in various remote locations, each with postmortem stab wounds.</p>
<p>The first body they found had two stab wounds.</p>
<p>The second body had three stab wounds.</p>
<p>The third had four, then five, six, seven, eight, so the theory was that the first couple was never found.</p>
<p>And Joel Steiner and his fiance were considered possible victims since they lived nr DJK and they were reported missing in 1997.</p>
<p>That's before any of the other confirmed victims.</p>
<p>Guess all we need is a positive ID on Joel.</p>
<p>I had this made for Joel for his bar mitzvah.</p>
<p>He had a matching one made for his fiance when they got engaged.</p>
<p>Oh, Mrs. Steiner, I'm sorry.</p>
<p>You can't take it with you. It's, uh... it's evidence in an active case.</p>
<p>I promise to get it back to you right after we confirm the I.D.of your son's remains.</p>
<p>I will. I'll get it back to you.</p>
<p>But you can't keep it right now.</p>
<p>Sorry.</p>
<p>It's all right.</p>
<p>Thank you. Thanks.</p>
<p>I'm also going to need DNA samples from each of you.</p>
<p>But you already have Joel's DNA.</p>
<p>We gave it to the police in Reno, 11 years ago.</p>
<p>I gave them his toothbrush.</p>
<p>They sent the sample out to a private lab for DNA analysis, and that lab, um, misplaced it or lost it.</p>
<p>It happens.</p>
<p>David, I've been meaning to talk to you.</p>
<p>It's a little too late for that, huh?</p>
<p>Hey, you gotta do what you gotta do. Have a nice life.</p>
<p>Well, when I heard that those hairs might actually be connected to the Dick and Jane killer, I just put the screws to this guy I know at Accuregen.</p>
<p>And he ran our mito samples immediately.</p>
<p>What do you got on him?</p>
<p>He's my uncle.</p>
<p>I really didn't want to wait around for three weeks and then get the results after you were gone.</p>
<p>And it turns out that the blonde hairs are definitely a mito DNA match to Nathan Haskell.</p>
<p>Well, as far as we know, he was an only child. So, it's got to be him.</p>
<p>Grissom.</p>
<p>I just want to thank you for everything.</p>
<p>For the support and the encouragement that you've given me.</p>
<p>You earned it.</p>
<p>Wendy. Wasn't the &quot;body soup&quot; vic I.D.'d as the DJK's first victim?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Brass said that Joel Steiner's parents confirmed that the Star of David pendant was his.</p>
<p>And we're getting their DNA to positively establish I.D.</p>
<p>Okay, I don't believe that it was Joel Steiner.</p>
<p>The sneakers that Soup Man was wearing were made two years ago.</p>
<p>And the Dick and Jane Killer's been in jail for at least ten.</p>
<p>Well, how did he end up with DJK's hair on his body?</p>
<p>And who is he?</p>
<p>Lindsey was once given a gift certificate for a pair of customized jeans.</p>
<p>So we go to the store, we spend two hours picking out the wash, the rivets, you name it.</p>
<p>And-and she has her boyfriend's name embroidered on her butt pocket.</p>
<p>Well, guess what?</p>
<p>She breaks up with the guy a week later. She doesn't wear 'em once.</p>
<p>Still beats a tattoo, right?</p>
<p>Oh, don't go there.</p>
<p>In any case, the sneakers were definitely a custom job.</p>
<p>We got a warrant for the customer records.</p>
<p>Catherine, I, uh, I know I surprised you today with the...</p>
<p>I knew.</p>
<p>I knew before you knew.</p>
<p>Well, looks like the sneakers were &quot;designed&quot; by a Gerald Tolliver.</p>
<p>See if he's in missing persons.</p>
<p>Well, he's not only missing, he's got record.</p>
<p>Petty larceny, grand larceny. Several drug busts.</p>
<p>Reno P.D.registered him as a criminal informant just before he disappeared, six months ago.</p>
<p>You know what that means?</p>
<p>Road trip.</p>
<p>Kenny Martz, Reno P.D.</p>
<p>Nick Stokes. Greg Sanders.</p>
<p>So, did you work this case?</p>
<p>No, but I brought the related file.</p>
<p>Anything having to do with DJK is near and dear to my heart.</p>
<p>Busted him back when I was in uniform.</p>
<p>Practically made my career.</p>
<p>So you guys held this scene for six months?</p>
<p>Not intentionally. The house is still in probate.</p>
<p>Our CSIs found some blood drops on this wall.</p>
<p>They sampled it for DNA, and matched it to Gerald Tolliver.</p>
<p>We'd gotten him to roll on some local junkies.</p>
<p>We were just starting to move him up the food chain.</p>
<p>We figured he pissed somebody off, got into a fight, skipped town.</p>
<p>Is there blood on the floor as well?</p>
<p>Yeah. They luminoled this area.</p>
<p>The wasn't much blood, not enough to suggest murder.</p>
<p>They found what appears to be a partial shoe tread in this blood.</p>
<p>Look, Gerald Tolliver was 17 when DJK was doing his business.</p>
<p>He never turned up in the investigation.</p>
<p>So what's the connection?</p>
<p>We don't know. That's why we're here.</p>
<p>Looks like Gerald was a collector of sorts.</p>
<p>Maybe he was one of those &quot;murderabilia&quot; freaks, you know?</p>
<p>All it takes is one shady prison barber, and suddenly people are bidding for a lock of DJK's hair on eBay.</p>
<p>But Joel Steiner's body was never found.</p>
<p>How'd this guy end up with his Star of David?</p>
<p>I don't know.</p>
<p>But I'm betting a guy like this has other little &quot;treasures&quot; stashed around here somewhere.</p>
<p><em>LAST SEEN 6-14-97 AT THE DESERT ROSE ARENA</em></p>
<p>According to court transcripts, Haskell's attorneys were attempting to argue that the murders were the work of more than one killer.</p>
<p>That's when Haskell changed his plea.</p>
<p>What was the theory?</p>
<p>That it would've been impossible for Haskell to have strangled the males while simultaneously controlling the females.</p>
<p>They could've been sedated.</p>
<p>Tox on the male vics was clean.</p>
<p>Except for traces of THC.</p>
<p>Well, these guys are all narcissists.</p>
<p>Maybe Haskell just didn't want to share the spotlight.</p>
<p>Or maybe Gerald was more than just a murderabilia collector.</p>
<p>Maybe he was an accomplice.</p>
<p>Greg.</p>
<p>You guys aren't going to believe this.</p>
<p>Remember that apparent S &amp; M double murder from five weeks ago?</p>
<p>Well, whoever killed Gerald Tolliver was also involved in the murders of Ian Wallace and Justine Stefani...</p>
<p>His shoe print was at both crime scenes.</p>
<p>And Ian had nine postmortem stab wounds.</p>
<p>Didn't mean much at the time, but it's consistent with the DJK's MO.</p>
<p>I think we're dealing with a copycat who was trying to make Ian and Justine the ninth couple.</p>
<p>A DJK copycat who just so happened to kill a DJK accomplice that nobody knew existed till just now?</p>
<p>I've clearly missed something.</p>
<p>I'll catch you up.</p>
<p>So let's just go up to Ely and question him.</p>
<p>This guy pled guilty to avoid even the suggestion that he wasn't responsible.</p>
<p>He's not going to talk to us.</p>
<p>All roads lead to Rome.</p>
<p>So Ely State Prison sent over all the correspondence, video logs, phone records of the Dick and Jane Killer.</p>
<p>So I told the detectives to be on the lookout for any names that are associated with both the DJK and Gerald Tolliver.</p>
<p>I think that might be our best bet.</p>
<p>That's a lot of material.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, the guy likes to give interviews.</p>
<p>Dateline, 20/20 Time magazine.</p>
<p>The guy likes to talk.</p>
<p>I think he likes to have people listen to him.</p>
<p>So I hear you're moving on.</p>
<p>I am.</p>
<p>That's too bad.</p>
<p>We'll stay in touch.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>You know, the barbecue, Labor Day, Fourth of July.</p>
<p>Go out othe boat.</p>
<p>You got a boat?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Captain, something interesting.</p>
<p>It's not a connection between DJK and Gerald Tolliver, but there is a lot of back and forth between the warden and a professor at WLVU.</p>
<p>Apparently DJK's participating in some kind of criminology seminar.</p>
<p>They're setting up a video conference for a Q &amp; A with the students, the whole bit.</p>
<p>I'd take that class.</p>
<p>That's a good idea.</p>
<p>You should do that.</p>
<p>These letters say the seminar is open to faculty.</p>
<p>You could go in as a visiting professor.</p>
<p>So what's the real professor going to say?</p>
<p>We won't tell him.</p>
<p>We'd be risking too much if he's not willing to play ball, anyway.</p>
<p>I'll clear it with the university administration.</p>
<p>Hello.</p>
<p>I'm Dr. Raymond Langston.</p>
<p>I'd like to welcome all those faculty members who have bravely come out of the closet and revealed themselves to be murder freaks.</p>
<p>Now, one of things I am most often asked is, What does a serial killer look like?</p>
<p>It's not a bad question.</p>
<p>Statistically speaking, nine out of ten are Caucasian males under the age of 30, but you never know.</p>
<p>There was the case of a mother and daughter.</p>
<p>In a three-year spree, they killed over and over again, systematically murdering ten infants, and they ate the remains.</p>
<p>That's Passion and Pom.</p>
<p>Jane Goodall observed their rampage in Gombe in the 70s.</p>
<p>Now, remember, we human beings share 99.5% of our DNA with chimps.</p>
<p>The urge to kill... maybe it is just a big-brain mammal thing, but it is in all of us.</p>
<p>I want to reemphasize the ground rules here.</p>
<p>Orderly conduct is to be maintained at all times.</p>
<p>Don't reveal any personal information.</p>
<p>No names.</p>
<p>And the warden has requested that the ladies please refrain from wearing any revealing clothing.</p>
<p>My dear, you might want to put on a sweater.</p>
<p>Now, last semester, some of you came to me and said you wanted to know what the face of evil looked like.</p>
<p>Well, here it is.</p>
<p>Hello, class.</p>
<p>Everybody ready to learn?</p>
<p>What can you tell us about your father?</p>
<p>Apart from the fact that he was a mean, miserable son of a bitch who beat me at every occasion...nothing.</p>
<p>What about your mother?</p>
<p>Was that who that lady was who lived with us?</p>
<p>I always wondered.</p>
<p>Mr. Haskell.</p>
<p>I... killed my first small animal when I was nine.</p>
<p>It was a cat.</p>
<p>It's usually a cat.</p>
<p>Mr. Haskell.</p>
<p>No one knows why that is.</p>
<p>I mean, I know it's a terrible thing...</p>
<p>If you're going to waste our time on playing games and phony remorse, I'll pull the plug right now.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>Honesty it is, then.</p>
<p>I didn't like your book.</p>
<p>It's too technical and too depressing.</p>
<p>Then, let's talk about something you enjoyed... your first kill.</p>
<p>Oh, you never forget your first time, but I think that discussion's a little too intimate for this stage of our relationship.</p>
<p>Maybe when know each other a little better.</p>
<p>That's why we're here.</p>
<p>Class, question and answer.</p>
<p>Serial killers usually have some sort of selection process.</p>
<p>What was yours?</p>
<p>How'd you choose your victims?</p>
<p>Did you ever buy a car?</p>
<p>You go down to the showroom.</p>
<p>You're pretty sure you're gonna get one, but why the red one?</p>
<p>Why not the blue one?</p>
<p>Nobody knows, but... just one of them speaks to you and that's the one you got to have.</p>
<p>How much premeditation was involved?</p>
<p>Did you fantasize about what you were going to do?</p>
<p>Of course, I did.</p>
<p>All the time.</p>
<p>You remind me of my first lay.</p>
<p>She was a hooker.</p>
<p>I mean that as a compliment.</p>
<p>Did, uh... you ever share any of your experiences with anyone?</p>
<p>Like, with a buddy?</p>
<p>I didn't have any buddies.</p>
<p>Well, you must have had some friends.</p>
<p>You seem like you could be friendly.</p>
<p>These days, I mostly have fans.</p>
<p>I get at least two or three marriage proposals every month, but... they don't allow conjugal visits, so why carry the baggage when you can't ve the fun?</p>
<p>You're not a student.</p>
<p>What do you teach?</p>
<p>Sociology.</p>
<p>Tell us your definition of fun.</p>
<p>Fun is taking something away from somebody.</p>
<p>Like... a nice Jewish girl, for example.</p>
<p>Taking her off on a little vacation.</p>
<p>Just three days and three nights of Heaven on Earth.</p>
<p>And then...just Heaven.</p>
<p>L'chaim.</p>

<p>The night before Ian Wallace and Justine Stefani were killed, they went to a Paramore concert, and according to his credit card records, he bought tickets for all three nights: Thursday, Friday and Saturday.</p>
<p>And we also found these old Pearl Jam ticket stubs in Gerald Tolliver's mattress.</p>
<p>According to the DJK file, Joel Steiner and his fiance went missing after attending that concert back in '97.</p>
<p>So, maybe the killer finds his victims at concerts.</p>
<p>Exactly, so we checked with the online ticketing service.</p>
<p>Hard tickets were mailed to Ian-- they all get scanned at the venue-- but on the night of Ian and Justine's murder, they were never used.</p>
<p>But the ones from Saturday night were.</p>
<p>You waste a couple... why waste the tickets?</p>
<p>You never revealed the location of any of your female victims-- why?</p>
<p>Because nobody ever asked me that question ever before.</p>
<p>I always thought it was strange.</p>
<p>Well, then, tell us now.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>You're serving two consecutive life sentences.</p>
<p>You have nothing to lose.</p>
<p>Of course I do, Professor, because when I took those women, they stopped being somebody's...girlfriend or... sister or...daughter...or fiance They became what I wanted them to be.</p>
<p>They're mine.</p>
<p>Did any of them resist?</p>
<p>No one tried to escape or fight back?</p>
<p>Tiffany and Cynthia fought a little...at first.</p>
<p>How did you control them?</p>
<p>Not with force.</p>
<p>I'm gonna return to the Jewish theme here, Doctor, although I want you to know that I have also killed Catholics and Protestants and one atheist.</p>
<p>By the way, they all prayed eventually.</p>
<p>Anyway, during the Holocaust, when the first arrivals at the death camps realized they were going to be killed, they flew into a panic, so the guards-- the Nazis-- started telling them that they were going to be put to work, that their skills were going to be used, and they all calmed down.</p>
<p>And they all marched obediently into the showers.</p>
<p>You have to give them hope.</p>
<p>If you bring a human being to the brink of death, and then you offer a chance-- no matter how small a chance-- to survive, they'll grab it.</p>
<p>And they'll thank you for it.</p>
<p>And then... you can do whatever you want.</p>
<p>And believe me...</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>Langston.</p>
<p>Hello, warden, thank you for calling.</p>
<p>Am I making you proud of me?</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>Okay, that's it for today.</p>
<p>See you tomorrow.</p>
<p>Be careful out there.</p>
<p>Could I buy you a drink?</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>So, all these videos are from the Paramore show the night after Justine and Ian were killed?</p>
<p>Got to love the Internet.</p>
<p>The vics' tickets were in section 203... seats M26 and 28.</p>
<p>And this video... has the best view of those seats.</p>
<p>Looks like they have the same logos on their ball caps.</p>
<p>I'll enhance that.</p>
<p>Reliant Wash and Wax.</p>
<p>Uh, yeah, I recognize them.</p>
<p>That's Richie and Donny-- they're in the tunnel.</p>
<p>Yeah, okay.</p>
<p>All right, shut the machine down.</p>
<p>Go in the west entrance.</p>
<p>Buckle up these two guys.</p>
<p>Las Vegas Police!</p>
<p>Las Vegas Police.</p>
<p>Put your hands on the hood.</p>
<p>Put your hands on the hood where I can see them.</p>
<p>Okay, here's a simple quiz.</p>
<p>The Paramore concert five weeks ago.</p>
<p>Where'd you get the tickets?</p>
<p>I told you not to do it, you idiot.</p>
<p>I got them off a scalper.</p>
<p>That's not illegal-- it's the scalping them that's illegal. - Shut up.</p>
<p>I don't know what this guy's talking...coming in here...</p>
<p>What the scalper look like?</p>
<p>I don't know, it was dark.</p>
<p>It was in a parking lot.</p>
<p>Some skinny white dude, man.</p>
<p>Well, that's a big help.</p>
<p>Any chance either of you have the ticket stub?</p>
<p>Yeah, I do.</p>
<p>It's in my wallet.</p>
<p>What is this, a phone book?</p>
<p>Yeah, I keep everything.</p>
<p>Somebody's home.</p>
<p>Come on, let's go. Let's go, go, go, go.</p>
<p>Curtis Keesey-- LVPD!</p>
<p>Open up!</p>
<p>The lights are on a timer.</p>
<p>Late instar, synthesiomyia nudiseta.</p>
<p>So, I hear you've been going back to school.</p>
<p>Sort of.</p>
<p>I loved college.</p>
<p>Me, too.</p>
<p>Green Bottle Blow Fly.</p>
<p>These typically pupate in about two weeks and emerge as adults in four.</p>
<p>The AC on in the trailer slows down the timeline a bit.</p>
<p>He's been dead at least a month.</p>
<p>You're going to miss this, you are.</p>
<p>There's bugs everywhere, David.</p>
<p>I will miss you, though.</p>
<p>Hey, Nicky, he's got Pirellis in the front and Michelins in the rear.</p>
<p>Consistent with the tire treads found at the Justine Sephani murder scene.</p>
<p>That's great but unfortunately, his shoes were not.</p>
<p>None of these treads match.</p>
<p>So, Curtis must've been the wheel man.</p>
<p>At least we got half the team that killed Ian and Justine.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's the half that's out there walking around that I'm worried about.</p>
<p>So, six months ago, Shoe Print Man kills Gerald Tolliver, an accomplice of the Dick and Jane Killer.</p>
<p>And then, five weeks ago, Shoe Print, along with Curtis Keesey, abducts and kills a couple in what appears to be a botched DJK-style murder.</p>
<p>Can we connect Shoe Print with the murder of Curtis Keesey?</p>
<p>There's no physical evidence.</p>
<p>But we do know that Curtis scalped his vics' concert tickets, which isn't too bright.</p>
<p>Reason enough for one crook to kill another.</p>
<p>So, let's assume that Shoe Print was involved in all four murders.</p>
<p>It's possible he knew Gerald, right?</p>
<p>Is it also possible that he was an accomplice of DJK?</p>
<p>That would explain the nine post-mortem stab wounds in Ian Wallace.</p>
<p>It's a continuation of the master's work.</p>
<p>But if he was DJK's helper back in the day, why go quiet for ten years and then suddenly start killing again?</p>
<p>Maybe he was doing time.</p>
<p>And when he realized that his old partner turned informant, he got scared and killed him.</p>
<p>Maybe that's what brought the old thrill back.</p>
<p>Once these guys get a taste, it never seems to go away.</p>
<p>So, we've been talking a lot about how you did what you did.</p>
<p>Let's shift gears from what you did right, to what you did wrong.</p>
<p>Do you mean in a Ten Commandments sense?</p>
<p>I mean in how you got caught.</p>
<p>That's the least exciting part of the story.</p>
<p>Yeah, but didn't you want it?</p>
<p>Didn't you want to get caught?</p>
<p>Why would I want that?</p>
<p>You were caught because a rookie patrolman spotted blood on your car, correct?</p>
<p>For a careful man, that seems a little careless.</p>
<p>Everybody makes mistakes.</p>
<p>Not someone like you.</p>
<p>Not a mistake like that.</p>
<p>I'm flattered you think so highly of me.</p>
<p>Any other questions?</p>
<p>Anybody else?</p>
<p>Mr. Haskell, you're of average height and weight.</p>
<p>And not overly muscular.</p>
<p>I try to watch what I eat.</p>
<p>In jail, that takes more strength than you would know.</p>
<p>A few of your male victims were pretty big.</p>
<p>One even played college football.</p>
<p>How were you able to overpower a man like that, while still keeping control of the woman?</p>
<p>Why don't you tell me, Professor?</p>
<p>You obviously have a theory.</p>
<p>Well, I think you must've had help.</p>
<p>The works of great men can be hard to comprehend for those less great.</p>
<p>You said you were going to be honest with us.</p>
<p>Now, answer the question.</p>
<p>Did you have help or not?</p>
<p>Well, let me think.</p>
<p>With Melanie, it was just me and the baseball bat.</p>
<p>With Kristin, when I cut off her right breast, that was just me.</p>
<p>When I crushed Joel's neck and felt his veins burst under my fingers like rotten grapes, - and watched his throat fill up with blood, I didn't have any help there, either.</p>
<p>Where is he, you monster!</p>
<p>Where is my Joel?</p>
<p>Where is he?</p>
<p>Oh, I think I hit a nerve.</p>
<p>You tell me where he is!</p>
<p>Can I think about that and get back to you?</p>
<p>Okay, I thought about it, I'm not going to tell you.</p>
<p>Oh, please tell me...</p>
<p>Don't give him the satisfaction.</p>
<p>Joel was the first.</p>
<p>Joel is in the perfect place, the place where it all began.</p>
<p>And if I could get out of here, believe me, I would bring him some company.</p>
<p>Mr. Haskell, we know that you had accomplices.</p>
<p>If you were to reveal who they were, it might get you out of keep-away.</p>
<p>Oh, how nice that we have a member of the law enforcement community with us today.</p>
<p>For you real students who don't know, &quot;keep-away&quot; is what they call the kind of solitary confinement I'm in.</p>
<p>Kill the feed.</p>
<p>It's kind of funny, don't you--</p>
<p>You hijacked my class without my consent for your investigation?</p>
<p>We're working a multiple homicide.</p>
<p>We didn't want to talk about it outside the department.</p>
<p>You talked to the Dean.</p>
<p>Well, it was on a need-to-know basis and he had a need to know.</p>
<p>Look, I don't teach this course because I get off on the subject matter.</p>
<p>If there's another DJK out there, I want him just as bad as you do.</p>
<p>I would've helped.I would've been happy to help you.</p>
<p>I'm sure that's true.</p>
<p>You believe DJK had an accomplice?</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>Do you have a name?</p>
<p>Not yet.</p>
<p>Okay, now we're all up to speed.</p>
<p>Doctor...</p>
<p>I will keep you informed.</p>
<p>To the extent that we can.</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p>I know a kiss-off when I hear one.</p>
<p>A little cranky for an academic, isn't he?</p>
<p>Actually, he's an M.D.from back East.</p>
<p>A colleague at his hospital turned out to be an Angel of Death.</p>
<p>Killed 27 patients before he was caught.</p>
<p>Langston was the staff research pathologist.</p>
<p>All the morbidity evidence came across his desk, but he was unable to connect the dots.</p>
<p>He wrote a book about it.</p>
<p>Any good?</p>
<p>I liked it.</p>
<p>This is Langston.</p>
<p>Working late?</p>
<p>I kind of thought you might be.</p>
<p>Haskell.</p>
<p>This must be my lucky night.</p>
<p>Maybe it's yours, too.</p>
<p>What do you want?</p>
<p>I want you to look out the window.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because I'm in the parking lot.</p>
<p>I made you look.</p>
<p>Is that why you called?</p>
<p>No, I wanted to talk to you about what happened in class today, with Mrs. Steiner.</p>
<p>Sure, just, uh, hold on a second.</p>
<p>Let me close the door.</p>
<p>Grissom.</p>
<p>Ray Langston.</p>
<p>I have Nate Haskell on the phone.</p>
<p>He wants to talk about what happened with Mrs. Steiner.</p>
<p>I'd like to put you on the other line.</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>Haskell, are you there?</p>
<p>I'm sure we're all here now.</p>
<p>What I learned in class today, as I was looking out at all those scared little faces who couldn't take their eyes off of me, was how much I miss being out in the world.</p>
<p>And when Mrs. Steiner had her &quot;moment, &quot; it got me thinking about... closure.</p>
<p>Which is what you'll find at the corner of Boulder Highway and Hasbrook.</p>
<p>It's just another empty stretch of desert out there.</p>
<p>At least it was ten years ago.</p>
<p>The way this city's changed, it's maybe all different now.</p>
<p>Although, maybe not.</p>
<p>It's kind of an ugly place.</p>
<p>Anyway, it's just the same in my imagination.</p>
<p>There's a concrete bridge built in 1938.</p>
<p>You can tell because the year is stamped in the front.</p>
<p>25 feet from that, look west.</p>
<p>You'll see oneark stone that just doesn't quit fit with the rest.</p>
<p>Under there... that's where you'll find Joel.</p>
<p>And if we're lucky, maybe something else.</p>
<p>Grissom, we got something here!</p>
<p>Because that's the problem with closure.</p>
<p>Sometimes when something closes, Something else opens up.</p>
<p>There's ten stab wounds.</p>
<p>Guess you won't be leaving just yet.</p>
<p>To be continued..</p>

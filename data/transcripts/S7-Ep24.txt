							<p>COLD OPEN: </p>
<p>[CU: IZZY DELANCY MINIATURE]</p>
<p>(Miniature photos in frames, a bottle of water and mail litter the miniature counter.)</p>
<p>(We pull back. A miniature doll made up to be IZZY DELANCY is slumped over the kitchen table in a pool of blood, a plate of breakfast untouched.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) The detail is ...</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: (V.O.) ... terrifying. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (V.O.) I think Malibu Barbie did it.</p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO: </p>
<p>[CU: PENNY GARDEN MINIATURE]</p>
<p>(We continue through a sunroom with the Penny Garden doll slumped over the broken window sill.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) Well, then there's a lot more to Barbie than just a pretty face. 'Cause this is a perfect half-inch-scale model of the room.</p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO: </p>
<p>[CU: RAYMUNDO SUAREZ]</p>
<p>(The Raymundo Suarez doll is face-down on the miniature table in the miniature MANNLEIGH chicken factory.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) Three different views of the same dead doll.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (V.O.) Assuming that they're all Dell foster kids, there's thirteen of them.</p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO: </p>
<p>[CU: MINIATURE LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The miniature Las Vegas City Lights flicker and blink.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: (V.O.) I found a common element in all four miniatures: bleach.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CONVENIENCE STORE – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The television has a BREAKING NEWS report of HAPPY MORALES, his boxing pose up on the monitor.) </p>
<p><strong>Paula Francis (newswoman)</strong>: ...stunned by the death of former top-ranked junior middleweight Lorenzo &quot;Happy&quot; Morales, whose body was found floating in a pool late last night ... </p>
<p>(The convenience store woman watches the news report on the small television set. The door opens. She looks up to see who it is.) </p>
<p>(A tough looking, shaggy-haired man walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Paula Francis (newswoman)</strong>: ... at the Sugarcane Ranch Brothel in Bryant County. Morales, best known for his ability to take a punch, was reportedly attempting a comeback to boxing. </p>
<p>(He walks through the aisles and stops. He bends over to grab something and his jacket rides up his back, exposing a dangerous-looking knife tucked in his jeans band.) </p>
<p><strong>Paula Francis (newswoman)</strong>: LVPD is investigating the incident, which they are treating as a homicide.</p>
<p>(He absently pulls his jacket down to cover the knife. He continues through the aisles.) </p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(Two girls heat up a hotdog at the counter microwave oven. They stick the foiled hotdog in the microwave oven and turn it on. The oven shorts and sparks. The girls giggle.) </p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(The janitor mops the floor,an open container of bleach on the floor nearby. He moves the mop and knocks over the bleach. The liquid spills out onto the floor.) </p>
<p>(CU: The liquid moves slowly along the floor ... under the aisle shelves ... and into the next aisle ... )</p>
<p>(A woman wearing red tennis shoes takes a step back at the liquid moving along the floor under the shelving. She gasps and turns around in a panic. Natalie runs.) </p>
<p>[EXT. THE STRIP – SIDEWALK – NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Natalie runs out into the sidewalk. She takes deep panicked breaths. She walks along the sidewalk.) </p>
<p>(The overhead light show has started and the walkway is crowded with people.) </p>
<p>(Natalie makes her way through the crowd, their faces distorted. She's in a panic as she makes her way through the people. Everything is distorted.) </p>
<p>(We PULL BACK on the light show – PULL BACK till we are coming out of NATALIE'S eye.)</p>
<p>(Natalie stares in front of her, her right eye occasionally blinking open and closed like a broken doll's eye.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – GRISSOM'S OFFICE – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(We PAN ACROSS Grissom's bulletin board filled with various photo captures of the kids in ERNIE DELL'S home video collection.)</p>
<p>(He takes off a particular photo of two boys and a dark-haired little girl. He carries the photo back to his desk.) </p>
<p>(Hodges knocks on the door before he walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Hey, boss, heard you got a lead on another one of the Dell fosters.</p>
<p>(Hodges sits down. Grissom writes DECEASED over the photo of the little boy in the center of the picture.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Just got an e-mail. Raymond Dell. Died two years ago in some bizarre back hoe incident in Rapid City.</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Okay. That's good. One less suspect.</p>
<p>(Grissom's phone rings. He answers it.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to phone) Grissom.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (from phone) Court order for another Dell kid in Old Henderson -- the<br />
1621 Water Street. It just came through. Are you up for a house call?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to phone) I'll meet you there.</p>
<p>(Grissom stands up and heads out. Hodges raises his hand and opens his mouth to say something, but Grissom's gone.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. DELL APARTMENT BUILDING – HALLWAY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Brass and Grissom follow the manager to Trevor Dell's apartment.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, we've been trying to contact Mr. Dell for a couple of weeks. Have you heard from him?</p>
<p><strong>Manager</strong>: No, but that's probably 'cause the rent's due. See, around here, we mostly have the kind of tenants who don't like to pay their bills much. (clears throat) This is the one.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I wonder why.</p>
<p>(Brass knocks on the door.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Trevor Dell, open up. Las Vegas Police.</p>
<p>(The manager unlocks the door.) </p>
<p><strong>Manager</strong>: You got my authority to use deadly force.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hey, shut up and stand back.</p>
<p>(Brass opens the door and enters. Grissom follows him inside.) </p>
<p>[INT. TREVOR DELL'S APARTMENT – CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Brass and Grissom look around.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Anybody home? This is the police.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Somebody likes it cold.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Vegas in May, plus global warming.</p>
<p>(Grissom sees the collectible fantasy figurines on the shelves.) </p>
<p>(Brass walks into the bathroom and finds the dead body on the floor.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hey, Gil, we got a body.</p>
<p>(Grissom doesn't move. He finds a small miniature male figure in white on one of the shelves. This can't be good. In the background, we hear Brass call it in.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (to phone) Yeah, Control, this is Jim Brass. I got a 419 at 1621 Water Street, Apartment 2B.</p>
<p>(Brass comes out of the bathroom to check on Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What, you lose your interest in dead bodies?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No. But I'm afraid the Miniature Killer was here first.</p>
<p>(Brass sees the miniature TREVOR DELL and the dead TREVOR DELL in the bathroom.) </p>
<p>SMASH TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[INT. TREVOR DELL'S APARTMENT – BATHROOM -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Grissom crouches in the doorway as he watches David Phillips go over the body.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Two distinct lacerations -- one on the forehead, one on the back of the skull. Lividity is fixed. Decomp is pretty well developed.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Air-conditioning would have slowed that and accelerated mummification. Body's been sealed in the apartment. There's no insect activity. So much for TOD.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Could be a couple of days to a few weeks.</p>
<p>(Sara appears in the doorway.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Miniature Killer?</p>
<p>(Grissom stands up and sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's hard to say. Haven't found a miniature of the scene yet. Just this.</p>
<p>(He shows her an evidence bag with the miniature TREVOR DELL inside.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Clothes match. The ... uh ... vic's a PT nurse, but there's no blood on the doll, and it's not posed like the body.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Bleach at the scene, just like the others.</p>
<p>(Sara notes the bottle of BATHROOM CLEANER with BLEACH on the floor behind the toilet.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Maybe this one wasn't planned. Maybe the killer has to make the miniature after the fact, which is why it's so cold in here, to preserve the body.</p>
<p>(Grissom nods at the possibility.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I don't think we can rule anything out. It's all yours, my dear.</p>
<p>(Grissom leaves the bathroom.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[CU: MINIATURE LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The miniature Las Vegas City Lights flicker and blink.) </p>
<p>[INT. NATALIE'S LAIR -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Porcelain dolls are on the hallway shelves in the dark apartment accented by the sparse light. In the center of the living room, Natalie sits at her workstation rigged with additional lighting, tables and shelves so that everything she needs is within arm's length. The rest of the living room is bare and dark – there's no furniture and sparse lighting.) </p>
<p>(We move in closer as Natalie works. She bends over to pick something up off the floor and we see that the screen in front of her has an enlarged view of the porcelain green-eyed doll's head with one eye slightly closed.) </p>
<p>(CU: Natalie holds up a miniature rubber female body. It's bare. She picks up the scissors and gets to work. The first thing she does is clip the rubber head off the body. She picks up another head already prepared -- with features and with hair – and she places it in front of the body.)</p>
<p>(On the table top next to her, she has an array of bodies already made up and in various positions – a dark-haired man in a white shirt and jeans; a blonde-haired man in a brown shirt, jacket and dark slacks; a dark-haired man in overalls with his arms stretched out over his head; a dark-haired man in a blue shirt, jacket and jeans.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[CU: TREVOR DELL MINIATURE DOLL]</p>
<p>(Grissom holds the TREVOR DELL miniature doll dressed in white. He turns it over and cuts the shirt off the doll's back.</p>
<p>[INT. CSI – LAYOUT ROOM] </p>
<p>(Grissom is working in the layout room. The various photos and other items are up on the walls and the miniature crime scenes are on the table. Catherine walks into the room as Grissom works.) </p>
<p>(Catherine watches him work.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Comparing construction materials of the new doll to see if it's the same work as the others?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Is there any doubt?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I live by the Uncertainty Principle. The mere act of observing a phenomenon changes its nature.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So in trying to catch the killer, we've changed his behavior.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm certain we have.</p>
<p>(Grissom spreads the cut pieces of cloth apart. He puts his goggles on and uses the ALS on the doll's back.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: A fingerprint.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, there was no physical trace on any of the other dolls or the miniatures.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Maybe he's finally gotten careless.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. PLATINUM MAID SERVICE – WAITING ROOM – DAY]</p>
<p>(Natalie sits among other applicants in the waiting room. She has her sketchbook with her and flips through the pages. One of the pages has a pencil sketch outline of the RAYMUNDO SUAREZ miniature with a body on the table.) </p>
<p>(She flips through the pages showing a woman's mutilated face.) </p>
<p>(She flips through earlier sketches of Izzy Delancy dead.)</p>
<p>(She glances around, then continues a sketch she's working on.) </p>
<p>(Rochelle Dorley calls out the next name.) </p>
<p><strong>Rochelle Dorley</strong>: Uh, Natalie? Davis? Natalie Davis?</p>
<p>(Natalie timidly raises her hand.) </p>
<p><strong>Rochelle Dorley</strong>: You're next, hon.</p>
<p>CUT TO: [OFFICE]</p>
<p>(Rochelle Dorley sits behind her desk and interviews Natalie.) </p>
<p><strong>Rochelle Dorley</strong>: Ooh-ee. Izzy Delancy. Hoity-toity, hmm? It's a real shame what happened to him, huh? Were you there for all that nonsense?</p>
<p>(Natalie shakes her head.) </p>
<p><strong>Rochelle Dorley</strong>: Too bad, huh?</p>
<p>(She giggles.)</p>
<p><strong>Rochelle Dorley</strong>: You're a little lawbreaker. Says here, you ... uh ... prefer to be paid in cash. You like working off the books, huh? Good ol' Uncle Sam probably not too happy about that, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Natalie</strong>: (stutters) That's ... because ... I-I ...</p>
<p><strong>Rochelle Dorley</strong>: (taunts) Uh, uh, uh, ooh, uh, uh.</p>
<p>(She laughs.)</p>
<p><strong>Rochelle Dorley</strong>: You speak English, you got all your papers. No, fine. It's fine. But in a seriousness, you wouldn't mind having your fingerprints done? See, we were lucky enough to get a contract for the municipal buildings downtown. You know, mayor's office, police department.</p>
<p><strong>Natalie Davis</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(Natalie looks at her fingertips.) </p>
<p><strong>Rochelle Dorley</strong>: But, you know, they require a background check for anyone going to work in that building, even temps.</p>
<p><strong>Natalie Davis</strong>: Sure. That'd be okay.</p>
<p><strong>Rochelle Dorley</strong>: Yeah ... Listen, hon, you seem like a real nice girl, real nice, but we're called Platinum Maids for a reason. I-I just don't see the sparkle.</p>
<p><strong>Natalie Davis</strong>: No. No, I'm very good. And I have exceptional attention to detail.</p>
<p><strong>Rochelle Dorley</strong>: You clean in between the blinds?</p>
<p><strong>Natalie Davis</strong>: No. More like memory. I can see a room one time and remember where everything is.</p>
<p><strong>Rochelle Dorley</strong>: After just one time?</p>
<p><strong>Natalie Davis</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>Rochelle Dorley</strong>: Okay. Describe the reception area.</p>
<p><strong>Natalie Davis</strong>: There's a lavender orchid on the reception desk. It's top bloom is about to open. A glass coffee cup with a chip on the edge, a half inch of coffee still in the cup. Cut glass bowl full of chocolate kisses -- two gold, one purple. A glass vase with a rose etched in the glass, three leaves etched on its stalk.</p>
<p><strong>Rochelle Dorley</strong>: You sit tight. I got some choices for you.</p>
<p>(Rochelle gets up and steps away from her desk for a moment.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – FORENSIC AUTOPSY]</p>
<p>(David Phillips washes the body as Nick snaps photos.) </p>
<p>[INT. TREVOR DELL'S APARTMENT – BATHROOM]</p>
<p>(Sara is in the bathroom snapping photos of the sink and broken glass, the bottle of bleach on the floor, the blood on the tile.) </p>
<p>(Sara runs the ALS along the bathroom floor tile and up on the sink.) </p>
<p>[INT. TREVOR DELL'S APARTMENT – LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Out in the living room, Warrick flips through the unopened mail. He puts the mail down and checks Ernie's laptop computer. He finds many INSTANT MESSAGES from LADYLUCK172, MIXER57, UMENOW, PINUPVIXEN, LOCOWEEDER, and many others.) </p>
<p>(PRE-LAP) <strong>Warrick</strong>: (V.O.) Victim's cell phone and IM logs -- </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – BREAKROOM – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Grissom, Sara, Warrick and Nick meet to share their findings.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: -- show no activity for the past twelve days. So far, that's the best I can do for a time of death.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: According to the doc, COD was cerebral hemorrhage due to multiple blunt force trauma.</p>
<p>(Grissom looks at the report.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The head injuries are consistent with the bloodstains on the sink and the wall behind it. It does suggest a struggle.</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: [BATHROOM] Trevor Dell fights with the killer, who bashes his head into the mirror. Trevor falls to the floor. End of flash.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It's ... kind of up close and personal for this killer.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hodges ran fabric, paint, glue, and plastic samples of the Trevor doll. The materials were consistent with the previous minis.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No luck with that print?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It was only a partial, not enough to put through AFIS. But there were epithelials in the print. Wendy's running DNA.</p>
<p>(Grissom looks a the photo of the partial print on the back of the TREVOR DELL miniature doll.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. NOTURLITTLEBISQUEDOLL (HOBBY SHOP) – DAY] </p>
<p>(Miniature rooms are set up in the display case. Natalie leans down and looks at them. On the other side of the display case, ART SCHUSTER also leans down to look at Natalie.) </p>
<p><strong>Art Schuster</strong>: Hello there. Can I help you?</p>
<p><strong>Natalie Davis</strong>: I need to order a special part.</p>
<p><strong>Art Schuster</strong>: Well, why don't you just check out our spaceship isle. Yeah. I just need to help this little fellow here.</p>
<p>(Art goes to help the kid. Natalie stops and stares at the locomotive in the display case.) </p>
<p><strong>Art Schuster</strong>: Look, you really need to buy these polyhedral dice. Just in case. You're always losing them, man.</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: VARIOUS CUTS OF ERNIE DELL'S TRAIN VILLAGE in all its gory detail – dead, bloodied people viciously beaten on the sidewalks, the graveyard, etc.) </p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
[INT. NATALIE'S APARTMENT – BEDROOM – NIGHT (FLASHBACK)] </p>
<p>(Natalie sits on the bed and talks with Ernie, who is off screen. We see Ernie's reflection in the mirror behind her. He walks into the room, agitated.) </p>
<p><strong>Ernie Dell</strong>: I just come from the police. They showed me your miniatures and they showed me some pictures of some dead people. The cops know I helped you put some of that stuff together. They know I-I-I delivered that package to the old lady's house, like you asked me to. They think I killed, I killed all those people. </p>
<p><strong>Natalie Davis</strong>: You didn't. </p>
<p><strong>Ernie Dell</strong>: Natalie, did you kill them? (insistent) Did you kill those people?</p>
<p><strong>Natalie Davis</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Ernie Dell</strong>: Why? </p>
<p>(Natalie's eyes widen. She looks like a child being caught doing something wrong and doesn't understand what it was.) </p>
<p><strong>Ernie Dell</strong>: They're going to put you in jail, honey </p>
<p>(Ernie puts a hand to his head and sighs heavily. He looks around, trying to think of something. He looks at her.)</p>
<p><strong>Ernie Dell</strong>: Unless there's something else? If you had a good reason... they'll listen to that. Raymundo ... did he put his hands on you?</p>
<p>(Ernie kneels in front of Natalie.) </p>

<p>(She heads to her janitor's cart and picks up the box. She puts it on Grissom's desk and opens it. She reaches inside the box – </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. HOTEL/CASINO – FLOOR – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Grissom and Catherine cross the floor on their way out.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The Great Rainone is in great denial. Of course, losing a child at the hands of another could do that to you. You do agree that Natalie killed Chloe, right?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, I was just wondering what it must've looked like to her.</p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
(Natalie watches from up in the tree house. She sees her father run back to Chloe.) </p>
<p><strong>Christopher Davis</strong>: Hey! Chloe!</p>
<p>(He reaches Chloe and kneels beside her. He looks desperately around at the people gathering around them. He checks on Chloe.) </p>
<p>FREEZE FRAME: The scene below freezes. Natalie can see the detail of everything.</p>
<p>END OF FLASHBACK.</p>
<p>[INT. ELEVATOR -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Natalie is in the moving elevator going up. The elevator stops and the doors open.) </p>
<p>[INT. GARAGE – LEVEL 10 -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Natalie steps out of the elevator. She walks over to a particular car and stops.) </p>
<p>[INT. CSI – GRISSOM'S OFFICE – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Grissom opens his office door and walks inside. He sees it immediately and walks over to his desk.)</p>
<p>(There is the latest miniature crime scene – an overturned red Mustang over a body, the victim's hand is outstretched onto the sand.) </p>
<p>(Grissom leans forward to study it carefully.) </p>
<p>(The victim's hand is moving.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. GARAGE – LEVEL 10 -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(The car alarm chirps off as SARA opens her door. She puts her kit inside.)</p>
<p>(NATALIE is right there watching her.) </p>
<p><strong>Natalie Davis</strong>: Sara?</p>
<p>[INT. CSI – GRISSOM'S OFFICE – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Grissom takes a tissue and lifts the car off.)</p>
<p>(Underneath is the miniature SARA SIDLE complete with moving hand.) </p>
<p>(We hold on Grissom.) </p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[INT. GARAGE – LEVEL 10 -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Police car lights flash red and blue. Brass makes his way to SARA'S parked car. Officers on the scene are already scouring the grounds for evidence.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (to radio) Control, this is Jim Brass. </p>
<p><strong>Control</strong>: (from radio) Go ahead, Captain.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (to radio) Yeah, we found Sara Sidle's car, but she's missing. There's no sign of her. </p>
<p>(He notes the open trunk and keys on the ground. Her kit is in the back.) </p>
<p><strong>Control</strong>: (from radio) Copy that, Captain. Is there sufficient activation to post an APB?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (to radio) Looks like an abduction.</p>
<p>(He hangs up.) </p>
<p><strong>Control</strong>: (from radio) Copy.</p>
<p>(Sara's phone is in the back next to her kit. It starts ringing.) </p>
<p>(Brass notes the caller ID: GRISSOM.) </p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[INT. CSI – HALLWAY – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Grissom is on the phone.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (mutters) Come on, Sara, pick up. Please pick up.</p>
<p>(There's no answer. He hangs up. Grissom reaches Reception.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Who was in my office while I was gone?</p>
<p><strong>Judy Tremont</strong>: No one. Just some girl from Janitorial. She went in, vacuumed, emptied out the trash. That's all.</p>
<p>(Grissom stops and heads back.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – LAYOUT ROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Greg, Nick, Warrick and Catherine are in the room examining the latest miniature.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: The doll's still alive. That means Sara's still alive.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Generic stretch of desert. She could be anywhere in a four-state radius.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Let's just focus on the details. There's always something to go on.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: She has to make these in advance, right? But how do you plan a car wreck? There's no way to know how the car's going to land.</p>
<p>(Nick examines the car.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Unless you wreck the car first, and then put her under it.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I think I got a VIN number.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Give me the first six.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: King-Sam-Victor-four-five-three.</p>
<p>(Greg puts the number into the computer and runs a search.) </p>
<p>(Grissom walks in with a file.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Her name is Natalie Davis, and she works for our janitorial service.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Here in the lab?</p>
<p>(Catherine looks at a copy of her ID badge and info.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: For over a month. She's never been arrested, so there's nothing to flag on a security check. She used Ernie Dell's address on her work form. She has no home phone and no driver's license.</p>
<p>(The computer beeps.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Okay, I got it. </p>
<p>(A screen appears on the monitor:<br />
?282-040607 INCIDENT DATE<br />
2007 RED MUSTANG ACCIDENT<br />
CAR FLIPPED OVER<br />
LOCATION: ALLEY BEHIND THE TRIP WIRE BAR<br />
FRINE ST. &amp; DORISA AVE.<br />
FATALITY, DRIVER IDENTIFIED AS NOLAND</p>
<p>(The second screen reads:<br />

CRIME SCENE DESCRIPTION:<br />
RED MUSTANG 2007 TURNED OVER<br />
DRIVER NOLAND WELLER EJECTED FROM DRIVER'S SEAT<br />
VICTIM TOXICOLOGY FOUND ALCOHOL IN SYSTEM )</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: A 2007 red Mustang totaled outside The Trip Wire Bar six weeks ago. Driver fatality. DWI. Car went to scrap. Lead CSI on the case -- Sara Sidle.</p>
<p>(Everyone is quiet as they absorb this information.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Pull up the case photos.</p>
<p>(Greg pulls up the photos. He clicks on the first one of SARA and GRISSOM at the scene with some of the bystanders behind them. NATALIE is in the photo.) </p>
<p>(He compares the photo with the file photo.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Oh, my God. She was at the crime scene.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So, she salvages the car, and somehow gets it out to the desert, and then grabs Sara, and puts her under it?</p>
<p>(Grissom rubs his mouth nervously as it all hits home with him.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I don't get it. What does Sara have to do with bleach?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I don't know. This just feels different.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (dazed) It is different. </p>
<p>(Quick flash of: [CRIME SCENE] Natalie stands just behind SARA and GRISSOM beyond the crime scene tape. Grissom takes the camera from Sara. He slowly runs his hand down her bare arm.) </p>
<p>(Natalie sees the caress and sees SARA.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This girl holds me responsible for the death of Ernie Dell. I took away the only person she ever loved, so she's going to do the same thing to me.</p>
<p>(Everyone is very, very quiet.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's not about a psychotic reaction to bleach, or some dead sister or the doll. </p>
<p>(He looks at Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (absently) &quot;NotUrLittleBisqueDoll...&quot;</p>
<p>(Grissom rushes out of the room. Everyone is left there looking at each other.) </p>
<p>[INT. CSI – HALLWAY / GRISSOM'S OFFICE – CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Grissom heads back to his office. He sits at his desk and puts his glasses on. He's online at his computer and is scrolling down through items for sale.) </p>
<p>(He clicks on the MINIATURE FURNITURE TABLE SET from NOTURLITTLEBISQUEDOLL.) </p>
<p>(NOTURLITTLEBISQUEDOLL is located in Las Vegas, NV, with 7 Bids, 100% positive, since Jun-14-97 in United States (Las Vegas).)</p>
<p>(Grissom picks up the phone and dials.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to phone) This is Gil Grissom at CSI. I need to get an Attorney General's Waiver.</p>
<p>SMASH CUT TO: </p>
<p>[INT. NATALIE'S LAIR -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(The door bursts open. Sofia, followed by several officers, head through the small apartment. They go through the rooms.) </p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong>: (o.s.) She went out the window!</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: (to radio) She's headed for the alley </p>
<p>(Sofia turns around and sees Natalie's workstation set-up in the middle of her living room.) </p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong>: (o.s.) Freeze!</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. STRIP – NIGHT – CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Natalie scrambles down the fire escape. The light show has started.)</p>
<p>(She hurries down the steps, reaches the ground and stumbles as she enters the crowd of people there to see the light show.) </p>
<p>(An officer jumps down to the ground right behind her.) </p>
<p>[EXT. THE STRIP – SIDEWALK – NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Natalie runs out into the sidewalk. She takes deep panicked breaths. It's too much for her. She can barely walk straight – the people, the lights, the music.) </p>
<p>(Natalie tilts and turns. Her vision is blurred and she doesn't know where she's going. She continues to make her way through the crowd of visitors.) </p>
<p>(Nick and Warrick walk through the crowd, looking for Natalie.) </p>
<p>(Natalie has stopped walking, her eyes focused on the light show above her.)</p>
<p>(Nick sees her and makes his way over to her.) </p>
<p>(Natalie tilts and turns.) </p>
<p>(Warrick makes his way to her.) </p>
<p>(Natalie collapses to her hands and knees.) </p>
<p>(Nick and Warrick reach her. They help her to her feet. Natalie screams and struggles to get out of their hold.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The sky lights up as lightning flashes and thunder rumbles.) </p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – OUTSIDE INTERVIEW ROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Natalie sits inside the interview room, her arms on the table. Through the window, Brass and Grissom watch her.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I don't want to waste time screwing around with this nutcase. I'm going to get some bleach and drip it on her until she gives up the location. And they can't accuse us of police brutality for that.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I want to talk to her, Jim. Alone.</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – INTERVIEW ROOM -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(The door opens and Grissom walks in. He walks up to the chair. Natalie puts her head down and doesn't look at him.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hi, Natalie. My name's Gil. It's so nice to finally meet you. I ... uh ... probably shouldn't say this, but ... I'm a huge fan. </p>
<p>(She looks at him.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I've been a crime scene investigator for 22 years. I've worked over two-thousand homicides, and you are by far ... the best I've ever seen. I mean ... </p>
<p>(He turns the chair and sits down to face her.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: ... you're such a great artist. And to be so young and so talented and ... so pretty. I've thought about you every night for the last nine months. I even tried to do what you do. I built my own miniature. </p>
<p>(She nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You saw it? </p>
<p>(She nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How'd I do?</p>
<p>(She shrugs. Not too good.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Do you play chess? </p>
<p>(She shakes her head.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I play as a hobby. It quiets my mind, you know? Soothes me. At one point, I became so consumed by it that whenever I closed my eyes, I could see the chess pieces moving all around the board. I was obsessed with correcting all my bad moves. I wondered if a game could ever be played without a mistake. I'd love to play you sometime. </p>
<p>(Natalie smiles.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm so impressed by the way you embrace your passion. You'd make a great CSI. This last one was brilliant. You studied our crime scene so well. Tracking the car to the junkyard and then towing it all the way out to the desert where you knew we wouldn't find it. And then ... the way you killed Sara.</p>
<p>(She gasps and shakes her head slowly.) </p>
<p><strong>Natalie Davis</strong>: I didn't kill her.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You didn't?</p>
<p>(She shakes her head.) </p>
<p>(She watches Grissom, then her eyes become sharper, colder.) </p>
<p><strong>Natalie Davis</strong>: This is about her. Her, her, her! It's always about her!</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No, it isn't, Natalie. It's about you. </p>
<p><strong>Natalie Davis</strong>: It's always about her.</p>
<p>(She has something in her mouth and takes out a RAZOR BLADE. She holds it up and shows it to Grissom.)</p>
<p>(Grissom's eyes widen. TOO LATE! She reaches out and swings the razor in an arc, slashing Grissom's neck. He gasps and grabs his neck, blood pouring out between his fingers.) </p>
<p>(Natalie watches the blood on his hands with fascination.) </p>
<p><strong>Natalie Davis</strong>: (sing-song)<br />
&quot;Oh, sad was the day for the little bisque doll, for they cut all her stitches away,<br />
(Grissom gasps as he bleeds.) </p>
<p><strong>Natalie Davis</strong>: (sing-song)<br />
and found the seat of the terrible ache;<br />
T'was a delicate task...&quot;</p>
<p>ABRUPT CUT TO: </p>
<p>(It's only a DELUSION. Grissom's unhurt in front of her, his voice rising insistently at her. The song Natalie started continues.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (insistent) Natalie, listen to me -- tell me where she is.</p>
<p>(Natalie stares off in front of her – lost in whatever world her mind created for her, reciting the eerie lines to the song in the same child-like, distant voice.) </p>
<p><strong>Natalie Davis</strong>: (sing-song)<br />
&quot;For none of the doctors had ever before<br />
performed on a dolly's inside.&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Natalie. Please tell me where Sara is.</p>
<p><strong>Natalie Davis</strong>: (sing-song)<br />
&quot;They tried to re-stuff her but didn't know how, and this was her wail as she died...&quot;</p>
<p>(Grissom grabs Natalie's shoulders and shakes her.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (shouts) STOP IT! Just stop this! Tell me where Sara is!</p>
<p><strong>Natalie Davis</strong>: (sing-song)<br />
&quot;I've got a pain in my sawdust.&quot; </p>
<p>(Grissom lets her go and rubs his mouth with his hand. There's no way he's going to get any rational information out of her. Natalie's withdrawn into her own fantasy.) </p>
<p><strong>Natalie Davis</strong>: (sing-song)<br />
&quot;That's what's the matter with me.&quot;</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. SOMEWHERE OUT IN THE DESERT – NIGHT]</p>
<p>TOP VIEW DOWN: It's dark and raining. The overturned red Mustang is smashed and damaged. We move down closer to the car.</p>
<p><strong>Natalie Davis</strong>: (V.O.)<br />
&quot;Something is wrong with my little inside.<br />
I'm just as sick as can be.&quot; </p>
<p>(Just like her miniature, SARA'S arm is sticking out from under the car she's pinned under.) </p>
<p>(Her hand moves.) </p>
<p><strong>Natalie Davis</strong>: (V.O.)<br />
&quot;Don't let me faint. Someone get me a fan.<br />
Someone please run for the medicine man.&quot; </p>
<p>(Just like the miniature, SARA'S fingers reach out slowly and sink into the wet mud.)</p>
<p><strong>Natalie Davis</strong>: (V.O.)<br />
&quot;Everyone hurry as fast as you can,<br />
(Just like the miniature, the movement is repeated over and over again. Sara's head can be seen under the overturned car.) </p>
<p><strong>Natalie Davis</strong>: (V.O.)<br />
'cause I've got a pain in my sawdust.&quot;</p>
<p>TOP VIEW DOWN: We pull back on the overturned car, the rain merciless as it pelts down on the scene below. </p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>
<p>TO BE CONTINUED</p>
<p><strong>End</strong></p>

							<p>FLASH IN: </p>
<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) – NIGHT]</p>
<p>[INT. RESIDENCE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(The city is lit outside the window. The camera pulls back and passes a crackling fire inside the large, spacious living room. A cat meows and runs across the wood-paneled floor, disappearing behind the large bookshelf.) </p>
<p>(The camera continues through the spacious room. There are bookshelves, couches and modern-styled lamps. Up against the wall there are filled vases. Paper crunching is heard and a light shines down from above. The camera continues around the room.) </p>
<p>(More paper crunching is heard. More light appears from above, illuminating the room.)</p>
<p>(The camera swings around and lingers on a LAS VEGAS GLOBE newspaper on the desk with the headline, &quot;Another Body Found!&quot;)</p>
<p>(The paper crunching continues. Camera swings around the miniature desk and pulls back from the miniature chair. Light shines from above as Grissom lifts the lid to the room.) </p>
<p>(He can't believe his eyes and stares at the latest diorama.) </p>
<p>[INT. CSI – GRISSOM'S OFFICE / HALLWAY – NIGHT – CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Grissom reaches down and lifts the miniature room out of the box. We're looking up from the room at Grissom. He carries the diorama and heads out of his office.) </p>
<p>(He rushes carefully through the hallway. He glances to the side and shouts.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Catherine, layout room, right away!</p>
<p>(He continues toward the layout room.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (o.s.) Where're you going? </p>
<p>(The elevator bell dings. Grissom continues toward the layout room.) </p>
<p>[INT. CSI – LAYOUT ROOM – CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(He sets the diorama down on the table.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (o.s.) Gil, where's the fire?</p>
<p>(Catherine appears next to Grissom as they both look at the latest miniature.) </p>
<p>TOP VIEW DOWN: This miniature has a person sitting on a long, black sofa.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's been sitting in my office for the last four weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: But ... we caught the 'miniature serial killer'; he confessed.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, I watched him blow his brains out. But I think the package was postmarked after he killed himself.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So maybe he arranged to have it sent postmortem.</p>
<p>(Grissom turns the diorama.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The three other murders, the miniature was left at the scene. This one was addressed to me.</p>
<p>(Grissom uses the magnifying glass and examines the room.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, now it's personal?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The victim appears to be a Caucasian female with lots of books. It could be an office, somebody's living room ... or a modern hotel lobby. When I was gone, did anybody work a scene like this?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No ... at least not on our shift. </p>
<p>(Grissom notes the miniature newspaper on the table.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'll check with days and swing, and see if anybody caught a case that matches.</p>
<p>(Catherine turns to leave, but Grissom stops her.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Never mind.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Why not?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Take a look at the early edition. </p>
<p>(Grissom hands Catherine the magnifying glass. The date is SATURDAY, FEBRUARY<br />
17, 2007.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It's dated the day after tomorrow. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This murder hasn't happened yet.</p>
<p>SMASH CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[INT. CSI – LAYOUT ROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Grissom snaps photos of the diorama. He snaps a photo of the three vases and of the newspaper on the miniature desk, of the coffee table with miniature tea set and of the woman on the couch. He continues snapping photos.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – BREAK ROOM -- NIGHT</p>
<p>(Sara, Nick and Warrick watch the video.) </p>
<p><strong>Ernie Dell</strong>: (from video) My name is Ernest Edward Dell. I was born in 1946 in Ames, Iowa. My life's been hard, but I don't complain. I never expected better. </p>
<p>(On the video, he takes a sip of his cup.) </p>
<p><strong>Ernie Dell</strong>: (from video) I'm good with my hands. I make things. I fix things. I'm a handyman. That's what I am.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – LAYOUT ROOM – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(VARIOUS DISSOLVES OF: Grissom puts the photos on the board lining the wall.) </p>
<p><strong>Ernie Dell</strong>: (V.O.) I'm not the sociable type. I-I know that. You spend any amount of time around people, you get your heart broke -- treachery, hypocrisy ... the promise of love.</p>
<p>[VIDEO]</p>
<p><strong>Ernie Dell</strong>: (from video) A man has a right to an honest day's pay. Me, I service the machinery of death so that people can eat. If that makes me evil, then so be it.</p>
<p>(They pause the video.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The ‘Miniature Killer' murdered three people over a period of roughly six months. Ernie Dell was either directly or indirectly related to all of them.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What's with the bloody dolls?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We're not sure. There's a different perspective of that same image in all of the miniatures. (She hands Warrick an enlarged photo.) We're thinking it could be some kind of signature.</p>
<p>(The video resumes.) </p>
<p><strong>Ernie Dell</strong>: (from video) Look into the mouth of a person and you'll find lies wriggling there like maggots waiting to grow wings. The world has ... has gone mad. A man could kill from sunup to sunset, and still his work would never be done.</p>
<p>(Ernie takes the gun, puts it under his chin and fires. Sara, Nick and Warrick flinch. Sara pauses the video.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Remember the Blue Paint killers? Maybe Ernie Dell had a partner. Like an apprentice, an accomplice, something like that.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Or a disciple.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You guys make models when you were kids?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Tanks and airplanes.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Classic cars.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: These miniatures are obsessively precise, half-inch scale models of the crime scenes. They probably took weeks of focused effort to create. I don't think the killer's into team sports.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Izzy Delancy ... he was a rock star. You know, famous brings out the nut jobs. Maybe we're just looking at a copycat.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The miniatures were never released to the press. No photos, nothing. You can't copy what you can't see.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Other people had access to those files. Maybe it was a cop. Or somebody in the lab. It's been known to happen.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, so, Ernie Dell takes the rap for three murders, and then eats a .38. Why?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I think he was trying to protect someone -- someone he cared a lot about.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – LAYOUT ROOM]</p>
<p>(SCOPE VIEW: Of the purse. Grissom checks the inside of the purse and finds it empty.) </p>
<p>(Catherine walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Prints and DNA are going over the package and wrapping paper.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: They won't find anything. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Return address was an empty lot. Any clue as to who the victim is?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No, I even went through her little purse.</p>
<p>(Catherine puts her glasses on and looks at the miniature.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, she's not wearing a wedding ring. She's probably single. Her eyes appear to be bloodshot. Petechial hemorrhaging, maybe?</p>
<p>(Grissom notices something on the pillows.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Look at this.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Blue smudges on the pillow. Blue mascara on the victim. </p>
<p>(Catherine leans forward and looks through the miniature's window and visualizes the woman lying down on the couch.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Our vic gets comfortable, grabs a little shut-eye ...</p>
<p>(Someone leans over her and smothers her with a pillow. She struggles and stops.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: ... and never wakes up.</p>
<p>(The people in the miniature vanish. Catherine straightens and looks at Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: She's going to be smothered.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It would seem so.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: If you interpret this headline literally, the doll is the victim. That's different than the others.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Methods change. Killers evolve.</p>
<p>(It sounds familiar to Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Keppler said something like that once. (She looks at Grissom.) He did come down on the right side.</p>
<p>(Grissom nods. He looks at the books on the shelf.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: These books are all arranged by subject matter: art, religion, science ... The victim is apparently well-educated.</p>
<p>(Grissom looks on the shelf and sees a framed photo of Izzy carrying his baby.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: That's from the Izzy Delancy miniature. What's it doing here?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I don't know.</p>
<p>(Grissom picks up the framed photo and looks at it. He turns it over and sees the doll image.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: There's something on the surface. Looks like brush strokes.</p>
<p>(Catherine shines the light on it and reveals the word: YOU.)</p>
<p>(Grissom goes straight for the pillow on the couch – the same pillow form the Penny Garden miniature. He puts it on the table next to the framed photo. On the shelf he picks out the window covering from the Mannleigh miniature and puts that on the table as well. Under the light it reveals:<br />
YOU WERE WRONG )</p>
<p>(We hold on Grissom.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) – DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. FILE STORAGE WAREHOUSE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Sara walks along the rows of file boxes. Greg turns the corner and walks over to her. He's in a suit.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Hey, Sara, I heard we got another miniature. Is that true?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah, looks like Ernie Dell was covering for someone.</p>
<p>(Sara pulls a file box off the side and hands it to Greg. She grabs another for herself.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: No kidding?</p>
<p>(They head out with the two boxes.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey, you were the one who checked for next of kin after his suicide, right?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: SOP. Snail mail, email, bank accounts, police records, Google. All I got was he's a widower. Received his wife's Social Security benefits.</p>
<p>(They put the two boxes down on the table.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: He had to be connected to somebody.</p>
<p>(Sara cuts the tape on the box while Greg puts on his gloves.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It's kind of early for court.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Finally rescheduled my deposition for the civil suit.</p>
<p>(Sara opens the file box.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: You know, Demitrius James's family is suing the city for 3.5 million.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: That's going to be a long deposition.</p>
<p>(They go through the items in the box. Under the shirts, Sara finds a stack of video tapes. The top one is labeled SUMMER '87.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Home movies.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – HALLWAY / LAYOUT ROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(The hallways are sparse while the janitors mop the floor. In the layout room, Grissom is still going over the latest diorama with a magnifying glass. He looks at the books on the shelves and the flowers in the vases. He goes back to the books on the shelves.) </p>
<p>(He pulls out a particular book and looks at it. He puts it down, then notices the black cat resting on the bookshelf. Grissom picks up the black cat and looks at it.) </p>
<p>(Hodges knocks on the door before entering.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Hey, boss. We're ordering out for breakfast.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (interrupts) You have a cat, don't you, Hodges?</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Mr. K. Kobayashi-Maru. It's in reference to ...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Do you ever take him out of the house?</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: My little Kobe? No way. Vegas is coyote country.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So if this is a house cat, then this must be somebody's home.</p>
<p>(He looks at the cat and notices the white around the mouth.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Tsk, tsk. Looks like he's been in the milk.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah. Maybe the victim has as well. The previous murders have all involved the vic's habits and routines. So maybe this time, it's a little something extra in her afternoon tea.</p>
<p>(Grissom and Hodges leans forward to look at the tea set on the coffee table.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: So they're going to be poisoned.</p>
<p>(Flash to: The woman finishes her tea and lies back on the couch. She puts a pillow over her face. The cat sips the milk on the tea tray and jumps on the shelf.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) She lays down for her usual nap, the cat sneaks a sip, and neither one ever wakes up again.</p>
<p>(End of flash.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It doesn't matter how she dies if we can't figure out who she is or where she is.</p>
<p>(Hodges glances at his watch.) </p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: Well, you can't figure that out on an empty stomach. If you don't like this restaurant, there's plenty of others to choose from.</p>
<p>(Grissom looks at the DELIVERY ZONE on the back of the menu from Hodges.) </p>
<p>(Grissom puts the menu down and looks at the diorama. On the bottom of the coffee table, Grissom picks up two miniature order menus for the KRISPY WOK and the TANDOORI TEMPLE.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I choose these two.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – A/V LAB -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(The fax prints the KRISPY WOK menu. Grissom looks at the delivery area on the back of the menu. He marks the area on the computer map in green.) </p>
<p>(He prints out another KRISPY WOK menu and marks that area on the computer map. He does so with the additional KRISPY WOK delivery areas.)</p>
<p>(He prints out a TANDOORI TEMPLE menu and does the same for that eating area. He marks it on the map in red. He does the same for the other TANDOORI TEMPLE menus and delivery areas.) </p>
<p>(He finds the area where the two eating places overlap and marks it CROSSING DELIVERY.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) – DAY]</p>
<p>[EXT. SIDEWALK -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Brass briefs the officers.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We're looking for a building whose exterior looks exactly like this.</p>
<p>(He gives them a photo of the exterior of the miniature. The officers spread out to canvass the area. Brass makes a call on his cell.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (from phone) Talk to me.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (to phone) So what are we looking at, Rick? We've got a modernist structure with cement beams, steel rails, frosted glass.</p>
<p>INTERCUT WITH: </p>
<p>[ANOTHER SIDEWALK]</p>
<p>(Warrick is walking and talking on the phone.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (from phone) Something like that.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (to phone) Probably, but whatever it is, it should match exactly. The killer's hyper-specific.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, maybe that'll work in our favor.</p>
<p>(Warrick hangs up. Nick is looking at the buildings around them.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Now, even if we find a match, we could already be too late.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p>(Warrick whacks Nick on the arm to get his attention and points to the building directly in front of them. It's exactly like the miniature.) </p>
<p>(Nick checks it against the photo.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Let's check it out.</p>
<p>(Warrick starts running toward the building. Nick motions for the officer to follow them.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: C'mon. C'mon.</p>
<p>[INT. BUILDING – LOBBY – DAY – CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Nick, Warrick and the officer enter the lobby and walk up to the manager behind the front counter.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Nick Stokes, LVPD. We're looking for a woman that lives in this building. She looks like this. (Nick shows him the photo of the miniature.) Have you ever seen her?</p>
<p>(The manager looks at the photo and scoffs.) </p>
<p><strong>Manager</strong>: That looks like a doll.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, well, it's actually a death threat. Time is of the essence here. Can you help us out? Anyone in the building look like this? No?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: She's got a cat.</p>
<p><strong>Manager</strong>: Well, that narrows it down to about a hundred tenants.</p>
<p>(Warrick puts a photo of the miniature down.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: That's her home.</p>
<p>(The manager looks at the photo and recognizes it immediately.) </p>
<p><strong>Manager</strong>: 1106. That's Ms. Tallman's place.</p>
<p>[INT. HALLWAY TO 1106 -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(The manager leads Nick, Warrick and the officer to 1106.) </p>
<p><strong>Dispatch</strong>: (over radio) All units responding to 3-5-0-4, 3-5-0-4. CSI Brown and Stokes have ID'd the building. Please respond.</p>
<p>(The manager points to the door. They stop and listen. Behind the door, they hear music playing. Nick knocks loudly on the door.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Ms. Tallman? Las Vegas Police. You need to open your door, please.</p>
<p>(There's no answer.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Ms. Tallman?</p>
<p>(There's no answer. Nick looks at Warrick. Everyone moves. Nick reaches for his gun and stands on the side of the door. Warrick motions toward the door.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (to manager) Open it and stand clear.</p>
<p>(The manager unlocks the door and steps aside. Nick opens the door and Warrick steps through, his gun out in front of him.) </p>
<p>[INT. TALLMAN APARTMENT – DAY]</p>
<p>(Warrick, Nick and the officer enter the apartment cautiously.) </p>
<p>TOP VIEW DOWN: It is the apartment, although no one is sleeping on the sofa. </p>
<p>(Nick notices that the sofa is empty. Music continues blasting through the apartment. The fire is burning in the fireplace. Nick sees a newspaper on the desk and the books on the shelf.)</p>
<p>(He hears a door open and close. Nick raises his gun as a woman returns. She sings along with the loud music, turns and sees the men in her apartment.) </p>
<p>(She screams.) </p>
<p>(Warrick puts his gun down and looks over at Nick.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Please, ma'am, calm down. We're with the Crime Lab.</p>

<p><strong>Barbara Tallman</strong>: Did you make this for me? That's very sweet.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It's a death threat.</p>
<p><strong>Barbara Tallman</strong>: Who would want to kill me?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Doctor, do you normally take a nap around the same time every day covering your face and eyes with the pillow?</p>
<p><strong>Barbara Tallman</strong>: (sleepily) Yes, at 4:00 p.m. I ... I have tea and cookies every day when I wake up. Have you been watching me?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No, Miss, no, but we think someone else has. Doctor, your life is in danger. We need you to get dressed and come with us, please.</p>
<p><strong>Barbara Tallman</strong>: Am I in trouble?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No, ma'am. No, not anymore. This officer will help you get your things, okay?</p>
<p><strong>Barbara Tallman</strong>: No, no, no. I'll go get my things.</p>
<p>(She starts to leave, then turns around.) </p>
<p><strong>Barbara Tallman</strong>: I want you to know that you young men are refreshingly polite. </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>(Dr. Tallman leaves. Warrick turns and looks at Nick.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Is she on something?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: She may have already been poisoned.</p>
<p>(The cat jumps on the table and starts drinking from the tea set.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We'll get her to the hospital.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: We should collect blood for tox.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: And any open food or drink.</p>

<p><strong>Greg</strong>: There's no record of a son, but it sure looks like it.</p>
<p>(On the monitor, the little boy glares at his birthday cake.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: One, two, three, four, five birthday candles in 1988 would make him around 24 now.</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: When my guys went to your house, they said you were a little out of it, but you're thinking clearly now, right?</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Can you tell me why anyone would want to kill you?</p>
<p><strong>Barbara Tallman</strong>: No.</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Can you tell me why one of her patients would want to kill her?</p>
<p><strong>Barbara Tallman</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Peyton Tallman</strong>: Well, no, it's-it's possible. She, um ... she counseled a lot of at-risk adults, um, halfway house kids, pro bono.</p>

<p><strong>Barbara Tallman</strong>: Won't say.</p>
<p><strong>Peyton Tallman</strong>: She can't say. It's doctor-patient confidentiality.</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No, we're not done yet. At least, I'm not done yet. All right, look, let's start again, all right? Let's ... Maybe we started off on the wrong foot, all right? Look, I'm asking you as a professional, as a psychotherapist, please ... help me out here.</p>

<p>(She looks at them, putting her hand out over the photos. She moves stiffly and awkwardly, but nothing too much out of place.) </p>
<p><strong>Barbara Tallman</strong>: Repetition ... attention to detail indicates obsessive-compulsive disorder. Obvious antisocial personality.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Uh, yeah, four bodies -- I'd call that antisocial.</p>
<p><strong>Barbara Tallman</strong>: Most murderers lack impulse control, inability to plan ahead, but ... this one's different.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Different how?</p>
<p><strong>Barbara Tallman</strong>: He conceives murder ... visualizes it. Then he takes all that horror that he's imagined. He compresses it into these little rooms. These models literally indicate repressed rage. And when you start taking that apart, all that rage comes flying out ... and you will have let the monster out of the box.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: There's chlorine bleach in the samples. Why put bleach in vase water?</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: I knew you'd ask that. Well, I had this girlfriend who was a florist ...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The one with the water retention problem.</p>
<p><strong>Hodges</strong>: You remembered. Anyway ... she said that if you add a few drops of bleach to your water, it kills bacteria, and gives your flowers a nice long life, but add too much ... the flowers die.</p>
<p>(Greg walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Grissom, we may have caught a break on Barbara Tallman. She did pro bono work at Lionel Dell's halfway house.</p>
<p>(Grissom removes his glasses at the news.) </p>

[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – INTERVIEW ROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Sofia and Sara interview Mitch Douglas.) </p>
<p><strong>Mitch Douglas</strong>: Okay, so maybe I met her. So what?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: So, she's dead. That's four stiffs associated with you, Lionel. Five, if you count Ernie.</p>
<p><strong>Mitch Douglas</strong>: I don't.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You know, you keep saying that you hated your dad, but I'm not buying it. </p>
<p>(Sara shows him the photos of the miniature crime scenes.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You go through your life alone. You're good with your hands. You have weird hobbies. You make little things. And when that gets tricky ... you call your father.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Maybe Ernie didn't know you were a killer. Police start poking around, asking questions, showing him pictures. And when Ernie sees these ... he knows exactly what his little boy's become.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: To the rest of the world, a monster, but to him ... just a little boy knocking over his birthday cake.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: So he confesses to crimes you committed, shoots himself in the head; it's a dead end for us.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: New start for you.</p>
<p><strong>Mitch Douglas</strong>: If only. Let me tell you about Ernie. What he cared about in this life was ... his wife, his trains, and his kids. In that order.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Kids? You're an only child.</p>
<p><strong>Mitch Douglas</strong>: (chuckles) Again, if only. If you're looking for a love connection, then ... then you should maybe go talk to one of the chosen ones.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: What are you talking about?</p>
<p><strong>Mitch Douglas</strong>: Fosters. My parents had, like ... dozens. They'd come and go, some before I was born. My mom loved kids. Dad loved Mom. I guess as soon as I came around ... the love ran out. And then Mom dies ... the kids leave ... and Ernie's left with me.</p>
<p>(He looks at them.) </p>
<p><strong>Mitch Douglas</strong>: Ernie didn't take a bullet for me. (shakes his head) But it's a beautiful thought.</p>

[INT. CSI – FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Robbins goes over the preliminary findings with Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: I pulled these fibers out of her nasal passages.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, they appear to be consistent with the sofa pillow cushion at the scene.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: COD was asphyxiation. Now ... what is wrong with this brain?</p>
<p>(He picks up the brain from the metal bin and shows it to Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Other than the fact that it's out of its skull? Pigmentation's unusual.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Bingo ... or keno or whatever you prefer. Pronounced lack of pigmentation near the midbrain, along with ... clearly diminished substantia nigra. She had Parkinson's.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Nick and Warrick did say that she was a little ... spacey when they met her, but they didn't mention any shaking.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Her disease was advanced. She was on some pretty heavy meds.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Would they have shown up on a poison tox panel?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: No, but those kinds of medications can cause abnormal thinking and behavior. Takes somebody with a very strong will to keep it hidden.</p>

[INT. CSI – HALLWAY / CATHERINE'S OFFICE]</p>
<p>(Grissom is heading into one of the labs when Catherine catches him.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey! How'd it go with the sheriff?</p>
<p>(Grissom steps into Catherine's office.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Media's all over him. Which means he's all over the undersheriff, who's all over Ecklie, who's blaming me for not going public with the Izzy Delancy miniature like he told me to.</p>
<p>(Catherine shows him the test results.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, I got the final trace report on the bleach water that spilled at the scene, but ... the fluid in the ear was biological. Water and proteins.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Lipocalin, lactoferrin, lysozyme. Tears.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (nods) Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The victim was crying?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The smudges are from the pillow. There were no tear tracks. I don't think the victim was crying. I think the killer was.</p>
<p>(Quick flash of: Peyton Tallman removes the pillow from Barbara's face. He cries.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) When you cry, your tears sometimes can pick up skin cells from your cheek.</p>
<p>(XCU: A single tear runs down his cheek and falls into Barbara's ear cavity.) </p>
<p>END OF FLASHBACK</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT – INTERVIEW ROOM]</p>
<p>(Catherine interviews Peyton Tallman. She shows him the test results.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The DNA in your tears that were found on your sister's body proves that you were there. I imagine it was the hardest thing you've ever done. But you did it.</p>
<p><strong>Peyton Tallman</strong>: You should've seen Barbara when she was young. She was fierce. And fearless. She protected me. She was the smartest, the funniest, best friend I could ask for in life. The Parkinson's just robbed her of everything. She'd take medication; she'd go away. She'd get off medication. She'd become lucid again, only in agony. She wanted to die in her own home.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: There's no ... assisted suicide protection in Nevada.</p>
<p><strong>Peyton Tallman</strong>: She said this was the perfect opportunity. She could get what she wanted, and ... everyone would blame the ‘Miniature Killer.'</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I understand. You're under arrest.</p>

[INT. CSI – A/V LAB] </p>
<p>(On the monitor is the video footage from the birthday party held on MARCH 7, 1988. Then entire train is filled with kids.) </p>
<p>(Sara and Grissom are watching the video tapes.) </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: We reran the footage several times to get a head count. Assuming that they're all Dell foster kids, there's 13 of them.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: At this birthday party?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah. Lionel only remembered the first names, and only a few of those. Getting the DHS records is going to be tough. Judges hate giving them out unless we can demonstrate a pressing need ... and even then, they're spotty. And a lot of a foster kids change their names when they age out.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Ernie Dell confessed and killed himself to protect someone he loved. And that someone has murdered five people.</p>
<p>(The kids on the video look like they're having fun – girls and boys.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Eenie, meeny, miney, mo. Catch a monster by the toe.</p>
<p>(On the video, one of the boys elbows another boy. A dark-haired girl stops him. The boy being elbowed turns and looks at the monitor.)</p>
<p>(The video ends.) </p>

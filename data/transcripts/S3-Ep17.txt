<p>(People are eating at the local grille.)</p>
<p>(ELAINE ALCOTT walks out of the restroom.)</p>
<p>(HANK PEDDIGREW sits at a table.)</p>
<p>(Friends wave to each other from their tables in front of the large picture glass windows.)</p>
<p>(FRED LYCHOCK, the Restaurant Manager, smiles at the waiter. He turns and sees a car heading toward the restaurant at a fast speed. He stops smiling and watches the car.)</p>
<p>(The car doesn't stop at the light, nor does it turn. It continues through the intersection and straight for the windows. The Restaurant Manager takes note of it and watches the car approach the windows, helpless to do anything.)</p>
<p>(The waiter drops the tray he's carrying, his eyes fixed on the speeding car. The beer glasses hit the floor and shatters.)</p>
<p>(The car crosses the sidewalk and heads straight for the glass windows.)</p>
<p>(The car hits the windows and doesn't stop. The people sitting at the tables in front of the windows crash to the floor. The car plows through the windows, tables and people.)</p>
<p>(Patrons scream as they dive to get out of the way of the speeding car.)</p>
<p>(The car crashes through the establishments' tables. The waiter hits his head against the car's windshield, blood spattering across the glass.)</p>
<p>(The driver hits the car horn and it blares.)</p>

[INT. CHECKERBOX BAR &amp; GRILLE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The woman driver is slumped against the steering wheel. Fire personnel use a crowbar to get the door open.)</p>
<p>(It's raining outside. GRISSOM, SARA and CATHERINE walk in to the restaurant through the broken glass windows. Emergency personnel cart away survivors on gurneys. ELAINE ALCOTT is on the gurney, her neck in a brace, as it passes the CSIs.)</p>
<p>(BRASS speaks to someone on his cell phone as the CSI's make their way toward him.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (to phone) Yeah, yeah. No. All right. Yeah, hold on, hold on. (puts phone aside) Happy hour. Joint was packed. Two fatalities, four critical. </p>
<p>(BRASS pushes his way past them. CATHERINE stops him.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: How about the driver?</p>
<p>(BRASS turns around to answer her.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Non-responsive.</p>
<p>(BRASS heads out. Behind, we hear HANK PEDDIGREW giving instructions.)</p>
<p><strong>Hank Peddigrew</strong>: (b.g.) I've got a GCS of three. I need to intubate.</p>
<p>(SARA turns around and sees HANK working on an injured patron on a gurney.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to GRISSOM) That's Sara's boyfriend.</p>
<p><strong>Hank Peddigrew</strong>: (looks up) Hey, Sara. Typical Thursday.</p>
<p>(SARA looks around and notices his injury.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hank? Your wrist is broken.</p>
<p>(HANK looks down at his wrist as if noticing it for the first time. He stops trying to intubate the patron.)</p>
<p><strong>Hank Peddigrew</strong>: Larry, take over, will you?</p>
<p><strong>Larry</strong>: I got it, Hank.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(The Fireman gets the car door open with the crowbar.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The car's dry. This must've happened right before the rain.</p>
<p>(The Fireman checks out the old woman driver.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(HANK assists LARRY as he intubates the patron.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What happened?</p>
<p><strong>Hank Peddigrew</strong>: I was sitting at the table. Next thing I knew ...</p>
<p><strong>Fireman</strong>: (b.g.) I got a heartbeat!</p>
<p>(HANK looks up and rushes to give aid. He hurries past SARA and heads for the car.)</p>
<p><strong>Hank Peddigrew</strong>: Excuse me.</p>
<p>(He runs past CATHERINE and GRISSOM. They both watch him as he pushes the Fireman aside to check on the old woman driver.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Some happy hour, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I think happy hour's over.</p>

[INT. CHECKERBOX BAR &amp; GRILLE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(It's dark and still raining outside. The EMT and other Personnel are still processing the scene.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM is on his cell phone looking into the car. CATHERINE takes pictures.)</p>
<p>(LARRY is sitting down in front of HANK, attending to his broken wrist.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (to LARRY) Mind if I take over?</p>
<p><strong>Larry</strong>: No, go ahead.</p>
<p>(LARRY stands up and SARA takes his place. She sits in front of HANK and continues to tape up his wrist.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You okay?</p>
<p><strong>Hank Peddigrew</strong>: Yeah. I didn't think I'd see you tonight. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (smiling) So that's what all this is about.</p>
<p><strong>Hank Peddigrew</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Any time. </p>
<p><strong>Hank Peddigrew</strong>: Listen, I got to head over to the hospital, and I'm sure you got to get back to work.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah, but ... will you call me if you need anything? My cell will be on. Anything.</p>
<p>(SARA and HANK stand. HANK leaves. SARA turns around and walks toward GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You and Catherine are running the evidence on this. Warrick just got done with Internal Affairs. He's on his way. </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You need to talk to the Restaurant Manager, too.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Where are you going?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I got gas.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (nods, but is still confused) Oh.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes a step past SARA, stops, and explains over her shoulder.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Residential gas leak in Henderson.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM leaves. SARA heads for FRED LYCHOCK, The Restaurant Manager who is finishing up with a PARAMEDIC.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Are you the Restaurant Manager?</p>
<p><strong>Fred Lychock (restaurant manager)</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'm Sara Sidle, Crime Lab.</p>
<p>(SARA holds out her hand. FRED LYCHOCK gets to his feet and extends his hand to grab hers, but stops when he sees she's still wearing latex gloves.)</p>
<p><strong>Fred Lychock (restaurant manager)</strong>: Oh, hi. Fred Lychock. Ooh, sorry. Um ... your supervisor asked for a seating chart. (He unrolls the chart for SARA to look at.) Everything's computerized - software program. This here'll show you the number of people per table.</p>
<p>(SARA takes the chart and looks at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Where were you during the crash?</p>
<p><strong>Fred Lychock (restaurant manager)</strong>: I was at the register, behind the bar.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Did you see anything?</p>
<p><strong>Fred Lychock (restaurant manager)</strong>: A blurry jaguar speeding through the intersection.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to the car speeding head-on toward the glass windows. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Fred Lychock (restaurant manager)</strong>: I thought the car would slow down, but it kept right on coming. If you ask me, that's the reason why old people don't belong behind the wheel.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah, I didn't ask you. Thanks for your time.</p>
<p>(SARA walks away from FRED LYCHOCK and heads toward CATHERINE who is examining the car.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I'm sorry. I got wrapped up in ...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hank.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah. (SARA kneels and looks inside the car.) An old jaguar with a GPS unit. That's strange.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, not your granny's oldsmobile.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS RESIDENTIAL AREA -- NIGHT]</p>
<p><strong>Grissom (prelap)</strong>: (V.O.) We're cleared to go in?</p>
<hr />
[EXT./INT. ARNZ RESIDENCE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p><strong>Lockwood</strong>: Yeah. Gas company shut off the valve at the street. Paramedics aired out the scene.</p>
<p>(LOCKWOOD escorts GRISSOM and NICK into the residence to the dead body.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Homicide radioed in a D.B.?</p>
<p><strong>Lockwood</strong>: Vanessa Arnz. She's in the master bedroom next to the son's room.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Thanks. </p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. ARNZ RESIDENCE - HALLWAY/BEDROOM - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and NICK make their way toward the master bedroom where the dead body is located. They walk through the hallway.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The gas company spikes its natural gas with mercaptan - smells like rotten eggs.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I don't smell anything.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: All's I smell is mothballs and stale tobacco.</p>
<p>(NICK looks into the son's room.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Science geek. (He looks back at GRISSOM and smiles.) Takes one to know one, I guess.</p>
<p>(He turns and they both head into the master bedroom.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. ARNZ RESIDENCE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and NICK enter the master bedroom. On the bed is VANESSA ARNZ. DAVID PHILLIPS is already inside with the dead body.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hello, David.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Hey. She's hot pink, like a maraschino.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Makes our job easier.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Death was not the result of natural gas inhalation.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No, but carbon monoxide's still gas.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Right, when carbon monoxide displaces oxygen in the blood, victim asphyxiates, turns ... pink.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: VANESSA ARNZ is sleeping and inhaling gas. Her skin slowly turns pink. End of flashback. Return to present.)</p>
<p>(NICK moves to get a closer look at the dead body.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Was Mr. Arnz in bed with her?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Uh, yeah. Paramedics said they found them both in here.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So why is she dead and he's alive?</p>
<p>(NICK looks up at GRISSOM. DAVID turns and looks at NICK. NICK stands up and explains the answer to DAVID.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You know, Dave, when I was a CSI-1, I would've tried to answer that, but now I know &quot;where&quot; before &quot;why.&quot; First step, find the source of the C.O. I'll grab the nighthawk, fire it up.</p>
<p>(NICK leaves the room. GRISSOM looks down at the body. LOCKWOOD appears in the doorway.)</p>
<p><strong>Lockwood</strong>: Mr. Arnz has been stabilized. They're preparing him for transport.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I want to take a look at him.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. ARNZ RESIDENCE - NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and LOCKWOOD question MR. ARNZ. The paramedics are still checking him out.)</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Arnz</strong>: I wake up in the middle of the night sometimes, if I get cold. Vanessa steals the covers. Uh, I woke up and my head was spinning. I think I'm coming down with something. Then I look over at her ...</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: MR. and MRS. ARNZ is in bed. MR. ARNZ wakes up gasping. He reaches over to check on his wife.)</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Arnz</strong>: Vanessa.</p>
<p>(He realizes that she's not breathing. He reaches for the phone and dials 911.)</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Arnz</strong>: (to the OPERATOR) Tell them my wife isn't breathing.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Lockwood</strong>: Do you remember anything else?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Arnz</strong>: No, I don't remember hanging up the phone. I must've passed out. Next thing I know the paramedics are taking me out.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns and notices the young man leaning against the car in the garage. He presumes this is the son.)</p>
<p><strong>Paramedic</strong>: We got to roll. Patient will be at Desert Palm.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Arnz</strong>: Wait a minute. What about my boy?</p>
<p><strong>Paramedic</strong>: Peter seems fine. The kid's 18. Signed an AMA.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM heads toward PETER ARNZ to talk with him. He ducks under the crime tape and stops in front of PETER ARNZ.)</p>
<p>[INT. ARNZ RESIDENCE - GARAGE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Peter ... my name's Gil Grissom. I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Arnz</strong>: You want to ask me questions. I was in my bedroom, asleep. I heard the doorbell. It was the paramedics. A few minutes later, the police showed up.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm very sorry about what happened to your mother.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Arnz</strong>: Why are you sorry? You're not responsible. You didn't know her. You don't know me.</p>
<p>(Camera holds on GRISSOM.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY/WAITING ROOM -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(SARA walks through the hallway. She passes by a young man sitting outside waiting. She stops in front of the GUARD standing outside the room of the old woman who drove the car.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: How's she doing?</p>
<p><strong>Guard</strong>: Doctors are working on her right now. Doesn't look good.</p>
<p>(Looking inside the room, SARA notices the old woman in the hospital bed and the medical personnel working on her. She turns her head toward the young man sitting outside in the hallway.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Relative?</p>
<p><strong>Guard</strong>: Driver's been I.D.'d as Diane Lambert, that's her grandson Corey.</p>
<p>(SARA walks up to COREY LAMBERT.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hi, Corey? I'm, uh, Sara Sidle. I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab. Mind if I ask you a couple questions?</p>
<p><strong>Corey Lambert</strong>: I don't even know why she was in Las Vegas. We live in Laughlin. She hates it here.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Corey, um... did your grandmother own a Jaguar?</p>
<p><strong>Corey Lambert</strong>: Yeah ... (sniffles) ... yeah, she won it in the, uh, quarter slots. First two coins and bingo. Triple stars.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: She also win the GPS?</p>
<p><strong>Corey Lambert</strong>: No. (beat) She hadn't been driving it much. </p>
<p>(SARA notices HANK in the waiting room kneeling in front of a woman in a wheelchair.)</p>
<p><strong>Corey Lambert</strong>: Uh, she got lost a couple times and it scared her, so for her birthday last month, I bought her the unit.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (smiles) Can you excuse me for a second?</p>
<p><strong>Corey Lambert</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(SARA walks away from the young man and heads toward HANK in the waiting room. The nurse wheels the young woman away.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p>(HANK looks up and sees SARA. He stands up.)</p>
<p><strong>Hank Peddigrew</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: &quot;And the EMT of the year award goes to ...&quot;</p>
<p><strong>Hank Peddigrew</strong>: Not me. Death toll's now three. Could climb to four. Elaine-<br />
- the girl in the wheelchair -- she's one of the lucky ones.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You were amazing.</p>
<p><strong>Hank Peddigrew</strong>: Eight years in the rig, first time I've actually been a part of the scene. I can't stop it going through my head.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah, you never know when your life's going to change.</p>
<p><strong>Hank Peddigrew</strong>: Listen, I ... I got to get out of here.</p>
<p>(HANK moves to pass SARA. She grabs his hands to stop him.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You need a lift?</p>
<p><strong>Hank Peddigrew</strong>: No, I drove.</p>
<p>(HANK turns to leave. SARA stops him.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Hank? (He turns around.) I'm really glad you're okay.</p>
<p><strong>Hank Peddigrew</strong>: (smiles) Thanks.</p>
<p>(HANK turns and walks away. Camera holds on SARA watching HANK leave.)</p>

[EXT. CHECKERBOX BAR &amp; GRILLE - STREET -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(WARRICK and CATHERINE do a walk through of the car route into the restaurant. They examine the street.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Plenty of tire treads, but nothing looks fresh.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So you going to tell me how it went?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I got called in by Internal Affairs. How do you think it went? Too many questions. (To the officer who lifts the crime tape up for them.) Thanks.<br />
(to CATHERINE) I wish I could've pleaded the fifth.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, you don't answer their questions, you're looking at more days off without pay, and that blows.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah. (He looks up and sees something.) It's a red light camera. Did any of the witnesses see the driver run the red light? </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Nobody mentioned it, but the camera's there. Big brother knows.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'll put in a call.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE notices a dark puddle on the curb.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Motor oil. </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Now, that looks fresh.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Camera close up of the curb as the car accelerates, hits it and leaves a puddle of motor oil behind. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hitting the curb could've caused the car to buck.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE turns around to look straight down the street.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: A ghost of the car accelerates straight toward CATHERINE. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Traffic light, intersection, curb. Well, either the car wasn't working, or the driver wasn't. </p>
<p>(WARRICK turns around and heads inside the restaurant. CATHERINE shines her flashlight on the ground and notices a void where something should be.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Looks like the newspaper dispenser used to be here.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The speeding car jumps the curb and takes out the newspaper dispenser before crashing into the window. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(Inside the restaurant, WARRICK notices something on the ground.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Catherine. (He points it out to CATHERINE.) Tire treads. That kills one theory. Car's brakes must've been working.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: She tried to stop, but it was too late.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What about pre-impact? At the risk of feeding a stereotype, she was 72. Any indication of stroke, Alzheimer's, heart attack?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: I considered and dismissed all age-related factors. No arthritis, no significant impairment of her senses. She has had part of her colon removed, probably due to injury or prior medical condition, but Sara, it's irrelevant to your case. I found no physiological explanation for the crash.</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Carbon monoxide fills the air when any carbon-based substance is ignited. The kid checks out, so ... the point of ignition's probably this room.</p>
<p><strong>Lockwood</strong>: Now, the two most common causes of accidental household CO poisonings are: unvented space heaters and improperly maintained chimneys. I don't see any heaters.</p>

<p>(NICK puts his kit down, takes out his flashlight and checks out the fireplace closely.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: This is a natural gas burning fireplace. Burns clean. C.O. fumes should be minimal at best. </p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Foreign substance. Still warm. </p>
<p>(Camera zooms in to show a close up of the black rock.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: There was something other than natural gas burning in here.</p>
<p><strong>Lockwood</strong>: If the gas company hadn't shut off the gas, whatever that is probably would have burned up.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Chimneys are designed to funnel smoke up and out ... if this fire was the source of the CO, the fumes should've traveled up the chimney instead of permeating the room.</p>

<p>(He lifts his head and stands up. They both head up to the morgue units.) </p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Nerve's damaged. (SARA stands up and looks at ROBBINS.) She had glaucoma. I thought you said she was in good health.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: That was before the tox screen came back. You know, it's not standard procedure to check for glaucoma, but the mary jane tipped me off. People think it slows the progression of the disease, but it just reduces the pressure in the eye and that reduction's only temporary. Prescription medications do a much better job.

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Nothing probative.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: What if I told you that Mr. Arnz had a carbon monoxide blood saturation level of 37% -- nearly 10% lower than his wife.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mrs. Arnz was a smoker. Typically, a smoker's blood is already 10% saturated with C.O.</p>

[INT. ARNZ RESIDENCE - HALLWAY/PETER'S ROOM -- DAY]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks through the hallway straight up to PETER ARNZ' room. He kneels and looks at the fishtank in the room. He opens the fishtank cover, rolls up his sleeve and takes out the filter. He looks at the filer. He puts it back inside the tank.)</p>
<p>(PETER ARNZ appears in the hallway and walks up to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You're not supposed to be in here.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Arnz</strong>: It's my home.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, perhaps you didn't see the crime scene tape.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Arnz</strong>: Do I look stupid to you?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: On the contrary. I heard you have an almost perfect 4.0 GPA. With the exception of a &quot;B&quot; in English. Our detectives do complete background searches on all the principles at a crime scene. I understand you threatened your English teacher.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Arnz</strong>: I have to feed my fish.</p>
<p>(PETER steps up to the fishtank.)</p>
<p><strong>Peter Arnz</strong>: Clown loaches, tetras, angelfish.</p>
<p>(PETER opens the fish foot container.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (looking at PETER) You might want to check your filter, too. You're out of charcoal.</p>

[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERROGATION ROOM -- DAY]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and NICK question PETER ARNZ.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: In 1939, Isaac Asimov was an undergraduate studying zoology. As part of a course requirement, the students were asked to find a stray cat, kill it and dissect it. Isaac found his cat, he killed it, and then he promptly dropped out of zoology. Fifty years later, he wrote that the memory of killing that cat still haunted him.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Arnz</strong>: Do you have a question for me?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, I do. Why didn't you fix the chimney damper in your parents' bedroom?</p>
<p><strong>Peter Arnz</strong>: Why would I?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You told your father you fixed it.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Arnz</strong>: So he'd quit bugging me. And if you're accusing me of disobeying a man with only a tenth-grade education, then you're right.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: We know you took advantage of the broken damper. Placed activated charcoal from your fish tank filter in the back of the fireplace...</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: PETER ARNZ dropping the charcoal into the back of the fireplace.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (V.O.) ... then waited for your father to do what he does every night.</p>
<p>(Cut to: MR. ARNZ lighting up the fireplace while VANESSA ARNZ eats her ice cream in bed.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You killed your mother. You almost killed your father.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Arnz</strong>: That's good science fiction.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, you thought the charcoal would burn up, destroying any evidence of the crime, but your father woke up, called 911.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (thoughtfully) Nick, at what point is the saturation level of carbon monoxide in the bloodstream lethal?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Approximately 45, 50%.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (nods) Mmm. Well, his mother's level was in the range, but his father's level was low.</p>
<p>(PETER ARNZ is fascinated by the level of intellectual bantering going on between NICK and GRISSOM in front of him.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, but two people exposed to the same level of carbon monoxide for the same period of time, their C.O. saturation levels should be approximate.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Arnz</strong>: (interjects) As long as the variables are consistent -- body mass, health, age.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What about smoking?</p>
<p><strong>Peter Arnz</strong>: Of course.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Three weeks ago, your father quit.</p>
<p>(PETER ARNZ gives them a blank look. He doesn't respond. GRISSOM picks up on it immediately.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, we didn't know he'd quit, either. The nicotine levels in his system were high but when we went to speak with him, he was wearing a nicotine patch.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: The patch delivers nicotine to the blood, but since your father quit smoking cigarettes, his C.O. saturation level returned to zero. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You made a basic scientific mistake, Peter. You stopped observing the human element because you thought it was inferior.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What I don't understand is why. Man, why would you want to kill your parents? Your high school told us you were accepted to Princeton, early action. A few more months, you would've been 2,000 miles away. Whatever your parents did to piss you off wouldn't have mattered.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM thinks about it.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I know why. They weren't going to let you go, were they?</p>
<p>(He swallows.)</p>
<p><strong>Peter Arnz</strong>: (quietly) They refused to pay for it. I don't qualify for financial aid because my father makes too much money. Not enough money to live well, but enough to destroy my dreams.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So with your parents gone, you could sell the business and pay your tuition. </p>
<p><strong>Peter Arnz</strong>: You figured out the puzzle. Must be very gratifying.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Science isn't about the gratification, Peter. It's about the truth.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p>(SARA sits down and opens the file in front of her.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, how did it go with Elaine Alcott?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: She didn't have anything to add to the investigation.</p>
<p>(BRASS walks into the lab.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hey, how's it going? Here are the phone records from the driver of the vehicle that you asked for. You know, there may be something to that kamikaze grandma theory of yours. Last week, Diane Lambert closed out her bank accounts, paid off her credit cards, and updated her will.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, that's certainly more evidence to suggest that her actions were intentional.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: There's only one Vegas phone number on this statement and the prior statement. There's got to be 80 calls here to the same number.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Dial the number.</p>
<p>(SARA picks up the speaker phone and dials the number. The phone rings.)</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong>: (from phone) Sillmont Healthcare. How can I direct your call?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What's your address? </p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong>: (from phone) 16 South Meadows Lane.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>(The Operator hangs up.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Right. The Checkerbox is at 16 North Meadows.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I don't think that's a coincidence.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: If Sillmont Healthcare was the intended target, how did she end up at the Checkerbox?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, I'll tell you what happened to me. Last week, I was driving to a crime scene in the car and the GPS said go right. Had I done so, I'd be coughing up fish from the bottom of Lake Mead.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, GPS is hardly perfect. Maybe north was a directional default.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Or maybe she put in the wrong address.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Either way ... it does leave one question: Why was Diane Lambert so angry?</p>

<p>(ELAINE takes a seat at the table. She and SARA both eye each other warily.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, did she have some kind of problem with her policy?</p>
<p><strong>Manager</strong>: Not to our knowledge.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Then you won't mind if we take a look at her file.</p>
<p><strong>Manager</strong>: I'm sorry, member files are confidential.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, this member is deceased. Not even the doctor-patient privilege extends postmortem.</p>
<p>(ELAINE picks up the file and hands it to SARA. Again, they eye each other warily. SARA takes the file and looks through it.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Mrs. Lambert had colon cancer.</p>
<p><strong>Manager</strong>: If you read further, you'll see that it was in remission.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No, actually, her most recent cat scan shows recurrence two months ago. That's about the same time she started calling your office two times a day. Why would she be calling you?</p>
<p>(The Manager doesn't answer. CATHERINE looks over at ELAINE ALCOTT who doesn't meet her eyes.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (disgusted) You know what? Four people are dead. Don't waste our time. We can take this downtown.</p>
<p><strong>Elaine Alcott</strong>: Mrs. Lambert's oncologist recommended immediate and aggressive treatment.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Did treatment commence?</p>
<p><strong>Elaine Alcott</strong>: The recommendation was pending. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, what exactly does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>Manager</strong>: Not yet approved, not yet denied.</p>

<p>(SARA and CATHERINE interviews COREY LAMBERT.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Corey, when I was reviewing your grandmother's insurance policy, I noticed she that didn't specify an e-mail address, and that got me thinking. Some people her age aren't technologically savvy. Maybe a GPS device would be intimidating to her. I wondered if she actually even knew how to use it. So I printed the unit and I found your fingerprints on it.</p>
<p><strong>Corey Lambert</strong>: I installed it.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The prints just weren't on the base of the unit, they were on the face. You punched in addresses.</p>
<p>(COREY LAMBERT shakes his head. He's confused by the line of thought. CATHERINE explains.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: If you were aware of your grandmother's intentions and programmed the GPS, you're guilty of aiding and abetting in the murder of three people.</p>
<p>(COREY shakes his head as this sinks in.)</p>
<p><strong>Corey Lambert</strong>: Oh, god. Uh ... last week, she came by my place 'cause she said she didn't know how to work the GPS.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: COREY LAMBERT showing his grandmother how to work the unit. He punches in an address as an example.)</p>

<p><strong>Corey Lambert</strong>: (shakes his head) I had no idea.</p>

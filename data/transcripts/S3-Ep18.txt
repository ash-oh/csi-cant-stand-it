[EXT. -- DAY]</p>
<p>(Camera close up of an old rusty toy truck, a turned over shopping cart and an abandoned toilet.)</p>
<p>(Two racers on their quad-bikes ride in and out of the area, each pacing with the other.)</p>
<p>(BILLIE, the rider in BLUE, on the red bike hits a large metal canister and falls to the ground. The rider in RED on the blue bike stops to render aid.)</p>
<p><strong>Rider In Red</strong>: Billie!</p>
<p>(The RIDER gets off her bike. BILLIE takes off her helmet and looks at the canister.)</p>
<p><strong>Rider In Red</strong>: My God, Billie, are you okay? What did you hit?</p>
<p>(They both look at the canister #3077 with a large yellow sticker on it labeled<br />
&quot;HAZARDOUS WASTE / HANDLE WITH CARE&quot;. Camera cuts to a white sticker labeled: POISON.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. - (RAINY) NIGHT]</p>
<p>(BRASS shows GRISSOM and CATHERINE the body in the canister.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, according to the girl, one minute she's blasting through the mud and having fun, everything's great, the next thing she knows, she's lying upside down in the dirt, staring at chemical waste. She called Hazmat. Now, it's not toxic. They saw the barrel was buckling, they thought it might explode, so they opened it.</p>
<p>(They approach the barrel and immediately smell the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Ugh!</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, whoa-ho.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Soap mummy.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Adipocere, a.k.a. Mortuary wax. This is what you get when fatty tissue decomposes in an alkaline environment with limited oxygen.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: All you need is a little moisture and enough time.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV of: Camera close up of the body in the can slowly decomposing and turning into soap.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (V.O.) Anaerobic bacteria digest body fats, converting them into a waxy solid.</p>
<p>(End of Quick CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Kind of like the way they make vegetable shortening.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'll never eat another french fry. How long you think he's been in there?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How do you know it's a he?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Five, six weeks, minimum.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: With all this wind and weather, any evidence of the dump is long gone.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (nods toward the barrel) We got evidence. (beat) Signed, sealed and delivered.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- DAY]</p>
<p>(The contents of the barrel are turned over onto the table. ROBBINS is explaining the process to two other assistant coroners, one of whom looks like he's getting sick from the smell.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Gentlemen, saponification occurs most frequently in infant burials. That's because their bodies have more fat, and their bacterial flora aren't fully developed. (as the barrel tilts) ... Slowly ...</p>
<p>(The liquid from the barrel spills out onto the table along with the first body part.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Hold it.</p>
<p>(The barrel stops. ROBBINS picks up a ring from the table and looks at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Hmm. Look at this. Something for Catherine.</p>
<p>(ROBBINS puts the ring aside.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: All right. Let's pull the rest of this out. Historically, saponified corpses that maintain their physical features were looked upon as, uh, incorruptible, even saintly.</p>
<p>(The assistant coroner in the room continues to look sick. Camera close up of the liquid soup coming out of the barrel.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: So, when it happened to children, it just reinforced that notion. Hand me that foot there, would you? Okay.</p>
<p>(The assistant coroner finally lifts up his head gear, gags and exits the room. ROBBINS continues to pull out body parts and place them on the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: You know, interestingly enough, since formaldehyde is alkaline and American caskets are sealed, there are more bodies in this country turning to soap now than at any other time in human history. We are, in fact, the adipocere capital of the world. USA -- we're number one.</p>
<p>(ROBBINS lifts up the hand with it's index finger extended.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY/LAB -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and WARRICK make their way through the hallway to the lab.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Are you serious? David lost a body?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It happens. When I was working in Minneapolis, we had two John Smiths come in on the same day. Sent the wrong one back to Canada. Anyway, our body's still in the morgue. David finally processed his ten card. Guy's name is Keith Mercer.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: When did he come in?</p>
<p>(WARRICK spreads out the photos on the table. GRISSOM grabs a pair of gloves and puts them on.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Eleven days ago. Found him in an alley off of Fremont in a pile of garbage next to the dumpster.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Eleven days ago? I guess we've got no more crime scene to process.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Initially, the police thought he was homeless. He hadn't bathed, no wallet, watch or keys, and he has scars on his lower legs.</p>
<p>(WARRICK picks up a photo of the body's head.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: And a nice laceration with ecchymosis on his left temple.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM picks up the evidence from the bag. First, the victim's shirt.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Could have been an accident.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM puts the victim's shoe down.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Could have been a lot of things. </p>
<p>(He reaches into the bag and takes out the victim's belt.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Evidence without context is ambiguous at best.</p>
<p>(He notices something yellow on the belt near the buckle.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(ROBBINS goes over the findings with CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Did you ever chop wood, split a log?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I've seen it done.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: You should try it sometime. I find it relaxing.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (smiles) Mmm.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: The blow here was delivered similar fashion. The temporal bone was hit, driven down hard. Upper palate smashed. Most of the teeth gone.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What about the foot? It looks as though that's been sheared off.</p>
<p>(Camera close up of leg bone cut clean through.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Yeah, by something fast and powerful.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Industrial accident?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: No, industrial accidents are messy. These cuts are too clean. My guess -- single impact.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: How about an axe then?</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV of: Camera close up of an axe hitting into a leg. End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Possible. I'll cast the tool marks. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Body in a drum in the middle of the mountains. Well, if the head and hands were missing, I'd be saying mob hit.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Could be ritual mutilation or fetish murder.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, I.D. from dental records is out. How about DNA? Bone marrow may still be viable.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: My thoughts exactly. </p>
<p>(ROBBINS grabs the bone saw from the side.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: The preferred sample is a large bone with a portion of joint, and we freeze, grind and sequence. Want a breast or thigh?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It's your kitchen.</p>
<p>(The saw whirrs when he turns it on.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - LOUNGE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(NICK and SARA get a cup of something to drink.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, Sara, I don't want to cross any lines here, but, uh, I've got this buddy who's not going out with anybody ...</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No. No, no, forget it.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE appears in the doorway and calls out to them.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, Grissom bailed. You guys are with me.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Good.</p>
<p>(They take their cups and head out of the lounge. NICK continues to try to get SARA to agree with him.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: He's a cool guy.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I mean, you don't ... </p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No, Nick ...</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Listen, just hear me out for a second.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - LAB -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Camera close up of the ring. SARA looks at the ring and does an internet search on it for &quot;FRATERNITY CHAPTER&quot;. She pages down through the different kinds of fraternity rings looking for a match.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - GARAGE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Wearing a mask and sitting on a chair, NICK tackles the barrel the body was discovered in. He swabs the inside. He notices the barrel plate.)</p>
<p>(NICK cuts the barrel plate off of the barrel. He polishes the plate off. He takes a MAGNAFLUX (c) Magnetic Particle Test Equipment out from its box and sets it up.)</p>
<p>(He pours some black powder on the plate completely covering the plate. When the machine is turned on, the black powder embeds itself into the etching revealing the following: 4LRW8464.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (pleased at the results) Gone but not forgotten.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - LAB -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(SARA knocks lightly on the doorframe as she walks into the lab. CATHERINE is inside at the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: DNA hit on the soap mummy?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah. His name was Christian Cutler.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks down at the information sheet in front of her with the following information:</p>
<p>[...182672K DATE:01-05-98 TIME: 11:22:13<br />

--ATION: E-5 ***** ]</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You got to love CODIS. What's his felony?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: He wasn't in CODIS. Department of defense registry. He was in the army. An E-5 sergeant, honorably discharged three years ago. The guy drove tanks.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, that fits. You know that fraternity ring? It's not a fraternity ring. Omega-Zeta-Alpha is a mechanical engineering honor society.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hard-core mechie.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, hey -- want to know where his drum came from?</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(NICK, CATHERINE and BRASS make their way to the warehouse.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: The chemical company serializes all their shipping containers. That way, if hazardous waste ends up where it shouldn't be, they know where it came from.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: This place seems lively for a warehouse.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: A good place for a rave, though.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hello.</p>
<p><strong>Security Guard</strong>: The cover's 25 bucks each.</p>
<p>(BRASS points to his badge.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I got a coupon.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Inside the warehouse, loud techno music plays. There is a huge rink in the middle surrounded by protective glass. Inside the rink are a number of robot machines.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Robot rumble. Demolition derby by remote control. They got a show on cable tv.</p>
<p><strong>Ginger</strong>: (over p.a.) And here comes Spiker Chick. The death blade goes up, and the death blade comes down. Oh! Jabba the Bot is made of titanium, but how much can he take? </p>
<p>(NICK cranes his neck to watch the action inside the rink. Off to the side, the robot creators with their remote controls drive the machines inside the rink.)</p>
<p><strong>Ginger</strong>: (over p.a.) Oh, we got a jam-up, but with this much horsepower, it won't last long. Slaughter's driving yellow belly into the wall, trying to shake him off. Oh! It's mayhem in the middle. ... On his back, taking a pounding. And here comes Spiker Chick with the death blade. Oh, no! We got a Spiker Chick sandwich! Spiker chick is going for Jabba. Oh, again and again! Oh, and in a dazzling array of skill and deception ...</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Metal weapons, money, competition, testosterone.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We got a roomful of murder suspects.</p>
<p><strong>Ginger</strong>: (over p.a.) And the winner is ... Jabba the Bot! Whoo! Whoo-whoo!</p>
<p>(The audience cheers wildly.)</p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<hr />
[INT. WAREHOUSE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Camera follows a small remote-controlled two-wheel robot with blade across the floor. CATHERINE and BRASS question GINGER, the owner of the warehouse.)</p>
<p><strong>Ginger</strong>: Bots fight all over the country, on tv, all over the world. This is an informal venue where competitors can come to hone their skills and their machines.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You have a gaming license?</p>
<p><strong>Ginger</strong>: I don't need one. See, I just put on a show. If people bet, that's their business.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You're the only house in Vegas that doesn't take a cut.</p>
<p><strong>Ginger</strong>: Hey, my daddy ran an independent shipping company he ran it right into the ground. He died broke, but he left me a bunch of empty warehouses. I needed revenue, so I developed a new market. (to JIMBO) Hey, Jimbo, you looked ferocious out there.</p>
<p>(JIMBO looks up from tending to his robot.)</p>
<p><strong>Jimbo</strong>: Thanks, Ginger. We lost.</p>
<p><strong>Ginger</strong>: (smiles) Yeah, but I like a guy who goes down with style.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Look available, be unobtainable.</p>
<p><strong>Ginger</strong>: Keeps them coming back for more. Want to tell me what this is all about?</p>
<p>(BRASS holds out a photograph. GINGER looks at it and recognizes the person.)</p>
<p><strong>Ginger</strong>: That's Chris Cutler.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: He's dead.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: He found his body stuffed in a chemical waste drum from this warehouse.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: When was the last time you saw Christian?</p>
<p><strong>Ginger</strong>: (thinks) God, about six weeks ago. Robot rumble, big free-for-all.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: CHRIS CUTLER yelling with pleasure as he controls his bot and demolishes the other bots such as &quot;Hammer of God&quot; and &quot;Kill&quot;.)</p>
<p><strong>Ginger</strong>: (V.O.) Smash-'N-Burn was on fire that night. Dismantled three or four bots.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Ginger</strong>: He had the kind of fight that most of these boys dream about.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: CHRIS CUTLER yelling and taking pleasure as he controls his bot. The other bots' owners don't look as thrilled as CHRIS CUTLER.)</p>
<p><strong>Ginger</strong>: (V.O.) Using the thing that he built to destroy the thing that the other guy built.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Ginger</strong>: It's a basic male drive.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to BRASS) That kind of puts that whole weapons of mass destruction thing into perspective. (to GINGER) I take it this Chris was not well liked.</p>
<p><strong>Ginger</strong>: Let me put it to you this way, nobody likes a winner who needs to shove it in your face.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We're going to need you to identify the guys fought with that night.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: As well as their bots. We can't have a murder without a murder weapon.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'll take them all.</p>

[INT. CSI -- DAY]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and VEGA interview MRS. MERCER, KEITH MERCER'S wife. They show her the photograph of the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Mercer</strong>: Keith went to Yosemite to climb El Capitan. The shield headwall.</p>
<p><strong>Vega</strong>: Did you go with him?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Mercer</strong>: I drove to Taos to see my sister.</p>
<p><strong>Vega</strong>: And got back when?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Mercer</strong>: Ten days ago. Keith's gear was in the living room, but he wasn't there.</p>
<p><strong>Vega</strong>: What did you do then?</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Mercer</strong>: I called his cell phone. I called his office. And then I called the park service and all they said was that Keith had been by to pick up his permit. So then I checked the hospitals up there and nothing. Then I called the hospitals in Vegas. And then I called the police. I did everything I could do and nobody would pay attention.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Mrs. Mercer ... you have my attention. And I'd like to see your house.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>

[INT. MERCER RESIDENCE -- DAY]</p>
<p>(WARRICK pulls out the climbing rope from the bag on the living room floor.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Looks like his gear's all here. I don't see a sleeping bag, though.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM studies the wood floor.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It looks like someone was trying to clean up, too, but forgot to use their Murphy's oil soap. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM stands up.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Luminol.</p>
<p>(WARRICK reaches in to his kit and takes out the spray bottle of luminol. GRISSOM closes the window blinds. The floor glows.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You called it. Positive for blood.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks around at the framed photographs on the fireplace mantle and on the wall of the MERCER'S.)</p>
<p>(WARRICK continues to spray luminol on the floor in the surrounding area and finds a shoe print.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Someone walks through the blood and leaves behind shoeprints of blood. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Got a trail of bloody footprints.</p>

<p>(GINGER pulls out a photograph of a man. She shows it to CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Does it have a name or did it come with the wallet?</p>
<p><strong>Ginger</strong>: Pretty funny for a scientist. </p>
<p>(GINGER takes the picture from CATHERINE.) </p>
<p><strong>Ginger</strong>: Let me make it easy for you. And in case you can't spell, that &quot;E-S-Q&quot; means he and his entire law firm are going to be all over your ass. </p>
<p>(GINGER stands up.)</p>
<p><strong>Ginger</strong>: Next time you want to talk to me, talk to him.</p>

[INT. CSI -- LAB]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM is in the lab looking through KEITH MERCER'S wallet. He pulls out a wedding picture of KEITH and his WIFE. Through the glass, we see DET. VEGA walking toward the room. He knocks lightly on the door before walking inside.)</p>
<p><strong>Vega</strong>: Hey, I was able to pull the cell phone records for our vic.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM pulls out a NEVADA DEPARTMENT OF FORESTRY / HIKING AND TRAIL PERMIT for:</p>

<p><strong>Vega</strong>: Most of the calls went to the office, two went to the wife. But there are two who are interesting. Jones Collectibles. </p>
<p>(VEGA hands GRISSOM the sheet of cell phone calls from &quot;ALL-WORLD PHONE ... /<br />
L.V.P.D. REQUEST&quot;. The highlighted number reads: NV 555-0167 / Jones Collectibles / 1:00 (Minutes) / for .12 (Amount).)</p>
<p><strong>Vega</strong>: Guy is a small-time fence. That mean anything to you?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM picks up a small slip of torn notebook paper from KEITH MERCER'S wallet. On it is written: JC (702) 555-0167. He compares it to the phone listing. It's a match.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Does now.</p>

[INT. JONES COLLECTIBLES -- DAY]</p>
<p>(GREG walks up to JONES COLLECTIBLES and enters the shop.)</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Jones</strong>: Anything I can help you with, let me know.</p>
<p>(GREG looks around.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I heard that you dealt in coins.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Jones</strong>: Really? From whom?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Grissom. </p>
<p>(MR. JONES has a confused look on his face. The name doesn't ring a bell for him.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: He's a friend of mine. We work together. Uh, looking to see what you got. I'd like to make a trade.</p>
<p>(GREG holds out his Lincoln penny. MR. JONES takes it and looks at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Jones</strong>: Why the flip?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I've been meaning to get it slabbed.</p>
<p>(Sirens blare outside. MR. JONES takes an eye piece and examines the penny. GREG waits patiently.)</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Jones</strong>: Not bad. No hairlines. No fly specks. You got yourself a slider.</p>
<p>(He hands the penny back to GREG.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I'd like to get myself a 1916 &quot;d&quot; dime. Been all over Vegas, can't find one. You got any?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Jones</strong>: I might have one, but it's pricey.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Hey, so is mine. </p>
<p>(MR. JONES looks at GREG and considers him for a long moment. He turns away and reaches down into the drawer where he takes out a case. Inside the case are coins. GREG leans in and looks at the coins. He's impressed.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: 1907 Saint Goddins double eagle gold piece. I've only seen that in books.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Jones</strong>: And that's as close as you get. If you want to deal for the &quot;D&quot; dime, it's yours.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I'll take it.</p>

[INT. WAREHOUSE WORKSHOP]</p>
<p>(Camera close up of LUKE and his machine, HAMMER OF GOD. CATHERINE and NICK are back at the warehouse workshop.)</p>
<p>(NICK grabs one of the photographs.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: The bot was on a different control frequency, which means someone was using a different transmitter.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Puppet master. Somebody else was pulling the strings.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: That would explain why the bot was sluggish.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: CHRIS showing BRIAN what's wrong with Smash-n-Burn. The machine whirls, but it's not smooth.)</p>
<p><strong>Christian Cutler</strong>: See, she sticks, Brian.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Kelso</strong>: Maybe there's something jammed.</p>
<p>(BRIAN kneels down and picks up the machine. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks around.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, what's the range of those controllers anyway?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: It's limited. Definitely not outside this building.</p>
<p>(NICK reaches across the workstation and pulls down another photograph of LUKE and his machine, HAMMER OF GOD.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, if somebody hijacked Brian's bot they'd have to be nearby, but ... obviously, out of sight.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks up at the door at the top of the stairs. It's near and it's dark inside.)</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: Someone sitting inside the door at the top of the stairs with a remote in his hands. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, there's a good place to hide up there. Opportunity.</p>
<p>(NICK pulls down a photograph and shows it to CATHERINE. It's a photograph of LUKE and the busted HAMMER OF GOD.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Maybe we've got motive.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Ooh, proud papa. The man who built Hammer of God.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Which leaves us with ... means. (NICK looks around.) Transmitter modules. </p>
<p>(NICK reaches up on the shelf of LUKE'S workstation and takes down a plastic storage container with transmitter modules in it. The slots are labeled.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, check out the 80s. 81, 82, 83 ... 85, 86?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And look what's missing: 84.</p>

<p><strong>Mr. Jones</strong>: (to GRISSOM) Guy came in a couple of weeks ago with this collection looking to sell. I bought it.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: There must be $50,000 worth of coins in there, isn't there, Greg?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM shows the coin case to GREG. MR. JONES looks at GREG and recognizes him. GREG looks at the coins.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: At least.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You must have a record of the transaction.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Jones</strong>: I know I got it somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Maybe it's in your car.</p>
<p><strong>Vega</strong>: Mind if we help you look?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Jones</strong>: No, go ahead. I got nothing to hide.</p>

[EXT. JONES COLLECTIBLES - PARKING LOT - DAY -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(VEGA opens the back of MR. JONES' car. GRISSOM looks inside. GREG stands behind and looks into the back of the car.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Ten-inch subs. 400 watts. Four channels? That's state-of-the-art. Those hot, too? It kind of looks like the de Lorean from back to the future.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM finds some powdery substance. He sniffs it.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Trace amounts of sulfur. You don't artificially tone your coins, do you, Mr. Jones?</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Jones</strong>: Hey, my merchandise is authentic.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM finds some blood inside the car.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, you may have some authentic blood in your car as well.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: MR. JONES opens the back of the car and puts KEITH MERCER'S body inside. It scrapes against the back seat and leaves behind blood evidence. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Jones</strong>: Yeah, well, I cut my finger the other day.</p>

<p><strong>Luke</strong>: I lost.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You didn't lose. You were destroyed.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: LUKE at his remote. CHRIS CUTLER laughing at his remote. And HAMMER OF GOD in pieces inside the rink. Despite already defeating HAMMER OF GOD, CHRIS CULTER continues to have SMASH-N-BURN pulverize the broken bot.)</p>
<p><strong>Chris Cutler</strong>: (laughing and taunting) Ooh! You got nothing left, Luke!</p>
<p>(CHRIS CUTLER continues to send his machine into what's left of HAMMER OF GOD. He continues to laugh and taunt LUKE. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: And you wanted revenge.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You couldn't kill Christian's bot so you killed Christian.</p>
<p><strong>Luke</strong>: I heard Brian killed him.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: This is the transmitter from Christian's robot.</p>
<p>(NICK holds up the transmitter in a bag.)</p>
<p><strong>Luke</strong>: So?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So ... it's got your DNA on it.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: LUKE tampers with the remote. He opens it and temporarily puts the transmitter #89 in between his lips while he fiddles with the remote's insides. He puts the transmitter into the remote. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>

<p>(LUKE makes the machine move. It cuts right in to CHRIS, knocking him to the floor in pain.)</p>
<p><strong>Brian Kelso</strong>: Oh, my god! I can't turn it off!</p>
<p>(BRIAN jumps out of the way while desperately trying to control the bot. LUKE makes the bot turn and head back straight for CHRIS. The machine whirrs as CHRIS screams, sending blood into the grates.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The bot wasn't the only thing you manipulated, Luke.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: LUKE appears to walk into the warehouse from the door at the top of the stairs. He acts surprised when he sees BRIAN and CHRIS.)</p>
<p><strong>Brian Kelso</strong>: Chris! Chris!</p>
<p><strong>Luke</strong>: Oh, my god. What did you do?!</p>
<p><strong>Brian Kelso</strong>: It was an accident. The bot just ... oh, my god! Oh, we've got to call the cops!</p>
<p><strong>Luke</strong>: If you do that, they're going to think you did this.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Kelso</strong>: I didn't do it.</p>
<p><strong>Luke</strong>: They're going to put you in prison for life. I'll keep this quiet, but you have to get rid of this body.</p>
<p>(BRIAN and LUKE pick up the body and put it in the barrel.)</p>

<p><strong>Luke</strong>: Let me guess. You have a kid?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yes, I have a daughter.</p>
<p><strong>Luke</strong>: And you think that just because you squeeze a baby out from between your legs, you know how I feel? That's biology. Any animal can do that.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Uh-huh.</p>
<p><strong>Luke</strong>: But I took a thought from my head and I made it real. It was ... perfect.</p>
<p>(Standing behind LUKE, NICK shakes his head at the logic.)</p>

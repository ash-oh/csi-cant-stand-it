<p>(There is a beautiful woman sitting in the back of the cab. The driver looks in the rear view mirror at the woman. He turns the radio off.)</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: The last time I was out here, this was all desert.</p>
<p>(She looks out the window and sees at the approaching gas station, a group of men with their bikes.)</p>
<p><strong>Rajeeb Khandelwahl (driver)</strong>: One day, I'm looking at cactus; the next day a mini mall. What brings you all the way out here?</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: Work. </p>
<p>(She sees a young boy stagger out onto the street.)</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: Stop!</p>
<p>(The taxi cab driver tries to stop, but runs into the boy. The tires squeal. The men at the gas station look up.)</p>
<p><strong>Rajeeb Khandelwahl (driver)</strong>: Miss, you okay? Stay here.</p>
<p>(RAJEEB KHANDELWAHL gets out of his cab to see what happened. The young boy is under his tires, his insides spilled out into the road. The men at the gas station watch as RAJEEB KHANDELWAHL gets back into his cab.)</p>
<p><strong>Graham Cooper</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p>(The group of bike riders rush over to the cab, open the driver's door and pull the driver out. The woman in the back seat is stunned by what she's seeing.)</p>
<p>(The men continue to shout as they beat the driver up.)</p>
<p><strong>Bike Rider</strong>: Where do you think you're going? <strong>Bike Rider</strong>: Get out of there!</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hmm?</p>
<p>(DAVID PHILLIPS is kneeling next to the body with a clipboard.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: My god, what am I looking at?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Taxi hit a kid crossing the boulevard. The crowd over there saw the driver Rajeeb Khandelwahl, trying to get away. So, they pull him out of the front seat of the cab and they beat him up. I mean, they ... they beat him up bad. He's on his way to Desert Palm.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: His insides are on the outside. Did you move this body, David?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: No, sir. </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Auto detail hoisted the cab off the kid.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Yeah, but supervised. No one's touched him.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Have you ever seen anything like this?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What do you mean?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, how many hit-and-runs have you pulled?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Too many to count.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: How many times have you seen the victim's viscera exposed?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (thinks about it) First time.</p>

<p>(DAVID PHILLIPS kneels over the body. GRISSOM sits on his kit and takes picture of the little boy. BRASS walks over to them.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: My high school science teacher used to say that your small and large intestines could stretch across the Brooklyn Bridge. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: But in reality? </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Only 25 feet combined.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Fiction is often more compelling.BRASS: We got the eyewitnesses lined up, ready to go.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Testimonials, Jim? I don't consider that evidence.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: But easier to clean up.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM hands DAVID a bag. He stands up and joins BRASS. They make their way to the WOMAN who was riding in the taxi cab.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Keep them all together, David.</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: I'll tuck the viscera in the bio-hazard bag.</p>

<p>(GRISSOM and BRASS question the WOMAN.)</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: I picked up the taxi at McCarran. I'm in town on business staying with my cousin who's a few blocks away.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Did you see the pedestrian?WOMAN: Crossing the street. I don't think he saw the cab.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Did the cabbie see him?</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: No, he was looking at me.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: RAJEEB KHANDELWAHL looking in the rear view mirror at the WOMAN in the back seat.)</p>
<p><strong>Rajeeb Khandelwahl (driver)</strong>: What brings you all the way out here?</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: I think I yelled, &quot;stop,&quot; but it was too late.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: And that's when Rajeeb, the taxi driver tried to leave, to drive away?</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: No, no, no, no. He got out of the cab to see what happened and ... then he freaked and he got back in and he reached for his radio. That's when the guys attacked him.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: His radio? He wasn't fleeing the scene?</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: No, he was calling for help.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks into the front seat of the cab and sees the handheld radio out on the passenger seat.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh. Okay, what can you tell me about the men who attacked him?</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: You always think you'll be a great witness but ...</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The group of men converging on the taxi cab. All yelling and shouting. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>

<p>(BRASS questions the MOB MEMBERS at the gas station near the accident site.)</p>
<p><strong>Joey Gillman</strong>: We're heroes, man.</p>
<p><strong>Barry Lawrence</strong>: They have no respect for our laws.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Who?</p>
<p><strong>Graham Cooper</strong>: The damn cabbie!</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Why, because he's not from Vegas?</p>
<p><strong>Claude Allen</strong>: No, because he's not from here, this country.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh, and you know that because you saw his birth certificate?</p>
<p><strong>Graham Cooper</strong>: We didn't exactly need to see it.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Tell me what you did see.</p>
<p><strong>Graham Cooper</strong>: He hit the boy. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The taxi cab hitting the boy. The boy hits the taxi cab hood, then falls off in front of the cab and onto the road. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Joey Gillman</strong>: Then he hits his brakes, and I figured he's going to stop and do the right thing. </p>
<p><strong>Claude Allen</strong>: Instead, he jumps back into his cab.</p>
<p><strong>Barry Lawrence</strong>: Hey! If it weren't for us, he'd have gotten away.</p>
<p><strong>Graham Cooper</strong>: Citizen's arrest, yo!</p>
<p><strong>Bill Kendal</strong>: People are going to want our autograph.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I don't want your autograph, but I would like a photo and a bit of your DNA.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So line up.</p>
<p><strong>Bike Rider (unknown)</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Look, the guy that you &quot;arrested&quot; is in critical condition. That makes you all suspects in a battery ...</p>
<p><strong>Graham Cooper</strong>: Figures. We do something good, you guys try to turn around and pin it on us.</p>
<p><strong>Joey Gillman</strong>: Yeah, if we were wearing badges you'd be throwing us a ticker tape parade.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: If you're wearing badges, I'm playing left-wing in the NHL.</p>
<p><strong>Claude Allen</strong>: I know my rights. I don't have to give you squat.BRASS: Oh yeah, you're the lawyer. Let me tell you how this goes down if you don't cooperate. You all get a free ride in the cruiser down to the station where I hold you there until the warrants clear. So what's it going to be? It's your choice. Line up ... single file.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM steps up and looks at CLAUDE ALLEN.)</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Point of reference.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Uh ... Match Game ... Nipsey Russell, Fannie Flagg game show network. Look, I don't have time for your humor. Ecklie's got a multiple, Warrick tells me his home invasion is my top priority and I'm still backed up on Catherine's no-suspect rape. One servant, many masters. You know what I'm saying?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Greg, this is your DNA lab. You are the master. We serve you.</p>

<p>(GRISSOM walks into the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Okay, Doc, tell me something I don't know.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Okay. In fourth grade, I dropped out of karate class because a kid half my size made me cry.</p>
<p>(ROBBINS smiles.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: About the body.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: No pedestrian fracture. Almost without exception, when a pedestrian's hit by a car, there's certain expected wounds in his lower extremities most significantly the pedestrian fracture.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV to: The side view of a car hitting a person and the x-ray view of the impact where the bone breaks. End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Tip of the triangle always points in the direction the car was moving. His tibia's intact.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV to: The camera moves down to the body's leg, through the skin, down to the bone and across the length of the bone to show that it's in tact.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: (V.O.) In fact, there's no bruising to the lower extremities. </p>
<p>(End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So, no fractures, no bruising. Cause of death?</p>
<p>(Quick camera close up of the boy's chest to show bruising.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Chest was crushed. Multiple rib fractures and hence the white bucket you and David filled with his intestines. They literally popped out.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So he wasn't hit by the taxi; he was run over?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The taxi cab literally runs over the boy. The body goes under the car's wheels. The taxi's tires screech. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Well, he would've died anyway. (He pulls the sheet aside to show an abdomen wound.) He was stabbed. Clean incised wound to the abdomen. Five inches deep.</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV to: ROBBINS mimics plunging a knife into the wound. The camera shows a black gloved hand plunging a knife into the skin. End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So how much time elapsed between when he was stabbed and when he encountered the taxi?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: I can't give you an exact time frame except to say it wasn't immediate ... and before you ask, we don't have an ID, but missing persons called. A woman called and said her son didn't come home last night. She's on her way in.</p>

<p>(At the cordoned off crime scene, a Yukon drives up. SARA gets out of the car.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You know you pulled me away from a forensic anthropology seminar, right? It's required. It's part of the continuing education program.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, I'm sorry, but everyone seems to have something to do today. I have a teenager who was run over by a taxi. He wasn't hit by it; that's not what killed him. He was stabbed, fatally. For now, I have no ID, no suspects and no primary crime scene. I need you.</p>

<p>(BRASS and GRISSOM question ERIC. The Child Advocate, MS. KARPELL as well as JAN BRANSON is also there.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Eric ... I need to know how you burned your hand. </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Look at Mr. Grissom, Eric. Not your mother, okay? Ms. Karpell.</p>
<p><strong>Ms. Karpell</strong>: Eric, it's okay to answer the question.</p>
<p><strong>Eric Branson</strong>: I burned it on an iron.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I think something a lot more dangerous than that burned your hand.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes out a photograph from the file in front of him. He shows it to ERIC.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We recovered a gun ... in the park. Your burn indicates that your hand was over this gap when the gun was fired.</p>
<p>(SARA enters the room.)</p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV of: The revolver being fired and a hand covering the barrel of the gun. A person gasps in pain. End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Eric Branson</strong>: (swallows) I followed Todd to the park.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: TODD BRANSON meeting with STEWART BRADLEY in the park.)</p>
<p><strong>Stewart Bradley</strong>: Todd, I got your e-mail. What's up?</p>
<p><strong>Todd Branson</strong>: We're not moving again. I want you to tell mom you're passing on that promotion.</p>
<p><strong>Stewart Bradley</strong>: You should discuss this with your mother. </p>
<p><strong>Todd Branson</strong>: She'll do whatever you say.</p>
<p><strong>Stewart Bradley</strong>: You don't understand.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Branson</strong>: I am not leaving my friends 'cause of you!</p>
<p><strong>Stewart Bradley</strong>: Todd, this has nothing to do with me.</p>
<p>(TODD pulls out a gun and points it at STEWART BRADLEY. ERIC runs out and pushes the gun away. His hand covers the gun when it fires.)</p>
<p><strong>Eric Branson</strong>: Todd, no!</p>
<p>(The gun fires and hits STEWART BRADLEY in the knee. STEWART goes down on one knee and takes out his knife. He stabs TODD in the abdomen and the gun fires a second time.)</p>
<p>(STEWART BRADLEY falls to the ground dead. TODD gets up to his feet, clutching his injury.)</p>
<p><strong>Todd Branson</strong>: Gotta get home.</p>
<p>(He drops the gun and turns to leave.)</p>
<p><strong>Todd Branson</strong>: You gotta hide the body.</p>
<p>(ERIC looks down at the body and starts to drag the body into the bushes.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Eric Branson</strong>: I was just looking out for my brother.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I swabbed the pistol grip of the revolver. The DNA from the suspect's perspiration isn't a match to Todd's. But it is male. With eight markers in common and familial relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We found gunshot residue on Todd's jacket. We assumed that Todd fired the gun. But I think maybe he was standing next to you when you fired the gun. You didn't go to the park to stop Todd, did you? He went to the park to stop you.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: STEWART BRADLEY walks up to ERIC in the park.)</p>
<p><strong>Stewart Bradley</strong>: Eric, what's up?</p>
<p>(ERIC takes out the gun and points it at STEWART. TODD shows up and tries to stop ERIC.)</p>
<p><strong>Todd Branson</strong>: Whoa! Eric, Eric! Eric, don't be stupid.</p>
<p><strong>Eric Branson</strong>: I'm not moving again! Not 'cause of him!</p>
<p>(TODD tries to take the gun away from ERIC.)</p>
<p><strong>Eric Branson</strong>: Todd! Let go!</p>
<p>(The gun fires and hits STEWART BRADLEY in the knee. STEWART takes out a knife and stabs TODD.)</p>
<p>(ERIC points the gun at STEWART and fires a second time. This time, he burns his hand.)</p>
<p><strong>Eric Branson</strong>: Go home!<br />
(End of flashback. Return to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Where'd you get the revolver, Eric?</p>
<p><strong>Jan Branson</strong>: From me.</p>
<p>(ERIC looks at his mom.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Ms. Karpell ...</p>
<p><strong>Ms. Karpell</strong>: Eric, why don't we step out in the hall for a few minutes.</p>
<p>(MS. KARPELL and ERIC leave the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, the gun was in your possession and you didn't say anything.</p>
<p><strong>Jan Branson</strong>: I, um ... I hid it in a lock box. And, uh, when I got that call from John a couple of days ago I took it out and I put in my nightstand. I didn't even know it was missing until this morning. And then, I thought that John must've gotten in the house and taken it. I was so sure that he was the one who killed Stewart. I've spent the last ten years looking over my shoulder every day.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Your boyfriend was found carrying a knife the night he died. I spoke to some of his friends and associates, and no one ever remembers him carrying a knife.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Ms. Branson? You warned your boyfriend about your ex-husband, didn't you?</p>
<p><strong>Jan Branson</strong>: He asked me what was wrong and I shouldn't have said anything. He panicked. He overreacted. He started carrying a knife. What's going to happen to Eric?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: He'll be remanded to a juvenile detention center, awaiting trial.</p>
<p><strong>Jan Branson</strong>: And then?</p>
<p>(In the hallway, ERIC is being escorted away by an OFFICER and MS. KARPELL.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (V.O.) If he's convicted of a homicide he'll be sent to a state custodial facility until he's 21.</p>
<p>(Camera holds on JAN BRANSON. She puts her head down in her hands in the empty interview room.)</p>

[INT. CSI - DNA LAB -- DAY]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks into the DNA lab where GREG waits.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Where we at, Greg?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I paged you, like, ten times.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I was busy.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, so was I. First, I processed Mr. Khandelwahl's clothing. Then I compared the DNA I lifted from said clothing to the DNA from the dirty dozen.</p>
<p>(GREG indicates the board covered with a sheet.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: All I see is a sheet.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: But what I do is art. And now, I'm ready to unveil it. Welcome to the new and improved match game.</p>
<p>(GREG removes the sheet to show GRISSOM a board with the photos of the mob members and RAJEEB'S clothes. GREG matched the DNA found on the clothes to the mob members they match.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Now, Graham Cooper grabbed Rajeeb's collar...</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: RAJEEB is sitting in the cab when GRAHAM COOPER grabs him by the collar and drags him out of the cab. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Claude Allen and Barry Lawrence used their fists ...</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The men punching RAJEEB out on the street outside the taxi. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Joey Gillman, Bill Kendal and Rick Midgen got into it, too.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Very nice presentation, Greg. What about the others? They all participated. They even bragged about it.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, only six of the twelve left behind their epithelials when their skin made contact with the vic's clothing. I've got no physical evidence to tie the others to the crime.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at the board and shakes his head.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<hr />
[EXT. GAS STATION -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM stands alone at the gas station and looks over at the corner where everything happened.)</p>
<p>(In a haze, he visualizes as TODD BRANSON stumbles across the sidewalk, clutching his injury.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns his head and visualizes the taxi cab as it travels down the road.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns around and visualizes the gang of bike riders gathered and talking.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns back to the corner and visualizes as TODD BRANSON stumbles and falls into the roadway.)</p>
<p><strong>Woman</strong>: Stop!<br />
(The taxi cab's tires screech as it runs over the boy.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns around and visualizes the gang of bike riders lift their heads when they hear the accident.)</p>
<p>(RAJEEB stops the car and gets out to look at the damage.)</p>
<p>(The BIKE RIDERS perk up and take note of RAJEEB'S behavior. They watch as he rushes back into the cab and close the door. Thinking that he's fleeing, they rush to stop him.)</p>
<p><strong>Graham Cooper</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns and visualizes the mob as they drag RAJEEB out of the cab and proceed to beat him up there on the street.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - BRASS' OFFICE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The mob mentality ... relieves individuals from having to distinguish between right and wrong. </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Anonymity shields them from prosecution, though.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, six of them, to be exact. </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hmmm ...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Unfortunately, physical evidence is limited by human action.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, nothing's absolute, Gil ... even forensics.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, well ... this is as far as we can take it. It's up to you guys.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(BRASS questions GRAHAM COOPER with his LAWYER next to him. On the table are pictures of the twelve people who were there the night of the beating.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The physical evidence confirms that you're the &quot;hero&quot; who pulled the driver out of the cab.</p>
<p><strong>Graham Cooper</strong>: I'd do it again, too.</p>
<p><strong>Cooper's Lawyer</strong>: Mr. Cooper, why don't we just hear what Captain Brass has to say. </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You're looking at first degree murder.</p>
<p><strong>Graham Cooper</strong>: What?!</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Mr. Khandelwhal didn't make it.</p>
<p>(BRASS sighs. GRAHAM COOPER is stunned silent.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: ... and, for the record, he didn't hit that boy. He wasn't trying to flee the scene. He was reaching for his radio trying to call for help. You know who the real hero of this is? Rajeeb Khandelwhal. The taxi driver. So ... what does that make you?</p>
<p><strong>Cooper's Lawyer</strong>: D.A. willing to deal?</p>
<p>(BRASS sighs heavily and takes a seat.)</p>
<p>[OBSERVATION ROOM]</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (over speaker): We want your buddies. I mean, either you talk or they'll talk. I mean, it doesn't matter. And the clock is ticking, so ...</p>
<p>(GRISSOM watches and nods his head.)</p>
<p><strong>Lyric</strong>: everything ... everything in its right place... </p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>

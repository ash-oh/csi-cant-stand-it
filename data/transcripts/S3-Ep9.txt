Rajeeb Khandelwahl : One day, I'm looking at cactus; the next day a mini mall. What brings you all the way out here?
Woman: Work. 

Woman: Stop!

Rajeeb Khandelwahl : Miss, you okay? Stay here.

Graham Cooper: Hey!


Bike Rider: Where do you think you're going? Bike Rider: Get out of there!





Brass: Where's your posse?
Grissom: I have no idea. I was actually on a date.
Brass: Hmm?

Grissom: My god, what am I looking at?
Brass: Taxi hit a kid crossing the boulevard. The crowd over there saw the driver Rajeeb Khandelwahl, trying to get away. So, they pull him out of the front seat of the cab and they beat him up. I mean, they ... they beat him up bad. He's on his way to Desert Palm.
Grissom: His insides are on the outside. Did you move this body, David?
David Phillips: No, sir. 
Brass: Auto detail hoisted the cab off the kid.
David Phillips: Yeah, but supervised. No one's touched him.
Grissom: Have you ever seen anything like this?
Brass: What do you mean?
Grissom: Well, how many hit-and-runs have you pulled?
Brass: Too many to count.
Grissom: How many times have you seen the victim's viscera exposed?
Brass:  First time.
Grissom: There's a first time for everything.








David Phillips: My high school science teacher used to say that your small and large intestines could stretch across the Brooklyn Bridge. 
Grissom: But in reality? 
David Phillips: Only 25 feet combined.
Grissom: Fiction is often more compelling.BRASS: We got the eyewitnesses lined up, ready to go.
Grissom: Testimonials, Jim? I don't consider that evidence.
Brass: But easier to clean up.

Grissom: Keep them all together, David.
David Phillips: I'll tuck the viscera in the bio-hazard bag.
Brass: Good plan.





Woman: I picked up the taxi at McCarran. I'm in town on business staying with my cousin who's a few blocks away.
Brass: Did you see the pedestrian?WOMAN: Crossing the street. I don't think he saw the cab.
Brass: Did the cabbie see him?
Woman: No, he was looking at me.

Rajeeb Khandelwahl : What brings you all the way out here?

Woman: I think I yelled, &quot;stop,&quot; but it was too late.
Brass: And that's when Rajeeb, the taxi driver tried to leave, to drive away?
Woman: No, no, no, no. He got out of the cab to see what happened and ... then he freaked and he got back in and he reached for his radio. That's when the guys attacked him.
Brass: His radio? He wasn't fleeing the scene?
Woman: No, he was calling for help.

Brass: Oh. Okay, what can you tell me about the men who attacked him?
Woman: You always think you'll be a great witness but ...

Woman: There were so many of them and it happened so fast.

Woman: He was just begging for his life. 
 
Woman: I couldn't see their faces but I know it was them; all of them. They were the only ones around.




Joey Gillman: We're heroes, man.
Barry Lawrence: They have no respect for our laws.
Brass: Who?
Graham Cooper: The damn cabbie!
Brass: Why, because he's not from Vegas?
Claude Allen: No, because he's not from here, this country.
Brass: Oh, and you know that because you saw his birth certificate?
Graham Cooper: We didn't exactly need to see it.
Brass: Tell me what you did see.
Graham Cooper: He hit the boy. 

Joey Gillman: Then he hits his brakes, and I figured he's going to stop and do the right thing. 
Claude Allen: Instead, he jumps back into his cab.
Barry Lawrence: Hey! If it weren't for us, he'd have gotten away.
Graham Cooper: Citizen's arrest, yo!
Bill Kendal: People are going to want our autograph.
Grissom: I don't want your autograph, but I would like a photo and a bit of your DNA.
Brass: So line up.
Bike Rider : What?!
Brass: Look, the guy that you &quot;arrested&quot; is in critical condition. That makes you all suspects in a battery ...
Graham Cooper: Figures. We do something good, you guys try to turn around and pin it on us.
Joey Gillman: Yeah, if we were wearing badges you'd be throwing us a ticker tape parade.
Brass: If you're wearing badges, I'm playing left-wing in the NHL.
Claude Allen: I know my rights. I don't have to give you squat.BRASS: Oh yeah, you're the lawyer. Let me tell you how this goes down if you don't cooperate. You all get a free ride in the cruiser down to the station where I hold you there until the warrants clear. So what's it going to be? It's your choice. Line up ... single file.

Grissom: Say, &quot;cheese.&quot;

Grissom: Open up, please. Thank you.





Nurse: He's critical. Ruptured spleen, collapsed lung, fractured ulna, possible intercranial bleeding. Doctors are still waiting on the labs.
Grissom: Do you have his clothes?
Nurse: His personals are bagged -- top shelf. They're ripped up pretty bad.
Grissom: That's good. That'll help.
Nurse: He said he killed a boy -- ran over him?
Grissom: Did he say anything else?
Nurse: No, that was it.




Grissom: Gene Rayburn.
Greg: What?
Grissom: Point of reference.
Greg: Uh ... Match Game ... Nipsey Russell, Fannie Flagg game show network. Look, I don't have time for your humor. Ecklie's got a multiple, Warrick tells me his home invasion is my top priority and I'm still backed up on Catherine's no-suspect rape. One servant, many masters. You know what I'm saying?
Grissom: Greg, this is your DNA lab. You are the master. We serve you.
Greg: Well, your stuff just moved to the top of the pile.

Greg: What do you got?
Grissom: Individual DNA from a mob attack on a cabbie ... and the cabbie's clothes.

Greg: &quot;Get ready to match the stars.&quot;




Grissom: Okay, Doc, tell me something I don't know.
Robbins: Okay. In fourth grade, I dropped out of karate class because a kid half my size made me cry.

Grissom: About the body.
Robbins: No pedestrian fracture. Almost without exception, when a pedestrian's hit by a car, there's certain expected wounds in his lower extremities most significantly the pedestrian fracture.

Robbins: Tip of the triangle always points in the direction the car was moving. His tibia's intact.

Robbins:  In fact, there's no bruising to the lower extremities. 

Grissom: So, no fractures, no bruising. Cause of death?

Robbins: Chest was crushed. Multiple rib fractures and hence the white bucket you and David filled with his intestines. They literally popped out.
Grissom: So he wasn't hit by the taxi; he was run over?

Robbins: Well, he would've died anyway.  He was stabbed. Clean incised wound to the abdomen. Five inches deep.

Grissom: So how much time elapsed between when he was stabbed and when he encountered the taxi?
Robbins: I can't give you an exact time frame except to say it wasn't immediate ... and before you ask, we don't have an ID, but missing persons called. A woman called and said her son didn't come home last night. She's on her way in.





Sara: You know you pulled me away from a forensic anthropology seminar, right? It's required. It's part of the continuing education program.
Grissom: Well, I'm sorry, but everyone seems to have something to do today. I have a teenager who was run over by a taxi. He wasn't hit by it; that's not what killed him. He was stabbed, fatally. For now, I have no ID, no suspects and no primary crime scene. I need you.

Sara: How can I help?




Sara: Hey, Grissom?

Sara: The directionality of this drop is facing the boulevard. I think the primary crime scene is ... this way.

(Camera POV of: Blood Drop #2; Marker Note reads: S.S. #2 / 12-02-02. With
&quot;N&quot; and an up arrow. Camera info reads: 125 f15p .)


Sara: Blood trail.
Grissom: Want to go for a walk?

Sara: Blood leads into the grass. Trail's obscured.

Grissom: Okay. So, where do we pick up the trail?

Sara: Well, vic's in his teens ... probably wasn't on the playground. My money's on the basketball court.


Grissom: He crossed Lake Mead Boulevard at 8:15 and it gets dark at 5:00. 
Sara: He was here after dark. 
Grissom: And I don't see any lights.
 
Sara: Droplets and castoff. This is our primary crime scene.

Grissom: So, maybe the killer tossed the knife. It's a big dump site.
Sara: Yeah. I'll, uh, order up some scent dogs ... get some uniforms.




Jan Branson: That's him. That's my boy.
Robbins: I'm so sorry.

Jan Branson: How did something like this happen? He's only 14 years old.
Robbins: Mrs. Branson, I'm afraid you'll have to talk with the detectives.




Warrick: Hey, Sara.
Sara: Hey.
Warrick: You working that case where some mob beat up an Indian cab driver for hitting a kid?
Sara: Cabbie didn't actually hit the kid. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Warrick: You think it was racially motivated?
Sara: Yeah, I do. White mob, white kid, dark-skinned cabbie -- I don't like the math.
Warrick: Yeah. We got to wait for the science, don't we?
Sara: I'm trying.
Warrick: That's the job. Good luck.





Joe: Captain, there's a Mrs. Branson here to see you.
Brass: Oh good. Send her in, Joe. Thanks.

Brass: Mrs. Branson, thank you for coming in ...

Jan Branson: Have you arrested that taxi driver?
Brass: He's in intensive care.
Jan Branson:  How did he not see my son? That's a well-lit intersection. My son is five foot six!
Brass: Please, Mrs. Branson ... please, sit down.

Brass: Um ...

Brass: Your son was stabbed in Haskell Park and you live on Loring Avenue. My best guess is that he was on his way home when the accident occurred.
Jan Branson: No, I don't understand.
Brass: The taxi didn't kill your son, but someone did. 

Brass: Did Todd have any problems that you're aware of? Did he have any problems at school?
Jan Branson: No, no, nothing like that. He's a ... he's a great kid. He's-he's athletic. He's popular. He's, uh, he's a good student. We-we moved here from Portland nine months ago. He fit right in.
Brass: Did you know he was in the park after sundown?
Jan Branson: No. I thought he was at a friend's for dinner. He was supposed to call me, but you know teenagers.
Brass:  Yeah, I do ... and they don't often confide in their parents, I know.
Jan Branson: Uh, I've been on the run from my ex-husband. He's threatened to kill me and my boys. I just try and stay one step ahead of him.
Brass: When was the last time you saw him?
Jan Branson: In Portland. He showed up outside of Todd's school. The boys and I were on a bus that evening. You know, a couple days ago, the phone rang. I answered it. It was him. I don't know how he found us here ... but this weekend, the boys and I were going to disappear.
Brass: Why didn't you call the police?

Brass: Because you knew we couldn't protect you.






Sara: What have you got?
Grissom: You got the gloves on.

Sara: Looking for a knife; uncover a gun.
Grissom: What is happening to our parks?


Grissom: Officer ... 

Sara: Back the dogs off, please.  Dead body found twenty yards from where our vic was knifed. You think they're related?
Grissom: Well they're related by geography ... but for now it's just a dead guy in the park.




;






Sara: Hey.
Catherine: Hey.
Sara: I thought you had a couple days off?
Catherine: I do, but I left these on my desk.  I'm on my way to Circus Circus with five nine-year-olds. It's Lindsey's birthday. Got to wrap a Bridal Barbie.
Sara: What's a Bridal Barbie?
Catherine: Funny. Oh, blue ... gun shot residue.
Sara: On our stabbing victim's jacket.
Catherine: So it means that he may have fired the revolver that you and Grissom found in the park?

Sara: Yeah. Too bad GSR testing can't tie the vic to a particular gun.
Catherine: Right. Hmm ... but maybe Grissom can.
Sara: Grissom?
Catherine: Yeah, I just passed him in ballistics. He was meditating on your revolver. Didn't even look up.
Sara:  Excuse me.

Catherine: Mm-hmm. 
Sara: Have fun.
Catherine: Thanks.




 
Sara: You know, you could've waited for me.

Grissom: Take a look at this.

Sara: Looks like burnt skin.
Grissom: I think maybe someone palmed the cylinder gap.

Sara: Todd Branson had GSR on his jacket. If we could get his DNA off this revolver we could tie him to this.
Grissom: Burnt skin is useless for DNA.
Sara: Yeah, but, what about sweat? There's a 17% chance of DNA recovery from the shooter's perspiration.
Grissom: 17%?
Sara: Yeah. New paper out of Australia. You haven't seen it?  17% chance of DNA recovery from the grip of a gun, 67% chance from a cigarette, 32% chance from the brim of a hat. Would you like a copy?
Grissom: I don't need one. I have you.  Swab the pistol grip; get it to DNA.





Grissom: Albert, did you notice if Todd Branson had any burn marks on his palms?
Robbins: No.
Grissom: What about this guy?
Robbins: Negative. What are you looking for?
Grissom: A specific injury.
Robbins: Well, I can't help you with burns but you'll want to check out this guy's right palm.

Grissom: An incised wound. Well, that's a common injury sustained by knife-wielding killers. 

Grissom: So assuming that this is the man who stabbed Todd Branson, what killed this guy?
Robbins: A bullet. It's lodged in the left ventricle. 
 
Robbins: I was contemplating my method of extraction when you arrived.
Grissom: You reach in and pull it out.
Robbins: Not if it's only a jacket fragment.
Grissom: Maybe a frangible bullet designed to fragment on impact?
Robbins: That would explain the mystery of the shattered femur. It's covered in copper dust. 


Robbins: I'll remove the heart, peel back the myocardium and get you what's left of that bullet.

Grissom: Did he have a dislocated shoulder?
Robbins: Yeah, torn musculature, but no inflammatory response.
Grissom: It happened postmortem?

David Phillips: Excuse me, I'm headed over to the hospital. Taxi driver didn't make it.

Robbins:  Another one for my table.
Grissom: Emerson once said &quot;The mob is man voluntarily descending to the nature of the beast.&quot; The beast is up for murder.




Brass: Hey, buddy, how's it going? 

Brass: I'm Detective Jim Brass from Las Vegas Police. Is your mother home?
Eric Branson:  No.
Brass: What's your name?
Eric Branson: Eric.
Brass: Sorry about your brother, Eric.
Eric Branson: Mom's out getting more boxes.
Brass: Yeah, she said that you were moving. Where are you going to?  You know, when I was a kid we moved around a lot. It's not easy. So you're going to be seeing your dad?
Eric Branson: My dad's dead. Died when I was two.
Brass: Hey, Eric, will you do me a favor?  When you see your mom ask her to give me a call, okay?

Eric Branson: Okay.
Brass: Take care.





Grissom: Is that the frangible?
Bobby Dawson: Yep. These were originally used in indoor shooting ranges where lead buildup's a problem. Copper's less toxic than lead. Take a look.

Bobby Dawson: On the left, bullet from the vic's heart. On the right, bullet test-fired from the revolver recovered at the scene.
Grissom: Oh, serendipity.
Bobby Dawson: Yep.

Sara: Hey.
Bobby Dawson: Hey. Just made a match to your revolver.
Sara: Nice. I ran the serial number through NCIC. It's registered to a Jonathan Raurk of San Jose, California.





Jan Branson: John's my ex. Is he in Las Vegas?
Brass: Well, we, uh ... we found a gun registered to him in the park where your son was murdered but when I spoke to your son Eric he told me that his father died years ago.
Jan Branson: That's what I told both my boys. I told them that John was killed in a car accident. It's not easy to lie to them like that but every time I move I have to make up some crazy story. I just want them to be able to sleep at night.
Grissom: Ms. Branson we also found a dead body in the park -- a white male in his mid-30s.
Jan Branson: You think it's John?
Grissom: We have no ID, but we have a photograph.

Jan Branson: No ... no, this ... this isn't John. This isn't my ex. This is Stewart. It's Stewart Bradley. He's my boyfriend.










Grissom: Where have you been?
Sara: I went back to the park. I kept thinking there must be some physical evidence connecting the stabbing to the shooting.

Grissom: Drag marks?
Sara: Leading from the basketball court to Stewart Bradley's body. We know Todd was bleeding but there were no blood drops around the drag marks.
Grissom: So you're thinking someone else was there? Now, the revolver was registered to the boy's biological father but they haven't seen each other in ten years.
Sara: Assuming Todd fired the gun, how did he get ahold of it?
Grissom: Well, maybe dad gave it to him behind mom's back.
Sara: Or ... maybe Todd wasn't the shooter.
Grissom: True. Presence of GSR only places Todd in the vicinity of the gunfire.
Sara: And since there were no burn marks on Todd's palms, evidence is suggesting someone else fired that gun.
Grissom: Which brings us back to dad.




Brass: You know something, John, you don't scare me. According to your ex-wife, you're some kind of monster -- threatening her life, setting her car on fire in Boston breaking and entering in Chicago, showing up at your kid's school in Portland ... I don't know, I mean, I thought maybe you'd be like the guy in &quot;Sleeping with the Enemy&quot;. You're more like Gumby, aren't you?
Jonathon Raurk: Look, if this is about my ex ... cop pulled me over outside Moapa. Jane lives in Vegas. I didn't violate any damn court order, all right?
Brass: You know where she lives.
Jonathon Raurk: Is that a crime?
Brass: Yesterday, your son Todd was murdered and that is a crime.

Brass: Hey! John, baby I'm not talking about the weather here, man. I'm talking about your son.
Jonathon Raurk: I haven't seen that kid since he was in his diapers. 
 
Jonathon Raurk: Geez, I didn't kill him, if that's where you're going to.
Brass: Hey, what about Stewart Bradley? You know? Yesterday, he was murdered, too. He was shot with your gun.

Jonathon Raurk: Which one?
Brass: Revolver. Smith &amp; Wesson.
Jonathon Raurk: No, I don't have a Smith &amp; Wesson.
Brass: It's registered to you, John. Has your name on it.
Jonathon Raurk: That got stolen.
Brass: Oh, you file a police report? But I know, you're busy. You forgot. That's okay. You know what I think happened? Here's what I think. You called up Todd, you said, &quot;Hey, Todd. Why don't you meet me down at Haskell Park? You know what? Why don't you bring mom's new boyfriend along?&quot;
Jonathon Raurk: No, no. Come on, man, whoa, whoa, hey. You know what? Last night, I was at Taos, New Mexico, okay? I didn't cross over until ... it was the afternoon in Nevada. Check it out. Adobe Inn. Watched pay-per-view and I had a pizza, okay?


Grissom: May I see your hands, please?
Brass: You better do what he says. He's in crime lab.

Grissom: Can you hold him?
Brass: He's got some unpaid speeding tickets. There's warrants that have been issued. Is three days good enough?
Grissom: For now.









Grissom:  What do you weigh?
Warrick: Uh, that's between me and my trainer.
Grissom: Do I have to get a scale?
Warrick: A buck 95, give or take a doughnut.

Sara: Don't even ask. I'm not telling you.
Grissom: Warrick, would you lie down on the floor?
Warrick: I don't get paid enough to play dead.
Grissom: Please?

Grissom: Sara, grab Warrick's right arm. See if you can drag him across the room.
Sara: This does have something to do with the case, right?
Grissom: You don't trust me?

Warrick:  You're such a drag.


Grissom:  Stay there a minute.

Grissom: Excuse me. Hi.  Judy, would you like to be part of a little experiment?
Judy:  I-I'm a secretary. Besides, I heard what you did to Greg's feet.
Grissom: You'll keep your shoes on, I promise.

Warrick: Can I get up?
Grissom: No. Spin around. Judy, would you take Warrick by the right arm and try and drag him across the room?
Warrick: Hi, Judy.
Judy: Hi.

Warrick: Hey, I like it gentle, okay?

Grissom: Thank you, Judy. You've been a big help.
Warrick: Thanks.
Grissom:  You can go back to the water cooler.

Warrick: You want to tell me what's going on here?
Grissom: Stewart Bradley had a dislocated shoulder postmortem. He's about the same weight as you. How does your shoulder feel?
Warrick: You saw her dragging me around. You know, I'm glad I can help. I, uh, I'm late for the chiropractor's. I'll send you the bill.

Sara: I get it. I'm bigger than Judy. In order to get momentum, she had to start and stop. Which could explain Stewart Bradley's postmortem dislocated shoulder.
Grissom: Especially if he was dragged by somebody with limited upper body strength.
Sara: Where does that get us?
Grissom: Well, maybe Jan Branson. She's about Judy's size.
Sara: Why would Jan Branson shoot her boyfriend?
Grissom: He stabbed her son.
Sara: Motive?
Grissom:  I don't know. But mothers protect their children, don't they?
Sara: Okay ... okay, so ... she sends Todd home, not knowing the severity of his wound. She buries her boyfriend's body. She ditches the knife, which we still haven't found. She hides the revolver ...
Grissom: ... so perhaps the evidence is in Mrs. Branson's hands.





Brass: Mrs. Branson, you got a minute?
Jan Branson: Uh, Eric and I are leaving town.
Brass: Well, your Ex has been picked up on an unrelated matter. Even if he makes bail, you still got a day or two head start.
Jan Branson: Good.
Grissom: Ms. Branson, may I see your hands?
Jan Branson: Excuse me?
Grissom: Could be important. Palms up, please.
 
(GRISSOM turns to talk with ERIC BRANSON.
Grissom: Hi, pal.
Eric Branson: Hi.
Brass: Hey, Eric. This is Mr. Grissom. We work together.
Grissom: May I see your hands, please?

Jan Branson: We have to get going.
Brass: As soon as Eric shows Mr. Grissom his hands you're on your way.
Grissom: Palms up.





Grissom: Eric ... I need to know how you burned your hand. 
Brass: Look at Mr. Grissom, Eric. Not your mother, okay? Ms. Karpell.
Ms. Karpell: Eric, it's okay to answer the question.
Eric Branson: I burned it on an iron.
Brass: I think something a lot more dangerous than that burned your hand.

Grissom: We recovered a gun ... in the park. Your burn indicates that your hand was over this gap when the gun was fired.


Eric Branson:  I followed Todd to the park.

Stewart Bradley: Todd, I got your e-mail. What's up?
Todd Branson: We're not moving again. I want you to tell mom you're passing on that promotion.
Stewart Bradley: You should discuss this with your mother. 
Todd Branson: She'll do whatever you say.
Stewart Bradley: You don't understand.
Todd Branson: I am not leaving my friends 'cause of you!
Stewart Bradley: Todd, this has nothing to do with me.

Eric Branson: Todd, no!


Todd Branson: Gotta get home.

Todd Branson: You gotta hide the body.


Eric Branson: I was just looking out for my brother.
Sara: I swabbed the pistol grip of the revolver. The DNA from the suspect's perspiration isn't a match to Todd's. But it is male. With eight markers in common and familial relationship.
Grissom: We found gunshot residue on Todd's jacket. We assumed that Todd fired the gun. But I think maybe he was standing next to you when you fired the gun. You didn't go to the park to stop Todd, did you? He went to the park to stop you.

Stewart Bradley: Eric, what's up?

Todd Branson: Whoa! Eric, Eric! Eric, don't be stupid.
Eric Branson: I'm not moving again! Not 'cause of him!

Eric Branson: Todd! Let go!


Eric Branson: Go home!

Brass: Where'd you get the revolver, Eric?
Jan Branson: From me.

Brass: Ms. Karpell ...
Ms. Karpell: Eric, why don't we step out in the hall for a few minutes.

Brass: So, the gun was in your possession and you didn't say anything.
Jan Branson: I, um ... I hid it in a lock box. And, uh, when I got that call from John a couple of days ago I took it out and I put in my nightstand. I didn't even know it was missing until this morning. And then, I thought that John must've gotten in the house and taken it. I was so sure that he was the one who killed Stewart. I've spent the last ten years looking over my shoulder every day.
Brass: Your boyfriend was found carrying a knife the night he died. I spoke to some of his friends and associates, and no one ever remembers him carrying a knife.
Sara: Ms. Branson? You warned your boyfriend about your ex-husband, didn't you?
Jan Branson: He asked me what was wrong and I shouldn't have said anything. He panicked. He overreacted. He started carrying a knife. What's going to happen to Eric?
Brass: He'll be remanded to a juvenile detention center, awaiting trial.
Jan Branson: And then?

Brass:  If he's convicted of a homicide he'll be sent to a state custodial facility until he's 21.





Grissom: Where we at, Greg?
Greg: I paged you, like, ten times.
Grissom: I was busy.
Greg: Well, so was I. First, I processed Mr. Khandelwahl's clothing. Then I compared the DNA I lifted from said clothing to the DNA from the dirty dozen.

Grissom: All I see is a sheet.
Greg: But what I do is art. And now, I'm ready to unveil it. Welcome to the new and improved match game.

Greg: Now, Graham Cooper grabbed Rajeeb's collar...

Greg: Claude Allen and Barry Lawrence used their fists ...

Greg: Joey Gillman, Bill Kendal and Rick Midgen got into it, too.
Grissom: Very nice presentation, Greg. What about the others? They all participated. They even bragged about it.
Greg: Well, only six of the twelve left behind their epithelials when their skin made contact with the vic's clothing. I've got no physical evidence to tie the others to the crime.










Woman: Stop!




Graham Cooper: Hey!




Grissom: The mob mentality ... relieves individuals from having to distinguish between right and wrong. 
Brass: Anonymity shields them from prosecution, though.
Grissom: Yeah, six of them, to be exact. 
Brass: Hmmm ...
Grissom: Unfortunately, physical evidence is limited by human action.
Brass: Well, nothing's absolute, Gil ... even forensics.
Grissom: Yeah, well ... this is as far as we can take it. It's up to you guys.




Brass: The physical evidence confirms that you're the &quot;hero&quot; who pulled the driver out of the cab.
Graham Cooper: I'd do it again, too.
Cooper's Lawyer: Mr. Cooper, why don't we just hear what Captain Brass has to say. 
Brass: You're looking at first degree murder.
Graham Cooper: What?!
Brass: Mr. Khandelwhal didn't make it.

Brass: ... and, for the record, he didn't hit that boy. He wasn't trying to flee the scene. He was reaching for his radio trying to call for help. You know who the real hero of this is? Rajeeb Khandelwhal. The taxi driver. So ... what does that make you?
Cooper's Lawyer: D.A. willing to deal?


Brass: : We want your buddies. I mean, either you talk or they'll talk. I mean, it doesn't matter. And the clock is ticking, so ...

Lyric: everything ... everything in its right place...

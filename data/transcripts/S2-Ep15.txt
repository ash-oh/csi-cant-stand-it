[EXT. - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The camera moves low to the ground. The leaves on the floor are rustling in the night wind. The camera catches up to a pair of legs walking; a flashlight casting a beam on the ground.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(Man with flashlight looking for something.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(Fog on the surface of the lake. Flashlight beams on a body partially in the water, partially on the shore. The light beams on the dead body's face. GRISSOM kneels in for a closer look. His flashlight catches some bugs on the dead body's arm. Without a backward glance, he moves on.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(GRISSOM moves toward an old white pick-up truck. He looks into the carriage and sees a dead body behind the driver's wheel, a rodent on the cadaver's left shoulder.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(GRISSOM walks along and sees something. He kneels down for a closer look. Behind him, a figure of another man makes his way toward GRISSOM. GRISSOM examines the dead body on the ground. The figure behind GRISSOM approaches. The flashlight clutched in his right hand turned off and swinging ominously.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM doesn't move and continues to examine the body on the ground, his back to the approaching figure. The figure behind reaches GRISSOM and kneels down. He looks at the dead body over GRISSOM'S shoulder.)</p>
<p><strong>Edward Cormier</strong>: That one's not ours.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You sure?</p>
<p><strong>Edward Cormier</strong>: I authorize all cadavers and associated research. He's not ours.</p>
<p>WHITE FLASH CUT TO:</p>

[EXT. BODY FARM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Sign on the fence reads: &quot;University of Western Nevada / Anthropology Department / Private Property / KEEP OUT / All persons in violation will be prosecuted under section 4204-325.5470 of the Nevada State Penal Code.&quot;)</p>
<p>(BRASS and CATHERINE walk toward the body. GRISSOM is already there with DAVID PHILLIPS.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: People donate their body to science end up submerged in a pond? Crammed in a car?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Body Farm; creepy.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: A Body Farm is not creepy. It's a controlled study of situational decomposition. All in all, a very healthy place.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Tell that to Slim hanging from the tree.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks over at the skeleton hanging from the tree not too far away from the one they were called in to examine.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Whoever placed our victim here knew that the body farm existed. What they didn't know is each body is tracked by a bunch of scientists.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Can't just slip a card into the deck.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE starts taking pictures.)</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Well, he's not in rigor. TSD is under six hours. I'll move him as soon as you're finished.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Any I.D.?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: None.</p>
<p>(DAVID stands and steps away from the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Okay, I'm going to move him.</p>
<p>(BRASS rolls the body over so that he's facing upward. CATHERINE takes more pictures.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Gunshot wound to the chest.</p>
<p>(Camera close up of a beetle walking out of the dead body's shirt.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, look. One of your friends.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM leans in an grabs the beetle.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It's a carpet beetle. It shouldn't be here.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Vic seem more like a hardwood floors kind of guy to you?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Carpet beetles are the last to arrive at a corpse -- when it's almost a skeleton. I mean, this guy's still fresh.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks around and sees the skeleton hanging from the tree. Camera close up on the carpet beetles on the skeleton's skull.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: David! Get this body out of here now! We got cross contamination!</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO BLACK. END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<hr />
[INT. CSI -- HALLWAY]</p>
<p>(SARA and CATHERINE are walking from the hallway to the breakroom.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Wow, you got to go to the body farm?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I've always wanted to go there. What was it like?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Quiet.</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - BREAK ROOM - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I hear Grissom goes there all the time. Like even on his nights off.</p>
<p>(WARRICK doesn't lift his head from the newspaper he's reading. NICK walks into camera view and heads for the refrigerator.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Why does that not surprise me?</p>
<p>(He opens the refrigerator and sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Man, something stinks in here again.</p>
<p>(NICK grabs his paper package.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What, bad milk? Cottage-cheese bad?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Worse. It's all over my sandwich. Smell that.</p>
<p>(He lifts his paper package and SARA reacts to the smell. She kneels and opens the refrigerator, glances in and notices the container on the top shelf.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Yeah. He's got one of his experiments in there.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You're kidding me?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Bugs or blood?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Not bugs.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (still reading paper) Oh, that's so not cool. That's a community fridge.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Man, someone has got to talk to Grissom about this.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks in.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Talk to me about what?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You leaving your experiments in our refrigerator.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, the lab fridge was full. I put in last night. </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well ... </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm going to test for horizontal motion on bloodstains. Vis-a-vis surface textures. </p>
<p>(NICK looks annoyed. CATHERINE takes a sip of her coffee and discretely tries to ignore the smell. GRISSOM is clueless as he takes out the container of blood from the fridge and opens it.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hey, any of you guys got any linoleum at home?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE catches a whiff of the open container and this time, she discretely pinches her nose trying to avoid the smell. SARA is quiet.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (sits down still annoyed at being ignored) That blood is rank, man.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I know. That's why the Red Cross gives it to us 'cause it's past its expiration date.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM merrily closes the cap on the container, opens the fridge and puts it back on the top shelf. He shuts the door and stands up.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (to CATHERINE) Anything new on the body farm victim?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE takes another sip from her coffee mug.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I gave the prints to identification. They're running through the bases now.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns to leave the room. Someone's pager goes off. It's GRISSOM'S.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'll be in autopsy. Let me know.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM leaves.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (doesn't look up from his paper) Way to go, Nick. You really told him.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I told him, he just ... doesn't hear it.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (o.s.) Yeah.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY]</p>
<p>(Top view close up of dead body from the Body Farm. ROBBINS has his finger in the bullet hole.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Well ... the entry wound tells me the body sustained a projectile.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: A bullet.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Uh, but there's no bullet fragments in the tissue and no exit wound.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So, how do you explain that?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Bullet wounds usually leave bullet evidence.</p>
<p>(Flash to white. Quick CGI POV of hand holding gun and squeezing trigger. Sound of gun firing. Camera close up of hammer cocking back and extreme close up of hammer hitting the 38 SPL bullet. Quick FX to bullet firing through the barrel of the gun and penetrating through the skin with bits of flesh splattering out. Bullet continues its path through the body. Cut to inside view of the body where bits and pieces of bone and bullet break up inside the body where some pieces embed themselves to the nearest organ. Flash to white. End of CGI POV. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: There's no evidence of a bullet in this wound tract.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So, let's excise it. Do a more localized search.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: That was my next suggestion.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What's your best tool for excising the tissue of our Mr. Doe?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks in.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, it's not a John Doe anymore. Database says that our victim is Mike Kimble age 38. He has a townhouse in Summerlin. Brass is going to meet us there along with the rest of the unit. My bet says that it's the primary crime scene.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Good.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes off his glasses. CATHERINE turns to leave and stops as she notices that GRISSOM'S not moving from his spot next to the autopsy table.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Aren't you coming?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We're excising a wound tract.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Sounds fascinating.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It is.</p>
<p>(ROBBINS turns on the hand saw. The blade whirs.)</p>
<p>(Off a camera close up of the hand saw, we hear a fire engine siren blaring.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. MIKE KIMBLE'S RESIDENCE -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Sirens blare. CATHERINE runs past firetruck #27 and finds WARRICK standing on the sidewalk with his CSI kit in his left hand staring at the house on fire in front of him.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Is that Mike Kimble's house?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: That's it.</p>
<p>(A large explosion emits from the second story window.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Seems like somebody beat us here.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You think? Neighbor called it in. She smelled the smoke. Thought he was barbecuing in his living room.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Where's his neighbor now?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Over there talking to Brass.</p>
<p>[EXT. -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p><strong>Female Neighbor</strong>: Um, no, I didn't hear any noise coming from Mike's place last night. But, um ... I was wearing my headphones, doing my workout.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Did Mr. Kimble have many visitors to his house?</p>
<p><strong>Female Neighbor</strong>: Other than his clients, just, um ... just his fiancée, Jane. Uh, but they usually stayed at her place.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Do you have the full name and address of the victim's fiancée, Jane?</p>
<p><strong>Female Neighbor</strong>: Yes, actually I do. It's in my kitchen. Uhm ... As soon as they let me back in I can get for you.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(ROBBINS pulls out something gooey from the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Something. A metal fragment. It's not like any bullet I've ever seen.</p>
<p>(Camera close up of the piece of metal ROBBINS holds.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Titanium ... maybe a pin.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: From the ribs?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Oh, here's the manufacturer's number. I should've bought stock when I first started finding all these medical implants.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM doesn't say anything. He pulls out a maggot.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Bovine.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Genus hypaderma. These are normally found in the intestinal tract of cows. These maggots aren't found in humans. </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Foreign tissue. Cow. Makes absolutely no sense.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The body farm also studies animals, not just humans.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: This more of your cross contamination?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Only one way to find out.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM smiles at the thought of yet another experiment.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[EXT. MIKE KIMBLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Firemen on a ladder and in the second floor of the burnt home. Water pours from the room onto the ground below.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. MIKE KIMBLE'S HOUSE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(NICK walks through the hallway, his flashlight lighting his way. He turns the corner and sees WARRICK. He puts his CSI kit down.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What up, doc? Oh, there you are.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Sorry I'm late. D.A. Wanted an update on my robbery case.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Oh, it's all good. I'm just starting my walk-through.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: The desk is crispy.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: There's a burn pattern for you. Fire burns upward. This is moving downward.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Defies the laws of physics. Fire's drawn to fire. Well, you know what we gotta do.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Check out the upstairs?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. -- UPSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: The guy who started the fire wanted to make sure the bedroom got it worse.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: How do you know it's a guy? Why are you jumping the gun?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, according to Sara, 94% of all arsonists are male.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, that sounds like Sara.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: The fire burned longest here.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It's the point of origin.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, right here. </p>
<p>(WARRICK leans in and sniffs.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I don't smell any accelerant.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Could have burned off. Fabric would have fueled it.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I don't know. It doesn't make any sense. A fire burning downward?</p>
<p>(Flash to white. CGI POV of fire burning near vent. Camera moves toward the vent and through the vent. Camera cut to inside the vent where the fire quickly moves up the vent and to the second floor where it starts up again by burning the desk. Flash to white. More fire flames getting larger and larger.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: (V.O.) Yeah, unless it was chasing after an accelerant. </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (V.O.) Furniture polish.</p>
<p>(Flash to white. End of flashback. Resume on NICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Warrick ... is that blood?</p>
<p>(NICK casts the light of his flashlight at WARRICK'S feet. WARRICK looks down, steps off of the carpet and lifts it up to reveal a large blood stain.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Oh, man. Something bad happened here.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: This fire is just a cover up.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>

[EXT./INT. JANE BRADLEY'S RESIDENCE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and BRASS ring the doorbell. JODY BRADLEY opens the door. She's on the phone.)</p>
<p><strong>Jody (giggling)</strong>: (to phone) Are you serious? Hold on a second. (to BRASS) Hi.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'm Detective Jim Brass. Is Jane Bradley in?</p>
<p><strong>Jody Bradley</strong>: She's in the kitchen. (to the phone) Really? No way.</p>
<p>(She holds the door open. CATHERINE and BRASS enter the house.)</p>
<p>SHORT TIME CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. JANE BRADLEY'S RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Camera close up on several pictures of MIKE KIMBLE with the BRADLEY family.)</p>
<p><strong>Jane Bradley</strong>: (o.s.) This can't be happening. Mike is dead? I don't know how I'm going to tell my kids. They love Mike.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You and Mike were engaged?</p>
<p><strong>Jane Bradley</strong>: The wedding was supposed to be in a week at the Tangiers.</p>
<p>(JAKE BRADLEY enters the kitchen. He has earphones on and walks straight for the refrigerator. He opens the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Jane Bradley</strong>: No sweets after ten. What's the rule?</p>
<p><strong>Jake Bradley</strong>: Oh, come on, mom, I'm starving.</p>
<p>(JANE BRADLEY takes the sweets out of her son's hand and replaces it with an apple.)</p>
<p><strong>Jane Bradley</strong>: Have an apple.</p>
<p>(He groans and walks out of the kitchen.)</p>
<p><strong>Jane Bradley</strong>: He's growing like a weed.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What was your fiancé's business?</p>
<p><strong>Jane Bradley</strong>: He was a photographer. He did weddings, events. We argued over who'd do our wedding because he didn't trust anyone else's work.</p>
<p>(In the background a door opens and closes. RUSS BRADLEY enters.)</p>
<p><strong>Russ Bradley</strong>: Hi.</p>
<p><strong>Jane Bradley</strong>: How many times have I said you have to knock? You can't just barge in this house.</p>
<p><strong>Russ Bradley</strong>: Maybe as many times as I've asked you to have the kids ready and out front on my nights?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You must be the ex-husband.</p>
<p><strong>Russ Bradley</strong>: What's going on? Are the kids all right? Is Jake in some kind of trouble?</p>
<p><strong>Jane Bradley</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Mike Kimble was killed tonight.</p>
<p><strong>Russ Bradley</strong>: Are you serious?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Would you mind showing us your hands?</p>
<p><strong>Russ Bradley</strong>: My hands? Why?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: To see if there's any gun powder or evidence of a burn on them.</p>
<p><strong>Russ Bradley</strong>: Sure. (holds out his hands for CATHERINE) Look, uh, I don't want to be rude, but ... I stop paying alimony the day Mike and Jane get married. I mean, I'm the last person who would have killed him.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: If we wanted to get in touch with you, how would we reach you?</p>
<p><strong>Russ Bradley</strong>: You can reach me at any of my four grocery stores. Any time.</p>
<p>(RUSS BRADLEY pulls out a business card from his wallet and gives it to BRASS.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We'll be in touch.</p>
<p><strong>Russ Bradley</strong>: I'm going to get the kids, if that's all right.</p>
<p><strong>Jane Bradley</strong>: They're in the den.</p>

<p>(Water drips from the ceiling. NICK is crouched low with a machine in his hands. The machine beeps steadily. GRISSOM enters the room from the hallway just as the machine starts to beep rapidly.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Accelerant.</p>
<p>(NICK looks up.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey. Yeah, Warrick said the fire was orange so low-temperature fuel. Something accessible ... gasoline, kerosene ... I thought you were at the post.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I was. </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: So, anyway, this is where the fire started. Victim's bedroom.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM starts looking around. NICK stands and starts looking around as well. GRISSOM moves off into another room. NICK glances at a burnt photograph in a frame.) </p>
<p>(GRISSOM finds a room that was not burned by the fire. He examines the items that wasn't burned. NICK catches up with GRISSOM and follows.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM pans the room with photographer equipment in it. Something catches his eye. A photograph in a frame of MIKE KIMBLE and the BRADLEYS holding a sign: &quot;Mike: Welcome to the Family&quot;. The same sign in propped up on the file behind the picture frame.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM moves in for a closer examination of the picture. He frowns. NICK enters the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Grissom ... Gris ...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sometimes, it's about where the fire isn't.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM removes the photo out of its frame. Behind the photo is a picture of JODY BRADLEY. Two photographs of her in suggestive poses, and a third with her naked back to the camera and looking over her shoulder. GRISSOM holds the photo comparatively to the family photograph where we can see that it's definitely JODY BRADLEY, the daughter, and not JANE BRADLEY, the fiancée.)</p>
<p>(Both GRISSOM and NICK are grim at the find and its implications.)</p>

<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What is that? There at the bottom right corner? Is that a finger?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, that's unusual, isn't it? A professional photographer gets a finger in the shot?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Maybe his good hand was otherwise engaged. I'm going to work on that for a while and see if I can get some ridge detail. Maybe even a fat print.</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did the fly find the beef in the wound and lay its eggs or did it bring the beef with him?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I did an experiment similar to this in San Francisco except the cross-contamination was blood. Wasn't a murder case, but it was instructional.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM straightens and puts the magnifying glass down.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: None of these beef particles are as big as the tissue found in Mike Kimble's wound tract. And I found out the ex-husband is the proud owner of a registered handgun.</p>

<p><strong>Russ Bradley</strong>: I'll tell you the truth. I ... I feel relieved. I'd like to make a formal confession.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY]</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He can confess to the homicide but we're still examining evidence on the arson.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The guy wants to take the heat for his daughter on the arson well, where's the harm in that?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The harm would be to the justice system unless I misunderstand our place in it.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Don't you think that little girl's been through enough?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What I think and what the evidence proves are possibly two different things.</p>

[INT. CSI - GRISSOM'S OFFICE]</p>
<p>(CLOSE UP OF &quot;Las Vegas Police Department - Request for Leave of Absence&quot; Form for Sara Sidle. GRISSOM is holding the form.)</p>
<p>(SARA enters GRISSOM'S office.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: It's, uh, just what it says: It's a request for a leave of absence -- six months ... year, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I was thinking of checking out the federal government system - FBI ...</p>
<p>(GRISSOM snorts.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We have the best lab in the country.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I need a different work environment.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What does that mean?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: One with, um, communication ... respect.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Everybody here respects you.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: You don't.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Is this about that hamburger thing?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No, Grissom ... this is not about that &quot;Hamburger&quot; thing. I-I-I don't believe you. How can you reduce everything that I've said to some kind of single quirk? Do you think the problem here is just about me? </p>
<p>(GRISSOM seems surprised.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: If you don't sign my leave, I'm going to have to quit.</p>
<p>(SARA turns to leave. GRISSOM stops her.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hey, Sara? </p>
<p>(She turns around.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The Lab needs you here.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Great.</p>
<p>(SARA walks out. Camera holds on GRISSOM.)</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>

[INT. CSI - LAB]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM enters the room. CATHERINE is holding a fake hand. She's preparing to conduct a test.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did you hear the dad copped a plea on the murder and the D.A. expedited it?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Voluntary man, first offense. Out on bail. Free in four. No jury was going to convict a father for killing his daughter's abuser. What do you have?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Accelerant. Identical to the type found at the arson. Police got it out of Jody's gym locker.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE holds the hot curling iron to the wrist of the fake hand. She puts the curling iron down and compares the burn with a photograph of JODY BRADLEY'S burnt wrist.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Looks as if Jody was probably telling the truth. She did burn herself on a curling iron.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So who started the fire?</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - AUDIO/VISUAL LAB]</p>
<p>(WARRICK continues working on the photograph. Instead of the thumbprint, he's concentrating on the eye. NICK enters the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: You get anywhere with those fingerprints?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Back burner. I've been working on this reflection in her eye. You see what I'm seeing?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Come on, man. I've been working on this enhancement all night. Look closer.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: What is it? A clock, a mirror? It's got a latch, a lock. A porthole? ... It's a porthole?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah. These pictures were taken on a boat.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY]</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Miss Bradley.</p>
<p><strong>Jane Bradley</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Warrick Brown. Your fiancé, Mike, did he own a boat?</p>
<p><strong>Jane Bradley</strong>: A boat? No.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No? Did he borrow one or rent one?</p>
<p><strong>Jane Bradley</strong>: He wanted to borrow my ex-husband's boat but he was too proud to ask.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Your ex-husband owned a boat?</p>
<p><strong>Jane Bradley</strong>: He bought one after our divorce. I've never been on it.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (grimly) Okay. Thank you.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. RUSS BRADLEY'S BOAT -- NIGHT]</p>
<p>(WARRICK peers into the cabin. He's holding his flashlight and carrying his CSI kit. He puts the kit down and descends into the cabin without it.)</p>
<p>(He looks around. He sees the porthole. He snaps a couple of pictures of it.)</p>

[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERROGATION ROOM]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE is carrying two glasses of refreshment. She puts it down on the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Jody? We know that Mike gave you his camera. We suspect that your father used it to take pictures of you on his boat. </p>
<p>(JODY looks at CATHERINE. She looks away.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We believe that he then placed the camera back at Mike's to implicate him along with the pictures.</p>
<p><strong>Jody Bradley</strong>: He said I was like my mom when she was young and they were happy. He said having me was like having his family back.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE closes her eyes for a moment.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Did you ever tell your mom?</p>
<p><strong>Jody Bradley</strong>: I tried.</p>
<p>&lt;FLASHBACK&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Jody Bradley</strong>: I don't want to go to dad's.</p>
<p><strong>Jane Bradley</strong>: You know what the judge said: Two weeks with dad, two with me.</p>
<p>&lt;/FLASHBACK&gt;</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Jody, we have strong forensic evidence against your father. But cases like this are very difficult to prove. A victim testifying makes all the difference.</p>
<p><strong>Jody Bradley</strong>: He told me if I ever talked, he'd kill me.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Jody, if you don't talk ...</p>
<p><strong>Jody Bradley</strong>: I told Mike and he was going to fix things. </p>
<p>(Quick Flashback to MIKE KIMBLE comforting an upset JODY BRADLEY. Cut to the exchange being witnessed by RUSS BRADLEY. Flash to white.)</p>
<p><strong>Jody Bradley</strong>: And my dad killed him ... okay?</p>
<p>(JODY BRADLEY looks away. CATHERINE closes her eyes.)</p>
<p>(The door opens and WARRICK enters the room. He's carrying a large paper package. CATHERINE stands and meets him at the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Catherine.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What is this?</p>
<p>(WARRICK opens the package. CATHERINE looks inside.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Found it on the boat. DNA just ran it. She's under 14, right?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, 12.</p>
<p>(WARRICK looks at CATHERINE. The gravity of the crime hitting them hard. WARRICK closes the package, nods his head, and exits the room.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERROGATION ROOM]</p>
<p><strong>Brad Gottleib(lawyer)</strong>: He didn't take pictures of his daughter. He never touched her. He's a loving, devoted father who works hard at his chain of grocery stores to keep her in good schools.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Except when she's on his boat, right?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM is holding a file folder close to his chest. He pulls out a photograph from the folder and puts it on the table. It's a piece of plaid cloth with a large, white stain on it.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This is your sleeping bag we took off your boat. Our lab turned it inside-out. The discoloration you see is a mixture of vaginal and seminal fluid ... your daughter's and yours.</p>
<p><strong>Russ Bradley</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Brad Gottleib</strong>: Don't say a word, Russ.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: He doesn't have to. The sleeping bag's talking loud and clear.</p>
<p><strong>Russ Bradley</strong>: Brad, make me a deal.</p>
<p><strong>Brad Gottleib</strong>: I can't.</p>
<p><strong>Russ Bradley</strong>: What do you mean you can't? You got me four years for murder.</p>
<p><strong>Brad Gottleib</strong>: I can't.</p>
<p><strong>Russ Bradley</strong>: (insisting) You can get me something.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (interrupting) No, he can't. In the State of Nevada, we're all bound by a legal statute. The sexual assault of a minor age 14 and under is a mandatory life sentence with no possibility for parole.</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
(Through the glass, we see RUSS BRADLEY in handcuffs and being taken away by an officer.)</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks down the hallway. JANE BRADLEY and JODY BRADLEY are walking toward her on their way out.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Excuse me. Could I talk to you for a moment?</p>
<p><strong>Jane Bradley</strong>: Why don't you wait over there, sweetie.</p>
<p><strong>Jody Bradley</strong>: Okay.</p>
<p>(JODY BRADLEY leaves CATHERINE and JANE BRADLEY alone.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I owe you an apology. I have an eight-year-old daughter.</p>
<p><strong>Jane Bradley</strong>: It's okay. You were looking out for mine.</p>
<p>(JANE BRADLEY leaves. CATHERINE turns around to watch mother and daughter, hand-in-hand, walk out of the hallway.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<hr />
[INT. GRISSOM'S RESIDENCE - NIGHT]</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (o.s.) Tough case, huh?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE pours herself a drink and sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Just give me a straight-ahead murder any day.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, you wouldn't be human if it didn't affect you.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM is busy cutting something on a small cutting board.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I heard about you and ... uh ... Sara.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (brushes it off) Sara, you know, she gets very emotional ... </p>
<p>(CATHERINE shakes her head.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Are you in denial? No, that's ... no, no ... way too analytical. Wow, you got burned bad, huh? Welcome to the club. I got third-degree burns from my marriage. Happens to everybody. Everybody just moves on.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Good. Let's move on.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE'S not one to be put off. She tries again.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: But you have to deal with it. You have to deal with it first. You got to deal with it before it goes away. You are the supervisor. You have responsibilities, and people are making a family around you whether you like it not, whether you give them permission or not. We don't have to go to the Grand Tetons together, just ... every now and then you got to lift your head up out of that microscope.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM nods thoughtfully at CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE watches GRISSOM as he absently wipes his hands clean on the blue dish rag. She smiles and seems satisfied that he's finally getting it. She moves to the living room where she takes a sip of her drink and looks out of the window. Her back is turned to him ... allowing him some privacy.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM glances over at CATHERINE. CATHERINE looks back at GRISSOM and smiles.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM puts the dish rag down and reaches for his little black address book. He sighs. He leafs through it and picks up the phone when he finds the number he's looking for.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks out of the window, her back to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM dials the phone.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (awkwardly on phone) Yeah, hi. I-I-I'd like to get some flowers for a girl. No, no. Not flowers. A plant. A living plant. She likes vegetation.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE sits down on the sofa. She smiles and takes a sip from her glass.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, that'd be fine. To a Sara Sidle. Deliver it at the CSI division, Las Vegas Police Department the one out on North Trop Boulevard. Yeah, you can bill me at the same place. Gil Grissom. (pause) The sentiment? Oh-oh, on the card. Yeah. Um, uh ... have it say ... have it say, uh ... &quot;From Grissom.&quot;</p>
<p>(He nods his head, satisfied.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (on phone) Thank you.</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>

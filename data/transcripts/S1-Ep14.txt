Matthew: Come on, Sky! Come on Sky. Sky, come on.

Matthew: Go get it, girl!

Matthew: Come on, Sky. Come on, girl. Bring it back.

Matthew: Good girl. 

Matthew: That's not sky's stick.

Robb: What do you got there, Sky? Come here, girl. What did you get here?
Matthew: Dad, what is it?
Robb: Nothing ... it's just ... uh, just an old bone probably from a dead animal or something.

CUT TO:



Grissom: It's a tibia ... or most of a tibia.
Catherine: How long you think it's been out here?
Grissom: Well, long enough for the animals to pick it clean.
Catherine: And long enough for the elements to have washed away any evidence.
Grissom: Evidence of what?
Catherine: Well, it is a leg bone, and my guess is that it didn't walk out here by itself.
Grissom: It could have been a hiker who got lost. It's interesting to me how you always expect the worst.
Catherine: You see, that way, I'm never disappointed. You know, sometimes I'm nicely surprised. So, can we call it a crime scene?
Grissom: Potential crime scene. Did you know that there's 206 bones in the human body?
Catherine: Yes, professor, I, too, took Osteology.
Grissom: Well, 205 more bones and we have a complete skeleton. If we find the rest, then we can determine whether or not it was a murder.
Catherine: Well, I feel it in every one of my 206 bones that this was a murder.
HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS


FADE IN.



Grissom: Okay, Catherine and I are on the case at Mount Charleston. Nick, we could use your help on that.
Nick: Outstanding.

Catherine: So we just talked with the academy. We're getting an entire class of cadets meeting us there.
Warrick: All you guys got to go on is a bone?
Catherine: Mm-hmm.
Grissom: The tibia. Where there's one there's usually another.
Catherine: So we'll do a grid search and we really could use your friend Teri Miller.

Grissom: I don't think that's necessary.
Catherine: Well, why not? She's a forensic anthropologist -- specializes in bones -- and, hello ... all we've got is a bone.
Grissom: I know what she specializes in. If we hit a wall, I'll call her.
Catherine: Okay.

Grissom: Sara, Warrick -- dead body in the lucky seven motel.

Sara: Is that the place with that weird pool?
Catherine: Oh, yeah.

Warrick:  Maid found dead male body in a hotel room.
Sara: Any chance it's old age?
Warrick: Guy's 23. No. Sounds like a live one. 

Warrick: Let's go.
CUT TO:



Catherine: Stop!

Cadet: Looks like a piece of skull bone.

Catherine:  What are you doing?
Grissom: Bones are porous. They stick to the tongue. 
This doesn't stick.  It's a piece of rock.

Catherine: I-I hope you had your Hepatitis B shot. 

Catherine: Did you?

Grissom: It could be a piece of wrist bone.
Catherine: Well, do you want to suck it ... to be sure?
Grissom: Flag man!



Catherine: Flag!


Grissom: Flag!




Catherine: So ... you thinking what I'm thinking?
Grissom: How amazing the universe is. Everything made from the same carbon -- stars to trees, trucks to human bones.
Catherine: Mmm ... no. I-I was thinking that we have about 100 bone fragments. We could I.D. this body before the end of the shift.
Grissom: Hmm.
Catherine: Stars and trucks?

CUT TO:


 
Sara: Only in Vegas.
CUT TO:


 
Warrick: Looks like somebody had a par-tay.
Sgt. O'Riley: Here's a wallet. 

Sgt. O'Riley: Couple 20s inside.
Warrick: &quot;Darren Pyne.&quot; Dead at 23.

Sara: Sign of struggle. I'll dust for prints.
Warrick: Looks like he was whacked over the head with this lamp.
Sara: Yeah. One hit or there would be blood.
Warrick: Unless each hit was to a different part on his dome. Who's the room registered to?

Sara: Well, you know, that would be Celine Dion.

Sara: But, uh, the bill was charged to the credit card of a Lynn Henry, Eau Claire, Wisconsin.
Warrick: Hey, O'Riley, you think ... 

Sgt. O'Riley:  Find out the last place she used her credit card.
CUT TO:






Woman: I love those shoes. WOMAN: You can wear them again. WOMAN: What about the veil? WOMAN: You've got to remember the veil.
Warrick: Lynn Henry?
Lynn Henry: You know my name. What's yours?
Warrick: I'm Warrick Brown, and this is Sara Sidle.
Sara: Hi.
Warrick: We're with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
Lynn Henry: Crime lab? About what?

Warrick: Darren Pyne was found dead in your motel room at the Lucky Seven. Did you know him?
Lynn Henry: Oh, my god. Yes, I-I do know him. Sort of.

Sara: Sort of?
Lynn Henry: Uh, we, we gave Meg a bachelorette party last night. 
Joyce Lanier: We hired a male dancer.
Meg Wheeler: I didn't want my fiancé to know. Because he's staying at this hotel.
Lynn Henry: So we rented a room in a sort of out-of-the-way place.
Sara: So Darren was the dancer?
Lynn Henry: Yeah. Uh ... he arrived around ... 10:00?

Joyce Lanier: Oh, my god! Whoo! JOYCE LANIER: If Steve could see me now. LYNN HENRY: No husbands tonight, ladies. MEG WHEELER: Or fiancés.



Lynn Henry: We left at 3:00. He was totally fine.
Meg Wheeler: He was dance out but definitely alive.
Warrick: He didn't leave when you did?
Lynn Henry: No. He asked if he could stay and the room was already paid for, so I didn't see a problem.
Sara: Lynn, how did you get those bruises on your wrists?

Lynn Henry: Oh, my god! I-I don't know. I-I was totally tipsy last night. I mean, falling all over everything.
Warrick: All right. We'll probably have more questions after the coroner completes his autopsy. If we need to talk to you can we reach you here?
Meg Wheeler: Yes. My wedding is tomorrow. Whatever we can do to help.
Sara: Thanks. Our card.

CUT TO:








Catherine: That's the femur.
(GRISSOM picks up a bone piece.
Grissom: Ankle bone? Medial malleolous? Goes on the bottom of the tibia?
Catherine:  That is correct. According to the book.
Grissom: I'll take toe bones for $200, Alex.



Grissom: &quot;All the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't put Humpty Dumpty back together again.&quot;
Catherine:  Hmm. Have we hit a wall yet?
Grissom: No. This was a man, judging by the pelvic bone. 



Grissom: Hey, Nicky?
Nick: Yeah.
Grissom: Let's post this on the dental society database -- see if anyone responds.
Nick: You got it.

Grissom: Five times the length of the humerus means this guy was... six feet tall. But we don't know his race, and we don't know whether he was right-or left-handed yet.
Catherine: Well, he was old-- there's some calcification on the rib cartilage.
60, 70 years old, maybe. 
Grissom: Hmm.

Catherine: Are the bones whispering to you?


Grissom: Look at these jagged marks on the bone.
Catherine: Wait a minute. This guy was chopped up. That's murder.
Grissom: Well, not necessarily. Could have happened postmortem. You know, one of those tractors up in the hills. Or a mulching machine maybe. 
Catherine: A mulching machine? How long do you plan on ignoring the obvious? 

Catherine: A 70-year-old man found in the mountains with clear evidence he was chopped to pieces. That's a ... homicide.
Teri Miller: Well, you should check for hemorrhagic tissue at the bone's tool marks ... to be certain.

Grissom: Teri.
Teri Miller: Hi.
Catherine: Thanks for coming, Teri.

Catherine: I told you I was ... calling Teri ... ... didn't I? Anyway, what were you saying about hemorrhagic tissue?
Grissom: It's blood in the soft tissue. If you find it, it means the guy was alive when he was cut up.
Teri Miller: Hmm. Well, maybe you two don't need me, after all.
Grissom: I would never turn away a scientist of your talent.

Grissom: Uh, could I have a word with you outside, please?
CUT TO:


 
Grissom: You bring in a specialist without my approval?
Catherine: And you don't bring in one, possibly compromise the case, because you two had a relationship?
Grissom: Relationship? I hardly know that woman.
Catherine: Oh ... so I guess that dopey look in your eye when she's around is just that. Here's the deal -- we're using cliff notes to put that skeleton back together in there. Teri is availing her services. You said she's the best, but, hey, if you want me to send her away ...
Grissom: Just ...  ... check with me about stuff like this, will you?

Catherine: Right.
CUT TO:



Grissom: Sorry. So, how did we do?
Teri Miller: Not bad. 

Teri Miller: Scaphoid... cuneiform. However, this is a wrist bone and this ... is a foot bone.

Grissom: I'm glad you're here.

FADE TO BLACK.


FADE IN.


 
Nick: It looks like somebody in the dental society database saw our posting.
Catherine: Really?
Nick: Sid Tucker.
Catherine: No way. A local dentist. 
Nick: He has records that go back thirty years.
Catherine: Move over. 

Catherine: 
Oh, god, why didn't I learn latin?

Nick: It's lower level third from the middle. 

Nick: Better memory than you. And ... our first character match.

Catherine: &quot;Overlapping left incisors.&quot; That's the front teeth, right?
Nick: Two for two.

Catherine: &quot;Gold fillings.&quot; Well, I know that. He's got gold fillings in
&quot;adjoining right molars and interspersed in left molars&quot;. Tell me this is all we need.
Nick: Nolan Ryan pitches another perfect game.
Catherine: And the winner is ...

Nick: Mel Bennett. 326 Franklin Street. Date of birth September 6, 1931. He was 70.
CUT TO:



Grissom: An electric saw? You sure?
Teri Miller: Grooves from a handsaw would be straight, parallel. Now look at the grooves along the medial condyle of the femur. They're coarse. See? A reciprocating electric saw was used on this person.

Catherine: Excuse me. Um ... the person's name is Mel Bennett. We just confirmed it. We're going to meet Brass at the widow's house.
Grissom:  I got to go. Thank you.
Teri Miller: You're welcome.
Grissom: Nick, would you stay here and work with Teri on this soft tissue stuff? She'll explain it to you.
Nick: Sure.
CUT TO:



Dr. Albert Robbins: Our male dancer.
Warrick: Multiple blows to the head?
Dr. Albert Robbins: That's right. And one of those blows did enough damage to cause cranial bleeding. Any of your ladies mention having s*x with this victim?

Warrick: No. Just lap dances-- nothing more.
Dr. Albert Robbins: I think the dance might have been a bit more intimate. Penile swab's back from the lab.

Dr. Albert Robbins: Vaginal cells.
Warrick: Looks like fried eggs.
Dr. Albert Robbins: That's because the cells are fresh. Darren had s*x just before he died.
Warrick: What's the estimated time of death?
DR. ALBERT ROBBINS Midnight.
Warrick: What?! These ladies said he was alive when they left him at 3:00 A.M.
Dr. Albert Robbins: Someone's lying.
CUT TO:



Meg Wheeler: I don't mean to be snippy, but we're already late for my rehearsal dinner.
Sara: Dinner's going to have to wait.
Warrick: We have forensic proof that Darren Pyne had s*x with a woman just before he died.
Sara: And, as far as we can tell you were the last three women with him. So, who's lying?
Joyce Lanier: I have two small children and a husband. I can't be involved in this.
Lynn Henry:  Joyce ... shut up.
Sara: About what? Lynn, does this have anything to do with the bruises on your wrists?
Warrick: Hey, tell us or tell the D.A. 
Lynn Henry: Okay. After the bachelorette party, we left.

Lynn Henry:  I forgot my purse, so I went back in to get it.


Lynn Henry: Let go.

Lynn Henry: No! Get off! Oh, no.

Lynn Henry:  I told him no, but he just wouldn't take no for an answer.

Warrick: So he raped you.
Lynn Henry: That's how I got the bruises on my wrists. I didn't even tell them until we got back to the hotel.
Warrick: Was Darren alive when you left?
Lynn Henry: Very... unfortunately.
Meg Wheeler: So ... can we go now? My fiancé is already asking questions.
Sara: Yeah, you can go.

Sara: But, Lynn, uh ... a car's going to take you to the hospital for an exam.
Lynn Henry: An exam for what?
Warrick: It's just standard procedure for sexual assault.
 
CUT TO:


 
Rose Bennett: Yes?
Brass: I'm Detective Jim Brass -- Las Vegas Police Department. Are you Mrs. Bennett?
Rose Bennett: Oh, yes. Is this about my car plates? I have them. I just haven't had time to put them on the car.
GRISSOM; Actually, Mrs. Bennett we're here about your husband, Mel.
Rose Bennett: Oh, well, Mel isn't here right now.
Catherine: Well, do you know where he is?

Rose Bennett: Yes. He's at the store. Is there a problem?
CUT TO:


Brass: Mrs. Bennett, everything is all right. We're just going to ask a few questions down at the station.
Grissom: She looks distraught.
Catherine: Is that because she just found out he's dead or because she got caught?


Grissom: Interesting how people catalog their lives. Fifty years of marriage on the wall.
Brass: Yeah, that's a lot of years. Maybe a few too many for the missus.
Catherine: Oh, I don't know. These two were good with each other. 

Catherine:  It takes a bad marriage to recognize a good one.



Catherine: Well, not even an aspirin. 

Catherine: Look at this. The tub hasn't been used in a while.
Grissom: Well, maybe she only uses her other bathroom.


Catherine: Tub's the most obvious place to cut up a body but I don't see anything down there.
Grissom: Try phenolphthalein?
Catherine: Give me a swab.

Grissom: Hmm...
CUT TO:


Brass: How did you guys do?
Catherine: We found blood in the drain.
Grissom: You find anything?
Brass: Just the murder weapon.

Brass: Cleaned, in the widow's garage.
CUT TO:



Teri Miller: Bone of a pig. They are the most like humans, as you know.

Catherine: And this saw matches the one that Brass found in Mrs. Bennett's garage?
Teri Miller: Exact model. No doubt about it. The marks on this bone are consistent with the marks on Mel Bennett's bones. Exact same electric saw, same blade.
Grissom: Can you tell us anything about the operator?
Catherine: You mean Mrs. Bennett? 

Catherine: Oh, right.  Reserve judgment.
Teri Miller: How someone operates a saw is as telling as how someone operates a pen. Now, look at the femur. The skipping marks of the saw over the bone tell us whoever used the saw was unfamiliar with its use. An amateur, if you will. Someone with or a weakened nature. Compromised musculature. 

FADE OUT.
FADE IN.



 
Warrick: What do you mean, &quot;it doesn't add up?&quot;
Sara: Well, we're assuming that a couple of lamp hits to the head killed Darren, right?
Warrick: For now, yeah.
Sara: You read the coroner's final report. There's no traces of that lamp on his head at points of impact.
Warrick: Yeah, but maybe the materials didn't adhere. Doesn't mean he wasn't hit in the head with the lamp. 

Warrick: What are you looking for?
Sara: I don't know. I'll let you know when I find it.
Warrick: Well, if you don't know, I can't help you.

Warrick: What is this?
Sara: What? What do you got?

Warrick: Something-something.
Sara: Where?
Warrick: Right there.
Sara: Nice. 

Sara: Tiniest diamond in the world.
Warrick: Oh, you think so, huh? 

Warrick: No. Diamonds cut glass. This is some cheap-ass cubic zirconia.
Sara: The bride-to-be's ring, maybe? She was here.
Warrick: Let's go ask her.
CUT TO:


 
Rose Bennett: Why do you keep asking me these kinds of questions?
Brass: Well, because someone killed your husband, Mrs. Bennett ... and was strong enough to wield an electric saw to do it.
Catherine: But not so strong as to make clean cuts.
Rose Bennett:  I didn't kill Mel. I loved him.
Brass: Why didn't you report him missing? Were you used to him leaving or did you fight much?
Rose Bennett: Never. Never. We had a perfect marriage. Perfect.
Grissom: And you failed to report him missing for seven months because ... ?
Rose Bennett: I don't like your tone, young man. Detective, you said I could have an attorney at any time. I think I'd like one now.
Brass: Oh, sure, Mrs. Bennett, sure. Just sign this form please.

CUT TO:



Sara: Every time we go to find these women they're somewhere else. You sure you got that address? That desk clerk was talking very quickly.
Warrick: They talk faster at the sports book.
Sara: What?
Warrick: In the old days.
Sara: Oh. You think we're dressed for a wedding?
Warrick: Yeah. Not my wedding.

Warrick: What?
Sara: Lynn Henry's SART exam's in.

Warrick: She lied to us.
Sara: At this point, I think all those girls are lying to us.
Warrick: All right, let's call homicide and tell them to meet us there. Let's put this to bed before the honeymoon.
CUT TO:








Sgt. O'Riley: Sorry, Elvis. Your wedding party has to leave the building.

Joyce Lanier:  What?
Lynn Henry: Oh, my god.
Meg Wheeler: What's going on?
Sgt. O'Riley: All three of you ladies are coming in for questioning in the murder of Darren Pyne.
Luke: Murder? Is this a joke?
Sara: The clock's going to explain it all, believe me.
Luke: The ... the clock? What ... what clock?
CUT TO:



Grissom: Hey. Where you going?
Teri Miller: I'm leaving.
Grissom: Town?
Teri Miller: Don't worry, I was able to isolate some soft tissue from the preserved vertebrae. Nick's working on it now.

Catherine: Well, I'm going to go check that out. Teri ...  ... You rule.
Teri Miller: Thanks, Catherine.

Grissom: Well ... have a safe trip.
Teri Miller: Yeah. 

Teri Miller: I-I need to apologize for not returning your call last month.
Grissom: Teri, I admire your dedication to your work.
Teri Miller: Um ... dedication to my work didn't keep me from returning your call.
Grissom: Oh. It ... it was nothing. I-I-I just called to see how you were doing.
Teri Miller: Um ... well ... are you still interested in how I'm doing?
Grissom: Of course. So ... what's next?
Teri Miller: Mutilation in the Everglades.
Grissom: Maybe it was just an alligator.
Teri Miller: Yeah. And if it's not, I'll be filing for a change of address again. Anyway ... I got to go.

Grissom: Do you have to go? I mean ... couldn't you take a later flight?
Teri Miller: More bones?
Grissom: Have dinner with me later.

Teri Miller: I think the bodies will keep.
CUT TO:



Nick: See this tissue?

Catherine: I do. There's no evidence of blood.
Nick: Yeah. Tells us blood was not pumping through Mel Bennett's veins when he was cut up.
Catherine: Which means he was already dead.
Nick: Yeah. 
Catherine: So what does that leave us?
Grissom: A spectrum of possibilities.

Grissom: The universe.
Catherine: Leaves me with a black widow.
CUT TO:



Margaret Finn: We want to thank the crime lab for discovering that Mrs. Bennett's husband was dead when she disassembled him.
Catherine: Disassembled him? So she admits to taking an electric saw to her husband?
Margaret Finn: After he was dead, yes. As you know, in Nevada, there's no law against cutting up a dead body.
Catherine: There's no law saying it's okay, either.
Grissom: Does your client care to tell us how her husband came to be dead?
Margaret Finn: Well, she has no idea. She came home from the grocer's went into the bathroom and there he was in the tub, deceased.
Rose Bennett: No. I-I want to explain.
Margaret Finn: Briefly, Mrs. Bennett.
Rose Bennett:  I couldn't afford the burial. So I-I got the saw ... and I cut him into manageable pieces.
Catherine: &quot;Manageable&quot;?
Rose Bennett: Mmm.
Grissom: You made it easier to transport his body?
Rose Bennett: Yeah. To Mount Charleston.

Brass: I called that whistle-blower's line at the local treasury office. You know, the one that handles social security fraud? They were happy to help.

Catherine: Well, Mrs. Bennett ... can you afford the burial now?
Margaret Finn: What are you talking about?
Catherine: It's her husband's social security checks from the last two years.
Brass: The signature's the same till seven months ago. Q.D. Matched the lady's writing. Mrs. Bennett, you've been cashing your dearly departed's checks, haven't you?
Grissom: And that's fraud.
Catherine: It's also a motive.
Margaret Finn: You want to alert the government about some forged social security checks, be my guest. But there's no murder here. We're done. Mrs. Bennett.

FADE OUT.

FADE IN.




Catherine: Typical Vegas wife - off'ed her old man for the money and there's nothing we can do about it.
Grissom: We have to go back to the body.
Catherine: Right. There's always a clue except we don't have a body.
Grissom: We have bones.
CUT TO:



CUT TO:



Greg Sanders: Skeletal muscle of Mel Bennett. It goes in ... contents come out. In 30 seconds -- bioassay. I like saying that word. Bioassay. Sounds nubian. So how are you?
CATHERINE; Never better.
Greg Sanders: Yeah? Well, you look good.
Catherine: I try.
Greg Sanders: Yeah. I heard Grissom's lady friend was in town.
Catherine: Ladyfriend? Hmm. Wouldn't know anything about that.
Greg Sanders: Really? I thought you and Grissom were tight.
Catherine: We are.

Greg Sanders: Okay. Got it. Private.

Greg Sanders: Huh. Digoxin.
Catherine: Digoxin?
CUT TO:



Grissom: It's supposed to treat heart failure but not if you're taking the amount found in Mel Bennett's bones.
Catherine: She poisoned him.
(GRISSOM looks at CATHERINE.
Grissom: &quot;Someone&quot; did. 
CUT TO:



Grissom: We know your husband had an overdose in his system. We found it in his bone tissue.
Catherine: Did you kill him for his pension checks?
Margaret Finn: Don't answer that question.
Rose Bennett: It's okay. Mel took those pills himself. He asked me to leave the house, so he could do it.
Brass: So now it's suicide?
Rose Bennett: He was dying from the heart trouble. He was in chronic pain. He asked me to get it over with. I couldn't. I loved him.
Grissom: This is the part that I'm having a hard time with. You were able to cut him up when you realized you couldn't afford the burial?
Rose Bennett: I lied about why.
Margaret Finn: Mrs. Bennett, don't ...
Rose Bennett: No. Let me talk. Mel made me promise to hide his body so I wouldn't lose his social security benefits.
Catherine:  Because a wife's benefits are cut in half when the husband dies.
Rose Bennett: Yes. Even if you've spent fifty years by his side -- packing his lunch, pressing his work pants. Mel was my whole life. I didn't kill him. I couldn't even put him out of his misery.

CUT TO:



Catherine: So what do you think, Jim?
Brass: I don't know. You're the lab guys. What is the evidence telling you?
Grissom: Forensically, we can't prove if Mel took the digoxin overdose or if she forced it on him.
Catherine: So that leaves us with one choice.
Grissom: Equivocal evidence.
Catherine: Golden rule.
Brass: Ah. Well, &quot;when faced with evidence that can equally exonerate or implicate a suspect&quot;, we must &quot;as objective interpreters of that evidence ... side with the defendant.&quot; Tie goes to the runner.
Grissom: Rose goes free. Because we'll never be able to prove who administered the fatal dose.
Catherine:  I don't think she did it.
Brass: Okay, then. I guess I'm out of here. I'll go start my paperwork.
Catherine: See you. 

Catherine: Okay, so I was wrong. It wasn't murder. 
Grissom: It's not a contest.
Catherine: You want to go in with me? Give her the good news?
Grissom: Could you do it? I'm sorta late for a dinner.
Catherine:  Sure.
Grissom: Thanks.


CUT TO:


 
Sara: So, ladies of the wedding party, you get a free course in the forensics of sexual intercourse. Secrets of our trade. Lynn, when you had your exam for sexual assault a SART nurse makes a clock like this. 

Sara: This is the v*g1n*. 

Sara: And it does tell a monologue. Some bruising is normal when s*x occurs. Injuries at 11:00 ... 12:00 or 1:00 indicate consensual s*x or what we would call &quot;avid.&quot; Injuries around the dinner hour ... five, six, or seven, indicate forced entry. The woman hasn't done anything to help her partner thus sustaining serious bruising.
Sgt. O'Riley: Sidle, I'm going to be just outside the door.

Sara: Okay, O'Riley. Lynn ... your exam showed no evidence of s*x in the last
48 hours. Actually, in months.  But the epithelials indicate that Darren had s*x right before he and the coroner puts time of death when you've all admitted to being present. So ... Meg? Joyce? 

Sara: Look, we can run the clock exam on each of you. And the clock is going to tell us what happened. So who wants to go first?
MEG WHEELER I had s*x with Darren ... and it wasn't rape.


Meg Wheeler: Darren had been flirting with me all night. And, when it was time to leave I told the other girls to wait in the car. I know it's crazy but I thought ... I'm in Vegas. It doesn't really count.

Meg Wheeler: And ... then I don't know what happened.

Meg Wheeler:  I saw my engagement ring. 

Meg Wheeler:  Then I-I thought about Luke and how he trusts me.

Meg Wheeler: I don't think this is right.
Darren Pyne: Oh, you like it a little rough.
Meg Wheeler:  I tried to push Darren of me ...
Darren Pyne: Okay. We can do that.
Meg Wheeler:  But I-I don't think it got through.

Meg Wheeler: He wouldn't stop. 

Meg Wheeler: As soon as I hit him with the lamp, I knew.

Warrick:  So you only hit him once?

Meg Wheeler:  Mm-hmm. I didn't mean to kill him.
Sara: Meg, your engagement ring ... is that cubic zirconia? 
Meg Wheeler: No. It's a real diamond. My fiancé wanted me to have the best.
Warrick: Does your fiancé have a zirconia ring?
Meg Wheeler: Zirconia-studded. It's a promise ring. He told me to save my money ... for our honeymoon.
CUT TO:



Luke: Damaged? No. My ring is fine.
Warrick: May we see it?

Warrick: You were in that motel room that night, weren't you, Luke?
Luke: I don't know what you're talking about.
Warrick: What happened? You got wind of the party?

Luke:  Where is she?

Lynn Henry: I don't know where she is.
Joyce Lanier: Let her go!
Luke: Your husband told me you were here! Now tell me where she is!
Lynn Henry: Let go of me.
Luke: Just give me the room number. Tell me where she is.

Warrick: Bruised up Lynn's wrists.
Sara: Meg, you did have s*x with Darren the dancer. Maybe you even tried to stop in the middle of it. But something got your attention.

Meg Wheeler: I don't think this is right.

Meg Wheeler: Oh, my god! Luke.


Sara: Luke, you threw the lamp -- probably on the floor. Understandable rage.
Warrick: You did what any guy in your position would do.

Warrick: But you didn't stop with one hit.

Warrick: And you didn't know that you had lost a piece of your ring.
Sara: Except we found it.


Meg Wheeler: Honey, I'm sorry.
Luke: We just ... we just were hoping we could get married. Put it all behind us.
Warrick: Laws don't end when you come to Vegas.


CUT TO:


 
Grissom: I'm surprised. I'm having a nice time.
Teri Miller: Were you expecting a bad time?
Grissom: No. I just thought we might be uncomfortable away from work.
Teri Miller: Are you?
Grissom: No.
Teri Miller: Nor am I.
Grissom: Good.
Teri Miller: It's kind of like that old saying: &quot;How a person does one thing is ...
Grissom: ... how a person does everything.&quot;
Teri Miller: Exactly.

Grissom: Excuse me.
Teri Miller: Sure.

Teri Miller: What's going on?
Grissom:  They found two bodies in a crack den at the end of the strip. Evidently, they've been dead awhile. They need me to do an insect analysis ASAP.
Teri Miller: Oh. Well ... you are the bug guy.
Grissom: Yeah. But I asked you to postpone your flight.

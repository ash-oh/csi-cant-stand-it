<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS DESERT (STOCK) -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Thunder rumbles in the distance.) </p>
<p>[EXT. OPEN HIGHWAY – DAY]</p>
<p>(Three men speed in a red convertible on the open road. The music is on loud and the driver has an open bottle of beer in his hand. The man sitting in the seat behind the driver reaches over and holds out a joint for him to smoke from. The driver inhales and laughs loudly.) </p>
<p><strong>Drunk Driver</strong>: Hey, bro, I'm driving drunk, and you're lighting up a J? Maybe we should wait for those ... hell, dude.</p>
<p>(The man in the backseat laughs and continues smoking the joint.) </p>
<p><strong>Backseat Passenger</strong>: Man, we're in Vegas. Sweet potato Vegas! Whoo!</p>
<p>(The red convertible continues to speed along the open highway.) </p>
<p>(They come upon a large garbage truck in front of them with its back wide open. Slips of colored paper and other rubbish fly out the back.)</p>
<p>(They laugh and continue to drive fast.) </p>
<p>(Two troopers on motorcycles pull up behind them, their sirens on.) </p>
<p><strong>Passenger</strong>: Hide that! Hide it! Hide it! Get it out of here!</p>
<p>(They hide their joints.) </p>
<p>(The officers on the motorcycles continue to follow them.) </p>
<p><strong>Drunk Driver</strong>: Hey, hide that liquor! Hide the liquor! Hide it!</p>
<p><strong>Passenger</strong>: Throw that joint out!</p>
<p>(The two officers on motorcycles speed past the red convertible. They're in the clear.) </p>
<p><strong>Passenger</strong>: Get him! Get him!</p>
<p><strong>Drunk Driver</strong>: Shoot him! Shoot him!</p>
<p>[EXT. ROAD – DAY]</p>
<p>(The garbage truck driver continues to speed through a small alleyway. The sirens continue to blare behind him.) </p>
<p>(The driver continues out the other end onto a busy street. He doesn't stop. Car horns blare. He continues through the road with the officers behind him.) </p>
<p>(The CONTROL SANITATION garbage truck continues to speed along the road. The officers continue to chase after him.) </p>
<p>(The driver in the truck takes out a gun and tosses it out the window.) </p>
<p>(The driver continues through the road.) </p>
<p>(On the other side, two officer cars block his path.) </p>
<p>(The driver turns the truck and it smashes to a halt on the side of the building wall.) </p>
<p>(A DEAD BODY wrapped in torn plastic hits the pavement.) </p>
<p>(The driver gets out of the carriage, his forehead is bleeding. He starts running.)</p>
<p>(The two officers on motorcycles continue to chase after him.) </p>
<p>(The man runs.) </p>
<p><strong>Garbage Truck Driver</strong>: Get out of the way!</p>
<p>(The man continues to run. A couple of officers on foot turn the corner right behind him. The two officers on motorbikes park and get off to continue the chase on foot.) </p>
<p>(The man runs through the alley and turns the corner. He stops as two officer cars block the exit.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: (over speaker) LVPD! Hold your position! </p>
<p>(The man jumps onto the nearby fence, intending to escape over it. The officers run to him. A black car comes up the other end of the alley.) </p>
<p>(The man doesn't make it over. He jumps back down to the ground.) </p>
<p>(The black car runs straight into him, knocking him to the hard ground – dead, his blood pooling behind his head.) </p>
<p>CAMERA FLASH TO: </p>
<p>LATER: </p>
<p>(A phone rings.) </p>
<p>(Greg is snapping photos as Catherine crouches next to the body. She checks the man's shirt pocket as his phone rings.) </p>
<p>(She answers the call.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hello? Hello? </p>
<p>(She hangs up and checks the ID.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Unknown caller. No call list. Probably disposable.</p>
<p>(The SUV pulls up. Grissom gets out and heads for the scene.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Where's Warrick?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We've been calling him. There's no answer.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: See what happens when you get in a high-speed chase with a garbage truck and end up with two dead bodies.</p>
<p>(Grissom looks around.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Where's the other one?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. SIDEWALK – DAY] </p>
<p>(Brass leads Grissom, Catherine and Greg to the second body. David Phillips is with the body and writing in his clipboard.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I take it he came out of the truck?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: He flew out. At least that's what every eyewitness tells us.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, city landfill is a couple of miles down the road.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What's the TOD, David?</p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: Nine, maybe ten, hours.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I got no ID on either of the bodies. No ID on the truck. I ran the VIN number and the plates. They're not in the system. Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Control Sanitation is the only waste company in Vegas. If the garbage man works for them, his prints would be in the system.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: All right. Catherine, you and I got the bodies. Greg, since Warrick's MIA, you have a choice: the truck or the trail.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I'll go for the fresh air.</p>
<p>(Greg takes his kit and heads out.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Do I get a choice, too? Because, if you don't mind, I'm going to take the garbage man.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Be my guest.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p>(Catherine picks up her kit and leaves. Grissom sets his kit down to get to work.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CAR (MOVING) – DAY]</p>
<p>(Warrick is on the phone while driving.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (to phone) I thought I told you not to call me on this line. Maybe that's because I don't want to talk to you. (He parks.) Are you kidding me? Why don't you ask the father of your unborn child? No. That's stupid. Don't call the lawyers. Tina, don't call ... (shouts) Tina! Tina! Don't call ... Tina!</p>
<p>(Warrick hangs up and tosses the phone aside.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Damn it.</p>
<p>(Warrick opens his pill bottle and pops a pill. He gets out of the car.) </p>
<p>[EXT. SIDEWALK – DAY] </p>
<p>(Grissom is snapping photos of the body when Warrick rushes in.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey, Gris, I'm sorry I'm late. I had some business to take care of.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: This is your business. You were first up. That means you're supposed to be here first.</p>
<p>(Warrick nods. Grissom points to the garbage truck.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You get to process the trash truck.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No problem.</p>
<p>(Warrick heads to the truck.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: But get it off the street. Tow it to the impound yard.</p>
<p>(HOLD on Warrick.) </p>
<p>FADE TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[INT. CSI – FORENSIC AUTOPSY -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Catherine prints the dead body's fingerprints while David Phillips pats down the victim's coveralls. He notices the residue on his gloves.) </p>
<p><strong>David Phillips</strong>: These coveralls are brand-new.</p>
<p>(He shows the stains on his gloves to Catherine.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – FORENSIC AUTOPSY – DAY]</p>
<p>(Robbins goes over the preliminary findings with Catherine.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Your garbage man was in excellent shape. COD is as expected. Massive BFT due to his unfortunate collision with the T-bird.</p>
<p>(They turn to the next body on the second table.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: And your other vic was in his late 20s. He was definitely crushed by something.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Most likely, the garbage compactor.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Which happened postmortem.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, it's always better to be compacted dead rather than alive.</p>
<p>(Quick FLASHBACK TO: Someone tosses the plastic-wrapped body in the back of the garbage truck. The person turns it on and the back closes on the body. It crunches from the pressure. End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Suffocation. He had petechial hemorrhaging. I found white fibers in the nose and mouth. Sent them over to Hodges. He called back, confirmed they were silk.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – HALLWAY / A-V LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Nick and Grissom exit the office and head down the hallway and enter the A/V lab.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: I tried to trace garbage man's cell phone. Like we expected, it's disposable. So I tracked down the distributor. It was paid for in cash under a bogus me. But I did get an AFIS hit off his print.</p>
<p>(They stop in front of a monitor with the victim's morgue photo on it.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Brody Biggs. Former cop.</p>
<p>(He pulls up a photo of the victim when he was younger and dressed in uniform.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: When was this taken?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: 1975, police academy graduation. I contacted LVPD. They said he quit the force back in 1980 with a perfect record.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Then what?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Social came back to several different garages around town. He was a freelance mechanic for 20 years.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: All right, we got to get his personnel file. What about the other vic?</p>
<p>(Nick pulls up the EMPLOYEMENT HISTORY and photo of the second victim.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: It's Jason Crewes, 27. Got a hit off his work card. He's worked at five different casinos over the last six years.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. COMMUNITY (STOCK) – DAY] </p>
<p>[INT. CREWES RESIDENCE – FOYER -- DAY] </p>
<p>(The door opens. Nick and Catherine walk into the house. Nick picks up the phone on the table. He checks it.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, it doesn't look like Jason planned on going anywhere. I know a lot of people in this phone.</p>
<p>(Catherine takes the phone form him and looks at the contacts.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You do not. Knows some famous people. Or uses famous nicknames for his friends.</p>
<p>(They both pick up their kits and head in separate directions.) </p>
<p>[INT. CREWES RESIDENCE – HOME OFFICE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Catherine opens the door to the home office and enters. She looks at the posters on the wall:<br />
RAIN<br />
NIGHTCLUB</p>
<p>TANGERINE<br />
LOUNGE &amp; NIGHTCLUB<br />
MOONSHINE IS BACK<br />
MOONSHINE SUNDAYS<br />
NOW OPEN THURSDAYS – SUNDAYS</p>
<p>GHOSTBAR<br />
PALMS<br />
OPEN NIGHTLY </p>
<p>(Catherine turns around and looks at the framed autographed photos on the counter. The last photo is a 1995 HUX cover signed by PIPPA SANCHEZ.) </p>
<p>(Catherine goes to the desk, puts her camera down and picks up the stack of ACCESS CARDS to the various nightclubs – PURE NIGHTCLUBS, RAIN, MOON and others.) </p>
<p>(In the stack of access cards, she finds a VIP card for the SUPRENE FIGHTING CHAMPIONSHIP.) </p>
<p>[INT. CREWES RESIDENCE – LIVING ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Nick walks into the spacious room. He hears birds tweet nearby and looks at the two birds in the cage.) </p>
<p>(Nick goes to the counter and slides a bowl aside to make room for his kit. He puts his kit down and looks at the parrot in the birdcage.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Did you see anything?</p>
<p>(The parrot squawks.) </p>
<p>(Nick looks around the room. He notes the plates on the floor with half-eaten food and crumbs. There are more food and plates on the coffee table and floor nearby.) </p>
<p>(Nick turns and looks at the dark couch. He opens his kit and takes out his goggles. He puts them on and takes out his ALS. He checks the throw pillows and the couch and finds splotches of body fluid on the couch.)</p>
<p>[INT. CREWES RESIDENCE – BEDROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Catherine walks through the bedroom and stops in front of a framed photo of Jason Crews with his mother.)</p>
<p>(Catherine takes a photo of the bed. She looks at the label on the 100% SILK sheets.) </p>
<p>(She checks the covers and finds two black spots. She takes a photo of the spots.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Nick!</p>
<p>(Nick walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I think I just found ground zero. I think Jason was killed here.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [NIGHT] Brody Biggs holds the gun on Jason Crewes, who is in bed and just waking up. Brody picks up a pillow and smothers Jason Crewes. Jason fights back. End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Well, this would have been the perfect murder if Jason's body would have actually made it to the landfill. Would have been incinerated.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: At least now his mother has someone to bury.</p>
<p>(She turns and looks at the photo on the counter.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. PD – BRASS' OFFICE -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Brass talks with Jason Crewes' mother, Belinda.) </p>
<p><strong>Belinda</strong>: He was alone last night. We talked at about 3:00 in the morning. He said he got off work early and was going to bed, and he'd call me when he woke up. But he never did.</p>
<p>(Brass shows her Brody Biggs' photo.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Have you ever seen this man? His name is Brody Biggs. He's a mechanic.</p>
<p>(She shakes her head, no.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Are you sure? We think this is the man that killed your son.</p>
<p><strong>Belinda</strong>: If he's a mechanic, maybe he worked on some of Jason's limos.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I thought Jason was a club owner.</p>
<p><strong>Belinda</strong>: He was a limo driver before that, long time ago.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, couldn't be that long ago. Jason was only 27. You have to be 25 to be a limo driver.</p>
<p><strong>Belinda</strong>: He had all kinds of fake IDs. Drove his first long one at 18. The owner of the limo company liked Jason. Made him a VIP driver. Celebs liked Jason. He could take his clients to a Motel 6 and it'd be the hottest spot in town. Wasn't long before the club owners invested in Jason, made him a group partner, gave him his own spot. Then two, then five. Suddenly, he's running the whole club scene. (She starts to cry.) I guess I should say he ran the club scene. He's not going to be running anything anymore.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. STREET (GARBAGE TRUCK)-- DAY] </p>
<p>(Grissom carries a box over to the garbage truck where Warrick is sitting and reading a paper.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'll be damned. Take a look at that.</p>
<p>(Warrick hands the paper to Grissom. The headline reads, &quot;Reagan Pleads to Gorbachev: &quot;Tear Down that Wall.&quot; President Delivers Fiery Speech at Brandenberg Gate.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The good old days.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Yeah. Here's an ad for the Silver Slipper Casino -- buffet.</p>
<p>(He hands another paper to Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Back when they had real eggs, not powdered ones.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey, Gris, listen. About me being late ...</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You have a cell phone paid for by the department. You call, you say you're running late. What's going on with you?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I don't know. This, uh ... this whole divorce has taken the wind out of my sails. You know, I used to have the team to distract me from all this, but even that's changed with Sara being gone. I feel kind of disconnected.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You've got your work. Don't screw that up.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. SIDEWALK – DAY]</p>
<p>(Greg walks along the taped-off sidewalk as he looks at the spilled-out garbage on the ground.) </p>
<p>[EXT. STREET (GARBAGE TRUCK) -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Warrick continues to go through the garbage. He finds a broken vinyl record.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Van Halen, 1984.</p>
<p>(He hands the broken record to Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Either this truck was delivering merchandise for a memorabilia store or it's just plain old.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Maybe that's why Brass couldn't find the registration record.</p>
<p>(Grissom moves the box aside and looks at the license plate, NEVADA DA-80F3.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: These old blue license plates were issued in the '80s.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I don't think this truck's been on the streets since.</p>
<p>[EXT. SIDEWALK – DAY]</p>
<p>(Greg stops and steps over the crime scene tape. He takes a photo, then picks up the gun tossed by the garbage truck driver.) </p>
<p>(He looks at it and opens it.) </p>
<p>[EXT. STREET (GARBAGE TRUCK) -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Grissom walks around the side of the garbage truck and looks carefully at the CONTROL SANITATION CO logo. He peels it off and finds the truck underneath is orange.) </p>
<p>(Warrick climbs down.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I think this guy was disguising his truck. It was orange before it was green. They used to use orange garbage trucks in the '80s.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: The hydraulic cylinder blew.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: The garbage truck back hatch closes on the body. It crunches. The hydraulic cylinder blew. End flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) Maybe when he crushed the body. That's why all the garbage flew out.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI – LAB -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Greg shows Grissom and Warrick the gun.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Found this .22 in the parking lot near the crash. Check these bullets.</p>
<p>(He gives the bullets in a baggie to Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Shorts.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Usually used for shooting small animals, but in some cases they're used on people in place of a silencer. </p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV: The bullet is in the gun chamber. The gun fires. The bullet flares.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) Less gunpowder, less noise.</p>
<p>(End of CGI POV.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Look, if the garbage man had this gun, why didn't he just shoot the vic?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He found Jason sleeping. Why make a mess if you don't have to?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Sounds like a professional hit man.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, if he was, we still have to find the guy who hired him.</p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[INT. CSI – BREAK ROOM -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Warrick reports his findings with Grissom and Greg.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Traced the VIN on the garbage truck back to the Regency, the company that made it. The only model of that truck sold in Nevada was to a company called the Regal Sanitation Group. They shut down in '83.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That explains the garbage.</p>
<p>(Greg sits down.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Regal Sanitation was owned by Anthony Pezzulo. I'm studying mob history for my book.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Pezzulo? Wasn't he the mob boss who owned the Starfly?</p>
<p>CLOSE-UP: An old issue of the LAS VEGAS GLOBE. The headline reads, &quot;Pezzulo Back in Court.&quot; There's a photo of Pezzulo on the cover. </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: They called Pezzulo &quot;Whacko,&quot; not so much for his wacky personality as for his love for whacking guys.</p>
<p>INSERT: VARIOUS FLASHES of dead mob hit victims.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Until he himself got whacked at the Wisconsin Dells in 1983.</p>
<p>INSERT: Crime scene photo of Anthony Pezzulo. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Every mob-owned business in Vegas shut down when Pezzulo died.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: These scumbags lay roaches. Just when you think they're gone, they pop back up again. Somebody put a hit out on Jason. It couldn't have been Pezzulo 'cause he's been dead for 20 years.</p>

<p><strong>Belinda</strong>: I told you the truth. </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You lied about your name.</p>
<p><strong>Belinda</strong>: The feds told me to forget I ever had the Pezzulo name.</p>
<p>(Warrick is in the observation room watching the interview.) </p>
<p><strong>Belinda</strong>: I wasn't about to remember it for you. My husband had more cops than capos on his payroll.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So you went into witness protection. You changed your identity. And then you stayed in Vegas?</p>
<p><strong>Belinda</strong>: Feds felt we'd actually be safer here. They thought if we left, we might suffer the same consequences as Anthony.</p>
<p>(Grissom appears next to Warrick.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Did Jason have any mob ties?</p>
<p><strong>Belinda</strong>: Jason was three years old when Anthony died. He never even knew his father.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The last time we talked you said you didn't know Jason's killer.</p>
<p>(Brass opens a file folder and shows her a photo of younger Brody Biggs wearing his uniform.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What about this guy?</p>
<p>(She looks at the photo.) </p>
<p><strong>Belinda</strong>: That's BB.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: That's the same guy. BB is short for Brody Biggs.</p>
<p><strong>Belinda</strong>: BB didn't kill Jason. There's no way. He was Anthony's friend.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Friend? BB was driving one of your husband's old garbage trucks. Your dead son was in the back with the rest of the garbage. (She looks away.) How did BB get the truck?</p>
<p><strong>Belinda</strong>: I haven't seen BB in 23 years.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You got rid of the business. What happened to the trucks?</p>
<p><strong>Belinda</strong>: I gave that stuff to Lou Gedda.</p>
<p>(She wipes the tears form her eyes.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The owner of Pigalle Boulevard Strip Club.</p>
<p>(She nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So did Gedda and BB know each other?</p>
<p><strong>Belinda</strong>: Of course, they were both on Anthony's crew, but they would never ...</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Never what? Never kill your son and dispose of him in one of the trucks you gave him?</p>
<p>(She cries.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: When was the last time you saw Gedda?</p>
<p><strong>Belinda</strong>: (sniffles) I haven't had any contact with him since Anthony died.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So you're telling me you haven't seen or spoken to Lou Gedda in 23 years?</p>
<p><strong>Belinda</strong>: Gedda and I had an agreement. He was to keep away from our family. Forget Jason and I ever existed.</p>
<p>(Brass stands up and closes the file folder.) </p>

<p>(Warrick notes the barber's chair in the office.) </p>
<p><strong>Lou Gedda</strong>: Believe me, I don't like whores. I like dancers. When I find out they're whores, I kick them curbside.</p>

<p>(Gedda gets up and goes to the spread on the table and makes himself a sandwich.) </p>

<p><strong>Michael Raykirk</strong>: I mean, I was never more scared in my life.

Oh, here's something really cool. I left with a broken nose, some sore wrists, and some really nice bruises underneath my arms. And I just should've given him the ten grand because I paid my plastic surgeon twice that.</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I have a good feeling he works for Gedda.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, but we don't work off feelings, do we?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: According to Mr. Hollywood, Jason cost Gedda a lot of money, and he dissed him, which is more than enough for Gedda to order out a hit on someone, even if Jason is Pezzulo's son.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Any evidence? </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I ran Pigalle's address to find out if there are any more crimes linked to it over the years. I found hundreds: 416s, 413s, 411s ... the list goes on.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Any consistent suspects?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Only thing consistent is that the victims refused to file charges and the witnesses refused to give statements. And it's funny enough the cops lost interest in pursuing it.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What are you saying?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'm saying it looks like Gedda is running an old school extortion racket, and you can't do that without having cops on the payroll.</p>

<p>(She opens the trunk and grabs the duffel bag.)</p>
<p>(Warrick runs over with his gun out.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p>(Candy gasps and turns.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What's in the bag?</p>
<p><strong>Joanna &quot;Candy&quot;</strong>: All my stuff. I'm just cleaning out my locker.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Show me.</p>
<p>(She opens the duffel bag and shows him her clothes and stuff.) </p>
<p>(Warrick sighs.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Here, let me help you with that.</p>
<p>(He tucks his gun away and helps her put the duffel bag in the trunk. She closes the trunk.) </p>
<p><strong>Joanna &quot;Candy&quot;</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'm sorry.</p>
<p>(She heads back inside. Warrick rubs his eyes and heads back to his car.)</p>

<p>[INT. PIGALLE BOULEVARD STRIP CLUB – NIGHT] </p>
<p>(The girls dance on the stage while Warrick sits nearby watching. A waitress walks up to him.) </p>
<p><strong>Waitress</strong>: What can I get you tonight?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Got any Dom Perignon?</p>
<p><strong>Waitress</strong>: Mm-hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What about Cristal?</p>
<p><strong>Waitress</strong>: We do. We also have DP Rose.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I' take one of each.</p>
<p>(The waitress leaves.) </p>
<p>(Across the floor, Warrick sees Lou Gedda standing in his office looking out of the blinds.)</p>
<p>(The waitress goes to the bartender and talks with him. He nods. Warrick doesn't see the exchange.)</p>
<p>(He does note a woman in the club across the way watching him. He thinks it might be the same woman he helped earlier.) </p>
<p>(The bartender is talking on the phone. He turns and glances over at Warrick. Again, Warrick doesn't see this.) </p>
<p>(Warrick gets up and heads up the ramp toward the woman.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey ...</p>
<p>(She turns around.) </p>
<p><strong>Joanna &quot;Candy&quot;</strong>: Hey!</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I'm sorry about earlier. I thought you were carrying a dead body in there or something.</p>
<p><strong>Joanna &quot;Candy&quot;</strong>: You're a cop, right?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (smiles) I'm Warrick Brown.</p>
<p>(They shake hands.) </p>
<p><strong>Joanna &quot;Candy&quot;</strong>: I'm Candy.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Nice to meet you, Candy. So, you work here?</p>
<p><strong>Joanna &quot;Candy&quot;</strong>: Yeah. What do you want?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Everything.</p>
<p>(Across the floor, Lou Gedda watches through the blinds in his office.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
(&quot;Candy&quot; is giving Warrick a lap dance on his seat in front of the stage.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey, cheers, girl.</p>
<p>(Warrick clinks glasses with a woman off screen.) </p>
<p><strong>Girl</strong>: Cheers, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey, let's get out of here, you and me.</p>
<p>(Behind them, Grissom passes them as he looks for Warrick.) </p>
<p><strong>Joanna &quot;Candy&quot;</strong>: I'm working.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Come on, I just want to ask you a few questions.</p>
<p><strong>Joanna &quot;Candy&quot;</strong>: I don't go home with the customers.</p>
<p>(Grissom turns and finds Warrick. He taps him on his shoulder. Warrick turns.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Pay the bill and let's go. </p>
<p>(&quot;Candy&quot; leaves.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: How'd you know I was here?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You've been here twice already today. We're leaving.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Come on, Gris, why don't you sit down and have a drink with us?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm on the clock.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So am I.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So you want to get fired.</p>
<p>(Warrick stands up.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No, I want to let them know I'm here. I figured I'd order a couple bottles and not pay for it and see what happens.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You think he's that stupid?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It's worth a try.</p>
<p>(The waitress slides her tray with the bill over to him.) </p>
<p><strong>Waitress</strong>: Here you go, sir.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Thank you.</p>
<p>(He looks at the bill: COMPLIMENTS OF THE HOUSE.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (dryly) Well, now you gotta pay for it, 'cause we're not allowed to accept gifts.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. PIGALLE BOULEVARD STRIP CLUB – PARKING LOT -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Grissom and Warrick exit the club.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (sluggish) I'm good to drive, Gris, my car is right here. You gotta admit, though, the girls are pretty fine in there. Listen ... </p>
<p>(Grissom opens the car door.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Get in the cab, Warrick.</p>
<p>(Warrick doesn't want to.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: My car's right here.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (insistent) Go on.</p>
<p>(Warrick gets in the taxi.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Go home. Sleep it off. I'll see you in my office in the morning.</p>
<p>(Grissom closes the door and the taxi drives away.) </p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[EXT. PIGALLE BOULEVARD STRIP CLUB – PARKING LOT -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(A taxi pulls up in front the Pigalle. Warrick gets out. He closes the door and looks around. He sees &quot;Candy&quot; head for a taxi. She gets inside and the taxi drives away.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hey ... follow that girl.</p>
<p>(Warrick gets back inside the taxi. The taxi drives off.) </p>
<p>[INT. TAXI (MOVING) – NIGHT -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(Warrick blinks his eyes as he feels woozy.) </p>
<p>INSERT FLASH OF: The nightclub with the girls dancing on stage.</p>
<p>(Warrick sways a little.) </p>
<p>INSERT FLASH OF: A dead body wrapped in plastic and thrown away with the garbage.</p>
<p>(Warrick blinks.) </p>
<p>INSERT FLASH OF: The barber's chair in Lou Gedda's office.</p>
<p>(Warrick rubs his eyes.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. BAR – NIGHT]</p>
<p>(&quot;Candy&quot; walks into a bar. She motions to the bartender as she takes her coat off. She sits down at the bar and sighs.) </p>
<p>(Warrick walks in. The bartender puts her beer down in front of her.) </p>
<p><strong>Joanna &quot;Candy&quot;</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>(Warrick sits down next to her.) </p>
<p><strong>Joanna &quot;Candy&quot;</strong>: Cheers.</p>
<p>(She drinks.) </p>
<p><strong>Joanna &quot;Candy&quot;</strong>: You don't give up.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Not tonight. (to bartender) Irish whiskey. Neat. What's your real name, Candy?</p>
<p><strong>Joanna &quot;Candy&quot;</strong>: Joanna. Krumsky.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Joanna. I'll stick with Candy.</p>
<p>(They both laugh.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So, now that we're out of the Pigalle, you can help me out with a few questions.</p>
<p><strong>Joanna &quot;Candy&quot;</strong>: Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, anybody ever get heavy-handed with you?</p>
<p><strong>Joanna &quot;Candy&quot;</strong>: Not with me. I'm a black belt.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Nice. Not even the owner, Gedda?</p>
<p><strong>Joanna &quot;Candy&quot;</strong>: Not even him.</p>
<p>(Joanna gets up and finds a table. The bartender gives Warrick his drink.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Thanks.</p>
<p>(He takes it and follows her.) </p>
<p>(He sits down at the table with her.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: So what about the customer? They ever get beat-downs?</p>
<p><strong>Joanna &quot;Candy&quot;</strong>: When the guys get drunk and start groping the girls. That's not tolerated.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You ever see a barber's chair in Gedda's office?</p>
<p><strong>Joanna &quot;Candy&quot;</strong>: No, but I heard about one. It's supposed to be Al Capone's.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Al Capone.</p>
<p><strong>Joanna &quot;Candy&quot;</strong>: Yeah, but that has to be a rumor. Mob guy with Al Capone's chair -- it's so cliché. Gedda's like the last wise guy left in Vegas. Guess that's his way of keeping his culture alive.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Scumbags like him don't have culture.</p>
<p><strong>Joanna &quot;Candy&quot;</strong>: Scumbags like him started Vegas. None of these lights would be here if it wasn't for them.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What's a hot young thing like you doing working in a nasty place like that?</p>
<p><strong>Joanna &quot;Candy&quot;</strong>: Money. The hours. The dancing.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: How about you giving me that last dance of the evening?</p>

<p>(Warrick laughs.)</p>
<p>(He's on a white bed in a white room. Joanna is in a white blouse and standing in front of a round bathroom mirror in front of a sink where the faucets come out of the wall.) </p>
<p>(She turns around and raises a large knife at him.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (o.s.) What is it? What is it? You kidding me? </p>
<p>DISTORTED IMAGES: Warrick is holding a glass and leaning against the wall.</p>
<p><strong>Joanna &quot;Candy&quot;</strong>: (o.s.) Relax.</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>(He chuckles and laughs.) </p>
<p>(Joanna laughs.) </p>
<p>(Joanna opens her blouse and dances for him.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (o.s.) Right. Protection.</p>

<p>(He catches the blouse and smells it.) </p>
<p><strong>Joanna &quot;Candy&quot;</strong>: (o.s.) You want it? </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Come here.</p>
<p>(She unties the sarong around her waist.)</p>
<p><strong>Joanna &quot;Candy&quot;</strong>: Doesn't it smell good? Very good.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (mumbles something) </p>
<p>(Warrick is leaning against the wall.) </p>
<p><strong>Joanna &quot;Candy&quot;</strong>: (o.s.) You like trouble, don't you, big boy?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (o.s.) You-you're a trouble-troublemaker, do you know that? </p>
<p>(She's lying on the bed.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (o.s.) I like trouble.</p>
<p><strong>Joanna &quot;Candy&quot;</strong>: (o.s.) Hmm.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (o.s.) trouble ... trouble -- </p>
<p>(She licks her lips.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (mumbles) </p>
<p><strong>Joanna &quot;Candy&quot;</strong>: (o.s.) Are you scared? </p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (V.O.) Come here. Come here. Come here.</p>
<p><strong>Joanna &quot;Candy&quot;</strong>: (V.O.) What do you got for me? </p>
<p>(They kiss.) </p>

<p>(He pushes her toward the bed. They're on the bed kissing.) </p>

<p>(Warrick has his eyes closed and has a smile on his face.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (V.O.) Yeah, I feel good.</p>
<p>(She watches him, then quickly leaves.) </p>
<p><strong>Joanna &quot;Candy&quot;</strong>: (V.O.) Sweet dreams.</p>
<p>DISSOLVE OUT.</p>
<p>FLASH OF: JOANNA</p>
<p>(Her dead eyes are wide open. Her neck is bloodied and she's at an odd angle as if draped out of something, her arms stretched over her head.)</p>

<p>(The bedroom is dark and tinged green. Warrick's clothes are on the floor and several bottles are scattered around the room. Warrick is still in bed. He stirs.) </p>

[EXT. PIGALLE BOULEVARD STRIP CLUB – PARKING LOT -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Officer cars are there. It's a crime scene. The taxi pulls up and stops. Warrick reaches in his pocket for the cash and pays the driver.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Thanks. </p>
<p>(He gets out of the car and stops as he gets his bearings.) </p>
<p>WARRICK'S POV: His vision is incoherent. He sees Grissom walking over to him. </p>
<p>(Warrick walks over to the tape and starts to duck under it. The tape surrounds the area around his car. Grissom stops him.) </p>

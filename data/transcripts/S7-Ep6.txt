<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>[FADE IN: BLURRY IMAGES]</p>
<p>(Figures walk past the blinds. Sounds are still muffled. The room is tilted. The images blur out.) </p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>[FADE IN: A DARK ROOM]</p>
<p>(Blurry images continue to walk past the window. Voices of people arguing loudly are heard.)</p>
<p>FADE OUT. </p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - BRASS'S OFFICE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Grissom is lying on the couch, his eyes closed. He blinks hard, his eyes squinting and forehead contorted in pain. He hears the muffled sounds of arguing voices coming from outside the room.) </p>
<p>(He looks around the room, the lights flash and pierce his eyes.) </p>
<p><strong>Reporter (woman)</strong>: (o.s.) (clearly) There's an Amber Alert this evening in Clark County for two missing boys.</p>
<p>FLASH TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - CONFERENCE ROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Brass briefs the roomful of officers.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Okay, we have two missing criticals -- Jason Crowley, age eleven -- black, male, four-foot-six; Lucas Hanson -- age ten, Caucasian, male, five feet. Now, uh, the boys were last seen at this location at 15:30 hours -- Jason Crowley's house. Jason lives with his grandfather, Terrance Crowley. The address is on your handouts. Terrance Crowley assumed that they were staying at Lucas's house. Dawn Hanson, Lucas's mother, returned home from work at 21:00 hours. She assumed they were at Terrance Crowley's house. She reported them missing at 24:00 hours. Now, we searched the schools, playgrounds, basketball courts. Found nothing. Canine is on the scene. Neither of the boys carried cell phones or pagers. Now, any questions?</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Boys ever run away before?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No, and, uh, we interviewed the teachers at the school, and according to them, they're both good kids.</p>
<p>(Grissom's cell phone beeps; he checks it.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer 2</strong>: (o.s.) Any, uh, distinguishing features or marks?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, as you can see, Jason wears glasses, but that's it. Yeah?</p>
<p>(Grissom's message reads:<br />
MY 204 MIGHT BE YOUR 418. NICK )</p>
<p>(Grissom gets up and slips out of the room.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer 3</strong>: (o.s.) Did Amber Alerts go out to any other states?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Amber Alerts have gone out to the states of Utah, California ...</p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO: </p>
<p>[EXT. ARSON SITE (FISHER RESIDENCE) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Grissom walks up the front drive. The fire is out. The area is taped off with emergency personnel at the scene. Grissom walks up to Nick, who is looking at a car parked in the driveway.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Okay, so what does your arson have to do with my missing kids?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Upon initial search of the premises, farmer located one adult male unconscious on the living room floor. His name's Carl Fisher. Paramedics have him on the bumper now. Once he came around, he started claiming every time there's an Amber Alert, somebody tries to kill him.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Child molester.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Tier Two, by his own admission.</p>
<p>(Grissom seems surprised. He heads over toward Carl Fisher, who is sitting on the back of the ambulance, the paramedics finished with him.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Excuse me, Mr. Fisher? </p>
<p>(Carl Fisher looks at Grissom. He's dirty and looking exhausted.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: My name's Gil Grissom. I'm with the Crime Lab. What happened to your shoes?</p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: They're in the house. I was asleep.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Are you familiar with the names Lucas Hanson or Jason Crowley?</p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: The kids from the Amber Alert? No, sir. I'm a convicted pedophile. That would be a violation of my parole.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Which is it -- boys or girls?</p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: Boys. Pre-teen. I know what you're thinking.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No, you don't.</p>

<p>FADE IN: </p>
<p>[INT. FISHER RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT -- FLASHBACK] </p>
<p>(Carl Fisher is on the couch, the flames of the fire in the living room. He coughs and looks around.) </p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: (V.O.) Don't know what woke me up, the smoke or the fire.</p>
<p>(He looks at his cell phone on the floor and reaches for it with his left hand. It's too hot for him to pick up.)</p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: Ahh!</p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p>[INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Carl Fisher is in a gown talking with Brass as Grissom picks up his camera.) </p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: Next thing I remember, I was outside, looking up at the paramedics.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hold out your hands, please.</p>
<p>(Grissom snaps photos of Carl Fisher's hands. His left hand is more burned than his right.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Turn them over.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So, uh, can you account for your whereabouts the last 24 hours?</p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: I worked from 6:00 until 2:00 p.m., and then I went straight home.</p>
<p>(Grissom snaps photos of the blisters on Carl's back.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Where do you work?</p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: At the feed lot off Highway 111. I've got a Masters in English Literature. I used to teach high school.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Let me guess -- the kids loved you.</p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: Someone set fire to my house. I almost died. Why don't you ask me about that?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Okay. Who would want to barbecue you?</p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: My neighbors make it clear every day how they feel about me. I would start with Mr. Hamilton. He threw a rock through my window a few months back when a little girl went missing. Hamilton ... he barely finished high school. He has a lot of displaced anger. </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hmm. </p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: You're not writing any of this down.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I have a good memory.</p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: Listen, I've called you guys half a dozen times in the past two years. I've had my house graffitied, my windows broken, my tires slashed.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, you know, Carl - (he sighs) -- sometimes bad things happen to bad people. (Grissom stops and looks at Brass. He doesn't say anything.) But I'll tell you what -- I'll let you file a formal complaint down at the police station.</p>
<p>(Brass's phone rings; he checks his message. It reads:<br />
FROM: L.V.P.D.<br />
DAWN HANSON WAITING IN RECEPTION FOR YOU. )</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I got to go. You all right here?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I'm almost done.</p>
<p>(Brass leaves. Grissom continues working.) </p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: I've been living right the past five years since I got out of prison. I haven't gone near a child. I go to a support group every week. I've even lectured social workers on how to recognize sexual predators. Ask my parole officer.</p>
<p>(Grissom doesn't say anything. He continues working.) </p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: (frustrated) Doesn't that count for something?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I don't know. But it doesn't change anything, does it?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[TELEVISION MONITOR] </p>
<p><strong>Paula Francis (news Reporter)</strong>: (on tv) Police have no new clues in the disappearance of ten-year-old Lucas Hanson and 11-year-old Jason Crowley.</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - WAITING ROOM - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Dawn Hanson sits in the waiting room waiting for Brass.) </p>
<p><strong>Paula Francis (news Reporter)</strong>: (on tv) Teachers and classmates are planning a six p.m. vigil at Rockwater Elementary ...</p>
<p>(Brass walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Mrs. Hanson, I got your message. You said it was urgent.</p>
<p><strong>Dawn Hanson</strong>: You told me to go home and look around. That's what I did. My ex took 'em.</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - BRASS' OFFICE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Brass looks at the empty hide-away key container.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Ms. Hanson, I thought you told me that your ex-husband wasn't involved in Lucas's life.</p>
<p><strong>Dawn Hanson</strong>: He doesn't care about Lucas. He barely uses his visitation, and then, six months ago, I don't know, he-he got into some kind of trouble. He started coming around when Lucas was home alone. He'd gone through my mail, my checkbook. He-He stole our TVs.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [EXT. HANSON RESIDENCE - FRONT - DAY] Perry Hanson carries a television set down the front walk as Lucas and Jason Crowley follow.) </p>
<p><strong>Lucas Hanson</strong>: Daddy, please. Mama said she's gonna call the cops. Put it back.</p>
<p>(Perry Hanson drops the television set into the back of his convertible.) </p>
<p><strong>Perry Hanson</strong>: Your mom can do whatever she wants. I paid for this. It's mine.</p>
<p>(He gets in the car and leaves the two kids staring at him.) </p>
<p>(End of flashback.) </p>
<p><strong>Dawn Hanson</strong>: So I told Lucas that he couldn't be home alone anymore, and I took his key.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You locked your son out of his own house?</p>
<p><strong>Dawn Hanson</strong>: I made arrangements with Jason's grandpa. The hide-a-key is for emergencies only.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So it's possible that Lucas took the key.</p>
<p><strong>Dawn Hanson</strong>: (voice breaking) Lucas ... Lucas always drops his book bag in the hallway and turns on the TV. I bought him a new one. I'm positive he didn't come home.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Okay, all right, all right. Give me an address for your ex-husband.</p>
<p><strong>Dawn Hanson</strong>: 225-IHG.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: That sounds like a license plate.</p>
<p><strong>Dawn Hanson</strong>: Yeah, well, he moves around a lot. Practically lives out of his car. He ... He runs a stripper circuit on I-15.</p>
<p>(Brass puts a mug photo of Carl Fisher on the desk and points to it.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Have you ever seen this man?</p>
<p><strong>Dawn Hanson</strong>: No. Why? </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Uh, he's a person of interest.</p>
<p>(Brass turns to make the call.) </p>
<p><strong>Dawn Hanson</strong>: (interrupts, affronted) Lucas knows better than that. You don't talk to strangers.</p>
<p>(Brass holds up a hand as he makes the call.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (to intercom) Ah, it's okay. Uh, yeah. Put out a broadcast on Perry Hanson.</p>

[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY SUBURBAN COMMUNITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>
<p>[INT. CROWLEY RESIDENCE - JASON'S BEDROOM - DAY]</p>
<p>(Sofia talks with Terrance Crowley as Catherine snaps photos of the residence.) </p>
<p><strong>Terrence Crowley</strong>: Look, Jason and Lucas probably just ran away. They're at that age. You know what I'm saying?</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Well, kids with no money and no place to go usually come home quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Terrence Crowley</strong>: Do you know how hard it would be to catch them? Lucas is a big boy. And Jason ... (chuckles) Jason is fast.</p>
<p>(Catherine sees two backpacks against the bedside table.) </p>
<p><strong>Terrence Crowley</strong>: The red one is Jason's.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Your grandson's into sports, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Terrence Crowley</strong>: Yeah, you'd think. Plays them damn video games. That's all he wants to do. I told him I don't allow that stuff in my house. Boys need fresh air and sunshine.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Uh, we haven't been able to reach Jason's father. Have you spoken to him?</p>
<p><strong>Terrence Crowley</strong>: You know, my son fell apart when his wife died. Quit his job. I was basically taking care of both of them. And then he got a great opportunity in Houston. Couldn't get Jason into a school until next semester, so I said I'd keep him until then.</p>
<p>(A dog barks outside. Terrance Crowley turns and looks out the window. Sofia notices he's got a tooth missing.) </p>
<p><strong>Terrence Crowley</strong>: How do those dogs find people?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Just like the movies, they sniff them out.</p>
<p><strong>Terrence Crowley</strong>: Bet it's expensive, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You worried about the money?</p>
<p><strong>Terrence Crowley</strong>: Let me tell you something. Boys are gonna walk right in here just like that runaway bride. And you people are gonna be handing me a bill for all the looking, you watch.</p>

[EXT. FISHER RESIDENCE - FRONT -- DAY] </p>
<p>(Nick is holding a hand-sized device and is testing the car hood. The meter beeps at regular intervals. Greg turns the corner of the house and walks over to Nick.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I talked with the neighbors. A Mrs. Hamilton says she walked her dogs around 6:00 last night. She saw Carl watering his outside plants. He was alone. She also said that after dark, everyone locks up their doors, and the kids stay inside.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: And let me guess. Nobody saw or heard anything, right?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Right.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Right.</p>
<p>(Nick turns the hand-held reader off.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: What do you got?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Based on the burn pattern, the origin of the fire was definitely here. I detected an accelerant on the front of the car, and on the ground, both consistent with gasoline. Now, the back seat's still intact, so I figure the fire jumped from the car to the house and fast.</p>
<p>INSERT: FLASHBACK</p>
<p>(Someone lights the car. The house catches on fire.)</p>
<p>BACK TO SCENE.</p>
<p>(Nick walks over to the prints on the concrete marked by evidence markers and rulers.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Check this out.</p>
<p>(Greg kneels down and looks at the prints.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Full shoe impression on the concrete.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Someone stepped in the accelerant before the car was lit.</p>
<p>INSERT: FLASHBACK</p>
<p>(As someone leaves, they step in a puddle of gasoline and trail a wet shoeprint behind. It burns an impression into the concrete.)</p>
<p>BACK TO SCENE.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Treads lead toward the street. Could've been a neighbor.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Could've been anybody.</p>
<p>[INT. FISHER RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Meanwhile Sara snaps photos of a pair of shoes inside the house next to evidence marker #1. She picks it up and looks at it. She puts it in a container.) </p>
<p>(Sara looks around. She notices the burned stack of video games and video equipment. She snaps photos of it. She snaps photos of the burned video games on the living room floor.) </p>
<p>(Warrick walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, so far, the only prints I found in the bedroom are Carl Fisher's. No semen stains in the bed. And nothing to indicate children.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Well, there's tons of these.</p>
<p>(She picks up the burned comic books.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What's that?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: 'Spencer's Last Straw,' 'Wiz Kids,' 'Mayhem and McCabe,' 'Secret City.'<br />
Guy lives in a trailer. He drives an old Mercury. He has a ton of expensive DVDs and video games. There's gummi bears and chips on the floor. House might as well be made out of gingerbread.</p>

<p>(A blue convertible, license #225-IHG, is stopped by the side of the road. Brass and a couple of officers head toward the vehicle.) </p>
<p>(Perry Hanson and a blonde stripper lean back against the side of the car.) </p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: Vehicle matched the description. Went to pull him over, he tried to split on us.</p>
<p>(Brass looks at the driver's license.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Perry Hanson? So, Mr. Hanson, where are the boys?</p>
<p><strong>Perry Hanson</strong>: Which boys?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Lucas and Jason.</p>
<p><strong>Perry Hanson</strong>: My kid, Lucas? What, did he ditch school or something?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: No, he's missing, and so is his best friend. You mean, you didn't hear the Amber Alert, or check your messages?</p>
<p><strong>Stripper</strong>: You don't have to talk to him, okay, Perry? (to Brass) See, I know the frickin' Constitution.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I bet you do. Somebody get Ben Franklin out of here.</p>
<p>(Officer Mitchell grabs the stripper's arm and pulls her away.)</p>
<p><strong>Officer Mitchell</strong>: Yes, sir. Ma'am.</p>
<p><strong>Stripper</strong>: Don't ...</p>
<p>(She grumbles all the way.) </p>
<p><strong>Stripper</strong>: You didn't have to cuff us, you know? It's not like we're frickin' terrorists.</p>
<p><strong>Officer Mitchell</strong>: Put her in the car -- </p>
<p>(The officers put the stripper in the car.) </p>
<p>(Brass, meanwhile, looks in the car and notices the open glove compartment. He sees a key. He picks it up and looks at it.)</p>
<p>(He then checks out the back seat and finds a baseball glove. He takes out a handkerchief and picks up the baseball glove. It has JASON CROWLEY'S name on it.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: You want to tell me what Jason Crowley's baseball glove is doing in your car?</p>
<p><strong>Perry Hanson</strong>: (shrugs) Lucas must've left it there. I don't know, man, kids are always taking each other's crap.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Got something here.</p>
<p>(Catherine finds a piece of khaki material caught in the wire fence. She picks it.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Lucas was last seen wearing khaki-colored board shorts.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: I've had calls here before. A lot of these houses are vacant.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Perfect place for a little privacy.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: (to the officers) Okay, let's get around this fence.</p>

<p><strong>Perry Hanson</strong>: Day I left -- I've never been back.</p>
<p>(Brass shows a photo of the key.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I found this in your car. Guess whose front door it opens?</p>
<p><strong>Perry Hanson</strong>: Look ... my ex will hardly even let me see my kid. You know, not until I pay up on the vaginamony that I owe. And that's illegal. She doesn't care. Yesterday, I-I just wanted to see my boy. You know? So I went over there and he wasn't home. I guess I forgot to leave the key.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Another sad, suffering single dad.</p>
<p><strong>Perry Hanson</strong>: You better find my kid. And if I were you, I'd start with Dawn's boyfriends.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (scoffs) Oh, if you were me.</p>

<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Remember those dogs ... you were so interested in? Well, they led us to an abandoned house, not far from where you live, and that's where we found your teeth. We also found physical evidence -- blood evidence -- that tells us that your grandson and Lucas --</p>

<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Why didn't you tell us this before?</p>
<p><strong>Terrence Crowley</strong>: I told you what was important, lady. Now those boys are going to be fine. What they're trying to do, they're trying to punish me. That's what they're trying to do. And you'll see, they'll be back. And then I will sit down and I will talk to Jason. Now, what about my teeth?</p>

<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Or worse.</p>

<p>(Grissom doesn't say anything. He heads over to Greg.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What have you found?</p>

<p>(The plastic melts and traps the liquid inside.)</p>
<p>BACK TO SCENE.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: And if Hodges can isolate any unique compounds from the gas, you know, like, gas DNA.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Gasoline comparisons are only credible if you have pure samples. Otherwise, there's too many variables.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: I know that, Grissom. What I've extracted was never exposed directly to the fire. So, if we can identify either a dye, or a unique compound, and match to a particular station, then we might be able to prove whether Carl set the fire.</p>

<p>(The woman is holding the MISSING flyer.) </p>
<p><strong>Female Passenger</strong>: He was definitely by himself. I saw this; I knew it was him.</p>
<p><strong>Bus Driver</strong>: I radioed my dispatcher. She told me to pull over at the next town, make sure he doesn't get off, and wait for you. </p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Thank you for your help. (to the woman) Can you tell me where he's sitting?</p>
<p><strong>Female Passenger</strong>: Back row.</p>
<p>(Sofia steps into the bus.) </p>
<p>[INT. BUS (PARKED) - DAY - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(Sofia heads for the back row. Jason peeks out from the seat he's hiding behind. Sofia takes her dark glasses off and sits in the seat across the aisle from where Jason is hiding.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Hey. My name's Sofia. Are you Jason?</p>
<p>(Jason doesn't say anything.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: There's nothing to be afraid of, Jason. You're not in trouble. I just want to help you. You're on your way to Texas to see your dad, right? It's just ... well, when you went missing, your dad flew to Las Vegas to find you. He's waiting for you. Can I take you to him?</p>
<p>(She holds out his hand. Jason takes it.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: (V.O.) Is that the tox report for Lucas Hanson?</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - HALLWAY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Nick and Warrick walk through the hallway. Nick hands the report printout to Warrick.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: His blood alcohol -- point one six.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Geezus. It's a drunk kid.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: And Sara found a whiskey cap in Carl Fisher's car.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Oh, perfect way to loosen up a little boy -- give him pizza and whiskey.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah, well, listen to this. According to the report, Lucas also had 98 micrograms per milliliter of salicylates in his system.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, I guess he took the aspirin after he hit his head.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Wonder who gave him that.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Probably the same responsible adult that gave him the whiskey.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM --NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Grissom looks exhausted. He rubs his temple with the tips of his fingers as he listens to Carl.) </p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: So, you think I got the boys drunk, and then killed them?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Not exactly. We found Jason Crowley. Alive. On a bus headed for Houston.</p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: One of the lucky ones.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - WAITING ROOM -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Gerald Crowley sits in the waiting room. Sofia walks in with Jason. Gerald gets to his feet, then kneels to hug Jason.) </p>
<p><strong>Gerald Crowley</strong>: It's okay, Jason. Daddy's here, boy. Daddy's here.</p>
<p>(Sofia stands on the side watching them.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM --NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Grissom talks with Carl Fisher.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That bus ticket costs $95 for a child under twelve. Jason's grandfather doesn't keep any cash in the house, and he doesn't give him an allowance, so where do you think Jason got the cash?</p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: Maybe he stole it.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: From whom?</p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: I don't know. Why don't you ask him? GRISSOM: I will.</p>
<p>(Grissom stops for a moment and closes his eyes. He's still got his headache pain. Carl notices.) </p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: Do you get a lot of migraines, Gil? You should ask your doctor for a prescription of sumatriptan. Works for me.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Captain Brass wants to put you in a lineup. If you'll agree to it, then I think this will all be over with.</p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: Then let's do it.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[LINE UP]</p>
<p>(Jason stands in the observation room looking at a line-up of similar men in body building and coloring to Carl Fisher. Jason's father, Gerald, is in the room standing behind Jason.) </p>
<p>(The lights switch on.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Do you recognize anyone, Jason?</p>
<p>(Jason nods.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Which number?</p>
<p>(Jason points to Carl Fisher.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Number two?</p>
<p><strong>Jason Crowley</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Was he the man who kidnapped you and Lucas?</p>
<p>(Jason shakes his head.) </p>
<p><strong>Sofia</strong>: Jason, remember, you can see him, but he can't see you. Did number two hurt Lucas?</p>
<p><strong>Voice</strong>: (v.o., distant, distorted) I'll kill your dad if you tell ...</p>
<p><strong>Jason Crowley</strong>: No, ma'am.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Sofia walks Jason and Gerald through the hallway. Grissom steps out toward them and she shakes her head at him, no.) </p>
<p>(They turn and leave.)</p>
<p>(Greg enters the hallway. He hands Grissom the folder.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: The gas DNA panned out.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (surprised) It did?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Yeah. Hodges and I traced the gas back to a service station near Fisher's house. Station had security cameras. Got him filling up the night of the fire, so I went through the electronic receipts. All of them. Carl Fisher purchased 16 gallons.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: His Mercury Marquis only holds 14, so, where did he put the extra two gallons?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: In a plastic gas can?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: All which he paid for with his ATM.</p>
<p>(Greg hands the ATM receipt to Grissom.) </p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Not the same as cash.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Thanks, Greg.</p>
<p>(Grissom turns and walks down the hallway, back to the interview room.) </p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - HOLDING CELL --NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Grissom talks with Carl Fisher.) </p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: No one has told me why I'm being detained.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Arson is a felony. You torched your own car. We have video surveillance and electronic records that show you purchasing gas and a gas can.</p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: I was trying to scam my insurance company. I needed the money.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You were destroying evidence of Lucas Hanson and Jason Crowley in your car. And I think you helped kill Lucas.</p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: No, I didn't. And you're not charging me for that, so I'm guessing Jason didn't pick me out of the lineup.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He told us he knew you. Kill one, kill both, remember? </p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: If I had killed Lucas, I would have killed Jason.</p>
<p>(Grissom doesn't believe him. Carl sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: Lucas was looking for a father. His real one was an accident of biology. His mother was limited, always working. He was lonely. He found me.</p>
<p>INSERT: FLASHBACK</p>
<p>[EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY - FLASHBACK]</p>
<p>(Carl is walking down the sidewalk bouncing his basketball. He's sweaty and just finished with a workout.) </p>
<p><strong>Lucas Hanson</strong>: (o.s.) I see you every day. You play a lot, huh? Maybe we can play sometime.</p>
<p>(Carl turns and looks at Lucas.) </p>
<p><strong>Lucas Hanson</strong>: My best friend's always grounded. How about tomorrow?</p>
<p>(Carl turns and tosses the basketball to Lucas.) </p>
<p>BACK TO SCENE.</p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: Did you know that most parents spend less than twenty minutes a day of quality time with their kids? Lucas was starved for attention. All his mother did was complain about his father and how he'd abandoned them. Do you know what that does to a child?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It doesn't kill them.</p>
<p>(Carl doesn't say anything.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Okay, Carl, just tell me what happened.</p>
<p>(Carl sighs.)</p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: Lucas and Jason had gotten into it with Jason's grandfather. He knocked the boys around. They ran to Lucas' house, but couldn't get in, so they came to me.</p>
<p>INSERT: FLASHBACK </p>
<p>[INT. FISHER RESIDENCE - LIVING ROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK]</p>
<p>(Carl Fisher sits in his living room when there's a knock at his door.) </p>
<p>(He finds Lucas and Jason standing outside.) </p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: Come on in, guys.</p>
<p>(He lets them in.) </p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: (V.O.) I explained to them that hitting wasn't okay.</p>
<p>BACK TO SCENE.</p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: I said Jason needed to call his father and tell him what was going on.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Did you let them use your phone?</p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: But they were too upset. When the grandfather pushed Lucas, he hit his head. I gave him a couple of aspirin.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Well, if he didn't want to call his mother, why didn't you call her?</p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: I couldn't risk it. She might have turned me in.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So, instead, you took them for pizza?</p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: I didn't touch him. I didn't want to hurt him.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You gave him liquor.</p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: I stopped and bought some whiskey before we picked up the pizza--<br />
I was nervous about them being in the car with me. I didn't want to go back to prison.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And you wanted to get them drunk.</p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: They ... they just wanted to try it. I gave them a taste.</p>
<p>INSERT: FLASHBACK</p>
<p>[INT. CAR (PARKED) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Carl gives Lucas some whiskey as Jason sits in the back seat of the car eating pizza.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) It was more than a taste, Carl. Lucas' blood alcohol level was point one six. That's twice the legal limit for an adult. </p>
<p>BACK TO SCENE.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Why didn't you take them home?</p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: They didn't want to go home. They wanted an adventure. I promised them a dollar for every golf ball they brought back. </p>
<p>INSERT: FLASHBACK</p>
<p>[EXT. GOLF COURSE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(The car pulls up to the golf course.) </p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: (V.O.) Lucas wasn't feeling well, so he stayed in the car with me.</p>
<p>(Jason gets out of the car. Lucas is in the car with Carl. His eyes are closed. Jason heads for the golf course.) </p>
<p>BACK TO SCENE.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And you knew that Jason wanted money, so he could go to Texas and see his dad, so you bribed him in order to be alone with Lucas.</p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: I didn't molest him.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Who took his shirt off?</p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: He was hot.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What were you gonna do to him once his shirt was off?</p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: It was innocent. He wasn't feeling well. He laid his head in my lap. I touched his hair. I didn't want to ... I loved him. I loved Lucas, and he loved me.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Is that what you think? Then why didn't you help him? He told you he hit his head. He was in pain. He had a concussion, Carl. You must have known that. I'm sure he was dizzy, probably had no appetite. Maybe he was even slurring his words, but you didn't care about that, because you wanted what you wanted.</p>
<p>INSERT: FLASHBACK</p>
<p>[INT. CAR - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Carl helps take Lucas' shirt off as he shivers.) . Lucas puts his head on Carl's lap.) </p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: Lucas?! Lucas!</p>
<p>(Cut to: Lucas is flat on the asphalt outside as Carl tries to help him.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) His brain was bleeding. </p>
<p>BACK TO SCENE.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Now, most kids won't die from that, because someone who really loves them takes them to the hospital, but instead, you gave him alcohol and aspirin, a lethal combination for his head injury. It prevented his blood from clotting. You killed him, Carl. </p>
<p>INSERT: FLASHBACK</p>
<p>[EXT. GOLF COURSE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(Carl is over Lucas's dead body. Jason returns, his shirt full of golf balls. He sees Lucas dead and drops the golf balls.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) And you would have killed Jason, too, except he ran away from you and out of your reach.</p>
<p>(Jason turns and runs.) </p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: Jason -- </p>
<p>(Jason runs and crawls into a drain pipe.) </p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: Jason!</p>
<p>(Carl runs and finds Jason in the drain pipe.) </p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: Hey, what are you doing in there?</p>
<p>BACK TO SCENE.</p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: You're not listening to me. I didn't want to hurt anyone. I need you to believe me.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I don't. You had choices. You made the wrong ones. And now this little boy is gone.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY LIGHTS (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Grissom and Brass talk in the hallway in front of his office door.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: So I talked Voris into violating parole, and we're adding the charges of negligent homicide. You're not gonna see Carl for a long time. </p>
<p>(Officer Mitchell turns the corner with Carl Fisher in handcuffs.) </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Also, we, uh ... we've arrested the grandpa, Terrance Crowley, for child abuse.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Everybody wins.</p>
<p>(Brass shrugs.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Except Lucas.</p>
<p>(Officer Metcalf turns the corner with Terrance Crowley in handcuffs. The two men cross in the hallway.) </p>
<p><strong>Terrence Crowley</strong>: (hisses to Carl) You're gonna fry.</p>
<p>(Carl lunges at Terrance.) </p>
<p><strong>Carl Fisher</strong>: You drove him right to me, you b*st*rd! You did this! You did this! </p>
<p><strong>Terrence Crowley</strong>: I'll kill you!</p>
<p>(Officers pull the two men apart. Brass rushes over to join them.) </p>
<p>(Grissom turns when he hears more arguing in the hallway adjacent to him. Margaret Finn and Brad Lewis, the two lawyers, argue with an officer. Their voices echo and get distorted from the pain in his head.) </p>
<p><strong>Margaret Finn</strong>: Where is Carl Fisher? You can't take him to County ...</p>
<p><strong>Brad Lewis</strong>: Mr. Crowley's civil rights were violated. This department is racist.</p>
<p><strong>Margaret Finn</strong>: Excuse me! I was here first. My client has been detained illegally.</p>
<p>(Grissom slips into Brass's office.) </p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - BRASS'S OFFICE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(He closes the blinds. The voices outside echo as the arguing continues.) </p>
<p><strong>Brad Lewis</strong>: You cannot charge Mister ...</p>
<p>(Grissom turns and makes his way over to the couch. He sits down, exhausted. He closes his eyes from the pain in his head, then lies back, his head on the armrest.)</p>
<p>(He sighs and squeezes his eyes closed.)</p>
<p>(The arguing outside continues. The blurry images from the teaser are repeated here.)</p>
<p>(Light filters in through the blinds. Muffled sounds are heard.) </p>
<p>(Figures walk past the blinds. Sounds are still muffled. The room is tilted.) </p>
<p>(Grissom squeezes his eyes closed. The arguing outside continues.) </p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK.</p>

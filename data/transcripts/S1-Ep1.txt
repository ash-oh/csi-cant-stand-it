CUT TO:



Royce Harmon :  I'd like to say &quot;I love you&quot; to my mother Paige and my sister Gina. I'm so sorry. I never wanted to put you through this. I just can't do it anymore. 

Royce Harmon :  I love you, mom ...
Sound:  Gunshot.
HARD CUT TO:


(Cop cars surround the area. OFFICERS and curious onlookers mill about. The drive way is cordoned off by crime scene tape.



Sergeant O'Riley: Here comes the &quot;nerd squad&quot;.

Jim Brass: I hate the legwork. I'm telling you, that Deputy Chief job better come in soon. I don't know how much longer I can put up with these damn &quot;public appearances&quot;.

Gil Grissom:  Gentlemen ...
Jim Brass: Hey, guys, take a break, huh?

CUT TO:



Jim Brass: Suicide.
Gil Grissom: You think so, huh?
Jim Brass: You got the sleeping bag for easy cleanup, the bathtub to catch the bullet, open window so the stench alerts the neighbors ... god bless him.

Jim Brass: Oh, geez ...


Gil Grissom: Pupa, stage three.
Jim Brass: English. I'm not an entomologist.
Gil Grissom: It's the third stage of larva metamorphosis. This guy's been dead seven days. 

Jim Brass: That's a maggot, and he stinks. Oh, good, it's almost 11:00. Maybe if I'm lucky I can break out of here in time for a shot at the first rack of the Krispy Kreme.

Gil Grissom: I think we may have our suicide note.

Royce Harmon:  I never wanted to put you through this. I just can't do it anymore. I've lost hope. I love you, mom ...

Holly Gribbs: Hello?

Gil Grissom: Hi.

Gil Grissom: Sorry. Welcome to Forensics. Gil Grissom. I'm your supervisor on graveyard.
Holly Gribbs: Holly Gribbs. 

Holly Gribbs: Nice office.
Gil Grissom: Thanks.  Would you mind taking off your jacket and rolling up your sleeve?
Holly Gribbs: For what? 
Gil Grissom: I need a pint of your blood. It's customary for all new hires.
Holly Gribbs: Why?
Gil Grissom:  So many reasons.

Holly Gribbs: I-I haven't even clocked in yet.
CUT TO:




Nick Stokes:  One more, baby, one more.

Warrick Brown: Hey.
Nick Stokes: There he is. What's up?

Warrick Brown: Ninety-nine. You and me, dead heat. Next crime solved gets promoted to CSI-3, man.
Nick Stokes: Yeah, yeah, choice of shift, $8,000 raise, extra week vacation--  oh-ho, it's all about Cabo, bro.
Warrick Brown: Twenty bucks, by the end of shift, I'm the man.
Nick Stokes: Is there anything you won't bet on?
Warrick Brown: Nah. It's college football season, man. I won eight of ten this weekend. Kilt 'em. Outside the Huskers and them punk-ass Irish, I'm up about four G's.
Nick Stokes: Hmm, what's the line on us?
Warrick Brown: On us? I'm like tiger,, man -- I'm heavily favored
Nick Stokes: Come on, give me a winner for tomorrow.
Warrick Brown:  Ah ... green bay, minus seven and a half over niners. Always go with the better quarterback.
Nick Stokes: Uh-huh. Cool. 

Nick Stokes: Hey, good luck tonight, man.

Warrick Brown: Thanks. You, too, Nick. I hope you get that trick and roll. You'll never crack that in a shift, never.

Nick Stokes:  Yeah, well, we'll see, and I hope the pack wins by seven.
CUT TO:



Gil Grissom: We scrutinize the crime scene, collect the evidence recreate what happened without ever having been there. 

Gil Grissom: Pretty cool, actually.
Holly Gribbs: I just got out of the academy -- I already know this.
Gil Grissom: Of course you do. Then if you'll just sign these waivers for personal injury or death while in the line of duty, we can begin our shift.

Holly Gribbs: Mmm...
Gil Grissom: What's the matter?
Holly Gribbs: Um ... I'm kind of light-headed.
Gil Grissom: Sit down, sit down. You're probably low on blood sugar. I've got just the thing.


Gil Grissom: Here, try one of these.
Holly Gribbs: No offense, but I don't think I want to eat anything that's been in this office.

Holly Gribbs: Is there a grasshopper in here?

CUT TO:

 

Jim Brass: When we get some free time, try and catch up on your reports. I'm getting a lot of heat from the sheriff's office. There, I said it. Administration, not my favorite thing. All right, here we go. Nick Stokes, 414, trick roll. Victim found drugged and robbed at the scene. 

Jim Brass: Warrick Brown, 407, home invasion, forced entry. Person reporting crime fired multiple rounds at the suspect. Suspect's condition is ...  ... unknown. Anyone seen Catherine Willows?
CUT TO:



(Cut to: CATHERINE opens the car sliding door. Inside belted in the back seat is LINDSEY WILLOWS.
Catherine Willows: Okay, give me a kiss. Mommy's got to go catch some bad guys.

Catherine Willows:  I'll pick her up in the morning.
Catherine's Sister: Okay.
Catherine Willows: Bye, sis.
Catherine's Sister: Bye.
Catherine Willows:  I love you!

CUT TO:



Jim Brass: So your mother is Lieutenant Jane Gribbs from Traffic, is that right?
Holly Gribbs:  Yes, sir. 
Jim Brass: Well, Congratulations, Gribbs. 

Jim Brass: You're the fifth person I've been forced to hire. We're the number two crime lab in the country. We solve crimes most labs render unsolvable. Now what makes you think you belong here?

Holly Gribbs: Sir, with all due respect I thought the key to being a lucid crime scene investigator was to reserve judgment until the evidence vindicates or eliminates assumption. 

Holly Gribbs: You're prejudging me. I graduated with honors in criminal justice at UNLV.
Jim Brass:  Yeah, so?
Holly Gribbs: That's not fair.
Jim Brass: Fair? Well, you think putting a juiced-in Lieutenant's daughter on this shift is fair? You know, I've been in the field 22 years. I've seen it all. I've seen people like you come and go, and you know what? They don't amount to nothing but headaches and bad press. Dismissed.

Holly Gribbs: Fine.

Gil Grissom: Think you got through to her?
Jim Brass: You're scheduled to appear at an autopsy at 12:30 A.M. 

Jim Brass: They're cutting up that bozo put a hole in his chest. Take her with. I think every new hire should experience an autopsy on their first night.

CUT TO:






Wife: It's okay, shh.
Catherine Willows: Ma'am ... are you all right?
Husband: She's fine. She's just a little shook up is all.
Warrick Brown: Somebody want to tell us what happened here tonight?
Husband: My wife invited her drunk friend to stay here so he could get back on his feet. Two weeks tops, she says. That was six months ago.

Husband: Jimmy, Jimmy! Please take your sweaty feet off the head pillow. They stink.


Husband:  Here's a 20-- twice as much as you came with. Hit the road.

Jimmy: Open up!




The Husband: Call 911.


Husband: That was it. I feared for my wife and my baby. Let's put the baby to bed.

Catherine Willows: What do you think?
Warrick Brown: Oh, he's lying. That's why I took this job. I can always tell when whitey's talking out his ass. It's a gift.

Catherine Willows: It's also your 100th.
Warrick Brown: Yeah, that, too. So tonight you might say I'm extra suspicious.

Catherine Willows: Why don't you print that tread and see how good you are?


Husband: Why are you doing that?
Warrick Brown: It's just procedure, sir. We just want to make sure the shoe on the suspect is the same shoe that kicked down your door.

Catherine Willows: Wait ... wait a minute.
Warrick Brown: What's the matter?
Catherine Willows: Sir, after you shot the deceased, did you move re-dress, or alter the body in any way?
Husband: No, why?
Warrick Brown: Talk to me.
Catherine Willows: The left shoe's tied differently. Sir, in the six months that the victim lived with you did you ever wear his shoes?
Husband: No, why would I do that?
Warrick Brown: You willing to sign a statement to that effect?
Husband: Sure.
Catherine Willows: Sir, what happened to your pinkie toe?

Husband: I tripped over a rattle.

CUT TO:



Gil Grissom: You got to breathe through your ears, Gribbs.
Dr. Klausbach: First dead body, Ma'am?
Holly Gribbs: Yes, sir, but I'll be okay. To tell you the truth, he looks fake.
Dr. Klausbach: I hate to put a damper on your night, Grissom but it looks like we got ourselves a homicide after all.
Gil Grissom: You see, if the victim had extended his arms like ... here, I'll show you. Give me your hands.

Gil Grissom: And pushed the trigger with his thumbs, like so ...
Cue Sound: GUNSHOT

Gil Grissom:  The wound would look like this.

Dr. Klausbach: He's right, honey. This wound's too big. This person was shot from six to seven feet away. It's like somebody stood over him and, bam!

Cue Sound: GUNSHOT

Dr. Klausbach:  Criminal homicide. 

Dr. Klausbach: Let's see what god would have to say.

Gil Grissom: Are you okay?
Holly Gribbs: I'm sorry, sir. I can't take the smell. Oh, god, restroom?
Dr. Klausbach:  Right down the hall to your right.

Dr. Klausbach:  She is cute.

CUT BACK TO:


Dr. Klausbach: How soon does the captain want that one out?

Gil Grissom: Eight hours.
CUT TO:



(She turns around and starts pounding on the locked door.
Holly Gribbs:  Help! Help me!


Holly Gribbs:  There were bodies. I could feel them breathing. Oh, god!

Gil Grissom: It's okay, Holly, it's all right.

Nick Stokes: I'm Nick Stokes, with criminalistics. You mind if I ask you a few questions?
Mr. Laferty: She got everything -- my wallet, my id ... hell, she even got my wedding ring.
Nick Stokes: Did you two have a nightcap? You think she could've slipped you something?

Mr. Laferty: Nah, I can't drink. I got this bum ticker. Look, officer, I ... 
Nick Stokes: Nick. You can call me nick.
Mr. Laferty: Nick, I ... I love my wife. We've been married 31 years now. I've never cheated on her before. I come into town for this convention and I'm setting in the lounge minding my own business, when this ... sweet-smelling brunette came up to me and ... next thing I know, she's nibbling on my earlobe and ...


Mr. Laferty: Well, my goodness. Look at you.


Mr. Laferty: For a second there, I thought I was your age again.
Nick Stokes: We've been seeing more and more of these the past 48 hours. Let's take a look. Open your eyes wide for me. Sunny side up.

Nick Stokes: Now say &quot;ah.&quot;

Mr. Laferty: Ah.
Nick Stokes: Was she hot?

Nick Stokes: Attaboy. 

Nick Stokes: Mr. Laferty, your eyes look okay but I notice some discoloration around the inside of your lips. Have you always had that?

Mr. Laferty: No. What the hell is that?
Nick Stokes: I'll swab your gums see if we can find out what made you pass out.
CUT TO:





Gil Grissom: You know, my first robbery solved was a store like this. When we caught the guy, the owner was so happy that he gave me a dozen farm fresh eggs out of his cooler.
Holly Gribbs: You're trying to cheer me up, aren't you?
Gil Grissom: Yes, I am. How am I doing?
Holly Gribbs: Pretty good.
Gil Grissom: Good. Okay, look, this was a routine robbery. Dust for prints, check the videotape take lots of fun photos. I'll be back in about an hour to pick you up.
Holly Gribbs: Okay.

Gil Grissom: If you get done early use channel seven on your walkie.

Boe Wilson: What's up?
Warrick Brown: Hey, rookie. Hair fibers from the home invasion. Take a look. 

Warrick Brown: Tell me what you see.
SCOPE VIEW: CAMERA VIEW of the hair follicles.
Boe Wilson: I see a lot of things.
Warrick Brown: Look at the end of the follicles.
SCOPE VIEW: ENHANCED CAMERA VIEW of the hair follicles.
Boe Wilson: Oh, yeah, you know, I see, like little tiny seeds or sacs or something.
Warrick Brown: That's pulp when the human hair is yanked out like this.

Boe Wilson: Ow! Damn, man.

Warrick Brown: Look, you see the seeds? 

Warrick Brown: Hair only comes out in that form when it's yanked or pulled signifying a struggle.

Warrick Brown: You know what? I got to go. Tell Grissom, when he gets back I went to homicide to do a follow-up on the husband. Peace.
Boe Wilson: Yeah.
CUT TO:



Liquor Store Owner: Now, how long is this gonna take? I'm losing business because of you.
Holly Gribbs: Ma'am, I told you, if you let them in it will contaminate the scene.
Liquor Store Owner: Oh, contaminate, my ass! What the hell difference does it make? You ain't gonna catch 'em. You never do.

CUT TO:



Warrick: Sir, I'm on your side. I just want to clear you.
Husband: Then clear me. I already told you everything.
Warrick: I understand that. But the evidence is telling us something different. So I'm going to ask you again, just one more time -- before you shot the deceased did a struggle ensue?

Husband: I've got a gun.

Wife: What are you doing?

Husband: Call 911.



Husband: I must've tied the laces wrong. I'm sorry, I ... I know I should've told you earlier but ... I was nervous. I mean ... I took a man's life here. You don't believe me, do you?

Holly Gribbs: This is Holly Gribbs requesting backup at Junk's on West Owens, over.

Greg Sanders: So, this is it, huh? The $8,000 q-tip.
Nick Stokes: Well, you're the chemist. I just need to know what knocked the old man out.
Greg Sanders: In 20 seconds, this'll give us a complete chemical breakdown right down to the atom. But I'm going to warn you, though. These mouth swabs don't always read. Vaginal swabs, no problem. a**l swabs-- money.
Nick Stokes: a**l swabs?
Greg Sanders: a**l swabs.

Nick Stokes: Ouch.

Nick Stokes: Dude, you get NFL-2K for Dreamcast?
Greg Sanders: Yeah. Bought it the day it came out. Those graphics are killer, aren't they? My team's the Falcons. Who do you use?
Nick Stokes: Randy Moss.

Nick Stokes: It didn't take, did it?
Greg Sanders: A hint of saliva; some denture adhesive ... that's it. 

Greg Sanders: Sorry, man.
CUT TO:



Catherine Willows: All right, put the gun down.
Liquor Store Owner: What? We're getting robbed again now?

Catherine Willows: Everything okay here?
Holly Gribbs: Yes, ma'am.

Catherine Willows:  Control, Junk's is a code four.
Officer:  Copy that.
Catherine Willows: You the new girl?
Holly Gribbs: Yeah. Hi, I'm Holly Gribbs.
Catherine Willows: Thanks. I'm Catherine Willows.
Liquor Store Owner: And I'm Lesley Stahl. Look, let's forget the formalities. Which one of you people's gonna clean my counter here?
Catherine Willows: Let me tell you something, Lady -- if you don't care about catching the suspect neither do we. We're out of here. You can pick your gun up tomorrow.

Holly Gribbs:  You can do that?
Catherine Willows:  No.

Liquor Store Owner: Ow!

Warrick Brown: Damn!
Gil Grissom: Blunt force trauma case. Bermuda hills country club. Pregnant wife caught her husband in bed with another girl. What do you think? Malicious intent?
Warrick Brown: Little bit, yeah.

Warrick Brown: How's it coming?
Gil Grissom: It's coming. 
Warrick Brown: Whose blood is that?
Gil Grissom: The new girl's. Would you like to donate?
Warrick Brown: Hell, no.

Gil Grissom: How'd the follow-up go with the husband? Boe tells me you were onto something.
Warrick Brown: The story's changed a bit. Now he says there was a struggle. Said he stepped on his shoe while they were fighting.
Gil Grissom: You believe him?
Warrick Brown: At first, no but now ... hell, I don't know what to think.
Gil Grissom: You ever see the movie &quot;The Exorcist&quot;?
Warrick Brown: Yeah.
Gil Grissom: The old priest and Father Karras are about to exorcise the demon. Father Karras explains that he's recorded the little girl's voice and he's broken down the spirit into three distinct personalities. But the old priest quickly corrects him -- &quot;there is only one.&quot;

Gil Grissom: Forget about the husband, Warrick. Forget about the assumptions. Forget about your promotion. These things will only confuse you. Concentrate on what cannot lie -- the evidence. Follow ... the reason we're having this conversation.
Warrick Brown:  Follow the shoe.

Warrick Brown: Well, I'll be damned.

Charlotte: Remember this from your suicide case? Minute I pulled it, I knew something wasn't right. 

Charlotte: The impression's perfect -- maybe too perfect. 

Charlotte: Take a gander.

SCOPE VIEW of the print with red dots on it.
Gil Grissom: What are those red particles?
Charlotte: Latex flakes.

Gil Grissom: From what?
Charlotte: Protective gloves, maybe but the way I figure it, this son of a bitch is smart -- probably planted the damn prints. So on a hunch, I chemically tested the flakes. Guess what it was laced with? 

Charlotte: Lecithin.
Gil Grissom: That chemical's found in cooking spray isn't it? 

Gil Grissom:  If latex rubber and cooking spray went on a blind date, how would the night end?
Charlotte: A lot better than ours did.
Gil Grissom: I know, Pink Floyd's not your thing.
Charlotte: I have on cowboy boots. I work in a lab. What makes you think
&quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; synched to the Wizard of Oz is going to warm my damn barn?
Gil Grissom: I just thought it'd be something different.
Charlotte: You want to be different? Pin me up against a wall; lay one on me like you mean it.

Charlotte: You're slacking, pal.

Gil Grissom: How long till we get a hit?
Charlotte: It could be four minutes, could be four days but you can bet your ass she'll give you something. She always does.
Gil Grissom: &quot;Pin you against a wall?&quot;

Holly Gribbs: Look, um, I got to be honest. This isn't me. I was pushed into it by my mom. She's a Lieutenant in Traffic. She's never going to get out of traffic so, um, I'm fulfilling her dreams, not mine.
Catherine Willows: I can sit here and I can baby you and I can tell you to quit but I'm not going to do that, because I really love my job. We're just a bunch of kids that are getting paid to work on puzzles. Sometimes there's a piece that's missing. Sometimes we solve it in one night.
Holly Gribbs: So you think I should stick with it?
Catherine Willows: Stick with it? The cops? Forget it. They wouldn't know fingerprints from paw prints and the detectives ... chase the lie. We solve. We restore peace of mind and when you're a victim, that's everything. Stick with it. At least until you solve your first and if after that you don't feel like King Kong on cocaine ... then you can quit, but if you stay with it my hand to god, you will never regret it.

Jim Brass: If you want me to call Judge Cohen at 4:00 in the morning you'd better bring me something more than a damn toenail.
Warrick Brown: Captain, you've got to make that call. If you don't, he'll walk.
Jim Brass: And what do you got? Hair fibers. Big deal. So there was a struggle. I mean, who gives a corn cob? The guy was protecting his wife and kid.
Warrick Brown: I've got the toenail. If I can get a warrant and match the husband's shaving to his toe I can prove that the suspect's foot was inside the victim's shoe. That alone will establish it was murder.
Jim Brass: The guy lived there, Warrick! Maybe he put on the victim's sneaker and fetched the paper one morning.
Warrick Brown: I have a sworn statement stating he never wore the victim's shoe.
Jim Brass: You don't even know the toenail was the vic's.
Warrick Brown: It can't be the vic's. He was wearing socks.
Jim Brass: Not good enough.
Warrick Brown: Not good enough?

Jim Brass: Look, I said no, Brown, damn it!

Jim Brass: Hey, we're not done, Warrick. You stay right there. 

Jim Brass: Criminalistics, Brass.
Gil Grissom:  We've got a name on the suicide case, sir. He's local.

Jim Brass: He's local, good. I'll phone the judge for a warrant. 

Jim Brass: Hey, Warrick, I guess we're all done now. Hey, do you mind closing the door behind you? I got to make an important call. 

Jim Brass: We'll talk about your little foot fetish later. 

Jim Brass:  Judge Cohen, please ...

Officer Smith: A white female, mid-20s. Said she passed out behind the wheel. Thought you might want to check it out.
Nick Stokes:  All right. Thanks, brother. 

Nick Stokes: Hi. Nick Stokes, criminalistics. Mind if I take a look?

Kristy Hopkins:  I don't know what happened. I remember this song that was playing on the radio. I just don't remember passing out.

Nick Stokes: Say &quot;ahhh...&quot;

Kristy Hopkins: What?
Nick Stokes: You know, ahhh ...  ... ah ... ?

Kristy Hopkins: Ahhh ...

Nick Stokes: No discoloration.  I don't see anything criminal here. 

Nick Stokes: Take her to the hospital have her checked out.

Officer Arvington: Keep your mouth shut and follow my instructions. 

Officer Arvington: Now get down on your knees.
Warrick Brown: I'm not getting down on my knees for anybody. You can shoot me.
Officer Arvington: I said get down on your knees!
Judge Cohen: Hey! What the hell are you doing? That's Warrick Brown from ID. Put those guns away.
Officer Arvington: Sorry, Judge, we got a call from a neighbor about a black man outside your house. We responded.
Judge Cohen: All right, you caught him. Congratulations. Clear out of here before you wake the neighbors.
Officer Arvington: Yes, sir.  Dispatch, please be advised Judge Cohen's residence, a code 4: False alarm.

Judge Cohen: Brown, what the hell are you doing?
Warrick Brown: I'm sorry, Judge. Captain Brass wouldn't call you for a search warrant. I got a whopper on the line with a 100-pound test.
Judge Cohen: You got a winner for me? 

Judge Cohen: I'll make it worth your while, you give me a name.
Warrick Brown: Favre.
Judge Cohen: Oh, I knew it. Listen, kid, I'll make a deal with you. You put
$5,000 down on the Pack for me I'll give you a blank warrant. All I ask is that you have the ticket in my chambers before kickoff. You do that, I'll square it with your Captain.

Paul Millander: A staged suicide?. You're kidding, right? I swear on my kids I've never seen that man before in my life.
Sergeant O'Riley: Then how the hell did your fingerprints wind up at the scene? We talked to the family. The deceased didn't even know any Paul Millander's.

Gil Grissom: Oh, I ... hi, Sergeant. Would you mind if I, uh ... ?
Sergeant O'Riley: Oh, you want a whack at him, Grissom be my guest.

Gil Grissom: Hi, Mr. Millander.  My name's Gil Grissom.
 I work in Criminalistics. May I ask you a few questions?
Paul Millander: Sure.
Gil Grissom: Do you have any hobbies? Make model airplanes, make toys wind chimes for the backyard, that sort of thing?
Paul Millander: No, why?
Gil Grissom: Well, we found some particles of latex on your thumbprint. Would you have any reason to have access to that particular substance?
Paul Millander: Well, yeah. Yeah, sure. At-at my job.

Gil Grissom: Excellent work. These seem very real.
Paul Millander: Thanks.
Gil Grissom: You ever make any rubber hands?
Paul Millander: Sure, we do, uh ... 

Paul Millander:  This is our best seller right here. Sold 10,000 of those units last Halloween. Even used my own hand for the mold.
Gil Grissom: These are your prints.
Paul Millander: Yeah, why? What does that mean?
Gil Grissom: It means you're free to go. He's not the guy.
Sergeant O'Riley: Grissom, are you sure?

Gil Grissom: This explains the latex and the lecithin.

Gil Grissom:  You need oil to make a print.

Gil Grissom: Anyone who purchased one of these hands could be the killer ...

Nick Stokes: Hey, Dr. Leever!
Dr. Leever: Hey, what's up, man?
Nick Stokes: I got your page.
Dr. Leever: Have you had any trick rolls lately?
Nick Stokes: A ton of 'em. Why?
Dr. Leever: I've had six pros come through the ER in the past two nights all with two distinct similarities. Every girl has been mysteriously knocked unconscious and we found some skin discoloration.

Nick Stokes: Whoa. whoa. Skin discoloration?

Nick Stokes: Where? Their lips?
Dr. Leever: No, their nipples.
CUT TO:



Nick Stokes: We meet again ... may I see your discoloration?
Kristy Hopkins: You wanna give me 20 bucks?
Nick Stokes: You wanna do time? 

Nick Stokes: You know, I just came from a trick roll downtown. The victim's mouth had similar blotching. Chances are, whatever he ingested orally you absorbed through your nipples knocking you both out. So I'll give you a choice. You give back the old man his belongings, you tell me what you girls are using and I won't have you charged with attempted murder. 

Nick Stokes: Which is it?

Nick Stokes: Eyedrops?
CUT TO:



Greg Sanders: No, it's scopolamine. It's a chemical used for motion sickness. This eyedrop bottle's a front. One drop of this stuff and she's out cold.

 






CUT TO:



Gil Grissom: We're ruling out suicide. The evidence leads us to believe that it was in fact a homicide.

Paige Harmon: Then he was murdered?
Gil Grissom: I believe so.

Paige Harmon: You know ... this may sound funny but I feel better knowing that he didn't take his own life. To me that would never sit right. He was such a good man ...

Catherine Willows: Could you take a look at this drawing and point out to me ... where he touched you?

Catherine Willows: Can you just show me?

Laura Scott: Can you hold my dolly for me?

Catherine Willows:  I'd love to.
Laura Scott: Not just hold her. Take her away to your house.
Catherine Willows: To my house? Why?

Jim Brass: Why? You deliberately went over my head, Brown. The phone call from the judge saved your job, but not your ass! I want you shadowing Gribbs. A robbery just came in.
Warrick Brown: Captain. You can't do that. Me and Nick are tied!
Jim Brass: Tough! Grissom! 

Jim Brass: Have Warrick shadow Gribbs for the next three weeks or until Nickie makes his hundredth, whatever comes first.

Warrick Brown: I hate your ass, you know that? People walk every day because of you-- every day!

Gil Grissom: That's enough, Warrick. Let's go!
CUT TO:



Warrick Brown: Damn it, Gris. I had his ass too!
Gil Grissom: Yes, you had him and the minute you started thinking about yourself instead of the case, you lost him. There is no room for subjectivity in this department, Warrick. You know that. We handle each case objectively without presupposition regardless of race, color, creed, or bubble gum flavor. 

Gil Grissom: Okay?



Warrick Brown: Let's go.

CUT TO:



Holly Gribbs: Sorry you gotta baby-sit.

Warrick Brown: Yeah, I'm sorry too.  Control, p-4442 arrive. 
Control:  Copy that.
Warrick: Okay, go inside. Dust for prints. Make sure you take plenty of photographs ...
Holly Gribbs: photographs. Be thorough. Don't worry. I got the same speech from Mr. Grissom.
Warrick Brown: Good. Look, I gotta run an errand. You'll be okay on your own?
Holly Gribbs: You kidding? I'm fired up, ready to go.  Besides, there's an officer here.

Cue Sound:  KNOCKING
CUT TO:



Gil Grissom: Morning. Gil Grissom, forensics. I'm taking over the case for Warrick Brown. Mind if I come in?
Husband:  How can I help you?
Gil Grissom: I need to give you a pedicure.
Husband: Come again?

Gil Grissom: I have a warrant for your toenails.


Husband: A warrant? What? Am I a suspect? I already gave you a sworn statement.
Gil Grissom: A statement's just a public record of your version. We still need proof.
(Behind him, the WIFE appears in the living room securing the tie on her robe. The HUSBAND turns and glances back at her.
Husband: Well, I'd love to help you, but I already cut them.
Gil Grissom: May I see where you discarded the clippings?
Husband: I flushed them down the toilet.
Gil Grissom: May I see your toilet? 
CUT TO:


Gil Grissom: I'll be right back. 

SHORT TIME CUT TO:



Gil Grissom: Excuse me.

CUT TO:



Catherine Willows:  Control, this is p-3901. I'm going to be on break for about fifteen minutes.
CUT TO:



Lindsey Willows: Mommy?

Catherine Willows: Shh. 

Catherine Willows:  We don't want to wake up Jeremy.

Lindsey Willows: Mommy, what's wrong?
Catherine Willows: Mommy just kind of had a rough night. I couldn't drive here fast enough to tell you how much I love you.
Lindsey Willows: I know, mommy. I love you, too.

CUT TO:





Gil Grissom: Nope, loser. Give me the next item up for bid.

Boe Wilson: It's nasty. 
Gil Grissom: No, striation. Whenever two objects are broken there occurs what we call striae -- two unique connecting points. If I can match the nail in the sneaker to the suspect's clippings ... 


Gil Grissom: Alcatraz!
Boe Wilson: The brother was right, wasn't he?!
Gil Grissom:  Uh-huh!
Boe Wilson:  Yeah!
Gil Grissom: Careful, Boe, you'll hurt your back.
CUT TO:



Clerk: What's up, man?
Warrick Brown: Gimme Packers.
Clerk: One second ...
Gil Grissom:  Warrick, come in.
Warrick Brown:  This is Warrick. Go ahead.
Gil Grissom:  It's Grissom. We got him.
Warrick Brown:  Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, yeah! I'll be right there.
Clerk: Who do you want now?
Warrick Brown: Gimmie Niners for five dimes.

CUT TO:



SLOW MOTION CAMERA




Jimmy:  Open up!
Husband:  Open the door ...
Wife:  What are you gonna do?
Husband: Don't ask questions. Just open the door.
Jimmy:  You son of a bitch!



Husband: Call 911.

Husband: Do it!




RESUME MOTION:


Gil Grissom: Hey, weren't you supposed to be shadowing Holly?
Warrick Brown: Oh, she's cool. She's doing prints on that 407. There's an officer there. 

Warrick Brown: I'm out.
CUT TO:




Jerrod Cooper: Excuse me, ma'am.

Holly Gribbs: Hi. Uh... can I help you?
Jerrod Cooper: I'm the neighbor from across the way and I just saw a cop car leave. Is everything okay?
Holly Gribbs: Yeah, we had a robbery, but everything's fine.
Jerrod Cooper:  Oh, okay.


CUT TO:


Cue Sound: KNOCKING

Nick Stokes: Room service.
Mr. Laferty: You're kidding me. 

Mr. Laferty: My stuff! You found my stuff!
Nick Stokes: Yeah, yeah, your wallet, your cash, credit cards ... 

Nick Stokes: ... wedding ring ... 

Mr. Laferty: Oh, thank god.

Nick Stokes: Okay, next time you wanna take a shot go to the dice table. At least if you crap out, you can go home broke instead of busted, you know what I mean?
Mr. Laferty: I sure do. Thank you.
CUT TO:



Gil Grissom: Congratulations, Nickie, my boy. You are now a C.S.I. Level 3.
Nick Stokes: Whoo!
Warrick Brown: Good job, Nick.
Nick Stokes: Thanks. Uh, hey, Warrick, listen I heard about the whole thing with the shoe and ...
Warrick Brown: Forget it, man. It's all you.

Nick Stokes: Thanks.
Warrick: All right.
Catherine Willows: Let's get some breakfast. It's on me!

Jim Brass:  Sorry to break up your party but I need grave to pull a double. Holly Gribbs has been shot. She's in surgery now. Apparently the suspect returned to the scene. They don't think she's gonna make it. Brown, I'm putting you on administrative leave pending a full report of your whereabouts. So wash your face and change your socks. You have a long day ahead of you.



FADE TO BLACK.

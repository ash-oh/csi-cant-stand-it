<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: How you want us to handle this, Grissom?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Same way you'd eat an elephant ... one bite at a time.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks around and notices some blood drops on the floor leading to under a table. He makes his way toward it. BRASS finishes up with an officer.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hey, Jim ... did you know that Charles Manson is only 5'2&quot;?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah, little guys tend to overcompensate.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Do you remember the, uh, story about ... how and where the marshals found old Charlie when they raided barker ranch?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (gets it) Yeah. I always, uh ... </p>
<p>(BRASS quietly unholsters his gun.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I always liked that story.</p>
<p>(He kneels down and aims under the table. GRISSOM moves the cloth aside to show a little boy, awake, huddled on his side, shivering and bleeding from a gunshot wound.) </p>

<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: How many shots you fire at the second gunman, total?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Fromansky</strong>: (thinking) Maybe-maybe five. I'd taken a shot in my vest. </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Hard to count under those conditions. Are you sure?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Fromansky</strong>: No, I'm not sure. That's why I said maybe ... ...but I know I shot four at the third guy. I was going to check on my partner. I caught movement in the back. Black coat, ski mask, gun ... I put him down.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: A THIRD GUNMAN as a dark blur runs across the screen from left to right. OFFICER FROMANSKY kneels next to his partner, looks up, sees the figure and fires multiple shots.)</p>
<p>(A woman screams. The GUNMAN falls to the floor.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: He fire at you?</p>

<p><strong>Brass</strong>: All right. </p>
<p>(OFFICER FROMANSKY stands up to make the call. BRASS turns to GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: All right, look, if you're not going to say it, I will. Fromansky said he killed three, and there are two dead ski masks in there. Now, you cranked him up pretty good on that vigilante case last year. Is that going to be a problem?</p>

If you could just bear with me a little longer, I need to talk with every one of you one at a time, so I promise to get you out of here as quickly as possible. (quietly to the officer) Is the, uh, guy in black the cocktail waitress' husband?</p>
<p><strong>Officer Metcalf</strong>: Yeah. Do you want him first?</p>
<p>(She looks at him, his head in his hands.)</p>

<p><strong>Bagboy</strong>: I was looking at his piece, not his face, okay?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Shotgun or handgun?</p>
<p><strong>Bagboy</strong>: Uh, shotgun. He drags her over to the registers, makes her open 'em up. She does. They're pulling out the cash, and then he sees the cops roll up. Second guy says, &quot;everybody, get down and don't say a freaking word,&quot; so that's what I did.</p>
<p>(He glances behind him.)</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: The door was twenty feet away. He probably could've made a run for it.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You know, after the MGM grand fire, they found people fused to slot machines. Never even made it out of their seats. This guy probably thought it was his lucky day. I'm sure he wasn't going to leave without his money.</p>

<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What can you tell me about the little boy who was also brought in from the robbery incident?</p>
<p><strong>Nurse</strong>: Minor injuries. He's fine. Mostly shock. He's with his mom. Hell of a night, huh? Take your kid to work, both end up shot.</p>

<p><strong>Celeste Turner</strong>: Well, my ex was looking after him that night. Then the son of a bitch shows up at the store. Had a party to go to. Practically shoved Henry out of the car. I mean ... I'm not allowed to bring kids to work. So I snuck Henry into the office, and I told him to stay there.</p>

<p><strong>Mr. Reed</strong>: Yeah.</p>

<p>(Cut back to: WARRICK examines the jacket and finds the hole in the sleeve.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (V.O.) Let me tell you what it is. It's the active ingredient in drain cleaner. It opens up the pipes, dissolves flesh and fabrics.</p>
<p>[INTERVIEW - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(WARRICK walks into the interview with the test results.)</p>
<p><strong>Todd Hallickey</strong>: Look, you want to pin that car on me, you go ahead and try. </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I got this off the jacket from your apartment. What the hell is this?</p>
<p><strong>Brown</strong>: It's a bullet wipe. A test for lead. </p>
<p>(Quick CGI POV to: A bullet is shot and it hits the jacket. End of CGI POV.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Congratulations. You passed.</p>
<p>(TODD HALLICKEY stares at WARRICK and swallows.)</p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[INT. CSI - BREAK ROOM - LATE DAY] </p>
<p>(GRISSOM, WARRICK and CATHERINE meet to discuss the case.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Hallickey's got no connection to the grocery store. He was just the wheel man. Even, still, he's looking at four counts of felony murder. But he's not talking. He lawyered up.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We got a bullet hole in a jacket. That's not even enough to prove that he was in the store.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What about the cash?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: It wasn't in his apartment. Maybe somebody else took it.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Almost $900 in small bills? We'd have noticed pockets bulging with a wad like that.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What about the calls from the grocery store to the suspect's cell? That could have been somebody giving the &quot;go&quot; signal.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: There's no way to tell who. The store runs off of an old PBX system, and every call that comes in goes back to the same number. Every employee was near a phone, so, it could have been anybody.</p>
<p>(NICK walks into the room and takes a seat.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, y'all. Ran the criminal records for the employees. Came up with a Raul Valdez. Freight loader.</p>
<p>(NICK hands GRISSOM a photo.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: He clocked in for work that night. Never clocked out.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No one by that name interviewed at the scene?</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Here's the kicker. A few years ago, he spent some time in prison. Lompoc. So, Brass is trying to find him now.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM hands the photo to CATHERINE.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. BEST BARGAIN SUPERMARKET] </p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks through the aisles. She looks at the photo where the bag of money was found and heads for that spot in the aisle. She looks down at the ground.)</p>
<p>(Quick flash to the bag of money.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks around. She puts her bag down and checks the aisles.)</p>
<p>(She finds a brown stain on the floor. She rubs her finger in it and smells it. She knows what it is.)</p>
<p>(Quick flash to: The interview with the BAGBOY.)</p>
<p><strong>Bagboy</strong>: I got to change my pants.</p>
<p>(She looks down and notices the stain. End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE checks the shelves and finds a box of PUFFIOS stuffed with the missing money.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM] </p>
<p>(CATHERINE re-interviews the BAGBOY.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You left something in the store besides a urine stain. </p>
<p>(She puts the photo of the box of PUFFIOS in front of him.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Just a little too tempting, huh? All that cash just sitting there right in front of your face ...</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: With gunfire all around him, the BAGBOY has his head down. He looks up and notices the money in the shelves. He starts grabbing it.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Bagboy</strong>: Look, I go to that store to bag groceries, not to get my ass shot off. I figure I earned the money. Kind of like working overtime.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Might as well get something for all your trouble, right? Considering the fact that your nice little robbery had gone straight to hell.</p>
<p><strong>Bagboy</strong>: Whoa, wait a minute. You think ... ? No way.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: It was an inside job. You knew the registers were full. Those gunmen had help from an employee.</p>
<p><strong>Bagboy</strong>: Not from me, they didn't. Look, you want to bust me for the money, go ahead, I took it. But I did not set the thing up.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE stares at him.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI -- LAB] </p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks through the scope. WARRICK walks in.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You know, Hodges already analyzed trace on the bullets.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Yeah, I wanted to take a look myself.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: He'll take it personally.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Good. The report says that the cocktail waitress was wearing a black wool sweater. Was she also wearing something polyester?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Take a look at this.</p>
<p>(WARRICK looks through the scope.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Black fibers. Probably synthetic. Mixed in with the wool. If their gunman was wearing a black polyester jacket ... </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Fromansky claims that he was tunnel-visioned on the gunman. So, it's possible that he never even saw the cocktail waitress.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: THE GUNMAN runs across the aisle. FROMANSKY raises his gun and fires at the moving target.)</p>
<p>(Camera zooms in and follows the bullet as it travels straight for JULIA REED piercing through her clothes and flesh.)</p>
<p>(The GUNMAN continues to run; JULIA REED falls to the ground.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You may have just saved Fromansky's ass.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI -- HALLWAY] </p>
<p>(NICK catches up with CATHERINE in the hallway.) </p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Hey, Catherine, how'd it go with the bag boy?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: He admitted to swiping the cash, but he wouldn't cop to the robbery.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Then I have something you should see. I was going back through the surveillance tapes covering the loading dock, thinking I might find someone scouting a blind spot, you know? But instead, I found this. Two nights before the robbery.</p>
<p>(NICK shows CATHERINE what's on the video.)</p>
<p>(On video: The camera moves to the left.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: There. See that?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: One more time.</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: Yeah.</p>
<p>(On video: The camera shifts to the left.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick</strong>: That camera's stationary, so ... </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Somebody moved the camera.</p>
<p>(NICK smiles.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM] </p>
<p>(CATHERINE interviews CELESTE TURNER.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You used to part-time at the forum shops. We got your prints off your work card. It was the same print that we got off the loading dock surveillance camera. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE shows the photo to CELESTE TURNER.)</p>
<p>(Quick flash of CELESTE TURNER moving the security camera.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: The camera view.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Raul Valdez, an ex-con -- your co-worker. You got him to give you the names of some guys to do the job. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You give them the best time to hit the registers. You tell them where to park. It's a good plan. Until your Ex showed up and leaves you with your kid. </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Then you panic, and you call your guys, try to call it off, but they won't listen. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: If that's what happened, that could go in your favor. </p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: When we find Raul, he'll give you up in a heartbeat.</p>
<p><strong>Celeste Turner</strong>: (swallows) I think I need to get a lawyer.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What you need is come clean and cooperate. And you better hope and pray the DA doesn't want to put a needle in your arm for killing five people, including a cop.</p>
<p><strong>Celeste Turner</strong>: I have been working at that store for five years. Thirty-eight hours a week. Thirty-eight ... not forty. You know why? Because my manager won't give me enough hours to qualify for benefits. I have a kid ... with rotten teeth. I never meant for anybody to get hurt.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - HALLWAY -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(OFFICER FROMANSKY receives an award at the police department. REPORTERS take photos of the presentation.) </p>
<p><strong>Reporter</strong>: Officer Fromansky, if you could smile, please? REPORTER: Thank you; right over here.</p>
<p>(BRASS and GRISSOM walk past the gathering.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Guy from the mayor's office. Fromansky's getting a commendation. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Two dead felons, two dead civilians a dead policeman ... I don't know what to think.</p>
<p>(They walk out of camera frame.)</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK</p>
<p><strong>End</strong></p>

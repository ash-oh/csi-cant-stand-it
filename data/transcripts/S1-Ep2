<p>[INT. GRISSOM'S OFFICE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(HOLLY GRIBBS gasps and jumps in surprise.)</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: Hi, sorry. Welcome to Forensics. Gil Grissom, I'm your supervisor on grayayard.</p>
<p><strong>Holly Gribbs</strong>: Holly Gribbs.</p>
<p>(The shake hands. She exhales with relief and smiles.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. JIM BRASS' OFFICE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(In CAPT JIM BRASS' office, GRISSOM takes a seat on the couch near the window, HOLLY remains standing in front of his desk.)</p>
<p><strong>Jim Brass</strong>: (angry) Well, congratulations, Gribbs. You're the fifth person I've been forced to hire. </p>
<p><strong>Holly Gribbs</strong>: Well, that's not fair.</p>
<p><strong>Jim Brass</strong>: Putting a juiced-in Lieutenant's daughter on the shift is fair?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT]</p>
<p><strong>Holly Gribbs</strong>: I'm fulfilling her dreams, not mine.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine Willows</strong>: I can sit here, and I can baby you and I can tell you to quit, but I'm not going to do that at least until you've solved your first, and if, after that, you don't feel like King Kong on cocaine, then you can quit.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - BRASS' OFFICE - MORNING]</p>
<p><strong>Jim Brass</strong>: Grissom!</p>
<p>(GRISSOM, standing out in the hallway, turns and heads for the office.)</p>
<p><strong>Jim Brass</strong>: Have Warrick shadow Gribbs for the next three weeks or until Nicky makes his 100th, whatever comes first.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: People walk every day because of you.</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: That's enough. Warrick, let's go!</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />

<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. JUDGE COHEN'S HOUSE - NIGHT]</p>
<p><strong>Warrick Brown</strong>: I'm sorry, Judge. Captain Brass wouldn't call you for a search warrant. I got a whopper on the line with a 100 pound test.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Cohen</strong>: You got a winner for me?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick Brown</strong>: Favre.</p>
<p><strong>Judge Cohen</strong>: You put $5,000 down on the Pack for me I'll give you a blank warrant.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - BREAK ROOM]</p>

<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. PATHFINDER OUTSIDE THE PARLAY HUT - MORNING]</p>
<p><strong>Warrick Brown</strong>: (to radio) Woo-hoo! Yeah! I'll be right there. </p>
<p>(He puts the radio down.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick Brown</strong>: Uh, give me 'Niners for five dimes.</p>
<p>(WARRICK hands the CLERK a stack of cash.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. RESIDENCE - SUMMERLIN - DAY]</p>
<p>(Just after they arrested the HUSBAND and while GRISSOM and WARRICK stand out in the front yard watching the arrest.)</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: Weren't you supposed to be shadowing holly?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick Brown</strong>: Oh. She's cool. She's doing prints on that 4-0-7. There's an officer there.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. MARTIN LUTHER KING RESIDENCE - MORNING]</p>
<p>(HOLLY is dusting for prints.)</p>

<p>(She gasps and turns around.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY - MORNING]</p>
<p><strong>Jim Brass</strong>: Holly Gribbs has been shot. They don't think she's going to make it.</p>

<p>(A Young Man and Young Woman hesitantly walk along the casino floor. JAMIE spots the large $40 Million MegaMillion Jackpot sign.)</p>
<p><strong>Jamie</strong>: Hey, look. Oh, $40 million. Could you imagine?</p>
<p><strong>Ted Sallenger</strong>: Never happen. You got a better chance of going to the moon.</p>
<p><strong>Jamie</strong>: Oh, give me a $20. Hurry! I just got a premonition.</p>
<p><strong>Ted Sallenger</strong>: You got your own money. Go play.</p>
<p><strong>Jamie</strong>: But I left my purse in the room.</p>
<p>(TED SALLENGER takes out a twenty, but doesn't give it to her.)</p>
<p><strong>Ted Sallenger</strong>: I'll play. Wait here.</p>
<p>(He sighs and heads for the slot machine.)</p>
<p><strong>Clerk</strong>: (to TED) Is this your slot card?</p>
<p><strong>Ted Sallenger</strong>: No.</p>
<p>(The CLERK takes the card and leaves. TED looks over at JAMIE and without looking, turns the handle to the machine. JAMIE cranes her neck from the side to see his results.)</p>
<p>(TED turns the handle again.)</p>
<p><strong>Ted Sallenger</strong>: Your little premonition has cost me $20. Happy now? Here.</p>
<p>(For a third time, TED turns the handle again. Without even looking or waiting for it to stop, TED leaves the machine and heads back to JAMIE.)</p>
<p><strong>Ted Sallenger</strong>: (sarcastically) Watch out. Here come the millions.</p>
<p>(JAMIE watches as the machine stops on the three jackpot dollar signs. She starts screaming with excitement.)</p>
<p><strong>Jamie</strong>: (pointing and screaming) Oh, my God! </p>
<p>(Sirens start blaring. JAMIE jumps into TED'S arms.)</p>
<p>(The sirens continue to blare and JAMIE screams.)</p>

<p><strong>Jamie</strong>: (puts her arms around TED) They gave us the presidential suite. Can you believe it?</p>
<p><strong>Elias Templeton</strong>: Here, Richard Gere, why don't you let me help you with that?</p>
<p>(ELIAS chuckles, then opens the room door. The lock beeps and the door opens.)</p>

<p>(She turns around to look at TED.)</p>
<p><strong>Jamie</strong>: Excuse me?</p>
<p><strong>Ted</strong>: Come on, Jamie. I'm a millionaire now. Now, why would I want to waste anymore time with you?</p>
<p>(There's a knock at the front door. They both turn to look at the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Voice Outside</strong>: (o.s.) Room service?</p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO:</p>
<p>[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - MORNING]</p>
<hr />
[EXT. HOTEL MONACO - FRONT SIDEWALK - MORNING]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM approaches the scene. He's on the phone.)</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: (to phone) All right, the minute you hear anything on Holly Gribbs's condition I want you to page me. </p>
<p>(He ducks under the crime scene tape.)</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: (to phone) All right? Bye.</p>
<p>(He hangs up.)</p>
<p><strong>Dispatcher</strong>: (from b.g. radio) ... Call back at 4-7-7 Desert Inn Road.</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: So he pulled a &quot;Louganis&quot;, huh?</p>
<p><strong>Detective Barns</strong>: Yeah, 150 feet. The giga-millions curse strikes again. Past four winners ended up dead or missing. What do you think, Grissom? It's a conspiracy.</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: Coincidence. I worked those four cases. There was never any evidence of foul play. Was he in town with anybody?</p>
<p><strong>Detective Barns</strong>: His girlfriend. She's upstairs in police custody. Do you want to talk to her?</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: Not yet. Right now, I want to talk to him.</p>
<p><strong>Detective Barns</strong>: How do you talk to a dead body?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM moves in closer to the body and kneels down to look at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: I let him talk to me, actually. </p>
<p>(He pulls off his dark glasses and reaches out for something next to the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: In fact, he just spoke. Didn't you hear him? He just told me that he didn't commit suicide.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM holds up a pair of broken glasses.)</p>
<p><strong>Detective Barns</strong>: No. You-you lost me.</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: This guy fell to his death wearing prescription eyeglasses. Jumpers take their glasses off. Suicide is the ultimate form of selfishness, Detective. It's unlikely that anyone cowardly enough to take his own life would be brave enough to watch his own death.</p>
<p><strong>Detective Barns</strong>: (laughs) You can tell all that just by looking at a pair of eyeglasses?</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: You have no idea.</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO: END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI -- RECEPTION AREA -- MORNING]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks in past the receptionist. More out of habit, then really expecting anything, GRISSOM asks for his messages and continues walking past the receptionist.)</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: Messages?</p>
<p>(Without a word, The Receptionist reaches for the stack of white telephone messages slips in front of her. GRISSOM stops, surprised. He takes them and leafs through them. He heads on down the hallway.)</p>
<p>(As he passes by people in the hallway and inside the labs, they look up and stare at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>
<hr />
[INT. CSI - BRASS' OFFICE - DAY -- CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(In his office, BRASS has cleared out his desk. On it is a file box. GRISSOM appears in the doorway.)</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: I just got off the phone with the Sheriff. He says he wants me to run the unit.</p>
<p><strong>Jim Brass</strong>: You're the boss. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks into the office.)</p>
<p><strong>Jim Brass</strong>: I mean, I can't say I didn't do it to myself.</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: Where are they going to place you?</p>
<p><strong>Jim Brass</strong>: Homicide. Believe that?</p>
<p>(He chuckles humorlessly.)</p>
<p><strong>Jim Brass</strong>: Instead of moving up, I'm moving back in a time capsule, like it's<br />
1979 again. So, I guess, this might put you and me at odds.</p>
<p>(BRASS picks up his box and starts toward the door.)</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: Cop versus scientist. Interesting, huh?</p>
<p>(BRASS stops and looks at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Jim Brass</strong>: (nods quietly) Yeah.</p>
<p>(BRASS continues to head toward the door carrying his file box.)</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: You got any advice for me? </p>
<p><strong>Jim Brass</strong>: Yeah, cover your ass ... and hide. They're all yours, pal.</p>
<p>(With his file box in his hands, JIM BRASS walks out of the office.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:</p>

[TELEVISION SCREEN NEWS REPORT]</p>
<p><strong>Paula Francis</strong>: (on tv) Tragedy struck early this morning when an on-duty Las Vegas Criminalist was brutally gunned down. </p>
<p>[INT. CSI - BREAK ROOM - MORNING]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and NICK stand in front of the television set watching the news report.)</p>
<p><strong>Paula Francis</strong>: (on tv) It was her first night on the job. Victim Holly Gribbs was investigating a robbery/homicide in an apartment on the corner of M.L.K. and Warm Springs.</p>
<p>(WARRICK sits off to the side. He's also listening to the news report.)</p>
<p><strong>Paula Francis</strong>: (on tv) The crime lab now faces the daunting task of investigating the shooting of one of their own. The wounded C.S.I. has been taken to Desert Palm where she is listed in critical condition. The suspect is still at large. </p>
<p><strong>Newscaster (male)</strong>: (b.g.) In other news ...</p>
<p>(CATHERINE turns around to look at WARRICK. NICK also turns around.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine Willows</strong>: Weren't you supposed to be shadowing Holly?</p>
<p><strong>Nick Stokes</strong>: Warrick, man, what happened?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick Brown</strong>: I left her to hook up with Grissom on that toenail case ... and then, I came back here.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine Willows</strong>: You left Holly solo?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick Brown</strong>: It was just supposed to be an easy print job. Look, I feel bad enough, okay?</p>
<p>(The door to the break room opens and GRISSOM walks in.)</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: Here's what we know. Brass assigned Warrick to shadow Holly on a robbery. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM heads for the coffee pot to pour himself a cup of coffee. In his other hand, he holds the assignment sheets.)</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: He left her at the scene. The suspect returned and Holly was shot. The sheriff phoned me earlier this morning. Brass has been moved back to homicide.</p>
<p><strong>Nick Stokes</strong>: Who's going to run the unit?</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: For now? Me. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: (looking at CATHERINE) I know. We'll just play it by ear, okay? </p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns his head to look at WARRICK and it's the first that we notice that WARRICK is standing way on the other side of the break room, separate from the others.)</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: All right. Last night, a jackpot winner took a swan dive off the Hotel Monaco about the time Holly was shot. I'm going to work the leaper. Nick?</p>
<p><strong>Nick Stokes</strong>: (stands up) Yes, sir.</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: You work the Holly case.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM gives the assignment sheet to NICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine Willows</strong>: Wait a minute. Uh, you-you can't give him the Holly case. I mean, all due respect, Nick. I want this one.</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: Nicky is the only one that didn't have any personal contact with Holly. I don't want you on this, Cath.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine Willows</strong>: Why?</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: Because you're emotionally involved.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine Willows</strong>: Yeah. She was going to walk. I convinced her to stay. If anyone's to blame here, it's me, and I want this case. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE grabs the assignment sheet from NICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine Willows</strong>: Fire me.</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: I'm not firing anybody. Look. I know we're pulling a double. We're on edge 'cause of Holly. I just want everyone to stay calm and to do their jobs for the next ten hours. And as of now we're short of help. So, I'm bringing in Sara Sidle to give us a hand. </p>
<p><strong>Catherine Willows</strong>: Sara Sidle?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick Brown</strong>: Who's that?</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: She's a CSI out of San Francisco. She's a friend of mine, someone I trust. She's going to handle our internal investigation and I want to keep this in-house. I don't want I.A. Involved.</p>
<p>(NICK nods his head.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine Willows</strong>: (shakes her head) Great, that's just what we need, somebody sniffing around.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE leaves the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: Nicky, you can back me up on the D.B. at the Monaco.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM hands the second assignment sheet to NICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick Stokes</strong>: You got it.</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: That's it.</p>
<p>(NICK glances up at WARRICK. He doesn't say anything and leaves the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick Brown</strong>: That's it? What about me?</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: You're on leave. You get some personal time.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick Brown</strong>: I don't want any personal time. I want to help. You're the boss now. You can reinstate me.</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: Go home, Warrick. Get your story straight before Sara gets here.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns to leave the room. Camera holds on WARRICK.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - DAY]</p>

[INT. MARTIN LUTHER KING (MLK) APARTMENTS -- DAY]</p>
<p>(The OFFICER opens the apartment door. CATHERINE walks inside with her kits.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine Willows</strong>: A little late for the brigade.</p>
<p><strong>Officer</strong>: What do you think happened here?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks around.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine Willows</strong>: First blush?</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: JERROD COOPER reaches for his gun tucked in the back waist band of his jeans. In front of him, HOLLY GRIBBS turns and continues to dust for prints near the window.)</p>
<p><strong>Jerrod Cooper</strong>: (muffled) Don't move.</p>

<p>(RED CARLTON walks up to TED SALLENGER.)</p>
<p><strong>Red Carlton</strong>: Hey. You won my money.</p>
<p><strong>Ted Sallenger</strong>: What?</p>
<p><strong>Red Carlton</strong>: That was my machine. I put everything I had in that machine. </p>
<p><strong>Ted Sallenger</strong>: So you're a degenerate. What do you want from me? </p>
<p>(RED CARLTON turns to leave. TED SALLENGER stops him.)</p>
<p><strong>Ted Sallenger</strong>: Hey, old timer, come on, sit down. I'll buy you a drink for second place. What are you having? It's on me.</p>
<p><strong>Red Carlton</strong>: It's on you? All right. In that case, I'll have a, uh ... Amaretto Sour.</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Nick Stokes</strong>: The first hour, you both drank tit for tat but by hour two, Ted started ordering doubles ... and you quit drinking.</p>

<p><strong>Red Carlton</strong>: (cries) I couldn't go through with it. I'm a born failure. I failed at my marriage; I failed at my work. Then I couldn't even commit suicide right. One pull away ... the story of my life.</p>
<p><strong>Gil Grissom</strong>: Mr. Carlton, we're not detectives. We're crime scene analysts. We're trained to ignore verbal accounts and rely instead on the evidence a scene sets before us. But I have to be honest with you, Red ... I believe you. I do.<br />
(pause) So ... here's what we're going to do: You're going to stay here until we get back. If you pushed this guy off the roof he will, without a doubt, have roof dust on his shoes. If he does, we'll have you arrested for murder. But if dust is not present, then you'll be free to go.</p>
<p>(RED CARLTON thinks about it. He smiles a bit.)</p>
<p><strong>Red Carlton</strong>: I like this guy.</p>

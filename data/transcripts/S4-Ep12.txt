<p>COLD OPEN:</p>
<p>[EXT. VARIOUS LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>(Sirens blare in the distance.)</p>
<p>WHITE FLASH TO:</p>
<p>[INT. DEBBIE MARLIN'S RESIDENCE -- NIGHT] </p>
<p>[LIVING ROOM]</p>
<p>(Scene opens on a close up of GRISSOM'S covered feet together as he stands on the side of the room. He cautiously takes a step to the side, hugging the wall as he looks around the silent living room.) </p>
<p>(He takes another cautious step, his flashlight noting the various items in the room - a red lantern floor lamp turned on at the base of the living room counter, the vase full of wilted red roses on the center of the coffee table, two empty and unused wine glasses, a bottle of wine and a wine opener is on the coffee table. On the back table are more candles.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM takes several more cautious steps along the living room wall and faces the long stretch of hallway in front of him. He pauses and shines his flashlight all the way down the hallway carpet. He sees the brush tracks of a vacuum cleaner and on it, one set of normally spaced shoeprints leading away from him, toward the bedroom, and one set of wider spaced shoeprints leading toward him.) </p>
<p>[HALLWAY]</p>
<p>(Careful to hug the hallway wall, GRISSOM cautiously makes his way along the carpet careful not to disturb the shoeprints.) </p>
<p>(He moves along the hallway and shines his flashlight into the first open room door, the spare bedroom, where he sees something red with a tassel hanging from a stand next to a red sofa bed. On the bed is a red blanket, several red pillows, one red pillow with butterflies on it and a white pillow. He moves his flashlight to a wall metal framed shelf with various items with a similar butterfly motif - from a glass case with various butterflies in it to boxes and other small items.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM continues down the hallway toward the master bedroom. He takes another cautious step along the wall toward the end of the hallway. On the hallway floor at the base of the door to the master bedroom is a stack of red candles. He looks at it and moves on.)</p>
<p>[MASTER BEDROOM]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks into the master bedroom. On the bed is a red pillow in the center of the bed; something small and red in the center of the bed. Our eyes catch the red bowl on the dresser at the back of the room and the red blouse hanging in the closet.)</p>
<p>(Hugging the wall, GRISSOM slowly makes his way toward the bathroom.)</p>
<p>[BATHROOM]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM slowly enters the bathroom. The lights are on. The room is large decorated in a white and black checkerboard pattern. He looks around and moves further into the bathroom knowing that the body is there in the shower area. He inches his way around the corner and through the clear shower glass, sees the body of the dark-haired young woman in a pool of blood on the black and white checkerboard floor, the blood as black as the floor itself.)</p>
<p>(She is kneeling face down, her knees tucked under her close to her chest, heels under her bottom and her arms positioned to her side and back, hands near her feet. She's wearing a powder pink spaghetti-strapped top and low-riding blue jeans prominently displaying her red satin and lace thong just under a butterfly tattoo on the small of her back.)</p>
<p>(Her head lies in a large dark-red nearly black pool of blood, forehead barely touching the floor, face turned toward the bathroom entrance with her hair pushed away from her face and clothes.)</p>
<p>(Something catches GRISSOM'S eye. He kneels slowly down to get a closer look at the body.)</p>
<p>(For a long moment, he stares at the woman - slender, young, dark-haired, pale skinned -- transfixed by her familiarity and haunting similarity to someone he knows.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT./EXT. DEBBIE MARLIN'S RESIDENCE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM opens the front door and walks outside where everyone is waiting for him. He steps out onto the front porch and stops, his eyes seeking out and latching onto ... </p>
<p>[GRISSOM'S POV]</p>
<p>(SARA - slender, young, dark-haired, pale skinned -- turns and looks directly at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p>[RESUME POV]</p>
<p>(His gaze doesn't falter.)</p>
<p>(BRASS turns and sees GRISSOM. He steps forward and around SARA toward GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Ready for us?</p>
<p>(Everyone turns to look at GRISSOM waiting for his instructions.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: For now, no one enters this house except CSI.</p>
<p>(BRASS nods.) </p>
<p>(And, as if he can't help it, GRISSOM'S eyes shift to look behind BRASS at ... )</p>
<p>HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[EXT. DEBBIE MARLIN'S RESIDENCE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM hands out assignments.) </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Warrick, you got the car.</p>
<p>(WARRICK turns around to look at the cluster of cars behind him.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Which one?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Both.</p>
<p>(BRASS turns to WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Uh, take the Honda. The VW belongs to the victim's friend, over there.<br />
(He points to the woman talking with the officer in the back.) She called it in.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Aw, that's too bad. This will be a day she'll never forget.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Sara, you take the perimeter.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: What? You just did a one-hour walk-through. The perimeter cannot be a priority.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I need you to work the outside. Catherine and I will be inside.</p>
<p>(Not thrilled, SARA levels GRISSOM a look, then turns to work the perimeter.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I'll go talk to the friend.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Find out where she walked and what she might have touched in there.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM turns to go back to the house while CATHERINE joins BRASS.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hey, Jim.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Yeah?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Did you talk to that guy across the street? </p>
<p>(CATHERINE points to a young man busy talking enthusiastically to a small crowd of neighbors.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: The neighbor? He's on my list.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Yeah, he looks like he has something to say.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE ducks under the tape and makes her way to the friend wearing scrubs, sitting on the gurney while being checked out by the medics.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Hi, I'm Catherine Willows. I'm with the crime lab. What is your name, Miss?</p>
<p><strong>Kelly McNeil</strong>: Kelly McNeil. Deb and I are best friends. We were supposed to get together yesterday. It was our day off.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: You're a nurse?</p>
<p><strong>Kelly McNeil</strong>: Yeah. Both of us. Desert Palm Hospital. We made lunch plans, but she canceled.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: She give a reason why?</p>
<p><strong>Kelly McNeil</strong>: Michael.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Michael?</p>
<p><strong>Kelly McNeil</strong>: Michael Clark. Um, she's been seeing him for a month or so. He's a surgical intern. When she didn't show up for work today, I called the house ... her cell ... no answer, so I drove by after shift.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And how did you get in?</p>
<p><strong>Kelly McNeil</strong>: We have each other's keys.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Did you touch anything inside?</p>
<p><strong>Kelly McNeil</strong>: No. I walked in and ... I saw her and I ran out.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [HALLWAY] The image of KELLY MCNEIL runs through the hallway away from the bedroom toward the exit. Camera moves down to the carpet to show the shoe prints left behind.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Kelly, this, uh, Michael -- is he just a guy, or is he somebody special?</p>
<p><strong>Kelly McNeil</strong>: He was the first guy that Debbie ever blew me off for.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And did you see him today, at the hospital?</p>
<p><strong>Kelly McNeil</strong>: No. I figured they were both playing hooky.</p>
<p>(She looks at CATHERINE.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. SIDE OF THE HOUSE]</p>
<p>(SARA examines the side of the house. She reaches the back gate and sees something. She puts her kit down and runs a black gloved finger on the pavement to show a white powdery film coating the concrete. Thinking, she looks around the area.)</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Pike</strong>: (V.O.) Moved in about two months ago.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. FRONT OF THE HOUSE]</p>
<p>(BRASS interviews the NEIGHBOR.)</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Pike</strong>: ... Single girl. Alone in the house. Got my attention. I'm running for captain of the neighborhood watch. I'll probably have to self-appoint myself, but I'm going to put out a flyer, you know, about shutting doors, locking windows, I mean, the thing is ... you just don't think it's going to happen to you. You know what I'm saying? On your block ...</p>
<p>(BRASS puts up a hand to stop the campaign speech.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Listen, Pike. Stop talking. I never seen somebody so excited about their neighbor being killed.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Pike</strong>: Let me tell you something: I know the business of everyone up and down this block, all right? Who's cheating on his wife, who's behind on his bills, whose kid's going to become the next Manson.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Let's talk about Debbie Marlin.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Pike</strong>: You know what they say about nurses.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: What's that?</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Pike</strong>: (hinting) That-that they like to party. </p>
<p>(BRASS doesn't say anything.)</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Pike</strong>: Hey, look. You see a stethoscope around this chest? No. You want to know why? I'm not a doctor. So I couldn't even get close to her.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, who is getting close?</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Pike</strong>: It's like a fricking doctor auto mall over there. You know, hunky surgeons, board certified, lots of dough. And if you want my opinion, I think they were dropping quarts.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Okay, did you notice any automobiles, any cars out front?</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Pike</strong>: You know, as a matter of fact, sir, yes. Black Mercedes, E320.<br />
2004 model, been there about a month. Rolls in all hours. I'm figuring on call, booty call. That kind of thing.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: When's the last time you saw the Mercedes?</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Pike</strong>: Two days ago. Around lunch. And, uh, I think he stayed for a little bit of dinner, too.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Thanks a lot.</p>
<p>(Finished, BRASS excuses himself and walks away. He takes out his phone and makes a call.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (to phone) Yeah, this is Detective Jim Brass. </p>
<p>(WARRICK, in the meantime is taking photos of the paper grocery bags in the back of the car.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (o.s.) See if you can find a 2004 Mercedes, black, registered to a Michael Clark, M.D. Thanks.</p>
<p>(SARA walks up to WARRICK.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: I have absolutely nothing. How are you doing?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I got a lot. Check out the backseat.</p>
<p>(SARA looks at the grocery bags.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Bananas. Stuffed mushrooms.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Chocolate syrup, a six-pack of soda, a box of condoms.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: No surprises there.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Fresh bag of groceries in an unlocked car?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: (thinking) Maybe she was interrupted.</p>
<p>(SARA turns to look at the house and stares directly at the camera.)</p>
<p>DISSOLVE TO:</p>
<p>[INT. DEBBIE MARLIN'S RESIDENCE - BATHROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(SARA'S face DISSOLVES IN to a close up of DEBBIE MARLIN and her lifeless eyes.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM is kneeling down just outside the shower area to look at the body.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE walks into the bathroom. She looks down at the body, taking it all in. She shakes her head.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (softly) One thing I can never get over with this job: Anything can happen to anybody.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: That's why we're here.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM continues to stare at the body. CATHERINE looks around the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I bet this bathroom was the reason she bought this place.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM notices something and looks around ... sniffs around.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What am I smelling?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Cleanser. Bleach maybe.</p>
<p>(There's blood all over the walls and on the shower glass.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Arterial spray is neck high. Indicates she was standing when she was attacked.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [BATHROOM] DEBBIE MARLIN stands in the shower. Her attacker grabs her from behind, hooking his arm around her shoulders, ripping the knife violently across her neck. Blood sprays on the shower glass.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: And the highest gush of blood has the most volume.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Definite lack of lividity. She must have bled out.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM stands, still staring at the body.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The killer had to get something on him. Had to be a bloody mess, but there's no ... footprints, there's no handprints, no smears.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: She looks like she was placed in this position.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: What's the message?</p>
<p>(GRISSOM doesn't answer her.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. DEBBIE MARLIN'S RESIDENCE - KITCHEN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS]</p>
<p>(The refrigerator door opens. WARRICK and SARA kneel to look at the contents inside.) </p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: What do we got here? Pendale's milk. Non-fat. Half a gallon. Unopened.</p>
<p>(WARRICK takes a photo of the milk.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Groceries that made it inside.</p>
<p>(SARA walks over to the grocery bag on the counter and looks through it taking out items from the bag.)</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Fancy crackers ... brie. Coupons with no receipt.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: No receipt? This milk expires on the 23rd.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Eight days from now.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Milk is delivered daily to the supermarket. That's a ten-day window. People usually reach back for a fresh one. Hmm ... subtract ten from the 23rd?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: She was at Pendale's two days ago.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, according to Brass, that was the last time her boyfriend's car was seen out front.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[BATHROOM] </p>
<p>(CATHERINE works at the sink while GRISSOM sits in the bathtub taking out swabs. He takes a swab of the drain. CATHERINE takes a swab of the drain. She tests it and sticks the red tipped swab in the test tube. GRISSOM tests his swab and places the white tipped swab in the next test tube. He adds liquid to the swab and it turns yellow. CATHERINE continues to test her swabs.) </p>
<p>(GRISSOM holds out the tube rack.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Positive for both.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE'S final swab turns purple.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Same here. So there's blood in all four drains, followed by bleach.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He kills Debbie in the shower. Then he washes up in both sinks and in the tub? Why?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The answer is in the drains.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[UNDER THE HOUSE] </p>
<p>(SARA crawls under the house. She reaches the bathroom pipe under the tub. She takes a wrench and loosens the pipe. Water drips out. She quickly gets a container to get the water as she removes the pipe. She pours the red-stained water into the container and looks at it. She then crawls under the pipe and looks up.) </p>
<p>(Camera zooms forward ... up through the pipe ... and up to the tub drain. Drops of luminol drip through. Camera pushes through the holes in the drain to ... )</p>
<p>[BATHROOM]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM kneels inside the tub spraying luminol around the drain. The lights are off and the area glows. CATHERINE sprays luminol on the bathroom tile around the tub. The tile glows with circular patterned swirls. Finished, CATHERINE looks at the results.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: He cleaned everywhere but inside the shower.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: We're never going to know where the blood ends and the bleach begins.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Where's all this blood coming from?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[EXT. LAS VEGAS CITY (STOCK) - NIGHT]</p>
<p>[INT. DESERT PALM HOSPITAL - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(BRASS interviews VINCENT LURIE about MICHAEL CLARK.)</p>
<p><strong>Vincent Lurie</strong>: Dr. Clark is on my surgical rotation. He was scheduled to assist this morning. No show.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Oh. Was that like him?</p>
<p><strong>Vincent Lurie</strong>: No. It's completely out of character. See, half these interns come in here so scared, they couldn't carve a turkey. I have to give them scalpels with training wheels. Clark was different. He, uh, he's a real artist, a steady hand. Yeah, he has a gift.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: How about outside the O.R.? Was he socially gifted?</p>
<p><strong>Vincent Lurie</strong>: He turned a lot of nurses' heads, but it never interfered with his work. Why the questions?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Debbie Marlin, one of your nurses, was murdered. Throat slashed. You didn't know this? Dr. Clark and his &quot;steady hand&quot; haven't been seen or heard from since, so you don't have to be a brain surgeon to guess what I'm thinking.</p>
<p>(DR. LURIE'S pager beeps. He glances down at it.)</p>
<p><strong>Vincent Lurie</strong>: Uh ... all I can ask is that I ... I hope that you're wrong about Dr. Clark. Excuse me.</p>
<p>(DR. LURIE turns and walks away.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. DEBBIE MARLIN'S RESIDENCE - NIGHT]</p>
<p>(CATHERINE and WARRICK search the cabinets for cleaning supplies. GRISSOM looks around the room.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No cleansers. No rags, no sponges, no paper towels ...</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: You'd think that she restocked when she went shopping.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Well, I'm thinking the killer used everything the victim had.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks into the trash can and finds it empty.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: And then disposed of it.</p>
<p>[EXT. DEBBIE MARLIN'S RESIDENCE - BACK DOOR]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM steps outside. He takes a moment to remove the covers over his shoes. CATHERINE and WARRICK look outside.)</p>
<p>(They step out onto the alley where the trash bins are lined up against the fences on both sides of the road. CATHERINE lifts the lid and checks the nearest bin. WARRICK and GRISSOM spread out to check the other bins.)</p>
<p>(She drops the lid closed.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Nothing.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks across the road and checks the bin. He finds the bin empty.)</p>
<p>(CATHERINE moves to the next bin.)</p>
<p>(WARRICK checks a bin and sees it filled with leaves. He sticks his hand inside to check the contents.)</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks around and notices the flies buzzing around a particular bin.</p>

<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: I think I found the victim's internal organs.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE picks up a bag with a left hand in it.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: This guy meant business.</p>
<p>(She picks up a second bag and examines its contents.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: I think I can confirm the victim's male.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: It seems he vacuumed to remove any trace from the house.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: City picks up the evidence and spreads it all over the dump.</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: We have the victim's clothes. Very neatly folded.</p>
<p>(He puts the clothes aside and picks up a plastic bag with a face in it.)</p>

<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Looks like she had a few &quot;friends&quot; over. A little nurses gone wild.</p>
<p>(SARA looks at GREG; he shrugs at her. She goes back to her filter and lifts off another strand of hair. GREG looks at it.)</p>

<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: That's what I'm thinking.</p>
<p>(ROBBINS touches the head lightly. He moves around the table to the other body.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: You know, I caught a 25-pound yellowtail last year off the coast of Mexico, and it took me half an hour to filet. Dismembering an adult male with this precision and without cutting through the bone, twelve hours minimum.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Half a day. That's patience.</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: The, uh, patella was cleanly removed. And with one slice, the femur was separated from the tibia and the fibula. There's a perverse elegance to this butchery.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh, I'm not so sure I see it that way. A killer with knowledge of anatomy whose tool is a scalpel. I think the butcher was a doctor.</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So, he kills her and whoever she was with, and then he hops a plane?</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: Well, it seems like that. You know what they say down at P.D. The quickest way to get a car stolen is to leave it at the airport unlocked.</p>
<p>(WARRICK easily opens the unlocked door.)</p>
<p><strong>Warrick</strong>: See what I mean?</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Who doesn't know that?</p>
<p>(SARA opens the passenger door and they both check out the front seat.)</p>

<p>(GRISSOM is on the other end of the phone listening to GREG'S report.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (from phone) So, um, most of our efforts have been towards identifying another victim.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Michael Clark. But can we place him dead at the house? </p>
<p>(GRISSOM stands at the bedroom doorway looking at the bathroom.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Greg, what else can you tell us about that hair?</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: (from phone) You mean hairs? There were two. Ancillary, maybe arm or leg hair.</p>
<p><strong>Sara</strong>: Found it in the tub drain.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM heads for the bathroom.)</p>

<p><strong>Sara</strong>: So all the violence took place in the bathroom, at least anything that had to do with blood.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM steps into the bathroom and turns to look at the shower.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The bathroom is big, but it's not big enough to kill two at the same time.</p>

<p>(Finished, CATHERINE hands the card to JACQUI FRANCO who manually compares prints right there in the room. THE DOCTOR stands and leaves. HOWARD TRIPTON takes a seat to take his prints.)</p>
<p><strong>Howard Tripton</strong>: Listen, I've got a patient waiting in pre-op.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We'll have you out in a minute. We appreciate you providing your prints voluntarily.</p>
<p><strong>Howard Tripton</strong>: Well, there's probably a little bit of a lot of us in Debbie's house.</p>
<p>(JACQUI looks up.)</p>
<p><strong>Jacqui Franco</strong>: Oh, we'll know soon enough.</p>
<p>(CATHERINE finishes with the prints.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: (to the surgeon) Thank you.</p>
<p>(VINCENT LURIE walks over to BRASS.)</p>
<p><strong>Vincent Lurie</strong>: You understand, right? The police aren't the only ones with a code of honor. Now, some of these men are married, and if this gets out ...</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Nothing gets out unless it needs to get out.</p>
<p>(In the background, JACQUI finishes and looks at CATHERINE.)</p>
<p><strong>Jacqui Franco</strong>: Got a match.</p>
<p>(She points at the print sample and the print card.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Dr. Tripton.</p>
<p>(HOWARD TRIPTON looks up.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: I'm afraid your patient in pre-op is going to have to wait a little while longer.</p>
<p>(Camera holds on HOWARD TRIPTON.)</p>
<p>FADE OUT.</p>
<p>(COMMERCIAL BREAK)</p>
<hr />
<p>FADE IN.</p>
<p>[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM] </p>
<p>(HOWARD TRIPTON takes a sip from his cup. BRASS and CATHERINE interview him.) </p>
<p><strong>Howard Tripton</strong>: Don't really know why I'm here.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Your toe print was found in Debbie Marlin's house.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Same house she was murdered in.</p>
<p><strong>Howard Tripton</strong>: Her car was in the shop, and I gave her a ride home one night, and she invited me in for a cup of coffee. She didn't like anyone wearing shoes in the house. Some Feng Shui thing.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, you Feng Shui-ed your way to the bed?</p>
<p><strong>Howard Tripton</strong>: She was provocative. You take your coat off, she has her clothes off. She came on to me.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [BEDROOM] DEBBIE grabs TRIPTON'S shirt and pulls him toward her.)</p>
<p><strong>Debbie Marlin</strong>: Come on, doc, let's do it.</p>
<p>(She flips over onto her stomach.)</p>
<p><strong>Debbie Marlin</strong>: Take a look.</p>
<p>(He lifts up her shirt to look at her butterfly tattoo.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: They're in bed; DEBBIE'S straddled on TRIPTON. She's wearing a sheer cover; her arms are outstretched with the silk ties in her hands sort of looks like butterfly wings. Oh, yeah, they're doing it - no more needed here.)</p>
<p>(Close up of TRIPTON'S toes against the bed frame.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: All right, well, let's talk about what's not open to interpretation. Yours were the only prints found in the house.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Michael Clark was on your rotation -- he was on your surgical team the day he was killed. You called in sick. Surgery was cancelled. Freed him up to be with Debbie, who also had the day off. What luck.</p>
<p><strong>Howard Tripton</strong>: My son had a ball game. My daughter was at a swim meet. My wife was at a conference, and the surgery was elective. Not a stretch.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Your wife know about you and Debbie?</p>
<p><strong>Howard Tripton</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: She asked for s*x, right? She also asked for the bracelet, too, huh?</p>
<p>(CATHERINE puts the bag with the butterfly charm on the table.)</p>
<p><strong>Howard Tripton</strong>: No, but ... I gave it to her. (He points.) This one. </p>
<p>(CATHERINE picks it up.)</p>
<p><strong>Howard Tripton</strong>: She loved butterflies. Uh, I figured if I gave something special to her, she'd give something special to me.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Hmm. So it was a long-term relationship?</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - DNA LAB]</p>
<p>[SCOPE VIEW] of a hair strand</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: That's the hair from the spare bedroom.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM lifts his head from the scope.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: There's an oily film on the surface of the hair.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Propylene glycol. Active ingredient in rogaine for male pattern baldness. Personally, I don't use the stuff, but my grandfather, Papa Olaf -- he was Bruce Willis at age 16. Lucky for me, baldness comes from the mother's side, so I'm safe ... </p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Greg, please, I'm very tired.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: Well, maybe the guy we're looking for is going bald ... or trying not to. According to Papa Olaf, a lot of guys who use rogaine also use propecia, kind of like a cocktail. I ran the hair through massspec. I got four peaks: Ethyl alcohol, propylene glycol, minoxidil, and finasteride.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM looks at the test results.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Finasteride, the chemical name for propecia.</p>
<p><strong>Greg</strong>: But wait, there's more, and it's a family secret. Sexual. Happens in less than two percent of users. (whispers) Papa Olaf was one of those guys that needed hydraulics.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM thinks about it, shakes his head, then leaves the lab.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - HALLWAY -- CONTINUOUS] </p>
<p>(CATHERINE looks into the break room. She's looking for GRISSOM. GRISSOM turns the corner; CATHERINE turns and sees him.) </p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Oh.</p>
<p>(GRISSOM walks up to her.)</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: The prodigal CSI returns. You get any sleep?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Not yet.</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: So, uh, Brass had to let Dr. Tripton go. The old s*x alibi. Too bad he didn't leave a toe print on a scalpel blade.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You got a take on him?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Balloon head, but credible ... like most adulterers.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Is he going bald?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Grey hair?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Anything else?</p>
<p><strong>Catherine</strong>: He's a lefty.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. CSI - FORENSIC AUTOPSY]</p>
<p>(TOP VIEW of MICHAEL CLARK'S body put together from the pieces found in the trash cans. ROBBINS goes over his findings with GRISSOM.) </p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Okay, keep in mind, this is just a theory. It's a hot button issue among forensic pathologists.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: What's the consensus?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Most doctors say it's impossible to prove handedness based on the wounds inflicted on a victim.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Forget hard science. What's your hypothesis?</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: Based on micro-incisions and hesitation marks, the victim was lying face up when he was killed. Take a look at the right knee.</p>
<p>(ROBBINS turns the knee over to show GRISSOM the cut. Camera zooms in close for a really good look at the cut.)</p>
<p><strong>Robbins</strong>: The cut on the cartilage of the right distal femur has slight angulations from the, uh ... left distal to the right proximal, which suggests the killer was left-handed. This angulation is consistent with cuts made to the acetabulum and to the wrist, but bear in mind, it's not going to be admissible in court.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I don't care about court. My mind's on a left-handed, propecia-using surgeon who's probably on staff at Desert Palm.</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. DESERT PALM HOSPITAL]</p>
<p>(The older doctors who fit the required description sit in a single row as GREG uses the ALS on their heads. He starts with the first doctor and goes one by one down the row of men. Finally, he finds the match.)</p>
<p>CUT TO:<br />
[INT. POLICE DEPARTMENT - INTERVIEW ROOM]</p>
<p>(GRISSOM and BRASS question VINCENT LURIE while his LAWYER is with them.)</p>
<p><strong>Vincent Lurie</strong>: There was no need for the light show. All you had to do was ask.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Good. Since we're being completely honest ... are you losing your hair?</p>
<p><strong>Vincent Lurie</strong>: I'm a 48-year-old man. I'm not unique.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Your hair is, though. (He holds up the bagged evidence.) We found it at the crime scene. Minoxidil absorbs infrared light.</p>
<p><strong>Vincent Lurie</strong>: I-I take rogaine and propecia. Again, not unique.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Well, we think that Debbie Marlin and Michael Clark were killed by a surgeon who is left-handed, and we know of two left-handed surgeons at Desert Palm: Dr. Tripton, who has an alibi, and you.</p>
<p><strong>Vincent Lurie</strong>: Well, if you're going to make accusations, you should really do your homework. Howard and I are the only lefties on staff. Dr. Randolph, who has privileges at the hospital, he's also a lefty. We play tennis every Wednesday. He's got a heck of a back-hand. (BRASS nods.) If you want me to name more names, I could, but you don't want me to do your job for you, do you?</p>
<p><strong>Lawyer</strong>: Gentlemen ... we're here as a courtesy, so if you're quite through wasting our time, I think that the doctor would like to get back to the business of saving lives.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: Not so fast. Is this a link from a bracelet you gave Debbie?</p>
<p>(He puts on his glasses.) </p>
<p><strong>Vincent Lurie</strong>: Mm-hmm. It looks like it. Where's the rest of it?</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: This link was vacuumed from the floor of the spare bedroom after the murder. The other link was in her jewelry box. The funny thing is that all the bracelets from the other guys she slept with are intact.</p>
<p><strong>Vincent Lurie</strong>: Well, all I can tell you is when I gave it to her, it was in one piece.</p>
<p>(LURIE puts a hand on his LAWYER'S arm to get his attention; they confer for a moment. The LAWYER turns back to BRASS and GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Lawyer</strong>: Do you have any other evidence?</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: No, we don't.</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: We might not have any other evidence, but we have a theory.</p>
<p><strong>Lawyer</strong>: That's not admissible in court.</p>
<p><strong>Vincent Lurie</strong>: (indulgently) Oh, no, no, it's worth a listen.</p>
<p>(BRASS stands up and walks over to LURIE.)</p>
<p><strong>Brass</strong>: (quietly) We think you killed Debbie Marlin because she rejected you, and Michael Clark paid the price.</p>
<p>(LURIE smile and chuckles a bit.)</p>
<p><strong>Lawyer</strong>: Thank you for your time and your theories, but you said it yourself: You don't have a case. (he turns to LURIE) Doctor.</p>
<p>(VINCENT LURIE and the LAWYER stand up and head for the door. The LAWYER holds the door open for LURIE. Before he can leave, GRISSOM stops him.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (quietly) It's sad, isn't it, doc? Guys like us. Couple of middle-aged men who've allowed their work to consume their lives.</p>
<p>(Although he doesn't turn to look at GRISSOM, he's listening.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: The only time we ever touch other people is when we're wearing our latex gloves.</p>
<p>(LURIE turns to look at GRISSOM.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: We wake up one day and realize that for fifty years we haven't really lived at all. But then, all of a sudden ... we get a second chance. </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [DAY OF THE MURDER] DEBBIE MARLIN rushes out to the living room carrying a wine bottle and two glasses. She puts them on the table.)</p>
<p>(She lights the candles on the table, then turns and rushes down the hallway to light the other candles. Camera moves and we see a figure standing in the doorway watching her.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) Somebody young and beautiful shows up. Somebody ... </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: ... we could care about. She offers us a new life with her ... ... but we have a big decision to make, right? Because we have to risk everything we've worked for in order to have her. </p>
<p>(GRISSOM'S eyes move off of LURIE and his words turn introspective.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: I couldn't do it ...</p>
<p>(He refocuses on LURIE; their eyes meet.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: ... but you did. You risked it all ... </p>
<p>(LURIE looks away, unable to hold GRISSOM'S knowing gaze.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: ... and she showed you a wonderful life, didn't she? But then she took it away and gave it to somebody else, ... </p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [BEDROOM] LURIE sits on the bed as DEBBIE MARLIN ends their relationship. LURIE buries his head in his hands.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: (V.O.) ... and you were lost. </p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: So you took her life.</p>
<p>(Quick flashback to: [BATHROOM] DEBBIE lights the candles in the shower. LURIE grabs her from behind, she gasps. He slashes her throat, blood sprays on the shower wall.)</p>
<p>(Cut to: [SPARE BEDROOM] LURIE, hands bloodied, picks up the butterfly bracelet from the box on the shelf. He rips the bracelet apart in anguish; the charms fall onto the carpet. He stands there, his head in his hands.)</p>
<p><strong>Michael Clark</strong>: (o.s.) Debbie, it's me, Michael.</p>
<p>(LURIE hears MICHAEL and quickly bends down, hastily picking up the links off the carpet. He misses one.)</p>
<p><strong>Michael Clark</strong>: (o.s.) Debbie?</p>
<p>(Cut to: [BATHROOM] VINCENT LURIE stands in the doorway looking at DEBBIE positioned in the shower. He turns around and we see MICHAEL CLARK dead, throat slashed, lying in the tub.)</p>
<p>(End of flashback. Resume to present.)</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: You killed them both, and now you have nothing.</p>
<p><strong>Vincent Lurie</strong>: (nods) I'm still here.</p>
<p><strong>Grissom</strong>: Are you?</p>
<p>(VINCENT LURIE turns and walks out of the interview room, his LAWYER following behind him.)</p>
<p>[OBSERVATION ROOM VIEW]</p>
<p>(Through the glass, SARA watches GRISSOM sitting at the interview table, her image reflected in the glass. Just how long she's been standing there, how much she's heard, is anyone's guess.)</p>
<p>(Camera refocuses on SARA.)</p>
<p>(Although by the look on her face, we suspect she's heard it all. She watches as GRISSOM shakes his head and lowers it. BRASS walks out of the room leaving GRISSOM alone at the table while SARA watches him.)</p>
<p>FADE TO BLACK</p>
<p><strong>End</strong></p>

I want that little twerp Zarco found and locked up.
Vincent Lafoon. This is my brother Mason. We own this place.
Oliver Zarco. He used to work here. He had a thing for Weatherly, and then he got hurt, blamed it on us, went a little nuts.
He was the one who sent the flowers and the note.
Three times. He's your guy.
Yeah, only on the exterior, but the video system's been on the fritz lately.
Oh, good.  Look, just find Zarco, okay?
Hey, you're making a big mistake; you got the wrong dude.
But I didn't do anything. Why would I kill Weatherly? She was my company's best asset. Plus, I liked her. She was my friend.
That's him. That's Zarco. That's your guy.
Where's he going?
You're letting him go? Are you out of your mind?
But I'm the one getting set up here, me! Don't let him go--

You may be seated.
Sir, please take a seat.
Take a seat now or I'll have you removed from this courtroom and charged with contempt.
You are now in contempt of court. Bailiff?
I apologize for the disruption. Let's proceed.  You may be seated, Miss. You can leave this court when it has concluded its business. Or find yourself in contempt along with your friend.
Where are you from?
I'm not who you think I am. Local police have been out here twice this past year about this man -- Paul Millander, is it? Every time his story's in the paper. I've heard I look like him.
You've heard of the doppelganger syndrome?
Do you believe in it?
A swiss neurobiologist recently published papers supporting its viability. Brugger, I think his name is. Stands to reason this Millander is my doppelganger. The monkey wrench for you is that we're both here in the State of Nevada.
You know, if you keep that up people are going to start calling you crazy. Guard.
I trust you won't go near my courtroom again. 
Before you go back to Las Vegas why don't you come to dinner. I tell my wife stories about my day and this one she may need to hear in person. Six o'clock.  That's my address. We live right here in Mulberry.

Nick? Greg?
Kids were out here drinking beer, found the dead dogs. Patrol unit came, responded and found the female DB.
Did they leave the party together?
Do you remember what time that was?
Could you be more specific, Doc?
And the kids called in the dead dogs around 2:00.
I'll talk to the husband. I'll keep you posted.
You went home without your wife. Why?
Do you always leave your wife on the dance floor?
Your wife was murdered last night.
Mr. Rodriguez, this is CSI Sanders. He's here to take your fingerprints and your clothes.
Mr. Rodriguez, stand up.
When we're finished here, we'll talk about it. Stand up, please.
Keep an eye on him.
Well, Mr. Aquino ...
Look, you or any of your homies hang out at the Rodriguez Outreach Center?
Tell him to meet you downtown.
If I were you, I'd save my money and start talking.
Did you forget about the camera when you killed Elizabeth Rodriguez?
That makes you an accessory.
You seriously want us to believe that Mrs. Rodriguez, humanitarian of the year, was into dog fighting?
LVPD! Polic√≠a! Freeze! Nadie se mueve! Manos arriba! 
Hands in the air!
Don't even think about it. Let me guess. You found your dog.
Ya basta, Gino. We have a witness who says you killed Elizabeth Rodriguez because she cheated you out of 50 Gs.
One way or another, Gino, you're not going to see the streets for quite a while.
Mr. Rodriguez. Tienes tiempo?
Yes, sir. Tommy Halpert. We have him in custody now.
What did Elizabeth say when you confronted her?

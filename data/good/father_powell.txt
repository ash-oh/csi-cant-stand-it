Gil Grissom?
Benjamin's a member of my parish. The officer won't let me talk to him. He said you were in charge.
He needs spiritual guidance.
Ah ... then you'd have no problem with my talking to him.
Eleventh hour?
Can you think of a better time?
H-hello? Mr. Grissom?
Uh ... they told me out front I'd find you here.
Priest's collar. People trust it.  Most people. Even ... lapsed catholics.
First time we met, you called me 'Father.' Only Romans do that. Everybody else, it's 'Reverend' or 'Minister.' I wanted to know how your investigation against Ben is going.
I didn't come here to tamper with your evidence. 
He was a good kid, all through school still comes to mass every Sunday. If he has a problem ... it's trying to please people.
It can be.
He wouldn't do this.
'To whom much is given, much will be expected.'
I leave you to your work.
I tried to help ... without breaking my vows.
After the 'sin'.
Some call it a 'vocation'.
Someday, we won't need jails.
I celebrate mass every Thursday night, 7:00.
You don't believe?
Even if they're handed down by God?
Fanaticism. Not religion.
You still suffer like a catholic.
Light bulb goes out other people fix it, get a new one. Light bulb goes out for the Catholic he stands in the dark says, 'What did I do wrong?'

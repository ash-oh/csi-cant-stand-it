Now, how long is this gonna take? I'm losing business because of you.
Oh, contaminate, my ass! What the hell difference does it make? You ain't gonna catch 'em. You never do.
This is my popsicle stand -- I'll defend it to the hilt if I have to!
What? We're getting robbed again now?
And I'm Lesley Stahl. Look, let's forget the formalities. Which one of you people's gonna clean my counter here?
Ow!
Okay, okay, okay, they took my good vodkas, my single-malt whiskies, they took vermouth, cognac, VSOP cognac. Am I going to get any of the stuff back? What are you guys going to do about this?
All right, you know what? Just let me know when you're ready.
Okay, I can do that. These creeps come flying in here -- they take a lot of my good stuff. And I chased one of them and I snatched the sweater right off his back.
I don't know. There was a bunch.
Closer to the ten.
They had hoods on. They were hooded.
He was on his way out the door. What I did see was really weird. Anyway.
I don't know. His face. His nose was all deformed. The whole thing creeped me out.

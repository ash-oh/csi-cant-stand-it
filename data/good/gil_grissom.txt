Gentlemen ...
You think so, huh?
Pupa, stage three.
It's the third stage of larva metamorphosis. This guy's been dead seven days. 
I think we may have our suicide note.
We're so sorry about this, Ms. Harmon. I can only imagine how difficult this must be for you.
Hi.
Sorry. Welcome to Forensics. Gil Grissom. I'm your supervisor on graveyard.
Thanks.  Would you mind taking off your jacket and rolling up your sleeve?
I need a pint of your blood. It's customary for all new hires.
So many reasons.
We scrutinize the crime scene, collect the evidence recreate what happened without ever having been there. 
Pretty cool, actually.
Of course you do. Then if you'll just sign these waivers for personal injury or death while in the line of duty, we can begin our shift.
What's the matter?
Sit down, sit down. You're probably low on blood sugar. I've got just the thing.
Here, try one of these.
Think you got through to her?
You got to breathe through your ears, Gribbs.
You see, if the victim had extended his arms like ... here, I'll show you. Give me your hands.
And pushed the trigger with his thumbs, like so ...
The wound would look like this.
Are you okay?
Eight hours.
It's okay, Holly, it's all right.
You assholes!!
There.
You know, my first robbery solved was a store like this. When we caught the guy, the owner was so happy that he gave me a dozen farm fresh eggs out of his cooler.
Yes, I am. How am I doing?
Good. Okay, look, this was a routine robbery. Dust for prints, check the videotape take lots of fun photos. I'll be back in about an hour to pick you up.
If you get done early use channel seven on your walkie.
Blunt force trauma case. Bermuda hills country club. Pregnant wife caught her husband in bed with another girl. What do you think? Malicious intent?
It's coming. 
The new girl's. Would you like to donate?
How'd the follow-up go with the husband? Boe tells me you were onto something.
You believe him?
You ever see the movie 'The Exorcist'?
The old priest and Father Karras are about to exorcise the demon. Father Karras explains that he's recorded the little girl's voice and he's broken down the spirit into three distinct personalities. But the old priest quickly corrects him -- 'there is only one.'
Forget about the husband, Warrick. Forget about the assumptions. Forget about your promotion. These things will only confuse you. Concentrate on what cannot lie -- the evidence. Follow ... the reason we're having this conversation.
What are those red particles?
From what?
That chemical's found in cooking spray isn't it? 
If latex rubber and cooking spray went on a blind date, how would the night end?
I know, Pink Floyd's not your thing.
I just thought it'd be something different.
How long till we get a hit?
'Pin you against a wall?'
We've got a name on the suicide case, sir. He's local.
Oh, I ... hi, Sergeant. Would you mind if I, uh ... ?
Hi, Mr. Millander.  My name's Gil Grissom.
Do you have any hobbies? Make model airplanes, make toys wind chimes for the backyard, that sort of thing?
Well, we found some particles of latex on your thumbprint. Would you have any reason to have access to that particular substance?
Wow, you made all these?
Excellent work. These seem very real.
You ever make any rubber hands?
These are your prints.
It means you're free to go. He's not the guy.
This explains the latex and the lecithin.
You need oil to make a print.
Anyone who purchased one of these hands could be the killer ...
We're ruling out suicide. The evidence leads us to believe that it was in fact a homicide.
I believe so.
We'll find him, Ms. Harmon. I promise you. There is always a clue. I'll find it.
That's enough, Warrick. Let's go!
Yes, you had him and the minute you started thinking about yourself instead of the case, you lost him. There is no room for subjectivity in this department, Warrick. You know that. We handle each case objectively without presupposition regardless of race, color, creed, or bubble gum flavor. 
Okay?
Morning. Gil Grissom, forensics. I'm taking over the case for Warrick Brown. Mind if I come in?
I need to give you a pedicure.
I have a warrant for your toenails.
A statement's just a public record of your version. We still need proof.
May I see where you discarded the clippings?
May I see your toilet? 
I'll be right back. 
Excuse me.
Nope, loser. Give me the next item up for bid.
No, striation. Whenever two objects are broken there occurs what we call striae -- two unique connecting points. If I can match the nail in the sneaker to the suspect's clippings ... 
Alcatraz!
Uh-huh!
Careful, Boe, you'll hurt your back.
Warrick, come in.
It's Grissom. We got him.
Hey, weren't you supposed to be shadowing Holly?
Congratulations, Nickie, my boy. You are now a C.S.I. Level 3.
Hi, sorry. Welcome to Forensics. Gil Grissom, I'm your supervisor on grayayard.
That's enough. Warrick, let's go!
The minute you started thinking about yourself instead of the case, you lost him.
Congratulations, Nicky, my boy. You are now a C.S.I. Level three.
Weren't you supposed to be shadowing holly?
All right, the minute you hear anything on Holly Gribbs's condition I want you to page me. 
All right? Bye.
So he pulled a 'Louganis', huh?
Coincidence. I worked those four cases. There was never any evidence of foul play. Was he in town with anybody?
Not yet. Right now, I want to talk to him.
I let him talk to me, actually. 
In fact, he just spoke. Didn't you hear him? He just told me that he didn't commit suicide.
This guy fell to his death wearing prescription eyeglasses. Jumpers take their glasses off. Suicide is the ultimate form of selfishness, Detective. It's unlikely that anyone cowardly enough to take his own life would be brave enough to watch his own death.
You have no idea.
Messages?
I just got off the phone with the Sheriff. He says he wants me to run the unit.
Where are they going to place you?
Cop versus scientist. Interesting, huh?
You got any advice for me? 
Here's what we know. Brass assigned Warrick to shadow Holly on a robbery. 
He left her at the scene. The suspect returned and Holly was shot. The sheriff phoned me earlier this morning. Brass has been moved back to homicide.
For now? Me. 
I know. We'll just play it by ear, okay? 
All right. Last night, a jackpot winner took a swan dive off the Hotel Monaco about the time Holly was shot. I'm going to work the leaper. Nick?
You work the Holly case.
Nicky is the only one that didn't have any personal contact with Holly. I don't want you on this, Cath.
Because you're emotionally involved.
I'm not firing anybody. Look. I know we're pulling a double. We're on edge 'cause of Holly. I just want everyone to stay calm and to do their jobs for the next ten hours. And as of now we're short of help. So, I'm bringing in Sara Sidle to give us a hand. 
She's a CSI out of San Francisco. She's a friend of mine, someone I trust. She's going to handle our internal investigation and I want to keep this in-house. I don't want I.A. Involved.
Nicky, you can back me up on the D.B. at the Monaco.
That's it.
You're on leave. You get some personal time.
Go home, Warrick. Get your story straight before Sara gets here.
Geez, these look like defensive wounds, maybe.
You have any idea what it might be?
Not just glass ...
... black glass.
Blood drops, leading to ... bloody towels. No effort to hide.
Champagne bottle. Black glass. I missed that.
You're C.S.I. three, now. You call it.
You've read the woman's statement. The room is full of evidentiary clues. 
Talk it out. What does the room say?
And then what happened?
And he never came back to the room?
You sure? The Presidential Suite at the Hotel Monaco is a secured room. They keep a log. Every time someone enters with a card key ...
Nicky, what does the log say?
Yes, ma'am. 
Her story checks out.
She doesn't have any financial motive. She was his girlfriend, not his wife. Any money won by the deceased goes directly to the family estate.
The roof.
Okay, I think we're ready for Operation Norman.
You'll never get that off. It's Meyer's roof dust. All the hotels use it now. It diverts the sun's rays. Keeps the utility bills down in the summer.
It's our job to know stuff.
All right, Nick, standing by for Operation Norman. Let him fly.
Yes, yes.
Norman 'pushed'.
Norman 'jumped'.
Norman 'fell'.
I don't even have to turn around. Sara Sidle.
How? Computer simulation? No thanks. I'm a scientist I like to see it. Newton dropped the apple, I drop dummies.
Exactly. And this guy was pushed.
She's still in surgery. She's not doing very well.
God, Sara, I have so many unanswered 'why's.
There's our jumper.
Please.
Wait a minute. Go back. 
Could I see the person that was sitting at this machine right before the victim?
Is there any way of telling how long he was sitting there?
Nick, call the slot host. Get this guy's name from the slot card. I'm going to talk to this man.
Thank you.
Hold this. I think I'll play a little.
You're under arrest.
First-degree murder.
Roof dust.
Nicky, my boy, collect my winnings. It's a C.S.I. three initiation.
At 1:27 A.M. Our victim, Ted Sallenger, made a couple of purchases in the gift shop--
... band-aids and antiseptic. At 1:40 A.M ...
... we tracked a purchase at the la promenade--
... a $30,000 designer watch. 
At 1:45 A.M., you both started knocking them back in the hotel bar.
Drank decaf coffee instead. My guess is that you were getting him lathered up for your little elevator ride.
And from there, you went to the roof.
Mr. Carlton, we're not detectives. We're crime scene analysts. We're trained to ignore verbal accounts and rely instead on the evidence a scene sets before us. But I have to be honest with you, Red ... I believe you. I do.
I know. I wanted to. In case you need me.
Fifteen seconds, you're in, you're out we make a DNA match and it's over, okay?
You're too young to remember who Red Skelton was.
I thought so. Turns out he's red herring. There's got to be something else. 
Nice watch.
Look at this. 
These look like fibers.
Maybe.
Get a hold of the girl while you're at it.
She is now.
What the hell is that?
Was this first blow?
Nice swatch, Nick. Pizza box-sized.
Grissom. 
I'm starting to get that feeling, Nicky, my boy.
Listen, I'll meet you at the interrogation. I still got one more thing I want to check.
Okay, I'm ready to try this now.
Did your security log record that?
Gotcha.
Capital murder.
I never kid about murder. What do you think, Nick? My turn to play it 'blind'?
Now, the funny thing is if Ted didn't come back to the room then why were presidential carpet fibers found in the band of his brand-new watch? 'Cause he did come back. 
And you do the smart thing: After you throw him over the balcony you cleaned up the crime scene. You left blood-soaked towels in plain sight. Your alibi? The blood came from Ted's forearms.
How am I doing so far, Nicky?
According to your statement, you felt slighted 'cause Ted had just won $40 million and dumped you within half an hour giving you motive enough to kill him and you exercised that motive.
Deputy, we're going to have her arrested.
Maybe.
Your boyfriend told me.
I'll see you outside, okay?
They say I have to let you go. You violated the policies and procedures for clearing a scene. I read Sara's report.
I'm sorry, too. I don't want to do this.
I think I have a pretty good idea.
It never occurred to me, either.
You know what? If I let you go I got to let me go, too. 
Let's go home.

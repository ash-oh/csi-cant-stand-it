Eddie.
Where were you?
I called you a million times! What are you talking about? Why didn't you answer your phone?
A trail of tears / it takes me back to all my fears... 
I hate this! This sucks! Okay?
Where is Eddie? I need Eddie here.
Can I have a little privacy, please? Would you go in there and learn how to do your job? It sounds terrible in there, anyways.
Eddie's my manager. It's no big secret. We were supposed to be working last night, and the jerk blew me off.
No.
Oh, uh ... I got, uh ... um ... because, uh ...
It all happened so fast, you know? One minute I was, I was just outside getting some air and thinking, you know? And then... the next, my manager is stumbling towards me, bleeding.
Eddie! Oh, my god! I'll get you in the car. 
Everything's going to be okay, honey. Okay, don't be afraid.
Not really. When you're intimate with somebody, you can't imagine life without them. We were partners. I loved him. I thought I was going to die.
That's what I meant, you know? I thought we were all going to die.
I tried to get Eddie out. He was unconscious, and that ... that kid kept screaming ... and ... the current was really strong and we got swept downstream. What was I supposed to do?
I am just one person. Eddie is my priority, not that ... that stupid, screaming little brat.
I tried, I ... 
You saw that. She threatened me! I want a lawyer.
Kiner is a drug dealer.
No. Not anymore. Eddie got me off all that stuff.
I tried to call Eddie. He had his phone off. He was with his pain-in-the-ass daughter and that psycho ex-wife of his. I was just alone in front of a microphone with my whole career riding on a demo.
It's none of your business.
I thought Eddie wasn't coming. I guess he was just late.

Everyone I sleep with dies.
I slept with this sailor once when I was fourteen. He died overseas somewhere.
There was no relationship. I barely knew him.
He invited me for the weekend. I figured as long as he didn't chop me up I'd have some fun.
Mind if I smoke?
Man, I wish I knew what you were talking about.
I wasn't even there.
Home. In the bathroom.
I'm out of here.
As long as you're the one doing them.
I lent it to my boyfriend.
You know, you have this whole Lenny Kravitz thing going on. I'm not one for brothers, but ... damn.
Keith Driscoll.
Told you I was clean.
Boss?
Only if I eat. Releases gastric acids, blah, blah, blah...
Well, you see, the thing with me is I'm mind over matter. I can imagine a hamburger, and I'm full. Will you fill me up, Warrick?
Are they arresting me? 
I have a place. 
Keith and I do. We share everything.
No, I'm not.
How'd you find me?
It's true.
No, dad. I was never there. Never.
Dad, it's way too late. I got to catch a flight to Jersey. Midnight. Mom says that I can stay with her for awhile.
Thanks. I'm taking the shuttle.
What do you mean consent was given? Nobody has asked my consent to do anything, and I'm his daughter.
Look, I'm just here to see my father, okay? He's a cop. 
What?
So I guess you're the one who's in charge. How long is his surgery going to take?
Look, I just got off a bus, I would really like to take a shower and change and maybe get a little rest. Do you have the keys to his house?
Well, you're a cop, right? How 'bout you just let me in?
Do you want to check my arms?  Go ahead. All right? It looks like Daddy already told you all about me. I don't even know why I bothered to come.
Yeah. How's he doing?
You think so?
Yeah, you mean I don't look like a crack whore anymore?
Does he ever talk about me?  That's a no.
Yeah, well, thanks for clearing that up for me.
Yeah, I can read.
Why?
Oh, wow.
That's like loving a puppy. That's easy. You know, did you ever think that maybe he's better off just lying there and not waking up? A lot easier.

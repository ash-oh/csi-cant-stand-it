Hi. I'm Rebecca.
But you know, I don't think that matters much anymore.
Yeah.
What were you expecting? White light, puffy clouds?
So how'd you get here, anyway?
You were murdered.
Well, not me. I got into more train wreck relationships than I can count. And then I met Gavin.
He was a great guy. And then I fell ... I fell hard.
Gavin, what are you doing? Gav ... wait ... No! No!
Wait! No - Oh, my God ...
I finally found a guy who liked me for my brains. Turns out he thought I didn't have any.
No.
So, how'd you get here?
So after all that, how can you be happy?
No, you guys, we're gonna be here a long time. Let's just try to keep it pleasant, okay?

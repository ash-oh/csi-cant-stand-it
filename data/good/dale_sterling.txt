Mr. Grissom. Dr. Dale Sterling. I sent you the head. How can I help?
Oh. 
He's dead. You're authorized.
I was in the 99th percentile on the MCATs. I could have gone to med school. I chose to be a vet.
Doris. We were married. High school sweethearts. Didn't work out. 
I know how to cut. I could ... I could do the autopsy right here. 
No wallet and no ID.
What have you got there?
Well, he wasn't tied up?
Well, no one just lets themselves get buried alive.
Well, maybe the hole was dug earlier?
Maybe the victim was drugged.
That's right.
I sent it off to a lab in Reno. Still waiting for the results.
Man. It was one hell of day. You need a place to sleep?
Uh ... okay.
M-m-may be not the best job in the world, but it does the trick.
Think so.
Okay. I'll have to go check.
Just got the blood test results back from Sylvia's dog. There were traces of GHB in his system. I thought GHB was a party drug.
Uh, weed and speed are the drugs of choice around here.
That is cat hair. 
Tricolored. Probably ... abyssinian.
One.
Uh ... ah. Here she is. Isis.
Her owner has allergies. He needed an aggressive, shorthair mouser.
Hey ... you have a phone call. Line two. I think it's your wife.
Oh, yeah, that's Leland's boy. You guys going to tell him about his dad?

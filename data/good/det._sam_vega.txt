We get a couple of shootings a week here from the snakebacks, out of a four-block radius from this point here. Usually at the pepper street gang. Your guy might have left the neighborhood as part of a gang initiation. It means more when the victim's a civilian.
That's the quickest warrant I ever got.
She does. They both do. He just stays here when he's working.
Police officer.
Mr. Braun, uh, where do you live?
And you work here? 
Hey, Jim. Got these from the cage.
What was your relationship to Vincent Avery?
You knew him enough to fly to Baja with him.
Plain sight.
Exactly the same kind of chips Vincent Avery used to scam the casinos. 
Before he got shot.
Someone catch you and Vincent working on the side? Shoot him?
Where were you?
Sit down.
Thank you.
We'd also like to take a look at your car.
Brass! Yo, Jim we got it.
I'm sure the officer felt his life was in imminent danger, sir. We're detaining you for questioning related to the murder of Vincent Avery.
You're right. You're not.
Right. It's registered to the girl he bought tickets to Baja for.
Tickets were bought with your credit card but we have no proof he ever went down there.
Till Avery made him mad.
Safety precaution only. We're done.
Warrick. It's Vega. We've got a four-forty-four.
One guess.
No one knows. I got guys out looking for her right now.
Waiting on you guys.
You went looking for Keith Driscoll?
Your daughter lives there. She probably saw what happened. We're going to pick her up eventually.
Gunshot victim shipped to desert palms. Santee Cherna, 32. Runs this check-cashing joint.
You bet. Was shot in the leg making his weekly bank run.
Night deposit.
We can't arrest people for that, unfortunately.
Sister heard a gunshot, saw a car take off.
Oh, yeah. The RO's our vic. That's his spot.
Mm-hmm.
But if that's true then our vic gets to collect the insurance money plus he gets to keep the money he stole for himself.
Chuck it.
Detective Vega, LVPD. Can I see some ID?
We can do this down at the station, if that works better for you.
Maybe. Did you get a good look at him?
Why don't we start talking about your pistol.
It wouldn't happen to be a colt.
There's three fiberglass manufacturers here in Vegas. This is the largest one for prefab baths and showers. Twenty-four employees.
Dame la navaja.
Do you have one? Because we can check your house. We can check your neighborhood. Why don't we just start right here in this parking lot?
Tell us how it happened-- then we'll talk about the future.
Yeah. Holly Pearson, 31, single. She lived across the street. Car was locked. Keys and purse were accounted for. Found them in the mailbox along with her mail.
I'm on it.
Guys? I found a couple of the victim's coworkers. They said she was at the Highball last night. Got them coming into PD.
Any guys come on strong?
I'd like to show you some pictures.  See if you recognize anyone.

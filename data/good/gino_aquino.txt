Fine, do your cop thing and don't tell me nuthin'.
Go ahead, look around all you want.
My dog ain't here. You arrested him with me a couple months ago. I never got him back.
Yeah, right. A bunch of rich people trying to feel good about themselves. They should just give us the money.
Yeah, check the police report.
In case he comes back.
I'm still in mourning.
You crazy? I bought that for her.
Callate, ya! Do I need to tap my defender?
Voy a la carcel porque estas muy ocupado comiendo y no limpias.

Let me guess: you been talking to Steve Card. Little screamer. That finger's pointing the other way. Lizzie had cojones. I loved that woman. I respected her. You never cross Lizzie, she'll cut 'em off. But Card, he thought he had that immunity idol 'cause he worked for her.  Tonto.
Without her, he was nobody. She was a bad bitch. That's your motive. Anything else you need help with?
I thought this was about Lizzie.

Hi, Renee.
Good afternoon, Mr. Ribero. How's the golf?
Hi. You look lost.
Okay, the stairs are all the way back to the left and the Real Estate Office is at the end of the hall.
Okay? Bye.
Hello. Oh! Those for me?
Okay.  I'll tell you, though this is going to be worth a lot of money someday.
All right, buddy.
Mr. Grissom.
Oh, uh ... hi, I've ... I've, um, I've seen you on tv before. I admire your work.
Dominic. Uh, 'I-C' rather than with the 'I-C-K'... uh, Kretzker. I'm the, uh, Hansen Building Security Detail.
Yeah. As a matter of fact, they said that I was going to be talking to you, because, well, we are ... you know, we're both in law enforcement, and ...
Oh, yeah. He was one of my best buddies. As a matter of fact, you know, two minutes' difference it would've been my face all over the news instead of his, right?
Yeah. Yeah. I mean ... only if I could help people, yes. No, no. I know what you're thinking. Uh, you know, my building blows up I'm over at Arby's sucking down some extra sauce. You know, how could I want to help people, right?
Well, I know a lot about bombs. You know, pipe, power, powder. The three 'Ps' of mass destruction.
Yes sir?
Are you serious?  Yeah. Yes, sir. I'd be honored, sir. Oh. But we can't tell anybody on the day shift, though because they're going to get real jealous.
Yes.
Oh, yes!
All right, you cram this thing here with gunpowder, all right? Then you cap it here, and you cap it here. Now the grains inside, all right ... they're going to ignite and cause smoke. Lots and lots of smoke ... now, the problem is, all that smoke's here man it's got nowhere to go. Okay? It starts cooking ... and then ... bob's your uncle... boom!
Oh, they don't teach this stuff at universities. No, this is all trial and error.
Yeah. Yeah...
Ma'am, you seem like a very nice person but these people-- they've been very, very good to me.
All right I'll see you guys later.
Listen, do me a favor. Will you tell Grissom that, if he needs me just call me at home, okay? 
Let's roll.
Hey, hey. 
Yeah, that's how I knew you were coming. Makes me feel like I'm part of things. 
Mr. Grissom. What can I do for you guys?
Yeah. Yeah, I recognize that. That houses a nice little detonator.
Why, sure. Come on in. 
The place is kind of a mess. Sorry.
Here.
Here it is.
Timetell Snoozewell. $10.99. Well, you can get it for half price if you got a coupon.
Yeah, 'cause I haven't made the bomb yet.
Well, yeah. Yeah. I blow them out in back all the time. I blasted a few of them a couple months ago.
Sure is.
Hey, that's sentimental.
No. I mean, it is. That's like, you know, Waco and Trade Center. That's historical. I didn't have a war, all right? I'm too flatfooted for the P.D. And that's as close to history as I'm going to get. I collect souvenirs. I mean, th-that's my building, you know. I mean ... that was my place of employment, man.
If I had anything to hide, I'd hide it. I'm pretty proud of that container piece, I'll tell you.
You-you kidding? Oh.
Cuffs?
Could you do me a favor? Will you put the jacket over them? I don't want to be seen like this. Especially on TV. This is not who I am. 
Thanks, Partner.
Just kind of using the current experience to understand the other side of law enforcement.
You think I'm guilty, don't you?
That is crazy. I mean, come on. I'm one of the good guys. I know the cops went through my things. Did they find anything?
You do what I do.
You don't just, like stop by to see someone. You ... make up an excuse like 'I'm in the area. Just stopping by.' Wow. You're just like me. Except better-looking.
Okay.
You mean you weren't just in the neighborhood? 
That second bomb -- it wasn't remote, was it? Otherwise, I'd still be a suspect.
So I guess you're not going to be needing my expertise anymore. I mean, investigation-wise.  I knew it was too good to be true. 
Well, proud to have worked with you, sir.
Yeah, but we know who really solves the crimes, don't we, sir?
Thank you.
Yeah?
I need classroom 22b. 
Where's 22b?
Get out of my way, people. Come around me.
No, it's all right. Everyone's safe.

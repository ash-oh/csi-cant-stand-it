I don't even know why she was in Las Vegas. We live in Laughlin. She hates it here.
Yeah ...  ... yeah, she won it in the, uh, quarter slots. First two coins and bingo. Triple stars.
No.  She hadn't been driving it much. 
Uh, she got lost a couple times and it scared her, so for her birthday last month, I bought her the unit.
Yeah.
I installed it.
Oh, god. Uh ... last week, she came by my place 'cause she said she didn't know how to work the GPS.
Okay, grandma, look, it's really easy. I'll explain it to you again. You just type in the address of where you want to go.
Look, I swear, if I had known what she was planning, I would've stopped her.
I had no idea.
No, no, wait.
Okay, fine. When I can afford it, I'll go back to college.
Grandma, I promise.
I love you, too.
No ... look, I don't think you understand. I loved my grandmother, and she's dead. She killed herself, and she killed these three other people.  What are you telling me? She killed these people for me? And I'm supposed to live with this?

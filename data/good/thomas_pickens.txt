We've never had a problem with this ride. This is the safest ride we got.
As soon as the mom started screaming, I stopped the ride.
I check those every morning.

Lady, it's the Tunnel of Love, not Colossus. People like to get up close and personal on this ride.
Ma'am, I don't know what you're talking about.

Jerry Lee Lewis, man. Same thing happened to him. What's all this got to do with the little dead girl, anyway?
I was walking down the midway 
... and I seen this woman come whishing out of the tunnel, screaming for her daughter.

I didn't do nothing. She was dead. I didn't come within two feet of her. I'm sorry about what happened. But that's all that I know.
I own this attraction and it's going with me to the next town.
What, says you two string beans?
Lady, you don't know who you're messing with.
Yeah.
You pullin' my pud?

About twenty hours, man.
Straight from Union City, Tennessee.
Well, I was cutting through that alley trying to find a taxi off one of them side streets. Next thing I know I'm on the ground just getting pounded all to hell. I thought I was gonna die. Even give it up to the man. Then I heard that horn honking and engine revving toward me.
Could you do me a favor?
The man that saved my life, I'd like to meet him, give him a thank you.
There he is.
Mr. Sanders? 
Better than dead. Get me over here, Lizzy, where I can shake this man's hand.
You're a brave man. Thank you.
Home, Elizabeth.
I cook some mean barbeque, if you ever get yourself to Union City, Tennessee.
You do that.
Cuts, some of them pretty bad, mostly on my face. Broke left arm, crushed windpipe, one eye socket cracked, broke right ankle. And I got this headache they tell me might be permanent.
Hell, yeah.
Oh, I couldn't tell who was who. I mean, hell, my hands were on my face. I was just trying to stay alive. If Mr. Sanders hadn't shown up just then, I'd have been like that first guy -- dead.
This kid saved my damn life. He is a hero, a genuine hero.

I hate bees.
I never get used to this part, you know when the bugs get going.
Beetles. No alkali fluids in the dirt so she wasn't killed here. Whoever dumped her must have been in a hurry. Didn't take the time to bury her. What do you think?
You can eat?
Hey, don't look at me.
Stellate pattern and beveled wound confirms the proximity of barrel to scalp. No question this was an intimate killing.
Let's see what we have. Fracture to the nasal bone, orbital bone, mandibular ... all facial fractures.
These aren't fresh, are they?
Any idea how long she's been dead?
Shakespeare again?
Okay, bear with me. 
I mean, you're one of ten guys in the country that understands this stuff.
Insects arrive at a corpse in a specific order, right?
And you can pinpoint time of death based on the type and age of insects present on the body?
Linear regression.
Which will tell us when the woman died.
It's a muscid fly. Only breeds in urban areas but Grissom found one on our girl which means she was probably killed downtown and then carried into the mountains.
What was her name?
Every face and neck fracture your wife has sustained over the last six years is highlighted.
How about a gun?
We're going to investigate your apartment. Do we need a warrant or are you going to play nice?
We'll be the judge of that.
No, thanks.
Not a lot of room for Kaye.
This back door lead to your car?
You smell that, Grissom?
I got news for you, Scott. Bleach doesn't make blood disappear. You just can't see it with the naked eye.
It 'got there' when you shot your wife in the head before you wrapped her in a blanket and you dumped her in the mountains!
You touch me again, you draw back a stump!
You don't know a handful!
I am a woman, and I have a gun. And look how he treated me. I can only imagine how he treated his wife.
What do we need to nail him at trial?
The bullets from Scott's gun are unusual. 
Since we didn't find the spent bullet I sent one from the box over to trace. Everything else stacks up. He killed her. 
What did you get?
Are you positive? Not five?
Okay, forget time of death. How does your client explain Kaye's blood all over his apartment wall?
'Altercations' ... upgraded from 'wrestling'?
Fine. Yeah.
I was working till 4:00 A.M. I combed every demo Scott's driven. Zilch. What's up?
Oh. Warrick -- your favorite CSI.
What do you want to know?
Hey.
Um ... I'm-I'm here about something else. You ... you know how you say, 'We're the victim's last voice'?
I thought it was our job to speak for Kaye Shelton.
What if you hear the victim's screams? In the car, at the store.
You want to sleep with me?
That way, when I wake up in a cold sweat under the blanket, hearing Kaye's screams ... you can tell me it's nothing.  It's just empathy.
Thanks.
Which places the victim with her husband who's already guilty as sin.
I heard you were going into an autopsy.  How can you just move on to another case? They're laughing at us. You know that, right? They think we're a couple of 'science nerds'. They threw out our findings.
'First witness to a crime.'
...and forensic science was born. Sung T'su, 1235 A.D. You call 800 years ago recent?
And again by Bergeret D'Arbois in the 1800s.
We're part of the cycle.
Except somebody had to push for prints. And you're standing there saying
Yes.
Kaye Shelton ...
Gave her a bath, huh?
Why didn't we see this at the autopsy?
Yeah.
'Lead, copper, zinc ... teflon.'  Teflon?
Strand of hair from our lady in the mountains. 
The blue dust from around her entrance wound -- that's from the bullet's impact. It's made of teflon. Now look at the next specimen.
The bullet is from Scott's personal ammo supply which I test-fired. See, the teflon disintegrated into blue powder at the moment of impact.
But we can bury him under evidence. You're the one who's always saying it's better to have one piece of forensic evidence than ten eyewitnesses.
Less Latin.
Hi.
I checked out Warrick. His story about missing court was, uh ... lame. I got this surveillance tape from the Monaco. He was in the casino. 
I'm sorry.
Warrick? Your favorite CSI.
I got this surveillance tape. He was in the casino. I'm sorry.
Dead body-- bonus.
You tell us -- you like leather or lace?
I filed my report.
Get me a picture of the body ... the items on the bedsheet ... the window ... the drafting table.
Everything on the floor.
Sara Sidle, crime scene investigation. And you are ... ?
Sorry for your loss.  You want to tell me what happened here?
Nothing benign about two $20s screaming, 'take me' on the bar.
Yeah, well, it's hard to miss all that high-tech computer equipment. There's got to be five, ten grand there. First thing I'd take.
Before or after he used a bedsheet to transport the silverware? Pillowcases are the norm, you know that. Something's not right.
Using your arms -- how big's a whale?
Now freeze, don't move.  Up.
Checking for blood spatter.
This is what I do. This is how I eliminate you as a suspect.
Well, that's good news; no blood, bud.
I am going to need you to strip, though.
Don't be shy on my account. But if you are, this nice detective will accompany you to the bedroom.
Oh, and, uh, I'm going to need to take your window with me, too. 
It's all in the warrant.
Grissom reinstated you.
Let me guess. Grissom gets you to dime yourself off and now you both feel better? You're supposed to be in court. Instead, you're placing bets for a cheap thrill to satisfy nothing.
I'm already working.
You weren't in your office.
Warrick has a problem. Ignoring it isn't going to make it go away. You asked me for a report and then you disregard my recommendation.
So you feel comfortable jeopardizing a unit to placate an addict?
Then at least take him off my case.
Glass. Any idea how it got there?
Did you file a police report?
I already checked with my lab. They do this test, and guess what? The glass -- it floated.
Anything else you'd like to tell us?
No, he's not.
Just one more question. What do you do for a living?
You make a lot of money doing that?
Feel free to answer it anyway.
But you don't, right?
I was playing him. Cops ran Kenny's financials. He lost a pot in the market. Had a ton of margin calls. I'm surprised you didn't tag him as a fellow gambler.
It's a flaw.
Not bad. I'm impressed.
I meant the Haeckel marks. Should tell us what we need to know.
This is the glass you line-drived.
Right angles face the same direction. Take a look.
Just take a damn look.
You ever heard of Haeckel marks?
What did you use to break the window, Kenny?
We can't prove it, but we got a motive.
Okay, let's say killing his brother would get it for him.
He's a day trader -- spends all day on his computer. If we want to know more about him that's where we should be looking.
Still at the house.
Why don't we go get a ... ?
There's something wrong with it.
The power light's on.
Oh, no one is going to believe this.
Nothing really special about them.
We match this to the broken window, we got him.
So, Kenny broke the window from the inside using the butt of the gun.
Sounds like more than a theory.
I never said you weren't a good CSI.
You look lost.
Yeah. You want me to tell him you're here?
Okay. Will he know what for?
So you went to the casino to win bail money.
You want to tell me you didn't?
What else you got?
How did he find you? 1-800-GRISSOM ... ?
... The firemen have.
Funny place for a mattress.
Looks like the kid was going camping.
Waterproof matches.
It's a weird place for such a thorough burn especially since the door isn't scorched.
Look at this. Rubber?
That's why you can always count on seeing a pattern.
Bag a sample. I'll put it through the lab.
So that's why the concrete's discolored? From the heat?
Why would there be glass in the middle of the hot spot?
He still did the job.
Danger, Will Robinson.
As a matter of fact, here is your doorframe. I had Collins analyze the burn depth. You see these rolling blisters?
Based on the depth of the allir... allo...
This wood burned very hot and very fast.
Negative.
Counting matches?
I got a theory. You want to hear it?
You know the melted shards of glass we found on the closet floor? They prove that the fire burned at over a thousand degrees, right? But that temp, combined with the water used to douse the flames would have destroyed most of the accelerant.
So, Ecklie's conclusion of gasoline wasn't based on any physical evidence. It was based on Damon's credit card receipts.
But, hydrocarbons are found in all kinds of things: Oils ... kerosene, polyethylene-based compounds like laxatives-- even the foam used in push-up bras.
Crime scene cleanup.
And then what?
Can you fill in the blanks?
So all this stuff is from a five-meter radius of the point of origin?
How could the victim possibly have been in one piece?
Calm, huh?
Did you figure out what this 'FP' stands for?
So our bomber's a newbie. Does he fit Grissom's wack job from the bomb site?
What is it?
What about the orange stuff?
Mmm?
I would have to investigate that.
This is a good choice. According to the bomb data center which has a record of every component used in any bomb -- from Ted Kaczynski to teenage boys playing with fireworks -- the most recent timing device of choice is made by TimeTell SnoozeWell, $10.99 at any local drugstore.
We're going to go blow up some bombs.
Aluminum briefcase.
Snoozewell.
Black gunpowder.
Identify the pipe containing the powder.
You ready?
Let's do it, Dan.
Fragments from the galvanized steel traveled the farthest.
That's the outer limit of visible metal detritus at the Hansen building.
Polyethylene? Terephtalete?
Anybody report hearing any noise? Ticking?
Oh. It's not the firemen -- it's the rain. This crime scene is trashed.
What do you have?
That orange stuff again.
Which sets off the bomb.
Be right back.
Excuse me. Hi. I'm with the crime lab. I'm sorry, but I have to take your jacket.
Thanks. 
Polyethylene-terephtalete.
'Orange stuff'.
I have a new favorite color.
The orange polyester from the bomb is a match to the thrift-right jacket. Guess where their regional headquarters is located. 
You bet. I ran a Lexis search looking for disgruntled employees, irate customers anyone with a grievance against thrift-right.
Norman Stirling -- former manager.
Let go last year. Caused a commotion at HQ. Filed lawsuits against the company. Guy's been out of work ever since.
'FP.'
You don't recognize those initials?
Well, those orange jackets over there appear to match the materials the bombs were wrapped in.
Is that the place with that weird pool?
Any chance it's old age?
Only in Vegas.
Sign of struggle. I'll dust for prints.
Yeah. One hit or there would be blood.
Well, you know, that would be Celine Dion.
But, uh, the bill was charged to the credit card of a Lynn Henry, Eau Claire, Wisconsin.
Hi.
Sort of?
So Darren was the dancer?
Lynn, how did you get those bruises on your wrists?
Thanks. Our card.
Dinner's going to have to wait.
And, as far as we can tell you were the last three women with him. So, who's lying?
About what? Lynn, does this have anything to do with the bruises on your wrists?
Yeah, you can go.
But, Lynn, uh ... a car's going to take you to the hospital for an exam.
Well, we're assuming that a couple of lamp hits to the head killed Darren, right?
You read the coroner's final report. There's no traces of that lamp on his head at points of impact.
I don't know. I'll let you know when I find it.
What? What do you got?
Where?
Nice. 
Tiniest diamond in the world.
The bride-to-be's ring, maybe? She was here.
Every time we go to find these women they're somewhere else. You sure you got that address? That desk clerk was talking very quickly.
What?
Oh. You think we're dressed for a wedding?
Lynn Henry's SART exam's in.
At this point, I think all those girls are lying to us.
The clock's going to explain it all, believe me.
So, ladies of the wedding party, you get a free course in the forensics of sexual intercourse. Secrets of our trade. Lynn, when you had your exam for sexual assault a SART nurse makes a clock like this. 
This is the v*g1n*. 
And it does tell a monologue. Some bruising is normal when s*x occurs. Injuries at 11:00 ... 12:00 or 1:00 indicate consensual s*x or what we would call 'avid.' Injuries around the dinner hour ... five, six, or seven, indicate forced entry. The woman hasn't done anything to help her partner thus sustaining serious bruising.
Okay, O'Riley. Lynn ... your exam showed no evidence of s*x in the last
Look, we can run the clock exam on each of you. And the clock is going to tell us what happened. So who wants to go first?
Meg, your engagement ring ... is that cubic zirconia? 
Meg, you did have s*x with Darren the dancer. Maybe you even tried to stop in the middle of it. But something got your attention.
Luke, you threw the lamp -- probably on the floor. Understandable rage.
Except we found it.
What am I? ... working food and beverage at one of the hotels? I haven't had a day off in three weeks. I mean, if they're going to call me in, throw me a bone. Give me the 419 on the elevator.
I'm tired.
You're awake. I hate you.
Thanks, Greg.
Everything has to be in CODIS ASAP.
Suck it up, Greg. You're well-rested.
I heard that.
No, I can't drink any more coffee. My body clock is so screwed up. I just want a steak and a shot.
Food? Good idea. You're on.
So much for the steak. I'll take the coffee.
Okay, I'm up.
Bingo. Well, that only took 45 minutes.
A hit off Patrick Haynes' social security number. There's only one problem. He's an eight-month-old infant that died ten years ago.
Something good?
She's dead.
Really? How would you know?
It's an honest question.
Well, not this girl.
What does that mean?
Okay.
Well, that's scary. All you need is one signature to break somebody.
Yeah, dispatch left a message.
This Chilean Sea Bass is wonderful.
Okay, you got your missing widow. Her bloody tooth found in her own bedroom which is currently occupied by two moes.
No, you're not, and stay out of my sea bass.
Who was sleeping with six men rolled into one -- Patrick Haynes.
Risk versus reward. You sleep with someone, you kill 'em, the heat's on. You flee, or, you roll the dice and maybe you get your cookie.
So why kill Lacey Duvall?
You want to go Dutch, Nick?
Vegas, NFL football, a guy like you. Come on, you trying to tell me that you didn't make a little pit stop?
Warrick has a problem. Ignoring it isn't going to make it go away.
Hey.
Right now? I thought I would help you two with the scene.
Walk in the park, guys.
Hey.
You get any I.D. On her?
All right. 
Hi.
Thanks.
Make a note she's married. Or recently divorced. 
She's warm.
Uh, Evans ... we're going to need a little privacy here.
I never really liked this part of my yearly exam. These things are always freezing.
Okay.
Saint Catherine. She studied science. 
She was touch and very outspoken. Went against the Emperor himself. Chewed him out for persecuting Christians. Took him two or three tries to execute her. 
She never gave up. She was brave.
You hold on to this.
This shouldn't have happened to you. But, I promise I will find out who did this. I promise.
Hey. 
Sexual assault kit's ready to process.
We'll see. She's, um ...  ... breathing.
Yeah?
Here you go.
Somebody wore this hat a lot.
This sweatband might give us DNA and I could compare it to the samples I collected off of Jane at the hospital.
Our ... Jane Doe. My 'death imminent.'
I'll be in DNA.
Any luck on 23rd street?
The DNA from the ball cap is a match to the semen we found on our Jane Doe. But ... CODIS hasn't kicked out a name.
We're not having any luck finding the shooter from his DNA with a belt loop so I thought I would at least try and identify the poor woman before she dies.
Do I what?
Yeah.
I chase rabbits. And ... I read crime books. And I listen to the scanner.
Nothing.
I don't like anything.
She's special ... to me. I can't help it.
Okay. I'm almost done. I just got to log off.
You were shopping.
Pamela ...  ... Pamela Adler.
Grissom told you to keep me out, didn't he?
/ one day, maybe next week / I'm going to meet you, meet you / I will ... 
If you like chalk on a board.
It's a-a habit. I don't even realize I'm doing it. Did you get that belt loop from the crime scene lined up yet?
Fits like a glove.
You go. I have something to do first.
Excuse me?
It's something else. Promise.
We caught him. If you hadn't pulled that belt loop we might never have found him, but ... you did good.
Hi.
Sure. Oh, I wanted to give you this. I've been keeping it ... for Jane -- Pam, uh, until I found her family.
How are you doing?
That's great. That's-that's great. She's a real fighter, huh?
Yeah, I do ... know people who've gone there. They'll take real good care of her.
I got to go.
Definitely. Haven View. I'll be there.  Good luck.
The husband doesn't get it. 
He's so happy she's going to live. He doesn't realize she's going to be in a vegetative state for the rest of her life.  It's not fair.
What kind of system rewards the suspect when the victim is too tough to die?
I wish I was like you, Grissom. I wish I didn't feel anything.
Nadine Winston falls asleep in that chair and incinerates. We can make history.
No. Of course not. I'm a scientist. I just ... 
She has been reduced to ashes.
I know.
What if it is real, and we've uncovered it?
I'm not. I'm just open to all theories.
Looks like cotton fiber ... possibly from a nightgown. It's barely scorched. Weird. It's like the body burned, but ... the clothing was fire retardant.
Fire practically burned a hole in the roof but it's isolated in one spot.
The victim -- she live alone?
A human torch.
Theories give way to conclusions once all the evidence is in. I am merely thinking about the next piece of evidence.
Incinerated. Lab results from the ashes came back negative for accelerant. Nothing flammable but sebaceous glutamate.
I'm going to go talk to Grissom -- see what he thinks.
I checked with homicide again. They found no evidence of foul play.
No motive. O'Riley spoke with friends and relatives. They were a loving couple.
No, and you're reaching.
We're scientists, right? We want answers, the satisfaction of certainty. I'm not ignoring scientific method. I'm just keeping an open mind. If we eliminate all the alternatives we're left with spontaneous combustion. That's exciting!
She's a pile of ash.
Great.
Well?
Interesting voice mail you left me.
'Meet me behind CSI and bring a cotton nightgown.' I'd wear it for you but, uh, I prefer pajamas.
We're experimenting on a pig again?
You know, I-I-I haven't eaten meat since Grissom used one to estimate postmortem insect growth.
What are you going to do, exactly?
You do not give up.
If she burned herself with the cigarette, she would've woken up, not burned up.
Sleeping pills.
Care for a light?
Now what?
We're just working the case.
The wick?
We found the same thing at the crime scene.
You knew about the ashes? Why didn't you say something when you gave us the case?
Well, I would've looked like an idiot. Thanks for covering.
Done.
What's missing here?
Can we get another gurney? GRISSOM: I need another gurney.
Come on, come on! Hurry up! NICK: Let's go, hurry up! Get the plastic on!
We're losing everything!
What did you do exactly?
Justin ... we're going to need to take your clothes.
Because there's blood all over them.
Hey, Gris. Kevin Shepherd, chiropractor. Amy Shepherd, Dentist. House in the lakes. Married eight years. Perfect credit. You know, I'm lost. There's nothing jumping off the page, here.
Justin Green. First witness, first suspect but he hung around, waiting for us.
But his story jibes. Several eyewitness saw him performing CPR on Kevin Shepherd. But if-if-if it is a carjacking, I don't get it. Why fight to the death? It's four wheels and a chassis.
So, you are thinking the Shepherds lost their lives for their SUV?
Hey, Doc. What's with the fluoroscope?
What about a pin or a plate -- something metallic on the inside?
Exsanguination.
What is that?
A tip ... of a knife.
Yeah ... but I cleaned it for you.
Acid in the lemon juice should react to carbon steel, but not stainless steel.
He's the cop. I'm the scientist.
Carbon steel. What's next?
And while the artist was at work, Brass and I identified Jessica Hall's murder weapon from the tip we found lodged in her ribs. It's a dagger. Fugasi model 502.
So, if this dagger matches your mold ...
Okay. We just put the sharp wounds to bed.
Points of impact on these two are blunt, right?
Yeah.
And then he went back to Kevin to finish the job.
Sweaty palms make the best prints.
If we find what we're looking for the answer is yes. 
Can I see those prints?
Thanks. 
No need for AFIS. We got a visual match. All three prints belong to victim number three.
What does that give us? We know she was stabbed at the crime scene, but then what? Was she driving herself to the hospital? Was she under duress?
Preserving the blood pattern.
The victim was lying on the ground, wounds above the waist. It's not Kevin's blood.
Okay.
Standing here, I'm not going to get that much blood on Warrick.
Well, I can't without ... stepping on him.
Stabbing's are messy and inexact. So victim number three becomes suspect number two.
Grissom didn't say what he was looking for, huh?
I think it's peaceful.
He's a suspect? When did that happen?
Not the t-shirt. 
Warrick ... what does that look like to you?
Wrist doesn't bend that way.
We know where Jessica's hands were. 
And Amy Shepherd died instantly.
Justin's story was that he performed CPR on Kevin Shepherd.
Damn it. Justin sold me a lie and I bought it.
Wednesday. 10:02 ... Kevin transferred $35,000 to his mistress, Jessica. Wednesday 2:16 p.m. ...
Yes. Deposit for $35,000. 
I can trump that. Sorry, Nick. Thursday, 11:09 A.M. $70,000 was transferred to Justin Green's account.
Not Jessica. Not Kevin.
Amy Shepherd does the unthinkable. She doubles it.
Taillight?
Given the extensive bruising from the wide tread mark, victim was killed by a larger vehicle. Not that compact.
What's up?
You can tell he's deaf by his fingerprints?
The vehicle -- probably a truck or an SUV, based on the width of the tire tread-- takes off. Later, along comes a compact - thump -- runs over his dead body.
That ended in murder.
Dr. Gilbert ...
We need your help. Brian Clemonds was murdered.
Anyone have a grudge against him? 
We understand you don't want a homicide investigation upsetting your students.
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend you.
We'll also need access to his records.
I'm not accusing anybody of anything.
They're not cooperating.
What did we do? We met with the president, asked a few questions.
Like it's our fault we can hear.
So, you going to tell us how you learned to sign?
Well, the president of the college is a real whack job.
You know, I think you might be siding with her.
What was that all about? Grissom signs.
He goes out?
Oh, I've read about this machine. Very Frankenstein.
You've used one of these before?
So, you show the suspect slides of the crime scene and if he's our guy ...
I photo'ed the victim's torso and imaged the tread mark-- scanned it -- got it running through a tread assistance CD ROM.
Not yet. CD database-- 11,033 patterns.
Could take a while.
What are you doing?
What?
Lice?
Yeah, he was. Lice adhere to hair follicles. I didn't find any stray hairs on him.
Computer's still processing but Warrick found something pretty interesting.
A few more numbers and this could have been cake.
We have a lead -- I found a partial serial number on the broken taillight.
Maybe on its own but the tire tread database kicked out a match. The tire belongs to a ford explorer. A p235-75, manufactured specifically for their SUVs. Only one with the same partial serial number is registered in Vegas.
Lice?
So ... that's why Grissom's late.
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.
Taillights match.
Check this out. 
This fabric matches the victim's sweater.
And the taillight was smashed.
Who drives backwards on a downtown street?
Thanks.
They get washed every time, right?
You okay?
Okay.
Mandatory drug testing?
Cocaine bugs. 
Hey, I just got off the phone with OSHA. Our carnival has violations in eight states.
But that's not all. More than half these guys have records. And Pickens, the boss? His real name is Roger Peet. He's a convicted s*x offender on parole.
You tell us.
You worried you tipped your hand in there?
Look, don't bite my head off, but any chance you're going after this guy because you're a mother?
Yeah.
Maybe.
You have anything to support that? 
Hey.  We aren't going to lunch, are we?
Maybe she had a minor concussion, or was stunned. That could explain why she couldn't get out.
Perimortem?
So someone did yank her out of that car in the dark.
Wait. Pickens yanks her out just so he can drown her?
Not without someone seeing him.
None.
Drowned the little girl.
I'm going to go call Brass. 
Nothing. This is fun.
As compared to a more scientific approach.
Okay, based on our theory a loose seat belt enabled Pickens to yank the little girl out of her seat.
Just like little Sandy.
The only person who could have done it, then is the person that was in the car with her-- the mother.
I'm sorry. What?
And by creating, you mean fabricating. Neurolinguistics programming -- human behavioral science.
Mrs. Dantini.
We may have a lead.
So, you jumped in the water.
You never went in the water.
And when she managed to grab onto you, you broke her arm.
Hey ... 
... you all right?
Since we skipped lunch, you want to get something to eat? Walk it off?
Mm-hmm.
Yes! Road trip.
I'm gonna go switch boots.
Who found the body?
Where is it?
There's no head. Think it's DaSilva?
Uh... hands and feet have been amputated.
Yeah?
I'm not sure you should be doing this.
Snooping for trace on Grissom and Catherine's stolen BMW?
What has gotten into you?
You're nuts. You know that.
That's one of those funny clues. Could mean nothing or could mean everything.
Working the case.
The skinned gorilla torso forty miles outside of Baker. Remember?
Well, it was at the start of shift. A crime has been committed.
And ...
I can't believe you. You, with your pet tarantula your maggot farms, that komodo dragon on back order ... you should be more sympathetic to the senseless murder of an innocent gorilla.
Bummer.
Wait. Is he missing a head?
So, uh, Tricky Nick. What did you get on your evaluation?
Yeah, but how many 'outstandings' did Grissom give you?
What did he tell you to look for?
Yeah.
'Spur's Corral.' I know that place. They give you peanuts for starters instead of bread or chips and salsa.
Look, you obviously don't need my help. I-I got go put something to rest. See you later?
I heard you were disassembling the gorilla.
Well, I've been trying to find out who did this to her and, um, I have some questions.
Why did they amputate the gorilla's head?
The hands and feet?
Here Nick and I were thinking it was to avoid I.D. Why skin it?
It's hard to tell where the human ends and the animal begins.
I checked out a couple of websites ... bushmeatorg. I think she was killed probably in Cameroon or Congo transported to the port of Los Angeles. Dismembered, packaged ... loaded onto a small plane ... where they dumped what they couldn't sell but, uh, I just have to find the plane.
There has to be something I can do.
For every one that parts, one stands aboveground.
Damn it.
Damn that guy.
He's escalating, Grissom.
Guess he wants to get caught.
I have tape-lifted, roll-lifted -- I'm not finding one hair.
He vacuumed this place before he left. We've established that he utilizes materials from the victim's domicile.
Hey, guys. He took the bag.
Thanks.
Hey, Warrick you got a second?
I got this hair that you guys found this morning and I'm trying to compare it to the one hair we recovered from the murder last week - the Hayes girl?
No. I can't even tell if we have a DNA match. There's no skin tag on either one.
No scalp, no skin. It's almost like this hair was ...
Mine.
Hey, Warrick and I just got a break. The guy's been planting hairs.
Grissom ... are you hearing us?
I'm going to do it, Grissom. 
I want to.
I'm trained in weaponless defense.
Grissom ... 
Think he knows his next victim?
Look, this is my idea. I want to do something before another girl gets killed and ...
You've been saying that for weeks. It's taking too long. Someone else is going to die and you're still going to be figuring it out.
Wish me luck.
Uh ... yeah, actually.
Me, too. This is my last pack ... but, uh, I say that every week, so ... 
Guess it depends on the woman.
Sure. Yeah.
Maybe. 
I don't usually give out that kind of information.
Thanks.
Hey!
He met the profile.
Tracy Berg.
I didn't really find anything instructive but Warrick hit pay dirt.
The frequented locations report said none of the women belong to a gym where he could have spotted them.
Which I do all the time. It's a free workout, and you don't have to sign up.
And, of course, get a list of the club's male gym members.
Do we have a breakfast budget, Grissom?
Good, cause our plates are up, and nobody has any money.
Whole wheat and fruit? Who ordered that?
I know who I am. I think you're a little confused.
Get a picture of the security pad. Someone touches it before it's dusted, I break their fingers. 
Shoot the mirror, point of disturbance the lamp, point of disturbance ... 
... you're standing in my crime scene.
You're doing audio? I wanted that.
Technicality. Who did Grissom handpick to work here?
Get the lights, will you?
Cursory call -- looks like a professional job. 
Our guy bypasses the security system, surprises the wife in the back hall. Drags her in here. She grabs onto the doorway -- sign of struggle. No sign of sexual assault. He's in, they're out. 
Probably ... egress through those doors. Excuse me, is my evaluation interrupting you?
Glad I have a healthy ego. You find something interesting there?
You're ... so ... technical ... I can hardly keep up, but ...
Did you just slap on bad cologne?
It's almost sweet.
Can't be chloroform.
We'll confirm it in GC mass spec.
I keep trying to be your star pupil.
No dirt. Context-- there is dirt on the carpeting inside.
You're saying kidnapper tracked the dirt in.
Cyanide? He poisoned her?
And how does a bug specialist know so much about dirt?
Gruesome, Grissom.
So when you said, 'Follow the dirt'...?
Great. There's got to be 100 gold mines in Nevada.
Freaky. Is that what I think it is?
Last mine. We've circled it twice.
Where?
Okay, let's land! Take her down! Down!
Mrs. Garris! GRISSOM: Mrs. Garris! Can you hear us? SARA: Mrs. Garris! GRISSOM: We're with the Las Vegas Police Department!
Got something here.
Come on! GRISSOM: Get that end! SARA: Yeah, come over!
Oh, my god.
Never ceases to amaze me what people do to each other. 
Transport the box to the lab for latents. Hair fibers, get soil exemplars.
What's the rule? How long do I have to be here before I start kicking in for gifts?
You keep that; might learn something.
The burial box is in. 
Thanks, guys.
'Garris Winery.'
Grissom, can you look at something out back? Could be big.
Hey, Grissom ... could you come tape me up?
Right. Not in the back. Which made me ask, what kind of a kidnapper puts a woman bound and unconscious in the front seat? The back of my arm isn't touching the sheepskin, see?
But, there is sheepskin fiber on the back of Laura's sleeve. That tells us Laura sat back like a normal person would.
Cut me, Mack.
Like this.
Correct. But, would a kidnapper risk putting an unconscious woman in the front seat of his car, even unbound? Answer is usually in the question -- you taught me that. So, was she unconscious? We found halothane on the patio. Halothane knocks you out ... if you take it.
Proof would be in her blood. Halothane stays in the system up to 48 hours.
Damn it, I wanted to carry the ball over the line.
Grateful dead CD?
No halothane in Laura Garris' blood which proves she was never knocked out. She went willingly. She and Chip faked her kidnapping -- which, of course, makes no sense at all.
With a black eye. Any theories?
You and Chip made a plan to run away together with your hard-earned millions, Jack. Divorce is just too long and messy. Anyway, the plan was surprisingly well thought-out.
We're getting to that. You and Chip drove out of town. She sat in the front seat, unbound, fully conscious. They stopped at a roadside phone. Chipper called in the ransom message and I think you were still in the truck then, right, Laura?
Pay attention. It's about to become yours.
Guess he figured why split $2 million when he can dump you and have it all.
Fine suit. 
And well, just fine.
Hey, we have one locker room and it's my job to be observant.
Easy. So, you and me, 419 Western LVU.
I know, we don't have all day ... are, are you going to wear ... that?
It's that hideous ...
And here I had all this respect for you.
Hey.
You see a suicide note?
Don't release anyone downstairs. We want to talk to them. All of them.
Could you say that? I mean, the kid's 18 years old, he's got his whole life in front of him and why would he want to hang himself?
'Get in' ... ?
Apparently not.
Big job? How'd he take it?
No teeth marks.
So, the question is, how did he get there?
Huh. Is that a tattoo?
Nick? You want to take a look at this?
Okay.
We found ink on James's pen1s. Are you trying to tell us he was just practicing his penmanship?
Your Johnson?
Don't stop now.
You humiliate him in front of all the other actives. Poor kid was so scared, he had to sign himself. You give him a beer shower? And you don't call that hazing?
I don't buy it.
The coroner's prelim on the frat hanging.
What's that smell?
Mmm, junk food and radiation-- good combo. 
A strip of raw calf's liver was found lodged inside the cleft of victim's throat. Cause of death: Choking.
Microscopic threads of fabric were found embedded in the liver.
Did you stuff him? Suffocate him? Shove towels down his throat?
How does a kid choke to death and end up hanging from a rafter?
You do realize you just admitted to killing him?
It was an accident. But now it's beginning to look like Christmas.
Manslaughter -- are you kidding? Are you willing to settle for that? Come on, Nick, you know as well as I do there is more to this.
Okay.
Yeah. I don't believe them.
Yes, there would.
What about abdominal or thoracic bruising?
They lied. When this kid was choking, no one tried to help him.
'JILL W.' Two triangles.
Freaks.
Where do you think?
Of course you do.
So, looking for fibers.
What the heck is that?
He didn't think it was funny enough to share it with us. You know, I never met a guy who could just laugh that off.
You and Kyle both get charged with murder. And the House goes dark.
No, but when he gets here, you can tell him. New charge: First degree murder.
One thing about the fraternity upstate, the brotherhood's fantastic.
Oh, I'll dress down.
Glad you could make it.
I'm outta here. Good luck tonight, you guys.
Do you have a name?
Oh ...  okay, let's take her out. 
Thanks.
That's strange.
Glazed like a doughnut.
Formaldehyde, right?
So I was right. This woman's been embalmed.
Are you hitting on me, David?
Let me give you some friendly advice. If you want to pull chicks, you've got to get aggressive. You've gotta drop the glasses, lose the coat grow some scruff. 
You do get a 'C' for cute, though.
'Stephanie Reyes was laid to rest at Desert Haven Funeral Home.' Her funeral was last week.
Are you telling me that someone dug up Stephanie Reyes and stole her body?
Did you report the robbery of Mrs. Reyes' remains to the police?
Profits over people, is that it?
Eight feet. How deep do you bury these caskets?
There's nothing else in there. I thought you said grave robbers only stole bodies.
You sell caskets, right? As part of your mortuary service? I want to see some.
Bonus.
There is no way I'm going to end up in a dumpster wrapped in plastic. I'm going to be cremated -- dust in the wind, you know. I don't want any part of these things.
Are you serious?
How much did it run you?
So when you buy one of these for $10,000, it's yours, right?
No one else gets to use it.
Then how did all these people get in here?
What are you selling-- time-share coffins?
Sure, there is. Once the funeral is over, you dump the body and use the same casket over and over.
Yes, I can. This is a set of prints on the inside of the plastic sheeting we found in the dumpster. What are the odds they belong to you? 
All you had to do was put the bodies back in the grave and no one would have been the wiser.
Yeah, I know. You see dead people. So do I. And when they turn up in dumpsters, I like to see they get back to where they belong.
Minimum. Then, you're going to pay for Stephanie Reyes' family to have a real burial.
Then, we're going to let the D.A. run the table.
I hear it's just bones? What a rush.
Officer-involved shooting.
I drive.
Hi.
Where's his gun?
I'm going to go bag it.
At that proximity G.S.R.'S invalid. They'd both be covered, no matter who fired.
Hey.
What are you getting at, Warrick?
Standard issue. 
Both gun's are nine millimeter automatics. Brass isn't going to like this.
Like I do? If Tyner's dirty, he goes down. I just know what happens when you piss off the P.D.
Officer Tyner, your gun -- there's a bullet missing from the magazine.
Whoa.
Then you should know. Tyner's magazine -- one bullet shy.
Yeah. It's not in the body, bullet's a round point wound was a through-and-through.
And, with a record like yours we're supposed to just take you at your word?
It's not here.
Excuse me. No one's allowed inside the tape.
Missing bullet, eyewitness ... we better tell Grissom we got a war.
Brass, this has nothing to do with anything.
Eyewitness is a bonus: Your cop's magazine was one bullet shy.
Wow, wow guys. Get off him. BRASS: Hey! Hey! Joe!
Yeah. Come on, Warrick. Come on. Let's go.
You think the bullet's somewhere in the jeep.
Let's do it. 
We have searched every single piece of metal. I think hide-and-seek is over.
You've got to be kidding me.
No way.
Vic was shot in the frontal lobe through the windshield. There's no way I could shoot the guy from here and mimic that trajectory.
I got it. Go get some fresh air. 
I heard on the scanner. Quadruple. Figured you might need a hand.
No. 
Blood swirl on the wall. Are you thinking cult? Manson?
Her soul's still in the room.
Yes, sir.
You want me inside?
You're kidding me, right? I'm a taxi service on the biggest case of the year?
Look, brass, I don't see why I got to take her. I'm a scientist. Catherine's the mom. Ask her.
What about Family Services? Can't they take her?
I am not good with kids.
That's very pretty. 
Or not. 
Want to go for another ride? 
I'll take that as a 'yes.'
Hey, Brenda.
What ... what's the head exam for?
Look, if there's any forensic evidence found during this exam, I need to be there.
It's okay, Brenda. 
I'm not leaving you.
Hey, heard you have a suspect.
Hello. How does she explain that?
So a non-family member was out there.
Kids smoke them. They think there's less carbon monoxide.
The shrink says the kid is in a catatonic state from a trauma. I could've told you that. But she did respond to the name 'Buffalo.'
She freaked out.
Going back to the girl. 
I left her in the car. 
The windows are cracked. 
Give me a little credit. She's at the hospital.
Yeah?
There were no overt signs. Why?
This... is a very special camera. It can see deep into your skin. It can see things nobody can see. How about I take a picture of me first, okay? 
See? It's okay. 
Okay.
All ready?
Okay.
Damn it. Look at all those bruises.
Brass said the curtain was shut. The Flight Attendant kept them separated. They disembarked through the rear.
Too much damage for one guy.
Driver's license ... library card ... organ donor card.
He had a family.
David ... it's always a shame.
Put your seat back and tray table in their upright position. I don't think so.
Maybe that's where the action started.
Who was sitting in 4B?
Well, the guy in 4B was knocking them back pretty good.
Could be dried blood.
Marlene Valdez was sitting in 2E.
The lavatory.
No evidence.
One step ahead of you, every so often.
I take it that's not blood.
Oh, the mile-high club. That means the two passengers may have had no idea what was going on inside that cabin.
Well ... it's good. I don't know if it's that good.
Cite your source.
You're avoiding the question. 'Enhances sexual experience. Increases euphoria.' Cite your source.
What magazine?
Never heard of it.
Oh ... now you want to go down that route?
Nah. Never mind.
Delta Airlines, Flight 1109, Boston-Miami, March '93, Ken Fuller. Hazel eyes, Organic Chem Lab TA, BMOC ... overrated ... in ... every aspect.  Could ... we ... get back to work, please?
Fine.
Handprints.  A stallion.
That guy was wearing khakis, right?
We get anything else off the clothes?
Hey.
Looks like a shoe sale. Uh, Nick sent these photo comparisons over from the lab.
Where are they?
These look like they weren't even used. There was more lubricant in the bathroom. It's pretty negligent for a doctor. She's got to know every commercial airline carries defib paddles.
I want to be Shannon. Good.
Excuse me -- it's 'Flight Attendant'.
Let me guess -- you're the computer geek.
So, I walk over ...
... try to calm the guy down, but he won't quit.
Warrick -- I mean, 'Marlene' -- that's when you got up and grabbed the broken wine neck.
Shannon's vapor-locked.
Hey, guys! If you jump a guy at the exit, he dies at the exit.
Hey.
Those people should be going to jail not some hotel on the Strip.
I know you're not condoning what they did.
Feeling 'vulnerable' is not a defense and where they were is irrelevant. They took a life.
I don't care what you say. I could never take a life.
Yeah, well, we were just talking about murder and whether we would commit it. I couldn't, Warrick could and Nick's on the fence. We're taking an exit poll.
You didn't even hesitate.
What do you think, Grissom?
I'm sorry. What are you saying?
Eight rolls. Two copies. Case is hot. Put a rush on it.
Lose an earring?
He was restrained. Some sort of tape.
Braun had company.
Where's the purge? Car blows its engine, there's an oil leak. A guy ODs, where's the body fluid? Urine, vomit, excrement.
Interesting love bites on the chest.
And he's posed.
When did you know this was a homicide and not an O.D.?
Yeah.
I have gone through every garbage can in the house.
First thing I checked. Zip.
Ooh, ooh, watch it! Evidence.
Cracker box. It was all stuck together, muckety-muck. I don't want to ruin any potential prints but I saw this TV dinner commercial and it hit me. I'm going to put it in the freezer.
Nice. Let's see if that's where my print came from.
Oh, listen to you. Would you rather hit a home run in the fourth or the bottom of the ninth?
Let me ask you something. Braun collected silver -- coins, bullion -- 23 tons of it. Why bury it in Blue Diamond?
What good's collecting silver coupons when you're dead?
You're telling us the prints on that tape aren't his or hers?
This is ridiculous.
Your prints came back unknown, too?
What about the brother?
Curt was digging up the silver to protect Janine's interest.
Couple of things on the priority list that haven't been processed yet: Tape lifts, adhesive residue, I got the earring back.
Living room, near the body.
Hey.
Nice of you to show up.
No.
Who died and made you boss?
Grissom gave you shift tonight.
Hey. Are you baking a cake? What's the hold up on my pills?
He didn't pass me over.
Grissom.
Activated carbon. Activated charcoal pills. Best antacid in the world. Coats the stomach and absorbs all impurities.
Our con man's a mule?
Without the pills, one bite of a chocolate bar would produce enough gastric acid in his stomach to eat away the balloon. Causing him to O.D.
Speaking of which I found airline stubs in Avery's shirt.
Vincent Avery was four-A, Ellie Rebecca was four-B. Strange, right, using two first names?
Hey, don't make me feel bad for doing my job.
What do you want from me? I'm working the case, the case is hot.
Clear.
Every serial number -- evidence.  bills have traces of cocaine on them?
Oh, yeah.
Hey, Ronnie you know what the intaglio script is.
I don't see it on this bill. Do you?
On a genuine bill, the words 'United States of America' are written on the border of Ben Franklin's portrait. On the Ortons' bill the intaglio script is blacked out.
What about pigmentation? Treasury seals and serial numbers are the same color, right?
Who do we notify? Treasury?
I'll put these back in the evidence room.
Wait till the Ortons find out what we do with counterfeit money.
Well, it's counterfeit. We have to take it out of circulation.
Mr. Orton, you don't look so surprised.
Because it's in violation of Title 18, Section 473 of the United States Code punishable by up to fifteen years for knowingly passing on bad money.
Do you have a $20 bill? 
Uh, I may have something. You see that ghost? Right there on the right? 
Government embeds them in all bills. Protects against forgeries. You should see Lincoln on the five; he looks really stressed out.
A Special Agent from Secret Service is going to want to talk to you about the final disposition of this case.
You were with Brass's daughter. I didn't want to interrupt you.
Agent Beckman? I'm Sara Sidle. We spoke on the phone. Could you excuse us for a minute?
Warrick ... 
This is why I didn't bring this to you.
I didn't not tell him. I ran with the case. I do it with Grissom all the time.
I didn't say it.
No, but it did get me thinking. If something doesn't feel right it probably isn't. Take a look. This is the money we got from the con man. See the serial numbers? Each one is different.
That's what threw Ronnie and I off the scent. This couple didn't make one bill and run off 100 copies with the same serial number. 
They had to burn separate plates for each serial number. 
Much harder to catch.
You mean the Ortons.
How long have you known that?
You federal guys are sneaky.
It's your money now. Well, the Treasury's.
Hey! I'm still part of this.
I don't 'tag' along.
AB Dick forty-nine ten  offsets this is the Rolls Royce of printers. Closest thing to what the government uses. Multiple inks. Disaperf computer paper.
Mr. Duffy, can Agent Beckman and I see your burn plates please.
Press, ink, paper, burn plates ... the only question now is ... where's the money? Mr. and Mrs. Duffy?
Oh, come on. You can print a million dollars a day with this operation. Where is it?
Excuse me? I don't get this. Beckman ... 
Passed?
I don't ... 
What if Vincent Avery wasn't murdered in that parking lot?
Wow. I don't feel that at all.
Hey.
Funny, very funny. 
Oh, look, shift's over. Guess you're one of us again.
Hey. Dispatch said suspicious circs.
You got a name?
'A Fairmont Home, You'll Never Roam?' Those billboards are everywhere.
Collar's off to the side, leg fabric's gathered.
We'll meet you there.
You never heard that phrase?
Thanks.
I know. The room's talking to us. They had champagne. 
They were celebrating something. 
No lipstick on either glass. 9-1-1 did say it was a man's voice that placed the call.
They kept the drapes open. A married man who's not worried about ... photographs, long lenses ... 
Or he has a death wish.  34 C? If he was with a woman, who was the guy on the 911 call?
The average American hotel room is covered with stains invisible to the naked eye.
No matter how clean or expensive the room seems that why always travel with nonoxinol nine.
Soda, maybe ... maybe champagne ... oh! Someone's little soldiers ... more champagne.
Hmm.
Rooms only on one side. Murder Central.
Why did he throw it?
I wonder if the woman has any idea she left her DNA behind?
Sure.
Semen. No surprise there.
I'm more interested ... in who the woman is.
What the heck?
Stripes.
Transverse white bands that appear six weeks after the onset of symptoms of toxicity.
They look like mees lines to me.
Or white striae, indicative of heavy metal poisoning.
Don't take this wrong, Dr. Robbins, but ... how do you release a body that's been redressed and dumped in an elevator?
The whole transplant thing didn't raise a flag?
Great.
I know that place.
Good. I'll drive. 
You're not coming?
Okay.
How long's he been in here?
Same person who approved the organ transplants.
We don't know the dose or the duration but we do know the type of poison. We processed your husband's remains. 
Most poisons would be completely burned off by cremation but heavy metals are very resistant to heat. This heavy metal -- selenium. 
Did you notice that your husband's breath might have been garlicky?
The body will excrete demethyl selenide -- smells just like garlic.
The white stripes on his fingernails--did you notice those?
That bother you, him never being home?
Did you know that the most common choice of premeditated murder among women is poison? They cite its passivity.
You cremated his body.
Do you want us to notify you?
When we find out the exact amount of selenium given to your husband and over what period of time?
Your husband's gone, but his organs are still out there.
Nick struck out on the kidney. I got four 'no's' over the phone. One yes from a recipient in Illinois-- heart.
Why can't we cut the middle man and just check the wife's house for selenium?  All right, I know, something about constitutional law. Get probable cause, then get a search warrant ...
Sorry, Greggo-- hot case. I'm going to go look at Nick's champagne bottle. How you doing with our DNA?
Nice.
Guys? You're not going to believe this.
Funny sometimes it is the simplest things that seems so difficult. I've been trying to match the partial from the champagne bottle to these known prints. It was upside down.
Mrs. Fairmont.
Fairmont had three gold crowns. They should've survived the cremation.
His wife ... had them removed at the mortuary. That adds new meaning to the phrase 'gold digger.'
Now they just marry them. In some countries, this would be enough to have her arrested for murdering her husband.
Poison.
Greg?
From the internet?
I could really, really just kiss you right now.
The secretary, ten years ago her husband, John Gideon.
Claudia's rich husband also died young-- 35.
We don't have to chase down these organs. Ralph Parks rejected the organ that he got from Claudia's husband.
The most. Liver. 
He died two months after receiving it back in '93. Lived one state over in Arizona. I have the cemetery address.
Awesome. We'll keep you posted.
Nick, did you get anything 
That's murder.
This is different than the shampoo compound.
Animals? Like cats, dogs?
To make up for the lack of selenium nutrient in the soil. How did Claudia get access to this stuff?
Yeah.
Our Julia Fairmont.
Ten years ago, you played secretary and you played wife.
Animal selenium, the kind used for cattle.
Implicating you, the secretary.
I don't believe this.
And then what? The two of you realized how quickly you could run through a couple million? So you went looking for another mark here in Nevada?
Brass doesn't have anything?
I like either one of them for the murder-- so will a jury.
Wait. What? So, what, and just let them move on to another state, another husband?
What are we doing? Digging up graves, chasing prints -- if it's no good in court ... if the killers win ...
I know that. I do. I know that. That's why I'm mad. 
You just said ... This is one of your riddles isn't it?
Uh, Grissom ...
The one thing you don't want to find at a murder scene.
I processed the crime scene. Lots of treads and tracks, but nothing salient.
I came up empty. I worked from the victims out till I hit the highway. Nothing. Nothing to process, no follow-up, zip. 
You have something.
Blond or brunette?
Twelve hundred miles and it's an older model. Driver doesn't get out much. 
Could be our blond. Related to Joan Marks. I'll check with DMV.
That's her.
She went through that door.
To take out one of these doors you need some serious momentum. 
Still going to be a long couple of days at the lab.
Or maybe her sister stepped in it. There was some blood on Joan Marks' right shoe. 
If Joan did step in Donna's blood that would mean that Donna was injured and bleeding while Joan was still walking around.
Sweet and sour pork.
Single servings in the back, spoiled. Family sized boxes in front, one or two days old.
Well, we already know she cooks like I do -- takeout on speed dial. 
Pottery barn, Lillian Vernon magnolia, Yafa Pen ... She's a catalogue junkie -- we're on the same mailing lists.
Ah, that's you talking.
I'll haul in her PC, check her e-mail look in on her social life.
Hey ... the toilet seat's up.
There was a man here.
Hey, Brass. Heard the database kicked out a Temporary Restraining Order. Joan Marks against her old boyfriend.
Tit for tat.
Don't mind if I do.
According to you. When did you see her last?
What was she driving?
Did she tell you she was going to her sister's?
What about you? You been to Donna's house recently?
May I ... see the bottom of your shoes?
Why not?
I like the shoes. I like them enough to get a warrant.
Donna Marks was a telecommunicator. Liked to shop. Mail order, over the phone. I retrieved lots of email confirmations.
Need for human contact.
She spent time in chat rooms. Book clubs, home crafts collected fountain pens.
Only one buddy on her buddy list. Screen name's 'Apollo.'
That would be three days ago.  'I know it sounds weird, but ... my life began when I first heard your voice ...' 
It's easy to wear your heart on your sleeve when you're not looking in his eyes. He said her name so their relationship must've extended beyond the computer.
You know that garbage those numbers at the bottom of every email?
It's actually a unique number that registers the location of the sender's terminal.
Internet Protocol Address. CSI has access. Seven different IP addresses means he used seven different computers.
Could be a network.
'23000 Ganza Avenue, Ely, Nevada. Western Nevada Correctional Facility.'
Hey.
How's the glass puzzle going?
Triangular. That means it can't be clothing fiber.
Yeah ... but that still doesn't get us anything. We found both vics near the freeway. We've been thinking vehicle transport from the start.
I'll ask him ... and his lawyer. The blood from his shoe was consistent with Donna Marks' DNA-- he lied. He was at the house.
Also a match. Joan and Gavin ... both stepped in Donna's blood.
We already know that. 
Broken glass a pool of blood.
Gavin, what color's your car? Your missing Thunderbird?
Interior?
But we will.
Hey. Brass is holding the boyfriend on a TRO violation. I'm going back to the lab to process the prints we lifted from the toilet seat. Guy claims he was in and out. I'm thinking no time to make a pit stop.
You did?
What?
Donna's cyber boyfriend? I thought he was in jail.
So she invites you for lunch everything's great. And somewhere between the fortune cookies and sunset ... Donna and her sister are both murdered. Thoughts?
She was vulnerable. No social life, no friends, not even a cat. All she had was her work. She ordered from catalogs to give herself something to look forward to.
Joan's boyfriend, Gavin Pallard -- blood on his shoe and a TRO. Donna's boyfriend, Mickey Rutledge -- opportunity and a rap sheet. Both hid the truth ... until confronted with the evidence.
Nice work.
P.D. Found GAVIN PALLARD'S Thunderbird hidden off the I-69 five miles from the dump site.
Radiator's cracked.
Well ... whoever drove this puppy last filled up the radiator fluid but, instead of coolant, they used water.
Radiator cap. I'll print it.
Hey, Nick.
You ever try to print a radiator cap? Smudge city.
Thank you.
But Joan went off on you. And up to that point, you hadn't done anything wrong. 
You figured if you hid the bodies, you'd be in the clear.
You could've just backed off, let Joan make the call.
you don't know that.
Hey, it's Sara. I was, uh, thinking ... You want to go out ... somewhere?
Yeah, it's true. Gunshot, suicide script leaves the body in a bathtub.
Grissom, Catherine briefed us about your birth date.
Rain washed away everything. What I got will never hold up in court.
This is the point of origin. They stop at the warehouse threshold.
Only one set of prints ... 
He carried the body in. The extra weight explains the deeper impression.
I believe hitchhiking is illegal in Clark County.
So, this is Walker's car. Millander was hitchhiking. Guy stops to do a favor ... ends up dead.
Nice.
It went out the window.
Warrick and I found stippling on the passenger side seat back.
Mud prints -- one set in, one set out.
Okay, how?
Did Walker have any kind of record?
Greg, did you look at the female hair from the crime scene tub?
Well, men and women both have testosterone in their systems. No big deal, right?
What? What do you mean? Like outside the body?
So our mystery lady was trying to enhance her athletic performance?
Not yet anyway. Okay, I'm not sure what this means yet, but thanks.
Yeah, he planted it. He planted his own hair.
With endogenous testosterone. Pauline was taking male hormone injections.
My theory? s*x change.
There is no birth or death record for Pauline.
This is nice.
I cannot believe you brought that up.
Yeah, that-that-that, uh, day we met that-that was, that was very gross. 
Um... I mean, not for me but for everyone else ... for you ...
Yeah.
She barely made eye contact. She dropped the finger on the table and walked out.
Locked up at the coroner's lab, waiting for Dr. Robbins. Unless you want me to wake him up in Kansas City. Brother's wedding, back tomorrow ... 
Top half severed just below the right inter-costal joint.
Yeah, I couldn't tell. There was blood, though.
Like I told Nick, she completely ignored me.
No ... no, looked to me like Catherine was running the show.
It's a bit of a coincidence, though, don't you think? Catherine just showing up at the diner. It's not like she knew I was going to be there.
Thank you, Catherine.
She was burning some serious rubber. Definitely high-end tires -- there's colored flecks on the treads and they're fresh. 
It's got to be the Lexus. Does this mean anything to you?
Yeah.
Looks like the drop-off went down.
Thank you.
Looks like a small tear.
If the body was wrapped with this side that's on the outside.
It's not blood.
This is a grease stain. It's got an oily residue.
Yeah.
Peanut butter.
You got to admit, his solution was ingenious.
If not by the police, by his wife.
Why though? The money was in a suitcase.
How could he possibly know that Catherine was going to mark the money?
Wow, you got to go to the body farm?
I've always wanted to go there. What was it like?
What, bad milk? Cottage-cheese bad?
Yeah. He's got one of his experiments in there.
Not bugs.
So, this is your experiment, huh? So, because you found beef in the wound tracts of the victim, you think the meat might be from one of the body farm cows?
I did an experiment similar to this in San Francisco except the cross-contamination was blood. Wasn't a murder case, but it was instructional.
Hmm, what does that mean?
Uh, Grissom ... aren't you going to tell me anything?
The case, the meat, what you found ...?
I thought I was working it with you.
That meat... the raw meat... me?
How many meals have we shared together?
Take a guess -- over a year working together.
I'm a vegetarian. Everyone here knows I'm a vegetarian. I haven't eaten meat since we stayed up that night with that dead pig. It pains me to see ground beef; forget about cleaning it up.
Almost finished.
Acetone, methyl methacrylate? Nail polish remover.
It's, uh, just what it says: It's a request for a leave of absence -- six months ... year, maybe.
I was thinking of checking out the federal government system - FBI ...
I need a different work environment.
One with, um, communication ... respect.
You don't.
No, Grissom ... this is not about that 'Hamburger' thing. I-I-I don't believe you. How can you reduce everything that I've said to some kind of single quirk? Do you think the problem here is just about me? 
If you don't sign my leave, I'm going to have to quit.
Great.
Boys will be boys.
You just don't like sports.
Baseball. Well, that figures. All those stats.
Since when are you interested in beauty?
Sure.
It's not much to go on. Maybe we should be looking off the ice.
Charlie Brown. 'I love a zamboni.'
Yeah?
Pile of ice measures nine feet by five feet ... by ... nine feet. Without the calculus, I'd estimate ... a hundred cubic feet. Current temperature, one degree celsius.
Let's ballpark it.
120 minutes for a tooth ... the whole tooth ... and nothing but the tooth.
Take your pick. Testing for blood on a hockey jersey it's like handing out jaywalking tickets at a marathon.
You sucked at team sports, huh?
Chess is not a sport, Greg.
I think sports are physical by definition.
Not to me.
These blades skated through the blood pool.
Blood spatter. Good guess -- this is the one that did the damage.
These blades are probably set at a quarter of an inch.
And deadly in a fight.
Not now ... but you used to.
He was a stationary target. Terry was on the bottom of all those bodies. 
You okay? You all right?
Morning sickness?
Little lie, big lie.
She wasn't showing. She's skinny as a rail. But ... still, why lie about it?
I wonder if she would know who the father is... or was.
It's enough to get us a warrant.
We could search Jane Gallagher's apartment. See if Terry Rivers might have left anything behind.
Bye, Greg.
There are semen stains everywhere. Not very Victoria Secret.
Beauty, Grissom. Remember? 
With all the s*x these people are having maybe I should take up hockey.
I got your page. What's the big news?
What? I thought it belonged to the dead guy.
Is that why you hated Terry?
You're the captain of the rat pack. You make it so everyone gets a shot in and no one takes the blame -- it's a win-win situation.
You know we got his medical records. Let me ask you a question. When Terry came to did he tell you what had happened to him?
What did you do?
... and what's the difference?
Yeah.
Right here.
Didn't have access to quinine let alone know it would kill him.
Terry was a roughneck. He dished it out so the other players dished it out harder.
Someone besides Terry had to know.
Anyone with access to Terry's medical records knew how to kill him.
Malaria in Las Vegas. No wonder they were out of stock.
So you're the go-to guy?
Italy. That's pretty serious.
And you knew, doctor. Terry Rivers had a heart condition.
Jane told us she paid you a visit a couple of days ago. She thought she had the flu ... but she didn't. She's pregnant. And with the father out of the way, you knew who she would turn to.
State your source.
Rug's low pile, smooth. I'll try to dust-lift.
Gold statues ... money trees ... that's a lot of loot to leave behind. 
Gangbangers? At a Buddhist Temple?
Yeah, but just 'cause you're stashing trash doesn't make you a killer.
I found some boot prints on the prayer room rug. Monks don't wear boots, right, Nick?
I also found a smudge with some trace material on a small statue. It was a partial, some ridge detail, but not make-able and a wad of gum that was stuck to the big Buddha. All of which is definitely pointing to an outside job.
You know those prints that Nick and I got off the rifle?
Well, I better talk fast, then. The prints are only telling half the story. You know when a shooter holds a gun ...
... he grips the barrel and he wraps his index finger around the trigger? 
Ananda never fingered the trigger.
On the weapon, but definitely not where they should be.
He held the rifle by the stock, barrel pointing down.
No. Anticipating your next question, the rifle's not registered.
That chewing gum -- is with DNA.
'Proud U.S.'
The coffee shop?
Sure.
Uh, Grissom, I found these on the front seat.
You were there, weren't you?
I feel so useless.
It's a pretty wide area up there. Are we clear to call in for help?
Four-point sweep.
Shreds of rubber everywhere. Between the crash, and all the other interstate traffic it might as well be the Indy 500. This stuff could be from any vehicle.
You mean that 'Grissom' look?  Second set of skid marks. Camaro.
If this is the bus ... the bus begins to slide right. Driver overcorrects.
Meanwhile the Camaro's holding steady in the right lane heading straight for us.
Taking out anything in its path.
Bus crosses four lanes of traffic and only takes out the car behind it?
A bolt? Nice. I got twenty of them.
It is, isn't it?
Bolts are graded according to their hardness. The higher the grade, the stronger the steel.
Bus company was using bogus bolts.
The gouge in the road.
Nope, only two sets of fresh skid marks on that stretch of highway.
I know. I want to wait. 
Greg? You're really good at what you do.
Sabotage.
Grissom.
I didn't see it.
But why did the tire come apart in the first place?
I do. Chloroform. Inside the tire.
I found chloroform in the interior fragments of the rubber.
Yeah, I'll be at trace. They're going to love this.
You busy?
Then I have a question for you. 
Uh-huh. 
No, he didn't.
Listen, I-I found chloroform on the inside of a steel-belted radial and I need to know how it got there.
Not in a scientific context, no.
Yes.
Chloroform, glass rod, valve core remover ....  according to Vincent and Trace, it's like pissing down a rope.
Reattach the valve ... reinflate the tire ...
...and you're done. Minute, minute and a half tops.
Ah, yeah, I'm going to go dust that right rim. I'll see you guys.
Print off the rim maybe he had a work card on file-- a Sean Nolan. 
I pulled up his DMV records looking for an address. I found one, not recent, but ... he's got a class B license with passenger endorsement.
I cross-checked his name with the employee roster from Mojave Express.
He's a driver.
Hello.
Cool.
And I got a hit off that print -- a Sean Nolan, employed by Mojave Express.
Uh, his route is ... Vegas/Grand Canyon but I'll call Warrick. He's on his way to the bus company right now.
And I quote, 'in his off time, he enjoys creating and inventing toys.' That's fascinating. What kind of toys do you make, Nick?
Greg.
Yay.
And according to the phone records the guy called Jane thirteen times the day of the murder.
Hey, Brass? Isn't that his car?
Control, this is P-9241 requesting backup and medical assistance. The 1800 block of Newhaven Road. Possible 419.
Sir, are you okay? You all right? You seem injured.
Any idea how you got this blood?
Adam, we're analyzing the blood that we found on your shirt with the blood of your girlfriend. It's going to tell us everything that we want to know.
She had a TRO against you. Something must have happened to spook her.
Well, that's interesting because according to her phone records, she never did ... call the cops.
Adam? That's not all you were taking last night.
Secretary at a brokerage firm. About three weeks from the day of her death she took a leave of absence.
She saw Dr. Slater. Had a prescription for valium and librium.
Severe anxiety due to personal reasons. One day back from leave, Jane quits her job. No notice. Hotel receipts show she checked into the Monaco for two nights.
A week before that she goes on a frightened woman shopping spree.
Hardware shop receipts for locks. Locksmiths. Alarm installations. Phone screeners. The voice on her answering machine-- electronic. She change her telephone number. She cancels all but one of her credit cards.
Make no mistake. Jane Galloway was being stalked. Emotional terrorism at its finest.
Here's the, uh, worst part. Uh, I ran a phone check on all her incoming calls. Guess where they were coming from.
Will do, thank you, doctor.
Now, did you not just hear the doctor? You're supposed to rest. We're on it, okay?
How's it going?
Well, groggy. How's the epic?
Found that photo of Nick and his prom date. Used Jane Galloway to emulate the photo?
Nick has satellite cable, right?
Twenty-five years to life, Nick. It's over.
Okay.
Hey, Nick ... ?
You ever been to a swingers' party?
Frat party, huh? I wouldn't know anything about that. 
How wild?
Who's she?
I don't know what I'm looking for.
Yeah. But we always go back to the body. The body tells a story and in this case, the body says there was no crime and you're not listening. Why?
Like, for instance, when we don't agree with the coroner's report?
Germs.
Relevance ...
The rubber soles of his boots should have protected him from the electrical shock. That is why you're safe when you're in a car during a lightening storm. You're insulated by the rubber tires.
A nail.
Hey.
How's that palm print Grissom got off those cutters?
Nice.
I don't know. We found a nail in his boot. It could have pierced the protective rubber. It might have allowed electricity to course through his body.
Fired?
Yeah, yeah, we do. The, um ... it's a former union guy turned night shift project manager.
Waiting for an assignment. You got a new case for us?
No, because ... 
I'll compared it to Bob Harris' ten card. Anything else?
Okay.
Warrick.
I got a thumbprint off that nail.
Only a partial. Print lab's running a comparison.
Serrations didn't match up. They weren't used on the grounding prong. What's in the envelope?
You want lunch?
Egg salad sandwich. You want half?
Yeah. 
You can have it.
You turned my pickle into a light bulb.
You sure are.
There are none.
The iron conducted the electricity.
In through his hand from the drill; out through the nail in the boot.
She's cross-eyed from running our partial. I didn't want to lose any time, so I took over. The database is 70,000. It could still take a while.
We got a suspect?
Partial overlay. Perfect match. Now we've just got to place him at the crime scene.
Wolf stuck a nail in Valenti's boot, compromised the drill and cut the grounding prong with his own cutters.
We quit before we should have.
I'll race you!
Anyone touch the bag since?
I thought you Emergency Service guys were tougher than that.
Down, boy. It was a joke.
Great.
Body's coroner's. Property's ours.
Wouldn't it be easier to just unzip the bag and see what kind of shape our vic is in?
I see a coin. Looks like a half dollar. 
I'd say we're dealing with a man.
Sound? 
Silver dollar.
Ugh.
That's it? No organs? No-no tonsils? No ... 
... soup?
Okay, I'll take liquid man's jacket, see what I can find.
Yeah.
What?
You mean 'Mr. Cartsen'? I found this. It's a nametag. 
Well, it's a start. I'm going to get homicide to check the VA medical database for a 'W. Cartsen' with plates or pins.
What do you got?
God, it reeks! Q.D. Should be able to, uh ... to bring something up. 
Don't tell anyone.
Hi.
Yeah. Um ... I'll be right out. 
Give me a mint.
Just give me.
This is a nice surprise 
Yeah. Um ... when?
Oh, well, I'm in the middle of that D.B. From the gully. He's still a John Doe and we don't know the circumstances ... 
I smell.
I changed clothes ... tho' the problem is that it's human fat reduced and it's attached itself to my follicles and my pores, so ... 
You don't look good.
Ok..
Right.
Okay.
Bye.
I've heard.
Hey, Nick. Ronnie's got something on Liquid Man, says it's hot.
Science nerd.
'Roma ...' 'Roman ... nini's...' Never heard of it.
When was that?
That's funny we found his body. Coroner says he's been dead two months.
So you didn't hurt him. You just put him in your car. Is that what you're saying?
These ... are the handles from the bag that he was found in. 
You see these prints here?
Any uniformity in the spray?
Blood drops this size are characteristic of high-velocity impact like gunshot trauma but there's no bullet strikes on the walls ... ruling out murder by gun.
This looks like a multiple. More than one vic. Acquainting myself.
Triangle ... coat rack?
No observable blood. Not even with pheno.
How long did Firearms give us these for?
Let's do it.
Same high-velocity spray.
Didn't you say expirating through the nose made oval patterns?
Great. Our big murderer's a nosebleed.
Our guy's girlfriend is still missing.
Or everything.
What are we looking for exactly?
What about Nosebleed's missing girlfriend? You heard Brass. 
He got a-hold of Alison Scott's parents in Canada. They said she never arrived. They had no idea she was even going to see them.
What if nose man blew blood all over these walls to cover up Alison Scott's blood?
You're not finding another layer of blood under there?
You don't think maybe he off'ed his girlfriend?
Fifteen ... give or take.
Fly spots. Regurgitations.
Place is sealed, and they don't spontaneously generate.
Or it could be something higher up the food chain like Alison Scott.
They can egress a space less than .001 centimeters.
Behind you. Vent.
Fly egg casings.
You can contact Captain Brass for that information, sir.
What do you got?
A very important beetle.
There's a dead body in here somewhere.
But you can submit a form to the city for reimbursement.
Now what?
Ahhh ... Not so. According to Grissom -- Mr. Bug Guy -- the silphid beetle will actually feed on any decomposing mammal. So we need to show human DNA or we are not going to get a warrant to break down those walls.
Where's Greg? We need to get this processed. You know, I swear that guy has a second job somewhere else.
Did we get our warrant?
You're Alison Scott?
A square of nine dots on paper and you can only draw four lines to connect them ... without the pen ever leaving the paper.
You've re-plastered this wall recently?
Huh.
Yeah ...
Hold up. Hold up. Hold up.
Alklyd. There's blood on the blanket.
That's Latin for 'you're hiding a dead body'.
You okay?
Excuse me?
You're too hard on yourself.
What's your pulse at now?
You want to take a walk around the block? Get some air?
Clear your head ...
Okay.
Chalk ... from plaster.
Better go wash up.
Hey, you want to grab some breakfast?
Sorry, guys. I lost you at the fork.
Give me your right foot. Other right. Put it down. Lift it up.
Other foot. Lift it up. Put it down.
Flour, maybe?
Trace will probably have a better idea. I'll get DNA to see if there's bits of Ben under the fingernails.
You told me to wait for you.
I did observe some fibers in the wound. I didn't collect them, though.
Yellow. Not cotton; satin, maybe.
Strangled with his own tie?
I cannot tell you why, but I might be able to tell you where. A pizza shop. The flour on Oliver Dunne has a low gluten content -- seven percent protein -- it's typical of flour used to make cakes, pizzas, that kind of thing.
Well, the subtype of flour is another subtype -- double zero. It's a very fine flour used only in pizza-baking ovens. Oh, and trace picked up some oregano in the sample. When are you set to interview Ben?
What is that? A beer can? Soda can?
Zilch.
Whoa... whoa. Point of disturbance.
Grissom ...
Different from the first guy.
Strangers. Doesn't make sense. There's no connection.
Two men were shot and killed and you didn't see anything?
You what?
Pump jockey wasn't very helpful but bullets pulled from victim one and victim two. 
Identical striations. Bullets in both victims were fired by the exact same weapon.
P.D. Can prove through credit cards that Ben frequents the AvCon gas stations where both vics were killed.
And fibers.
I recovered a burgundy fiber from the sock of victim one. Found the same fiber on the sock of victim two.
So we went back to Ben's car.
We got the master standards from the car manufacturer. The assigned name for the material is '12-ounce Merlot-Poly.'
Victim blood on his clothes ... Under his nails.
... The holes in Christ's hands, Doubting Thomas?
Does this have anything to do with the priest that's been coming around here?
What's going on?
Yeah.
Anything on the list besides the tie?
Hey, guys.
Whoa.
Hey. Dry cleaning. The trailer's low-rent. Dry cleaning's expensive.
This man's not as smart as he thinks. Dry cleaning bakes in blood stains.
Oh, now you're cautious.
Okay. You check the perimeter and I'll see if we have blood stains or red sauce.
Hemoglobin.  Take a look at this.
Nick?
Hey, Nick.
Is the printer out of ink?  'ND, ND, ND.'
Try again. This could be victim blood. Try again.
My evidence is no better. Total loss.
Hey. D.A.'S looking for you.
What, you think I read your messages? 
'Top Secret' and 'Urgent'? It's a gift, reading upside down.
Guess we know what she was calling about.
Let me guess -- the guy makes his run same time every week.
Whole thing went down here?
Okay, I'm going to do a once-around.
Hey, Warrick! Check this out!
Grab the money bag, slice it and run.
Let's see.
We got some checks, no cash ... and a deposit slip for $22,500.
Same time every week.
Or... it was an inside job.
Um, Ms. Delgado, I know you're upset ...
So ... you think the brother might be behind this?
Nice scam.
That means whoever put these here wasn't gone long when the brother was shot. 
Potential eyewitness.
Hey, is that our guy?
How often do you distribute around here?
Well, that depends. Did you see anything unusual last night? In the parking lot at Flamingo and Rhodes?
What about the car? Did you notice the make?
According to Vega the vic owns a colt.
And ... since he mysteriously got shot in the leg instead of a vital organ I'm thinking I should go visit him.
You cant' wear them out of here, so what? You want them as a souvenir?
What do you know about the money bag?
Big knife. Great. Tell us something we don't know.
Nice.
It's gotta be transfers from the knife. Red fibers. All uniform length. 
A mold? To make what?
Everybody in the bath business uses isophthalic resin because it's got the highest water resistance. Downside is the stuff gets everywhere. Hair, clothes, skin ...
We found traces of fiberglass and resin in Santee's money bag.
So, how many knives in Vegas come into contact with both those materials? 
Thanks.
We never said what model we were looking for.
Pretty smart, Hector.
Oh, by the way we found the $5,000 you skimmed from this business in your jeans pocket.
Yeah.
It's peaceful.
I thought you said this was a single homicide.
We made it. State trooper.
Officer Spencer, did you touch anything?
Sorry.
Vomit?
A poor man's silencer.
Last paying customer -- eight hours ago.
The assailant flipped the sign on the way out, buying him time to get away.
It's plastic.
Nine volt attached to a blinking light.
Wow. A fumette. Did you get that out of some museum?
If you were in a hurry how would you get back there?
Exactly what I'm thinking.
Shoe prints.
Suspect entered ... 
... shoots the clerk through the potato... then hops up and over, leaving behind shoe prints ... grabs the cash ... flips the sign from
What are you thinking? 
We may be looking for a minor.
Eh, why not? They're in the kit.
Since when do you care about my choice of powders?
You know, I've never tried green ...
Do you have a mirror?
Crime scene?? It's not for me.
I'm just getting a better look.
Hey, David. I wasn't touching him.
Skechers. Adult size five. Female.
How's the prints coming?
Great.
You got to be kidding me. 'Officer Moron' contaminated the scene.
What have you got?
Who's Tammy Felton?
Biological parents?
Cath, got another match from the convenience store. The print on the outside doorknob belongs to an ex-con, Darin Hanson.
You know this guy, too?
Greed. Fewer slices. Bigger pieces. 
But now he's dead. So, who killed him, and where's the money?
We've got more questions than answers.
What are we looking for?
He ducked before the chandelier fell.
I.D. the 'unknown', good chance we solve both cases: Laughlin and Vegas.
That's Dustin Bale. 
Whoa. Hold on. He was killed hours before the tower club heist. In on Laughlin, out on Vegas. So, Darin took him out first. They cleared the register just to make it look like a robbery.
Because he knew there were four at the Laughlin heist.
And we're back to who killed Darin Hanson.
No signs of forced entry?
Hmmm ...
Hey.
You pronounce?
It's atypical for a female. Women usually commit suicide in the tub. It's easier cleanup for whoever's left behind.
Warrick. 
Did her parents say whether she was living with a man?
It's okay, babe.
I'm sorry.
There's a stain here. So cold stains.
It's cool to the touch, yeah.
There's no hesitation marks. Isn't that uncommon for suicide?
This D.B. is all wrong. Someone moved her two feet from where she bled out. What did the tox screen say?
Thank you.
Is that glass in her hair?
We didn't see any broken glass in her apartment. Round edges, tinted ... 
... it looks polarized.
Yeah. Too bad it didn't protect her.
Hey. You got something on that glass?
Glad to you're settling in, Hodges.
Maybe she was in some kind of car accident. Hit-and-run ... 
Stranger things have happened. If you weren't such a lab rat, you would know that. You got a make of a car for me?
Thank you.
The windshield's intact.
Yeah. Let's take a look.
You know, you can tell a lot about a person by what they leave in their car.
Rotten bananas.
I got a paycheck. Who would do that?
Still tacky.
Crime lab. How are you?
We noticed you had your windshield replaced recently. The adhesive's seeping.
Did replacing the windshield have anything with the tenant in apartment
Thank you.  I would like to see Linda Damen's tox report.
Thank you. I'll get it to a detective.
Oh, we don't know yet. We're going to wait and see what the evidence tells us. I did meet a tenant at your daughter's apartment complex that described Linda as ... troubled. Did you ever witness her being violent?
She was diagnosed bipolar?
Lithium didn't help?
I'm sorry for your loss.
How did you track him down?
What is he doing?
What are the notebooks for?
You know, the more I see of this kind of stuff the less I picture you a gambler.
We're going to need your shirt.
Bipolar girl meets a bipolar guy. Together, they cut out their medication. She ends up committing suicide.
Yeah. Hey, Doc.
Valium? 
That doesn't make any sense. I mean, that's the last thing a depressed person would take.
That much valium. There's no way she could have fought somebody off if they were coming after her with a straight razor.
I think we better go pay mom a visit.
The tox report says Linda had five times the normal dose of valium in her system. Because there were no hesitation marks on her wrists it suggests that someone else inflicted the wound. That much valium would've been enough to subdue her.
Excuse me.
Hello?
Male or female?
Thanks, Greg.
Mr. And Mrs. Damen, there are five types of tears -- sorrow, regret, joy, fear and allergic reaction. The one thing that they have in common is DNA. We found a blouse in your daughter's closet the night that she died. There was moisture on it. The moisture... was tears. The DNA ...  ... was male. 
Mr. Damen? Were you waiting in the closet for your daughter?
What's that?
You know the average Nevadan generates more waste more than three times waste than the average American?
Thirteen million pounds per day. I went to the recycling forum in march.
It's like peeling an onion into peoples' lives.
What've you got?
All right. I got a torso and head. Missing an eye.
She should be totally bloated.
Bulldozers are vicious.
All right, what do we know?
Yeah, there's nothing wrong with this frying pan. Could've gone to goodwill or someplace.
Someone ... does not like frozen peas.
There's a good chance our vic was wearing this shirt.
Excellent idea. Uh, marker or sort?
Cans are on private property, it's not trash day, how did you get consent?
Hey, guys? I got blood.
If the vic was in here blood would have pooled to the bottom.
This is our can.
Well, she wasn't in town on business.
Nothing risqué about the rest of her wardrobe.
Okay.
I don't think these belong to dad.
You tell me. Whatever it is, it must've worked. She was back in your bedroom.
She's a virgin? What are we talking about, an immaculate conception?
It's all in her head? Well, that would explain what she was doing in dad's bed.
It kind of makes sense. Hormones travel the same channels as adrenaline.
The father was clueless.
Nora's in love with her father, in an Electra kind of way.
Where do I sign up?
Your message said it was important.
It should be a slam dunk.
What?
Melissa, we've been building this case together for six months. What's going on?
I never felt comfortable asking you about your, uh ... 
I mean, I know somebody broke into your house, shot you and your husband.
Well, if they're fixing the artery, that's good.
Hey, Doc. You got a minute?
So I hear.
Um ... a friend of mine's going in for surgery. Traumatic Basilar Artery Aneurysm. You, uh, mind walking me through it?
She said she was going to die.
Thanks.
Excuse me, do you know where I can find Dr. Stewart?
Thanks.
Dr. Stewart. Sara Sidle. I'm a friend of Melissa Winters.
She did?
Thanks. Thank you.
Hey, Doc?
When you were in there did you, by any chance, remove the bullet?
You think I could have it? I'm, uh ... I'm with the crime lab. It's the only evidence in a cold case.
Three years. Prosecutor friend of mine walked in to find a guy shooting her husband, then he turned the gun on her. She just had it surgically removed. 
Yeah.
Yeah, I did.
Hey, hey, careful with that bullet, it's my only evidence.
It was a through and through. The bullet decimated upon impact with the couch ...  ... with the couch frame.
Thank you. Page me?
Did you know the lead CSI on this case, Terry Flannery?
These are exit wounds from the husband's back. What do you see?
The only way you get marks like these is when the vic's back is pressed against something-- a floor, a wall. How did Flannery miss this?
I don't want to get her hopes up. 
You got something?
Cops recover the gun?
Roger Wilder. I'm liking you already.
Oh, bad memory? Let me you. She was the Assistant DA who prosecuted you for assault five years ago. She got you sentenced to four years.
Well, the trial transcript says at the sentencing you yelled at her, 'What goes around, comes around.'?
So was it just a coincidence that three weeks after you got out of jail, Mrs. Winters and her husband were shot in her own home? 
We recently recovered a bullet from Melissa's head. It happens to match a bullet fired from the gun that you used in your latest felony. You know what we call that? Corroborating evidence. I guess I'd keep my mouth shut, too. Three years have passed. You don't have to say anything, but I have to tell you that evidence persists. A fingerprint ... a fiber ... a hair. If I find one shred of physical evidence that places you in the winters' house, there is not a jury in Clark County that will not give you the death penalty.
Did you knock or did you use the doorbell?
A gun just fell from a table.
Roger Wilder said he was inside Melissa's house which is true. He described the exact layout of the room. But he said he found the gun when he destroyed the coffee table and I have no evidence to disprove that.
I don't know.
That's a very good question. I knew something was off when we saw that shored wound. It didn't match up with Melissa's account. If her husband was standing up like Melissa said when he was shot blood would have dripped down from the entry wound to the belt buckle.
This blood trail ... the only way it's going ... south ... he was laying down. 
She lied.
Hey. You did it.
Lucky and smart. 
I reopened your case.
I know what you did, Melissa. I examined the evidence. Your husband wasn't-standing in front of the couch struggling with some stranger.
There was no stranger. He was, uh, asleep, wasn't he? On the couch?
You had a CSI who was about to retire who was predisposed to believe the testimony of an honest prosecutor like you. Especially since you got shot, too?
See, he leaned up from a prone position.
The directionality of the blood tells the story.
And you couldn't let anyone find that gun. They would have tested your hands for GSR.
Somebody else did that for you. I almost had him arrested for a murder you committed. 
All your closing arguments, all your big talk about Justice. I fell for all of it.
You never expected to live, did you?
I guess I'll be seeing you in court. Good-bye, Melissa.
The cop read Melissa her rights right there in the hospital room. You think you know somebody.
Ever? 
When I was a kid I was playing hide-and-seek one day and I found this plastic bag under my big brother's bed. I thought it was a bag of dirt so I took it to my mom. Turned out it was his bag of weed. He was grounded for a year.
Emerson?
Never been.
Uh, pass.
Is this a dance club or a s*x club?
Whatever you say, Superfly.
Mm-hmm.
These people are freaks.
Vic had short hair.
Okay, that's enough. 
Drugs.
You shouldn't be handling evidence. You're not on the case.
So, it was just the two of you?
Was it an apartment building ... maybe ... or maybe an office building?
Catherine ...
It's okay, Lindsey. Nobody's mad at anybody.
Can I talk to you for a second?
It's okay.
This lady with the pink hair -- was she your father's girlfriend?
GHB with food coloring. That's a date rape drug.
Everyone's a chemist. Thanks.
We've already seen him. He's in the morgue.
Aren't recording studios supposed to be soundproof?
After Candeece left, did you guys keep recording?
What happened to your wrist?
According to Desert Palms Emergency Room, you came in last night with a fracture of the ulna. It's a common injury in car accidents -- air bag specific.
Air bags are packed with cornstarch or talc. It helps them deploy. It also wreaks havoc on the eyes.
Sounds pretty heroic.
There were two other people in the car.
See, that's where it gets a little less heroic -- we found Lindsey alone in a sinking car.
Get to a phone, call the cops, call an ambulance, anything, actually ... other than what you did.
Catherine. 
Catherine?
What the hell are you doing? Do you know where you're at right now?
And you should know better.
There is a difference between me doing my job and you wanting to do it for me. You don't want to get the job done. What you want, right now, is revenge.
Go home, Catherine. Be with your daughter. She's the one that needs you.
Catherine left Eddie at 5:30 P.M. Lindsey's first call was logged in at
Let's look at the drum track.
So any irregularity in the pattern could be from an outside source.
Can you isolate it?
Sounds like gunfire.
What is that?
Or a suspect.
But not the last one. You got an address?
I like your Harley.
Mr. Kiner, do you own this house?
Your father have a drug problem? We found GHB in your garage. 'Georgia home boy.' 
Your drug dealer.
I got two liars and no murder weapon ... and no choice. I'm going to nail the singer on child endangerment and fleeing the scene, and the dealer goes up on possession for sale.
Cath, I did my best.
Catherine wanted to know if you have anything. She can't convince Tavian to change his mind about the ransom money.
No DNA.
What about the text? It's just standard laser, nondescript. So you got nothing. 
Hank? Your wrist is broken.
What happened?
Mind if I take over?
You okay?
So that's what all this is about.
Any time. 
Yeah, but ... will you call me if you need anything? My cell will be on. Anything.
Okay.
Anything else?
Where are you going?
Oh.
Are you the Restaurant Manager?
I'm Sara Sidle, Crime Lab.
Where were you during the crash?
Did you see anything?
Yeah, I didn't ask you. Thanks for your time.
I'm sorry. I got wrapped up in ...
Yeah.  An old jaguar with a GPS unit. That's strange.
How's she doing?
Relative?
Hi, Corey? I'm, uh, Sara Sidle. I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab. Mind if I ask you a couple questions?
Corey, um... did your grandmother own a Jaguar?
She also win the GPS?
Can you excuse me for a second?
Hey.
'And the EMT of the year award goes to ...'
You were amazing.
Yeah, you never know when your life's going to change.
You need a lift?
Hank?  I'm really glad you're okay.
No.
What about pre-impact? At the risk of feeding a stereotype, she was 72. Any indication of stroke, Alzheimer's, heart attack?
Well, that's a bummer, 'cause at this point, we got no forensic one, either.
I believe it's my case.
You're crowding me, Greg.
I downloaded the memory from the GPS in the jaguar. She wasn't a local; I wanted to see if she got lost.
Diane Lambert lives in Laughlin. 
Excuse me. 
She took 95 North to Summerlin parkway. Then she took parkway to Rampart, made a left on main street and headed straight to Meadows Lane -- 16
What do you have, Greg?
Grass?
Well, wait, wait, wait. Grandma was high?
Grandma was high ... 
Hey.
Yeah. Was Diane Lambert legally impaired?
Oh. But if she were a long time user, her reaction time could've been slowed down, right?
Okay, why was a woman her age doping up?
Nerve's damaged.  She had glaucoma. I thought you said she was in good health.
Her vision could've been impaired by the glaucoma.
Hello.
Who? 
They must be friends. I saw him with her at the hospital.
That's more than twice the speed limit.
Gas pedal could've gotten stuck, or ... throttle plate could've jammed.
I'm on it.
No. Car checks out perfectly.
Could be a death trap.
Sun sets in the west behind us. Glare could be pretty intense in the afternoon.  This could explain why this intersection is so dangerous.
Well, according to the accident report, the sun set at 5:30 yesterday.
Trees and buildings extend at least ten degrees above the western horizon.
15. Sun moves about 15 degrees an hour.
At 5:15 yesterday, the sun would've been about what -- 3.75 degrees above the horizon?
Great, and our investigation is still in the dark.
Mm-hmm.
I'm running with a hunch.
Acetylcholine levels were low, epinephrine was high.
Kamikaze pilots, World War II -- their blood work was very unusual. Acetylcholine was low; epinephrine was through the roof.
Diane Lambert lived two hours away. If she drove her car into Vegas with the intention of using it as a murder weapon, I imagine she would be pretty stressed out.
If the crash was intentional, I'm thinking either the restaurant was the target or someone inside the restaurant.
If she was gunning for someone specific, there's a lot of variables. Maybe we should start with the most obvious targets -- the people sitting in the window.
Second table: Rachel Krandall, and ... Tom Krandall. Both died at the scene. Both worked for Sillmont Healthcare.
Three out of five of the people sitting in the window work at Sillmont Healthcare. Maybe I should go talk to her.
Well, uh, could she be one of your policy holders?
That'd be great.
Thank you. Um, I-I have to get back to the lab. Um, maybe you could call me.
Hey.
She didn't have anything to add to the investigation.
There's only one Vegas phone number on this statement and the prior statement. There's got to be 80 calls here to the same number.
What's your address? 
Thank you.
If Sillmont Healthcare was the intended target, how did she end up at the Checkerbox?
Either way ... it does leave one question: Why was Diane Lambert so angry?
Then you won't mind if we take a look at her file.
Mrs. Lambert had colon cancer.
No, actually, her most recent cat scan shows recurrence two months ago. That's about the same time she started calling your office two times a day. Why would she be calling you?
Did treatment commence?
What were you, playing the odds? Were you hoping she would die before you had to spend a dime?
Catherine.
We missed something.
Corey, when I was reviewing your grandmother's insurance policy, I noticed she that didn't specify an e-mail address, and that got me thinking. Some people her age aren't technologically savvy. Maybe a GPS device would be intimidating to her. I wondered if she actually even knew how to use it. So I printed the unit and I found your fingerprints on it.
The prints just weren't on the base of the unit, they were on the face. You punched in addresses.
She never mentioned it to you?
Your grandmother's death has been ruled a suicide, which nullifies the policy. There's not going to be any money.
Yeah, she's really something.  I didn't tell her about us, if that's what you're wondering.
Yeah, me, too.
I'll see you around.
Nope.
Drive.
No. No, no, forget it.
No.
No, Nick ...
DNA hit on the soap mummy?
You got to love CODIS. What's his felony?
Well, that fits. You know that fraternity ring? It's not a fraternity ring. Omega-Zeta-Alpha is a mechanical engineering honor society.
Spiker Chick, Donsueme, Slaughter 10? You really think one of these things killed your vic?
Well, you know what they say -- it's what's on the inside that counts.
I got blood.
I'll take these to Greg.
Ring's not his.
Bingo.
Well, we proved it couldn't have happened the way that Brian said it did. You may have your killer.
You've got a transmitter module in the remote and a receiver module in the bot. They work as a pair.
Or vice-versa. This is Smash-n-Burn's receiver.
Somebody was.
Why's that?
What is he, 16?
Outside perimeter.
Hey, guys. What do you make of this piece of bamboo? I found it on the roof.
That's funny. Very funny.
Did you get the hole in the roof?
No.
What in the hell went on here?
Yeah. Sorry, I don't let everyone in here.
Bummer.
Four guilty people out there somewhere.
Well, I have black lung from all the powder, and not a single print, nothing, nada.
Wouldn't hurt.
Nothing.
No, no. I-I'm not quitting. No. I am in too deep.
Trace. Maybe Hodges can find something.
Oh, coming through. 
Careful, people. Easy.
From tip to tip. What do you think caused these marks?
Well, that's obvious, Hodges. If you were a miracle worker, you wouldn't be rude.
No.
You ran it through the I.R.?
Camera lens.
109, finally. Height, distance, angle. This has been a very laborious shift. Are you in the mood for a light show?
Or a bamboo stick.
A bamboo cane with black swirls descending downward, no GSR, 109 rods, 109 bullets, all fired from the same gun.
Forensically? 
Yes.
Hey.
Looks like he wasn't alone.
Store owner gets flustered. He wants the kids out of his store. So, he sells them the beer, even though they're underage, and of course they drink it.
Cop shots. No rulers, no markers.
Injuries are consistent with an accident.
Abbreviated autopsy. Dr. Robbins oversaw.
Cause of death: Drowning. It jibes with the husband's account. It jibes with the detective's account. There is nothing in this file that suggests anything other than an accident.
Do you want to go to the bathroom?
Sorry. I-I-I-I'm sorry. I, uh ... your neighbors are looking. 
There used to be a towel bar there. 
Would you by any chance have the old towel bar lying around somewhere?
Uh, thanks for your time. Mmm.
You pulled the plug kinda early. What's going on?
Model home.
Like bees in a hive. Gives me the creeps.
Are you kidding? I live for this. I mean, Shelley Stark and I are the same height and weight.
Oh, butter that toast, Nick.
Okay, I'm Shelley Stark.
My bath is over, and I'm about to get out, so ...
I brace myself with my left hand, and I'm getting up at a 45-degree angle, and I slip... so, I grab the first thing that I can.
Towel bar.
Okay. So, at this point, all of my weight is being supported by this bar.
No.
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine ...
This thing is coming down.
Okay.
No.
There is no way that Shelley Stark brought down this towel bar.
Yeah, about $750,000 worth of effort.
Hey. NICK: Sara. 
I am so sorry.
On my own?
See you around.
Seventeen.
Hi, David.
Eviscerated.
It's a cheerleader.
She had to have good lungs. How come nobody heard her scream?
Died of exsanguination.
Hmm. You able to isolate the species?
Dog maybe? Teeth marks are too small for a mountain cat.
You're lying.
Can you tell how old the attacker is?
Thanks.
E-coli? Unsanitary conditions?
So whoever did this to her also has e-coli.
Smoking gun.
Soccer bunnies? What are soccer bunnies?
Sounds sexual.
Yeah, well, I'm not sure the principal's up to speed on teenagers' sexual habits.
He in class?
I bet I know why.
I understand, Mr. Darwell. Have your son's wisdom teeth come in yet?
Excuse me.
Hi, uh, Chuck, I'm with the crime lab. I'm going to ask you to show me your back teeth. Give us an odontological impression.
It's going to tell us everything we need to know.
Suspect's dinner from last night.
Can you read it for me? 
What's this look like, Greg?
Angel dust. Hallucinogen.
Brain disassociates from the body.
How many milligrams?
Yeah. Too bad everybody didn't make it.
Tell me this is raw chicken skin.
We need that report, ASAP.
Your temperature is spiking. Of course, you didn't know Mandy had e. coli when you ... ate her, did you?
Normal brain, neurons send a message ...
... synapses blink on and off. On PCP, synapses never stop firing like ...
... your entire brain is on constant DSL. 
Lieutenant Lockwood's going to arrest you. We'll assign you an advocate.
Not exactly. No match on the bite plate.
Someone getting sicker by the minute.
She have an explanation?
Nicole, do you know what e. coli is? Your friend Mandy was infected with it. We think we know how you got it. We can test your blood for PCP ...
These photographs are ... of Mandy's ribs. We believe these are your teeth marks.
It's called psychological detachment. It's a function of PCP.
Nicole, I was at Mandy's autopsy. It was not a dream.
Hey, Cyrus, next time somebody says experimenting with drugs is harmless remind me of this.
Good night.
I'm ... uh ... sorry I missed your page.
It's just, um ... you tell me to get a life and then I get one, and then you expect me to be there at a moment's notice. It's ... um ... confusing.
You know you pulled me away from a forensic anthropology seminar, right? It's required. It's part of the continuing education program.
How can I help?
Hey, Grissom?
The directionality of this drop is facing the boulevard. I think the primary crime scene is ... this way.
Blood trail.
Blood leads into the grass. Trail's obscured.
Well, vic's in his teens ... probably wasn't on the playground. My money's on the basketball court.
He was here after dark. 
Droplets and castoff. This is our primary crime scene.
Yeah. I'll, uh, order up some scent dogs ... get some uniforms.
Hey.
Cabbie didn't actually hit the kid. He was in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Yeah, I do. White mob, white kid, dark-skinned cabbie -- I don't like the math.
I'm trying.
What have you got?
Looking for a knife; uncover a gun.
Back the dogs off, please.  Dead body found twenty yards from where our vic was knifed. You think they're related?
Hey.
I thought you had a couple days off?
What's a Bridal Barbie?
On our stabbing victim's jacket.
Yeah. Too bad GSR testing can't tie the vic to a particular gun.
Grissom?
Excuse me.
Have fun.
You know, you could've waited for me.
Looks like burnt skin.
Todd Branson had GSR on his jacket. If we could get his DNA off this revolver we could tie him to this.
Yeah, but, what about sweat? There's a 17% chance of DNA recovery from the shooter's perspiration.
Yeah. New paper out of Australia. You haven't seen it?  17% chance of DNA recovery from the grip of a gun, 67% chance from a cigarette, 32% chance from the brim of a hat. Would you like a copy?
Hey.
Nice. I ran the serial number through NCIC. It's registered to a Jonathan Raurk of San Jose, California.
I went back to the park. I kept thinking there must be some physical evidence connecting the stabbing to the shooting.
Leading from the basketball court to Stewart Bradley's body. We know Todd was bleeding but there were no blood drops around the drag marks.
Assuming Todd fired the gun, how did he get ahold of it?
Or ... maybe Todd wasn't the shooter.
And since there were no burn marks on Todd's palms, evidence is suggesting someone else fired that gun.
Don't even ask. I'm not telling you.
This does have something to do with the case, right?
I get it. I'm bigger than Judy. In order to get momentum, she had to start and stop. Which could explain Stewart Bradley's postmortem dislocated shoulder.
Where does that get us?
Why would Jan Branson shoot her boyfriend?
Motive?
Okay ... okay, so ... she sends Todd home, not knowing the severity of his wound. She buries her boyfriend's body. She ditches the knife, which we still haven't found. She hides the revolver ...
I swabbed the pistol grip of the revolver. The DNA from the suspect's perspiration isn't a match to Todd's. But it is male. With eight markers in common and familial relationship.
Ms. Branson? You warned your boyfriend about your ex-husband, didn't you?
Hi.
Not much. Mrs. Dominguez checked in with her husband yesterday. Room
Anybody heard from the husband yet?
Really?
Cash advance, huh?
That's a rip-off.
Yeah, and Mrs. Dominguez had a worse night. You know, nobody's checked their suite yet. Would you care to join me?
Hello? Mr. Dominguez?
Looks like the bed wasn't slept in.
Clothes are still here.
Really?
Hey, guys? I got a knife.
Have we I.D.'d that other couple?
They're with the same mystery couple who brought up the Dominguezes. Can you make me a still of the 10:35 couple, the ones that went up and down?
Freeze it there. What's in his hand?
Do me a favor, Archie. Call Grissom.
This is our first bucket brigade together, gentlemen. Try and say that ten times fast. Bucket brigade. Bucket brigade. Bucket brigade.
Yeah.
Sure.
Bloody knife linking back to Alice Dominguez.
They were never going to let him go.
We do have an admixture of blood off the ice machine.
Hives? Whoo. Severe allergic reaction.
He was allergic to penicillin, but that's not the kind of thing you can just easily slip someone.
He wore a medic alert bracelet. Everyone hated him, and everyone knew how to kill him.
What are we looking for?
Buy me some peanuts.
That's very interesting. 
There's peanut shells under Mr. Gibbon's seat.
Let's ask Mr. Durham.
Chris Gibbons died from a severe allergic reaction. You were the only guy in the jury room who was eating peanuts. You might have killed him.
None of the other jurors mentioned anything about Chris throwing a fit.
That's substantiates Bob Durham's story that Gibbons had a reaction to peanut shells.
Well, he was sequestered. He couldn't exactly go out and get another one.
I guess it's possible. We're not finding anything in Chris Gibbon's chili. No peanuts, no shells, no skins.
That could belong to any of the jurors.
Hold up. This looks like peanut butter right here. Someone was doing more than just flicking peanut shells.
If Gibbons had that severe a reaction to peanut shells, imagine what eating peanut butter would do to him.
That's murder.
Hey, defense motioned for a mistrial. Suspicion of jury tampering.
I don't know. Lone hold out, now they get to go home?
Well, Warrick's still working on that print.
Sequestered?
What about the food, how does that work?
Chris Gibbons had chili the day he died.
Did jurors have access to these vending machines?
How do you burn out your cell phone battery when you're not allowed to use your phone?
That's true, actually. Now they make them better. Did you know that this one takes pictures? And having met your fellow jurors, I think you really captured them.
Oh, and-and when where you planning on handing that out? At Mr. Gibbons' funeral? I guess you would consider the folks at the credit company family, too.
Not that bad. $30,000 deposit two days ago.
You just made $30,000.
Greg, she told Warrick she put peanut butter in the chili.
Okay, what caused it?
Greg ran the assay test for bee venom on Chris Gibbons. IG levels were spiked.
Brass finally tracked down his allergist. Gibbons was allergic to a lot of things.
The killer, I presume.
He had an immediate reaction to a bee sting.
You know how Jervis was complaining that it was too hot. He said he opened the window.
Looks like some kind of code.
It's always reassuring to see an empty soap dispenser in a public bathroom.
So I'm thinking this is how the vic got his head smashed in.
Thank you.
Head bashed in and asphyxiated. No soap was the least of his problems.
Hey. DNA came back. Blood from the bathroom floor's a match to the vic. Blood from the bathroom mirror is not.
Hmm.  What are you doing?
You think the letters might be a message from the killer?
Six letters. What is that? That's 720 possible combinations, not all of them words, of course. 
Hmm. You, uh, missed one.
That guy has a record?
It was on his t-shirt.
Word on the floor is Adam Brenner really had your number, Craig.
More ebb than flow in your case. I guess you lost to Adam your last three tournaments in a row?
At least you're a good sport.
Hey, we got a match on the blood from the bathroom mirror.
You know, that's seven years bad luck.
I'm sorry? Coffee-housing? 
But you lost to him, too.
Adam Brenner was a meticulous note-taker. He documented every turn of every game he ever played.
None, actually, at least none with that exact combination. But here's the weird part. One the games didn't add up. 
When Adam played Craig, he had 60 points written down that I couldn't account for. And on that same page of his notebook, I noticed that something had been erased. 
So I ran it through ESDA. Adam played 'exvin.' Everything but the 'S,'
You know, I was kind of hoping you'd know. It's not in the OED.
Right, and later in that same game, Craig played an 'X.' Loxodrome. Now there's only one 'X' per game. How did he get it?
A six-letter word.
There are six letters missing from your game box. E-X-V I-N-S. You made Adam eat his word.
Did you do anything to help him after he started choking?
They were never going to let him go.
I can't believe Grissom pulled us off that serial murder case.
Yeah. Why live in a one-room flea bag when you can pool your resources and live like this.
Oh, nnn ... Not Grissom.
Thank you. 
Upstairs?
Hallelujah?
Thank you.
Well, weather's clearing.
Yep.
Oh, my goodness.
Guy goes to take a shower and DFOs. He never got to the cold water, did he?
Must've been a steam bath in here.
There, uh ... : Could be something in the tub.
There's another option.
There's nothing but young people stuff. No meds, except some aspirin. No prescriptions.
There's no sign of struggle. Any prints would have been washed away. Where does that leave us?
Floater's shirt. Took it off his bed. What does this look like to you?
Yeah, that's what I got. What's it doing on a DB's shirt?
How do you get paint on the inside of your clothes?
Performance artist? A clown maybe?
Doc, uh, why is his brain green?
How long do you think he lived after the blow?
Where else did he 'bluto'?
When was the last time you saw him?
Wh-what do you mean? He started a fight?
Yeah. Yeah, right.
Any blows exchanged? Physical contact?
Punk bitch? A kid is dead.
Dan O'Hannissey is dead.
What tipped you to the ring?
Peter Benchley's Jaws?
How come?
How did Bruce's fin get bent?
You threw a punch. Probably a sucker punch.
Now who's the punk... bitch? 
Well, I don't know much about roller coaster accidents, but in auto collisions, the victims found furthest away from the car usually weren't wearing a seat belt. That'd be my bet.
Henry James.
A screw?
'Turn of the Screw' isn't really a horror story. It's more of a mystery. Did the governess kill the little boy, or did the ghost do it?
Maybe whoever maintains the roll coaster uses a pipe wrench to tighten the nuts.
You disagree with that?
Anyone could have loosened the nuts from down here.
Check this out. Is that lubricant, maybe?
I'll swab it.
That's worse than just a wrinkle.
Sir, you need to step away. 
We need some time. This is an active investigation.
Are you the only one that uses it?
Thank you.
Hi.
Good work.
Semen? s*x on the roller coaster?
Well, um, why don't you swab a sample, and you can tell us.
Grissom.
Take a look at this.
Blood.
And, uh, then what?  A renegade roller coaster comes along sixteen hours later, and propels Nevin's body from the trunk to the blacktop?
I'll call Brass, see if he can find an eyewitness that can place the car in the parking lot at the time of Nevin's death.
Multitrack digital camera snaps photos of all the passengers. The park finally sent over their computer, so I'm scanning through the day of the accident.
Yeah. Why?
Who's the girl?
Last time stamp of the night was 12:45 A.M. Coroner placed Nevins' T.O.D at 1:00 A.M.
Oh, roller coaster wacko at 12:00.
Sir, do you recognize this young woman?
Actually, we're looking for Cleopatra.
No, thanks.
We're with the Crime Lab. We have some questions.
Lisa, you know your friend in this photograph is dead, right?
You don't seem too upset about that.
After hours at the roller coaster.
It was your first date.
Was there anyone else around?
Okay, I assume that you've identified the substance we found on the roller coaster track?
Maybe whoever messed with the tracks transferred the ointment when they loosened the wheels.
And we need to catch it.
Well, in Clark County, twelve prescriptions were filled. I cross-referenced them with the employees from the park, and I got a hit. You want a clue? Her death ended the Ptolemy dynasty's reign in ancient Egypt, hence making her the last pharaoh.
Uh, that's okay.
Who's 'we'?
And what's his name?
You know, it's illegal to use someone else's prescription medications.
You know, I'm going to catch up.
This a fingerprint analysis.  Zack, I lifted some fingerprints off your broom back at the park. Turns out, they're a match to prints that we lifted off of Jim Nevins' T-Bird and the wrench that was used to kill him.
I also talked to your school principal. You're a straight 'A' student, mathalete. Science team. You had a full ride to Stanford next year. You don't sound like the kind of kid that would mess with a roller coaster just for kicks.
What about Lisa Hunt? You tutor her, right? Did Lisa tell you that she had a date with Jim?
It seems to matter to you that she had a date with Jim.
I'm thinking, you want Lisa to see you away from the textbooks.
You tampered with the screws. If she wasn't lying, she wouldn't be on the roller coaster. No harm, no foul.
Lisa walked home. Jim walked over to his car.
You'll be thinking about it now. And for the rest of your life.
Hey.
I heard about your mummy in the closet. Very cool.
See you back at the lab.
Suzanna, if you were sexually assaulted ...
Date rape is still rape.
Hi.
Okay.
We're going to need full-body photographs. If she can't talk, the kit's going to have to do it for her.
Mrs. Kirkwood, Mr. Kirkwood, your daughter has been raped.
You don't have a choice. We have a warrant.
I'll take the girl's room.
So, how do we know we're dealing with the same suspect?
Any connections between the victims?
Crime of opportunity?
Once I pulled details, I shrank it back down to 100%. Here's the thing. Looks like the bite came from behind.
Yeah.
Same person.
Let's see if he has an oral fixation as well.
Two crime scenes, two prints-- both yours.
You always help yourself to something sweet while you work?
Bite it.
Hey, guys, we're screwed.
There was more than one guy. She was gang-raped.
Jansson's never going to roll over on his partner. They're going to do it again.
You know what I don't get? How do they get in? There's no sign of forced entry at either scene.
Links the victims.
I've made a timeline of Steve Jansson's illustrious life span. Places he's lived, the places he's been arrested-- you know, the highlights.
It's always nice when they come out worse than when they went in.
So we have nothing?
Hey, Suzanna. 
Um, why don't we go hang out until they're ready for us? We'll get a glass of water or something.
I'm really glad you decided to come today.
Sure.
Suzanna, you can do this. I know you can.
Her reaction should be enough.
Two prints and drag marks. Did you move her?
No sign of bloating.
Her neck looks been broken, her head split, but there's no coat of foam.
It means she didn't drown.
Green ... something.
You put in for the promotion, huh.
Yeah, neither have I.
Heard you had a rough morning.
I don't know.
From the blow to the head.
Does it give us a timeline?
Is there truly no place left in Las Vegas without slot machines?
And a guy's wallet. No credit card. No driver's license. 
Oh, this is too big for Sophia. It's double extra large.
Suspect?
Ouch.
We're going to need the rental log, if you don't mind.
Thanks.
Here it is. Mark Young. Checked out the Waverunner. 11:45, but he and Sophia didn't hit the water till 2:15.
Classic lake date.
Boy meets girl. Girl ends up dead.
Mr. Young, your son was last seen with a young girl. We know that he rented a waverunner. Now that young girl is in our morgue and we don't know where your son is.
We contacted Mark's manager at work. He called in sick.
All we're saying is your son had contact with the victim and now he's missing. What we'd like to do is get a warrant to search your house.
Well, that's odd. The victim had a deep, even tan. We collected low SPF oil from the locker. It's a simple transfer -- him to her.
What about the green substance in the head wound?
Algae.
Girl's out at the lake. She meets some random guy she knows nothing about and she goes off with him.
And bad things happen.
Sophia takes a header and he bails.
This algae grows everywhere.
Mm-hmm. 
And how would you know that, Greg?
Signs of s*x; no sign of blood.
Well, if he leaves the dock with Sophia, comes back alone ... somebody might notice.
Well, if you kill somebody ... you find a way. Check it out.
That's got to be a 50-foot drop.
Not for Sophia.
You're looking for anything she might've hit her head on, probably something covered with algae.
Yeah.
Hmm.
Hmm.
Tear's red. It's ragged.
That's a great theory. But we can't prove that.
I don't know. Case is over.
Hey, Nick.
What are you doing?
What did you tell him? His son died a hero?
Oh, well, who are you trying to help feel better, him or you?
You know, if the evidence doesn't support the answer, a CSI shouldn't be asking that question.
Be careful.
So I had some time to think while I was away. Enough time to figure out why I made such a stupid mistake. I-I do not have a drinking problem. I have a, uh, me problem. 
My P.E.A.P. Counselor suggested that it would be a good idea for me to talk to my supervisor and that's you, Grissom, so ... I never told you about my family. I never told anyone about my family, why would I ...
Nice to meet you, Chandra.
How was what?
Yeah, right. It was great.
Can I talk to you real quick?
Yeah.
Well, it's been interesting.
It's going to be a busy night, huh?
We'll talk later.
Yeah, yeah.
You are so late. What happened to you?
Nice to meet you.
Who are these people?
Who called in the space people?
Area 51.
Not to mention Nevada Desert is compact dirt, not sand. People usually give up before they hit three feet.
We think it's a hearing aid.
Yeah. It's out of juice.
Hmm.
David, I know where he's from.
Planet Seiko.  E.T.
Big City Costumes.
Don't get all misty on me, now.
No.
Oh, sorry. Uh, I was just looking for our alien DNA analysis.
It's very neat in here. You're very neat, Chandra.
A pink cadillac?
Oh, the Chapel of Intergalactic Love.
Does Elvis look familiar to you?
Were you in a war with Ed Thomas?
Why would you possibly take him all the way out there?
The coroner determined that Ed suffered from Marfan syndrome, similar to Abe Lincoln.
The syndrome weakened Ed's abdominal aorta. When you found him, he wasn't dead, he was unconscious. He was bleeding internally.
Bedspread's undisturbed.  Trashcan is empty and the inside is spotless. It's possible a liner's been removed.
Bleaches and deodorizers. Killer attacked the victim, then cleaned and sanitized the room.
I'd like to get a clear photo of her wounds. Can we lay her out?
She did not want to die.
Bathroom.
Working the, uh, case.
Usually in hotel rooms, we find too many prints.  Not a single one. Just wipes and swipes.
Ecklie, what's up?
And he paged me. How can I help you?
Same signature.
Ms. Krell was killed on the second floor. There was only one way into her room.
Was there semen present in Sue Stein's SAE kit?
Is that fingerprint from your crime scene?
That was then.  This is now.
Hey.
Only geeks still say 'the bomb.' But it you ask me, geeks should be revered.
Mind if I watch?
Geek.
Wow.
Was he in or out on May 12, 1999?
What about last night?
Thanks, Neil.
May we come in?
Just one more question. Do you happen to know where he was last night?
Thank you.
Brass, ... 
You guys get in your cars, drive around the block. Pick me up in five minutes.
Sandra Acheson called her husband at exactly 3:03 P.M. today. I secured a 2703-D court order for the number she was calling. It was a cell phone. I contacted the cell phone company and found out that Jesse answered his phone near tower 8, Phase West. Given the signal strength, he was within two blocks of the tower.
His wife said that she hasn't seen him in several days, so I had Homicide check registration at all the hotels within the yellow area. He is booked at the Tangiers.
So, Jesse gets coked up, he commits the crime, he drives down to the strip and he checks into the Tangiers.
Well, his wife said that she hadn't seen him in a few days.
So, he takes a break from his job, rapes and kills the vic at another hotel, and then goes back to work?
Gross.
If Acheson didn't rape Sue Stein, what is his print doing on the bedspread?
We don't think that you did rape or kill anyone. We simply want to know how your fingerprint ended up at a murder scene five years ago.
You just took off? You didn't bother to report a murder 
Actually, I have some evidence.
Mr. Michaels?
I don't have a warrant. I was following a hunch.
On the contrary. Western Airlines issues this exact type of 'wheelie' to all its flight attendants. Since Martha's wheelie wasn't in the hotel room, we thought maybe the killer took it ... as a souvenir. This particular suit case ...
... is not Martha's wheelie.
You know, they say a B.A. is worth a million dollars in extra income over a lifetime.
Music, alcohol, candles. Kid was a regular Romeo.
Sure. 
You feeling okay, David?
No trace of carbon monoxide.
Trophy condoms?
Oh. Well, my bet is Trip scored a lot.
Everyone okay?
Excuse me.
Or a college prank.
Twenty feet away from two dead kids. We got to check it out. Guess you should, uh ... start processing.
Hey, doc.
I am so hoping that you have more in your report than that.
We already ruled out carbon monoxide.
Right. It's a genetic quirk.
Hodges has the genetic quirk?
Well, all due respect to 'the nose,' I would still like to send a sample of blood to tox.
Is there anything else?
Two college kids die under mysterious circumstances. Let's treat this as a homicide till we know otherwise.
Mrs. Levine, the coroner found no evidence of assault. Did Paula ever mention Trip to you?
So do I.
Hey. How's it going?
Well, I spoke with maintenance. It is an isolated incident. There are no other reports of exploding johns. How about methane gas? Maybe there's a natural reserve under the dorm.
Yeah.
Well, there's got to be some logical explanation.
Hello.
Okay. 
Okey-dokey.
You've, uh, you've heard of trophy condoms?
I'll drive.
Why was confidentiality so important?
Him?
You are a straight-A student. We've reviewed your academic records. The distractions must've pissed you off.
Hey, I got your 911. Don't you work days?
Yeah, there were beer bottles at the scene. That's not a surprise. 
No. I've been a CSI eight years. I have never processed a C02 scene. I mean, you'd need a ton of that gas to cause serious damage.
C02 replaces oxygen on hemoglobin molecules. At 8%, those kids would've literally suffocated on a cellular level.
So what did?
Thanks.
Maybe somebody pumped the gas in through a vent.
Boys and their conquests.
Really?
Would you help me move the bed, please?
There's a fresh hole in the wall. Splinters are on the inside. Someone drilled in from the other side.
Hi, Zack. Mind if we come in?
Zack, can you explain this hole in your wall?
I think maybe we should step outside. Your room is now a crime scene.
Can anyone verify that you were in L.A.?
What happened to your finger?
And that didn't seem weird to you?
Okay. This thing ... that burned your finger, where is it now?
All right, Zack, we are not going to take you into custody, but we are going to need access to your room for the rest of the day.
Sure.  And this, uh, this nice officer ... he's gonna be your 'study buddy.'
Name a chemical compound that can burn skin and can also disappear into thin air.
And dry ice releases carbon dioxide as it sublimates.
Is that a dare?
It took thirty pounds of dry ice to reach the lethal level of saturation.
Carbon dioxide is one and half times heavier than air. You know, it's conceivable that if Trip and Paula had been sleeping in his bed, they might still be alive.
Really?
Nice, Greg. You know, if Zachary is telling the truth, and he simply burned his finger on a remnant of dry ice, who put it there?
It's moving.
So you're thinking that the killer might have put his excess dry ice in the dorm toilet.
Good theory.
I spoke with Brass.
Zack's alibi checks out. He was in L.A. all week.
Greg, maybe the dry ice wasn't purchased. I mean, we are looking at a university. Science department would probably keep the stuff on hand. Science major would have access.
Trip and Paula died from carbon dioxide gas. We already know that you have access to dry ice, and as a materials science grad student, you are familiar with the chemical properties. 
Last week, you checked out forty pounds of dry ice from the campus lab.
I also spoke to your advisor, who told me that your experiments require two pounds of dry ice, at most. 
He broke your heart. He led you on, he let you believe it was serious, and after you went all the way, you were history.
Your science was perfect; your instincts were not so good. And you miscalculated one huge factor: The s*x drive of a college jock.
No, no, no, no. Grissom, that isn't possible. I sampled every square inch of that scene, and there was only one DNA type on the bloodstains.
Twins?
Well, that's different.
What's this?
And where did you get it?
Roy Rogers, the cowboy?
And then you thought you would frame it.
I swabbed the seal for epithelials, but there were no prints on the outside of the bag.
No fingerprints. There were some photographs, mostly generals. There were a few detail shots of entrails and trash. But no lucky grabs of anybody else at the scene.
Great, so Nick could be anywhere from Green Valley to Seven Hills to Arizona.
Ether?
That's old school.
Maybe it's a random act.
No DNA or prints on the cup or in the bag.
How can we be sure it's a live feed?
I got a thumb.
... but you got a moderate stringency match for a Kelly Gordon.
Good work, Mia.
Kelly Gordon is currently in state prison serving year three of a five-year sentence for accessory to murder.
The address of her crime scene is 625 Viking Circle. That's the same place where the messenger picked up the package. It wasn't random.
A Styrofoam cup with your DNA on it was found in that house. You claimed you dropped it running for your life.
Your father took it pretty hard.
Why did he come see you last week? Did you know what he was planning to do?
Nick is still missing.
The CSI is still missing. Do you know where he is?
He's going into convulsions.  He's losing it.
What's going on?
Wait, wait. Wait, wait. Kelly Gordon, the daughter, worked with plants. Hold on. Hold on.
You guys, Nick is here.
Get the paramedics!
There's nothing suspicious on the server. Only hits are music downloads. Wait a minute. An organ transplant site. For kidneys, heart, lungs and liver.
Maybe. These are pretty detailed biochem and immunosuppressant citations. It's a little over a seventh grader's head, don't you think?
She has a serious crush on a boy named Jimmy Jones.
It's going to help us find her. Do you know a Jimmy Jones?
'Last night I didn't sleep very good. I kept thinking about the surgery.' I guess we know why she was doing transplant research.
Presence of semen.
There's children's underwear in the bedroom.
Greg, you said you wanted to help out.
This counts as field work, you know?
Dirty laundry or garbage.  You know what? You take the garbage.
No. Why?
The suspect doesn't have a computer, but she could've gone to the library or used a service.
Which will ultimately lead to the internet account holder.
Who does the account belong to?
Daniel Perez is taking oxycodone for pain, and Alicia was on diazepam.
I guess they didn't want her complaining while they were mining her body for healthy cells.
I don't know.
It wasn't for Alicia.
Did you find anything?
Looks like the lividity marks on Alicia's body.
I think I feel fat.
Suicide?
A guy loses his shirt at the tables, decides to take a permanent nap on the tracks.
How's it going? You okay?
That's a ... man in a corset.
Maybe for Scarlett O'Hara. Since when was it equal opportunity?
I guess I should feel comforted that sadistic ideas of beauty aren't restricted to women.
Go in for s*x and get stung. Pretty much every man's fear.
The corset, too. The bone fragments that Nick found at the crime scene were whalebone, which is what they used to make corsets out of. Where did you learn so much about corsets?
I'm sure the whales appreciate that. How many, if any, do you sell to men?
Oh. Uh, let's focus on your customers that don't have back problems.
Mr. Phillipe, I have a dead man with a 19-inch waist and no way to identify him. Any help at all would be appreciated.
I have a head shot.
Is he into pain, masochism?
How about cross-dressing?
How come?
I'm going to need his address.
Resembles the victim. At least from the neck up.
Subjects had to hold completely still for five minutes. Otherwise, the exposure would blur. It hurt to hold a smile.
They don't make 'em like they used to.
This corset ties from the back, which means Mr. Carson couldn't have tied the laces by himself.
He had to have help.
Ready?
I got blood drops. Heading way from Mr. Carson. Consistent with the duelist's story.
If it's on the train tracks near a decapitated body with the victim's blood on it, it's usually a crime.
Or would you prefer to wait in a cell while we match toupees?
You're right, it's much better to have his body found stripped and dumped on some train tracks.
I'm not ready to say good-bye.
Sister was feeding the baby. Where'd she get the bottle?
Mom stocks the fridge and kills herself, knowing her sister was going to show up.
David, do you mind if I render the gun safe?
One shot fired.
There isn't any.
The gun is spattered in dried blood. She wasn't holding this gun when she was shot.
So there were other guys?
Until she got pregnant.
He's in the house.
Oh, ducks. That's a new decorating choice.
Warrick and I tracked down Joey Adalian's birth certificate. Christina's named as the mother, father's unknown. 
According to literature, Project Sunflower believes that every fertilized egg or embryo is a baby from the moment it's created in a laboratory dish. Fertility clinics freeze fertilized eggs for their clients undergoing in-vitro fertilization. Often, the clinics freeze more eggs than they ultimately need.
Uh-huh. Project Sunflower promotes itself as doing God's work.
Not yet. But I do have an address for Sunflower's local chapter.
I have a question. Do the biological parents get to meet the embryo adopters?
Uh, one of your special women, Christina Adalian, was murdered. We're going to need the names of her son's biological parents.
Hey, Professor. Looking good.  You know how sometimes fact is stranger than fiction?
Brass got the court order for Joey Adalian's biological parents: A Kenli and Dan Johnson in Seven Hills. We also found Christina's will. Guess who she named as Joey's guardians.
You're right. 
Who gave up the embryo in the first place?
Let's go.
Did you get the winner's name?
And that's why you decided to give away your embryos.
According to Christina's will, you were named Joey's guardian.
If you had to guess, what's Kenli's dress size?
I found blood spatter on this blouse. Size 12.
You look like a kid who's just found the prize at the bottom of a Cracker Jacks box.
It sure is.
First two victims were white, third Hispanic, two men, one woman, one rich, two poor, one young, two old, one famous, two obscure ... 
This is the most that Archie could get off that video?
I'm getting Raymundo's cell phone records. I'm gonna see if any of his calls are a match to the numbers that Penny Garden and Izzy Delancy had in common.
Disposable phone numbers are assigned by the carrier to the phone distributors. It took a little bit of legwork, but I did find the store where the phone was sold.
Yeah.  Mannleigh Chickens.
I'll let you know.
See how it feels?
I like animals, and after the Delancy murder, I brushed up on my history. As it turns out, three years ago, Izzy Delancy had a midlife awakening and became an animal rights activist. He starred in and financed this PSA targeting Mannleigh Chickens as the epitome of everything that is wrong in the slaughter industry.
His sales dropped 60%. He launched a very expensive PR campaign to rehabilitate his image, including retrofitting a plant with cruelty-free equipment. His business never recovered. He probably hated Delancy.
Hey. Guess what.
Uh, no.
But we did catch a break on that disposable cell phone number.
No, he didn't. But according to the carrier, additional minutes were recently purchased with a credit card belonging to Ernie Dell. Brass is already on it. They're picking him up. We've got the miniature killer.
What's going on?
Okay.
Toys are all here. Needle, syringe, tubing, candle, spoon.
It looks like heroin.
Maybe she was, uh, working off the rent.
Scorpio. Ruled by Pluto. Although since it's not a planet anymore ... I'm not sure how that works.
Maybe she had a roommate.
Dead girls don't shoot up.
She was dead yesterday. 
Let's run those numbers.
Seat's been pushed all the way back.
Lose all that to drugs, you gotta be in a lot of pain.
Mm-mm.
No. Why?
Really?
Thanks.
Uh, it's freezing. Why are we having a meeting outside?
... Catherine ordered Henry to step out of his lab without putting drug evidence away.
Okay, so ... maybe there is an IA investigation.
What?
Do we have access to any of the Holstein evidence?
I'm in.
You know. I really hate deceiving people because, eventually, you get what you give.
If I have something to say to you, Catherine, I'm gonna say it in private. No offense.
Furniture.
There used to be a pillow here. Maybe ... he slept on the couch. I'm going to pull some hair 'cause you never know.
Yeah, it's going to take days to sort through these.
It's a pullout.
The ‘Miniature Killer' murdered three people over a period of roughly six months. Ernie Dell was either directly or indirectly related to all of them.
We're not sure. There's a different perspective of that same image in all of the miniatures.  We're thinking it could be some kind of signature.
You guys make models when you were kids?
These miniatures are obsessively precise, half-inch scale models of the crime scenes. They probably took weeks of focused effort to create. I don't think the killer's into team sports.
The miniatures were never released to the press. No photos, nothing. You can't copy what you can't see.
I think he was trying to protect someone -- someone he cared a lot about.
Yeah, looks like Ernie Dell was covering for someone.
Hey, you were the one who checked for next of kin after his suicide, right?
He had to be connected to somebody.
It's kind of early for court.
That's going to be a long deposition.
Home movies.
That's got to be Ernie Dell's wife.
One, two, three, four, five birthday candles in 1988 would make him around 24 now.
How about audio?
So let's process it.
45 million Americans without health coverage, and a chicken slaughterhouse provides medical benefits?
'Lionel Dell.' Unbelievable.
Which connects him to the fentanyl-dealing sexagenarian, Penny Garden. Where's young Dell now?
Lionel Dell?
I'm Sara Sidle. I'm with the Crime Lab. I was wondering if you knew this woman. 
She used to sell fentanyl.
What about this guy? He's dead, too. He was found face down in a chicken stun bath in a place your dad used to work. 
Did you know Izzy Delancy?
What was your relationship like with your father?
Let's start with ... before.
And after?
We're just talking.
You know, you keep saying that you hated your dad, but I'm not buying it. 
You go through your life alone. You're good with your hands. You have weird hobbies. You make little things. And when that gets tricky ... you call your father.
To the rest of the world, a monster, but to him ... just a little boy knocking over his birthday cake.
New start for you.
Kids? You're an only child.
We reran the footage several times to get a head count. Assuming that they're all Dell foster kids, there's 13 of them.
Yeah. Lionel only remembered the first names, and only a few of those. Getting the DHS records is going to be tough. Judges hate giving them out unless we can demonstrate a pressing need ... and even then, they're spotty. And a lot of a foster kids change their names when they age out.
Front end's intact. No damage, no paint transfer. There's no signs of an accident.
Where's the body?
High school kid with a van. We could have half the senior class in here.
Ryan is six feet. Whoever was driving must have adjusted the seat.
Hello.
I got a cell phone.
Battery's dead, so I don't know who it belongs to. But something tells me that pink is not Ryan's color.
You know, when I was in college, I had this boyfriend and I thought we were monogamous. And one night, during the post-coital panty search, he handed me a pair of underwear that wasn't mine.
He said they belonged to his sister.
I know.
Yeah.
You rang?
Megan.
What is Megan's best friend's cell phone doing in the front seat of her boyfriend's van?
You trust me?
How many bodies do you have in there?
My date got canceled.
Looks like sexual assault. Bound, pants pulled down.
Where do you want me?
Well, that makes five. The dispatch said there were six.
She picked the right night.
Hot scene! Suspect under the bed!
Hold on. Victim down! Call an ambulance!
You're safe now, okay? You're safe now. It's going to be okay.
She told me her name. When I went into the room, she thought that I was him.
It didn't make any sense.
Can you tell me your name?
Cammie, I'm Sara. Who did this to you, Cammie?
The man, what did he look like?
He-he stabbed you in the chest?
I need some help here!
No, no. No.
He used a chair to jam this door.
I'm fine.
'Love, Lewis.'
Who did this to you, Cammie?
The man. What did he look like?
Cammie said something. 'Poor wine.' Maybe it had something to do with this bottle.
'Poor wine.'
We usually show up too late to meet the victim.
How did Cammie Brookston survive until we got there?
I found her at least two hours after the attacks.
So if we'd have found her sooner, she would still be alive.
She has a child.
Any signs of sexual assault?
Any semen?
Is that everything then?
The tip of the knife.
I matched Jenn Smith's footprints with a partial Grissom lifted from that broken window.
According to Catherine's attack order, Cammie was stabbed first and then Jenn. He didn't get sloppy with Cammie; he got distracted.
Which explains Jenn's fractures. He kicked the crap out of her.
He never went back to check on Cammie.
It's an airhead piece.
What kind of kitchen stuff?
He stabbed you in the chest?
What did the knife look like?
Where were you last night, Mr. Greyburg?
The killer could have gotten the knife from a swag bag at the walk-a-thon. Either that or he could have gotten it from the house.
What's wrong with you?
Yeah. Sucks, doesn't it?
Assault with a deadly weapon?
Incise wound to the neck?
Did he say anything?
Crime scene's only a couple blocks from here. I'm going to go with the vic. I'm going to collect his clothes.
Hold up! I'm coming with you. 
My name is Sara. Just hold on. You're going to be fine.
Do you know who did this to you?
Mr. Frost, I'll be out of your way soon. I'm sure you want to get some sleep.
I just need to get your fingerprints. It's routine. I promise it won't hurt.
Get off me! Get off me!
He has a vascular birthmark, a port wine stain, on his upper chest -- that's what Cammie was trying to tell me. We can get DNA off his bloody clothes, but we have no blood or semen at the scene to compare it to. His prints are useless -- they're all calluses. They only leave smudges, like the kind we found on the broken knife. I think the b*st*rd tried to kill himself.
I am going to nail this son of a bitch, and I don't want him to think for a single second that he is going to get away with this.
Frost smelled like alcohol when they took him into the ER so they ran a tox. His BAC came back .34 -- only a chronic alcoholic can function at those levels. You know what I think? I think he polished off the wine at the scene straight from the bottle.
A block away from the bar. Guy didn't even bother to switch plates.
That's where Marlon and Becca crossed paths.
I got a gun.
It's plastic. It's a toy.
Cammie had these in her wallet. We tracked you from the birth certificate. She's a cutie. What's her name?
She kept in touch with them?
Corey ... you can't blame yourself.
Stay with me, Cammie.
I held his hand.
Just like I held hers. I lost perspective.
I think Malibu Barbie did it.
-- it would of taken weeks. Maybe even months to create with this kind of detail.
Certainly qualifies as premeditation.
They're identical.
Killer must of stuck around to match the scene.
That is a level of obsession that gives even you a run for your money.
'If Dusty Fell,' Izzy Delancy. 
I have never heard of him.
I'll download it.  I checked the perimeter; property is gated with a code. There is no sign of forced entry on the windows or the doors. Of course if a girl can get into Brad Pitt's underwear drawer and take a nap on his bed, I guess anything is possible.
Lividity suggests he hasn't been moved. He was probably sitting right here when he was killed.
Looks like blunt force trauma.
No spatter or cast off.
Which suggests a single blow ... 
Oh, great, you're here. Thanks for coming.
I have something that I have to take care of. Nick and Sofia are talking to the family, Grissom's s in the kitchen. You can process the bedrooms? Thanks. 
Hey, what's going on?
What?
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Did you call it in?
Catherine, doing it yourself is going to make anything that you get inadmissible.
Okay, all right.
Okay.
Find something?
Are you interested in motive? Sofia just spent the last two hours with the sheriff, the head of the Olympia Casino, and a couple of dozen lawyers. Apparently, Izzy Delancy owned the rights to his own songs. The Olympia was negotiating to purchase them for a medley show based on his music. Izzy never got a chance to sign the contracts. Dead rock star, nut job family, and a company hungry for the next Mamma Mia!
The son, Sven, but he's a minor, so the rights would be controlled by his mother, Dusty.
Then the rights would go to Izzy's current wife, Madeline.
I, uh ... I agree with Grissom.
Greg found the mother lode. The nanny saved all of her e-mails on her computer. She was sending private Delancy family photos to an editor at Scandal Pages magazine. Based on a sliding scale of salaciousness, Scandal Pages was depositing money into Annie's Paypal account. 
Whoa.
Where did you find this?
Exactly. But with Izzy dead, the rights go to Sven. Ostensibly you.
No. SOFIA: No.
What are those drawings on the table?
If Sven is capable of creating these kinds of 3-D renderings, he definitely could've built that miniature.
Name that Greek tragedy.
If that's the case, he probably did not commit the murder and he certainly didn't paint the miniature with his father's blood.
I hear we're out of suspects.
What do you want us to do?
This is a family theme park. I'm assuming they don't actually serve alcohol here. Must have brought their own.
Single malt, twelve years old.
How much do you think a night like this would cost?
What is she like?
Yeah.
Lots of ...  ... coins and toothpicks. They don't sweep under here.
I got a shot glass. Looks like there's some lipstick around the rim.
Hi. I'm with the Crime Lab. Sara Sidle.
I'm here to collect your clothes and trace evidence from your body.
Why would you want to?  Did the nurse forget to collect an SAE kit?
I get that a lot, too.  Law enforcement.
May I move your hair?
These look like rope marks on your neck.
I'll be done in a minute.
So far, all the prints come back to her. Player piano, whiskey bottle, shot glass. There was some lipstick around the rim. I haven't had a chance to test it. You think it's her shade?
Catherine found a pair of men's underwear in the toilet. Any evidence on them would have been washed away, but she also found seminal fluid in a tissue on the floor nearby.
She refused an SAE kit, so we'll never know. There were no defensive wounds, no skin or rope fibers under her nails. At first blush, I figured he might have ambushed her, except that I noted three separate strangulation attempts on her neck.
She had time to fight back.
This window wasn't broken yesterday. And I got a bullet in a poker player.
There were two shooters.
Lead bullet. Cannelure. We're looking for a revolver.
Case is unlocked.
I'll process the ammo boxes.
Where is the bullet?
Full metal jacket, nine millimeter. The bullet that I found at the saloon was from a revolver. Colt single-action Army.
But we know he was there.
So this client goes back to Oakley's the next night and shoots Porter.
His family owns the place. He had access.
We may have a suspect.
I get it.
Yeah? 
It's fine. Do what you need to do.
I think Malibu Barbie did it.
Assuming that they're all Dell foster kids, there's thirteen of them.
Miniature Killer?
Bleach at the scene, just like the others.
Maybe this one wasn't planned. Maybe the killer has to make the miniature after the fact, which is why it's so cold in here, to preserve the body.
The head injuries are consistent with the bloodstains on the sink and the wall behind it. It does suggest a struggle.
It's ... kind of up close and personal for this killer.
Well, that's not a good sign.
I thought this only happened in the movies.
All right. Kicked-in door, one bloody chainsaw, two dead bodies. Someone broke in, cut up the two guys, left the murder weapon and split. 
Some of the furniture looks new. Some of it's cut up, some of it's not.
You know what this reminds me of? The first time we met. San Francisco. Your lecture. Double murder in a garage. I'd heard you were a little ... dull as a speaker, but you can't rely on your first blush.
That was the, uh, subject of your talk.
Exactly.
Sure.
Maybe the other one's Lou.
Guess who owns the chainsaw.
I also found bits of wood and metal shavings on the inside of the cover plate, consistent with the furniture and appliances. The teeth on the chain are dull, probably from cutting them up.
Where do you want him?
Blue test paint is not lining up with the red known spatter.
What could throw the angle off?
You know ... 
... what if you line it up switching hands, like this?
Ray Gaynor's killer was left-handed.
So ... Lou could have killed Ray, cut off his arm ... but who killed Lou?
Well, if I attacked you, the chain would be traveling downwards when held normally by a left-or a right-handed person.
The way that this works, is if Lou was holding the saw.
The chain was dull from cutting up his wife's things. The wife told Brass that he wasn't very handy. 
Kickback.
Jessica ... this might hurt a little bit, but it's going to help us get the people who did this to you.
I'm sorry. Thank you.
Do you have any other injuries?
Could you lift your left arm for me, please?
Thank you.
Been there.
Why do you ask?
There was.
He died.
Are you volunteering?
The two scenes are related. I found two common treads on both vics: an athletic shoe and a boot. I ran them through the SoleMate database. The athletic shoe ... is a converse Chuck Taylor and the boot is a Doc Marten.
Yeah, I ran that through the SoleMate database, too. That is a Steve Madden Dynasti Stiletto. Open-toe shoe.
Most of the treads are on the sides and back of the victim's clothing.
Kicked to death.
Hey. 
Why isn't there a medic on Greg?
I didn't think you could see me.
I'm going to take that as a compliment.
I came here for you, Greg.
Hey.
Doctor found these on Demitrius James.
Special kind. They're called Halloween lenses. They're wearing costumes.
I am going to pick up some Roberto's, take it over to Greg. I'm sure he's sick of that hospital food -- anybody want to come?
You know, it kind of sounds like you guys are blaming everybody but these kids. I mean, you don't get a bye just 'cause you grew up here or your parents are on drugs. Those kids are perfectly capable of telling the difference between a wild night out and ... beating somebody to death.
Very dangerous if broken.
The door's right here -- I doubt she missed it. Maybe she had some help.
Those coupons on the floor on top of the glass suggests they were scattered after the window broke.
There's nothing particularly valuable here.
Cut's pretty deep. Let's try and keep her head on while we move her.
Hi.
The rest of the house.
Did you find something?
The killer on his way out?
Do you live here?
What's your name?
Henry, I'm going to need you to come down to the police station, give us a statement.
Um ... Sorry to tell you, but your aunt is dead.
No. No blood on the nephew's shoes or clothes.
What about Auntie Penny?
We've got a lot of serious drugs that are unaccounted for.
Got your page. Surveillance footage from the neighborhood watch guy across the street.
Yeah? 
He's slinging drugs.
So we have a drug dealer and a former drug user, both of which would have motive to steal Penny's drugs.
He's broke, he's unemployed; maybe he's stealing them from Penny so he can sell them to the neighbor.
Hi, Henry. What are you doing here?
If one was horrifying ... what is two?
I'd say that it takes the nephew and the neighbor off the hook. I doubt either one of them could afford a mini-contractor, anyway.
A bloody doll. Similar to the one in the other miniature.
Same pattern on both.
Maybe it's a signature.
Okay ... again, the miniature suggests that the killer had an intimate familiarity with the victim, home and habits. So what do they have in common?
Different friends, different family, different social circles.
This is where we found your aunt's Fentanyl, so we know that you didn't take it.
Which means you've gone from a suspect ... 
Who was Penny hiding her drugs from?
Did you know your aunt was selling her drugs?
Which one?
Can you think ... of anyone else that might have known that those drugs were there?
Well, that's not exactly a surprise -- the woman smoked liked a chimney.
Liquid nicotine is in a lot of smoking cessation products.
Kind of. I data-mined the home phone numbers of Izzy Delancy and Penny Garden. They actually had ten numbers in common. Information, couple of mail-order catalogs, power company, Moviefone. There's one other number which turned out to be an untraceable disposable cell phone – suggests someone who doesn't want to be found.
Okay. Uh, I'm out of here.
You know, in the slasher movies, when they go after the dark-haired girl, she always dies?
I think, um ... I think I am sick of having my face shoved in death every day. The murder rate has gone up every year since I've been here. It's totally out of control, and ... we're not even slowing them down.
Hey, Gil, I ... uh ... Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.
Hello. I hear your abduction case is now a serial murder.
Well ... uh ... I got called into work early, but I did pick up Hank, and I took him to the sitter.
Pleasure.
You think the suspect's still here?
Maybe he found something better ... Colt .45 auto. Case is empty.
He likes to know their names.
So the husband was here and alive while his wife was being raped and killed?
I don't know. Do you have any idea how he selects his victims?
So, basically at random.  They were spending a night on the sofa, watching a movie. It's just ... uh ... 
It's just wrong.
Oh ...
Oh, sorry.
'Zopidem'? That's good stuff.
Me, too.
Thanks.
Sweet dreams.
Oh ...
Yeah.
Okay.
What do you got? 
Blood but no body. No sign of the couple.
Lots of blood activity here.
Mrs. Jimenez?
Where have you been?
Where's your husband now?
Why don't you finish up here?
Well, the guy's under arrest.
We'll be back for her body next month. Or his. Or both. There is nothing you can do about this, Ronnie. Don't kid yourself.
Oh, that's Catherine's case. Or, you know what, talk to Nick.
Until Marlon's little sister Hannah got on the stand and confessed to the murder herself.
She's a prodigy. 
Hannah, you are smart.
What do you mean exactly?
She claimed that she did it because she loved Marlon. Some warped sense of justice ... She graduated later that summer, became legally emancipated from her parents and went off to Harvard--pre-med.
Not recently. Look, accident or no accident, Marlon killed before. Hannah sunk this case, Marlon got a free pass, and now he's killed again.
I want this case.
We're not supposed to let them get away, right?
Hello, Marlon.
Actually, she was murdered.
Kira was forced out her dorm window. Your prints were there.
Your prints were also found on a tube of sexual lubricant. 
Did she give you that fat lip?
Well, I'll tell you what. We will give you the benefit of the doubt in exchange for this.
You remember this.
Hannah, I heard you were studying back East--what are you doing here?
Excuse me.
You are not going to muddy the waters this time.
I need Marlon West's DNA. If his semen is in Kira Dellinger, it puts him at the murder.
Jim, are you going to talk to the judge or not?
Marlon West has killed before.
Did you have fun talking to Kira Dellinger's parents?
Must've been a lot of screaming and crying and despair.
My point is, if we had done our job right the first time, Marlon West would be in jail, and Kira Dellinger would still be alive. Talk to the judge.
Positive for GHB.
Did they share a drink?
Yes.
Marlon takes chemistry. Hannah teaches it.
There's one thing we have that does. We can get a warrant for this.
Hannah, what makes you think that I would believe anything that you tell me?
I'm sorry about that.
Well, we're going to keep him here as long as we possibly can.
Given your brother's history, I think it's pretty sensible.
If you want to spend more time with your brother, I recommend you invest in a good lawyer, Hannah.
That's probably not enough to put him in jail.
Hannah was there.
I'm not sure.
I'm just ... uh ... taking a closer look at Marlon's chipped tooth. Look at the orientation of the fragment in the mouth.
And now look at the way the tooth ended up in Kira's right fist.
I don't think Kira punched Marlon. I think Hannah picked up the tooth from a fight that Marlon had earlier in the evening. And I think she planted it on Kira.
That's crazy.
This kid is spinning me in circles again.
No. No, I ... um ... I need to finish this case. I'll be okay.
What is that in your hand?
It's a piece of a tooth—the one that Kira Dellinger's new boy-toy knocked out of Marlon's head.
You had already spiked Kira's lube with GHB. All you had to do was wait.
A piece of his tooth in her fist.
A little bit of leverage. And your brother's a killer again.
I am just putting you on notice. You are not fooling me anymore.
We're talking about you, Hannah.
That is none of your business. 
Stop it, Hannah.
Answer the question!
Stop playing games with me.
What are you doing here?
That just makes this worse. I-I can't talk about this right now. I can't.
What happened? Her husband attack her again?
She won't stay.
I don't know, Marlon. She's your sister.
Like how?
And that changed when you met Kira?
I believe you, Marlon. I really do. But the only thing that a jury's going to see is your prints on the lube, your prints on the windowsill, and another dead girl.
I don't know. All I know is ... you don't deserve to take the fall for this. And the question is ... are you going to let your sister get away with this and spend the rest of your life in jail?
There is one thing.
She's out of mine, too.
Hi.
I'm sorry. I've been ... uh ...
I'll be right there.
I do. I know that you killed Kira Dellinger. I just can't prove it.
Hannah, Marlon's dead.
He was doing well here, wasn't he? Making friends, joining a band, falling in love. But you're still a freak, just like high school.
His world got bigger, and yours stayed the same, and you killed Kira so you could keep him all to yourself, didn't you?
Gil ... You know I love you. I feel I've loved you forever. Lately ... 
I haven't been feeling very well. Truth be told, I'm tired.
Out in the desert, under that car that night, I realized something, and I haven't been able to shake it. Since my father died, I've spent almost my entire life with ghosts. We'd been like close friends, and out there in the desert, it occurred to me that it was time for me to bury them. I can't do that here. I'm so sorry. No matter how hard I try to fight it off, I'm left with the feeling that ... I have to go. I have no idea where I'm going, but I know I have to do this. If I don't, I'm afraid I'll self-destruct, and worse, you'll be there to see it happen. Be safe. Know that I tried very hard to stay. Know that you are my one and only. I will miss you with every beat of my heart. Our life together was the only home I've ever really had. I wouldn't trade it for anything.
I love you.
I always will.
Good-bye.
So, Judge Wilson tells me I'd have better luck with a blue suit than a gray suit. What is that? Do you think he meant that? Do you think he was flirting with me or ... ?
Yeah, right. That's cute.
Pocket contents: Credit card, car keys, lipstick and one matchbook.
There's no name, just a phone number.
I'll have Vartann run it down.
Sure.
Tell her I said, 'hey.'
Hey. Phone number on the matchbook panned out. Guy's on his way to P.D.
Chlorpromazine-- they give that to mental patients.
What?
Would sticking your eyeball in a woman's eye socket constitute a s*x offense?
But offensive ... yeah.
On the train to crazyville.
No, no, no. I left that for the doctor.
I have no idea. He's a suspect in a murder investigation. Do you think he's crazy, or ... ?
Nick ... take a look at his arm.

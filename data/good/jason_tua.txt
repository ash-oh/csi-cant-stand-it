Man, I was just lampin' in the crib with my boys when all of a sudden, psssh. I thought someone was breaking in next door. Took a look over the fence, old Penny was breaking out.
Mm-mm. I don't even think Mrs. Penny could scream. She had, like, a real low, raspy voice.
No, sir. Not last night.
Don't know his name, but I seen him always going in and out of there.
White dude. Skinny. Always wears jeans and white tees. 
Man. I liked that old lady. She made some good vittles and always had an extra stogie if I was out. 
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, I strained my pecs bench pressing.
Well, I've had my share of women. Mr. Johnson's gotten bored over the years, so?
What, you gonna bust me for selling Prevalis?
I don't drink.
So what, you think I stole them?
Where are the pops, old lady?
Where are they?
No you won't.
Never. Never, never, never. Look, I told you, I liked the lady. She made me dinner. She lent me smokes, man.
No, man. No way.  Hey, I need a lawyer in here.
So this is off the record?
So I ain't going to jail?
No, man, I'd never take those things from her. I buy 'em, 50 bucks a pop.

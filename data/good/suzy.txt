Max watched me. He's nice.
I like you. You're a giant.
Thank you.
Max is my friend. He's a lion tamer and an astronaut and a spy.
I went in. It was a big mess.
Red and green.
Max came into the kitchen in his underpants.
Oh, no. He went and got dressed.
I don't know.
He started cleaning up the big mess. I bet he didn't want to get in trouble.
He, um, he had to stand on a chair to reach it.
At first, but then he said there was sharp stuff, so I watched TV.
Hi, Max!

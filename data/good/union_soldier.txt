Ugh! Apparently, I offended him.
Honey, I'm right in the middle of Cemetery Ridge here. I care what we have for dinner. Well, check the cupboards ...
Damn it, Caleb, that was my wife I was talking to.
Oh, really?  I didn't know Gettysburg was in Nevada.
Okay. Fine. Let's do it.
I'd never reenacted a duel, so, uh, we agreed to meet on the field of honor with our pistols.
No, no, not in my gun. No, I figured we were just going to blast some powder and then go out for pancakes. Caleb wanted a little more authenticity.
Look, this isn't a recreation, you know. He really shot me. Almost nicked the bone. It's a good thing my second was there.
He's a male nurse.
He shot me 'cause I was taking a cell phone call. What do you think he was going to do if went to the cops? When that bullet hit me, I ran for my life. I jumped in my car and got the heck out of ...
Oh, we-we carpool.
Yeah.
Why?

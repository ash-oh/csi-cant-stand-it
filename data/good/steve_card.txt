Uh, no, I have the only key.
Vet tech.
Not on live animals, but once the dog dies I can harvest the organs. I sell the hearts to research labs doing heartworm studies.
It's a rescue kennel. Most the dogs who come in are problematic, aggressive. Most don't make it out.
I don't know anything about this.
I didn't kill Lizzie. She was my business partner.
It's not your ass. I'm a victim here.
Nobody cheats the D Street Killers out of 50 Gs and lives.
Not me. Lizzie.
We banked 50 Gs. I bet Gino's getting sick of losing.
Lizzie was the #1 dog fighter in all of Vegas. That drove Gino nuts 'cause he was like this close to knocking her off the top spot.
Oh, she was no Mother Theresa. But, see, she'd still be alive if she wasn't a dirty dog fighter. That rub, it made the other dog sick.
Why do you think she gave money to my rescue kennel? She didn't even like dogs, but fighting them, that was in her blood. Passed down from her daddy, who taught her the whole family business.
It's a ... it's a breeding stand. The sport has a high mortality rate, and.. uh..combative bitches won't breed without a fight. So we have to tie them down to consummate the act.
That's sick.

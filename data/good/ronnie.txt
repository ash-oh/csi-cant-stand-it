No. This place is creeping me out.
Catherine? I've got something else here.
Mine's dead, too.
Okay.
Here you go. Thanks!
Damn it.
Control, this is C-147 Lake for C13 Willows.
Hey, Catherine, I left my cell phone at the studio. I need to go back and get it.
Does that include the cost of the contract?
Damnit. I'll see you later.
Hello, Dispatch?
Hello?
Catherine, it's Ronnie. I'm stuck at Repulsion Pictures. I need backup.
Hello? 
Hello? 
Hello? 
Hello? 
Hello?
It's gonna be okay. Keep your voice down.
Shh!
Shh! Shut up!
For the love of God, stop talking.
That's good. Yeah, stop talking.
Shh-shh-shh!
Sir, I'm a CSI. Think about what you're doing.
Put down your weapon.
Yeah.
I wasn't acting.
I'll see you.
Thanks, but I like what I'm doing.
Okay, thanks.
Bye.
Hey. Sara, you done with your scene?
Great, because we just caught another one: 425 off Craig Road.
Busy shift, but you know I like that. I'll see you outside, okay?
Then someone ran out the door.
Mrs. Jimenez, are you okay?
Sara, she's got a very bad back.  Dispatch, this is CSI Lake. We need paramedics right away on location.
Sara?
Wait a minute. How are we going to handle this?
He'll be free by tomorrow. Her husband is obviously abusing her.
You can call me anytime. Just stay in touch, okay?
No. She came involuntarily. It took some convincing, but she's agreed to go to a shelter.
Maybe not. But at least now she has a chance. Look, I did it all on my own time, no OT. I know it's not the way you do things, but I think it's part of the job. At least, that's how I want it to be. For me.

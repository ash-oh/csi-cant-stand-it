Guys like Thomas Simon never get their hands dirty.
Did you find the gun?
The biggest drug supplier on the West Coast kills a public official, and we can't find him. I'm just the undersheriff. I have one job: make the sheriff look smart. You're not helping.
You ever seen a man's face change into that kind of a demon?
I don't hear a solution.
I only want to know if it works.
Fifty-fifty. I can live with those odds.
How do we get around entrapment?
Not your call.
So don't screw it up.
The DA?
That bitch won't like it.  Thanks for breakfast.
We're in the process of conducting an investigation, so I don't have all the facts. But there does appear to be some similarities to Assemblyman Zamesca's murder.
Uh, I have no further comments at this time.
I really feel good about this.
Good afternoon. 
The Las Vegas Police Department has successfully apprehended a suspect, one Edwin Dennison, who's confessed of multiple homicides, including that of Assemblyman Danilo Zamesca.
Mr. Dennison admitted to luring Mr. Zamesca to a remote location, while seeking his help to escape the drug trade. When Mr. Zamesca encouraged him to surrender to police, Mr. Dennison shot him. He later shot Mr. Holstein during a dispute over a drug deal.
I'd like to say how very proud I am of the swift and efficient work done that my department has done in tracking down and apprehending this dangerous criminal ...
All right. Which one of you screwed this up?
She's a tight-ass. I told her what I thought she needed to know.

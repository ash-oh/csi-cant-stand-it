We'd been drinking apple martinis for, like, three days straight. Shelley said the sauna would detox her you know, clean her out.
Mine. Shelley and I got in a fight over it.
Yesterday. I caught her trying it on and I said 'give it back,' and then we started fighting over it, you know, tug of war and the whole thing ripped right in two. We fell back laughing.
I'd give anything to have her back.
No, go ahead, if it'll help.
She called down from this phone. Do they tape phone calls here?
Yeah.
Okay... but it doesn't have anything on it.
Wait, are you saying Shelley didn't die in the sauna?
Like what? Shell was always healthy.
I don't understand.
I answered the phone. He asked for her.
I didn't mean to kill her. I thought that she would just have an allergic reaction and she wouldn't be able to make her date that night, you know ... like, get hives or something.
I didn't even like the guy. I just ... I didn't want to be left out.

Yo, Space! 
Yo, yo, Man!
Right on time.
Don't ask me; ask the metal detector. It's supposed to work.
No, not me.  Hey, Crystal! Hey, baby, you talk to the guy that got capped in your section tonight?
Hey, look, that gun was stolen out of my desk last week.
Come on, man, think about it. Why would I kill somebody in my own club? I still got yellow tape across the front door.
Yeah, but the guy's not around. Besides ... things change.
What? Wait-wait-wait, you don't think that I had any ... no.
I was just helping her out.
Hit man? What the hell are you talking about?
I didn't kill him and she doesn't deserve to go to jail. Look, the guy was a snake. Picking up girls, using them as mules, throwing them away.

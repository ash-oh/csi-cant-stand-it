Hi. Sorry to keep you waiting. So, what can I do to help out the Las Vegas Crime Lab?
Well, uh, I hired Croix Richards to Dominate Rebecca. Would you like a chocolate?
I guess you could say that Mr. Richards worked for me. We were hoping that he might help ease some of Rebecca's sexual difficulties.
The problem wasn't with our relationship, it was with my wife's lack of experience.
First over the internet and then we, uh, we met with him a few times.
Yeah, yes.
I participated in the sessions, yes.
Say it!
Yes. Lady Heather thought it would be best if I was involved. I'm sure secrets would've made the problem worse, at that point.
Oh, I'm sorry, who?
Oh ... I don't know who Trey Buchman is.
Oh. 
Rebecca will give you anything that you need.
Yes.
Yes.
Mmm. Shouldn't they be?
Mmm. I didn't.
Chloe had a problem controlling her emotions. She let things get personal. 
In my 'crowd'?
We'd meet occasionally, yes. Listen ... my wife had a problem with s*x.
My wife had a problem with s*x. And at Lady Heather's, I fixed her.
Yes.
Rebecca was out of control.
No, I didn't.
No, I loved my wife. I didn't tell Chloe to do anything.
She killed Richards and Buchman on her own.
I told her to stop.
I told her to stop.

See this?  Didn't get this french kissing. Joanie had a temper. Punctuated her sentences by throwing furniture. Made it hot, you know. We'd break up to make up.
Look, the whole T.R.O. business ... she'd been in and out of my house three times. Couldn't stay away.
Yesterday. I dodged a coffee pot. She hit the road.
My Thunderbird. I'd lent it to her, and used my bike. But, um, you know ... I'd like it back now.
No. Why would she go there? It's oil and water. And Joanie liked action. Real partier. Last party Donna went to was her third birthday.
No. Boring. Was always glued to her computer. Plus Joan thought Donna owed her rent and ... the house was in both their names, so ... 
Why?
Fine, I went there.
I was scared. I took off. Besides, there was a restraining order against me.
Blue, why?
Black ... did you find it?

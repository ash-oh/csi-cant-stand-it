He wasn't my boyfriend. I knew the guy two weeks. Why am I here?
My word against a cup, and the next five years, I'm being traded for cigarettes by my cellmate.
You're not reopening my case. What do you want?
So, this is about my dad?
Seeing your daughter turned into some ... hood rat's lesbian s*x slave can be rather emotional.
I don't know. What did he do?
How many did he get?
Who's Nick?
That's pretty funny -- you guys not being able to find something.
You know what I used to do before this? Back when I was alive? I used to grow things. Outside. I was studying horticulture. Flowers. My cellmate, Trish, gave me one for Valentine's Day. 
Want to smell it?  I hope your friend dies.
You the one?
What do you want me to say? I'm sorry?
That's it?
We're done.

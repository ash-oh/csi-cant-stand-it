Dan and I were desperate to have a child, and the doctor said our only hope was in-vitro.
He ... he passed away.
Thank you, Mom.
It's been almost a year. We were coming home from a movie when we were broadsided. The guy kept going and Danny never woke up.
My body kept rejecting the procedure, so we tried three times and then called it quits.
It's very expensive. Danny just was never comfortable with the notion that ... well, we just figured we weren't meant to be parents.
Yeah, I had seen a flyer at the clinic.
Dan and I pre-screened Christina, and we went to see Joey and her once a month. So that's why when I got your call, I just don't know who'd want to hurt such a sweet girl.
Yes, that was very important to Christina. She's not close with any of her family, so I've already called Child Services, and as soon the lawyer reviews the will, I'm supposed to pick him up.
You can't possibly think I had anything to do with this?
I wore the white blouse.
You never found the guy who killed my husband, and now you're wasting time looking at my dirty clothes. That's fine. Take it.
I've never fired a gun. I've never even touched a gun.
I cared about Christina.
Two days ago. I took them to lunch.
I was home all night.
My mom lives with me, but she wasn't home. That's gin rummy night.

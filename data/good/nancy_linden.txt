May I help you, gentlemen?
Oh. Nanci Linden. It's a pleasure to meet you.
What for?
Oh, he had a heart attack. He's dead.
Gigi, shush. Shh!
I'm sorry. I'm not supposed to bring her in here.
So, this was ... is Fred's desk. Nobody's touched it since they took him away. It's bad luck. Middle desk is Marty Gibson. The one on the end is Clyde Hinton.
Hey, you're that guy from the crime lab. Well, you're a little late. b*st*rd told me he had a sure-fire way to win the Cabo trip, and that he'd take me with him if I just watched his snake for a couple of days. I can't believe what an idiot I am.  Never trust a car salesman.
Well, not that.
Oh, well, now I do.
Yeah. It used to be Marty, the goodwill guy who got coffee for everybody else, but now, since Fred's dead, he's moved up a desk.
Yeah. The guy with no client list of his own, has to live off the hand-me-downs of the others.

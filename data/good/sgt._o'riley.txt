How long have we worked together?
What's up?
She came in with her son. Thought you'd like a conversation before we sat down with him.
Yeah.
Here's a wallet. 
Couple 20s inside.
Find out the last place she used her credit card.
Sorry, Elvis. Your wedding party has to leave the building.
All three of you ladies are coming in for questioning in the murder of Darren Pyne.
Sidle, I'm going to be just outside the door.
Were you having marital problems?
If I understand you correctly you went to bed. Nadine fell asleep in the easy chair. Ten hours later, you woke up, walked into the living room and she was a pile of ash.
You say you were like newlyweds?
But the two of you weren't sleeping in the same bed.
Mr. Winston ... do you know how to use a blowtorch?
Catherine?
I like the hair.
What are you doing here?
Case? The building collapsed. There's nothing criminal here.
Well, part of the basement caved in. Brought the rest down with it.
Three old women. Sisters. One minute you're watching wheel of fortune -- next thing, game over.
Catherine, it's a building.
Catherine? You sure you want to do this?
Because we care.
The mayor ran on a platform of urban renewal. Clean out the slumlords, create habitable, low-cost housing maintained by the city. If you find so much as a scratch on an aspirin in there you know who it's going to come back to.
Blonde behind the wheel. Girlfriend in the passenger seat called it in. Vehicular manslaughter.
No charges have been filed and I haven't asked a question.
First degree murder. That's how we see it.
That's some statement.
I read him his rights. Last chance for a lawyer.
Fire away.
How do you know what Adam told us?
Gil, the interrogation is over. He's requested counsel.
I pulled those rap sheets. Called around.
The one with the missing tooth is no angel. He attacked a gas man checking a meter. Took a chunk of thigh and severed a testicle.
Are you Susan Hillridge?
Your meter reader's singing soprano.
Officers, go ahead. He's all yours.
Let's go. Officer. 
She is nuts, right?
Department of Agriculture. They were searching for wild horses in their chopper when they found it. None of the boys would even go near it. I had to tape the perimeter myself.
Just follow my prints.
Excuse me. Guy over here's got something you might want to hear. Syd Goggle. He's a security guard. Community patrol. Says he saw a man speeding away from here last night.
This way.
What can you tell me about the victims?
But you didn't share the last couple hours together. Where were you?
Where are the other monks?
How come you don't leave your cell phone on?
Oh, sorry. I just left the bank. Mr. Ananda here, you're playing fast and loose with the school fund money. 
You raised just over $13,000 for the school fund, but you only deposited $12,000. You planning any more trips to Disneyland? 
Got any more of that gum, Mr. Suddahara?
Went home, got his rifle, came back to make sure he didn't talk. 
Paramedics pronounced. Coroner's on his way.
Not alone. And not his home.  Catherine Willows, Nick Stokes, crime lab. Dr. Leigh Sapien. This is her residence.
Somebody order a warrant?
Mustard and relish. Hold the onions.
Epilepsy. Eyewitness physician dials 9-1-1. Coroner's not making any noise. You're lucky to get a limited.
Which would have got you nothing. But I did a background check on the good doctor. While back, she had her license suspended. s*x with a patient. Teen's parents filed a complaint with the A.P.A.
Last time I checked, murder is.
He was 14.
Caught him red-handed. Ben Jennings.
Hey.
I was on with dispatch. Oliver Dunne's car was just found by the highway patrol abandoned at an Avcon station off 215.
Yeah. Registered to a 'Ramirez.'
'Roger Jennings -- armed robbery, breaking and entering.' You sound like the kind of guy it wouldn't be a big jump to murder.
Your first stop the AvCon gas station. See these two guys?
Suppose I told you your brother said you did these guys.
What started the beef with the victims?
He's framing you.
I got to ask you ... how does somebody bury two bodies as a favor?
You're looking at two counts of murder, special circumstances. The best you can hope for is life without parole.

Yeah, I understand.
The police said you needed me.
You killed Kira.
You look a little flushed, Marlon.  Are you feeling all right?
Kira always brought out the worst in you.
The evidence is against you, particularly given your history of violence.
Because I love you.
No. You don't. But you will. I promise, I'll visit you every week.
We're done.
You need to talk to me again?
That must be frustrating for you.
Wow. That's a really sad and desperate ploy, Sara. It's beneath you.
You're lying. No. This is a lie.
It's a lie! No ... it's a lie! It's a lie! This is a ... lie!
Stop it! Marlon ... he-he-he can't leave me all alone.

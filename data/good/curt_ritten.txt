Hey ... hey, what's going on?
I got permission to be here.
My name's Curt Ritten. Look, Tony Braun was a friend of mine, right? This is his property. He calls me about a month ago. He says 'if anything should happen to me, you start digging. You take care of what's mine at all costs.' That's what I'm doing.
Okay.
Okay.
You arresting me for digging?
Tony asked me to move his silver collection up to his ranch in Wyoming. I'm doing what I was told.
Look, I had nothing to do with the drugs. I swear to you, I haven't messed around with that stuff in a long time. I was always telling Tony, as a friend to get off of it, to walk away.
Because I built the vault for him. I'm a contractor. That's what I do.
No. We did ... we did talk about me building a basement for him once. It never got off the ground.
We were friends. I've been to his house plenty of times. I was there a couple weeks ago. We were watching the Notre Dame game together.
sour cream.
No. Why would I do that? I got no idea what you're talking about.
Bonnie ... 
Bonnie, take it easy.
Sorry, Janine.
That's the thing about murder you never think to have a backup plan. The dogs lead the Gardener right to you ...
Hey, Janine, you're lookin' good.

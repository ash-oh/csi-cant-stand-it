Excuse me. I need to speak to Tavian. I want to see Tavian.
You're a lousy father to Tramelle. And you think the whole world worships you. But the truth is, you're just a deadbeat.
Keep it.
Mm-hmm.
You're here to talk to my son Tramelle?
I was in college. He was the 'man,' Mr. Final four. I thought I'd won the lottery. Then I got pregnant, and he went in the lottery, so ... take a look around. Guess what we fight about.
He's rich, I'm not. I've accepted that. But he does have responsibilities. 
A weekend here and there doesn't make a father. Tramelle's not one of his 'boys.' He's his son. Kid comes home with an armful of presents and a broken heart every time.
No. I have a little girl.
She wasn't invited.
Tramelle's been talking about this weekend for months. She just wants to come.
What difference does one little girl make?
Just a minute, okay, sweetie?  So, instead, I took her to Sweet Creatures at the Forum Shops.
Don't fill it too much, sweetie.
That's what I was hoping for.
Don't fill it too much, sweetie.

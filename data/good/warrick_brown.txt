Hey.
Ninety-nine. You and me, dead heat. Next crime solved gets promoted to CSI-3, man.
Twenty bucks, by the end of shift, I'm the man.
Nah. It's college football season, man. I won eight of ten this weekend. Kilt 'em. Outside the Huskers and them punk-ass Irish, I'm up about four G's.
On us? I'm like tiger,, man -- I'm heavily favored
Ah ... green bay, minus seven and a half over niners. Always go with the better quarterback.
Thanks. You, too, Nick. I hope you get that trick and roll. You'll never crack that in a shift, never.
Somebody want to tell us what happened here tonight?
Oh, he's lying. That's why I took this job. I can always tell when whitey's talking out his ass. It's a gift.
Yeah, that, too. So tonight you might say I'm extra suspicious.
It's just procedure, sir. We just want to make sure the shoe on the suspect is the same shoe that kicked down your door.
What's the matter?
Talk to me.
You willing to sign a statement to that effect?
Hey, rookie. Hair fibers from the home invasion. Take a look. 
Tell me what you see.
Look at the end of the follicles.
That's pulp when the human hair is yanked out like this.
Look, you see the seeds? 
Hair only comes out in that form when it's yanked or pulled signifying a struggle.
You know what? I got to go. Tell Grissom, when he gets back I went to homicide to do a follow-up on the husband. Peace.
Damn!
Little bit, yeah.
How's it coming?
Whose blood is that?
Hell, no.
The story's changed a bit. Now he says there was a struggle. Said he stepped on his shoe while they were fighting.
At first, no but now ... hell, I don't know what to think.
Yeah.
Follow the shoe.
Well, I'll be damned. 
Tripped over a rattle, my ass.
Captain, you've got to make that call. If you don't, he'll walk.
I've got the toenail. If I can get a warrant and match the husband's shaving to his toe I can prove that the suspect's foot was inside the victim's shoe. That alone will establish it was murder.
I have a sworn statement stating he never wore the victim's shoe.
It can't be the vic's. He was wearing socks.
Not good enough?
Well, might as well roll the dice; take that ass-whooping.
I'm ID. Check the badge. I'm from Criminalistics.
I'm not getting down on my knees for anybody. You can shoot me.
I'm sorry, Judge. Captain Brass wouldn't call you for a search warrant. I got a whopper on the line with a 100-pound test.
Favre.
No problem, Judge.
What? Why?
Captain. You can't do that. Me and Nick are tied!
I hate your ass, you know that? People walk every day because of you-- every day!
Damn it, Gris. I had his ass too!
Let's go.
Yeah, I'm sorry too.  Control, p-4442 arrive. 
Good. Look, I gotta run an errand. You'll be okay on your own?
Gimme Packers.
This is Warrick. Go ahead.
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo, yeah! I'll be right there.
Gimmie Niners for five dimes.
Oh, she's cool. She's doing prints on that 407. There's an officer there. 
I'm out.
Good job, Nick.
Forget it, man. It's all you.
You be okay on your own?
I'm sorry, Judge. Captain Brass wouldn't call you for a search warrant. I got a whopper on the line with a 100 pound test.
Favre.
Woo-hoo! Yeah! I'll be right there. 
Uh, give me 'Niners for five dimes.
Oh. She's cool. She's doing prints on that 4-0-7. There's an officer there.
I left her to hook up with Grissom on that toenail case ... and then, I came back here.
It was just supposed to be an easy print job. Look, I feel bad enough, okay?
Who's that?
That's it? What about me?
I don't want any personal time. I want to help. You're the boss now. You can reinstate me.
Warrick here. 
All I got is four.
Hey, look, a girl was shot on my watch 'cause I was doing you a favor.
All right, Judge, I'll get your money but I need more time. You got to give me a day.
I'm counting cards.
Not if you do the math in your head.
I bet sports from time to time.
An officer was there.
Yes.
I told you. I went for coffee.
Do you know how many times I've been left alone at a crime scene when I was a rookie?
Yeah, why's that?
Ten Thousand. See you around, Judge.
What? What are you going to do, hold me in contempt?
Nobody owns me.
I know. I messed up. And Holly's dead. 
I'm sorry, Gil.
You got to. You know where I was?
I went to lay a bet. I didn't even think I was doing anything wrong. Never occurred to me.
I won't let you down again.

Five-three ... and one quarter.
Yeah. Why?
No.
What kind of test?
What is that?
I was over at the shooting range on Desert Way.
I go every Monday night. You can ask my sister. She goes with me.
I rent different ones there.
Sometimes.
I'm fine, I'm fine.
Ow ... 
I need to talk to you. 
You have to understand anything my sister did was to protect me.
I forgot a book I needed for homework. And I knew Barry had been there. 
I wasn't looking for him. I had to go to the bathroom.
My dad's freaking out. My sister won't come out of her room. I figure if you can get the police to make some kind of deal for her ... 
She was in a stall. I couldn't see her.
Because.
'Cause of the last time he beat me up.
She always keeps her word.
I smelled her perfume. 
I saw Barry. 
I saw the gun. 
And I smelled my sister's perfume.

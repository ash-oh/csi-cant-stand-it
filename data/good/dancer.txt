Hi.
Do you need a hand with that?
Are you a doctor?
See anything you like?
Yeah, they look familiar - 
... from the neck up. I must've given them four, five lap dances each. They made my night.
No. They weren't the ones paying for it. The other couple was.
Yeah, we were all in the VIP booth over there. 
The four of them -- they came in together. The other couple just wanted to watch. So I assumed they were friends. Good friends. 
I didn't get a good look at the other two, but they slid that money across the table ... mmm, brick this big. So, like I said, they just wanted to doggie in the window.
And they were subbing drinks left and right. 
Two vodkas, two soda waters. 
Hi. Would you like a dance?
You sure you don't want a dance? I could be your specimen. You could be my mad scientist.
I didn't get a good look at the other two.

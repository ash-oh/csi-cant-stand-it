Please let me see Demetrius. I just want to talk to him.
He's not dead, is he?
My brother wasn't a killer!
Demetrius was going to college.
He had a 3.6 GPA.
DJ had a future!
I knew him! We knew him!
You didn't run over a mob, you ran over one boy! My boy!
My sons didn't grow up with a father. Barely had a mother on account of me working all the time. They got into trouble. Mostly 'cause of where we live. Aaron here, he got into a whole lot of trouble. 
My son is not a killer. He was trying to stop that killing.
C'mon. Sit down. C'mon.
No, it's not over. We won't get justice till Demetrius --

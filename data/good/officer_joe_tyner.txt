Hi.
How you doing?
Unit five. In pursuit of the fleeing 413 heading southbound on the strip.
Get back in the car! 
Drop your keys to the ground! 
Put your hands on the wheel!
No, put your hands on the wheel!
Then he turned the weapon on himself -- one shot -- right through the forehead.
I left it in the jeep.
I never fired.
I didn't kill him. That's what I told I.A. It's what I told my superior. It's what I'm telling you.
I don't top off. I know it's against regulation, but the 14th bullet puts pressure on the spring, and the gun can jam.
It's not a story! 
And no ... I don't tell people how I carry. 
Check the other magazines.
I did not fire a single round.
I was cleared.
What is that supposed to mean? I don't have to take this crap!
Put your hands on the wheel!
No! Hands on the wheel!
That's you CSIs, always counting bullets.
You show up with your latex gloves and your little fancy metal boxes ... your little powders ... you have no idea what it's like to put your life on the line every day!

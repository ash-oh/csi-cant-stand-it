This can't be happening. Mike is dead? I don't know how I'm going to tell my kids. They love Mike.
The wedding was supposed to be in a week at the Tangiers.
No sweets after ten. What's the rule?
Have an apple.
He's growing like a weed.
He was a photographer. He did weddings, events. We argued over who'd do our wedding because he didn't trust anyone else's work.
How many times have I said you have to knock? You can't just barge in this house.
No.
They're in the den.
What kind of evidence?
That the man I was going to marry somehow sexually ... no, I don't believe that.
Tell her Mike would never do anything to hurt you.
He truly was like a father to both kids.
Jody? Honey?
What is that ... what did you find?
Was my fianc√© involved in any way?
No. I just got cold feet.
Look, when Russ and I got married 20 years ago you couldn't find two happier people and now we can barely stand to be civil. I didn't want to make another mistake.
Mike would not do what he's being accused of. Believe me.
Yes.
A boat? No.
He wanted to borrow my ex-husband's boat but he was too proud to ask.
He bought one after our divorce. I've never been on it.
You know what the judge said: Two weeks with dad, two with me.
Why don't you wait over there, sweetie.
It's okay. You were looking out for mine.

Here are the files on Zoe Kessler that you asked for in the warrant along with a list of everyone who was here on November 12th.
Yeah. The nighttime staff's pretty minimal. I was supervising that night.
Chronic insomnia. She came in for an overnight sleep study but left early.
No. Some people just get freaked out spending a night in a strange place. Happens all the time.
As you can see, we try to make the facility as normal as possible.
But that would defeat the purpose. We can't have anything in there that would reveal the actual time.
Our monitoring process is twofold.
Electrodes measure EKG and REM sleep, and we have a vid cam in the room to help insure the patients actually stay in bed.
Sleepwalking. After the meds are distributed, we ask that the patients assume a sleep-ready position. Many people assume they have insomnia simply because they don't get in bed.
It's intensive. There's a written application, a personal interview, physical exam. We only take people in the normal range. You'd be surprised how many people just want a pharmaceutical lullaby these days.
She's clearly disturbed. She just lost her daughter, and I was one of the last people to see Zoe Kessler alive. I'm sure she was just looking for a connection.
I live pretty simply. I don't have anything worth taking. But I appreciate your concern.
Eighteen ... 18 years.
I like the solitude and, uh, space for my plants. 
Did I do something wrong, Captain?

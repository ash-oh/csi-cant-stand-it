My name is Frank Damon ... and I'm awaiting trial for the murder of ... my wife and son.
I didn't kill my family ... but my lawyer says the evidence is against me.
I was a good father. I loved him. I would have given my life for Toby and Jeannie. They were my world. Mr. Grissom, you are my last hope. Please ... help me.
So, you're the Grissom they wrote about in the newspaper? I thought you'd be older.
Arson specialist gave me your name. Well, six of them, actually. They all turned my case down. Will you help me?
It wasn't too complicated for the guy who put me in here. 
You think if you stare at me long enough, you can tell if I'm innocent?
Paper-pusher for the phone company.
It was about midnight.
Okay, baby.
My wife, Jeannie -- she was hungry. She had a food craving.
She sent me out to the store to get her some ice cream.
My son, Toby, he was in the bed with us.
He couldn't sleep. I was going to take him camping the next day.
Toby was eight.
I got back from the store in under 20 minutes.
I saw smoke coming out of the back of the house. I could hear the alarm.
Jeannie!
The house was filled with smoke.
Jeannie!
I checked the door for heat. I knew not to open it.
Flashover.
That's right. When the fire reaches about 932 degrees Fahrenheit you add oxygen and the smoke will burst into flame. I know how fire behaves, Mr. Grissom, because I'm a volunteer fireman. I was hoping to make the department this Spring. So I couldn't open the door. I ran outside to my car to call a rig.
Yes.
That's right, and I don't know how it got there. We didn't keep anything like that in the house.
I didn't burn down my house, Mr. Grissom. I bought the gasoline for the lawnmower and kept it in the garage. Now, if there was gasoline in our closet someone else put it there. Find them.
I need someone to believe me -- to figure this out.
I don't remember.
You're not going to help me?
That's my sister. She's the only one who stood by me in all this.
What, about my sister?
I ... told you everything.
Please ... I don't want anyone to know.
I'm a firefighter. And when my wife and my son needed me ... I forgot everything.
I didn't check for heat.
Jeannie!
I didn't look for smoke.
All I could think about was getting them out. So I opened the door. I let a monster out.
I could just about make them out through the flame.
Jeannie! Jeannie!
But I... I couldn't get to them!
I had to close the door. The whole house would've gone up and the firemen would have never reached them.  I killed my family.
It doesn't matter what I know. My family died because I wasn't there to protect them.
You tell me.
Look, I told you ... I don't know why it was there.
I can't!
Then I guess I'm a dead man.
I didn't leave that night to buy ice cream. I was leaving Jeannie.
I warned you. 
You can have the damn stuff! I told you this was the last time.
I'm leaving. I'm leaving. I'm leaving. You can be broke by yourself!
What the hell are you doing?
So I just got the hell out of there. Drove for about twenty minutes and then thought, how could I end ten years of our life like that? I mean, we had a son, so I turned around.
Man, I just ducked and covered. I don't remember.
Uh ... a-a phone. A-a bag. Uh, a vase maybe?
A flower vase? I don't remember any flowers.
Look, I don't know. I can't remember.
Yes. It was glass. It was a glass lamp, because it had a wick.
What the hell are you doing?
I'm leaving!
Yeah. She bought a lamp like that.
Can you prove it? In court?
... I'm okay.
Would you have helped me if I told you that my wife and I fought that night that I was leaving her for another woman? For Rachel?
It's funny. When I got out, I thought I'd feel ...  ... free.
I feel ...

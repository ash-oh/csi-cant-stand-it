Hello?
Holly Gribbs. 
Nice office.
For what? 
Why?
I-I haven't even clocked in yet.
I just got out of the academy -- I already know this.
Mmm...
Um ... I'm kind of light-headed.
No offense, but I don't think I want to eat anything that's been in this office.
Is there a grasshopper in here?
Yes, sir. 
Sir, with all due respect I thought the key to being a lucid crime scene investigator was to reserve judgment until the evidence vindicates or eliminates assumption. 
You're prejudging me. I graduated with honors in criminal justice at UNLV.
That's not fair.
Fine.
Yes, sir, but I'll be okay. To tell you the truth, he looks fake.
I'm sorry, sir. I can't take the smell. Oh, god, restroom?
Help! Help me!
There were bodies. I could feel them breathing. Oh, god!
You're trying to cheer me up, aren't you?
Pretty good.
Okay.
Ma'am, I told you, if you let them in it will contaminate the scene.
This is Holly Gribbs requesting backup at Junk's on West Owens, over.
Uh, we're getting there.
Yes, ma'am.
Yeah. Hi, I'm Holly Gribbs.
You can do that?
Look, um, I got to be honest. This isn't me. I was pushed into it by my mom. She's a Lieutenant in Traffic. She's never going to get out of traffic so, um, I'm fulfilling her dreams, not mine.
So you think I should stick with it?
Sorry you gotta baby-sit.
photographs. Be thorough. Don't worry. I got the same speech from Mr. Grissom.
You kidding? I'm fired up, ready to go.  Besides, there's an officer here.
Hi. Uh... can I help you?
Yeah, we had a robbery, but everything's fine.
Holly Gribbs.
Well, that's not fair.
I'm fulfilling her dreams, not mine.
Are you kidding? I'm fired up, ready to go. Besides, there's an officer here.
Hey, it's okay. I'm not a cop. I just ... I just analyze the scene.
It's okay, I'm not a cop. I just ... I just analyze the scene.
Hey, hey, it's okay. I'm not a cop. I just ... I just analyze the scene. This is my first day. Believe me, I'm-I'm no threat. 
Um, look ... phone with your prints on it? Here, take it. Okay? Here.

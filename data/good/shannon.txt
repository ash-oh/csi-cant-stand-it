Okay. I'll see what I can do.
I'm still shaking.
Do me a favor: Go back to coach. Make sure no one comes forward. Thanks.
Hey!
So, we were about 35 minutes out ... when he started pressing his call button over and over. He was complaining of a headache.
Yeah, I gave him a packet of aspirin and he popped it dry, no water.
No.
Look, I've been flying for ten years. You know, I have seen it all. I've seen ferrets in suitcases, uh, fellatio in first class ... passengers stir-frying on their tray tables. I mean ... who knows why anyone does anything?
Thank you.
Everyone needs to return to their seats.
By the time I thought to grab the defibrillator he was already dead.
Yes, but I'm trained to use them when a man is having cardiac arrest in his seat, not flopping around in the aisle.
Look, I'm going to be honest with you. I was scared. I mean ... I thought this guy was going to take us all down.
All right, everyone needs to return to their seats.
That would be Mr. Cash. Um, he was in his seat.
Take your seat!

No, that's Mrs. Delancy.  I'm Annie, the nanny.
To look for blood, right?
No, Mrs. D never holds the baby.
I should warn you, I'm a little freaked. When I get nervous or scared or whatever I have this problem where I talk a lot. I've had it since I was little. I just keep talking ...
Tuesday is Chinese. Izzy insists ... on having ... a really strict eating schedule. I have to start cooking by 4:00 and when I went into the kitchen ...
Baby's don't eat bok choy. Yeah, wonder what you're going to have for --
I immediately called 911. Speaking of which, can I get a copy of the police report?
Right after it all went down, the baby spit up on it and I put it in the laundry.
It happens all the time.  Nobody minds.
I clean for extra cash. I know the house better than anyone. I knew where the safe was. I just didn't have a key, until ...
The ER doctor said it would pass in a couple of days. They gave us a copy of the x-ray to keep on file with the general physician. It had the perfect outline of the key.  So, I took the x-ray to a key shop, told them my kid swallowed it.
But I put everything back. 
Look, a few years ago, Izzy went on this big health kick -- vegetarian, blah, blah. He claimed that all those chicken heads that he bit on stage were fake. When I found them, I was just so excited. Do you know how much Scandal Pages pays for an urban legend story? A lot.
It took 911 a while to come. I just got a quick pic. You said it-- I'm resourceful, not a murderer. I didn't do it.

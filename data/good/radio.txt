Welcome back to the voice of Las Vegas, KWMS Radio. 
The city remains in mourning, as we try to make sense of the murder of Assemblyman Danilo Zamesca. 
After his only son was gunned down by a drug dealer, Zamesca dedicated his life to public service. 
He set his sights on the drug traffickers and the drug suppliers. 
He believed you get drugs off the streets by putting the suppliers out of business. 
That was his mission. 
His murder's rocked headlines, --
-- uniting Democrats and Republicans alike, all of us asking the same question:
What happened out there?
Peg from Sunrise Manor, you're on.
Roger from MacDonald Ranch.
Okay, Roger, thank you for calling.

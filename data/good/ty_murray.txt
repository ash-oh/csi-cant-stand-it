Did you see anything?
Ty Murray, PBR president.
Okay, Dustin.
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
Cody Latshaw, a real institution. Most guys his age hung up their rope a long time ago.
Wintwister -- he threw Cody earlier tonight, but he got up and was fine. He even asked for a re-ride.
Well, if a bull doesn't buck good enough, they can ask to get on another one. That wasn't the case. Wintwister had a good day. Cody must not have been in his right mind to think he'd get a second shot.
That's one of them. That's the bull rope.
Yeah, it helps the rope stick to the glove so they can get a good grip.
Yes, sir.

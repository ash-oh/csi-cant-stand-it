So what if I was the last person to play Adam?
What are you thinking, that with Adam out of the tournament, I could abscond with the big cash prize?
Oh, first prize here is $2,000. 
Even if I win, the remuneration barely covers my airfare, accommodation and food. No, no, I don't play for the money.
You ever attempt a New York Times crossword, Captain? Nah, you probably wouldn't make it past Tuesday. I do Sunday ... in pen.
Look, just 'cause I was there doesn't mean I killed Adam Brenner.
Yeah, I'm not very proud of that.
I'm ebullient, you know. I-I feel the wins and the losses. The other night, I lost to a division two blue-hair. But it's not my fault. She was... she was coffee-housing the whole time.
You know, yap, yap, p-p-yapping.
Zip it, lady. I'm trying to make a play here.
I never should have lost that one.
What, are you an idiot? What, are you stupid? You're so stupid!
No, he wasn't there.
Adam? No way. He's ranked, what, 1,890? It's like getting art lessons from Picasso. I was honored to even be sitting at the same table with him.

I got a 20 on Simon, right here.
Nine-millimeter.
Where you headed?
Go on up.
This is Ryan Lansco's assigned parking spot. His drives a blue '72 Ford van. It's missing.
Doesn't look like transmission fluid.
No. I didn't even have a car.
Captain?
Neighbor gave this guy up. Mullins hangs out at a bar right down the street.
Stokes, you ready for a cup of coffee?
Your call.
You all right, man? You all right?
Been there twice. Still nobody home.
Sorry, son. This is a crime scene. You don't want to be in there.
Calm ... calm down.
Grissom. All these guys know Dorsey. This is where he lives.
Richard Dorsey! Time to wake up. You're under arrest.
Meth head. No weapons. He's clean. All right, let's go.

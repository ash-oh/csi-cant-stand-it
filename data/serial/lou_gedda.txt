Candy's mother's phone number. 
Candy wrote it down for me last night just before she died. That's why she came back to the club after her shift. Her mother was pressuring her to quit. Candy wanted me to call her, give her the talk. It's exotic dancing, not stripping. Show business.
I don't get involved in family business, but I thought it might help your investigation.
How should I know? I'm just trying to be a good citizen.
Good work.
Yeah, come on in.
Who let you two up here? Just so I know who to fire.
Oh, yeah, those seem to work everywhere.  Got to get me one. Ahh ... !
I know why you're here. And I don't know what to say. I can't control these girls. They want to leave with customers and do whatever it is they do, I can't prevent that.
Believe me, I don't like whores. I like dancers. When I find out they're whores, I kick them curbside.
B.B. Yeah, works at my auto detailing. But I tell ya, he's in here more, getting drunk and checking out the breast-est-es.
Oh. Well ... unless you invite me to the funeral, what's this got to do with me?
Now, see, that makes more sense.
Last week.
A couple years at most. I still don't understand what this has to do with me.
Go again?
So what?
Do you know how much this club made last year? 30 mill. You think I'm still messing around with trash? And that's the end of this. You want to continue asking me questions, you're going to have to do it with my dream team present.
Hey, how are you! Get over here! Come on!
I hear you don't want to pay what you owe us.
No.
Let's take a walk.
I'm gonna give you a minute so you can figure out what you want to do. I'm cutting something. But I'm gonna give you the choice of what it's gonna be.
Oh, yeah, yeah. I can slice you here ... 
Come on, no, no, no. Shh, shh, shh. Shh, shh, shh. Come on, you choose. 
You got a warrant?
I own this block. Unless you're lookin' to get a detail job, you're trespassing.
I burn meat.

Hey, I'm just the messenger.
He won't sign it. It's not the first time. Sorry.
Hey, I'm just the messenger.
Who issued the warrant?
Good Judge. Always count on him for paper.
Is that a crime?
Stuart Gardner. G-A-R-D-N-E-R.
Once a cop, always a cop. You and I are brothers.
I have a warrant to search these premises.
I'm not here to arrest you.
Weren't you close to retirement? After you shot that bystander?
So how'd you get promoted to Captain after that?
You agreed to drive a desk ... at CSI ... with all the sleazy civilians.
Lots of guys get off on slam-dunk cases.
Let me ask you something. Doesn't it piss you off to put all your hard work in the hands of twelve people too stupid to get off jury duty?

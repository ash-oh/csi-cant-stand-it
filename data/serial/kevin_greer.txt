Las Vegas's finest. Nice job. Impressive turnout. Have a look around. I'll be here at the station waiting for you.
Gil, Jim.
Yeah, my rule was: If you made it to my house, you deserved to meet me. I mean, how much time did you guys spend picturing the size of my hands? Huh.  Not very big. You don't need big hands, though, not the way I do it. Just ... just a little at a time.
God-like? No. But there must be something angelic in the way I look, because even on their last breath, they didn't think I'd actually do it.
Stupid lasik. It's what got me caught.
When that Debby bitch busted my glasses ... 
I decided they were a liability. But the procedure didn't take.

I don't want to talk about him.
I'm not into boys.
Kid was in my freezer.
You had to bring her up. You know, I tried to talk him out of it, but, uh, J.M wouldn't ...

I created him.
He got caught. That's the price you pay for incompetence.
That's what you deserve when you make a mistake.
There's a lot of fight in her.
I'll take you to her.  Oh, we'll need a full tank of gas.
Hey, uh, can I go to the bathroom before we go?

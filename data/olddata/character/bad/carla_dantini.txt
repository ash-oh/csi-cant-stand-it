I don't know what happened. One minute Sandy was laughing, holding my hand, and the next ... the next, sh ... oh, my god.
Sandy! CARLA DANTINI: Sandy, where are you?
... but I couldn't find her. By the time I got the operators to stop the ride ... she was dead.
Sandy!
Can you help me? I need to find out when my daughter's going to be released.
Sandy Dantini.
Um... did you find out what happened at the carnival to my baby?
I ... thought it was an accident. You read all the time about how dangerous amusement parks can be. You think it can never happen to you. You think you can protect your kids.
I-I-I don't know. I mean, well, you know, it all happened so fast. I was ... focused on finding Sandy. Do you ... do you think someone else was there?
You have news about Sandy?
Why?
Yes.
Yes. I went into the water after my daughter.
Yes.
Well ... it was yesterday. Of course they're dry.
Like I told her, reaching for my daughter.
My baby!
I want you to leave.
I'm going to need a new lawyer.

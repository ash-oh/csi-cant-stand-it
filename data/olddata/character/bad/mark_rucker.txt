I didn't do anything. Why would I need a lawyer?
Do I have to answer that?
Yeah, yeah, I was with him. And, like he told you, we didn't know he hit the guy.
Well, it was around midnight ... 
... and we were listening to the radio. I changed the station. Adam got pissed.
It's not a classic. It's crap. It's always been crap. Now, this ... this is tight.
Wh-what was that?
We just kept driving. It's the truth.
What are you talking about?
So who cares about lice?
We got to call the paramedics.
But I didn't want to leave him like that. Adam talked me into it. He had a scholarship to duke next year, you know. He couldn't risk it.
I want a lawyer.

Can I help you?
Yeah, it's all over the news. I already talked to him.
Not following.
I work here.
No.
What are you doing?
Just wanted to stick it to him. Give him a few problems.
Yeah. I smoke one joint on the weekend... my time. Now I got a jacket as a junkie. Can't get a job driving a bus to save my life.
Even if a tire blows the suspension system should keep the bus on the road. I been driving buses for ten years. I've never seen a flat take out a bus.
I didn't mean to hurt anyone, okay?

Straight up, am I going to die?
I must've had 100 tests. How'd you doctors miss this?
You don't look like a doctor.
A sample?
You mean open me up again?
I'm sorry, young man but this is my kidney now.  I waited four years. I can't have anyone cut into me for it. I just can't.
It broke while I was down in surgery--stuck on 11:00. Think the Lord's trying to tell me something?
Did you find out who poisoned Mr. Fairmont?
What if I could tell you? My body's rejecting the organ. Doctor says it's got nothing to do with poison. It's antibodies.
I told you this watch stopped while I was down in surgery? It's funny ... it's like it knew all along the kidney wasn't going to take. Anyway... there's one last good thing I can do before I leave this earth. So ... how do we do this?

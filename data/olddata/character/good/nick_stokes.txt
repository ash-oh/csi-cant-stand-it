One more, baby, one more.
There he is. What's up?
Yeah, yeah, choice of shift, $8,000 raise, extra week vacation--  oh-ho, it's all about Cabo, bro.
Is there anything you won't bet on?
Hmm, what's the line on us?
Come on, give me a winner for tomorrow.
Uh-huh. Cool. 
Hey, good luck tonight, man.
Yeah, well, we'll see, and I hope the pack wins by seven.
What's up, fellas? We got a call about a trick roll.
Hey.
Mr. Laferty?
I'm Nick Stokes, with criminalistics. You mind if I ask you a few questions?
Did you two have a nightcap? You think she could've slipped you something?
Nick. You can call me nick.
We've been seeing more and more of these the past 48 hours. Let's take a look. Open your eyes wide for me. Sunny side up.
Now say ah.
Was she hot?
Attaboy. 
Mr. Laferty, your eyes look okay but I notice some discoloration around the inside of your lips. Have you always had that?
I'll swab your gums see if we can find out what made you pass out.
Well, you're the chemist. I just need to know what knocked the old man out.
a**l swabs?
Ouch.
Dude, you get NFL-2K for Dreamcast?
Randy Moss.
It didn't take, did it?
All right. Thanks, brother. 
Hi. Nick Stokes, criminalistics. Mind if I take a look?
Say ahhh...
You know, ahhh ...  ... ah ... ?
No discoloration.  I don't see anything criminal here. 
Take her to the hospital have her checked out.
Hey, Dr. Leever!
I got your page.
A ton of 'em. Why?
Whoa. whoa. Skin discoloration?
Where? Their lips?
We meet again ... may I see your discoloration?
You wanna do time? 
You know, I just came from a trick roll downtown. The victim's mouth had similar blotching. Chances are, whatever he ingested orally you absorbed through your nipples knocking you both out. So I'll give you a choice. You give back the old man his belongings, you tell me what you girls are using and I won't have you charged with attempted murder. 
Which is it?
Eyedrops?
Room service.
Yeah, yeah, your wallet, your cash, credit cards ... 
... wedding ring ... 
Okay, next time you wanna take a shot go to the dice table. At least if you crap out, you can go home broke instead of busted, you know what I mean?
Whoo!
Thanks. Uh, hey, Warrick, listen I heard about the whole thing with the shoe and ...
Thanks.
Woo! 
Warrick, man, what happened?
Who's going to run the unit?
Yes, sir.
You got it.
Somebody came after this guy with something pretty sharp.
Broken glass.
Hey! 
Defensive wounds.
What do you think, boss?
What? You want me to play it blind?
Okay. Well, according to the girlfriend's statement they were on the balcony when they had a lovers' quarrel.
... room service.
Well, she's right. The only entry I see here is when hotel security checked them in.
Well, if he didn't fall from his own balcony where else could it have happened?
Yeah? How do you know all this crap?
We know. Hey, what did you drink? Gin and tonic or amaretto sours?
We got a record of the victim's room charges. Chief.
The first hour, you both drank tit for tat but by hour two, Ted started ordering doubles ... and you quit drinking.
Will the real Red Skelton please ... stand up?
Hey, Nick at Nite. You should check it out. 
No dust. Great.
Yeah. You think he was dragged?
Well, I'll go back to the Presidential Suite ... take a swatch of the carpet, see if we can match the fibers.
Why, is she a suspect?
It's Nick. I just finished the carpet swatch comparisons. Got a match.
Yeah, so am I.
Okay. Bye. 
Yeah, I'm into it.
Can I ask you a question?
How are you so cool? You took someone's life. Don't you care?

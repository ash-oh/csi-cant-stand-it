That body should be up in a few minutes, Mr. Grissom.
Catherine?
There's someone waiting for you in reception.
Where's the rest of the body?
Human fat. Well ... I can tell you that the malleolus -- the ankle bone -- is completely hollowed out.
Bone marrow was reduced to ash.
Which means that the foot was burned off the body, not severed. That's consistent with your theory of spontaneous combustion.
Word gets around.
No, that's why I wore a clean coat. I'm just reporting my observations. If the foot had been severed, the marrow would still be intact.
Not yet. I want to send a scraping down to toxicology.
Excuse me. 
I want to check for any flammable compounds in the blood. Don't expect much.
The quality of the sample may have been compromised by the heat.
Yes, sir.
Erin McCarty, 20.
Cop said she's single -- she lives at home with her mother.
About six weeks.
Well, here's the reason the skin was funny.
Close. Biotone arterial. Promotes high diffusion and fast drainage in skin tissue.
Yeah. Yeah, I already ran her prints through work here. Got an I.D. right here.
I, uh, I just want to say I-I ... well, I really admire the gusto with which you approach your job.
Uh ...
Uh ... Grissom, Dr. Robbins wants to see you. Something about your skeleton.
If there's something under all this blood you'll be the first to know.
Stand-up guy.
Can you imagine getting that phone call? What a shame.
Checking liver temperature. Estimating time of death.
88.6 -- ten degrees below normal.
Well, he's not in rigor. TSD is under six hours. I'll move him as soon as you're finished.
None.
Excuse me, sir? I'm sorry to interrupt.
You're all clear for tonight.
My dad's a Colonel out at Nellis. Grissom's requested a meeting.
Mine are lined up right over there.
Stokes.
No sweat.
I like to put that off till the last possible moment with decomps. 
Silver, whole.  I've done a few of these. 
It looks like a pin. It's a medical implant. 
Oh, and that's a plate in the skull. The head's been rolled.
Yeah, and by the sound of things he's been dead about two months. 
You weren't here when ESD brought this in. 
Let's go to the V.I.P. room ... I'll show you what I mean. 
Remember, breathe through your mouth.
Metal plate.
... and...
Pile of bones and that's it.
Add some bacteria, a couple gases, and... voila!
I'll cremate this.
A decomp this bad can stink up the entire building ... forever. The sooner we dispose of this, the better.
Yep, she's next.
I hate it when you CSI guys get territorial.
Yes, sir. 
Nice to see you, Catherine. Well, I smell the body. Where is he?
I know you better than that.
I made a wrong turn back at the fork.
Hey.
Suburbs are encroaching on the hinterlands. We'll know more after the autopsy.
Didn't have to do much of a Y. Attack did it for me.
Bled out. Trauma to her internal organs. Spleen, liver, heart they all sustained multiple mastications.
They're human.
You can see the bridgework on this impression of a premolar and an adjoining molar.
Well, I can't give you the exact age but wisdom teeth erupt between 15 and 30. And there's no evidence of a wisdom molar on this impression.
Oh, one more thing. I found an infection in the mucus overlying the large intestine. This girl suffered from the e-coli bacteria.
Or a bad burger.
Oh, yeah. Spiked temp, vomiting, lower GI problems, the works.

That's Dennis Fram's locker. 
Look, I'm the school counselor I don't know every move these kids make.
Dennis is slight and Barry always picks on him for it.
Of course, but he would never hurt Barry. He's a good kid. He's totally nonviolent.
We can call him from my office.
Dennis ...
You know what? Dennis has explained to you about the gunpowder. And I am sure his sister will vouch for his whereabouts. And he's a minor.
Have you talked to Barry's parents?
The older kids get the less they talk to their parents.
Look, he was very popular and he was a bully. So there was probably a dozen kids who wanted to see him dead.
I can protect them from being called a derogatory word for homosexual or the n-word. Everything else falls under free speech.
I am.
You have no idea what these kids go through. I listen to them every day. Divorce, working parents ... cliques. And all they need is just one person to believe in them.
That's your job.
Well, I don't know how to clean a gun. That was my husband's.
Do you know how many kids go to school and kill just to get relief from the bullying? You talked to them. Boxing lessons and target practice. How long before one of them came in here and opened fire on a hallway full of kids, huh? I just thought that one life was better than 20 ... or 30.
I watched them die at my feet. Just because some sophomore couldn't take the jokes about his glasses.
I did this for my kids.

Move on.

Ma'am ... put your hands behind your back, please.
Hey, O'Riley, Grissom wants to see you.
Come on.
That's a beautiful car, that SC-430. Don't get to see a nice car like that in these parts too often. So when I see one twice in two days, I notice. Especially when the driver's exceeding the speed limit.
Gun! OFFICER: Get down! Get down!
Put him down. OFFICER: Cuff him. OFFICER: Get him secured.
Burgundy sedan. Caucasian female. Age 32. Traveling with a caucasian male indeterminate age.
Panhandle to the Keys. Yes, sir.

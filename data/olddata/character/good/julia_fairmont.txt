My husband's in surgery. Can't this wait?
He usually goes with women who look a lot like me ... only younger. And I'm embarrassed to say that I've been flattered by that, at times.
I was very much on the outside of that part of his life.
He was.
He was technically ... dead. He wanted to donate his organs. I was following his wishes. Why are you being so hostile?
What?
Garlicky?
Uh... no.
Um ... we didn't see each other a lot. Bob was busy building his company.
I think it would bother any woman.
I did not poison my husband.
He wanted to be cremated. I cremated him. He wanted to donate his organs. I did that, too. Now, if there's nothing else, I will be at home preparing for my husband's memorial service. Excuse me.
Of what?
I thought you couldn't tell.
Well, good. Yes, I would like to be notified.
Yes, I shot him. He was supposed to go riding with me and he didn't show up till two in the morning. No calls, nothing. I was ... hurt.
I just wanted to scare him.
I don't really feel right about doing this.
Aren't you going to arrest her?
Other than poison Bob.
You? I ran his home. I entertained his clients.
You covered for his mistresses ...
I was trying to ... rekindle our marriage. I ... got the room ... brought the champagne.
He squeezed me in between business meetings at the hotel.
No, because you asked me about him being redressed in an elevator ... and, besides, when I left him, he was ... alive watching the news.
I'm not a doctor. I don't know when he had it.
I didn't think poison caused strokes.
I know a lot of things about a lot of things, but that doesn't mean that I killed my husband.
Yeah, I'm, I'm ...
Hey ... maybe I just need to sit down... for a minute.
I had his watch and ring removed, too. Do you want to see them? They're in a box at home.
It can look however it wants. I have nothing to hide.
Yeah, why aren't you asking Claudia Richards about that? First my husband, then me?
I don't know. Maybe because he refused ... to leave me for her.

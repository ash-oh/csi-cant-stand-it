Found his SUV in the turnout after closing so I scoped out the area. He should've been wearing his orange vest.
Wait, what are you doing there?
Should be a total of five bullets.
That would make it about 2:00 P.M.
Deer season opened last week. Record number of permits.
Hey... saw your, uh, Tahoe. I didn't expect to see you guys back here.
Well, maybe this will help. Your dead hunter, James Jasper, didn't purchase a hunting license.
A license is 24 bucks. Hunting without one is a $1,000 fine and up to six months in jail.
You only hunt deer at dusk and at dawn.
This time of year, only deer's in season. You can take off those vests if you want.

Look, I didn't do anything wrong. I may have recycled a few caskets but you're talking about a whole different ball game, here.
Do I get paid?
Oh, if I was in that business I wouldn't worry about getting paid. You know, there are places overseas that'll pay 50 grand for one lung? Sixty for a heart?
Not firsthand. Not even secondhand. At the last funeral directors' convention ... you'd be amazed what you hear. But, you know, it takes a lot to keep a business afloat.
Well, we're talking about life and death. It's probably pretty good.
Menu, everything a la carte. Corneas, $5,000. Kidney, $20,000. Liver, 40. Bowel, 30. Pancreas, 18.
No one in the mortuary business likes to discuss the issue, but it does exist: People rob graves.
They do it for gold, trinkets or just kicks. You should hear what I hear at conventions.
As I say, we try not to discuss the issue outside of the community.
I wouldn't put it like that.
Well ... 
This might have been an inlaid casket -- something of value that people would steal.
I can arrange a viewing.
Uh, there's no such thing as a time-share coffin.
You can't prove that.
You have no idea what a cut-throat business this is. The chains are moving in. I have payments to make. I see the world from a completely different perspective than most people.
I'll repay the money.
Okay.
Okay.
92 minutes at 1,600 degrees. At, exactly, was it that you wanted to see?
I'm very sorry.
His wife, Julia Fairmont.
I didn't hear you come in.
Vivaldi ... Valenti. Both Italians. It's like being in Venice. Why are you here? Do I need a lawyer?
I was just about to commence draining when I got distracted.
I always thought there was something weird about you. 
Excuse me. You can't just come in here and look at my guy's goods. If I let you see them I have to let everybody see them. But ... perhaps we can work something out.
That's a good idea, but no. I'm starting a new business. Crime scene cleanup. I'm going to want some referrals.
Poor guy.
Why'd he eat iron?
He probably didn't even know. You're saying he was poisoned?

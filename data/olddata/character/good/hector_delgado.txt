Yo, papi, huh?
So?
Hey, could be anybody's knife.
See? You got the wrong car.
I don't know. Okay, okay! It's a friend of mine. He told me nobody would get hurt.
But, see, I could give the money back. But my wife doesn't even know it. If, I like, give the money back to her brother I could go home, right? Right?!
When I picked Carla up from work on Wednesday, I doubled back and I lifted the piece that Santee keeps by the register. I figured I'd return it Friday. Nobody would know.
I couldn't use my car, 'cause Santee knew my car, so I hit up on a buddy.
Look, it's not like they're out of anything. They're insured. For the money and his health. Nobody loses.
So can I go now?

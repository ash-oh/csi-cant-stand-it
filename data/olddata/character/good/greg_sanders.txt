So, this is it, huh? The $8,000 q-tip.
In 20 seconds, this'll give us a complete chemical breakdown right down to the atom. But I'm going to warn you, though. These mouth swabs don't always read. Vaginal swabs, no problem. a**l swabs-- money.
a**l swabs.
Yeah. Bought it the day it came out. Those graphics are killer, aren't they? My team's the Falcons. Who do you use?
A hint of saliva; some denture adhesive ... that's it. 
Sorry, man.
No, it's scopolamine. It's a chemical used for motion sickness. This eyedrop bottle's a front. One drop of this stuff and she's out cold.
Okay, dude, it's ready.
So this paper should have soaked up any foreign material on the shirt particularly amylase.
Now, I've done this procedure on jeans and leather jackets but never on something like this. It's very see-through. Very Jennifer Lopez.
It's going to be a tough one to prove. This is only step one. You see, when a person talks saliva naturally comes out of their mouth. Let's say that we're tossing the hog back and forth, right?
What can you tell me about the hottie that goes inside this blouse, huh? Is it true she's a friend of yours?
My saliva's getting on you; your saliva's getting on me.
Starch and iodine. If this is saliva, we're going to get the old dalmatian effect. So, Nick, uh, if I wanted to meet this friend of yours ... ?
Figured.
That's a pretty big spot. That's more than just a spray. In fact, looks like a distinct glob of spit.
Step three.
Well, the guy knows he did it. He's not going to cough it up.
Same as you. Worried about Nick.
A sample from the condom, yeah. Popsicled in the freezer. But, uh, it's not your case. Much as I want to help, no can do.
I would never doubt your word.
Nick's little soldiers. It's all you.
Um ... 10:15 A.M. Why?
That's normal, given the post-ejaculate time frame. How is that going to help Nick?
Abraded, yeah.
If they're fresh enough.
Okay, epithelials are an affirmative. And they're good to go for DNA profiling. I'm just going to need something to compare it to.
Skeletal muscle of Mel Bennett. It goes in ... contents come out. In 30 seconds -- bioassay. I like saying that word. Bioassay. Sounds nubian. So how are you?
Yeah? Well, you look good.
Yeah. I heard Grissom's lady friend was in town.
Really? I thought you and Grissom were tight.
Okay. Got it. Private.
Huh. Digoxin.
A couple of glasses of merlot. Rack of lamb on my day off. I slept like a baby yesterday. You look horrible.
Oh, is that all? I want to know who's going to authorize my overtime? 
You want a valium for her?
It's what I live for. You guys are never going to believe this. You ready?
Yeah. Okay, sexual assault kit on Lacey Duvall -- dead showgirl -- came back positive for semen, but that's nothing. Ran it through CODIS. Seminal DNA matches a cold case from Texas.  A dead cheerleader! Ten years ago!
Oh, man, I got to get a raise for this.
Okay, well, but getting the DNA from the tooth is going to be easy. What am I supposed to compare it to?
Why don't you go talk to the dead-end twins over there?
If you want to know if it's Portia you got to get the DNA somewhere.
match, boom, match, boom 
match, boom - boom - match. 
Cool your jets, Cath. I already got all the evidence out of it. Now ... it's all woman. Did you ever wear one of these when you were dancing?
Ooh.
I, uh, compared the DNA from the tooth with hair follicles found inside the headdress. I think we have a match, sir. And I think we may have a homicide. Excuse me.
Got the results right here. 
First things first. Not a match to Patrick Haynes.
Okay, but here's where you break out the can of creep repellent. The fingernail and the semen share half the DNA markers in common.
What is that, lip gloss? Whose?
You know I love you. Yes ... no, I love you more. No, I love you more.
Bye, baby.
Uh ...
Oh, yeah, I'm sorry. Grissom has just been running me around like a lapdog. I haven't had a chance.
Did I say Grissom? No, I meant Catherine.
Oh. Well, what do you say we check out that swab then, huh?
Don't you ever goof off, huh? Do you ever get a little lost in life?
Well, you should.
Okay...
Fluorescent minerals. Interesting.
Here, do me a favor, will you? 
Put your nose down the scope. And, when you see the sparkling bits glow give a shout. 
Okay, ready?
Lead.
Zinc.
Lithium. Anything?
Manganese.
Petroleum.
All right, how about this?
It's uranium.
Simple quantum mechanics. When the molecule is bombarded with energy at a specific level the electrons excite, causing the mineral to glow. And, at this wavelength, it's definitely uranium.
The amount is trace. We should be fine.
No.
But I can tell you one thing for sure -- there is definitely uranium on your murder weapon.
Shh. I might be looking at the mother of my children here.
No, man, this is serious. I had a date last night and this girl has the most impossible green eyes. Just ... bamm. Shoulder-length blonde hair ... intelligent ... and she smells so good.
Oh ... ideal.
And none are longer than the big toe.
Both feet. But, you know, what I need to know is what's on the inside?
No ... her DNA ... and let me tell you -- this girl has got some fine epithelials.
No, no. There is this guy in Louisville. He charges 300 clams to test your spouse's underwear for foreign DNA. Now, that guy is sick. I'm just a romantic.
Ahh, that's boring. What are you doing? What have you got?
Okay. Baby. Uh-huh.
Nine lives.
Meow.
Boss, your DNA results are back. 
Well, according to my DNA data the types are 814 quadrillion to one that your suspect is our killer.
Hey, Grissom, can I see you a second, Stat.
I am the man.
No.
Not quite.
No.
Just put your nose down the scope.
Pyoverdin.
Your killer has fluorescent blue dots in his blood.
Haven't I done enough for one day?
Hey... got good news. Walkey's blood sample ...
Fluorescent blue.
Right you are, Mr. Crime Scene Investigator. 
You know, most dogs have 42 teeth but, as you've discovered, your Cujo only has 41. Woof-woof.
I don't know. Probably blah, blah, blah.
Yes. Two words. Paw prints. Your dentally-challenged killer left them all over the vic's clothes.
True, and even if they were, we don't have the database. But they can tell you the size of the dog.
And, according to my sagacious calculations, this is a big dog. At least a hundred pounds.
Huh?
So my paw prints didn't even help.
Thank you. So now you think you're going to find this dog?
Roger that. You know, I have seen guys drink, like, five gallons of water to try and dilute their urine. It's the old straight flush. But all bad boy Sanders has to do is just test their specific gravity and-- blammo! -- I can still catch their toxic butts.
So your guy didn't do that.
No.
Yeah. For someone who's on the pill.
He's got synthetic estrogen in his urine sample. Should modulate his mood swings.
Isn't that in the constitution somewhere? A man's inalienable right to pee in private?
uh-hmm.
uh-hmm.
Squirrels love 'em ... they get tossed at dodger stadium and they make a hell of a butter.
Exactamundo. 
Peanuts! Right scope's the shell left scope's the skin of the nut. Think peanuts espa√±ol.
Uh-uh.
Who thought that a toothbrush could take a kid's life?
Then why the rubber band?
Oh, that's deep.
The semen taken from this morning's homicide matches the semen taken from the bedsheets of the last two female victims.
Yeah, but, check this out. The ejaculate sample.
Mystery substance.
No.
Freaky, huh?
You got a hot dog?
I got the ketchup.
I went back and looked at the ejaculate from the last two murders. The same thing. Indeterminate red stuff. It's c12, h22 and o11, nacl, h2o and tomato paste.
Ketchup.
Don't ask me why, but, uh ... he adds it.
Hunter F. Baumgartner. Our ketchup DNA guy.
CODIS  updates its database every couple weeks.
Well, indecent exposure. Caught in an alley behind the Monaco.
I thought he was off the case.
Come hither.
Thirteen markers, and not one of them matches the husband's types.
Actually, it's an audio book on restriction enzyme analysis and DNA typing. PCR fingerprinting. Choice.
What's Grissom doing in the garage?
Oh.
He thinks he's going to find it in a bathtub?
And let me guess -- Catherine got bored.
Hey, I thought Grissom gave you the night off.
Hey, Grissom. I hear Catherine beat you to the boat.
Okay. But, ah, she found it first. Right?
Robert Frost.
Thanks.
Come on. Level with me. Who do you think killed her -- the husband or boyfriend?
Actually, you did. You see, my second week at CSI, you told me that when a cheating spouse is murdered there's always two suspects at the top of the list: The lover and the betrayed.
Mm-hmm. You see, I'm thinking that the husband caught Wendy with the boyfriend and when she left his house, he killed her in a jealous rage.
Nothing. I'm just trying to help.
Hey. If this theory checks out, uh maybe we should talk about a raise.
My name is Paul and this is between y'all.
No problem, son. 
Fifteen seconds till pay dirt.
Play any pigskin, man?
It's prime time for you.
Hmm. Haven't seen this stuff for a while.
Jimsonweed.
Yeah, but that doesn't necessarily prove that the seeds from the dead kid's gut came from the same place as the seeds in the dealer's car.
So how many grains of sand in the ocean, huh?
Oh, nothing. I, uh ... I was just telling Nick about your sand. Well, it's not sand. It's not natural anyway. Here, check this out.
Now, if this were natural sand, the surface would be smooth. 
This looks more like Fremont Street on a Saturday night ... rough.
No. No way. I analyzed the mineral content. It's feldspar and quartz. That's crushed gray sandstone. It's man-made, in a rock crusher.
Nonoxynol-9, polyvinyl alcohol, and...
Yeah.
Chamomile.
Sure.
So you used to work at the French Palace?
You know, my friends and I used to go there.
Payday fridays.
Maybe I saw you perform?
Why?
This stuff has to be inserted fifteen minutes to three hours before s*x.
But how could she have known to put the birth control in before she was raped?
Well, what you got here is a nice bordeaux and a starbucks blend. No blood. No saliva.
Yeah. Looks like somebody stomped on your dead guy.
Now, this is where Ecklie swabbed the blood sample from the blade fifteen years ago. It's your friend's, Stephanie Watson. And we got the second sample from the handle end. Perfect match to Dwight Kelso, the guy convicted for Stephanie's murder.
Had to be hard on you. Losing a friend, someone that you ...
Did I miss something?
Hmm, it's blood. That's a weak sample. That's probably why Ecklie took the thicker one.
Yeah, except now, we can replicate DNA a million times, even from the most minute sample of blood.
Let me know what you find out.
Yes, ma'am.
I ran that faint blood sample from the knife.
Yeah, I know.
I thought so.
Results from the colored material found at the crime scene. I'm trying to be humble, but once again I have the case breaker.
Well, I have to warn you, any food I find in the gum is not going to be unique. Why don't you just give me a suspect I can match to?
All right, then I guess it's slice and dice.

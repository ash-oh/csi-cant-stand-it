I didn't want my fiancé to know. Because he's staying at this hotel.
He was dance out but definitely alive.
Yes. My wedding is tomorrow. Whatever we can do to help.
I don't mean to be snippy, but we're already late for my rehearsal dinner.
So ... can we go now? My fiancé is already asking questions.
What's going on?
Darren had been flirting with me all night. And, when it was time to leave I told the other girls to wait in the car. I know it's crazy but I thought ... I'm in Vegas. It doesn't really count.
And ... then I don't know what happened.
I saw my engagement ring. 
Then I-I thought about Luke and how he trusts me.
I don't think this is right.
I tried to push Darren of me ...
But I-I don't think it got through.
He wouldn't stop. 
As soon as I hit him with the lamp, I knew.
Mm-hmm. I didn't mean to kill him.
No. It's a real diamond. My fiancé wanted me to have the best.
Zirconia-studded. It's a promise ring. He told me to save my money ... for our honeymoon.
I don't think this is right.
Oh, my god! Luke.
Honey, I'm sorry.

Cliff. Who are you?
She's in Canada visiting her parents. Why?
Hey, he had it coming. I'll tell you that right now. Apartment stank, there were flies everywhere, no water. So I trashed the place.
The apartment manager. The lazy b*st*rd. Serves him right.
Yeah.
It's my blood.
No. I get nosebleeds.
From Hepatitis C. I got blood to spare. My nose is like old faithful. Finally came in handy.
Yeah. I hope I made his clean-up job hell.
That's not supposed to go anywhere.
That's home to me now. Been staying there about a week.
Sure.
Used to do some landscaping.
Hey, save me $250 a week truck rental. Keep it as long as you want. I'll sleep in the break room.
I told you I had a condition, Hepatitis C. I was diagnosed when I was 18.
Thanks for coming around to my side. Which way is out?
I wasn't getting anywhere with words. Look, if it'll get me out of here any quicker, I'll show you. 
Um ... it's really not that big a deal. 
You might want to back up.

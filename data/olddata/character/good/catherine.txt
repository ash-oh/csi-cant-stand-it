Please. Cream with some of that fake stuff.
Hey, how's the body with the bugs?
What do you have for us?
Missing since last night. Last seen at home of Richard Zeigler in - ooh -- Summerlin.
Bye.
Is everything okay? You've been quiet all night.
I don't believe this.
Yes. He's pissed off because I won't let him back into my life so he sics Child Services on me.
I never expected they were going to talk to my friends. Well, what did they ask? What did you say?
Hi. Sir, we're with the Las Vegas Crime Lab. We're here about a Paul Sorenson.
Thank you.
Sorenson is a painting.
How dumb are we?
Right on.
Why don't we dust for prints?
Oh, yeah. Inside job. 
So ... was it a disaster with Child Services?
Well, my job does take me away from my daughter. Nobody knows that better than you.
Well, not intentionally.  They just, you know, know how to ask questions.
We're working on it, sir.
How many people have access to your home -- keys and security code?
Can you get them all here? They might be able to help us with evidence.
Helix, antihelix, helix rim, tragus, antitragus.
Come on. An earprint?
Yeah, I know, I know. I'd like to see that one on appeal. Well, photograph and lift. We'll have someone to compare it to soon enough.
It's just like a fingerprint ... for your ears.
Well, there's no forced entry. Someone shut off your alarm. That tells us that we eliminate the family first before we widen our investigation.
Thank you, sir.
You're a good sport.
We got a match.
What do you think?
Jason, do you still have the painting?
Well, that would be selling stolen property and you would be arrested, no matter what your dad says.
Thank you.
Nicky, how's it going?
If only her artwork brought in this kind of dough I wouldn't need to worry about her college tuition.
Keep walking.
Okay, now I know that these are rich people and it's just a painting and nobody died, but ... this just doesn't feel finished.
I know.
Court.
Yeah.
Hey, Warrick. Are you going to tell me?
About Child Services?
Really?
I was reading up on Sorenson, and I found a site that says that 15% of all museum art is fake.
You're so right, but if this is a forgery, we've got a new crime.
So, an authentic Sorenson would be titanium-free.
Okay, so if the owner purchased this painting from a reputable auction house, they would have run a similar test to this?
This kid's in college, right? Let's check his dorm room.
Hello, Mr. Zeigler.
Yes.
We'd like to ask a favor of you Mr. Zeigler. A private viewing of the painting.
Robbery checked with your school. They actually teach classes in how to copy the Masters.
But, the other night, his little scam was interrupted.
The police are going to want to know if you're pressing charges this time.
Yeah.
Hi.
Whoa, somebody likes their job.
Ex-girlfriend, Nick?
Oh, no. What are you going to do?
Heavy pastiosity?
Grissom.  I've got something you'll want to see.
You know how you're always pushing that holy trinity stuff?
Victim, suspect, crime scene.
Right. Well, we don't have a victim. We don't have a suspect. All we have is a crime scene -- the restroom at Marty's Market with the message, I killed five women. So, I figured there had to be four others.
No. I found the four other crime scenes.
Brass ran our case through VICAP. 
I made a few calls ...
Five stall doors from five supermarket rest rooms. Five missing women, including Margaret Shorey.
Just like Marty's Market -- there was no physical evidence indicating that the women were killed there.
Interstate 15. God knows I've driven it enough times.
I'll flip you to see who drives.
Moapa.
Besides the I-15?
You two ladies done talking? It's hot out here.
Well, it's not Margaret. This one's a blonde.
Missing woman number one -- disappeared from a supermarket restroom last July.
I-15? Refrigerated?
What's his problem?
Brass got us a list of all the refrigerated trucks that made deliveries to the market yesterday. 
There's a female trucker on it.
Do yourself a favor.
I've got a kite. Can you see the women? Kill the lights.
Three times.
Caucasian female with only a high school education and left-handed.
I'll be right back.
She's not the one.
The right to keep on trucking.
Well, Ms. Hard-ass travels with her boyfriend. I bet you a lot of guys travel with their girlfriends.
No.
Eliminate all trucks that only travel in state.
Now eliminate the trucks that don't deliver to supermarkets along the I-15.
That's our guy. He delivered to all five towns -- all five supermarkets.
We got three.
Try this.
We're going to take you home.
Am I disturbing you?
Good.
Here they are.
Give him a perfect ten or your ass is out of here.
The prisoner plea. Brass told me about the video.
Wait a minute. Ecklie was the CSI on that arson. I see a bad moon rising.
Only if they're of equal rank and they're looking for trouble.
Yeah.
Hey, O'Riley, anyone put their meat hooks on this vehicle?
Still got to ask.
Just a baby. 
Tap city. Empty.
Killer was probably in the back seat waiting for him. 
Kid never stood a chance.
Maybe he was deaf.
You hungry, Nick? Got a burger. Extra lettuce.
Giants ... negative nine.
What does a kid doing walking around with a wad like that betting thirty grand on a football game? Who wrote the ticket?
So, it was found with the kid killed in your parking lot.
A runner?
Kid wasn't a day over sixteen. Isn't that illegal?
Well, does 517 have a name?
Well, you've been very helpful. Thank you.
Mrs. Hillman? Is this your son?
Mrs. Hillman? Was your son hearing-impaired? Joey was wearing a hearing aid.
I don't know.
Danny?
Well, the police will want to talk to your son Danny.
Well, that's more than a little something.
So, who was your boss then?
It's illegal to use two-way communication in the sportsbook.
You like the Lakers today?
So do I.
From a sneeze.
Mm-hmm, with the sniffles.
So what is the DNA like in mucus these days?
Thanks.
Oh, hi, David. What's up?
Detective?
Yeah, thanks. Did you call Nick?
Well, I can see why you ran.
You guys don't even know who your boss is, do you?
Danny ... do you have any idea who shot your brother?
Oh, one of you is going to win a trip, all right. Everybody clear this is voluntary?
So everyone is clear.
Yeah.
Well, if you're that confident it's not one of your guys you must know who it is.
Head back. 
Okay. You're all free to go.
Oh, these fire guys really know how to trash a crime scene.
It's not the size of the bomb. It's the overpressure in the air around it.
A perfectly symmetrical amputation. Means he was looking directly at the bomb when it went off.
Uh-huh. 
Gunpowder.
I'd love to.
Seat of the bomb is here. Victim was thrown ... three meters. His clothes are torn but not burnt, indicating a low-velocity propellant -- 6,000-
Time will tell.
Bombs explode. Weird thing is their components survive the explosion. If we can piece together this bomb, we're closer to finding who did this. So, Warrick, when you're photographing this debris can you, uh ... ?
F - P - 
Well, are his initials F.P.?
I found this near the point of origin.
Whoever did this is playing with us.
Yep.
Vacuum effect. The air is being pushed out so fast ...
... when the bomb detonates ... 
... there's a calm at the center.
Well, except for when he lost his ears.
I ran it through ATF's bomb database. No profile.
Dominic the security guard? It's too soon to tell.
Looks like a balance wheel from a clock.
We're kind of busy here, Nick.
Hey, Nick ... I'm sorry to hear about your friend.
Word travels. It was the day shift coroner.
Not yet.
Bad idea. You and Ecklie ... oil and water. Just let me get into it.
If Nick's arrested. it's not going to matter that he's cleared later.
Eyes, no hands.
Look at those ligature marks.
Raccoon eyes excoriation around the neck. She didn't give up easy.
Ecklie find the murder weapon?
Did you check for fingerprints on the body?
Half-life of fingerprints on flesh ... they're disappearing as we speak.
Then that's what you report. Evidence, Doc ...  ... all we got.
Oh, hey, uh Conrad, Grissom's in the field.
And I need to speak with you ... about Nick Stokes.
Come on. The hooker was a person. Her name was Kristy Hopkins.
Nick, I don't think that you guys should be talking.
You know what? Nick's private life ...
Okay, look, I'm going to get O'Riley to track down this Jack guy for questioning. But I am out on a limb for you here, Nick. Just don't make it harder with Ecklie, okay?
I ran priors. The guy's got an '88 conviction for sexual assaults.
It's a load of crap, and you know it.
Sheriff, you arrest Nick now you end his career.
Nothing, except my gut and ten years of experience. He didn't do this.
So give me twelve hours, access to the crime scene and evidence without filing papers on Nick.
How you doing, Greg?
Yeah. I need to see his DNA from the crime scene. You have it, right?
That's my case for the next twelve hours. Ask the Sheriff.
Smart man.
Thanks, Greg. 
When did you say this sample was frozen?
These guys are all heads-- no tails.
The sperm found in the condom was frozen at 10:15 A.M. It's all heads, no tails.
It takes about seven hours for bacteria to eat away at the tails placing the time of ejaculation at around 2:00 A.M. But Kristy's time of death was 6:00 A.M.
You could be a little more supportive.
Kristy Hopkins was strangled with this sash. 
It's fingerprint-free, but the force of the pull would have scratched off epithelials from the killer's hands, right?
And can you extract DNA from epithelials?
Jack Willman has a prior for a sexual assault so his DNA is on file.
I think that you and I should head over to the police station.
Never have I seen such a clean match. Jack Willman killed her.
Hey ... hey, I'm just doing my job. Besides, if they'd sent you to jail I'd get stuck with all your cases.
O'Riley.
Get him out of here.
How long you think it's been out here?
And long enough for the elements to have washed away any evidence.
Well, it is a leg bone, and my guess is that it didn't walk out here by itself.
You see, that way, I'm never disappointed. You know, sometimes I'm nicely surprised. So, can we call it a crime scene?
Yes, professor, I, too, took Osteology.
Well, I feel it in every one of my 206 bones that this was a murder.
So we just talked with the academy. We're getting an entire class of cadets meeting us there.
Mm-hmm.
So we'll do a grid search and we really could use your friend Teri Miller.
Well, why not? She's a forensic anthropologist -- specializes in bones -- and, hello ... all we've got is a bone.
Okay.
Oh, yeah.
Stop!
What are you doing?
I-I hope you had your Hepatitis B shot. 
Did you?
Well, do you want to suck it ... to be sure?
Flag!
So ... you thinking what I'm thinking?
Mmm ... no. I-I was thinking that we have about 100 bone fragments. We could I.D. this body before the end of the shift.
Stars and trucks?
That's the femur.
That is correct. According to the book.
Hmm. Have we hit a wall yet?
Well, he was old-- there's some calcification on the rib cartilage.
Are the bones whispering to you?
Wait a minute. This guy was chopped up. That's murder.
A mulching machine? How long do you plan on ignoring the obvious? 
A 70-year-old man found in the mountains with clear evidence he was chopped to pieces. That's a ... homicide.
Thanks for coming, Teri.
I told you I was ... calling Teri ... ... didn't I? Anyway, what were you saying about hemorrhagic tissue?
And you don't bring in one, possibly compromise the case, because you two had a relationship?
Oh ... so I guess that dopey look in your eye when she's around is just that. Here's the deal -- we're using cliff notes to put that skeleton back together in there. Teri is availing her services. You said she's the best, but, hey, if you want me to send her away ...
Right.
Really?
No way. A local dentist. 
Move over. 
Overlapping left incisors. That's the front teeth, right?
Gold fillings. Well, I know that. He's got gold fillings in
And the winner is ...
Excuse me. Um ... the person's name is Mel Bennett. We just confirmed it. We're going to meet Brass at the widow's house.
Well, do you know where he is?
Is that because she just found out he's dead or because she got caught?
Oh, I don't know. These two were good with each other. 
It takes a bad marriage to recognize a good one.
Well, not even an aspirin. 
Look at this. The tub hasn't been used in a while.
Tub's the most obvious place to cut up a body but I don't see anything down there.
Give me a swab.
We found blood in the drain.
And this saw matches the one that Brass found in Mrs. Bennett's garage?
You mean Mrs. Bennett? 
Oh, right.  Reserve judgment.
But not so strong as to make clean cuts.
Well, I'm going to go check that out. Teri ...  ... You rule.
I do. There's no evidence of blood.
Which means he was already dead.
So what does that leave us?
Leaves me with a black widow.
Disassembled him? So she admits to taking an electric saw to her husband?
There's no law saying it's okay, either.
Manageable?
Well, Mrs. Bennett ... can you afford the burial now?
It's her husband's social security checks from the last two years.
It's also a motive.
Typical Vegas wife - off'ed her old man for the money and there's nothing we can do about it.
Right. There's always a clue except we don't have a body.
I try.
Ladyfriend? Hmm. Wouldn't know anything about that.
We are.
Digoxin?
She poisoned him.
Did you kill him for his pension checks?
Because a wife's benefits are cut in half when the husband dies.
So what do you think, Jim?
So that leaves us with one choice.
Golden rule.
I don't think she did it.
See you. 
Okay, so I was wrong. It wasn't murder. 
You want to go in with me? Give her the good news?
Sure.
I'll take the shallow end.
Can I get you a towel, sir?
Turquoise and silver. Breaks down the regionality to the southwest -- maybe Arizona, New Mexico, Texas.
Hey.
419 at the Sphere, glass elevator. You're on it.
Well, groove on down to The Strip.
I was probably saying that to get you to service my needs at the time.
Oh ...
Hi.
Private club fifty grand a year just to walk through the door.
And you're house-sitting? Or you're living in?
Could you put us in touch with someone who was close to her?
Close your mouth.
Did he have a name?
Turned on by the mystery and the s*x. I've been there.
What's with the smile?
Let me guess: You're wondering why Lacey Duvall had a music box engraved to Portia Richmond.
Maybe it's as simple as they knew each other and she gave it to her.
You know, when Eddie and I were first married -- when things were kind of good? On the anniversary of the day we first met, he'd always give me a lace teddy. Well, I mean, I know it's not a music box, but ... 
Right.
March 7, 1973.
March 7, 1956. 
March 7,1986.
She wouldn't give away a gift this sentimental. 
It's not waltz of the flowers.
The seal on the door wasn't broken.
Caught in the act.
Oh, yeah.
A little late for that.
Big word.
Mm-hmm.
Let me see if Portia took her bathing suit with her. 
Here we go.
We've got a bathing suit, lingerie, jewels, wallet, bags ... I'm not so sure she's gone anywhere.
What?
Ugh. I guess now we have two cases. We've got a body without a murderer and a murder without a body.
Greg ... why don't you start the DNA profile on the tooth so that we can tell if it's Portia Richmond.
How about the toothbrush and the hairbrush that we took from her vanity?
Nothing. Hmm.
So, either she's extremely hygienic, or...
I can't believe I've been in this town twenty years and I've never seen the Liberace Museum.
I believe it.
Lovely.
Oh, yeah.
Yes, please.
Ow.
DNA heaven.
You want to take that thing off your head, Greg? It's evidence.
I wore nothing but skin.
Did you see that?
She took that fur from right under their noses.
Well, in addition to exchanging bodily fluids did you exchange gifts?
Well, according to her credit card statements Portia Richmond hasn't spent a dime since she's been in the Mediterranean.
Oh, not necessarily. Maybe she's been ... swept off her feet.
And what question is that, Nick?
Boys and girls, we've got ourselves a forgery.
Well, his name is Chad.
All right, but ... I've had them on for a week. Can't account for what's on it.
Which leaves small indentations on the blank sheet. All you do now is connect the dots, then get rid of the evidence ... but, obviously, they didn't.
Suddenly a personal shredder sounds like a mighty find investment.
Me. I thought it would be nice.
Let's. I don't think a forged signature is a slam dunk for murder.
So is this.
Right, right, and we've got a cuff link with the initials C.M. Found in the bottom of the pool along with a floating showgirl.
Exactly. I mean, you know, you can change your name. You can't change your blueprint.
The Hayneses controlled Portia Richmond's bank account including the Burn Center Account but they had to stick around for the checks to clear.
Excellent question.
Uh, Brass, cough it up. Cover Nick's, too. He had that tiramisu.
Huh. Just like with Lacey Duvall.
Uh ... who wants to tell us about Portia Richmond?
Cholesterol is found in humans, not fish. So how does a fish acquire human cholesterol?
Surely.  So, you got our assignments?
This mess? You're not serious.
And why isn't the case CSI dealing with this?
And what did the DA charge?
Well, no pressure here.
Why would my bank be asking you about my employment record?
We didn't want to sell it until the market went back up and then we were going to split the profits. I can't believe he took a second out on the house. How can he do that without my signature?
I called Eddie about the loan. I got his voicemail. The guy's like ether. You going to answer my question?
All right, here's McCall's statement. If you can believe a guy who's looking at murder. Mccall says that he returned Hastings' motorcycle to him with the front end smashed up. They were standing in Hastings' backyard...
Mccall defends himself with an automatic that was down his pants.
Mm-hmm.
So, what? McCall lied. He really said that Hastings cam at him with a screwdriver so he can plead self-defense?
All right, which box?
The evidence is lost? In a murder case?
So, we know why Franovich left. He quit before we could fire his ass. 
So, you know who the DA will blame for this?
Well, now that we've exhausted all of our options let's start over.
Hi. Laurieane Hastings? We're with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
We're simply reviewing the evidence for the preliminary hearing.
You were home.
And you saw the shooting?
How long did you say they had been arguing before you heard the first shot?
And then you went out back?
Okay, thank you. This won't take very long.
She did a fill-in back there in the garage. First, she said she saw both shots, but I just asked her and she said she heard the first shot and then came running out here.
Yeah.
Right. It took me 3.8 seconds to get out here. She didn't see any shot.
Right.
So, there's a good chance that McCall was telling the truth -- that he shot Hastings in self-defense.
Right.
Right. Let's go see McCall. No one lost him.
Can you circle the area in which the screwdriver entered your arm when Hastings attacked you? 
May I exam your client's wound?
Thanks. 
I think he's telling the truth. He's right-handed. I could tell when he took the pen.
And even if he'd tried to fool us and stabbed his right arm the entry scar would have been upward, not down.
Well, the coroner disagrees.
People don't realize just how many sets of hands a piece of evidence passes through. Losing evidence isn't about anything sneaky. It's just human error.
Yeah, tell me about it.
You get that loan canceled, and you do it now, Ed. Now! 
Well, this is progress. The shirt confirms what the coroner said: That the shots were fired back to front. Look at those entry holes.
Which happens when a gun is fired less than three feet from a victim.
McCall says that they were standing five paces apart. 
Mrs. Hastings says the exact same thing. So we have two eyewitnesses on opposite sides of the case ... saying the same thing.
Well, the DA's on my beeper. Would you, uh, explain this to him because I can't.
Figures. I just had a manicure.
Right.
Using the same firearm and ammo that McCall used in his backyard on Hastings. 
And according to Lauriane Hastings' statement he was running away. How can the second shot be closer than the first?
Can't happen when someone's facing you.
I think I know how we can figure this out. I saw this thing in my forensics catalog.
Oh, yeah. He's worth it.
Well, look at him. He's lifelike, he doesn't talk, and he's self-
Yeah. We make a mistake in our calculations we just start over.
All right. How's that?
All right.
And McCcall says that Hastings was facing him shot him in self-defense and he's got the wound ... to prove it.
Mm-hmm.
Warrick ... ?
I think maybe they were both telling the truth. 
Hey, baby.
He is?
Ed ...
Uh, I'll see you in a bit, honey. 
You set me up. Again.
Get over here.
You are so pathetic.
Just so pathetic.
Sucking up to our daughter 'cause I caught you robbing me.
No s*x is worth you, and you are not taking my daughter to a club with one of your music whores.
It was a job, Ed and it supported you, just like every job I've had including this one!
You're such a bast...!
Let go of me.
Just get him out of here.
Well ... bear with us.
I'm Hastings. I stab McCall in the right arm.
And Hastings charges again. This time he lunges at his midsection.
He shoots from two feet according to our firearms range test and the unburned powder on the victim's clothes.
The first shot is fired in self-defense. But then McCall shoots Hastings a second time. Now that shot ...
... Was not in self-defense.
We'll see you in court, Sam.
Um, well, uh, she's with my sister. Hey, thanks for helping me out there. 
I appreciate it. I ...
Robbery interruptus?
One way to beat the rap.
Can you tell us anything about the murder weapon?
Hey, Doc, you have a comb?
Gee, thanks, Nick.
That's what I'm doing although I don't think this is dirt. 
He's covered in spores. 
I think these are from a fern.
A fern plant deposits billions of spores in its lifetime. Most are just dust in the wind. In our case they're evidence. As good as fingerprints or fibers in placing a suspect at a crime scene.
Hey, you forget about the coroner?
Excuse me?
Why do I know that name?
Oh, that Melissa Marlowe. Wasn't she presumed dead?
I don't see a match.
You've got a perfect match. Wait. Is she a suspect in the homicide?
And Nick and I will cover the homicide.
He put you in the gray bar? Sounds like motive to me.
He must have really pissed you off when he turned on you.
Looks authentic. Cactus Pine Cafe, Barstow, noon today.
At a pottery store on Stansberry Street. Tammy, we've already I.D.'D your father. If you don't want to see him, I'd understand.
Well, don't be surprised by some swelling and discoloration. 
You have any other family?
I can put you in touch with a counselor if you need to talk.
Is there anything you need?
Tammy ... were you at the pottery store with your father?
There's some plant spores on your sweater. We found them on your father, too, and matched them to some ferns behind the pottery store.
I'm taking these spores into evidence. They place you at the crime scene. Is there anything you want to tell me?
Why didn't you just tell me that?
Am I interrupting?
Oh, my god.
That's Tammy Felton and we've already met.
She was kidnapped 21 years ago and may have killed the man who raised her -- possibly the same man who kidnapped her.
Hey, Nick. So what's the word on the murder weapon?
Why don't you just talk with him?
Dr. Kane, this girl was kidnapped at age four. Would she have any recollection of her prior life?
That's got to be frustrating.
Such as?
Tammy Felton needs help. She may be a suspect, but she's also a victim.
Tell me about your mother.
Tammy, if you've got nothing to hide and you want me to find out who killed your father why don't you just answer my questions?
Your parents, were they close?
Do you have any siblings?
How was your childhood? Were you a happy child? Did you have any friends?
Sure.
Tammy -- Tammy Felton.
What?
Tammy referred to her mother as Mara, now deceased.
Of course. I didn't mean ...
What were you thinking?
That woman hasn't seen her daughter in 21 years. You actually thought a glass wall would keep them apart?
I know. You're not good with people.
Hi, Tammy. We just, uh, want to look around.
Tammy, could you step outside? This officer will keep you company.
Thanks.
Yellow paint.
Well, that's affirmative for uranium.
Tammy, I need your right index finger.
Who else was there?
Tammy ...
Who was with you?
But Melissa killed Joseph Felton -- Tammy's father.
Forensic psychology is a science.
Thank you. I got a call that Melissa wanted to see me.
Am I speaking to Melissa ... or Tammy?
I'm not an attorney. There are no privileges here. Whatever you say ...
The evidence is damaging.
You have a lawyer. Why are you asking me?
I'm not an expert.
Then you shouldn't have any memories of me ... Tammy. 
There is no Melissa, is there?
I'm gone.
Guard.
Hey, come on. We're going to be late for the prelim.
What? Why?
How much did the parents lose?
Right.
Brass, it's Catherine. I need a credit card purchase report on the Marlowes. The last 24 hours. Based on what? Based on the fact that the Marlowes are blind when it comes to their daughter and would do anything for her.
Look, you're here, she's not and we know that you helped her flee the jurisdiction.
Wherever you think she is -- wherever you're planning on meeting her -- she's not there. She played you. Now, if you'll just tell us where she is, we won't file charges, right?
Think about what you're doing.
Hey.
Thanks.
I was assigned. This is my case.
Right. That's why you were assigned -- a homicide detective. What happened?
Body count?
And you're not calling this a crime scene?
O'Riley ... it's a suspect.
Hi. District Engineer?
Ah. Follow the tie. 
Is that from the rain?
Are you hiding something, or am I not worth your time?
Well, you are the District Engineer of the city, right? You're responsible for the structural safety of this building.
Catherine Willows, Las Vegas Crime Lab.
Yeah. The building fell down. Three people were crushed to death. 
Why is the wood wet?
Then what am I looking at?
Drywall. But what about this layer right here?
What, was quarter inch on sale that day?
Catherine.
Don't say, sorry just know who you're talking to.
It's noticeable now. Which District Engineer conducted the last inspection?
Then it looks bad for you.
Where's the point of origin of the collapse? 
Look, this is my crime scene. I can find it myself but that might mean lots of question to lots of people.
Then that's where I want to be.
No offense, but they work for you.
Well, so the victims' family deserves answers.
Somebody's responsible.
Well, maybe not intentionally, but if a ship sinks, the last person who checked for leaks is negligent.
Thanks for your input.
I'm going in.
Why is everybody asking me if I want to do my job?
And?
I know I have a job to do. Excuse me.
Am I almost at ground zero?
I feel like I'm crawling through a straw.
Sweet!
Are you getting this?
I'm not an entomologist, but I know one. He can tell us.
I thought this building was secure.
Nellis Air Force Base.
Anything else I should, uh be aware of?
Okay.
Okay. I'm in the laundry room ... what's left of it. You want to talk me through this?
Got it.
Yeah, it's wood, all right. 
And it looks like somebody took a sledgehammer to it.
He likes you, too. Now, tell me about him.
You assigned me the case. You already know that.
The frame's made of Douglas Fir.
I did find more than a bug. Dry rot, questionable repairs, a jittery Engineer. And check this out.
I know. Gives new meaning to home wrecker.
Translation: We're opening a political can of worms. The mayor's involved, an election's around the corner and you could've clued me in a little earlier.
Sorry. It's evidence.
I know-- wood.
Nope.
How did you get in here?
A lot of factors contributed to the collapse. I'm focusing on the human element.
Now... if a sledgehammer was taken to this column recently there'd be evidence of discoloration. The damaged part would be lighter.
Hands off.
Yeah.
Public record? And you failed to indicate the damage in your inspection report?
Tell that to the women who were crushed to death.
Proving that you're not responsible for what happened to that building.
The damaged support column buckled. Why?
Good. We're on the same page. Now, I put a section of the floor assembly in the tank. I added a dozen or so of my daughter's rubber balls two sub-woofers ...
Exactly. Because I suspect that sound vibrations may be the ultimate cause of the collapse.
No, but, uh, maybe F-16s and whatever else they're flying out of Nellis Air Force Base.
Now, I ramped up the decibels on the stereo to maximize the vibrations.
Watch the bouncing balls. 
The nails are rotating. Like screws. Righty, tighty. Lefty, loosey.
Multiply that by 50 years of flybys.
No. You point one finger there's always going to be four pointing back at you. Beetles, sabotage, dry rot and time.
Yes. 
Anything you want to say to me?
You're welcome.
Oh ... god.
Yeah, considering there's only about six billion people in the world ... ah, thanks.
We want this one.
Right. 
Hey, remember about three months ago I applied to the American Academy meeting in Chicago? Well, the deadline for your approval is end of shift today.
There's important papers to be presented ...
Thank you.
Get ready to pull a double.
I count two -- where are the others?
Hey, I know this guy.
Oh, yeah. Too many dips in the chips.
Assuming Flynn was the target, and it was a hit the shooter followed Flynn ...
... in the front door ... shot the muscle first ...
... then Flynn ...
... and some poor kid minding his own business. 
The girls were last.
... four dead. One is still alive.
What do you know about Flynn?
Any bullets recovered?
Why?
Guess he got off easy.
I.D.?
Just keeps getting better. Someone notify the husband?
How far along was she?
She knew.
Need help with the measurements?
Shooting occurred around closing time. Is it customary for your employees to close up?
Grissom!
Grissom!
Grissom!
About what it's like to be deaf?
Sara told me that you spoke in sign and now you're putting plugs in your ears.
Mm-hmm. Is that why you forgot about the conference?
You missed the deadline. No Chicago for me.
This is the one meeting I needed to attend. I don't always want to be second banana. I can probably do your job. I know that I can do Ecklie's.
Make sure to submit the paperwork by the end of the day.
Well, I knew you'd forget so I upped the deadline -- gave you a buffer. Don't forget again.
Frankie Flynn.
Why don't you tell us about your CCW permit.
What kind?
Talk to me.
Bobby?
Well, what about the breach-face marks on the casings?
Hmm. 
Well, well ... looks like you got zip.
So we have no statements or physical evidence indicating it was a hit on Flynn.
Yeah ... why?
Not yet. 
Nick?
Headphones.
Ricochet. Through and through.
Flynn was closest to the door.
Me, too.
What if the shooter was here when he shot big Al?
If the shooter walked through the front door.
Erin McCarty-- the employee who was supposed to close up.
If she was headed towards the parking lot, how do you explain this ricochet?
The ricochet went out into the store.  There's no hole in the door. There's no hole in the door 'cause the door had to have been open.
He shot toward the parking lot first and then toward the front of the store.
So who was in the line of fire? What if we have it backwards? What if ... the shooting began back here ... with Erin?
The target was Erin ... the pregnant girl and the rest was damage control.
Twenty-year-old girl, living at home? She would have taken a test if she was five seconds late -- panic city.
Well, it's not immaculate conception. If the guy was Mr. Right she would have told her folks. Which means he was Mr. Wrong. Maybe Mr. Married.
You still have the pregnant girl?
Six weeks with half of someone else's DNA in her body.
You're the manager. Erin was the employee.
Maybe we do-- we all make mistakes-- but, just to be sure why don't you give us a sample of your DNA and you'll be on your way.
A bunter tool makes a unique mark.
They're identical. You came here that night ... to kill Erin.
You came in through the back. Erin was in the office.
But Alice saw so you shot her.
You thought that Erin had locked up but there was a kid drinking coffee 
... and then things got out of hand.
Is that why you brought your gun?
The carnival case. I'm taking it.
A six-year-old girl died on a ride at the carnival over on Washington. The paperwork's on your desk.
You think I overstepped?  These people come to town, they commit crimes and they leave. I just want to get there before the carnival moves on.
She's meeting me there.
Stop.
What are you doing? That bag's been used 100 times. Get her a new one.
What if it was your kid?
She gets this one.
She looks scared. No six-year-old should have to go through that.
Why don't you go find the mother and talk to her. I'll take the crime scene.
Not anymore. So you didn't know that anything was wrong until this car came out of the tunnel, right?
Seat belt's loose.
Did you check this one?
So do you strap the riders in, or do they do it themselves?
So you keep the belts loose on purpose. Loose enough for adults to get close or six-year-old kids to slide through?
Officer, give us a minute. 
You tampered with the evidence.
Spare me the hee haw routine. You run this nightmare on wheels. I found this in there. 
You sent one of your employees into that tunnel to fix the track where that little girl was killed to cover your ass?
Field test for drugs. I'm sure you've done this before.
Oh, before you came to Nevada you should have looked up the law. Mandatory drug testing wherever there's been an accident. Pee now, and don't tell me you're shy. 
Stay on him.
Yeah, well, there should be. And I don't have to wait for results to know that guy's coked out of his brain.
Oh ... crawling all under his skin.
So you did the tox screen on my carny?
Mm-hmm. So?
Great. What did he do? Try and mask it?
Oh, come on. That creep tested clean?
What?
Oldest trick in the book. Somebody else's urine. Probably keeps a stash in his trailer and that uniform was too green to look for it.
What a surprise.
Let's go.
What did you do?
If you so much as breathed on this child, the evidence will tell me. You can dope your urine change your name compare yourself to Elvis himself, but if you harmed Sandy Dantini, I'm going to get you.
No.
Pickens is a drug addict and s*x offender operating a two-ton kid magnet.
Did you take a look around that carnival?
Did you notice anything about those other rides? Ferris wheel-single cars in the open. Zipper-single cars in the open. Himalaya-group cars in the open. How come Pickens was hanging around the only ride that takes kids into the dark? 
What if he pulled that little girl out of the car?
How tall was the victim?
The water was a foot and a half deep. She could've easily climbed out, unless she was unconscious.
Spiral or straight?
Somebody twisted that little girl's arm hard enough to break it.
He's a s*x offender. He was going to take her someplace.
You read the OSHA report. How many emergency doors were operational?
He was trapped like a rat.
He did the only thing he could -- he hid the evidence.
You're going to enter this as a homicide, right?
It's a homicide. I'm going to get your proof. So write down that
I'm not a coroner. What's your daughter's name?
Oh, Mrs. Dantini. I'm Catherine Willows, from the Crime Lab. You've spoken with my colleague, Sara Sidle. I'm so sorry.
Actually, I'd like to ask you a few questions. Is it possible that someone reached into your car and pulled out your daughter?
Well, when you went in the water to try to save Sandy did you hear anything? Did you... sense that anyone was there... in the dark?
I'm not ruling anything out.
It's evidence. It's not going anywhere. Nothing is.
It's going to take a lot more than vegetable insults to get us to move.
Oh, I know exactly who you are, Mr. Pickens. And if you so much as look at me in the wrong way, I will personally lock you in a cell with someone who's going to do the same thing to you that you've been doing to those little girls.
What?
As compared to what?
I want four techs in there. Let's try to pull the girl out from every conceivable angle.
Mom was on the left. Where's my dummy? 
Forty-two pounds?
And, just like ... the loose seat belt.
The belt wasn't loose enough to yank the girl out. Forget Pickens.
Her eyes were pointing in the wrong direction.
Carla Dantini was looking left when she told me about the accident. 
When a person is remembering, they look right and when they're creating, they look left.
Call Brass and tell him to meet us at the mother's house.
You got the warrant, right?
We need to see the clothes that you wore the day that your daughter died.
No, it can't.
So this is everything that you wore at the carnival last night?
Your watch is waterlogged.
How come your shoes are dry?
The lining's blue. If they'd gotten wet the indigo dye would have bled onto your white socks.
If you didn't go into the water how did your watch get wet?
You reached for her all right.  To hold her under.
And you held her under while you sat in that car until you drowned her.
You took your daughter to the carnival 'cause kids get hurt there all the time. You thought the blame would leave town with the ride. Well, you should have planned better. 
What did you actually think? That you and your boyfriend would run off like newlyweds? No kid? No cares?
She did.  Didn't you?
Arrest her, Jim.
Yeah.
I got to go home.  Thanks. Rain check?
It couldn't have come at a better time.
Sayonara.
Well, well, what a switch. You actually beat us here.
Hmm.
He's working spillover -- personal thing -- kid he knows who's in trouble.
Well, maybe we should be evaluating you.
Goody.
I'll meet you at the autopsy.  Head-topsy.
Kind of sounds like the daytime coroner.
It sucks.
Hey, I just filed for divorce. I'm feeling a little confident.
So, where's the head?
Man, look at those chopping wounds on the jawbone. 
They almost look like practice swings.
Definitely a crime of passion.
I could have.
Well, I'm out of here. I'm going to be with Brass ... see if I can get anything on those Victoria's Secret girls.
Now there's a start-- gross. Gross negligence-- flying down I-15 in a stolen car. Gross anatomy-- a human bowling ball in the trunk. Gross details-- let's hear it.
Let me guess. You left your clothes in the van.
Sure. Why not?
Silk, silk, silk.
Water. Why?
Hey ... here's something new. 
The cousin of footprints. Sock prints ... look. That's not from a shoe. Look at the fabric impressions. The guy ran out of here in his socks.
He thought wrong.
Our head.
Well, this amount of blood suggests that the victim was killed here. Why don't I do the one-to-ones and you start looking for the weapon?
Paul Bunyan.
By the way, what about my evaluation?
They're tacky. 
Hmm, positive to positive.
Tabling the ax. Hammer time.
Um ... pretty close.
Wait a minute. Maybe it wasn't about hitting him in the head. Maybe it was about fitting him in the locker.
Exactly.
We found everything else in that shed. I don't know why we didn't find a gun.
That would explain the plastic.
I didn't? Oh. 
The victim was wrapped in a plastic sheet.
Really? Who's the painter?
Yet.
Okay, let's get right to it. What's your shoe size?
Okay ... step on the paper. 
Two sizes too big. You can go.
Okay, great. Now, Mr. Applewhite ... this time, I want you to do something different. 
This time ... run.
Don't bother. There aren't any. Just like the last time. The guy's Mr. Clean. Here, knock yourself out.
I'll tell Brass to check for s*x offenders in a two-mile radius.
So, we're looking at the same guy.
What's the red stuff?
Not blood?
So, what, this guy's got some strange chemical in his mutated DNA?
Freakiest semen I've seen in a while. Call me.
Oh.
Pertaining to the case?
Well, Sheriff, I'd say let's go to my office, but I don't have one.
Fast. I'm impressed.
This one of your jokes, Greg?
I'm sure this is meaningful.
Sugar, water, salt and tomato paste. Ketchup?
Well, does he add it after or is it organic?
When we zig, he zags.
All of which I'm sure you'll share with the FBI.
Hey ... is it so bad to avail our lab to the resources of the federal government?
I've been listening to our Sheriff. He says that you won't.
Well, no. He preferred someone from night shift and it may be more than just this case.
Gil ... learn to be more politic.
When we zig, he zags.
Starting to look like deja vu all over again.
Not?
It's there or it isn't.
Staged?
I don't think he made a deposit ... either.
I just talked with Brass. He said that Walden was having an affair with a dentist in his office.
Politics ...
That may have been the problem.
Hey!
Your door was open. You okay?
Migraine. It's been a while. 
You just don't like it when you can't solve a case or command your troops.
I told the Sheriff I'd pass.
Well, if I get a promotion, I want it to be on merit ... not because you're politically tone-deaf. 
So, our guys are outside in their Tahoes. If you're a civilian, we are.
Except we are putting in for overtime.
This guy showed up on the database.
Yeah, well, don't act like it's so simple. This guy could have gone another year without being picked up. What did they get him on?
Oh.  Suspended sentence, released two days ago. Call Grissom on his cell.
He is. Dial. Tell him to meet me at this guy's work address.
You think anything illegal goes on in here?
We're with the crime lab. Heard you just copped a plea for indecent exposure.
How do you explain your DNA on the bedsheets they were murdered in?
Any recent trick offer you money for something a little weird? Say a portable sample of your DNA?
I guess we should have known if our guy was planting hairs he was planting semen.
You all right?
Nick told me.
What position? Never doubt and never look back. That's how I live my life.
Very good.
I couldn't drive here fast enough to tell you how much I love you.
Sara Sidle?
How many hit-and-runs we had this year?
My daughter wants one of these scooters. Says she's the only kid in the world who doesn't have one.
You feeling all right, Warrick?
So this is what-- your new leaf?
Hey, relax. I'll play nice. Thank you for the offer. I'm okay. I can handle this one. 
It'd be nice if this paint transfer had just one special property.
And all we've got is some paint that's going to match up to about 20 million other vehicles.
b*st*rd.
Oh, my god. Plate numbers.
Yeah.
Call DMV.
I'll meet you out front.
Hello.
Mr. Charles Moore?  We're with the Las Vegas crime lab. We'd like to talk to you about your car.
That's why we have a search warrant, sir ... 
... so that we can look in your garage.
She died at the scene.
Is it me or did he give it up too easy?
When the spirit moves you, Sara. So, in your case, I guess, never.
I hope you can return it 'cause, uh, Lindsey doesn't want a party. 
My kid.
She isn't.
What do I have to do -- put it on the bulletin board? There is no party. My daughter doesn't want a party. Is everybody clear on that?
Six feet, I'd say.
Start the car.
Just do it.
Mr. Moore was not the last person to drive this car.
Uh, turn the music off.
Yeah.
Sir, that doesn't answer our question.
Your grandson is an approved driver on your insurance. We had him pulled out of school.
Did you hit that girl with your grandfather's car?
James. You have family? Someone you can call?
We can give you a lift home.
You know that James was riding solo that night.
It's just that we've got so much power in this job which we use to get the bad guys. Once in a while, I'd like to use it to help the good guys like Mr. Moore and his grandson.
No ... what I'm saying is that ... putting James away isn't going to bring her back. Mr. Moore is willing to do the time and the victim's family gets closure.
Yeah. I know it.
Yeah. Momentary lapse.
What are you talking about?
Oh, that. Yeah.  I'm just afraid that I'm making her weird, you know?
I work 24/7. I have no time for my friends. My daughter rarely sees me having any fun. And, all of a sudden, she doesn't want a party.
Yes. I'm her mother. She mimics me.
You're just saying that to make me feel better.
It shows.
When you want evidence, you can't find it. When you don't want it, it's as big as Dallas.
Can you tell what that is?
James ... we found a tooth chip embedded in the steering wheel of your grandfather's car. It doesn't appear to be, uh, from your grandfather's teeth.
I'm very sorry, Mr. Moore. James, I'm afraid you're going to have to be taken into custody.
I know you are, Mr. Moore. We can't let you do that.
He can explain all that to court. I'll be a witness. 
We both will.
Is this more of your new leaf?
I owe you.
So, did you have a good day at school?
They did?! Well, you have got some great friends. So, Lindsey ... how come you didn't want to have a party with them?
Oh ... wow ... well, I'm really glad to be alone with you, too. I like this more than you will ever know.
Uh, maybe when you're older.  Like 40.
Whatee?
I know it's not fair. Life isn't fair.
Femur. Strongest bone in the human body -- it's sliced clean through.
Well, that's good news.
Well, do you want to be alive when your leg's being cut off?
Well, she's wearing a wedding ring.
No. No way, use your own hand.
No!
Umm ...
Ugh!
She's a floater, Wendy Barger. Thirty-four, local, Green Valley.
Already did. Talked to the husband. Never reported her missing.
At the coroner's, I.D.-ing the body.
You confirming rape?
We need to ask you a few questions.
Is there anyone that you know of that might have wanted to harm your wife?
And when was the last time you had intercourse with your wife?
It's part of our investigation, sir.
Mr. Barger ...
We're still trying to piece it all together. A sample would be helpful.
DNA doesn't match.
Let me ask you something. Would you want to know everything?
Barger as much as told us that he and his wife were having problems. She was staying at the lake. It wasn't the first time. And what do you think the chances are she was seeing somebody else?
Very good to excellent.
Anybody seen her since Tuesday?
She had something on the side. I can tell you firsthand when you don't cheat, you don't suspect.
Not a chance.
Okay. Brass, you coming?
What does that give us?
Now tell me, why are we here?
And you know this because...?
Oh. Alone?
Do you recognize this woman?
Ordered the calamari.
Well, I don't care about everyone. I care about her.
Mr. Swelco, are you all right?
And... when she didn't, you got angry?
Scared? Why?
What happened once you got here?
Do you believe him?
Is that the husband?
We're interviewing a lot of people. Most of it's follow-up.
As soon as we know, you'll know. 
You know, eventually we're going to have to tell him that his wife was having an affair with somebody he knows.
When Eddie was cheating on me I sure wish somebody would have said something.
Who else?
New pet?
Yeah, well just keep the lid on it, okay?
If you're through amusing yourself I have some news on the boat.
What do you think?
Right. We need to find the boat.
It's me. I found it. Just South of Barring Point Bridge.
I took a walk.
It's white with lime green trim. Just like the splinters we found in Wendy Barger's head wound.
I think I may have found some skin. When Wendy hit her head. Did you hear what I said?
Blood? Well, you were at the autopsy. The head trauma wasn't a bleeder.
Damn, you're good.
Mr. Barger, why don't you, um come over here with me. Just walk over ...
Have a seat.
Oh, I'm sorry.
He deserved to know the truth.
I guess you just have to be on the wrong end of an affair to understand.
We bring ourselves to our cases. We can't help it. I knew how Barger felt. Would you just relax? I didn't give him chapter and verse.
You right, you know. I should be just like you. Alone in my hermetically sealed condo watching discovery on the big screen working genius-level crossword puzzles, but no relationships. No chance any will slop over into a case. Right. I want to be just like you.
Grissom ... what personal stuff?
Okay.
What?
Why?
There's no gas. It's not gonna start.
As long as there is one.
That's it. What's your point?
It's sore.  But you already knew that. 
It was just an accident.
Well ...  ... I guess we better go talk to the husband. I mean, unless you think I'm going to compromise the integrity of the case again.
I would love to.
He had to say it.
Okay. Hey, Warrick.
We just came from your house. We wanted to tell you that your wife's death was an accident.
Hey, you want to give us our assignments or do you want us to take... the night off?
Hey,  ... you could've turned the job down.
Well let's just hurry this up.
You really want to see flash paper flash? Walk in on a bookie.
Don't answer it. 
We've got work to do ... boss.
Did some kid off him with a silver spoon?
Where is he?
You're coming with me.
Hi.
What do you got?
With that, probably.
Yeah. Blows to the head, up close and personal. A lot of passion around this one.  How about the suspect?
A rock?
How many times did you hit him?
Miss Armstrong ... were you and the Dean having a personal relationship?
Then why did you hire him? You founded the school. It's your integrity on the line.
But you hit him more than once.
Well, you hit a man once, there's no blood. The first hit's free. You hit him more than that ...  The walls in his office look like the Dean went a couple rounds with Mike Tyson.
Will you excuse me? Officer. Thanks.
Heavy on B.S., zippo on truth.
Hell, no. I'm stoked.  We drew the best case, Nicky. I can feel it.
String it.
Wow. 
Now, there's a look I like to see-- confusion.
Cast-off from the weapon against the window.
The back wall ... void... against the back wall. 
The floor under the body?
There's an interruption -- a space where something or someone comes between the blood coming off the body and the wall.
Kate Armstrong is lying.
The blood evidence is telling us otherwise.
And when you were playing witness where were you standing?
You're sure?
Nick reenacted the crime using blood spatter.
Sure.
Okay, so this is what we've got so far on our dead dean. Blood spatter and blood cast-off on the walls. Kate Armstrong's confession, her clothes. Three void areas, and that's pretty much it. Anything else?
That's it.
The one thing we're missing.
On Julia's clothes.
We need the clothes that you were wearing the day that The Dean was killed.
Why?
Blood's funny that way. In fact, I bet there's lots of blood on Dean Woods' shirt.
Look at that void. What a beaut.
Talk about your unique attributes. What do you think -- a bandage?
Julia, make a fist for me with your right hand. I mean, count it down like so, starting with your thumb first. Five, four, three, two, one.
Dean woods' shirt.
Now, remember we said blood tells us everything? Well ... so does the absence of blood.
All because the guy was handsy? Seems a little severe.
No, no, this isn't over.
We still don't know why.
Hey, Nick.
Grissom's not always right. Do yourself a favor and think for yourself. I mean that as a friend, okay? Okay, detective, we got some more homework to do.
Mm-hmm.
Great.
$5,000. Another for $5,000. $3,000. Memo: Loans. I don't think so. I think she was paying him off for something.
This is where Gris and I differ. Forensics is about more than science. Human behavior. The inconsistencies of human behavior. Yes, how is crucially important, but so is why.
Bigger why: Why did it have to come down to this?
Maybe they didn't.
A lose-lose situation.
So, what do you have for me? I could use a rush.
Because?
Because I used to be one, I'll be biased?
Just let me do the prelim.
Eddie.
According to the police report she's telling a different story. I wonder what the rape kit's going to say.
In the parking lot behind the club.
Melanie know about this?
You might want to call her anyway. She can loan you the money for an attorney.
A detective from s*x crimes has been assigned. I'm going to place another CSI.
What about her?
Hotlines ... hit or miss.
So I saw Eddie. He actually... seemed scared.
Um ... no. I'm not really sure what I ... feel.
Hi. 
Evans, I'm sorry I'm late. I'm Catherine ...  ... just Catherine. I'm a forensic scientist.
Thanks.
Yeah. 
Those bruises from last night?
Sexual assault nurse collect a kit yet?
Why don't you see if you can catch her. I'd like her to get a sample from under her fingernails.
Anything that might, show up from a ... a struggle.
Okay. I didn't hand it off.
I'm sorry, Warrick.
I know. 
I'm sorry. 
I'm doing this for Lindsey.
Eyes, no hands.
Skin samples from under the woman's fingernails are consistent with Ed's. I saw some bruises but Eddie's style has always been very ... involved ... vigorous.
Thank you, Warrick. Eddie said that she was into it.
Eddie.
What are you doing here?
You could be a detective. Thank you.
Well, you obviously made bail. Did you get a lawyer?
It wasn't all bad.
Well, let me give it a try. 
Excuse me, sir. 
Can we see your permits?
Okay, Ted.
I'm okay.
Can't seem to get off the night shift. 
If you want to call that dressed. Yeah, Evans. Hey, Ted, you heard about this thing with Eddie and April?
You mind if I look around?
Thanks, Ted.
So, Greg, what did the rape kit say?
Glycerin?
It's a contraceptive film. 
May I?
Thank you.
That's right.
Really?
Uh-huh.
Oh, I doubt it.
You would have remembered. 
So, this film-- it's kind of hard to detect because it dissolves with body heat. And, as you know, Greg, s*x can make a body pretty hot.
Which means that April inserted the film while she was still at work.
Like what -- marriage, kids?
And for that you set him up for rape?
Wait a minute. You think that Eddie's got money?
He reps some bands off-strip.
Nothing.
Morning. 
Please don't tell me that you're in trouble again already.
You're welcome. 
I don't think that's such a good idea, though.
What's to talk about? You cheated on me. I caught you. I've got a new life.
You got it.
I got the blood samples on the way to the lab.
You mean the blood swirls next to the father's body in the boys' room? 
I studied pictures of the Manson Murders. This isn't butter. It's imitation. 
What's your take?
Explains why the blood is confined to the bed and the floor under it.
Gave his life for the little girl. There should be more blood.
The first suspect.
Well, she'd need help. Maybe a boyfriend?
Linds.
Linds? Lindsey? 
Lindsey ... Lindsey.
Hi, honey!
Oh, am I glad to see you.
I know. I was just there. Your teacher told me daddy came to pick you up. Oh, you feel so good. 
Ed ... I'm working this quadruple. Time got away from me. I apologize.
Right.
Yeah. Thank you. I really, really ...
Yeah. 
Oh, god.
Yeah.
What?
You made pancakes?
For dinner?
That would be Grissom.
Ed.
Okay, I'll be right there. Just let me put on some clean clothes.
Eddie ...
She always does.
We're about to go ask her. Nick, what did you find out about that stuff that you collected at the back of the house?
But your statement says that you bent down and hugged your mother who was bleeding profusely. Then you ran out, tripping over your father's body in the upstairs hallway.
It's a little too late to start coaching her now.
The doctor says it's from trauma. What happened, Tina? Did you catch your boyfriend killing your family?
That they killed the family so they could be together?
Notes on mapping: Collins family murder. Case #00-398. Intruder killed mother. 
Father went to protect the little girl. Got nicked by knife. 
Killer subdued him as dad was entering the little girl's room to ... 
... save her. 
Grissom.
Who's asking?
You know, your department can't seem to get things straight. If you're looking for the little girl, she's already got a caseworker.
My Lindsey? Why? What are you talking about?
Is this Eddie's idea of a joke? What, are you in one of his bands?
It's me. Something's off on the map.
Uh ... I'm looking at dad's blood in the hall. I found an interesting drop. The droplet tells me that he wasn't running to the little girl's room. 
Yeah. 
I filled one of your holes, Grissom. 
The father was killed first -- then the mother. 
And the blood that we found in the hallway was from the knife.
Night, guys.
Tony Candlewell, age 30. Communications Company Manager from Atlanta, married ... no record.
I don't know but this sure must have looked scary at thirty thousand feet.
I'll start the interviews.
Sir, we realize this is an imposition, and we apologize for it. Nobody wants to see you on your way more than we do. We'll make this as quick and painless as we possibly can.
More flies with honey.
And he wouldn't let you?
Are you telling me this guy was kicking the back of your seat the entire flight?
May I see your hands?
And did you give him anything?
And, as far as you know did he complain of a headache when he boarded?
So what made the worm turn?
Right. Well, thanks for your time.
Nada. You?
I'm going to go out on a limb here ... and say ... they're hiding something?
And where were you when this was all going on, Mrs. Finn?
In the bathroom? For how long?
So, you ... slept through everything and you woke up next to a ... dead body.
All right, we're going to have to change tack here because what I said about getting more flies with honey -- I was wrong.
Why you telling me?
Well, why don't you tell them that? They're not giving me bupkus.
Shoes ... off. 
Now.
Hi.
Oh. Excellent.
That looks good.
Well, that's it then.
Okay, folks. I've got some good news ... and I've got some bad news.
Well, the good news would be that seven of you may be ... getting out of here very soon.
The bad news is that three of you may be staying in Vegas a lot longer than you planned. And that would be ... Mr. Lou Everett, Mr. Max Valdez ... and Dr. Kiera Behrle. Would you ... please come with me.
Dr. Behrle, we're going to be asking you some very sensitive questions -- questions that I know that I wouldn't want my daughter to hear.
How did you get that black eye?
Okay. 
I'm, uh ... just a little confused. Your heel impressions were found on the back of the victim's suede jacket. 
That's a little aggressive for a Good Samaritan.
And you're satisfied with that?
But you are trained to use the paddles in the event of an emergency and this was an emergency situation.
So, whatever it was he was going through it didn't look a heart attack.
All right, so let me get this straight. 2F is on the floor. His wife is in the aisle brandishing a broken wine bottle. What about 1A? He was closest to the action.
If you ask me, it's their spouses that are the dummies.
So is mine. These passengers are lying.
Lou -- the angry businessman. How about that?
Single mom. What an imagination you have.
What time was that?
Very good.
And my shoes end up on his back.
That's probably how the doctor got her black eye.
And, at this point we're not individuals anymore -- we're a mob.
And you can't perform CPR on a man's back. Dr. Behrle had to have rolled him over ... 
... probably just to cover for herself.
Well ... it's wicked serious in here.
All the way.
That's right. If it involves the protection of my child I fight to the death.
That's a cop-out. It's a simple question. What would you have done if you had been one of those passengers?
He was a threat.
Have you been inside?
What have you got?
Yeah, join the club.
Good morning, Gil. So, this is Tony Braun's house. Son of Sam Braun.
Oh, yeah, you bet your ass.  Sam came to Vegas when Vegas was dying. Built three casinos in a year. Had ties to Bugsy Siegel.
Chasing the dragon. A pinch of H. Heat the foil. Inhale the fumes.
It sure seems that way.
Well, I'll tell you one thing -- if those were my dogs, I wouldn't be leaving this gate open.
Gardener said it was the first time in five years that he'd found this gate unlocked.
Last morning of Tony Braun's life? Well, either somebody inside the house opened it, or somebody had a key because this lock hasn't been forced. There's no pry marks. No metal shavings.
Who's this?
And, uh, where has she been the past 12 hours?
Right now, your house is our crime scene ... and we can do whatever we want and that includes fingerprinting you.
Thumb to pinkie.
Of course you are.
Yeah. Is Sam Braun in?
Would you let him know that Catherine Willows is here to see him?
Yeah, well, that was a long time ago.
I know, but you were married and I was a baby. It would've never worked. Sam ... how are you holding up?
: Yeah ... sounds like Tony.
Sam ... the bigger the pedestal the bigger the target.
Well, that's business. What about personal?
Did you ever talk to Tony about any of his girlfriends?
Janine Haywood.
Yeah, I do.
Okay, on the left, Braun prints we got from the coroner and on the right, gold digger prints I got from Janine Haywood.
And?
Good thing or ... bad thing?
I thought he inhaled it.
He ate it? 
Well, Braun was a heroin addict using heavy just before he died which means he was probably meek as a lamb.
And make him drink hemlock. It's a lot easier to pour liquid down a guy's throat than it is to make him swallow a hundred pills.
Not lately. We found fifty Xanax in Tony's stomach.
I'll tell you what you left -- your fingerprints all over the prescription bottle.
Oh, mind the dummy.
I figured. So why'd I bring the dummy?
Braun's shirt.
Is this part of the Sherlock Holmes Fan Club Kit?
So Braun would have been on his third or fourth balloon by then.
But when you're doing drugs, you're a slob; and when you're being manhandled, you're even sloppier. Like this.
He was burked.
Maybe Janine had a helper.
That's a lot of motive.
Yep. Braun family. Long arms.
I thought you said that Ritten's wife lives in Carson City.
Or digging up silver.
Mrs. Ritten?
Criminalistics.
I don't have to ask you that question.
He's Tony Braun's brother. He's a pit boss at the Tangiers which is why his prints were on file -- gaming card.
Go figure. The more evidence that shows up the more this case doesn't make sense. We got two suspects in custody and neither of their prints are on the duct tape.
Mm-hmm.
It's been done. They're not Walt Braun's prints on the tape. Came back unknown.
Flimsy alibis don't prove murder. What else have we got?
Without Curt's prints on it.
Been there.
What've we got?
Now, Jim, that's just a little callous.
He is?
So, wait a second -- Janine, the stripper claims that half of everything is hers so that's actually more than just wishful thinking?
I just got the references off of Walt Braun gave the samples to Greg.
We got to test it against Janine.
Mm-hmm.
Are you finished? Open your mouth. 
What about the maid?
Wow. You got this whole thing down don't you?
The earring back was lost that day.
So, I guess rule number one was broken. There was a woman in the house.
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?
She lives in Carson City.
She has access to Curt's truck.
Hell hath no fury ... 
If you don't wear earrings for a while the holes will close up.
You should've let your husband rot in jail. 
We lifted your thumbprint from the check that you posted for his bail.
Just like a pair of earrings-- identical.
What I don't get is ... you and Walt Braun didn't move in the same circles. How'd the two of you hook up?
It's not your fault.
It's human nature. We can't deny our feelings.
Hey, Sam ... you still got me.
Well, considering I was six months old when you guys lit the flame ... a lot of time has passed. You had plenty of chances.
Sorry.
I don't doubt that for a minute.
You're roach racing
Ah.
What do you feed those guys?
And who's ... supervising night shift?
Me? I am on the red-eye to Reno. The Braun Family is opening a new casino. I am Sam's date.
I told you once, memo'd you twice.
Better get somebody.
Do you think you're the only friend I've got in the police department? I'm just telling you, be careful.
Hey, look, we all get a little crazy when our kids are involved.
Okay. Hey, but listen. If you find the boyfriend, don't go it alone.
Mmm.
All yours, girl.
Oh, Nick, give it up. We got a death imminent to worry about.
Hand me that magnifier.  Thank you.
See those white specks? 
No, I don't think so.
Never you mind. 
Let's just get this to trace.
I gave this to trace. Why do you have 
This is skin.
Dandruff.
Had a bad case of seborrhea.
Thanks.
As long as you don't tell her it's a date.
House mogul caught with his pants on? Yeah, I'm just rolling to the hospital to get his clothes. Why?
You serious? For what?
Wow!
Let me know.
His property is part of our investigation. I'm afraid I have to take it.
Yeah, me, too. Did you work for the Fairmonts three years ago, when Mr. Fairmont was shot?
Interesting. 
You have dandruff.
It is when I'm on a case. Do you mind?
But you did redress him and place him in the elevator.
Well, that's dangerous to say to a scientist. 
Dandruff is nothing more than sloughed-off skin. It has a nucleus just like a cell on your arm or your big toe. 
These 13 DNA markers from this dandruff cell are a match to the dandruff that I recovered from your sweater. You were there. At that hotel.
Let me guess -- you snuck out down the stairwell.
Well, we won't mind if we compare your DNA to the vaginal contribution of a condom that we recovered from Mr. Fairmont's room?
Good. We'd like to show you something else -- about that accidental shooting three years ago at your boss' house.
We're thinking it was you.
Where was his wife?
So, you just sat there in the dark and aimed south of his belt.
Or both.
We just interviewed her. She copped to moving him. We're looking hard at the wife on the poisoning.
We know. Dermatomycoses seborrhea -- we got it.
She could be back from dinner at any moment. This shouldn't take long.
Shampoo full of the same poison found in Bob Fairmont's remains?
Cream cheese.
Garlic cream cheese ...
It explains away his bad breath.
We'll see.
This is yours ... and these are yours.  There's the door. We build a case before we make any arrests.
Hey, what's going on? We called the hospital. She's been released.
A dairy farm. 
Gideon Dairy and Cheese. Largest supplier of milk in Connecticut, in fact. Brass talked to a local chamber-of-commerce type about Claudia's husband. You want to know who his secretary was?
And you loved your husband Right up to the day he died ... of 240 milligrams of selenium.
Bravo. Ladies. You have got this down to a science.  Why did it happen the first time? Hubby ignored you or abused you or you got sick of him fooling around so you started slipping the ... 
... cow stuff into his chocolate milk? Julia must have caught you.
So the two of you struck a deal.
But the difference is that you actually loved Bob Fairmont. 
You shot him because he was cheating but that didn't get in the way of your long-term goals, did it?
It's down the hall to your right.
Well, no big surprise. We have proof of poison but no way to prove which one of them did it.
She-said/she-said defense? It's never going to fly. They'll raise each other as a viable suspect just like they did with us.
See you back at CSI.
He bled out.
So he died approximately ten hours ago.
Thanks, David. Okay, let's see who you are ... 
Nevada license.
James Jasper.
Well, you were right -- he should've been wearing his orange safety vest.
Hunter lays in wait, spots a deer. Hunter fires ...
... deer takes off ... but the bullet keeps going until it stops. 
It's got to be somewhere.
You find the bullet?
You know what the textbook says -- if you're not a hundred percent sure how to collect it, bring the whole thing in.
Nick.
Tell me what you got?
Trajectory?
And how was your husband handling that?
Mrs. Jasper, was your husband an experienced hunter?
You were?
That's cottonwood.
I did.
Ah, oxidation.
Well, we've got the wrong bullet but the case still seems like a write-off.
She bought it?
He's in the insurance business and she buys a policy behind his back.
Okay, the tree is a point of reference.
So the bullet should be somewhere between your rope and mine.
Congratulations to us. Still a needle in a haystack.
Nick.
Let's just pack it up. The bullet couldn't have gone this far.
Yeah, just tying up a few loose ends.
We haven't heard a single shot all day. Where are these hunters that you talked about?
No one hunts during the day but the coroner placed Jasper's time of death at 2:00 P.M.
Expect the unexpected. GSR on the clothing means the victim was shot at close range.
Or suicide.
Okay. But if he was murdered, we should've found some evidence of the killer at the crime scene.
All right.
She didn't kill her husband.
A pro would've shot him in the heart.
Right. But he never moved. He was standing in front of this tree when he was shot. He didn't try to get to his car, get help, he just ... sat down and waited to die.
Ninety-nine out of 100 suicides by gun ... muzzle to the mouth, bullet to the brain. But there's always just that one.
No, the weapon we found was never fired.
He shoots himself in the gut leaving himself time to hide the weapon.
How about the lake?
Hey.
Metal on metal.
Okay. Right there.
Well, we never found the bullet, but we found the gun.
Mr. Jasper committed suicide.
Mrs. Jasper, you purchased a life insurance policy on your husband in which you are the sole beneficiary.
We have the actual application for the policy with your signature.
Your husband staged his death to look like a homicide. As a beneficiary, if you knew of his intentions to take his own life, that would constitute fraud.
Hi.
You want to explain this?
Because he knew that if he had bought the insurance himself it would've sent up a red flag.
Long drive.
Anything else?
Pete Walker, California. Date of birth: August 17, 1957. It's got to be the work of Paul Millander. What do you think brought him back out?
Hasn't changed his M.O .-- Kills men whose birthdays are on the anniversary of his father's murder.
Ready for this?
Isn't your birthday in August?
Plan of attack -- split up. Nick, take the tape over to A-V. Break it down. Warrick, Sara -- examine the perimeter. We need to know how he got in and got out. We'll stay with the body.
Anytime.
He's got stippling on the side of his face. 
No entry wounds near his face.
Wait ... wait a minute. I got something.
Hello, Dolly. Dark hair, 12 inches. Female?
Well, the vic had light brown hair so we know it's not his.
So, back to that again. Another victim, or an accomplice?
What do you mean?
So Millander planted an aged hair? But once exposed, the tag would dry up and fall off, especially in transport.
Okay, so what's he trying to tell us? That he used to kill women?
Grounds?
Nevada state patrol found the victim's vehicle here. Found the body in good springs here.
And what time was sunrise this morning?
So in that time he had to get the recording and get rid of the body.
Are we sure he didn't kill him in the car? He was shot in the warehouse. He was incapacitated in the car.
Grissom, you want to add something to this?
Employment -- Dinners Delivered. Need a car for that.
Try Stuart Rampler.
Besides birth dates.
You mean court dates for speeding tickets?
Always the same judge?
Gil.
Any chance he's got a twin?
Why, you getting a cold?
Ah, fuming.  I'll lift it and get it to the lab.
You're never going to believe who Judge Mason's fingerprints match. Judge Mason. As printed when he was sworn before the bar Nevada State Superior Court.
Yeah, we know that. How do we prove it?
Well, that's the first thing Brass looked into. Apparently, the records building burned down in 1982.
Ruled arson. No suspects ever found.
Here's some good news. Brass went to the new records building looking for anything on a Millander. Found current property-tax accounts.
Mm-hmm.
Isabelle Millander? 
It's our understanding that your child witnessed your husband's murder.
Thank you.
I hope we're not interrupting. It looks as if you're expecting someone for dinner.
May I use your bathroom?
Thank you.
Oh ... I have a daughter myself. I was admiring the old clothes. 
She's beautiful.
I'm sorry. 
Mrs. Millander we're just trying to clarify ...
So, Paul Millander killed his sister.
It's a kid's fingerprint from the baseball card.
Brass found no prints from little Pauline no birth records, no death certificate. I'm going to use the prints from the only other kid who lived in the Millander house.
Ridge analysis proof. Judge Mason is ... 
So her brother planted it?
Millander. It's a female hair.
You know, when I was back at the house I saw several photographs of Pauline and nothing of Paul. In fact, the only proof of Paul is a hidden baseball card.
Oh, this is just ridiculous. I mean, you'd think they'd make an exception in this case -- three murders. This guy's telling me that Millander is representing himself. Pro pers are always last on the docket.
You going home?
I re-read the backgrounds of Millander's victims. I think that he slipped up. You know how every victim read the suicide note I'd like to say 'I love you' to my mother? Well, Pete Walker had no mother.  She died in childbirth.
So how rich is this guy?
Who doesn't?
And he hasn't said a word to anyone?
Mr. Logan ... would you please put your hands out? Palms up.
I'm also going to need you to strip.
Thank you, Mr. Logan. You can put your shirt down. Left arm out, please. 
Right arm. 
No visible injuries.
Didn't Shakespeare say let's kill all the lawyers?
Yeah. Hey, can you do me a favor and drop this off at the lab? I'm due at a nursery rhyme recital. Lindsey's going to play the girl in the moon.
He got the mumps.
Mr. Logan!
You forgot your sunglasses.
Service-oriented policing.
What? 
Hello
CSI three Willows. Who are you?
Criminalist.
Who would be dead?
Yes.
Who is this?
Let's talk in the car.
You never answered my question. Who's Amanda?
Somebody does. How did they make contact?
Got your attention. 
Yeah, I heard that part. I need a drink.
We don't know how long it's going to be before he calls. Why don't you order something?
I have the phone. Do us both a favor: Relax.
Um, two glasses: One with ice; one without. Roy?
So, let's get to know each other. You first. 
You were born; you came home from the hospital. Then what?
Give me the finger.
I got to preserve this evidence.
Hello.
Let's go.
Open the briefcase. I've got an idea. 
I use this to paint my daughter's face. She was playing the moon tonight in the school play. I missed it. Mark the edges of the money. 
Do you got any kids?
One more mile.
Sorry, it's been a while since I've driven a sports car. 
Thanks.
First we need to see Amanda.
No. We need something more than just your word.
He had a shot gun. If all he wanted was the money, we'd both be dead.
Give me the phone.
We're past that. Give me the phone!
Well... according to the map she should be somewhere around here.
Why don't you give me a hand?
There was a kidnapping.
You got my clues?
I bet she loved that.
I owe you. Thank you.
You're assuming it was a he. Rabbit mask. Full-beam headlights. Truman Capote voice. Who can tell gender?
Bloody nose, ecchymosis. She took a beating. Cause of death?
I'm going to head over to the townhouse check out those blood spots with Nick.
Mr. Logan?
I wouldn't advise that.
You've got to give us time. Why don't you go home, get some sleep?
This town is full of hotels.
Marble.
Kidnapper probably broke in. She made a run for it. Got hit in the face. Went down.
And you know this from ... ?
So, how did the killer get the body out of the house?
Bedsheets?
Plastic, maybe. If she was murdered here her finger was severed here where are the knives?
Clever. Kidnapper washed all the knives.
Get those glasses to Greg.
He wrapped her in it.
Greg got saliva off the wine glasses. Ran the DNA. One was Amanda, and the other a woman.
Or fight about.
Mrs. Logan, do you know Amanda Freeman? Because she called you on your cell phone the day she was murdered.
We could compel a DNA sample which would confirm that you had a glass of wine with her that night.
You tore down the shower curtain wrapped the body in it.
You transported the body to the reservoir in the back of your SUV where some of your son's PB and J made it onto the shower curtain.
One more thing. Mrs. Logan, can you hold your hands out palms up? Jim, can you hit the lights?
You killed Amanda Freeman.
Your client?
What are you saying? That Mr. Logan paid you to dress up as a bunny rabbit?
So, basically, this was a stage play written by Mr. Logan.
I'll drive.
Mr. Logan? Open the door. Please.
Fat chance. Son of a bitch. He had me completely fooled.
I bet that locker's empty, too.
Amanda broke the only rule. Don't call the missus.
Everything from that point on was calculated. 
Blood on his hands ... 
... he's the last customer of the day at the bank Acting suspiciously ...
... driving recklessly.
You bet your ass. He didn't leave those sunglasses behind by accident. His cell phone rang on cue. The call's for me.
He practically forced that money into his lawyer's hands.
Sure, we wanted us to suspect the wife. That's why he used her SUV 
to transport the body. 
And he let me mark the money because he knew that eventually his lawyer would touch it.
So I did everything in my power to help him.
Willows.  Yeah.
Bravo. 
That's right. You're short one mistress. I got to hand it to you that was a brilliant performance. But then again, any man who juggles a wife and mistress and god knows what else has to be a pro.
Try explaining that to your son.
Body Farm; creepy.
Tell that to Slim hanging from the tree.
Can't just slip a card into the deck.
Well, look. One of your friends.
Vic seem more like a hardwood floors kind of guy to you?
Yeah.
Quiet.
Bugs or blood?
I gave the prints to identification. They're running through the bases now.
Oh, it's not a John Doe anymore. Database says that our victim is Mike Kimble age 38. He has a townhouse in Summerlin. Brass is going to meet us there along with the rest of the unit. My bet says that it's the primary crime scene.
Aren't you coming?
Sounds fascinating.
Is that Mike Kimble's house?
Seems like somebody beat us here.
Where's his neighbor now?
You and Mike were engaged?
Would you mind showing us your hands?
To see if there's any gun powder or evidence of a burn on them.
We have evidence that Mike may have had an inappropriate relationship with your daughter.
Things like this happen sometimes right under our noses. We're going to have to talk with your daughter.
Jody, we found pictures in Mike's house of you posing. 
In some of the pictures ... 
In some of the pictures you're wearing a bathing suit. Do you remember Mike taking them?
Jody ... anything that he did to you was not your fault. You can tell me if Mike took those pictures.
The daughter clammed up. Seems to be in the protect-the-abuser trap. I'm going to take her over to the hospital for a SART exam. 
I've seen it happen. As a mother, I hope not.
Sara's not going to be too happy with that experiment in the fridge. 
The doctor finished the exam on Jody Bradley. Physical findings: Scarring, chronic sexual abuse. 
Listen, there's a good chance the daughter's our arsonist. She had second-degree burns on her wrist.
Right. You coming with?
Right. Experiment.
That's the girl's nightgown.
Child Services will be remanding Jody to a foster home.
Jim?
Convenient timing.
It wasn't that you 'sensed' what was going on?
I'll believe the DNA.
So, whose is it, the father? 
Voluntary man, first offense. Out on bail. Free in four. No jury was going to convict a father for killing his daughter's abuser. What do you have?
Looks as if Jody was probably telling the truth. She did burn herself on a curling iron.
Jody? We know that Mike gave you his camera. We suspect that your father used it to take pictures of you on his boat. 
We believe that he then placed the camera back at Mike's to implicate him along with the pictures.
Did you ever tell your mom?
Jody, we have strong forensic evidence against your father. But cases like this are very difficult to prove. A victim testifying makes all the difference.
Jody, if you don't talk ...
What is this?
Yeah, 12.
Excuse me. Could I talk to you for a moment?
I owe you an apology. I have an eight-year-old daughter.
Just give me a straight-ahead murder any day.
I heard about you and ... uh ... Sara.
Are you in denial? No, that's ... no, no ... way too analytical. Wow, you got burned bad, huh? Welcome to the club. I got third-degree burns from my marriage. Happens to everybody. Everybody just moves on.
But you have to deal with it. You have to deal with it first. You got to deal with it before it goes away. You are the supervisor. You have responsibilities, and people are making a family around you whether you like it not, whether you give them permission or not. We don't have to go to the Grand Tetons together, just ... every now and then you got to lift your head up out of that microscope.
Well, I guess is must be from the third period. Looks like that other team worked him over pretty good.
So, why did you move the body?
Then Mr. Rivers was still breathing?
Did you also do the stitch work?
So, if he'd listened, he'd still be alive.
What do these guys play for? A little money? Imitation Stanley Cup?
And the joy of kicking ass. You are...?
Is that how you lost the, uh...? The sit spin? 
Which means?
That why your guy ended up dead?
Usually does.
What'd you get from area 51?
Every fire needs a match. So, I guess this is their equipment?
Okay.
Okay.
Ms. Gallagher?
Catherine Willows Crime Lab. I understand you play for area 51. Did you see much ice time during the game?
You know what? Been there, done that. Just asking a question here.
Oh ... you've got good peripheral vision. You see the ice really well.
You're a real teammate. Down the line, just one of the guys.
Any reason why?
Nice bike.
So, this is what being a stockbroker buys you.
How do men live like this?
Well, it's a cave with hardwood floors.
Well, how about a plant? Anything to makes it a little more ... human. I mean, it doesn't seem like this guy had any ... connection to anybody.
It's never a good sign when the number of women a guy sleeps with is more than the number of chairs he owns.
Well, uh, ballparking it, I'd say ... four women to every one piece of furniture he owns including the TV.
So... I guess our guy is about three things - pucks, bucks, and ... chicks.
Well, we know how he lived.
Yeah, I saw ten of them.
You got a match. To what?
So, what you're saying is whoever was in Jane Gallagher's bed was on the ice the night Terry Rivers died. 
So we just double-checked the search warrant returned from Terry Rivers apartment. There was no quinine found in the location. He never had a prescription for quinine.
Do you have his medical file?
Let me see it.
Somebody did. You can withhold medical information from your friends all you want but it's still going to be in your hospital record.
Aren't you on duty?
Hey.
Okay. How are you.
Whew. Attitude adjustment?
Ah. How is Mrs. Tadero?
Oh.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah?
Well ... I had a good teacher.
So, did you see it? The confession? 
And what do you think?
What if Kelso didn't kill Stephanie?
What if he didn't? I mean ...
Well ... maybe I'm just afraid that if I accept that he killed her that it's over, and Stephanie's really dead. 
I ... I don't know.
The evidence.
The statute says that once the convicted party is executed or dies, the evidence can be destroyed. I-it's not here.
Yeah, well, people make mistakes.
Yeah. Fifteen ...
Yeah. 
Yeah, that's it. 
This was my old life.
Stephanie was my best friend.
I got a gig. I promised him I'd be there. Forgive me?
I never saw her again.
Peace of mind that they got the killer.
Thank you, Greg. Thank you.
I'm taking this to Trace.
You see that?
Fifteen years ago, we figured, why light up something you can't analyze in the first place?
Priority.
Wow.
Found a third donor on the knife. Blood's from a male. Unknown.
Then you know why we're looking at the file.
Hey.
It is in the evidence log.
Jimmy Tadero. Booked two days after the murder. So why no photos?
He's my mentor. If he screwed up, I don't think he's going to want an audience.
Oh, uh ...
Some things do.
You were always nice to me, Ted.
Jimmy changed my life. And no funny stuff, just mentor and pupil. Guy delivered me into a whole new life.
Hey! Jimmy! What's the case of the week?
Mm-hmm?
Guy's spying on his ex. Has a heart attack when he sees her doing the nasty with the pool man.
Just my woman's intuition.
Yeah.
Wish I didn't know. You up for this?
This is where Stephanie was found.
Over there is where the beat cop grabbed Kelso as he was running out into the alley.
Now, do you remember where you found Kelso's bloody glove?
And then you logged it into evidence? No sketches, no photos. Just brought it in two days after the murder.
Arresting Officer never saw a glove, according to the file.
You always used to say if something doesn't feel right, it probably isn't.
Jimmy, you're not hiding anything, are you? You didn't try to make things fit ... ?
I got your beep. Did you run those tests?
From where he cut himself stabbing her?
Kelso's saliva?
Well, blood mixed with saliva sounds like a mouth injury.
Did you check the blood that Ecklie collected from the murder weapon?
Well, how did blood from Kelso's mouth end up on the glove as well as the knife?
Unless it was planted.
Jimmy. You set him up.
You don't know that.
Guys like Kelso brag all the time about things they didn't do, cat-and-mouse ... 
Good evidence doesn't need help. You taught me that one. I'm going to have to ask you for a sample of your blood.
New technology. We isolated male blood on the murder weapon. It doesn't belong to Kelso.
You were in love with her, Jimmy. That was no secret. But the ring was. 
Three karats and she turned you down. Same week she died. I never thought anything of it till now.
I'll get a warrant.
There was a shooting one night in the club and Jimmy pulls out his revolver and takes down the bad guy. The guy's on the floor, dying. Even though this was fifteen years ago, we still knew about aids. Jimmy then puts his gun away, he leans down -- he starts giving this guy mouth-to-mouth after having just shot him. 
Forget his own life, he's going to bring this guy back. And he did. 
You've been excluded on the murder weapon.
Yeah, I compared it to Ted. I compared it to every male in CODIS. There were no hits, nowhere. Have a seat, Jimmy.
Yeah, you were.
You know now what. 
You put a man away for life on planted evidence, Jimmy.
Scumbag or saint, what you did is a capital crime. You can't play with evidence, especially in a murder.
What do you want me to do? What do you want me to do? Do you want me to look the other way? Do you want me to dummy my report?
I earned my career and you did this to yourself. You fabricated evidence, Jimmy.
... because you sold the one thing a cop can't afford to sell: Your integrity. So you tell me, between the two of us who's the whore?
Arrest him.
You can hate me all you want. I'm going to see you through this.
It's still a rescue operation.
Got here quick. That should tell you something.
Parolee-At-Large.
And already over state lines.
I'm sure it was.
Fire department says the driver of the Camaro's dead.
Now that is a serious blowout. And the front left tire's still intact.
Not anymore.
Driver tried to maintain control. Veered to the left.
Putting pressure on the right front tire causing it to blow. The ... the bus then veers to the right and goes off the road.
I'm going to go see what's going on with that Camaro.
We're going to get you out of here, okay?. Rescue!
Can you tell me your name?
He's one of the victims in the bus crash. He was in the Camaro. He was driving the Camaro.
Excuse me. 
Catherine Willows with the Las Vegas Crime Lab. This will just take a second. Can you tell me your name?
Eric?
Eric Kevlin, 32. He was a resident at the UCLA Med Center. He was on his way to Vegas to surprise his girlfriend.
But he's rescued. Given a second chance on life. and, uh ... he signs this.
It's a pre-op DNR.
Hey, Nick. We making any progress?
We checked Kevlin's property at the hospital. There's no wallet. 
Literally.
Yeah, that's him.
Nice-looking girl.
He said he wanted to surprise you.
Is there any reason why Eric, in a medical crisis would refuse resuscitation?
Chloroform in the tire?
23 passengers, plus the driver.
Whoever tampered with that tire was playing Russian roulette with people's lives.
Right. You look hard enough everybody's got a skeleton.
Tracey Logan? Seat 8-B? Her boyfriend was Eric Kevlin, the camaro driver. He was a doctor. He followed her from L.A. They had an argument in Barstow. 
Wait a minute. Eric Kevlin was a nervous boyfriend. He wasn't a criminal.
I'll check for residue.
Listen I scanned Eric Kevlin's car and clothing with an ion detector. There was no chloroform. He was clean.
Any chance he was in Barstow yesterday?
There were security cameras behind the counter but none of them were pointed out here.
Forget about getting a usable print off that airhose.
Your prints were on the bus.
Front right wheel hub.
Uh ... Mr. Nolan, have you handled any chloroform lately?
You mind?
Would you turn around, please?
So, you figured, I'll just blow a couple of his tires.
Well, I'd hate to be a juror on a case like this.
Reckless disregard for safety and human life mitigated by bad bolts.
Reading my mind.
It's definitely not blood. Wrong color, texture.
It's hair dye.
Who called it in?
There's no sign of forced entry. The bathroom window's nailed shut.
Dog bed, dog bowl, dog food ... no dog.
Triple locks on all the doors. Every shade drawn. State-of-the-art alarm system. As far as we know her place was perfectly hermetically sealed until the cops batter-rammed their way in.
So, how did he get in?
Keeps the sunlight out. GRISSOM: Keeps the eyeballs out, too.
No. I got it.
Tweeze me. Thank you.
So, what do you think?
No, I've seen them this thick.
Yeah.
Oh, and don't forget what's under the bed.
Something that you would have caught eventually ... Crime Stopper ...
No. You know, now that you're a celebrity, you may want to think about getting a new shirt.
What are you looking at me for?
So, he murders her, poses her, yet he doesn't rob her or rape her.
Blood doesn't match our victim. The girlfriend of a Ricco Manzo filed the police report last night. It seems that Adam here put Ricco in the hospital with a broken nose from a fight at bar 9-1-1.
What about Jane's work history?
Medical records?
It's as if she's trying to make herself disappear.
And her boyfriend had an alibi?
Inside her house.
Hello?
Why?
Where are you?
Uh, Gil, there's a, uh ...
Right.
Then why kill her? And why ... leave all this stuff behind?
Interesting collection of toys.
Digital camera ... with a fiber-optic lens.
Digital recorder.
I'm guessing he's got microphones all over the house.
Same question -- how did he get in?
Thank you.
So. Who do we let into our homes every day?
So, we go through her bills and we see which utility companies worked on her house.
You know, Nick was alone. The Stalker could have killed him and didn't.
Not a stick of furniture ... except for a computer and a chair.
What the hell?!
Well ... you're going to love this.
Yup. Now what?
Well. Just think, this is only tape one.
Epic.
Archie, freeze it.
Do you see that behind him? To the left hand of the screen? Can you focus the pixels?
That's the Crime Stopper article.
Do you think he knows Nick?
Well, we should get back to the lab.
Ex-chief of detectives. Left to make the big bucks. Consultant with security at every major casino in town and couldn't even protect himself.
And what about the rest of his family?
What about the daughter?
Assumed?
She's gone.
Found a shell casing. 
Looks like one of ours.
So where do you suppose the Chief keeps his gun safe?
Thank you, Scott.
Nice.
Still looking for that Nine .
So you think the Chief might've kept his signature piece someplace else?
Yeah.
So I'm thinking that the wife might be in on this.
What?
So, you saw a baseball cap and sunglasses.
Did you actually see the chief's face 
Any bodies, Joe?
Who is this?
What is his connection to the chief?
Catherine Willows.
All right, let's just be clear. This is a Las Vegas case. This is our victim and we do the processing.
I appreciate the respect.
Hi, Sasha. I'm Catherine Willows. And ... I need to ask you a few questions. Okay? 
My kit. Did the man touch you?
Did he hit you? Did he hurt you in any way?
Well, you know what always happens to bad people? They leave behind a part of themselves and that's how you can help us find your mommy. Now, I need to look underneath your fingernails.
You want to show me what's in your hand?
Where did you get that?
Catherine Willows. Southern ... Nevada.
We don't really work theories. Do we, Warrick?
Uh, no, the chief's little girl is with child services. We're still at the drop-off place.  Yeah, right. Will do, Brass.
Okay.
We got some tire treads on the shoulder. Made an easy stop.
I don't even know you.
Not very far.
If you're lucky, urethral cells with slough off with urine. 
The guy has B.O.?
All this because some showgirl said he smelled sweet?
Uh, yeah, we are. They picked the place. The Shore Club. Later. 
What's taking so long?
48?
Willows.
I don't understand. Why didn't the Feds put this out on NCIC?
Cover you for what?
Yeah, that's Mina Rittle.
Mina Rittle.
But somehow it got preserved in the water. My guess is the plastic was wrapped around her eyes at some point.
Adam Van Der Welk. Little girl saw a monster. Showgirl saw a husband. So this guy could be anybody.
You, too.
I'm sure he's making progress but Grissom rarely says anything until he's good and ready.
You say that like it means something.
Yum. This is where he got the idea.
Ready, honey?
Do you recognize this guy?
Look, you work the door. Anybody come in here in the last 48 hours that bought some of that very expensive tupelo this is Miami.
A limo driver?
Let me guess-- from Vegas.
We understand that another one of your customers bought some very expensive honey from a club.
This customer of yours have a name?
Well, did you notice anything unusual about him? Did he smell? Did he ... have an odor?
Well, we'd like to take a look.
Vodka.
Gin.
Sickly sweet. That's exactly how Grissom described it.
You found a medical condition.
Which I guess could easily be mistaken for whiskey breath. Hey, can you test for diabetic ketoacidosis off urine?
What would a doctor prescribe? 
Absence of c-peptide in the blood. Means the insulin in our guy's system isn't natural -- it's synthetic.
Gordon Daimler. That's the limo driver.
But the scent was still in the limo's AC system. Well, now we have this guy's address.
Who's the owner of record?
Sissy and Dylan Corwin. That's the couple he was picking up at the airport when we pulled him over.
So then maybe that's how he finds his victims -- driving a limo.
Hops over to Las Vegas. Visits the couple he met in Miami. Kills the husband...
...Brings the wife back here-- kills her.
No one's answering inside.
He wrapped her in plastic by the bed, raped her.
If Gordon's true to form, he's going to kill the Corwins.
The boat's missing and that's where he's killing them right now.
Identify the other players.
How? We haven't identified all the players.
Give us thirty seconds.
Gordon, did you drive your limo here? 
He's clean.
Like the lent you their boat?
The husband didn't die. He left us a witness and enough evidence to convict you in two states.
Nah, you got it. I'll have my D.A. call your D.A.
Thanks for yours, actually.
I always do.
Hello.
Nice suit. 
Yeah. Right.
Nothing. It's just ... unusual to see you dressed like that.
Missed me that much, huh?
Hey, O'Riley, we got the 419.
Well, good. Then you can fill us in.
You're a Therapist.
And why were you seeing Dylan?
We can always get a warrant to get your records.
Ten o'clock at night. You use your home?
Did you try to revive him.
I can see that.
Goat cheese, goat milk.
Angora.
Sheered, washed, spun and dyed. Angora's 100% goat. You didn't know that, Nick?
Yeah?
Who hasn't? Didn't save my marriage.
Rather I tell them to you?
Yeah, well, this time, maybe she will.
Linen closet, top shelf.
He resisted; you persisted. Then what?
s*x with an underage patient.
It doesn't make you any less guilty.
What's going on with you?
We're on a case.
How many swabs does it take to process a blanket?
The lab tested Dylan Buckley's blood for Creatine Kinase which would be elevated post-seizure ...
You're racing me, Nick. We're driving the same car. 
Nick! 
Nick, I'll have you removed from the case. 
You're confronting suspects before the evidence is processed. You're flying solo, cutting me out. What's going on?
I'm sorry.
Dylan Buckley's. Dr. Sapien's.
Familial DNA.
Naked kid under a blanket at his shrink's late at night and his mother's there.
Congratulations.
He was wrapped in that blanket.
Mrs. Buckley, we know that your son didn't have a seizure. We also know that you were at Dr. Sapien's house with Dylan the night that he died.
What is the blanket for?
So you wrapped Dylan up ... beat the hell out of him and hocus-pocus, he's supposed to love you again?
Somewhere in the middle of an angora birth canal?
So you pushed on him like a mother in labor?
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! What are you doing?
There's been a murder here. Nothing gets cleaned.
Everything is Evidence. Policy of the Las Vegas Crime Lab. Should we call the Sheriff?
Thank you.
Worse.
Yeah. Till you caught me.
Hi. 
Brass said the victim had a can of spray paint, right? 
Paint from another source. I'm going to find out who belongs to that locker. 
And was this a first or has the deceased spray-painted his locker before? 
Well, that's obvious or a young man wouldn't be dead. Tell me what stick means. 
And Miss Barrett says that a Dennis Fram had been bullied by the deceased all year. He spray-painted his locker many times always something to do with his build. Skinny, shorty ... that kind of thing.
Oh, I'll catch up to you.
Hey ... I need to talk to you.
It's not about that.
So how's your new toy working out?
Bummer. I know how you wanted to see that thing work.
So why did you need the expensive one in the first place?
I'll see you in homeroom.
I was what?
A bully? All right, I guess I was. But, I mean, not the kind that people want to take a gun out and shoot.
Like you, Nick, huh? 
Oh, Nick ... what were you in high school?
Dependable.
Dependable jock, Dependable stoner?
So that leaves you, Warrick. What were you?
You?
The girls didn't even notice your eyes?
Aww ... Well, what do they know? They're your best feature.
Yeah.
There's a reason. I can put him at the crime scene. Jim, can you call them from the car?
Oh ... well. I'll explain on the way.
Okay. But you'll miss all the fireworks.
We've placed him at the murder.
Proves a timeline. The alkyd particles in the victim's spray paint adhere and dry in 30 seconds.
Oxidation. Dennis had to have swiped the paint within seconds of Barry putting it on his locker for his print to take.
The janitor. 
He keeps timed records of graffiti. Job security. And Dennis left paint on the door jamb in the bathroom where Barry was shot.
And then someone killed Barry.
How tall are you?
No reason.
Grissom, we got a suspect. But it's not who you think.
How did you know?
Her perfume?
A high-end woman's perfume. It's doubtful that any other girl at the school wears it.
What about revenge for her little brother?
Wears her dead mother's perfume. Nice touch.
Yeah? Well, I smell a rat in the Fram family.
Dennis?
Well, Dennis, you haven't told us that you explicitly saw Kelsey shoot the victim.
He says that his sister did it.
Oh. At a motel with the high school coach. No wonder she wouldn't talk.
So why is he saying she did?
Hi.
How the hell he'd got up there?
You're serious?
That's a total urban legend. We're scientists, Nickie. No way that happened.
And I suppose you believe in Santa?
There's a consistent burn over this whole area.
Well, the chief said that the original fire was a class C. Downed power line. Winds keep shifting hot spots breaking out all over.
Good eye.
Don't touch it. It'll disintegrate.
Hair spray. Extra hold?
It buys an arsonist a five-minute head start.
So you got an ID on the scuba guy?
Means he didn't inhale any carbon monoxide. 
There goes your theory, Nick. Good try, though. So what was the cause of death?
So, our scuba diver took one to the chest.
Hey, coffee boy. Where's my DNA? Cigarette butt? Match book time-delay device? Hair spray? Any of this sound familiar?
Did Grissom put his stuff in front of mine?
I just talked with your partner. Working this case without me, huh?
Greg Sanders?
Fissure. 
That explains a lot. Acid etching. Not bad.
Pretty smart thinking there, partner.
Okay, N-4-double oh-2, let's see what kind of lead you are.
I'm Catherine Willows, Las Vegas Crime Lab. Detective O'Riley. Is there a Jerry Walden lives here?
Are you missing a scuba tank?
So, let me get this straight, Mr. Walden. You lent Bruce Skeller a spare tank.
Well, he didn't exactly dive in the water.
Excuse me. You said that Mr. Skeller was an experienced diver. Why would he be borrowing a tank?
There used to be something here.
Interesting furniture. What is that, ash wood?
Is that what the coffee table was made out of?
Where is the coffee table?
I, uh ... ... think it needed a little more than that.
Did you bring the file? Well, there goes the foreplay.
Well, I know how you love a challenge. So, what'd the property sell for?
Whoa. Excuse me?
Hmm ... Capitalist's wet dream -- buy low, sell high. So they played it smart.
You can say that again.
I'll see you.
What about the land deed, Ronnie?
What can you testify to?
No.
Where'd it go?
What does it mean?
I'm going to forget that you called me that.
So, you've done your job. I got to go do mine. 
These ash wood splinters are from scuba guy's back?
They only get us something if they match Walden's ninja coffee table.
Radial chains align. Pores match. Two pieces of ash wood, one source. So, Walden and Skeller get into an argument probably over their land.
Walden pushes Skeller he falls back onto the ash wood table.
Which escalates to a punch.
Plenty. Why don't we just start from the beginning. Bruce Skeller didn't die in any fire. He was killed at your house.
He didn't pick up any ash splinters from that forest. It's all Telarosa and Oak out there.
You drove out to the lake, dumped the body ...
... and lit up. 
Not 'cause you wanted a cigarette. You lit up with a purpose.
You figured the fire department would label it a hot spot -- relate it to the original fire and the body would just burn up.
Yeah. Got to love this job.
D.B. ... Mediterranean Casino ... Women's Spa.
A young woman, healthy, just reading a magazine and all of a sudden she DFO'S?
Hey, Brass ... you touch this body?
Well, it looks as if the sash may have been tied by somebody else.
Miss ... you know anything about redressing the body?
Did you move the body here, too?
Actually, it is.
Ms. Marita, did the deceased use the jacuzzi facilities this evening?
It's, uh, not uncommon to drown in a jacuzzi. Hair gets caught in the whirl a person gets dragged under. The hotel wouldn't be considered unsafe.
Oh, I hope that's Shelley Danvers the woman from the hotel spa.
Well, it's about time. You guys finished with day-shift runover, huh?
Yeah, well, the victims' families hate it when we don't.
Good morning.
She didn't drown?
Anything probative?
From?
... cover-up. 
Brass, I need you to get records from that hotel spa -- a warrant, if we need it. Yep, that's right. Bye.
Yeah. Was our girl staying with anyone at that hotel?
We need someone to give us the truth about last night.
And you can verify that when Shelley went to the hotel spa last night, she was going to use the dry sauna?
You said you have proof that Shelley used the dry sauna.
Hotel surveillance would love that. You're sure she used that phone to make the appointment?
That's okay, 'cause we do. ESDA can read this blank paper ... see what's written on it. Up to 14 layers.
That's Miss Danvers' handwriting. We confirm that.
So, Shelley was in here from 8:00 until ... what time did you call 9-1-1?
You moved her into the locker room? Put the robe on her?
From negligent homicide.
I'm up for a shower and tucking my daughter in.
I thought we solved this case. What'd you get?
Don't ring her bell till we re-examine our case.
But the stroke covered up an underlying medical catastrophe.
She went into anaphylactic shock. Coroner says some of the indicators are the same as a stroke: renal failure, cerebral edema.
Because she didn't order it; you did.
We've got a machine known as the ESDA machine which can read pen imprints. 
Well, the machine isolated this. Jeremy, drinks, 10:00. Shelley made that date. That's her handwriting. Were you in the room when Jeremy call?
Well, her allergy kicked in in the sauna under the worst possible conditions -- 
... trachea... larynx ... tongue swelled. 
Oh. You're going to be getting a call from the local papers about spa safety.
We had a victim die of an allergic reaction at the Mediterranean. Some foul play ... some negligence.
That it was an isolated incident ... that in no way should it be a mark against The Strip's other fine hotel-casinos.
Bottom line.
I think we got a van full of tools we can't use. Sand's a nightmare.
You get these haikus out of a book or do they just come to you?
We grab a trowel and some fine mesh screens and we just pretend like we're panning for gold ... Master.
I'm thinking trade-in. Some lowlife gets tired of beating on the old model so he punches her ticket and starts shopping around for a version 2.0.
Not to mention some serious breast augmentation. That is not a Tijuana boob job. Those puppies are top-of-the-line
... at least we've got a pair of saline leads.
Can you grab me one of those?
Dealer's choice.
Dr. Cornfeld? Catherine Willows, Las Vegas crime lab. I believe this is one of yours.
Spare me the sales pitch. We removed that from a homicide victim. I've got a photo.
I'm going to need her name.
I'll tell you what's a shame -- that she was so pretty and perfect and still thought she needed implants.
Trust me-- I've been in her shoes. I got out of them.
They were killing me.
No domestic has a $10,000 rack. Not even in Vegas.
How much business can one sugar daddy give a plastic surgeon?
I'm for fun. Right.
But she didn't drive home.
It's still locked.
Looks clean.
What's that?
Handy.
Bag it. We can get a mold and try and track it down.
Oh, there you are. Mona's car is in the driveway. It looks clean.
And you will be...?
I feel like I'm trapped in the Marquis De Sade's brain pan.
Waiting for recess.
Didn't Grissom say he found some flecks of silver on the victim's back?
I may have found the source.
Hmm?
People are just as twisted in their own living rooms. The props are different here. That's all.
Everybody, Nick. Wake up and smell the species.
Just because you never did it doesn't mean you never could.
Hey, relax, Nick. All I'm saying is you're human.
There's one thing you learn on this job is that human beings are capable of anything.
We don't technically have a warrant.
Oh, that's not what I was thinking. How much does this place clear a week?
I'm not with the IRS.
I don't make that in three months.
Plus, the outfits are cooler. 
You got a good thing going here. And the best part is that these guys think getting slapped around and getting humiliated is their fantasy.
You got a daughter?
Really? Mine's seven.
Yeah.
All my mother ever said to me was Cash up front.
I take that as a compliment.
Well, death is still a man's business and I don't have to tell you about police work.
By knowing myself and working hard ... and by not taking any crap from powerful jerks who are used to giving it all day long.
These are the masks and straws I took out of the sink at Lady Heather's.
Oh, nice. Mmm. Yeah, that's the idea, Greg. Two straws per mask.
And not much more through straws.
Actually, I've got the yang and you've got the yin. This is as far as our watch will go. So that's on her wrist. No air bubbles. Good job.
Hm-mmm. That's from the trash can.
Wow. Looks like there's a few carats around that bezel. And the band. Major bucks. 
Oh, and, uh, computer graphics system keyed up the video system. Just hit it.
Yin and yang. Top and bottom. It's definitely not a man's watch, but unique.
Well, are you missing any personal property? Jewelry? Small valuables? A watch, perhaps?
Before you do, Mr. Nelson, in the last year, did you buy a diamond watch at Maarten's jewelers at the forum shops?
Why do men always make everything look so tough?
A $20,000 watch and he didn't discuss it? He's lying.
He tried.
Did you order a $20,000 custom made watch from a jeweler at the Forum shops?
No. We'd just like to see it.
Is that the trip you look to L.A. with your boss, Ronald? Let me refresh your memory. You shared a suite. Very cost-effective. What'd you save there, two-three hundred dollars?
Sometimes, that's all it takes.
Latex. Like Hansel and Gretel, we just followed the bread crumbs all the way home.
Too late.
Played in any sandboxes lately Mr. Nelson?
Mr. Nelson, you're very emotional right now. Why don't you just take a moment collect yourself. Let me get you a glass of water.
Psychologically, she was a surrogate. In fetish club terms, she was a slave. Cameron would put a mask on her face and cover her body in liquid latex.
Cameron couldn't dominate you, so he dominated Mona. Only his last appointment, he got carried away.
I just realized that you and I have a very healthy relationship.
Well, when we have a problem, I don't paint Greg Sanders in latex and stick a straw up his nose.
Gil ... you're supposed to say something revealing back to me.
Can you imagine living out here?
Peaceful? The town just lost five percent of its population.
Yeah, in a population of 20.
What's the rush? Crime scene's not going anywhere.
Not an expectorate. Potato. Blown to smithereens.
Now, why would an assailant need silencer way out here?
We just got the call. The place is open 24 seven. Why'd it take so long?
But now without getting his picture taken first.
You're joking.
Real or fake, it didn't work.
Hey, don't knock it. It's still the best tool for lifting prints off cardboard.
Blow and print.
Easy. Jump the counter.
Lay it out.
How old is the killer?
Shoe size is five, six tops. 
Fluorescent powders?
Protocol's black.
Assistant coroners is four hours late and we are stuck out here until he transports the body. And I haven't heard from Grissom ...
I should've never been sent to this remote scene in the first place. I've got seniority. I deserve -- no, I've earned the right to pick my cases.
If I start eating, I will shut up.
Since when do you care about your appearance?
Sorry. 
We can't touch it.
Oh, thank god. It's about time.
So, uh, what took you so long?
Anything on the shoe print?
Well, at least, we're not chasing a kid.
We ID'd on from the open/closed sign.
No. Not so great. State trooper.
Yep. Well, I'll just beef him to his captain.
Tammy Felton.
A fugitive and clinical psychopath that Grissom and I put behind bars. She tried to play but I didn't bite. 
Her biological parents posted bail and then she bailed on them.
Tammy was kidnapped as a child. Raised by her kidnapper. When she found out the truth, she killed him. Hey, finish running the prints.
Tammy uses people. She wasn't alone.
Grissom!
You don't read memos. Do you remember Tammy Felton?
She's back.
She's been to Calnevari. She's a prime suspect in our convenience store homicide.
Just get to the point, Greg.
Wait a second. There was potato on the bullet?
There was potato on the bullet because there was potato inside the barrel of the gun.
Right. One of your armed robbers may have used a potato as a silencer prior to the heist.
Maybe.
He ran with Tammy's father, mostly from the law. 
A regular Bonnie and Clyde. Just what Vegas needs.
Same gun. Two crimes. One case.
What makes you think it's the right car?
Let's go.
It was dumped.
Detail ... pop the trunk.
Thanks.
It's Tammy.
Hey, Doc.
She didn't put up a fight, did she?
She was killed by the one person in life she trusted.
Darin Hanson stared her in the face and she never saw it coming.
I'll run them against Darin Hanson's DNA.
How did they sound?
They finally know where she is.
We found Darin and Tammy's prints at the convenience store. Hours before the heist, gets murdered.
Which explains why he killed Tammy.
Epithelials on her neck are a match to Darin's DNA.
Why kill a man for a few hundred bucks when you're about to steal a hundred thousand?
Play it again.
Let me guess. Laughlin, cottage casino?
I'll meet him at the station. Call you with an update.
You going somewhere?
Good idea.
Surveillance tape from the Tower Club Casino. You ducked before there was a reason to cover.
You forget about Darin Hanson? Your car was covered with gray dust-
And it still doesn't explain why you went to see Darin.
Darin Hanson shot Adam Brower but you might as well have pulled the trigger.
Yeah, me, too. He confirmed a fourth. Darin plus three. Just like Laughlin.
And he's still out there ... flush with cash and a .45 caliber.
Bobby D.
We need your help.
What else?
Narrow it further.
Just one. It's out of left field. About 75 miles out.
Where did you stash the cash?
I can answer that. It's all in a day's work.
A potato silencer muffles a bullet but won't silence it. You went in your gun drawn.
You should have arrested them. But something happened, didn't it? My bet, Tammy made you an offer.
They still had pockets full of cash from the Laughlin job. They offered you a finder's fee.
You patrol on 97.5 square miles. Is the calnevari mine a part of your jurisdiction?
That's right. We make the big bucks.
$250,000 turned a career cop bad.
We all do.
'Cause she's a babe and he's ...
.380 auto caliber.
Well, gunshots do a number of your face, so typically, women prefer pills.
Well, you do the math: Dead female spouse plus missing husband ... equals murder.
All right, look, I read rooms for a living. That closet was tossed. The carpet lit up. So I'm going to ask you again. What were you doing in there besides copulating?
Right. Well, we found this laptop on the vanity still on. You didn't play with it, too, did you?
And we have a right to protect the crime scene.
I can't tell you anything until I get all the details. I'm sorry.
Ms. Newman. Would you come with me, please?
Ms. Newman, is this your ex-husband?
Virtual tour. Right on, Archie. Before and after photos of the crime scene.
You know your art. You a collector?
Oh, I haven't been yet.
A docent. So, you think that's legit?
You'd be surprised. The rich go cheap to stay rich, you know what I mean?
Please.
And, uh, what happened to the sculpture?
You saying somebody lifted it?
Put your house on the market your privacy's up for grabs, too.
Quite the saleswoman. 
Down, boys.
Hey, Archie, freeze it.
Who's that in the background?
Like the Peter Croft sculpture.
Oh, it is. 
Oh, you're innocent in all this?
I'm going to need that DNA sample.
Great.
Say, ah.
Her stepson, Max. Did you get any DNA off the cigarette butts?
Max, we found two sperm donors on the sample from your stepmother. Your father's and yours.
What's your shoe size, Max?
The kid didn't do it. Look, we found the father's blood on the underside of the pool ledge.
So there was a struggle in the water. 
Right.
Well, do you recall living in San Diego?
Oh, it just might help jog your memory. San Diego's a military town. Your sister married a guy in the navy, right?
Well, we could go someplace else if you'd like. 
How about your house? It's up for sale.
Well, you see, we didn't have enough evidence at this point to get a warrant, but you put your house on the internet. I didn't need a warrant. Gave me complete access via this virtual tour. And all with your permission.
That's you ... that's Peter Berglund ... and that's the Pacific.
Yeah. You hired him to kill your ex-husband and his new wife.
No, but it did give me access to Peter's financial information. 
Loan application. Two signatures -- Peter Berglund and yours. You cosigned for Peter because he couldn't qualify on his own. Payment for the hit. He gets your house you get your ex-husband's money.
The thing about murder for hire ... there's always a paper trail.

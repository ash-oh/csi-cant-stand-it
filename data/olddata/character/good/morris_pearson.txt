Yes, I did.
Screaming face in a plastic womb.
Blood shower.
Three hearts beating very fast. Two large, one small.
The dog didn't make it, did it?
I didn't know she was your victim.
Energy.
I'm calling from the next room. I don't mean to alarm you but I'm feeling some negative energy coming from your room.
S-she wouldn't talk to me. I-I get that a lot.
Yes, she picked up, and hung up.
Twice, I believe.
Well, she was suffering, and I shared her fear. Seems my intuition was accurate, as it turns out.
You don't believe me, do you?
And I am a clairvoyant. You see science without abstractions. I see visions with abstractions.

Sometimes a touch or an object.
Sure.
I was only hoping to comfort her. I'm bound by that obligation.
I have more.
Locks.
Three locks. Hanging ... ghosts, hanging ghosts.
... Chest to back, back to chest. A frames, wooden beams ... church dark.
That's it.
Yeah ... they-they seem different, though. Perhaps it's the angle.

My name is Pearson. Morris Pearson. We haven't met. I worked with Mr. Grissom on the Jane Galloway case.

Please, please let me in.
Please, please, please...
I saw this house. I saw this house, I saw the number I saw the street name. Something is wrong here. Something terrible is going to happen here
I can feel it.
Please, please, listen to me.
Listen to me!
I saw the address. I saw this address.
Yeah, but that's not it, that's not it. I saw, I saw ... I saw crashing. I saw ... falling and crashing-- I saw somebody seeing through the back of his head. I don't know, I don't know ...
Green tea! Green tea! Does that mean anything to you? Green tea?

First things first. This tape was not recorded in the warehouse. No auditory echo.
Yeah, a car, a small SUV. The tape was an inch from his mouth. Sibilant pops bear that out. Helps that the killer uses hi-fi mini-cassettes. Picks up everything let me get rid of the wipers.
I don't know yet. But ... recognize this?
Now, here's where it gets funky. Watch my sensor levels.

Surveillance stills from the laughlin heist. Four perps; we've identified three: Darin, Tammy and Adam. All deceased.

You can say that again.
Yup, I got him.
Sometimes, reflections beget reflections. I figured if I could get a glimpse of the Augie cutout maybe I could get a glimpse of the cameraman.
Check out the lamp.

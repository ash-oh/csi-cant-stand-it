Daddy?
Horatio?
Is your badge real?
My daddy's a policeman.
They're looking for me, you know.
He hit my mommy.
He acted like I wasn't there.
I ran out after they drove off. I picked that up.
No. No ... hot.
You're tricking me.
My mommy and daddy are dead, aren't they? 
That's a yes.
Who? 
Did you feel sick?

Doctor: Come on, come on. Coming through.

Doctor: Sit down and let me have a look. Okay, you're out. DOCTOR: Myles will move in from the second line.
Terry Rivers: Forget about Myles, I'm going back in. Stitch me.
Doctor: Terry, will you relax? It's a weekend league, it's not the NHL.
Terry Rivers: It is to me.
Doctor: You're not 100%.
Terry Rivers: What are you, a doctor or a coach? Do me a favor, stitch.
(The game commences on the ice. The doctors stitches up the cut under TERRY'S left eye.
Terry Rivers: Come on.




Referee: Hey Jack, get over here. He's hurt bad.

Player:  Get the doc.





Grissom: Where's the body?
Brass: On the bench -- he was moved there after he collapsed in front of the net. Apparently, uh the guy was responsive enough to be helped off the ice. He died a few minutes later.

Grissom:  This looks fresh.
Brass: Well, according to the on-site doctor, he took on across the cheek earlier in the second period.

Catherine: Well, I guess is must be from the third period. Looks like that other team worked him over pretty good.
Brass: Hockey, rough game.
Grissom: Yeah, it's murder.







Grissom: Two minutes for elbowing. Four minutes for high sticking. Ten minutes, unsportsman-like conduct.
Sara: Boys will be boys.
Grissom: Yeah, sounds like these boys went to a fight and a hockey game broke out.
Sara: You just don't like sports.
Grissom: That's not true-- I've been a baseball fan my whole life.
Sara: Baseball. Well, that figures. All those stats.
Grissom: It's a beautiful game.
Sara: Since when are you interested in beauty?
Grissom:  Since I met you.

Grissom: So, we'll start at the opposite goal work our way across the blue line to center ice.
Sara: Sure.














Sara: It's not much to go on. Maybe we should be looking off the ice.




(CATHERINE talks with the 
Catherine: So, why did you move the body?
Doc: You ever tried treating someone on the ice wearing just street shoes?
Catherine: Then Mr. Rivers was still breathing?
Doc: When I brought him back to the bench, yes. Then I performed CPR, and he didn't respond.
Catherine: Did you also do the stitch work?
Doc: I'm the on-site doctor for this facility. The stitches held, and I advised Terry not to go back on the ice.
Catherine: So, if he'd listened, he'd still be alive.

Catherine: What do these guys play for? A little money? Imitation Stanley Cup?
Tommy Sconzo:  We play for the pride of it.

Catherine: And the joy of kicking ass. You are...?
Tommy Sconzo: Tommy Sconzo.

Tommy Sconzo: Right wing, first line. Hitting's part of the game. Take away the physical aspect you've got figure skating. Guys out there doing triple lutzes.
Catherine: Is that how you lost the, uh...? The sit spin? 
Tommy Sconzo: Second period, number nine. The guy's a real McCracken.
Catherine: Which means?
Tommy Sconzo: He gave me a high stick to the mouth. That's why my guys crashed the goalie. An eye for an eye, you know?
Catherine: That why your guy ended up dead?

Tommy Sconzo: What can I tell you, lady? It all happened so fast, you know?

Catherine: Usually does.




Grissom: &quot;There are three things in life that people like to stare at. A rippling stream, a fire in a fireplace and a zamboni going round and round.&quot;
Sara: Charlie Brown. &quot;I love a zamboni.&quot;
Grissom: We all do.



Grissom: The thing I love about zambonis is they pick up everything. Hey.
Sara: Yeah?
Grissom: I'm afraid the other part of this tooth might be in there.

Grissom: Time to combine Foyeer's Law of Conduction with Newton's Law of Cooling.
Sara: Pile of ice measures nine feet by five feet ... by ... nine feet. Without the calculus, I'd estimate ... a hundred cubic feet. Current temperature, one degree celsius.
Grissom: The heaters max out at 90 degrees, but the variables are constantly changing.
Sara: Let's ballpark it.
Grissom: I don't know, 50-cubic-foot melt per hour, if we're lucky?
Sara: 120 minutes for a tooth ... the whole tooth ... and nothing but the tooth.





Warrick: Whoo! There's a winner.
Nick: Easy come, easy go.




Lyric: If I should die this very moment / I wouldn't fear / for I've never known completeness / like being here / wrapped in the warmth of you / loving every breath of you / still my heart this moment / oh, it might burst / could we stay right here / to the end of time / till the earth stops/turning? 

Lockwood: Lockwood, Homicide. DFO's in the back.
Nick: Lead the way.

Lyric: ...Seas run dry / I've found the one / I have waited for / all this time ... 




Lockwood: Stan Grevey, 35. Backup sax player. One of the waitresses found him.

Nick: Tiny scrubbing bubbles.

Warrick: Yeah, after somebody wiped them down. Paramedics?
Lockwood: Nope. Just pronounced, that's it.
Warrick: Just pronounced? 

Nick: Had an interesting diet. Cowhide.

Warrick: He tied himself off.
Nick: Yup.
Warrick: All the signs of an O.D ... without any of the paraphernalia.
Nick: Your waitress say anything about a needle butane torch, that sort of thing?
Lockwood: No, not a word just said he reminded her of Coltrane.
Warrick: Coltrane, huh?

Warrick: See if I can get this back to Gregor at the lab. He could tell us what we're dealing with. Two coasters, one glass?
Nick: What do you think? Our guy having a little party with the waitress?
Lockwood: She was just coming on shift. She came through me. Already cleared her.
Nick: Well, somebody was here ... grabbed the stuff took their glass. 

Warrick: Forgot this on the way out.
Nick: Bet the contact wasn't his.

Lillie Ivers: Hey, how's he doing?

Nick: Whoa, miss.
Warrick: Whoa, whoa ... miss, you can't come in here.
Lillie Ivers: Why not?
Warrick: I'm sorry, he's dead.
Lillie Ivers:  What happened to him?!
Warrick:  Miss ... why don't we step outside for a minute?






Robbins: What took you so long?
Grissom: I was watching ice melt.
Robbins: Tox screen came up empty except for quinine. Must have had malaria in the past six months. Either that or he's a big gin and tonic drinker. I've ordered up his medical records. If I was this guy I'd have been popping pain pills. Hairline fracture of the ulna bruised kidney, ten stitches off the orbital bone fractured nasal bone, all recent. Healed rib fractures. 

Robbins: He should have worn a cage. 

Robbins: I bet he was proud of every last battle scar. What is it about organized sports?
Grissom: Well, organized sports is the paradigmatic model of a just society. Everyone knows the same language everyone knows the rules. And there's a specific punishment handed out the moment someone tries to cheat. Instant morality.
Robbins: So, uh, what did this guy do in real life?
Grissom: Stockbroker.
Robbins: Competition junkie.
Grissom: Aren't we all?
Robbins: Not me, not anymore.
Grissom: No? How'd you get to be Chief Medical Examiner? Look, we're all carrying prehistoric genes in a postmodern world. We get our meat from the grocery store instead of with a club or a knife. We have to work off our, uh, testosterone somehow.
Robbins: Foibles of youth.
Grissom: Yeah. So, cause of death?
Robbins: Not sure.  This cut nicked his carotid. Double-edged, clean blade, hockey skate, uh ... 

Robbins: Fun continues. Basilar artery also suffered significant trauma. Evidence of blood in the intimal space. Possibly enough to cause syncope.
Grissom: Loss of consciousness.
Robbins: Well, it could explain why the vic ended up in the bottom of that pile.
Grissom: So did his death cause his fall or did his fall cause his death?







Catherine: What'd you get from area 51?
Brass: Terry Rivers was an instigator. Always stirring the pot.
Catherine: Every fire needs a match. So, I guess this is their equipment?
Brass: Yeah, down to the last stick. Here's a copy of the team roster.

Catherine: Okay.
Brass: See you later.
Catherine: Okay.




Catherine: Ms. Gallagher?

Jane Gallagher: Yeah.
Catherine: Catherine Willows Crime Lab. I understand you play for area 51. Did you see much ice time during the game?
Jane Gallagher: No, they just let me take off my cheerleader uniform and warm the bench.
Catherine: You know what? Been there, done that. Just asking a question here.
Jane Gallagher: I played 24 minutes, 12 seconds -- about my season average. I also lead the team in assists.
Catherine: Oh ... you've got good peripheral vision. You see the ice really well.
Jane Gallagher: I didn't see what happened to Terry.
Catherine: You're a real teammate. Down the line, just one of the guys.
Jane Gallagher: You're looking in the wrong direction. Now, we may have disliked Terry, but his own teammates ... hated him.
Catherine: Any reason why?
Jane Gallagher: How would I know? I'm just a girl. Can I go now?

Catherine: Nice bike.





Greg: Just getting into the mind of a potential killer.
Warrick: Potential killer?
Nick: Why don't you just catch us up there, boss?
Greg: In a minute. First things first -- your contact lens was worn by a near-sighted person. And since I was born with perfect eyesight I'm experimenting with what it would feel like to be near-sighted.
Warrick: Don't tell us you're wearing our evidence.
Nick: Come on, Greg.
Greg: Give me some credit. Borrowing a pair of lenses from Archie in A/V. Giving me a headache, though.

Warrick: Mannitol-- that's that baby laxative used to cut heroin with.
Nick: China white? You sure?
Greg: The GSMS does not kid around.
Nick: West coast heroin is MEXICAN BROWN. 20, 30% pure, tops. What's china white, 75%?
Greg: Uh, your sample's 91.
Warrick: 91%? No wonder the guy O.D.'D. That's a death sentence.
Nick: Doesn't make any sense, man. The money from dealing heroin comes from the cutting. The more you cut, the more money you make. There's no profit margin in selling stuff that's too pure.
Warrick: Unless you're looking to kill someone.




Catherine: So, this is what being a stockbroker buys you.

Catherine: How do men live like this?
Greg: What's wrong with it?
Catherine: Well, it's a cave with hardwood floors.
Greg: It's clean. Television, couch. What else does a guy need?
Catherine: Well, how about a plant? Anything to makes it a little more ... human. I mean, it doesn't seem like this guy had any ... connection to anybody.
Grissom:  I don't know about that.


Catherine: It's never a good sign when the number of women a guy sleeps with is more than the number of chairs he owns.
Grissom: So, what's the ratio here?
Catherine: Well, uh, ballparking it, I'd say ... four women to every one piece of furniture he owns including the TV.

Catherine: So... I guess our guy is about three things - pucks, bucks, and ... chicks.
Grissom: Well, we still don't know how or why he died.
Catherine: Well, we know how he lived.




Greg: Any blood?
Sara: Take your pick. Testing for blood on a hockey jersey it's like handing out jaywalking tickets at a marathon.
Grissom: Well, speaking on a meta-level ... isn't it obvious? The overbearing patriarchal structure of modern organised sports represents a socially palatable sublimation of what Jung refers to as the &quot;Shadow of the Unconscious.&quot;
Sara: You sucked at team sports, huh?
Greg: I was captain of the high school chess squad.

Sara: Chess is not a sport, Greg.

Greg: Then why is there a World Chess Champion?
Sara: I think sports are physical by definition.
Greg: Well, s*x is physical. Is that a sport?
Sara: Not to me.

Sara: These blades skated through the blood pool.

Sara: Blood spatter. Good guess -- this is the one that did the damage.
Greg: You know, I had a roommate in college freshman year, from Edmonton, went on to play for the Swedish Elite league. Anyways, he set his blade at half an inch, tops. And I should know, because he made me get them sharpened.
Sara: These blades are probably set at a quarter of an inch.

Greg:  Well, that's as sharp as it gets. 

Greg: It's a tough blade to skate on. We're talking Wayne Gretzky style 
Sara: And deadly in a fight.
(SARA looks down at the card attached to the skate. It reads: &quot;Hockey Skates /
JANE GALLAGHER / ICE STATION / 493 PYRAMID WAY, L.V. NV / Date 2-27 / TIME:
1420 / C. WILLOWS&quot;)





Warrick: Yeah, that victim was out of L.A. and I don't think the singer, Lillie met him before last night, so she may be in the clear.
Nick: Sure you don't want to start in the dressing room?
Warrick: : Right ... like you're going to take dumpster duty alone.
Nick: Hey, just 'cause I've been on a personal losing streak with the ladies doesn't mean you should be, too.
Warrick: Man, I don't even know if I'm going there the odds haven't gone my way in a long time.
Nick: I'm talking about chicks, not gambling.
Warrick: Same difference.
Nick:  Mind if I go for her, then?

Nick: Warrick.





Lillie Ivers: It's mine -- but anybody could have lifted this scarf from my dressing room.
Nick: It's still yours.
Lillie Ivers: You trying to pin this on me, now?
Warrick: We're just doing our jobs here.
Lillie Ivers: Well, did you find my fingerprints on anything?
Warrick: We won't know till we print you.
Lillie Ivers: Oh I'm not worried. What you see is what you get.




Jane Gallagher: You're putting words in my mouth.
Brass: You said everybody hated him-- now we know why.
Grissom: We opened up terry's hard drive. It turns out he had your entire roster knee-deep in the stock market.
Jane Gallagher: I don't play for the rat pack.
Sara: Not now ... but you used to.
Jane Gallagher: Okay, so I changed teams. Big deal. I wanted to win.
Brass: The fact that Terry Rivers churned and burned your brokerage account out of ten grand that didn't enter into it?
Jane Gallagher: Terry was a stockbroker. He did really well for himself --
Rolex, Beemer. He said he could do the same for me. I gave him some money. If I wasn't willing to take a risk I'd have put it in a bank.
Brass: You weren't the only one, were you?
Jane Gallagher: No. All the guys had money with him. I mean, Terry was a salesman. You listened to him talk for five minutes and your hair was on fire.
Grissom: Ms. Gallagher, your skate had a certain blood spatter on it. It indicates that you're the one that nicked Terry River's carotid artery.
Jane Gallagher: Look, it was pileup. 

Jane Gallagher:  Everything was a blur. 

Jane Gallagher: That's ten guys with blades on. Hey, I was just looking out for myself.
Sara: He was a stationary target. Terry was on the bottom of all those bodies. 
Brass: Like you said, nobody saw anything.
Grissom: Including your skate intentionally coming down on his neck.

Jane Gallagher: Oh, god.

Sara: You okay? You all right?
Jane Gallagher: : I knew I shouldn't have had that shrimp salad for dinner last night. If you'll excuse me I'll get that cleaned up.

Brass: Wait, you're not going to ... what are you doing?

Grissom: It's evidence. Food poisoning especially anything with spoiled mayonnaise can induce vomiting within 15 minutes. She said last night -- that was 12 hours ago.




;






Greg: She's a liar, and a mother.
Sara: Morning sickness?
Greg: Yep.
Grissom: And you know this how?
Greg: Well, first I tested for the presence of shellfish -- crustacean free. And then I figured if she's hiding that what else is she hiding?
Sara: Little lie, big lie.
Greg: There was blood in the sample. Not uncommon in early pregnancy. Women get mucosal tears in their esophagus because they yak so much. So, I tested the blood for the presence of human choriogonadotropins. She is definitely with child. 
Sara: She wasn't showing. She's skinny as a rail. But ... still, why lie about it?
Grissom: Maybe she didn't know she was pregnant. If she had, would she have gone out on the ice?
Sara: I wonder if she would know who the father is... or was.
Grissom: Well, if it was Terry Rivers he was definitely deadbeat dad material. Which speaks to motive.
Sara: It's enough to get us a warrant.
Grissom: Except you can't safely test for paternity before the baby's born.
Sara: We could search Jane Gallagher's apartment. See if Terry Rivers might have left anything behind.
Grissom: Yeah. Say goodbye to Greg.

Sara: Bye, Greg.





Nick: I've got twins here, Bill -- one set of prints from your work card; another set from the drug paraphernalia we found in the dumpster.
Bill: Look, what can I say? He's got a son.
Warrick: Well, that's fine. That's not the issue. You tampered with the evidence.
Bill: He's eight years old. I didn't want Stan's son to hear that he died in a lounge. Foam coming out of his mouth a needle in his arm. That's too much for a boy.
Nick: Yeah, but you got him the gig. You didn't know he was a junkie?
Bill: So am I. Former. Hell, we met in A.A. I thought he was clean. I got my fourth coming up.
Warrick: Could have lost your job.
Bill: Besides, Lillie's going places. You know, she's on her way up. I want to be along for the ride.
Warrick: So, you cleaned him up, threw away his works ... why Lillie's scarf?
Bill: I grabbed the first thing I could find.
Warrick: Lillie's scarf was there?
Bill: Yeah.
Warrick: Really? You mind rolling up your sleeves for us?

Bill: I've always had good veins.
Nick: Yeah, okay.
Warrick: Thanks.
Nick: Hey, one more thing, Bill. You wear contacts?
Bill: Not anymore. Lasik surgery.
Nick: How's that working out for you?
Bill: Great. One less thing I'm dependent on.






Lillie Ivers: No, no, no, no. Don't stop.
Warrick:  I don't like playing in front of an audience.
Lillie Ivers: It's just me. What, are you uncomfortable in front of strangers or something?
Warrick: No, I just came by to ask you a few questions and I got a little carried away.
Lillie Ivers: Oh.  Well, if you keep playing I'll keep talking.

Warrick: So, um, how well do you know these people you play with?
Lillie Ivers: Oh ... well enough.  Who is this?
Warrick: I thought I was the one asking questions here.
(After a moment, he answers anyway.
Warrick: Warrick Brown.
Lillie Ivers: Lillie Ivers. So I guess we're not strangers anymore.

Lillie Ivers: Maybe you should come by later ... so we can talk some more.





Grissom: Well, Jane may play hockey, but her sheets are distinctly female.
Sara: There are semen stains everywhere. Not very Victoria Secret.
Grissom: What is Victoria's Secret, I wonder?
Sara: Beauty, Grissom. Remember? 

Grissom: Sheets may be female, but this toenail belonged to a man.
Sara: With all the s*x these people are having maybe I should take up hockey.






Lillie Ivers: I told you what I make. What do you bring in? Fifty, Sixty a year?
Warrick: So, that's what you're all about?
Lillie Ivers: No, that's what the business is all about.
Warrick: Then run.
Lillie Ivers: Hmm. I just thought that with your kind of talent you know, I could dial you in. I've got a manager with a pipeline to god.

Warrick: Sounds like you're pretty dependent on him.
Lillie Ivers: I've been booked solid for the past two years. Next stop ... blue note, motown ... anything I want. Studio time, recording contracts ... 
Warrick: Great.
Lillie Ivers: I'm a musician, Warrick, and I recognize talent. And the way you look ... you might as well be dipped in gold.
Warrick: I don't know about all that.
Lillie Ivers: What are you holding back for? You could be out there making a difference.
Warrick: I already do make a difference.
Lillie Ivers: Yeah, riding around chasing ghosts with that partner of yours. Nobody even knows you exist.
Warrick: You do.
Bill: Show time.
Lillie Ivers:  Okay ...
Warrick: So ... knock 'em dead.
Lillie Ivers: I'll try.





Greg: Catherine ... you seen any guys with a broken tooth lately?
Catherine: Yeah, I saw ten of them.
Greg: Yeah, well, one of them is your suspect.

Sara: I got your page. What's the big news?
Greg: Oh, that tooth that you found at the bottom of the snow pile ... 
Catherine: You got a match. To what?
Greg: To the nasty-ass toenail that Sara found.
Sara: What? I thought it belonged to the dead guy.
Greg: No, it belongs to a live guy.
Catherine: So, what you're saying is whoever was in Jane Gallagher's bed was on the ice the night Terry Rivers died. 
Greg: Gold.




Tommy Sconzo: It's a temp.
Grissom: What about the girl? Is she a temp, too?
Tommy Sconzo: You know, I treated Jane better than that Mutt Rivers ever did. And it never cost her a cent.
Sara: Is that why you hated Terry?
Tommy Sconzo: He was on my short list, yeah.
Grissom: You know, I got a list. It's got a negative figure of 12,000 after your name.
Tommy Sconzo: Well, money's kind of like my tooth. It don't grow back.
Grissom: Did you ever hear the story of the 19th century chinese goldsmith? He lost a lot of money for his goldsmith buddies due to his shoddy business practices so they decided to kill him by biting him to death. 123 goldsmiths took a bite out of the victim insuring that no one individual could be blamed for the murder. For who would know which one administered the lethal bite.
Sara: You're the captain of the rat pack. You make it so everyone gets a shot in and no one takes the blame -- it's a win-win situation.
Tommy Sconzo: Well, it's a nice little bedtime story for your kids, but it doesn't have a lick of truth.
Grissom: Well, there's truth in this: Your friend Jane is pregnant.
Tommy Sconzo: I'm going to be a dad?





Grissom: What kind of coronary anomaly?
Robbins: W.P.W.: Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. Interferes with the heart's electrical system.
Grissom: I never heard of it.
Robbins: Well, it didn't show during the post, but I looked at the tissue sections in histopath. 

Robbins: They showed a small defect in the atrium of the heart. 

Grissom: So, the game had nothing to do with it? It was the heart?
Robbins: Not necessarily. You know the quinine I found in his system? Lethal for someone with W.P.W. Big scars didn't do him in. It was the little scar.
Grissom: Someone still gets an assist.







Nick: Hey, &quot;Sara&quot;. If you come up here on your nights off, people are going to start confusing the two of you.
Warrick: You're here.
Nick:  What's up?
Warrick: New lead. The bartender. Purple.
Nick: Marquis Mecke Froede.
Warrick: Test for opiates.

Warrick: Purple. You know what that means.
Nick: The coasters test positive for heroin. 

Warrick:  He sandwiched the drugs between the coasters. That's how he hid it. He was dealing from behind the bar.

Warrick: When we found those two coasters in Stan Grevey's dressing room, we assumed that there was two people -- either a user or supplier. There weren't. Just our guy -- the victim.

Warrick: What's wrong? 
Nick: He wasn't the only one with two coasters, man.
Warrick: What do you mean?
Nick: Remember when we talked to Lillie about the scarf?
Warrick: Yeah?

Nick:  She had a drink with two coasters.

Warrick: So what? There could be a hundred reasons why she ...
Nick: Did you not hear me? She might be involved. You got to walk away from this fast.
Warrick: We got the dealer -- the bartender. Let's just take him out.
Nick: And we will. What about her?
Warrick: : What about her? Why don't you ... Why don't you just let me handle my business.
Nick: Then handle it.





Jane Gallagher: We were in the sack. Right in the middle of it. Next thing I know, he stopped ... how do I say this? He stopped ... 
Grissom: ... &quot;Doing it&quot;.
Jane Gallagher: Yes. Thank you. His face was flushed. He was sweating. It was all good, and then he just ... 

Jane Gallagher:  ... he went soft and passed out. 

Jane Gallagher: I was scared. I called the team doctor. The paramedics came and rushed him to the E.R.
Sara: You know we got his medical records. Let me ask you a question. When Terry came to did he tell you what had happened to him?
Jane Gallagher: He didn't tell me anything. Neither did the doctors. I wasn't family.
Sara: What did you do?
Jane Gallagher: Took off. I didn't want anybody to know I'd been with him.
Grissom: Worried that the father of your child might find out?

Jane Gallagher: I was sleeping with Terry, but I was dating Tommy.
Sara: ... and what's the difference?
Jane Gallagher: Terry was a bad boy. The kind of guy you just can't get out of your system. who's on your mind all the time. He used to drive my friends crazy. Tommy ... husband material.




Catherine: So we just double-checked the search warrant returned from Terry Rivers apartment. There was no quinine found in the location. He never had a prescription for quinine.
Grissom: Well, according to Doc Robbins he never had malaria.
Catherine: Do you have his medical file?
Sara: Yeah.
Catherine: Let me see it.
Sara: Right here.

Grissom: So Jane Gallagher is officially no longer a suspect.
Sara: Didn't have access to quinine let alone know it would kill him.
Grissom: So who did know?
Sara: Terry was a roughneck. He dished it out so the other players dished it out harder.
Grissom: Which they wouldn't have done if they had known about his heart. They would have played tentatively. Which in hockey is a sacrilege.
Sara: Someone besides Terry had to know.

Catherine: Somebody did. You can withhold medical information from your friends all you want but it's still going to be in your hospital record.
Sara: Anyone with access to Terry's medical records knew how to kill him.




Grissom: How many patients do you have with malaria?
Team Doctor: I'm an orthopedist. None.
Brass: Not according to the pharmacy in your medical building. Last month you wrote a prescription for quinine -- an anti-malaria medication.
Sara: Malaria in Las Vegas. No wonder they were out of stock.
Team Doctor: Look, a friend of mine was going to Africa. I did him a favor. That's it. Now, is there a crime in that?
Grissom: Well ... a man is dead.
Team Doctor: It hurts getting stitched. It hurts even more when you get home. I always give the guys something for the pain.
Sara: So you're the go-to guy?
Team Doctor: I am the on-site doctor for this facility. Nothing more and nothing less.

Grissom: Is this Umbria or Tuscany?
Sara: Italy. That's pretty serious.

Grissom: But Jane's had a couple of boyfriends since that trip, right? 

Grissom: Terry was an injury waiting to happen, wasn't he? And when it did, you were there on the bench with two little pills in your hand. 

Team Doctor: So what? So what if I gave him quinine?
Brass: It's like giving a candy bar to a diabetic if you know he's a diabetic.
Sara: And you knew, doctor. Terry Rivers had a heart condition.

Jane Gallagher: I need you.
Team Doctor: Oh, yeah, since when? 
Jane Gallagher: Look, we tried it out, it didn't work. We're friends. I don't want the whole world to know that I've been with Terry. Please?

Team Doctor: Okay, okay. I'll stay with Terry.

Brass: You were always cleaning up her messes weren't you, Doctor?
Sara: Jane told us she paid you a visit a couple of days ago. She thought she had the flu ... but she didn't. She's pregnant. And with the father out of the way, you knew who she would turn to.
Grissom: But Tommy Sconzo is the father.

Grissom: You killed the wrong guy.

Brass:  Let's take a little drive.





Nick: You're nearsighted? I bet this is going to match the contact lens we found at the crime scene. Let me ask you another question. Why deal 91% pure china white? Did you have a beef with the victim, or what?
Bartender: I never met the guy.
Nick: You're going to have to do better than that. You intentionally sold him stuff that was too pure.
Warrick: We know he's not the only guy you dealt it to.
Bartender: Look, I didn't mean to harm anybody, all right? I didn't know what I was cutting. Probably got a bad batch.
Warrick: Bad batch?

Nick: Hey, do yourself a favor, slick. If you don't know enough about something, stay out of it.
Lockwood: It's too late for that.

Nick: You want to talk about it?
Warrick: No.
Nick: Okay.
Warrick: I'm going to meet Lillie. I'll see you back at the lab. Okay? You don't know me.

Nick:  Obviously.




Warrick:  You hiding from me?

Lillie Ivers: Are you looking for me?
Warrick: Yeah.  I wanted to talk to you.
Lillie Ivers: Oh, yeah? About what?  Come on, tell me. We're not strangers anymore, remember?

Warrick: Yeah, you're right.

Lillie Ivers: Warrick Brown.  What?

Warrick: I'm sorry, Lillie. Life's too short. Good-bye.




(WARRICK walks across the lobby. He looks at the gaming table. He sits down. He pulls out his wallet and slides a bill at the dealer.

Warrick: What are you doing here?
Nick: I'm playing cards ... with my friend.

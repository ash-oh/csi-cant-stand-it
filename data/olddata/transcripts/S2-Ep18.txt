Man : I'm telling you, the seven comes up every six rolls. I've got a system.
Man : You know what the casinos say about guys with systems?
Man : What?
Man : Welcome.
Heavy-set Man: He doesn't know what he's talking about. Everything you need to know about craps is right in this book.
Woman : I was talking to Shirley -- she said the only way to make money in that town is slots.


Walter: : I'm up 1,500.
Old Woman : That's nice, dear. Oh, now. I've found the pictures. Now look at this. 

Blonde-haired Woman: Oh, look at him.
Old Woman : He's just learning how to walk. Here's another one with his sister. 

Old Woman : Oh, there it is.
Tracy Logan: : You have a beautiful family.
Old Woman : Thank you.
Walter: We've been blessed.
Old Woman : Yes, we sure have been blessed.

Martin Draper:  Well, folks, we just hit mountain pass. 

Martin Draper: :  Means we're about 40 miles outside of Vegas. Some of you are going to be driving back with me. 

Martin Draper: : Some of you are going to be flying back with all the money you're going to win. In any case you just sit back, relax, we'll see if we can't get you there ahead of schedule.

Calvin McBride:  Hey. Want a nip?

Martin Draper: : No, I know my limits.


















Rescue Worker 1: Everybody stand by. We do not touch this car until every victim is off the bus.
Rescue Worker 2: Got it.


Sara: I feel so useless.
Catherine: It's still a rescue operation.

Warrick: We're not running the show.
Nick: Yeah. Not yet.

Grissom: They do their job and then we do ours.







Rescue Worker 1: Okay, you got him there?
Rescue Worker 2: Yeah
David Phillips: Mine are lined up right over there.

Rescue Worker 1: Yeah.

Rescue Worker 2: Let me get under. All right. There we go.
Old Woman: Walt? Where's my husband?  Walter? Walter...

Grissom: All right, I want everybody thinking worst case scenario. The highway's finally ours. Cones and pictures, skid marks, ice patches, loose asphalt, anything and everything.
Warrick: All right.
Sara: It's a pretty wide area up there. Are we clear to call in for help?
Grissom: Every Las Vegas CSI is on their way here.
Warrick: Cadets?
Grissom: Call them.


Woman : ... 1-25 roger ...

Nick: You the only trauma doc?
Trauma Doctor: That's right. Lucky me. I personally black-tagged six. Excuse me. My line of work, that's a bad night.
Nick: Yeah, mine, too. 
That the bus driver over there?
Trauma Doctor: Big surprise. The only person on the bus wearing a seat-belt.
Nick: Only one on a tour bus required to wear one. Thank you.

Greg: Hey. Got here as soon as I could.
Nick: Whoa, what are you doing here, Greg?
Greg: All hands on deck. That was the call, right? Crims on the scene.
Grissom: Crims with &quot;field training&quot;.
Greg:  Come on. I'm capable.
Grissom:  He does no collection.

Nick: You're taking my notes. You didn't bring a warmer jacket?
Greg: No.





Larry Maddox: Listen, I'll, uh ... I'll do anything that I can. I just want to help. Please.
Brass: No, sir, just, uh, uh, stick around.
Larry Maddox: I'll be right here. Thank you.

Brass: Hey. Uh, Larry Maddox. Owns the bus company.
Catherine: Got here quick. That should tell you something.
Brass: Yeah, he coughed up the passenger manifest including the driver, Martin Draper. Twenty-four passengers, one PAL. 
Catherine: Parolee-At-Large.
Brass: Calvin McBride. Seat one-C. California state pen, two years aggravated assault. He was paroled last week.
Catherine: And already over state lines.
Brass: It was news to his parole officer.
Catherine: I'm sure it was.
Brass: You know, my guys are matching names to faces both here and at the hospital. McBride tops the list. I'm going to talk to Maddox.





Sara: Four-point sweep.
Warrick: Let's roll.





Catherine: Fire department says the driver of the Camaro's dead.
Grissom: Yeah, I heard, but I think I know why the bus pulled to the right.
Catherine: Now that is a serious blowout. And the front left tire's still intact.
Grissom: Newton's third law: &quot;For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.&quot;
Grissom: Tire to rim. Rim to axle. Axle to suspension. Suspension to frame. And the lower radius rod arm ... which connects the axle to the frame.
Catherine: Not anymore.

Grissom: So, if the rod arm broke while he was driving ...
Catherine: Driver tried to maintain control. Veered to the left.
Grissom: But turning the wheel was probably going to make things worse.
Catherine: Putting pressure on the right front tire causing it to blow. The ... the bus then veers to the right and goes off the road.
Grissom: And we're back to Newton. The Theory's correct if the rod arm was the first action.
Catherine: I'm going to go see what's going on with that Camaro.



Woman : ... 1-41 north ... 

Catherine: We're going to get you out of here, okay?. Rescue!




Catherine:  Can you tell me your name?

Rescue Worker: Miss, you need to let him go. 

Rescue Worker: Let's go on three. RESCUE WORKER: One, two, three, in.




Martin Draper : This never happened to me before. The wheel just s-s-sh-shook right out of my hands.
Nick: How long after your scheduled stop in Barstow?
Martin Draper: We, uh, we-we always stop in Barstow. 

Martin Draper: Uh, McDonald's the, uh, the train station one.
Nick: I understand that, Mr. Draper, but how long after that did the wheel start to shake on you?
Martin Draper:  I don't, uh ... I don't ... 
Nick: Sir, are you okay? 
Martin Draper:  No. We're behind schedule. I got to get back to the bus.

Nick: Hold on, hold on. Wait a second. Mr. Draper ... 

Nick: Mr. Draper, have you had anything to drink tonight?  Keep an eye on Mr. Draper, will you, for me? Mr. Draper, you sit tight.
Martin Draper: I, uh, I got to go.

Nick: Won't take a minute. I understand. I understand. Hang tight.
Martin Draper: See, uh, there's people ...
Nick: I understand. I want you to take a deep breath, and I want you to blow into the end of this for me, okay?


Nick: I need a doctor over here. Greg, get some help.

Nick: Greg!

Nick: Greg! Get some help!








Nick: It's all right, man. Stop apologizing.
Greg: Oh, I feel bad. I just froze up.
Nick: That's why we have fielding training, Greg. No disrespect, but you're not qualified to be out here.
Greg: I guess I just wasn't expecting blood to look like that. Pre-collection, so different.
Nick: Yup. I remember my first time in the field. CSI One. Green as could be. Initial call was a robbery. I get there, triple homicide. Blood all over the place, mother and two kids.

Greg: How do you deal?
Nick: You just do.

Nick: Okay, what's next?
Grissom: Well, we're missing a passenger. The only one unaccounted for is an ex-con named Calvin McBride. According to Brass, he wasn't admitted to the hospital and he's not in any of the body bags.
Nick: What about the rest stop in Barstow 
Grissom: CHP and the Barstow P.D. are looking.

Greg: Anybody check the bus?

Nick: I'll find out.


Grissom: Firefighters only look in the obvious spots.
Greg: Just out of curiosity, what are the unobvious spots?
Grissom: For bodies? 
Greg: Yeah.
Grissom: Walls, hot water heaters stuffed in the box spring of a hotel room bed.  I found a head in a bucket of paint once.
Greg: I get the picture.

Grissom: What do you see?
Nick: Well ... McBride's not on the bus.


Nick: Hey, Grissom. Cheap whiskey. Broken bottle. Brown paper bag. You know, I never gave the bus driver a breath test.

Grissom: Greg, bag this, take it to the lab, swab the rim for DNA. 

Grissom:  You should be wearing gloves.
Greg: Sorry.

Grissom: This guy was in 1C.

Nick: Seat 1C was the only seat with an unobstructed path through the windshield.

Grissom: Where's the other half of this windshield?

Nick: Laminated safety glass, pops in, pops out.

Nick: Hello, Mr. McBride.
Grissom: I'm afraid our ex-con just got the death penalty.






Catherine: He's one of the victims in the bus crash. He was in the Camaro. He was driving the Camaro.

Catherine: Excuse me. 
ER Doctor:  Ma'am, not now.
Catherine: Catherine Willows with the Las Vegas Crime Lab. This will just take a second. Can you tell me your name?
Eric Kevlin: Eric.
Catherine: Eric?
Eric Kevlin: I just wanted to surprise her. That's all. If I don't make it, please tell her I'm sorry.
ER Doctor: Ma'am, this is the operating room. You need to leave.





Grissom: I need the two front wheels, axle, suspension, all of it. The whole front undercarriage.
Detail: You got it.

Grissom: Excuse me, miss. This is a crime scene. It's off limits.
Woman:  I know. I was, uh, I was on the bus.
Grissom: Why are you here?
Woman: I don't ... I don't know.  I'm sorry.






Sara: Shreds of rubber everywhere. Between the crash, and all the other interstate traffic it might as well be the Indy 500. This stuff could be from any vehicle.
Warrick: There's no doubt that this bus body-checked this k-rail.




Warrick: You've got that &quot;Sara&quot; look.
Sara: You mean that &quot;Grissom&quot; look?  Second set of skid marks. Camaro.

Warrick: I got a theory. Grissom said the suspension gave on the bus, right? Broken rod arm.

Warrick: Well, I'm thinking when that rod arm hit the pavement it made this great first impression here.

Sara: If this is the bus ... the bus begins to slide right. Driver overcorrects.

Warrick: Crosses the highway slams into the k-rail.

Sara: Meanwhile the Camaro's holding steady in the right lane heading straight for us.
Warrick: Bus bounces off this k-rail ... 

Warrick: ... heads back towards us.
Sara: Taking out anything in its path.

Sara: Bus crosses four lanes of traffic and only takes out the car behind it?
Warrick: Yeah. Someone upstairs was looking out big-time.




Greg: Hey, boss. I had a feeling you were coming. I ran the DNA on that whiskey bottle. You'll never guess. It's not the bus driver but I do have an answer behind door number two. Seat number 1C. 
Calvin McBride. He's an ex-con. Found his DNA in CODIS.

Grissom: Good, Greg. Did you enjoy being in the field?
Greg:  You heard about it, too?

Grissom: What?
Greg: That I ... messed up.
Grissom: No.
Greg:  Well, then ... I enjoyed it fine.





Nick: You're telling me this guy wasn't intoxicated.
Robbins: Not a drop of ethanol in his system not even from cough syrup.
Nick: He could barely put a sentence together. If he wasn't drunk, then what was he?
Robbins: My guess, hungry. Driver's medical eval taken just last month. Martin Draper, 40.  Overweight. One of 15 million people in this country suffering from Type II Diabetes.
Nick: On any medication?
Robbins: Primary course of treatment would have been exercise and weight loss to lower blood sugar.
Nick: Doesn't look like he was hitting the gym.
Robbins: But he was dieting.

Robbins: Crash dieting. Didn't find any food in his stomach. Means he hadn't eaten anything in at least six hours. An empty stomach invites hypoglycemia.
Grissom: Symptoms of which can mirror intoxication.
Robbins: And in extreme cases?
Grissom: Loss of consciousness and seizure. Do I pass?
Robbins: Cum Laude.
Grissom: Cause of death?
Robbins: Just what you'd expect. Massive injuries, internal bleeding.
Nick: So, it's not the driver ... 
Grissom: We're looking at the bus.





Warrick: Check this out.

Sara: A bolt? Nice. I got twenty of them.
Warrick: Well, this one's sheared.

Sara: It is, isn't it?

Nick: Bus company just faxed over a maintenance report. Bus was in perfect working order. Serviced last week.
Grissom: Does this look like it's in perfect working order?

Nick: Uh ... no.
Grissom: What'd you get?
Warrick: Three-quarter inch bolt. It matches the bolt on the specs for this suspension system. The hex head says it's a grade eight.

Grissom: Snapped in half?
Sara: Bolts are graded according to their hardness. The higher the grade, the stronger the steel.
Nick: A grade eight bolt shouldn't snap like a toothpick.
Grissom: Did you do a Rockwell hardness test?
Nick: Yeah, I hit it with the tru-blue. It's not a grade eight. It's a grade five.

Grissom: Often when there's one ... there's another one.
Sara: Bus company was using bogus bolts.
Grissom: Inferior bolts would cause the suspension to give the bus veers off the road. If the sheared bolts were the first action.
Warrick: No, the bolts snapped midway through the skid after the bus hit the k-rail.
Grissom: Proof?
Sara: The gouge in the road.

Grissom: Broken rod arm, maybe?
Nick: Okay. Driver hits the brakes, initiates the skid.

Grissom: Why'd he hit the brakes?
Nick: Another vehicle.
Sara: Nope, only two sets of fresh skid marks on that stretch of highway.
Warrick: And the Camaro's skid marks place it behind the bus.
Grissom: So I ask again -- why'd he hit the brakes?

Nick: Man, there could be a million reasons.
Grissom: Well, fortunately, we're just looking for one.

Brass: The kid in the Camaro didn't make it.
Catherine: Eric Kevlin, 32. He was a resident at the UCLA Med Center. He was on his way to Vegas to surprise his girlfriend.
Brass: Only to end up pinned under a bus.
Catherine: But he's rescued. Given a second chance on life. and, uh ... he signs this.

Brass: &quot;Do not resuscitate&quot;? It doesn't make sense for a young person. Why refuse CPR? 





Larry Maddox: Our company has an excellent safety record.
Warrick: Until last night.
Larry Maddox: Look, you own an airline or a bus company -- any transport business -- accidents are inevitable.
Grissom: Criminal acts, however, are another matter.
Larry Maddox: Wait a minute. I've got a family. Sometimes they ride my buses. I don't take a chance with their lives or anybody else's. I screen all my drivers. Zero tolerance for drugs or alcohol. I keep strict maintenance records. Vehicle inspection every 45 days as required by law. You're not going to find anything criminal here.

Grissom: I believe this belongs to you.

Larry Maddox: Bolt, grade eight. Sheared. It doesn't happen.
Grissom: The front suspension was riddled with these.
Warrick: We have more questions about the accident but one thing we know: the suspension didn't hold.
Larry Maddox: I buy all my spare parts from reputable companies.
Warrick: We only care about the bolts.
Larry Maddox: Brillway Bolt Company.  I just switched; they were low bid.
Warrick: The consequences of saving a buck.
Grissom: I think maybe it's time for another inspection.
Larry Maddox:  I'll ground the fleet.














Brass: I get it. It's busy here in Barstow. But you do remember the bus?
Gas Station Attendant : Yeah, I knew the driver. Marty. Always fill him up on the return trip.

Woman: I remember this one guy kept checking me out. Bought a lot of turkey jerky. Oh, and this one couple was having a fight.
Brass: Did, uh, did they come off the bus?
Woman: I don't know.
Brass: But you do remember the bus?

Sean: Of course. Mojave Express. Always on time. Ten-minute rest stop, right back on the road.
Brass: Did you see a couple arguing?
Sean: No. But it was really busy.










Catherine: Hey, Nick. We making any progress?
Nick: Just this jacket so far. Passenger seat. And you?
Catherine: We checked Kevlin's property at the hospital. There's no wallet. 
Nick: Guy drives from L.A. Four and a half hours -- I got an idea.

Tracy Logan: He did. In Barstow at the rest stop. It was supposed to be a girls' weekend.

Eric Kevlin: Come back to L.A. with me, huh?
Tracy Logan: No! This is my weekend. If this is going to work, I need my space.
Eric Kevlin: I don't want to lose you.
Tracy Logan: Then go back home.

Tracy Logan: I saw him pull out. Drive off.
Nick: Well, he didn't drive back to L.A.
Tracy Logan:  I wish I hadn't yelled at him.
Catherine: Is there any reason why Eric, in a medical crisis would refuse resuscitation?
Tracy Logan: What are you talking about?
Nick: He consented to lifesaving surgery, but ... signed a DNR.

Tracy Logan: Oh, god.  It's because he was a doctor. He saw it every day. People hooked up to machines waiting to die. He swore he wouldn't let anyone he loved go through that. And if his life was at stake, he wanted to make the hard decision so no one else would have to.









Greg: I thought I told you I'd page you with the results.
Sara: I know. I want to wait. 

Sara: Greg? You're really good at what you do.

Sara: Sabotage.





Sara: Grissom.
Grissom: I finally know the first action. What initiated the skid? The right front tire started to come apart. When it blew, it left an indentation in the pavement.

Sara: I didn't see it.
Grissom: You and me both. The Treads from the right rear tire obscured it. 

Grissom: So, the driver overcorrects but since there's no more tire, all that force is displaced on the suspension system. The bolt snaps, the rod arm breaks and the bus broadsides the camaro.

Sara: But why did the tire come apart in the first place?
Grissom: I don't know.
Sara: I do. Chloroform. Inside the tire.

Sara: I found chloroform in the interior fragments of the rubber.
Warrick: Oh, that's original. What happened to slashing tires?
Grissom: It wasn't vandalism. It was an act of premeditation.
Nick: Why chloroform?
Grissom: Chloroform destroys the elasticity of the rubber. Sooner or later, the air pressure inside the tire causes it to explode.
Nick: How much later?
Grissom: Well, that's what we're going to find out. We need a treadmill -- a big one.
Nick: All right, to do what?
Grissom: Exercise a bus. Warrick, tell Larry Maddox it's in his best interest to lend us one of his ... 
Warrick: Right.
Grissom: ... and set it up in the empty police warehouse next door. Sara?

Catherine: Right. You look hard enough everybody's got a skeleton.

Grissom: What was her skeleton?
Catherine: Tracey Logan? Seat 8-B? Her boyfriend was Eric Kevlin, the camaro driver. He was a doctor. He followed her from L.A. They had an argument in Barstow. 
Brass: He didn't want her in Vegas. First step to stopping her is stopping the bus.
Grissom: And he has access to chloroform.
Brass: Chloroform can be picked up at any chemical supply store.

Vincent: Bus case?
Sara: Uh-huh. 
Vincent:  I heard Sanders broke out of here, fared poorly and disgraced us all.
Sara: No, he didn't.

Sara: Listen, I-I found chloroform on the inside of a steel-belted radial and I need to know how it got there.

Vincent: You ever hear the expression &quot;pissing up a rope&quot;?
Sara: Not in a scientific context, no.
Vincent: Well, I don't know if you can urinate up a rope but you can urinate against a rope and the urine will dribble down. Answer your question?
Sara: Yes.




Warrick: You know we need to document this for the journal of forensic science, right?
Grissom: Is this the twin?
Warrick: Yeah, this is the rear trailing tire of the crash bus. It has the same maintenance record as the tire that blew.

Sara: Chloroform, glass rod, valve core remover ....  according to Vincent and Trace, it's like pissing down a rope.
Warrick: Gravity, huh?


Sara: Reattach the valve ... reinflate the tire ...

Sara: ...and you're done. Minute, minute and a half tops.

Grissom: Did you see that?
Warrick: Yeah. You used your left hand to prop yourself up. The perp may have done the same.
Sara: Ah, yeah, I'm going to go dust that right rim. I'll see you guys.

Nick: Bus logged into Barstow at 8:03 P.M. Target would be two hours later.
Grissom: No, if the tire was tampered with in Barstow it should blow any minute.
Nick: If not, it was sabotaged in L.A. And we've got another two hours and 13 minutes.

Sara: Hello.


Sara: Cool.
Grissom: Well, I guess it's Barstow.
Catherine: Listen I scanned Eric Kevlin's car and clothing with an ion detector. There was no chloroform. He was clean.
Sara: And I got a hit off that print -- a Sean Nolan, employed by Mojave Express.
Catherine: Any chance he was in Barstow yesterday?
Sara: Uh, his route is ... Vegas/Grand Canyon but I'll call Warrick. He's on his way to the bus company right now.
Nick: You know, if this guy Nolan ;worked for the bus company, his print on the wheel could be legit.
Grissom: Well, I wish we had a &quot;who&quot; but at least we have a &quot;where.&quot;




Larry Maddox: I have a zero tolerance policy. I found marijuana in Mr. Nolan's locker. He was out of here that afternoon.
Warrick: Well, we're still going to need those maintenance records.

Larry Maddox: Everything from fill-ups to tune-ups the last six months.
Warrick: Thank you.





Catherine: There were security cameras behind the counter but none of them were pointed out here.
Grissom: Five buses have pulled in in the last ten minutes.
Brass: Not to mention all the private vehicles, truckers-- nothing's changed since I was here yesterday.
Catherine: Forget about getting a usable print off that airhose.
Brass: Yeah, a guy putting air in a tire at a rest stop does not draw attention.

Grissom: Grissom.


Warrick: Sean Nolan was fired two months ago. Maddox says he's working in Barstow and since then three of Maddox's buses had blowouts. They all went through Barstow.
Grissom: Did you check their maintenance records?
Warrick: Yeah, only last night's bus had been serviced since Maddox changed suppliers.
Grissom: Way to go, Warrick. I owe you.
Warrick: Yeah, you do. See you.

Grissom: We got a suspect. Sean Nolan.




Brass: That's him. That's our boy. Sean Nolan?
Sean Nolan: Can I help you?
Grissom: Yeah, there was a bus crash up the road. About nine people died.
Sean Nolan: Yeah, it's all over the news. I already talked to him.

Sean Nolan: What are you doing?
Catherine: Would you turn around, please?

Grissom: Whoa. Is that a pickle in your pocket or are you just happy to see us?


Sean Nolan: Just wanted to stick it to him. Give him a few problems.
Brass: Maddox?
Sean Nolan: Yeah. I smoke one joint on the weekend... my time. Now I got a jacket as a junkie. Can't get a job driving a bus to save my life.
Catherine: So, you figured, &quot;I'll just blow a couple of his tires.&quot;
Sean Nolan: Even if a tire blows the suspension system should keep the bus on the road. I been driving buses for ten years. I've never seen a flat take out a bus.
Brass: Well, there's always a first time. You're under arrest.

Sean Nolan: I didn't mean to hurt anyone, okay?

Catherine: Well, I'd hate to be a juror on a case like this.
Grissom: Second-degree murder.
Catherine: Reckless disregard for safety and human life mitigated by bad bolts.
Grissom: Yeah, which was mitigated by greed.

MAN : Well, folks, we're about two hours and 45 minutes from Vegas. Let's see if I can get you there ahead of schedule.

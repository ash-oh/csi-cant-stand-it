Kevin Shepherd: Hi.

Amy Shepherd: That was nice. I had such a beautiful time tonight. Eight years.
Kevin Shepherd: People said we wouldn't last.  Happy anniversary, baby.
Amy Shepherd: Happy anniversary.








 
Warrick: Two victims. She's on the sidewalk, a foot from the curb and he's in the middle of the street.

Sara: What's missing here?
Warrick: No car.
Nick: No mercy. 

Nick: This guy's stabbed at least five times. Got some reddish hair. Vic's hair is brown.

Grissom: What do we got?
Brass: They had dinner at Andre's. Coroner's assistant has his wallet with the credit card receipt.

Grissom: They didn't bother to valet.
Brass: Saved five bucks, cost them their lives. Carjacking gone bad.
Grissom: Carjackers don't use knives.
Brass: Never?
Grissom: They used to say, &quot;Never on Sunday.&quot; Then Pearl Harbor happened. I never say, &quot;Never.&quot; 





Brass: Oh, man ... 


Grissom: We got three minutes to process this crime scene! 

Grissom: After that, we lose it all to the gutters! Sara, take overalls! Warrick, put a cone down on everything you bag! Nick, we got to get these bodies into the van!

Nick: Now! Let's go guys! Go! SARA: Pick the jacket up!

Nick: Let's go! BRASS: Bring me a body bag. I want to cover this woman! NICK: Get a bag, hurry up!

Sara: Can we get another gurney? GRISSOM: I need another gurney.

Coroners: Load this up! 

Nick: Let's go, let's go! Okay, I've got it.

Nick: All right, let's get him out.

Sara: Come on, come on! Hurry up! NICK: Let's go, hurry up! Get the plastic on!

Sara: We're losing everything!

Grissom: Yeah ... our killer got lucky tonight.

HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS






Warrick: Well, rain screwed up all our chances of a good DNA profile.
Nick: Don't even bother bagging it.



Grissom: Do we have any eyeballs at all?
Brass: It's a quiet street, weeknight. Neighbors heard the commotion. Kid over here, he had the only view.

Grissom: What's your name, son?

Justin Green: Justin Green.
Grissom: Well, Justin, my name's Gil Grissom. This is Sara Sidle. We're with the Crime Lab. Is, uh, is that your blood?

Justin Green: No, I-it's his, the one you took away. I tried to help him. I thought I was doing everything right. I think I might have killed him.
Grissom: Whoa. Slow down.
Sara: What did you do exactly?

Justin Green:  I was crossing the street. This SUV came out of nowhere -- almost clipped me. I turned and there was this body lying in the street.

Justin Green: Oh, my god. 

Justin Green: Help! Help! Somebody call 9-1-1!

Justin Green:  I freaked. 

Justin Green:  I did everything wrong. I didn't tilt his head back. I- I- ...

Justin Green: I didn't clear his airway.
Grissom: If it makes you feel any better, that's not what killed him.
Sara: Justin ... we're going to need to take your clothes.
Justin Green: Why?
Sara: Because there's blood all over them.








Sgt. O'Riley: Catherine?

Catherine: Hey.
Sgt. O'Riley: I like the hair.
Catherine: Thanks.

Sgt. O'Riley: What are you doing here?
Catherine: I was assigned. This is my case.
Sgt. O'Riley: Case? The building collapsed. There's nothing criminal here.
Catherine: Right. That's why you were assigned -- a homicide detective. What happened?
Sgt. O'Riley: Well, part of the basement caved in. Brought the rest down with it.
Catherine: Body count?
Sgt. O'Riley: Three old women. Sisters. One minute you're watching wheel of fortune -- next thing, game over.
Catherine: And you're not calling this a crime scene?
Sgt. O'Riley: Catherine, it's a building.
Catherine: O'Riley ... it's a suspect.



 
Nick: Hey, Greg.
Greg Sanders:  Shh. I might be looking at the mother of my children here.

Nick: Somebody's been putting in way too much overtime.
Greg Sanders: No, man, this is serious. I had a date last night and this girl has the most impossible green eyes. Just ... bamm. Shoulder-length blonde hair ... intelligent ... and she smells so good.
Nick: Cute toes?
Greg Sanders: Oh ... ideal.
Nick: Mmm.
Greg Sanders: And none are longer than the big toe.
Nick: Mmm.
Greg Sanders: Both feet. But, you know, what I need to know is what's on the inside?
Nick: Oh, what's in her heart?
Greg Sanders: No ... her DNA ... and let me tell you -- this girl has got some fine epithelials.

Nick: Dude, you're sick. Man, you've officially lost it.

Greg Sanders: No, no. There is this guy in Louisville. He charges 300 clams to test your spouse's underwear for foreign DNA. Now, that guy is sick. I'm just a romantic.
Nick: But whatever happened to getting to know someone over coffee ... letting the relationship evolve? Romantic is sending flowers not bogarting her skin cells. 

Greg Sanders: Ahh, that's boring. What are you doing? What have you got?
Nick: Um, pulled some hair off a male stabbing vic.

Greg Sanders: Okay. Baby. Uh-huh.
Nick: What?
Greg Sanders: Nine lives.
Nick: Cat hair?
Greg Sanders:  Meow.





Dr. Albert Robbins: Kevin Shepherd. Six stab wounds to the upper torso -- one to the back, five to the front.
Grissom: And his wife?

Dr. Albert Robbins: Amy Shepherd. One slice across the neck, right to left.
Grissom: Work of a lefty?
Dr. Albert Robbins: Well, the blade transected the jugular vein and both carotids.
Grissom: Hard to scream when your throat's been cut. 

Grissom: Defensive wounds.
Dr. Albert Robbins: This guy put up one hell of a fight. Attacked with two weapons.
Grissom:  Two?
Dr. Albert Robbins: Two types of stab wounds. First a long, sharp double-edged blade. The blade went in smooth ...


Dr. Albert Robbins: ... left a little collateral bruising to the skin. Weapon number two was blunt. 


Dr. Albert Robbins: Weapon number two caused extensive bruising around the points of entry.

Grissom: Two weapons ... two attackers.



 
Catherine: Hi. District Engineer?
Fireman: Over there.

Catherine: Ah. Follow the tie. 

Catherine: Is that from the rain?
Paul Newsome:  Depends on who's asking.
Catherine: Are you hiding something, or am I not worth your time?
Paul Newsome: Excuse me?
Catherine: Well, you are the District Engineer of the city, right? You're responsible for the structural safety of this building.
Paul Newsome:  I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name.
Catherine: Catherine Willows, Las Vegas Crime Lab.
Paul Newsome: Crime Lab?
Catherine: Yeah. The building fell down. Three people were crushed to death. 

Catherine: Why is the wood wet?
Paul Newsome: It's a flat-roofed structure. Leaks aren't uncommon. Maybe that explains the dry rot.
Catherine: Then what am I looking at?
Paul Newsome: That would be sheetrock.
Catherine: Drywall. But what about this layer right here?

Paul Newsome: When they installed the original drywall they used half-inch and then, when they came back and repaired it, they used quarter of an inch.
Catherine:  What, was quarter inch on sale that day?
Paul Newsome: Look, Lady, I don't know what it is ...
Catherine: Catherine.
Paul Newsome: Sorry.
Catherine: Don't say, &quot;sorry&quot; just know who you're talking to.
Paul Newsome: When they applied the second layer and then they spackled it and they painted it the difference wasn't noticeable.
Catherine: It's noticeable now. Which District Engineer conducted the last inspection?
Paul Newsome: There's only one District Engineer.
Catherine: Then it looks bad for you.
Paul Newsome:  Okay. Look, uh, Catherine, ...

Paul Newsome: ... why don't I write a report and then I'll e-mail it to you. How would that be?

Catherine: Where's the point of origin of the collapse? 

Catherine: Look, this is my crime scene. I can find it myself but that might mean lots of question to lots of people.
Paul Newsome:  Well, it's just my, uh, expert opinion but I'd say right below us -- in the basement ... the laundry room.
Catherine: Then that's where I want to be.




 
Sara: Hey, Gris. Kevin Shepherd, chiropractor. Amy Shepherd, Dentist. House in the lakes. Married eight years. Perfect credit. You know, I'm lost. There's nothing jumping off the page, here.

Grissom: What about the eyewitness?
Sara: Justin Green. First witness, first suspect but he hung around, waiting for us.
Grissom: Covered in blood.
Sara: But his story jibes. Several eyewitness saw him performing CPR on Kevin Shepherd. But if-if-if it is a carjacking, I don't get it. Why fight to the death? It's four wheels and a chassis.
Grissom: In the heat of the moment, it's not a car, it's a possession and people will fight without realizing what they're risking.
Sara: So, you are thinking the Shepherds lost their lives for their SUV?
Grissom: I'm speaking in generalities. Regarding the Shepherds ... I'm in the dark, too, just like you.




Brass: Hey, Warrick. Is Grissom around?
Warrick: You see him?

Brass: You know between you and me, as long as I've been on the job I still don't like touching dead bodies.
Warrick: Well, that's why you got the badge and I got the syringe. 
Brass:  wow.



Warrick:  I'm casting the stab wounds. From the molds, we can identify the murder weapons.
Brass: You're getting more like Grissom every day, man.
Warrick: Did you want me to give Gris a message?
Brass: Yeah. A patrol car located the Shepherds' SUV.



 
Brass: The car is registered to our dead couple.
Grissom: When you carjack a car, you keep the car. You don't dump it.
Brass: Unless you're joyriding.
Grissom: Well, who kills for a joyride?
Brass: Wouldn't be the first time.
Grissom: Has anybody else touched this vehicle?
Officer: No, sir. And I'm the one who found it.
Brass: Just the rain. The evidence on the outside of the vehicle will be compromised.
Grissom: Well, maybe there'll be some evidence on the inside.

Grissom:  Whoa. Whoa.

Grissom: Well, I haven't felt that in a while.
Brass: What's that?
Grissom: The element of surprise.







Brass: What's she doing here?
Grissom: Good question. Better question, who is she?
Brass: Hmm.

Grissom: Uh. Put some gloves on.

Brass: Yeah, I know. You know, I ... I can't believe you messed up the crime scene.
Grissom: The body fell out when I opened the door. It happens. We move on.
Brass: Mmm. Going to bother you all day.

Brass:  Jessica Hall. Date of birth -- 8-5-73.

Brass: Cell phone, power's off. Didn't call 9-1-1. They would've instructed her to leave it on.
Grissom: Seat belt's unbuckled. That's why she fell out.
Brass: Yeah, so?
Grissom: Well, she's in the driver's seat. Was she driving? Or could she have been placed in here?
Brass: Maybe she's like 28% of Americans -- she doesn't buckle up.
Grissom: I think it's 29%, actually.

Brass:  I'll go radio the 4-19.


Nick: Hope you're not allergic there, boss.
Grissom: What?
Nick: Cat hair. Found similar hair on Kevin Shepherd's clothing.
Grissom: How about Amy Shepherd?
Nick: Nope. No hairs on the wife.
Grissom: Shepherd's SUV. Stab wound. Cat hair. She's linked to the first crime scene. But how?
Nick: Victim number three. Wrong place, wrong time. Saw something she shouldn't.
Grissom: Well, finally.
Nick: What?
Grissom: Someone has a theory.





Paul Newsome: Look, I-I've got guys that are trained to do this. Why don't you let me call them? You're going to go in there, you're going to get that snappy little jumpsuit dirty, and ...
Catherine: No offense, but they work for you.
Paul Newsome: So what?
Catherine: Well, so the victims' family deserves answers.

Catherine: Somebody's responsible.
Paul Newsome: Hey, I didn't do anything wrong.
Catherine: Well, maybe not intentionally, but if a ship sinks, the last person who checked for leaks is negligent.
Paul Newsome: You're not married, are you?

Paul Newsome:  Divorced.

Paul Newsome: Okay. All right. What you see, I'll see but I just want to go on the record. This is a bad idea.
Catherine: Thanks for your input.
Paul Newsome: All right. We got a hot feed.
Catherine: I'm going in.
Paul Newsome: I'll be right here.

(Cut to: SGT. O'RILEY stands up as CATHERINE 
Sgt. O'Riley: Catherine? You sure you want to do this?
Catherine: Why is everybody asking me if I want to do my job?
Sgt. O'Riley: Because we care.
Catherine: And?
Sgt. O'Riley: The mayor ran on a platform of urban renewal. Clean out the slumlords, create habitable, low-cost housing maintained by the city. If you find so much as a scratch on an aspirin in there you know who it's going to come back to.
Catherine: I know I have a job to do. Excuse me.





Sara: Hey, Doc. What's with the fluoroscope?
Dr. Albert Robbins: When we brought the body into the lab she set off the metal detector.
Grissom: Did you check in her pockets?
Dr. Albert Robbins: : Nothing in the pockets.
Sara: What about a pin or a plate -- something metallic on the inside?
Dr. Albert Robbins: I had the same thought, but that's not what we've found. David, take her down.
David Phillips: Yes, sir.

Dr. Albert Robbins: Cause of death, laceration of the liver.
Sara: Exsanguination.
DR. ALBERT ROBBINS Once you nick the liver it's almost impossible to stop the bleeding without immediate medical intervention.

Grissom: Whoa, David. Go back up to the 12th rib, please.
Dr. Albert Robbins: I was just getting to that.
Grissom: Our killer leave us a souvenir?
Sara: What is that?
Grissom: What do you leave your waiter?
Sara: A tip ... of a knife.
Grissom: How soon can we get that out of the body?




Catherine: Am I almost at ground zero?


Paul Newsome: Almost. About ten more feet. Uh, then you should be in the laundry room. You should have more headroom, too.
Catherine: I feel like I'm crawling through a straw.

Catherine: Sweet!
Paul Newsome: What? What is it?
Catherine: Are you getting this?
Paul Newsome: What is that? A roach?
Catherine: I'm not an entomologist, but I know one. He can tell us.

Catherine: I thought this building was secure.
Paul Newsome: It is secure. Just hang on. The daily sorties. I think that was an F-16.
Catherine:  Nellis Air Force Base.
Paul Newsome: About a mile south of here.

Catherine: Anything else I should, uh be aware of?
Paul Newsome: You're in the clear.

Catherine: Okay.

Catherine: Okay. I'm in the laundry room ... what's left of it. You want to talk me through this?

Paul Newsome: Okay, look up. You should be able to see the beam now.

Catherine: Got it.
Paul Newsome: All right, connected to the beam running vertically to the concrete foundation are the support columns. Now, in a perfect world, they should be steel but given the age of the building, they might be wood.
Catherine: Yeah, it's wood, all right. 

Catherine: And it looks like somebody took a sledgehammer to it.



 
Alan Rich: So you really pulled this out of a corpse?
Sara: Yeah ... but I cleaned it for you.
Brass: We need to know the make of that knife.
Alan Rich: Well, it's not a knife. The tip's double-edged. Bevels on both sides, downward slope. This came from a dagger which means it's either carbon steel or stainless steel. I get asked this question more than you think.

Sara: Acid in the lemon juice should react to carbon steel, but not stainless steel.
Alan Rich: How's a cop know all this?
Sara:  He's the cop. I'm the scientist.
Brass: I got a cop question. What are we looking for here?
Alan Rich: Dark spots.

Sara: Carbon steel. What's next?
Alan Rich: Length.

Alan Rich: Daggers are rarely more than an inch at the base. We got the tip. So, we can fill in the rest. It's basic geometry.

Alan Rich: It's five inches. Top row-- five-inch daggers, carbon steel. 

Alan Rich: This is the one you want. $24.99. We don't take credit cards.
Brass: Yeah.




Warrick: Forget Shepherd's wife. I can't match the slash marks. It's all about these stab wounds. So I concentrated on Kevin Shepherd.
Grissom: This is a nice job, Warrick. You know, casting is an art.

Sara: And while the artist was at work, Brass and I identified Jessica Hall's murder weapon from the tip we found lodged in her ribs. It's a dagger. Fugasi model 502.
Warrick: Cool.

Grissom: So we've identified the weapon used on Jessica Hall. Was it also used on Kevin Shepherd?

Warrick: Well, I measured all the sharp points of entry on Kevin's body.
Warrick: They're all identical. They're all made from the same murder weapon.

Sara: So, if this dagger matches your mold ...

Sara: Okay. We just put the sharp wounds to bed.
Warrick: Identified murder weapon number one. Now we just need that second murder weapon.
Sara: Points of impact on these two are blunt, right?
Warrick: Yeah, who stabs someone with a blunt instrument?
Grissom: Sara, you still have the dagger tip from the body?
Sara: Yeah.

Grissom: And you have the cast of the unidentified murder weapon.
Warrick: Yeah.

Grissom: A dagger's not a diamond. It doesn't last forever.

Grissom: We don't have two weapons.
Warrick: So he started with Kevin and then he went after Jessica and then the tip broke off.
Sara: And then he went back to Kevin to finish the job.
Grissom: One weapon, one killer.



;





 
Grissom: An anobiid powder-post beetle. Very nice specimen.
Catherine: He likes you, too. Now, tell me about him.
Grissom: Your building collapsed.
Catherine: You assigned me the case. You already know that.
Grissom: Well, this little guy confirms it. This species of beetle eats softwood. Tell me about the building.
Catherine: The frame's made of Douglas Fir.
Grissom: A delicacy.
Catherine: I did find more than a bug. Dry rot, questionable repairs, a jittery Engineer. And check this out.

Grissom: Forget the beetle; this damage was intentional. You're looking for a homosapien.
Catherine: I know. Gives new meaning to &quot;home wrecker.&quot;
Grissom: Catherine, there's a reason I assigned you this case. You're good with people, both the dead and the living.
Catherine: Translation: We're opening a political can of worms. The mayor's involved, an election's around the corner and you could've clued me in a little earlier.

Grissom: Can I keep it?
Catherine: Sorry. It's evidence.
Grissom: Don't forget to feed him.

Catherine: I know-- wood.



 
Warrick: Oh, yeah. I got three prints on this gearshift and they are beauties.
Sara: Sweaty palms make the best prints.

Grissom: The coroner just sent over a ten card of Jessica hall's fingerprints. Evidently, I'm the new delivery boy.

Grissom: Are you doing what I think you're doing?
Sara: If we find what we're looking for the answer is yes. 

Sara:  Can I see those prints?
Warrick: The images are printing.

Sara: Thanks. 

Sara: No need for AFIS. We got a visual match. All three prints belong to victim number three.
Warrick: So Jessica Hall was the last person to drive the shepherds' suv.

Sara: What does that give us? We know she was stabbed at the crime scene, but then what? Was she driving herself to the hospital? Was she under duress?
Nick: None of the above.

Nick: Hey, Grissom, you know that theory I had?
Grissom: Yeah.
Nick: I'd like to revise it.
Grissom: It's a scientist's right to re-examine his theory with each new piece of evidence, Nick.
Nick: My evidence is in the layout room.



 
Nick: All the wounds sustained by Kevin Shepherd were to his torso. Now, look at this. 

Nick: Blood flow on the left instep of Kevin Shepherd's shoe.
Warrick: Lucky for us the rain missed that.
Grissom: When death is not immediate a victim will instinctively curl up into a fetal position. Which may have protected this from the rain.
Sara: Preserving the blood pattern.
Grissom: You expect blood on a victim but let's ask the question: Could the normal action and behavior of our victim have put his blood there?
Sara: The victim was lying on the ground, wounds above the waist. It's not Kevin's blood.
Warrick: Who else had a flowing wound?
Nick: Amy Shepherd was too far away but Jessica Hall was alive and bleeding.
Grissom: Okay. How did her blood get on his shoe?
Nick: Gravity. Warrick, please, on the floor our back.

Warrick: Man, why are you always trying to put me down?

Nick: Sara, you're Jessica.

Nick: Come on, now. 
Sara:  Okay.

Warrick: All right, I'm bleeding from my abdomen.
Sara: Standing here, I'm not going to get that much blood on Warrick.
Grissom: Get closer.
Sara: Well, I can't without ... stepping on him.
Grissom: You can if you kneel down.
Warrick: Why would she do that?

Grissom: Possibly to help or to hinder.

Nick: I say hinder.

Assailant : Grab his legs!


Nick: She was in on it. She held him down while someone else stabbed him.
Warrick: By the positioning of her wound, I'd say it looked like her stabbing was an accident.
Sara: Stabbing's are messy and inexact. So victim number three becomes suspect number two.
Grissom: Nick, get a warrant for Jessica Hall's apartment. We'll see if suspect number two leads us to suspect number one. And bring a scorecard with you.




Paul Newsome: Can, uh, can I give you a hand with that?
Catherine: Nope.

Catherine: How did you get in here?
Paul Newsome: Well, I flashed my city I.D. And, uh, my smile.

Paul Newsome: What are we looking for?
Catherine: A lot of factors contributed to the collapse. I'm focusing on the human element.

Catherine: Now... if a sledgehammer was taken to this column recently there'd be evidence of discoloration. The damaged part would be lighter.

Paul Newsome:  May I?

Catherine: Hands off.
Paul Newsome: Oh, right. Sorry.  No. No discoloration.

Paul Newsome: Would you like to know why?

Catherine: Yeah.
Paul Newsome: Five years ago, the building was apartment Vietnam. The facility was substandard. The city turned its back on it. The tenants revolted. Blake Neferson, apartment 204 took a sledgehammer to that column. It's public record -- he was arrested.

Catherine: Public record? And you failed to indicate the damage in your inspection report?
Paul Newsome: There wasn't enough damage to cause concern.
Catherine: Tell that to the women who were crushed to death.





 
Nick: I heard the lab matched the blood on Kevin Shepherd's shoe to Jessica. My theory's getting better and better.

Brass: Not so fast, Nicholas. P.D. traced a call Shepherd made to Jessica from Andre's restaurant.
Nick: What's he doing calling the woman who helped kill him?
Grissom: It's your theory, pal. 

(GRISSOM walks into the office area and turns on the lamp. He finds more post-
it reminders around her monitor.)
Grissom: Our little Jessica was a prolific note-taker. &quot;Be a good person today.&quot;
Brass: Yeah, right. Try not to kill too many people.
Grissom: &quot;Cancel water cooler delivery.&quot; &quot;Plan girl's night out.&quot; &quot;Light bulbs for porch.&quot;

Nick: I think I found a keypiece of evidence. 
Cat: Mrrrow.

Nick: The redhead we've been looking for.
Grissom: Red hairs on Jessica. She owns a tabby cat. Red hairs on Shepherd.
Nick: Chances are Shepherd was here without his wife.
Brass: Yeah. I'm going to run Jessica's cell phone records and Shepherd's. If anything was between those two we'll find out.

Brass:  Stay here, fella.



Nick:  &quot;To access Achex, double-click icon. User name: Jessica. Password: Money.&quot;

Grissom: Try it.
Nick: Yeah. 

Nick: Achex. Personal on-line banking. Deposits, checking, money transfers everything under the sun. 

Nick: Okay, I'm in. Direct deposit from Beaumont's department store$500 a week -- probably her weekly paycheck.

Grissom: And then a $35,000 day?
Nick: What, she win the lottery?
Grissom: How does a girl who makes $2,000 a month pull in $35,000 ... only to give it away on the same day?
Nick: Let's see who she gave it to.
Grissom: It hasn't posted yet.

Nick: No luck.
Grissom: Wait. Go back.

Grissom: Well, we know who she got it from -- Kevin Shepherd.
Nick: Wait a minute -- Shepherd paid Jessica to murder him and his wife?
Grissom: Maybe.  Maybe not. 

Grissom: We can't speak from the evidence, Nick and everybody else is dead.






 
Nick: I took this from our suspect's apartment.
Ronnie Litre: Husband and wife carjacking. I heard about the case. My friend and I eat at Andre's. Creepy.
Nick: Don't cancel your next reservation. It wasn't a carjacking.
Ronnie Litre: Well, it's a fresh pad. Only a couple of pages missing. Let's see what she wrote on those missing pages.

Nick: &quot;Quarters for laundry.&quot; Not incriminating. &quot;Pay parking ticket.&quot; &quot;Andre's at 9:00 P.M.&quot;? 

Nick: Whoa!



 
Grissom: Andre's, nine p.m. Green SUV. &quot;Corner of sixth. Sunday, K's office, 8:00 A.M.&quot; This is a blueprint for murder.
Nick: Assuming &quot;K&quot; is Kevin they were planning to meet three days after he was murdered.
Grissom: He paid Jessica $35,000. He called her as he was leaving the restaurant. He wasn't supposed to die.
Nick: No. Neither was Jessica.
Grissom: Kevin shepherd took a hit out on his wife and something went wrong. And we may have the proof.


[INT. CSI - DOCUMENTS LAB -- DAY
 
Ronnie Litre: Okay, we've got the blueprint and Kevin Shepherd's credit card receipt from Andre's. Okay. Now, normally, a signature wouldn't give us much.
(RONNIE points to the restaurant receipt that reads:
05159087654359
TOTAL: $97.40
GRATUITY: $20.00
TOTAL: $117.40
SIGN: {SIGNATURE K. SHEPHERD}
SHEPHERD, KEVIN THANK YOU! PLEAES COME AGAIN! )
Ronnie Litre: But look at the &quot;K&quot; on the receipt. now look at the K in Kay's office. Okay? Also, look at the &quot;S&quot; in &quot;SUV&quot; and &quot;Sunday.&quot; Now, look at the
&quot;S&quot; in Shepherd. Both letters are identical. He wrote both these documents.
Grissom: I think Shepherd planned the murder of his wife.
Nick: I'm with you. Why'd he end up dead?
Brass: Bad karma. Jessica and this Shepherd guy had been phoning each other day and night for the past two years. What does that tell you?
Grissom: They had a very healthy relationship.
Nick: He was cheating on his wife, Amy.
Brass: And there's more. On the night of the murder, after Jessica got off the phone with shepherd, she made a call.
Grissom: To who?
Cue Sound:  BUZZARD



 
Sara: Grissom didn't say what he was looking for, huh?
Warrick: No. 

Warrick: He just said check his clothes. Drying room. Six years in the job and it still freaks me out in here.
Sara: I think it's peaceful.

Warrick: Yeah.

Warrick: Here we go. Here we go. Justin Green. The eyewitness.

Sara: He's a suspect? When did that happen?
Warrick: Here's another thing the rain ruined -- the blood pattern on Justin's jacket.
Sara: Not the t-shirt. 

Sara: Warrick ... what does that look like to you?
Warrick: That looks like a handprint.

Warrick: Right hand. Justin's?
Sara: Wrist doesn't bend that way.
Warrick: So, it's not Justin's.
Sara: We know where Jessica's hands were. 
Warrick: Holding down Kevin's feet.
Sara: And Amy Shepherd died instantly.
Warrick: So, whose handprint is that?



 
Grissom: Kevin Shepherd's. This is a transparency of Kevin Shepherd's defense wounds.

Grissom: They fit perfectly over the handprint on Justin's shirt.
Sara: Justin's story was that he performed CPR on Kevin Shepherd.
Warrick: Yeah, but Kevin grabbed Justin's shirt so that means he was still breathing.
Nick: Which means he didn't need CPR.
Grissom: We just put the dagger in Justin Green's hand.

Sara: Damn it. Justin sold me a lie and I bought it.










Paul Newsome: What are you doing?
Catherine: Proving that you're not responsible for what happened to that building.

Paul Newsome: I'm growing on you. Aren't I?

Catherine: The damaged support column buckled. Why?
Paul Newsome: The weight of the building wasn't evenly distributed out to the load-bearing walls by the joists ...
Catherine: Good. We're on the same page. Now, I put a section of the floor assembly in the tank. I added a dozen or so of my daughter's rubber balls two sub-woofers ...
Paul Newsome: You put the whole thing on vibration isolators.
Catherine: Exactly. Because I suspect that sound vibrations may be the ultimate cause of the collapse.

Paul Newsome: Are you saying Beethoven brought down the building? 
Catherine: No, but, uh, maybe F-16s and whatever else they're flying out of Nellis Air Force Base.

Catherine: Now, I ramped up the decibels on the stereo to maximize the vibrations.
Paul Newsome: Now you've lost me.

Catherine: Watch the bouncing balls. 

Catherine: The nails are rotating. Like screws. Righty, tighty. Lefty, loosey.
Paul Newsome: Of course. Loose nails, bounce in the joists.
Catherine: Multiply that by 50 years of flybys.





Paul Newsome:  So you're pointing the...

Paul Newsome:  So you're pointing the finger at the Air force?
Catherine: No. You point one finger there's always going to be four pointing back at you. Beetles, sabotage, dry rot and time.
Paul Newsome: Am I off the hook?
Catherine: Yes. 

Catherine: Anything you want to say to me?
Paul Newsome: As a matter of fact, yes. 

Paul Newsome: Could've saved yourself a lot of trouble by not making me a suspect in the first place.

Catherine: You're welcome.



 
Grissom: Okay. Jim got us a court order for production of documents. On the left, the phone records of Kevin Shepherd, Amy Shepherd, Jessica Hall and Justin Green. On the right, their banking records.


Sara: Wednesday. 10:02 ... Kevin transferred $35,000 to his mistress, Jessica. Wednesday 2:16 p.m. ...
Grissom: Jessica transferred the money out of her account. To Justin Green?

Sara: Yes. Deposit for $35,000. 
Grissom: Well, if it was a straight-on hit for hire Jessica would've steered clear of the crime scene.
Nick: Maybe not. In 1997, Jessica and Justin had a joint account. And they shared the same last name.
Warrick: Whew. Curveball.

Brass:  So Jessica hired her ex-husband to kill her boyfriend's wife.

Grissom: All in the family.
Sara: I can trump that. Sorry, Nick. Thursday, 11:09 A.M. $70,000 was transferred to Justin Green's account.
Warrick: From?
Sara: Not Jessica. Not Kevin.
Grissom: Only one left is Amy.
Warrick: Yes, that's affirmative. I can trump that. Wednesday, 3:00 P.M. Justin called Amy Shepherd.
Brass: Oh, I bet I can tell you that conversation.

Amy Shepherd: Do you really expect me to believe that?
Justin Green: Yeah. Look, you've got to know about the affair. Check his bank account. He paid out 35. You want to counter?

Sara: Amy Shepherd does the unthinkable. She doubles it.
Grissom: Why kill one when you and collect over 100 grand?
Brass: Makes financial sense.
Grissom: And Justin secures his double cross with an insurance policy. He eliminates the person that hired him. Jessica wasn't stabbed by accident. She was a loose end.

Kevin Shepherd: Eight years. People said we wouldn't last. Happy anniversary.
Amy Shepherd: Happy anniversary.



Justin Green: It's over, man.

Justin Green: It's over. Look, you better split. Go call 9-1-1.

Jessica Hall: Stop! What are you doing?

Justin Green: Shut up, you slut!

Justin Green: She's always going to be my wife. You're never going to have her!

Justin Green: Get away from me!



Justin Green:  Call an ambulance!





 
Brass: Jessica took the car. You hid in plain sight, offering aid to the victim.
Grissom: Normally, when they pay to have someone killed they do it so they're not connected to the crime. Why was Jessica even there?




 
Brass:  Timmy. 

Brass: The Shepherds -- to the world they looked like the perfect couple.
Grissom: You know what they say about looks.
Brass: They can be deceiving?
Grissom: They can kill.

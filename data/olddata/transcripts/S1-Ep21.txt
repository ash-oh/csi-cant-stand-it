Warrick:  All right, Guy?

Nick: I guess he won't be eating dinner tonight.

Grissom: I think running man was attacked up there and then dragged or slid down here.

Warrick: Look at those wounds.
Nick: He picked the wrong time of day to be running alone. Dusk is when the animals come out.
Warrick: Yeah. From what I hear they carved out a piece of this valley when they made the park. 

Warrick:  Some mountain lion probably didn't like getting relocated. Mountain lions are brutal.
Grissom: And smart. 
 
Grissom: This one evidently knows how to use a scalpel. HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS




 

Grissom: Catherine.

Grissom: What are you doing?
Catherine:  The carnival case. I'm taking it.
Grissom: The carnival case?
Catherine: A six-year-old girl died on a ride at the carnival over on Washington. The paperwork's on your desk.

Grissom: Did you straighten up my office while you were in there?
Catherine: You think I overstepped?  These people come to town, they commit crimes and they leave. I just want to get there before the carnival moves on.
Grissom: Okay. Take Sara with you.

Catherine:  She's meeting me there.



 

Warrick: So, Doc, how big of a cat are we actually dealing with here?
Dr. Albert Robbins: We're not.
Grissom:  We're not?

Dr. Albert Robbins: You ever owned a kitten? When you play with them, they don't just bite-- they scratch. Doesn't matter whether they're tabbies or tigers.

Dr. Albert Robbins: And there's no signs of claw wounds on the victim.
Nick: So what are we dealing with?
Dr. Albert Robbins: Forget whiskers. Think spot. Teeth marks look canine.

Dr. Albert Robbins:  Bit him right through the jugular.

Grissom: I was wrong about the species.
Dr. Albert Robbins: I'll make a mold of the bite. If we're lucky we can narrow it down to breed.


Grissom: What?

Nick: Most people don't admit when they're wrong.
Grissom:  I'm wrong all the time. That's how I eventually get to right.
Dr. Albert Robbins: You weren't wrong about the scalpel. Whoever removed this guy's organs knew how to handle one.
Nick: So a dog killed him, then someone came along and cut him up.
Grissom: Someone with two legs and a medical degree.


 


Sara: Thanks.

Catherine: Stop.

Catherine:  What are you doing? That bag's been used 100 times. Get her a new one.
Sara:  They get washed every time, right?
Coroner's Assistant: Yeah-- with disinfectant.

Catherine: What if it was your kid?

Catherine: She gets this one.

Coroner's Assistant: Yes, ma'am.

Catherine:  She looks scared. No six-year-old should have to go through that.
Sara:  You okay?

Catherine: Why don't you go find the mother and talk to her. I'll take the crime scene.
Sara: Okay.





Carla Dantini: I don't know what happened. One minute Sandy was laughing, holding my hand, and the next ... the next, sh ... oh, my god.




Sandy Dantini: Mommy!

Carla Dantini: Sandy! CARLA DANTINI: Sandy, where are you?


Carla Dantini:  ... but I couldn't find her. By the time I got the operators to stop the ride ... she was dead.
Hugh Young: How can this happen ... at a carnival?



 
Nick: &quot;Go back to the crime scene. Collect the dog's scat.&quot;

Nick: I didn't realize how many dogs take their walks up here when I said that.

Warrick: Yeah, but I bet Grissom did.

Warrick:  This sucks! 

Warrick: But it's evidence, right?
Nick: No, hair and fiber is evidence, Warrick. This is combat duty.

Warrick: Yeah, it's somebody's &quot;doody&quot;.

Nick: Don't even waste your time. That's cougar.
Warrick: How do you figure that?

Nick: See the rabbit hair in the feces? Don't you remember the seminar?
Warrick:  Seminar?

Nick: Julie?
Warrick:  Julie. Oh ... a CSI should not be that fine.


Warrick: What is that?

Nick: Looks like dirty ice.
Warrick: Yeah, well, I'm taking it into evidence.
Nick: It's evidence of a picnic, Warrick.

Warrick: Yeah, well ... we'll see.


 
 
Thomas Pickens: We've never had a problem with this ride. This is the safest ride we got.
Catherine: Not anymore. So you didn't know that anything was wrong until this car came out of the tunnel, right?
Thomas Pickens: As soon as the mom started screaming, I stopped the ride.

Catherine: Seat belt's loose.
Thomas Pickens:  I check those every morning.
Catherine: Did you check this one?
Thomas Pickens: Yeah.
Catherine: So do you strap the riders in, or do they do it themselves?
Thomas Pickens: Lady, it's the Tunnel of Love, not Colossus. People like to get up close and personal on this ride.
Catherine: So you keep the belts loose on purpose. Loose enough for adults to get close or six-year-old kids to slide through?




 






Catherine: Officer, give us a minute. 

Catherine: You tampered with the evidence.
Thomas Pickens: Ma'am, I don't know what you're talking about.
Catherine: Spare me the hee haw routine. You run this nightmare on wheels. I found this in there. 

Catherine: You sent one of your employees into that tunnel to fix the track where that little girl was killed to cover your ass?
Thomas Pickens: Glad you found that, 'cause puppy's been missing since I rolled into Vegas. Look, I, uh ... I'm sorry as the next jim-jim about what happened, ma'am but ... 

Thomas Pickens: ... I ain't got nothing to do with it.

Catherine: Field test for drugs. I'm sure you've done this before.

Thomas Pickens: You can't make me take a drug test.

Catherine: Oh, before you came to Nevada you should have looked up the law. Mandatory drug testing wherever there's been an accident. Pee now, and don't tell me you're shy. 

Catherine:  Stay on him.

Sara: Mandatory drug testing?
Catherine: Yeah, well, there should be. And I don't have to wait for results to know that guy's coked out of his brain.
Sara: Cocaine bugs. 

Catherine: Oh ... crawling all under his skin.




Grissom: Like David Crosby said, big fella: &quot;If I'd known I was going to live this long I'd have taken better care of my teeth.&quot;

Greg Sanders: Right you are, Mr. Crime Scene Investigator. 

Greg Sanders: You know, most dogs have 42 teeth but, as you've discovered, your Cujo only has 41. Woof-woof.

Grissom: Did you ever hear a dog say &quot;woof-woof,&quot; Greg? 

Grissom: I mean, what is the origin of that? And what do we sound like to them, I wonder.
Greg Sanders: I don't know. Probably blah, blah, blah.
Grissom: Did you come here with some particular &quot;blah, blah, blah&quot; for me?
Greg Sanders: Yes. Two words. Paw prints. Your dentally-challenged killer left them all over the vic's clothes.
Grissom: Greg, you know that paw prints are not the same as fingerprints.
Greg Sanders: True, and even if they were, we don't have the database. But they can tell you the size of the dog.
Grissom: And?
Greg Sanders: And, according to my sagacious calculations, this is a big dog. At least a hundred pounds.
Grissom: Now if we can just figure out where he went to medical school we'll be home free.
Greg Sanders:  Huh?
Grissom: The, uh big dog is a Great Dane-Mastiff mix.
Greg Sanders:  So my paw prints didn't even help.
Grissom: No, odontology did. Dr. Robbins' dental mold. But, uh it's always nice to have a visit with you, Greg.
Greg Sanders: Thank you. So now you think you're going to find this dog?

Grissom:  &quot;The array of the bite the squarish impression of the jaw are unique to a Dane or Dane mix.&quot; And there are only 40 registered in the greater Las Vegas area. So if one of them is owed a visit by the tooth fairy ... yes ... I think I can.




 
Nick: Corn. Hamburger. Rawhide. But no human cellular tissue in this sample.

Warrick: Only thirty more jars to go. 

Warrick: This is rough, man. We should be pulling better cases by now. Millionaire murders, casino heists.
Grissom: It's interesting how we categorize evidence in terms of what it means to us as opposed to what it might mean to the case.
Warrick: Uh, we're supposed to like scat patrol?
Grissom: Sometimes we deal with bugs, worms, waste or worse. But, as scientists, we look beyond the possibly offensive qualities of these things to what they might tell us about the puzzle we're trying to solve.

Warrick: Yeah. 
Nick:  Man, do you turn it on like this at your seminars?
Grissom: People actually pay to go to my seminars, Nick. We've I.D.'d the dog.
Nick: Well, if he's got bits of jogger hanging out of his mouth, cuff him.

Sgt. O'Riley: I pulled those rap sheets. Called around.
Grissom: And?
Sgt. O'Riley: The one with the missing tooth is no angel. He attacked a gas man checking a meter. Took a chunk of thigh and severed a testicle.



 

Susan Hillridge: Can I help you?
Sgt. O'Riley: Are you Susan Hillridge?
Susan Hillridge: Yes. &quot;Doctor&quot; Hillridge.



Grissom: Is this your dog Doctor?
Susan Hillridge:  Yes. Simba.
Grissom: Well, you have a problem.

Susan Hillridge: Oh, no. Not again.






 
Susan Hillridge: What makes you think that Simba had anything to do with that jogger's death?
Grissom: There have been complaints about your dog in the past.
Sgt. O'Riley: Your meter reader's singing soprano.
Susan Hillridge: Oh, I get it now. You're talking about my old dog, Dickie. He was aggressive. That's why I put him down. Simba just gets out of the yard a lot.

Grissom: The dog we're looking for is missing a tooth. I noticed that Simba is also missing a tooth.
Susan Hillridge: Okay, he is missing a tooth. But he just gets out and wrestles with neighbors' garbage cans. He's not a violent dog.
Grissom: That may be. We still have to take him into custody until we can determine whether or not he had any involvement in this homicide.

Sgt. O'Riley: Officers, go ahead. He's all yours.

Susan Hillridge: You're making a mistake.
Grissom: You said that you were a doctor. May I ask your specialty?
Susan Hillridge: Nutrition. My patients are mostly professional athletes.
Grissom: Do you ever consult with amateur athletes? Like marathoners?
Susan Hillridge: You mean like that jogger? What was his name?
Grissom: Terry Manning.
Susan Hillridge: Doesn't ring a bell. And I'm very good with names, Mr. Grissom. You'll let me know when I can pick up Simba.
Grissom: You're assuming a lot.

Susan Hillridge: So are you.



 
Catherine: So you did the tox screen on my carny?

Greg Sanders: Roger that. You know, I have seen guys drink, like, five gallons of water to try and dilute their urine. It's the old straight flush. But all bad boy Sanders has to do is just test their specific gravity and-- blammo! -- I can still catch their toxic butts.
Catherine: Mm-hmm. So?
Greg Sanders: So your guy didn't do that.
Catherine: Great. What did he do? Try and mask it?
Greg Sanders: No.
Catherine: Oh, come on. That creep tested clean?
Greg Sanders: Yeah. For someone who's on the pill.
Catherine: What?

Greg Sanders: He's got synthetic estrogen in his urine sample. Should modulate his mood swings.

Catherine: Oldest trick in the book. Somebody else's urine. Probably keeps a stash in his trailer and that uniform was too green to look for it.
Greg Sanders: Isn't that in the constitution somewhere? A man's inalienable right to pee in private?

Sara: Hey, I just got off the phone with OSHA. Our carnival has violations in eight states.
Catherine: What a surprise.
Sara: But that's not all. More than half these guys have records. And Pickens, the boss? His real name is Roger Peet. He's a convicted s*x offender on parole.
Catherine: Let's go.





Thomas Pickens: How was I supposed to know she's 16 and a half? From the neck down she was all grown up. 

Thomas Pickens: You know what I mean?

Brass: I have a teenage daughter. So, no, I don't know what you mean.

Thomas Pickens: Jerry Lee Lewis, man. Same thing happened to him. What's all this got to do with the little dead girl, anyway?
Sara: You tell us.
Thomas Pickens: I was walking down the midway 

Thomas Pickens: ... and I seen this woman come whishing out of the tunnel, screaming for her daughter.

Carla:  My baby! My baby! My baby!

Thomas Pickens: Me and Joey -- he's the operator -- we hit the kill switch, stopped the ride, ran in the tunnel and looked for the kid. And I seen her laying facedown in the pool of water. That's it.
Catherine: What did you do?
Thomas Pickens: I didn't do nothing. She was dead. I didn't come within two feet of her. I'm sorry about what happened. But that's all that I know.

Catherine: If you so much as breathed on this child, the evidence will tell me. You can dope your urine change your name compare yourself to Elvis himself, but if you harmed Sandy Dantini, I'm going to get you.



 
 
Sara: You worried you tipped your hand in there?
Catherine: No.
Sara: Look, don't bite my head off, but any chance you're going after this guy because you're a mother?

Catherine: Pickens is a drug addict and s*x offender operating a two-ton kid magnet.
Sara: Yeah.
Catherine: Did you take a look around that carnival?
Sara: Maybe.
Catherine: Did you notice anything about those other rides? Ferris wheel-single cars in the open. Zipper-single cars in the open. Himalaya-group cars in the open. How come Pickens was hanging around the only ride that takes kids into the dark? 

Catherine: What if he pulled that little girl out of the car?

Sara: You have anything to support that? 

Sara: Hey.  We aren't going to lunch, are we?



 
Grissom: Simba's mold's still damp, but you can see it's a perfect match to the bite mark on the jogger.
Nick: Does this mean Simba's going to the big dog pound in the sky?
Grissom: No. We need to build some more evidence. Find some jogger in Simba's stool.
Nick: Well, I can tell you we found a unique sample at the crime scene. Great dane-sized scat containing bits of premium pet store kibble.
Grissom: How premium?
Nick: Sirloin, rice -- nothing artificial.
Grissom: We need to find out what Dr. Hillridge feeds her dog.




 
Warrick: Just coming to see you. You remember that ice we found at the crime scene?

Grissom: There's nothing in here.
Warrick: It didn't melt. It evaporated.
Nick: Dry ice. Frozen co2 sublimates into invisible gas, not water.
Warrick: The jogger was missing some organs.
Grissom: Surgical teams use dry ice to pack organs shipped for transplant.
Warrick: It just so happens the dog's owner is a doctor.
Nick: Surgeon?
Grissom: Nutritionist. But all medical residents have surgical rotations. Fellas, we have a doctor's appointment.
Warrick: Yeah.




 



Grissom: Would you mind if I looked in your freezer?
Susan Hillridge: I have a patient coming in exactly twenty minutes so if you want to rifle around until then, fine but I will not leave my place of business.
Grissom: No one's asked you to. 




Susan Hillridge: You're very organized, Dr. Hillridge. I imagine you're upset about your dog -- having to put him down if it comes to that.

Susan Hillridge: I don't hold onto things. I accept the evolution of change. We live, we die, we replenish the earth.

Grissom: Man's best friend ... but not yours, huh?
Susan Hillridge: None of us gets out alive. I would think, in your job, you'd know that. 

Susan Hillridge: But if we treat our bodies like a temple we can cheat time. 

Susan Hillridge: Your eyes ... 
Grissom:  What?
Susan Hillridge: The lower rims are pale. You're deficient in folic acid. You're not eating your beets. Two beets have 54% percent of the RDA.

Grissom: May I ask you what medical school you attended?
Susan Hillridge: Will that help with your investigation?
Grissom: I just thought, the way you handled that knife...
Susan Hillridge:  No. I was in the CIA. Culinary Institute of America.


Susan Hillridge: Tell me, Mr. Grissom, how does a man choose death as his profession?
Grissom: It chose me, actually.
Susan Hillridge: Will, I guess one man's corpse is another man's candy.  Care for a sip? It's full of folacin.
Grissom: No, thanks.

Warrick: Gris, can I show you something?

Grissom: Excuse me.




Warrick: Surgery equipment. &quot;Emory Medical Supplies, Boston, Mass., 1875.&quot; 
(He opens the box and inside there are surgery equipment.
Warrick: Antiques.

Grissom: Boy, these are well maintained.
Warrick: Exactly. What I find interesting is that she keeps them near the door, not in the office. In case she needs to break out and go do some work.
Grissom: Maybe she makes house calls. 

Grissom: May we help you?
Edwin: Yes. Dr. Hillridge around? I'm here for a 4:00.

Susan Hillridge: Edwin. You look great today. How did the race go?
Edwin: I finished in three hours and ten minutes.
Susan Hillridge: You can do better.



Warrick: She gives me the willies.
Grissom: We can't arrest her for that.
Warrick: Yeah, well, maybe we can link these to the crime. Her dog may have eaten that jogger but he can't harvest the organs.



 
Dr. Albert Robbins: No question about it -- the cause of death is drowning.
Catherine: How tall was the victim?
Dr. Albert Robbins: Three feet, give or take an inch.
Catherine: The water was a foot and a half deep. She could've easily climbed out, unless she was unconscious.
Sara: Maybe she had a minor concussion, or was stunned. That could explain why she couldn't get out.
Dr. Albert Robbins: I checked, believe me. She didn't. The only injury I could find on this little girl was a fractured forearm.
Catherine: Spiral or straight?
Dr. Albert Robbins: X rays just came back. Let's see. 

Dr. Albert Robbins: Spiral. That's not from a fall.
Catherine: Somebody twisted that little girl's arm hard enough to break it.

Sara: Perimortem?
Dr. Albert Robbins: Swelling takes at least two to four minutes of active circulation. There's no swelling, so it had to happen moments before she died.
Sara: So someone did yank her out of that car in the dark.

Sandy Dantini: Mommy!

Carla Dantini: Sandy!

Sara: Wait. Pickens yanks her out just so he can drown her?
Catherine: He's a s*x offender. He was going to take her someplace.
Sara: Not without someone seeing him.
Catherine: You read the OSHA report. How many emergency doors were operational?
Sara: None.
Catherine: He was trapped like a rat.

 
Catherine: He did the only thing he could -- he hid the evidence.

Sara: Drowned the little girl.
Sara:  I'm going to go call Brass. 

Catherine: You're going to enter this as a homicide, right?
Dr. Albert Robbins: Technically, it's somewhere between accidental and undetermined.
Catherine: It's a homicide. I'm going to get your proof. So write down that
&quot;accidental&quot; in pencil.




 
Carla Dantini: Can you help me? I need to find out when my daughter's going to be released.
Catherine: I'm not a coroner. What's your daughter's name?
Carla Dantini: Sandy Dantini.
Catherine:  Oh, Mrs. Dantini. I'm Catherine Willows, from the Crime Lab. You've spoken with my colleague, Sara Sidle. I'm so sorry.
Carla Dantini: Um... did you find out what happened at the carnival to my baby?
Catherine: Actually, I'd like to ask you a few questions. Is it possible that someone reached into your car and pulled out your daughter?
Carla Dantini: I ... thought it was an accident. You read all the time about how dangerous amusement parks can be. You think it can never happen to you. You think you can protect your kids.
Catherine: Well, when you went in the water to try to save Sandy did you hear anything? Did you... sense that anyone was there... in the dark?
Carla Dantini: I-I-I don't know. I mean, well, you know, it all happened so fast. I was ... focused on finding Sandy. Do you ... do you think someone else was there?
Catherine: I'm not ruling anything out.



;





 
Randy Gesek: Look, I didn't do anything wrong. I may have recycled a few caskets but you're talking about a whole different ball game, here.
Grissom: Mr. Gesek, I'm not accusing you of anything. I'm not even here officially. Think of yourself as a consultant to the Las Vegas Crime Lab.

Randy Gesek: Do I get paid?

Grissom: What do you know about organ theft?
Randy Gesek: Oh, if I was in that business I wouldn't worry about getting paid. You know, there are places overseas that'll pay 50 grand for one lung? Sixty for a heart?
Grissom: And you know this because...?
Randy Gesek: Not firsthand. Not even secondhand. At the last funeral directors' convention ... you'd be amazed what you hear. But, you know, it takes a lot to keep a business afloat.
Grissom: Tell me about the local market for organs.
Randy Gesek: Well, we're talking about life and death. It's probably pretty good.
Grissom: If someone was disemboweled and their liver taken what would that go for?
Randy Gesek: Menu, everything a la carte. Corneas, $5,000. Kidney, $20,000. Liver, 40. Bowel, 30. Pancreas, 18.
Grissom: It's amazing what you can learn at a convention.



 
Nick: Warrick. I got a match.
Warrick: Yeah. You want to hand me those filter papers right there?

Nick: The scat I found at the crime scene and the scat from the doctor's house are the same, except for one difference. The stuff from the backyard -- full of human cellular tissue. Jogger DNA.
Warrick: So we got the right dog. Well, let's see if the owner cut the vic up. 

Warrick: Reactive agents. One part leuko-malachite. 

Warrick: One part hydrogen peroxide -- used by blondes everywhere. 
 
Warrick: Blue.
Nick: Weird, isn't it?
Warrick: What's that?
Nick: To prove the presence of heme -- the stuff that makes blood red ... 
Warrick: ... turns the swab blue.
Nick: Yeah.



 
Thomas Pickens: I own this attraction and it's going with me to the next town.
Catherine: It's evidence. It's not going anywhere. Nothing is.

Thomas Pickens: What, says you two string beans?
Catherine: It's going to take a lot more than vegetable insults to get us to move.
Thomas Pickens: Lady, you don't know who you're messing with.
Catherine: Oh, I know exactly who you are, Mr. Pickens. And if you so much as look at me in the wrong way, I will personally lock you in a cell with someone who's going to do the same thing to you that you've been doing to those little girls.

Brass: Whoa, whoa. What, you start the party without me? That could get dangerous. Thomas Pickens?
Thomas Pickens: Yeah.
Brass: I got a court order. These rides stay in Vegas and you're coming with me.
Thomas Pickens: You pullin' my pud?
Brass: You know, the thought never crossed my mind. Come on.

Catherine: What?
Sara: Nothing. This is fun.
Catherine: As compared to what?
Sara: As compared to a more scientific approach.




 
Grissom: I'm sorry, guys. If she cut up that jogger she didn't use that scalpel.
Nick: But we found evidence of blood on it.
Grissom: I had Sanders run a degradation on that same sample. The blood is 50 to 200 years old -- antique, like the scalpel -- ruling out the possibility it was used in the murder of our jogger.

Grissom: Yeah. I'll be right out.  I have a visitor.



 
 
Susan Hillridge: Hi. I have folic acid. I was worried about your eyes. 

Susan Hillridge: I assume my surgical instruments came back clean, or relatively clean.
Grissom: Are you here for a nutritional consultation or to eavesdrop on my investigation?
Susan Hillridge: Actually, my house felt a little crowded -- all those men you sent.

Grissom: The, uh, police sent them.
Susan Hillridge: But you dictated the scope of the warrant. They're taking everything from my kitchen and office.
Grissom: You have three prior complaints in three separate states for owning vicious dogs.
Susan Hillridge: And? What else do you know about me?
Grissom: Each complaint is from a mountain state.
Susan Hillridge: Is it a crime to like the mountains?
Grissom: No. Only if we find other joggers have turned up dead. What's a liver go for these day
Susan Hillridge: What?
Grissom: Terry Manning was missing several key organs-- healthy organs.
Susan Hillridge: You disappoint me. I thought you were smarter than that. Coenzyme q-10 could help with mental acuity. 

Susan Hillridge: &quot;The last act is bloody, however, fine the rest of the play.&quot;

Grissom: Pascal. Very impressive. I prefer Buddha, though. &quot;Even death is not to be feared by those who lived wisely.&quot;
Susan Hillridge: One request. Ask them not to leave my house a mess. You know how I like order.




 
Grissom: What, are you guys working in bulk now?
Nick: Hey, you're the one who said that lady doc keeps skipping town.
Warrick: If the jogger's blood is in any of this stuff, we need to find it now.
Nick: This is only part of the kitchen-- the rest is in those bags and boxes.

Warrick: I'm ready, Nick. You want to hit the lights?
Nick: Yeah.


Grissom: She made a protein shake in this yesterday right in front of me.
Warrick: Why would she do that?
Grissom: Get this to DNA --see if this is the jogger's blood.
Warrick: I'd place a bet on it.

Nick:  Whoa, whoa. So she's not selling the organs on the black market ... she's eating them?
Grissom: Possibly drinking them.






 
Catherine: I want four techs in there. Let's try to pull the girl out from every conceivable angle.
Officer: You got it.

Sara: Okay, based on our theory a loose seat belt enabled Pickens to yank the little girl out of her seat.

Catherine: Mom was on the left. Where's my dummy? 

Catherine: Forty-two pounds?

Sara: Just like little Sandy.

Catherine: And, just like ... the loose seat belt.
 




Catherine: The belt wasn't loose enough to yank the girl out. Forget Pickens.
Sara: The only person who could have done it, then is the person that was in the car with her-- the mother.
Catherine: Her eyes were pointing in the wrong direction.
Sara:  I'm sorry. What?
Catherine: Carla Dantini was looking left when she told me about the accident. 

Catherine: When a person is remembering, they look right and when they're creating, they look left.
Sara: And by creating, you mean fabricating. Neurolinguistics programming -- human behavioral science.
Catherine: Call Brass and tell him to meet us at the mother's house.





Susan Hillridge: Mr. Grissom. You're looking grim. I'm afraid I don't have a supplement for that.
Grissom: We found blood in your kitchen blender. The lab has matched it to the dead jogger.
Susan Hillridge: It had to happen eventually.
Grissom: Why?
Susan Hillridge: You're the scientist. I should have thought you'd figured that out.
Grissom: I haven't.
Susan Hillridge: Think of the bugs, Grissom. Cycle of life. Angels versus insects. When we die the fable we tell ourselves is we go toward a white light and angels. But you and I both know the hard reality is that insects arrive immediately and begin turning us back to earth.
Grissom: Yes. But the insects haven't killed anyone.
Susan Hillridge: No. But they'd die if they didn't have bodies to feed off of. And so will I. 

Susan Hillridge: Porphyria.
Grissom: The madness of King George.
Susan Hillridge: Or the Legend of the Vampire. Which makes it a real hard disease to have. But it's real for me.
Grissom: It's genetic.
Susan Hillridge: The only thing my father ever gave me. The first time it presented was after a minor sunburn. My lips receded -- so did my gums. I increased my glucose intake and I was fine ... for a while. I began a drug regimen but they only treated the symptoms. I had my spleen removed because it absorbed my blood. But nothing helped. Lesions started forming on my face. That's when I bought my first dog. Bullets and poison leave residue in the blood. Dogs kill clean. Imagine what I'd look like by now without them.

Grissom: You could've tried intravenous hematin.
Susan Hillridge: Human blood is the richest source of heme.
Grissom: And so you extracted the organs with the most blood-- the liver, the spleen, the heart.
Susan Hillridge: If you lock me up, I'll go mad.
Grissom: Unfortunately, a symptom of your condition. But you've been killing people, doctor.
Susan Hillridge: I'll die in prison.
Grissom: Yes, but the people you'd be feeding off of will still be alive. Cycle of life. 

Grissom:  Sergeant.

Officer: You're under arrest for the murder of Terry Manning.

Susan Hillridge: You have one more question. How could I consume raw organs? Not morally -- aesthetically. I dried them and ground them into powder.
Grissom: Protein powder.

Susan Hillridge: You want an empirical experience? There's a fresh shake in my fridge.

Sgt. O'Riley: Let's go. Officer. 

Sgt. O'Riley: She is nuts, right?

Grissom: She's a cold blooded killer.



 
Catherine: You got the warrant, right?
Brass: Yeah, but it's limited in scope. The boyfriend's an attorney so we can't toss the place.

Sara: Mrs. Dantini.
Carla Dantini: You have news about Sandy?
Sara: We may have a lead.
Catherine: We need to see the clothes that you wore the day that your daughter died.
Carla Dantini: Why?
Hugh Young: It's okay, honey.  I'm Hugh Young, Mrs. Dantini's attorney. Carla's grieving. We both are. Can't this wait till after the funeral?
Catherine: No, it can't.
Brass: Here's a warrant. Where's your bedroom?



 
Catherine: So this is everything that you wore at the carnival last night?
Carla Dantini: Yes.

Catherine: Your watch is waterlogged.

Carla Dantini: Yes. I went into the water after my daughter.
Sara: So, you jumped in the water.
Carla Dantini: Yes.
Catherine: How come your shoes are dry?
Carla Dantini: Well ... it was yesterday. Of course they're dry.
Catherine: The lining's blue. If they'd gotten wet the indigo dye would have bled onto your white socks.
Sara: You never went in the water.
Catherine: If you didn't go into the water how did your watch get wet?

Carla Dantini:  Like I told her, reaching for my daughter.
Catherine: You reached for her all right.  To hold her under.


Carla Dantini: My baby!


Sara: And when she managed to grab onto you, you broke her arm.
Catherine: And you held her under while you sat in that car until you drowned her.
Hugh Young: Carla is any of this true?

Carla Dantini: I want you to leave.

Catherine: You took your daughter to the carnival 'cause &quot;kids get hurt there all the time&quot;. You thought the blame would leave town with the ride. Well, you should have planned better. 

Catherine: What did you actually think? That you and your boyfriend would run off like newlyweds? No kid? No cares?

Hugh Young: I never thought anything like that.
Catherine: She did.  Didn't you?

Carla Dantini:  I'm going to need a new lawyer.

Catherine:  Arrest her, Jim.


Sara: Hey ... 

Sara: ... you all right?
Catherine: Yeah.
Sara: Since we skipped lunch, you want to get something to eat? Walk it off?
Catherine: I got to go home.  Thanks. Rain check?
Sara: Mm-hmm.





 

Paul Newsome: You got my call.

Catherine: It couldn't have come at a better time.

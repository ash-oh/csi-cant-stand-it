Try-as-a-what?
I didn't take any pills.
So I did a couple of lines, but I didn't take any pills. If I was gonna take a pill, I would've popped e or a perc.
Who knows? I don't even know how I ended up in Blinky's room.
Um ... me and my girls were at Skin, and, uh ... Blinky came over and said he was partying with Julian Harper.
And he said they had this pimpy booth, so we went over. It didn't turn out the way I hoped.
And the next thing I know, Blinky's on top of me.
Thanks, but no.
There's this Stuff Magazine party at Ghost Bar tonight. I'm not gonna make it harder for me to get in because I tattled on Julian Harper's best friend. I mean, if I run into them tonight ...
Trust me, he will.
He's dead?
I was in Julian Harper's suite when he died? You're kidding me, right?
I am?
Oh, man. 
I am so getting into that party tonight for sure.

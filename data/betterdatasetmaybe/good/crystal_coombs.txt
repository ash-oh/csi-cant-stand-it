Sir!
Honey, I told him to wait ... 
I-I'm going with him.
Who do I call?
Roger?
You people think you can do whatever you want -- come into our homes, turn our lives upside down. Who's gonna explain this to our neighbors, our friends?
All right, fine, fine. Search the whole house if you want to. I'm telling you, Todd's not here.
That's because he took my car to the house company. You going to arrest him for that, too?

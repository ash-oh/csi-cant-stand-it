I need one volunteer from the audience.
You. In the blue dress.
Step into the box. Hands by your sides. Don't move.
And ladies and gentleman I assure you she's quite all right. In fact, she's ... spotlight, please.
Ladies and gentlemen ... I can't quite explain ... 
Nothing is as it seems, is it?
And you're wondering right now -- I can hear your mind ticking-- 'Was she a plant? Was it real?'
I'm an honest liar, sir. In my line of work it's accepted. You could say it was my livelihood.
My secrets can't be revealed by any microscope.
The only thing missing ... 
... is this.
From the salt in my marrow, I don't know. I mean, I can't give you this 
... but I can give you... 
... that. 
It's as real as my answer. 
No, you can keep it.
Ladies and gentlemen: I know you all want to disappear. But tonight, there'll be no sabers, no surprises and no volunteers.
Tonight, I will attempt to make myself disappear.
Nothing is what it seems. But I fooled them all. Even that ungrateful masochist.
His arrogance blinded his perception.
It-it's amazing what you can do with a stagehand and a masquerade mask. You know, not to mention a prop like a packet full of Zoe's blood. 
You know, lucky for me she let me have some before she mysteriously disappeared.
No, I 'assumed' her.
Quick-change artistry. A magical transformation. With a good seamstress and some velcro, you ...
Not as planned. And your finding me here has thwarted my transmutation. 
Abracadabra.
No. 
From caterpillar to cocoon. From cocoon ... 
... to moth. And from moth ... 
... to dust.
Yeah, but he served better as a prop.
You don't want to know how I did that trick?
And they say, they save their best trick for last.
Satisfied?

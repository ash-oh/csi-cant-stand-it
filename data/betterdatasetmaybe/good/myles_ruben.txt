hold up, slow to row / let's lay low before you go too far / remember who you are / why you want to start givin' me the third degree / all of this responsibility... /
...That you see / you see / just a part of me / just a part of me ... 
why you want the rush / why you want the rush / but yeah, I care for you / but I can't trust my heart the way that you do / 'cause when it comes/to love ... 
How was that, Sam? Sound good?
What? What's wrong? I missed a high note, huh? Man ...
An accident? What, is it my mother? Did-did something happen back East?
I gotta ... I gotta ... 
Turn the houselights up, Sam. There's no encore tonight.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. My man.
There's only one man who practices chivalry around here, and it ain't you, Ducky.
I got nothin' to hide.
Yeah. I use it to clean my windows.
I write songs late at night. Windows are my chalkboard.
Only what you feel / now I can ... 
...clearly see... 
It can't be. I was there. I opened that wine.
Not lately.
Who doesn't? I mean, fighting, loving, laughing ... it all comes from the same place, man. It's passion. And we loved each other passionately.
When we met, it was Fate.
But you know what I need right now? I need a woman. I need a woman to come up here and be my inspiration. 
You, baby. Second row. Come on up here.
I was looking for love. She was looking for the same thing. She loved my music. I loved her smile.
It's hard being on top, you know? I mean, everybody loves you. Wants their piece. That's why we fought. I mean, all the time. Every night. She knew she could never have me to herself.  Look, I got sound check for the late show in an hour. Can I go?

Those the items?
Damn. This always happens to me.
Yeah.
That's the guy.
I almost didn't call you guys, you know. What about me? I'm out 350 bucks.
Oh.  Is there a reward?
Not much. He showed me the jewels. I gave him his $350. Uh, he asked me for directions to the Tangiers.
I showed him how to get there. Recommended that Let It Ride game. It's been pretty lucky for me.

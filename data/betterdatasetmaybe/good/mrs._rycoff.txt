No one is telling us anything. It's been four days.
We have no information.
I want to know how this could happen.  Mr. Grissom. What are you doing to find my daughter?
Have any leads?! Any?
What can we do?
No, we won't. We're part of this.
We're a close family, and Paige just felt she needed to be home ... with us.
I asked ...
No, no, no. Somebody is responsible.
Because you say so?

Please go away.
This is my home. I would like you to leave.
I'd rather not.
You want to see what I look like?
How can I help you, Ms. Willows?
No one knows I live here, so when we get a visitor, I go to my room. 
Yesterday, around 3:30, the doorbell rang.
And when I came out of my room, Hayden was dead.
Because I didn't want the call traced to the house, back to me, so ... I waited till midnight, and then I walked to a pay phone. You weren't supposed to find me.
He was my only friend.  He was my connection to the outside world.
I never knew my father. My mother died when we were teenagers. 
I hope ... I hope you'll help me.
Staying secret. It's best for everyone.
Who else is there?
I don't know anything about it.
What?!
Hayden's all I had. He's the only one that knew about me. Why would I kill him?
You think I'm some sort of animal? I wanted him to be happy. I loved Hayden, I wanted him to be happy.
No, but he said that he was going to tell her and that she was going to move in here and she would accept me -- Hayden promised.
No, please. Please.
The doorbell rang. I went into my room.
I ... I ...
I hid. Behind the door.
No. It's busted. It hasn't worked in years.
I've seen him through the peephole. They were best friends.
A couple of days ago, Hayden said he saw a guy sneaking around the back. So he bought me a gun for safety. But I don't like guns so ... I just buried it in the backyard.
I think you're going to make me testify and I won't do that. I want Brent to go to jail, but I won't be the sideshow freak.
I'll be okay. It's not like when I was a kid. I can pretty much get anything I need off the Internet.
I'll manage.
I-I will, Ms. Willows.
Catherine. I haven't been completely honest with you. I told you my mother was dead, but that's not true. 
Hayden told me she was in a car wreck ... 
... and I called the funeral home to send flowers and they had never heard of her, so I called the local hospitals. Same thing. 
Recently, I contacted peopledetectors.com and, apparently, she lives in Las Vegas. She just couldn't live with me.
Yeah. When my brother was out, I used his computer.

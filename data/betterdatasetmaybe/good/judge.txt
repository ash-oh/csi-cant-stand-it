The jury may retire to the jury room. I'll advise counsel when the jury has reached a verdict.
Do you know who set the fire?
You can't charge the entire gang, counsel.
I can't give you a warrant just because she doesn't want him to get out of jail. Where's your probable cause?
Mere presence. Counsel, I got to get back to my trial.
The grand jurors are on board with this?

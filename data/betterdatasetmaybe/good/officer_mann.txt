You know why I stopped you?
I bet you do. Let's start with license and registration.
Clocked the Thunderbird doing ninety. I nail it. The skirt driving tells me she's being chased. And then she asks if she can show me some videos.
I didn't bite. She was working it.
Look, she gave me this lame story about the car being her brother's, and that she had lost her license, but she has his license, and yakety-yak. I just let her off with a warning.
What are you implying?
I resent that.
I didn't know about that until you called me in here.
Oh, so that makes me a s*x murderer?
I know a place about two miles up. It's a little more private.
What are you?!
I told you, nothing happened.
Just tell me where to spit.

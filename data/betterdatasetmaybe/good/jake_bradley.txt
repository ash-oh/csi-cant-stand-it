Oh, come on, mom, I'm starving.
No. No, I never did anything like that to my sister, no.
I can't ... I can't.
No.
Yes, but I didn't plant anything.
It was just... on the hamper.
The next thing I know, I'm getting, like ... questioned by the police and my parents are looking at me like I'm some sort of ... pervert.
Yeah.
Mmm, no. No, I mean, my sister is the one that's kind of weird.
Yeah.
She's just always just, you know, 'Mike's coming over. I can't wait till Mike gets here.'
When, uh, my parents were getting divorced my mom, she cried, like, every day and, uh, Mike showed up and she stopped crying so ... yeah. I guess.

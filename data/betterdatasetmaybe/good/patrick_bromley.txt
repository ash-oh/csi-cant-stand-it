You got my dispatcher crawling all over my ass for the past five hours. You know, you pull off a route, that costs me money.
She's not my friend. I picked her up hitching out on Sunset.
Never came up.
Dropped her off on Blue Diamond Road.
Yeah. She wanted out.
A bar fight, couple of nights ago.
If that's what's gonna get me back on the road.
Look, I was just trying to help that chick out.
Uh-uh. Wasn't like that.
No way. I mean, yeah ... the girl was ready to party. We had a couple drinks, and a smoke. She was definitely checking me out, but I'm a happily married man. I just gave her a ride.
Looks like you guys already got your answers. Which means I want a lawyer.

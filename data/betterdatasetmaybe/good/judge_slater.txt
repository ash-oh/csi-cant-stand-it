Look, I have signed hundreds of search warrants for Captain Brass, but ... this affidavit lacks probable cause. Prints on quarters, an admixture of DNA ...
... are not enough for me to invade the Klinefelds' right to privacy.
Yes... and where did it get me? Just last week, the appeals court overturned one of our convictions, based on a search warrant I gave to one of your sidekicks. We make a habit of this, I'm never going to get to the Foley building. Federal appointment. What if they kill again?
All the more reason we need to get this right. Unappealable. The affidavit is thin. You give me more ... I'll give you more.
The affidavit is standing.
Like I told you before, if you're here for a warrant, you better have evidence to back it up.
You have a lot of nerve walking in my chambers accusing me of murder.
You've a warrant to search my closet?
The warrant is limited to me, my Clerk and the Bailiff?
I look forward to the day you return to my courtroom, Detective.

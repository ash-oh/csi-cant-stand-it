I don't know her schedule. She works, goes to school. I hardly ever see her.
Stuck-up bitch is ashamed of me. Can't wait to graduate high school and move out. She's already got a job: Coffee shop. Got a car.
VW convertible, blue.
Whatever.
You got kids? They think it's all about them. Like I owe her.
I think she just took off ... like her mother.

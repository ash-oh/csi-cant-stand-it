Close the door.
I'm so sorry. Donna's worked for me the last twelve times I've come to your city. Have you notified her family?
When she escorted me here about four hours ago.
I have very real enemies.
Here, playing. It's why I come to Vegas.
Once, about three hours ago.
My luck was bad. I went to change it.
Called Detective Basset to escort me back to my suite. She didn't answer. I went by myself.
I urinated. Changed my underwear. Came back. Kept playing.
You just caught me.
You already have my fingerprints.
I'll leave you my address in Hong Kong. You can ship them back to me when you're done.
You're in my water. You're the reason I'm losing!

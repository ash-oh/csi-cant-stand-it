Hey! 
You guys CSI?
Well, the city's been rehabbing manholes with fiberglass liners. All the hydrogen sulfide down there really eats up the concrete. Anyways, we, uh, pulled these out of the main.
We find a lot of small animal bones down there, squirrels, cats, rats, you know. But that's really tiny stuff. 
This looks more like people. Fingers or toes, or fingers and toes.
What do you think?

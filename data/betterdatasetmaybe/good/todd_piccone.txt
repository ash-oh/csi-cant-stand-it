Captain Kramer.
What's up?
Yeah, it was stolen.
No, I didn't.
Who are you?
Off the record?
I went down the hill. I was, um ... lonely. Partook of the services of a certain kind of young lady. And while we were getting acquainted, I was carjacked.
I was set up. It was probably her pimp or drug dealer.
Took a cab.
Oh, the car was worth more than the cash. They knew what they were doing.
Captain, maybe I should introduce myself. Todd Piccone, Assistant City Attorney. Let's just say that my reputation is worth more than my car.
You're right. Lesson learned. Thank you, officer.
So the car was stripped, I'm sure, uh ... South Central? Koreatown? East L.A.?
'Cause, Captain, that's where good cars go to die in Los Angeles.
Uh, yeah. You know, I'm expecting company. Now's not a good time.
All right.

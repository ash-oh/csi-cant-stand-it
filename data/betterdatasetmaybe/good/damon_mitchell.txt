Oh ... man. Your face is melting.
I think I'm going to puke.
Can I get some more water?
No. I'm not ... I'm really thirsty. Doctor said push the fluids.
Okay. I was there, but I didn't kill that little con artist bitch.
'Cause I didn't think you'd believe me.  I'm in enough trouble already.
My wife is a junky. She's a psychic junky. She spent our entire savings on consultations, tarot readings and other garbage. Thousands of dollars. I told her she had to quit seeing this woman. That was my mistake. The week after, Sedona starts having these visions of me cheating. You ever try to defend yourself against a psychic's vision?
I went down there to confront the bitch because she ruined my life. You want to know what she said to me?
What?!
She tried to extort more money from me after she had already taken it all. I lost it.
You think this is funny? Huh!
No. Look, when I left there, she was alive.
It was after nine, around ... closer to 9:30.
Uh ... I went around the corner to the liquor store for some bourbon. But before I even opened it, I started to feel woozy. You know, then ... everything kind of went sideways.

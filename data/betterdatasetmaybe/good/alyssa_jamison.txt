Hello. How may I help you?
Sure.
Yes.
Oh, my god! She ... killed herself, didn't she?
She gave me a necklace.
Giving away sacred possessions. That's one of the sure signs of suicide. She traded the necklace for my dress. I told her she didn't have to, but she kept insisting. Said that she had something special to wear the dress to, and the necklace would be collateral. I took it as a good sign, because she'd been so depressed lately.
I couldn't, even if I wanted to. 
Not that I ever would.

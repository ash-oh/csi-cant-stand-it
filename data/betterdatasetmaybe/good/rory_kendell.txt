Can I help you?
Elliot? What happened?
Look, man, I've been laid up for the past two days puking my guts out. I haven't left my place.
Rory Kendell. My wife bailed a few months ago.
How would you know?
Why?
I got the flu.
I was sick. I figured it was some girl scout selling cookies.
No.
Why would I want to kill Elliot?
That's hardly reason to kill somebody.
I knocked on his door, and I asked him to turn down that classical crap. He refused. I overreacted. I apologized. Charges were dropped.  I swear.

Sometimes.
I don't remember.
We share it. It's our car.
About this one or all the others? I knew that she was different. And I wasn't about to let some kid walk away with my marriage so I called her up, took her for a ride explained the facts of life to her-- wife, three kids, mortgage. She said it was over, she was going home. Didn't say why; I didn't ask.
No. I wanted to. I almost did. She went to get out of the car.
You are 18. What the hell do you know about love?
I stopped her. Apologized. We talked. And I dropped her off.

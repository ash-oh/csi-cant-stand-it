Can I smoke in here?
Last night. We go to my folks' house every Sunday.
We talked about it. I told him I didn't want him to do it. But he found out about this girl, what the gang did to her.
He said it was a secret.
No. Well ... sort of. I told my mom and dad and my best friend, Jenny. She's my hairdresser. I tell her everything.
Did I do something wrong?
I already told you why I wasn't in that car. My husband and I were arguing. He was yelling at me.
Okay, I'm having a hard time keeping it straight. You do like my dress? You don't like my dress?
When should we talk about it?
No, I'm not going to get in the car.
Oh, three hun--
No. Not until you apologize. Apologize to my parents!
My dad says I was lucky.
I don't like where this is going.
I loved my husband. I didn't kill him, okay? You don't know me. You don't know my life.
How could you?!
You son of a bitch! You were gonna kill your own daughter?!
Over money so you could get our business?!
Well, you didn't try to stop me! You just stood there!
Don wanted to give you the money; I said no! And all those nights Mom and I stayed up talking -- it was about you!
I hate you!
Go to hell!

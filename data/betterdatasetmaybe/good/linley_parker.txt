Help!
Help me! Please somebody help me!
Somebody help me!
4-4-6. That's all I got. Nevada plates. Some kind of SUV. Black, I think.
I was, um, driving home from work.
There's hardly any traffic once you cross horizon ranch. He was tailgating.
I slowed down to let him pass ...
... and he hit me.
I wasn't going to stop, but he did, so I ... 
... pulled over. You're not supposed to leave the scene of an accident. He looked like a normal guy. He asked if I was okay. Apologized. He went to his car to get his insurance information. I was looking at my bumper.
He punched me in the face, threw me over his shoulder.
I lost my shoes.
He threw me on the ground, took off my jacket, ripped open my shirt.
He kept trying to kiss me on the mouth, and I kept turning away. So he bit my ear.
He wanted me to look at him. He was going to kill me.
He ripped off my skirt. He raped me.
He didn't use a condom. He got up to zip, and I kicked him in the groin and I ran. And the rest, I guess you know.
Yes.
He had bright eyes.
Almond. Tiny pupils.
He had a baby face. High forehead, thin lips, clean-shaven.
There's something wrong with the nose.
That one.
Yeah.
It's number three. 
That's the guy who raped me.
You're letting him go? Why?
Yes, he is. I identified him.
Then you made a mistake. That man raped me.
I saw him. He wanted me to see his face.
He wanted me to see his face because he was going to kill me, and now you're letting him go?
This isn't gonna keep him away from me. What I need is protection. I need a gun.
I can't wait 72 hours for a gun. I need it today! I need it now!
Hold on.
Fremont Street. I-I know you can help me. Just-
Stop!

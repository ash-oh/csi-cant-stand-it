I've been down here dancing for hours. Ask anybody.
Come on, man!
I came stag.
If I want a date, I'll get one in there. You know how many couples break up at homecoming? I looked it up. It's like ten percent. It's staggering.
Please -- the girl's a scarf. Always hanging on the neck of anyone with loot.
Guess everybody wanted in on that party. And Nikki wasn't on the list.
Janelle's always taking in strays.
I have no idea. You know, when I busted outta there, she was still up there chillin' with the rest of them.
What are you accusing me of, eating french toast? What, eating carbs is against the law now?
I don't know anything about that. My prints are in that room because it was Deano's room. He got it so we'd have a place to bring the ladies after the dance.
Deano rat me?
Look, we were playing around. I bus tables every day after school, all right? A grand's a lot of dough for me. You know, this was a joke.
I don't know.
After the kidnapping. Janelle planted one on my lips. You know, to thank me. I felt it was more than that. You know, I felt a vibe. I gave her an hour to chill, then I called her. Asked her if I could bring her anything. She said she was kind of hungry, so I told her I'd bring her something sweet to eat, other than me.
For a couple seconds, I thought I was in. 
Then she got a voice mail ... checked it and flipped out.
I figured that was my cue to bolt, so I rolled back down to the dance to continue with the honeys I was already working. I haven't seen Janelle since. I swear to god.

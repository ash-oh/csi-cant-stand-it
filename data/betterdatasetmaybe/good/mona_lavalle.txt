You need to tell him. The truth goes a long way.
Eddie, would you take over?
In the sanctuary alliance I saw an eritrean girl who had her labia sewn shut. I looked into her eyes and I found a cause. Six thousand women a day suffer genital mutilation.
You don't have to travel to find the genitally disenfranchised.
Wendy came to me. She was denied surgery. That's devastating. I tried to help her work through that.
By working with her on what made her an unacceptable candidate.
Patience.
Last night. 7:00 to 8:00 for her individual consultation.
She was agitated. She was worried about whether her fianc√©e would receive her well on their wedding night.
I don't recommend what we call 'passing.' I suggested that Aaron come at a group. Wendy was adamant that he never know the truth.
No, never. That would violate the doctor-patient privilege.
I haven't been Karl Benway for a very long time.
I never said I wasn't there. I attended Vern's surgery. He was ... terrified. I tried to calm him.
I'm a counselor.
I've devoted my life to helping those who are cast out by gender prejudice. Where would these souls be without me? Who will stand in judgment? As to who's a candidate and who's not. Dr. Mercer? I was the only one willing to help them. I was nineteen in the rice paddies of Vietnam ... sewing legs back on grunts.  I performed abortions in Mexico ... on rape victims when the church turned its back on them. I have been doing gender reassignment surgery for ten years.
Vern was an unfortunate tragedy. I have no idea what happened to Wendy.
That's impossible. After I saw Wendy at the clinic, I went straight to my daughter's soccer game. I have nothing more to say.

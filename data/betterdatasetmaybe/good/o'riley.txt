We were waiting for you. Meet Ronnie Connors.
I understand you fine. So, you're the part-time cook here?  How many days a week do you work at the temple?
You have a key?
Too trusting. In this neighborhood, yeah. They ever have any problems with gangs?
Why not?
'Monks are too trusting.'
Dylan Buckley-- 14 years old.
'Burglary in progress' call. Once we made entry, we found the victim downstairs. Never knew this place existed.
Trying to get them to turn some more lights on in here.
The curator's across town. He's on his way. She looks dead to me.
Oh, yeah. Watching her. Set off the alarm, trying to get in the cage.
Answer the question.
Ever since you killed Veronica.
Opportunity. So, you mix up a batch of ricin put it in a salt shaker. Next time you're breaking bread, she asks for the salt ... 
Wallet was with the vic. Money, cards, I.D.'S. Name's Roger Edmonds. Car's his, too.
To get in or get out?
Waitress phoned it in.
So?
Then what?
Camper top.
50 caliber.
Feel like hunting for a bullet?
That camper-top pickup was reported stolen. The R.O. is a Ned Bookman. Lives in Henderson.
Gets better. Ned Bookman and our vic live on the same street.
Ignition block's intact. No sign of forced entry.
Like what?
I thought it was your perfume.
Like we said, your truck's not here. Why did you report it stolen?
Now how well did you know the victim?
This guy Kraft's had a dozen complaints filed against him by residents on the block. Property line disputes, petty thefts, one assault.
Yeah.
Creative parking?
Frank Kraft?
Detective O'Riley. Vegas P.D. This is Catherine Willows from the crime lab. We'd like to have a few words with you.
No, we're just talking here.
Nice fellow.
Kraft scares the crap out of the guy.
Boiled down, basically he said Kraft and the vic had a pretty bad history.
Only that it was always chained up in the yard. And always barking.
What about the tire marks?
Oh, that won't get you a warrant, either.
Desert Eagle.
Guys ... 
Passing motorist heard gunshots. First officer did a drive up. Found the scene. Called in the world. I hope you brought extra supplies.
You're gonna be here awhile.
No cash, no I.D., just a driver's permit. 
Fifteen-and-a-half. Timmy McCallum. Coroner's on his way.
Evidence says you were there. You want to go down for suspicion of murder?
Or you want to stop digging your own grave?
We get a warrant, and we're going to strip you down to nothing, then ask you to bend over-- choose.
You take off your shirt, please?
I'm not. A kid's dead. Back to the question. How'd you get the shiner?
Who was the shooter?
You can tell us and save yourself, or you can let the tape tell us. It's your call.
Why didn't you call an ambulance?
So, you just left him for dead?
You sure about that?
Come on, Cath. Everybody liked Mathers for the Kent and Reese cases but the DA wouldn't file because he already had a slam dunk with Charlene Roth. How many times can you fry a guy?
Maintenance guy thought it was trash. Picked it up, broke open.
Randy Watkins. I'm Detective O'Riley. This is Nick Stokes of the crime lab.
Let me trade that bracelet in for this one.
Soup's on.
Roommates last saw him Thursday night. Took off for the weekend. Came home to this.
Roommate said only the hot water faucet was on.
Still is.
Wayne, you want to tell us about the game Friday night?
We have a witness that said you guys had a beef. Specifically, you and number seven.
I suppose your buddies will testify to that?
You're not under arrest. You're free to go.
Like shooting fish in a barrel. Almost guaranteed to run into one of his skips or some lowlife who knows ere they are.
Drive and dump.

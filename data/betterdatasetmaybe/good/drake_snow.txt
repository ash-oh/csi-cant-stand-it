Mike and Kyle -- they made all their money out of Laurel taking it off. She-she was a cash register in panties is what she was.
No. Trust me. The last thing that I wanted was to be partners with Mike. Guy'd ... would chew you up and spit you out soon as look at you.
Forget it. Guy'd tell you right to your face he's sticking it to you. Pasadena, baby. I got my own plans. I-I just ... I just need a location. One location.
Didn't ask him. Last time I asked him for something, he took a swing at me.
I just want the same shot that you had, Mike. Laurel said that ...
Yeah. So, I wasn't going to make that mistake again, so I had to try something different. So, I pulled a Geffen. I went straight to Yoko.
Yeah. She was going to give it to Mike. He was going to sign it, and they were going to get it back to me. So much for that.
Hey, look. I know where you're going with this. Okay, I was in the bedroom. She wasn't on her knees. I was. I was begging. Not for s*x. I was begging for my business. Drake the Snake Productions. Mike comes busting in, goes ballistic, smacks me in the nose ... 
Laurel and I didn't have s*x in the bedroom. We had it on the set- past tense -- long time ago. 
Mike was good for Laurel. Mike was not good for me. She got carte blanche -- Laurel. Me, I got a bar back. Now I'm popping blue pills looking for something to bring me down, but I know the business. I just don't have the capital to get behind the camera.
Zero. No one was more upset than me.
What?
I don't know what you're talking about. I don't. I smoke one place, okay? I smoke at work. I'm down to one a day. Right after happy hour, I have my one cigarette, and it's out back by the service register. You ask anybody.

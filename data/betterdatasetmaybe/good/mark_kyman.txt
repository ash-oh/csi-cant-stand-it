Lori hadn't gotten out much since Joey was born. She needed some time away from the baby, and from me.
He's going to need his bottle soon.
No. Uh, I, uh, I manage the steakhouse at the Tangiers. I got home around nine. My mother-in-law was taking care of Joey.
Yeah, she's on her way over.
Yeah. Said she missed him. Said she was going to be home at eleven. I, uh, passed out on the couch waiting for her.
I, uh, I woke up, must have been about 2:00. I called her on her cell. No answer. And then I called Amy.  And then I called you guys.
We, uh, only have one car right now. My lease ran out.
They found her car off Boulder Highway.
This is Diane, Lori's mom.
He's with Amy.
What do I do?
Joey just fell asleep, so please, keep your voices down.
Yeah, Lori thought it'd be good for a boy's room.
What's going on?
You're coming after me? Because I've cooperated. I've let you swab my mouth and let you take my prints. I love my wife. I miss her.

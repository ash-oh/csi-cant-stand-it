He was alone last night. We talked at about 3:00 in the morning. He said he got off work early and was going to bed, and he'd call me when he woke up. But he never did.
If he's a mechanic, maybe he worked on some of Jason's limos.
He was a limo driver before that, long time ago.
He had all kinds of fake IDs. Drove his first long one at 18. The owner of the limo company liked Jason. Made him a VIP driver. Celebs liked Jason. He could take his clients to a Motel 6 and it'd be the hottest spot in town. Wasn't long before the club owners invested in Jason, made him a group partner, gave him his own spot. Then two, then five. Suddenly, he's running the whole club scene.  I guess I should say he ran the club scene. He's not going to be running anything anymore.
I told you the truth. 
The feds told me to forget I ever had the Pezzulo name.
I wasn't about to remember it for you. My husband had more cops than capos on his payroll.
Feds felt we'd actually be safer here. They thought if we left, we might suffer the same consequences as Anthony.
Jason was three years old when Anthony died. He never even knew his father.
That's BB.
BB didn't kill Jason. There's no way. He was Anthony's friend.
I haven't seen BB in 23 years.
I gave that stuff to Lou Gedda.
Of course, they were both on Anthony's crew, but they would never ...
I haven't had any contact with him since Anthony died.
Gedda and I had an agreement. He was to keep away from our family. Forget Jason and I ever existed.

You're next, hon.
Ooh-ee. Izzy Delancy. Hoity-toity, hmm? It's a real shame what happened to him, huh? Were you there for all that nonsense?
Too bad, huh?
You're a little lawbreaker. Says here, you ... uh ... prefer to be paid in cash. You like working off the books, huh? Good ol' Uncle Sam probably not too happy about that, huh?
Uh, uh, uh, ooh, uh, uh.
You speak English, you got all your papers. No, fine. It's fine. But in a seriousness, you wouldn't mind having your fingerprints done? See, we were lucky enough to get a contract for the municipal buildings downtown. You know, mayor's office, police department.
But, you know, they require a background check for anyone going to work in that building, even temps.
Yeah ... Listen, hon, you seem like a real nice girl, real nice, but we're called Platinum Maids for a reason. I-I just don't see the sparkle.
You clean in between the blinds?
After just one time?
Okay. Describe the reception area.
You sit tight. I got some choices for you.

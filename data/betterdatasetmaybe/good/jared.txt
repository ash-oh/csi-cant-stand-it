Yo, Dawg, we going or what?
Yeah. 
Yup. We got this fancy system 'cause people steal 'em. I'm the only one with a remote. So ... 
I spend all day unlocking 'em.  Which one is it?
Murder?
Couple of kids were playing around the 'mat, making trouble. I chased them out. What happened after that ... I don't know.
Okay, look, I'm supposed to be on duty the whole time. But this customer -- he was gettin' all pissed off.
Hey, will you get the hell out of here?
So I went next door. Had to get the smell of detergent out of my nose. Bought a Yoo-Hoo. I came back to check on things. 
I didn't know if he was dead or not.
You have any idea what the liability would be on something like that?
I was just hoping that somebody would find him and take care of him.

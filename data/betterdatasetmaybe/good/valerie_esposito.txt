What's going on? 
Maybe we got identity theft-ed or something.
Hey, hey, leave that candy alone.
What? 
Hey, let go of me. 
Let go of me, huh! What the hell is going on here? 
Get away from him. Get away from him!
Adam!
Adam! 
No, please.  Get away from my kid!
Yeah, whatever. Can I see Adam now?
Yeah. My kid.
Who the hell do you think I am?
Give me a break. Twenty-six hours in labor. Finally had a c-section.
Where'd she get this picture of Adam? How'd she get it?
No, she wouldn't have stalked us to Cape May. This isn't it. It's the only shore we've been to.
Yeah, that's the shirt his Nana gave him last summer. He only wore it that once, at our family reunion.
We just had Adam's birthday party there last month.
You told me you were taking him for ice cream. What were you doing in the park?
A guy? Oh, my God. You're putting money down on a game? You promised you'd quit.
Well, you should have just took him for ice cream.

Chloe Daniels. What can I do for you?
Yeah, she used to work here.
Hairdresser.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, well, it's not. 
Look, I didn't invent this. Go on line -- there are dozens of sites with thousands of women. They advertise these exciting trips to Kiev. I just bring Kiev to you. I sponsor 90-day work VISAs, teach the girls a trade. They cut hair for men.
You pick up a woman at a bar, does the bartender screen you? You take her home, take her to your bed. How well did you screen her?
Yeah. Ken Wellstone. Lives down the street. Actually comes in for haircuts. Isn't interested in my service. Not the marrying kind, I guess.
When is marriage anything else?
Really?  Well, what do you think engagement rings are? Just proof that a man can pay for his bride. Look, caveman would go steal a woman from a neighboring clan. He'd tie her hands and her feet till she wouldn't run away. Once she'd stay put, he would only tie her finger, just to remind her.
Marriage is not romance. It's a contract with the state. It's an investment in your future. 
I'm not making it about money, it just is.
What's all this about?
Let them in.

Couple of weeks.
Yeah, I can see why. It's very romantic.
Don't get territorial. It's for my own personal collection.
Hey, I'll give you a hand.
Yeah, according to Sunburst Taxi one of the drivers dropped off the clown here two days ago.
Mmm.
Did you get his name?
Hey, excuse me.
Take a look.
Look, you do have the right to remain silent, but unless you want a trip to the station, I really wouldn't keep it up.
Yeah, what did you do after you left the Maguires?
You didn't stop by his house? You know, wait for him to come back?
It's all yours.
Yeah.
We figured you must've walked in on them ... in flagrante.
Hey, power went out about an hour ago.
We're working on it, ma'am. We'll have someone up very soon, okay?
Hot plate? Electrocution. That's a quick way to go.
You got a name?
Looks like he was getting ready to skip town on you.
Wallet's empty.
Doesn't add up to much.
Hey. If Lance Frazer won fifty grand, I can't find it. It's not in his room, no bank account, no car.
12:30.
Had to take him ten minutes just to walk back home.
Daniel Halburt! We've got a warrant to search the premises! Open up!
Get out!
Clear!
Vic is Paul Charles, 28. Competition bodybuilder and personal trainer. Doors were all locked, windows closed. No sign of forced entry.
Gwen, did you see anyone else near the house when you arrived? 
So, why didn't you get another trainer?
Did you and Paul ever get physical?
Or gay.
So your business goes bust and Mr. Basengi evicts you.
Well, today, it's all 3-d interactive. You know, I got kids.
No.
We haven't been able to find her. You know where she is?
So you were angry at her, you were angry at him.
You must have wanted it back. Hey, did you stop by the store last night?
She didn't leave town after all. You want to revise your story?
Your girlfriend was paying rent on her back and you didn't like it.
We don't care why you killed her.
Basengi evicts you, keeps your stuff and now you've got a big problem.
Yeah.
You mind baby-sitting him while I get a warrant?

Hey. Now you guys aren't here to make me look bad, are you?
Just busting chops. Sheriff Beth McGuire.
Hi. I just read that file that you sent over. Jay Finch, he looks like a real son of a bitch. Laura Montoya, she was a good friend of mine. So, uh ...
Hey, Ronnie. How you doing?
I would really be happy to see this case solved.
Okay. Uh ... Laura ... and her daughter were right ... here eating burgers and drinking shakes. They were the last customers of the night.
Luke Hanson closed up, and then he left and they were still right here, eating.
And I was called about 10:00 p.m. Couple of local skateboarders. They saw the blood and they just, you know, called it in.
No. Just a blood pool ... here.  I found some blood drops leading out through the parking lot towards the main road.
I don't know. One minute, my best friend is just having an Oreo smoothie with her kid, and then the next minute all I got is blood drops.
We sent a sample to the Reno Lab. Came back a match to Laura.

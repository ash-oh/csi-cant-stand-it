I'll be right with you.  The tests will be mailed to you in seven days, and they'll include a toll-free number if you have any questions.
Walk-ins? Or do you have an appointment?
Actually, we don't do the testing. Common mistake. I'm contracted by Adminalab to withdraw blood, and the lab processes. And the whole thing is confidential, so ...
I'm the only tech here.
What does that have to do with me?
I ... know who you're talking about.
I'd taken more than enough for testing purposes, so, I figured it's her blood. Why not just give it to her?
Great. You going to report me? 
Uh, you can't go in there.
Th-th-that's my personal fridge.
I bet you don't have a warrant for that.
It's not a crime to drink someone's blood.
When Angela came in for her HIV test, she asked me to withdraw an extra unit. She paid me twenty bucks to store it, and never came back to pick it up.
Most girls turn away when I stick the needle in.
She was into it.
I started watching over her. She was dating this wannabe total hollywood freak show.
These don't come 
I was born with these.
The poser just took off.
She ... invited me in.
She was glad to see me.
We kissed.
She, um ... 'offered' herself to me.
Yeah.
You can't prove that.
I released Angela from her body. She's inside of me now. A part of me. And she's very much alive.

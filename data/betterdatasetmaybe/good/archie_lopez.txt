So what?
Yeah.
Hmm. My heart bleeds.
Yeah, I'm probably still drunk, yeah. Must have been the tequila. I don't drink that much.
I wanted to surprise Lydia. Manager gave me a key.
And then I left.
I went to the hotel bar.
That's where I saw Patty.
That woman's been to my house. She's eaten my food. She smiled in my face, all the time ... all the time knowing that Lydia was banging someone else.
I went somewhere else. I drank some more. I drank ... a lot, I guess. I don't ... I don't remember anything.

I don't even pay attention to the talent. I just drive down Industrial Boulevard, from strip club to strip club, picking 'em up. It's like bus stops. Before you know it, we're full, the bus is on fire ...
We call it the 'champagne ride.'
It's nice.
The girls, they make uh ... at least twice as much as they do in the clubs, so ... 
Oh ... 
Usually, it's the guys that are getting off.
When the guy paying the tab says he wants to stop, I just stop.
Look, strippers are tough chicks, okay? I figured she'd find a way home, one way or another.

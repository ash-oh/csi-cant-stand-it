That's Carla.
Nah. The girl in the picture there told me her name was Carla.
Yeah, I guess so. Yeah.
I don't know about friends. I mean, her and every other girl in here jocks 'em. I mean, Extremo, bro, they're the best. Come on.
No, I got the night off. I'm gonna go party today. So, you guys, uh, still looking for Carla?
No?
Uh, yeah, that's the full-blown cocino mobile.
Ooh, um ... you guys want me to show you?
What? Seven dollars an hour?
It was the perfect opportunity, bro...
Immortality, bro. See, I-I'm not gonna die a barback, or a dishwasher ...
Yeah, maybe so, but they're gonna write a song about me. I'm gonna go down in history.
Look, I gave it my own twist, though. Uh ... 'cause I-I'm an original.
machuque el perro con la lengua de la culebra... 
tome el premio 
de lo que hecho 
le pregunte yo a malverde ... 
para quemar mis pecados ... 
... immortal.

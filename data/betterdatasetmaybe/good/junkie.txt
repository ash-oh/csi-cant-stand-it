What if I do? What'll it get me?
Hey, no need to get hostile.
Will it at least get me a ride home?
Okay, okay. I-I do a lot of business at the Lucky Seven Motel. And that guy checked in last night. He scored a little something to help get him some sleep. But he didn't pay. He just flashed his piece.
Yeah. He wanted a ... a girl, and I gave him a number. That dude's bad news. I want to give him to you.

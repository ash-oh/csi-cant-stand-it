I can't believe this is happening. Mark has a job. There's no reason for him to be on the lake during a work day.
What are you saying? That he killed this girl? What is this?!
Yesterday morning. He came by, got something to eat and he left. I mean, at this age, I can't keep track of him.
Mr. Stokes, my son is not a criminal.
A warrant?
You can take whatever you want. Mark didn't hurt that girl.
Thanks.

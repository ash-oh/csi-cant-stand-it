All rise. Honorable Judge Douglas Mason presiding ... Municipal Court, City of Mulberry, State of Nevada. 
Next up, People V. Landry. Are all the parties present?

Warrick Brown?
Two minutes grace, the court moves on.

Uh, yeah, that's why they're here. It's their nickel. I mean, they got to have something. They're away from their families. 
I have all their cell phone ... well, almost all of them. Caught a guy double packing.

Hey, I confiscated his primary at the beginning of deliberations, but I don't do cavity searches.
Hey. What did you order?
Defendant shall rise.
Raise your right hand. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, so help you God?

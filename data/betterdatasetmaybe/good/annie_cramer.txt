You look good, Jimmy.
Oh, yeah, well, I couldn't take another Jersey winter.
Or another Jersey cop.
You know, dirty cops don't like to hang with clean ones.
I thought what you did took a lot of guts. Integrity is, um, hard to come by in vice.
Garden of Eden. Temptation kills you, or it compromises you.
California Coastal Commission specialty plates. I'll run it through DMV. Cross reference with BMWs. In the meantime, I pulled Dakota's rap sheet.
They both do.
She, uh, works a stretch on Hollywood Boulevard between Highland and Vine. 
When was the last time you saw Ellie, Jimmy?
Here. Last known address. In case you don't have it.
Hey, Jim.
We found the beemer. Found these two kids trying to hotwire it. Whale tail license plate starting with One-T-A.
I'll talk, you listen.
All right, what the hell's the matter with you? You looking to die young? 'Cause you can do it inside in lock-up or outside with this wanna-be gang banger stealing cars crap.
You like playing with cars, huh? LAPD's having a car wash fund-raiser on Saturday. You just signed yourselves up. You're welcome.
Come on.
Jimmy, windows are already broken. Someone's got to fix 'em.
Looks like a country club or something. Doesn't read like Koreatown. I'll have my guys run the plates.
Not yet.
Doesn't look good for Ellie's friend.
Good to meet you.
Thanks.
Same here.
You still a scotch man?
I understand, but we're investigating a possible homicide here.
We're not interested in whether it's positive or negative. We need it for the DNA.
Excuse me.
Yeah. Kramer.
You're kidding me. Terrific. Okay. We're on it. Bye.
We got an R.O. on the car.
Hey, Todd.
I, uh, stumbled across something. Thought I'd pay you a house call. You missing a car?
You didn't report it.
What's that about?
I'm sorry, this is an old friend of mine, Captain Jim Brass, Vegas P.D.
Okay.
Koreatown.
Hey, Todd, I don't suppose we could take a look around?
Oh, yeah? Well, we don't have enough.
You know, give me a break. You know how many cars get jacked in L.A. every day? He admitted to being with a prostitute. What makes you think he's not telling the truth about the rest?
Your gut can talk to my Judge. Or better yet, talk to Ellie. You should. You should get the 4-1-1 on Dakota from her.
We eat steak.
Tony, how are you doing? Table for two, please, in the back, if you could.
I'm doing you a big favor.
Hey, Judge Peters. What a nice surprise.
Good to see you. How's that porterhouse?
Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet an old friend of mine, Captain Jim Brass, LVPD.
This is Judge Silvio Peters, Councilman Joe Cohen.
Comptroller Daniel Reichmann, and Vic Patterson.
Remember how great he was as that cop?
Like he was playing you.
Listen, since I happened to run into you ... we found Todd Piccone's car just off of Vermont. Had bullet holes and blood in the trunk. He claims it was stolen, but I'm hoping that I could get a look around his house a bit ... 
Finish your steak before it gets cold.
Enjoy your lunch, gentlemen. Nice to see you.
Strike one, your turn.
We're here on official business. Just let us in.
You and Dakota have the same pimp?
Look, if she were gonna pull a con with some guy, who would it be?
So other than her customers, there's, what, no men in her life? You and she are ...
Where do we find this Casanova?
Look, you know I can't go in there without probable cause or a warrant.
Jimmy, what are you hoping to find in there?
Yep.
L.A. has over two hundred criminalists. You got to bring your own guy?
If this goes to court, Warrick's going to have to come back and testify.
So meth dealer and his hooker girlfriend looking for a quick score. Carjacking's not such a stretch. Neighbors are lucky he didn't blow the whole building up.
Well, we'll haul him in on manufacturing. We'll get what we can out of him.
Drop the gun! Now!
Drop the gun!
Come on.
How long has the body been here? 
Yeah, he's detoxing in the tank. 
This is why I don't believe in easy money. 
Ellie.
No, come here. Come on. Look, I just need an answer. Is this your friend?
You have a prior. Mandatory minimum for manufacturing -- ten to fifteen.
You start to talk about Dakota, we'll see what we can do.
Not before you killed her.
You have a relationship with her?
Where were you two nights ago?
Be more specific!
Dakota?
You like BMWs?
Watch your mouth! I'll lay it out for you.
I'm sorry you had to hear that.
You want to say I told you so?
Sorry, Todd. We got the warrant; we have to search.
No.
Nobody loses that much blood and lives.
So, you admit to having sexual relations with Sasha Reynolds, A.K.A. Dakota?
But money changed hands?
For what?
And then?
Does this friend have a name?
You know, Todd, I think you're smart enough to recognize consciousness of guilt.  Blood in your house, in your car. All of which was cleaned up. This friend worth going to prison for?
Officer.
He invoked.
About six months ago, this strung-out hooker comes into the PD, beat to crap, screaming that Vic Patterson had done it, and her wounds looked a lot like this. I figured it was her pimp, she was sniffing around for a settlement. Sent her home with an ice pack.
I worked my whole life to sit at the table with the big boys ... only to find out that the food is poisoned.
Eight back in Jersey, fifteen here.
What am I gonna do then? Knit? This is it, Jimmy. This is all I got.
Of course I do. Broke my heart when I found out he was dirty. 
I thought I did that.
And you thought a kid would help?
Yeah, you did. I don't see Mike O'Toole out here helping her.
So it's my neck now.

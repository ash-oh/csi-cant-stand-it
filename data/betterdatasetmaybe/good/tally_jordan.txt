Oh, my God. Come on.
You call my cell, I answer, and we talk. And then you guys show up and arrest me at the pool, in front of my friends. Is that fair?
I'm not a prostitute.
Okay, this is crazy. I would never even think of killing Julian Harper. I've been a fan of his since he was doing cereal commercials.
I'm in Vegas for a speech tournament -  -- Okay, a school-supervised trip. Does that mean that my school is stalking him, too?
When I found out that Julian was going to be in Vegas at the same time I was, I freaked. Okay, I wanted a look, an autograph, or a picture at most. And what I got was incredible.
It was like I was in one of his movies. Until he kicked me out of bed and ... and then I get off the elevator, and there's his manager handing me a wad of money.
I had s*x with Julian because I wanted to.
Eva said if anyone asked, Julian was a gentleman. Later he took me out and got me a Katherine Baumann purse. It's a much better story to tell my friends.

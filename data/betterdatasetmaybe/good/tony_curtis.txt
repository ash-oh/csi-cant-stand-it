Me, dress up in drag? Who do you think you're talking to, Jack Lemmon?
Anyway, we had a good time in those days, you know? You could walk down the streets in this town 15, 20 years ago with 50,000 bucks stacked on the top of your head in singles, and nobody would bother you.  Except this guy. He would bother you.
Take it easy.

Certainly.

Housekeeping. Coming in.
Yes. I was in the bathroom.
I waited for him to leave. Then I called security.
My husband, please. Yeah. I have to tell my husband! Oh, please. Call my husband!
I had my hands full. I don't take my eyes off him ever.
But there was this man near the swings -- he kept looking around like he was waiting for something.
He was a white guy, blue baseball cap ... that's all I remember.
Yeah. A boy. Could be that boy.  Mm ... it's hard to tell.
You're welcome.

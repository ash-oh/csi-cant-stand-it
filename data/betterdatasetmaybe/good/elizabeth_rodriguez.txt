All right, well, don't wait up for me.
And I'll miss you.
It never fails.
When I fight a dog, I fight to win.
You cheating little bitch. You been doing this all night?
If I ever catch you cheating again, I will feed your heart to that dog.
That last fight wasn't on the up. Next dog's not right either. You forfeit.

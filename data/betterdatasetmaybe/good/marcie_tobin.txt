How does that make any sense? I mean, why would somebody put a bomb in my car?
Have you reached my husband?
I was on my way to my father's office. 
On Thursdays we have dinner and then I help him with his payroll.
Excuse me? 
My car is making a really strange noise.
Why?
Why?
In my house, in my garage.
Just me... and my husband. But Johnny had nothing to do with this. He's been at work all day. You can ask him as soon as he gets here.
You know, since my car blew up everybody is in my business. All of a sudden, everybody has something to say. You know, an opinion, a theory. My life is an open book and my father wants me to hire a bodyguard. For what? To protect me From who? You know what I think? Someone put the bomb in the wrong car. I think they confused our house with somebody else's because stranger things have happened.
Yeah. Sorry.
Uh, we don't have any secrets.
... oh, my god. My father shouldn't have said anything.
Johnny, you know what? I, um ... a couple of weeks ago I thought that maybe Johnny was fooling around just because he was never home ... 
And never interested ...
I know. I know.
And you know what? You shouldn't put too much stock in this because every couple has their problems. 
Just take what you need.
Why would I put a bomb in my car?
Why would I do that?
This is absurd. 
He's not my friend.
So what if I made a bomb? That's not a crime.
60 seconds.
Look, I'm fine, and my husband is fine, and it was my car that exploded so does this ... really need to go any further?

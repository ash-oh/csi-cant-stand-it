Yes.
I'm his fiancée. We always got those looks. I'm five-seven, in case you were wondering.
Yes. But I wanted to be near Lawrence's things.
Yes.
No.
You don't believe me?
No champagne for me. I'm ... pregnant. Only seven weeks. SARA: Is this your computer, or Lawrence's?
Lawrence's.
A lot of girls liked Lawrence. He was funny and smart and sweet.
You're making that up.
I did not put a noose around my fiancé's neck.
I can't.
That's what they told me, but I couldn't believe it. I still can't.
The night before he died, Lawrence and I had a fight about Danielle.
Are still in contact with her?
You're cheating on me!
And I ran out of the house and I went to my dad. I was crying and he told me to leave Lawrence but I couldn't because ... I ... I loved him. And I'm having our baby. And I went back to our room and we made up. 
And the next night ... he said he was going out to meet a friend.
And he never came back.

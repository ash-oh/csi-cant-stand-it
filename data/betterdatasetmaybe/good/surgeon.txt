Captain Brass was shot twice. First bullet lodged in his vest. Second entered through his axilla, hit an artery, and is lodged near his heart. He's has internal hemorrhaging.
We won't know until we stop the bleeding. If we stop it. 
You may have a decision to make.  I'll let you know.
We managed to stop the bleeding, but his condition is critical.
We could try to remove the bullet.
If we go in, the vertebral artery could be impacted. He could bleed out or stroke out. Permanent incapacitation.
The bullet could migrate into the artery and, again, cause a stroke or kill him. Or it could stay there for years and do nothing. He might never wake up.
Mr. Grissom, this isn't a casino. I don't give odds. It's your call.

Ty hasn't been here for the last two days. Didn't even call in. This is his desk. It's really not like him. Is he okay?
Yeah. Puts in more hours than anybody.
I don't know. It never really came up. Something happened to him, didn't it?
He's worked here over a year, never raised his voice. Then this strange-looking customer came in. Ty must've known him ...
Nobody's touched it since. Should be the last entry.
That's Emma, Ty's girlfriend. Well, ex-girlfriend. They broke up last year. Here we go. Last customer was a Joseph Diamond. Booking a trip to Australia-Sydney-one way.

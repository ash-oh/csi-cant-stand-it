This is about what I can do for you.
I've asked the mayor to give you a commendation. Medal of Valor. Congratulations.
As a matter of protocol, I'd say you damn well better be, Captain.
Look, I'm going to say a few nice things, hand you a plaque, we'll shake hands, a whole lot of reporters will be there to take pictures of the big event. It'll be magic.
My office will call you to set it up.

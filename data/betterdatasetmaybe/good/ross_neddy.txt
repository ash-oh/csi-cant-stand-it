My name's Charlie, Charlie Keefer.
I got ID. It's in my jeans.
Daddy will be right there, sweetheart.
Body parts? No way. I thought those cuts were from, like, an autopsy.
I've been out two months and the best job I can get is five bucks an hour welding engine parts together. They wouldn't even let me flip burgers. Heidi just had the baby. It wasn't like it was gonna hurt anyone.
We dug up someone my age, took him to work. Made him look like me. And then we torched it.
All I was looking for was a fresh start. Best way to make it happen was to kill myself.

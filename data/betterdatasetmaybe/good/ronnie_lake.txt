Do you ever wonder why ants don't crawl up the nose, eat the brains? I would. Protein.
You think dead skin tastes better than brains?
Do ants have taste buds?
Really?
Yeah. Ronnie Lake.
I think that's my dad's favorite movie.
Bye.
So anyway, when I graduated I got offers from both the labs in New York and Miami. Know why I picked Vegas?
Crime rate's growing faster here.
All of his ... um ... valuables in a rubber-band wad. No ID.
I was getting there.

Hi.  I faxed the DB's photo to various indigent organizations. Shelter on Rancho and Main ID'd him as a regular. Their special this week was socks and sandwiches. Rancho and Main is less than a mile from where we found him. Bum got into a fight -- business as usual -- and died of exposure, right? Oops, that was a question.

Perimortem abrasions ... parallel, double rails. It's handcuffs. Cops must have picked him up before he died.

Turquoise and silver beads. I got the matching necklace at the Indian market in Santa Fe.
67.5 inches.
Check out the third vertebrosternal rib, left side. Isn't that a bullet hole? 
For real? My first Mob hit. Cool. 
Yeah.
Buckskin. Maybe your ME was wrong.
Sara told me to document the detritus, but I see you beat me to it.
Whatever it was, we must have collected it, right? It's definitely not a gun.
Cigarette lighter?
I don't get it -- what's the thrill here? It's always hot babes with huge breasts falling out of their shirts, getting hacked up ...

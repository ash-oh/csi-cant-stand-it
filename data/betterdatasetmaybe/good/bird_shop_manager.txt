I love you.  I love you.  I love you.
Although the cockatoo is intelligent, birds don't speak. To speak requires a cognitive ability to understand, which they don't. They just imitate. And Edweena is a she. How can I help you?
Well, you came to the right place. 'Buy Buy Birdie''s the only exotic bird store in Clark County. 
No. Why?
Very rare. In my whole career, I've only sold one.
Sure. Mr. Beckman. He's in here all the time. Bob likes to eat cashews out of my pocket. Mr. Beckman doesn't go anywhere without Bob.

Macaws only molt one tail feather at a time. Get a pile like this, someone yanked. Real hard.

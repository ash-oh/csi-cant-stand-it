I'm sorry, uh, who are you?
Oh. I'm Dr. Franks, attending. Have you located his family yet?
I need to find someone to sign a release, take him off the ventilator.
Oh, yeah. I'm hoping the family will donate his organs.
He's got blunt-force trauma to the frontal and sphenoid bones.
It fragmented his skull, damaged his temporal arteries and imbedded in his brain.
Well, he came from county lock-up. Must have been a hell of a fight.
I assure you your son has no brain activity, Mr. Mendez. He's gone.
Either he can't accept reality or the county made a big mistake.
Well, the lab just confirmed his blood is positive for atropine. So I'm starting him on an IV drip of physostigmine.
Right when he came in.
Saved it for you. It's in the biohazard bag.
All right, bullet wound. Let's see what the paramedics left me.
Irregular laceration, subcutaneous tissue only. A few millimeters deeper, it would have nicked the intercostal artery.
Yeah. Would've been a real mess. You're a lucky man. Flush out the wound, dress it with 4 x 4 gauze, start an IV, hang cefazolin and get some blood work done. Oh, and get him a tetanus shot.

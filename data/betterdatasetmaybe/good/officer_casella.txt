That's me.
Well, sure, I touched it.
Uh ... I'm sorry, what do you mean?
Okay, are you trying to jam me up?
I got it doing my job.
A couple of train wrecks were slugging it out over this crap sandwich. I try to save them from themselves, but no good deed goes unpunished, so ... uh ... one of 'em takes a poke at me.
So I cuff him up, I check his ID. I'm ready to run him in, but my partner says to drop it.
He says this is an old bum trick, right, like take a swing at a cop, you go to jail where they have AC, they have food, they have water. I can't believe I almost fell for that.

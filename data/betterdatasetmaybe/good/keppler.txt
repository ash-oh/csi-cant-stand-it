My eggs are runny. I couldn't have been more specific with the waitress.  You gonna eat those?
Thank you.
We could try something I did in Philly. It's, um, a little unorthodox.
Philly, yes. Baltimore, no.
It's called 'reverse forensics.'
Basically.
Well, it's not entrapment if you're not enticing anyone to commit a crime. The goal is to make Simon think he's off the hook.
Whole thing's a catch. The hardest part is stopping leaks. You've got to be willing to deceive the people you work with.
At least.
The first thing we need is a victim, somebody we own. You need a fall guy to play the role of 'killer,' somebody who's jake with having his mug shot everywhere. In Baltimore, we used a snitch. So you're going to have to bring the DA into this.
You ever notice how it's the, uh, guys with all the money that never pay?
No, I got it. New guy.
You know, Catherine, if we do our job right and catch the bad guy, nobody's going to remember the rest.
Hey. Do you guys, uh, organize your files by case number?
So what do you think? Does the dyslexic atheist not believe in dog?
Drugs were planted.
That's in our favor.
Our 'victim' was kind enough to donate a pint of his blood.
Brass recruited him from Narco, undercover cop. Opted to keep his brains intact.
No, can't be. We're going to need a third person processing the scene to make it look kosher -- someone who's not in on it.
Keep them away from the car.
When's the last time you had to?
Firing one.
Is there a problem?
Interesting, especially if he planned it that way.
Smart cops.
Stealing cars gets old fast. I like more of a challenge.
Okay, you can drop that cup now.
Casual.
Simon. His soda. He wasn't expecting trouble.
Get out of my car ... walk over to Zamesca. 
Didn't come here to kill him ... came to talk. 
Hand him the photo.
Then something doesn't go as planned.
I drop the drink ... 
-- grab my gun.
Murder was Plan B.
Looks like he underestimated Zamesca.
And why he had to disappear. And why we have to do this.
I'm going to call it in.
Yes, someone's been shot. I'm a quarter mile west of Mountain's Edge and Durango. There's a man bleeding from the head in his car. Looks like a gunshot wound, but I didn't see a gun. He's dead for sure.
Show time.
Ezekiel Holstein. Local. Brass is running him now.
Or it's a copycat.
Hi, Mike Keppler. Sorry, didn't get a chance to introduce myself before I, uh, invaded your lab.
Yeah, I'm looking for the ballistics on Holstein.
Great. Mind if I sit in?
Thanks, Bobby. See you later.
Well, I'll get Brass to bring him in, huh? Nice work.
What's the connection?
We talked about the risk going in. It's not like we can quit now.
You know that Dawson guy gets kind of uptight when people touch his stuff.
Done deal.
Hmm. The DNA sample yet, might have been cleaned already.
I see your point. Maybe autopsy will show something.
It's called reverse forensics.
He was a fugitive. The only way to get him to show his face was to make him think he was off the hook.
So I dig up a ghost. I know he has a son who was killed by drug dealers, she's being killed by drugs. He's got a savior complex, so I use her to lure him out into the desert. It's why I drive her car. So he'll recognize it, feel safe.
That's the point, isn't it? Clouds my judgment to identify with the victims. Our job is to catch killers.  Guess it helps me to think like one.
Out of the frying pan into the fire.
He should have stayed in prison.
Sloppy shop. This whole place is a fire hazard.
I think I'd better head back to the body.
Looks like somebody took a staple gun to him.
That's bad luck, isn't it?
So that the body looks right at open casket?
Wait a minute, they killed the guy and torched him; there's no open casket. What's the point of stuffing the body?
So somebody murders an ex-con, then commits arson to make it look like an accident just so that they can harvest his bones and tissues?
Nope.
Cops don't come looking for you if you're already dead.
He's Jewish.
Observant Jews don't believe in embalming or donating organs. It's part of their faith. They think the body should go out the way it came in.
Mmm-hmm.
You guys sure do a lot of exhumations here.
Nobody home.
Look at this.  Lapinsky may have been burned in this shirt, but I doubt he was buried in it. 
Dead men don't bleed.
So he's got a partner.
That's funny. Ross Neddy did time for domestic assault, too. Maybe they're sparring partners.
She may be taking the right steps, but she definitely hasn't cleaned up.
Where are they?
Where'd you get this, the dollar store? Have a seat, Ross.
This is your third strike, pal. Right now you're looking at a minimum of 25 years. You want to talk to us? We can make sure it doesn't get any worse. What do you say?
Desecrating a corpse, ten; another twenty for trafficking body parts.
Should've stuck with the five bucks an hour.
Just looking.
Meticulous. Obsessive. Clearly knows his way around a modeling kit.
No? Hmm. Fits the profile. Bugs in bottles, the Darwin desk set.
Yeah, I knew a guy in Philly like that. Kept a case of thumbs in his closet.
No, a serial killer.
What?
No.
I'm looking for Salvatore Heinz.
Mike Keppler, Las Vegas Crime Lab.
I'm sure it never gets old. We're following up on a body that came through here. Roger Lapinsky.
Not anymore. Someone dug him up.
His major bones, veins and tendons were all stolen.
Oh, yeah? That where you learned how to stuff the bodies with umbrellas?
Understandable.
Where? If you don't mind, I'd like to take a look at that.
I take it you do a lot a work with, uh ... Longevity Tissue Services?
Handy in a pinch, huh?
Thanks.
Everything seems to be in order here.
Thanks for your time.
Keppler.
Beat you to it -- cardiac arrest.
You want to repeat that, Doc?
Thanks.  If you don't mind, I'll, uh ... stick around here till the warrant comes.
I got a copy of Roger Lapinsky's death certificate from Carson City. This is the one we got from the mortician, that old nut job, see? Changed the COD.
This guy isn't even a doctor. 
You're telling me that any Tom, Dick, or Harry with a sign can open up a tissue bank?
How do you get FDA registered?
That's a lot of young heart attacks. We're going to go through all these COD's and match them up against the official death certificates.
The only thing I'm wondering -- is the mortician hustling the tissue bank guy or they're working together.
Dr. Stewart, Dr. Klein, Dr. Combs, Dr. Jones.
Well that's the point of forgery, isn't it, Mr. Heinz? A man dies of leukemia, and his body comes into your mortuary, and you decide to ... sell his spare parts for a few extra bucks. Only problem is, nobody wants to buy diseased body parts, so you make a new death certificate, change the COD, sign off with a legit doctor's signature, and cash a check from Ty Miloni.
You harvested diseased body parts and sold them under false pretenses.
But you didn't have to do it, did you, Mr. Heinz? You took money, and people died. Now, whether or not we got him -- we got you.
Need some help?
Yeah. Are you?
Just getting off shift?
You're looking at it.
Can I get a check please?
What are you doing here, Frank?
I tried calling you, but I've been, uh ... busy.
Yeah, I know. I got the card from Father Anthony. Couldn't get away this year.
I can't. Look, Frank, I got to run. We'll get dinner later in the week, all right? I'll call you.
I can't do it this time. Okay? Don't ask me to do it, Frank. I --
I'm just getting the lay of the land here, you know? Trying to move on.
You all right?
You got a problem with that?
Yeah, yeah, what do we got?
Maybe there was something on it he wanted.
Boxer shorts, socks. I'm guessing this is his. You see another suitcase?
Looks like she was just visiting.
No purse ... no valuables.
Did you see a safe?
Looks like a robbery.
No. Who found them?
Mr. McCarty? If you don't mind.
You want to tell me what I'm seeing here, Frank?
Have a seat.
Yeah, Detective Dennis Graves, Trenton PD.
Yeah.
Male was shot twice, both frontal.
The girl was shot once in the back.
I'm guessing the killer's got it, along with the rest of their valuables.
Sloppy housekeeping?
So who was in the tub with her shoes on?
Yeah?
Yep.
Not anymore.
Anything to help us identify her?
Implants are serialized. We can get an ID from those.
What about COD?
And the cop?
I'll get those to Ballistics.
Yeah.
No complaints; you've got a great team.
As far as I know.
Oh, it's uh, bullets from Doc Robbins. I was going to run them through IBIS.
Yeah. Retired.
You know how many retired cops there are in Trenton?
Well, it's great to finally meet you.
Hey.
You don't need them?
Oh, right. Sorry. You got something on the dead cop case?
Second female in the room uses mouthwash. More than likely another hooker. Looks like we got a witness.
Keppler.
I know. 
I don't have one. 
Yeah.
'Precious Ricky,' huh?
We know Courtney was with a blond last night. Long hair. You got anyone who matches that description?
Now, look, Ricky, maybe you're a nice guy, maybe you're not, but right now I really don't care, because I think you're lying to me. And that could go very badly for you.
Do you understand what I'm saying?
When she left the baby with you, was Courtney with anyone? A friend maybe?
What about enemies?
We got to talk, Frank.
She had a kid.
Why don't you tell me about the hand?
Why, Frank?
That was a long time ago; Dennis never said a word.
He was a cop, Frank.
You taught me that. You don't do that, not even to save your own ass.
Sit down, Frank.
Keep your voice down, all right?
Don't do that.
Don't bring her into this.
Yeah. Yeah. You're out of line, Frank.
Catherine, it's Mike.
I had to take care of something. How's it going? Any ID on the blonde yet?
I'm just off the Strip now; I'll take care of it for you.
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine. I'll see you in a little bit.
Hey.
Yeah ... a bad smell.
Oh, I'm sure you guys will do just fine without me.
Catherine.
Thanks.
Who knows about this?
Give me the card.
I'll finish up here.
How do you know that?
1:10.
Amy?
Just now.
Can I see that?
If she's dumb enough to hide out in her own house, she already is.
Amy?
Suzy Gibbons -- how do I find her?
I don't have time, Ricky.
Because if you don't ...
I'm the last face you're gonna see alive.
It's Mike.
I know. I'm sorry.
I can't. It's kind of complicated. I ... made a mistake a long time ago.
It's too late. You're gonna end up looking into my cases, Catherine.
I got to go.
If you still want to fix this, Frank, you got twenty minutes. Blue Siren Motel, Third, below Fremont.
Drop it, Frank. 
Put the gun down.
Suzy, I want you to get up and walk out of the room, all right?
It's over, Frank. I know what you did.
I know what you did to Amy. 
I killed an innocent man.
She was your daughter, Frank.
I want you to tell me why, Frank. Why you would do that to your own daughter.
I'm sorry.

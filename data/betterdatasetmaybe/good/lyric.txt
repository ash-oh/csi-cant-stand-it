Ain't no sunshine when she's gone... 
If I should die this very moment / I wouldn't fear / for I've never known completeness / like being here / wrapped in the warmth of you / loving every breath of you / still my heart this moment / oh, it might burst / could we stay right here / to the end of time / till the earth stops/turning? 
...Seas run dry / I've found the one / I have waited for / all this time ... 
... I'm so tired of playing / playing with this bow and arrow / going to keep my hideaway 
Water falling down / a hundred meters colored by the sun / in day-glo colors always dragging me around / through beams of light blinded by the sun ... 
... with eyes afire ...
... But I can't find my way home / still, I can't find / my way home / and... come down / off your throne / but I can't / find my way home. 
:
... stay tonight / we'll watch the full moon rising ...
... hold on tight ...
... the sky is breaking ...
... I don't ever want to be alone ...
... with all my darkest dreaming ... hold me close ...
... graceless lady ... 
... You know who I am... 
... And wild horses couldn't drag me away... 
and up on dry land / take what you can / cuz you won't be here again / everybody out of the water ...
...Now I'm treadin' high water / to get back to you / looking for a little spot of something to cling to / there's too many bodies / there's not enough room /
...they say nobody panic / help is on its way, we're already on it / you've got to be brave / if you can fix it now then don't make us wait / man they're ain't nobody coming / back away from the gates ... 
Everybody out of the water / get up on dry land / take what you can / 'cause you won't be here again / well, I loved you then / like I love you now / that won't matter anyhow / well, this is the new frontier / everybody out of the water ...
... everybody out of the water ...
And I'm high enough from all the waiting / to ride away when you're inhaling / and I'm high enough from all the waiting / to ride away when you're inhaling / 'cause I love you 
We fall / sign / a sign / we fall / sign / a sign / we fall / sign / a sign / here I lay / our questions answered / fear inside / is truth uncovered / while we fight / shari I ithe e other... 
Down in the city of sin / that's where I've been / and I caught a glance / of what could be, yeah, you and me ...
everything ... everything in its right place... 
Are you ... ready for the new ...? / Stand up and admit it: Tomorrow's never coming / this is the new ... / stand up and admit it / do we need it? / No! / Do we want it? / Yeah! / This is the new ... 
Hey, you ugly people / I want you to set my baby free / hey, people / set my baby free / said he was man / what did he know / spent his time living in a casino / never know / couldn't get away, couldn't ever get it anyway / couldn't ever level 'cause he's living like a devil / hey / hey, set my baby free / set my baby free ... 
Sitting single / drinking double ... 
I said are you gonna be my girl? 
one, two, three, take my hand and come with me / because you look so fine / that I really wanna make you mine / I say you look so fine... 
... I can hear the sound of violins 
Long before it begins ... dealer wins.
True respect and ghetto love / now raise it up / 'cause everything in life gonna come to an end / because it ... 
no me puedes negar, lo que te hago sentir no me puedes negar lo que sientes por mi 
Yo me paso las noches tomando quierendo olvidar su recuerdo buena aquella noche maldita ... 
...Que por ser poderoso que mi vida jamas pasaria 
Yo soy malo
... Pero en cambio le robe su vida 
...Otra vibora por ser... 
...Que sin duda yo fui el dueño de tus sueños gracias, corazón ... 
You can try to please me
Whatever you do, girl
Hang me up or even hang around
I know you think you'll get me
'cause my heart is stone
Stone walls surround me
And you don't stand an outside chance
But you can try
Stand an outside chance
Stand an outside chance
It was Christmas in Las Vegas when the locals take the town ... 
You can try to please me

But you can try
Stand an outside chance
Stand an outside chance
It was Christmas in Las Vegas when the locals take the town ... 
All around me are familiar faces, worn-out places, worn-out faces
Bright and early for the daily races going nowhere, going nowhere
... Mad World ... 
... Mad World ... 
As sure as the stars
'Lollypop, lollypop. Oh, lolly, lolly, lolly. Lollypop, lollypop – '
Two of a kind / For your information, we're two of a kind ...
Like peas in a pod and birds of a feather, alone or together you'll find that we are two-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo of a kind.
Now, who's to say if we're going the whole way? At least we got this far.
Sharin' our lives, our vittles, and viands, we're two of an ilk. Say, what if we've got rare Chateaubriands or crackers and milk? Makin' it plain. Explainin' it fully. We're similarly inclined, -- 
Because we're -- 
– two-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo-oo-oo, oo of a kind.
'That's life  That's what all the people say / You're riding high in April, shot down in May'
'But I know I'm gonna change that tune ...'
'That's life'
'That's life ... That's life ...' 
This ol' wheel keeps on rollin' down the road
And that Capitol building -- lookin' up at that thing

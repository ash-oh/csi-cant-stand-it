I can help you over here, sir.
Kind of.
There was no way I could warn that cop. I wanted to ... 
... but the guy was right there,
under the counter ... pushing his gun right in my stomach. I'm sorry. 
Well, my ex was looking after him that night. Then the son of a bitch shows up at the store. Had a party to go to. Practically shoved Henry out of the car. I mean ... I'm not allowed to bring kids to work. So I snuck Henry into the office, and I told him to stay there.
Then those two maniacs came in. They shot that poor policeman. And then everything just went crazy.
I was running, and I ran to go find Henry ... 
Henry!
... but I couldn't find him anywhere.
That's all I remember. 
He's got five cavities to prove it. How'd you know? 
He never listens to me.
I think I need to get a lawyer.
I have been working at that store for five years. Thirty-eight hours a week. Thirty-eight ... not forty. You know why? Because my manager won't give me enough hours to qualify for benefits. I have a kid ... with rotten teeth. I never meant for anybody to get hurt.

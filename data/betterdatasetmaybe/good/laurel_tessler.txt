This is the scene in seven hills, where casino mogul Bruce Eiger has been found dead on the grounds of his palatial estate.
Eiger turned sixty earlier this year, ... 
... throwing himself a half-a-million-dollar birthday party at his newly renovated Queen Regent Casino.
Cause of death remains unknown, but as Eiger himself famously joked: In Vegas, if nobody wants you dead, you're not working hard enough. Reporting live from Seven Hills, I'm Laurel Tessler.

Dude, hit single, 24 years old. Touring with Pearl Jam. I mean Gus had bitches lining up outside of his room 24 hours a day. Sleep ain't an option. So, by your next gig, you're going ... you know, need a little bop.
Sober suits some better than others.
Look, I got a family, okay? They think I'm clean. The band, too.
No, no, no, man. I don't shoot up. That's just for snorting.
Gus is dead, okay? You never had the pleasure of finding out what an ass he was in person. Yeah, we made some money off his talent but he made us feel worthless. At least when he was high he'd shut up.

Yeah. I race.
I race a lot of people.
We went head up. 
Put my pink slip up against his five grand. Guess you could say I won.
The best? Yeah, right. Jace was nothing but a lip-flapper. Told me I was all flash and no dash. He wanted to nut up a title. I took it.
Everybody scattered. No one wants to be there when the cops show up.
Yeah. Last week. Some tweeker blew it out doing donuts.
Dad, it's okay. It's fine. Yeah, I popped off a few rounds through the sunroof.
Yeah, everybody does it. Music's bumping and everybody's showing off their wheels. You get hyped for a race. Everybody does it.
Jace killed my mom. Everybody knew it. Everybody knew it, and nobody came forward. It was a street race. Jace's car just slammed right into us.
Killed my mom instantly. He just plowed right into us. Kept going.
Because I didn't know it was Jace. I found out later on that it was a street racer.
Not at the time, no. So I went to a couple of events and hooked into the world. I found out within one hour who killed her.
I never stopped. I just kept going. Never looked back. 
He took my mother's life so I took his.

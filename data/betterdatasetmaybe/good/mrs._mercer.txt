Keith went to Yosemite to climb El Capitan. The shield headwall.
I drove to Taos to see my sister.
Ten days ago. Keith's gear was in the living room, but he wasn't there.
I called his cell phone. I called his office. And then I called the park service and all they said was that Keith had been by to pick up his permit. So then I checked the hospitals up there and nothing. Then I called the hospitals in Vegas. And then I called the police. I did everything I could do and nobody would pay attention.
It was a wedding gift.
Keith hated that thing. He was always trying to toss it. 
When I came home, I found it on the floor.
I thought he'd put it there. I found it in the hall closet, in the garage. I even found it in the car once. It was like a game for us.  Look, I came to you. You guys have been giving me the runaround for over a week.
We inherited a coin collection, and we figured ... we'd save it for a rainy day.

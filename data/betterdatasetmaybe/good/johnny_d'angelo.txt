I'm not coming out. Think I'm crazy?
He killed all the others, now he's coming for me.
Can't arrest him. How do you kill a man who's already dead?
That's the ghost of Mickey Dunn.
You know? Back in the day ...
Vegas was like ... 
-- out of some kid's book. And Mickey Dunn was the king -- only this was real. And, in reality, -- 
-- the king has guys who work for guys all the way from the top to the bottom of the barrel.
-- That was us: Kenny, Mason, me and Derek.
You know how they say nobody saw Mickey Dunn leave Vegas that night?
It's true. 
'Cause we saw him, and we was nobody.
Mickey was acting like he owned the joint. Like he owned us.
That's when Derek got smart. 
Derek explained that we hadn't been paid in months.
We were young. We were stupid. But Derek ...
... he was insane.
Bum ticker.
Least of my worries. Now, either you get out there and you arrest the ghost of Mickey Dunn or you get the hell off my property.

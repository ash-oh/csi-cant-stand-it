Please tell me you found Jerry.
I'm Susie's boyfriend.
Look, I don't have anything else to say. Hey, that's my easiest question.
Okay, okay, all right. He escaped. All right? I was supposed to be watching him, and I conked out for a second, and by the time I got up, he was gone from his chair.
Trust me. He may have been slow, but he was manipulative.
Look, how do you deny a 30-year-old man food? I mean, I felt like I was torturing the poor guy.
Yeah, I told you them Vikings suck. All right, I'll meet you at the Circus Town Book.
No.
My plan was just to drop him off at the buffet while I went back to the sports book. By the time I got back ... oh, man ... 
I couldn't help myself. I had to sign him up.
Well, what was he gonna do with them? He's been strapped to a damn chair his whole life.
I don't know. Was there food in the dumpster? 'Cause when we were on our way home, Jerry was still hungry. Wanted to hit up Krispy Kreme. And by the time I could tell him no, he was running off down the street. I looked for him all night.

Everyone I sleep with dies.
I slept with this sailor once when I was fourteen. He died overseas somewhere.
There was no relationship. I barely knew him.
He invited me for the weekend. I figured as long as he didn't chop me up I'd have some fun.
Mind if I smoke?
Man, I wish I knew what you were talking about.
I wasn't even there.
Home. In the bathroom.
I'm out of here.
As long as you're the one doing them.
I lent it to my boyfriend.
You know, you have this whole Lenny Kravitz thing going on. I'm not one for brothers, but ... damn.
Keith Driscoll.
Told you I was clean.
Boss?
Only if I eat. Releases gastric acids, blah, blah, blah...
Well, you see, the thing with me is I'm mind over matter. I can imagine a hamburger, and I'm full. Will you fill me up, Warrick?
Are they arresting me? 
I have a place. 
Keith and I do. We share everything.
No, I'm not.
How'd you find me?
It's true.
No, dad. I was never there. Never.
Dad, it's way too late. I got to catch a flight to Jersey. Midnight. Mom says that I can stay with her for awhile.
Thanks. I'm taking the shuttle.
Hello, Dad?
How'd you get this number?
Oh, okay. So did you make the call?
Thanks.
Great, actually. Livin' at the beach, temping, waiting tables. Got some really good friends.
It's a big bowl of cherries.
Hey, baby, you want to party?
Oh, I can't ever trust you. All I did was ask you to make a call.
Go to hell.
All right. But I'm not playing twenty questions with you.
So, did you find her body?
So she could still be alive?
No, no, no, she's alive. I can feel it.
No. We keep all that stuff in our purse.
We share everything else.
I told you I'm not playing that game.
Wait. Blood. We went and got tested last week at the free clinic on Ivar. Maybe they keep it.
What do you think?
Guys pay extra for bareback.
Yeah, well, just because you want me to be smarter and sweeter and safer doesn't mean I am. And I got to go. Guess you know how to find me if you hear anything.
You're one to talk. All my life, that's all you did, walk out. Now we're gonna Norman Rockwell it? Look around, Dad. It's too late.
Leave me alone.
Oh. Well, if it isn't Dick Tracy and his little sidekick, Nancy Drew.
No. We don't have a pimp. We're independent.
She's not like that.
Roommates.
Well, there's this guy named Ronnie, all right? He was kind of like her boyfriend. Sometimes he would get jealous when she turned tricks.
I'm going to be sick.
What did he say?
Dad?
I told you he didn't do it. It was that guy in the car. You've got to find him.
Yeah, well, it wasn't me.
What, you're going to send me to my room and ground me? Have a patrol car pick me up at prom? Or spank me?
What do you mean consent was given? Nobody has asked my consent to do anything, and I'm his daughter.
Look, I'm just here to see my father, okay? He's a cop. 
What?
So I guess you're the one who's in charge. How long is his surgery going to take?
Look, I just got off a bus, I would really like to take a shower and change and maybe get a little rest. Do you have the keys to his house?
Well, you're a cop, right? How 'bout you just let me in?
Do you want to check my arms?  Go ahead. All right? It looks like Daddy already told you all about me. I don't even know why I bothered to come.
Yeah. How's he doing?
You think so?
Yeah, you mean I don't look like a crack whore anymore?
Does he ever talk about me?  That's a no.
Yeah, well, thanks for clearing that up for me.
Yeah, I can read.
Why?
Oh, wow.
That's like loving a puppy. That's easy. You know, did you ever think that maybe he's better off just lying there and not waking up? A lot easier.

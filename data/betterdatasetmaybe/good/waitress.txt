She might have eaten here Tuesday night right around this time. 
Miss, everyone orders calamari.
Uh ... yeah. Yeah, I remember her. Um, she came in with a guy. Regulars. Good tipper.
Sure.
You're welcome.
What can I get you?
Thank you very much.
Look, I got to get out of here, okay? My kid's with a sitter and it's not like this gig covers day care.
So what, now we're, like, related?
So, I'm out here busing tables, and I hear voices.
It's nothing new around here.
And it's like a bomb goes off. I mean ... I thought I was deaf.
And then one guy's on the ground and the other guy's taking off. And no, I didn't see his face.
No.
It was a pickup. 
With one of those cover things on the back, you know, a ... 
I know what it's called. Look, Roger was a regular, okay? Draft beer. Tonight, he's drinking J.D. Straight up, six in an hour. If you ask me, he was looking for trouble.CUT TO:
Anything else?
What?
Dougie was in a program, okay? It was my cocaine. He wasn't using.
Well ... Dougie always liked to do a little hum-and-coke before a show.
Right. That was the idea. You see, the goal wasn't to pop the cork. It was to ... shake the bottle.
Dougie liked to go out on stage frustrated.
Gave him an edge. That was Dougie's philosophy: Go in hot ... burn the place down.
Okay.
Thanks.
Libby ... Libby ... oh, yeah, dish girl. 
Sure, she does, but I don't know it.
Eight years ago. The kid had no chops.
Burned herself real good.
That was her first and last day.
Girl wasn't here long enough to refill the coffee pot, let alone sign anything. I don't know where she came from, don't know where she went.
I ain't gettin' nothin'.
Sorry. Order's up.
Everybody knew Dan-O. He's the kind of guy that keeps a place like this in business. I'm going to miss him.
When was the last rebel game? Thursday.
Better than okay. He was pumped. He was so pumped that him and some of his buddies got into it with some other guys.
No, Shirley Temple started the fight.
Shirley temples all around.
Not so good.
You know how guys are. They scrap until someone gets a touchdown.
There's a couple of Shirleys over there by the big screen.
Anything to drink, sir? 
Weddings are a Rorschach. Everybody sees what they want to see. My first five were good.
That guy over there already paid and tipped. Says he's your friend.
Excuse me.
What can I get you tonight?
Mm-hmm.
We do. We also have DP Rose.
Here you go, sir.

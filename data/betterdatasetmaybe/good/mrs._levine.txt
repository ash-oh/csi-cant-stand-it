I just talked to Paula yesterday afternoon. She was on her way to the library. She had a biology final this morning. She shouldn't have been in a boy's room.
Sleep around?
Ms. Sidle ... I need to know. Did trip take advantage ... ? Did he ... force himself on Paula?
No. I know she liked a boy on the basketball team. I never knew his name. I guess it was Trip.

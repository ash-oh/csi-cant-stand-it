Yes. I was with them when Howard died. That was a dark time for them and I must say that it took a lot of courage for them to try again. Because both parents carry the Tay-Sachs allele, there was a twenty-five percent chance that the second child would be born with it.
We tested Vicki early in the second trimester; the results came back negative.
A couple days before he died.
No. Vicki called in a panic, said something was wrong. I told her to bring him right in. 
And despite the fetal test, Joshua seemed to be exhibiting all the classic signs of early Tay-Sachs. Floppiness, poor head control, unable to turn over, decreased muscle tone. When they brought him in it was Howard all over again. 
The only conclusion was that the fetal test was a false negative.
Under one percent. When I saw Joshua's retinas there were red spots -- classic Tay-Sachs. I sent out an enzyme test to confirm it.
Results haven't come back yet.

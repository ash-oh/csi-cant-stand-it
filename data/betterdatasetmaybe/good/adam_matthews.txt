Is that an accusation?
This is a waste of time.
Thank you for the fascinating seminar, but you have no evidence, so we are free to go.
Do what?
Hey, shh.
I don't remember seeing a warrant, Ms. Sidle.
Well, then you just set my client free.
Dr. Malaga has not committed a crime.
Even if that were true, you may have uncovered a very tragic accident, a very horrible mistake -- but certainly nothing criminal, or we'd be downtown right now. No A.D.A.'S going to prosecute. The procedures were elective. Catherine, you don't need me to tell you how many people die every day as a result of physician error.
His malpractice premiums go up.
So, to be clear, we can use the fly's lifecycle to accurately determine the precise day the victim was killed.
The victim was murdered in a woodsy area near Lake Mead. In that vicinity, how long would it take for the blowfly to lay eggs in Joanna Whitson's body?
Doctor, based on your review of the blowfly activity as documented by CSI, can you tell this jury the exact date Joanna was murdered?
The body was discovered November 15. So based on your analysis, the victim was killed November 1?
Dr. Thayer, this timeline you suggest-- from egg to puparia, has this been documented?
Your honor, on this video tape, I have relevant footage of Dr. Thayer's experiment. With your permission, I'd like to play it for the jury.
It's not our fault. It was never requested.
Your honor, your honor. If I may ...
You're absolutely certain of that timeline?
Thank you. No further questions.
Objection.
Uh, we have no questions at this time.

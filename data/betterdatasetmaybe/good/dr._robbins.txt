Petichials ... blue tongue, the works.
I thought you should be interested. Twelve holes exactly made by a large bore needle.
Renita Loakes, 38, from Seven Hills. New case.
Started as a routine autopsy. 
She was shopping at the Venetian, keeled over at Lacoste. Physically, she was in excellent condition, ... 
... so I figured spontaneous aortic dissection or maybe pulmonary embolism.
Then I noticed mees lines.
I spotted the tiny pinpricks on her face, so I painted her with toluidine blue to highlight the marks. 
For only the second time in my career, in the space of two days, I found urine in the decedent's stomach.
Stomach is massively distended. Human stomachs have a volume of about one liter, a little more than a quart. But they have the ability to expand and hold up to four liters. But looking at this guy, I'd say he was packing around six. And that's your COD.

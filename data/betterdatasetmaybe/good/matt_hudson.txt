I didn't file a missing persons report on Stacy, because she wasn't missing. As far as I knew, she was on a solo trek up in Diablo working toward her NESTFS.
Sorry. National Extreme Sports Trainer Finals. I took mine last week. Did it in three days total. So, I didn't expect her back for at least two more days.
No, go ahead.
That's right.
No.
I'd never hurt Stacy.
We told the officers then it was nothing.
We're sports trainers. We say some crazy things to get each other to do one more lap in the pool, one more crunch.
Are you a liar?! Or are you going to give me more?! Are you weak? Are you worthless?! 
Big Sky Triathlon in Montana. You want to see a picture of me crossing the finish line?
I gave Stacy my jacket the morning she left for Diablo for night layering. Extreme hikers can't carry bedrolls. That's what makes it extreme. 
Maybe. I don't know. Ok, I gave it to her to take care of her. I loved Stacy.
That's my trail map. I'd like it back.
Am I free to go?
Are you telling me Stacy's death was an accident?
What are you talking about?
I didn't want her to die. I didn't.
We competed. I'd just run the trail in three days. I didn't want her to beat my time. 
Am I being charged with murder?

Mommy?
Mommy, what's wrong?
I know, mommy. I love you, too.
Hi, mommy. 
Daddy's taking me to dinner tonight.
They have lions and tigers at the restaurant and daddy said I can go to a show after.
Come on, mom. It's just this one night.
Sure.
Mommy?
I love you, too.
Yeah. Three friends made be birthday cards.
I see my friends every day at school. I never get to be alone with you.
Are you going to get me one of those for my birthday?
Mommy!
That's not fair.
Hey, mom!
Daddy! Daddy!
Mommy, hi!

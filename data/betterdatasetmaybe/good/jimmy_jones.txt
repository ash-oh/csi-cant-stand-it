Well, Alicia was a great half-back -- strong right leg, aggressive. You don't see that too much in girls.
Yeah, for awhile. She quit before she got cut. She missed a lot of practice 'cause she was always going to the doctor, and you can't really play with one kidney anyway, so ...
Yeah, on the way to school. Hell, I thought that it was cool that she was saving his life, but she seemed pretty pissed.
Sorry. Anyway, uh, she didn't seem too happy. Said she had no life and never would.
Um ... there was this one guy, with a track suit, he's supposed to be running. He gave me the creeps.
Well, start with his gear. I mean, nobody runs in velour. And he never had any water and he was always on the phone.
Black guy. He was not a runner, but he was in shape. Bald, mustache, beard.
Qld ... like 30.  ... I just ... never liked the way he looked at Alicia.
Sure.

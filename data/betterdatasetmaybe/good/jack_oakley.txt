Captain, I'll need a copy of the police report for my insurance.
No, I didn't.
As long as you're not breaking the law.
Captain, sometimes, my son, he ... he doesn't think things all the way through.
You should have stayed, Ben. You got liability to think about.
Captain, is this about it?
You sick b*st*rd!
You're your mother's son, not mine.

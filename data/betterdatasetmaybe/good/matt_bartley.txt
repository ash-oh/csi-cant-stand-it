Matt. I'm Vincent's brother.
You don't need to say it. I knew when the detective asked me for that safe-kit that it was going to be Vinnie.
Don't have any parents. Mom skipped out when we were little, and Dad died a couple years ago. It's just the two of us.
It was my old helmet.
No. It was the last day of spring break, and ... I was wasted. Like a dumb-ass, I dove into the Tangiers wave pool headfirst. Fractured my T-1 vertebra.

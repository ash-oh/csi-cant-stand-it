Excuse me ... what's going on?
Stuart Manslow.
Buying things made Bonnie happy.
It was a gift from her grandson.
Bonnie had Alzheimer's, you know. And that son of a monster sold her twice a day. Once in the morning, and again that night, because ... he knew she had forgot that she bought the first time. I tried to talk her out of it, but Vincent just kept on calling. And Bonnie just kept on a-buying.
Huh?
Vincent started calling all of us. I played along. I told him I didn't have a checking account, so the b*st*rd offered to drive me to the bank. I wanted him to think that I was weak. So I borrowed Bonnie's wheelchair. He drove me to the bank. Pushed me right up to the teller. Oh, he was helpful. And then he drove me back to the casino.
Why not? Nobody parks on the roof.
I would have killed him with one shot. Lousy shakes.
But I got him good the second one.
Been a long time since I had to kill someone.
You know, the world has changed.  When I was serving my country, I knew who my enemy was.
Now the enemy is ... some punk ... calls you up on the telephone ... and wants your credit card number.
Hmm.

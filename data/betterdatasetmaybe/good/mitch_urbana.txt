Five? A lousy five? This is the best left-handed shooter in the country.
Six? They'll cover that at halftime. Where are you morons getting your information? 
Seven and a half is a good start. Let me hear. Scotty, come on, beam me up. I want some numbers.
Good. Okay, we're going ten here.
Uh-huh. A hook.
That's the game. Call it into the books.
Yeah, I am.
Then we got the same problem. That kid's been a no-show for two weeks. By the way, if you see him, you let him know he's fired, okay?
That'd be Scotty. Scotty Kerwin.
Look, uh, my car was stolen, and I reported it, okay? End of story. I don't know nothing about no shotgun. Maybe the punk who stole my car must have put it there.
Oddsmaking's a little art and a little science, you know? Russell was ... he was all mouth.
He got lucky. You know, there's about thirty games a day, and ... look, let me try to explain it to you, okay? Inside each game is a number. Once in a while, I'm, I'm a little off. But most of the time, I'm right. I work very hard to be right. I chisel through stacks of statistics, I sweep away all the irrelevancies. I try to get to the bottom -- you know, where the truth is. And yeah, I want to know what the quarterback had to eat that day, and if the point guard's going through a messy divorce. All these things, they come together, and all of a sudden, bang -- a number just jumps out at you. And within an hour, every sports book in Vegas got that number up on their board. My hard work displayed up there in lights. That's what I do.
Kelvin Russell didn't know what hard work was, okay? He was a loudmouth major pain in the ass. You think I killed him? 
Prove it.

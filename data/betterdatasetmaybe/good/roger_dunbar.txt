You drag me out of my dentist's office. You throw me in a squad car. Now you're accusing me of planting a car bomb?
It's all over the news. That was my Camaro?
But this is crazy. 
No. I-I get double miles. I'm a premier card member.
You know what, I'm not saying another word without an attorney.
Well, I'm not really sure, but my son, he's got this science project due. You're right, I'm not supposed to help, but, really, all the parents do. We made a volcano. Spilled some of the chemicals.
Timmy. Third grade. Mesquite Elementary.
No. No, well, look, here's the situation is the family, they live in Mesquite, and I'm there on the weekends.
I-I'm in sales, so I travel all over the country.
Look, I... like being married. I ... love my wife, my kid, but ... I need my space. I-I-I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings, so I just tell them that I'm out of town even when I'm not.
No, look ... I'm begging you. Please don't blow things for me with the wife.
I'd just married Beth, when I met Debbie. She was a student. UNLV. She got pregnant. I did the right thing. Ever since, it's been Monday through Friday with Debbie and weekends with Beth. They both think I travel for a living. 
No.
My life is really a balancing act. Early on, I took Debbie to dinner and Beth saw it on a credit card statement. So instead of a P.O. Box, I figured why not rent a cheap apartment, you know? Have a night to myself once in a while.
Oh, no. It's not like that. You know how kids are.
I emptied my pockets at the apartment.
That's right. I needed pliers in Henderson, so I borrowed Beth's pliers from Mesquite.
Well, I watched Beth when she made Timmy's volcano. So, then when Amy had a science project, I knew the drill. Now, granted, it wasn't as symmetrical as Beth's and the lava flow was a little anemic, but ... Amy liked it.
I don't know. Couple weeks ago. Why?
I've been meaning to do that.

We were at the carnival, me and the boys.
They wanted to ride on the carousel. I said no.
Special weekend. Dad's in town. Everybody's together. Trust me, they don't understand 'no.'
Jason! Jason, where's Isaiah? Jason! THE NANNY: Where's your brother?! Jason, where's your brother?!
He was right there. And then he ... I swear to you, I looked everywhere, but I knew he was gone.  So ... I brought the kids back here and had to tell Tavian.
They're not married. And even if they were, it'd still be Tavian's show.
I should. He's my brother.

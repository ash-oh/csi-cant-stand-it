I had a tube down my throat till a half hour ago.
I heard screaming from inside the house.
... by the time I got to Beckman, he'd already passed out.
... I started to choke on the gas, so I got out of there.
... Ran to my neighbor's house, Rory Kendell's, for help.
I remember my daughter calling 911. Next thing I know ... I'm here.

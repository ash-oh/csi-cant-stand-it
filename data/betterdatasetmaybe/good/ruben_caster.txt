Look, guy got out of jail six weeks ago. A weenie wagger with two eyes. As a parolee, he has to check in with me once a month. Missed our last appointment, but before I could file the paperwork, he showed up here, across from his halfway house, thinking he's Captain Crunch. 
They thought he was piped up on something, but his urine was clean and his high hasn't faded.
Hey, Jack.
Captain Jack, these people want to ask you some questions.

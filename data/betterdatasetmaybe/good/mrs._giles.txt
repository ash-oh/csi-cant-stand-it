This is Travis's ninth grade picture. His father, my son, was a punk. He, uh, skipped out just after Travis was born. His mother's in Salt Lake.  She's a junkie. The only time she ever called Travis was to use him to get money out of me. I mean, she can barely take care of herself, let alone a kid. You know how many times I told him that.
Mm. Yeah, it wasn't the first time. He's, uh ... about six weeks ago, I come home to a note. So I called his mom, and ... he just never, he never showed up.
No.
Mm-mm.
No, he took all that kind of thing with him when he left.
Why?
Don't bother. I know he's dead.
I wasn't able to find a hairbrush or a toothbrush, but the only thing I have left of Travis's is ... this.
When he was little, I used to be his tooth fairy.

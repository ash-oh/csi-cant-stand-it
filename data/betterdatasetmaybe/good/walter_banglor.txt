Hey, hand me another beer.
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.
Okay, all right.
All right, all right.
What?
Okay. 
What are you doing?
Uh, better, I guess. I understand last night was exciting, though.
Who the hell are you guys?
I wasn't attacked. 
I was drunk .. really drunk. 
No way I should've been driving that car.
Yeah! I guess that's enough for me.
Looks like I'm a little short.
Jeez!
I won the first game.
Yeah.
Yeah, I guess it did.

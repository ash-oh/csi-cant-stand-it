Okay.
Yeah, we used to date.
No.
I dropped some flowers off ... but I didn't see her when I did.
Yeah. She likes me to come over sometimes, you know? Help her move stuff.
I told you -- I didn't see her.
She was playing Barry White. Everybody knows what that means. I guess it wasn't my night.
I was pissed. I tried to walk it off. I figured eleven flights down, It's better than a cold shower.
What?
Is she ... ?
Last night? The guy who with her was ... was doing that to her? 
I could've stopped it.

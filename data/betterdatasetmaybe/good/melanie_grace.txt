Evidence of what?
I'm the one the found his body. I'm the one that called it in. SARA: If you're innocent it'll, rule you out.
Go ahead.
Does he ever talk?
I have one I use to wipe my tush with. Would you like to take a look at that, too?
Yeah. You know, you probably think I'm cold. Pulling slots after I found Lawrence up there. This is the convention. Everything moves at warp speed.
You know, fifty-one weeks in your hometown with nothing but average-sized people. I have to fit a lifetime into this week. We all do. Business connections, gambling, romance.
Romance? Not at all. Lawrence was a pseudo. He could have his pick of any girl in here.
I'm sorry, I don't recognize her and a girl this pretty I would remember. The guys would still be drooling.
You expected an internet handle to be a real name?  Maybe the girl got cold feet. My first IOLP convention -- I walk in, see 200 Dwarfs staring back at me and what goes through my head? 'There's no way I look like these people.' I ran.
Close. Another southern writer. Carson McCullers.
What's yours? Your difference?  Mine's the worst. Random gene. Anyone can have a dwarf. Sometimes I've even seen terror in average-size people's eyes. I remind them that their little carbon copies might not be such a copy after all.
And hard to notice ... unless you tell someone.
Yes, I called Lawrence. We met in a chat room. He also called me. Did you look at my phone records? BRASS: He eventually blocked your calls. The same week he got engaged to Jessica Marcus. 
You think that I would do that? Present myself to a man as anything other than who I am?
You think I'm capable of that? Killing because a woman has some height on me? Pretending to be an ideal ... if you think that ... then I was wrong about you.

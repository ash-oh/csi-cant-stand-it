It was a bald eagle, and they're extremely rare, and Rebecca had to have a picture for our Christmas card. 
You take a picture, and you turn back around, and life as you know it is forever changed.
Yeah.
This was supposed to be our second honeymoon. We fell in love at an Internet convention at the Hilton. Couldn't believe my luck. A model ... and a guy like me. Beauty and the geek.
I ran to the edge, called down to her, and she didn't move.
Bad reception.
What are you implying?
She made her living with her looks and, lately, she'd been worried about ... losing them.
I was going to take her to New York and then to Paris. We started talking about planning a family. Suicidal people don't make plans.
You're right, Rebecca was drifting away. She became a different person. The meds weren't helping enough. I thought if I took her to Vegas, where we met, it would snap her out of it, but instead, she jumped.
No, no.
It is my fault. I never should've taken her out there.
Would you want people to know that your wife would rather be dead than spend another minute with you?
You try having a hot wife. You pay for it every day. I want a lawyer.

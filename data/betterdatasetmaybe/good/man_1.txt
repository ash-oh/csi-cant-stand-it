So what?
Look, I-I was with these guys the entire night last night.
On the bus? Last night after the show. He said he wanted to be left alone so we left him alone. 
He always hated that song. I don't know why. It was his best one.
We-we did it together as a band. You know, we kind of had to. We went gold three months after we signed our first contract. The next couple of years got pretty crazy.
He's been wanting out for some time now.
Can I go to the bathroom? Please, please, please?!
Yes, sir.

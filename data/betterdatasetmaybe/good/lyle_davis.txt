Oh, uh, windsurfing.
Yeah. Well, he's got the wheels, so ... 
No. I sort of hooked up with this chick, so I bounced.

Nope.
Man, that is not what went down.
I didn't get back in the car with Cory, and if I had, I wouldn't have left him!

All right, man. Let me just be straight with you guys for a second here. I admit Cory and I sparked up at the lake, okay? But then he took off. Three weeks ago, I was busted for pot, okay? The judge gave me diversion. You guys file charges, I'm screwed. I will never get into dental school.

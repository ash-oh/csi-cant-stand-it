Dining should be an experience, like opera or art. It should feed the soul as well as the belly. You should smell it, touch it and let it rest on your tongue. 
I'm selling sensuality here. I encourage eating with your hands. Texture is crucial. The salty, meaty flesh of lobster drenched in creamy, clarified French butter. The pulpy seeded flesh and firm skin of a fresh fig dipped in honey. The tongue understands four major taste groups –

I don't mean to be crude, but a murder is, quite frankly, bad for business.
At $200 a head, you're clearing at least $1,000 in tips at night. That's a lot of action for a blind man.
You're fired. We're done.

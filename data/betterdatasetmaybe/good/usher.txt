Excuse me, sir. I'm going to have to ask you to turn the phone off.
Sir? I'll have to ...
I was getting myself a soda. You know, we're allowed to do that. A tall redhead came out of the theater, and then she made a phone call from over there.
Yeah, she was, actually. I thought it was really weird, 'cause it's, like, seventy in here. 
No. She just threw something in the trash and headed out. 
The cleaning crew's in the theater now. They got a late start 'cause of you guys.

No. I called her. A little after 10:00, after Grandpa went to bed.
Stupid stuff. My best friend Jamila and I, we both like Leon. And I know, friendship first. I just wanted Becky to say it, you know?
Is everything okay with Dad?
Can I get my homework?
Okay.
It's just my books and stuff.
I want to talk to my dad.
My stepmom was a bitch.
I had to protect him.
She was gonna leave him.
Last week, I skipped soccer practice and came home early.
My dad only married Becky because of me.
Well, he thought I needed a mom and that's why he stayed with her.
I hid in the closet. I told her we had to talk and that I knew about her boyfriend.
Uh, hey, Dad. Is Becky there? Could I talk to her? 
Just tell Dad you'll take the call inside and meet me in my room.
I went into the kitchen. Tried to clean up.
I put the phone back in my dad's office and I walked back to Grandpa's.
He was outside. Asleep.

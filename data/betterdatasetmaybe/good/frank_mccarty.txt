How's it going, Mike?
What do you want me to do? You don't return my calls.
You didn't make it to Amy's memorial mass.
It's okay. Dennis Graves and I decided to come to Vegas for a few days, blow off some steam. You like standing? Sit down.
Mike. Listen, I, uh ... I'm in a bit of a fix; I need you to do me a favor.
Hey. What are you getting so excited about? I didn't say anything. 
I got it, bad timing.
Don't you worry about it. I'll sort it out.
Playing a little golf, indulging in the buffets.
We were down in the bar, Dennis picked up a date.
Yeah. I didn't get a name. Anyway, they went upstairs, I played a little blackjack.
Then, I pulled some strings and got us a tee time at the Wynn. Dennis didn't answer his phone. I figured he was busy going around the world. After a while, I ... I knew something was wrong. I got hotel security to open the door.
Yeah, sure.
Could be anything. Pimp went off on his whore. Robbery gone bad. It's a dangerous town.
Yeah.
Dennis should've lived long enough to spoil his grandkids. He was a good man, good cop.
You don't have to be a cop to have that radar.
Really?
Dennis?  He could barely handle one. Besides, he was a little tight with the buck.
There was someone else in that hotel room.
I need a name.
Don't let me down, kid. You got to help me here; I'm counting on you.
Hold on, hold on, I'm on a streak here. Now, do I keep the ace or draw the inside straight? I'm gonna draw to the straight.
Oh, God.
Why? She scratched me, Mike.
Come on, what was I supposed to do? I couldn't take the chance that one of your guys would find my DNA under her nails.
You know why.
Yeah, but he was going to. He was about to be indicted. Wife, three kids. There was no way he was doing time. He was going down, Mikey, and he was taking us with him.
Yeah. 
Yeah? What about yours?  Hey! Give me another vodka and tonic. And give my boy here a scotch. Neat, right? Make it a double. We got to loosen him up.
Look at her. Just like catnip. 
Don't look at me like that, Mike. We did the right thing, all of us. But do you think the grand jury's gonna see it like that? They're gonna see a white cop turned 'Dirty Harry' goes across the river to take out some Puerto Rican drug dealer. Shoots him in the back. They don't understand. Every time we take one step outside the box for public safety, they nail our asses to the wall.
Hey, Mikey, there's no turning back. You did the right thing. If you hadn't taken care of that evidence ...
Come on, I need some help here. Or you're gonna lose everything. And that isn't what Amy would have wanted. She loved you.
What?
You think you're the only one who cared for her? I was her father, Mikey. Don't ever forget that.
I would've killed that scumbag who raped her with these bare hands, but you got to him first.
I love you for that. Yeah, I made compromises for you. You wouldn't be here now if it wasn't for me.
Hey, Mikey, there is no statute of limitations for murder. The kid you shot, his mother's still crying. And I got the gun ... with your prints and his blood on it.
You go down now, you take every case you ever worked on with you. Trenton, Philly, Baltimore, Vegas. All those killers go free. All on your hands. So, pin it on the blond in the bathroom or the pimp. Just do it, I don't care how, just do it.
You've reached Frank. Leave me a message after the tone.
Hey, you've reached Frank. Leave me a message after the tone.
Look, Mike ... about the bar, you were right. I was out of line. You know how I get -- come on. Put the gun down.  You're not gonna shoot me.
I can't let that happen.  Sit down!
What are you talking about?
Mikey, you're talking crazy.
You watch your frickin' mouth.  All right, okay! Put the gun down.
Shut up! 
I loved her, Mike, more than you know.
All right, okay. I'm a dirty cop, rotten to the core. What do you want from me?
Come on, Mike. You're all I've got.

We called her Daegonna. We were together last night. At court.
Angela had been going to this blood bar. Wanted us to join her.
The people who go there, they drink blood.
For us, it's spiritual. We feed off each other's energies.
But she wouldn't leave. So we did. And that's the last time we saw her.

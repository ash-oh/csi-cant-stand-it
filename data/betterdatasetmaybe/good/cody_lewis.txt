I paint what I feel.
I haven't been doing a lot of painting lately.
Listen, I painted that fifteen years ago. Right after that second girl was murdered ... Marjorie something. Really affected me. Affected everyone.
Yeah, I knew Janet.
We had a date. I took her to a Springsteen show. We had drinks afterwards and that was it.
No. Never got that far.
This isn't mine. Technique isn't bad, but it's raw. This person hasn't had any formal training at all.
You know, I came in voluntarily. You see, I want to help you. But this is borderlining on harassment.
No, I don't.
You know what it's like to be told you lead the life and fit the profile of a serial killer?
You see, you make all these assumptions, and you're not asking questions here. You're attacking me to see how I react to what you say. Nothing I say is going to make a difference with you. So what's the point?
That's my point. I didn't do it.

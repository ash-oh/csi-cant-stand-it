Paragliding's a two-piece system -- harness and canopy. Now, the canopies are fitted to you according to body weight so if anyone has dropped a few for vanity speak up now, please. No? Okay. You're going to want to look around. Take in the sights. Do it. Enjoy it. The best view in the world. But don't forget, we weren't born with wings. We had to make them. So respect the equipment, okay? All right, then. It's time to fly. Any last questions?
Yeah, I know Jimmy. The guy's got an attitude. Cocky. Might be able to handle his own in the air but I don't care for his style.
Well, he likes to grandstand. You know, this sport's about soaring. He's about showing off.
Yeah, it's about having fun. But also, there's etiquette. I mean, a guy breezes in from nowhere does things his own way ... ah, maybe the ... walk back'll humble him a little.
When you fly you need thermals or upshots of air used for lift. I mean, on a good day, you can stay airborne for hours.
Well, you can take them as fars they take you. One time I was above 18,000 feet, when I came down I was about 35 miles from where I launched.
That's Jimmy's truck, it's been there since yesterday. What kind of trouble is he in, anyway?
No way. I wanted to see him get his ass kicked, not killed.
I don't know how that happened.
Fred said that, uh ... he just wanted to teach Jimmy a lesson.
Yeah?
Oh, I got that blue-green trainer. That ought to be fun.
Ten minutes later Jimmy shows up all hot. He asked, I gave, he took.
Look, Jimmy lacked discipline. He needed to be brought down a peg or two.

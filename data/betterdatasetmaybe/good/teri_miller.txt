Well, you should check for hemorrhagic tissue at the bone's tool marks ... to be certain.
Hi.
Hmm. Well, maybe you two don't need me, after all.
Not bad. 
Scaphoid... cuneiform. However, this is a wrist bone and this ... is a foot bone.
Grooves from a handsaw would be straight, parallel. Now look at the grooves along the medial condyle of the femur. They're coarse. See? A reciprocating electric saw was used on this person.
You're welcome.
Bone of a pig. They are the most like humans, as you know.
Exact model. No doubt about it. The marks on this bone are consistent with the marks on Mel Bennett's bones. Exact same electric saw, same blade.
How someone operates a saw is as telling as how someone operates a pen. Now, look at the femur. The skipping marks of the saw over the bone tell us whoever used the saw was unfamiliar with its use. An amateur, if you will. Someone with or a weakened nature. Compromised musculature. 
I'm leaving.
Don't worry, I was able to isolate some soft tissue from the preserved vertebrae. Nick's working on it now.
Thanks, Catherine.
Yeah. 
I-I need to apologize for not returning your call last month.
Um ... dedication to my work didn't keep me from returning your call.
Um ... well ... are you still interested in how I'm doing?
Mutilation in the Everglades.
Yeah. And if it's not, I'll be filing for a change of address again. Anyway ... I got to go.
More bones?
I think the bodies will keep.
Were you expecting a bad time?
Are you?
Nor am I.
It's kind of like that old saying: 'How a person does one thing is ...
Exactly.
Sure.
What's going on?
Oh. Well ... you are the bug guy.
It's okay. It happens.
Excuse me.
Hi.
Hello.
Did you bring the photographs of Melissa?
It doesn't matter. Do you remember her eyes?
As we age, our eyes don't change. That's where we'll start.
Okay, software's loaded.
Exactly. Aging is about predictable craniofacial growth. Faces grow down and out. So the first step is to stretch the bottom half of the face.
You try.
Go ahead.
Good idea. Here we go. So, at age four, the bridge of the nose is taking shape and the interorbital distance is established. And baby teeth are visible.
Okay.
Oh, we'll have dinner ... just not together. So the ears are low and large in proportion to the head.
And you're forgiven. 
So over the next ten years, the face elongates the skin thickens, the hair pattern is set and the small deciduous teeth are replaced by the secondary dentition.
Once the face is aged I look to the mother to fill in the blanks.
Uh-huh. Most daughters at age 25 age quite similar to their mothers.
A network of grids allows me to fine-tune the tiniest facial characteristics one section at a time. I'm just softening a few edges, growing the hair ... and we're done.
Not at all. You're just in time.
The specimen's pelvic girdle and spine ... are curved and upright suggesting the species may be quadrupedal. The left and right femur and humerus are derivative of the tarsius.
I think I know what this is. Your preliminary evaluation is correct, Dr. Robbins. It's not human. It's a primate. More specifically, a gorilla.
For purposes of disease control. Per the CDC, I have to take samples and dispose of this animal immediately.
You ask, I'll answer.
It's a trophy. American fetishists would pay up to $10,000 for the head of a lowland gorilla.
Novelty items. Sold as ashtrays.
Purses, shoes, boots ... It's sad. Genetically we're 92.7% identical with gorillas. 
Well said.
Needle in a haystack. Chances are, whoever did this are halfway around the world by now.
Actually, there is.
Gil Grissom? 
Or should I call you spider-man?
Of course it is. 
Orange-kneed tarantula. Nice specimen.
It leaves no prints. They move without a trace. May I? 
Ah ... 
Maybe I should introduce myself.
It's like a human jell-o mold. The impression's only a partial. It's not going to be easy.
And Canada. I didn't say I couldn't do it. 
Give me your hand. You'll enjoy this. It's as much science as art.
No light, no shadows -- no shadows, no perspective. 
Now look.
Okay. First, I'm finishing off the plaster mold. We can't give her life with only half a face. Although most faces appear that way and the thin layer of slip makes the plaster and clay appear seamless. 
Her cheekbones and nasal spine indicate nordic descent. I've seen a few Norwegian brunettes but your girl's probably a blonde.
But, in this country, brown is a dominant eye color. And, more importantly, brown photographs better. You want to get her face out there, don't you?
There she is.
Thought I'd let you off easy. But I did tack up my number on your big fish corkboard ... under 'cold cases.'
Let's hope not.
I see you're now learning to cook for yourself.
You think I'm stupid? He's a teacher.
Thank you. So what's the special occasion?
Actually, yes.
Probably hid in the nasal cavity.
Mm-hmm.
Will do.
Sixteen actually. Excluding five nasal markers.
The occiput the bump on the back center of the head unusually flat.
The eyes have epicanthal folds. A triangular flap of skin that gives a vaguely asian appearance.
You see how the bridge of the nose is poorly developed? Almost too small for the size of his head.
Like the nose they too, are disproportionate to the head. Almost childlike.
These elements are small for the head which, in itself, is almost too short and wide. Your victim was born with trisomy of the twenty-first chromosome.

Well, all the ladies say that the man is hot. I guess I must have just burned myself and forgot all about it.

Oh, that's old. The man is all about the new.

I went to school. In fact, I have carefully analyzed business models of African American entrepreneurs such as Darian Daze at Dis-Kard Enterprises which grosses $250 million a year. And my analysis has led me to understand that an emerging CEO needs to have as solid a command of flow charts and spreadsheets as he does a bad-ass street rep.

Oh, don't hate the player, hate the game.
Ain't that a bitch.

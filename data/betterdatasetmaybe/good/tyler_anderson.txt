It's okay, mom.
You screamed, mom.
Give me the phone, Robbie. Give me the phone.
Is it going to hurt?
I was playing ball in the backyard and I cracked Zacky's window. Dad had told me not to hit the ball towards the house. So I went up and replaced the window before anyone got home and I cut my finger on the glass.
I thought I got it all.
I told the police that this morning.
What?
He made fun of my mother. I wasn't going to let him get away with that.
Don't talk about my brother that way, you b*st*rd!
People are calling us killers. And I miss my little brother.
What did you do, Robbie?! What did you do?!
And we got to talking. 
And I was kind of ignoring Zack and Robbie. 
They were being quiet. They were behaving. I turned around, and I saw how still he was. 
I ran to him, and he was dead.
What did you do, Robbie?! 
What did you do? 
He was already blue. I pushed. I tried to breathe air into him, but he was gone.

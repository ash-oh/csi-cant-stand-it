Hey, I got over seventy women working this convention, man. Booth bimbos, crowd gatherers, hostesses, narrators, demonstrators, translators. Whatever you need, I got it.
She's one of my girls. I represent her. They call her 'Cris,' as in Cristal, the champagne. She can't get enough of it.
She likes to make money. Girls who party make the money. This ain't L.A., where you get up at 10:00 A.M. for an audition. At 10:00 A.M., My girls are still at Drai's partying with the client. What's this about?
No. Come on, she's over there working the Daluca account.
There's two million square feet of exhibits here, man. Forty thousand people. This place is a mini-city. That RV exhibit's across town. 
Look, she worked behind a booth, yapping her mouth. Can't really throw her in a bikini no more. She's getting up there. Three-oh, uh-oh.
You're late. And you're not dressed. What's the deal, girl?!
Oh, you think you had it bad? Well, Cris is dead.
It's a tough business.
Well, I don't think it would work with the texture of your hair.
What are you doing?
Probably from scratching. I'm always thinking.
You were thinking about how Lisa pissed off your best client. And how much business it was gonna cost you.
Lisa was a nothing. Old news. Why would I risk everything for a zero like her?
That's a good story. You find that in one of your forensic journals?

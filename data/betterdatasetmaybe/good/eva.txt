It's fraternity hell week. A pledge slipped and fell in this pile of maggots. School of agriculture is in charge of campus landscaping, so security called me.  You were the first person I thought of.
The university is self-sustaining. A city within a city. State institutions are encouraged to practice xeriscaping.
Landscaping using drought-tolerant plant life. Conserves water. There's no reason for these maggots to be here.
No. Why?
Pounds of flesh?
If something happened to one of our students, don't you want to know?
I just don't understand. I mean, who would want to kill Julian? I mean, he'd had some weird fan mail, but I don't think any of those kinds of people would be able to get in his suite.
The ex-wife isn't exactly the best person to have around when you're looking to get laid.
It was mutual. I'm strictly his manager now.
I was taking care of business. Checked the boys in, made sure the suite was copasetic, had a drink at Skin, and played Pai Gow until hotel security came to get me.
When I was with him, he was broke. Then after the divorce, I still ... did his laundry, paid his bills, read his scripts. After a while, I wanted to get paid. Now I get ten percent of everything. Look ... I need to make some calls. Julian's parents, the studio ... can we talk about this later?
I tip all the girls Julian's with.
It keeps them from running their mouths. It protects Julian's image. It's just a part of managing his career.
His lawyers and his agents don't like me. They pressured him to drop me. But Julian and I are family. That wasn't going to happen.

Did you find a weapon?
Just paper wasps. They're having too much fun to worry about us.
Just doing what god intended ... ... recycling us back to the earth.
Hey, Officer 
Can I borrow some of your hot coffee, please?
Preservation.
John ... Paul ... George ... Ringo.
You got any of that beef jerky you're always gnawing on?
I want to keep these little fellas alive. They're our first witnesses to the crime.
Hi. Sorry I'm late.
How do you know about that already?
A Paul Sorenson ...
Warrick, you can work this with Catherine.  Don't you have a court date coming up?
Listen, juries need to have confidence in the evidentiary, process, so work with Catherine then break off when you have to appear.
Good luck.
No. Sara's going to work with me.
You get a missing person.  Sheryl Applegate. Her husband notified the police that she took the car and headed to L.A., but she never showed up. A few hours ago, P.D. found her car at the bus station. They requested a CSI.
Hopefully, you're right. But, until she's located treat her car like a crime scene.
Do we know who she is yet?
'Full of sound and fury signifying' ... what, Doc?
'The worms go in the worms go out / the worms play pinochle on your snout.'
An old nursery rhyme.
A muscid fly -- typical only in urban areas.
I think there's at least fifteen, but go on. What don't you get?
Like summer follows the spring.
I watch the insects mature from eggs to larvae to adults and then count backwards.
They're not done maturing yet.
But when they are, I'll be able to tell you how old they were when I found the body.
Let me guess. Downtown? The Fremont District?
Synthesiomyia nudiseta is the Latin name.
Mr. Shelton ... did your wife drive race cars?
No. The two most common causes of facial trauma in adult women: Motor vehicle accidents and domestic violence. 
These are your wife's x rays.
So do you.
Does it get cold in here in the winter?
That's why you'd need a blanket on the couch, huh? A green one, I bet.
We're going to need to borrow your bullets.
Did you do laundry back here today?
Sara!
Sara!
Get him out of here, Jim.
Hey. Hey. What is the matter with you?
The post-mortem insects will tell me when she was killed.
Jim, please don't try and compromise my end of the investigation.
She's been dead three days.
Three.
You understand it.
There's no secrets around you, are there, Conrad?
Well, then, you must feel very small today ... by association.
Did I miss one of your status meetings?
So? I'm sure something came up.
What?
Sara? 
Sara? You okay?
Did you sleep here?
I need you to do some background for me on Warrick without letting him know why.
That's why I want you to handle it, so that Ecklie can't accuse me of favoritism if it turns out that Warrick's clean.
Did you find out anything about Warrick?
Mm-hmm.
You don't crunch evidence to fit a theory.
You have empathy for her, Sara. You want someone to pay for what was done to her. That's normal.
Did you just say what I think you said?
It's an experiment. Maybe Kaye was dead five days.
They don't. People do. The victim was wrapped in a blanket. Normally a blanket or clothing doesn't impact insect maturation. The insects usually fight their way in anyway. But I examined the folds in Kaye's blanket. She was wrapped tight -- maybe tighter than I realized -- which would have decreased the corpse's exposure to insects.
And deposit their eggs. Maybe two whole days. I've wrapped porky here pretty tight.
This poor ham was already on its way to someone's Christmas dinner table.
Got to be a pig. Interestingly, they're the most like humans.
Once I took the blanket into account.
Five days, not three.
I can make a case to any jury against Scott Shelton for the murder of his wife.
Thank you, David.
You know, there was a murder recently in a village on the other side of the world. Every man in the village denied having any part of it. The victim's throat had been slashed with a shovel. So this one guy -- I guess you could call him a 'science nerd' -- asked all the men in the village to bring their shovels to the center of town and hold them spade-side up. And he waited. Eventually, flies started showing up on one specific shovel looking for microscopic bits of blood and flesh.
The investigator got his murderer, and...
To an astronomer, it is.  But then people forgot about forensic science, didn't they? And they had to be reminded again by Francesco Redi in the 1600s.
Every civilization learns what it needs to know and the next one forgets it. The sheriff ... well... it's not personal.
Yeah, they laughed at fingerprints 70 years ago, and now it's law.
You're confused, right?
That's the best place for a scientist to be. 
My body's here.
Shall we?
Doc, what's this blue mark here?
Didn't you say the suspect's ammunition was in trace?
And? So?
You did very good.  But this is just more circumstantial evidence. We're a long way from a conviction.
Hi.
Thanks.
I need you to do some background for me on Warrick.
That's why I want you to handle it so that Ecklie can't accuse me of favoritism.
They had another gig. How you doing, Jim? How's your old job?
I curse more.
And her purse is still in the cart. With no wallet. 
Chicken soup, ice packs ... pain reliever ...
Hot dogs, hot dog buns ...
Mustard.
Did you have any mop-ups in this aisle today?
Life holds no surprises. 
$1.98 for the mustard ... plus, my two cents.
Now, where would you go?
Hey, Brass, look at this.
You see this?
This circumference? Looks like somebody did a brillo job on it.
You know anything about this?
Could I borrow a hammer?
'Iv'e killed 5 women. Catch me if you can?'
Hey.
Hey, kids. All right, listen, hey, I got to jet.
Sara Sidle. 419.
Nick Stokes-- 416, fight at the Bellagio. She says she's a 'friend' of yours.
Catherine, you have a 418 -- an obituary on a stall door. I'll meet you in the garage but first, I've got to take care of Warrick.
I don't know.
I read it.
Hey.
How was court the other day?
Yeah, because you had, uh, 'personal business.'
You ... at the Monaco casino.
Casinos tape everyone who walks through their door, Warrick, you know that. I thought we had a deal.
Look, what you do on your time is nobody's business. What you do on my time is my business.
And we know that because...?
Or marker to metal. Do we know anything else?
And good morning to you, too, Miss Sidle.
I read your report.
I see the whole puzzle, Sara. You're only seeing one piece.
No. I trust him. Do you trust me?
Father, son, holy ghost?
That one, huh?
You found the other four victims?
'Iv'e killed 1 woman.' Victorville. Salt Lake City -- 'Iv'e killed 2 women. Catch me if you can?' San Bernardino -- 'Iv'e killed 3 women ... ' 'Iv'e killed 4 women. Catch me!' Mesquite. '...5 women... ' Las Vegas.
What else do you know about the crime scenes?
Which means they were probably alive when these messages were written making these messages of intention, not fact. 
What if we shuffle these doors like Pai Gow tiles?
San Bernardino, California. Victorville, California. Las Vegas, Nevada. Mesquite, Nevada. Salt Lake City, Utah.
So has our suspect.
Where we going?
What's in Moapa?
Really?
Yeah, well, I'll get into it.
And blue. This is bizarre. The body's cold.
And she's stiff -- like a two-minute burrito that's only been nuked for a minute.
Looks like the planet krypton.
That's how she was transported from San Bernardino to Vegas -- in a refrigerated truck. That's our crime scene.
And it's mobile.
Hey, Nick, I been looking for you. 
This girl you've been helping with the 416 .. .?
Is she a friend of yours?
Are you doing anything that could compromise the unit?
I have to ask. It's part of the job.
No, Brass. Do you want to talk about this?
Me, I guess. Did you find out anything?
That's my 'Big Mouth Billy Bass.' It's better than a watchdog. I got valuable stuff in here, you know.
It does.
That sounds pretty straightforward. Why don't you put a rookie on it?
'If Muhammad won't go to the mountain then the mountain must go to Muhammad.' Think about it.
A writing sample will be sufficient, thank you.
You know, I'm starting to think that maybe we should be looking for a man. Only three percent of multiple killers are female. And a woman wouldn't need a trophy. And a body on ice is definitely a trophy.
What if it was a man with a woman who would do anything he asked?
Do you ever worry that technology is going to make us obsolete?
Can you, uh, narrow your database? Say, eliminate all trucks that are not refrigerated?
Can you eliminate all trucks that were not in Las Vegas yesterday? 
This is very cool. Eliminate all trucks that did not deliver to Marty's Market yesterday.
Where is he now?
It's not your truck anymore. It's our crime scene.
Where is she? Where is Margaret Shorey?
Look, pal, I already know what happened. I even know your type -- decent, trusting, middle-aged women.
There's a lock. Are there any keys?
Hello, Margaret. My name is Gil. This is Catherine.
What are you worried about?
It only takes one.
Yeah.
Oh. Great. Sorry.
Uh, I was supposed to pass out some supervisor evaluation forms. Where are they?
No, it's not.
All right. Assignment: Parking lot of the sportsbook at the Monaco. Caucasian male found dead in the front seat of his car.
No. Uh, Nick and Catherine.
You and Warrick are working with me.
Yeah. If we take the case we have very little time to work it. The trial starts in three days.
No trouble. We're both colleagues searching for the truth. Okay, that's it. Look ... onward. You have to start by looking at this.
Meeting?
I don't remember asking you to.
Well, how does killing his family solve his money problems?
Too many maybes. I think we should go with the evidence.
Yeah, a hydrocarbon. I read Ecklie's report. 
Do I seem like the kind of guy who skips stuff?
Well, then, it'll be a short interview, won't it?
Evening.
Thanks.
Even better. Footprints.
Why did you contact me, Mr. Damon?
Fires are very complicated. 
I don't mean to stare ... but, yes, I can learn some things. For instance, the back of your hands are smooth. You read a lot. You have indentation marks on your nose from reading glasses. Your speech tells me that you're well-educated. Your occupation's not listed in the file, but I think that you had a white-collar job.
I don't know yet whether you're left- or right-handed, though. 
Now, you want to tell me what happened?
Why don't you tell me about the fire.
Why?
Flashover?
Well, if you're a volunteer fireman then you must be familiar with the use of accelerants.
According to the report there were traces of gasoline found on the floor of your bedroom closet.
Our homicide department has a credit card receipt for gasoline -- your receipt -- and there's no other suspects.
I don't chase criminals, Mr. Damon. I just evaluate evidence.
How did you burn your hand, Mr. Damon?
People with third-degree burns don't forget how they got them.
I'll take your case. I don't know whether I'll help you or not.
Nothing harder to investigate than arson. If the fire hasn't ruined your crime scene...
Yeah.
Overhaul. Post-blaze, firemen remove charred items to neutralize the hot spots. Prevents flare-ups.
Bag those.
Yeah.
The fire was contained inside this room ... but the outside door frame is severely charred.
We're going to take a piece of this back to the lab.
Huh.
More than you think. 'V' pattern on the outside wall. Fires like to go up and out.
This one's narrow. This was a very intense, rapidly moving fire.
The apex of the 'V' usually indicates the point of origin. You want to call it, Warrick?
Shards of glass.
Can't. It's melted into the concrete.
It's called 'spalling.' It confirms the presence of an accelerant.
Good question.
Really? Where's the trailing? An arsonist would spread the gasoline around to maximize the burn area.
Listen, you guys. You're like Dodger fans. The ball game's only in the seventh inning and you're already out of your seats.
I'll see you guys in the evidence lab.
Yeah? Why was there no trailing? And why no evidence of an incendiary device anywhere in the bedroom?
What are you so afraid of, Conrad? We're just a couple of science geeks. Why can't we work together?
Yes, we are -- if it's our mistake that put them there.
Hey, Eck?  What is the new policy on vacation days?
Uh... you might want to take three giant steps backward.
Three drops of gasoline, limited oxygen supply heat to ignition temperature of 932 degrees Fahrenheit.
Smoke to fire.
Tell me you're here to confirm part two.
It's called alligatoring. See the way the wood's cracked? It looks like the skin of an alligator.
Use of accelerant?
So, the only way this could've happened was ... O2.
Damon opened the door.  He lied.
We chase the lie ... 'til it leads to the truth.
Anything else you want to tell me?
About the fire.
Your bedroom doorframe disagrees. If no one opened the door ... the outside frame would not have burned. As a firefighter you know that.
May I see your hand, please? Palm up. 
This is the same type of doorknob that you have on your bedroom door.
Mr. Damon ...
Why? This places you outside of the fire. You're facing the death penalty. Why are you lying?
What else?
Carbon monoxide killed them long before the fire got to them. You know that.
You tried to save your family, but that doesn't mean that you didn't start the fire. Are you lying about that, too?
I will.
Sorry. What are you doing here?
No.
This is heavy-duty, high voltage. This thing could heat our whole lab.
You know what to do next?
Something you probably should have done.
Yeah, that was your report. This is an electrical socket from the closet where a space heater was plugged in.
I found it in the living room, melted.
It was a cold night. The outlet in the closet was closest to her bed. 
Look ... if this wire burned from the inside out then the fire started in the wall not on the closet floor.
Discoloration throughout the conductor. It burned from the inside out. The cause of this fire was an electrical overload in the wall.
Speaking of which ... where's your accelerant analysis work?
Too many unanswered questions, Conrad. This case should not be going to trial yet.
You've got to do better than that.
It doesn't prove you didn't start it. Until we can explain why there was gasoline in the bedroom closet the charges stand.
Yeah.
From the kid's room. I counted them yesterday. And I counted them this morning. Twenty. They're all there. I really don't know what I'm doing anymore.
Sure.
That's what happens.
I can't fault him for that. The burn pattern is consistent with a gasoline accelerant.
Thank you.  Warrick, you're driving.
Not while I'm committing it, no.
Let's go.
You son of a bitch. You swept my crime scene. You sent cleanup!
So you knew, and did nothing about it even with a man's life on the line?
Thanks, Ecklie.
Hi.
Excuse me. My name's Gil Grissom. 
May I ask you a question?
You're his family. What was his relationship like with his wife and son?
I broke a coffee pot today. Lost my temper. Anything like that ever happen to you?
We found shards of melted glass on the floor of your closet. You want to tell me about it?
Okay, you can explain it in court. It's all part of the report now.
Wait a minute. Go back. What did she throw at you? Be specific.
Think.
What kind of a vase?
Was it even a vase?
Was it glass? Could it have been glass?
Like a kerosene lamp?
I found kerosene on the floor of your closet.
The space heater overloaded the circuit causing a spark to ignite the kerosene.
The evidence can.
Thought you might need a ride.
Your sister. Who is she?
I don't judge people. 
And ... ? 
... responsible?
That's what they do. Put wet stuff on the red stuff.
The Van Gogh effect. In stereo. Both ears gone.
So either it drew his attention or it was contained in something that seemed benign.
Smell the sulfur?
Got your lighter, Jim?
Light this.
Well, we know the propellant. So would you care to make a preliminary call on this?
The dirty little secret of bombs is how easy they are to make and use. 
Our murder weapon's here someplace in a thousand pieces. 
We have to find it and put it back together again.
If it's not growing pick it up. We cart everything we find back to the lab.
Stay curious.
Well, thank you. And your name is ... ?
Did somebody from homicide talk to you yet?
Right. Did you know the victim -- the other security guard?
Would you, uh, like to be on the news?
Well, I mean, realistically, what could you have done?
Huh. Dominic ... with an 'I-C,' not 'I-C-K' ...
Would you be interested in helping me in my investigation?
That's good thinking. Would you excuse me a minute?
Keep an eye on that guy.
Well, we got a live one out there. I got a cop baby-sitting him. How you doing?
No. Dominic Kretzker. Why?
Or he wants to get caught.
I found something interesting.
Bomb was time-delayed. This is a piece of the timing device.
Heat of the explosion must have melted whatever it is all around the wheel. So, Sara?
What's orange and melts?
Thank you.
I thought this was your day off.
Okay.
You told me you weren't dating her.
And Ecklie's at her house now.
What were you thinking, Nicky?
Ecklie's going to be all over this.
When you're a suspect and you're innocent, keep your mouth shut. I'll talk to Ecklie.
Okay, go for a walk. Maybe you'll accidentally bump into your guy, 'Jack?'
I.D. him, but don't approach him.
No. It's an automatic dismissal.
Could you find that and turn it off, please?
Not yet.
You spoiled all my fun.
Anything's possible.
You isolate the tool, and then we trace it.
It's the same as guns -- we eliminate them one at a time.
Alas, poor Warrick.
We find the bomber by understanding the bomb. Fortunately, Catherine figured out the exterior container.
And we know the timing device.
And the propellant.
So the final piece of the bomber's signature?
Three bombs, scaled down five-to-one three different metal pipes. Different metals fly different distances when the same force is applied. Number one is a plumber's ex-flow pipe. Number two is an inflow pipe which is thinner. Number three is galvanized steel which is the thinnest metal of them all.
Mm-hmm.
Green. That's the ex-flow pipe.
Inflow pipe, blue.
Red-- the galvanized steel.
Last piece of green: Ten feet.
Blue: 16 feet.
Red: 20 feet.
20 feet. Extrapolating five to one that would be 100 feet.
So the bomb was housed in a thin container of galvanized steel -- like a muffler or a tailpipe. I've seen it before. It's a common container for homemades.
Dominic ... this is the type of device that was used to set off the Hansen bomb. We have proof that you purchased the same make of clock.
The timing device is still intact.
But you have made bombs before using parts from this make?
Is this from the Hansen bomb?
I can't tell whether he's brilliant or... nuts.
How you doing? 
That's resourceful.
I think the evidence raises some serious questions about your involvement.
Dominic, you have an attorney now. I can't really talk to you about your case. I was here on another matter and I thought I'd come by.
Excuse me?
I'll come by and see you later, okay?
What?
Where?
Form follows function. They've never been able to make a better one. Mousetrap.
Someone picks it up motion trips the trap, sets off the timer.
We say nothing to the media or anybody. Our bomber's signature just got a little more sophisticated.
What are you doing?
Polyester.
You're free to go. I wanted to tell you in person.
I can't discuss it.
Dominic ... I'm not a police officer. I-I-I'm a Crime Scene Analyst.
Good luck. Take care of yourself.
Hey, Dom?
Next time try not to be quite so trusting. You don't need to be a hero.
I'm not quite up to speed on the particulars of ...
Well, it suggests a lag between ejaculation and Kristy's murder but it doesn't disprove Nick's presence at the time of the homicide.
Orange?
The Hansen Building.
You get any hits? 
How disgruntled?
Sitting around making bombs.
Dispatch said you were looking for me?
So who bought it?
Do you miss your mother?
We think you engraved it with an implement from your high school shop class.
Tyler, did you make any more bombs? Where are they? Where are you keeping them?
Dominic, stop! Stop right there. Put it down!
No, no, no. Drop it. It's active!
Above the fold.
It's a tibia ... or most of a tibia.
Well, long enough for the animals to pick it clean.
Evidence of what?
It could have been a hiker who got lost. It's interesting to me how you always expect the worst.
Potential crime scene. Did you know that there's 206 bones in the human body?
Well, 205 more bones and we have a complete skeleton. If we find the rest, then we can determine whether or not it was a murder.
Okay, Catherine and I are on the case at Mount Charleston. Nick, we could use your help on that.
The tibia. Where there's one there's usually another.
I don't think that's necessary.
I know what she specializes in. If we hit a wall, I'll call her.
Sara, Warrick -- dead body in the lucky seven motel.
Bones are porous. They stick to the tongue. 
It could be a piece of wrist bone.
Flag man!
Flag!
How amazing the universe is. Everything made from the same carbon -- stars to trees, trucks to human bones.
Hmm.
Ankle bone? Medial malleolous? Goes on the bottom of the tibia?
I'll take toe bones for $200, Alex.
'All the king's horses and all the king's men couldn't put Humpty Dumpty back together again.'
No. This was a man, judging by the pelvic bone. 
Hey, Nicky?
Let's post this on the dental society database -- see if anyone responds.
Five times the length of the humerus means this guy was... six feet tall. But we don't know his race, and we don't know whether he was right-or left-handed yet.
Hmm.
Look at these jagged marks on the bone.
Well, not necessarily. Could have happened postmortem. You know, one of those tractors up in the hills. Or a mulching machine maybe. 
Teri.
It's blood in the soft tissue. If you find it, it means the guy was alive when he was cut up.
I would never turn away a scientist of your talent.
Uh, could I have a word with you outside, please?
You bring in a specialist without my approval?
Relationship? I hardly know that woman.
Just ...  ... check with me about stuff like this, will you?
Sorry. So, how did we do?
I'm glad you're here.
An electric saw? You sure?
I got to go. Thank you.
Nick, would you stay here and work with Teri on this soft tissue stuff? She'll explain it to you.
She looks distraught.
Interesting how people catalog their lives. Fifty years of marriage on the wall.
Well, maybe she only uses her other bathroom.
Try phenolphthalein?
Hmm...
You find anything?
Can you tell us anything about the operator?
And you failed to report him missing for seven months because ... ?
Hey. Where you going?
Town?
Well ... have a safe trip.
Teri, I admire your dedication to your work.
Oh. It ... it was nothing. I-I-I just called to see how you were doing.
Of course. So ... what's next?
Maybe it was just an alligator.
Do you have to go? I mean ... couldn't you take a later flight?
Have dinner with me later.
A spectrum of possibilities.
The universe.
Does your client care to tell us how her husband came to be dead?
You made it easier to transport his body?
And that's fraud.
We have to go back to the body.
We have bones.
It's supposed to treat heart failure but not if you're taking the amount found in Mel Bennett's bones.
'Someone' did. 
We know your husband had an overdose in his system. We found it in his bone tissue.
This is the part that I'm having a hard time with. You were able to cut him up when you realized you couldn't afford the burial?
Forensically, we can't prove if Mel took the digoxin overdose or if she forced it on him.
Equivocal evidence.
Rose goes free. Because we'll never be able to prove who administered the fatal dose.
It's not a contest.
Could you do it? I'm sorta late for a dinner.
Thanks.
I'm surprised. I'm having a nice time.
No. I just thought we might be uncomfortable away from work.
No.
Good.
... how a person does everything.'
Excuse me.
They found two bodies in a crack den at the end of the strip. Evidently, they've been dead awhile. They need me to do an insect analysis ASAP.
Yeah. But I asked you to postpone your flight.
Maybe I can ...
I'm sorry. 
Yeah. Grissom. All right, look ... make sure the paramedics don't leave and have the primary on the scene take photographs of the corpses at two-minute intervals until I arrive. All right?
Excuse me.
Nice tux, Sheriff.
To know this town is to know its celebrities and their histories. Portia Richmond was a legendary showgirl in her day. But, that's not her.
Who found her?
Come for the hors d'oeuvres - 
... stay for the interrogation.
Yes, sir. Well, I'll do my best.
All right, you guys, like I said on the phone it was a big party, and it's a huge house so we're going to divide and conquer. Nick, tonight you do the overall sketch, all right? Catherine and Warrick, you got the pool area.
What'd you find?
Good catch, pal. You get the guest list. Check for C.M.s.
I defect a bitter alkaloid.
Coffee machine courtesy of the city, I presume?
Cheers.
Have we I.D.'D her yet?
Run a serial number on the implants. Instant I.D.
Hmm.
She was strangled.
Strangulation's a man's crime.
Do me a favor, Doc. Photograph her injuries. Run a s*x assault kit. Include infrared for subdural bruising.
What about Portia Richmond?
Do you mind if we ask you a few more questions?
How is it that you know Portia Richmond?
No.
Did you know the deceased woman?
Yes.  A woman's dead.
Uh ... no, thanks. I'll be fine.
Of sorts. I'm just, um ... looking around.
Yes. I do.
Catherine?
Tchaikovsky's 'Waltz of the Flowers.'
It's playing our song.
You think?
If they knew each other, why wasn't she on the guest list? 
March 7, 1969, mean anything to you? Meant something to the Richmonds.
Music box, lace teddy, it's all the same thing -- it's tradition. And the joy of tradition is in the constant repetition.
March 7, 1981.
I bet he gave her one every anniversary until he died.
Las Vegas Police Department.
I think that was the point.
Sir, I have four criminalists working on this. No ... as soon as we find something tangible I'll call you, I promise.
Yeah, he calls me every hour. I can't get anything done.
No, thank you. 
May I have your straw? 
I ... I collect them.
Thank you. Oh ... mind if I look around a little?
The Hostess' bedroom. 
Too kinky.
Shall we do the room, too? 
I think the tooth fairy might have just left us a piece of Portia Richmond.
Take a look.
... Somebody did some serious spring cleaning.
Jim ...
And neither do we. We have a strong suspicion Portia Richmond is dead.
They're on the grift.
Hi. May we check your coats?
Jim ... may I? Mr. Haynes, we ran a sexual assault kit on Lacey Duvall. We found semen. Can you explain that?
Would you mind giving us a DNA sample?
We found a music box in Lacey Duvall's dressing area that belonged to Portia Richmond. Did you give it to her?
What did you covet from Portia Richmond?
Are you looking for work?
The sign says, 'Do Not Enter,' Nick. You can't read anymore? You're blind? What?
This is important. Sometimes in interrogations, Nick, you get one chance, one answer. And while I'm out here screwing around with you he's in there thinking up an answer that he didn't have before you walked in.
And?
C.M. The cuff link. Okay, I'm starting to forgive you.
And he just ran into us.
You're announcing your candidacy for Mayor?
Haynes is in lockup awaiting extradition to Texas on an unrelated matter.
You know, I think you're going to get my vote for mayor.
A canine.
Her tooth.
Evidence is like fine wine, Brian. You can't just open the bottle and drink it. You got to let it breathe.
Make yourself at home.
Proctologist.
Busy boy.
Does her name begin with a 'P'?
Really? Why is that?
Hey.
It's not what you missed. It's what seems to be missing. 
A fingernail?
Hey. Whatever happened to the fingernail that Catherine found at the crime scene?
I never figured a man for the fingernail, Greg.
Possible first-degree relative? 
Do me a favor. Run this for me.
You tell me.
Mm-hmm. Now I see it.
The family resemblance. 
Donnie and Marie -- brother and sister -- I've got the DNA to prove it. 
Let me tell you what else I can prove. Your sister, killed Lacey Duvall.
Old testament. The Book of Jonah.
'And now, the Lord arranged for a great fish to swallow up Jonah.'
You know what's wrong with the piranha, though? They've got high cholesterol.
You want to fill in the blanks?
What you do on your time is nobody's business. What you do on my time, is my business.
Sara, I'm going to need you to go to the hospital process the victim-- sexual assault kit, hairs, fibers, the works.
The evidence won't stay on the body long at the E.R.
Locard's principle: He took a piece of her away with him and he left a piece of himself here.  We get to find it.
Thank you, my sherpas.
You're looking at it. Murder case.
DA is. Guy named McCall shot and killed his neighbor over a motorcycle. D.A. Can't make heads or tails of the evidence for the preliminary hearing.
He ran from the arresting officers so the Judge refused him bail.
Franovich from days? He quit yesterday. Burnout.
Murder one. The case has changed hands so many times that the D.A. Can't make any sense of it. It gets better. The prelim's in four days.
Cath, can I see you outside for a sec?
Well, technically, I'm your supervisor. They said that Eddie took a second mortgage out on your house. They said that you still own it together until the divorce is final.
It's Eddie. I just thought you should know. I gotta get back out to Nick.
Nick, get a shot of this.
Looks like a belt loop. 
Brass, was the victim wearing denim?
Good chance this is our suspect's. I'm going to use scent pads.
A dog's sense of smell is about 40 times more acute than a human's. A dog's nose is packed with dense rolls of membranes that absorb odor. Stretched out, these membranes extend about a third the length of a dog's body. The membranes of the human nose about the size of a postage stamp.
Except there's a caveat.
Later. 
Hopefully, Sara's making some progress.
Somebody raped her, shot her and left her for dead.
Or true to form. People are usually meticulous in planning up to a murder. They rarely plan the aftermath.
Well, listen, if you get a confirmation, page me. I gotta go see Sara.
Hey.
How's it look?
She's evidence.
Sara?
If you try and chase two rabbits you end up losing them both.
Mm-hmm.
It's almost impossible in gang neighborhoods. Nobody wants to talk. People are afraid. Listen, let's see if we have any evidence that's not attributed to the victim.
Gang shooters mark their kills by tossing down their hats. 
Some sort of anthropological quirk of territoriality. Like cats spraying on a bush.
Jane?
We're looking for a shooter. Guy abducted, raped and shot a young black woman the other night.
The dogs? Constitutional issue. We can't get a warrant for the evidence we find off the dogs' search.
You're a grown man, Nick. Stop whining.
Hey.
I, uh, broke in my new shoes. That's about it. What'd the lab say?
So you're just ... looking at missing persons reports?
Sara. Do you have any diversions?
You max out on overtime every month. You go home and listen to your police scanner. 
You read forensic textbooks ...
Look, every day we meet people on the worst day of their lives. It's a lot to deal with. Everyone who's had any time on this job knows that you have to have a diversion in order to cope with what we see. What do you do for fun?
You need something outside of law enforcement. Catherine has her kid, you know? I sometimes ... ride roller coasters. 
What do you do?
Okay. What do you like?
You've got to find something to like. You can't get too close to the victims.
If you don't find something they'll all become special and you'll burn out.
Sara.
K-9 unit's going to meet us there.
That's if we find him inside his house. In which case, we'll figure out another way to get a warrant.
My priority is the case, Nick. Release the hounds.
Hey, lady. You ready for a scent pad?
Breathe deep. Girls.
Yeah!
Ma'am, is-is this your son?
Well, we're going to have to talk to him for a minute.
Actually, they're scent dogs, and I'm not a police officer. I'm a Forensic Scientist with the Las Vegas Police Department.
You could say 'hello.'
Were you wearing those pants the other night?
They're missing a belt loop. 
I find that interesting.
That's true, she isn't ... but if she dies within a year and a day of the shooting ... then it's murder.
Well, then I guess the law is on your side, Tony, isn't it? For now.
Let go of her, Ed!
Catherine?
I don't want to ever see you in this building again. This is our place of business. You understand that?
Go home, Eddie.
It's the system.
Sara ... you got to learn to let this go or you're going to spend all your time in hospitals trying to help the people you couldn't save.
Oh.
Introductions?
Mind if he and I have a moment together?
Multiple contusions to the back of the skull. Might've been taken by surprise.
Yeah, I think our robbery suspect is a homicide victim.
Melissa Marlowe.
You lifted 38 prints from the pottery store. I scanned them through AFIS. One came back. Melissa Marlowe.
Kidnapping - Colorado -- 21 years ago ... the little girl.
Well, not anymore on the left is Melissa Marlowe's print, age four -- preschool fingerprinting initiative. On the right is a print that you lifted from the crime scene.
Neither did I but since fingerprints are set for life during the fourth month of fetal development I looked beyond the size differential. 
Now, both prints are ulnar loops. Bifurcation, recurve and ridge endings are identical. 
I've aligned the prints along the delta.
No. Her print wasn't fresh. There was dust on it. Has to be a few weeks old. I think we have two separate cases. So I'm going to take the new lead in the old kidnapping case.
Well, we still don't know where she is. Her prints in the pottery store tell us that she was here possibly a few weeks ago, but Vegas is a tourist town.
I'm still not sure we can find her.
Teri ... come in.
Teri Miller, Mr. and Mrs. Marlowe.
Teri is a forensic artist. I called her to help us.
Using computer software Teri can age Melissa's picture so that we can determine what she looks like today at age 25. Then we send it off to every law enforcement agency in the state.
Well, 21 years ago, they told you that your daughter was dead. Now we're moving in the right direction.
It's preprogrammed with developmental averages?
No, no. Maybe you should drive.
I have a question.
Since I screwed up our last date, will we ever have dinner again?
You know, I did apologize.
Is that Mrs. Marlowe?
Wow. Hello, Melissa.
Catherine, say hello to Melissa Marlowe.
What?
Yeah, well, she could've cased the place weeks ago and then remembered to wear gloves on the big night.
And?
You and I have an appointment with our shrink.
You think this new bat's going to do the trick?
But these memories would be ... tenuous?
Inability to feel guilt, compassion or love, right?
Cath, meet with her again. Ask open questions. 
Thanks for your insights, Philip. I'll let you know how this unfolds.
Welcome to my world.
I hear that, uh, Greg found uranium on the swab from Felton's skull.
You'll be fine, silkwood.
Well, before Peter Parker was bit by that radioactive spider and became spider-man back in the '50s oxidized uranium flecks were used as color enhancers.
Like paint? Paints, dyes, glazes... since our guy was killed in a pottery store...
Yes.
It's not quite that simple.
Well, I don't want to be evasive. It's just that, uh ... we suspect she might have committed a crime.
A homicide.
I can let you see her, but I can't allow you to talk to her -- not right now -- and not under these circumstances.
Why would you need a lawyer?
I don't know. I wanted to observe them, I guess.
I never thought about that.
Yeah.
Any evidence relating to the murder of your father.
What?
Shall we test for uranium?
Nicely done, Nick.
Miss, have you ever worn these gloves?
Really? Well, we'll see.
It's a perfect match.
Joe lanced the safe.
Once the safe was cracked you seized the moment and bashed his head in -- three blows.
Nick, call Brass. Tell him it's time to make an arrest.
I'm sorry, but there's no evidence to indicate that there was a third person present at the crime scene.
Brain scans have documented changes in the hippocampus of individuals shifting from one personality to another. But would these two personalities be aware of each other?
Tammy's the dominant personality.
Who was also Melissa's kidnapper.
We have to stay open to all the possibilities.
I just got back to the lab, saw the smoke. What's up?
And what happened?
You both knew that there'd be a scientific explanation for the human torch though, right?
Did you find the wick?
A piece of fabric that's scorched but not completely burned ... like possibly from the nightgown.
It's called the wick effect. It's like an inside-out candle. The fabric acts like a wick, and the body burns inward explaining the high temperatures which destroy the bone. The fabric ends up scorched, but not completely burned.
Well, in science we learn through experimentation, right? Sometimes we need to see it to believe it. You guys did a nice job. Now you have to clean it up.
Tammy Felton's prelim has been postponed indefinitely.
She left town. Skipped bail.
Their house and their life savings. 
It's over. Case closed. We move on.
What do we got?
They didn't bother to valet.
Carjackers don't use knives.
They used to say, 'Never on Sunday.' Then Pearl Harbor happened. I never say, 'Never.' 
We got three minutes to process this crime scene! 
After that, we lose it all to the gutters! Sara, take overalls! Warrick, put a cone down on everything you bag! Nick, we got to get these bodies into the van!
Yeah ... our killer got lucky tonight.
Do we have any eyeballs at all?
What's your name, son?
Well, Justin, my name's Gil Grissom. This is Sara Sidle. We're with the Crime Lab. Is, uh, is that your blood?
Whoa. Slow down.
If it makes you feel any better, that's not what killed him.
And his wife?
Work of a lefty?
Hard to scream when your throat's been cut. 
Defensive wounds.
Two?
Two weapons ... two attackers.
What about the eyewitness?
Covered in blood.
In the heat of the moment, it's not a car, it's a possession and people will fight without realizing what they're risking.
I'm speaking in generalities. Regarding the Shepherds ... I'm in the dark, too, just like you.
When you carjack a car, you keep the car. You don't dump it.
Well, who kills for a joyride?
Has anybody else touched this vehicle?
Well, maybe there'll be some evidence on the inside.
Whoa. Whoa.
Well, I haven't felt that in a while.
The element of surprise.
Good question. Better question, who is she?
Uh. Put some gloves on.
The body fell out when I opened the door. It happens. We move on.
Seat belt's unbuckled. That's why she fell out.
Well, she's in the driver's seat. Was she driving? Or could she have been placed in here?
I think it's 29%, actually.
What?
How about Amy Shepherd?
Shepherd's SUV. Stab wound. Cat hair. She's linked to the first crime scene. But how?
Well, finally.
Someone has a theory.
Did you check in her pockets?
Whoa, David. Go back up to the 12th rib, please.
Our killer leave us a souvenir?
What do you leave your waiter?
How soon can we get that out of the body?
This is a nice job, Warrick. You know, casting is an art.
So we've identified the weapon used on Jessica Hall. Was it also used on Kevin Shepherd?
Sara, you still have the dagger tip from the body?
And you have the cast of the unidentified murder weapon.
A dagger's not a diamond. It doesn't last forever.
We don't have two weapons.
One weapon, one killer.
An anobiid powder-post beetle. Very nice specimen.
Your building collapsed.
Well, this little guy confirms it. This species of beetle eats softwood. Tell me about the building.
A delicacy.
Forget the beetle; this damage was intentional. You're looking for a homosapien.
Catherine, there's a reason I assigned you this case. You're good with people, both the dead and the living.
Can I keep it?
Don't forget to feed him.
The coroner just sent over a ten card of Jessica hall's fingerprints. Evidently, I'm the new delivery boy.
Are you doing what I think you're doing?
Yeah.
It's a scientist's right to re-examine his theory with each new piece of evidence, Nick.
When death is not immediate a victim will instinctively curl up into a fetal position. Which may have protected this from the rain.
You expect blood on a victim but let's ask the question: Could the normal action and behavior of our victim have put his blood there?
Okay. How did her blood get on his shoe?
Get closer.
You can if you kneel down.
Possibly to help or to hinder.
Nick, get a warrant for Jessica Hall's apartment. We'll see if suspect number two leads us to suspect number one. And bring a scorecard with you.
It's your theory, pal. 
Our little Jessica was a prolific note-taker. 'Be a good person today.'
'Cancel water cooler delivery.' 'Plan girl's night out.' 'Light bulbs for porch.'
Red hairs on Jessica. She owns a tabby cat. Red hairs on Shepherd.
Try it.
And then a $35,000 day?
How does a girl who makes $2,000 a month pull in $35,000 ... only to give it away on the same day?
It hasn't posted yet.
Wait. Go back. 
Well, we know who she got it from -- Kevin Shepherd.
Maybe.  Maybe not. 
We can't speak from the evidence, Nick and everybody else is dead.
Andre's, nine p.m. Green SUV. 'Corner of sixth. Sunday, K's office, 8:00 A.M.' This is a blueprint for murder.
He paid Jessica $35,000. He called her as he was leaving the restaurant. He wasn't supposed to die.
Kevin shepherd took a hit out on his wife and something went wrong. And we may have the proof.
I think Shepherd planned the murder of his wife.
They had a very healthy relationship.
To who?
Kevin Shepherd's. This is a transparency of Kevin Shepherd's defense wounds.
They fit perfectly over the handprint on Justin's shirt.
We just put the dagger in Justin Green's hand.
Okay. Jim got us a court order for production of documents. On the left, the phone records of Kevin Shepherd, Amy Shepherd, Jessica Hall and Justin Green. On the right, their banking records.
Jessica transferred the money out of her account. To Justin Green?
Well, if it was a straight-on hit for hire Jessica would've steered clear of the crime scene.
All in the family.
Only one left is Amy.
Why kill one when you and collect over 100 grand?
And Justin secures his double cross with an insurance policy. He eliminates the person that hired him. Jessica wasn't stabbed by accident. She was a loose end.
Normally, when they pay to have someone killed they do it so they're not connected to the crime. Why was Jessica even there?
You know what they say about looks.
They can kill.
Excuse me. My name's Gil Grissom. I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
I'll certainly try.
Is that the ransom note?
Have you let anyone else touch this note? 
Police, a relative, anyone?
Well, because the person who touched it before you has your son ... and he's just left us the first piece of the puzzle.
Was this yours?
May I ask when you opened it?
You mind if I, uh...?
You have any more of these?
Thanks.
We're going to need a piece of the baby's clothing. Something from his hamper, if possible. We're going to use scent dogs throughout the neighborhood.
I'd also like to get blood samples from each family member.
Well, the sooner we can eliminate the expected hairs and fibers from within the household, we can begin looking for outsiders.
I hope not.
Sara.
Take this ransom note to Q.D.
I think it's ink-jet not typewriter.
Take every computer and printer from the Anderson house with you.
I'm not thinking anything yet.
Nick.
It's not a refreshment. It's an experiment. Take this to the lab in a controlled space, 72 degrees Fahrenheit and open it. Keep this in the same room-temp space.
Process, Nick. Process.
Baby's bedroom window is open and the ladder's still out there. So canvass the whole grounds from outside to in.
Damn, Warrick!
What spiderweb?
Well, it could have happened after the abduction. Spiders can build one of these things in a few hours.
Warrick? What are you doing?  Go around.
Two hairs, separate and distinctive.
You smell something?
It's like a household cleanser. There's a pine smell.
No, it's stronger than that. 
It's emanating from this specific spot.
Yeah, well, we need to look for what's out of place.
Grissom.
You're breaking up.
Are you standing next to the copy machine outside ballistics?
No. I want you to move away from that machine. Look, check all the printers at Steve Anderson's company.
Get Q.D. To help you with a warrant. Target all immediate coworkers and disgruntled employees first.
Stand back.
I'll get the pictures!
I'm going to take him.
He was smothered.
Smothered how? Did you find hand marks? Trauma around the mouth or nose?
He was in a blanket when I found him ... wrapped pretty tight.
Are those from Anderson's company?
You got homicide's list of disgruntled employees?
You call homicide back and tell them to get us that list now. 
Hey.
Where are we on those DNA samples?
Yeah? So answer my question.
I hear you're backlogged.
These?
There. Now they're off your counter. 
Zachary Anderson, DOB 01-23-01. Date of death, three hours ago. Until we find out how and why ... 
... this is the only case you work on.
What?
Everyone didn't find that baby. I did. And that little boy is dead because someone lost their temper or screwed up, or god knows what. So, excuse me, but this victim is special.
You better drive.
I'm very sorry, but we have to preserve the evidence in a case like this. And, as difficult as this sounds, Zachary is evidence.
Your child was found five hundred yards from your back door, in clean clothes wrapped in a white blanket, laid carefully under a statuary.
The FBI tells us that you never received a call from the abductor. What kind of a kidnapper forgets to call the family?
But you have nothing to hide.
The blood we found in the baby's room ... It belongs to your son Tyler.
And you wiped up the blood with some type of pine cleanser. 
Let's go back a second, Tyler. You said that you baby-sat for Robbie and Zack last night, right?
That still doesn't mean you didn't kill him.
I don't know.
Good, Nick. 
Did you find any ethanol on the lip of that bottle?
Call me when you get the results.
See if they can find out what this green substance is on these nylons I found in Mr. Anderson's closet.
The mother's prints ... the father's prints ... and a set of unknowns.
And who is Needra Fenway?
Thank you for coming in.
We have evidence that this came from your printer.
We also found a strand of hair. Our lab has matched it to you. 
Do you go upstairs? 'Cause that's where we found this particular hair.
Are these your nylons? I found these hidden in the back of Mr. Anderson's closet. So, did you come to him after you disposed of the baby and ask him to hide them for you?
How do you explain her hair in the baby's crib?
You've lied to me before.
You told me that you opened that cola bottle the morning you reported Zack missing. We had a test done. You opened that bottle six hours before you said you did -- the night before -- somewhere around 11:00 P.M. The lab is still testing it. I also believe that you cut it with alcohol.
Was Needra Fenway in your house that night? Did you catch her suffocating your son?
Well, why don't you tell me how it happened.
What kind of charge?
Let me tell you something. People are presumed innocent ... innocent until a court of law can examine all the evidence and prove otherwise. Until then everything else is ... gossip.
I don't need this.
What? Are you changing teams now? You've been her biggest supporter. 
You're right. I didn't.
You shook him unconscious.
Did the E.R. find proof that there was food lodged in Tyler's throat?
Did you know that your golf course paints its grass?
It's actually a vegetable dye. Biodegradable. They've been using green dye on television tournaments for several years.
I found a pair of nylons in the back of your husband's closet.
The exact same dye from the golf course where Zachary was laid to rest is on your nylons.
A mother repelled by her young.
Did he nail time of death?
From the baby's clothes?
Anderson's attorney. Seven a.m.
Bring all the evidence.
I don't have any questions. We know what happened in your house the night Zachary died. We've interpreted the evidence.
The question documents lab thinks that a parent wrote the ransom note because there's no money amount. 
Too hard to put a price on your own son?
That's how you got the grass stains on your nylons.
The only shoe prints we found were yours and the gardener's and the gardener has been out of town. You then drove over to your office and cranked off a ransom note on the first available printer ...
... possibly thinking that if you used a printer from outside your house, we wouldn't be able to trace it. 
But these three dots ... have given you away.
You're right, counselor. Zachary's life was taken much earlier in the evening. The coroner estimated time of death at 9:00 P.M.
Yes. While Robbie and Zachary were in Tyler's care. 
You said that we could ask three questions each. Am I right?
Would you tell us ... how you killed him.
We're going to have to have them both arrested.
We're done. She copped.
What?
Yeah. But then you called your girlfriend.
And that's when you called 911.
But you must have dropped the phone to tend to Zack.
And I guess somewhere in the chaos you got disconnected. Soon after that, your parents arrived.
One of you worked on him so hard that you cracked his sternum.
He's three. He's clinically unaware of his actions. No court would hold him accountable for that.
Mr. Anderson, we won't let that happen.
Your family's waiting for you. You ready?
All right. What do you have?
You been drinking, Warrick?
Two distinct tire treads -- one wide ... one narrow.
Hey, O'Riley, I wouldn't book those suspects just yet. I think they ran over a corpse.
You guys get over there. Keep me in the loop. Keep the media out of it.
It's not a problem.
You don't have to explain -- Consider it done.
Good luck.
There's a college for the deaf about a mile from where we found him.
Did you send a sample of his blood to DNA?
Has his family been notified?
Mrs. Clemonds?
My name is Gil Grissom. I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
May I come in for a minute?
The bell sets off vibrations which reverberate on the floorboards so that he knows someone's at the door.
Mrs. Clemonds, I'm here about your son Brian. There's no easy way to say this.
Brian was killed tonight.
No. No, it's not.
No, Mrs. Clemonds... we think he might have been murdered.
Would you like to talk to a Family Services Counselor?
How'd it go at the college?
What did you do?
All right. Let's go.
Dr. Gilbert? I'm Gil Grissom, with the Crime lab. You kicked my people out of your office.
Look, your student is dead. Don't you want to know who's responsible? I do. 
Why? 'Cause they don't understand the victim? Help them understand.
Is that what you think I'm saying? A student is dead. Maybe you feel responsible. Maybe you're angry. But don't be angry with us. We want to help you.
Yes, I will. I welcome your involvement. Now, may I see Brian Clemonds' file? Please?
Brian filed six complaints against his roommate -- Paul Arrington.
And he took it out on Brian. Assaulted him. Brian requested a new roommate. Request denied?
I want to speak to Paul.
You don't need to hear or speak to communicate. Or ... commit murder.
No.
Sara, you see deafness as a pathology. For Dr. Gilbert, her deafness is not her handicap -- it's her way of life.
As long as you see this as us versus them, you're going to have problems on this case.
This explains what we're doing. 
I need for Paul to read it.
Good. He recollects you.
He recollects the college.
He recollects Brian.
This is a shot of the crime scene.
No recollection.
No recollection of the crime scene or of Brian under these conditions.
Sorry. I was thinking.
About what it's like to hear.
I'm on a case.
The what?
Oh, Catherine ...
I forgot. I'm so sorry.
I thought you said that it was too late.
Hey. Any luck on the tire treads?
Yeah. They make your head itch. And, after head colds the most common medical problem affecting children.
Stay on the tire treads.  Warrick?
You ran a DNA profile and something very distinctive popped up?
What is it, Greg?
Dots of blue light on a red sea.
Pyoverdin. A pigment excreted from pseudomonas aeruginosa which is a bacteria occasionally found in the bloodstream.
I saw it. It's missing six digits. It's useless.
What do you call a guy with blue-dotted blood, lice and keys to a ford explorer?
A killer.
Yes. 
The SUV's registered to Adam Walkey. He's 18 years old; no prior complaints. We're processing it now. I promised to keep you informed.
We have a suspect.
Well, that's why I suggested we meet here. I don't need him to talk. I just want his blood. 
It's a licemeister.  We're going to comb your hair.
Not even lice eggs.
Delousing agents take time to kick in. There would have been evidence of the infestation.
Pseudomonas aeruginosa?
Greg, start a DNA comparison. This gives us enough to hold Walkey.
Dr. Gilbert can afford her personal bias. We can't. 
And we need a lot more than day-glo bacteria to get a conviction. 
Adam ... we found lice in the driver's seat of your vehicle but your scalp was clean. Was there anyone else there? A witness who might support your account?
You offered to help with my investigation and now you're compromising it.
Who says it was a hit-and-run. Not murder. He has a witness.
The witness can say whatever he wants. The important thing is that Adam Walkey was not alone when he killed Brian.
Until now, I did not know who was with him.
His witness is our other suspect.
I have just one question: Does your head itch?
I'm going to just, uh ... rearrange your part a little. Hmm. According to Adam Walkey you were with him in his SUV the other night and your head lice ... confirmed his statement. They also tell me that you were driving.
Now, why don't you tell us what really happened.
The evidence says otherwise.
Well, there weren't just lice in the SUV. There were lice on the victim's sweater.
Do you know what lice eat? 
Blood. I'm pretty sure I can prove that the lice on Brian Clemonds came from your head.
Let me tell you what I think happened.
You and Adam saw Brian walking out of a liquor store carrying a six-pack. You're underage. Maybe you wanted him to front you some beer.
Brian doesn't respond.
... Then you got out of the car.
You started taunting him. And then everything escalated.
The blood on the victim's knuckles led us to Adam.
The average male loses 80 hairs a day. A stray hair left behind lice, which brings us to you.
It would have ended there but, as you were about to drive away, something caught your attention.
Something in your rearview mirror.
And you took off.
Let me tell you something, son.
Fine. No more questions.
Just this. You want to know why Brian Clemonds ran away from you? It was dark, you were shouting at him and he didn't understand what you were saying. Brian Clemonds was deaf. 
He was afraid of you. But you were more afraid of him ... weren't you?
Some people are just afraid. 
You're not.
My mother.
She lost her hearing when she was eight.
... loved to swim. I asked her what it was like to be deaf. She told me to stick my head under the water ...
She taught me not to make fun of 'she' ... 'you' ...
...
I think running man was attacked up there and then dragged or slid down here.
And smart. 
This one evidently knows how to use a scalpel. HARD CUT TO END OF TEASER ROLL TITLE CREDITS
Catherine.
What are you doing?
The carnival case?
Did you straighten up my office while you were in there?
Okay. Take Sara with you.
We're not?
I was wrong about the species.
What?
I'm wrong all the time. That's how I eventually get to right.
Someone with two legs and a medical degree.
Like David Crosby said, big fella: 'If I'd known I was going to live this long I'd have taken better care of my teeth.'
Did you ever hear a dog say 'woof-woof,' Greg? 
I mean, what is the origin of that? And what do we sound like to them, I wonder.
Did you come here with some particular 'blah, blah, blah' for me?
Greg, you know that paw prints are not the same as fingerprints.
And?
Now if we can just figure out where he went to medical school we'll be home free.
The, uh big dog is a Great Dane-Mastiff mix.
No, odontology did. Dr. Robbins' dental mold. But, uh it's always nice to have a visit with you, Greg.
'The array of the bite the squarish impression of the jaw are unique to a Dane or Dane mix.' And there are only 40 registered in the greater Las Vegas area. So if one of them is owed a visit by the tooth fairy ... yes ... I think I can.
It's interesting how we categorize evidence in terms of what it means to us as opposed to what it might mean to the case.
Sometimes we deal with bugs, worms, waste or worse. But, as scientists, we look beyond the possibly offensive qualities of these things to what they might tell us about the puzzle we're trying to solve.
People actually pay to go to my seminars, Nick. We've I.D.'d the dog.
And?
Is this your dog Doctor?
Well, you have a problem.
There have been complaints about your dog in the past.
The dog we're looking for is missing a tooth. I noticed that Simba is also missing a tooth.
That may be. We still have to take him into custody until we can determine whether or not he had any involvement in this homicide.
You said that you were a doctor. May I ask your specialty?
Do you ever consult with amateur athletes? Like marathoners?
Terry Manning.
You're assuming a lot.
Simba's mold's still damp, but you can see it's a perfect match to the bite mark on the jogger.
No. We need to build some more evidence. Find some jogger in Simba's stool.
How premium?
We need to find out what Dr. Hillridge feeds her dog.
There's nothing in here.
Surgical teams use dry ice to pack organs shipped for transplant.
Nutritionist. But all medical residents have surgical rotations. Fellas, we have a doctor's appointment.
Would you mind if I looked in your freezer?
No one's asked you to. 
Man's best friend ... but not yours, huh?
What?
May I ask you what medical school you attended?
I just thought, the way you handled that knife...
It chose me, actually.
No, thanks.
Excuse me.
Boy, these are well maintained.
Maybe she makes house calls. 
May we help you?
We can't arrest her for that.
Mr. Gesek, I'm not accusing you of anything. I'm not even here officially. Think of yourself as a consultant to the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
What do you know about organ theft?
And you know this because...?
Tell me about the local market for organs.
If someone was disemboweled and their liver taken what would that go for?
It's amazing what you can learn at a convention.
I'm sorry, guys. If she cut up that jogger she didn't use that scalpel.
I had Sanders run a degradation on that same sample. The blood is 50 to 200 years old -- antique, like the scalpel -- ruling out the possibility it was used in the murder of our jogger.
Yeah. I'll be right out.  I have a visitor.
Are you here for a nutritional consultation or to eavesdrop on my investigation?
The, uh, police sent them.
You have three prior complaints in three separate states for owning vicious dogs.
Each complaint is from a mountain state.
No. Only if we find other joggers have turned up dead. What's a liver go for these day
Terry Manning was missing several key organs-- healthy organs.
Pascal. Very impressive. I prefer Buddha, though. 'Even death is not to be feared by those who lived wisely.'
What, are you guys working in bulk now?
She made a protein shake in this yesterday right in front of me.
Get this to DNA --see if this is the jogger's blood.
Possibly drinking them.
We found blood in your kitchen blender. The lab has matched it to the dead jogger.
Why?
I haven't.
Yes. But the insects haven't killed anyone.
The madness of King George.
It's genetic.
You could've tried intravenous hematin.
And so you extracted the organs with the most blood-- the liver, the spleen, the heart.
Unfortunately, a symptom of your condition. But you've been killing people, doctor.
Yes, but the people you'd be feeding off of will still be alive. Cycle of life. 
Sergeant.
Protein powder.
She's a cold blooded killer.
4-19?
Ichabod was horror-struck on perceiving that he was headless.'
Vitreous humor is glazed over.
That means that, six to eight hours ago somebody lost their head. Then ... somebody lost their head.
It's Evaluation Day.
Where's Warrick?
Oh, that's right.  He told me. I forgot.
You're a riot, Alice. You and I are going to work the head case.
Nick, another homicide. 4-19, 40 miles outside of Baker.
Sara, you go with him.
Cath, I'll catch up with you.
Sit down.
Repeat after me. Silk, silk, silk.
At do cows drink?
Cows drink water. They give milk. A simple riddle. Common sense disguised in a puzzle of words, but an excellent barometer for evaluating someone's readiness.
You're not ready.
And that's the reason I have to hold you back.
Anybody who's great at anything, Nick, does it for their own approval not someone else's.
Gary Telgenhoff?
I like it.
What did this?
Fatal blow?
It could've been dark. Bad aim, maybe?
You think a female could do this?
Scared of you.
Really? You want me to prepare it?
Laundry detergent. Works great. It's like peeling off a rubber halloween mask.
Where's your crock-pot, Doc?
The head or the torso?
The bone structure is disproportionate.
Anything not broken?
Suicide by hotel.
What is it?
And you're in.
'Picking up airheads just got easier.'
What does that mean?
So bizarre, human behavior. What you can't cut out of your mind you can always cut out of your photo album.
I got a call from Greg Sanders, at our lab. He found peanut shells on the foot pedals of Victor DaSilva's car.
And voila. 
Mr. Calloway ... is there a remote possibility that Victor DaSilva ever worked at a concession stand of some sort like at a ballpark or ... the secret garden of Siegfried and Roy in the elephants' habitat?
Well, not according to his size 11s.
What are you doing?
What case?
I don't think that is a case.
I hate to be the one to state the obvious, but, uh ... this isn't a human being we're dealing with -- it's an animal.
And every time a dog gets run over you can't go to the vet to examine it.
You're right. I apologize. I was just checking to see where your head was at. For now, you're working alone. Catherine needed Nick.
We got another dead body call.
Maybe. Meantime, you're on standby in case Nick needs backup. 
Your evaluation form. 'Overall performance: Outstanding.' 'Ability to prioritize:' ...
... 'Improvement needed.'
Keep up the good work, Catherine. 
Are those molds dry yet?
That'll never hold up in court, though. We're going to need to make negative molds.
All right, I fed the measurements from the claw end of the hammer. 
Something doesn't seem right about this. Why would you use the claw end of the hammer to kill him and not the hammer end? 
So the footlocker had no headroom.
It's nice that he still had his hands.
The hammer didn't do it?
Well, maybe he was shot somewhere else.
What plastic? You never told me about any plastic.
Victor DaSilva's entire house was covered in plastic. He was having it painted.
Nobody famous.
I have a shoe fetish. I love feet.
I'd tell you not to step on the evidence, but, uh...
Yeah, sure. Jim.
You still got that picture that you took from DaSilva's house?
The earrings. Victor DaSilva was here with someone he cut out of his life.
Excuse me. You recognize this ear?
No. Takeout.
Footprints are almost as reliable 
... as fingerprints and every step tells a story. The first few steps, you were walking. 
See the complete heel, arch and five little piggies? The next few steps, however ... 
... the heel disappears. All of the pressure is put on ball of the foot and toes. Why? Because you were running. And my guess is that, on the day you had a head in your hand.
Mr. Applewhite your footprints ... place you at the crime scene.
But he didn't, did he? That's why you went to his house last night.
The plastic. 
You know ... the plastic that you lay down when you paint a house. The kind of plastic that you, uh ... 
... wrap a dead body in. The plastic that we found your fingerprints on.
We do.
You know that reminds me -- I got to remember to take Greg Sanders to lunch. He did a nice job sniffing out those peanuts.
We are, after this.
Ah-ah-ah. Every nine years and 34 days I feel like sharing. You'll like it. It cleanses you.
You're sitting in it.
This is exactly the same as the last two.
Different M.O., but it's the same signature.
Three or four overpowering blows to the head from a homemade weapon fashioned at the scene. 
Forces her to drink a mixture of sodium amytal as a chemical restraint. 
Overligature of the victim ...  ... and an object rape. Then he strangles her. Ejaculates on the bedsheets. 
And as a final act of degradation he poses her like a pinup.
Listen, no emotions in here.
That's the pattern; it's a continuum. 
Signature killers never want to get caught. And they won't stop until they do.
I wonder what that might mean.
Well, look for prints.
He stalked this woman. He knew how much time he had in this apartment to kill her, and to clean up after himself.
Yeah, have him check peeping toms, too five years back. That's how they get started.
It's about crossing boundaries. It's like, uh, with cake, you know? You're just going to have a little bit of the frosting and you end up eating the entire plate.
You're bringing the FBI in? Why?
I-I don't believe the investigation should go that way, Brian. I mean, roadblocks and special ops?
Gil Grissom, Agent Culpepper.
No, he didn't mention that, either.
I'm not handing it over. I'm willing to work in conjunction with you.
The what?
Unknown Signature Homicide, Metropolitan Las Vegas.
Mr., Uh, Goggle? Gil Grissom.
Would you please give Detective O'Riley a full statement? If we have any more questions, we'll get back to you.
The last time a security guard tried to help me, he ended up dead. But thank you.
I'm late for an autopsy.
He choked her unconscious and then brought her to multiple times. What about the rape?
Be careful, Nicky. The cliché's true. Signatures return to their scenes.
Are we done?
This looks like cotton. Maybe terry cloth. 
Could be silencing them with ... white bath towels?
He brings it with him and takes it away after. So, somewhere, there's evidence of this victim on a towel.
Mmm. Now we just have to find the guy and hope that he hasn't done his laundry.
What meeting? I'm going to evidence.
I didn't.
Would you guys go back to my office, please? I'll be in in a few minutes. 
I'll be happy to pass on any pertinent information you may have to my team.
You first.
Really? What kind of operation?
You're not serious. 
You're going to bait this guy with a human being? This is your big FBI plan 
Understanding him first, completely, so that we can get out ahead of him.
Well, I'm sorry, but he's not going to kill my CSI.
You want to put yourself in the path of a psychotic killer?
Too bad, because that's what turns him on -- women fighting back. Gives him a greater sense of power when he makes his final kill.
Sit down, Sara.
Not yet. He knows just enough about forensics to be dangerous. He thinks he's throwing us off track by planting confederate hairs. He probably shaves his head maybe his entire body as DNA protection.
He may gag his victims using a garden-variety bath towel which he then takes with him as part of his murder kit. He will go after another tall brunette and the torture will be worse. But this time, he won't ejaculate. At least not at the scene.
Signature killers always know their next victim. But they don't know him 
... until he tortures, rapes and kills them.
I was expecting something a little more elemental.
Yeah, well, he's not as smart as he thinks, you know? I mean, ketchup is not going to mask the DNA in his semen.
I'm sure.
You've been to talking to our Sheriff.
Yeah, yeah, I know. And if I don't shape up he going to have Ecklie take over the case.
Ah. Now that the trees are gone, I can almost see the forest.
Millander stages suicides in bathtubs with paternal figures. This guy's signature is overkill rage against young women. It's completely different.
When did you become friendly with the Feds? I didn't think you had that in you.
I told Culpepper that he could not have Sara.
This is a pretty flimsy excuse to get your circus up and running, don't you think?
This is action for action's sake Culpepper. You're risking my CSI's life.
Listen to me, Sara. If we study his past, we can predict his future. 
Whoa.  That guy's coming back.
Culpepper ... 
What was your first clue?
Sometimes, the hardest thing to do is to do nothing.
Hmm.
Occasionally I'm struck by the absence of evidence.
The lamp -- cord's still attached. All the others, he yanked the cords off. Look at the table. Books aren't even disturbed.
First time in a hotel? First time he didn't come in through the window?
Who's that guy?
Husband? Let's bring him in.
Witness? 
Suspect.
What did you get?
What about the object-rape? Indeterminate polymer?
Different how?
You liked to play golf, too.
These are your golf clubs. We found them in your hotel room. I prefer a titanium driver, Mr. Walden. I'd like to see what you use, but your carrier is locked.
So you won't mind opening it, though?
Well, so I can see if the leather on your club handles matches the leather from the object used to violate your wife.
Well, if this 'character' ... killed your wife? How did he get your clubs out of the case without the keys? 
Or, for that matter back into the case after he killed your wife?
Can I have a word with you outside... please?
You can't charge him for the other women.
For the murder of his wife, maybe but I am certain that he didn't do the others.
He read the papers -- he piggybacked on top of the killer.
Who knows? Convenient way out of a lousy marriage? He's not our guy.
Go ahead. Pull rank. But that hotel crime scene was staged to look like the signature's.
If you stop and think, you'll see it.
I'm telling you, this guy did not kill those other women.
No.
No, we don't.
He's not viable, Brian.
For those who have to ask, no answer could suffice.
Oh, do I get the weekend off?
No ...  I'm off.
It's all Catherine. She's the boss. 
Good luck.
I'm not used to having people in my house.
Did you come here to tell me about your new job?
You don't want to be a Supervisor?
We should reexamine each victim--all the evidence pertaining to each one individually.
Well, then go back to your crime scenes and look for a persistence of fibers.
Something's better than nothing.
Excuse me? Hunter?
Uh-uh. 
You recognize any of these women?
Do you know them?
Yeah, 'I don't know' doesn't get it, pal. DNA's like fingerprints. No two samples are alike. You were in these women's bedrooms.
Would you be able to recognize any of these guys?
Yeah. Probably in little hollowed-out packets of ketchup.
Could have been the staging area. Maybe he wears his murder kit.
Call Brass, tell him to meet you guys there. Let me know.
Grissom.
I remember that guy.
Hmm. Little lie, big lie?
Goggle.
Syd Goggle.
Mr. Goggle?
Syd Goggle.
These investigations are always in flux. Am I, uh, interrupting your laundry?
You were so meticulous about so many things. Shaving. The gloves. Planted evidence. That's why I don't understand why you'd bring towels that eventually could be tracked. 
Strong's gym. That's where the women told you to you to get lost, right? Stuffing club towels down their throat make your point?
In theory. But the truth is every object is changed by its owner. By his habits. His ... washing machine, for instance. His detergent. 
Your towel is caught in the agitator. 
Now, see, that's going to leave distinctive marks on the fabric, Syd. And that's just the beginning. I've had a look at your garbage.
Your garbage is in a public area ... plain sight. It's enough for me to get a warrant.
Yeah. How did you know I was here?
I just wanted to talk to him.
I believe Catherine was going to requisition one.
I never should have put you in that position, Catherine. I'm sorry.
I admire that.
Here.
Congratulations, Nicky, my boy. You are now a CSI Level Three.
I just off the phone with the Sheriff. He says he wants me to run the unit.
They say I got to let you go.
I don't care what the book says. I lost one good person today, I don't want to lose another. 
Here.
We don't consider it a joke at all.
Mr. Garris, please. Sometimes, if you listen closely you can hear a lot.
Right. Where do you hear nothing in Las Vegas?
The desert.  And, judging by what sounds like a low frequency buzz in the background, possibly near power lines.
I listen.
Mr. Garris ... it's my experience that, in situations like this if you want to go fast, go slow.
Nick, tell lab to do a reverse algorithm on that tape and then get it into enhancement.
You've been a Level Three for what, two weeks?
No, no, no. I barely heard you.
Dirt.
I never wear it. It interferes with the job.
Hmm.
Halothane, maybe.
'Looks like a professional job,' I think you said. 
Care to amend your evaluation? I mean, if the guy forgets the rag he used to knock her out, he can't be much of a pro.
Sara, that was a seminar. This is real. Pebbles, tile -- the front is all concrete.
In an otherwise spotless house.
Possible. As of now, that's about all we have, so ... I guess we follow the dirt.
We have an entire forensics lab working on this.
Yeah.
This dirt has interesting properties.
The gold flecks -- that's easy -- it's gold. The little gray squiggles? Cyanide.
No. Did you know that Nevada produces 80% of the country's gold? Miners drop cyanide powder into the dirt and it draws the gold to the surface.
I had a case five years ago. We found a skeleton in an abandoned gold mine. I thought it was a murder. Turned out the guy passed out drunk and the cyanide leached into his system.
You know, it's funny but every case teaches me something about the next.
Gold mine -- it's possible that's where he's got her.
True, but how many are near power lines within range of the drop zone?
It's a pack of coyotes. The sensor picks up any form of body heat, two-legged or four-legged.
Come on, give us something two-legged.
Yeah, well, we'll circle it again.
What was that? Go back.
There. 
Swing around! 
My god, she's below the surface.
Ground team is right behind us. I'll guide them in. 
She's got to be right up here.
Here! She's here!
Got to get her air! GRISSOM: Give me a pick -- an ax-- something. GRISSOM: Get away. Let me get in there.
Pull it!
Okay, we're going to pull her up.
Sara, get me something to cut this tape.
You okay? GRISSOM: You're going to be okay now. GRISSOM: Get this off.
Okay.
You okay?
Victor-18. Brass, do you hear me? 
We got the package, and she's still alive. ...
... Brass, are you reading me? Over.
You have to see the birthday present I got for your daughter.
I got one of these chem labs when I was six. I almost blew up the whole house. 
Yeah, what kid doesn't want a party?
The victim's ready at Desert Palm.
We'll play with these later.
And you never saw the person, huh?
You know how you got the bruising around your eye?
Sure. I'd like to get a blood sample from you, though, if I could.
You've got scratches on your arm. If we can find traces of your blood in Rundle's truck we can match the DNA -- make our case against him that much stronger.
Yeah, well, we didn't get any prints off the duct tape, our audio guys are working on stuff. Right now, we need something more concrete if we want to prove that he did it.
Me, too.
So?
Did you let him know you were recording him?
Thank you.
Sounds like our guy to me.
Survey says ... perfect match to the naked ear. Now, where's my spectrograph, so the defense attorneys can't claim that our alterations were altered?
That's 'cause the blue line is directly on top of the yellow line which makes it green. It's a perfect match.
What do you do now, Nick?
But you tell Brass to drag his heels 'cause you still got work to do.
Come see me after you raise Brass.
I want you to find something new on that tape.
You know what the defense attorneys will do with that? That's who you're up against, in the end. 
People leave us clues, Nick. They speak to us in thousands of different ways. It's our job to make sure that we've heard everything they've said. Anything less is reasonable doubt.
You any better?
Your little major-minor blowup about Lindsey not wanting a party.
No.
And that's because of you?
Well, then she'll be fine. I mean, look at you.
Yeah.
I love my work.
So, you found Laura's hairs here ... passenger side, front seat?
Yeah. So?
So she wasn't bound at all?
So, you're saying she never inhaled the halothane?
How pleased am I that I got a sample of her blood? 
So you can go check at the lab, see how it turned out.
I know.
What's up?
No deals. We know what Chip has to offer.
Laura Garris.
The Accomplice.
You got something that can't wait, Nick?
Good. I'll listen to it right now.
You did it. It doesn't matter how we got here. Just remember this.
Who's dead?
Because she ended up underground in a box. 
Greed.
But you became pretty good friends, didn't you?
Thing is, Jack, I tend not to believe people. People lie. The evidence doesn't lie.
Then you both drove East towards Sandfill mine. He probably told you about some little line shack or something where you could stay while he picked up the ransom money. But then, all of a sudden, he pulled over -- probably made some excuse.
I bet, right away, in your gut, you knew something was up. And then, just a few minutes later you knew for sure.
That's when, I believe, you got your black eye.
And then, finally, you were unconscious. He duct-taped your hands and he buried you. 
Let's listen to Chip's message, okay? Remember, Jack when I told you you could hear a lot if you listened?
It's amazing what we can do with the new forensic audio programs. Enhance sounds, isolate them.
A car went by when Chip was on the phone to you, Jack. Scared you, didn't it, Laura? Thought it might be the police?
Let's hear it once more without that annoying car.
We already have you both for about 25 years, minimum.
Self-preservation. She rats on him, she rats on herself.
Like a ginsu through a banana.
Yeah, probably, but under what circumstances? You don't wear flippers at a five-star restaurant. Why would you wear three-inch heels at a lake?  So, Watson? The game is afoot.
I believe this goes with that.  Divers recovered the body about a half a mile east of Calville Marina.
Will you collect a rape kit?
How's it look for prints?
Come on, Catherine, my hand's too big.
It's the only way we can print her. Her skin on your hand should fit like a leather glove.
May I take your hand?
On behalf of the decedent I thank you.
I think we're going to know who she is by lunchtime.
We should contact her family.
The coroner said she'd been in the water for two days. Where's the husband now?
Sure. Thanks, Jenna.
Mr. Barger, my name is Gil Grissom.
This is Catherine Willows. We're forensics investigators. Sit down.
When was the last time you saw her?
Would you be willing to give us a DNA sample, sir?
By law, we need a warrant, unless you were willing to volunteer it.
Hey, maestro, what's the deal on our floater?
Excuse me. Professor? What's up with our floater?
That's funny. I liked the husband for this.
I promise.
You're asking the wrong guy.
You were married. You tell me.
Hey. 
How's court?
Look, go home. Take a day. You're been working your ass off.
I'm grateful, Warrick. I'm glad you're back. And I owe you a party.
Yeah, I made you a CSI three.
You'll see it in your next paycheck.
Mm ...
Yeah.
Coroner just called. They're waiting for us.
Meet you at the car.
There was no water in her lungs?
So we think she was raped killed, then dumped in the lake.
'Cause it's the only place within ten miles of Calville Bay that serves calamari.
I come here for calamari.
No. Sometimes I have a beer with it.
Would you happen to know this 'good tipper''s name?
Could you tell us about your affair with Wendy?
What about your wife?
Tuesday night you and Wendy had dinner at the grille? Where'd you go after that?
Why'd you take the boat?
Where is ... the boat?
I believe he had an affair.
Mr. Barger, what are you doing here?
Do you know Mr. Swelco?
Mr. Barger, this is a time when you ought to let us do our job. You've been through a terrible ordeal. You've asked us to keep you posted and I promise we will keep you posted.
Drive safely.
No, we don't, Catherine. We have to tell him how he died. Just the facts, without all the other stuff.
You mean me.
The African Red Baboon Tarantula -- the most feared of all arachnids. But basically harmless.
I think you scared him. All his hairs are standing up.
Was it at the Marina?
My spider sense says it wasn't.
Yeah? Grissom.
How?
Just South of Barring Point Bridge? What color is the boat?
Well done, Catherine. Well done.
let's get the boat back to the garage.
We work as a team. We're not competing.
'Two roads diverged in a yellow wood and, sorry I could not travel both.'
Very good, Greg.
But actually, in this case, Mr. Frost does not apply. When you have a partner you each take a road. That's how you find a missing boat.
And you've narrowed it down to just two suspects?
I told you this?
And this theory is based on...?
I'm going to the garage to meet Catherine.  You keep thinking, Butch. That's what you're good at.
Yeah.
Blood.
Well, maybe she fought back. Either way, we got to call Brass. Tell them to bring the boyfriend in.
How's it going?
Mr. Swelco. Why don't we go in here sit down.
You just compromised our investigation.
Knowing how she died, yes. Knowing that she had an affair -- how does that bring closure?
You can't make this about Eddie. Look, you hurt our case because your ex hurt you.
You can't give him anything, Catherine. We're scientists. We're not psychiatrists or victims' rights advocates.
Technically, it's a townhouse. And the crosswords are advanced, not genius. But you're right. I'm deficient in a lot of ways. But I never screw up one of my cases with personal stuff.
She ran out of gas.
Get in the boat. Pull the engine cord.
Get in the boat.
Just indulge me, please?
That's not the point.
Pull it again.
Go on.
More.
Harder. 
Go on.
How does your shoulder feel?
I know what happened to Wendy.
She says good night to Swelco ...
... and gets in the boat. Halfway home, the boat runs out of gas.
... Stranded in the middle of the lake, she panics. Starts pulling on the engine cord.
... She pulls so hard, she dislocates her shoulder and falls forward. 
... Wendy goes under, where she remains until a barge's propeller severs her leg.
She died before she ever hit the water.
Well, sometimes it's about what didn't happen.
Look ... could we have a truce?
Good. 
But let me do all the talking to the husband and the boyfriend.
I'll meet you outside, okay?
Did it go okay?
The fewer people who know about this the better. 
I'm proud of you. You know, Judge Cohen's got a lot of soldiers.
You know, I can only help you out so much. After that, it's up to you.
Hello?! Mr. Swelco?! Mr. Swelco?! Mr. Swelco?
He didn't kill her.
Maggots. This kid's been here awhile. 
No gunshot wounds. No stab marks. No signs of strangulation.
Not if you're being chased. 
Look at the foot patterns leading up to the body. See the strides? This kid was running. 
See the left foot impression? It's straight; that's normal. 
But look at the right foot impression. It's turned outward. Almost
Based on these prints, it's hard to tell.
Fear.  Someone chased this kid to death.
No, yes, I did. Thank you.
Paperwork, paper clips, paper-punchers -- all these people want me to do is push paper; nobody wants me to solve crimes.
Yeah, the grass is always greener, Catherine.
That's what this was about-- bookies.
Warrick, you and I are on the four-nineteen -- our dead body in the desert. 
Sara, dead body of your own. Dumpsite out near Henderson.
Catherine, Verbum Dei Charter School. Four-twenty homicide. The school dean was killed in his office. Suspect called it in; could be self-defense.
Suspect's not a kid. It's the woman who founded the school. Take Nicky with you.
This kid was dry as a bone.
From exposure?
Try the Forensic Medical Journal. Read the four canons on the cause of death: Homicide, suicide, natural and unexplained. Talks about fear in the last part of 'unexplained.'
You want to know what killed this kid? Benihana the maggots.
Tox the maggots we found on the victim. Whatever he ingested has probably evaporated from the sun. But the maggots are like little refrigerators. They preserve what we digest for longer periods of time.
Yes.
What's that?
Did you guys drop anything that night? Ecstasy, crystal, 'G'?
Bobby, we found a body that matches your description of Eric. Would you be willing to identify him?
Is this your friend?
Which means?
Jimson Weed. 'dry as a bone, red as a beet blind as a bat, mad as a hatter.'
Internet insomnia.
Thanks, Warrick.
Most drugs derive from plants. That doesn't make them safe.
Who sold you this 'tea'?
Is there any way for us to track this, uh, DJ person?
Bobby? Would you be able to recognize the guy who sold you the Jimson?
And? ...
Nose spray? He had a cold.
Aluminum's the odd man out.
Jimson tea. I like to see what I'm dealing with.  Doesn't look lethal, does it?
You know what the japanese tea ceremony signifies?
That every human encounter is a singular occasion which can never recur again in exactly the same way.
Everything applies, Warrick. That's the beauty part.
Teenage wasteland.
Yeah.
Hi.
Uh, thank you. You're a total stranger to me.
Bobby, wait!
Break it up! Bobby, stop it!
Selling jimsonweed to kids.
You sent, uh, Bobby over here and his friend on quite a trip the other night.
Well, if you're gonna break the law, Jim you've gotta know the law.
What do you say, Ethan? These seeds look familiar?
'Cause you know the law, don't you, Ethan? 'Mandatory suspended sentence for first possession.' Yeah?
Let me tell you something, Humbert. You're twice the age of these kids and most of them couldn't find their ass with a map. You prey on innocent children concocting god-knows-what from god-knows-where selling Russian roulette in a bottle and you think we came all the way out here to bust you for 'possession', you dumb punk?  I'm gonna get you for murder. 
Cool.
This Ethan was selling jimsonweed tea at the desert rave. I believe Eric drank the most toxic part -- the dregs, the bottom of the batch the part that's full of seeds.
There's three things I got a real problem with: Guys that hit their wives, sexual assault on children and the scum that deal death to kids.
We need the pods to do a DNA match and we don't have them.
It's why I live.
Yeah. Nobody wanted to put that pusher in jail more than I did. Evidence sets him free.
It doesn't matter how I feel. The evidence only knows one thing: The truth. It is what it is.
I was flying to a seminar in New Hampshire a couple summers ago. I was sitting on the plane next to this philosophy professor from Harvard. He told me this story about how, every morning he takes a leak right after his three-hour philosophy class. He'd flush the toilet there'd be this tiny, brown spider fighting for its life against the swirling water. Come back the next day, flush same spider clawing its way back from oblivion. A week goes by, he decides to liberate the spider. Grabs a paper towel, scoops him up sets him on the floor in the corner of the stall. Comes back the next day ... what do you think happened to the spider?
On his back, eight legs in the air. Why? Because one life imposed itself on another. Right then, I realized where we stand. I understood our role. We don't impose our will on a spider. We don't impose our hopes on the evidence.
You'll be back.
You're a creature of habit.
I, uh ... just wanted you to know that Eric didn't die from Jimson tea. It didn't have the chemical toxicity to kill him. The seeds weren't strong enough.
Is your arm all right?
May I take a look?
I'm a PhD, not an M.D.
Bobby ... this bite is not from an insect.
Hi. 
I found a bite mark on Bobby's arm and I think it might be human.
Not really.
I don't know, Jenna. This whole case is going from bad to worse. I mean, usually it's a body, it's a specimen, but when it involves kids, I just can't ...
That's where Bobby Taylor works. Jenna, I need a mold of Eric's teeth ...
... and an impression of Bobby's arm.
It's not about memory now, Bobby. It's about the evidence and the evidence ... sucks.
You and Eric bought Jimson tea from Ethan that night.
That's why I tend to believe it was an act of self-protection. The lights were scaring him. At the same time, we conjecture that you were suffering auditory hallucinations. Both of these symptoms are routine with this drug.
I'm afraid that it is. The evidence tells us that Bobby suffocated Eric.
I know, Bobby, but you did.
This is a mold of the bite mark that we took from your arm today. 
This is a mold of Eric's mouth, postmortem.
You overpowered him, he suffocated ... and then, finally, the noise stopped.
Good. I hope you win.
Away.
Hang on a minute. 
Okay, I'm there.
Metacarpal, phalanges ... no question about it. 
Hold on, Nick.
When a body decomposes in concrete it leaves an air pocket, vacuum-sealed. We do this right, it'll open like a jar of pickles.
By law, you got to disclose everything -- three bedrooms, two baths, and a skeleton.
Okay, I'm late again. Nick's going to work with me on that unidentified body at Summercliff.
O.I.S. at the jockey club.
Good, I want you to double up. Listen, these deals are never easy so keep me informed, please.
Well, this qualifies: 4-26. But I can't give you the case.
Conflict of interest. The alleged rape victim is an exotic dancer.
No. Suspect's your ex-husband.  He's asking for you, but you can't take it.
All right.  Do what you can. But after the preliminary, you pass it off, okay?
Based on the auricular surface I'd say she died when she was about twenty.
It's in the hips. Pelvic bone is definitely female. You know, for a ladies' man you don't know much about bone structure.
Yeah, how?
No. The gouges on her ribs are unusual. The instrument had to be ... slightly curved with some kind of serrated edge. Like crocodile teeth. Whatever killed this girl was not a traditional weapon.
That's the rule. 
Who are you?
It's a six-by-three-foot section. When the concrete dried it preserved a partial impression of our Jane Doe. Did you find out anything about the house?
That would explain why the body was so desiccated.
Well, if it wasn't for a leaky pipe she might have been down there forever.
It's harmless.
The tarantula's touch is very gentle.
Teri Miller does not need an introduction.  I need you to make me a face.
They told me you were the top forensic artist in the country. 
It doesn't really look like anything.
So teach me.
Brown eyes? I thought you decided she was nordic.
Yeah. I'm sure someone needs closure and somebody else needs to go to jail.
I don't know. In my experience people usually remember a beautiful woman. 
Uh, Nick, weren't you going to go and do the, uh... 
At the ... ?
Did that make you happy?
You're not still in love with Eddie?  Catherine, you have to hand off the case. Warrick can just double up.
Okay. You have to pass off the case. If you compromise the investigation there's no going back. You could hurt Eddie just as much as you could help him.
Hey. I've already seen the marks on the ribs.
No.
Salt and sand. Killed at the beach?
She was quite an athlete, huh?
Did she scuba dive?
Did, uh, Fay ... before she disappeared, go on any vacation? Go diving or spend time at the beach?
And she, uh ... lived here with you until she disappeared?
And the, uh ... police interviewed him after she disappeared?
Well, how do you know that?
Did they... ever fight?
I heard about your eyewitness. A valet who joyrides. He sounds reliable.  So, uh, how's the thing going on Eddie Willows?
The thing that I told Catherine to pass off to you.
Get ahold of the DMV?
Warrick? Why would you call the DMV on a rape charge?
Really?
You so much as breathe on the evidence, it's contaminated and I end up the bad guy.
What's the status?
Vigorous?
'He said. She said?' It's about the evidence, Catherine. 
And you may not like where it takes you.
Ask me what?
It means she wasn't killed in Hawaii. 
Other than that ... he has no idea.
Cut it out! Not in my lab, pal.
Yeah. I hope I never have to. Nick, walk this guy out the door.
Sara.
Yeah, I know one thing: My guys will not bend and they will not be intimidated.
Ma'am, my name is Gil Grissom. This is Nick Stokes.
Mr. Hendler, we're criminalists from the Las Vegas police department.
We're investigating the disappearance of Fay Green. May we come in?
Yes, I'm afraid we did. She'd been dead for quite a while.
Thank you.
A trigger and a lionfish.
Interesting choices. Violent, carnivorous predators.
Mr. Hendler, at any time, was your fish tank over here?
Did it ever overflow?  Break?
You said I could look anywhere, right?
Got a pocket knife?
Pops out, pops in. 
What do you find inside an hourglass? 
Mr. Hendler, I think the tank was over here. I think it broke. I think you got water and artificial sand all over the place.
Fine, we'll go. We'll be back ... with a warrant.
Summercliff Housing Development. A plumber, perhaps?
Why else would you be so excited? 
Hey! You weren't going to say good-bye to me?
The ones that got away.
I see you've cleaned house. I thought you might.
I'm working, sir. Officer, would you hit the lights, please?
Surface is non-reactive.
Let's try the ALS.
Luminol works on the surface. ALS chases the protein molecules in blood. It actually penetrates the wood. These floorboards are all made of maple -- high-end-but they've been lacquered.
Yeah. 
Turn it off, Nick. Officer, hit the lights, please. 
Mr. Hendler let me tell you what I think happened to Fay. On the night of her disappearance, the two of you got in a heated argument.
Suffering a concussion, Fay falls to the floor. In the heat of the moment you decide to make it final. But Fay surprises you: She fights back. She pushes you off. She crawls a few feet away and you move in for the final attack. 
One thing that I don't know, though. What did you use to kill her?
Well, whatever the weapon it wasn't a knife, but it worked. You drove her body over to Summercliff where you were employed and you buried her in wet concrete.
Five years is a long time but eventually the past catches up to everybody.
I'll ride along with the cops. Bring homicide up to speed. This is now a fresh crime scene.
'The instrument had to be slightly curved with some kind of serrated edge like crocodile teeth...'
Mrs. Hendler. 
Nick, don't move.
Please. I don't want to fire my gun any more than you do. For five years, you've been washing the blood off your hands. 
You okay, Nick?
Come on.
Hey.
Did the count change since you called me?
What's the matter with your guys?
Put your equipment down, son. 
Put these on. I'm going to do a preliminary walk-through. You're going to take my notes. 
Don't touch that! I want everything exactly the way it was. 
The air smells like copper. Lots of blood. Breathe through your mouth.
Male caucasian approximately 40 years old lying in a pool of blood. 
No drag marks. Body does not appear to have been moved. Multiple stab wounds to the back and neck. Looks like a single-edged blade. Force to such a degree that the left and right internal jugular veins have been transected. Head faces west. Feet pointing east. Approximately two feet from the north wall, one foot from the south.
You don't sleep, do you?
Somebody left a message. I need to see the rest of it.
Female Caucasian. Appears to be one stab wound to the throat. Transection of left and right carotid arteries with exsanguinating hemorrhage. No defense marks. Cursory opinion: She was killed in her sleep.
Do you feel this?
But there's something else.
I want the paramedics that were in this house back here immediately -- police escort. Get them on this front lawn now.
Call dispatch. You tell my entire graveyard shift that I want them here ASAP -- all of them-- no exceptions. 
Sara, those photos -- blown up times ten. Tell the lab that we need every forensics tool available to us here right away. This is the only crime scene in Las Vegas tonight.
Sergeant, may I?
Tina ... I'm very sorry about what happened to you tonight. But everything we take from your house can help us find out what happened to your family.
Soon. Detective?
Thanks.
Hi. Is your name Brenda? 
I'm trying to find out who hurt your family. Do you think you could help me? Did anyone come into your room tonight? Through the door? Through the window maybe? 
Okay.
The buffalo? Who's the buffalo? 
Brenda?
First rule for this crime scene: Do not do any interviews. Second rule: Don't talk to the Sheriff either.
The killer was here not two hours ago. He left part of himself behind. Catherine, I need you inside, mapping and blood samples.
Nick, Warrick-- the perimeter. I want to know how he got here how he got in, how he got out, and how he left.
Hey, stop! Evidence!
You guys will never get it, will you?
Knife drawer. One missing.
I think the suspect's been in this house before. And this is the first place they stopped tonight. 
Good. Linoleum. The best surface.
It's not a toy, O'Riley. It's an electrostatic dust print lifter.
Like a supercharged lint remover only it lifts footprints. Possibly our killer's.
Relax. I just want to know where you walked in the house and who you touched in there.
Show me the bottom of your shoe.
Now yours. 
You fellows were both in the kitchen.
All right. Yours are the only clean prints I found. Thanks. You can go back to work.
I don't know that.
I don't rule anything out.
Sheriff?
Nothing.
As soon as I have something, you'll have something.
I could speak volumes about Conrad Ecklie, but I have a crime scene to process so ... you'll have to excuse me.
I need you to transport the little girl to the police department. Brass is waiting for you.
Sara ... I need one of us with that little girl.
I want to see all of their personal property -- clothes, jewelry, whatever they have on.
Good. You buy this cult thing?
Whoever did it killed the mother first. In her sleep, quick.
Husband woke up. Ran to protect his kids. 
The killer nicked him here. And then finished him off down the hall.
Yeah. It's a hole. We need to fill it. If we start from the inside and fan out whoever's left at the scene ...
The teen daughter?
I wonder if they call him 'buffalo.'
Tina ... do you ... go out with anyone special?
Are any of them ... called 'Buffalo'?
Bidi?
That you, Warrick?
What, are you working for OSHA now?
mm-hmm.
That's good.
That's very good.
If your whole family was murdered, wouldn't you run to them to check to see if they were still alive?
This is a Lady Macbeth.
'Out, out, damn spot.' There's not a trace of blood on the teen daughter's clothing. Not a spot.
Yeah. I need you back here right away. The Collins Case is busting out.
Please do.
Mr. Ecklie.
He should go to a sports book. I hear the Stardust is good.
Teams, Conrad? I didn't know this was a competition.
Really? Didn't graveyard beat day shift in softball last summer?
I think it was 14-3.
Let's talk about what else we have. Tina Collins' pajama top from the murder scene without a drop of blood on it.
Bidi? Bidi? I thought you found a cigarette and a match behind the house.
What did you find out about the psych exam on the little girl?
Respond how?
And ... what are you doing about it now?
But there was no blood on you.
The evidence is telling a different story.
It's not going to happen, Tina.
She won't speak.
Hmm?
'Yet who would have thought the old man to have so much blood in him?'
That's Shakespeare.
The lawyer's pleading him guilty.
I care. I don't like holes. What are they hiding?
Did you collect the property from the Collins family?
I told one of your assistants to make sure that I got them.
Ecklie! 
I want everything right now.
The Collins case is my shift. You are completely off base.
Oh, I'm sure, if you could, you would have by now. Where is it?
That's what so sad, Conrad. You think of this as a career.
The buffalo.
Sara?
Sara. When they examined the little Collins girl did they check for sexual abuse?
Have some ultraviolet photographs taken.
Grissom.
Off? How?
He was coming out of it?
Somebody was all over this kid.
We have forensic evidence that your father sexually abused your sister. 
We also know ... that he was in her room the night of the murders.
Blood drops. They fall a certain way depending on the motion of the victim. 
Something horrible happened in that house, didn't it, Tina? Long before the night of the murders.
But why your mother? And why your brothers?
You?
Brenda is ... ? And who is ... ?
Good work.
It'll be back to normal in 24 hours.
It's Royce Harmon all over again. 
What do you think? 'Suicide' note in the same place?
Not weird. Intentional.
It's backward. 
Would you excuse me a minute?
You're back.
Shibley, take this recorder to the print lab. 
Have Manny dust it and run prints on it right away.
Photos. Thank you.
Hey! You guys want an assignment slip or a pink slip?
I don't know. We'll see. Here. 410. Reckless driver out at Hoover Dam. Car went over a cliff. Anonymous caller. Could be foul play.
Hey! Work together tonight. All right?
Okay, we're going off the board tonight.
First victim, Royce Harmon. About three months ago, Brass and I found this guy dead in his own bathtub, but his 'suicide' was staged. I think the killer has killed again. 
Photos of tonight's victim: Stuart Rampler. Play the 'pick six things that are different' game. Bet you lose.
The killer purchased one of these rubber hands laced the fingertips with cooking spray and proceeded to place false prints all around the crime scene.
Some guy who works in a warehouse making Halloween paraphernalia. Scary masks, air-brushed tombstones, rubber hands. Turns out he used his own hand for the mold.
We split up. You and I go to the coroner. Sara, you go to the hotel. Dust every inch of that bathroom. Here. Use this --
'Red Creeper.' My own concoction.
Well, serious case, serious print powder. Be thorough. Don't take anything for granted.
Similarities?
What else, Doc? My mind is painting.
Okay. Let's play it out.
The killer's got him at gunpoint, right? Standing over him like this.
But this time, things got messy. Royce Harmon didn't fight back. That's why there was no muzzle bruising to his temple.
But the killer just lost round one. We know how he gets his vics into the tub and we know that both deaths were homicides.
Mrs. Harmon, we believe that the person who did this to your son may have done it to someone else and we need your help.
Anything, Mrs. Harmon -- a home movie? A recorded message off your answering machine?
He's a jazz producer. Specializes in audio. Does voice comparisons for me from time to time. He hears in perfect pitch.
He's gifted.
I'm sorry to hear that.
Catherine Willows, Disco Placid.
How are we coming with our voice comparisons?
What is that?
Play them side by side.
It's 'fill in the blanks.'
Royce Harmon, born August 17, 1958. Stuart Rampler, born August 17, 1957. One year apart.
Maybe he's telling us, in order to go forward, go back. Sara, go back one more year -- August 17, 1956. See if anything pops up with the same M.O.
Can we see the print?
Can you separate them?
Someone within the department? 
What?
Anything you have to say to me you can say to her.
I expected that. He's the guy who makes the rubber hands. I've already cleared him. What about the compliance -- the bottom print?
How? I wear gloves at every crime scene. I was printed for the job. We all were.
I get it. Whoever it is is telling me that he's got me under his thumb.
Mr. Millander?
Gil Grissom.
I'm okay. What are you making?
Yeah, it reminds me of our supervisor on days.
I have a couple of questions regarding that staged suicide. Remember?
Not too well.
Sure. 
I envy you, Mr. Millander. I do. You can work by yourself ... no one around to bother you. You just ... do what you do. I'd love to have that kind of autonomy. 
I know what you mean. 
Thank you.
Do you remember the, uh, rubber hand mold that you made from your own hand?
Well, whoever the perpetrator is has killed again. And again, your print came up. So I was hoping you could help me.
The last time we talked, you told me that you had sold several thousand units last Halloween?
Could you provide me with a list of your distributors?
I was hoping to do a credit card search ... go back ten days before the first murder occurred ... try and run some names ... see if any priors pop up.
Of course you do. I'm sure you do it well.
Which one? The first victim or the second?
ATM machines take photographs every three seconds. Maybe we can get a Kodak moment of this guy. I want the machine here. I want prints. I want film. I want everything.
Yeah, the whole machine.
There. There's our guy ... handing it off.
Life ... like holding a dove.
Hold it too hard ... 
Hold it too soft ... 
Brass's guys are looking for him. Okay ... significance of the flipping?
'I'm going to keep doing this over and over again until I get Justice.'
Hmm. How'd you find him?
Jim, call the steak house at Circus. Get this fella a porterhouse. 
Now, how did this man approach you?
You still have it? 
How tall was this man? Was he ... shorter or taller than Mr. Brass here?
By a hair, do you mean the hair of a rabbit or the hair of grizzly bear?
Okay. Let's say he was five-ten. What else do you remember about this man?
... stutter.
Paul Millander. He set me up.  Son of a bitch! I had him and I let him go!
You ever make any rubber hands?
So when I picked up the hand he must have lifted my print, Catherine.
Sara, we'll be on headsets. Run everything you can on Paul Millander. Use forenz-l use nexus, search anything and everything.
Keep looking. Listen, check the business database. Search word:
How can that be? I was just there.
What is it?
Check the date.
We have nothing.
So ... dead guy in first class?
Coroner pronounce?
Eyewitnesses?
Where are they now?
Point of disturbance: Cockpit door. Bloody handprint.  Looks like foot impression. Ballpark shoe size ... ten to eleven maybe. 
I want this whole plane taped off ... nose to tail and wing to wing.
I've got a dead body, a crime scene with wings. Something very wrong happened in this plane.
Sheriff?
I don't follow you.
I don't even know if we have a homicide yet. First reports indicate he had some kind of an episode.
You running for mayor?
So? What do you think?
I think we got ten witnesses all singing the same song. Deceased went berserk. Unless we find something else in the evidence, that's what happened. Catherine ...
Thank you. Warrick, go with. 
Brass has them all assembled in the lounge. Assume there's evidence on everyone. Nick, go with the coroner. Sara and I will work the plane. This is a mobile crime scene. It might not be here tomorrow.
When did you become aware that there was a problem in the cabin?
How much time did you spend with him?
In that time did you notice anything that would explain his behavior?
Was he drunk maybe, or on drugs?
Dr. Kiera Behrle, 3-E. Emily Behrle, 3-F. Nate Metz, 2C.
Nate Metz.
Let me guess who was sitting in 3C. 
Blood drops ... away from the main event.
Could just be a bloody nose.
Lou Everett.
So, any bites?
If nothing criminal happened on that flight ... why isn't anybody talking to us?
Then we get to play hide-and-seek.
I just got off the phone with Nick. The coroner did some carving on our dead guy. She found intercranial bleeding, thoracic hemorrhaging a ruptured spleen. And, for what it's worth the guy also had a fever.  You find anything interesting?
Victim had defensive wounds on his hand.
The other half of the wine bottle ... from 2E. So ... Marlene in 2E slashes the victim. He's bleeding. Where does he go?
No 'patent' evidence. But if there's blood present there may be latent evidence.
Thank you.
Well. Would you hand me the Christopher Columbus from my field kit? Thank you.
No... but there's protein in it.
You know, high altitude enhances the entire sexual experience. It increases the euphoria.
Hand me a swab, please.
A magazine.
'Applied Psychodynamics in Forensic Science.'
I'll get you a subscription. 
Now, cite your source.
Yeah.
You started it.
Yeah. I think, due to your, uh ... firsthand knowledge and experience in airplane bathrooms, you should do the swab.
Yeah. 
Fibers drawn from his pants maybe?
Nick's working on it.
Bring me the jacket. If I do heel impressions I'll need something to compare it to. See you in twenty.
... I need their shoes.
Because you're the 'people' person, right?
Please?
I used to have a pair of these.
Max.
Yeah, that's a match. Okay.
That distinctive mark on the circular tread... hmm.
Mm-hmm.  Makes sense. Okay. Thanks, Catherine.
We have a ping-pong ball. We just need to find the paddles.
Probably in the first compartment.
The doctor in 3E told Catherine that she performed CPR on the victim. Check the inside of the paddles. See if there's any bio gel on them.
Yeah, and if she didn't know, the Flight Attendant sure did.
Sir, it's been a long night, and we don't have much time before our crime scene flies away.
You were sitting in 1A.
The blind leading the blind.
Can you identify the voices?
How do you mean?
Mr. Cash, you got to help me. I got eight eyewitnesses with various stories. I put them all in a mixing bowl, add eggs, milk stick it in the oven, and all I got is a limp souffle.
I got two hours till I lose my crime scene to the Feds. Tell me you have something.
That's more than I got.
Tight fit.
Flight Attendant gave him two aspirin. Why?
Swelling of the brain.
Is that what killed him -- encephalitis?
A, B, C, D or all of the above. Standoff with the police -- guy gets shot in the chest, runs back into his burning house inhaling smoke as he goes. The roof collapses the air conditioning unit falls on his head, he dies. What killed him?
Okay, Vicki Mercer and Carl Finn. I believe are in the bathroom.
Emily Behrle is in 3F. 
Preston Cash, 1A.
Right there, 3C. And for now, he's alive until he's dead.
The physical evidence that Sara, Nick, and I collected is contradicting the anecdotal statements that you, Catherine, and Warrick got and my money's on the physical evidence.
I mean, if this was an arson case, we'd burn down an empty house to prove our theory, right? Well, in this case we're going to recreate the flight from... 1630 hours on. You are in 4B.
Catherine-- the doctor, 3E.
Max and Marlene, 2E and F. You two are married. Who wants to wear the pants?
In the interest of clarity, yes. Nate in 2C.
Okay, look, it's going to be sunrise in ten minutes. We're going to have to do a run, lola, run and play this in literal time. Up until the point that Captain Murdle escorted the dead guy back to his seat the events are substantiated by the flight log and the eyewitness statements unless anybody knows something different.
1632 hours -- exactly 33 minutes before they landed in Vegas. One minute later, the plane hit turbulence.
Well, we know he's suffering from encephalitis. He's probably sweating and fighting back a migraine.
Yeah, but Candlewell is ticking off Nate in 2C even worse. I mean, this guy is perseverating. 
Uncontrollably kicking at the seat.
So, I get up, spin around ...
... confront the guy.
By this time, Candlewell's got to be out of his seat, right?
Candlewell's moving up and down the aisle by now.
There's a bottle of wine on the floor.
You slash at Candlewell ...
Now our guy's bleeding. He turns and heads for the cockpit.
Bang, bang. He wants in the cockpit ...
... but the door is locked. 
Captain Murdle gets on the horn calls first class twice. No answer. Why?
He can't get in the cockpit. What's next? 
He heads for the exit door. Blood underneath the latch handle shows that Candlewell tried to open it.
And, if he gets the door open, they all die.
The struggle ensued. Max and Lou slammed into Preston
... and, at some point, Candlewell goes down. Now it's a free-for-all.
Nate's knuckles were bruised ... so he was in on it.
That makes us all murderers.
I want five of those passengers arrested for murder.
We looked at the evidence, and the evidence says five.
On the surface, self-defense. They thought Candlewell was bringing the plane down.
But he didn't. They stopped him, and then they killed him -- not as individuals, but as a mob.
Not yet. I need more time.
Don't do that.
You don't know that, Brian.
That's what a jury would say. That's not what the evidence says.
It's about human nature -- how people react when their lives are threatened.
I can't answer that question.
It's not about that. You all have different opinions but you've taken the same point of view. You've put yourself in the shoes of the passengers, but nobody's put themselves in the shoes of the victim. That's the point.
Nobody stopped to ask Candlewell if he was all right. They just assumed, because he was kicking the back of Nate's seat, that he was a jerk -- because he was pushing his call button that he was bothering the Flight Attendant -- because he was trying to get into the lavatory he was making a scene -- because he was going back and forth up and down the aisles, he was posing a threat.
No. He turned into a threat. It didn't have to be that way. People make assumptions. That's the problem. You just did. And I think these passengers made the wrong assumption and now this guy's dead.
If just one person had stopped and taken the time to look at the guy to listen to him, to figure out what was wrong with him it might not have happened. It took five people to kill him. It would have only taken one person to save his life.
There you go, detective.
Good morning, Catherine.
He was Steve Wynn before Steve Wynn.
All seems very neat and peaceful, doesn't it?
With a Xanax back. 100 pills. Prescription filled yesterday.
If only life were that simple.
Looks like somebody did.
He's got adhesive residue on his wrists.
Well, that would be the obvious.
Welcome ... or unwelcome?
Did somebody clean him up?
Curious, isn't it?
Initially?
When I saw the TV on.
Any luck?
What about the cans outside?
Hey, Doc.
These abrasions around his mouth? What? Hard to shave when you're stoned?
Petechial hemorrhaging? Also suggestive of suffocation.
These three, circular, red marks on his chest? They're not bug bites.
CPR wasn't performed.
It's hard to OD just inhaling heroin. I know he was restrained which leads me to believe that someone forced him to ingest lethal amounts of heroin and Xanax.
Here's where it gets interesting. I took six prints off this bottle.
They all belong to one person.
It's good if you're us ...
Bad if you're Janine Haywood.
Not tonight, no. Why?
Where did you get it? 
Did you try this coffee?
The last cup I had tasted like motor oil.
Your pot?
Good. You're using my water so I guess that makes it community coffee. 
You want a cup, Nick?
What's the matter with your leg?
This is pretty good.
Let me see the bite before you get gangrene. Chigger bite.
Probably picked it up walking through the ferns in Braun's backyard. See if Catherine's got some clear nail polish. It'll seal it off from the air, keep it from itching.
Ah -- Whatever happened with that doggy door?
Be sure to check it against Janine Haywood's prints.
Xanax?
Where are all the undissolved pills?
Most OD's die before digestion's complete, right?
Okay, so what do we know that we can write home about?
Wouldn't have taken much to bind his hands with duct tape.
How many?
It's been 24 minutes, Greg. When's this thing going to be done?
Is this going to be a short story or a novel?
What's the 6-MAM count?
So Braun should still be walking around.
... and the point of your New York story was ... ?
Braun didn't die of a drug overdose accidental or otherwise.
Robbins opened him up. His lungs were compressed. Remember Burke and Hare the two 19th century Scottish body snatchers who made a living intoxicating innocent victims and suffocating them? Sold their cadavers to teaching hospitals? Got away with it, too, until a medical student discovered his fiancée on a slab.
Janine Haywood said that she left the house when the drug dealer arrived. I think she came back.
Would have been easy to tape his wrists mash up fifty pills ... 
... and force-feed him a Xanax cocktail.
So everything was going great until the gardener showed up. Then I think her plan turned to panic. It takes time to OD -- time Janine didn't have.
Burke would kneel on his victim's chest, right, covering their mouth and nostrils.
Hello.
Where?
Brass, you're breaking up.
Said he was in Blue Diamond, digging something up.
'A sable cloud turns forth its silver lining to the night.'
And a lot of silver.
Mr. Ritten ... it appears that we may have physical evidence connecting you to the murder of Tony Braun.
Did you ever leave anything there? Did you ever bring anything over to his house?
Who is he?
He's family. Why's he using the doggie door and not the front door?
Or on the doggie door ... but the brother's are.
So, call the print lab.
Nothing probative.
Look, forget Curt. Forget Janine. Forget the suspects. It's simple. We got to figure out how a piece of duct tape from a roll we found in Curt Ritten's truck ended up wrapped around the wrists of our victim.
It's a quirk. I always like to discuss fingerprints in person.
How long ago?
Be more specific.
You can't replace your brother.
What's the matter with your leg?
Mind if I take a look?
I'm an entomologist, actually. I-I know all about bugs.
Chigger bites. You might want to try some nail polish, keep it from itching. Would you mind if I took a photograph for my bite collection?
We're almost done.
In the, uh, last 48 hours have you been anywhere else besides those two places?
It might just get a little more routine.
Nick, I need your leg. Show me your bite.
Hey.
What time did you log in at the Braun house?
How long after that did you start processing the backyard?
You're not the only one with chigger bites.
Walt Braun. It's now 9:30 at night. Approximately 36 hours ago, you were bitten. Three hours earlier than that Tony Braun was murdered. Chiggers run a predictable course. 
A chigger attaches itself to a hair follicle injects a digest enzyme into the skin which ruptures the surrounding cells allowing the chigger to suck em up leaving behind a red, itchy bump.
Walt Braun lied. We now have an entomological timeline that places him at the house on the day his brother was murdered.
What evidence do we have that's still open?
We have to deal with that earring.
Ms. Haywood ... you have pierced ears.
How about your girlfriends or Tony's girlfriends -- any of them wear studs?
How often does she vacuum?
Hmm. The day Tony died.
Well, if the maid is as good as Janine says she is ... then ...
Whoever's prints are on the duct tape is missing an earring back. Who's the only other woman in the story?
She's here now.
We saw the fight in the police department.
It's funny, just recently I had a little education in earrings and I noticed that you have pierced ears.
It's okay, Jim, we have enough.
We compared it to a set of unknown prints that we found on some duct tape at the crime scene.
You know, sometimes, doing the job that we do our biggest break comes from the most innocent circumstance. It was the maid's day off, but not the Gardener's.
So you had to wing it. The gardener came to the window ...
... but he didn't see you ... so you removed the tape from Tony's wrists ... and made it look like an OD.
And an opportunity presented itself. Tony had erased you from the will and Bonnie wanted the people that hurt her to pay.
It's mine now. 
Surveillance?
Banana skids and fresh blood -- that helps. Oil slick doesn't hurt us either.
Striking resemblance to Judas.
Both men lost their lives over a worthless bag of chips.
Hey, Sanders, no punk rock.
Are you nuts?
Whoa. Careful. Livestock.
Hissing roaches from Madagascar.
These babies run two and a half miles an hour.
Fifth annual entomological convention in Duluth. Cockroach racing finals.
Actually, I'm giving a tutorial in preserving mass crime scenes. The sideshow is racing these guys.
I mean, to have a chance to run against legendary roaches like Cocky Balboa; The Drain Lover; Priscilla, Queen of the Gutters. It's huge.
Dog food.
You are.
That's tonight?
Man, these guys are primed.
If it was about seniority, I'd ask Nick. If I needed someone to stay up for three straight days I'd ask Sara. Instead, I want you.
Your curiosity would be better served on the case.
The shooting death of a con man at the Tropicana. Our guys are already there.
No.
The seminar was fine. Every one of my roaches got stage fright. They came in fourth, third, second and dead last. How about you? How'd you do?
'I love mankind, it's people I can't stand.'
Linus.
You think I like dealing with people? Remember when you asked me what I was in high school? 
When I leave CSI, there won't be any cake in the break room. I'll just be gone. So I wanted to see if you could step in. 
Tell me ... all of it, from the top.
Couldn't have been that bad.
Where's the man?
Well, this is as phony as a chappaquiddick neck brace. See how the clothes are all bunched.
It's impossible to redress an unconscious person to make it look like they dressed themselves. You notice anything about the suit coat?
Very good, Jim.  Why do they think they can fool us?
Call me if you learn anything.
Let's go up.
Mr. Fairmont was staying in Murder Central.
Sara, you're with me in here.  You guys get the elevator.
Smell the musk? Hint of bleach? 
Sexual intercourse.
Well, he's either careless or arrogant, maybe.
Yeah, you want to dust the champagne bottle?
Yeah, but they're not all biological. Some are soda stains, food stains, whiskey stains, you know.
You sound like you're making a commercial. Nick, hit the lights, will you?
Okay, we're looking for the freshest stains.
Hmm ... 'starlight, star bright, first star I see tonight.' 
Okay, I'll let you guys do the collection.
Oh, and Sara? 
Last hotel room nearest the stairwell -- easy entry and egress for an intruder and if the victim fights back, fifty percent less chance of being heard.
You tell her about the 911 tape?
Any ear-witnesses?
That's about as good as an eyewitness.
Grissom.  I'll be right there. 
No lunch.
We got a time?
From?
Aneurysm from trauma ... infection...?
Brain dead at 38, otherwise healthy and strong. Is this a Frankenstein?
How many organs they take?
Man, those harvest doctors move, don't they?
All right, I'll notify the PD about the organs.
You got a closer view?
Uh ...
Could be livor mortis.
We can't count on a photo to draw that kind of conclusion. We need the body.
I thought I'd raised a flag with the good doctor when I told him I was going to notify the police department but evidently, I mis-communicated again.
Well, if they haven't embalmed him we can still get a blood sample test for heavy metal poisoning.
You found it, you run with it. 
You can do it. Take Nick.
Useless-- heart has no memory for poison.
You want to clue me in?
On the case, 'Greggo'.
Secretary moved the body.
The secretary has dandruff.
Pical eczemas like that require prescription medication. The primary ingredient of those medications -- selenium sulfide.
You asked for it.
He has free will.
Must've grabbed the bottle ...
... upside-down to pour.
So ... who was he with?
Yeah ... but what never lies?
At least partially. Heavy metal, after all.
Actually, that's how the phrase got started. People used to dig up the bodies to extract the gold.
What's the most important component in a poisoning.
Patience.
Hydropazeen? That's an antiemetic used to counteract heavy metal poisoning.
So, this is Claudia.
She donated his organs and cremated his body.
An organ with a memory, maybe?
I just came from the D.A. Their attorneys were there as well. Based on everything we have the D.A. Is not going to move forward. He says it's a reject.
Brass is still in the field.
You're free to go.
That's what the D.A. said verbatim.
It's not always up to us.
Sara ... look ... 
I know this isn't news to you but sometimes science isn't enough.
It isn't a competition. We don't win.  The courts are like dice. They have no memory. What works one week doesn't work the next.
But, see, if you get mad, then they do win.
... But, hey ... the good news? There's no statute of limitation on murder.
A girl in a culvert pipe ... at a highway construction site in the middle of an alfalfa field. 
You got anything to add?
Who found the body?
Well, there goes that theory.
Whoever finds the body is the first suspect.
What do you got?
A second body ...
Which one died first?
My Uncle Phil used to say you can't kill two birds with one stone.
Somebody snapped her neck.
Fingernails maybe. Possible sign of struggle.
Cause of death?
Something doesn't seem right. 
Brunette ... 
Elaborate tattoos ... perfectly dyed hair. 
Multiple body piercing. Tells me she craved attention.
Blonde ... seems almost prosaic. She doesn't even have pierced ears. 
She didn't shave her legs.
So, besides time of death, what do our dead flowers have in common?
What about the culverts?
Print lab ID'd one of the vics.
Brunette. Joan Marks. At 18, she was booked for felony shoplifting. Lived at home, we got the address. Warrick grabbed a uniform. He's on his way there with a warrant.
Registered to a Donna Marks.
: Well ... we know what they have in common now, don't we?
Makes sense. The blonde's lacerations were filled with glass.
From inside out.
How are you at solving puzzles?
I have a hint for you. When they cool sheet glass, they lay it out on tin.
And establish a timeline.
It smells fresh.
More sweet and sour.
Mostly sour.
What do you think? Increase in appetite, or ... perhaps a guest?
Universal remote. She could do everything she wanted from this chair but cook a roast.
Catalogues, the internet, mail order, takeout ... 1,200 miles on her car. Agoraphobic maybe? Or she just doesn't like people?
I'm here about foreign DNA on Donna Marks' neck.
You found a match in CODIS?
You're saying that Donna's sister scratched her?
No, Greg, you didn't. But you've helped.
If she shopped online why'd she place orders over the phone?
Without physical contact?
Personal e-mails?
Pull up his most recent.
So, what do we know about this 'Apollo'?
Yeah.
An address?
That's strange.
Her greek god is in the slam.
The key to any successful business, huh? Word of mouth.
I imagine. It's like a theme park.
So, as long as I'm in business, you're in business. 
Are your inmates allowed to use e-mail anywhere else but here?
Something tells me state funds aren't your only source of revenue.
So, let me get this straight. I receive a catalog in the mail. I call a toll-free number to place an order and I'm giving my personal credit card information to a 'Hello, I'm doing 'time-life'' operator?
All right, let's cut to the chase. I'm investigating the deaths of two young women one of whom was having a 'relationship' with an inmate at this facility. I need to speak to that inmate. His e-mail alias is 'Apollo.'
I can get a warrant.
Why?
Hey.
I processed the prints.
They're not a match to Joan's boyfriend.
But ... we do have a match.
Released last week. His parole officer brought him in.
We found your fingerprints on the toilet seat in her bathroom.
Well, unfortunately I can't arrest you for lying.
Six months ago, Donna Marks ordered a sweater and two scarves from Magnolia Apparel. You took the order.
How many of your callers invited you home and served you Chinese food?
When Donna placed her order for the clothes she gave you her email address, didn't she?
You know, Mickey. I don't think your intention was to kill. All of your priors are for non-violent activities, right?
Well, we know we have two liars. Do we have a killer?
So what does that tell us?
She had multiple incised wounds. But the only contusion was on her forehead suggesting that that's where contact was made. So she was standing upright when she went through the door. 
She walked through it.
It's your science.
Hook up with auto detail, tow it in.
Well, that might explain why Joan bought coolant twice in the last week from a convenience store. We ran her credit cards.
Either someone unfamiliar with the car, or ... someone in a desperate situation maybe.
Good.  Grab me a sample of fluid, too, will you?
Yes.
What is it, Greg?
How about that? Economical and practical.
What do you use in your fertilizer? Nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium?
Mr. Willoughby, would you mind if I fingerprint your spigot?
Thirsty?
Yeah, I wouldn't drink it either. I wouldn't even put it in my radiator. I don't have all the pieces yet, Mickey, but, uh ... I'll tell you what we do have.
We know that Joan scratched Donna. We also know that Donna died first.
That's right, you didn't.
Donna's death was an accident.
... He's got to go all the way.
A guy like me.
Where is he?
Thank you.
The rain?
In descending order -- first victim was August 17, 1959; second victim, August 17, 1958; this guy, 1957.
I have a pretty good idea what it's going to say.
August 17, 1956.
Paul Millander. Remember the first victim? Royce Harmon?
Stuart Rampler, second ... 
... and now ... Pete Walker.
Coincidence. Make anything more of it gives Millander more power than he deserves.
Yes, he can. 
Thanks.
Cath ... Come here, take a look at this.
It's not lividity.
From what I can tell, he was shot once in the chest. Unburned gunpowder wouldn't plume this way.
I'll have Robbins check for leaks. Maybe he can find a hidden bullet.
So another victim ... or an accomplice?
The others didn't have stippling on the side of their faces. Unburned gunpowder doesn't change direction and stick. 
Unless ... he turned his face away from the gun.
Nobody misses from this distance.
I think this might be intentional.
He's telling me he's going to show me both sides.
Could be Millander's.
Yeah, but what decade?
Look under 400-X. The tag cell is aged.
Not if he nurtured it. Kept it in a freezer.
Maybe just one.
I don't know yet.
Yeah. None of it matters. It's one of those few cases where physical evidence isn't helping us much. I mean, put it in context. The victim's birthday is always on the anniversary of the murder of Millander's father. Staged like his father's death. A planted hair, a planted fingerprint ... it's all biographical. He's using the evidence to tell us a story.
Run the other two vics. Royce Harmon.
So what's the commonality?
Excuse me. Officer Yarnell?
My name's Gil Grissom, with the Las Vegas Crime Lab. May I ask you how many speeding tickets you issue a day?
You wrote tickets to three people who ended up dead.
Court.
Excuse me, Officer. I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab. I need you to arrest a murder suspect.
Judge Mason. His real name is Paul Millander.
Officer, this man is not who he's pretending to be.
He's wanted in Clark County for murder.
You know where I'm from ... and I know who you are.
Identical.
That every person is supposed to have an exact double somewhere in the world?
Never been proved.
Well, you know, we could always do a DNA test.
A doppelganger, evidently. Do you have your mentholatum?
No. The judge just got sloppy.  Thanks.
Go ahead and take the Tahoe. Call me later. I'm going to dinner.
I was admiring these rain boots.
You have a lovely home.
May I ask how long you've lived here?
Nice to meet you, Craig.
No, we can't.
Excuse me. I'm sorry.  Grissom.
Okay. Thank you.
Uh, I have to get back to my lab right away. I'm sorry. Thank you for a lovely dinner, Mrs. Mason. 
Craig ... your honor.
I don't care what the computer says, that guy is Paul Millander.
We have to disprove this Judge Mason. Birth certificate -- was he born in Mulberry?
Burned down?
So Judge Mason has no birth certificate. How convenient. Man, this guy plays way out in front.
In the name of Paul and Isabelle Millander.
We're with the Las Vegas crime lab.
Your son?
Halloweird.
Would you happen to have any of his work still?
Might I take a look at it?
Hmm, it's rudimentary. Almost childlike.
It's an ashtray?
May I?
I wonder what this green discoloration is.
I could take this back to the lab and analyze it. I promise to bring it back.
When did she die?
What about your son Paul?
It's plausible. It's not provable ... yet.
These were his father's prints. He was planting them as if they were his own.
Greg, if I refer to Millander as smart, it's one thing but I mind if other people do it, okay?
What have you got on the hair Catherine recovered?
Find me.
Did I miss something?
Clear ... concise ... anonymous.
Here come de Judge.
... Paul Millander.
It's ... it's Greg.
Come on.
You didn't beep me for that.
Why?
Paul killed Pauline. But he didn't murder her.
So that's what you've been hiding? That your daughter is now your son?
Mrs. Millander, we believe that your son has murdered three people and that he's living under the assumed name of Judge Douglas Mason. I need your permission to collect some hairs from Pauline's bedroom for use in court.
We took this hair from your childhood bedroom when you used to be Pauline.
So, uh ... you were a girl when you were inside the house and a boy when you were out in the world?
You did what you could do. You testified against them.
And you started to identify with the aggressors. 
Why are you smiling?
Sexual reassignment. Not just a man, though-- a Judge. Doesn't get much more powerful than that 
But none of it solved your problems, did it? Or else you wouldn't have killed three innocent men.
I have a warrant for your DNA.
See you in court.
No.
No.
It doesn't matter, Paul -- you'll be in jail.
What is going on? I thought Millander was supposed to be arraigned at
He had my I.D.
Yeah. They know where to find me.
He never slips up.
Mrs. Millander?
Well, he had a million dollars in his checking account.
He's a real estate developer. On the mayor's committee to revitalize downtown.
Nope. That's why we're here.
You don't have to say anything.
Vegas.
No blood on his clothes.
Sorry for the inconvenience.
His hands were covered in blood and he had a million dollars in his briefcase.
Yeah. Henry VI. Where is he when we need him?
What happen to the man in the moon?
What'd you find?
The blood on his hand was female.
What about the car?
Yeah. We don't have a crime yet.
Where is it?
It was the right index finger?
Any hemorrhagic tissue?
How did Catherine seem?
And her behavior toward Logan? Was she under duress? Agitated?
A severed finger, a million bucks. And Catherine's not allowed to talk to anyone.
It's time to speak to his wife.
To the blood on Logan's hands.
He's a real estate developer. Does he own any other properties?
But occupied?
Grab Sara. We're gone.
Helium canister.
The Lexus stopped there. 
Catherine walked up to here.
Could be the kidnapper's.
Thank god. 
I know -- Amanda Freeman. She's dead ... and whoever touched the money probably has glow-in-the-dark paint on their hands.
Yeah, nicely done. I know just about everything except ... where are you?
So, you couldn't see what he looked like?
Blowfly eggs?
Unhatched ova. They're waterlogged.
What is it?
It wouldn't have made any difference. She was killed long before you could have helped her.
Mrs. Logan, maybe. They would have had a lot to talk about.
Then, uh, what did you talk about for three minutes and fifty-five seconds?
I think you went to your husband's townhouse -- a townhouse you probably didn't know he had - and a civilized drink turned into a violent brawl.
Cut off her finger, stuck it in a mint tin and left it for your husband.
Whoa!
So, Roy Logan set this whole thing up?
During this elaborate farce you never thought to ask him why he was making you jump through these hoops?
The Tangiers.
I'll follow the money.
Okay, let's run this. Amanda was tired of being number two, so she calls up Mrs. Logan to discuss her affair with her husband. 
But Mrs. Logan doesn't just discuss it she throws down the gauntlet.
Most killers take their time planning a murder. He took his time covering it up. 
Forty-eight hours to be precise. 
So Logan cleans up the crime scene and calls his lawyer. Asks him to help him with his little charade. I mean, what better way to protect your assets than to pay a kidnapper who's already on retainer?
Out of one pocket into the other. 
I especially liked the little show he did for us in the coroner's lab. Trying to find out how much we knew.
Because without the body, Logan would always be under suspicion.
I saw the locker 
... and I saw Logan's briefcase. It was too big to fit inside. His lawyer had to remove the cash by hand.
You sure?
A Body Farm is not creepy. It's a controlled study of situational decomposition. All in all, a very healthy place.
It's a carpet beetle. It shouldn't be here.
Carpet beetles are the last to arrive at a corpse -- when it's almost a skeleton. I mean, this guy's still fresh.
David! Get this body out of here now! We got cross contamination!
Talk to me about what?
Well, the lab fridge was full. I put in last night. 
I'm going to test for horizontal motion on bloodstains. Vis-a-vis surface textures. 
Hey, any of you guys got any linoleum at home?
I know. That's why the Red Cross gives it to us 'cause it's past its expiration date.
Anything new on the body farm victim?
Okay.
I'll be in autopsy. Let me know.
A bullet.
So, how do you explain that?
So, let's excise it. Do a more localized search.
What's your best tool for excising the tissue of our Mr. Doe?
Good.
We're excising a wound tract.
It is.
From the ribs?
Bovine.
Genus hypaderma. These are normally found in the intestinal tract of cows. These maggots aren't found in humans. 
The body farm also studies animals, not just humans.
Only one way to find out.
Accelerant.
I was. 
Sometimes, it's about where the fire isn't.
Did the fly find the beef in the wound and lay its eggs or did it bring the beef with him?
None of these beef particles are as big as the tissue found in Mike Kimble's wound tract. And I found out the ex-husband is the proud owner of a registered handgun.
It means I need to see that gun.
About?
I'm working it.
Yes. You're right, you are. So, take some photos of the experiment for the D.A. And then ... uh ... get rid of that stuff.
Yeah.
I don't know.
Thirty.
Okay. Have Nick do it.
Thanks for coming in.  Is this your gun?
May I take a look at it? 
It's been cleaned.
May I ask what kind of ammunition you use?
It's melting.
I'm putting it in the freezer.
Well, have Brass get a warrant for the mother's house. Check the evidence we recovered from the dead boyfriend's house. They stayed in both places.
One thing at a time.
I can't. Take Nick.
'Match not found.'
You getting anywhere with the print?
They say the eyes are the window to the soul.
In a way, it's true. The aqueous fluid and the vitreous in the human eye allows for an image to be reflected in it.
I think my popsicles are ready.
What are you doing here? Isn't this your day off? 
Yeah, I had to freeze it with a touch of liquid nitrogen.
The meat from the projectile was visually indistinguishable from the victim's stomach tissue. We know that your gun was clean but it turns out that your re-loader wasn't.
The material that was on your re-loader is consistent with the material we found in the victim's wound tract. Ground beef.
He gave her a camera?
He can confess to the homicide but we're still examining evidence on the arson.
The harm would be to the justice system unless I misunderstand our place in it.
What I think and what the evidence proves are possibly two different things.
What is this?
Why?
We have the best lab in the country.
What does that mean?
Everybody here respects you.
Is this about that hamburger thing?
Hey, Sara? 
The Lab needs you here.
Did you hear the dad copped a plea on the murder and the D.A. expedited it?
Accelerant. Identical to the type found at the arson. Police got it out of Jody's gym locker.
So who started the fire?
Except when she's on his boat, right?
This is your sleeping bag we took off your boat. Our lab turned it inside-out. The discoloration you see is a mixture of vaginal and seminal fluid ... your daughter's and yours.
No, he can't. In the State of Nevada, we're all bound by a legal statute. The sexual assault of a minor age 14 and under is a mandatory life sentence with no possibility for parole.
Tough case, huh?
Well, you wouldn't be human if it didn't affect you.
Sara, you know, she gets very emotional ... 
Good. Let's move on.
Yeah.
Yeah, hi. I-I-I'd like to get some flowers for a girl. No, no. Not flowers. A plant. A living plant. She likes vegetation.
Yeah, that'd be fine. To a Sara Sidle. Deliver it at the CSI division, Las Vegas Police Department the one out on North Trop Boulevard. Yeah, you can bill me at the same place. Gil Grissom.  The sentiment? Oh-oh, on the card. Yeah. Um, uh ... have it say ... have it say, uh ... 'From Grissom.'
Thank you.
Where's the body?
This looks fresh.
Yeah, it's murder.
Two minutes for elbowing. Four minutes for high sticking. Ten minutes, unsportsman-like conduct.
Yeah, sounds like these boys went to a fight and a hockey game broke out.
That's not true-- I've been a baseball fan my whole life.
It's a beautiful game.
Since I met you.
So, we'll start at the opposite goal work our way across the blue line to center ice.
'There are three things in life that people like to stare at. A rippling stream, a fire in a fireplace and a zamboni going round and round.'
We all do.
The thing I love about zambonis is they pick up everything. Hey.
I'm afraid the other part of this tooth might be in there.
Time to combine Foyeer's Law of Conduction with Newton's Law of Cooling.
The heaters max out at 90 degrees, but the variables are constantly changing.
I don't know, 50-cubic-foot melt per hour, if we're lucky?
I was watching ice melt.
Well, organized sports is the paradigmatic model of a just society. Everyone knows the same language everyone knows the rules. And there's a specific punishment handed out the moment someone tries to cheat. Instant morality.
Stockbroker.
Aren't we all?
No? How'd you get to be Chief Medical Examiner? Look, we're all carrying prehistoric genes in a postmodern world. We get our meat from the grocery store instead of with a club or a knife. We have to work off our, uh, testosterone somehow.
Yeah. So, cause of death?
Loss of consciousness.
So did his death cause his fall or did his fall cause his death?
I don't know about that.
So, what's the ratio here?
Well, we still don't know how or why he died.
Well, speaking on a meta-level ... isn't it obvious? The overbearing patriarchal structure of modern organised sports represents a socially palatable sublimation of what Jung refers to as the 'Shadow of the Unconscious.'
We opened up terry's hard drive. It turns out he had your entire roster knee-deep in the stock market.
Ms. Gallagher, your skate had a certain blood spatter on it. It indicates that you're the one that nicked Terry River's carotid artery.
Including your skate intentionally coming down on his neck.
It's evidence. Food poisoning especially anything with spoiled mayonnaise can induce vomiting within 15 minutes. She said last night -- that was 12 hours ago.
And you know this how?
Maybe she didn't know she was pregnant. If she had, would she have gone out on the ice?
Well, if it was Terry Rivers he was definitely deadbeat dad material. Which speaks to motive.
Except you can't safely test for paternity before the baby's born.
Yeah. Say goodbye to Greg.
Well, Jane may play hockey, but her sheets are distinctly female.
What is Victoria's Secret, I wonder?
Sheets may be female, but this toenail belonged to a man.
What about the girl? Is she a temp, too?
You know, I got a list. It's got a negative figure of 12,000 after your name.
Did you ever hear the story of the 19th century chinese goldsmith? He lost a lot of money for his goldsmith buddies due to his shoddy business practices so they decided to kill him by biting him to death. 123 goldsmiths took a bite out of the victim insuring that no one individual could be blamed for the murder. For who would know which one administered the lethal bite.
Well, there's truth in this: Your friend Jane is pregnant.
What kind of coronary anomaly?
I never heard of it.
So, the game had nothing to do with it? It was the heart?
Someone still gets an assist.
... 'Doing it'.
Worried that the father of your child might find out?
Well, according to Doc Robbins he never had malaria.
So Jane Gallagher is officially no longer a suspect.
So who did know?
Which they wouldn't have done if they had known about his heart. They would have played tentatively. Which in hockey is a sacrilege.
How many patients do you have with malaria?
Well ... a man is dead.
Is this Umbria or Tuscany?
But Jane's had a couple of boyfriends since that trip, right? 
Terry was an injury waiting to happen, wasn't he? And when it did, you were there on the bench with two little pills in your hand. 
But Tommy Sconzo is the father.
You killed the wrong guy.
'Wherever you live is your temple, if you treat it like one.'
Buddha.
'Guy in the robe' is a monk, Nick.
Okay. Let's hug the walls.
Gunshot to the head. Times four.
This wasn't a robbery. This was a hit.
Five years ago, West Vegas ... German tourist took a wrong turn, ended up dead. This 'placa' was sprayed across the windshield of their rental car. It's the Snakebacks.
They were praying.
For whoever was shooting them.
May I ask a question? This is a high-crime area. Have you had any problems here before? Like break-ins or burglaries?
True. But sometimes, it leaves its fingerprints on the future.
Well, I do know that the seven chakras correspond to the body's seven energy centers.
Let's go back to the third eye.
If someone were threatened by that consciousness, that would be a logical target, yeah?
Well, we've got ourselves a murder weapon.
And?
One survivor, one suspect. 
Do your teachings allow you to keep pornography?
Got to be a lot easier to be a monk in a monastery on a mountaintop than one on Las Vegas Boulevard.
D.A. Says it's enough for a warrant. Ananda's already in custody.
What about the prints?
He never fired it.
Well, Nevada doesn't require rifle registration. What's my next question?
Bangers tag homicides all the time.
So we're looking at a Warhol.
Well, it's not a real soup can. It's a painting of a soup can.
Except, if you want to be in a gang, you can be.
David, stop calling me 'sir.' What's up with the Air Force?
I'm enlisting.
And the surrounding areas as well, right? This temple is less than two miles from your base. What's the chances your satellite's picked something up?
Cool.
Hey. Glad to see you're not in uniform. Only one vehicle passed through the temple gates around the time of the murders. Parked next to the monk's car.
Registered to a Peter Hutchins.
All photographs were intermittent. None included the driver.
Yep. Would you like to, uh, process the truck?
Thank you.
I heard that, uh, some of the local business owners weren't very happy with the members of the temple.
Your name is ... ?
Uh, which one of you two guys drives the truck outside?
Well, these wouldn't be your prayer beads, would they?
She has a warrant.
Probably not looking for salvation.
Lot of activity in this neighborhood. You're going the wrong way on a one-way. Fender bender on the corner. Some guy running down the middle of the street ...
What about the truck?
Left the truck in the driveway. Junior?
You may be right. Paintball paint.
Well, we know that your father's truck was at the temple at the time of the murders. And our lab identified boot prints and paint residue near the altar.
Water soluble, with flecks of plastic coating like the kind on your clothes. Toss them in the wash, paint's gone.
Well ... see ... 
This boot print says you were.
No. You see, our dust lifter is only effective on very recent prints. I think you were there the day of the murders.
How'd you know to remove your boots? You'd been there before?
I can't give you what I don't have, Greg. All we're going to have is what we get from this gum.
Thank you.
If you see the Buddha on the side of the road, kill him.
Climb in, I'll give you a lift. 
We've cleared the father. The son has also been cleared.
There was a gang placa that was scrawled into the walls of your temple. It was put there to mislead us. The weapon you found on your desk was also put there to mislead us. The only other unexplained evidence we have is the chewing gum. We found traces of curry and saffron.
Sometimes the best evidence we get comes from what people do when they're not thinking. Old habits, routines. I don't think the gum was put there to mislead us. I think it was just a mistake.
It's the real stuff.
And the five of you ate together that night? Any guests?
We're in a temple, O'Riley.
According to the bank, you opened the school fund account on the same day as the murders. Where did you have the money before that?
Curry powder. Your temple employs a part-time cook.
After you caught him with his hand in the till? 
Why didn't you tell us about Mr. Suddahara before?
Yep, his DNA matches the gum sample.
You thought Ananda was going to report you to the police for stealing the money.
And he'd gone to the bank to protect the rest of the money but you didn't know that.
I'm curious about one thing, though. Why did you shoot them all in their sixth chakra?
They do their job and then we do ours.
All right, I want everybody thinking worst case scenario. The highway's finally ours. Cones and pictures, skid marks, ice patches, loose asphalt, anything and everything.
Every Las Vegas CSI is on their way here.
Call them.
Crims with 'field training'.
He does no collection.
Yeah, I heard, but I think I know why the bus pulled to the right.
Newton's third law: 'For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction.'
Tire to rim. Rim to axle. Axle to suspension. Suspension to frame. And the lower radius rod arm ... which connects the axle to the frame.
So, if the rod arm broke while he was driving ...
But turning the wheel was probably going to make things worse.
And we're back to Newton. The Theory's correct if the rod arm was the first action.
Well, we're missing a passenger. The only one unaccounted for is an ex-con named Calvin McBride. According to Brass, he wasn't admitted to the hospital and he's not in any of the body bags.
CHP and the Barstow P.D. are looking.
Firefighters only look in the obvious spots.
For bodies? 
Walls, hot water heaters stuffed in the box spring of a hotel room bed.  I found a head in a bucket of paint once.
What do you see?
Greg, bag this, take it to the lab, swab the rim for DNA. 
You should be wearing gloves.
This guy was in 1C.
Where's the other half of this windshield?
I'm afraid our ex-con just got the death penalty.
I need the two front wheels, axle, suspension, all of it. The whole front undercarriage.
Excuse me, miss. This is a crime scene. It's off limits.
Why are you here?
Good, Greg. Did you enjoy being in the field?
What?
No.
Symptoms of which can mirror intoxication.
Loss of consciousness and seizure. Do I pass?
Cause of death?
We're looking at the bus.
Does this look like it's in perfect working order?
What'd you get?
Snapped in half?
Did you do a Rockwell hardness test?
Often when there's one ... there's another one.
Inferior bolts would cause the suspension to give the bus veers off the road. If the sheared bolts were the first action.
Proof?
Broken rod arm, maybe?
Why'd he hit the brakes?
So I ask again -- why'd he hit the brakes?
Well, fortunately, we're just looking for one.
Criminal acts, however, are another matter.
I believe this belongs to you.
The front suspension was riddled with these.
I think maybe it's time for another inspection.
I finally know the first action. What initiated the skid? The right front tire started to come apart. When it blew, it left an indentation in the pavement.
You and me both. The Treads from the right rear tire obscured it. 
So, the driver overcorrects but since there's no more tire, all that force is displaced on the suspension system. The bolt snaps, the rod arm breaks and the bus broadsides the camaro.
I don't know.
Newton's Third ... with a twist.
Yeah, the front right tire was compromised.
It wasn't vandalism. It was an act of premeditation.
Chloroform destroys the elasticity of the rubber. Sooner or later, the air pressure inside the tire causes it to explode.
Well, that's what we're going to find out. We need a treadmill -- a big one.
Exercise a bus. Warrick, tell Larry Maddox it's in his best interest to lend us one of his ... 
... and set it up in the empty police warehouse next door. Sara?
Yeah. Weird, huh? So, where are we?
Or maybe one of them was a target.
What was her skeleton?
And he has access to chloroform.
Still possible. Motive, access, opportunity.
So, who do you like?
Is this the twin?
Did you see that?
Okay. 'Drive,' he said. Just the speed limit.
No, if the tire was tampered with in Barstow it should blow any minute.
Well, I guess it's Barstow.
Well, I wish we had a 'who' but at least we have a 'where.'
Five buses have pulled in in the last ten minutes.
Grissom.
Did you check their maintenance records?
Way to go, Warrick. I owe you.
We got a suspect. Sean Nolan.
Yeah, there was a bus crash up the road. About nine people died.
Julius Caesar, murdered in 44 B.C. Legend has it that the molecules from his last breath spread all over the world. Probably like your fingerprints, right? They're everywhere.
Whoa. Is that a pickle in your pocket or are you just happy to see us?
Second-degree murder.
Yeah, which was mitigated by greed.
Posed?
What do you make of the smears?
Her hair's still wet. You think the assailant surprised her while she was dyeing her hair?
Neighbor lady -- doing the dishes with her window open. Heard the dog yelping, evidently. Called the cops.
So, has anyone seen this dog?
Prisoner in her own home?
A better question -- how'd he get out?
Aluminum foil.
Sorry, Nick. You've been staring at this girl for ten minutes. Do you know her?
Why don't you go do the bedroom? I'll get the coroner in here and finish up in the bathroom.
What'd you get?
Good. Fume it. Tell Sara and Warrick to grab a couple shovels and dig in, too.
Sorry. So, what -- suffocation?
No ligature marks on her neck.
Sexual assault?
So, what's his agenda?
I'll be on my cell.
No becke line.
Hair refracts light under cross polarization but glass doesn't.
Maybe.
You'll figure it out.
How does this relate to the case?
He's a psychic?
Mr. Pearson.
Sit down. Captain Brass tells me that ... uh ... you had some sort of 'vision' regarding Jane Galloway's murder.
What kind of vision?
Anything else?
Okay. Thank you.
This is your eyewitness?
Why didn't you tell us you were staying here?
May I ask what you two were talking about?
But evidently, you called her back.
The front desk records also show that she checked out that night. And you checked out shortly thereafter. Why?
Mr. Pearson, I'm a scientist.
These visions that you've had in the past ... nothing specific triggered them?
Fear?
And you were hoping to heal Jane Galloway?
So, these visions you told us about earlier? These are the only ones you've experienced?
Are these the three locks you saw?
What do you mean?
Is this what you saw?
... from above.
Pick a number between two and five and indicate it with your fingers.
Please humor me.
Four. Thank you.
Look up. Jane's bedroom closet has a door to the attic.
Warrick, Grissom. You know that blond fiber we were looking at?
Not really. I was checking a phone line. But good work.
He tapped into her second line. He's got a peep hole into every room. They're labeled.
Yeah. He's our psychic -- Mr. Pearson.
You know, I don't think this thing was about s*x at all. I think it was about control, voyeurism. Jane was like his, uh, little goldfish.
Night vision goggles.
Probably.
Well, this only opens from the inside. So at some point it's possible that Jane let him in.
Well, pretty much ... if you got a uniform on, you can walk right in the front door.
Thank you, doctor.
You helped out Nick. That was the right thing to do.
Yeah, I wonder why. Let's go back over there.
No, no. You need to calm down a little. Talk to Nick when he wakes up.
Nigel Crane, age 37. No criminal record. Working for Luna Cable for eleven years. No immediate family, lives alone. Last seen by co-workers two days ago. No priors.
He lives up there. Not down here. Works, sleeps changes his clothes ... everything in the attic. He looks down on the world separating himself from others. Fascinating, really.
Red dye.
Dinner and a movie?
How's Nick doing?
Not really, not yet.
Isn't our newsletter for in-house only?
Why would he do that? Why Nick?
Wait a minute we've been doing this the wrong way. We need to see the last tape.
Archie, play this.
Nick, listen, he's been in your house.
Nigel Crane, the Stalker. Brass is one his way with two uniforms to put at your door.
What?
Good, keep him there.
I don't think it was about you, Nick. Or Jane Galloway, for that matter. I think it was more about Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. His premise is that social beings strive to belong. In Nigel's mind, Jane Galloway was someone he could control which was okay for a while but you ... you were someone he could actually become. See, Maslow's Fifth Tier of the Hierarchy is Self-Actualization.
Yeah.
Dropped out of sight. 
Missing persons. First 24 hours are gold after that ... 
Excuse me, but could everyone in this room do me a big favor ... and leave?
Please?
If you're very still, you can stay.
Lamp's still on.
It's like going to the vet without your dog.
No sign of struggle. Everything's intact. 
Nothing out of place.
Door locks automatically and there were no keys in her purse.
If they were in her pocket she could've walked right back in. Why didn't she?
People don't vanish, Jim. It's a molecular impossibility.
They have this system in place when you went to school here?
If you don't live in the dorm you can't get in.
How about taking video? There's cameras on every floor; one of them must have seen something, please find it.
In this case, more is less-- the more time goes by the less chance we have of finding this girl. 
Minty.
Ah. Leave the room the way you found it, get back your full deposit.
Why would anyone want to sell their books?
Jennifer Riggs. Left school two weeks into the semester Brass checked with the registrar.
There's a void. Something was here.
I'm thinking.
When we get any new information, I'll let you know.
Just let me do my job.
Look. What no one's telling you is that the only tangible connection you have left between you and your daughter is the evidence that my team is collecting and how we interpret it. So, please ... let me think.
You showered.
Yeah? Well ... I can't tell what I'm observing here. What does that look like?
Sorry.
Paige Rycoff was missing a rug from her room.
Good. We know what he might've carried out.
It's your hand.
Do you know Paige Rycoff?
Guy like you, it had to be a blow to your ego. Maybe you tried to change her mind.
This is the worst place you can be on a missing persons ... a dead end.
You know, when a tree falls in the forest even if no one's there to hear it, it does, in fact, make a sound.
What have we got?
It's called protocol. Let's get on with it.
Not hers?
Rohypnol?
What about the semen?
Is this her parents' house?
We're looking for a connection. 
That's one of the side effects of rohypnol. I'm sure he was counting on that.
Officially, we're looking for the individual who abducted Paige Rycoff not the student who raped Jennifer Riggs.
That's what we're hoping for. De facto suspect.
Friederich Miescher requests my presence?
He's been dead a hundred years, Greg. What do you got?
Are we paying you by the word?
Thirteen markers. Thirteen matches. One suspect. Thank you.
Any record?
Yeah? I wonder how he hits.
Listen, Kevin, we know that you assaulted Jennifer Riggs.
Why don't you just tell us about Paige Rycoff.
Well, I'll tell you what I know. Jennifer Riggs was raped. We found semen on her mattress. We matched the seminal DNA to you.
We are.
Another dead end.
We're losing her.
A world of possibilities reduced to a single car?
Nick, tow it to CSI and process. Cath ... 
'Some circumstantial evidence is very strong as when you find a trout in the milk.'
My perception -- sign of struggle.
Okay, look, it's been six days. If you have a legitimate reason for being outside of her dorm, tell us. If you have an illegitimate reason tell us that. Tell us something, so that we can move forward.
Again, my perception -- silence confirms guilt.
If it was important enough for you to hide it's important enough for us to know.
We found some of Paige's hair in your car.
You mean, uh, will it stand up in court? Yes, it will.
Four strands of hair pulled out by the root, on the passenger's headrest.
Professor Woodbury, does your wife work?
Mrs. Woodbury, I think you're leaving something out. 
Excuse me.
Grissom.
So, is it her?
So you're saying she was killed by the compactor. Crushed to death.
And you know this how?
From what?
Type of weapon?
Well, you followed the lead, it went cold. Now it's hot again.
Okay. Photograph it, swab it. Let's get it back to the lab.
Nick's right - the vehicle paint chips metal flecks in the color coat.
No reason to think there's not.
Or 'her' crime.
She's still a viable suspect.
Look, let's stick to the 'how' -- we'll deal with the 'why' later.
The car that impacted the dumpster was originally white then painted red, and now it's black.
Every paint has a unique light absorption rate. We I.D. The paint, we get to the car.
Well, this narrows our scope. Call Brass.
I can't be everywhere, Warrick and they banned human cloning.
Then what happened?
Doesn't mean he didn't also hit a body.
H.L. Mencken once said, 'There's an easy solution to every human problem -- neat, plausible ... and wrong.' So if the solution to our problem is not neat, plausible and wrong; then it could be messy, unlikely and right. Right?
A butterfly flaps its wings in Brazil we get a hurricane of the coast of Florida. Chaos theory.
Random events; the wholesale rejection of linear thought. 
If we apply it to Paige Rycoff and our case at this particular moment in time then we can say, 'Life is unpredictable.' 
Paige was in her dorm room and then ended up in the dumpster. Somewhere between her dorm room and the dumpster is our answer. That's where we're going. Coming, Nick?
Look out the window. What do you see?
So what do you do next?
Stop. Suitcases never left the room. You didn't take them with.
Because you want your security deposit back.
So what's missing?
What's the last thing you do after you've done the cleaning?
Hi. Could I borrow your trash can? 
You're thinking too linear. Chaos Theory, remember? Just dump it.
Maybe you were quicker than Paige was.
Excuse me. Could you do me a favor? We're doing a little experiment. Could you count to a hundred and then drop this can all the way down the chute? Thanks.
Watch your fingers.
There was a busted spring in the chute.
The trash can was missing from Paige's room.
But just then, here comes Mark Doyle.
Yes.
Mrs. Rycoff there is no one guilty of this.
Because the evidence says so.
We told them what happened.
Truth brings closure.
Male cat urine ... to us, smelly. To a female cat, it must be like aftershave.
David.
Whoa.
Sure. Meat is meat.
Whoa. Look at this. Flowing wound. 
That's a deep wound track. This woman was stabbed. I guess the cats are off the hook.
Distinctive heel and toe. What, a high heel?
You got to be careful with isolation. It can escalate. Before you know it, you're the crazy cat lady living in the rundown house. People stop coming by to visit. You go outside, your neighbors run across the street to get away from you. Eventually, you stop going out altogether.
Well, there's no signs of forced entry anywhere.
Well, killer could have brought his own ... took it with him when he left.
You know, house cats have only been domesticated for 4,000 years. They still have predatory instincts.
Yeah.
Anything else?
Grissom.  We'll be right there. 
Homicide has a witness.
And, uh ... who is Mrs. Stein?
Okay. Thanks for your help.
Don't you have a secret to share with me now?
So, I guess it's safe to say you weren't friends? Why were you in her house?
When, exactly, did you confront Mrs. Elliot?
You know, according to Mark Twain the most striking difference 'between a cat and a lie is that a cat only has nine lives'.
Unless her alibi checks out.
Your mother died and you never claimed the body. How come?
And so ... that's it?
There's still time, Greg. Tell us about the foreign substance we found in the vic's wound track.
Possibly used as a preservative to prevent rusting of high-carbon steel.
I thought that was my line.
Mineral oil fluoresces at 525 nanometers when filtered through a kv590. A little more absorbing ... a little less rock and roll.
Following the evidence.
Excuse me, uh ... may I hold your cat?
Mrs. Trent, I noticed this cat has a sore on its leg. I'd be happy to swab it for you. Might need medical attention.
But I mean, for your daughter's sake, wouldn't you rather be safe than sorry?
One thing about my mother even though she was deaf, she was always the boss.
That cat has an open sore and a missing patch of fur -- both indicative of possible staph infection.
Staphylococcus bacteria can jump the species barrier -- be passed from human to animal.
Girl's cat ... positive for staphylococcus.
Could their cat have been infected by Mrs. Elliot? Could rascal have been her cat at one time?
No.
Maybe someone in the Trent house adopted it.
Did you know?
What's Hazmat doing here?
Viscous fluid the consistency of dishwashing soap. Hazmat guy was right. Killer doused the body in lye. 
Yeah, ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Without the wait.
What'd you get?
Looks like a paint fleck or metal chip, maybe.
Nobody saw anything suspicious. Park closes up at 10 p.m. No security, minimal lighting. Basically, a pretty good place to dump a body.
Actually, Hazmat found him.
Look at all the bruising. If he was struck and killed, ecchymosis would be nonexistent.
We didn't find any blood.
Good. We got a bus to catch.
Silver flecks ... like the one you found with the body.
No sign of blood. No evidence of a cleanup. 
So do want to tell me about the silver flecks I found? Paint chips?
Mm, what type of car 
Looks like some sort of insignia.
You've, uh, already shared this information with Sara?
Well, I'm somewhat fascinated by the fact that I'm your boss, but you talked to her first.
I've been in the lab all day, Greg.
Well, it's hard to see me if you and Greg are out ahead of me.
Why? Is your car missing?
Don't most of these luxury vehicles have security systems?
We're investigating a possible hit-and-run.
Ignacias High, Nevada State University ... are you a local?
Good for you. Let me guess -- criminal defense?
Yes, they do. Would you happen to remember what clothes you were wearing yesterday?
Aristotle said something about the whole being more than the sum of its parts. Of course, he never worked in a chop shop. We want all of the parts.
Well, that's just a trace amount. Where's the rest of it?
Well, you do know how to light up a room. Location of the blood on the seats and the dash indicates that the victim was inside the vehicle.
Okay. Where'd they go?
If you find any blood that isn't his then ... 
Look at this. Visible blood drops under the passenger seat.
Radiated spatter. What do you think?
Blood pooled onto the floormat. As more drops splashed down the impact projected the blood drops upward.
Yeah, what's left of it.
We were distracted by what we were looking for.
Maybe there is no thief.
We need a warrant for his house. We need to find something we can use to keep that creep off the street.
We'd like to start in your garage.
If you're a lawyer, you should know the legal definition of harassment. Investigating a crime doesn't quite fit the criteria. However, a false accusation of harassment within earshot of my colleagues could be construed as slander. I know the law, too and I've actually been in a courtroom.
This was parked in the driveway, wasn't it?
Jim, could you get this car moved for us?
It smells like bleach to me.
Why would he leave his car outside with the sprinklers on instead of putting it in here?
Yes.
Well, it belongs to the family of sarcophagids. That's as far as I got.
Your maggot never developed, Nick. It never will.
It happens to sarcophagids when they're exposed to freezing temperatures before they're allowed to pupate.
Probably by frozen air.
Well, maybe it was a very cold night. Mucho frio.
Well, actually, I sold it to him five years ago. It was in much better condition back then.
Dicing wounds with glass were limited to the upper torso, right?
Which would be consistent with a head-on crash.
Well, this isn't the same model or year but it's close enough.
So now he's bleeding and his blood is dripping onto the mat. 
Yeah, but he could have been conscious, right? Until he lost a third of his circulating blood volume?
So it's possible that he was wedged into the windshield of Ben Weston's Mercedes which was parked in Ben Weston's garage.
My guess? ... at work, making a good impression. 
You know. It's funny, but the registered owner of the Mercedes also went to St. Ignacious. You were in the same class. Ben Weston. 
He's been arrested on a hit-and-run. He's also under suspicion for murder. That makes you an accomplice after the fact. Twenty to life.
Yeah. Mitchell Sullivan found it in your car at his chop shop.
It's evidence.
You'll be happy to know that there were no long-distanced calls made on your cell phone. But there was one call made -- to 9-1-1 at 2:30 A.M. On Tuesday morning while your car was still in your possession.
Explain it to me, Ben. How does a lawyer rationalize something like this?
Let me guess. You wanted the alcohol to wear off before you called it in, right? So you decided to wait it out. Have a cup of coffee, sober up and then call the cops. But unfortunately, Bob Martin woke up.
So what do you do now, hmm? Can't walk into the Emergency Room and say, 'Hey, this guy was bleeding to death in my garage while I was eating mu shu pork.'
Yeah. It's tough, huh? Fifteen years to build your dream and a fifteen-second phone call destroys it.
When a driver hits a pedestrian the presumption is the driver is negligent. When a driver's been drinking and he hits a pedestrian it's no longer negligence, it's reckless homicide. But when a pedestrian intentionally throws himself in front of a moving vehicle then the driver's no longer responsible. Legally, he's off the hook.
Until you let him die.
There's only one interpretation for this: 'Kill the pig.'
His wife and daughter are missing. His silver Cadillac DTS is also missing. We're looking for any signs of forced entry in the house, any signs of ransack that's not associated with the party.
So he probably fought back.
Nine millimeter standard issue.
Why didn't she plan better? Pack the kid's clothes.
The nanny told me that she only took one shirt -- one the kid wouldn't even wear.
You saw Chief Rittle leave?
Grissom.
Brass found the Chief's Cadillac.
Who found it?
'Chief Rittle'?
I don't know. But if he has gunpowder residue on him, could be our shooter. 
In Florida?
Well, if it is our little girl, she's got evidence on her from two Vegas homicides. 
One of us should be down there to process.
Take Warrick. I don't think he's ever been to Florida.
So, I guess he didn't shoot Rittle.
His lower back? I thought he was shot twice in the head.
That's rare.
Pinball.
I'll call Catherine. Thanks.
Well, a very important police officer was murdered there.
Anybody who wasn't in 'the circle'?
Well, that's 120 hours. There must be something you know about him that you could share with us.
Cheap? How?
Are you sure it was cologne?
Would you happen to have an article of clothing of his by any chance?
Hey, guess what? This isn't about you. This is about a missing seven-year-old girl.
Body odor, bad breath ...
I don't know. There's something about Adam Van Der Welk that makes him smell.
'Sickly sweet.' 
Smells can be like fingerprints, my dear. Hey, what's going on there?
Maple, elm, ash, what?
This is how I work.
I'm following my nosino.
Doesn't that give you a rash that smells like human excrement we're looking for something a little sweeter.
I think I overlooked some evidence.
Smell this.
In the five days that you two were together, did you happen to notice what he was drinking?
Did he ever drink anything sweeter like whiskey or cognac?
Diabetic ketoacidosis - 
it's an insulin deficiency. His body's been expelling excess glucose. Makes him smell fruity.
Well, blood's the best but if you had a urine sample, maybe.
Novalin insulin.
Hey.
Nice tan.
Yeah, well, I knew you were coming back today, so I dressed up.
Really. 
What?
I had to go to the Chief's funeral.
I'll be right there.
Please tell the doctor that I have to reschedule my appointment. Thanks.
Any I.D. Yet?
She live here?
I think she just ratted herself out.
Drug use?
Food poisoning?
Sometimes I'm not sure of anything.
How did it get into her bloodstream?
Amazing the advances we make in science and the primitive uses we find for them.
What about the crater in her check?
There's no ligature marks anywhere. I'd think she would need to be restrained for something like that, wouldn't you?
Why are you showing me this?
They also wanted her ugly.
Who turned the water off?
Well, Narcissus would be proud.
I thought Doc Robbins said the victim's tox screen came back negative.
Smells like mint.
Enema. The secret life of women.
You're right. I'm sorry.
Catherine ... 
What are you doing here?
Question: How did Ashleigh James get from her loft to this underpass?
I'm pretty sure she was pushed.
Coincidence?
Aren't you putting the shopping cart before the horse? In order to decipher a code you need to know the alphabet for the code. In order to know the alphabet, you need to know the author.
So, what's the cart telling us?
Well, the victim had no relationship to the cart except for the fact that we found her in it. I'm more interested in the person who used to call this cart home.
I stand corrected.
I have a feeling whoever owned this cart ... was an Ashleigh James fan.
Excuse me?
Pthirus pubis. Feeds on human blood. They prefer the pubic and perianal regions because their legs are adapted to grasp hairs which are widely spaced. They don't usually nest in clothing. But when the clothing is being worn by someone with substandard personal hygiene ...
We have a high-end handbag found in a street person's shopping cart a jacket covered in crabs in a closet full of designer clothes. What does that tell us? 
Tells me that whoever is missing a shopping cart is also missing his jacket.
Good stuff in here.
No. Sorry.
It depends.
I'm not playing. I've got a gal named Sara, and she would love that scarf. What do you say? 
Trade me.
I'm a Trader. I traded Tookie my jacket for this scarf.
I think fleas can tell time.
That's a nice ring. 
I'll trade you
I'll trade you for your kit, too.
I've been trying to do that for years.
Greg ran the blood on this scarf. It matches the victim's.  How about the blood on the knife?
The tools of the trade; the weapons of beauty.
Cassie?
Yeah. And her Pauper sister could be the killer.
Hot dog?
Relish?
I'd have to investigate.
So, you're pretty careful about what you eat?
Newton's theory twisted again.
How about your sister?
Hey, Cassie, you know that scarf you gave Tookie?
Did your sister give that to you or ... did you steal it from her?
What did she steal from you?
How long ago was this taken?
Cassie threw her life away and her sister Ashleigh recycled it.
It's like a crossword puzzle, isn't it? Once you pick it up, you can't put it down.
J3? Date? January 3rd? June 3rd? July 3rd? Uh, third 'J' month, July?
Parking space in a parking garage?
J3 ... J3 ... city or state grid map?
Who?
Why?
You tried to save her? Your sister?
Yes, she does.
You tried to stop yourself, didn't you? But you couldn't.
What? Forced oral?
Eating disorder.
She doesn't seem that skinny.
Till her entire system is in a state of shock.
Body starts feeding on its own muscle. Is that what killed her?
Blood infection. Caused by the injuries to her face?
So she didn't just die. She's been dying for a long time.
Cassie James's psych profile.
Which explains why the interrogation room was too hard on her. For schizophrenics, you know, the tighter the space, the more unbearable the feelings tend to be.
Ashleigh James?
She suffered from septicemia, indicative of chronic abuse. But ... what if Cassie wasn't the one who inflicted Ashleigh's facial wounds?
I don't know.
All animals prefer symmetry in their mates. The male Japanese scorpion flies with the most symmetrical wings gets the most mates.
In terms of entomology being beautiful is about being even. It signals the fitness to procreate.
And so, she was, uh ... operating like a scientist seeking a perfect formula to take her pain away.
She attacked herself. 
I mean, Ashleigh was convinced that everything about her needed to be fixed. The real problem was inside her head. She couldn't deal with that so she tried to fix the outside. Hence, the digging and picking and purging and bleeding.
To us, it would be torture. To her ... some sort of release.
So the victim and the killer became one and the same. The very nature of addiction -- whether it be self-medicating herself or self-mutilating -- is that the very behavior we use to survive it becomes a behavior that ends up killing us.
Well, the fingerprints explain that.
I think Cassie was trying to take care of her sister. She pushed her to a place where she thought she'd be safe. Where she thought she could see herself for how beautiful she really was. 
I'm sorry about your sister, Cassie.
True. Death does have some advantages. Would you like me to help you get in a shelter?
Or until you lose it.
Were your and your sister's secrets the same?
Looking for things, analyzing them ... trying to figure out the world -- that's a life.
What will you do when you find it?
Obviously most of crime scene investigation is about seeing. But much of it is about hearing as well. Listening. Knowing how to listen. Not just to what people are saying but how they say it ... how their tone of voice matches their facial expressions or body posture. So, even if I read lips and know what they're saying ... it's not enough.
It's hereditary -- my mother.
Right. How long do you think?
Man versus Gravity. 
Man lost.
What do you think?
Dispatch called. The body's on county property.
Then why are you here, Sheriff?
Suicide, huh? I don't know, Brian. On the day you decide to end your life, why would you go to work?
You look like the Sheriff, but you talk like the Mayor. Mr. Harris, you get an extra bonus for early completion? 
Wow, $200,000. You must work your guys pretty hard, huh?
Where exactly was Valenti's work station?
Terminal velocity's 9.8 meters per second, squared. He would've hit the ground at under five seconds.
Did this belong to Mr. Valenti
This drill is shorted out. Do you think he 'jumped' before or after he got the shock of his life?
Big words meaning you won't get electrocuted.
But if the third prong of the plug is compromised, the interrupter won't work. Will it, Bob? 
These prongs don't usually snap off by themselves.
Are all your workers this careless with their tools?
These cutters may have been used to tamper with the grounding prong.
When your crime scene is twelve stories up ... I don't want to take any chances. I'm going to lock in these prints.
Bones of the inner ear: Malleus, Incus, Stapes. High cellular density, completely protected by the skull. Why?
I want to see the entry and exit wounds.
He fell after he was electrocuted.
Faulty drill. There should be burn marks on one of his palms.
Right. creating a fern-like pattern on the chest.
I don't care what the body says, this guy was electrocuted. It was not an accident.
What?
Signs of charring or melting. You've done this before.
Every now and then, we have to break the rules. Start with a conclusion and work our way backwards.
Like, for instance ... in the 1800s, when surgery was Russian roulette and patients were dying on the tables.
Until Louis Pasteur theorized that something we could not see, microscopic organisms were attacking the patients.
Bodies tell a story because we interpret them the way our predecessors taught us to. Just because we don't see something we're supposed to see doesn't mean that it's not there.
Wires were crossed.  Polarity's been reversed. This confirms that someone tampered with Valenti's drill.
Rubber's an insulator, but metal's a conductor. What form of metal hides in plain view at a construction site?
Sounds like you got a match.
Yeah. Especially if you bet against me.
You're the project manager but you don't actually use all the tools, right?
Sure. After the lab processes all the evidence.
Excuse me.
Who does?
Motive?
Ah, we're in a bowling league together.
Sure. Someone tampered with Roger Valenti's drill. And I have only one suspect. 
That's why they call it a prelim. Mr. Harris, were you opposed to Roger Valenti's union activities?
Yes.
Call Jim Brass at homicide.
Why are you telling me this?
I need to see the body again.
Final report?
Doc, please?
So, what have you got? I mean, anything unusual, even the mundane.
Troponin levels become elevated following ventricular fibrillation which could be caused by electrocution, right?
Work with me, will you?
Life-threatening?
What else?
Postmortem deoxygenation.
Tell me about his testicles.
Thanks, doc.
What're you guys doing?
A new case?
You didn't hear that from me, did you?
Greg ... I hope that's not the crossword puzzle.
What about the nail that we pulled out of Valenti's boot? Dusted?
Process the nail, please. And if you get a print ... 
Yes. Metal cutters. I need you to prove or disprove whether they were used to sever the drill's grounding prong.
And you're with me.
Mr. Gesek!
You're conducting ...
... Vivaldi, Four Seasons.
Have you prepped him yet?
Yeah, I know, Venice. I need to see his testicles.
I'll put you on the list. 
Testicular atrophy. They're the size of peas. 
Hemochromatosis. Valenti had elevated levels of iron in his blood. Yellow pallor, shrunken testicles ... I think he's been ingesting trace amounts of iron over a long period of time.
No. Iron molecules take a long time to build up. Could have been his diet repeated blood transfusions, excessive smoking possibly hereditary abnormalities.
One step closer. Mr. Gesek? Stick a syringe in his carotid all the way to his clavicle.
One pint, to go.
Thank you.
Well, iron is a conductive mineral. I want to know if there was enough iron in Valenti's blood to conduct electricity.
Yeah, well ... we'll see. Plug in the blood.
Hey, is that from the deli?
No. Can I have your pickle?
Oh, that's a nice one.
I'm electrocuting it.
This is how I cooked my hot dogs in college.
Check out the burn marks.
Pickles are high in sodium content.
Normally, the flow of electricity through a body generates heat.
Burn marks are the physical evidence of that heat. But ... if the body offers no resistance to the flow of electricity-no heat, no burn marks.
No burn marks, but he was still electrocuted.
They were not on the nail. You see, I think that someone stuck a nail in the victim's boot and it evidently wasn't Bob Harris.
Obviously, that wasn't my intent.
What are you talking about? What newspaper article?
I'm not making an apology.
You get my message?
Ian Wolf, Union of Electrical Workers, Local 37. He wanted to make sure that I stayed on Harris for the murder of Roger Valenti.
I told him to talk to you.
What?
Just like any other case.
Despite your efforts to make it seem that way.
Let's not make the same mistake twice.
Where's Mandy?
What if I narrowed the scope? To one.
Ian Wolf. Like the animal not the authors.
Warrick's on it. I got a warrant for his tool belt -- metal cutters included.
Overlap to one.
Not for an electrician I'm going to find Brass.
Yeah, you did.
They're just part of the story.
You spiked Roger's boot with the nail -- compromised the insulation. 
You reversed the polarity in his drill. 
You cut the grounding prong, planted evidence. And killed a man.
Sheriff.
Yeah, how about that? Just in time for my big 'public apology'.
Good, I leave that to you.
Strange, people usually aren't scared of class clowns.
Shot him in the back.
Yeah. We're looking for a coward.
Hand me a bindle.
Brass ...
Yeah. A little.
Yeah, it better. We have a point of reference.
Give me a hand, will you? 
.44. Here, take this. 
Orange, by my kit. It was in his backpack.
Did you get something? 
They do have a timeless quality. 
I was a ghost.
Here.
Shooter was standing right there. 
And ... ? 
Is that a Polymer Sensor Proboscis? 
Electronic noses run like ten grand.
If that thing ran out of here and bit the shooter in the ass, the county would not approve a $10,000 purchase order.
Our job is to think, Warrick. Machinery should never matter more than our mind. Try this ... 
Glass tube. Air pump ... 
Fresh out. Improvise.
Can you arrange for us to meet with Dennis?
Well, then, this will be brief.
You coming?
How tall are you, Dennis?
Have you washed your hands in the last hour?
Changed your shirt?
I'd like to do a test on your shirt if I may.
Forensic.
G.S.R. When someone fires a weapon, gunshot residue plumes back onto their hands and clothing. 
This means that you fired a gun within the last three to six hours.
The police are going to want to talk to you.
Did you ever rent a .44 caliber?
Jim.
Let me guess. Decomp in an enclosed space?
Lemons.
Use lemons.
The heart? That makes no sense.
But not with a knife, it looks like prongs.
Where was his heart?
Dextrocardia? Like Dr. No? That only presents in .01% of the population?
How long ago did you say he was stabbed?
No.
I did; they had no idea he'd been stabbed.
They talk to you, though, right? The guidance counselor? Who else may have had it in for Barry Schickel?
Really?
With a fork? Stabbed him above his left pectoral.
Where were you last night about 6:00?
Okay. Thanks.
No one's blaming you.
You know who did this, don't you? 
Yeah. But where does that leave Barry Schickel?
I trust you.
What doesn't belong?
Put him there, how?
No, no. I'm going stay here ... with this, close to Warrick.
You still got that $10,000 e-nose you were using?
I just want the software.
You grabbed a top note of 'floral' and now we ask the software to break it into ingredients. Do you recognize any of these?
Some of these perfumes have, like, 750 ingredients.
'Chanteuse.'
Yeah, the original application for this program was perfume companies. You know, testing new brands stealing from the competition.
Grissom.
Let me guess. Denny Fram's sister?
Vapor molecules. See if you can get a warrant for her perfume and have Brass bring her in.
We isolated a combination in the restroom where Barry Schickel was shot. It matches your perfume.
Might be true. Scent triggers memory more acutely than any of the five senses.
You said that you went back to the high school that night after target practice.
Excuse us.
Who's Jeremy Spencer?
Do you ever smell a fart and end up blaming the wrong guy? 
Why do you think your sister shot Barry?
Because why?
She asked Barry's coach to help you. That was her protection plan. She was nowhere near the high school that night.
No. You smelled her brand of perfume.
We recovered this from your townhouse on a warrant. Chanteuse. 
We also found the gun. It hasn't been cleaned.
You know how to shoot one.
Or eleven.  Captain Brass ran a search on you. Tetrick High School, Tetrick, Arizona. Eleven kids shot a few days after Columbine. You were the Assistant Principal.
It says that you were left with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. You might want to mention that to your lawyer.
You know, Miss Barrett as difficult as high school can be for kids, eventually, it's over ... but too soon for Barry Schickel.
For all we know, this is animal blood.
A deer hunter comes home from the mountains drunk decides to play butcher clean his kill. Chops his game up into oven-sized pieces for the winter. I mean, what does he care? He's renting.
And a human has only eight pints of blood. So, whoever the victim is ... is now dead.
Well, by and large, the average diameter is about one millimeter.
Just acquaint yourself, Sara. Don't interpret just yet, okay?
Couch? We've only got 30 seconds till this luminol disappears.
Television, maybe? A magazine?
What do you think that is?
High-velocity, small spray.
Did you notice if Mr. Renteria left a forwarding address?
Hopefully not. That's all the evidence we have.
Gee, Brass, all in one shift. I'm impressed.
We just came from your old apartment. We found some disturbing evidence there. Would you care to explain that?
Mr. Renteria, your apartment walls are covered in human blood. Are you aware of that?
Do you have an explanation?
Your blood?
You expirated blood from your nose all over your apartment walls to get back at your manager?
He's lying. Expirating from your nose would leave oval-shaped blood patterns. The ones we found in his apartment were V-shaped.
Well, may we see your furniture?
Electric saw.
Interesting lamp. 
Mr. Renteria, with your permission, I'd like to move some of your property to my lab for a closer inspection.
So?
This cannot be right.
What about the blood on the lamp?
Well, get through it. 
I also thought the metric system would catch on. Look, everything that starts with a faulty premise is bound to fail. I saw 'V' patterns and I foolishly ruled out the nose.
Hepatitis C destroys the liver and a whole host of clotting functions. Cliff, indeed, has blood to spare.
Mr. Renteria, I can't sign off on a case until I fully understand it. So, let me get this straight. You had a beef with your landlord and you decided to pay him back by blowing blood out of your nose all over the apartment walls. Is that about right?
A day? A week? A couple of months? How long did this take?
So, you get up in the morning, make coffee and go 'I think I'll blow some blood on the kitchen wall today.' Get out of the shower grab your towel, go 'Hey, this looks like a nice spot to expirate a couple of pints.'
So, you made your statement through your nose?
Yeah, well ... as it turns out our guy stands very close to the wall and blows almost sideways.
Right through his Jimmy Durante. Ambidextrous, both nostrils.
Two things which may have nothing to do with each other.
Same thing we're always looking for evidence of a crime. Failing that, we'll have to release this apartment.
I don't see any evidence of that.
No.
How many flies do you count in this room?
I counted four on my first walk-through.
Fresh. Problem is flies don't feast on dry blood.
So they're feeding on fresh blood. Could be a rodent, though, or bad garbage.
The preponderance of flies is in this room. 
Either Paul or John. 
The most important. The Silphid Beetle typically feeds on decomposing human flesh.
Mr. Evans ... could you get permission from the owner to let us break into these walls? Our original warrant didn't cover that.
We can't divulge that but it may be ... all the walls.
Yeah.
We don't do that.
DNA lab. I don't want to hear any rumors that Paul is dead. He may be the only chance we have of getting in these walls.
Yeah.
Is this definitive?
The beetle was full of human DNA. Brass got us a judge.
You left him?
Miss Scott, we found some blood on one of Cliff's lamps.
Would you be amenable to providing us with a sample of your blood for comparison purposes?
Yeah, I still want a sample. Warrick, would you?
You never get a second chance to make a first impression.
Right. Think outside the box.
We need to take a look at your wall.
Scented candles, huh?
You wouldn't mind if I, uh ... examined your vent, would you?
Did you know that your apartment shares heating ducts with the apartment next door?
Sara?
And Dermestidae Masculatus.
You can tell us where the body is or we can, uh ... tear your place apart piece by piece. Whichever. 
Let's open it up.
I don't know. I don't mind being wrong. I just don't think I am this time. Okay ... start on the floorboards. I'm going outside.
Ninety-five.
Normally my pulse is seventy. When it gets to 95, I realize how mad I am. I-I have ten people working around the clock on this thing.
No, no. I'm not mad at me. There's a body in there and that guy knows where it is!
No.
I'm fine.
Oh.
Hey, Brass. When did The Shnoz say he lost his hot water?
You, uh, have no pressure for your hot water.
Well, you know, my Uncle Herb was a plumber. I might be able to help. Where's your installation?
You got an electrician coming, too? 
A filtration system. It softens the water.
Yeah, well, I'm non-union.
There's no disruption to the cold water line. Hot water line ... water runs through the filtration tanks first and the water heater second, right?
Why is it bypassed? You've cut off the water to the filtration tanks. 
Brine tanks are usually hollow. Only got about eight inches of water at the bottom for the salt mixture.
Does that sound hollow to you?
She nagged you?
No, thanks.
I'm having breakfast with a friend of mine.
He did.
Call said one dead body.
You have anything to say? 
You don't have to talk to us.
He'll talk to us.
Body's been moved from the murder scene. Impound his car.
Let's process this guy shall we? Officer, would you uncuff him, please?!
Hold still. 
Possible secondary transfer ...
No defensive wounds. No hematomas.
Matthew ... tag that body for special processing, VIP room. Don't wash it till I get there, and don't touch his fingernails.
But what kind? All-purpose? Self-rising? Pastry?
What about the neck? Any fibers in the wound?
Well, that hasn't stopped you yet.
Be my guest.
Dress shirt ... but no tie.
Find me on the flour.
You get all that from his ... uh ... dentals?
.380s?
That's not what killed him, is it? We pulled a yellow fiber out of the neck wound. I think it's from his tie.
Why would a guy shoot a man three times and then strangle him with his own tie?
So, why did you rule out bakeries?
Are you employed, Ben?
You make pizzas?
Do you, uh ... ever come into contact with the baking flour at Dante's?
Well, 'cause we found flour on the victim and it's the kind that's used to make pizza. Can you explain that?
Ben, why don't you earn yourself some points by telling me what the science is going to tell me anyway?
No ... but we're going to figure it out.
Murders? There are more bodies?
Hold up.
Isolate it.
Any more bodies you want to tell me about?
We're going to radar this whole hillside.
Sometimes ... when I leave a crime scene where I've been particularly involved with a dead body, I sit in my car and it hits me -- how close I was ... how heavy the body is ... the texture of the body ... how it feels... you know?
You're not a bad person?
Then, what are you?
Father?
Of this crime scene.
Yeah, I imagine he does.
It's the 11th hour. I wouldn't expect anything less.
When the reality of their actions set in, they usually turn to religion.
Okay, hold it. That's enough. Let's dust him.
See if this laceration on this guy's forehead is consistent with the kid's shovel.
Well, it obviously wasn't a robbery.
They didn't happen to find another car there, did they?
I don't see your, uh ... visitor's badge.
What makes you think, uh ... I was ever a catholic?
This is his car. You know, you really shouldn't be here.
Is that a problem?
This luminol reveals dried blood.
I believe the car.
Good work, you guys. Very good. But you haven't proved murder. You've proved burial.
From burying them.
He transported them. Show me the gun with Ben's prints on it. Gun shot residue, the ligature, the ... 
Yes. Empirical evidence. St. Thomas was ahead of us all.
No. It has to do with the evidence.
Okay. Ship it. Show it to the D.A.
I looked deeper into the evidence. I should have looked deeper into Ben's character.
Tell me about your brother. We know that you only buried the bodies. So, what happened? Did he threaten you?
Ben?
Did you learn to throw pizzas in prison, Roger?
You did it directly after work using a .380 pistol and then you strangled one of the victims with his own tie. 
Did you witness this?
The perpetrator's hands left flour on the victim's face. This is not from a gunshot. This was something a little more intimate.
When a person changes his mode of murder from pistol to ligature it's for one of two reasons - entertainment ... or necessity. Which was it for you?
The flour said you did.
Possibly.
So, he altered the barrel somehow.
Unfortunately, we've had this discussion before.
The bullet jammed in the feed, didn't it?
So, it was necessity.
About?
There isn't one piece of evidence that says that kid was even present at the murders.
Well, how convenient. The older brother brings it in explaining why his epithelials are all over the murder weapon.
He set up his brother.
He's a good kid, Robin. He hero-worships his brother, but he's a good kid.
Explain how bits of your skin got on the ligature used to strangle that victim.
Your brother brought this in to the district attorney.
Unless you can tell us how your epithelials got on that tie.
Do you have any physical evidence linking your brother to the murders? Anything?
I know that we've arrested the wrong brother.
He came to see you as soon as Ben was in custody.
We both have jobs that begin after the crime. 
Some people would call that a career in futility.
A hundred years ago we didn't have the technology for fingerprints. Fifteen years ago, we didn't have DNA. Hopefully one day, we'll have foolproof means by which to put the right man in jail in this case.
Thank you ... but ...  ... no.
In religion? I believe in God, in science ... in Sunday supper. I don't believe in rules that tell me how I should live.
How many crusades were fought in the name of God? How many people died because of someone's religion?
Semantics. They're still dead. I'm sorry about Ben, father.
That guilt's not in me anymore.
Hey.
Spa safety?
So what am I supposed to say?
CSI supports Las Vegas.
Oh, no, no, no. How did this happen?!
Point of impact: Passenger-side door.
Question is: Why did the SUV cross the tracks?
Sheriff says we're holding up trains all over the country. This entire railroad division depends on keeping the main line open.
Well, unfortunately, his priority is clearing this train from the tracks. You have two hours.
Suspicious circs in town. This one's all yours.
Sara's all you get.
The Western States Historical Society. It's not on a lot of tourist maps.
We need to identify the source of the alarm, Ray. Security company said it was downstairs. The body's there, too.
There are no more lights, O'Riley. It's a controlled environment. Notice how you're not sweating? It's probably sixty-six degrees in here. Thirty-five percent relative humidity. Too much light, too much heat degrades the books.
What-- nobody's got a key?
You got first touch.
Foam could be from blood in her lungs. Edema. Skin is cyanotic. Maybe a blood disease. Leukemia. Meningitis. We'll know after the post.
Excuse me?
Did he tell you what he was doing here?
So you went down to the basement to say good night.
Did she walk you to the bus tonight?
You mean she was sweating?
She was convulsing.
Mr. Pratt, will you excuse me for a moment?
I think he's autistic.
Rain Man was a savant. Extremely rare. Aaron Pratt is a high-functioning autistic man with superior right-brain ability.
The crime scene's in the basement.
Have you finished with our lady of the library?
Explains the blue face. Underlying cause?
I'm thinking about homicide.
They're evidence in an active criminal investigation -- also one of a kind.
The good news, Nick? We had a camera in here.
Yeah, there is -- Aaron Pratt. We just have to figure out how to get the film out of his head.
So, all of your chemicals in here are alkaline?
To reach '7,' the neutral ph.
No.
All of that and you never thought about beefing up your security?
Is this one of the books that Veronica was restoring?
He's not weird, O'Riley, he's autistic.
'But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve / for daws to peck at. I am not what I am.'
Very good, Aaron. Now, you want to tell me how Othello ended up in your briefcase?
I like Hamlet myself. And I bet Mr. Hunter is into King Lear. He's very concerned with property rights. He tells me the rare books are kept in the vault and they're not allowed off-site.
He takes the books home?
What do you mean, 'and Veronica'?
Aaron ... 
I get it. Did they know that you were watching them?
These books are from the Historical Society.
Aaron, what about these books?
Aaron, may I have a glass of water, please?
Thank you.
I think he's incapable of deception, Nick. We're just witnessing displaced anxiety. I mean, look around. Everything's in precise order.
Order provides comfort. His life is based on routine. Without it, he can't function.
Thank you.
Now, how did these books get here?
She was here.
What do you mean you date?
You two were involved with each other?
No. You told me Veronica was involved with Mr. Hunter.
Thank you.
'Yet she must die else she betray more men. Put out the light, and then put out the light.'
Hey.
I just got the word on our library victim. How does ricin grab you?
So you think she ate the poison.
Well, botanically speaking, it's a spurge, not a bean. Ricin is made from the husk. Castor oil is made from what's inside.
Three, actually. Someone knew how to turn this spurge into a poison.
Mm-hmm.
We brought this from his apartment, not his office.
Our guys didn't find anything there.
Not that different from the way Veronica died, is it?
I found this book in your apartment. What if I also told you that I found your fingerprint on this page?
But you did touch it.
What do you mean, it doesn't feel right?
Did you tell anyone that the illustrations felt different?
What did Mr. Hunter say?
Was Mr. Hunter having lunch with Veronica again?
Was this lunch different from the other lunches you told me about?
How?
Aaron, I want you to be very specific. Tell me what you saw.
We're talking about ricin. The toxin that killed Veronica Bradley. You were dating her. You ate lunch together.
We have a witness who says he saw you try to kill her.
Normally an eyewitness is the least reliable evidence we have. But in this case, it's the most reliable. Veronica knew about the forgeries. A career-ender, huh, Stanley?
Go on.
Why didn't you tell us about the forgeries earlier?
Tell me again, what did you see?
Aaron, when you look at things you see pictures in your mind. Tell me the first picture you see of Veronica in this cage.
Tell me something you haven't told me. Tell me what Veronica was doing before you said good night.
Why was she looking around?
Tell me what 'Veronica deciding something' looks like.
Thank you, Aaron.
Some people bite their nails; she bit her pens. Bad habit.
Castor bean. Ricinus communis.
And maybe how she died.
Get these to Greg right away. We need the results of the ricin elisa test.
Veronica removed the original illustrations from the books and replaced them with forgeries which she then left at your house so that she could point the finger at you if it ever came to that. She never thought that you'd find out but you did. And you told Mr. Hunter.
So, Veronica tried to save hers but instead of killing Mr. Hunter she ended up killing herself.
That's okay.
I like order.
Scared?
... but too well.'
But Othello killed Desdemona.
No, you didn't.
There's no sign of struggle. Whatever happened, happened somewhere else. This is a secondary scene.
Textbook. David, when we dig her up, I want you to tag her special processing. 
The only person who knows where the crime scene is has her mouthful of sand.
He didn't put it here to hide it. He put it here to be found.
What do you think?
To get to the evidence, we may destroy the evidence.
Every time you find a body, you have to choose a path and when you take that path, Grasshopper, you risk destroying the evidence.
So what are we looking at? Rape, multiple sexual assaults?
Here's a woman who's been beaten on a regular basis but look at the care she's lavished on herself. 
Manicured fingernails, manicured toenails. Perfect teeth, hair.
Are you sure the surgeon said this is where Mona Taylor worked?
The eternal question to which we're about to find the answer.
You don't seem very upset about it.
We need names and addresses. We also need to know which rooms she worked last night so we can examine them.
Okay, tow it to CSI and then start processing the rooms in the pool house where Mona worked last night.
I'll be with Lady Heather.
Yes. I find all deviant behavior fascinating in that to understand our human nature we have to understand our aberrations.
I would say that whip marks and ligature contusions on a young woman are aberrant. Wouldn't you?
Mona did. She died.
Like the theatre.
Oh, I have outlets. I read. I study bugs. I sometimes even ride roller coasters.
It doesn't involve going to the theater.
'No man is a complete mystery except to himself.' Marcel Proust.
Probably. No crime is a complete mystery, either. The whip marks on Mona Taylor were fresh.
My guess is that one of her off-the-book clients ... is a regular. I mean, it is a repeat business, is it not?
Yes, it does. May I borrow it?
I considered it.
Like a straw?
Well, it's not a s*x club, actually. It's a fetish club.
Like a straw is not used for sipping mint juleps.
Air.
Mona was a Dominatrix at the fetish club. But my guess is that she was a switch for her off-the-books clients.
Someone who's dominant as well as submissive.
If Mona's DNA is in one of these masks, then she was the submissive on the night she died.
Yes, I do, Greg. I also need to know which straw she used.
And even less if someone's fingers are on the other end.
Our killer. Now we just need a suspect.
You got the yin. I've got the yang.
Thank you. Now we'll see how yours turns out.
You know any fine jewelers?
Thanks for your help.
If the dad didn't buy the watch then the mom did. Brass has the credit card receipt.
Gustav Stickley. Very nice furniture. No pictures of your family though.
Most people keep pictures of their loved ones in their office.
Do we need one?
Okay. How about this? Are you familiar with the gal who calls herself Lady Heather?
Well, one of the girls who works for Lady Heather was found dead with an imprint of your watch on her wrist. That's why we'd like a sample of your DNA.
We did. We also got a warrant.
Is the watch in the box? 
Afternoon tea. How nice. 
Well, I'm a little needy myself today. My lab pulled skin cells from Mona Taylor's straws.
They're male.
Have you ever seen either of these two people?
I didn't say they were married. 
You're very good. You could work for me.
You never know. We both might learn something.
You like fine things.
I'm that obvious, huh?
Which is?
Lady Heather, you're an anthropologist.
'Grains of golden sand.'
Edgar Allan Poe. Another man who was familiar with murder.
Liquid latex.
Your husband made Mona Taylor wear it every time that he paid to humiliate her.
He made her into nothing in order to make her into you.
I guess that made it more real.
Mrs. Nelson, we're going to match Cameron's epithelials to the ones on the end of the straw.
We do?
Good. He'd probably like it.
Okay. I never told anybody this, Catherine ...
And the body count?
Cash on wheels.
Small time crooks, Jim.
Yeah? That's a mere pittance to a Vegas casino. Cashiers alone are sitting on a million and change.
Dangerous, yes. Ladies ...
... no.
My bet was that that was the practice run.
Actually, it was. Gives us a starting point.
The falling chandelier distracts the guards. Makes them easy targets.
The armed robbers load up, head for the exits.
Chaos moving in one direction, the money moving in the other.
A Harvard Professor conducted an experiment. Asked a bunch of students to watch a basketball game -- count the number of times the ball was passed. 
During the game a person dressed in a gorilla suit ran across the court. Afterwards, the professor asked his students if they noticed the gorilla. Fifty percent responded, 'What gorilla?'
Extraction is an art, Albert.
Caliber?
The guards were armed with nine millimeters and they weren't hollow point. So ... he was shot in the back by one of his own partners?
You want to see me?
This is the video surveillance from that heist. This camera was trained on their entrance.
All the disguises in the world and they dress like women.
Well, Blue's the decedent I.D.'d as Adam Brower ... so enlarge red.
That must be the one that killed Brower. .45 in the back at close range. 
Photoshop black.
Dressed as a woman among men dressed as women. Now, see? That's a disguise.
If you're going to badger me about your crime scene location, put it in a memo.
I always remember the ones that get away.
And this is a special bullet?
And the substance is special?
This bullet is from my investigation.
Tammy Felton?
Three armed robbers. Adam Brower-- killed at the scene Tammy Felton ... we're still one suspect short.
So Tammy kills dad ... and she and Darin Hanson run off together. 
Let me see, Bobby.
Bullets confirm the story told by the potato.
Three suspects. Adam Brower, deceased. Tammy Felton, Darin Hanson, still at large.
Well, if that's the getaway car there would have been a secondary vehicle parked nearby.
Shall we?
No damage. This car was barely moving. 
I thought you guys were processing the car?
It's used to make glass. It's mined in open pits. Why?
There's an abandoned silica mine outside calnevari.
Come here.
Get your guns out.
Say hello to Darin Hanson. 
And ... we're out of suspects.
Three armed robbers hold up the casino. Tammy's in black, Adam was the one in blue and that leaves us Darin.
The surveillance video tells us that Darin was the only one in position to shoot Adam.
And we still don't know why Darin and Tammy took out the convenience store clerk.
Well done, Warrick. You found our mole.
Yeah. I'll call Brass. He can make the arrest.
Yeah. All murdered.
Except all we got is a gun in drag.
The clerk from the convenience store.
But the pit boss said it was Darin plus three.
Well, maybe he didn't know that the clerk wasn't there. He wasn't counting wigs. He was hiding under a blackjack table.
But you've been there haven't you?
Jim, hit the overhead, will you?
Silica is a crystal. It reflects the light. Even trace amounts will show up.  Huh. How about that?
Was it worth it?
Yeah, well, he had his price.
I'm listening.
E-C-G ... C major chord. All the slots play the same notes -- perfect harmony. Makes people happy.
You ever played poker, Warrick?
Whose hand was this?
Mmm.
Two cowboys -- one in the flop, trips. 
Pair of aces.
No river card, though. Burn one, turn one.
The Death Card.
Bag it separately.
Urine, maybe. Game like this, leaving the table early could be perceived as a sign of weakness.
Why don't you tell me when you take it back to the lab and process it?
It's how I financed my first body farm in college.
Well ... poker's not a game of interaction. It's a game of observation. I used to study people. And then I guess I, uh ... got bored. Now I study evidence.
Same reason a good player hides his 'tells.' 
I did not know that.
So no heart attack?
I haven't seen a case of lead poisoning in years.
It looks like he's got a bullet in his thigh.
Enough to kill him?
Everyone has a tell, don't they, Lita?
Only one thing.
Lita Gibbons was the last one to sit down at the table and she never left her chair. So ... how'd the eye drops get into his drink?
Too many. 
Miss Gibbons, what color are your eyes?
Well, why are you wearing just one contact lens? 
Why is it tinted? We're going to need to take that contact lens. And your eyedrops.
Is this the same color as the contact lens? 
All right, stick around. I need your eyes.
Find the aces.
Four.
Lita Gibbons was playing the daub. She was cheating. She marked the corners of the cards with lip balm.
So she didn't kill Doyle Pfeiffer.
I'd like some information.
Where's your alcohol? I don't see any bottles.
Really? May I order a double bourbon on the rocks?
You keep the drink and the change.
Reverse suction.
Aye. There's the rub.
Suspicious waitress. Standard protocol for ordering drinks -- the sodas, then mixed drinks, then beers. First five rounds, she ordered correctly. The last round, however she ordered Doyle's whiskey sour first.
You made the time. 
You changed the order of your drinks and the switch-up gave you ... opportunity. 
So, the kid gets the pot but he doesn't get the reputation.
Yeah, that's what she said.
Basophillic stippling?
So where'd the rest of the lead come from?
Okay, the last hand. I'm Doyle, I've been sitting in the same chair for thirteen hours. Here comes the cocktail waitress. She serves me my drink.
Flashes me then she looks at Matt.
It's irrelevant. We've been chasing eyedrops to death. We're looking for lead.
Did you guys know that seventy percent of the world's chocolate is produced in West Africa?
Yeah. The Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria, and Cameroon.
Doyle Pfeiffer didn't know either. Chocolate comes from cocoa plants, but in West Africa, the cars still use leaded gas. So when the exhaust fumes disperse into the atmosphere ... and it rains ... It pours lead. 
Then the cocoa's harvested, processed, refined, sold into bulk, and eventually ...
Doyle Pfeiffer's nickname was the 'Candyman.' He got that name the night he won the World Championship in '86.
By my calculations he might have consumed up to a pound of chocolate a night for sixteen years.
Ultimately the tetrahydrozoline in the eyedrops triggered it, but essentially, it was ... death by chocolate.
He didn't jump.
Up here.
It's never the fall that kills you.
High velocity spatter usually implies a gunshot.
Severe head trauma. It happened before the fall.
Kill and dump.
Swab it, print it, bag it. See if you can find out who smoked it.
125 hertz?
Yes, but most human speech is above 300 hertz. My midrange is still clear.
Well, you know what they say -- 'good fences make good neighbors.'
Hmm.
Ongoing.
Mm.
Well, we're going to need to process him.
Looks like the elbow got stuck in the blade.
Yup, the ulna.
Possibly why whoever did this didn't finish the job.
I'm going to need a hand.
The last remains of John Doe. We're going to need sifters.
We're going to have to dismantle this piece by piece.
I'll get a foreman.
You know about meat grinders?
Found an ear plug. 
Ear wax is ripe with DNA.
This one's different than the ones they use. Whoever wore this brought it with them. We just have to find out whose ear it fits.
What do you make of the, uh scar tissue on the palm?
Looks like it's blistered.
I'll send this sample to trace.
Tips of the fingers look like they're worn to the bone.
Much more than that. Lansberry's Ridge Builder. One application to the bulbs of the fingers and the ridges plump out temporarily like a chia pet on steroids.
Petrov Samsko. Non-gaming sheriff's permit, head chef, Debreff Restaurant.
Chef-- that would explain the burn scar tissue on his palm.
Good, maybe you can get us a table.
We don't have reservations. W-we're here...
Not just dead. Dismembered. 
We're with the crime lab.
Hey, Cath?  Blood spatter.
Gil Grissom. I'm with her.
Who's, uh, Stephanie?
Oh, I understand how chefs cut their fingers and how the kitchen help could have blood spatter on their uniforms, but how does a waitress get blood on the back of her shirt?
Okay, this 'rush' is taking entirely too long.
Looks like a v-pattern to me. What do you think?
Burn area seems too big for a candle.
Mr. Dutton, uh, can I ask you what happened here?
Ah, excuse me. Stephanie?
Is this your uniform?
I thought you said the mafia left town.
Ross Halpo -- sous chef.
Lola Creighton -- saucier.
You want to tell us how the blood got here?
Okay. That still doesn't explain how the blood got on the uniforms.
Haven't these people ever heard of HIV?
Alert all your employees. We're going to take over your kitchen, starting now.
Presence of blood on the drain.
Looks like it. What would sand be doing in a kitchen?
This was not a little knife knick. This guy was stuck. I mean, uh, he bled out long enough for his blood to pool and clot.
Excuse me.  Starting with yours.
I thought there was a policy against the use of these in Las Vegas restaurants.
You know, those v-marks that we found in the restaurant -- those were made fairly recently. Certainly ... since the '70s.
According to your owner's log, ...  Danny Pasqualle, Italian male model suffered third-degree burns on his face the night of September 26, 2002.
Did he ever file formal charges against you?
No charges will be filed, Mr. Pasqualle if ... you'd be willing to fill out a statement to that effect.
The wound on your hand, Mr. Pasqualle? Patterned abrasions over the dorsal of the hand at the metacarpal phalangeal joints.
Human mouths are full of bacteria. A wound from a human bite is a tremendous source of infection, unfortunately.
You don't have to say anything, Mr. Pasqualle.
We just need your hand.
I knew that, Greg.
That would impress me.
I guess he settled out of court.
Thanks, Greg.
You can see why I might have a hard time believing you, right?
Excuse me.
He's denying murder.
Hey, do you guys serve mutton?
Mutton. It's from the french word for sheep. These fibers look like wool and since sheep are sheered before they're butchered I think that somebody was cooking something here, and it wasn't food.
That's heavy?
We're talking about clothes?
Okay, good. Thanks.
Did we get a DNA test?
You're the new guy.
Come here. Do you hear this?
I don't know. But I've learned that the evidence room is the quietest place in the lab.
Did you know that to a geologist there's no such thing as sand? Each grain is its own tiny rock. Fine, glassy crystals ...  ... dark. Obsidian, I bet.
Japanese call it singing sand. If you walk on certain beaches in Japan it'll make a musical sound.
Well.  'Let us carve him as a dish fit for the gods.'
Julius Caesar.
That's your knife.
This is the owner's log.
'The sous chef gets 89% of the meat off of trout filet -- six percent better than any chef on the line.' 
I don't think you killed the chef.  You did fillet him, though.
Your knife handle slid open...
...sand went down the drain landing on the victim's clotted blood.
It's hard work, carving up a man. I believe that's how you broke your knife handle.
But you didn't do this alone, did you?
Well, he's not denying anything. He's not admitting anything, either.
Such as?
Why did you kill him?
What does that mean?
Officer, would you take her to booking, please?
Yeah.
You up for dinner?
Well, someone's missing a contact lens.
You know, ravens, like eagles, have been known to travel 30 miles from roost to feeding ground.
'Once upon a midnight dreary while I pondered weak and weary over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore.'
'Quoth the raven, 'only this ... and nothing more.''
You'll be pleased to know the eyeball was only slightly desiccated.
Still blue.
Yeah, I sent some vitreous fluid to tox. The rest to DNA. So ... Can you get me an eye for an eye?
Feathers. For warmth.
Well, the only place we'd have seagulls around here would be Lake Mead.
Not found at Lake Mead.  You know, ravens are incredibly intelligent. They have a brain capacity comparable to dolphins.
... we're flying blind.
David.
A 35-year-old male. Car salesman. Dropped dead at work. Apparent heart attack. Not under the care of a physician. Uh, no history of high blood pressure. Just routine autopsy.
Go for it.
Yeah, our little miracle worker.
Well, that would explain the discoloration Robbins found around his mouth.
Yeah, real Ricky Roma.
We have a warrant to search your premises.
For evidence concerning the attempted murder of Fred Stearns.
No, he didn't ... and he's not.
Thank you.
Oral fixation you think? Constant need for gratification?
Depreciation doesn't make it a logical investment.
We're not buying, we're looking. If we need any help we'll let you know.
You always, uh, lock your drawers?
Huh.
You're the one who super-glued Fred's phone.
'Chewing gum: Will turn any mouth black for days.'
I get it. You're the funny guy.
Do you know the definition of attempted murder, Mr Hinton?
Go with you where?
Fate, or destiny. It's from the arabic word meaning to distribute, or divide up.
Dead guy. Not funny.
Tox screen ruled out the ink gum.
I don't care about his indigestion, Doc. We need to know what killed him.
Possibly reptilian skin?
Tox report. The organic poison came back snake venom. I think maybe it's time to open a relationship with Marty Gibson.
We found reptile skin on your jacket sleeve. So, unless you're shedding, we want to know how it got there.
No, thank you. 
No doughnuts.
Marty, what'd you do with the mice?
No. We were leaning towards murder.
Yeah, that's what we're afraid of.
Only, our victim didn't have any puncture wounds.
And brought the venom with him to the dealership.
Well, the trace lab found venom proteins in his coffee cup. Could that have killed him?
Because typically, the stomach acids would kill the venom before it reached the bloodstream, but if you had an ulcer...
No.
Well, the Elisa test came back positive for alpha-neurotoxins.
Which would send the body into complete and total paralysis, right?
Explaining why the victim ended up in the morgue the first time.
A coincidence is a scientific anomaly. Maybe he just got rid of the snake.
Marty Gibson.
What else did you do for Marty?
Did you get him coffee?
Now you do?
'The Goodwill Guy?'
Well, sometimes access is all you need.
Sylla-what?
Right. So, you're the snake guy. You're also the goodwill guy who gets the coffee. So, when someone is poisoned with snake venom in their coffee, 'a' plus 'b' equals you.
So you kill him?
I guess it's just too bad he had an ulcer.
Didn't you grow up in this neighborhood?
Drive-by. His girlfriend see anything?
You going to be able to handle this?
Well, we're obviously looking for an automatic.
The bullets went through the glass, shed their jackets or disintegrated completely on impact with the wall.
All we have left are lead cores, which are of no comparison value.
The only bullet that may help us is inside that little girl.
Well, it went through a bookcase. Nine millimeter.
Thanks.
You're sure. 
We only found a small amount of GSR on his hands. Could have been transfer from just picking up the murder weapon.
Well, either he's buying in bulk, or that stuff's hot.
I'm afraid the only bullets in here are silver bullets.
You got any paint transfer?
Call auto detail. We'll tow it back to the lab.
Jaycobs has an alibi.
Meet me in PD.
Mr. Phelps, it's good to see you again, sir.  Would you excuse us a moment? Warrick.
What's he doing here?
This was not a good idea.
David Artiss. Says he was with our suspect the night of the drive-by. Says he dropped him off at PJ's tavern right before we picked him up. Says he also saw him find the mac.
What is this?
Well, if this is evidence, it needs to be tagged and catalogued.
Can you prove that?
The job, Warrick, is to process evidence. Objectively, and without prejudice.
You know what? You're not working on this case anymore. I'll have another assignment for you tomorrow.
Where were we?
Go back to work.
What's going on, fellas?
Stovepipe. Possibly jammed in our murder weapon. Never fired, never exposed to the heat.
Yes.
I don't jump to conclusions.
Well, you may get a chance.  Your new assignment. Check out the pattern in the center of this contusion. It's probative.
Blue paint transfer. Possibly from your mailbox? I found a jammed nine millimeter cartridge in the backyard of a house a few doors down from where Jaycobs said he found the gun. Backyard of a house that had been broken into. You said he was a thief, right?
See, I think he lied about where he found the gun so we wouldn't know he was breaking into houses. Apart from that, I think he was telling the truth.
Shall we?
Greg. How many licks does it take to get to the center of a tootsie pop?
All play and no work make Greg an unemployed boy.
That would be me.
We found your saliva on this lollipop stick in Mr. Phelps's van, and we found your thumbprint on this bullet.
The van wasn't hot-wired, so I think you knew where Mr. Phelps kept his keys.
So Jason Gilbert was just collateral damage.
Yeah. But you're not the one who's paying for it.
Dispatch said breaking and entering and sexual assault?
What do you mean, 'blocked'?
Yeah ... except somebody was watching this girl.
He's been watching a lot of people.
You have evidence?
I went back to the crime stats ... pulled up all the reported peeping toms in a two-block radius over the last year.
He had 'raccoon eyes.' And that's about it. Plus, nobody called in any follow-up reports.
And I'm afraid our 'Tom' is on an escalated pace. Tonight was his first breaking and entering with an immediate second B&amp;E plus what appears to be his first sexual assault.
Yeah ... we better find him.
But they're in the predator's comfort zone which means he probably lives in the area, too. What else?
Blow dry it. It'll give us approximate height and shoe size.
All right, let's keep after it. This guy won't stop till he's caught.
Hey. So the owner of the pool company says he spends his lunch hour here every day.
Architecture. He has a 'Type'. All these buildings that recently reported peeping toms? Got floor plans from the management company. A-- second story, three bedroom. B-- ground floor, two bedrooms, center lots. C ... C-plans are all one bedroom on the end. Cheapest rent, highest foot traffic easiest to break in.
Yeah. And every apartment has sliding doors and windows. Not one sash, not one french.
You found his epicenter?
Predators usually widen their comfort zone in a spiral pattern outward.
My god, look at all the C-level apartments. P.D.'S going to have to triple their presence. 
He hit two apartments in one night. He's become compulsive.
Yeah, he's evolving ... perfecting ...
AV lab. Grissom.
Would you be exact, please?
Thank you.
You can handle it.
You look better on-camera.
De-escalating. I had figured Taylor Reed was branching out, widening his circle, but after last night, I think he's pulling in, going back to his original comfort zone. 
Five months ago. First floor. Broke in through a sliding door.
De-escalation. If we can't get to where he's going, we'll go where he's been.
I never think that.
The best intentions are fraught with disappointment.
Grissom.
What do you think?
Evidently. You got an I.D. on this guy?
Eyewitnesses?
It's amazing how the sight of blood can clear a room.
Wonder what made this wound? Looks like a puncture.
Proves the old adage.
You can't take it with you.
There's seminal fluid all over the place.
You guys smell that?
Smells like strawberries.
One of our 'freaks' wears pussycat pink.
Negative?
That's odd. It was a Den of Iniquity. 
What about the neck wound?
Any idea what caused it?
Anything else?
Looks like a bite. Spider bite or allergic reaction, maybe?
Gloves.
Okay, we're looking for any kind of blunt object that could've been used to stab our victim in the neck.
Size ten, double A.
Looks like murder to me.
Okay, this is the story. One of you lovely Cinderellas is missing a glass slipper and I'm playing the Prince. So would each of you remove your right shoe, please?
Doesn't fit.
Almost.
No.
Well, if the shoe fits ...
Excuse me, Jim. Am I interrupting something?
Miss ...
... I'm going to need a sample of your DNA.
I like your hair.
Are you a, uh, natural blonde?
Sorry. I needed a follicular tag.
Thank you.
Oh, yeah, we did. You'll need to fill out a form, though. The Captain will help you ...
... Surely.
Right after the murder.
So it's not a bug bite.
No needle?
Did you send a sample to tox?
Diabetic?
So cause of death was insulin shock.
He was staying at The Sphere.
Latex gloves, cotton swabs, specimen jars, other evidence-gathering stuff.
You tell us.
This room is registered to Trey Buchman. Who are you?
Not yet ...
Hey. 
Women's names. Hotels. Blocks of time.
Gigolo.
So was mine. Two victims, same profession.
What about the needle you found in the decomp?
Insulin dependents use needles that thin.
I think we're working the same case.
Employment history?
It's an observation.
Lady Heather, what services did they provide?
What would Aldous Huxley say?
Why?
You have lovely lips.
Hi, uh ... 
Yeah. Insulin poisoning.
I can't rule anybody out. Catherine ... I'm sorry about Eddie and your daughter. If, if you'd like to take some time off or ... 
You know, we found a dark hair in Trey Buchman's hotel room at the sphere.
Whoa. Stop.
You could tell us about your relationship with Croix Richards.
Which Mr. Richards helped you with?
We?
And these sessions were held at Lady Heather's?
He worked for Lady Heather as well. He's also dead.
Your wife does.
And the night you and I met at the Tangiers?
But her husband only knew about the guy he hired, Croix Richards. He had no idea that she hired Trey Buchman.
I guess you couldn't say no. I learned that Mr. McCormick is an investor in your internet site.
Did he ever tell you, specifically, what his wife's problem was?
A Pandora's box? All the evils of their marriage unleashed?
But he chose a woman who didn't understand the dynamics of a Dominant-submissive relationship.
No, in here, the submissive has the power. All he has to do is say the safety word and everything stops.
I'm just repeating what I've heard.
Part of the job.
Yes. But I value your insight.
I'm losing my balance.
No. I know who I am.
Yes, I do. 
You can always say stop.
What did you consider this? A little civility before work, I think?
Yeats ... 'Prayer For My Daughter.'
Cream?
Sugar?
Type 1?
Injections?
Recently?
Yes, I would ... 
... But I'm afraid I'll need a warrant. 
Excuse me. 
Greg! I need you to process these right away. Priority.
Or not.
The material we found in Rebecca McCormick's wound was nylon thread with fragments of ostrich feather.
I can take care of this myself.
I'd like to come in.
The, uh, submissive that was in here yesterday was wearing a feather boa.
Hmm. Same scent as Trey Buchman's crime scene. Remember the strawberry foam? Do these belong to Chloe?
I owe you an apology.
Thank you, Greg.
Look familiar?
Insulin was injected into Trey Buchman's shoulder at this end ... by you.
Your epithelials were found at the plunger end. Epithelials are skin cells filled with DNA - your genetic fingerprint.
So you started seeing each other outside of Lady Heather's?
Chloe thought that killing your wife's lovers would please you.
But she didn't obey you. She killed your wife. You couldn't make Chloe do what you wanted. All that time at Lady Heather's and you never learned that the submissive is the one in control?
Excuse us. Excuse me, sir. Thank You.
Yeah, it doesn't surprise me. You remember the MGM fire? We found people burned to their slot machines 'cause they wouldn't leave the action.
This guy's got a piece of wood sticking out of his head.
I once saw a guy walk fifteen blocks with three bullets in his face.
I don't much care where he was going. I want to know where he's been.
... and his wife.
Sharp force trauma.
I'm afraid if we try to remove it, we'll eradicate the prints.
I'm not going to get any prints off of this.
Yeah. I'm going to scrape his nails.
Hand me a bindle.
Yeah, only the wooden stake is in his head, not his heart.
Tamponading?
Yeah, but head trauma this severe, surgery would've probably killed him anyway.
I got scat.
Yep.
Yep.
No, Nick, it's not human. It's scat. Could be from a bat.
Bat 'guano'.
Is it sparkly?
Let me see.  I think it's quartz. Or fluorite.
All home to bats.
Not since Sam Braun ran the town.
A melting furnace.
Melting precious metals.
And the pawn tickets.
Topographical maps of the Sierra Nevada. Delamar Quadrangle, Lincoln County, La Madre Mountain ... Clark County.
Hey, Nick. Blood spatter and a bullet hole, maybe?
Except that our vic had a stake in his head. He wasn't shot.
We're looking for another body.
Dolomite, barite, calcite, antimony.
Do you have any idea how many mine shafts there are in the State of Nevada?
So, who was the last person he sold to?
Where is he now?
Where's the mine?
It's a bat gate. It keeps people out, lets the bats in.
Old mines are considered bat habitats and preserves.
Batman.
Insect chitin. It's usually found near the entrance of caves.
Guano. We got bats.
Probably California leaf-nosed bats.
They're like bees, Nick. You don't bother them, they won't bother you.
Are you seeing this? Gold.
I'm not so sure.
And these look like impact patterns.
But not with pellets.
You know, Lockwood said that James sold this parcel of land multiple times. I think he was running a scam.
Insect party.
Cockroaches, cave crickets. Carabid beetles. All heading deeper into the cave.
Maybe they got tired of eating bat guano.
Smells like trinitrotoluene.
Look familiar?
Fuse line. Dynamite.
Chest wound. Possibly from our .38. Just about two days old.
You know, wooden support beams, fuse line, TNT ... I think, uh, Alex James was trying to hide this body in the back of his mine.
Like most fuses, it probably burnt too quickly and he couldn't outrun the blast ... 
... Or the wooden stake.
Okay.  According to Greg, the blood on the bullet's a direct match to Joe McPherson. It's a done deal.
That figures.
Yup, and they all come to Vegas.
The car's dry. This must've happened right before the rain.
I think happy hour's over.
You and Catherine are running the evidence on this. Warrick just got done with Internal Affairs. He's on his way. 
You need to talk to the Restaurant Manager, too.
No.
I got gas.
Residential gas leak in Henderson.
We're cleared to go in?
Thanks. 
The gas company spikes its natural gas with mercaptan - smells like rotten eggs.
All's I smell is mothballs and stale tobacco.
Hello, David.
Makes our job easier.
No, but carbon monoxide's still gas.
Was Mr. Arnz in bed with her?
So why is she dead and he's alive?
I want to take a look at him.
Peter ... my name's Gil Grissom. I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
I'm very sorry about what happened to your mother.
Associated minerals?
Activated charcoal?
... and possibly a murder.
I just got a page from James Watson.
Nothing probative.
Mrs. Arnz was a smoker. Typically, a smoker's blood is already 10% saturated with C.O.
That still doesn't explain why one lived and one died.
Thanks, Greg.
Isaac Asimov-- one of my favorite writers. 'If knowledge can create problems, then it is not through ignorance that we will solve them.'
It's my job to figure out what happened to your mother.
... 'but that I have so much confidence in non-scientists being wrong.' You a scientist?
The, uh, prescription is in your name.
No. We're just telling you what we know.
I have one more question. When did you quit smoking? I noticed the, uh, nicotine patch on your arm.
You're not supposed to be in here.
Well, perhaps you didn't see the crime scene tape.
On the contrary. I heard you have an almost perfect 4.0 GPA. With the exception of a 'B' in English. Our detectives do complete background searches on all the principles at a crime scene. I understand you threatened your English teacher.
You might want to check your filter, too. You're out of charcoal.
In 1939, Isaac Asimov was an undergraduate studying zoology. As part of a course requirement, the students were asked to find a stray cat, kill it and dissect it. Isaac found his cat, he killed it, and then he promptly dropped out of zoology. Fifty years later, he wrote that the memory of killing that cat still haunted him.
Yeah, I do. Why didn't you fix the chimney damper in your parents' bedroom?
Nick, at what point is the saturation level of carbon monoxide in the bloodstream lethal?
Mmm. Well, his mother's level was in the range, but his father's level was low.
What about smoking?
Yeah, we didn't know he'd quit, either. The nicotine levels in his system were high but when we went to speak with him, he was wearing a nicotine patch.
You made a basic scientific mistake, Peter. You stopped observing the human element because you thought it was inferior.
I know why. They weren't going to let you go, were they?
Science isn't about the gratification, Peter. It's about the truth.
Yeah, whoa-ho.
Adipocere, a.k.a. Mortuary wax. This is what you get when fatty tissue decomposes in an alkaline environment with limited oxygen.
How do you know it's a he?
Signed, sealed and delivered.
It happens. When I was working in Minneapolis, we had two John Smiths come in on the same day. Sent the wrong one back to Canada. Anyway, our body's still in the morgue. David finally processed his ten card. Guy's name is Keith Mercer.
Eleven days ago. Found him in an alley off of Fremont in a pile of garbage next to the dumpster.
Initially, the police thought he was homeless. He hadn't bathed, no wallet, watch or keys, and he has scars on his lower legs.
Yeah, cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head.
Could have been a lot of things. 
Evidence without context is ambiguous at best.
Mrs. Mercer ... you have my attention. And I'd like to see your house.
It looks like someone was trying to clean up, too, but forgot to use their Murphy's oil soap. 
Luminol.
I may have blood here, too.
Did you touch or move this statue at any time in the last ten days?
Could you tell us what you kept in this box?
Yesterday?
Mr. Mercer's been in the morgue for ten days. So unless you were at a seance. 
Did you find that suit there as well?
With this credit card?
I wish these people would start checking IDs.
So, blood?
No blood on his clothing. 
The shoe treads don't match. And the guy's got no car.
And if you're robbing a house, why don't you take more stuff?
I think the killer knew what he was going to steal.
You ran it?
Are you a numismatist, Greg?
So, let's see, you surf, you scuba dive, you're into latex ... you like fashion models and Marilyn Manson. And you also have a coin collection. 
Well ... I raise cockroaches.
Does now.
There must be $50,000 worth of coins in there, isn't there, Greg?
You must have a record of the transaction.
Maybe it's in your car.
Trace amounts of sulfur. You don't artificially tone your coins, do you, Mr. Jones?
Well, you may have some authentic blood in your car as well.
Huh.
How's it look?
Keith Mercer made a bad call.
What happened to your enthusiasm, Greg?
Out there ... means a pay cut.
That's good to know.
This is the last art house left in Vegas. I saw Baraka here, on a double bill with Koyaanisqatsi.
Sure.
No.
Single puncture wound to the base of the skull.
They were watching the movie. Dark room. Loud music. Four exits. Everybody looking the other way.
... or a movie buff.
It was 'Out of the Past', with Robert Mitchum and Jane Greer.
Well, the killer could have stood over him, placed his hand over his mouth, stabbed him in the back of the head.
Anthony Quinn did it, too, in 'Guns of Navaronne'.
Small patterns; could have been a chain, maybe, huh?
Well, whoever called him didn't leave their number.
Is the gunfight loud?
Perfect moment to do it. Cover up any noise the victim might make.
Did she come back in?
Did anyone see her coming into the lobby?
They can do that now?
Ten-forty.
That sounds like a no answer.
Yeah, well, he was already dead by then.
That's when the gunfire erupted.
In the movie. I'll need an address for that number.
Audrey Hilden?
And why did you call him three times in a row, 40 minutes later?
Do you see a lot of movies at the art house theater?
I see they recently had a Hitchcock retrospective.
Jacqui, do you have anything for us?
Too consistent.  Looks like fine grain.
Well, a screwdriver's cheaper than an attorney.
Did you notice anything else?
Excuse me. Where'd you get those gloves?
I'll tell you what -- I'll buy you a new pair of gloves.
Well, Audrey called Dr. Sugarman's cell from her home at 11:26.
The mysterious redhead in the theater?
Hit woman.
Too convenient.
Catherine ... she's got a whole 'nother set of horizontal marks on her neck, below the cord. And postmortem bruising. I think she was strangled first and then hanged.
She was dragged. She's got carpet fibers on her heels.
When we were here earlier, there was a movie schedule pinned up there that had a handwritten note on it. I'm not sure she wanted me to see it. Now it's gone.
Well, maybe this will bring it up.
It's written above 'Strangers On A Train'
Two strangers meet on a train, make a pact to get rid of each other's problems. They figure since neither has a motive for the killings, they won't be caught.
In the movie, Robert Walker kills Farley Granger's wife. Granger didn't think he was serious, so when he refuses to kill walker's father, walker goes after him.
Who's playing Robert Walker's part?
It's not a hotel room, though.
... parking space, maybe.
Mr. Haines? 
It was open.
I'm with the crime lab. I'm a professional snoop. Do you, uh ... ever wear that wig en you go out?
Do you like the movies? I, uh, noticed you have an art house theater schedule on your mirror.
Ever seen 'Strangers On a Train'?
Yeah, it's good.  You use a lot of creams, huh?
Is that your own recipe?
I'm a scientist. 
No. I don't mind.
There's a lot of that going around.
Kelly Goodson?
You know, she had a business card in her locker -- Langly &amp; Langly, Attorneys-at-law. It'd be interesting to find out ... 
So, they liked the same movies ... they had the same problem ... and they hired the same lawyer?
The extension cord used to strangle Audrey Hilden. 
The dentist's gold chain. 
The murderer's gloves.
Only on the inside; not necessarily the outside. You use two hands to put on gloves.
Special recipe.
Or they could've met at the movie theater.
Boy, can't you see them watching 'Strangers On a Train' together?
I'm thinking that Audrey told her everything about her dentist, and she told Audrey everything about Haines.
After you stabbed Sugarman, you ripped the gold chain off of his neck as proof that you'd kept up your end of the bargain.
And then Audrey called Sugarman three times in a row to see if it was true.
But that's all she did, isn't it? 'Cause just like in the movie, she had no intention of killing Haines ... and that's when you started harassing her.
You couldn't let her betray you. So, unfortunately, she had to die, too.
So, you made it look like she'd committed suicide, and then you planted Sugarman's gold chain, in hopes that we would think that she killed him, too.
You're right. It's just a story ... 
... but the chemicals that we found on your gloves and on the extension cord that was used to kill Audrey, that's our proof. Menthol ... trolamine salicylate ... capsaicin ... 
... eucalyptabalm ... isorcreme ... capsaicin ointment -- a unique concoction -- your unique concoction ... ... and this stuff is all over the evidence. Yeah ... it's a pretty good movie. Well, the character that you've been playing, the character that Robert Walker played in the movie ... dies at the end.
Murder, seduction, deceit-- the usual.
Actually, I'm not a big fan of noir.
I like silent movies.
The extent of the coagulation suggests she died before that. Possibly before 1:00 am.
You said 'ladies.' Where's the other one?
Gone? That's an elastic term.
What do we know about Raymond?
And Mr. Haviland?
Clark Gable was a movie star.
Excuse me, fellas.
Mr. Haviland, my name's Gil Grissom. I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
What?
I need to ask you did you, by any chance, touch the victim after you found her?
You sure?
That's all you did?
Really? The other girl.
Hey, Warrick?
Would you mind if we took a look at your hands?
Palms down, please. 
You said you never touched the victim.
Sure, just like in the movies.
Forget about who's involved. We do this like we do any other case.
Witnesses place Tom Haviland at this table before and after the time of the murder.
Yeah, well, he's already admitting to sleeping with the victim so hair and fiber evidence won't mean anything.
I'm just going to supervise on this one.
Well, let's see. Hotel suite. Probably a weapon of opportunity. Corkscrew, maybe.
Is it all the way down to the larynx?
Tom Haviland claimed that this victim told him the name of her murderer before she died.
Okay, we got at least one murder charge on Haviland. I imagine we'll add another one. 
So, let's run Kim Hsu's murder. Haviland slashed her throat probably with a corkscrew.
Do we have the results on the blood from Haviland's hands?
Tom Haviland's attorneys are not waiving time.
No requests for continuances, no stall tactics. They're pushing for their day in court.
Get-out-of-jail-free card. One more thing: Wescott just added a forensic scientist to their roster. She wants him to examine every piece of evidence we have against Haviland.
They're entitled to see it as it's processed.
Well, when you can't attack the evidence itself, you attack the method of gathering the evidence.
Dr. Phillip Gerard.
Yeah. Marjorie Wescott's a smart lawyer.
He knows his blood's not on those sheets. They're trying to choke us with evidence.
The movie star.
Okay... so the flowing pattern is from the victim's neck wound. This other pattern, though...
No, no. Here-- the blood spatter.
She wouldn't have. I think her throat was slashed, to shut her up.
She was collateral damage. My guess ... these blood patterns mean that Tonya's dead.
And I bet she was the first to die. Rage killing.
Sudden hand-to-hand combat.
Sara, this is Dr. Gerard. Anything you say to him will be considered testimony.
Well, we already know the bra was moved. Sara filed a supplemental report to that effect.
Relationship?
Doc? Why don't you and I go to my office. We can talk there.
Catherine?
So relax. If any of us had failed the yearly proficiency test, we wouldn't be here.
Oh, right.
Is it working?
Yeah, that's it. Ecklie.
So give it to him.
Why?
Well, you have to find it; otherwise, it'll look like you've got something to hide.
CSI's always on trial, Warrick; you know this. Burden of proof is on us.
Nicky, wait a minute. Go back. Zoom in on the club bag. He's jammed a lot more clubs into that bag. Without those clubs, the hard-shell bag could be big enough to fit a body.
Very considerate of you to bring this golf bag in without insisting on a warrant.
Solvent. This bag's just been cleaned.
The luminol's cross-reacting with the bleach.
Nick ...
Nick! Go get a soda.
Hey. What happened to you? You were a pioneer in forensic science. How many bad guys did you put away in Hennepin County?
You look for mistakes in any lab you'll find them.
Humans are fallible.
No, no, no, no. You're subverting good evidence. These are good people. 
The Accused is entitled, yeah. He's a movie star, that's why he's entitled. He's killed two women. You know it. But you're willing to decimate these CSIs so that you can spoon-feed a jury into letting him walk.
The difference is, Philip, I get the same paycheck regardless of what I testify to.
What about the victims' families? Who's their friend? 
My guys will see you in court.
Are you whispering?
Well, he's not here, so stop it.
Blood's from a male?
That's what they want.
Tell him what? That we might have found a motive for the movie star?
Looks like uncontrollable rage to me.
Just say it, Nick.
Looks like that old Hollywood saying: 'Never get caught with a dead girl or a live boy.' So, let's see Tom's in bed with what he thinks are two girls. He reaches down on one, becomes very confused. 
Most guys would have just cleared the room and gargled with whiskey. But movie boy, who brags about doing his own stunts, couldn't take the thought of having a man in his bed so he freaked out.
Well, Nick is the Primary on this.
What'd you do, subpoena my doctor?
You've become a bottom feeder, Philip.
You know, all those years I worked for you, you never got to know me at all, did you?
What about the booking photos of Tom? Were you able to make comparisons off those?
This case is a moving target.
I'll get ahold of Brass.
You look nice.
Sara?
Whatever happens in court, it's not because you're seeing this guy.
You deserve to have a life.
Your guys didn't get any extended body photos?
I need lower extremities for comparison.
When, between testimony?
Don't get ahead of yourself.
Would you know where I could get pictures of Tom Haviland? Full body shots. Like, uh ... an internet site ... or his fan club?
Paparazzi; long lens.
I'm going to go to court.
No, it does not. 
This unique blood pattern which I'm highlighting and resizing for the court's clarification, was made by the defendant during the attack.
Could she repeat the question, your honor?
One more time, please.
On visual comparison.
The Accused has a distinct waffle-like scar characterized by diamond-shaped patterns on his left knee.
Yes, but it's unique to The Accused. He says he got it in a stunt on his last film. 
According to Mr. Haviland in his statement and I quote, 'It happened when I was rappelling down the Alps firing an AK-47 with my free hand.'
But he actually got it tripping on his way into the wardrobe trailer.
Your honor, it's a preliminary hearing. May I?
The production report by the Unit Production Manager on the film that day and I quote, 'Tom Haviland slipped on wardrobe trailer number thirty-eight, step number two. He sustained cuts to his knee and was bandaged by the company medic. The production was shut down for half a day.' The company medic documented it with Polaroid photos and I have managed to acquire step number two ... from trailer thirty-eight. 
I think these graphics will help explain my findings.
The Step.
The Scar.
The Sheet.
My Team did it, Philip. I got good CSI's.
Oh, and, uh, my mother says hello.
When was the last time a comedian died of natural causes?
He's awfully young for a heart attack.
Excuse me! Could someone turn down the house lights, and turn up the stage lights? Thank you.
I want to see what he saw ... right before he died.
Nothing.
A punchline?
Six bottles of Innoko water. Three partially filled, three unopened.
Laughter is an involuntary motor response triggered by survival issues: Food, s*x, body functions ... death.
C.O.D.?
Well, Dougie Max had more than comedy in his blood. Tox came back positive for coke.
All right, 'Alex'. What is: Snorting it, smoking it, or injecting it?
Continuing this childish metaphor ... what is: How did the drugs get into his system?
Cite your source.
That's why we did the tests. 
So what did?
The new migraine medication?
Consumables from the club that matched Dougie's stomach contents. We know that he had naratriptamine in his system, and we also know that the poison was ingested.
I'll take your word for it.
You've isolated the source of the poison?
What about the other bottles?
Okay. I need you to process that bottle for trace impurities.
We identify the source ... maybe we identify the killer.
To get a drink.
Modern version of the old hook.
Let's get back to the water. It was poisoned.
Mmm. The, uh, bottles you took out to the stage -- where'd they come from?
Do you get headaches?
We want all the Innoko water ... to go.
Warrick ... this just in. D.B. at a convenience store on Torrey Pines. You're all I got.
Naratriptamine.
No injection holes in the bottle from the Speedy Mart. Do you see anything?
Would you like to try one from the Comedy Hole?
I need to see the lot numbers of the bottles you pulled from the convenience store.
The tainted bottles didn't come from this lot.
Somebody may have just walked in and put it there, though. Where are the bottles from the comedy club?
These are a match.
Maybe the killer wanted us to think it was random product tampering.
Cover up one murder with another?
There were traces of caffeine with the naratriptamine.
Do you provide your comedians with or do they brew their own?
Doesn't the red light mean, 'Get off the stage?' 
So why were you giving Dougie Max the red light?
We're going to need a sample of everyone's DNA.
Still listening.
I like your coffee.
I know, the finest money can buy.
Okay, so you've identified the type of coffee.
Cat feces?
And leaves a unique chemical signature. 
Oh, I got it.  It just wasn't funny.
We're going to need to process everyone on that plane.
First witness, first suspect.
Of course.
USDA facility. Mandatory 48-hour quarantine.
Tranquilizer dart.
Mmm.
More than one way to handicap a horse.
We're going to need to pull some samples from that horse.
This looks recent. What happened here?
So you stitch her up until it's time to breed?
An opiate overdose?
Tranquilizer.
How do you shoot yourself in the shoulder with a tranquilizer rifle?
And framed the horse.
The tranquilizer gun looks like a wipe-down, and there's no prints on the ceiling dart.
Partial palm print. Not enough for comparison. But, there was three different matches on the handrail leading down to the cargo bay. A Harper Fitzgerald ... 
Jason Banks ... 
Rhone Confer. 
Formerly a Concierge at the Orpheus.
It is?
Cigar tobacco.
Then it's a Cuban cigar.
So if I'm looking for an illegally imported Cuban cigar, I go to ...
I found a suture scissors near Lori's body on the plane. Is it possible that she knew about the infection and tried to relieve it?
I believe we found our greater tragedy.
'A horse is dangerous at both ends, and uncomfortable in the middle.'
Ian Fleming.
I read the novels when I was a kid.
You have any idea what caused the infection?
I thought the stitches were used to prevent the invasion of foreign bodies.
Uncut diamonds?  The horse is a 'mule'.
According to his receptionist, Dr. Stevens ... left town ... unexpectedly.
Supposedly used to keep the diamonds from chipping.
Mmm. 
A horse's uterus is the size of a football, so he could've packed it with pouches of diamonds.
He took what he could reach.
But he wasn't on that plane, so he couldn't have killed the girl.
Did you know that the term 'carat' comes from the Mediterranean Carob Tree, whose seeds were used for centuries as a standard of measurement?
Five?
Well, it's not 100% accurate, but, uh ... based on shape, color characteristics, wavelength absorptions of the regional impurities ... it says that these diamonds come from Central Africa.
Yeah. Bought for pennies on the dollar, and banned by the U.N.
That, and a half a million dollars worth of luxury tax. No customs, no tax.
So we've got the how and the why.  We just need the who.
We got animal, mineral, and now vegetable.
I ran the trace on the remainder of the diamonds. Lentils and carrots.
I'm thinking Lori packed the diamonds.
She was the only one who got close to that horse.
And Lori was the only one who knew there was five packages, which would explain why Stevens left one behind.
Well, diamonds are worthless unless you have a buyer.
Flight Steward's story checks out. Lori Hutchins had an ante-mortem gash on her right forearm.
What about Harper? It was her plane, Meredith's horse. She didn't care what happened to the horse.
What's his mother got to do with it?
Tantalus. Stuck in hell, forever staring at the fruit just out of reach.
Did she care more about the horse than she did the diamonds?
Would you mind taking off your shirt?
Evidence of a struggle. Oh, and there it is.
High-powered pneumatic guns don't need to be loaded to leave a mark.
'A horse, a horse, my kingdom for a horse.'
She definitely died here.
Defensive wounds on her hands.
She's not wearing any underwear.
David, I thought you said she wasn't moved.
There's still sweat on her upper lip.  Take a liver temperature.
Now, David.
The killer's still on her.
Yes, we are.
Nothing usable around the neck.
Very few sweat glands around the ankle. Prints survive longer. 
Fortunately for us.
Fingertip bruises and fingernail scratches.
No ligature marks.
Killer strangled her with his right hand. One hand only.
He must have been looking right in her eyes.
What about the SART kit?
Bruises on her hands, her arms, upper torso -- it's consistent with rape.
May have started as s*x, but it ended as murder.
You should be telling Nick or Sara.
Good work.
Now go tell Nick or Sara.
You could end up with over 100 hits.
You still have to check each one by hand.
Looks like you bit your lip. May I see your hands, please?
How'd you do with the nail clippers?
That only proves that they had s*x. The nail clippers can place Jason Kent at the murder scene. His nails, her DNA, traces of the booth, et cetera.
Holy trinity, Greg. I need that.
So?
Thank you.
Are you okay?
Honey, this doesn't look good.
You need to get stitches.
Would you take care of her hand, please?
We have lims backup for every computer on the network. I'm sure we've only lost an hour or two of data.
We got a conviction on that.
And who's to blame? I'm going to have Catherine run the investigation. I'm on a murder case.
Alison Carpenter.
A murderer, his groupie and a heroin dealer, what a team.
Does Western Nevada correctional use surveillance cameras in their visitation room?
It's medium security.
Run that again. Can you enhance that?
Well, if you can't kill the one you want ... kill the one you're with.
Did our lab examine the physical evidence?
Linen? In a prison?
So how did Jason Kent get the heroin?
So what are we saying? Jesus sells Jason Kent heroin. Kent falls into debt, and pays him off with Alison Carpenter?
One point of commonality?
So it's not his print?
Miguel Durado. Mickey D. Las Culebras.
Jesus Cardenas is in the same game. Mickey D. Could be the guy who's getting the heroin into the prison.
I'm not sure how, but I may see a potential why.
Could be Mickey D. is collecting Jason Kent's debt.
Jason Kent was suitable for framing.
Grissom.
Okay, thank you.
Unlogged evidence gets placed under the fume hood. A hot plate was left on. It's a lab. It's nobody's fault.
One report. The Jenkins case. She made a miscalculation. I've asked her to reissue the report.
Robert. If you have something to say to me, say it to my face.
Without the people, there is no lab.
We know that you had s*x with Alison Carpenter that night. Most probably in her car.
Would you place your hand -- your right hand -- on this paper, please? Extend the fingers outward.
Mickey D ... has a hand span of 19 centimeters. The hand that strangled Alison Carpenter ... has a span of 22 centimeters.
And your hand ...
... 22 centimeters.
It's all we got that links him to the murder. Everything else blew up in the lab.
Yep.
I was just leaving.
I am.
You should be on paid leave.
You were fortunate. And I'm not talking about the explosion.
And Nick.
Is that all you have to say?
No.
Sara ...
I don't know what to do about this.
Beveled edges on the inside. The shot came from outside. We need to get a picture of this.
What were they interested in?
See the blast marks? Charges were placed in corner quadrants. Four boxes up, five across. The rest looks like collateral damage.
Well, the one good thing about their precision ... it'll narrow our focus.
Sorry. I was thinking.
Right. I'll take the safety deposit boxes. Sara, you're with me.
Electric blasting cap.
Means they could've used C-4.
Utah, New Mexico, Colorado, and Arizona.
What does that tell us?
The Monroe Effect: All force generated towards one central area.
I just found the detonator.
Blackface paint.
You didn't have to bring this over. We could've picked it up.
Thanks, doctor.
We got a bullet.
Occupation: Valet at the rampart. Isn't that one of Sam Braun's hotels?
You have to have a non-gaming work card to park cars at a Vegas casino. How does a guy with a criminal record get one?
Unless he was juiced in by Sam Braun.
Yeah? Well, it's our case, so it's our call.
Check it out.
You'll be fine.
Long gun.
Impossible to trace, so it's a dead end.
The military.
And we still don't know what was inside.
In days, months, or years?
You know him?
You wouldn't happen to know what he kept inside his safe deposit box, would you?
Albert, got a minute?
I'd like a second opinion.
I hoped it would go away.
Yeah. It's hereditary. I know. I wasn't rational.
I think we're giving these guys too much credit. They're experts at robbing banks, not experts at concealing evidence.
Do you ever wonder how the fortune gets inside the cookie?
That's the answer.
Run him through the military database.
One of the black coats, you think?
Fire-resistant.
Out of context, I don't know.
Well, Clouseau, how does blood get in a safe deposit box?
Old-time Vegas. We found Tommy 'the aspirin' out here. Remember him? Used to make his boss' headaches disappear.
High-powered rifle. Close range. Visible gunpowder.
This guy got it in the chest, too.
And this one took it in the back.
They didn't fly here. Where's their car?
Look familiar?
The guy who's rapidly becoming a mass murderer.
Slow down, Bobby.
You rang?
Multiple puncture wounds, different depths, possibly two knives ...
Greg, your hands are shaking.
Hold your hands out.
Is it affecting your work?
It'll stop. If you need me, I'll be around.
I need you to open this evidence bag and cut me an identical piece of fabric.
Yeah.
Warrick, hand me those scissors. 
Nick, give me that apple.
Give me the apple. You're not supposed to eat in here.
Two puncture wounds, right?
Scissors. That's what was wrapped in the scarf.
Murder.
We may have the murder weapon.
Warrick, enhance the blade area.
R-p-r-T.
I'm not going with you.
I'm scheduled for surgery at Desert Palm.
Yep.
I'm not. Has to be done.
Nothing. I'm fine. Take care of the case.
That's it. Um ...  ... good luck.
What are you doing here?
Thank you ... for being here.
I don't need that.
Gunshot, right temple. Women don't shoot themselves in the head, do they, Catherine?
Is the husband around?
The Newmans have kids?
We're missing something.
You're not. It's a crime scene. 
Erythrosine. 
Red dye number three. 
Doesn't mean someone wasn't out here. Grab the ALS.
I paged you two hours ago. SARA: Right. Uh, it's my day off. I was up in Pahrump at some vineyard. You told me to get a life, remember?
Did I? 
I'm sorry, but I needed you. Dispatch called in a 419 at Tuscadero High School. You're on your own.
Solo.
Process.
Now we just need to figure out if one of them was Mr. Newman.
Did someone check this pool?
Does that pool look clear to you?
One of you guys is going in.
No skin separation. Minimal gaseous buildup. This guy's been in here under 12 hours. 
It's an anti-vortex filter.
It's designed to keep his hand out of that pipe. But it's missing a few screws.
We found his right hand caught in a pool filter.
Any significance to the marks on his chest?
Or he could have been beaten.
How about the new wife?
You always tell me that.
She didn't shoot herself. 
She had help.
Anything from the pool?
Anything from his head wound?
Mildew.
Aureobasidium pullulans. One of the very few fungi that can withstand the desert temperature.
Exactly. And here's the basic chemistry of the transfer.
Add sugar water spoiled from the heat, ...
... mix in some human biofilm you got yourself an all-you-can-eat mildew buffet.
Cal Newman wore size tens. So assuming our killer wore the size twelve ...
Genetics only gives you one from each parent.
What about stutter?
Minor donor?
Major donor?
Yeah, we did. So, let's get Greg to compare the reference sample and see if we found our major donor.
So, how does a kid who can't swim drown his father?
: And his body at the bottom of the pool with abrasions on his chest.
With someone who can swim.
Tooth hurt?
You might, uh, need your filling which we found at the bottom of the Newmans' pool.
Or caveat venditor. Let the seller beware. Your prints came back military. Navy seal.
Berglund. That's a Scandinavian name, isn't it?
Greg.
I need you to take off your shoes and socks.
Your mother's maiden name is Hojem, correct? Hojem is Norwegian?
That's true. Right foot first, please.
Left foot.
Put these on. Come see me in six hours.
You had a reaction.
Your right foot, I swabbed with a placebo, regular tap water.
Left foot ... eumycotic dermatitis.
It's a mildew-induced skin rash.
Here. Hydrocortisone. Follow the directions, clear it right up.
It's called aureobasidium pullulans.
This is a warrant.
Yes, both of them. Take off your shoes and socks, please. 
Aureobasidium pullulans is a mildew. We found it around the Newmans' pool. It induces rashes in people of Scandinavian descent -- and it does so in a predictable progression which provides us with a valuable timeline.
You have the rash.
And size 12 feet.
Let me tell you how you did this.
... and then you went upstairs.
You ever been to the theater, Peter? There's a play called Six Degrees of Separation. It's about how all the people in the world are connected to each other by no more than six people. All it takes to connect you to the victims is one degree.
Good night, Sara.
Hey. Nice work on the high school case.
Little People Convention. Every year they come from all over the world to a designated city. Socialize, network. It's their Prom, Olympics, and New Year's Eve all rolled into one.
I get the newsletter.
Suicide?
Being a dwarf doesn't mean you're disabled, Nick. It means you're ... short. 
I think we've got a little murder.
Wait, David. Got a hair in the knot.
I want to preserve this as is, so cut higher.
These scars are old. Tell me this wasn't bone-lengthening surgery. ROBBINS: Probably done when he was a teenager. Surgical pins are inserted into the bone ... 
What people will endure to be normal. 
Hmm.
Hanging?
What is that, blunt force?
He was paralyzed?
So it's possible that whoever did this knew something about dwarf anatomy.
I was admiring your reaching tool.
Hey, if the world doesn't adapt itself to you, you have to adapt yourself to it, right?
Excuse me. Did Lawrence have any problems in those areas?
Excuse me.
Isn't this, uh, Lawrence Ames's room?
Who are you?
Would you please sit down here? We want to keep the contamination to a minimum.
Didn't the police tell you not to come in here?
And, um... these are Lawrence's things?
Sara?
So the strike was made coming down.
Well, right now, we believe the evidence.
Is the lipstick on this champagne glass yours?
I need these hairs.
Doesn't matter.
Well, she can go wherever she wants to. She didn't do it. Take a look. Hair from the knot.
Diameter's 60% less than normal. Tensile strength is also way below normal.
Mm-hmm.
Cartilage Hair Hypoplasia. C.H.H. It's characterized by fine, brittle body hair. It's an extremely rare syndrome. It's a form of Dwarfism.
Nick ... 'Dwarfs' or 'Little People'.
You'll need to know what to look for. So, I'll put together a list of C.H.H. Attributes.
Ms. Grace?  I need your help. MELANIE GRACE: What now? My DNA? GRISSOM: No, actually ... your eyes. CUT TO:
Well, according to the police, there's none named Danielle registered at the hotel or at the convention.
But you went back. MELANIE GRACE: Eventually. I guess I realized it's nice to see eye-to-eye with someone.
Mm. MELANIE GRACE: I get the impression that's a little tough for you. 'The freaks have looked at her in a secret way and tried to connect their eyes with hers as though to say, we know who you are. We are you.'' 
Faulkner.
I think we look for the differences in each other to prove that we're not alone.
Well, mine's genetic, progressive and impossible to predict.
This explains why nobody ever saw her. She only exists in pixels. Nat King Cole.
Archie would you separate the composite elements, please?
Now if you could, pull up a photo of the victim, gray scale. There's a theory in art that the Mona Lisa was really a feminized version of Leonardo Da Vinci himself. 
Yeah. What attracts us the most is ourselves.
It was at that time he began receiving messages from ... a perfect woman ... 
...who doesn't really exist.
The two donors are related?
Grissom.
Rope for makeshift banisters, huh? 
So what do you, buy from wholesalers and then repackage in your home? KEVIN MARCUS: Yeah, Chicago. BRASS: Well, that explains how your daughter's skin cells got all over the rope that hung Lawrence Ames. GRISSOM: Your daughter's name is Jessica, right? 
Mr. Marcus, in your business you deal with proportions, correct? You provide Little People with what they need to compensate for their proportions and to live with them. You know what Little People aspire to be. Your, uh, logo is interesting.
Da Vinci's 'Vitruvian Man.' In the perfect human form, arm span equals height. You're very aware of what, uh people are looking for in a mate aren't you?
So your wife is also a dwarf.
Not yet. The rope was anchored to the lighting truss which was at least five feet over his head.
He can barely lift his arms above his shoulders. He suffers from Lumbar Lordosis Swayback ... which is typical of C.H.H. And it limits his mobility even more.
Yeah, but how did he hang him?
Our lab retrieved a final instant message to Lawrence from Danielle. 
It's genetics.
You know what's really sad? This wasn't just a murder. It was a hate crime. 
Kevin Marcus hated himself.
No. See you around.
Was she supposed to ... reappear?
Well, I can understand why he doesn't want to reveal his trick ... but would he like to explain this blood?
Magic is fun, Jim, but it's not real. The woman is somewhere.
Dull as a spoon. 
That's the point. So is it real blood?
That's the conflict of magic -- the burden of knowledge versus the mystique of wonder. 
Well, there are no secrets, are there? Only hidden answers.
Well, my livelihood is dispelling lies and finding the truth.
Yeah ... but there's a woman missing.
Very nice. So, where'd she go?
Is this processed yet?
Who controls this stage, do we know?
And you are ... ?
Well, Mr. Dillinger do you know how this trick works?
Good. Make me disappear.
Still here.
Is there any other way out of here besides that door?
You have any lights in here besides red? We're looking for blood.
No. Turn them off. 
Magicians of Zephyr's caliber belong to a very secluded society. They barnstorm from city to city ... no contact with the outside world, no association with other magicians. They're like ghosts with skin.
This looks like an admixture of blood and some sort of clear liquid.
There are no secrets.
Thorazine.
Maybe he didn't use it on animals.
Whoa. Go back one, Arch.
Blue dress, red hair.
Go on.
Who?
What makes him a 'freak' besides that shirt?
Well, miraculously, you've resurrected. Have you ever been to the Zephyr show?
I know. But we caught you alive.
The, uh, woman who disappeared -- do you think she was a plant?
Is it possible that he put his saber into the wrong slot?
I bet this house was here first.
Las Vegas Crime Lab.
What?
Take a look at this.
Designed by Zoe Clein.
What's he doing there? And who's that baby in his arms?
Warrick, come here.
A male IO moth. One of the largest in North America.
I don't know. It feeds on trees and foliage. 
See the eye-like spots on the back of its wings? 
It's an illusion to confuse predators. Birds get fooled into thinking it's an owl. I have a similar one in my office.
What are you doing here?
So you know Zoe Clein.
Was she a plant the night she disappeared?
Really? New trick.
With a metal stake.
The human body protecting its prints.
Better run his dental records, then, huh?
COD?
Unusual, though.
In the lining. I've never seen this before.
I knew that Houdini could swallow and regurgitate keys on cue, but I've never heard of skin pockets.
Warrick. I need you to find out everything you can about Zephyr and his crew. Sara, check web sites. Concentrate on Punky. I've got a hunch about these guys. 
Coroner. I need a piece of the Zephyr.
He fooled us. It was Punky burning in that box. Zephyr murdered his son.
They pulled a switch.
See this coin?
Two heads as one. One and the same. Zephyr and his son are interchangeable in physical appearance like the IO moth. You know what that means? 
So, if you're a master of deception where do you hide? 
Or do you?
I think this room is shrinking.
You made her disappear.
We know that you switched with your son, Punky to set up Toby Arcane for your murder. That trick didn't work so well, did it?
'Abracadabra'. That's a cabalistic charm said to be made up from three Hebrew words meaning, father, son and the holy spirit. You're the father who took his son's life ... so that you could disappear and become the holy spirit?
Your son aspired to be a great magician, didn't he?
You're about to be arrested for his murder.
No. Magicians shouldn't reveal their tricks.
Officer? 
Officer, wait a minute. Turn him around, please. 
Open your mouth, please.
Yeah.
Not really.
Three dead co-eds?
Dumped in garbage bags. 
When are you going to get the test back?
Is this your first one?
Two. 
So, how do you feel about it?
Non-responsive.
It's just about evidence. It's not up to you whether he lives or dies. 
Case has no face.
Did he have anything to say about his daughter?
Ooh ... alcoholic.
Yeah.
Hey.
Don't insult the pigs, Nick. They're actually very clean.
And this would be the girl's room.
Dead bolts on her bedroom door.
Hmm.
A bedroom refrigerator?
There's milk, fruit ... a toaster?
Nick?
Trained in the art of self-defense.
Looks like somebody's been doing some digging.
Great. Drunks with guns.
M11-9. Empty box.
Up to 14 rounds expended and unaccounted for.
I think it's time for dear old dad to go to detox.
What's your depth estimate?
Oh, dear. Shovels and screens, chutes and ladders.
Weak.
So Debbie Reston never showed up at work and she's not buried in the backyard. Where did Debbie go?
Blood on the towel?
So what? Innocuous injury?
Brass just put a broadcast out on her car.
Sorry I'm late. So, where are we?
So technically she was a Western LVU student.
Is that before or after she got the paint on her hands?
It's still wet.
What kind of paint doesn't dry in 12 hours, I wonder.
We found glass in the lacerations on her right hand.
We just learned something we didn't know about the prior murders.
And if we just learned about it now, how did the copycat killer know?
Well, maybe he was waiting till he saw the girl he wanted.
What are you doing? 
Hmm, what does it sound like?  With the exception of the termite queen, the cicada is the longest-living insect. Spends seventeen years dormant underground and then the cicada nymph emerges and sheds its skin. 
As adults they flit around for about five weeks of activity in the hot sun and then they die. 
Not unlike death row.
Well, and if she was trying to clean off her right hand in this fountain she would have had to be in this position.
Well, lightbulb glass isn't polarized. Eyeglasses are.
You know, she was a black belt. Maybe she fought back.
Good. The paint on Debbie Reston's hands ... 
...Oil-based blue.
Not only that, it was mixed with 30-weight motor oil. Which isn't a component of any commercial paint. As an additive however ... keeps paint from drying.
Hello? Hairs. Hopefully from his paintbrush.
He knows a lot about paint.
Are any of these brushes made with badger hair?
In the oil paint sample we collected we found both badger hair and nylon bristles.
Sorry. I was admiring your frames. Nice.
So Janet Kent's killer saved some of her hair and planted it on Debbie Reston fifteen years later on the night that John Mathers was set to be executed.
Yeah. And the original killer's still out there playing a really twisted game.
Is that a good idea?
Why?
All the paints match all the victims except for Charlene Roth. See, being capable of matching paint samples that are fifteen years apart that's why I keep doing this work.
Where is he now?
Why wouldn't he take his business to some other college if it was only about young girls?
True of insects as well. You know why?
And where they can blend in the best.
This guy had ties to Western LVU. He paints a railing on a campus walkway. I tried it; took me about five minutes.
Probably because there wasn't much to see. 
He must've looked as though he belonged. 
Like the insects, he blended in.
I guess.
Yeah. And all we've got is a partial fingerprint and an M.O. that may lead us in the right direction.
I don't believe in luck. My only real purpose is to be smarter than the bad guys to find the evidence that they didn't know they left behind and make sense of it all. Makes me very uncomfortable to realize that this guy may be smarter than me.
One loss. Boxers have died in the ring before. Why is this one a crime?
That's a felony. And if death occurs during commission of a felony, that's a murder.
Isolated incident or they having a war?
Witnesses?
Aren't they always?
How many guys?
Well, you and I have got a dead boxer. Nick, you're going to get to run this solo.
Yeah. We're tapped out. Welcome to fight night.
Well, evidently, Molina hammered back tonight.
Did you notice anything out of the ordinary about either fighter? Slowed reactions, unusual strength?
These photographs are from...?
What, does he use them for motivation?
Well, according to your poster, this fight was about revenge.
These Mr. Molina's?
From tonight's fight?
Right now, they're evidence, so they belong to me.
It's still two skulls and four fists. It hasn't come that far.
What appears to be a unique metal: Mercury.
Amongst other things.
Only on cable.
Or how much damage a human body can sustain. A heavyweight can land a punch at a thousand pounds per square inch.
Like a short circuit. Too many short circuits and the brain shuts down.
And hence, a knockout.
This, uh, bruising under the chin seems heavy.
It's called an uppercut.
I'm not, really. My first year as a criminalist, I thought boxing would be a good place to observe live blood spatter. So, I went to a couple of bouts. There wasn't much spatter. Some interesting bruise formations, though.
Yeah. Not in this case.
Preliminary tox?
Sufentanil? A sedative?
So, if the fighter won't take a dive ... help him take a dive.
Greg, the residue on the gloves, what is it?
Sweat.
Oh, but wait.  In this corner fighting way out of his weight class coming from ... that place that textiles come from a cotton swab soaked in sufentanil.
Time to talk to the cut man.
Did you get anywhere with that mercury?
And Molina has it?
It's not the eating that will get you. The poison's in the mercury vapor. It's toxic.
Greg's working on it.
Did you get a hold of that cut man?
Doesn't make sense. If the cut man did it why would he hold on to the evidence?
And I thought Don King was bad.
Nice work on that jewelry heist.
You got the guy.
Being efficient is not a bad thing, Nick.
You wanted to work solo.
Pifflings?
Animal Planet.
I don't know. Look, the next night of the pifflings you get the first dead body.
Which couldn't be caused by normal boxing gloves.
We're missing something.
Greg, why are you always doing this?
Hmm ... and more mercury.
He's a sloppy eater.
Mercury's volatile. It emits a toxic vapor at room temperature.
I guess clothes do make 'The Man.'
And when you asked him what he was wearing the night of the murder, he couldn't remember?
Calvin and Ralph?
Oh. Well, for most CSIs, fashion is irrelevant.
Well, what's standing between you and this Tiny Tim character?
You making a classical reference?
Question is, if Molina was using mercury to load up how'd it get into his gloves?
Well, mercury's incredibly dense. 
It could easily be contained in the leather in the form of a boxing glove.
I smell an experiment.
And mercury kills Steele.
It's not fake blood. It's human. That was a murder ... on 16 millimeter.
Has this pornographer sent you film to be developed in the past?
We'll be taking those with us as well.
Grissom.
I'm already on a case.
They're fire ants, Brass. Keep everyone away from the colony. They're evidence.
No bug spray!
Well, any species that finds itself in a place it doesn't belong can do this kind of damage. What are you using?
That'll help.
Well, with enough colonies they can kill people.
Well, only if they also learned how to put him in a box and dump him in a ditch.
Ant hill. They're using this body as a colony site. I'm going to have to take this box and the specimen back to the lab as is. These insects are evidence.
Yeah? I put them on my eggs.
Ecozone pyrethrum. Toxic to ants, fleas, roaches and silverfish.
I view them as martyrs in a scientist's holy war.
Timeline for death?
It smells more like two.
What are these?
Stab wounds?
What, two feet apart? More like 18 inches. 
A pupa case.
It's a good thing. If I can postdate the pupa I can establish an entomological timeline.
Slow day in DNA, Greg?
Very good. Go right ahead.
Week zero: Body dies. Week two: Green blowflies arrive ... and leave their pupal casings.
Week four: Black soldier flies move in. At Week 28 ... they leave their pupa casings.
Now, the presence of winged reproductive fire ants suggests that their colony was in existence for at least a year.
Now, since we found no more pupa casings after the black soldier flies left at week 28, we know that this is when the fire ants must've first arrived.
So, calculating the gestation period between ants and flies, we get...
Very good. It's an approximation, but it's a start.
Well, I had to, Teri. I heard you were married. Hopefully not to a criminalist.
Well, congratulations.
I have someone I'd like you to introduce me to.
What, did I miss something?
It's a dung beetle.
The ants ate everything but the exoskeleton.
So he was probably murdered near some large animals. Maybe a farm or a zoo. Anyway, as to who ... I'll leave that up to you.
What did trace say?
Carbon steel? 19th century. Mostly used for surgical instruments.
This prong-like extension could be part of a repeating pattern.
That would give us possibilities.
Keep doing the math, maybe we won't have to guess.
This doesn't seem sharp enough for a saw.
What's that old cowboy expression? Got to see a man about a horse.
That reminds me. I've got to see a woman about a face.
Tissue depth markers. Twenty-one of them, right?
Like I said ...
The ears seem slightly odd.
Down's syndrome.
I guess my ants were off a little. 
'Last employer: Las Vegas Ranch.'  Dung beetles.
Nope, just roller coaster
Did he ever ride horses for you, Mr. Banson?
Well, somebody on your ranch is stuck in the '70s. Do you have any idea who this spur could belong to?
Yeah. And it might be his.
Mr. Banson, is this Billy Rattison's truck?
We need to speak with him.
He wasn't a 'retard,' Mr. Rattison. He had what we call Down's syndrome.
The, uh, toolbox in your truck, is that new?
Nick, where did you acquire this photo?
That is you.
Do you remember where this was taken?
What month, exactly?
We need a more precise timeline.
On to the rust.
We sliced the shard into layers of one hundred microns to measure the level of oxidation. Moisture from the body hits the carbon steel and then corrosion begins.
And we can be certain that there was moisture right away.
... and measuring it. The rust penetrated the thirteenth layer and just barely in the fourteenth. Archie, run the weather.
So, corrosion versus time ... 
And we can testify to this.
Yeah, so was Rattison. He was in town.
We have reason to believe the wounds that killed Randy Traschel were made by one of your bulls.
Yeah. We need to see your other bulls.
Could you tell us what used to be here?
You do get a lot of stuff stolen, don't you? Mind if we look around your truck?
Got a tape measure?
Phenolphthalein.
Looks like the only thing stolen around here was Randy Traschel's life.
Mr. Rattison, want to explain this?
By the way, the definition of the word 'retard' is 'to hinder' or 'to hold someone back.' I think your life is about to become 'retarded'.
I have no idea. I was actually on a date.
My god, what am I looking at?
His insides are on the outside. Did you move this body, David?
Have you ever seen anything like this?
Well, how many hit-and-runs have you pulled?
How many times have you seen the victim's viscera exposed?
There's a first time for everything.
But in reality? 
Fiction is often more compelling.BRASS: We got the eyewitnesses lined up, ready to go.
Testimonials, Jim? I don't consider that evidence.
Keep them all together, David.
I don't want your autograph, but I would like a photo and a bit of your DNA.
Say, 'cheese.'
Open up, please. Thank you.
Do you have his clothes?
That's good. That'll help.
Did he say anything else?
Gene Rayburn.
Point of reference.
Greg, this is your DNA lab. You are the master. We serve you.
Individual DNA from a mob attack on a cabbie ... and the cabbie's clothes.
Okay, Doc, tell me something I don't know.
About the body.
So, no fractures, no bruising. Cause of death?
So he wasn't hit by the taxi; he was run over?
So how much time elapsed between when he was stabbed and when he encountered the taxi?
Well, I'm sorry, but everyone seems to have something to do today. I have a teenager who was run over by a taxi. He wasn't hit by it; that's not what killed him. He was stabbed, fatally. For now, I have no ID, no suspects and no primary crime scene. I need you.
Want to go for a walk?
Okay. So, where do we pick up the trail?
He crossed Lake Mead Boulevard at 8:15 and it gets dark at 5:00. 
And I don't see any lights.
So, maybe the killer tossed the knife. It's a big dump site.
You got the gloves on.
What is happening to our parks?
Officer ... 
Well they're related by geography ... but for now it's just a dead guy in the park.
Take a look at this.
I think maybe someone palmed the cylinder gap.
Burnt skin is useless for DNA.
17%?
I don't need one. I have you.  Swab the pistol grip; get it to DNA.
Albert, did you notice if Todd Branson had any burn marks on his palms?
What about this guy?
A specific injury.
An incised wound. Well, that's a common injury sustained by knife-wielding killers. 
So assuming that this is the man who stabbed Todd Branson, what killed this guy?
You reach in and pull it out.
Maybe a frangible bullet designed to fragment on impact?
Did he have a dislocated shoulder?
It happened postmortem?
Emerson once said 'The mob is man voluntarily descending to the nature of the beast.' The beast is up for murder.
Is that the frangible?
Oh, serendipity.
Ms. Branson we also found a dead body in the park -- a white male in his mid-30s.
We have no ID, but we have a photograph.
Where have you been?
Drag marks?
So you're thinking someone else was there? Now, the revolver was registered to the boy's biological father but they haven't seen each other in ten years.
Well, maybe dad gave it to him behind mom's back.
True. Presence of GSR only places Todd in the vicinity of the gunfire.
Which brings us back to dad.
May I see your hands, please?
Can you hold him?
For now.
What do you weigh?
Do I have to get a scale?
Warrick, would you lie down on the floor?
Please?
Sara, grab Warrick's right arm. See if you can drag him across the room.
You don't trust me?
Stay there a minute.
Excuse me. Hi.  Judy, would you like to be part of a little experiment?
You'll keep your shoes on, I promise.
No. Spin around. Judy, would you take Warrick by the right arm and try and drag him across the room?
Thank you, Judy. You've been a big help.
You can go back to the water cooler.
Stewart Bradley had a dislocated shoulder postmortem. He's about the same weight as you. How does your shoulder feel?
Especially if he was dragged by somebody with limited upper body strength.
Well, maybe Jan Branson. She's about Judy's size.
He stabbed her son.
I don't know. But mothers protect their children, don't they?
... so perhaps the evidence is in Mrs. Branson's hands.
Ms. Branson, may I see your hands?
Could be important. Palms up, please.
Hi, pal.
May I see your hands, please?
Palms up.
Eric ... I need to know how you burned your hand. 
We recovered a gun ... in the park. Your burn indicates that your hand was over this gap when the gun was fired.
We found gunshot residue on Todd's jacket. We assumed that Todd fired the gun. But I think maybe he was standing next to you when you fired the gun. You didn't go to the park to stop Todd, did you? He went to the park to stop you.
Where we at, Greg?
I was busy.
All I see is a sheet.
Very nice presentation, Greg. What about the others? They all participated. They even bragged about it.
The mob mentality ... relieves individuals from having to distinguish between right and wrong. 
Yeah, six of them, to be exact. 
Unfortunately, physical evidence is limited by human action.
Yeah, well ... this is as far as we can take it. It's up to you guys.
Her throat's been slit by what appears to have been a very sharp implement. 
The room is completely stripped. No bedding, no sheets. 
Alice Dominguez. 
She wasn't robbed.
Wedding ring. Where's the husband?
I think your cell phone's vibrating.
Mm-hmm.
Huh?
Yeah, usually when someone gets their throat cut, it's from behind.
I think whoever did this was sitting in that chair.
One print on the knife. One print on the exit door. Both belonging to the husband. But we have two victims.
So it's possible the husband killed the wife. Who killed the husband?
The other couple?
Lie about what?
I don't know how fighting works for your marriage, but it probably saved your lives.
Well, if it's our serials, they've downgraded.
Where's her husband?
False alarm. Apparently, the guy just drove in from Fresno. Fell asleep in his car, and didn't even check in yet. So ...
This one's different.  Something's not right.
Okay, be careful, David. The body's frozen, and it's in full rigor. You're going to have to tilt it.
Yeah. Downward 90-degree angle, then up, tilt, and out.
Put him back down carefully.
There. Now try.
We have to do this quickly. It's 120 degrees outside, and our crime scene is melting.
Hold on a second. I got something. 
Would you like to bag this for me, Warrick? My hands are little numb.
Sara?
Would you take a sample of this blood for me?
Warrick, help her process this. Nick?
Come with me.
Shut the door, Nick.
No. I want to see the room the way they left it.
We're still going to look.
Not in person, no.
Good for us. Given the killer's appetite for sexual persuasion, maybe they blew the circuit. Overloaded it with coins.
I think so.
What do you think, Nick?
I need 15 minutes to think.
So they lure their victims with the promise of s*x.
And then they get them to the room. And they say, 'just kidding. We don't want s*x. We want your life.'
Which still doesn't explain how they get the husband to kill his wife.
They had a gun to his head.
Maybe he was hoping to save his wife from something worse.
Rape, torture, then murder.
Why did he stick him in the ice machine?
So he had to improvise.
Well, knowing now there was an odd mixture of blood, it's safe to say that someone cut themselves.
Assume nothing, Nick.
There they are.
No. His feet, actually.
Shiny.
How much do you love your wife?
Shakespeare?
'... admit impediments love is not love ...
One of the sonnets. Love is conditional.
But not for you.
Okay, here we go. We've got a husband and wife serial team killing couples. So, let's see where we're at starting with the first double murder. Sara?
I found some on Mr. Klinefeld's shoes, so it's possible the Klinefeld's picked up their first couple at Shimmer.
What about prints on the ice machine knife?
DNA, if given a warrant, will clear or convict...
Your Honor, with all due respect, you've signed warrants for less.
We get it yet?
Where are the admixture results from the ice machine?
This should get us a warrant.
Well, clean surfaces make for good analysis.
Not just yet.
Well, based on his pants around the knees, I would say a crime of passion.
Given the brutality of it ... seems to me an act of rage.
Take a look at his head, tell me what you see.
I thought you might say that. 
Well, we know that people often commit crimes in places they're familiar with.
Well, that should help.
She does all my running.
Well, according to Sara, that's consistent with the girl's story.
Well, that would have rendered him immobile.
He was beaten postmortem.
So, Gregory Curtwell sees Brian attacking his sister. His adrenaline starts going, and he can't stop.
Thanks.
Do you recognize this girl?
Did Brian ever mention the name Ashley Curtwell?
'Out of hand'?
Where did he work?
He ended up here on the floor with his spinal cord severed.
It does if there were three hammers and three attackers.
Me.
What's up?
Why is Gregory Curtwell hanging out with teenage boys?
I bet the shoe also goes to school there.
You know what I hate? People who hurt kids. And you know who those people sometimes are?
Other kids. If it had been your son whose skull was smashed in with a hammer, you'd be asking me where I was when I should've been protecting him. Kids bring guns to school to shoot other kids, so who are you protecting?
Brass says the kid is looking forward to going to jail.
So, what do we got here?
Are these ... ? 
Spaghetti-oh's?
Greg, test both of these. 
If a third guy has braces, it may explain the strange pattern on Brian's hand.
What's 'C &amp; D'?
And Aaron Gilbert was...?
They weren't. The smashed watermelon suggests the whole thing was premeditated.
$375. Brian's parents said that he was being paid $500 every two weeks. Cash under the table.
... priceless.
Twelve strangers ... stuck in a room with no exit. It's like Sartre said: 'Hell is other people.'
My early opinion? Blunt force.
He's got a, uh, medical alert bracelet. Allergy to penicillin.
Do you have one with blond hair?
There's no tag cells, and she's not a natural blonde, and it looks synthetic.
Homicide just called. They're reopening the Rita Westonson case based on new information from the eyewitness?
You think we missed something?
Does the witness seem credible to you?
At the time, you were a level two, I believe. So closing the case would have been my decision.
Let me know.
We sent a sample of his pants to trace. The area around the injection mark ... 
I don't know, but if Gibbons knew he was severely allergic, I bet he carried one of those auto-injector pens.
And another allergy.
Based on peanut butter in the chili? How does a juror benefit from Gibbons' death?
That's nuts. The risk isn't worth the reward.
Good. What are you working on?
So the soil doesn't support the eye witness testimony.
The river might have washed away all trace of hydrocarbons.
The ring from four years ago is thinner and distorted.
And distortion could mean evidence of a toxic event.
How are you going to prove it?
Be specific, Greg.
Did the assay test show any other food allergies?
And who?
Apis mellifera linnaeus. We're looking for another body.
Was Gibbons even aware that he had a bee allergy?
Or what's left of him.
Lost consciousness, fell forward, hit his head on the table.
Well, that explains it. It was an outside job.
Four years ago when I decided to close the case, did you agree with my decision?
And now?
Why?
It happens. And that's what the evidence was telling us.
I agree, Nick. But when you start to have feelings for the people involved, you risk your objectivity.
Good. We certainly don't need another me around here.
For now, no one enters this house except CSI.
Warrick, you got the car.
Both.
Sara, you take the perimeter.
I need you to work the outside. Catherine and I will be inside.
Find out where she walked and what she might have touched in there.
That's why we're here.
What am I smelling?
Definite lack of lividity. She must have bled out.
She looks like she was placed in this position.
Positive for both.
He kills Debbie in the shower. Then he washes up in both sinks and in the tub? Why?
He cleaned everywhere but inside the shower.
Where's all this blood coming from?
And then disposed of it.
It seems he vacuumed to remove any trace from the house.
Grissom.
Sara, uh, listen, I'm in a bad area. I'll call you back.
Skin tag? That's great. Uh, give it to Greg.
No, I-I'm fine. I'll-I'll, uh ... I'll talk to you back at the lab.
Hey, guys, can we continue, please?
She comes home from the grocery store.
She parks in the driveway, and she begins to unload.
Michael Clark. But can we place him dead at the house? 
Greg, what else can you tell us about that hair?
The avatar of choice ... for dismemberments.
Well, I KM'd the carpet at the threshold of the bathroom. It's negative for blood.
She lights the candles in the shower. Her back is to the door. He grabs her from behind...
... and slits her throat.
Then he positions her body ... 
... so that her face is the first thing the boyfriend sees when he walks in.
Most likely because Michael Clark was the real focus of his rage. 
Okay. I just got started in here. Haven't even gotten to the other rooms yet.
My knees can't take this anymore.
What did you bring?
We have to replace that, you know.
As soon as we find some evidence, I promise.
Just talk it through with me, will you? What do we know?
Let's go back to the bedroom.
No, nothing on this sheet.
Hey, Cath? Got silk?
They do?
Grissom.
Butterfly? Where? 
Let me look again and I'll call you back.
Good. Warrick found a butterfly charm in the vacuum bag. I think I just found a piece from the same chain in this box.
She had a collection.
Maybe the killer was taking his gift back, as in leave no trace. Maybe he finally ran out of patience and got sloppy.
And this is why I didn't leave.
There's an oily film on the surface of the hair.
Greg, please, I'm very tired.
Finasteride, the chemical name for propecia.
Not yet.
You got a take on him?
Is he going bald?
Grey hair?
Anything else?
What's the consensus?
Forget hard science. What's your hypothesis?
I don't care about court. My mind's on a left-handed, propecia-using surgeon who's probably on staff at Desert Palm.
Your hair is, though.  We found it at the crime scene. Minoxidil absorbs infrared light.
No, we don't.
It's sad, isn't it, doc? Guys like us. Couple of middle-aged men who've allowed their work to consume their lives.
The only time we ever touch other people is when we're wearing our latex gloves.
We wake up one day and realize that for fifty years we haven't really lived at all. But then, all of a sudden ... we get a second chance. 
Somebody young and beautiful shows up. Somebody ... 
... we could care about. She offers us a new life with her ... ... but we have a big decision to make, right? Because we have to risk everything we've worked for in order to have her. 
I couldn't do it ...
... but you did. You risked it all ... 
... and she showed you a wonderful life, didn't she? But then she took it away and gave it to somebody else, ... 
... and you were lost. 
So you took her life.
You killed them both, and now you have nothing.
Are you?
This is odd. Arms and legs become deadweight in the water. He should have sunk to the bottom of the pool. 
Sara, would you see where the source of that cable is?
This is not a crime scene.
THIS is a crime scene.
I'm sorry, but there's really no gentle way to do this.
Blood smear on the desk.
Well, you may have a concussion.
Make sure you take it back to Greg.
A partial thumb, perhaps, on the tape that was used to cover the security guard's mouth. Not torn, either. Both ends were cut.
How about you? 
Sugar water. Why just the sword?
Yeah, but if you're going to steal from a casino, why take an antique? Why not take cash?
How's your knowledge of Japanese history, particularly, antiquities?
To find the hunter ... know the game.
Okay, what about photographs?
Well, this is just a list of inventory. How about the insurance policy?
Seventeenth century suit of armor. Wasn't the Japanese military established long after that?
So, this is out of place.
Grissom.
I thought he was unconscious. How does his prints end up on the tape?
All right. Thanks, Nick. 
Sara?
Do you have any duct tape in your kit?
Thank you.
We've been conned.
huh. Domo arigato.
It's an old trick. Don't steal the item; just leave it at the location, come back and get it when the cops leave.
Perhaps. We found the sword.
Uh ... we'll need to take this back to our lab.
It's part of an on-going investigation. We need to process it.
To us as well.
I don't think so. I do have a question for Mr. Yamamoto. Your collection is primarily 17th century, but we found one piece, a suit of armor, that our research dates to the mid-19th century.
Mr. Caulfield, we'd like to take a look at your personal vault.
How much cash did you have in here?
There's the suit of armor. The Trojan Horse?
Might be.
And the con goes on.
Well, this explains the glucose. Food source. Probably didn't know how long he was going to be in the suit.
Urine.  He was in there for a while. How you doing with those money bands?
I think it's the code from the vault. Must've recorded it.
The same way our thief did: Using your musical code.
Mr. Caulfield, you have video surveillance?
And the time?
I'm thinking that might be the money.
An employee ID card?
Hmm. Okay, so find the best shot you can of our mystery thief. If he is an employee, you should be able to ID him.
Yes, but technology is a wonderful thing, Nick.
Well, let's find out, shall we?
Nick, want to do me a favor and tape-lift that?
Should four-hundred-year-old lacquer look this good? 
A fake one. This is nothing more than a hardened ball of wax.
Well, so far, nothing's what it seems.
Sometimes paper products or other materials like silk -- they soak it in tea to give an aged look.
I think this is boot polish.
We believe this collection is worthless. Well-made, historically accurate, ... probably worthless.
Your head of security said that Mr. Yamamoto's collection was documented by an internal registrar.
She was on vacation ... but even though she's not an official appraiser, she should've been able to tell these were fakes, don't you think?
It seems he's left.
Well, we have that in common.
Brandon Miller, Nathan Pollard, Vanessa Green, and Yuri Yamamoto. Three of your employees and one whale ... all evidently disappear.
Well ... he knew they were worthless.
Call Brass. Get a warrant.
Well, he certainly does beautiful work.
Mr. Chen is Mr. Yamamoto. He's not even Japanese.
Well, I'm guessing he spent all his money on the baccarat tables, buying himself a reputation. 
... three little maids from school are we ... 
You ever listen to Gilbert and Sullivan?
Ty Caulfield does.
I don't think so. How much does $10 million in cash weigh, I wonder?
Sara, I'm going to need the money bands you collected. Nick, you get to do the math.
This is what's left of your $10 million.
Do you know how much $10 million weighs? 
220 pounds. Your lifeguard, Nathan Pollard-- 5'6', 140 pounds. 
Mmm. Say, could I borrow $10,000 in $100 bills?
Only for a demonstration.
That's okay. I brought my own.  Did you know ... money bands are wrapped tightly around stacks of bills? They're very difficult to slip off. In fact, the only way you can get them off is to tear them.
None of your money bands were torn. Now, I don't know how much money you had in your vault, Mr. Caulfield, but I'm pretty sure I know how much you're going to be asking your insurance company for. You see, that's why you had your
Mmm. 'The Mikado'.
Uh, Mr. Chen's ... 
Including The Mikado? Well, you know, one of your 'partners' is going to come back again someday. He's going to miss his family, friends, the ensemble. He'll be back. And I'm guessing he'll tell us all about your latest production.
Until then.
I'm going to hand my findings over to your insurance company. I wouldn't count on receiving a payment.
Same way you'd eat an elephant ... one bite at a time.
Hey, Jim ... did you know that Charles Manson is only 5'2'?
Do you remember the, uh, story about ... how and where the marshals found old Charlie when they raided barker ranch?
We need a medic!
Hard to count under those conditions. Are you sure?
No.
What happened to your assault in Henderson?
There's two more bodies over by the beer.
Reflex, maybe. Pulled the trigger before he had a target.
Did you get prints off the two suspects?
Good.  Prison tattoos. They weren't virgins.
18 bullets, a total of 26 shells, 72 pellets. Enjoy.
Warrick.
Only one?
No. A clean shot.
The girl was wearing a black sweater, carrying a purse.
Your statement says that you fired four shots at this third gunman.
Ballistics evidence shows that you spread five shots over the back wall.
The truth is, we have a dead civilian with your bullet in her.
AFIS hits on our suspects, both just recently released from five-year sentences at Lompoc.
Born and raised.
The tec-9 guy.
Shotgun guy. 
Thanks, Doc.
Highlight the shots that killed the tec-9 shooter. 
Fromansky said that he fired three or four shots at that target.
Okay, the guy with the shotgun was killed with... one bullet.
But this shot is closer to the second gunman than it is to the cocktail waitress.
Okay.
Just like he said he did.
They'd be wrong.
Maybe he really doesn't know what happened.
Good.
Hey, take a look at this. The cracks in the glass from shot 22 are terminated by the cracks from shot 23.
So, shot 23 had to occur before shot 22. Which means that Fromansky was firing from left to right, not right to left.
According to Catherine's witness, the cocktail waitress wasn't moving. She was a stationary target.
So, if he was shooting at a moving target, where was it moving to?
Well, just because it shows nothing doesn't mean it's seeing everything.
Keep moving to your right.
Keep going. Keep going.
Tell me what you see.
I guess it depends on whether I get stuck in traffic on the way to your hearing.
We got a bullet hole in a jacket. That's not even enough to prove that he was in the store.
What about the calls from the grocery store to the suspect's cell? That could have been somebody giving the 'go' signal.
Yeah, I wanted to take a look myself.
Good. The report says that the cocktail waitress was wearing a black wool sweater. Was she also wearing something polyester?
Take a look at this.
Fromansky claims that he was tunnel-visioned on the gunman. So, it's possible that he never even saw the cocktail waitress.
Two dead felons, two dead civilians a dead policeman ... I don't know what to think.
Home.
No. You?
I was watching the world series of poker. Waiting for Sam Farha to light his cigarette.
She dropped where she was shot, but he looks like he was dragged.
Unless that was the point.
So far, an empty briefcase and a purse.
Yeah, please. Catherine and Warrick are inside. The bodies were found on the driveway, so any evidence of the killers is going to be out here.
Fascinating. Cause of death?
Stun gun burns?
And we suspect that there were two assailants.
For what?
I have to get this evaluation in, or I'm gonna get written up.
You don't have a personal life?
How can I help?
You. Advance, I mean. Do you ... have any interest in changing sections in the lab, for instance?
The goal of any supervisor is to teach someone how to take his place someday. Are you going someplace?
You never know. 
Why not? You're certainly qualified. But ... a CSI who uses the DNA lab to establish her own paternity ... calls into question ... her judgment, don't you think?
I believe that we've dealt with this issue, handled it internally. As far as I'm concerned, it's dead. Besides, you'll never do it again. So just sign your name by the red 'X.'
For how much?
Sam Braun was a murder suspect in one of your cases. How does this not look like a payoff?
What about conflict of interest? Not just for you but for this lab.
Maybe not legally, but ethically? 
What else should I know, Catherine?
I believe you were hit with a stun gun. 
More work.
Yeah, two-carat diamond earrings, ruby necklace, diamond and sapphire bracelet, lady's gold rolex. 
You know that feeling you get when you just can't quite put your finger on something?
Why did they drag his body down the driveway?
Hold it. Run that back.
Pause it.
What is that around the kid's neck?
You bring a canteen up to your lips, not to your eyes. 
AV Lab. Grissom.  I'll be right there.
Blood spatter everywhere. Multiple directionalities. 
You almost done, David?
Thanks. I want to pick his pockets.
M ... and T. Doesn't look like Michael Trent.
And where's the rest of the jewelry?
Look what I found: A dead guy.
Nine-millimeter. Pillowcase full of jewelry. Two stacks of $10,000 bricks. 
And we're still looking for somebody.
Who gets the honors: Him or him?
Stun gun. The debilitator of choice.
Mm-hmm.
How about his buddy? Any lead in him?
I wonder why?
Stay right here until I call you.
Nick, would you move about halfway up the driveway?
Exactly.
No, I can't. Thank you.
I'm fine. How are you? Would you put an APB out on Kyle Goode's vehicle, please?
According to your son, he slept all the way to Laughlin.
The good thing about drugs? They work their way through the bloodstream in the urine, but not the hair. Our lab found trace elements of ambien, which is a hypnotic sleep sedative, in your son's hair root.
Yeah, well, lawsuits take a while. I don't think you cared about a verdict anyway, did you, Kyle? You wanted much more than that.
Yeah, that's where he screwed up. Your hatred of Trent was stronger than your love for your own child. You drugged your son so you could use him as an alibi.
No, I'm good. 
We'll be fine.
Going out?
No watch, no wallet, no shoes. This guy was picked clean.
Still there.
This guy was well-groomed.
Maybe somebody wouldn't take no for an answer.
They haven't found one yet.
They were all in the bathroom.
Anything else?
In Chinese medicine, the liver is the organ of anger. Addicts and alcoholics medicate their anger, consequently, destroy their liver.
Oh ... a graft from a less angry donor.
Well, he probably got his new liver, figured he could, uh, start all over again.
Uh ...  Jamal ... we're with the Las Vegas crime lab. It seems you were driving a dead man's car when you got in your accident.
Look, pal, right now the evidence tells us that you killed the man whose car you were driving. You want to explain that?
I think a plea of insanity.
Heroin?
So, if it's not an opiate, what is it?
Did you run it through the GCMS?
Well, that makes sense.
Well, the substance we found in his car was ibogaine.
A choline-esterase inhibitor that acts as a stimulant in the central nervous system. 
In the liver, it converts to an active metabolite ... noribogaine. Noribogaine locks onto addiction receptors ... blocking the feedback loops that reinforce dependency.
Well, apparently, in some cases, one dose of ibogaine can cure physical addiction.
It comes with a free trip. Curing physical addiction is a side effect. Its intended use is to facilitate visual, tactile, and auditory experiences of alternate realities.
Mm-hmm. Used by the Bwiti tribe of Central Africa. It comes from the powdered bark of a tree growing in Cameroon.
Many ethno-botanists believe that the iboga is what the bible is talking about when it refers to the tree of knowledge.
The Bwiti consume the powdered bark as part of an initiation ceremony. 
After the ritual, a man is called baanzi, one who has seen the other world.
Not in the U.S.
Well ... 
You don't believe in ibogaine?
But Ed came down from the mountain, and he brought the ibogaine with him.
From one addiction to another.
We found prints belonging to three separate people in Ed Burnell's car: His, Jamal the thief, and Mindy.
Except we found her print on a condom.
Yeah? How much, I wonder.
And you didn't want to get high anymore.
Did you come here to remember or to forget?
Mindy, we found a knife in your basket of clothes with Ed Burnell's blood on it.
There were fifty-seven micrograms per milliliter of monoacetylmorphine in your urine sample. That means you were using for a while.
Why would you have a knife with his blood on it?
I think Ed Burnell knew you were using again and he was out there that night looking for you.
Sara. Excuse me. Could you, uh, help me out?
A woman. I need you to process a female suspect for me.
I haven't seen you for a while, have I?
Do we know who?
What do you bet Boom Boom's estate is on the corner of Washington and D Street?
What's the matter? Lose faith in Mindy? She always comes back to you.
Mindy didn't need it anymore, right? That's why you helped her remember.
Yeah, we do: Burnell's blood on your skin.
Unfortunately.
Lateral move. She's already there.
Well, you're free to go.
Yeah ... except there's no blood spatter on the walls or the ceiling.
Well, unless he was bending over the sofa with his chest pushed against this cushion, this bloodstain is inconsistent with that wound.
Paul, would you turn him over for us?
Well, the crime scene suggests he was moving around his apartment while being stabbed so, 'straight in, straight out' doesn't seem likely.
What about defensive wounds?
Okay, so, he's running around his apartment trying to get away from his attacker and he incurs no nicks or cuts?
What else?
Maybe a treasure map.
In 1984, William Bergstrom asked old man Binion if he could come into his casino and bet a million dollars on one roll of craps. That November, he put a briefcase full of $1 million on the 'don't pass' line, rolled a seven on the come-up.
Soon after that, he killed himself.
If the wounds couldn't have been made by a handheld knife, maybe the knife wasn't handheld.
Well, put the evidence aside for a second. What was Adanto's state of mind? You've had a few bad runs.
So put that into context with your evidence.
His eyes took the brunt of the punishment.
No. But he may have tried.
So much for brotherly love.
He made enemies fast.
Why?
Two.
Blood evidence at the scene suggests that his attackers did not use a weapon.
Bare knuckles?
Neck bruises were made by a left hand?
What about these bruises?
So a hand on his throat, knees on his chest, his head was butted up against a wall, and all the blows were directed at his face.
Maybe there were no other attackers.
Mr. Darian, may I see your fingers?
Well, because you may have evidence underneath the fingernails, and I'd like to collect it.
Mr. Darian, do you have a fever?
I'm fine.
I scraped his nails.
What was his liver temp?
He's been dead an hour. That means his body temperature was 103. I touched his skin, Catherine. He felt like he was on fire.
I have a question.
Cause of death?
Prior condition?
This guy was pumped up before the fight. White knuckles, veins popping.
He had a temperature of 103 when he died. Any pathology to explain that?
So there was nothing wrong with this guy.
I was in the room with your brother.
The autopsy concluded that your brother's death was not the result of the officers' use of force.
Ms. Darian, your brother's body temperature was ...
Walter Darian lived here. He owned the place.
That case is closed.
'The evil men do lives after them. The good is oft interred with their bones.'
Julius Caesar.
Well ... if Walter viewed his world as a threatening place, according to the shrinks, the hoarding of useless objects may have made him feel safe and secure.
Well ... I guess there was no more room at the inn.
Well, there's no clothing left. The wedding band could be either/or. There's nothing gender-specific yet.
No, it's probably more than three years.
Well, the rule of thumb is if the skull smells bad, it's usually under three years. This one smells like dirt.
Possible murder weapon.
Any blood's been exposed to the elements longer than the inside of these bones.
Well, we haven't known him that long.
I didn't.
Tox and histology results came back on Walter Darian. Negative across the board. No drugs, no diseases. I don't get it. The guy was 38 years old, and this was his first arrest.
Congratulations.
Walter Darian.
According to the autopsy, she never gave birth.
So there has to be an additional biological source, 'cause there was no one else in that grave.
Which leaves our missing waitress Libby still unaccounted for.
There was no evidence of a fetus or a baby in that grave. She never gave birth.
Well, that might explain the hunting knife we found.
Walter Darian never threw anything out ... So where'd the baby go?
He wouldn't.
We think so.
When you used to be a waitress, Libby?
We found your old waitress uniform in Walter's car.
How old is that little guy?
How did Martin get the scar on his forehead?
Or you didn't want to know.
And we don't think Walter wrote it, either.
'735'?
That's a nasty head wound.
It's common to find something in blood. Uncommon to find something on blood.
Petechial hemorrhaging. Asphyxia.
An 'S'?
So, he swallows a tile and tries to give himself a Heimlich?
That's interesting.
Anagrams.
Do we know why he came to Vegas?
Is that like the elo system in chess?
Wilson Janek?
Gil Grissom. Nice to meet you.
So ... 
What do you hear about Adam Brenner?
Well, he was alive last night when he beat you.
Actually ... I'm from the Las Vegas crime lab. I'm just here to collect your DNA.
What's it used for?
Well, that narrows it down to just about everybody in the tournament.
How many words used the letters we found in Adam's body?
What's an 'exvin'?
Well, according to the rules, if you play a bluff and your opponent challenges, you have to take the tiles back, you lose a turn and a minute off your game clock. No points.
P-I-S-T-O-L? It's not the word we were looking for, but it's interesting.
It's got blood on it.
Hmm. A fake gun for a fake word?
How about after he fell down on the floor and stopped breathing?
You got a husband-and-wife serial team killing couples.
You've signed warrants for less.
Love is conditional.
But not for you.
Should get a warrant.
No.
Are those your guys?
How long they been sitting on the house?
Two undercover guys outside. Two dead bodies inside.
Not paranoid enough.
W ... what is that?
You know we're going to need to see your guns.
It wasn't a question.
So it seems.
Yesterday's suspects. Today's victims.
Take the inside.
Print the handle.
I don't know what that is. Make sure you get al though. You see any cartridge casings?
So T.O.D. was about 11:00 P.M.
We're going to bring everything back. 
Linens and towels from The Sphere on top of the washing machine, and what I believe to be sheets from the motel inside the dryer. Both positive presumptive for blood.
What does that say about whoever killed them?
If I'm not done, you're not done.
Which way is Harmon Hill?
And how'd he beat us to the killer?
No. We found a lot of this material at the crime scene.
Maybe he was shot through some sort of object. 
Who do we have around here that could find us a somewhat used soda bottle?
If the evidence points to cops, we chase cops.
Somebody knew we were looking at the Klinefelds. They knew where they lived. That's somebody inside.
Ha! In what city?
There was an eyewitness who saw a uniform at the front door.
So, now you're discrediting your own witness?
Just because they weren't the shooters doesn't mean they weren't involved.
Oh, please! You got a bogus 444 call two blocks away.
I'm not a cop.
That's not the way it works.
Not now.
This'll do.
Where exactly?
Meaning?
This collar's dry. It's hot out -- at least a buck twenty-five.
How'd you manage to lose your badge?
That's not the answer I was hoping for.
You referring to me?
This swab is your new priority.
Fill me in first. The sweat stain?
The shoe print?
How can you be doing that when you're standing here?
Where are we?
Old habits die hard. 
Yeah.
You're a suspect in an ongoing investigation. We're not allowed to have a conversation.
Well, if that's true, then your DNA sample will rule you out.
Is that how you do your job, officer?
Maybe he disguised his voice.
I messed up, Jim. I got ahead of the evidence. I made it personal, and I don't know why.
I still think it's somebody inside. 
Vigilantes?
So take the cops out. Who's left?
'All for our country.'
I'm not accusing you of murder. I just want to see your shoes.
We need to see all your shoes.
Not this pair.
Not those.
You a smoker?
It's not good for you.
I guess he'd just figured he'd take a shortcut. You've thought about it.
Inspiration.
Okay.
How's this?
Don't blame me. Blame him.
I saw his flasher from the road.
Fresh cut on his forehead. But the corneas usually take days to gloss over.
Maybe.
Well, collect it or lose it. Ten years ago nobody would've known the difference.
I'll find something in the car to bindle it.
Well, at least we didn't come in last.
This could be blood on this rock.
Twenty thousand. And the road is closed to civilians.
Except for that head wound.
What about the bloody knuckles?
So cause of death?
We go to the fallback position.
This guy was 25 years old.
Dehydration.
Too much running, too much partying?
Work hard, play hard, die young, leave a good-looking corpse.
Blood pressure medication? There's no history of that in his medical records.
But it is a diuretic. Could explain the dehydration.
How'd the furosemide get in his system in the first place?
Natural fiber?
Like on a sports uniforms.
Looks like you got in a fight?
We found red fibers on him that may match your jacket.
Mind if we take your jacket to confirm?
Protein bar wrapper, empty water bottle, banana peel. Why the trash?
Oh. What's the best way to get chemicals into your system?
But there was no evidence of that. Second best?
Trace amounts of furosemide in his water bottle.
Well, that condition's normally associated with drug abuse.
Kind of risky for a cop, considering they're subject to random drug tests.
Dehydrating the body in the process.
Leading to arrhythmia, and consequently cardiac arrest.
So, what's our problem?
Tim Coleman drank from this bottle. What does this look like to you?
Actually, we have all the evidence we need.
I have a question. Off the record.
Then why did you do this?
Sooner or later, everybody gets replaced.
Pharaoh's Fever, yeah ... but my ride ended at the platform. What do you know?
Accident with injury.
It's also a Four-Eighteen-B.
A runaway train.
This is the first time a roller coaster has derailed in Clark County. Huge criminal and civil liabilities issues, so keep it quiet. Photograph the scene. Bag and tag all the detritus. Forklift anything bigger than Greg. We're going to put up a tent on the other side of the parking lot for accident reconstruction. Questions?
Curious, isn't it?
You responsible for maintaining this roller coaster?
You have any idea what would cause this train to go off the track?
So, you're an expert?
Do you know what that is?
Well, one loose screw ... couldn't cause a train to derail, could it?
'There are three things in human life that are important. The first is to be kind; the second one is to be kind; and the third one is to be kind.'
Very good. Author of one of the greatest horror stories ever written: Turn of the Screw. And I'm looking for one.
Yes.
Well, as long as you can screw a nut on it, it's a screw.
Well, it's only a mystery if you believe in ghosts.
End threads are stripped.
And the nuts would've popped off.
We got tool marks.
Vertical striations, evenly spaced. 
What about this guy?
According the ride operator, there were only five passengers on the roller coaster, and no employees.
So ... maybe Nevins was just an unfortunate bystander. Hit in the head by a falling roller coaster.
Albert... dead men don't ride roller coasters.
We're going to need to see the underside of the loading platform.
No.
Uh, Woody? We'd like to be alone.
Well, easy access. Wheels are in reach.
It's a funny place for lubricant. It's not even on the track.
Hey, look at that. 
Were you aware that that support beam was detached?
Woody, we'd like to requisition your pipe wrench.
Well, I promise we'll get it back to you.
Yeah?
Anything distinctive?
Well, we need to find a car with a red interior.
The release of epinephrine and adrenaline while riding a roller coaster can produce a stimulatory effect. It enhances ejaculation.
Greg, do we know who the R.O. of this t-bird is?
The dead employee.
Everything's relevant Greg, until it's not.
A pipe wrench.
Greg, may I?
Blood pool.
Camouflaged by the red carpet. That explains the autopsy findings. Nevins may have never been in the roller coaster. Possibly killed by that wrench and stuffed in his own trunk.
I'm just following the evidence.
Are you?
Perfect match.
Did you any prints off the wrench?
Thank you, Woody.
Quadratic equations? That's not easy.
Is your name really Cleopatra?
Lisa, we need to know what the two of you did when you got off the ride.
How many names on the list?
Ah, the lovely Cleopatra.
Your client had a prescription for doxepin. May we see your arms, please?
Do you know how you contracted the rash, Lisa?
Do you know if he contracted the rash, as well?
Zack, what do you have against roller coasters?
You're a smart guy, Zack. So, uh ... let's talk this out, logically. According to your previous statement, when you locked up on Thursday night, Jim Nevins' car was the only one in the parking lot, right?
And you knew he was staying in the park to ride the roller coaster.
Did you think that meant something?
But ... you didn't trust her.
Uh-huh. But you didn't loosen the wheels enough, did you?
So when the roller coaster didn't derail, you took things into your own hands.
What I don't understand is why you didn't go back and fix the roller coaster.
You're not to blame for this, Woody.
My first week in Vegas, I road the Desperado. 
Hmm. The steel phantom, Kennywood Park, Pennsylvania -- I actually hold the marathon record there.
Mm. I presented a paper at an entomology convention in Cincinnati just so I could ride Son of Beast. Head over heels on a wooden track.
No. Not really. For me, it's not about the track.  It's about the thrill.
He's wearing a wig and a fat suit. It's not Halloween, is it?
I don't know. 
I'm looking for a sign.
GSR in the wound track. No stellate tearing. Gunshots appear to be close range, but non-contact.
Professional hit?
Lividity's consistent with body position. I don't think it was a body dump.
I'll go ahead and bag a sample.
'Rampart Casino.' Well, his day started out good. He won $436,278. 
So where is this money?
And it seems that robbery may be a motive after all.
You can't. We found the body under the WHISKEY TOWN sign and the guy just cleaned out the Rampart Casino.
Even if it is, they're still Sam Braun's casinos.
He's your father. You can't be on this case.
Catherine, you have to go home.
Did you take him to the box?
Smells like the cleaning crew just left.
Well, good. We'll look at the tapes a little later.
Would you turn off the lights, please?
Five point two six percent. Albert Einstein had a theory about roulette. He said the only way to win at roulette is to steal the money from the table when the croupier isn't looking.
Well, maybe it was an inside job, Sam. Maybe somebody bought off one of your guys.
Just because you can't see something doesn't mean it's not there.
A computer in his shoe.
Based on what?
Well, if our vic was the receiver, there has to be a transmitter.
Well, his driver's license was fake, so, this could be fake, too.
Neon glass.
The comparison?
See? That connects the two murders. We've got a timeline.
Transmitter and receiver.
The Eudaemon. Aristotle's presiding spirit of rationality.
It's simple in principle.
A fixed mass in a known orbit.
As long as you can account for all the forces-- air resistance, friction, gravity -- you can land a probe on mars.
Nice return. But it's a complicated system.
I'm testing my podiatric dexterity. What are you doing?
The ones from the case you're not working on?
And you know this because ... ?
And you walked away, I hope.
That doesn't prove anything. Besides, any evidence that comes from you is tainted.
240 inches-- 20 feet. 
I did.
I don't. 
I thought that Nick was the best candidate for the position.
Because he didn't care whether he got the job or not.
We've got blood.
The tire patterns at the scene of Teddy Keller's murder are consistent with the wheel base and turning radius of your client's limousine.
We also found neon glass embedded in all four tires.
Well, then ... how did his blood end up in the back of your client's limousine?
Yeah, why? Something change?
So, you're saying that the shoe computers would've worked better in one of the new casinos on the strip?
Then it was intentional.
Maybe personal.
What?
It's the evidence.
Maybe he was expecting us.
Well, if he did ... he missed a spot.
Money from ... the Tangiers ... money from Pike's. Bet there's fifty grand in there.
Plus ... what could be paint and blood smears.
My guess, stopped being about the money.
She has severe lacerations on her feet. She was running hard from somewhere.
The engine's running, no flat tires. Why'd she stop?
How many vacation days do you have on the books?
I think you should take a week or two.
Okay.
What?
Well, as soon as you can find and train a replacement, you can be in the field. Until then, I need you in the lab. Now give.
Still open?
Thanks.
Where'd they find the body?
That's not far from where Linley Parker was assaulted.
Did she have a car?
So apart from geography and age, what else did they have in common?
My vic was a pit boss at the Palms.
Linley Parker was single. Blonde.
Dr. Coombs, my name's Gil Grissom. I'm with the crime lab. I'm here to collect a DNA sample, so if you'd open your mouth?
Well, we have a warrant, so we can compel a sample. Either way I'm gonna get it.
The good news: If you're innocent, this'll prove it. 
Thank you.
I believe the semen would indicate a brother.
Or brothers.
Hey.
Soon as the DNA comes back, we'll know which brother it is.
Didn't you say that you were on the phone with her and you heard the window break?
Did you find her phone?
Linley!
Linley!
Defensive wounds.
She was raped again?
Sperm.
Maybe rape was just foreplay for this guy. Maybe what he really gets off on is killing.
Dr. Coombs.
We are. Why are you here?
I am. Why?
Well, what about your other brothers?
And you do?
Where does he get his 'junk'?
Dr. Coombs, we found a 1968 Pontiac outside your brother's house. The VIN matched a car belonging to a victim who was raped and murdered by the same person who raped Linley Parker. And we found Linley Parker's dead body on your Brother's property.
According to the DNA, the blood from Linley Parker's smashed window matches the semen from all the rapes.
Or Kevin Coombs. Or any of the rest of the brothers Grimm.
That's not what the evidence says.
You can be wrong, I can be wrong, the evidence is just the evidence.
It doesn't prove rape.
Would you strip down to your shorts, please, doctor?
I'm going to examine your clothing for any trace evidence, and we're going to document your body for any injuries that may have been sustained during a recent struggle.
If you'd like, this officer will assist you.
Thank you. Turn around, please.
Hold still please.
Turn off the lights, would you, please, officer?
You know that bone marrow donation you gave your brother?  I checked your medical records. His body rejected it and he died. My guess is that's when you first found out about your unique condition.
A chimera. Head of a lion, body of a goat, tail of a dragon. You're a genetic anomaly. One person, two completely different sets of DNA.
Sometimes fraternal twins, two separately fertilized eggs, develop into only one person.
In effect, one twin dies in embryo, but its DNA survives in the other.
That's why the DNA from his buccal swab matched his hair but not his semen.
Yeah, and the DNA in his semen, was evidently from his dead twin brother.
Is she all right?
Well, thank you. I appreciate the courtesy.
Come on. I'll take you home.
Eventually.
Sun Tzu once said, 'If you wait by the river long enough, the bodies of your enemies will float by.'
But those were brutal times.
Four weeks of 100 degree days, zero percent humidity. Eventually, the body tissues sublimate ...
... cell fluids vaporize ...
Well, the desert was making mummies long before the Egyptians.
Take a look at this. 
And look at her fingers. 
Yeah. Which means she was alive when she was entombed.
With a big bite out of it?
Hopefully. Take it back to the lab.
So whoever boarded her up in the closet maybe didn't intend to kill her.
She lived alone. Only relative was a nephew. Brass is looking for him.
Three days must have felt like three years.
Yeah. Also need a dental impression.
We don't need an I.D ...
You have to prepare yourself for this. Your aunt was found in an advanced state of decomposition.
Dry mouth. Diaphoresis. Red eyes, dilated pupils.
Do you get the munchies?
When you're high.
Do you like cake?
How would you like to make a dental impression for us?
Warrick's getting sloppy.
Dessert.
Well, both victims were left alive, we think. I mean, the old lady's death was probably unintentional, and the girl's rape was ... 
The difference between burglary and home invasion -- infliction of terror.
Well, it was probably easier to subdue her in that position.
You okay?
The occlusal plane looks the same. And the lateral incisor overlaps the canine ...
... in both cases.
Definitely not the old lady's nephew.
Jansson's dental impression is consistent with the bite mark on the girl's shoulder.
We've given them no reason to stop.
Hi. My name's Gil Grissom. I'm with the Las Vegas crime lab.
I think you do. And I need you to speak for someone who can't speak for herself. Another victim.
Look, we know that two men broke into your house. We have one suspect in custody, but we can't hold him unless you talk to us.
Mr. Kirkwood, I've done all that I can. I need what you saw.
No.
And if I had a wife and children ...
You find any commonalities?
It's a connection. It's not enough to compel DNA.
No, we have a name, and we know where he works.
Listen, when she I.D.s Kelly James, we're going to need a DNA sample and an immediate hold, no bail.
He's a risk.
Mr. Kirkwood, I'm sorry. The other day, I thought you were saying that you 'wouldn't' help me, and now I realize that you 'couldn't'.
Mr. Kirkwood ... you didn't do anything wrong.
What do you think?
108 degrees outside.
This one makes twelve.
145 degrees inside the car.
I brought a sheet. All these Looky-loo's, I think we'd better treat this like the baby's still alive.
uhm ... nothing.
Well, maybe this wasn't the primary vehicle for transporting the baby.
What is that?
I don't get people.
I am now. Catherine's doing the baby case. It's hot in here.
It doesn't appear that robbery was a motive.
I had a case once where a soda can was the murder weapon. Suspect used it to bash in the victim's head.
He's got a workout schedule. And today? Three-mile run. Fat metabolizers containing ephedra. Scorching heat and ephedra? That's not good.
Yeah. Feel the burn.
You got another theory?
One point on the electrical path to ground.
Well, there's your conductor.
'Ice block.'
Inventive.
This was not a fair fight.
She definitely swerved out of her lane. I think I may know why.
A big one.
Whoa. This is incredibly detailed. Eyelashes, nostrils ...
The breadth of your social experience never ceases to impress me.
Are you all right, David?
'Stripey's' brother suffered blunt force trauma caused by a violent collision with a moving vehicle.
Did you know that raccoons have opposable thumbs?
Whoa. That's a lot of blood for blunt force trauma.
Yeah, his tailor didn't think of everything. His suit's not bulletproof.
Shall we?
Even for a raccoon.
The Plushies and Furries convention. And we're looking for a bright blue Plushie ... I think.
This is fascinating. A whole tribe of people who prefer to interact as furry animals rather than human beings.
It's not that weird. It's instinctual. Many native American tribes wore entire bearskins, including the bead, when they performed their war dances. They thought it made them brave.
Well, think of stuffed animals as a Jungian archetype. What's the one quality they possess that a man like Bob Pitt might want?
They're lovable. We better divide and mingle.
I'm going to take in a lecture.
Excuse me. Do you recognize this man, Robert Pitt?
There you go.
I guess we're lucky that blue's not a more popular color.
We're also going to need to talk to you without the masks on.
Thrilled. Let's start at the top.
You have a very musky odor, bud. Quite stimulating, I imagine. Look, we found blue fibers similar to the ones on your costume in the stomach of a dead man. Bob Pitt?
You may know him as Rocky Raccoon?
We think it may have incapacitated him.
Well, clearly, this kitty costume is where bud felt safe enough to skritch. I wonder if he felt safe enough to explore some of the more aggressive aspects of his animus.
What is normal s*x?
Well, Freud said that the only unnatural sexual behavior was to have none at all. And after that, it's just a question of opportunity and preference. And evidently, many prefer the feel of fur to the texture of human skin.
Bud is starting to look like a pretty bad cat. Trace from his costume.
Well, identical to the trace we found in Rocky Raccoon's vomit. Ipecac and civet oil.
Uh, we have an invitation from the Las Vegas police department.
Look, we need you to stop skritching or yiffing or whatever, take off your costumes, and tell us your names.
Well, you know, pheromones are the basis for mammalian reproduction. When the female is in estrus, the male picks up on her come-get-me scent. But most mammals only copulate seasonally.
For some. No one else in that furpile threw up, right?
Smell this.
So I guess we're looking for a wolf ... in wolf's clothing.
Mr. Lee, the concentration of ipecac and civet oil on your paws speaks to application, rather than accidental transfer.
Why sexy kitty?
What did Rocky do to you?
Is this a, uh, general observation, or possibly a personal grievance?
And in the wild, wolves are monogamous, but raccoons are promiscuous.
Your ex-mate?
Mr. Lee, you're a wolf. How'd you end up with a lamb?
Does, uh, Linda Lamb have a human last name?
Linda Jones is Linda Lamb.
Yeah, but evidence without context is not evidence. We had no reason to search the trunk.
For the philandering raccoon that he was.
Okay, assuming that Linda and Bob were heading home after Bob got sick at the hotel, how did he end up on the side of the road?
So, uh, either Bob told Linda to stop the car and let him out, or she told him to start walking?
Which begs the question: Why did she turn the car around and head back toward the hotel?
Mack truck ex machina.
But it still doesn't explain how bob got shot in the back.
Thank you. You've been very helpful.
The righteously angry versus the wrongly accused.
I'm not so sure that people who dress up like cuddly forest creatures carry guns.
Well, we have a grassy knoll ... but no Lee Harvey Oswald.
Well done. So, we got a sick raccoon with an abdominal through-and-through who was shot from what appears to be a fairly steep trajectory.
Or both. I mean, imagine looked like out here at night and from a distance.
We've been looking for ... a person who shot a person, but ... maybe we should be looking for a person who shot an animal.
We're with the Las Vegas crime lab. This your place?
Why don't you give us a brief history of your evening?
We got the Ranger's rifle, we collected a bullet at the scene, and ballistics made a match.
Hmm. Fur and loathing in Las Vegas.
I heard you got some head.
I arranged house seats for David to see Celine, so he pages me the minute you get anything perishable.
Oh ... formaldehyde.
No ID through CODIS. Quite a bit of leaf litter. 
That looks like animal activity. 
That took skill.
The unkindest cut of all.
Good morning. I'm with the Las Vegas Crime Lab, and I ...
Gil Grissom, Las Vegas Crime Lab. May I?
Well, the Elko County Sheriff made the request. We were happy to respond. It's an interesting case.
Must have been a heck of a fall. His head's in a plastic jar.
Well, you do now.
Lieutenant, the preliminary autopsy revealed a single, straight, two-inch cut on the victim's jaw. It was a blade mark. So, there's not just a body out there, there's also a killer.
Grissom.
I'm sorry. I should've called. 
How can you think that? You wouldn't mind taking care of those for me, would you?
I'll make it up to you.
Good. Thanks. I owe you one.
Yeah. She hates it when we're apart.
So your dog found the head?
Is he okay?
All animals can smell rotting flesh. Studies have shown that when domestic pets bring back human body parts, usually the remains are within a half-mile radius.
It occurs more than you think. Have you noticed any buzzards or vultures around?
Thanks.
This slope faces north, doesn't it?
You know that old expression, 'heads will roll'? It's true -- especially downhill.
I'm hoping. Bodies make good fertilizer. You often see fresh, green shoots near a gravesite.
I prefer questions actually.
Step away from there, would you please, fellas? Don't disturb the scene.
Carabid beetles. Second instar maggots. 
Formica obscuripes.
Yeah, I do. They're perfect. They always do their jobs. 
This body's been here four to seven days.
How deep would you say this hole is, Lieutenant?
Takes a fair amount of dedication to dig a hole this deep up here, don't you think?
Maybe.
This blood's not from a cut. The drops imply directionality. The stellated circles imply ... 
... perpendicular impact. 
This spatter is in direct line with the victim's carotid. It's arterial spurt.
I think that the cut we found on his jaw ... was a lure to draw predators.
This wasn't just murder. It was torture.
You're going to have to be patient, Lieutenant. The scene hasn't been released yet. You know, this may be a variation on an old native American form of punishment. The body was bound and buried up to its neck. Tree sap was poured over the head to attract ants.
You see? That's a good question.
You are the coroner, I presume.
Well, we can't touch the body until you authorize it.
There may be evidence in the gravesite. We need to preserve it.
The site's already been compromised. We'll make do with what we have here. Now, for each foot of dirt that's removed, go on a separate bag. I'll sift through it later.
Hold on. Make sure your shovels don't get within six inches of that body.
Well, veterinary school's harder to get into than medical school. That's not what I was looking at. This is you and that gal from the diner.
Only a licensed pathologist can perform an autopsy. All we're allowed to do is search for evidence on the body.
Then we take it to Vegas. Tonight. We'll need someone to drive the body.
Our medical examiner will send you his report. You'll need to sign the death certificate as to cause and manner of death.
Well, I'm not sure yet.
No ligature marks.
Apparently not.
Well, maybe the killer had a gun on him.
That would imply premeditation.
Sylvia Rogers' dog got sick after chewing on the victim's head, correct?
Did you do blood work?
Call the lab. Have them do a full drug and tox panel on the blood. 
Maybe whatever was in this man's body is also in the dog's.
Hold on a second, fellows.
Okay.
Say cheese.
Souvenir.
I need a place to work.
What kind of car was it?
Lieutenant?
The victim was on his way out of town. We know he didn't get very far. So where's his vehicle?
If the killer was a local, he could have ditched the car somewhere near here.
It's a theory.
And like any theory, it doesn't mean anything unless you can prove it.
May I borrow this? 
The victim was last seen here, right?
We found his body here.
This is the only way out of town. The killer had to intercept him somewhere along this road. 
Hey, doc, I need to use some of your medical supplies and make a telephone call. It's local.
Did you tint these windows yourself?
Do you have any tinting film left?
May I use it?
Oh, good, the police. I'd like to report a crime.
Yeah, my vehicle was broken into and my field kit was stolen.
Not necessarily.
Would you keep an eye on this for me?
Thanks.
Excuse me.
You think that would help?
I, uh, found the victim's car.
It was, uh, ditched in an old barn up in the hills. 
I know you don't have any men to spare, so I called the highway patrol. They're sending troopers up there to secure the site.
Well, that should, uh, give you enough time to burn down the barn.
You going to just stand there, or are you coming in?
What does that mean exactly?
This barn had been broken into, which makes it a crime scene, even without the murder victim's car inside, so I don't need a warrant. Who owns this place?
Well, then who's responsible for the property?
Is that who you're protecting?
Hey, you think you can fix this window?
You know that kid that got murdered? We found his car up in the hills. In your uncle's old barn.
That's understandable. It's hard to get to. Not too many gas stations around here. You must do pretty good business.
You know, uh, the victim's car was full of gas. So you must've seen him, right, even though you said you didn't?
Grissom.
More or less.
Greg did?
Hopefully.
It is. It's also a powerful sedative. Could be what was used to subdue him. You know anybody in town that would use this?
Hey, Doc, take a look at the scope, will you? 
I found some hair in Ross Jenson's shirts.
You wouldn't happen to have any abyssinian patients?
Excuse me, Lieutenant. We need to talk.
Privately, please. 
Ross Jenson was having a romantic relationship with someone in this town.
Yes. I believe he was up here visiting that person. I found cat hairs on his t-shirts. From an abyssinian cat. The kind your brother owns.
Does your brother live alone?
Is he gay?
I realize that, but it's relevant to this investigation.
Was married?
Look, whether you like it or not, Leland is a suspect. But you already knew that. I'm giving you an opportunity, Lieutenant. So far, you're only guilty of being a good brother.
You're going to keep Leland in there, right?
He took at shot at me, and he tried to kill himself.
So I should be grateful that you showed restraint with me.
Thanks.  Hello, dear.
Well, that makes sense. From what I've been able to gather, this was his first and only visit up here.
Well, if I believe this was his first and only visit, how do we explain the leaves in his closet?
Does the roommate have a name?
Eric Brooks?
Eric must've known for a while. 
How did you intend to keep the relationship from your own son?
Mr. Brooks, your son killed Ross Jenson.
According to the evidence, it is.
I don't suppose that comes with a warranty?
Does he ever talk to you?
So you assumed your brother was capable of murder.
Questions, remember? Not asking them is what got everybody in trouble here in the first place.
I used to. I'm trying to change.
Ask him for 24 hours. 
The murder weapon's been excluded, that's all. We still have a lab full of evidence we can process.
If you have a problem with CSI, file a complaint -- we're busy.
Well, for the next 24 hours, we're breaking the rules.
Sheriff. We need to talk ...  ... about him.
Why don't you go ahead and start the briefing? I'll be in in a minute.
Warrick Brown followed protocol. You cannot pin this mess on him.
You think I don't know that?
It's irradiated fetal pig. I used the tissue to determine the effects of radiation ...
Uh-huh. Then why are you here?
Oh, it is about perception, isn't it?
I work nights.
This is a rush case. Everyone's in the pool for 24 hours. Warrick, you need to see Robbins. Have him walk you through his notes on the autopsy. Nick, Sara, the Judge issued a warrant for Fife's vehicle. Detail is towing it back to our garage.
I don't know. But the knife and the towel are invisible evidence. The jury will never see them. So we have to find something that's visible.
I'll talk to your detective. Explain the deal.
I'm handing out assignments, Sara. It's not a negotiation.
Deadline's 4:00 P.M. Tomorrow. 'Once more into the breach.'
Got a print off this bottle I found in the garbage. It was the only bottle like it. None others in the apartment.
You could do the sheets.
We only found five knives in Rachel's kitchen.
Exactly. Weapon of opportunity, perhaps?
Doesn't look like it belongs on the victim or her sheets.
Stop it.
Watching the clock.
If you're watching the clock, you're not watching the case.
Yes?
Have you told Warrick? He's the lead on this.
He just shut you down. What is the substance?
What kind of wax?
Okay. Cross-check the product labels off the internet. And, uh, listen, if you need someone to talk to ...
... we have a psychologist here on Tuesdays and Fridays.
Look, we have no evidence that he raped her, no evidence that he killed her, and even if we consider the invisible evidence, it still doesn't give us enough to put him at the scene of the crime during the commission of the crime. Our trinity of evidence is incomplete.
The wax. What's-his-name is still analyzing it.
The exclusionary rule only applies to the person whose constitutional rights were violated. If we have another suspect, then the knife is back into play.
I'm sorry. You look lost.
Well, we get bad reception at CSI. Listen, if this is about dinner, I'm free next week. I'll be having the fish.
Well, the investigation, which is under my purview, has taken an unexpected turn. So, when I know something, you'll know something.
Me, neither.
No.
Checking my work?
What are you thinking?
Which would explain the transfer of wax from him to her.
Like this.
Which explains how the wax got from him to the sheets.
Go ahead.
Your application's on my desk.
Axion wax is industrial grade. It's sold to car washers for commercial use only.
Then, we need to know where he gets his car washed.
How do you feel about letting him walk?
Huh?
What, too much?
Well, I think you're right on time. There must be a press conference nearby, huh?
... purview?
You won't have to talk much.
For what? 
What about the drunk guy?
You collected everything at his house -- no evidence of Julie?
You want to take him into the next room, please?
Well, we all want the same thing, Sara. Catherine may have a way in. It could be helpful.
We're not finding anything. You said she was here.
Mr. Delhomme, we're going to take you back to the station.
Well, the public defender may have him out on bail by tomorrow morning.
Uh-uh. I'm the Senior CSI here.
I always have your back.
Hey, you set the stage. 
Well, let's find out if he is the guy first.
Greg Sanders. DNA.
Yeah.
Is there anything on these tapes?
He wants to know why you're working with young Greg. You could have had Warrick, you know. Or asked Nick to help.
Like when Fung brought in Mazzola? Everybody lost.
Could be. A trainee on a career case...
So they could take her home to provo.
Mmm, some of them do.
Multiple abrasions on her cervix.
So, it's possible he used a foreign object on her.
You did good, Cath.
How are things with you and Nick and Sara?
Unlike Robyn Knight, Julie Waters became Las Vegas' postmortem sweetheart. The media as moral conscience.
Thank God you're all right. 
Fixed ammunition in the trunk. The gunpowder must have heated up, and the, uh, rounds cooked off.
I believe the, uh, glass pressure traveled from the rear of the vehicle, through the front ...
... and evidently separated the driver's body at the ankles. 
I found 'em.
Well, the VIN number's still attached.
Here's press. You're on. Wish I could help, but, uh, I got a vehicle to process.
I'm not thinking. I'm just looking.
I located the seat of the explosion. The bomb was attached to the fuel tank. 
You really want to help, climb under here and find the initiation switch.
The digital clock was the switch.
It was time-activated.
Nick has to reconstruct the bomb.
Bomb was attached to the fuel tank.
Not yet.
Be sure to do an organics and inorganics test.
What does what all mean?
Well, the evidence is only teaching us about the bomb, not the bomber.
Nothing.
So, one of us needs to call the Sheriff.
Well, before we make that call, what time did the Air Marshal drive off the lot?
Well, the bomb went off thirty minutes later. It takes that long to get from here to the Orpheus.
Well, it takes longer than that to hard-wire a bomb. Which can only mean that the bomb was already in the car when it was returned.
Ammonium perchlorate.
Combination of the two creates an unstable mass. Both shock-and friction-sensitive.
Sheriff? What can we do for you?
Well, it's entirely possible that Mr. Watson was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.
Short in the wire.
We may never know when that bomb was supposed to explode.
Catherine, there is a volcano on the table.
Aluminum powder. Polyvinylbutadiene. Ammonium perchlorate.
Yeah, only my ants were Black Argentinians.
I learned at a very early age that the bugs always win.
Got to let it go Nick.
There were no vise-grips in the Dunbars' toolbox.
But given that the bomb and the volcano were similarly constructed ...
Not even close.
Mrs. Dunbar? Do you have a daughter?
Is she entered in the science fair?
Amy, did you use this the tool to work on the inside of your volcano?
When's your science fair?
Well, we'll do our best to get this back to you by Friday, okay?
Mrs. Dunbar ... how long have you known about Roger's double life?
It's very difficult for two people to live a lie, let alone three.
Really? So what changed?
Why a bomb?
When exactly did war become a party?
Gunshot residue, close range.
How'd they get it through the metal detector?
This was burned.
Another murder.
You're hot.
You're emanating heat.  Did you get her blood yet?
So many reasons.
Catherine, have you met Chandra Moore? She'll be doing DNA while Greg's in the field.
Well, not now-- too much work. You have a suspicious death at the Palermo.
Warrick, trash call at a weekly at Fremont and 12th.
Nick, Sara, body in a shallow grave, dry lake bed, in Ely, off Groom Lake Road.
Greg, you're going to be with me, your final proficiency.
We leave in five minutes!
Certainly. Have you been seeing your P.E.A.P. Counselor?
How's it going?
Mmm.
Are you sure?
Thanks, David.
This is your proficiency test, Greg. You might want to work the scene. What do you see?
Look a little closer.
We haven't recovered the gun yet, so ... ?
Good.
Don't worry about me; worry about you. It's going to be a long night.
Yeah. I just scanned it in.
What's this blue stuff on the slide and the grip?
It's okay to say you don't know, Greg. That's why we have a trace lab.
Herpes.
There was a prescription for valacyclovin. I cross-referenced the pharmacy logo.
Same kind of wire I found in the first victim's car.
Bring me the head of John the Baptist.
Salome -- wanted proof that he was dead. They didn't have Polaroids back then.
So, you like her?
So, Greg, how do you explain adhesive and toilet bowl cleanser on the gun?
You inspected the toilet bowls for evidence?
At a crime scene, Greg? 
You go across the street or next-door, somewhere other than the scene, until you've cleared the restroom. Did you clear the restroom?
Well, you could've flushed away evidence, wiped away fingerprints from the handle. Make sure you include this in your field notes.
Echoes of Michael Corleone.
He wouldn't. So what are you gonna do now?
Are you aware that your fingerprints are in the Federal system?
You both took valacyclovin as well. We found your prints on some duct tape in the women's restroom.
The duct tape was used to hide Manny's gun.
Congratulations. You got both.
You committed a fatal error, Greg. You compromised evidence at a crime scene. A judgment like that can cost us a conviction. In order to solo in the field, you have to successfully complete three proficiencies. 
Yeah. 
But ... 
Since you found a suitable replacement in the lab, I'm going to give you one more chance.
I count four.
She talks to herself.
Go ahead, Greg.
I'll be right there.
You okay?
I don't know, but I think our single just turned into a triple.
If they're taping now, maybe they caught that second shooting on video. Maybe you could collect the cameras.
It says 'forensics' on our jacket.
We had plenty of cops chasing the suspect.
Know how much you like my little fetal pig, so I'm giving him to you as an office-warming gift.
No.
See? You've been on the job for a week and you're already paranoid.
Hey, that's the job.
I once ran for president of the science club in junior high. Mary Hardy beat me out by one vote.
I'm not any good at politics. And it's cost me. It's how I lost Nick and Warrick.
Yeah. And at least they're in good hands.
Deerstalker cap ... violin ... meerschaum pipe ... even a Persian slipper with tobacco stuffed in the toe, I imagine.
All in all, a meticulous recreation of 221-B Baker Street: Residence of the world's greatest detective, Sherlock Holmes.
Ask Greg. It's his case. It's his final proficiency -- emphasis on the 'final'.
I didn't know you were a Conan Doyle fan, Greg.
Well, just so you know ... those movies never ended like this.
Anything useful?
Well, we all have our costumes, Jim.
I assume you're friends of Mr. Kingsley?
Well, I'm with the Las Vegas crime lab.
Not yet. This is a crime scene.
I guess it depends on what you find entertaining.
It would also be helpful if you'd let us take your fingerprints.
Elementary. So we can rule you out. You've all obviously been in the study on numerous occasions. We need to find out if the prints we find are relevant.
Shag tobacco.
That's what Holmes smoked.
You do have two suspects with pipes.
So, what are you looking for?
Was there any evidence of a struggle in this room?
Well, so much for the obvious.
Greg.
I have a question about your report.
According to autopsy, the victim showed long-term effects of cocaine abuse.
But according to tox, the substance in the victim's syringe was a seven percent solution of morphine.
The victim was an obsessive compulsive. In the stories, Holmes' preferred stimulant was a seven percent solution of cocaine, not morphine.
Did you ever consider the possibility that the victim didn't realize what he was injecting himself with?
You found the victim's fingerprints on the gun, but you found no prints on the surgical tubing, no epithelials either. Does that make sense if it was a suicide?
Do you have any other suspects who have access to morphine or surgical tubing?
I would do that.
Tobacco leaves. Run a quick comparison. This has to belong to one of our suspects.
I don't expect you to be correct in all your interpretations all the time. You collected the evidence. You thought there was something missing, you went back and found it. Hey, that's the job. Congratulations, Greg.
Sure.
Ecklie wanted to break up the team and he did.
And we didn't. Regardless, you should never have to cover for your boss. I'm sorry.
You, uh, completed your counseling, right?
And ... ?
Look ... let's, um ...
Right.
Hey! They told me you dug up two bodies covered in tar?
So. How you going to separate them?
I have an idea.
You've been spending too much time with Ecklie. I'm off the clock. I came in early for this.
Nope ... but I do know that tar becomes as brittle as glass at about minus two hundred degrees.
Well, let's see what our other one looks like, shall we? 
Huh.
Oh, boy. I gotta get my shift started. Good luck with the case.
You can make a nice mold from the impression.
I think Sara just wrapped a case. If you need her, she's yours.
Can I come in?
We both know that's not your problem.
I spoke to Catherine.
He wants me to fire you.
Sure. An explanation.
That seems to be happening quite a bit. Do you know why?
It makes a difference to me.
'Have you ever gone a week without a rationalization?'
It's from the 'Big Chill'. One of the characters explaining a basic fact of life -- that rationalizations are more important to us than s*x even. 
Why?
No, Sara.
I want to know why you're so angry.
Well ... the mind has its filters.
I don't believe that genes are a predictor of violent behavior.
You wanted to talk to me about Sara?
Well, I'm not firing her.
I've taken it.
You were. Now let me be clear. Sara's behavior is a direct result of my management.
But you won't.
She's a great criminalist, Conrad. And I need her.
What's an F-O-S?
Doors are locked. No key in the ignition. No sign of struggle or foul play.
Yeah, and evidently didn't take her where she wanted to go.
Red fibers and blue fibers on her dress.
A brown hair with a follicular tag. A person's entire identity balled up in a few nanograms of matter.
Well, genetically, it can. We're completely programmed as soon as the sperm hits the egg.
More or less.
I stand corrected. DNA is what we are, not who we are.
Yeah. Whether we like it or not.
Sexual assault?
Is this a burn?
This is Berber carpet, isn't it?
I'd like to take a small sample.
Just collecting evidence.
Or casual transfer unrelated to the case.
Baby powder on Lori's palms is consistent with the baby powder we found at the Kymans' residence.
Which contradicts the husband's account.
One problem. Mark doesn't have a car and the carpet fibers we found on Lori's clothing are inconsistent with her Lexus.
Hey, the rich are just as deviant as the poor.
They tell me it's my job.  You doing okay?
What about the fifth one?
Where is it now?
Sure. You did a nice job on the case.
Well, I've enjoyed working with you as well.
You mean Ecklie? You can't pay any attention to him.
Well, someone once said, 'What we are never changes, but who we are ... never stops changing.' 
Let's have dinner, shall we?
It's nothing personal, Catherine.  Cases like these rain down hard. You need all the help you can get.
So, Warrick?
We're standing on the weapon.
Well, he landed on his face, but it looks like his head got moved.
Well, then he didn't roll himself over.
Question. You come home, see your husband lying in the driveway. What do you do?
Or take the time to pull into the garage and park and lock your car?
Well, swab it and then check all their cars just in case.
Rectal insertions?
Drugs?
There's a lot behind the curtain of this guy's life.
Might've lived if he hadn't been rolled.
I'm glad you decided to stay, Sofia.
We just finished.
Well, look, I apologize, but this is a group effort.
Well, if the Wizard of Oz had nude photos of the wicked witch, Dorothy would have never lost her slippers.
Wouldn't be the first time that hate mutated into passion.
Oh, no, not again.
Well, how can that be? It was a secure scene.
We do have a problem.
Get back to the crime scene, Catherine. Get what you can.
Well, go quickly.
How do you explain a handprint half covered by a wall?
Think outside the rug.
Imagine the fear he lived with.
I think it did kill him.
Well, let's collect for now. We'll, uh, theorize later.
Nurturing?
Well ...  ... this could explain the repeated insertions.
What, you never had a transitional object when you were a kid? A stuffed animal or a blanket?
Seventy percent of children have something. Helps them with separation anxiety. 
Maybe Bruce Eiger never got over his.
Forever Baby. For the child in all of us.
Well, howdy. I was wondering, do you carry adult diapers?
Well, they're not for me.
Sort of. I was wondering, in your line of work, do you ever wear a uniform or a dress?
Excuse me?
I get it.
We're actually with the Crime Lab. We're investigating the death of Bruce Eiger.
Well, Freud had a somewhat different theory, but ...
You know, I don't think the department would let me expense it.
Count Basie said that it's the notes you don't hear that matter.
Something blocked the spray.
Could that be explained by her rendering aid?
I wonder what was going through his?
She watched him die.
You would've had to take care of him.
How'd you deal with it?
You're both psychiatrists?
LSD is in and out of your system in twenty minutes. But it acts as a trigger, which sets off cascading reactions in the brain.
The brain keeps cascading long after the drug is gone.
Strange drug of choice for a control freak.
Well, the whole point of having a 'mommy' is to have her do these things for you.
I've enjoyed working with you.
I did miss you. I missed your passion and your tenacity. I even missed your tush.
Can't convict her for cheerleading.
That's the point, isn't it? It's only the truly powerful that have the luxury to relinquish power.
Why not? Where would you go if you had the connections and the cash to go anywhere you wanted?
Eiger went further. He went all the way back to his childhood.
Hide beetle.
This guy's been here at least two weeks.
Number four buckshot, maybe?
What'd be the point of blowing someone's face off if you're going to leave their driver's license?
Weren't you on a 4-19 in north town? 
I'm just documenting, then I'm leaving.
Lot of animal activity.
Right between the numbers.
Casino W-2's. Looks like we got a winner.
Name tag printed at the Tangiers. Probably a convention.
So tell me about the body.
This table's cracked.
And we have what appears to be ejaculate.
And he got around.
Have Sara process the sheets, and then pull the hotel surveillance.
Bulbar hemorrhages.
Asphyxiation.
Well, that makes sense. We found him face-up.
Blanching happens when something's pressed against the area, displacing the blood.
So there was something on top of him?
Compression asphyxia?
Well, whatever it was was gone when we got there.
Maybe he used to be.
Something heavy killed our vic.
Listen, pass this photo around the registration desk.
Who knows. Maybe he did like big girls.
I'm going dancing.
Excuse me. Have you ever seen this man before?
Excuse me, ladies. Have you ever seen this man before?
Excuse me. I'm with the Crime Lab. Have you ever seen this man before?
I'm sorry. I, uh ... I noticed your lovely purple undergarments.
You did?  Thank you.
Excuse me?
Fine.  Regina, um, can I ask you, is this silk or synthetic?
How many sets of these have you sold?
Do they?
I'm not married.
No.
Yes, I do.
I'd also like, uh, copies of your customer receipts.
What time was that?
He wasn't killed with a pillow. C.O.D. was compressed asphyxia.
Maybe she's covering for someone else.
Yeah, but she's a liar.
Two hundred and forty pounds at the moment. We'll increase the weight incrementally until you can't move.
How's your breathing?
Okay, add another forty pounds.
Well, the position's consistent with the victim. Face up, right arm is pinned.
Oh.
Two hundred and eighty pounds.
A little technical reading, Greg?
Attraction is subjective. It can't be analyzed.
Someone who doesn't judge me.
Weird ... no sign of struggle.
Smells clean.
Ah, but here's the smell of the blood still, and all the perfumes in Arabia will not sweeten this little room.
Hand me my multi-tool, will ya, Greg? I need a Phillips.
Well, the stabbing was brutal, but the crime scene is clean. No cast-off, no spatter. So, I want to know if the killer washed blood down the drain.
Swab and phenol this, will ya?
Label it. Send it to DNA.
SAE kit?
Aren't they always? I don't know why people think that rape has anything to do with s*x.
What else?
Well done.
We don't usually run a panel for semen, Greg.
Wow. You guys are rendering me obsolete.
Maybe he's back in the game again, selling coke to out-of-town businessmen from the comfort and security of his hotel room.
Even cokeheads need a diversion now and then.
I'll talk to the judge.
Could you just keep him under surveillance for now, let Greg tag along with your guy? We might learn something.
It wasn't manipulated -- it was processed. That's what we do.
It's not my fault that the courts lag behind our technology.
Your honor, I need the warrant in order to find something else.
You called me?
That's it? A compromised wad of hair?
You sniffed it?
No, actually, it's the first time you've ever done anything to impress me.
Thanks, David.
Lucy, who else has access to your bleach?
Those your kids?
And the baby?
Is that your second wife?
So you must have had your vasectomy reversed.
You also have access to the bleach, so you won't mind if I take a DNA sample.
Mr. Michaels, in my work over the last twenty-five years, I've come to understand the kind of person who's a rapist-killer.
Well, a woman was murdered in your client's hotel. He has a right to hear our theory. The killer is clearly a psychopath. He's killed more than once. I'm sure that before his first rape and murder he fantasized about it for years.
During that time, he engaged in behavioral tryouts. Stalking women and attempting to coerce them sexually, each time moving closer and closer to the actual event.
I believe that after you consummated your first attack, you felt excitement greater than you anticipated. Your only regret was that she died too quickly.
But you took solace in the knowledge that, uh, you could do it again. In fact, your subsequent victim had similar characteristics to your first victim.
You see, what differentiates a psychopath from a 'heat of the moment' killer is forethought.
And you thought about this for a long time.
And now that we know where to find it, and we have your client on tape, I bet you we'll get a warrant.
Thank you.
Luckier than he was.
Low humidity, dry brush. Perfect conditions for maximum damage. 
Do you have a point of origin?
This area was always a good place for stargazing.
Sara! We've got another body.
Get the paramedics!
Hey.
What's that?
Or possible martini.
Well, that depends on how long it was distilled.
Ironically, the word for vodka comes from the Russian phrase zhizennia voda. 'Water of life.'
I hear our victim is still alive.
Well, she's not ready to let go yet.
The accelerant and the probable ignition source were found at the top of the hill.
But the victim was found, almost completely burned, at the bottom of the hill.
I don't think she was caught in the fire ...
I think she started it.
He's a trucker. Let me guess: He's on the road.
He was in the area of the fire an hour before the alarm went out?
Well, see if the store's got video surveillance.
Did you get an I.D. on our arson victim yet?
'Off-ladder' peak?
I learn something new every day around here.
Mr. Matthews ... when was the last time you saw your wife?
Do you have a lot of fights?
She's been in an accident.
How'd it go at the hospital?
You've pulled a double, Greg. You need a break. I'll process it.
Greg beat you to it. I got an I.D.
An 'off-ladder' peak. Like Tara Matthews.
We're working the same case.
There were several spots of high density polyethylene embedded in the fingers of Tara Matthews' right hand.
You know, some eastern cultures believe that fire cleanses the soul.
Yeah, but just having her DNA in the bed doesn't prove she was there for the murders.
And three people end up dead. So the critical question remains. If Morgan shot himself, then he's the prime suspect in the murders, but if he, in fact, was murdered, then somebody else was in the house.
You found a basal thermometer at the Stewart house?
I found one in Tara Matthews' vanity drawer.
Tara was.
Third-degree burns on most of her body and she doesn't miscarry?
Do we have any idea who the father is?
Okay, we know that Morgan and Tara were having s*x. The broken basal thermometer we found in the bedroom implies that she was trying to conceive with him, and not her husband.
... somebody she may have felt comfortable with.
The glass in Neal's shoe just puts him at the scene. We didn't find any blood on the clothes we recovered from his house.
Or maybe he didn't kill anybody.
There was no blood on her clothes either. At least nothing at the house. And the clothes she was wearing went up in flames.
I'm happy for you both.
We're slammed. Everybody's on a case.
Is this a Fiero?
People who drive $100,000 vehicles don't usually run away from them.
Tread-mark shapes indicate acceleration. 
Pedal to the metal. Maybe a getaway.
Hmm.
Well, at least we know one thing about the driver. 
He's had a face lift.
What are we, about three blocks from the crash site?
We matched his blood on the gearshift and on the headband I found in the alley.
It looks like there's tissue fibers mixed into it.
Tacos.
Hola.
Los carnitas, por favor.
Say, uh ... 
Have you had any trouble around here recently?
Didn't you file a police report?
Gracias.
Muchas gracias.
Jim, we need to go back to the hospitals. 
We may be looking for a burn patient. 
So you stole the Hummer for revenge.
I think this is the dumbest thing we've ever heard.
No last name?
Well, anyone who appears this narcissistic may prefer paying for hookers rather than wasting his love on a girlfriend.
We have a sample?
Very good.
'The Tell-Tale Heart.' I thought you didn't like reading the classics.
Tough shift, huh?
The police were sweeping the area looking for vagrants, trying to keep
Take a look at his nose. Same thing with his chin ... his elbows ... and his knees. He lost all his points.
Take a look.
Water pressure could have done it.
Well, at least we know where he came from.
No.
If you're gonna be sick, Greg, do it in the sink. 
Take a look at the trachea. What do you see?
No. It's a good analogy. 
Well, doesn't prove it. Same thing happens with, uh, heart failure or drug overdose.
Well, the tool marks appear consistent with each other.
What about age?
Teenager.
Bones are too degraded. No viable DNA, not even in the teeth.
Good. You're here. Fill this up for me, will ya?
It's a urine specimen cup, Greg. What do you think?
That took a long time. You may need a prostate exam.
Hopefully you are, 'cause I need a number two as quickly as possible.
The victim's body was found in a sewer. Ambient temperature 80 degrees. The corrosive chemicals caused the body to decompose faster than normal. I want to find out how much faster.  Today.
So what were you trying to prove with this door?
Well, Greg couldn't pull any DNA from the bones, so there's nothing to connect the victim to this anyway.
I'm not worried.  I'm concerned.
How are you doing with victim ID?
What's the most recent case?
... was misleading. Tissue in a sewer decomposes twenty times faster than normal. The victim could be missing as little as five weeks.
Take your time.
Isn't that high explosive?
Got it.
Hey, Rick, watch your step. This could be blood evidence on the floor.
He might have been dragged in here. Make sure you bag that stuff.
Uh, I think I have some evidence back here.
So grab what's important and get out now! That means you, too, Sara! Right now!
Well, I think at this point we can agree that the murder weapon was a knife. These are pictures of a box of knives that I was unable to recover from the Durbin Garage.
So how about the tool marks?
Well, it's appropriate. One way or another, they each had a hand in it.
Violent environment, oblivious mother, disturbed child.
Unconditional love between parents and offspring is biological, perpetuates the species.
He was wearing these clothes when you found him?
There was blood spatter all over the victim's room.
I'm not sure this is our guy.
Crazy or not ... here we come.
His brain tells him that what he's doing is real. He has no reason to doubt it. 
They asked John Nash how he could believe that extraterrestrials were sending him messages. He said that the messages came to him in the same way that his mathematical ideas did. So he had to take them seriously.
Did you pronounce?
Who isn't serious?
Can you tell me anything else about him?
Why not?
In this room? 
Is his name Ronald?
What's his name?
A cricket?
What's so amusing?
Is it you?
Do you know what happened to Robert Garson?
What?
s*x is the foreplay. Violence is the climax.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Well, you take that side. I'll take Jimminy Cricket.
Say ah.
Say ah.
You, too, Leon.
Exactly.
You find a license plate?
Pica?
Pica is a compulsion to eat non-nutritive food items. It's from the Latin word for magpie, a bird with a large and indiscriminate appetite.
Another OCD disorder.
So C.O.D. Was blunt force trauma?
During the struggle?
So evidently dead wasn't dead enough.
Restrained.
Nobody mentioned restraints.
And how many have gone unreported?
Good incentive to keep it quiet.
Yeah. Somebody who's crazy.
Body was found at 12:10. So sometime between 9:30 and midnight he was suffocated.
And not necessarily by the same person.
Could be from drooling. Or it could be from dying.
We got the DNA results back on the semen on Robbie's sheets. Patient Adam Trent -- the nail biter.
This stuff is dark.
Adam's subconscious was working overtime.
These are all postdated over a year ago.
It's not just his subconscious. This guy's got stuff buried everywhere.
Incest?
Oedipus' mother.
Always women?
So, uh, what can we learn from his artwork?
So, what should be safe turns into something unsafe.
Well, his nails weren't long enough to leave those tears in the pillow. And there would have been traces of blood from his cuticles.
Well, there's our blood splatter.
What is that on the crotch?
Where would Robbie get a picture of Adam?
I'm going to find someone who can open these drawers.
Oh, dear God.
Open the door.
Just open it.
Please open the door.
You sure you're okay?
If you want, I can have somebody take your place.
Really?
We didn't find any on his lips.
Excuse me.  Adam Trent was working on this piece?
Was this on the wheel while they were arguing?
Yeah. It speaks to me.
In the '60s, experiments were done on clay pots and painted canvas. Scientists were able to ferret out sounds that were captured during the creative process in the clay and the paint.
When the art therapist told me that there'd been an argument while Adam was on the wheel, I thought, well, maybe we can pull some sound off his pot.
Baby.
Robbie?
In her letters, Adam's mother called him 'angel.'
Well, jail or no jail, ...  -- I don't think she'll last six months. She'll die without her son.
I appreciate this. Everyone's out. I'm short.
She hasn't been dead long.
David, you want to take the, uh, jacket off her face?
What happened to you?
Usually when a killer covers the victim's face, it suggests familiarity. An act of contrition.
Great. Carjacked by a friend.
You go; I'll stay with the body. I'll meet you there. 
Well, that's small enough to be the weapon.
He could still be in there.
Did you hear the one about the cop and the monkey who walk into a bar?
Neither was the monkey.
Hmm. This is a .25 caliber.
We found a .22 in the victim's car. This just ruled that out as the murder weapon.
This could help identify the firearm.
This is an unusual point of entry.
Shooter would have to be standing over her.
So ... maybe she was kneeling.
Metals.
So you're saying our killer has metal balls?
Well, you can't track a static location. It has to be something mobile.
You were right. We found a GPS transmitter under the rear bumper of the girl's car.
Okay.
I got a problem in DNA.
First things first.
Well, it's unlikely that they're connected.
Cross contamination?
We don't have any choice. It's potentially all contaminated.  Document everything. 
Mr. Novak ... do you recognize this telephone number?
Did you write it on the matchbook?
Why didn't you write your name on it?
Why not your home number?
This is Alice Granger. Do you know her?
What else should we ask him, Catherine?
Yeah, but you didn't, so now I'm way behind. Is he telling the truth?
He hit you.
You have to recuse yourself from processing evidence. This guy's a lawyer. He could claim prejudicial treatment. Your whole life will become public record.
We all live in glass houses, Catherine. You gotta be careful where you take your shower.
Mr. Novak, would you stick out your tongue, please? 
Well, right now, it's about his tongue.
Open up, please.
Uh-uh. Once more.
Thank you. That's all I need.
You figured out the source of the contamination?
You have to collect everyone's swabs.
How long till the new shipment gets here?
I don't know, Catherine.
How many times have we heard a public defender say that?
I guess that's why I don't go out.
Surely, you jest.
Yeah, but the present value of college tuition is about the same amount.
I guess it depends on what you learn.
'For never was a story of more woe than this of Juliet and her Romeo'
So much for safe s*x.
And you're thinking 'pink' skin tones are a common effect of carbon monoxide fumes.
We'll need a sample of that vomit.
You're running point.
Hello, Conrad.
We had a one-hour recess -- I'm on my way back now. And this must be Mr. Billmeyer. I'm so glad he's back.
You might want to have Hodges analyze that cigar. Oh, and the print tech is free. He could, uh, spray the party hat with ninhydrin.
I love it when you wear your gloves.
I didn't.
Maybe it's a message.
Two heads are better than one.
Spatter patterns are a match. One bullet, two victims.
How 'bout that? Our mystery vics are identical twins.
Technically, it's the same.
I just got it. It's a certificate of honorary ownership of Trigger, 'The Smartest Horse in the Movies,' issued by Roy Rogers to the Children of America. Roy felt that the children of America were the true owners of Trigger, so any kid that would write him, he'd send 'em one of those.
The Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Museum, which used to be in Victorville, California, and is now in Branson, Missouri.
King of the cowboys.  I wrote to him when I was four. He sent me one of those. I lost it, so I thought I'd replace it.
Yeah.
Take a look at this.
This seems contrived to me. The blood pool is too perfect. There's no splatter. Like somebody placed these entrails.
Thanks, Conrad.
What about Nick's camera?
I don't think we're gonna get lucky with this guy. He knows how to work clean.
I want to know anyone who had a grudge against him. Civilian complaints, death threats ...
There was a guy a couple of years ago that stalked him. He may be back.
At least we have a general direction.
People use what they know.
Sara, what about the coffee cup?
What are you doing, Hodges?
What trace?
Let me do this.
The space in that box looks like 2x2x6, which would be 24 cubic feet.
That would hold approximately 600 liters of air. If you figure half a liter per breath.
Slow breathing ...
Maybe 12 breaths per minute. Panic breathing would be, what, twice that much.
Well, if the math is right, he's got about an hour and 15 minutes of air left in that box.
The guy probably picked the house at random, 'cause he knew we'd chase it.
Archie's trying to narrow it down. The feed stays active for two minutes every time you press the 'WATCH' button. But I got to go. I got people to see.
Your honor. Mrs. Stokes. I'm, uh, sorry that we're meeting under these circumstances.
Judge Stokes ... 
I don't think that will help.
We're not sure who has your son ... or why.
Very little.
From where?
Catherine, if the press finds out about this, it'll look like Sam Braun bribed the lab.
Yeah, well, so do I, but nonetheless ...
All right. But I make the drop. You're hands off.
You can't be seen anywhere near this money. It was given to the lab anonymously. Agreed?
Las Vegas Crime Lab.
I've got your money.
Yes.
Normally, you'd be 100% right, but this time, you're
It is real. Where is Nick?
Are you a terrorist?
Look, I really don't want to talk to you. Where is my guy?
Yes, he is. Where is he buried?
That's none of your business.
He blew himself up and left us with nothing.
Well, at least Nicky's keeping it together. That's good. What about the web cam trace?
Neither was the Styrofoam cup.
No, you never did, Nick.
What is -- ?
Wait a minute.
Ants.
My God, he's being eaten alive.
As much.
Oh, come on, pal.
Yeah. That's it.
Come on. Little more.
Keep coming. Show me what you're made of. Come on, buddy.
Gotcha!
Solenopsis invicta.
They're fire ants, very rare in Nevada. They don't like our soil. The only places you find them around Vegas are in plant and tree nurseries.
You said on the phone you had a fire ant mound. Where is it?
All right, look. Fan out. Look for loose soil. Anything that might've been dug up recently.
Short bursts, Greg. Don't suffocate him!
Warrick, Catherine's right. Get out of the hole now.  I know what we're gonna do. Just trust me.
We need 200 pounds of dirt over here right now, and we're gonna use that backhoe to get it.
Nick!
Can you hear me?
It's gonna take us a minute to get you out of there, okay? Nick!
Pancho!
Listen to me.
Put your hand on my hand.
Good. Now listen. There may be explosives under the box. They're probably set on pressure switches.
We need to equalize your body weight before we can pull you out, okay?
Pancho, nod your head if you understand me.
Okay, we're gonna use the dirt from the backhoe to equalize his weight.  I need a rope and a caribiner.
All right, Pancho, we're gonna open the lid and get you out, but I need you to stay lying down. Okay? Or else you'll blow us all up.  You understand that?
Do you promise?
Pancho, say, 'I promise.'
Don't move.
All right, bring that over.
Okay, Pancho, I want you to close your eyes and hold your breath.
Now!
Ready? Go!
I want my guys back.
I didn't.
Maybe it's a message.

Ready? Go!
I want my guys back.
Well, we're doing everything we can.
Did you injure yourself, Mrs. Perez?
That's a lot of blood. I'm going to need to take your shirt.
If you like, I can have someone follow you home so that you can change.
I'm just collecting evidence.
Nick, you failed firearms qualification. You can't be here.
Not in the field.
You're in violation just carrying the weapon.
What is that? Homework research?
I don't know. I bet you were a pretty smart seventh grader.
Sara. 
'I hate mom &amp; dad.'
Gil Grissom, Sara Sidle, Las Vegas Crime Lab.
What's your sister like? Personable, friendly, outgoing, trusting, maybe?
Uh, Daniel... you're bleeding.
They're the ones most likely to plan an abduction and find the privacy for sexual assault and murder.
Photos of children on his phone, including Alicia.
She's been all over the news, non-stop. It's that why you shaved?
Her friend tells us that you were always looking at her. You went out in the morning and watched them go to school.
How does a six-year-old act hot?
It's not a disease. It's a compulsion.
We found a pair of boy's underwear in your bedroom. Explain that.
So you fantasize, and eventually, the fantasy's not enough and you relapse.
Well, if that's true, then you were in a store where little children were shopping with their mothers.
Medroxyprogesterone is inconclusive. It renders the subject incapable of erection, but it doesn't remove the drive. You would still be capable of sexual assault using other objects.
How many people have walked through the crime scene?
We're going to need some time here, Jim.
Protecting her against insects and carrion, maybe.
Somebody, uh, wanted her intact. 
All right. 360-degree grid search. Sometimes rapists like to relive the event. He may have wanted to watch her. So keep the body in view. We're looking for shoe prints, sperm clusters ... anything else you can find.
Well, today's temp, last night's weather ... may have had something to do with it.
No defensive wounds. No wounds of any kind.
Well, she was wrapped in a bloody blanket. Since there's no trauma, maybe the blood belongs to her killer.
Roll her.
Look at those marks. There was nothing underneath her at the crime scene that, uh, would've made those.
Yeah, but there's, uh, two impressions, and they're too long to be a lug wrench.
Yes.
Where was she going?
Was she buying drugs?
Well, if enough people knew what was out there hunting them, they'd never leave their house. I think you need to sit her down.
Catherine, there's a big difference between scaring her and preparing her. And all the reasons why you should are in that room.
What is all this bone scarring?
Marrow harvest?
Let me ask you: What most likely causes shortness of breath, obvious bruising, sudden nosebleeds, petechiae?
Alicia's cause of death?
Time of death?
Which means April Perez was lying about the abduction.
Well, it's not unheard of. Have a baby, get the undeveloped stem cells from cord blood. New parents are even storing it now.
Well, Daniel must have relapsed because they took bone marrow twice.
A living DNA factory.
Where's Greg?
I need the tox results for Alicia Perez.
Menstrual?
Well, the volume of blood that was found on the blanket suggests injury or some kind of trauma. 
Run it again, please.
I just expect things to be done correctly, Greg.
You're right. What about the handkerchief?
Was your sister afraid?
But then your kidneys failed, and they broke their word, huh?
This wasn't a mercy killing, Daniel. This was an execution. Bone marrow, transfusions ... that's her blood in your veins. 
It dripped out of your nose onto the blanket while you were killing her. If you cared so much for Alicia, why didn't you take your own life instead of hers?
But you believe your God forgives murder? If that's your defense, it won't keep you out of jail.
For what?
Who's been inside?
Exterminators use sulfuryl flouride. It kills the bugs and then evaporates. Agro scientists call it the 'safety' fumigant.
Feathers.
What was he doing in here?
I'm making a bomb. Two bombs actually.
I'm making smoke bombs.
Ready?
One, two, three.
At one time, both houses must've been connected to the same electrical meter.
We found fumigant in Rory Kendell's urine. But he claimed he was never in the victim's house.
Exactly. But, he was telling the truth.
Can you describe the bird?
What motel?
Does it ever bother you that you make your living killing insects?
Teaching him to speak?
I'm looking for a macaw.
Has anyone tried to sell you a macaw in the last few days?
Well, I'm trying to locate a missing blue hyacinth.
Do you remember the buyer's name?
Mr. Beckman, um, died three days ago. We found these ... feathers in his house. 
Why is that?
Hello, Bob.
Look what I found.
You don't have to, Ted. We know why the caged bird sings.
As Lord Byron once said, 'In the desert, a fountain is springing.'
This is a pretty well-dressed crowd for this time of night.
You know, you might want to sneak some photos of this crowd.
Well, since water motion has no effect ...
Still waters run deep.
What about this abrasion?
Beauty is truth, truth, beauty. That is all you know on earth and all you need to know -- except cause of death.
Puncture wounds?
So she wasn't wearing it when she was stabbed.
La perla?
Lubricant and lingerie. I don't think the evening turned out the way she planned, do you?
When was the last time you had your pool cleaned?
Was Mrs. Keaton wearing this dress last night?
Did she leave alone?
May we take a look inside your house?
Well, by the way you've cleaned up, Mrs. Brady, I wouldn't even know you had a party in here last night.
What kind of party was it?
Mrs. Brady, would you join me in here, please?
Where are your other skewers?
Well, cleanliness is next to godliness.
You want the job because you're worried about Lindsay?
The position calls for leadership, Catherine. You have to inspire others, solve problems, which means you have to leave your own problems at home.
I do. Which is why I already sent in your A.P. I gave you 100%. I even put in a good word with the Director. The rest is up to you. And ... I hope you get it.
Is our victim represented?
Wife swapping.
Well, they're consenting adults, it's not illegal. At most, they only hurt themselves.
You think it was a crime of passion?
Well, they say they're happily married. 
Very good, thanks.
Hodges matched the water in Vanessa Keaton's lungs. He knows where she drowned.
Well, we matched the water in her lungs to your spa. And I see what appears to be a blood smear on the stone.
Well, we're going to compel a DNA sample, so we'll know if you were intimate with Vanessa Keaton.
Well, nothing new about this stuff. The Frescos at Pompeii were more explicit. The Kama Sutra and Decameron.
Hmm.
Here we go. Webcam photo. And she's wearing La Perla.
... and Vanessa doesn't have any moles on her torso.
Well, it can take a day or two after autopsy for the bruises to percolate through the soft tissue and become visible.
Any attachments?
Any reply?
Mr. Keaton, sit down, please. We're not done yet.
We retrieved this from the Cunningham's backyard. Your stepmother's blood is on the tines, and your fingerprints are on the handle.  
That's a long time to stand around and watch someone die.
No photos, no video.
And the kids must never know.
Well, thank you, Eva. I'm honored.
You make your own mulch?
'Xeri' meaning dry?
Thank you, Brian. 
Do, uh ... do you use scraps from the dining halls for your compost?
Well, if the devil requires a pound of flesh, this many maggots would require over a hundred.
Were you aware that the average college student weighs 135 pounds?
This stopped being about my curiosity the minute we found a human tooth. We're now investigating a possible homicide.
Maggot digestion can generate heat up to 125 degrees. Heat increases the rate of putrefaction, which speeds up the digestive process.
Assuming it's just one body? A few days.
Yeah.  Same size as these wood chips.
This thing always this loud?
You use it every day?
You think a human body could fit through there?
Gil Grissom, Las Vegas Crime Lab.
So the answer's yes.
May I?
Blood.
Yeah.
It's human.
Day shift told me you didn't get any results off the tooth.
I still need a DNA profile on our victim. 
I figured I'd go straight to the source. 
Thank you. 
He's back.
Any possible cross-contamination?
Not now.
Screw the press, 'cause for all I know, the dead body is an auto mechanic who just painted his house blue.
Why didn't Nick find this before?
So, now he's not just painting railings; he's installing them. We're going to need to dig this up, cement and all.
So, he knew we would find this. And now he's taunting us.
Planted hairs. It's part of his signature.
I tested the note with ESDA, because I saw some indentations in the paper.
What is that in the foreground? 
And the lettering's backwards.
So, he can attack her, abduct her, rape her and strangle her, but he can't look directly at her?
So, this is where he brought them.
Has anyone, uh, bought one of these coed cheerleader dolls in the last few days?
Well, I'm more interested in the clientele than the merchandise.
I'd like to take a look at your credit card receipts. 
Surveillance?
You know this artist?
You have an address for him?
How do you pay him?
Has he ever traded for ... a doll?
Can you describe him for me?
So, we still don't know who owns the van.
John Mathers?
So, our killer was driving around in Mathers' old van.
Did you analyze the comics?
Well, to invite someone to join you for torture and murder would require a great deal of trust. You would only do it if you knew you could completely control your partner.
Sexual sadism can go hand in hand with sexual dysfunction. Mathers said that he wasn't the killer, but we confirmed that he had s*x with Charlene Roth, based on the fact that we found his pubic hairs on her body.
Maybe life got in the way.
WLVU blue.
Take life, give it back. God-like.
No.
I was, uh, wondering what happened to your glasses. 
Is it?
Is that why you missed last year's anniversary?
Johnny?
Well, you, uh, kept him for several days before you chopped him up.
Tell us about Charlene Roth.
You miss him.
Thanks.
Where is, uh ... Brit Mosscoe?
Is she old or new?
So where's he taking us?
I'm going insane. I don't understand this diagram.
I got a 419.
Swing's tapped out. I'm the back-up. 
Good luck, Conrad.
Homicide
I was at a funeral across the street.
Thanks.
Hello. 
What floor did you want?
I wouldn't know.
Apparently not.
Oh, yeah ... You're pulling in when I'm pulling out. 
CSI-three, day shift. You work for Ecklie.
These rooms are just for whales and royalty. What's up?
Where's your kit?
And the position suggests she was grabbed from behind.
A night to forget.
It's his casino.
Oh, off the streets and out of trouble.
So what's the daughter's story?
So, she was bound?
Maybe some sort of circular device pressed against her face?
A-a-are you talking to me?
Do you always process like this?
With your mouth.
Hm ... I thought that's why we had cameras.
What?  Sorry. I was, uh, treating it like white noise.
Chicken cordon bleu.
Not really. If you're on your feet when you're throwing up, the vomit goes everywhere.
The higher you are, the wider the splash, right?
But ...  So she was probably lying down when she was throwing up.
Or already dead.
But that doesn't explain the bruise on her cheek.
Well ... may have started here.
Is this our dealer?
Well, maybe you just like getting your friends high.
You know, if the water is relatively still, submerged prints can remain for weeks, months, sometimes even years.
Thank you.  When we match your prints on this bag, you'll be charged with murder.
You tied her up and forced her down on the couch.
Grissom.
Good. We need to talk to her right away.
Have you decided yet who's going to be the day shift supervisor?
You should consider Catherine. She's earned it.
I'll get you a copy.
Definitely not synthetic. Medulla is 14 microns in diameter. Continuous cortex. Imbricate scales. 
Merino. Fine wool for fine fabrics.
I'm trying a new technique.
I have no idea.
Aniline dye. Most likely BASF or Dupont. Probably used by every high-end garment maker in the world.
You'll have to take their clothes.
I think we're done.
Well, the broadcast's out on Janelle and her car. When she turns up, she'll have to answer for it.
She was slashed south of the border, as well.
-- And it was a top-down night.
Profound how?
And, evidently, the killer kept subtracting.
Well, they don't call it an Adam's apple for nothing. A man with issues might become upset if he found one on his woman. Cause?
Time?
Mr. Laner, how long had Wendy been a dancer?
Sorry for your loss.
Who was Wendy grieving for?
This is confusing.
Impossible. No uterus, no period.
A match made in heaven.
Are we sure he doesn't know?
Aborigines say they dance naked to make the gods happy.
Did you ever see any transsexuals when you danced?
Do you know that Wendy was a, uh ... ?
Okay, lop job I get. What's a gaff?
So patients resort to Mexican pharmacies.
What about these other pills?
Yes. Today? The Apple Martini, one o'clock. I'll be there. 
Hello.
Thanks, but I'm still on the clock.
Beauty is a societal construction.
What was it you that you wanted to trust me with?
Do you know what happened?
What kind of tape, do you know? Blackmail? Pornography?
People confuse your obsession with sexuality as an obsession with s*x.
It's like the Guiterman poem: Amoebas at the start were not complex; But then they tore themselves apart and started s*x.
Do you know why?
So she talked to you?
May I ask the name of your therapist?
It's from Lepidoptera, meaning 'butterfly.' Walter Clancy started out a gender-dysmorphic caterpillar and turned into a bloody butterfly.
So you travel around the world treating the victims of sexual treachery?
By finding a doctor who would operate on her?
Which was?
Doctor, do you videotape your sessions?
Thank you.
Mercedes, I presume? We're with the Las Vegas Crime Lab, and we're looking for somebody.
I'm actually not interested in your ass, but the person we're looking for is a human butcher who might be.
The game is helping transgenders who have been turned down for surgery.
That may be why you're still alive.
Okay. What do you know about him, and do we have an address?
-- and photographed. You know what? I believe Dr. Lavalle ... is Dr. Benway.
We found your fingerprint there.
You've been performing surgeries without a medical degree ... doctor. 
How many Wendy's?
We need you to say 'ahh.'
I thought you'd want to know what happened to Wendy.
Show them an oyster.
There are two types of male oysters, and one of them can change genders at will. And before man crawled out of the muck, maybe he had the same option. Maybe originally we were supposed to be able to switch genders, and being born with just one s*x ... is a mutation.
Yes.
It was a hardware store. I entered through the back door.
The victim had been severely beaten. 
And our forensics determined that the murder weapon was a wrench.
Yes. I bagged and processed this wrench. My initials are on the seal.
It was in a toolbox under the kitchen sink at Garbett's Gourmet, which is a restaurant next to the crime scene.
Yes. We found trace blood in the metal grooves. And the DNA matched the victim's.
We found the defendant, Mr. Garbett's, fingerprints. We also found his prints at the hardware store.
Well, it appeared that the killer tried to cover his tracks by setting a fire, ... 
... a lack of sufficient combustibles may have thwarted his effort.
Yes. It's a matchbook.
Your honor, may I take a short break?
Yes, this is the matchbook I collected at the crime scene.
There's a fingerprint on this matchbook.
I don't remember it. It's not in my notes. 
The defendant's fingerprints are all loop patterns. This is an arch. It's not a match. This is not the defendant's print.
I've given them reasonable doubt.
The Middle East has a problem.
I'm trying to keep an open mind.
At the moment, I can't.
Well, the evidence seal wasn't broken. The matchbook's appearance is consistent with the crime scene photos.
Well, that's good, Conrad. You know, I can't recall a lab director as expeditious as you.
You okay, Bobby?
That's right. He blocked the alleyway with a dumpster.
They lost. There was no easement in their title.
All the physical evidence pointed to Garbett. And according to the victim's business partner, Garbett had an argument with the victim the day before the murder. 
I'm calling the forensics into question. 
Mm-hmm.
I remember the article. But I can't remember whether the variables in the test case are consistent with ours.
It doesn't match. So, you and Warrick take over the file -- make sure all of the other evidence is beyond reproach. Catherine, you supervise. To avoid any appearance of impropriety, I'm going to be hands off.
Sofia.
When you read from a computer screen, you have to lean in. I like to lean back. Therefore, I prefer a hard copy.
May. Yes. Thank you. News travels so fast around here.
Hmm.
Congratulations. That job requires a detail-oriented person.
I'd expect nothing less.
'Margaritaville'? 
That is still the lab's password, right?
I can't explain the appearance of the print on the matchbook. That's what I'm trying to figure out.
I don't know.
There's nothing I can do about that.
Poor Conrad.
Thanks.
Neil, you got a minute?
I need your expertise.
Well, good. Scientific discoveries arise through discourse. Now ... ninhydrin works by reacting to one end of a protein chain to form ruhemann's purple ...
Protein chains are made up of a series of amino acids, sometimes a hundred units long. But only one end of the chain has the h-n-H ...
But fingerprints are subjected to bacterial degradation, which causes the proteins to break down into smaller amino acids.
And making the fingerprint more visible. But because new fingerprints are sometimes composed of fully intact proteins, you could spray ninhydrin, and not see a result for months, yes?
My matchbook print was inside a plastic evidence bag. That could affect the rate.
So theoretically, the bag was acting as a humidifying chamber.
Thank you, Neil.
Regarding what? This case is over.
Theoretically, yes.
Isn't that a little beyond the scope of this inquiry?
Okay, Conrad, what do you got? Let's hear it.
Excuse me?
Wait a minute, Catherine applied for days.
Why are you doing this?
There's no reason to be. Look, Ecklie doesn't have a scientific bone in his body. He starts with the answers he wants and then devises the questions to get them.
Well, if a team gets used to doing things a certain way just because that's the way they've always done them, then they start to lose their effectiveness.
No. I believe that the longer a team works together, the stronger they become. But I'm not in charge of the lab, nor would I want to be.
Catherine?
Good.
Heracleitus once said, 'It is in changing that we find purpose.'
What about the male?
They were built to burn.
Get used to it, pal.
Catherine, we have a 4-19 off Industrial. Would you like to handle it?
I'm not a pervert.
Yeah, but even if you had, that would only explain the explosion in here, not the ruptured gas main outside.
Yeah, but where did it all start?
You get his photo from the DMV?
She coming in?
The pieces of debris that were on this guy's body were not heavy. But the bed he was lying in collapsed.
Let's photo-enhance these bruises.
Maybe our gas explosion just turned into a hit-and-run.
Detective Curtis.
I thought you were supposed to be arresting people in Boulder City.
Well, your mother would be proud.
You won't miss the lab, will you?
What about the blue paint scrapings we found on the gas main?
Right tires, wrong vehicle.
Part of a headlamp, maybe.
Except between the gas main and the trailer.
I think we're looking at the, uh, vehicular equivalent of a through-and-through. Car comes down the road.
Gas main acts as a ramp.
How bad does a smell have to get before Parking Control calls Homicide?
And a trunk becomes a crockpot.
That could be an entry wound in her skull.
Car condom.
Blue car. Broken headlamp.
Do we know where he killed them?
At least he's in the system with a double homicide.
Did you invite your wife?
I got one more thing to do.
If that 'okay' had been meant for Nick, it wouldn't have been in the form of a question. I think maybe Walter Gordon had an accomplice.
Male or female?
No. This is between you and me.
Is this an old photo?
Abduction.
Any other family members? Grandparents? Boyfriends?
They are.
Our K-9 officers are going to need something that Jesse's worn recently.
Pull the dogs back, please.
Can I see this jacket? 
Has Jesse ever worn this?
That's okay; we'll get something from your house.
How?
The Espositos told Catherine that they were at the park with their son the day Jesse Matthews disappeared. Is that a coincidence?
Could Karen have recognized the park from the pictures on the website?
But she reported him missing. That makes no sense.
So she does have a son.
And we're still looking for Jesse Matthews.
That's a heavy-duty antipsychotic.
You know, if she was being treated for psychosis, it could explain all of this, because she didn't overlook a single detail. I think she even did the finger paintings.
Yeah. After my dad died, my mom would still get him a present every Christmas. She'd put it under the tree. Christmas morning, the wrapping paper would be all crumpled up and, uh ... the tie or the sweater, whatever it was, would be hanging in their closet.
Nine.
He taught botany. He, uh ... came home from school one hot, humid day, laid down on the couch. I was watching TV. My mom brought in some cold drinks ... but she couldn't wake him up. 
No one would tell me why.
The GCMS soil analysis found cadaverine, putrescine and several other organic compounds.
It means there was a body buried in Karen's backyard. 
Even a small amount of that stuff would be lethal to a two-year-old.
We have evidence to suggest that the neighbor's dog ... 
... was digging in Karen's backyard. 
If Karen doesn't tell us where to look, I doubt we'll ever find the body.
Euripedes tried to understand it when he wrote Medea. 'I will slay my children without delaying long enough to hand them over to some more savage hand.'
Medea, like Karen, was a soldier's wife.
The floor is covered in hair. Has he got a cat or a dog?
These strands are smooth, not coarse. They're human. 
Yeah.  Evidently, this guy was shedding.
Well, we knew he was hairy. I didn't realize the full extent.
The human werewolf syndrome.
Great. The bearded lady, the dog-faced boy -- physical deformities as family entertainment.
Thank you, Al.
Yeah, I'm glad they're not looking at me.
Did you know the word 'werewolf' was derived from the old English word
Imagine if you had some deep, dark secret ... something that brought you tremendous shame. But instead of being able to hide it away, you had to wear it out on your skin, so that the first time anyone saw you, they saw your secret.
Yeah. Catherine said she's scared to death of people and what they'll think of her.
With that much hair -- be a lot of scarring, and a great deal of pain. Plus, imagine how expensive it would be. What have you got?
Catherine spoke to Allison. Their mother's dead.
Hey, Nick.
Bring her back here, will you?
I want to talk to her. Find out why a mother would play dead.
Mrs. Bradford, why does Allison think you're dead?
Easier than what?
Mrs. Bradford ... ?
So you moved to Vegas and decided to keep her a secret?
I'm sorry, but I still don't understand why she believes you're dead.
And she didn't go because she couldn't leave the house.
You thought it would be easier for her to accept your death than your abandonment?
I'm just trying to find out who killed your son.
You know, Mrs. Bradford, your daughter's all alone now. It's not too late for you to go back to her.
You can't get a warrant unless she goes on record.
Yeah, but Allison told you that Brent entered through the front door. The rock is extraneous evidence, isn't it?
If you have no qualms about filing the petition, then file it.
So if I tell you not to file it, you won't?
How many times have we been prevented from getting a warrant when we knew we had the right guy?
Right. So rock and roll.
Well, in my experience, I found that most threesomes end up being one too many. So, David, uh ... check and make sure that they didn't pull a Lorena Bobbitt. 
Take a look.
Maybe he wasn't invited.
Maybe he threw it, defending himself.
Not if she walks softly and carried a big knife.
The winner?
COD?
Like a cornada.
A cornada-occupational hazard for matadors during a bullfight. The bull rears up and gores them.
The killer could have wiped it off.
Maybe Ahern disarmed him and he grabbed whatever was handy.
How about that?
Got anything else?
Print it.
Yeah, sit down.
I heard that Kelly Gordon may be a suspect in your murder case.
Is that a problem?
But now she's dead.
So ... it's over.
Good.
The week Justin was shot and moved out.
When she started calling Tom again.
It's like thermite.
When you combine two seemingly harmless elements -- aluminum and rust -- press them together, add heat ... it creates an explosion so hot it'll burn through steel. Powerful but uncontrollable. It burns and burns until it burns itself out, finally consuming both elements.
Or nightmares.
Did, uh, Miss O'Neill tell you about this guy?
Well, the founding father has placed a high priority on home security. Have we been in there yet?
Moving target, maybe.
Thank you.
I sure do.
'Under-Sheriff Jeff McKeen. Arrival: 6:38 pm. Wife: Amanda. Recent accomplishment: Ran marathon for children's hospital, placed tenth in his age group.' Good job, Jeff.
Well, no one on this list came late or left early, so everyone here is still a suspect, until they're not.
Good. By the way ... Sam's here.
He's one of the guests who was out of the room when the murder occurred.
Miss Cherry?
I'm with the Crime Lab. I need to ask you a few questions.
Excuse me ...
Please?
Where did you go when Miss O'Neill left the ballroom early this evening?
Do you recall what time you came back?
Did you know the victim, Tim Duke? 
May I take a look at your handbag?
We can get a warrant, but you'll get out of here faster if you let me see the bag.
Well ... now I don't need a warrant.
Fingerprints are just oil, water and amino acids, Greg. They don't last forever.
'Ancient?'
Miss O'Neill! Nice to see you. What's all this?
Well, thank you. But, uh, we can't accept anything that might influence the outcome of the case -- it's our policy.
I know what we can do. Have your boys take it down the street to the St. Vincent homeless shelter. They need it more than we do.
By the way, Miss O'Neill, we made an interesting discovery under the floor of your bedroom. I was hoping you could tell us about it.
If you don't know anything about the money, maybe you know someone who does.
It's in our evidence vault.
We have to finish our investigation first.
Sounds like the bullet to me.
Heart stopped on impact.
Could the victim have crawled around after suffering that kind of damage?
Could the shot to the head have occurred first?
There's no blood in the wound track.
So his heart had already stopped pumping.
Lois O'Neill claims that she saw the victim crawling away after she heard the first shot.
Oh, no. She has a great memory.
Miss O'Neill, we found some inconsistencies in your account of last night's events.
You said that you saw Tim Duke crawling away after you heard the first shot.
According to our autopsy, the first shot paralyzed him. He would've been unable to move.
Just as soon as we finish our work, I promise.
Vanity, thy name is Hodges.
I guess we'll have to bring her in.
Sara and Catherine cleared the scene about two hours ago.
Nick just found out that Tim Duke's airline tickets were purchased by a credit card under the name of Double-X Associates.
How do you know that?
Huh. Well, Nick also found out that the only two names authorized to sign on that card were Lois O'Neill and Eve Girard.
She looks perfect, doesn't she?
On your own time, I hope.
And?
Also a match to the Pan Am heist?
Congratulations, Greg.
This is Doc Robbins' preliminary autopsy report on Lois O'Neill. When he opened her up, he found that her body was riddled with advanced tumors.
You read it. Do you think that's how she wanted to go out?
Yeah.
You knew she had cancer?
Why'd she ask Duke, not you?
Until yesterday.
I think that's actually an improvement.
Nine-nine-nine ... five-five-two.
Internal injuries maybe.
How'd the car end up in this position? It looks like she caused the wreck.
Well, either way, they left the scene, so it's still a hit-and-run. And this girl's dead. So, we may have a murderer.
Mid?
Most MVA's break down low or up high, don't they?
Might have found a few letters from the license plate. 'Y-K-A.'
No. Just behavior. But according to Ally Sullivan's father, she was the type of girl that might have noticed the license plate of the car that hit her. And according to her good friend, she preferred text messaging to leaving voice messages. She was dying, right? Disoriented? I don't know, but maybe she thought she was texting when in fact she was just dialing her phone.
Yeah. It's still a shot.
You know, as a kid, my grandfather used to have a rabbit farm.
Is this our Ford Taurus?
Did Brass run those tags?
So he burns the evidence near a junkyard so that they'll find it and dispose of it. Clever.
Professional what, though? Ally Sullivan was killed over a fender bender.
And he likes pineapples.
Good.
Thanks.
There was no reason to connect the two murders until ballistics matched the silencer we found in the desert with the gun you found at the Riviera Suites.
Yeah, right up until the point that Ally Sullivan smashed into his car.
How many guys got convicted off Nash's testimony?
Well, if this guy is a major case felon, then his prints are definitely in the system.
He doesn't have red hair.
Do we have 'In The Red's address?
Do we have her address?
I think you broke the case, Nick.
Uncuff him, will you, Mitch?
Palms out, please.
You killed two people.
Well, out this far, it's probably a body dump.
Yeah, but he had a choice.
Yeah, David, shoe prints, tire treads -- all they are is ...
Looks like she was branded.
Maybe she was undergoing some kind of medical treatment.
What's in this?
Abortion?
Infection?
They're all abscessed.
What, some kind of flesh-eating disease?
Maybe the puncture wounds were used to put something in, rather than take something out.
Good. I'll come with you.
Who's that?
Freud, Goethe ... 
Rilke ... in German. Briefe an einen jungen Dichter.
How do you know she was at Harvard?
This looks like an appointment. 'Betz, 11-12, 7:00 P.M.'
Heterochromia. It appears Zoe had one blue eye and one brown eye.
Hi. I'm so sorry about your loss.
I'd like to know some things about your daughter. When was the last time you saw her?
So you weren't in contact with her?
Can you tell me why?
Did she have any medical conditions?
Because in November, she participated in a medical study at the Betz Clinic. Right after that, she went missing.
In the desert.
Off highway 55, near Sparks.
How many other people in the sleep study?
Zoe's car was found at an impound lot downtown. It was towed from Betz's parking lot on November 15th.
With Captain Jack?
'Left early' seems to be a euphemism.
Are you and Mr. Wolfowitz acquainted?
Why were you at his house?
Is that why we found this etching in your handbag? You were stealing it?
Why?
Which are?
However, if he refuses to press charges ...
Someone with something to hide.
Why, uh, steal this?
So?
So you think he stole it?
Even if all this is true, we still don't know if he killed your daughter.
You have to stay away from him.
Is that an acidic compound?
So it is from a manuscript? 
Even if this tests positive for DNA, I'm gonna need the book to match it.
Rambar checked the rare book collections. This guy likes to steal in his own backyard. UNLV library is missing plate 62. It's enough for us to get a warrant.
I guess I didn't need a warrant.
No signs of trauma or blood.
He's wet.
Looks like he's in rigor, which means he's been dead for at least six hours.
Still frozen? 
How long does it take to freeze an entire body?
Over the glands, too?
Test subject #1.
So what? They dunked him in liquid nitrogen? Cryogenically froze him?
You've got to find some explanation.
What are you doing here?
I'm listening.
And you didn't want him to screw it up.
Did she have her baby?
How did you get this?
When did you ...
He's already dead.
He's been dead for two days.
Her hand.
Thanks.
Revenge is an act of passion.
Who?
Looks like Wolfowitz, only younger.
Identical twins.
Same DNA, different prints. So all the DNA that we attributed to Wolfowitz, could be Sneller's.
Occam's razor, principle of parsimony. If you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not zebras.
Well, this isn't a torture chamber, it's a time capsule. 
Well.
It appears he was meticulously documenting experiments. This one looks like it deals with craniometry. I think he was measuring skulls to determine intelligence.
Work will set you free. These words hung over the gates at Auschwitz.
No numbers.
This one's dead.
Have you guys secured the entire perimeter? The house and the barn?
Heather! Stop it!
You cannot do this!
No! 
Stop.  Heather.
I'm saying stop.
Is that someone in custody?
Have you told Nick and Sara?
So the next time this someone uses the credit card ...
Thanks for coming in, Larry.
Nick, try the unsharp mask.
That's Tad Sidley.
Is this video from today?
Well, if that's Tad Sidley, who's in the morgue?
Is the chimney guy still in your drawer?
Tad Sidley is alive. We assumed that this guy was Tad, based on a gym membership card we found on his body -- we were wrong. This guy is now a John Doe.
Not yet.
Video cameras. That's good for us.
What is this?
There's too many forensics shows on TV.
So she might have known her assailant.
A long night.
Some date.
Some kind of white flaky substance.
This looks like blood, but ...
So she wasn't tied up with the maintenance man's tape.
What about the rest of the trace?
And the yellow reflective flakes?
Yeah, the, uh ... ex-boyfriend didn't match any of the prints on the duct tape, either.
Which means that he probably raped her on and off, for a long time.
I didn't find any prescription bottles in her apartment.
Well, it usually takes an hour for a drug like that to kick in. How did he subdue her in the meantime?
Someone who knows it's coming.
A foot fetish is a visual pathology. The suspect would have had to be close enough to the vic to see her toes and then get aroused.
Albert.
Did you find the blood sample I called you about?
I need a test for lorazepam.
You recall any other sexual assault victims that tested positive for lorazepam?
Thanks.
Sure, they do. They both have feet. We may have a third victim who may also be our first victim. Tara Weathers. Last month, she claimed she was drugged in a bar and woke up in her apartment with her toes freshly painted. They did a tox on her at the time. Found lorazepam in her system.
Yeah. So the pattern starts a month ago. Our guy drugs Tara Weathers in a bar, takes her to her apartment, paints her toes, leaves. Two weeks later, he steps it up.
Yeah. And now he's escalating.
The truth is if there isn't any evidence, we have nowhere to go.
Yes, I do.
Everyone learns from science. It all depends on how you use the knowledge.
How could I forget that?
Wait, I'm confused. You left and then you came back?
Greg?
I thought I paged Warrick on this.
Because?
Huh. Hello, David. What do you know? 
What's in the back room?
Where did you say your expertise comes from?
Okay. What am I thinking?
I'm thinking you should focus on your other five senses.
Connected to the blood pool?
Would it surprise you if I had?
Surprise. So go ahead and run it for me.
Well, if it was a robbery, why'd they trash the place?
Go on.
They didn't take her purse.
Power of suggestion, Greg.
What did you find?
David said she was running hot.
Al, when someone sells love potions and magic spells, the only visions they see are dollar signs.
Five right 44, consistent with a Smith &amp; Wesson, but no hits in IBIS.
And remind me again why you didn't show up at the crime scene?
Well, you should have cleared it with me. And by the way, you're still on the case.
That's okay, 'cause Warrick is now backing him up.
I'll do what I can. What about the cash register?
We've got it covered.
A favor for Brass.
I'm not sure yet.
Thirty-seven actually.
Where are you and Lindsay going this year?
Quality time with Dad? 
Have fun. Say 'hi' to Sam.
Good. I have one more for you.
He's a person of interest.
Watch this again.
Right when he mentions Summerlin.
Yeah?
Yes.
That places him at the scene.
Were the other ones Greg's?
Why was he behind the counter?
I need to talk to you.
I hear about everything, Greg.
We have one more lead to follow up before we call this a slam dunk.
You ever been to the Sixth Sense Occult Shop?
I don't know how. Glass breaks all the time. It's not a unique event. Plus, he admits to being in the shop, which accounts for his prints.
Well, he'd only kill her if he also killed his wife.
That's a metallic signature. This could be the abandoned septic tank.
Mrs. Wallace, I presume.
Hey, Greg.  You missed some.
It's too small.
Did the Wallaces have a kid?
Claire Wallace did have a dog.
It's a wire.
Any chance at an ID?
Dental records?
Cause of death?
If we can ID the dog, it'd at least give us a compelling argument that the body found was Claire Wallace.
So, we re-focus on Sedona Wiley?
Greg's suspect, Damon Mitchell, claims that she tried to extort money from him.
Maybe he went there to intimidate her.
Yeah, he also said he didn't murder his wife.
Our warrant also includes your shoes.
May I take a look at your wallet, please?
Because I can.
You didn't make a purchase at that shop, did you?
Gold flecks ... similar to the substance we found in Sedona Wiley's cash register. 
Yeah. Maybe you should ask Nana Olaf to contact her, see how she's doing.
I agree. The problems arise when people mistake their beliefs for the science. 
I've been reading her notebooks.
Take a look at this.
Sedona said Claire Wallace was 'In Summerland,' not buried in Summerlin.
Pagans believe it's a mystical place where souls go to rest before they reincarnate.
Because he was desperate to solve the case. Then when Wallace heard Summerlin ... he assumed Sedona was the real deal.
Dirt clods on the floor mat look undisturbed. Could be from the last fare. I don't see any shell casings, though.
Well, I got two bullet holes in the passenger door.
Maybe he wasn't shot here. Maybe he just ended up here.
Excuse me?
Are you with the Transit Board?
Do you have the dispatch log?
Thanks.
It's Gil. How you doing?
Why would I need to do that?
Look, I know you tend to get a little territorial about your crime scenes, and I don't want there to be any tension between us, so I'm giving you fair warning.
Hi.
The taxi's last drop-off was this address. This guy's got dirt on his shoes and pants. There was dirt in the cab. He's got to be the last fare.
Well, I guess it's relative.
It depends on who you are.
I count six shots in his chest. There were two in the cab, one in the cabbie. If the math is correct, that's nine.
Yeah, there were none in the taxi, either.
To shoot a guy six times in the torso, you either have to be very close, or a hell of a shot.
Yeah.
Hang on.  What do you make of that?
We got blood drops.
Hey, Brass?
That would account for all the hits.
Weird, huh?
The cab drops Samay Thao in front of this building.
And the position of the blood drops gives us a pretty good idea of where Samay was standing when he was shot. He was a little shorter than me.
My guess is, the cab was parked down there. 
The driver peeled out when he got shot.
The pellets must have come through the screen.
The old billiard ball effect.
Easy for you to say.
Take a look at this. Gravitational pooling directly under the steering wheel.
Except he wasn't. Take a look. See this? 
If he'd have bled out in the position he was found, there'd be blood on the door, not under the steering wheel.
There was plenty of mud at the scene, and Samay had mud on his pants. Now, maybe we can match soil samples.
We already know their IDs. 
Samay and Noy go for a drive after work.
They stop at Mount Charleston.
Samay kills Noy ...
... and makes it look like an accident.
And then he goes to Keo's apartment and Keo shoots him, claiming self-defense.
Which indicates that Keo knew Samay was coming.
Well, that's not lost in translation.
The guy's barely scraping by, and he spends $250 on a brand-new Mossberg?
And?
Strangled himself to death to enhance his own pleasure.
It was in the days of public hangings that people first noticed that men would get erections and sometimes even ejaculate. They called it 'The Killer Orgasm.'
Yeah, look where he ended up.
Feel like getting high?
Nine-millimeter shells all over the place.
What do you think? Time of death: 3:17 A.M.?
Well, if it's a gang war ...  ... these kids were outgunned.
Standard procedure for a drive-by is shoot as much as you can as fast as you can, right? Then leave as fast as you can. So why did Morris get out of the car?
They were packing posters.
Maybe for what was on them.
Well, you got the staple gun. Figure out what they stapled.
We need to get their faces out in the public -- newspapers, billboards.
Yeah. I'm pretty good at mouth-to-mouth.
You said Dante works for Dollar.
He's a fan. Why would he humiliate someone he respects?
So ... get personal.
I'll talk. You guys just look apologetic.
Just this: Even if we recover the vehicle, the chain of custody has been broken, so all the evidence has been compromised. 
No judge will allow any of it to be admitted into court. Also, we released the crime scene, so it, too, is compromised, leaving us nothing to go back for.
Internal Affairs Bureau is coming to take our statements. They'll want to know what's been lost. So let's not make ourselves look any worse than we already do. Write down everything -- evidence collected, interview notes, etc ... every detail. No one leaves until they've given their account of the event.
Not good. Fatelli was handled by the day shift. Let's pull the file.
I have mine, but they're only of the ballroom. But every wedding these days has a videographer. We got to get the video.
Yeah, well, it's all about the body now, David.
So she might have been unconscious, but she was probably still alive when she was tied to the car.
When would she have had the time?
Spring is but a song, where love and laughter are not wrong. The blossoms of desire do belong, and harmonia axyridis fly along.
Would like to be more specific?
Are you trying to make me think that you didn't kill her?
That's a tight schedule. She would have barely had time to go to the bathroom.
Egg whites, sugar, butter, milk, food coloring.
Butter cream frosting. She had an incident with wedding cake. 
Are you done?
Would you close the door, please?
From the other side.
You paged?
Did you know the original role of the bridesmaid was to act as a human shield against the bride's enemies?
Anyway, let's start at the beginning, shall we?
Lovely. You should know that while waiting for IAB, we recovered the car and solved the case.
Okay.
I don't think it matters. I'm sure our stories are all the same.
Neck contusion.
Any ID?
Palermo room key.
He's got some kind of transfer on his pants.
I don't know. But the party's over.
Same down here. So whatever it is, it must have been wet.
That doesn't narrow it down much.
I'll have Brass put out a broadcast. Nick ran the vic's credit card.
I'm not telling. And stay away from my tinfoil.
Mr. Sheridan, can you tell us anything about this girl?
What kind of work did he do for you?
Did Jeff have any nasty habits?
We found several different drugs in his bloodstream.
Fun, huh?
My name is Gil Grissom; this is Sara Sidle. We're with the Crime Lab.
I get it. You're one of those companies that stages fantasies, right? Everything appears real, but it's all been worked out in advance?
And, uh, Jeff Powell's evening -- the girl, the car, the billiards -- all paid for by Mick Sheridan? 
Somebody rich who likes to manipulate people probably.
And his murder?
Some guys are intimidated by beauty ... 
... or fear rejection. Evidently, Caprice knew Jeff well enough to know he'd want to help her.
Sheridan told Caprice that Jeff had been shooting pool since he was a kid. So betting on and winning a big money game was probably just part of the fantasy.
So the staged fantasy ended at Jeff's hotel room.
Which means he was off script when he was killed.
The victim got to the shopping arcade fifteen minutes after he got off the elevator. It's not that long a walk. I need to know what he was doing during that time.
Whatever he's reacting to is off camera.  Somewhere in the direction of the baccarat tables.
What's going on over there?
He's playing solo with the dealer. That's ten or twenty thousand a hand. Guy's a whale.
You know, Heidi was only supposed to tell a story about a high roller boyfriend. Maybe she actually picked somebody out.
What are you doing?
Well, call me Ishmael.
You need to read more, Arch.
Jeff was a winner at everything he tried that night.
Which may help us harpoon the whale.
Are you familiar with this guy?
Just before he died, he was talking to you.
We'll just hold your men until we get a warrant.
Kamsahamnida. 
They did: Don't confuse fantasy with reality.
I think fantasies are best kept private.
Where's the husband?
There's no other signs of disturbance in here. What about the rest of the house?
How many domestics have you seen where someone got shot in the face and nothing else was disturbed?
That you married people take things too personally.
Assuming the husband had s*x with her and then murdered her, he went from amorous to murderous in near record time.
What about the bullet?
Explains why Warrick couldn't find it at the scene.
This was somebody who was emotionally close to her.
Once. When I was younger. Her name was Nicole Daley. I asked her to marry me. We were classmates. She liked bugs, too. I gave her my grandmother's ring, but my mother made me get it back. 
Second grade.
Well, he's got a bullet wound and a dead wife. For now, the evidence says he's a victim.
Willie had a vehicle-related felony on his record, too.
'Requested destination -- Lucky Dragon casino.'
You know, this could be a revenge story. Willie gets a life, Sammy goes to prison. Sammy gets out, tries to get even.
He's his brother's keeper.  It's in the Bible.
So, Willie tried to make it look like he was shot.
Grabs a ball point pin, drags it across his ribs.
Don't know. We'll find out.
Serology.
Lattes crust method for determining blood type.
I need it faster than DNA. And I don't need a full profile anyway, just ABO type.
Don't you have something better to do?
I keep some in my fridge for emergencies.
I don't keep tequila.
Jim, you have to bring in Willie Cutler.
We found high velocity spatter consistent with the wife on his shirt. He was in the room when she was shot. He could have been holding the gun. Maybe they were working together.
Yeah. Maybe he's got unfinished business there.
Willie Cutler's marker was signed by a blackjack pit boss; this is last night's surveillance.
Yeah, that's about a $10,000 marker. Casino owed him money; that's why Willie went back.
I haven't seen him.
Jim? Sammy Cutler's dead. He died in a car crash in Mexico two months ago. Willie had to know. He's been playing us.
Any neural damage?
For, uh, medical purposes, I have his power of attorney.
Okay. 
DB in Henderson on the train tracks.
Pretty bad. They're trying to stabilize him.
Well, if scavengers nicked his clothes, they left a nice pair of riding boots.
Great.
Well, we don't know how far he was dragged. Where's the head?
Hey, Nick?
I think I found a toupee. Our vic may be bald.
What a waist.
David, are you getting the liver temp or performing acupuncture?
What do you think?
Well, he died with his boots on.
So what? Torture or self-inflicted?
I'm beginning to sense that COD was not decapitation.
It looks like lead. .44 caliber is my guess.
What are the options?
What are the risks?
And without surgery?
What are the odds?
Do it.
Ellie, this is Gil Grissom from the Las Vegas Crime Lab. I'm a friend of your father's. 
I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but your dad's been shot. 
And his condition is serious. 
I think you should come and see him. It would help him a lot. Please call me at 702-555-0141.
They're prepping him for surgery.
Where's McKeen?
We've worked together ever since he came from New Jersey.
We don't 'hang out,' Greg.
Excuse me, Ellie?
I'm Gil Grissom. Thanks for coming.
Probably a few hours.
No.
You know, there's a motel just down the street. I'll get you a room.
I'm okay.
Corset-training. A venerable practice.
In Victorian times, it was considered a staple of masculine attire. Students in British boarding schools were encouraged to lose an inch a year from the time they were 14 on.
Mmn. 
It's called a wasp-waist, which is revealing. A wasp is from the insect group hymenoptera. The notion of hymen indicates virginity. In predacious wasps, the genitalia no longer function as a reproductive organ. It's used as a stinger. 
The victim was shot, body dumped, clothes burned.
I have my sources.
How's he doing?
This fellow seems to have lost his way.
You into military history?
You were a lucky girl. 
Pickett's charge, I think. The Confederates advanced from this position to Cemetery Ridge. They marched to their doom, but kept their honor. Carson obviously was a son of the South. 
Well, he was into discipline and self-denial.
Seems to run in the family.
And real bullets?
Colt .44?
Is that your dueling pistol?
We're going to have to take that with us.
I, too, demand satisfaction.
Ready.
I got something here, too. This could be the blood that we didn't find at the train tracks -- it's a lot of blood.
Maybe Carson was killed here?
It sounds like you already are.
Thank you, Nick.
Did you compare the bullet from the victim to this pistol?
And you know this how?
What is that?
So he's a cereal killer.
Which would be perfect for Civil War re-enactments.
No.
Well, I'm sure he'd appreciate the offer, but I don't think he'd want you to do that.
Hi. Come in. 
This is your dad's office.
Have a seat.
Why not?
That's the reason we asked you to come in.
Hey. Have some water.
Your, uh, fan club is here.
I don't know. Most people want to die in their sleep, I suppose. Never know that it's happening. 
Like a crime scene. Surprise, you're dead. I'd prefer to know in advance that I was going to die. I'd like to be diagnosed with cancer, actually. Have some time to prepare.
Go back to the rain forest one more time. Re-read 'Moby Dick.'
At least have enough time to say good-bye to the people I love.
And, of course, you walked through the house.
The Red Sea's not red, David.
This girl's head and spine are perfectly aligned.
Led Zeppelin, 'Stairway to Heaven.'
Becky Lester. Catherine and I got here a half an hour after her husband called 911.
Coroner won't touch the body till Catherine and I are done processing around it, so, Sara, would you please go up the front stairs and work your way down the back stairs?
Warrick, could you process the blood evidence from the front door to the back stairwell? And if you'll notice, she doesn't have any blood on her feet.
Nick, Brass is in the study with the husband and he's waiting for you.
Well, that's consistent with the fall.
Medium spatter. Suggests impact with a blunt object.
It is a low ceiling. Pretty hard to swing a weapon.
He's a good sleeper.
That's a good observation. What do you got in the bag?
That's odd. A man and a woman who don't share a bedroom arrange to have a night alone, send their daughter to a relative, go out to dinner, have drinks by the pool, but they sleep in separate bedrooms.
Or maybe they were suffocating each other and he couldn't breathe.
I'm going to go see the doctor.
She probably chomped down on it when she hit the stairs.
Yeah, I'm mostly interested in cause.
Are they consistent with a fall?
Are they consistent with blunt force trauma?
And there are none.
Well, you've given me a lot of information, doc, and none of it very helpful.
Robbins said the vic bit her tongue. Theoretically, she could've expirated the blood on the wall, providing an alternative explanation for the medium velocity spatter.
Do me a favor, check it out.
As she tried to get up, she expirated the blood on the wall.
She failed to regain her footing, impacting her temple ... 
... and then she bounced on her occipital bone.
Yeah, if we ever find a murder weapon, my theory's done.
Wait. She had a stroke on a stairway. Robbins told me. Is that the autopsy report?
How does one 'look' guilty?
That's too soon.
Preliminary investigations suggests foul play, but we've got nothing definitive until she's fully posted. And the physical evidence in Becky Lester's death is completely ambiguous.
I don't think that yet.
No.
Okay.
Huh. I wonder what he needed the money for.
For the record, I think you're filing prematurely.
Actually, it does. The Empire State Building gets struck twenty times a year. 
No, you're just in time. Ms. Willows, would you bring Mr. Sinclair up to speed?
Based on what?
We don't have any evidence to support that.
Couple got home around 10:00 P.M. They went outside and had some tequila. At 10:08, Ray's daughter from his first marriage phoned. Becky went inside to take the call. 
It's not in Brass's notes.
The office was away from the crime scene. We, uh, checked it for a murder weapon, but that's about it. I'll get an investigator over there. Unless you're in too much of a hurry.
You know, I guess this could explain why Becky's skull was lacerated and not fractured.
She doesn't seem to blame herself for ending it.
Did you catch that?
Curious. You want to talk to the dad and I'll call the DA?
The Orionid meteor shower. You never get a view like this in town.
No. But we're here, and it's beautiful.
Footprints going in both directions. They came and they went.
Maybe they had an appetite for murder.
About 25,000 square miles.
But I got water. We can share.
I count five distinct treads: boots, shoes, sneakers. Drag marks are always right in the middle -- thin, parallel lines.
Who doesn't?
You ever seen the Pyramids?
I'd like to see the Pyramids one day.
Oh, yeah. Whenever I want to feel small.
Smoke?
You hear that?
This looks like some sort of observation post. Maybe used to monitor nuclear tests.
Well, we got two choices: Go back ... or go forward.
Las Vegas Crime Lab! 
I count eleven.
And number twelve is missing. Maybe that was the guy we found in the yard.
Well, unfortunately, we're not the ones who need the help.
The mythology here appears to be similar to the Heaven's Gate Cult in California several years ago. They committed mass suicide to shed their earthly bodies and hitch a ride on a spaceship hidden in the tail of the Hale-Bopp comet.
Well, Jim Jones and Charles Manson used s*x to manipulate their followers. I'm guessing they were timing their ascension to the Orionid meteor shower last night?
There's twelve bunks in there, one bed in here. There should be thirteen bodies. One prophet, twelve apostles.
Maybe they caught the spaceship.
3:15 A.M.?
That's when the Orionid meteor shower passed over Vegas. Ask him if they all died about the same time.
No. But something sure smells good to them.
Are you having the same mirage I'm having?
Well, you can sure smell what the buzzards are after.
Something tells me this wasn't a suicide. Like this tire iron-- convenient weapon of choice.
Which I believe makes that body our number one suspect.
Well, we found a tire iron at the scene.
What about TOD?
What about relative to the other bodies? Did he die before or after the others?
So what are these?
Are there enough pills in that bag to kill 11 people?
And from what we know, Diamond was a con man, not a murderer.
So who brought the ketamine to the party?
Abigail?
Yeah. Just in time.
Are you disappointed?
Well, how come you didn't die with your friends? And why exactly did you kill Mr. Diamond? 
We found your fingerprint on a tire iron that was used to split his head open.
But you didn't tell them, did you?
And fortunately, you knew where to find something a little stronger than zolpidem?
Ty Bentley suffered.
And as you said, you were on a schedule. The peak of the meteor shower was 3:00 A.M.
And then you went back to the compound ... and you used the funnel to distribute the ketamine and vodka.
Did you watch them all die? What was it like?
And you went home to your mother.
Abigail ... I'm sure if there is something out there looking down on us from somewhere else in the universe, they're wise enough to stay away from us.
Well, maybe the killer brought his own pen. Or took it with him as a souvenir.
Looks like forced entry with a metal object.
Ecklie.
No, he just wants to yell at me because I'm late with the personnel evaluations. It can wait.
Mm-hmm. I'll do them as soon as I get back to the lab.
What are you doing here?
Why?
Thanks.
Conrad. Sheriff. It's always lovely to see you fellas, but I'm right in the middle of a crime scene.
Yeah, I know.  She was a friend of yours. I'm sorry.
Well, they say it's a slam dunk case.
Then what am I doing here?
He's a gun for hire.
And you want me to refute his testimony?
When does he take the stand?
I'll do my best.
Mm-hmm.
Well, he's still got to prove his timeline.
Have you seen this tape?
Send everything over to the lab. I'll be there.
Well, according to my experience and all three of these textbooks, the P. Regina would develop from egg to puparium in eleven days.
Yeah, but his demonstration speaks for itself. There's no visible puparia for fifteen days, just as Thayer asserts.
The science in these textbooks is sound, but the tape is more than enough to get reasonable doubt.
I've reviewed his documentation. He purchased the pig from a reputable dealer. He conducted the experiment at a private lab with eyewitnesses, controlled all variables to replicate the conditions at Lake Mead during the time in question--65 to 73 degrees, no precipitation, on and on.
Sure, if the judge will give me eleven days.
I'll have Archie review the video footage. Maybe he messed with the time code or something.  I'll let you know.
You're certain?
Did you blow up the frames?
Okay.
I just finished your eval.
In the comments section, I noted that if you had my job, these evaluations wouldn't be late.
He used to be a competent scientist. We actually co-authored a paper together ten years ago. I believe greed has gotten in his way.
He manipulates people. The public assumes that scientists are ethical, but many of us are no better than politicians, evidently.
I know he is. I just don't know how. Videotapes are clean. The science appears sound. How's your case going?
It's always good to know what you don't know.
Seems so.
I can't tell you what to do, Sheriff.
Circling blowflies.
'Cause dead flies tell no lies.
Because the spider spied her. Catherine's daughter told me that when she was three. Do we have results?
Thank you.
Yeah. A Dr. Ryan called and said that you verbally harassed her?
Which means?
You should have cited Leviticus 17:11. 'The life of the flesh is in the blood.' Taken literally, life doesn't begin when the sperm meets the egg, but 18 days later. When the embryo is infused with blood.
Well, if I were speaking with a woman who prefers theology to science, it's a position she'd find tough to refute.
I don't know. I got to go to court.
I certainly do.
Yes.
No.
Our crime lab analyzed fly larvae that was taken from the pig used by Dr. Thayer in his demonstration. Apparently, they digested dimethyldithiophosphate and t-mulz light aromatic. 
Yes. I believe the malathion was sprayed onto the pig's skin.
It would delay the time it takes for puparia to appear. Specifically, the malathion would delay oviposition.
Laying eggs. Without malathion, adult flies would immediately lay new eggs on the pig's flesh. But with malathion, oviposition would be delayed up to four days. 
Yes.
The only rationale I can think of would be jury manipulation. Every entomologist knows that early oviposition is undetectable because flies lay their first round of eggs inside body openings. Anyone reviewing the tape would assume that the eggs were being laid, when in fact they were not. If our lab had not tested the larvae for toxins, we would never have known that. Nor would the jury.
I have nothing to say to you.
What character?
I hope so.
Actually, the work was done in the lab.
You know Sheriff, you could help me. I'm late delivering my team's personnel evaluations.
Thank you.
You know, Oscar Wilde once said, 'Ambition is the last refuge of failure.' I'm fine. Thanks.
Yeah.  Warrick ... we need everyone from grave. But park on Wall Street. Jefferson's taped off all the way back to Lincoln.
Is Bell going to make it?
All right.  Good luck.
It's just beginning.
Okay, everybody around here has got a video camera or a cell phone camera. They'll all be taking pictures.
Catherine's back at the station collecting the officers' guns. This is the main crime scene. So Nick, you and Sara take this. There's two additional crime scenes down the alleys behind Third. Warrick, you take the west alley, I'll take the east.
This is a running gun battle that started twenty blocks back. You get that.
He died, David. 
Is this gun in its original position?
How many times was he hit?
All right, leave him here, David. Warrick's DB's in the other alley just over there.
I didn't find any cartridge casings in this alley from the dead guy's gun. Just these three nine-millimeters from our cop.
Yeah, but he had to know that he'd get shot holding a gun whether it was loaded or not. Why didn't he just toss it?
That doesn't make him suicidal, though, does it?
Hey! You done yet?
Of course.
No. No.
Good. Pursuit started ten blocks farther down. You're halfway done.
Everybody's busy. I think you missed one.
Grissom.
A Buick?
Lucky guess. I'll call you back.
I'm a trained observer, Greg.
How long do you think a perfectly good hubcap like this would sit around out here? There's a freeway on-ramp about two blocks away. Check and see if there's any traffic cams between here and there.
I prefer poker. Horses are hard to control.  Make sure you document these skid marks.
Mrs. Bell, I'm so sorry about the loss of your husband -- he was a fine man.
Yeah. Ferro-tracing his hands?
Good old pyridyiphenyl triazine.
That could be the back strap of a gun.
Well, that location is consistent with the bullet Catherine found embedded in his vest.
Left to right, back to front.
Only cops were shooting in that direction.
Maybe not so friendly.
I have the autopsy findings on Leandro Chavez. He died of survivable wounds. Bled out at the crime scene waiting for transport.
We have reason to believe that Officer Bell was killed by friendly fire.
It was a through-and-through, and we haven't recovered the bullet yet. It's a big crime scene.
I said we haven't found it yet. I didn't say we weren't looking.
Shot him in the back for his bike. Great.
Oh, yeah ... I haven't gotten to them yet. Sorry. You're on administrative leave, though. You should be home getting some rest.
It's understandable.
Sofia ... we can't discuss the investigation.
Then it's already on the record.
Sofia ...
And?
Only AK ammo? No police cartridge cases or bullets?
Okay, you got to me.
Red clay chips?
No more so than anyone else around here.
Sara? Will you come with me to the east alley, please?
Well, this is per me. Come on. It'll be fun.
Sara?
Call Hodges at the lab. Have him bring two exemplar .45s out here. I'll get Ortega to bring Brass and Sergeant Carroll.
What goes up ... must come down.
So, where exactly was Estevez standing when you guys saw him?
And he had a gun in his hand.
I believe you. But the witnesses may also be right.
Check it out. Hodges, stand over here.
See that roof?
Toss one of the guns up there.
Technically, they're my guns -- so toss one up there.
Sara?
There's a cracked tile up on the roof. I found a series of scratches stretching from the cracked tile to the end of the roof.
It explains how the witnesses could see Estevez with his hands up, and Sergeant Carroll then saw him with a gun in his hand.
Sara ... 
Try it again.
There you have it.
At least this car still has a nice hubcap.
On the pursuit route, Jefferson, about ten blocks north of Third.
What about the phone records from the motel?
Yeah. Dead end on Fausto.
Wendy, you understand that this is confidential.
And you can't discuss it, even with your coworkers.
Yeah. How are you doing with Bell's bullet?
Does that mean you have results?
There's hardly any jacket left.
What if you had more time? Could you do it?
Okay, Nick, the Cruiser's right front tire is 19 feet, 5 inches from the south curb.
Sara, the detective unit's left front tire is five feet two inches from the south curb. 
All right. Nick, you be Brass. Sara, you be Sofia.
I'll be Bell. Officer Bell was crouched down behind his door.
Can you see me here?
Maybe he had to change positions. We know that the suspects were starting to run, right?
Let's assume that. We'll line up the exit trajectories with the apartment window, and we'll use lasers, but we may have to wait until it's dark.
Okay, we got the exit. Now we need the entrance. Sara, turn your laser on.
Yeah, it's a bad angle. Move it to the left.
Hmm?
Turn it off. Nick, turn yours on.
Raise it up. 
We did, but it was inconclusive, so I went back to the intersection and ran a reconstruction.
It wasn't Sofia. You must have stood up ... fired at the suspects over the black and whites. Officer Bell stood up at the same time, right into your line of fire. Fausto shot him in the vest, which spun him a little. At the same time, you hit him in the neck.
Sheriff wants me to present our findings at a community meeting in an hour.
Hello. My name is Dr. Gil Grissom. I'm the night shift supervisor for the Las Vegas Police Department's Crime Lab. I'm not a police officer; I'm a scientist.
Actually, I'm a forensics expert. My job is to identify, collect, and examine physical evidence from a crime scene, to determine who did what to whom and how did they do it. I've been asked to come here today by the mayor and Sheriff Burdick to present our analysis of the evidence in this case to your community.
Physical evidence cannot be wrong. It doesn't lie. It's not influenced by emotion or prejudice. It's ... it's not confused by the excitement of the moment. I'm here, in God's house, to explain to you the truth about exactly what happened the other day. I'd like to start by showing you some photos.  This is a bullet that was recovered from the Kevlar vest of Officer Daniel Bell, now deceased.
Okay, if you like, we can start there.
This photo is a comparison of two cartridge cases. The one on the right was found next to your son. The one on the left was test-fired from Jose Fausto's pistol. As you can see, there are corresponding individual marks on both cartridges. These are unique, like fingerprints. It means that they were fired from the same gun. It proves that while attempting to escape from the police ... Jose Fausto shot your son Geraldo in the back.
We recovered your son's bicycle from Jose Fausto's motel room. Your son was on his way to football practice.
It appears that Jose Fausto shot your son so he could use his bike.
I was happy to hear the review board cleared you.
Creased khakis, oxford shirt, new shoes. This guy had a home.
Back pockets?
Cranberry sauce.
Not since the chef blew his brains all over the kitchen.
TOD, David?
What's this gunk in his hands?
There were mashed potatoes in the dumpster.
Or he had really bad table manners.
Maybe that's why he's got that smile on his face.
So, all this stuff was in the vic's stomach?
Food normally takes two to four hours to digest, which means he ate all of this ...
When was the last time you saw a branded logo on a hot dog?
'All-U-Can-Eat.'
Who's paying for it?
No.
Sounds like a good idea, Greg. I'm still not paying for it.
'A hot dog at the ballpark tastes better than a steak at the Ritz.'
Humphrey Bogart.
Did you know that the term 'hot dog' was actually coined at a baseball game?
New York Polo Grounds, somewhere around 1867. A German butcher was selling what he called 'dachshund sausages' out of his pie wagon. He put them on a roll, so that his customers wouldn't burn their fingers. He'd yell out
Good luck. I'm rooting for you.
Prader-Willi.
No, Prader-Willi syndrome. A rare gentic disorder that causes ceaseless, uncontrollable excruciating hunger. It's as if your stomach was truly a bottomless pit.
Prader-Willi syndrome is characterized by short stature, hypotonia, almond-shaped eyes, and obsessive fingernail biting.
Sufferers are born with a flawed hypothalamus. Normal hypothalamus receives a signal from the stomach -- 'I'm full, stop eating.'
But with Prader-Willi syndrome, the signal never reaches the brain.
They're always hungry.
Guy's like Jerry are monitored their whole lives. Constant supervision 24 hours a day. You remember the scar tissue we found on his wrist?
I think it's possible that our vic spent most of his life in restraints.
In which case, they'd be responsible for his death.
Yeah, it's fun trying to figure out the magic tricks.
Is she with the show?
What's it doing out here?
Where'd she come from?
It's not just entertainment, Nick. The Cirque's about the power of imagination -- it's how we were able to put a man on the moon.
Looks like blood on the edge of this lift. It might have been unavoidable.
I don't need to hear about that.
Wait a minute. 
The security guard at Ka said that he let a young woman through the artists' entrance with a delivery of flowers. He escorted her to the green room, but didn't remember seeing her leave.
Huh.
I'll tell you how they did that later.
She dropped something.
There was no purse near the body or anywhere else backstage.
I got you a veggie burger.
I didn't know you were here. Soy sorry. 
It's the first time I've ever seen a suicide where the gun stays in the vic's hand.
Do we have any idea why he killed himself?
Bye.
No. 
The detail is ...
Impressive. 
And yes ... terrifying.
I've always been an egg man. But this time, I don't know.
Did you, uh, pull his wallet?
Catherine ... Do you need a minute?
Who's your lady friend?
That's the fun part.
Hey. You're coming with me. We got another 419 out by Nellis.
They tell me it tastes just like chicken.
This basin is designed to transfer an electrical current.
How does he end up face down in the middle of the bath?
Not impossible, though.
If he hit the water when the current was on, his muscles could've contracted, making it impossible for him to get out.
Yeah.  Who?
Not if you have a poultry fetish.
Yeah, I think so.
One more chance.
Definitely some kind of doll.
Three different views of the same dead doll. Maybe this is more than a signature. Maybe there's something these victims have in common.
Yeah.
And unfortunately, this is the best lead we have for their killer.
Yeah, well, with the equipment we have here.
Whatever happened with that number we got off the disposable cell phone? Any luck with that?
Let me guess. It was paid for with cash.
What about it?
Where did you find this?
How bad did Mannleigh get hurt by this?
Thank you, Hodges. I can see that it's a train.
Penny Garden. You delivered a package to her house.
Do you have any idea how ... your work ended up at crime scenes from three different murders?
Well, he's associated peripherally with all the victims, and he certainly has the right skills.
I know what it's like to lose yourself in little things. After a while it gets to you.
A guy kills two people before breakfast that he had no intention of killing when he woke up that morning. By all accounts, he's led a meager life, an unnoticed life. And then all of a sudden, in a flash, it's over. And now, for him, the real suffering begins.
Yeah.
Mankind has reached a new evolutionary plateau, and starting tomorrow, no one will rape, murder or maim again.
Too bad.
Raymundo Suarez called it as well.
How did you know about this?
I thought you went to college in San Diego.
Thank you.
The seasonal fluctuations in observed behaviors of the Walden Pond swamp mosquito.
Crazy times.
Why are we talking about this? Finch got off, didn't he?
You can't.
I'm going on sabbatical. You're gonna be the acting supervisor while I'm gone.
Tomorrow night.
Just the opposite. I'm a teacher without any students.
Whether you know it or not, you're the rock of my team. Catherine's going to be in charge for a while while I'm gone. Be there for her like you've been there for me and we'll all be fine.
Ernie Dell did kill with an artistic touch.
Hey, how's it going on your civil case? Did you get a lawyer?
Get your own counsel, Greg. That's your right.
Call the PPACE, talk to your union rep. This was an on-duty incident. They'll provide you with an attorney.
The department's only interest is the department. They'll throw you under the bus to protect themselves. When's your deposition?
Stick to whatever you put in the report. Don't waiver, be consistent. Everything's gonna be fine.
Hey, Nick.
Where's Catherine?
She told me she was going to be back before I left.
I'll be back in four weeks. Stop hugging me.
Hey.
My cab's here.
Yeah.
I'll miss you.
It's good to be back, Judy.
But I'm sure you'll find some.
I'd rather hear it from Catherine, thanks.
And you know this how?
Oh, you're Spanky.
Michael Keppler. 
Hi, Gil Grissom.  How's everybody been treating you? 
Yeah, thanks. Does Ecklie still have you slotted for days?
I hear you're working the double homicide at the Olympia. What have you got?
The dead cop was from your hometown, huh?
Did you know him?
Same.
Hey. Want some help?
What do you got?
I missed Las Vegas.
I'm avoiding the paperwork and mail that's piled up on my desk.
Where would you like me to start?
Well, she was past due on her electric bill. But seems to have paid her telephone bill on time.
I, uh, heard there was some friction in the lab while I was gone.
Sara.
Yeah.
A garbage dump?
Did you, uh, put the cocoon in my office?
I think you're going to be surprised when it hatches.
I'll see you later.
Why? By whom? Keppler told me that he didn't know Frank McCarty. 
Where is he? 
Okay, grab Sara and go over there, and I'll have Brass call Trenton PD, see who knows who.
What other evidence did, uh, Keppler handle?
Could he have swapped the bullets?
We have to treat him like a suspect. I'll tell Ecklie.
Grissom.
Well, he's not your priority. Find the witness.
Catherine, layout room, right away!
It's been sitting in my office for the last four weeks.
Yeah, I watched him blow his brains out. But I think the package was postmarked after he killed himself.
The three other murders, the miniature was left at the scene. This one was addressed to me.
The victim appears to be a Caucasian female with lots of books. It could be an office, somebody's living room ... or a modern hotel lobby. When I was gone, did anybody work a scene like this?
Never mind.
Take a look at the early edition. 
This murder hasn't happened yet.
They won't find anything. 
No, I even went through her little purse.
Look at this.
It would seem so.
Methods change. Killers evolve.
What?
These books are all arranged by subject matter: art, religion, science ... The victim is apparently well-educated.
I don't know.
There's something on the surface. Looks like brush strokes.
You have a cat, don't you, Hodges?
Do you ever take him out of the house?
So if this is a house cat, then this must be somebody's home.
Yeah. Maybe the victim has as well. The previous murders have all involved the vic's habits and routines. So maybe this time, it's a little something extra in her afternoon tea.
She lays down for her usual nap, the cat sneaks a sip, and neither one ever wakes up again.
It doesn't matter how she dies if we can't figure out who she is or where she is.
I choose these two.
No, but I'm pretty sure she was scheduled to die today. In each of the previous cases, the killer was at the scene to commit the murder. So maybe he was planning to show up at the condo.
And we have nothing to link him to the other three murders?
Okay. Thanks.
Stop hovering, Hodges. You're in or you're out.
No. Hand me a scalpel.
Tweezers.
Grissom.
Carbon monoxide poisoning.
That I don't know.
That's why the killer felt safe enough to send me the miniature. He never intended to be at the scene. There was no danger of being caught.
No.
Look, Sofia, there weren't any carbon monoxide sensors in the apartment, so no one could have known.
And in fact, if I hadn't have gone away, we'd have had another month to work with; you'd have never been in that position.
It's not perfect, though. Officer Kamen was not the intended victim.
I'm still not sure it's perfect enough.
Okay.
Now, it's perfect.
It was inevitable. With the murder, the amount of information that could leak rose exponentially.
There's chlorine bleach in the samples. Why put bleach in vase water?
The one with the water retention problem.
Media's all over him. Which means he's all over the undersheriff, who's all over Ecklie, who's blaming me for not going public with the Izzy Delancy miniature like he told me to.
Lipocalin, lactoferrin, lysozyme. Tears.
The victim was crying?
At this birthday party?
Ernie Dell confessed and killed himself to protect someone he loved. And that someone has murdered five people.
Eenie, meeny, miney, mo. Catch a monster by the toe.
Primitive people refused to be photographed, fearing the camera would steal their soul. 
Like any good hunter, the photographer stalks, takes aim, and shoots an image. Who's to say that when the shutter traps that moment in time those primitive fears weren't well founded?
These two kids have only been missing for fourteen hours. They could have eloped to Mexico.
All right. But you owe me one for getting me out of bed on a Saturday morning.
Mitch?
What do you want me to test?
Did you have assigned parking when you were in high school?
Yeah, it's blood. I hope they're in Mexico.
Yeah, well, the world's become a very small place, Nick. All the vices are closer to home.
More polyfill.
Hey, Nick?
This looks like arterial spraying. Something bad happened here.
Some kind of broken glass.
Well, this was kicked in.
Any calls placed before they went missing?
How about Ryan?
It bends the light more.
Thank you, David.
Greg.
Looks like acceleration marks.
So far there's no reports of anyone fitting Megan's description being admitted to area hospitals.
Nick!
Straight ahead of you about twenty yards.
Is she still alive?
You okay?
Phthirus Pubis.
There's a hole in the metal to let the urine pass. So theoretically, she could still get them.
You know, the incidence of STDs in monogamous couples is slim.
So assuming they both have pubic lice, if either Megan or Ryan were assaulted, they would have given them to their attacker.
Yeah, but once they jump to the fresh host, crabs contain the DNA of the receiver and the giver. Did the parents agree to an SAE kit?
How recent was the injury?
Did her mother mention the injury?
Well, I can guess where she got those and who she gave them to. What is it that she swallowed?
Looks like a memory card from a camera.
What's a 'Hit List'?
Try 'Megan.'
Men are never as mysterious as women wish they were.
The fingerprint results on Ryan's van. No hits except on the back door handle, came back to Diane Kentner. She was arrested last year at a demonstration in support of an X-rated photography show.
Maybe she wanted a ride.
It proves s*x with a minor. Even if we can't get her for Megan's hit-and-run, it's enough for a search warrant.
Looks like she drew us a map.
No one could have predicted this.
Postmortem photography-- memento mori. In the 19th century, a photo of your dead loved one was a popular keepsake. Death remembered. One last look.
Hey.
Charlie told Nick that Sheila pushed Ryan.
Intimately.
I'm sure he had a good excuse.
Yeah.
Next bedroom. There's another body in there.
According to Brass, the boyfriend of one of the victims found the bodies. Said there were six roommates, all showgirls. Evidently, one didn't come home.
Sara!
Dispatch, this is CSI Grissom ...
Yeah. He took his time with her. The others were killed efficiently.
David, don't move any of the bodies just yet, okay?
Partial footprint. Whoever kicked in this window was barefoot.
Yeah, but some of the others weren't.
What else?
I think when he came to this house, he was unprepared. He had to use things that were already here. They say a disorganized killer is apt to obtain his victims by chance.
Luck of the draw.
The girl in this picture is the victim from my room.
Yeah. Well, not when she was onstage.
Killer herded them all into here. He used the sheets from that bed to tie them up, then dragged them all down the hallways to the other two bedrooms to kill them.
Maybe he wanted to get her alone. Maybe she excited him ... or pissed him off. Either way, he was brutal with her. She was the messiest kill.
Yeah. He had all the time he needed 'cause the neighbors couldn't hear a thing.
Yes, sir, I understand that, but, uh, we're still analyzing the evidence. As soon as we have something to report, we'll report it. Okay.
Bottom of the pile -- first victim, top of the pile-- last.
Both found in Warrick's bedroom.
She was found dead in Sara's bedroom.
She was found on the floor in Warrick's bedroom. There's no logic to any of this.
But why would he clean off the knife between victims?
So he forced them to tie each other up.
Thanks.
Hey, Greg. The, uh, civil suit that was filed by the Demitrius James family, DA decided not to go to trial. So the city's agreed to a payout; $2.5 million.
It's just political pragmatism. City wants to cut their losses.
Comes with the job.
Was the same knife used to stab Marlon Frost?
Smudges won't put the knife in Mullins' hands, though.
All the evidence at the house suggests that the killer was unfamiliar with the layout.
Sara, slow down. Frost isn't going anywhere.
Okay, one step at a time.
So his DNA should be on it.
This is what happens when you don't wear your seatbelt.
Well, then that must be ... his brain on drugs.
Or get shot, whichever comes first.
Yeah, and we have to process every last drop of it.
It's a little small for those golf-ball size holes we found in that limo.
.50 caliber. Casing looks new. I bet it's from a Desert Eagle.
Consistent with .50 caliber Desert Eagle handgun.
Six shots into the limo. Autopsy reports cause of death was single gunshot wound to the head with variable trajectory, so one of those was the kill shot.
Sounds like Drops' story is holding up, though.
Tinting film is applied to the inside of a window, so the small-caliber round was fired from inside the limo.
And, evidently, Drops wasn't telling us the whole story after all.
This image was captured on a cell phone at the scene. We believe that that is Aaron James.
We found a pattern in the blood on the seat next to the vic's. It doesn't match the clothes from the limo driver or Drops, so there was at least one other passenger in that limo, and we need to question Aaron James.
Okay. I know that. It's just standard procedure.
Tie score -- one dead on each side.
But that bill doesn't put her in there any more than it does Aaron.
What about the seat belt adjuster you found?
What about the limo?
Yeah, but maybe not entirely.
Stretch limos are custom-made. You take a Lincoln Continental, cut it apart, stretch it with whatever parts you have available: Ford, Chrysler, General Motors, doesn't matter.
Looks like the same belt adjuster.
If the DNA matches Simone Molinez's, anyone that was in this limo is up for murder. The, uh, undersheriff won't have a choice.
The DA tells me you requested he go easy on Aaron James.
He's getting a suspended sentence. Released on his own recognizance.
If the kid's brother hadn't died, would you have done the same?
Doesn't matter what I think.
Well, then there's a lot more to Barbie than just a pretty face, 'cause this is a perfect half-inch scale model of the room. And assuming that the killer is the same person who made the miniature ... 
Yeah, but take a look at the blood pools.
There's no predicting a blood pool; it's inherently random.
It's real blood.
It's his biggest hit.
Probably before your time.
Sometimes it only takes one hit.
Bleach was used in this kitchen but not to clean up the blood.
If only the who was as easy as the how.
Cause of death?
Sorry, Izzy. Now ... 
What is that?
The key to our mystery?
No. No prints, no hairs, no fibers. Materials are common hobby shop issue, but the blood matches the victim's.
Who inherits the music rights?
Its illegal to benefit from a criminal act. If either one of them committed the murder ...
Well, that's motive for her. But how does this fit in?
What's the point of gratifying the murderer with publicity?
Don't we all?
So the key could've been in his system anywhere from a few minutes to several days?
Thank God. These events have to be connected. We'll check your old cases for possible suspects. I'll ask Ecklie if he can kick in some help from day shift.
You've got to stay at arm's length, Catherine.
How's Lindsey?
Prints put him in the motel. Found them on the Polaroid paper slip.
Can you place him at the bar?
The accident was a two-man job. Can you remember anybody else?
And there's a test we can do to prove it.
We're using a tilt table and we're injecting him with isoproterenol. We're testing his sensitivity to his vagus nerve. Basically, we're looking to find out if the nerves that control his blood pressure are predisposed to short circuit when he gets an adrenaline rush.
Unless he was faking it.
Not necessarily. Could be anybody in town. Or anybody out of town for that matter. That's a lot of suspects.
I don't know.
I'll deal with it.
Fellas, another incident at Lolita's.
An erotic athlete claiming a 420-Z. The paramedics have her on a stretcher.
Greg?
419 at Tagliferri's Restaurant on 8th Avenue.
Cath?
415-B at the Ha-Ha-Ha.
An angry clown got pissed at some heckler with clogged arteries, and it caused a heart attack.
Trust me, you don't want Greg's 419.
Hey. CDC needs someone out at the Omdi-Tech offices on Boulder Highway. I'm sure it's not hazardous, or they wouldn't let us collect it.
No, I'm spending the night in autopsy with the Lake Mead floater.
A perfect, half-inch scale model of the room. And assuming that the killer is the same person who made the miniature ...
It's real blood. The killer actually stuck around to match the blood pool at the scene.
Look carefully at the back of the doll and at the pillow on the chair. There appears to be remnants of glue on both.
I think the killer expected the victim to die in this chair.
We did pull him out of Lake Mead, you know.
Where's his head, David?
Day shift.
Uh-oh. He's got gas. Phew.
No, I'm all right.
Oh.
At least I tried to get him. Where were you?
It's just a rat, fellas. Why are you wearing the HazMat gear?
Rats are neophobic -- they fear the new. We stand a better chance of catching him by giving him what he's used to.
I think he's onto us, Doc.
Can you smell that?
You shouldn't be able to smell that through your suit.
Did you know that rodents have skeletons with flexible joints?
If they can get their head through something, the rest of their body can contort to fit. They can crawl into spaces as small as a quarter.
That's not the only thing he's got in his mouth.
What is it?
Looks like the rat ate the mule.
Yeah, I've been looking at those a lot lately.
He dropped into Lake Mead.
Well, I'll get the drugs to Tox, and we'll wrap this up.
This better be good, Dave.
What?
The bellows.
James Tilly Matthews. Early 19th century London. Matthews was in Bedlam Hospital awaiting trial. Doctors were trying to determine his sanity. Several interviewed him. Half thought he was sane, half insane. Turns out he was perfectly normal ... except when someone mentioned politics. At that point, he'd go into a rage about the little men who lived underground and used a bellows to push thoughts into his mind, as well as the minds of Parliament and the Queen. A specific object or word that triggers the urge to kill. That's a form of delusional psychosis. Rare, but does exist.
Well, if having bleach in your home is the common element among victims ... then anyone can be next. 
Not that we know of. However, it's not unusual for people with these pathologies to become vocal toward the institutions that they feel propagate the trigger.
Cross-reference correspondence with Vegas postmarks. Might be able to narrow down neighborhoods.  Good job, Hodges. 
Really.
Now ... do you mind?
Where's your coroner?
This is a strange crowd for a cathouse.
'Happy' Morales. I saw him fight LeRoi Steele at the Sands a couple of years ago. Took a vicious beating. Never touched the mat once.
Look at this.
Maybe.
Well, he was a boxer.
Places like this always keep their pools warm. Encourages the girls to swim topless. It's good for business.
So they tell me.
May I?
Thank you.
These monitors are live-feed only? Nothing taped?
But I see that the rooms are wired for sound as well.
And to make sure that they don't short you on their financial transactions?
Did you hear anything unusual last night?
You cared about him.
Twenty-five people here last night, and nobody sees anything.
I worked a murder-suicide at the Naughty Kitty once.
As a customer? No.
I have not. I find the whole idea very ... bleak.
No. You make me happy.
Methaqualone ... benziazepine; antidepressants.
There's no prescription labels. It's all written in Spanish. Looks like a lot of this stuff came from south of the border.
This might be where they ran the opening bell.
The prints on the shrimp tails all came back to George Babinkian, but whoever was eating the shrimp was wearing lavender lipstick -- so I'm guessing it wasn't Binky.
Doc was bothered there was no sign of shellfish in Happy's digestive tracts, so he went back and checked the genital area -- there are clear indications that the point of entry of the anaphylaxis ... was through the urethra.
No. I think it'll be all right. Go ahead.
Take your time.
Come on.
These rooms are all wired for sound.
They have no expectation of privacy in those rooms. Binky and Doris are the ones who wired them, and they listen to their clients all the time.
Binky used Doris to induce Happy's allergic reaction to shrimp as a sort of test of her fidelity ...
Greg found this in the trash of one of the girls' rooms.
Right now the DA's not sure who he's going to charge. What he needs from us is the most accurate timeline we can provide.
So the fake snake bite is around 1:00.
Happy's down ... but not out.
And earlier that night, Binky fed Doris some jumbo tiger shrimp, -- 
-- knowing that she'd eventually find Happy for round two.
In any event, Binky and Doris lawyered up. They're sticking together.
According to Narco, Happy had epinephrine in his trailer, which is probably what he was trying to get to in round two.
But not necessarily murder.
Which brings us to round four. 
The TKO.
Did you know that pigs are very intelligent animals, right behind chimps, dolphins and elephants?
And certain politicians.
Let's look in the barn.
Hey, Warrick.
I feel like Marco Polo.
I just discovered Chyna.
Do you believe that intelligent life exists on other planets?
I think their UFO club is based on the teachings of this guy.
Duct tape?
Could that be the fatal wound?
Nick's working on it.
Almost three inches, smooth-edge blade; you know, Catherine found --
I'm still working on the 'how.'
Heartwarming.
And he's got the best-looking wall mount in the neighborhood.  We're going to need to process that toolmark.
Exactly Chyna's height. How about for a male?
Preston De Vere is too tall. Did you measure the head of the femur?
It's a female.
Yeah.  Human teeth aren't strong enough to leave these marks.
Okay ... go back to the ranch. See if you can find the rest of her.
Good. Come here, take a look at this.
Yeah. You can see Dick Cheney, Al Gore, all nine Supreme Court Justices shape-shift into reptilians. Did you know that, for thousands of years, creatures from the constellation Draco have been mating with humans to form a super-race that includes 43 US presidents, most members of Congress, and the entire British royal family?
Hey, did Shannon Turner have a cat?
So did Hank Connors. See, it figures. Cats are a natural enemy of reptiles.
She tried to defend herself.
Yeah, but Brass interviewed her last week. She didn't have any visible cuts.
But what I don't understand is if Shannon Turner and Hank Connors really believed in a reptilian conspiracy and they felt threatened by the political establishment, why kill a blackjack dealer?
Ms. Turner ... was Chyna a reptilian?
Who is this?
Is that Chyna De Vere?
Tell me about this one.
Did you slay the Reptilian Athena?
Then you better turn it off before they use the Oxygen Destroyer on him.
I don't know why I find it so difficult to express my feelings to you. Even though we're far apart, I can see you as vividly as if you were here with me. I said I'll miss you, and I do.
As Shakespeare more ably wrote my sentiment in Sonnet 47, 'Thyself away art present still with me;
It's like we're witnessing some form of mass hallucination. You know, they think the cops are part of this reptilian conspiracy as well. That's why Shannon attacked Greg.
Please, we come in peace.
How you doing?
Twenty years ago, the county was still using typewriters. Did you find anything?
Good. I'll run it. I have to pull you off of this. Days is down to four CSI's. You're on loan-out.
Money, stress, Ecklie, maybe. Just help them with their backlog.
Grissom. Catherine.  I'm on my way.
Does it make a difference?
You had just lost your daughter.
Stop it!
If a client did this, and left you to die, why are you protecting him?
Tell me the truth. 
Did they check your glucose level when you came in? 
Heather?
She's diabetic. I think she's going into shock.
Any results on Heather Kessler?
Heather's not supposed to drink because of her diabetes, which could explain the hypoglycemia and shock.
She was sexually assaulted?
This makes no sense. She's very strong. And tough as nails. Why didn't she fight?
She was here ... with me.
It was a social call, that's all.
Yes.
Apparently so.
Look, I went to Heather's on a hunch. There's something not right with her.
Yeah. Keeps my hands busy.
I'm the only one Heather trusts.
Sara ...
Thank you, Judy.
This is your granddaughter. Did you take this picture?
No.
No, I'm just a friend of hers.
Not really.
That's Zoe's daughter, Heather's granddaughter.
I'm just trying to understand what's happening to her.
I'm aware that the court has denied her visitation rights.
I'm not sure.  Has Heather tried to give you any money for Alison?
Can you tell me how much?
I wonder if she calculated the exact amount it would cost to raise a child and put her through college, especially at Harvard. That's where she sent Zoe. But it wasn't her house that she sold.
I know. What am I supposed to do? I'm your friend. Besides, there's someone I want you to meet.
The detail is ...
Well, then there's a lot more to Barbie than just a pretty face. 'Cause this is a perfect half-inch-scale model of the room.
Three different views of the same dead doll.
Just got an e-mail. Raymond Dell. Died two years ago in some bizarre back hoe incident in Rapid City.
Grissom.
I'll meet you there.
Somebody likes it cold.
No. But I'm afraid the Miniature Killer was here first.
Air-conditioning would have slowed that and accelerated mummification. Body's been sealed in the apartment. There's no insect activity. So much for TOD.
It's hard to say. Haven't found a miniature of the scene yet. Just this.
Clothes match. The ... uh ... vic's a PT nurse, but there's no blood on the doll, and it's not posed like the body.
I don't think we can rule anything out. It's all yours, my dear.
Yeah.
I live by the Uncertainty Principle. The mere act of observing a phenomenon changes its nature.
I'm certain we have.
A fingerprint.
Maybe he's finally gotten careless.
Hodges ran fabric, paint, glue, and plastic samples of the Trevor doll. The materials were consistent with the previous minis.
It was only a partial, not enough to put through AFIS. But there were epithelials in the print. Wendy's running DNA.
I found a thriving miniature hobbyist community on line. Sites where people meet, chat, exchange building tips, list stores they shop in.
Items like Trevor Dell's metal bracelet are difficult to make, even for skilled craftsmen. I'm trying to find people who specialize in miniature metal work.
Female serial killers are rare enough. Delusional psychosis in women ... rarer still.
Family court judge was explicit: 'No fishing expeditions.' We need to go in with a name.
I'll be back. I have to go see the Shadowcaster of the Forgotten Realms.
Hello, Art.
Coming along, thank you. We found another one.
I think so. By any chance, did you make this bracelet?
She have a last name?
It's the same cell number we already have. Do you remember what she looked like?
Weird how?
Was that the last time you saw her?
Battery powered micro-motor?
Grissom.
Her birth name was Natalie Davis.
She would've been about seven when she came to you in 1982.
Do you take a photo of every child?
Do you use bleach, Mrs. Wetzel?
According to Child Services, she only stayed with you a week. Do you remember why?
Fired unglazed pottery. Her biological father was Christopher Davis, a ventriloquist.
I Googled him.
Natalie's younger sister. 1981, she fell out of a tree house and died. But her father's still alive---and still performing.
What happened?
How did Natalie deal with it?
Yeah, I was just wondering what it must've looked like to her.
Come on, Sara, pick up. Please pick up.
Who was in my office while I was gone?
Her name is Natalie Davis, and she works for our janitorial service.
For over a month. She's never been arrested, so there's nothing to flag on a security check. She used Ernie Dell's address on her work form. She has no home phone and no driver's license.
Pull up the case photos.
Oh, my God. She was at the crime scene.
It is different. 
This girl holds me responsible for the death of Ernie Dell. I took away the only person she ever loved, so she's going to do the same thing to me.
It's not about a psychotic reaction to bleach, or some dead sister or the doll. 
'NotUrLittleBisqueDoll...'
This is Gil Grissom at CSI. I need to get an Attorney General's Waiver.
I want to talk to her, Jim. Alone.
Hi, Natalie. My name's Gil. It's so nice to finally meet you. I ... uh ... probably shouldn't say this, but ... I'm a huge fan. 
I've been a crime scene investigator for 22 years. I've worked over two-thousand homicides, and you are by far ... the best I've ever seen. I mean ... 
... you're such a great artist. And to be so young and so talented and ... so pretty. I've thought about you every night for the last nine months. I even tried to do what you do. I built my own miniature. 
You saw it? 
How'd I do?
Do you play chess? 
I play as a hobby. It quiets my mind, you know? Soothes me. At one point, I became so consumed by it that whenever I closed my eyes, I could see the chess pieces moving all around the board. I was obsessed with correcting all my bad moves. I wondered if a game could ever be played without a mistake. I'd love to play you sometime. 
I'm so impressed by the way you embrace your passion. You'd make a great CSI. This last one was brilliant. You studied our crime scene so well. Tracking the car to the junkyard and then towing it all the way out to the desert where you knew we wouldn't find it. And then ... the way you killed Sara.
You didn't?
No, it isn't, Natalie. It's about you. 
Natalie, listen to me -- tell me where she is.
Natalie. Please tell me where Sara is.
STOP IT! Just stop this! Tell me where Sara is!
Generally, autopsies are performed in the morning. 
Hello, David.
David Phillips, everyone, our excellent assistant coroner and baseball trivia expert.
I'll introduce you to her later.  Afternoons are usually for paperwork and court.
So you get the clothes, you get your guy.
Did he push all the buttons?
A lot?
Well, there's plenty of physical evidence, but it's all ambiguous.
Well, you know, there's precedent for charging him with promoting a suicide attempt. It's reckless endangerment. There was a case in New York, but it's hard to make that charge stick.
How do you do that?
Well, the embalming fluid would make the marijuana burn slower, giving it more chance to be absorbed, creating a longer lasting high, I would imagine.
You got to tell her the truth.
Bacon and eggs?
Is he one of the victims?
Life imitates art.
Okay. You first.
What about all this mess, the furniture and appliances?
That's a workable theory for now.
I believe I said first opinions are crucial, but if the evidence changes, so must the theory.
We're still working our way in.
All chainsaws operate the same way, right?  Chain travels around the bar, teeth move away from the operator around the top and come back on the bottom.
So, if our guy, Lou, was attacked from the front, the teeth would hit him from a downward angle.
So ... what? He was attacked from behind?
Ray Gaynor. The neighbor.
Put him under the Lou Beltran spatter. And load him up.
Well, the body's in the correct relative position. But the angle's off.
I don't know, but it's very awkward to try and line this up.
Lou Beltran wore his watch on his right wrist. 
I bet he was left-handed.
Doc Robbins said that the cuts on Lou's body were made when the chain was traveling upwards.
Which means that the top of the chain had to be facing him.
An inexperienced left-handed operator with a dull chainsaw certainly increases the risk for injury.
So he chainsawed his wife's furniture and appliances, the metal dulled the blade, and the kickback from the chainsaw is what killed him.
How many of you are right-handed?
Left-handed?
Twenty-five hundred left-handed people die each year using products designed for right-handed people.
A third person would have left shoe impressions in the blood, various other sign -- there was none.
Part of being a CSI is learning to work in the absence of absolute certainty. Each and every case brings us a new opportunity to learn something. For instance, in the case of Donna Basset, we can see that there is no such thing as an insignificant detail.  And finally, if the evidence changes, your theory must change as well. Questions?
You get used to it.
Well, not everyone can.
Because the dead can't speak for themselves.
Surveillance?
Witnesses?
Even if this guy was walking out of here with a million dollars ... this is way more than excessive.
Do fists and feet count?
Could one person have done this?
Greg ... lose the monkey suit, you got a scene; liquor store robbery. Here's the address.
Could be -- Sofia's got one of the suspect's sweaters. I need you to seal it, bring it back here and anything you can find.
You're a big boy, Greg. You don't need a wingman for this.
Whoa! Pick on somebody you're own size.
No.
Could this be a woman's shoe?
'Cause Catherine found a broken female toenail in the vic's mouth.
Which suggests that they were on the ground for most of the beating.
Greg?
Just another day at the office, huh?
He's gonna be fine.
His name is Demitrius James. He's in surgery.
Actually ... he's a student at the university.
I don't know.
Has someone called your parents? We should let them know.
What's the matter?
Why do they think that?
I never would've guessed.
Well ... now would be the time to come clean.
You tell her that you risked your life to save someone else's ... and I think she'll be very proud of you.
Contact lenses? 
Great. Just a game to them.
What do you see?
Inconsistency.
The dishwasher, both tourists and Greg were attacked near the strip. Dean Harden claims that he was attacked all the way over here in southwest Las Vegas. Swarms don't backtrack.
Humans have always adapted strategies from insects. Swarming is an ancient military tactic. You surround your enemies, then attack from all directions simultaneously. Alexander the Great pioneered the maneuver 2,000 years ago. Although swarms consist of several individuals, they must be treated as a single entity, which lives, thinks and moves as one, built with an internal logic to continue forward, gain momentum and never backtrack.
Take a look at these clothes.
In contrast to the other beatings, I found only one type of shoe tread on Dean's clothing. The print matches a size 12 Nike Air. And this tennis shoe is ... his own.
The truth is ... 
... a moral compass can only point you in the right direction, can't make you go there. Our culture preaches that, uh, you shouldn't be ashamed of anything you do anymore. 
And unfortunately, this city was built on the principle that there's no such thing as guilt. 'Do whatever you want; we won't tell.' So without a conscience, there's nothing to stop you from killing someone. And evidently, ... 
... you don't even have to feel bad about it.
Why? I wonder. Somebody had a grudge against the church or somebody in the church.
Well, Jesus died for our sins. What sin did she die for?
Like Jesus.
Gruesome torture in any century.
I imagine the priest is a resurrection theologian, as opposed to a crucifixion theologian. They believe in forgiveness rather than penance.
She was bleeding from her head wounds, and the beating didn't take place up there.
We're gonna need to take your clothes.
Greg, go with him, collect his clothing.
I hope so.
Two shrubs at the entrance of the church. A row of four on the wall of the community center. Three bushes behind the rectory adjacent to the statue of St. Jude.
Memory's a gift.
Who do you think?
This job certainly challenges your faith.
I believe we need a little of both.
No, dear.
I'm not really a Catholic anymore, you know. I suppose I practice a kind of secular Catholicism that involves ritualizing certain aspects of everyday life and imbuing them with a spiritual intensity they might not otherwise possess, but I don't want to put too fine a point on it.
This belonged to my mother.
Take a look at this pattern.
Five series of ten beads, each representing the 'five mysteries' separated by five 'our father' beads.
Probably the same person who would crucify someone in a church.
St. Jude.  Patron saint of lost causes.
We did. The blood on your clothes is not a match to the blood on the victim.
Not just yet. 
I have a favor to ask.
We'd like permission to search your rectory and the nuns' apartments.
Well, we want to eliminate you as suspects.
You're right. But you have nothing to hide.
It's so obvious that it obviates suspicion.
Well, that's hardly the argument to make.
Rosaries.
We'll need all the rosaries.
Where'd you get this?
Yeah.
These are unique rosaries, Father. Handmade in Italy. And they're sequentially numbered on the back. So we know that they were purchased together. One of them is yours; one we found at the victim's condo. Did you give it to her?
Sister, excuse me, but ... could you tell us how you managed to haul the victim's body to the top of the scaffolding?
Sister, how much do you weigh?
It's a question of physics. Charlotte weighed 140 pounds, plus the weight of the cross. You don't weigh enough or have enough strength to have hoisted the body 17 feet into the air.
Well, you know, he told me that he broke up a fight at the shelter.
You know, his move from St. Bart's to St. Jude's involved a female parishioner who committed suicide. No charges were filed, but the parish board asked that he be removed.
Well, DNA will give us a profile.
We didn't ask.
Going by her scrapbook, this seems to have been a golden time in Charlotte's life -- high school. There's a lot of pictures of the three of them together, but the only two-shots are of Frank and Charlotte except for this one.
Evidently, she went to her prom with Cody.
The next picture of Frank, he's in a seminary. Maybe, uh, giving up Charlotte was the sacrifice he made to join the church.
Look, I know it sounds nuts, but this is not the way a resurrection theologian would kill his pregnant mistress.
He's a Catholic. They're full of guilt.
Father ... I want you to take a look at this.
We, uh, found a letter you wrote to the bishop and pulled it off your computer. 'The spirit has left my vocation. I've crossed a line in my discipline and committed an act unfit for the priesthood.' What act is that?
So, you were leaving the priesthood?
And what if the baby wasn't yours?
Can you forgive him?
You have no choice.
Okay, so what does your arson have to do with my missing kids?
Child molester.
Excuse me, Mr. Fisher? 
My name's Gil Grissom. I'm with the Crime Lab. What happened to your shoes?
Are you familiar with the names Lucas Hanson or Jason Crowley?
Which is it -- boys or girls?
No, you don't.
Hold out your hands, please.
Turn them over.
I'm almost done.
I don't know. But it doesn't change anything, does it?
Grissom.
Carl Fisher's on his way in to the station to sign off on his arson claim. Brass needs something from us to hold him.
Or worse.
Didn't we talk about this once before, Greg?
What have you found?
Gasoline comparisons are only credible if you have pure samples. Otherwise, there's too many variables.
I just want to find these boys.
Fruit punch?
And ... so?
These are known child molesters living within our search radius.
Who said the boys were dead?
Okay, then ... what would you do if you were going to take those boys?
And then?
Do you like mushrooms, Carl?
We found mushrooms in the backseat of your car.
On the night the boys disappeared, witnesses said they saw them sitting in a car with a man, eating pizza.
Did you take the kids out for pizza?
We just found Lucas Hanson's dead body. They're chewing on that.
He's still missing.
I don't know. He wants something from me ... or he wouldn't still be here.
Not exactly. We found Jason Crowley. Alive. On a bus headed for Houston.
That bus ticket costs $95 for a child under twelve. Jason's grandfather doesn't keep any cash in the house, and he doesn't give him an allowance, so where do you think Jason got the cash?
From whom?
Captain Brass wants to put you in a lineup. If you'll agree to it, then I think this will all be over with.
It did?
And?
In a plastic gas can?
Thanks, Greg.
Arson is a felony. You torched your own car. We have video surveillance and electronic records that show you purchasing gas and a gas can.
You were destroying evidence of Lucas Hanson and Jason Crowley in your car. And I think you helped kill Lucas.
He told us he knew you. Kill one, kill both, remember? 
It doesn't kill them.
Okay, Carl, just tell me what happened.
Did you let them use your phone?
Well, if he didn't want to call his mother, why didn't you call her?
So, instead, you took them for pizza?
You gave him liquor.
And you wanted to get them drunk.
It was more than a taste, Carl. Lucas' blood alcohol level was point one six. That's twice the legal limit for an adult. 
Why didn't you take them home?
And you knew that Jason wanted money, so he could go to Texas and see his dad, so you bribed him in order to be alone with Lucas.
Who took his shirt off?
What were you gonna do to him once his shirt was off?
Is that what you think? Then why didn't you help him? He told you he hit his head. He was in pain. He had a concussion, Carl. You must have known that. I'm sure he was dizzy, probably had no appetite. Maybe he was even slurring his words, but you didn't care about that, because you wanted what you wanted.
His brain was bleeding. 
Now, most kids won't die from that, because someone who really loves them takes them to the hospital, but instead, you gave him alcohol and aspirin, a lethal combination for his head injury. It prevented his blood from clotting. You killed him, Carl. 
And you would have killed Jason, too, except he ran away from you and out of your reach.
I don't. You had choices. You made the wrong ones. And now this little boy is gone.
Everybody wins.
Except Lucas.
She may have served them drinks.
Unfortunately, these windows aren't tempered.
And she went through face first.
Maybe they went through the room after they killed her.
There used to be.
Man ... her cancer had cancer. I guess she liked smoking more than living, huh?
You know, Catherine found antidepressants, laxatives, acid-reflux meds in her house, but I don't think she found anything for pain.
Maybe the killer took it with him.
Possible serial killer.
Look at the blood on the doll's forehead.
Could be two different views of the same subject.
Yeah, but we have no context. It could mean or represent just about anything.
Izzy Delancy, 50-year-old white male, washed-up rock star. Penny Garden, cancer-stricken retiree.
Why wasn't this one left at the crime scene like that one?
Look carefully at the back of the doll and at the pillow on the chair. There appears to be remnants of glue on both.
I think the killer expected the victim to die in this chair.
Penny Garden was poisoned with nicotine.
She didn't smoke it. She drank it. Liquid nicotine. Truman Capote used it as a murder weapon in his story, 'Hand-Carved Coffins,' and our killer put it in Aunt Penny's liqueur bottle.
A cigarette introduces approximately one milligram of nicotine into the body. The liqueur contained over 60. A dose that massive can induce severe convulsions ...
... and evidently, mess up a meticulously crafted murder.
That's why the miniature wasn't at the crime scene. The killer was compelled to fix it, so that it would match what actually happened.
Yeah. Commonly available to just about anyone. Any luck with the vic's calls?
Yeah. Take off that suit, too.
And Greg ... you did a good job.
What is it, Archie?
Well, fortunately for us, this was a personal delivery ... right to our front door.
Every death has at least two stories.
She was a big wig. Jill Case, Editor-in-Chief of the Las Vegas Globe. She was a wunderkind. One of the youngest women in history to run a newspaper.
Consistent with suicide.
Well, I don't know. Maybe if you feel like you don't deserve to take up space on the planet, you don't deserve a whole piece of paper.
It's human nature. We continue to perform the routine motions of our life until the moment of our death.
Could still be two cases.
What would the horses be in this case?
And, uh, what do you got to support that?
No.
Well, maybe she had her number memorized.
Two women found dead on opposite sides of town. If they didn't look alike, would you still link them?
Okay.
I'll take the bet.
Did she ever talk about family?
It's entirely your choice. We can subpoena her records, or you and I can talk.
We, uh, checked her records. She was adopted as an infant. 
Did you believe she was suicidal?
So then how does an attractive, successful 36-year-old woman hang herself from her own balcony?
Strangulation.
Huh. They would've finally met.
Well, people's first explanation with twins is always parapsychology, but the truth is, there's a lot of biological encoding at work. I mean, if you have the same musculature and bone structure in your hand, the chance of writing the same is not out of the question. If beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and you both see with the same eyes or taste with the same tongue ...
I do.
That's a federal offense, you know.
Mm-hmm.
That sucks.
Hmm?
Me, neither. It holds up. 'I would rather sit on a pumpkin and have it all to myself, than be crowded on a velvet cushion.'
The wheelchair brake attachment has been loosened.
Impact was from the left side. But the bolts were loosened on both sides.
Yeah. Who ordered it?
Force of impact propelled the body just over 47 feet.
External damage, mostly superficial.
Probably dead before he hit the ground.
Our killer pays in cash to avoid identification.
Yeah -- giving us her name.
Why?
Planted on two separate bodies by two separate killers. You know, Mickey Dunn practically owned Las Vegas -- these guys look like employees.
Rumor has it that Mickey had a percentage of the DI.
Yeah. I'll get PD to identify the last two. See what they have to say.
Brass just got a call from someone claiming that the ghost of Mickey Dunn wants to kill him.
The victims-- Ken Billings, Mason Carter, Derek Paul and Johnny D'Angelo -- all murdered in the last 24 hours.
Let's stick to what we do know-- all the victims worked for Mickey Dunn, who's been dead for thirty years.
That or fraud -- he either planted that Derringer at the crime scene, or maybe someone paid him to.
Someone who was there the night it went down.
Before the Cadillac was found.
And?
I'm not.
Our Mexican fisherman signed his television release form 'F. Kreuger.'
All I know is the master of all scary movies was Lon Chaney, Sr., the man of a thousand faces, and that's what we're looking for.
All the evidence says he was wearing state-of-the-art prosthetics.
Well, if he's got his driver's license, he could be using it to try and escape.
He doesn't need his car. He's got his face.
Her name is Natalie Davis. She works for our janitorial service.
This girl holds me responsible for the death of Ernie Dell. 
I took away the only person she ever loved so she's going to do the same thing to me.
Stop this! Tell me where Sara is!
If Sara's under the car, the metal will conceal her.
What do you know, Nick?
Hang on.
Warrick, how far was the last trip?
Nick, get all those locations to Brass. Tell him to focus his search on any destination within 34 miles.
Hey, we got an ID on the miniature killer. Her name is Natalie Davis. 
Yeah. Catherine and I just spoke to the biological father. He says he put Natalie up for adoption after she shoved her kid sister out of a tree house.
No, but with a name, it's just a matter of time.
Jim. Restrict your search to targets in the western desert.
Yeah, but none of that's going to tell us where she is. We need a store receipt or a parking stub, something with a location on it.
No. Natalie completed the miniature. I saw it in her eyes. Sara is under that car.
Did you notify S &amp; R?
Sara! 
Sara!
Catherine! I got shoe prints.
No.
Cath, look.
Oh, no.
Okay, thanks.
Park Service issued him a camping permit. He was supposed to hike out this morning.
Where is she, Catherine? It's 110 degrees. She's been out here all day, without water. She's disoriented, she's ... dehydrated.
Move over! I'm going with her!
I have to trust the people I work with, Jim.
He was off the clock.
He's very passionate about this case.
What does that mean? You think Gedda's got 'friends' inside the department?
Did you talk to IA yet?
That's because it wasn't about Gedda. It was about you.
I hope you know that's not gonna happen. You're in the rotation as of tomorrow, so go home.
You know, you keep pursuing this, you're going to end up suspended.
Well, that's consistent with him putting the body in your car.
Okay, I'll have Brass check it out. You stay out of it, though.
Sorry.
Hey, Mitch.
Where did you get this?
No, you didn't.
We found her purse and the bloody murder weapon in the place where you were sleeping. We found her dead body inside this car.
Hey! As of right now, you're suspended for two weeks.
You've had all your chances. You take the suspension or you're fired.
So, who found him?
Gil Grissom, Crime Lab.
What about the bull?
Is this the rope they tie around the bull?
Is that rosin? 
Do all the riders wear a glove?
He's not wearing one.
Guy was living the American dream. Every kid wants to grow up to be a cowboy.
Do you own the bull?
Your bull gave Cody Latshaw a pretty brutal beating.
Is it true that some riders tie the bull's testicles to get them to buck more?
Could a guy get a bull out of this chute without any help?
And open the gate.
I'm going to need to process your bull.
And this is Wintwister? What, uh ...
What would be the safest way for me to handle his hooves?
Do you think I could get him to step on something?
Think you could get him to step on this?
'And I will be your hero, your cowboy in the sun.'
I'm actually a fan of cowboy poetry.
Yeah, it's just a way of organizing your thoughts and feelings so that you can make sense of them.
Yeah, well, poetry can help you with that, too.
Well we know that Cody was alone when he died because he couldn't have opened the bucking chute by himself.
Whoever that someone was knew how to get into the arena, and also how to use the equipment. 
And?
Yeah, it's exquisite.
How'd you like to go on a roundup?
We got a match! Dustin Lightfoot. 
He had a cervical fracture from his earlier ride. It didn't take much to snap his spine.
I don't think it's about either girl. 
Did you read Tiffany's autopsy report?
So were Nancy's.
Wintwister.
I think that's why he went back to the arena that night. Wordsworth once wrote, 'Through love we feel we are greater than we know.' My guess is, riding that bull, Cody felt like a greater man.
Talk to me about the road.
Show me what you see.
Nice to see you, too, Maddy.
My team won't screw it up.
Are you done?
You need to prove that Alvarado ordered a hit on your witness.
We don't know yet. Our investigation is still ongoing.
Well, we found their signature at the crime scene. So it's possible they do know.
I got lots of tea.
CSI Sanders confirmed that the trajectory of the gun lined up with the victim's body as he tried to exit the vehicle.
The engine fire would have reached approximately 400 degrees within two minutes.
Enough heat was transmitted to the glove box to cause the gun inside to discharge.
Witness was killed by his own gun.
No, Your Honor, not yet.
We need a warrant to search his apartment.
Your Honor, Alvarado is an admitted member of La Tijera. Their initials were carved into the cheek of the murder victim in the house that Alvarado was seen exiting. We need the clothes that Alvarado was wearing that night.
Thank you.
I'll be in bed.
You feeling okay?
Yeah, well, there's burn patterns all over these walls. They must have splashed butane all over everything.
And butane dissipates quick. 
There's nails all over the place.
Green plastic. Sugar, butane, and nails. Add some egg whites in a soda bottle. You got a MacGyver bomb. Crude, but it works.
Mitch, I want to see this guy's hands.
Turn his pockets.
You got photos?
This 'L' looks like it was stenciled.
Then, it looks like the tagger painted over it a second time, to make it look freehand.
Hmm.
Reading upside down is a talent.
The leak. Ninety minutes after the warrant was issued, Alvarado's apartment went up.
Yeah, but according to this, everybody cleared. The only ones left are the grand jurors ... and Maddy Klein.
How did they contact you, Miss Leahy?
Can you give us a description of the woman?
How does Alvarado get his books?
I need to see every book that Alvarado checked out.
Alphabetical by author?
David Eggers.
There's pages missing.
Allende.
How many books has he read in the last 48 hours?
Where's The Inferno?
Just hold him.
This is a good book, Mr. Alvarado. Which Circle of Hell would you be in? 
Those who commit violence against others.
Officer, do you have a lighter? No pen, no paper ... so you used what you had, huh?
A book for paper, and for ink, urine.
Once the urine dries, the writing becomes invisible ... until it's heated, making the acid in the urine turn brown.
Then you..uh..put the book back in the library, another prisoner checks it out, tears out the page, gives it to a visitor, and you get your message out. Yes?
You okay?
I don't keep score, Madeleine.
Hi. 
She was our prime suspect in the Annabelle Fundt case.
Hemadin, among other things.
Yeah, she's not getting any younger.
Okay. I'm going home.
This is Grissom.
Please leave a detailed message after the tone.
'Ichabod was horror-struck on perceiving that he was headless.'
Vehicle tire rolled through it. Helmet has black abrasions on it consistent with being hit by a tire.
Head's over there. Blood trail leads up from here. We follow the blood.
Hey!
Where's his hand?
We didn't want you to know.
Where do you get your information about women, Conrad?
Nine years ago.
Maybe he didn't.
Which was present on both sides of his wounds but not on his clothing.
But we found his body off the road. There shouldn't be any transfer from truck tires.
Unless ...
We're trying to determine whether a steel-belted truck tire can decapitate a kid driving a go-cart.
Myths, legends, tall tales -- they all come from something real.
All right, let's go, fellas.
Come on, Conrad. There's always room for Jell-O.
When did you tell Ecklie we got involved?
Nine years ago.
Yeah.
You ... uh ... had too many questions about anthropology, for some reason. 
You had a ponytail.
We talked about this. 
Yeah.
No, thanks, I like to watch.
Yeah?
Okay.
The man was shot execution style--22 to the back of the head.
Woman was shot as well, bound and gagged. The guests next door complained about the noise, manager finally called the point. Unis found this.
Did you guys happen to see the Fitzgerald's thermometer on your way over? 
Sounds like it's getting hotter. 
This looks like a wet spot.
Semen.
Did you find any drug residue or paraphernalia?
We have one too many Bibles.
Burger Giant to go. They were eating it at the motel and someone had it here.
Mom, dad ... and two girls.
That doesn't seem fair, does it?
Greg? Do you have any allergies?
Give me a hand.
Did it work?
The exorcism-- did it work?
And he didn't believe.
You're primitive man on the savannah. You see something move out of the corner of your eye. You assume it's a hyena. You run, you live. If you assume it's the wind and you're wrong, you die. We have the genes of the ones who ran. We're genetically hardwired to believe living forces that we cannot see.
Hey. Bee frame. Inside, I've got the queen, the workers, the whole colony. 
I cleared it with Animal Control. This colony is healthy. I need it to study Colony Collapse Disorder. Bees are dying in record numbers everywhere.
There's no hard evidence to support that, though.
But the world will end ... someday.
Hey. I have something I'd like you to see.
The Macalino family computer was recovered from the stolen car. Archie ... found the chat logs.
Keep reading.
What would you do if you found this on Lindsey's computer?
Lock her in the attic, maybe?
The Macalinos were pushed all the way to an exorcism. Now, Alistair Rhodes says that he left the motel when his ritual failed. The video shows the father tried to stop it. He probably untied her. Right?
And Amy goes home to get her computer ... and kills her little sister.
I think maybe somebody gave him a lift.
Lacerations to his chest.
Lift his shirt up, will you, David?
Check the plumping.
Hate?
Eighteen years old.
Brian Towne. Lived in Verdant Glen.
So he's not an XXY.
Gynecomastia. Pre-op transsexuals take a lot of estrogen.
Estrogen level is five times the normal amount for an adult male.
Yeah, but there's no other pre-op drugs in his system. No spironolactone, no flutamide, progesterone.
Oh, I love it when you dress up.
Nope, so far it's healthy.
Well, the scent confuses the guard bees. They won't emit the pheromone that tells the colony there's an intruder.
These are the workers -- infertile females.
No, not unless you swat one, or close one up in your hand, or freak out. Go ahead, take off your glove.
See? It's cool.
The worker bees defend the hive, procure the pollen, make the honey, nurture the larvae and pupae in each of these brood cells.
You know, maybe we should get married.
I'm sorry. 
No, no, don't, don't, don't pick it out. Makes it worse, releases the venom into the bloodstream. It's better to scrape it.
So, uh... what do you think, you know, about...
Yeah?
Nothing. Why? 
What's in the cooler?
Huh. 
I can process those fish if you like.
Yes?
That was fun, wasn't it?
What do you see?
Not carp.
It's the water.
Good, Hodges. Well, now that we're working together again ... 
... take at least two organ samples along with blood. Send them with these water samples to our clinical lab for hormone quants.
Twenty years ago, Verdant Glen was far enough outside Vegas to get the right to use well water for drinking. They also got approval to remove waste water at a private plant. There, it was cleaned, creating 'grey water,' which was used for secondary purposes -- watering lawns, washing cars, everything but drinking. The treatment plant then stored excess grey water in the reservoir.
It passed every water quality test.
Brian's level and tox panel correlate to the carp. Cyden was collecting water samples from the reservoir, the tap, and the treatment plant.
According to Cyden's research, the hormone levels in the tap water are nearly equal to the water in the reservoir.
They do. Cyden was convinced that the ground water was contaminated.
He discovered that the reservoir was improperly lined, allowing the grey water to leech into the ground water.
There's a good chance that others have been affected, especially children who were born to women who were living there while they were pregnant.
Obviously, it's not. Or the lining's defective. Which is the decision I think Cyden had come to right before he was shot.
Do they plan to prosecute Jonah Quinn?
Are you going to prosecute her?
It's all out of our hands now.
You can't give information about a case to the media. You'll get fired.
No, why?
Who?
Who's that?
What's the matter with you?
Go tell Catherine what you found, make sure that you pull all the old evidence out of storage in case she needs it.
How long have you been here?
Why haven't these bodies been released?
The FBI field office is right next to the Strip. What's taking them so long?
What's going on?
DNA will tell us if this is your kid. But it does look like your killer came to Vegas.
Looks like he hit his head on the table.
Well, we don't know that yet.
No birthmarks.
So the only way to confirm the identity ...
Well, then you'll just have to wait for your answer.  You know, maybe now would be a good time for you to brief us on the original case.
Maybe there isn't one.
Except in the US last year, there were almost a hundred. Some things are just random.
Yes, actually, I have.
I know. We ran his palm print. Doesn't match. 
And decided he'd bring his kid with him?
And while he's playing cards, they both get murdered.
Both single, with no kids.
If there is a pattern.
I'll call in some additional AV techs, help Archie get through the footage, ... 
... but you know, I've learned that sometimes you can go faster by going slow.
I gathered that from your interrogation technique. You know, maybe you should go back to your hotel, take a nap.
What's wrong with my office?
That's an irradiated fetal pig. I used it to determine the effects of radiation on tissue.
For fun.
No, no, it's fine. Jack Malone, FBI. Sara Sidle, CSI.
Thank you. I'll see you when I see you.
Hank's my dog. She walks him for me sometimes.
Really? And, uh ... how'd it work out for you?
The victim have circular indentations on her head?
My guess is, this is the hammer we didn't find at the Davis house.
Huh.
He lost the proceeds from the Vegas murders at the Tangiers. So, he probably needed more cash.
Driver's license is on top, like before.
Sara? You okay?
No. He picks houses with no security systems, or dogs. Enters at night when most people are asleep, through open doors or windows. Easy targets.
Grissom.
No, I'm at a railroad spur about a quarter of a mile from the house.
Carmen Davis's house was next to the tracks, too.
Freight trains carry bulk fertilizer. I think your killer is riding the rails.
All the previous murders were committed within about a mile of an active railroad spur.
You know, you have the authority to stop all the trains coming in and out of Nevada.
.45 auto. Same caliber as the one taken from the Boulder City double.
Was the waitress in the car with him?
That's a pretty good head start.
Grissom.
Listen, do me a favor. Take a look at the map, find the nearest railway spur to our location.
Any other trains pass through here in the last hour?
Can you stop that train?
No, I like a good field trip.
Where'd you get that hat?
Maybe, uh ... he came here to kill his ex-wife.
Grissom.
Yeah, there's a reason for that.
Thanks, Jim.
Hey, Jack. I don't think that trooper was waving at Gina.
You said the kid who was kidnapped was six years old when he was adopted, birth parents unknown.
Terry Wicker was looking for his ex-wife ... 
A family reunion.
You keeping tabs on her?
The one that got away?
Okay. I'll see if I can clear it with Ecklie. Catherine has to supervise, though. You report to her.
What are you doing?
Looks like it's backwards.
It's possible.
You know, Sara, some cases, some suspects can get under your skin. Like this tooth. But you can't let it make you feel bad. If you want, we can put Nick on this.
Okay.
Hey.
I was going to ask you the same question. Listen, I'm worried about you.
Hi.
Okay, what's up?
Judy, have you seen Sara?
Thank you.
Ecklie's been on me to finish the monthly stats, so I need a list of all the lab call-outs from dispatch as soon as you can. 
Thanks.
Yeah, it's about all I do.
We've talked a little.
San Francisco, visiting her mother.
I can't speak for her.
I can't talk, I'm really busy.
Have a nice day.
Why?
I'm sorry. I've just had a lot of ... uh ... I've been busy.
It's not what she wants.
I want her to be happy.
Night, Greg.
What are you doing?
I like games.
Yeah.
Your 'speech' in front of your computer, and you take a bullet to the head.
Am I eligible?
Okay. So during the basic process of the scene, what do I find?
Then my first blush theory is a walk-by.
I'm going to need the bullet.
Is it intact?
IBIS.
So you were shot by a weapon that no longer exists.
Okay, let's go over your snuff film, shall we? I want to see exactly what you did.
Professional curiosity. I guess.
You took the shot straight into your head, -- 
-- but according to the video, you were not facing the hallway.
Which means the bullet didn't come from there.
It must've come from here.
A zip gun.
And a remote trigger. What model year is the pager?
So no call-back numbers. Pre-1990 pagers didn't store them.
I'm just getting started.
Do I have to walk over to the GCMS or will you just tell me?
Okay, but the bullet was pitted on the base, which is the result of exposure to smokeless gunpowder. Which means that the bullet that killed you was fired twice.
The killer test-fires the gun, knowing it will be destroyed, and keeps the bullet and the casing. 
He puts the bullet in a metal tube on a wad of black powder. 
With a pager trigger, it's essentially a remote controlled musket. Call the number from any phone or through the Internet and ...
Well, Bobby Dawson is an early 19th Century firearm enthusiast. He ... uh ... loads and fires muskets for fun.
What do you got against Bobby Dawson?
No. Bobby was framed. You drew me a map. 
The path of the bullet, if not stopped by your brain mass, would have continued straight through into Ballistics, where Bobby works. Now, Bobby's a real gun guy, and no gun guy would ever position himself down-range of a shot. You're more than a victim, Hodges.
According to your video, you straightened up just before the fatal shot was fired. 
You knew it was coming. 
And you made sure that you were in the perfect position to catch it.
True.  Let's play another.
No.
Yeah, she was.
Let's play the game, shall we?
Where's Warrick?
Where's the other one?
I take it he came out of the truck?
What's the TOD, David?
All right. Catherine, you and I got the bodies. Greg, since Warrick's MIA, you have a choice: the truck or the trail.
Be my guest.
This is your business. You were first up. That means you're supposed to be here first.
You get to process the trash truck.
But get it off the street. Tow it to the impound yard.
When was this taken?
Then what?
All right, we got to get his personnel file. What about the other vic?
The good old days.
Back when they had real eggs, not powdered ones.
You have a cell phone paid for by the department. You call, you say you're running late. What's going on with you?
You've got your work. Don't screw that up.
Maybe that's why Brass couldn't find the registration record.
These old blue license plates were issued in the '80s.
I think this guy was disguising his truck. It was orange before it was green. They used to use orange garbage trucks in the '80s.
Maybe when he crushed the body. That's why all the garbage flew out.
Shorts.
Less gunpowder, less noise.
He found Jason sleeping. Why make a mess if you don't have to?
Well, if he was, we still have to find the guy who hired him.
That explains the garbage.
Until he himself got whacked at the Wisconsin Dells in 1983.
Every mob-owned business in Vegas shut down when Pezzulo died.
Our hit man's good for two murders. The unsolved in '93, where he actually used a gun, and Jason Crewes, who he suffocated. So, who hired him?
Yeah, but we don't work off feelings, do we?
Any evidence? 
Any consistent suspects?
What are you saying?
Okay.
Listen to me. Putting Gedda in jail is not gonna solve your problems. You just got the rest of the night off.
Pay the bill and let's go. 
You've been here twice already today. We're leaving.
I'm on the clock.
So you want to get fired.
You think he's that stupid?
Well, now you gotta pay for it, 'cause we're not allowed to accept gifts.
Get in the cab, Warrick.
Go on.
Go home. Sleep it off. I'll see you in my office in the morning.
No, no, no! You can't cross the tape! Not this time.  This is your car.

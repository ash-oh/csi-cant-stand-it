Woo! I haven't been this out of breath since I bet Frank Sinatra I wasn't ticklish.
In a few minutes, there'll be cake and champagne, so stick around; the party's not over yet.
No, no, no. I'm fine. Go get the cake ready.
And, Eve ... light the candles.
For years, I did two shows a night, partied with the boys for hours, got a little sleep, played some tennis, gave interviews, got on stage and did it all over again. That's talent. You've got a look. Pace yourself, honey.
Just get it over with.
Oh ... I thought this was my last birthday.
No, I ... I always wear one outfit to greet guests, another for dinner and dancing, and another for dessert.
Thanks.
He worked the children's hospital dance a few weeks ago. He was charming.
I thought he could use the job.
I was changing. I'd ordered a drink brought up.
He was crawling, to get away.
And then I heard another shot.
That's, uh ... that's when I knew it was a mob hit.
Look, if you find his family, I'd like to do something for them. I mean, after all, if he hadn't come in just then, I'd be dead.
Do you have a first name, Sanders?
Greg ...
Do you ... ?
Thank you.
Hot off the press. I didn't hold back. I named names. After all this time, I thought, who'd care?
Set them down ... there.
An army travels on its stomach. I wanted you and your people to know how grateful I am for all you've done for me.
Oh, come on. Cold cuts ... a little shrimp salad ... 
Well ... 
Having fun with my book, Greg?
Under the floor ... ? You tell me.
What do you know. Tony always said I'd be taken care of.
You'd have to ask Tony. Where is the money now?
Oh. And, uh ... when will it be returned?
You do that. You know ...  The boys who want me dead have been doing this a lot longer than you have. I need you to catch up. Fast. Oh, and remember, when your tummy starts to rumble, I tried to help.
The gang's all here!
Well, please, sit. I-I have no secrets from Bobby ... my guardian angel.
Please, sit. How often do you get invited to the best table in town?  I know you must be hungry.
Wha ... ?
It was horrible.
Well ... it-it all happened in such a flash ...
This has been fun, but ... we have to go. Beauty sleep, you know. Speaking of which ... when is that ugly yellow tape coming off my bedroom door?
Anymore questions ... just call.
Try to relax, honey. This'll be easy. I'll be on the bed, one shot. Don't be sloppy.
What the hell?
Nobody steals from me.
If you see Tony, tell him I love him.

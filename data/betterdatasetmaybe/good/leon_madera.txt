Put your tongue in your mouth, Jake.
Shh-shh-shh.
Oh, Kenny's a self-mutilator. He suffers from Renfield's syndrome; gets off on blood.
Couple of weeks ago I caught him gouging himself with a carpet staple.
Here you go, padre. Wash your worries away.
Thank you.
I work here.
Here you go, Robbie. Here's your feel-good. 
Who's next?
Oh, come on, Earl.  There you go.
Hey, you know I'm gonna bust your ass on the court, right?
You better bring your 'A' game next time.
Come on, Chuck, I got something for you.
Thanks.
Look, dude ... I get 22-K a year. That's nothing. Diddly-squat. I should get hazard pay. These people, I get ... I get spit on, puked on, peed on, bitten. I get my hair yanked out, I get my ass pinched, I get ... I get death threats. All for 22-K. So I supplement my income. It don't hurt nobody.
Look, these places, they overmedicate all the time. It controls the population. And I don't endanger the patients, okay? I-I'm all about the patients.
Robbie, hold on a second, hold on a second, will you?
No. All right, no way, man. That's a story. 'Kay? That's not why he went to seclusion.
He freaked out in group. I wasn't even there. Ask somebody who was. 
Am I gonna lose my job? 'Cause these people ... need me.

Mr. Matthews.
So ruled. Fruit of the poisonous tree. What else do you have?
You have no other evidence to present?
I find insufficient evidence to hold the defendant over for trial. He's free to go.
Are you suggesting that I violate his constitutional rights, counselor?
Okay. If you can't make your case, Mr. Fife walks. We will recess for 24 hours.
Ms. Finn?
Based on the evidence, I find sufficient probable cause to order the defendant to stand trial for the sexual assault and murder of Rachel Lyford.

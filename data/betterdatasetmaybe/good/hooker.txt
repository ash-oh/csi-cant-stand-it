Yo, baby, look, why're you rushing the day? We got plenty of night left.
See, that's something we already got in common, 'cause I'm working, too.
mm-Hmm.
Him? No. No, sir. But I tell you one thing. Good-looking white boy like that? I know plenty of women who'd be tripping over their platform to get a little somethin' somethin'. But no, sir, he wasn't nobody's customer.
Some john, I don't know.
Mm-hmm. I couldn't wait to get out of there. He was acting real nervous.  Now I know why. I took care of him; he's asleep. So you're not gonna bust me, right?
Same time next week?
Okay.
I know he wasn't into breath-play. Choking on purpose. More bang for your buck.
No. Whatever happened, happened fast.

Daddy came to ballet tonight.
My ...
My ... my - my prince ...
No, it's not just a play. I was Sleeping Beauty and you guys ruined it.
I want to go home.
No, mom. I want to go with dad.
Mommy ... 
Mommy ... please ... scared ... all alone. 
Daddy... 
Mommy, please! I'm scared... all alone! ... 
We hit something.
I don't know. There's lots of water, mommy!
No, the water's in the car?
No.
Daddy said the hospital.
I saw the castle.
Yeah.
There was a bridge. We went through a fence. 
Mommy!
Mommy! Hurry!
Mommy!
Mommy, I can't! I can't. I'm scared!
Please, mommy.
No, mommy! No!
Mommy.
The lady who was driving had pink hair. I don't remember her name.
He had a stomachache.
The lady got out and then daddy fell out. He didn't come back.
Mom?  He's dead, isn't he?
Leatherbey's. He got me a banana split. 
Just water.
I don't know.
I fell asleep in the car, and I woke up when we stopped.
No. It was a building.
I don't know.
Daddy said he had a meeting. He told me to stay in the car and keep the doors locked.
Mom, mom, it's okay. I said I could take care of myself. I told him I could stay in the car. Just don't be mad at him. He didn't do anything wrong.
She was outside in the parking lot.
Maybe. Well, he was mad at her. And then they, they were running back to the car. Daddy was holding his stomach.
Daddy, what's wrong?
It's okay, mommy. It's okay. It's okay.
Yeah.
I took it out, like you always tell me to. It's Thursday.
Uh, hello, Mom, you okay?
I don't, I don't want to.
Are you going to go out again?
You're late.
You said you would watch the rehearsal.
Surprise.
Fine. Whatever.  I got a solo.
It's Romeo and Juliet.
Mmmm!
Mom.
Mom.

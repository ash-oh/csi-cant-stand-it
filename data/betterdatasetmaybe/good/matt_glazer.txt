Glazer. Yeah, we're just finishing up. No traffic. I'll be there in about twenty minutes. Okay.
Vegas?
You know a Jim Brass?
Over there.
Matt Glazer, L.A.P.D. Crime lab.
Trunk's been stripped clean.
Oh, they missed a spot.
Looks like two large caliber bullet holes.
I don't know.
Let's haul it back to impound and find out.
I'll be in touch.
Clothes test positive for lead wipe. Confirmed bullet hole.
Yeah, but the autopsy report said she wasn't shot.
About seven and a half, eight inches up.
Looks like a .45. Big, fat and slow. Lucky for us, it didn't have enough power to go through-and-through the gas tank.
Well, that tweaker you busted just got bumped off the top of the list. He had a nine millimeter.
We do have that here.
This guy married?
Mm-hmm. Anyone else's gaydar going off?
How much, you figure?
I can't get a clean read.
I'll get a sample for DNA.

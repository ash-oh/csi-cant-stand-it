Uh, they call me Blinky.
Best friends since kindergarten. Now I work for him.
Pretty much everything. You know, bought his stuff, hooked him up. Drove him to meetings.
I ordered room service. I wanted to see if he was hungry. Boom, there he was.
Uh, no way. No. I watch those murder shows, you know? I know to just keep my hands to myself, and, uh, call the cops.
Nah, bro, I-I-I ... kind of got the angle of the dangle going. The boing, boing, boing.
I, uh, took a Prevalis on the plane over. I been pitching a tent for, like, eight hours. Yeah, I-I think I need to consult a physician.
Oh, uh, nothing. I mean, uh, I smoked a little herb at the club, but that's it.
Oh, Jules? Oh, no, he, uh ... he won't even take aspirin. You know, he's organic. You know, treats his body like a temple.
Can I sit down?
I don't understand.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. We were not down like that.
Rise and shine, buddy! Room service.
Dude, Julian?
He did it to himself. He did it to himself. So, I took the pantyhose, and I took them off the light.
And then I put his boxers back on. I wasn't going to let his mom open up US magazine and see her boy like that. Jules, he always did me right. Now I just wanted to do him the same.

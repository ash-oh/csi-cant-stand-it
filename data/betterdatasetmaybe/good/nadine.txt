You're costing me money, here. I've got a second shift at the Monaco.
I can tell you've never served drinks. Catch him in the right mood with the right pot, he can make your month.
I wasn't making eyes with him.
I'm a waitress, not a call girl. I was playing one guy against the other. You want to make money? You bait. Besides ... I thought Doyle had a heart attack.
Yes, I do mind.
I'll tell you this. You bust me, you better bust all of us.
You can't pin this on me.
: My eyedrops. Look, you saw the way it works. I didn't have time.
Whiskey sour, decaf, bottled water, beer.
Just give them to me. I am, too.
You want motive?
He was a 'Stiff'. I gave him a standard eyedrop shooter. I was trying to give the guy diarrhea, not kill him. Doyle sat at my table night after night and never even so much as tosses me one of those piddly-ass candies of his my way. In my line of work, there are two kinds of tippers: The 'Georges' and the 'Stiffs.' Matt was a 'George'; Doyle was a 'Stiff'. Now, if you want to charge me with conspiracy of trying to make a guy crap his pants then fine, go ahead. I'm guilty. But I didn't kill him.

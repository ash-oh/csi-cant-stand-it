Mr. Grissom?
Please come in.
We like it.
We bought the year we adopted Craig, so that would be '92.
Craig, what did I tell you you had to do when our dinner guest arrived?
Craig's school is sponsoring an identification program for students. Parents get one, too.
That reminds me, Doug. Be sure to tell Mr. Grissom where you bought your rain boots. He was admiring them earlier.
My husband's only hobby is driving around the state looking for bargains, rain or shine. And I tell him, 'you're a Judge now. We don't need bargains.'
Truth is, I think he just enjoys his private time.
Douglas?

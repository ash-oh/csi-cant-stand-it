How did you guys even find out about me? I mean, I-I didn't report it. I just ... ran. And I left school. Nobody knew, not even Paige.
And now you guys think the guy that attacked me had something to do with Paige's disappearance?
You don't understand. I can't remember. I never could remember.
There was this party ... 
It was a floor party. That's why I had to leave school. Somebody that I was living with attacked me ... and I was never going to know who.

I love those shoes. WOMAN: You can wear them again. WOMAN: What about the veil? WOMAN: You've got to remember the veil.
I usually don't do this. I-I mean, especially with somebody that I just met.
Uh ...
Promise?
You are so bad.
I was talking to Shirley -- she said the only way to make money in that town is slots.
... 1-25 roger ...
... 1-41 north ... 
I know. I was, uh, I was on the bus.
I don't ... I don't know.  I'm sorry.
I remember this one guy kept checking me out. Bought a lot of turkey jerky. Oh, and this one couple was having a fight.
I don't know.
Hi.
My kitty's pierced. 
Want to see?
... I'm on every club's VIP list ...
I don't want to be on your list.
Thank you.
Hi.
So far. Thanks for asking. 
I don't know. Last I remember, the foam was rising ... 
... and my heel went into something ... soft ...
... thought it was someone's foot.
Heel broke.
Never saw blood.
I've 'relationshipped' about a dozen guys on the circuit, including Trey. Nothing ends -- we still all meet up at The Club.
... and the way he gave it to me ... believe me, he's the last guy I'd want dead.
How do you want it.
I like yours.
Ow.
'Gil'? Any chance you found my thong? Silver lam√©, probably twisted in knots. 
Bad little pig boy. Bad, bad, bad. ... You naughty, bad pig. Oinky, sloppy pig.
'Mommy' says no. I said, no.
Oh ... who needs the belt?
Say you're sorry.
I just want my boy back.
This won't help, don't you see? After me, there'll be others. You'll have to go on killing, on and on until they catch you. I won't be the last; ...
... there'll be others after me. You can't help yourself because you're mad, mad, mad!
Hello?
Hello?!
Burgess! Burgess!
Burgess!
Burgess!
Director Covallo is ready to see you.
I have to get out of here!
Oh, my god!
Don't ...
The last time I was out here, this was all desert.
Work. 
Stop!
I picked up the taxi at McCarran. I'm in town on business staying with my cousin who's a few blocks away.
No, he was looking at me.
I think I yelled, 'stop,' but it was too late.
No, no, no, no. He got out of the cab to see what happened and ... then he freaked and he got back in and he reached for his radio. That's when the guys attacked him.
No, he was calling for help.
You always think you'll be a great witness but ...
There were so many of them and it happened so fast.
He was just begging for his life. 
I couldn't see their faces but I know it was them; all of them. They were the only ones around.
Stop!
You've got it all wrong. I'm telling you. Nothing happened.
Thank you. I didn't feel a thing.
Hey, Doodle-pie. I can't stop thinking about your enormous feet. Call me.
Honey, just pass him.
Calm down and just pass him.

Illegal word-- that's a minute penalty.
My husband keeps dropping hints about my anniversary present. Says he hopes I like calypso music. I think it's a cruise.
I feel guilty.
Help! I need help!
There's a baby inside the car!
It's not my car. Help! Somebody help us!
Help!
Guess you weren't his type.
Whoo!
Sir, they're ready for you now.
Got that right.
No. No! WOMAN: No! WOMAN: Get away!
No!
Dr. Jacobs, dial 102, please. Dr. Jacobs ...

It's not smack, it's silicone. Gives you good cheek bones.
Did you find a man in Selena's trailer?
I'm sure I don't know. But one thing I do know, that's not Selena's car.

Why aren't they here? Why should we believe your evidence?
Las Vegas Crime Lab? How can I help you?
See you tomorrow, Dr. Dave.
Even your own district attorney said she wasn't aware.
We're done here.

Nice hat, honey.
Assault in progress.
Somebody help! WOMAN: Help! Help him!

I gave Simone my license a couple of months ago. She was always getting her fakes snatched by bouncers, so I gave her my expired one. Bouncers only ever look at the birth date. We look alike.
Kind of, in ways, like her nose and ... parts of her chin and cheeks.  And we both have nice butts. But ... that's not on a license.
No way. She was so nice, super cool ... all about fun.
Yeah. Mostly guys. Guys with money.
I never met any of them. They weren't long-term things. She would just go out with them to party.
No, no s*x. She would just use them to get drunk and hang out at penthouses.
I don't know, but she always starts off her night at the same place: the Gold Square on Sunset.
It was kind of a confidence builder for her. Simone was a star in there. She'd always come out with at least a couple numbers.

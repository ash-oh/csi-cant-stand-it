I did.
She called the office. Wanted to know about renting out Oakley's Saloon for a private party.
Money's money -- doesn't matter who's handing it to you, right, Dad?
But I'm learning.
I swung by. Wanted to meet her.
Yeah. Told her to lock up when she was done.
Right, Dad. 'Cause you always do.
Why do you need my DNA?
I didn't touch her, okay? I didn't kill Porter.
Porter knew I lied. He wanted fifty grand to keep his mouth shut. And I was gonna pay him. I went to the bank to get the money, but somebody drained the account.
There was a million dollars in that account last week. Who authorized the transfer?
I went there to kill my father. 
I knew he was going to meet Heather, but for some reason, she didn't show. And Porter got up the courage to ask my dad for the money. He'd seen my father with Heather.
The Marquis de Sade's got nothing on my old man. Inflicting pain is his idea of foreplay.
Do you know how much money he spent abusing women? He didn't leave anything for my mother and me except for more abuse. It had to stop.
His phone's off; every time his phone's off, he's with her.
No, he wouldn't do that, not after Porter.
I didn't do anything. She solicited me. Strictly a business deal. She needed the money. I paid her close to $1 million for this, you know that? That's about all I'm gonna say. I'll be talking with my lawyer.

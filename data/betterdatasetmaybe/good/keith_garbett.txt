Mom, I got your voice mail.
What's going on?
Hi. Look, we'll help in any way we can.
Sure. May I ask why? 
What evidence?
My father's innocent.
No, I was living in L.A.
Look ... whatever you need from us ...  ... mom ... ?
Mr. Stokes.
Well, tell me you've got some good news. Dad's lawyer says the case could get tossed.
Sure.
I did some clubbing in my twenties. What does this have to do with the investigation?
Why? You know, I'm sorry, but I don't exactly trust you guys. You destroyed my family. You let my dad rot in jail for five years, and now you're coming after me? No way. Forget it.
It wasn't my restaurant. It wasn't my problem.
It should tell you that I love my father.
My father had nothing to do with it.

I didn't kill Mrs. Cutler, if that's what you're thinking.
We live across the street from the Cutlers.
My family. Mother, father, and brothers.
Until I graduate next month.
I don't play sports. Helps with the tuition.
On a cold day, yeah. Sometimes she'd make me coffee.
Yeah.
Okay. Yeah, I was there. I was hitting the wife.
Yeah. But it wasn't my idea, all right? She was ... she was really unhappy in her marriage. Me and Mrs. Cutler were in the middle of it when ... when Mr. Cutler came home early.
I guess that's when I lost my sock.
Mr. Cutler was ... was so pissed, I ... I barely even recognized him.
No.
I don't know. I think so. I didn't see anything else.

Hey, Stokes.
BLM chopper pilot. They always buzz diablo canyon looking for hikers in distress. Or worse.
No, just the vic: Stacy Warner, 26. Las Vegas resident. I scanned for a missing persons on her. Nothing.
Paramedics and mine. Same path. Walked straight in, straight out.
Could have lost her footing and hit her head.
But she's not wearing a jacket.
Gum, sugar-free.
Soon as the coroner moves her.
NESTFS.?
Yeah. Mr. Hudson ... you own this house with Stacy Warner, is that right?
Any idea how this blood got there?
Can you account for your whereabouts this week?
I'm all for retracing the girl's steps but it wouldn't hurt to bring in some cadets.
Air feels thin to me.
Check it out.
You said the vic was wearing light layers of clothing, right?
You want to run it?
So then what? He drowns her with canteen water? 
I'm going to let you run that by the D.A.
So why'd a cagey guy like our suspect leave his jacket up here?
And she just left your jacket wedged under some rocks.
You're not under arrest.
So this Mountain Shadow Effect -- the barometric pressure spikes down the temperature strikes down ...
The mountains get a flash flood.
So, she was up here hiking when the weather changed.
Takes one to the head ... on to the basalt rock. She's trying to clear the cobwebs when the rain hit.
A couple hours worth of sun water dries up.
If she had a good map she might have been able to find her way out of the highlands by nightfall.
No. You altered the map, but you didn't make it rain. 
Security guard. No party list but he did see each car that left the night of the party and morning.

Uh, she cut my hair.
Well, I-I took Svetlana out once for. For ice cream. It was ... it was a hot day.
Yeah, that's it. She, uh, gave me some sob story about how she was married to some abusive guy, you know, and how, uh ... she begged me to help, and ... blah, blah, blah, blah. I don't ... I don't need that kind of drama. I don't. 
I'm a real estate agent.
No. Why?  Something happen to Svetlana?
Oh.
Sure. Yeah, go ahead.
Tar ... I ... where? I mean, I have no idea what you're talking about.
I can explain that. That was from ...
No, I didn't. No, stop, please. Listen. She ... she ran away.
You know, after everything that we'd been through and everything, this just seemed really, uh ... it was cold.  Didn't sound like her. She usually called me ... Kenski.
What was my relationship? My relationship was, uh ... we were, uh ... we were in love.
Her husband bought her, so he thought he owned her. And Svetlana was way out of his league. And what she wanted to do was fast track her divorce. So she thought maybe if she made it look like Andrew had beat her, that that would do it, but that didn't do it because he'd actually never hit her. So ... 
She begged me.
I just loved her.

Jesse? Jesse?
Jesse ... Jesse, can you hear me? Jesse, please!
Jesse!!
I, uh ... I never bring Jesse to the park. But this afternoon, the backyard just couldn't hold him, so we came here and ... uh ... he was on the swings; I couldn't even get him off, and then I look around and he's gone; he's just ...
I'm not leaving.  Not without Jesse.
Yes.
He was white ... 
Uh ... just under six feet, I think.
Jeans. 
Did he take Jesse?
Uh ... his jacket. It's in the car. I'll get it for you.
Whoa! Whoa! What are they doing?
I just bought it for him. He's been growing so fast. I'm sorry, I ... 
They're ...
Sorry about the mess.
Jesse was so full of energy this morning. He didn't give me time to clean up.
Uh, yeah, that's, uh, that's from last month.
Sure.
Jesse's home-schooled. We do art together ... music ... everything. 
Do you have children?
Oh, right, right. Um ... maybe ... maybe his stuffed dinosaur? He holds it while he's sleeping.
Why do you need that?
Well, I'll get those things for you.
Jesse. When he remembers. Which is as about as often as he remembers to brush his teeth.
He'd never do that.
No. No. No. You're going to find him. If something happened, I'd know. 
I'd know here. 
The, um ... the colonel and his wife. We're, uh, we're not in touch anymore. Ever since Dwight was ... ever since Dwight died, my father-in-law thinks he should be raising Jesse, not me. He runs that house like an army barracks. Do you know what that does to a boy? Well, I saw what it did to Dwight, and I will not let him do that to Jesse.
They took him.
I will raise my own son-- not you.
No.
You can't have him, okay?
Just leave us alone.
No, please.
Uh, uh ... I'm ju ... I'm just trying to stay positive. And, um, you know, I know that Jesse'll be safe at home again soon. 
So. I know he'll be safe.
Oh, God, where is he?
Jesse! 
Jesse! 
Oh, Jesse, thank God. Thank God you're okay. No, no, no, it's okay. Mommy is here. You're safe now.
No, your mommy's here, honey.
What did they say to you? 
What did they make you say, sweetheart?
Look at me. Just look at me. Don't look at those people. Just look at me. Just look right here.
Here you go, sweetie.
Okay.
It's okay, sweetheart. He's a friend.
Oh, wait.
He gets cold.
Thank you.
Hi. Can I take Jesse home now?
Of course, anything.
What?
You know, he doesn't stay up this late.
Can I take Jesse home now?
I ... that's impossible.
No, no ... what have you done with Jesse?
No. Where is he?
Jesse?
Jesse? Jesse, where are you?!
I need to see my son!  Jesse! Jesse, where are you?!
Please! Please! Jesse! Jesse! Jesse, where are you?!
Jesse.
Jesse? Where are you?! Jesse?!
We went to the park. I-I brought Jesse's new jacket. He was on the swings and when I wasn't looking, a man in a blue cap took him.
I-I ... that's a ... I am not the one that should be here. You should be talking to the man that took Jesse.
You saw him. You were ... you were there while I held him in my arms. Why are you putting me through this? Tell me. Why?

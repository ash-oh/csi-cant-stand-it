Frank ...
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
I said I was sorry 'cause I'm not supposed to be out by myself.
Well, I came home from special school, I found Adanto in the kitchen.
I love you.
Just before school.
No. No, I won't. Scout's honor.
I love you, too.
Said he was going to buy me a shiny new car and a driver to take me anywhere I wanted to go. 
He said we were going to be rich.
I love you, too.
He killed himself?
No. Why would he do that?
I-I was just trying to help my brother. Oh ...  I want Frank.
No, I don't want another guardian.  I want Frank!

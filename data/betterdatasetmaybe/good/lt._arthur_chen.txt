It's 10-by-18-foot cell built for 25 people. We've got thirty-five mutts and no place to put the extras. Between the yo's, the cholos and the rednecks, it was bound to happen.
Cops round them up, we process them. It usually doesn't take long, but today we got jammed.
Computer went down, plumbing backed up. You name it, we had it.
No. I rechecked the roster. We don't want the yo's killing each other in custody. Why we bother, I'll never know.
They don't need a reason. Bad monkeys at the zoo.
Arresting officer did a bad search.
What?
Is there something you want to get off your chest?
I don't like what you're implying about me or my men.
All I know, there's one less b*st*rd I gotta watch my back for. There's five of us, so the odds are in their favor. You're a crime scene tech. I'm law enforcement, which means you don't get to tell me what to do in my jail.
I think we're done here.
Catherine Willows?
Lieutenant Arthur Chen, watch commander for Central Holding.
Are you telling me we arrested the wrong guy?
Arresting officer did his job; I did my job.
Your subordinate Warrick Brown did.
You're a civilian, but even you understand 'chain of command'. Now, I'm giving you an opportunity to adjust his attitude. Don't make me.

Look, if this is about my ex ... cop pulled me over outside Moapa. Jane lives in Vegas. I didn't violate any damn court order, all right?
Is that a crime?
I haven't seen that kid since he was in his diapers. 
Geez, I didn't kill him, if that's where you're going to.
Which one?
No, I don't have a Smith &amp; Wesson.
That got stolen.
No, no. Come on, man, whoa, whoa, hey. You know what? Last night, I was at Taos, New Mexico, okay? I didn't cross over until ... it was the afternoon in Nevada. Check it out. Adobe Inn. Watched pay-per-view and I had a pizza, okay?

When I left this place, it was all grey walls and cinder blocks. Very fancy.
Cost of living, better commute. I socked away a few bucks, bought a nice place in Green Valley.
I guess you could say that. I like to get to the heart of things right away.
Whoa. October 17, 1999.
Yeah.
Hey, I'm not sure I like your tone.
It's my son's birthday. Day I caught the case, my wife went into labor. It was rough. There were complications. Anyway, I was out for weeks taking care of her. Used up all my vacation time. When I got back, there were a half-dozen cases on my desk. My captain told me to let it go. Look. We canvassed the neighborhood. No name. She was homeless, hooking for drug money.
We didn't need to do a test. We found her at Paradise and Flamingo. What else would she be doing there?

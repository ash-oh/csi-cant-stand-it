Ryan has a scholarship to Duke. He's not going to throw it away for some chippie.
Ryan doesn't have a curfew. But he never stays out all night.
If anyone knows anything about our son, please contact the Las Vegas Police. He's a great kid, with a bright future ahead of him, and we just want him home where he belongs.
Are you telling me you're not gonna prosecute the girl that killed my son?
Got away with murder.

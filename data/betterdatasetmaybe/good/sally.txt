This is Sally. Who's this?
What kind of date?
Yeah, I'll come with you. You sure you can afford the airfare, darlin'?
Where you at?
What do you look like?
All right, half an hour, and I'll be there.
Calling me to a crime lab is cute. It's still entrapment.
Really?
We dated. 
He was trying to play the, you know, 'I'm a big baller' role.
Do you got a present for me, baby?
He must have won some big jackpot or something -- I can tell when money's new. He pulled this big wad out of his Wal-Mart pants. 
But he seemed harmless. 
Kind of sweet, actually. He offered me a deal on a vacation.
I don't know. I guess. He offered me this.
I've never been to Hawaii.
I'd let you take me to Hawaii.
So am I.

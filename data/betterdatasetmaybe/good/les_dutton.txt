Are you sure it's Petrov?
What makes you think this event happened here?
If there was a murder in our kitchen don't you think that, uh ... I'd know about it?
Give me till after the rush?
Okay. Kitchen's all yours.
Oh, geez. Uh, waiters probably put the candles too close to the wall. I've told them a million times.
That's a gu√©ridon used for tableside cooking.
Ever since a television star from the '70s burned his face by one. It's changed dining forever.
I lied about the candles. It was an accident.
We do special requests for special customers. Chef Petrov made Mr. Pasqualle a cafe diablo.
Excuse me. We're in the middle of a rush here. Customers don't forgive a cold meal or a late meal.
What?
We'll never get our customers back. How am I going to get a body out of here?

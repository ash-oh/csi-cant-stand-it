Francis, what is going on?

Okay, fine.
Put your belt on. Come on, can you pull it?
Get out of the way.

Mona and Francis helped me clean up. They gave me money to be a surrogate mom for Tippi and got me my RN degree. They're family.
Actually, it's two moms and a dad.
Her procedure was completely successful.
I had nothing to do with that. I was at Tippi's soccer game with Mona.

Sodium demonstration is always a real crowd pleaser.
It's ended up in a senior prank more than once. I keep it over here, under lock and key, but, unfortunately, the lab's always getting broken into. 
It's certainly possible Marlon got the sodium from here.
Everyone have their goggles on?
Which is precisely what I told the cops four months ago.
Of course. It burns skin. We keep it in kerosene to stabilize it.
Hannah would never do that.
Ms. Sidle ... I've had my share of good students over the years, but Hannah ... sometimes, right in the middle of a lecture, I'll catch her staring at some little thing in the yard -- a tree, a squirrel ... and all I can think about is how much I wish I could see it the way she does. If Hannah came up and asked me for a chunk of sodium, I'd give it to her, just to see what she would do with it.

Some girls want to be Homecoming Queen. Some girls want to be Miss America. I have always wanted to be a Showgirl.
I mean, I've been taking dancing lessons since I was five. I would, um ... I would pull my leotards really high up on my hips,
... and stick feathers in my hair, put on my mom's high heels, and then I would put on this show.
The first day I got here, I went straight to the Tropicana ...
I walked right past all the slots and the tables, to the tiffany theater. ... 
I couldn't get the smile off of my face. 
I didn't even see when the security guard came up to me, and he told me that I had to leave. You know, 'all rehearsals are closed.' 
So I got up, and then he turns to me ... and he says, um ... 'go ahead and stay.'

The first day that I got here I went straight to the Tropicana. I walked right past all the slots and the tables, to the tiffany theater. I snuck in, and I just sat there in the back row, just watching.
So I got up. And then he turns to me, and he says, um ... 'go ahead and stay.'
You got what you needed. Now, get what you want. Come on.
You know I think I got to go. 
Howard, it's getting late. I got to go. I have a meeting back in town.
No more pictures. HOWARD DELHOMME: No more pictures.
I think that is why I would be perfect for your show. Well, at least, that's what my dad thinks. He always says, 'Julie, people can't help but love you.' 
And it's true.

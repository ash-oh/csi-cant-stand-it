Hey, baby.
Nothin' much.
I'm at the Venetian. Canyon Ranch, getting a ... manicure. 
Hope you're in for a good back scratching session tonight.
What?
Warrick ...
You think you know what you're talking about? 
You want to know what's up, huh? What's really up? 
You can't see a damn thing. He's a VIP host helping me plan your birthday party. I hope you enjoy spending it alone.
Michael Myers. Never seen the guy before. Sure was the life of the party, though.
Kenny -- a regular. He'd come in for Karaoke Nght. Drink a little, go home. You'd never notice him, except for the wheelchair.
Sometimes. You think it could've been a hate crime?
Me neither.
The good stuff -- Well's Head Lager.
I'm lucky if I move a case a year.
Mm-hmm.
Tape's in the machine.

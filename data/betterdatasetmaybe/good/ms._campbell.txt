Ms. Willows. I heard you're investigating the murder at Western LVU. Female, young, bound dumped in a trash bag.
Ms. Willows, my client's life is on the line here. We've always maintained John Mathers' innocence.
Fifteen years ago. Before DNA. Before the real killer struck again. You are going to test the pubic hair sent to the federal lab against the new suspect ...
You CSIs are biased for the prosecution. You decide ahead of time how you want the evidence to come out.
How about guilt or innocence? John was 15 seconds from execution. Sure you're not biased? I hear the same evidence speaking. You know what it's telling me? The killer's still out there.

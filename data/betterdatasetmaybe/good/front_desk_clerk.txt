Welcome back, Mrs. Krell.
Your room's ready and I have your credit card on file. 
Call me if you need anything, Martha.
Ms. Krell was a real nice lady. She brought me a Dodger baseball cap.
Not really. Airlines buy a chunk of rooms for their trolley dollies, discounted. She's just staying here for a few months.
Her supervisor called to say her A.M. flight was canceled. She wasn't answering her phone. He asked me to make sure she got the message.
Yeah. I got a master key.
Nope.
Right on.

I was fishing in Tahoe.
No. Nothing was biting.
No.
Friday to Sunday. Look, I thought I was just here to pick up my hammer.
No way. That hammer -- it's perfectly balanced.
Well a construction site. People get hurt.
Is that the dead kid from the house?
I never got a look at him. I-I I didn't go inside.
That's my kid sister, Ashley. Why? What's she got to do with it?

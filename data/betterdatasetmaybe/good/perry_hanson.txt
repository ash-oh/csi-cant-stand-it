Your mom can do whatever she wants. I paid for this. It's mine.
Which boys?
My kid, Lucas? What, did he ditch school or something?
Lucas must've left it there. I don't know, man, kids are always taking each other's crap.
You know my ex is crazy, right? Always been a drama queen. She probably told you that I stole the TV.
Day I left -- I've never been back.
Look ... my ex will hardly even let me see my kid. You know, not until I pay up on the vaginamony that I owe. And that's illegal. She doesn't care. Yesterday, I-I just wanted to see my boy. You know? So I went over there and he wasn't home. I guess I forgot to leave the key.
You better find my kid. And if I were you, I'd start with Dawn's boyfriends.
She only dates scumbags and bottom-feeders. At least I never been in prison.

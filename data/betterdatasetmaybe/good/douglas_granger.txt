I don't understand why you're asking me this. I'm her brother, not her husband.
That's right.
If she carried it in her purse instead of leaving it in the car, she might still be alive.
I gave her the gun last week.
Are you insane? It's no mystery who killed her. 
Jeff Simon, her ex-boyfriend. Guy was stalking her. 
She changed her phone number, changed jobs, moved a half dozen times. No matter where she went, there he was. Last week, I was over at her new apartment. Jerk sitting in his truck, in front of the building.
Taught her how to shoot it. Helped her get a restraining order. Got zero help from you guys. 'Catch him in the act.' That's all we heard.
Yeah. We used to be friends.

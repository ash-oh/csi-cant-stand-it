Sorry about him.
Why do the jerks get all the tail?
I'm, uh, Mikey. Best man. Brother of the bride.
Yeah, it's, you know.
Hey, this is a pretty crazy-ass situation, huh?  They say it's good luck if it rains on your wedding day. What do you think about a dead body?
I think my sister's better off. You ever think about getting married?
I'm just saying, you know, I think Bryce could make an honest woman out of you.
Oh, look at that -- your rejection broke his little heart.
Hey, hey, good comedy, Diane ... 
You know, I know I may just be a grease monkey, but I drive a tow truck, and I think I know a little something about getting hitched.
Making friends over here. No, but seriously, uh ... I don't mean to get all sentimental or anything, but these two are going to have a lot of s*x tonight.
And ... what? What? Are you embarrassed? She's embarrassed.
I'm her older brother. I changed her diapers.
I know I may just be a grease monkey, but I drive a tow truck, ... 
... and I think I know a little something about getting hitched.
Where's that Sara chick?
Okay, I will cop to everything but the murder.
Look, the lady was already dead, all right? And then, then you guys show up and this bridesmaid comes up to me and starts asking me all these questions about my tow truck.
The hot one. Next thing I know, she wants to be the Bonnie to my Clyde. Asked me to steal this car and trash all the evidence.
Ever stolen a two-ton piece of machinery? It is way better than s*x. And finding a girl that doesn't want to kick you to the curb for it? I mean, come on. That is just hot. Besides, I hadn't gotten a wedding gift for my sister yet. 
... A little something about getting hitched.

You didn't run over a mob, you ran over one boy! My boy!
You need to look in the fridge.
Oh, hell, no. I got company!
A warrant? A warrant for what?!
Oh, we're not talking to nobody. This is harassment!
Somebody get me a phone!
That's the one I want to talk to.
That's the one I'm looking for.
Taking one of my boys wasn't good enough for you, was it? Now you've got to take both? What did we ever do to you?
Then what is it? Is it about the money? Then take it! I just want my boy back!
I'm not talking to you!
Protecting the nice white boy from the mean black lady.
Yeah, like you don't know.
Aaron is all I have left.
Please let me see Demetrius. I just want to talk to him.
He's not dead, is he?
My brother wasn't a killer!
Demetrius was going to college.
He had a 3.6 GPA.
DJ had a future!
I knew him! We knew him!
You didn't run over a mob, you ran over one boy! My boy!
My sons didn't grow up with a father. Barely had a mother on account of me working all the time. They got into trouble. Mostly 'cause of where we live. Aaron here, he got into a whole lot of trouble. 
My son is not a killer. He was trying to stop that killing.
C'mon. Sit down. C'mon.
No, it's not over. We won't get justice till Demetrius --

So, which one of my kids is in trouble?
Oh? Which one of my kids lodged a complaint?
Well, it goes with the territory.
Well, he hasn't lived here in six months.
CPS investigated. They cleared me.
Well, records are wrong.
I do.
Oh, save it. Those mind games don't work on me. I deal with the police often enough to know better than to talk to you without my attorney or to let you poke around my things. 
Mm-hmm.
The checks come, I send them back. I've got the copies to prove it.
Then let's go, because you don't set foot in my house without a warrant.

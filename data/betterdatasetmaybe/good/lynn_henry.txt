You know my name. What's yours?
Crime lab? About what?
Oh, my god. Yes, I-I do know him. Sort of.
Uh, we, we gave Meg a bachelorette party last night. 
So we rented a room in a sort of out-of-the-way place.
Yeah. Uh ... he arrived around ... 10:00?
We left at 3:00. He was totally fine.
No. He asked if he could stay and the room was already paid for, so I didn't see a problem.
Oh, my god! I-I don't know. I-I was totally tipsy last night. I mean, falling all over everything.
Joyce ... shut up.
Okay. After the bachelorette party, we left.
I forgot my purse, so I went back in to get it.
Let go.
No! Get off! Oh, no.
I told him no, but he just wouldn't take no for an answer.
That's how I got the bruises on my wrists. I didn't even tell them until we got back to the hotel.
Very... unfortunately.
An exam for what?
Oh, my god.
I don't know where she is.
Let go of me.

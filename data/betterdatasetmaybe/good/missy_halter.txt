Yeah. So?
I lent it to Michael; his Beemer's in the shop. I want it back.
Why is that any of your business? I'm his girlfriend, okay?
Not my problem. They're separated, getting divorced. Michael lives with me. I want to talk to Michael now.
No. I've never been inside that psuedo Cape Cod dump.
I know her taste.
That's why I'm here? Because you think I stole some albums? What did Michael tell you?
Look, he said Lori was planning on selling his vinyls. So, last week, when she was out and he was at work, he gave me the keys, the alarm code and a list of albums he couldn't live without.
Michael's owned those records since high school. He has the white album, autographed by Paul McCartney. 
... he needed an alibi in case Lori pressed charges. Look, I am trying to be helpful here, but I'm not saying another word until you let me talk to Michael.

You expect me to invade Mr. Acheson's privacy based upon a five-year-old fingerprint that was manipulated on a computer? 
Try getting that one past a defense attorney. It's one thing to send a print through AFIS; it's another thing to use ... a 'background subtraction algorithm' to isolate the print from a bedspread.
Gil. I'm sympathetic to your request, but if I grant a warrant based upon this print, and the print is later thrown out of court, then everything you find as a result of it would be excluded, and your pattern rapist could be back on the street. Give me something else -- I'll be happy to grant you a warrant.
You'll find another way.
Answer the question, then we'll break.
All right, we'll take a ten-minute recess.
Is that true, counselor?
You may not. You blindsided the court. You knew that the ADA would want to see that tape and you deliberately withheld it.
Fine. The defense is to hand over the tape and all associated evidence.  The jury is dismissed until 1:00 P.M. tomorrow.
Your witness.
Dr. Thayer, you're dismissed. Dr. Grissom, please approach the stand to be sworn in.
You may be seated.
Overruled.
Counselor, your witness.
Oh, in that case, we are adjourned until 9:00 A.M. tomorrow morning.

I can't Doodles is dead. When did it happen?
It's my own little tradition. Birthdays, special occasions, I always hire a clown. The kids love them. 
Doodles stuck around to help me clean up, and then he asked me to call him a cab.
Well, he'd been such a good sport that I offered to give him a ride home. I dropped him off at his place at around 8:30.
I already told you. I like clowns.
When Al wore the suit ... it worked ... and it was good. If you found something that got you off ... wouldn't you keep it?

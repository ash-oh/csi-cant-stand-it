My C.O. calls and tells me that Patty Fielding's been murdered, and you're about to broadcast a citywide for my twenty. What the hell's going on in this town?
Didn't know I needed one.
Manny's room? Where's Manny?
Once a year for seven years running. Desert relay is our time together. Then we go back to our lives.
I don't know.
Who told you that? Manny doesn't mess around.
Yes.
Pedestal's a little high, don't you think?
I don't know what happened. I do know that Manny loves his wife just like I love my husband. It's just an itch we scratched every twelve months. It doesn't mean anything.
Archie.
Mm-hmm.
No. He wasn't even supposed to be in Vegas. This is my time. And I heard he was looking for me. He must've got a key from the front desk. Probably took one look at the room and went ballistic. Did you see what he did to my teddy? That was Archie's gift to me.
I look good in it. Archie didn't do this. He couldn't.

Aah ...
Honey, I cannot find my navy suit.
Oh, I have an early meeting, sweetie.
Oh ... all right.
Aw ... Daddy no leave.
I must've called her ten times, then after about an hour I got so worried.
No, she was a good wife, great mother. There's no one ...
Okay, buddy. Can you-- hey, you know what? Come over here. Can you come over here and draw your butterfly for daddy?
Jill who?
Amanda didn't have a sister.
My wife was an only child. Sh-she was adopted, but ... 
Well, I'd like to think no ... that we told each other everything. But that's not ...
A marriage. Married, Detective?
Something weird happens between two people who know each other for years, see each other every day. Every night I drive home from the hospital and I think of twelve things I want to tell Amanda. And then I get home and, uh ... she's cooking. And we read stories to Henry and then ... the phone rings, so I -- you know, you say, 'Oh, I'll just tell her tomorrow. Tomorrow.' I'd like to meet her. Jill.
What happened?
Okay.
Doctors have a name for what Natal is.
A woman who trolls hospitals looking to land themselves a doctor. Call them bedpans: shiny, full of crap, and ... best when dumped.
This is ridiculous. I've been nothing but cooperative. You harass me at my place of work. You harass me at my home. Now you want to take my kid away?
I didn't kill my wife. I was giving my son a bath. I couldn't have done it. Can I at least put my shoes on?

Hey, how's he doing?
Why not?
What happened to him?!
It's mine -- but anybody could have lifted this scarf from my dressing room.
You trying to pin this on me, now?
Well, did you find my fingerprints on anything?
Oh I'm not worried. What you see is what you get.
No, no, no, no. Don't stop.
It's just me. What, are you uncomfortable in front of strangers or something?
Oh.  Well, if you keep playing I'll keep talking.
Oh ... well enough.  Who is this?
Lillie Ivers. So I guess we're not strangers anymore.
Maybe you should come by later ... so we can talk some more.
I told you what I make. What do you bring in? Fifty, Sixty a year?
No, that's what the business is all about.
Hmm. I just thought that with your kind of talent you know, I could dial you in. I've got a manager with a pipeline to god.
I've been booked solid for the past two years. Next stop ... blue note, motown ... anything I want. Studio time, recording contracts ... 
I'm a musician, Warrick, and I recognize talent. And the way you look ... you might as well be dipped in gold.
What are you holding back for? You could be out there making a difference.
Yeah, riding around chasing ghosts with that partner of yours. Nobody even knows you exist.
Okay ...
I'll try.
Are you looking for me?
Oh, yeah? About what?  Come on, tell me. We're not strangers anymore, remember?
Warrick Brown.  What?

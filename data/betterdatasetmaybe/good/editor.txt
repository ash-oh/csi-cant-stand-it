Veronica had been here since last summer. Maybe six months.
She was more of a freelancer. The narco corridos piece was her first major story. Makes me sick to think she's not going to finish it.
She figured it was the only way to get these guys to open up to her. She was right.
Narcocorridos glamorize a criminal lifestyle.
Veronica felt the songs were poisoning our young people. She used the intern's desk right there.
I warned her that it was a vicious subculture.
Well, there was this one incident right after part one was published.
We didn't call the cops, but it wasn't settling. I'm kind of superstitious.
Well, you could cut out earlier, maybe go to a wide exterior shot, you could carry the scream over a big flock of birds taking off.
Or ... yeah ...
Or not. Or not, just ... bad idea. All right, okay.
Yeah. Here goes.
I can't believe this is my life.

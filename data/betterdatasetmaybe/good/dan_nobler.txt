Can I help you?
Yeah.
Look, if you're here about my business, you can save it for my attorney.
Bradford is a lying son of a bitch.
I run an online gambling business. Bradford had an account, ran up
That's true. And when Brad was winning, it wasn't a problem. But when his luck changed, he called his credit card holder and said the charges were fraudulent. The credit card company issued a charge back and I got screwed.
Look, I wrote him an e-mail, hoping to scare him. Sorry. I was angry. If I write an apology, can we drop this? 
Any other questions, contact my lawyer. We're done here.
I'm here about pebbles and glass. Come on.
Fine. I was there.
No, look, I get ripped off by jerks all over the world. This guy was a local. I knew his address and, yeah, I wanted to shake him down. Let him know that by declaring credit card fraud, he was stealing from me.
A few days ago, I went over to his house. Then I started thinking, 'What if this guy's like twice my size?' I figured I should get a look at him before I had our 'conversation,' so I went around back ...
At first, I thought he was wearing a costume, but then I realized, it was ... it was real hair. Disgusting, right?
Well, when the dude saw me, I took off.
Uh, he was a freak of nature. I no longer wish to speak with him.

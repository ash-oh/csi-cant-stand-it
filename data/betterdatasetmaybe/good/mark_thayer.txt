Well, as you can see, the life cycle of the black blowfly, from egg to larva to puparium to adult, is like clockwork.
That's correct. 
Within minutes of her death.
CSI found puparia on the body, but no adults. So that means that the victim had been dead for fifteen days.
That's correct.
I documented it myself. In fact, in preparation for this trial, I videotaped a black blowfly breeding on a pig carcass. Now, this videotape will illustrate that the timeline from egg to puparium is, in fact, precisely fifteen days.
As you can see, on day 14 -- plenty of larvae, commonly known as maggots, but no puparia.
Finally on day 15, you'll notice the puparia swimming in the brown liquid.
Based on that evidence, I can reliably conclude that Joanna Whitson was killed on November 1.
Yes.
I want to talk to you.
You impugned my character.
What the hell do you want?
Oh, my God ...
This is all your fault.

Don't shoot. Don't shoot.
We already told you. We had no idea that was in the trunk.
We lost our friends at bar 911.
We had no ride home. We were bored. So, we started shots of tequila ...
... with some guy who looked like ... like Cat Stevens.
Whoo!
Next thing we know, we're in his van playing strip poker.
It was a blast at first. Then, um ... 
Then he said the creepiest thing.
Lori! Lori, over here! Lori!
This guy was weird. Like, way weird. I was thinking that he was going to pull a Silence of the Lambs on me and tell me to 'put lotion in the basket.'
Wait, Lori!
We don't know anyone named Ray. And my boyfriend's name is Stuart.
Okay, this is stupid. You're scaring us.
Come on.
Jerk!
We don't know anyone named Ray, and my boyfriend's name is Stuart.
Jerk!
You bet it did. I was born in Manhattan.
If it helps nail the guy, sure.

What am I supposed to do now? Walk home?
Some junker. Thanks a lot. Some friend you are. Take your damn car.
Thanks for coming.
Here's the car back. You're a good friend.
Here's the car back. And I'm moving.
I can't do this anymore. It's not right. I'm in love with another man. I'm sorry, Cody.
Are you sure?
What are you doing here?
I have to get back to the club.
No.

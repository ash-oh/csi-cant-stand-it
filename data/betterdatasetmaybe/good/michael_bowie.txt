Michael here.
Yeah, I lead Mr. Manducci back to his seat. He and his brothers had had quite a bit to drink.
I could do it with my eyes closed.
No. Everyone seemed to be having a good time. Until the woman in the fuzzy dress shrieked. I found Mr. Huxley slumped forward. Checked for a pulse, and he didn't have one, so I turned on the emergency lights. Then she really screamed. Is she pretty? She had a pretty girl scream.
Force of habit; I'm sorry. Waiter.
Sure. 
It's Michael here. Is ... is everyone all right?
Oh, no problem, sir. I'll leave you two alone.
She seduces me, steals my recipes, my ideas, my investors. And then she hires me as a freaking waiter. Night after night, I listen to her tell stories of the tragic love affair, of the poor, dead blind guy. Last night, I finally confronted her. 
I deserve a piece of the action.
I made you.
I'm blind. She's not. But in that dining room, everybody else is blind, too. And when Huxley walked in with his Kitties, it was like a sign from the gods. I knew I could destroy her and the restaurant.
I waited till the oyster course. The shells clanging, and slurping, the 'oohing,' the 'aahing, I knew it would cover any noise I was going to make.
I wanted her rotting in jail, eating bologna sandwiches.
I tell everyone to put their purses and jackets on the back of the chairs, so I knew exactly where her purse was.
Old cat frames young Kitty. Kind of perfect.

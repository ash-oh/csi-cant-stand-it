This has to be a mistake. I don't even eat meat. Or cheese. I won't even hire an exterminator.
I haven't been to any crime scenes.
Yeah, I work next door to one.
The owner's my friend. Did something happen to her?
No.
Okay, yeah, wait ... I can explain that.
I work at a vegetarian restaurant. We make these soy burgers. Sedona was hooked on them. So, you know, she'd order, I'd deliver.
Look, she's always busy doing a reading or whipping up some kind of potion. She told me to take the money out of the drawer.
Soy burger and fries was $6.95 plus tax. I'd take a ten.
No.
Like most nights, I work until six and then I like ... to go to the Stripperama.
Well, yeah.
Girls aren't allowed to tell you their real names, but I call her Star 'cause she has these ... blue stars tattooed on her hips. And it kind of looks like a meteor shower when she dances.
I can go?
Excuse me?

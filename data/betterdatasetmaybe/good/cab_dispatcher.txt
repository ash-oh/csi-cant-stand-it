You guys from Strip-O-Gram?
'Cause last year, for my birthday, a cop showed up with a phony badge, started tearing his clothes off and trying to rub up on me.  I'm an excellent tipper.
Okay, then. So we dispatched twenty cabs to Diane's Steakhouse last night.
Received a call at 10:01. Dispatched number 29. Chandru Kambhatla. He doesn't come on until 8:00.
Number 29's right there. Keys are inside. 
No joy riding, and don't leave the doors off like you did last time.
That's why nobody likes to deal with your asses!

I don't deserve to die. You think killing me will solve anything?
I've prepared myself, but I'm not ready.
Not if you kill the wrong man.
Forensic evidence changes all the time. One day I'm innocent, the next day I'm not.
What does that prove? The real killer's smart. 
Watches the news, he reads the papers just like you. I'm ... man, I'm the perfect patsy.
Absolutely. I worked campus security. I'm not the smartest or the richest guy, but do I look like I had problems with women? I'm not the killer. Remember that when I'm gone.

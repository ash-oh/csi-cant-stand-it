Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let me get one of those for you. Here you go.
Well, you know, that's just how we do. We never bust.
Are you a cop?
Drops. And let's just say Dollar pays the bills.
They do all the filthy, dirty, grimy promo for Dollar. Snipe posters, give away stickers, pass CDs around. Nothing really.
What can I say, man? These kids run the streets, bro. Anybody at any given time can run up on them and try and lullaby their ass.
Nope.
Nice suit. Glad to see you dressed for the occasion.
Eh, sorry, Crime Lab, Nick Stokes. Nobody here's got a clue.
Yeah, okay. Oh, well, what do you know? There goes one of my birds. Sorry, got to go. Peace.
Yeah, whatever. Look, you need any more posters, just scream at me.
Hey, Tweety! Tweety!
Mr. Yen says, 'Moshi, moshi.'
Konnichiwa.
I'm expanding into Asia.
They're grubbing -- they went down to the cafe hospital. You know, they're kind of Benigni over that Waldorf salad. 
This is very disappointing.
Konnichiwa. Look. I ain't in the mood, man.
Yeah, I got blood on my face, too. How about that?
It's Champ.
It's family, man.
Look, B, I ain't no Blud and I ain't no Crip. Champ's just a cool kid I knew from around the way. I met his ass over two decades ago riding my Big Wheel. We go back like your hairline. That's family.
We was parlayin', chillin', slidin' to the strip club, mindin' our own.
The only bands I'm playin' with now is the one's I'm ripping off stacks of green. And I ain't talking about weed, B.
I promote events, parties. I help the club life pop.
I don't know, okay? Could be everybody, man, could be nobody.
I know a lot of people -- friends and foes. They know I come here late night. Or maybe, maybe the limo driver cut somebody off and we're the victims of road rage. How about that?
You can't be ser ... I'm the one that got shot at! 
Whoa! 'Crime Lab Nick Stokes!' I see we're in between bad haircuts.
Now, come on, Crime Lab, I thought we was old buddies.
Well, first of all ... I ain't never killed nobody in my life. Second, I don't have a record.  Never even done a day in jail.
Yeah, well ... this, this ain't me. I'm not used to this. As a matter of fact, I don't even know what that is.
Oh, yeah, uh ... the powder from a gun. You ain't gonna find none of that.
No, thanks. Uh, I got one of my queens bringing me a suit. I will not be throwing on these nasty ass scrubs.
What underwear? I don't wear drawers.
Look, I didn't lie, all right? I just left a couple of things out.
We shot back; it's that simple.
Nah, man, just one of us.
Nah, my dude. Look, I ain't do no shooting. All right? Somebody jacked that piece off me, like, a year ago.
What can I say, man? .38's back in style. Besides, man, Champ always had heat. Everybody know that. He got my back. 
Wow, and here I was thinking that I got that name based off my boxing skills, seeing as how I used to drop fools in the squared circle.
I tossed it after the shooting, man.
That's because a gun like that in a hood like that, that's rent money, baby.
Whoa, okay, easy now, Kojaks.
Man, forensics be jammin' a brother up.
Look, he was just trying to show a potential investor a good time, that's all. The boy got a short fuse.
Champ thought it was a bad look.
Champ gets a bonus when business is good.
Yeah. So, um ... what's a few scrapes and bruises on this girl got to do with me?
Death? Wait a minute, no way. See, first of all, that limo was turtle stepping' it down the block. It's like fallin' off a bike.
The speakers were on blast. I couldn't even hear my cell phone and that was on vibrate.
Scott ... Who?
Okay, we already went over that. Champ was the shooter.
Trust me, son, you don't want to be here when the cops come, okay? Here, take the ratchet, and make it disappear. 
Take the ratchet! Don't worry about it; I got you covered.
'Textbook self-defense.' Told you, forensics be jammin' a brother up.
And all this time I thought I was paying you too much. Give me some.

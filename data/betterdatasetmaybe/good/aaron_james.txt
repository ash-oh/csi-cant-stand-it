How tough you feel when you're not in your big SUV, huh?
Asked you a question, killer.
All right, ten ball, corner pocket.
Yeah, right.
No, no, no, hold it, hold it. I don't know this girl. Okay, she came up to Drops at the Gold Square.
No, hold up, man. I didn't kill anybody.
Drops grew up in that 'hood. Guess he, uh ... wanted to claim his old territory.
We own that place. Picking up a girl in there was like stealing. 
Drops trying to open up his own club. Asked me to invest. Before I got my money, guy like Drops wouldn't have 'What up?' to me, let alone ask me out to talk business. 
I felt like a big shot. What's the big deal?
Look, I had nothing to do with that. And I definitely didn't kick her out of that limo.
All right. Whatever.
Champ, come on, man. What's wrong with you, man? She's a lady.
Hey!
Man, DJ was going to a costume party.
And I did my time, too. I did my time, but that wasn't D.J. He was helping me turn my life around. Coached me on my GED. Made me feel like there was a chance for me, you know.  Man, you have no idea what you killed when you killed my brother.
No way D.J. was a violent person.
How tough you feel when you're not in your big SUV, huh?
I asked you a question, killer.
Oh, come on, that's just his word, man. His word against my brother's word!
You know, we can't get his side, now can we?

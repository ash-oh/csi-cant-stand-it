Can the casino do anything to hurry this up, Mr. Stokes?
We replace the dice every hour.
There you go! Congratulations.
Hey, Warrick, how you doing?
Listen, we've got your favorite 21 table ready for you over there, okay?
Then what are you doing here?
Yeah, guy won 50 g on that big machine over there.
Uh-huh.
Yep, that's him.
Midnight. That was the end of my shift. Looks like he needed it, too.
Yeah, dirty clothes, serious B.O.
Big time. Don't be a stranger.

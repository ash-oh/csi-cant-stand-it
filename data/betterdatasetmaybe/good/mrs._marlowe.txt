21 years ago, the chief of police sat in our living room told us our daughter was dead.
She's our only child. We never gave up hope. We're not giving up now.
Hi.
Yes, but I don't see how they can help. In some of those, she's just an infant.
I could never forget.
You found Melissa?
When can we see her?
What kind of crime?
This can't be happening.
Melissa? ... Melissa?!
It's mom ...
... baby...
Who is she? Her name? Who is she now?
Oh, my god.
I am her mother.
Melissa ...
You looking at my necklace? Your father bought this for me when you were born and you used to play with it. 
We're not going to let you go to jail. Right? Right, Hank?
Hank, she's not spending another night away from us. Whatever it takes.
What?
Arrest us.
Melissa's free. That's all that matters.

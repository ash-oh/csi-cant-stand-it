Lockdown is in effect. All guards remain at your posts.
You're going to like my room. You can see the entire strip from my balcony ... and the bed.
Yeah? Well, I could tell that just by looking at you.
Come on, don't worry, all right? You can trust me. Okay?
I never lie.
Yeah, I am.
I'm telling you, the seven comes up every six rolls. I've got a system.
You know what the casinos say about guys with systems?
What?
Welcome.
Jane, you there? Pick up. Okay ... I'll call back later.
Slut. You can't hide from me, bitch. Jane, you there?
Now, didn't I tell you ... not to bite your nails?!
Hey, G, what's up?
Hey, Brown, you going to find the guy who did this?
You're right. I deserve to be punished.
I'm sorry.
No one will question you. They'll say it's just another suicide.
I said he'd be alone.
Do you do your own stunts?
I've always wanted to try that. Would you mind making it out to my girlfriend please ...
That shot was great.
Grissom, do you have a second?
I don't know what I can tell you. I've only been here since '95.
A couple of the guys predate me. I'll ask around.
We artists covet our brushes.  That's Russian Blue Squirrel ... Japanese Synthetic ... Badger.
Anyone who's studied art would never use nylon with oils unless they were using the paint for something else. When brushes age ...
... they shed hairs. Then, if they used a nylon brush the next time ...
Student union sells them. Most art stores. You can get them cheaper on the internet.
Put your hands up! Put your hands up!
Let's go!
I saw you with him. I know you're lying.
Nobody cheats on me.
I hate you. How could you do this to me?
Come on!
Move it!
Single file, stop at your number on the floor. When I tell you to turn, you're gonna face the mirror. When you hear your number called, step forward.
Number one, step forward.
Step back.
Number two, step forward.
Step back.
Number three, step forward.
Number one, please step forward. 
Turn to the left. Step back. 
Number two, step forward. Turn to your left.
Number four, step forward.
Turn to your left.
Ma'am, you all right?
Where are your keys?
Get back! Get back!
Bet a wolf got him.
What the -- ?
Rodney King, yo! Rodney King. Yo! Y'all see this? That's Rodney King, Dawg! Let me go, Dawg! Let me go, man!
Get off me, man! That's Rodney King, Dawg! Let me ... Get off! Get off me! Get off! Get off me! Bitches! We call it brutality!
Nombre de jesus malverde ... nombre de jesus malverde ...
Silencio!
Thanks Ginny. In this exclusive community ...
Hi. Can I leave this message for Melody?
Fire in the hole!
Okay.
Hey, baby, let's go.
Hey, baby, let's go.
Stay away from Bianca.
You want to come with us?
Come on in.
Who's the bitch now?
Yeah, eighty feet underground, no A/C. Thought I was going to suffocate.
Yeah. Uh, listen, preliminary sketch here ... 
I remember him. Matt Dickens. We used to call him Hollywood.
See! Another one got killed! Where's ... 
You work for the cops. That makes you a cop. You're not on our side.
This is my house!
There's no way you'll get a jury to believe this evidence wasn't fabricated.
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Hold the elevator.
Eleven.
We are victims ... and no one is listening to us. We're powerless against what's going on.
We're not crazy. If you look at who has had contact, we're airline pilots, professionals, teachers, scientists. I don't know how to get the truth out, but we have to.
They've got her.
Don't make eye contact with them.
Don't.
Now say it.
I said ... say it.
You have to say it. Say it.
Excuse me.
Mr. Sanders, you've been served.
Get up. Get out. Get out! Hyah!
Grissom, this guy just flew in from L.A. On the studio jet.
Go! Go! Go! Go!

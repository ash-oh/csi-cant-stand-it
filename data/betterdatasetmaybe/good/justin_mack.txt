How you doing?
Why?
You see, Raina said it was important for Tessa to take the bus to school. Said it helps build independence. But sometimes I'd pick her up at the bus stop, buy her an ice-cream cone, and drop her off here.
Look, I know there are a lot of whack-jobs in the world, and you're just doing your job, but watch it.
Don't you need a warrant?
Go ahead.

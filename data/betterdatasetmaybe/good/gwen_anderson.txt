No!
Please help us.
Do my boys have to be here? I think this is hard enough for them without having to hear the facts.
Um ... I got up at 4:30, like I usually do to feed Zack. I'm still breast-feeding. And I went down to Zacky's room. I looked in his crib and he was gone. He wasn't there. 
And I felt around for him and that's when I found the letter saying that he had been taken and I ... I don't know. I-I think I screamed ... 
No, I know what he wears.
Steve likes it. I never cared for the game.
That one's my favorite but Zacky, he, uh ... he liked another one. Here it is.
There's a little spit-up on it. He liked the way the fabric felt on his skin. 
Oh, god.
I can't believe this is happening to us.
My baby! Oh, my god!
It's my baby! My baby! My baby!
Well, do you have any leads? Any idea who did this?
I had, uh ... I had made dinner and then Steve and I walked up to the clubhouse. We were gone maybe 30 minutes, until 9:00.
He's, uh ... he's upset. He is not usually like this.
What have you done?
Robbie, what did you do?
All right, I heard you.
I never meant to hurt Tyler. You have to understand.
He was choking.
He had gotten food in his windpipe. His face was ... turning red. Steve was at work. So, I, I patted him on his back and-and on ... and on his stomach and finally, I turned him upside down and I started shaking him to get the food out ... to ... to dislodge it, and I did. But I realized that I had hurt him, so I called 911.
It was a french fry. He'd grabbed it from my plate.
Excuse me?
Hey. Can we just go, please? TYLER ANDERSON: What's going on?
What are we going to do?!
Oh, god, what are we going to do?!
Stop. Ty didn't do this.
And I can't go on.
I killed him. I came home. Tyler h-h-hadn't put Zachary to bed because he ... he was crying, and I wanted to hush him up and, and I just ... I went too far.
I smothered him with a pot holder. And that's when Steve and I came up with the kidnap story.
So that it wouldn't look suspicious. And you may not believe me, but I loved him. I loved him very, very much.
Oh, my god. What happened?
I always, uh ... I always tell them, 'gentle, gentle.'
He didn't mean it. I know he didn't mean it.
You must think that we are awful people -- all this stuff that's come out.

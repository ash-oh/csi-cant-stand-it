About what?
No. Apparently, you think I do. 
And he was alive when he left me. 
Yeah. Believe it or not. Look. He was getting kind of weird on me.
Hey. Where you going?
So I put on my clothes and I got out of there. I was looking for fun, not a lifetime commitment.
I didn't take his money.
I'm a professional gambler. Probably the only one in Vegas who declares every dollar. You can check my tax returns.
We had s*x. Is that against the law? No.
We won some money shooting pool. Is that against the law? No.
Let's get this straight. He was a sweet kid and I'm sorry he's dead, but I had nothing to do with it. And I'm done talking.
No, I'm not.
It's my damn boyfriend.

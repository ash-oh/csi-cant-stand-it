It's a beach house, a ski lodge, a state-of-the-art office, your home on the road ... ladies and gentlemen, Daluca Motorcoaches is proud to present the g-4700!
Oh! Okay. Who gets the first ride?
If I wanted someone your age, I'd do my wife.
You want my prints? My DNA? I mean, come on, guys. I'm on vacation here.
My DNA is gonna be all over that girl, but I didn't put it there, she did. Now, this broad was expiring like spoiled milk, and she was looking for a way out.
You still here?
You bitch. You bitch!
She puts my baby inside her, hey, quickie retirement plan.
If I'd have killed her, you think I'd put her in my own motorcoach, and then present it at an unveiling ceremony that I was announcing?
You don't believe me, go ask the convention authorities. I told them what she was trying to do. It's the last time I ever hire those skanks to work a show.

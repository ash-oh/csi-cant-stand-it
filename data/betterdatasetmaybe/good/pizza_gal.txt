I didn't see this boy at the pizza place, but I remember the little guy.  He had a fat lip. I asked him where he got it.
He said his grandfather was a bully. I started to walk out with him and I was worried. But he swore he was safe. With friends.
Some white guy. It was pretty dark.
Not that I saw. But they ordered an extra-large with everything -- and that's 18 slices-and a full liter of cherry soda. If it matters, they sat in the parking lot for a while.
It was a Mercury Marquis.
Yeah. My boyfriend's a street ... uh, he's into cars, so ... I know cars.

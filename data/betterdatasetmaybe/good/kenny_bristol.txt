Look, I don't know why you had to drag me down here on my day off.
I don't know.
A digital video time-delay. 
Janelle asked me to do her a favor. I really like her. You know, I practically watched her grow up, I mean, through the ... cameras.
I'm so fired. I screwed with Charlie Macklin. I'm probably dead. 
I don't know. She said she wanted to sneak some guys up to her suite that Mr. Macklin wouldn't like. What was I supposed to do? I mean, she's the boss' daughter.
I'm telling you, I don't know where she is.

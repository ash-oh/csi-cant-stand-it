This is my wife, Geraldo's mother. We want nothing but the best for our son. That means we will decide if you go in and get the bullet, not the police.
You got that?
My son should be in school today. He should be playing football.
Instead, he's lying in a hospital bed. Why? Because the cops decided to shoot first and ask questions later.
Anybody remember the last time the police had a running gun battle down the strip? No? That's 'cause it's never happened. 
Summerlin? Never. Seven Hills? No way. But down here, hey ...
My son, Geraldo, was a good boy. He was a great football player. Fearless out there. He had a chance to do something with his life. 
To be better than his father. And now ...
I may outlive my son. Because the police shot him before he could tell them who he was.
Before he could tell them he was an honor student. I want to invite everybody here ... 
... who cares about what happens in the community to come to Queen of Angels tonight, 6:00 P.M., ... 
... to pray for Geraldo's life. 
And I want to say out loud, right now, to Sheriff Burdick, this will not stand. 
You, sir, will be held to answer. I mean it. I'm not going away.
My son was riding his bike to school.
Today he's in a coma. But ... 
... when he wakes up, when he ... opens his eyes again and smiles at his mother, he will see all the ... flowers and cards that he's been sent from total strangers wishing him well and ... praying for his recovery. Sheriff Burdick h-hasn't called. I've left so many messages I've lost count. It's inconvenient, I know, but I have questions. Who did this to my son? Why did they do it? No one wants to answer me? If the cops didn't shoot him, why won't they talk to me? If I have to go to court to find out, if I have to sue each and every officer involved, I'll do it. I will put the sheriff in front of a jury and get my answers there.
What about my son? What-what does the evidence say about my son?
Please.
Why would he do that?

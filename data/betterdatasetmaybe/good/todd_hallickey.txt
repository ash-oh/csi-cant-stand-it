Look, I don't know why you guys brought me here, but you got no right tossing my apartment.
I don't boost cars no more.
Oh, wait. No, I ... I was looking into getting some wheels a couple of weeks ago. I test-drove this old Honda Accord this guy was trying to unload.
Yeah, that was it. Must be how my print got there. Well, didn't buy the car. Guy seemed kind of shady.
Come on. No one keeps track of stuff like that.
No, sir, I'm on parole. Besides, I don't believe in guns. They're dangerous.
It's a rash.
Never heard of it.
Look, you want to pin that car on me, you go ahead and try.

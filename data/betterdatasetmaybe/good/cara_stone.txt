We were getting gas, and, uh, some lunatic came up ...
... just stabbed my husband in the chest. My baby saw Jack get stabbed.
No. And Jack offered him his wallet. The guy just muttered something, just ... just stabbed Jack. And left the wallet. Why ... why did he do this? My ... my husband just met his daughter.
He just got back from his second tour in Iraq.
That's him. Well ... is he dead? Who is he? Why did he kill my husband?
It-it was ... it was just random? That's the reason I don't have a husband? That's why?

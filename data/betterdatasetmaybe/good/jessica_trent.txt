Oh, the lady over there the one that died, she was nice. She had cats. Lots of them. 
Jessica Rachel Trent. I'm eight and a half.
Yeah. My teacher's Mrs. Armstrong. She's really nice. Except I hate multiplication especially the eight's.
When Mrs. Stein came out she looked really angry. K-Kind of like when mommy's boyfriend is late for dinner. She hates that.
All right.
No problem.
Wait. 
Rascal. Hi. How'd you get out?
Say Hi, Rascal.
No. He doesn't like you.
Just ignore her.
No.
I think it's time to go inside.
I want her to do it.
Come on, Jackie, let's go.
No. You promised.
She didn't mean to do it. I'm sure she didn't.
Mommy.
Mrs. Elliot should have just given us the cat.
So then we ran, and that's when we heard the old lady scream.
Tattletales burn in hell.
The old lady should have just given me the cat. I lied before. She wasn't nice. She was mean.
My mom said we can keep him. Please?
But you have so many. We don't have even one.
Run, Jackie!
You won't!
No, I need mommy.  Mommy. I want my mommy! No!
Please ... mommy ...
Mommy ...

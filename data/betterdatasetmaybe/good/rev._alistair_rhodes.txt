You may believe that you have to die before the judgment comes.
But I say the fire is not around the corner.
The fire is not a-waitin'.
The fire is not a-wantin'. The fire has already come.
As we mortals drink, gamble and fornicate our way through this world, --
-- death to Hell's bells thundering toll. The clock of damnations already struck midnight.
We gonna die. Stick a fork in the ass of the human race and turn us over on Satan's spit because we all are not going to Hell,
Surely as we stand in Las Vegas, Nevada.
I say we are in Hell. Now.
You think those are your fingers itching to pick up the spike? Your hands injecting your veins? 'Satan finds mischief still in idle hands.'

I knew I shouldn't have left Jerry with my boyfriend. I'd been calling to check in. He wasn't answering. I could tell something was up.
There was no one else. I had to get this surgery today or my insurance wasn't going to cover it.
We have no family. Our parents died in a car crash years ago.
I'm a waitress, Miss. I ... I don't make much. There's a really nice institution in Summerlin, but it costs a $100,000 a year. And the last babysitter I hired, Jerry beat up trying to get to the fridge. I swear to you, I really tried to take care of my brother. I really ... did the best I could.
Jerry took third place?
I bet he had the time of his life.

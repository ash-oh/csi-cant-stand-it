Since her husband died, kid's toys always laying around. I'm always tossing balls over my fence back into her yard. They keep to themselves, which is fine by me.
I work all day and I don't spend my nights looking at the neighbors, okay?
Oh, she's my sweetie. 
Who's my good girl? Queenie's my good girl. Yes, you are. Yes, you are.  Interesting how things work out.
Her kid getting killed. This is Queenie. My last dog, Princess ... Princess died, and she did it.
Four years ago. I found Princess hanging off the back fence. Supposed to look like it was an accident, like she got caught on collar and choked.
No, but I knew. See, Princess used to bark through the fence at her kid. She just wanted to play.  If you ask me, you know what? The kid liked it, but Karen she just went off the deep end.

Brad Kendall. I heard it on the news. They're saying it was some kind of a hit. Where are Erin and Alice?
Did you call their parents?
Erin locked up twice a week -- 10:00 on the nose. She was training Alice - moving on at the end of the month. I can't believe they're gone.
Sure.
Yeah. At the Orpheus. I was a waiter in the coffee shop. He came in all the time.
Once in a while. He owned the place. He was everywhere.
I made cash deposits. I carry a concealed weapon.
Glock, nine millimeter.
Yeah, of course, I'll bring it in.
Me? The father? No way. I'm married. I don't fool around.
You got it all wrong.
I don't believe this. Talk to anyone. I'm not like that.
It was a one-time thing. I didn't even know she was pregnant.
What am I looking at?
We got to talk.
Listen to me!
I didn't mean for it to happen like that. I just wanted to talk.

I'm on a short line, all right? You're on your own, Ben.
You know I can't. What am I going to do? Huh? It's your mess. You got to deal with it.
I don't know. Tempers, I guess.

Neither. I told you, Ben strangled that guy.
I don't know what you're talking about.
If this guy was pure as the driven snow, what's he doing out in the middle of nowhere with drugs in his car? Give me a break. He was dirty, just like the rest of them.

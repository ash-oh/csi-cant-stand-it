You found my car?
Yeah, isn't that why you guys are here? I filed a police report a couple days ago. God, I love that car. Hocked my future on it. Tell me it hadn't been stripped.
I'm a lawyer.
Here you go.
Yeah, I stopped for take-out after work. When I came out, it was gone.
What's with all the questions?
You think the b*st*rd that stole my car hit someone?
Yeah. Great town. I studied my ass off in law school. Passed the bar first time.
Everyone deserves representation.
A blue pinstripe, a light blue oxford, gray tie -- a gift from my girlfriend. First week as an associate -- firm like this you tend to pay attention to wardrobe.
Really? Well, you need a warrant. 
But I'm a nice guy. I picked them up at lunch. Downstairs -- one-hour dry cleaning.
Thank you. I just bought it.
Oh, come on. I've been meaning to change dry cleaners.
Excuse me?
I have my limits. You want me to strip, you're going to need a warrant. But since there's no basis for your request you can forget about it.
All right, you got me. I ran into the Chinese restaurant. I wasn't in there more than two minutes but I left my keys in the car.
Yeah. 
Stupid, right? That's why I didn't say anything. Besides, if my insurance finds out it's contributory negligence. 
I told you everything. Chinese restaurant near my house. I couldn't find a parking spot. Parked in the handicapped zone, left the motor running. I wasn't in there more than a minute.
You're going to need a warrant, like I said. But you don't have basis.
I can call Judge Scott, contest your grounds.
Yeah, all right. 
Here you go. Look, no chemical burns. You satisfied?
Yeah.
All right, hold on. It's not what you think. 
I called in my order. I looked down to put away my phone.
I hit something. I stopped. I looked around. I couldn't see anything. 
I figured it must have been a dog and it ran off. So I drove to the restaurant and that's when my car was stolen. It was a rough night. 
Look, my car was stolen. What happened next, I don't know.
All right.
Yeah.
Look, I'm filing a complaint with your supervisor. You're harassing me.
Oh, come on. Your entire case is circumstantial. Your physical evidence is pathetic. You've got, what, a wrecked car -- a white powder in a rental -- and a bleached-out stain in my garage. If that's all you've got you won't even get a filing.
My cell phone.
I hope he didn't make any long-distance calls. Thanks.
Yeah.
Hey, now it's a party.
I sacrificed to get where I am. My whole life was leading up to last Monday.

So, did I, like, break the law by not reporting it?
Yeah, look, my wife -- she's not real comfortable about having the gun in the house ever since we had our boy and I told her that I'd gotten rid of it but I never did. I mean, man, the last thing I ever expected was it'd be used in a murder.
Hey, thanks. Right on.  Oh, hey, bring up car 309!

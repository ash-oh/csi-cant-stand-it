I watched the life go out of their eyes. Um, life drains. That's ... that's how you can tell they're dead. They have, uh, empty eyes.
I saw this girl I liked at the bar.
I followed her home. I knew she wanted to party. I chose her. Girls act ... sometimes like they don't want what they want ... because they want you to take it. They like that. But this girl ... she was flirting with me. 
And I ... I just gave her the party of her life.
I don't feel anything. Nothing.

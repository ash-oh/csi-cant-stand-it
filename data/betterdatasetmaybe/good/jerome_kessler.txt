Is this official police business?
Did Heather send you?
Did she tell you about me?
We were married very young. Didn't last long. Heather left without telling me she was pregnant. I wasn't aware I had a child until after Zoe was already dead.
Her name is Alison. So why are you here?
Wouldn't you?
Yes, the day before yesterday I got a call from the bank. Heather had set up a very generous trust fund for her, no strings attached. I assumed she sold her house.
$843,508. I know Heather had closed her business a few months ago, trying to convince the judge she'd be a fit guardian, so it had to be from the sale.

Tanya, get your sweet little ass back over to the piano, and we'll talk about it later.
Let me guess. You want to talk to me about Bruce. I hear they're using all the backhoes in hell to dig him a new pit.
Well, you know, I thought that b*st*rd would outlive us all.
At his birthday party.
She's going to be a big star.
Bruce didn't have any friends, so he had to invite his enemies, a real 'Who's Who' of Las Vegas. See, Bruce was a shark who circled around for information. And when he found your weakness, he filed it away to be used later.
Oh ... so now you found my weakness.
I was banging his wife.
It was a gift.
Tanya Rollins. You got to woo the talent.
Twenty-four.
What do you want?
They were involved.
Tanya always goes where the best deal is. I 'rolled' her, Bruce bankrolled her. Her career-- smart move. Turned out she actually had other talents. She was making him a ton of money, so I gave her a call.
Ah, come on, look, she jumped at it, all right? Tanya said he was a freak and she wanted out.
Come on, we both know what I was after.
I didn't want him dead. There's no sport in humiliating a dead man. Now, if you' excuse me, captain.

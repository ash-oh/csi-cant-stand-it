Yeah. I'm sorry I'm late. I got lost. 
Oh, this is messed up. This is really messed up. 
Whoa! She just moved. Did you see that? 
I'm telling you, she just moved.
That's not her. This lady's too thin. That's not her skin, either. My aunt always wore sunblock.
Huh?
I got to go.
At the YMCA off industrial, near the underpass.
I don't have a job. I used to.
She dropped those charges.
I don't call her much. We only have dinner on holidays. Whenever she sees me, it makes her kind of sad.
When?
No, I go for burgers. Sonic.
I'll do whatever you guys want.
Hello, Doris.
No. Not too much.
What's up, dude?
Okey-doke.
Okay. So I shot Happy. I hated that guy. But it was self-defense.
I myself was trying to defend the girls. They needed me to protect them. They depended me on that. So that's what I done. 
He was all puffed up ...
-- like some big-ass ... lizard monster guy.
Yeah, but he wouldn't die. And I'm glad he did. And anyway, I wasn't the one that killed him.  He just ... kept coming at me. He wouldn't lie down.
It was horrible.
Uh-huh.
But I didn't kill him! And I'd do it again if I had a chance! 
I killed him?
I killed him? I killed him!
Are you gonna get that?
Dreama said she did it? By herself?
No.
That ain't the way it went down. Dreama thought it up, but I'm the one who stuck it in.
Two holes. What? 
Oh.

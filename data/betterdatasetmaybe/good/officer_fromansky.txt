Actually, it's what you need to get, rook.
You're off when I say you're off. 
Don't forget the Ho-Hos.
I was in my radio car when I heard shots fired. I called for backup. I went in.
Clay, talk to me. Clay!
Three. No, four. I fired four.
I saw my partner on the floor. I went towards him.
Second gunman came at me.
Maybe-maybe five. I'd taken a shot in my vest. 
No, I'm not sure. That's why I said maybe ... ...but I know I shot four at the third guy. I was going to check on my partner. I caught movement in the back. Black coat, ski mask, gun ... I put him down.
Didn't give him a chance.
My partner ... I want to be the one to tell his wife. He was my responsibility.
Little sore.
What's he saying I did this time?
A ricochet.
Not possible.
I would never shoot at a civilian. I saw a guy wearing a ski mask, dark coat, holding a gun.
I didn't shoot at that.
Wasn't confused.
Yeah.
So I fired more than I thought. So what. I was engaged with multiple hostile targets.
What are you, pissed off because the last time you tried to jam me up didn't work?
What I said in my statement is the truth. 
This going to the next step?
I was in fear for my life.
Yes.
A semiautomatic pistol.
Yes. 
Yes.
That's not my job.
No.
I can't.
I'm not denying that.
No.
Before this goes any deeper, I want to hear it from you. Are you going to try to screw me on this? 
Well?

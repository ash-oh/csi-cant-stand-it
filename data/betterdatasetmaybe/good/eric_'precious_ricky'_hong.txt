Yeah, that's what my mama calls me. Precious
No, ain't seen her before.
Oh, see, that's the problem. You're showing me the wrong end.
Hey, I run an escort service. Strictly legal.
No. No, I don't get mad, man. I'm blissed out. I'm a Buddhist. I let the anger flow right through me. Sentient beings are numberless, and I vow to save them.

No, I couldn't even talk to her. She wouldn't take my calls, so I quit trying.
From a country-western bar. I hit them all when the cowboys come to town.
Yeah, you do that, please.
Hey. Hey! Hey, what you doing, man?

Listen, I've got a patient waiting in pre-op.
Well, there's probably a little bit of a lot of us in Debbie's house.
Don't really know why I'm here.
Her car was in the shop, and I gave her a ride home one night, and she invited me in for a cup of coffee. She didn't like anyone wearing shoes in the house. Some Feng Shui thing.
She was provocative. You take your coat off, she has her clothes off. She came on to me.
My son had a ball game. My daughter was at a swim meet. My wife was at a conference, and the surgery was elective. Not a stretch.
No.
No, but ... I gave it to her.  This one. 
She loved butterflies. Uh, I figured if I gave something special to her, she'd give something special to me.

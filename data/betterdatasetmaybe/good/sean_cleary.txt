Eight years. I never thought she was dead. I wondered where she was, at she was doing with her life. What my kid was like.
My son? You mean it was a boy?
Well, can I see him? Is he dead, too?
Marissa and I had only been seeing each other for a few months, and everything was great. And then she got pregnant, so we got married. And all of a sudden, she hates me, I hate her. All we did was fight. Then she calls me one night at work.
Good! It's the best news I've heard all year.
That was the last time we spoke.
I didn't think she was. I was 19. Barely out of high school. 
She was in her ninth month when she split. I thought she'd cool off in a couple of days, come back, we would work things out. But then I got this.
'You're not who I thought you were. You don't want me. You don't want this baby. We don't want you. Marissa.'
Good! It's the best news I've heard all year.

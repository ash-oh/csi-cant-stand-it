So, Peter, when you checked in at eight ...
The shooter may have cleaned out the machines.
Take was maybe, uh, $600.
You tell us.
You keep lying to us, you're going to be toast in a jumpsuit.
Where'd George go?
You want to show me which one?
Let's start with what you were doing at Big &amp; Best Warehouse, George. You're the day guy. It was the night shift there.
Ski mask?
So, you blacked out. Then what happened?
And then what?
You're a triple threat -- robbery, kidnapping, murder. Big &amp; best foods, Al Sesto, George Bartell. Any of this resonate?
Anything to say, tough guy?
Why, you guys know each other?
Pahrump?
Hey, hey! You looking for more time? Now come on.
Got to hand it to you, Sanders -- nice call. They brought the guy in after he ran his car up onto a median, right behind the Las Vegas sign.
Yeah. Name's Damon Mitchell. Showed symptoms of narcotics withdrawal. According to the police report, he ran his car off the road up onto the median. No damage to the car, no injuries. But he's apparently hyped up on something.
What do you got, doc?
Mr. Mitchell? I'm Detective Vega.
Mind if I ask you a few questions?
Make sure you book him when he gets sober.
We're all out. Mr. Mitchell, are you into psychics?
We know that you went to an occult shop.
Then why lie about it?
Give it a shot.
I bet that pissed you off. So you got revenge by ...
Mr. Mitchell, do you own a gun?
Then where'd you go?
Got any guns in the house, sir?
I'm going to need you to verify the whereabouts of your grandson Jeremiah two nights ago.
How long before he can?
Nick? Greg?
Kids were out here drinking beer, found the dead dogs. Patrol unit came, responded and found the female DB.
Did they leave the party together?
Do you remember what time that was?
Could you be more specific, Doc?
And the kids called in the dead dogs around 2:00.
I'll talk to the husband. I'll keep you posted.
You went home without your wife. Why?
Do you always leave your wife on the dance floor?
Your wife was murdered last night.
Mr. Rodriguez, this is CSI Sanders. He's here to take your fingerprints and your clothes.
Mr. Rodriguez, stand up.
When we're finished here, we'll talk about it. Stand up, please.
Keep an eye on him.
Well, Mr. Aquino ...
Look, you or any of your homies hang out at the Rodriguez Outreach Center?
Tell him to meet you downtown.
If I were you, I'd save my money and start talking.
Did you forget about the camera when you killed Elizabeth Rodriguez?
That makes you an accessory.
You seriously want us to believe that Mrs. Rodriguez, humanitarian of the year, was into dog fighting?
LVPD! Polic√≠a! Freeze! Nadie se mueve! Manos arriba! 
Hands in the air!
Don't even think about it. Let me guess. You found your dog.
Ya basta, Gino. We have a witness who says you killed Elizabeth Rodriguez because she cheated you out of 50 Gs.
One way or another, Gino, you're not going to see the streets for quite a while.
Mr. Rodriguez. Tienes tiempo?
Yes, sir. Tommy Halpert. We have him in custody now.
What did Elizabeth say when you confronted her?

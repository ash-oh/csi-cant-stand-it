It's like a jockstrap, only it hides what it's supposed to strap. 
I'm glad you agreed to meet me. Can I buy you a drink?

Imagine being three years old, tormented by the sensation that you had the wrong parts. Your body's like a foreign country and you're stuck without a passport. All because in your first trimester your 'X' and 'Y' chromosomes split off and went different directions; girl brain, boy body.

I'm sorry?

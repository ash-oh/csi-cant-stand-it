Anonymous 911.
Listen, we haven't had a murder in all of Lincoln County in ten years, let alone a quadruple.
No offense, Mr. Stokes, but did you see the amount of blood in that house? Somebody's dead.
Jude McBride -- great guy, stay-at-home dad. Nina owns a local coffee shop. Jeremy's a junior in high school, smart kid. Ten-year-old daughter, Cassie. Pip-squeak.
Yeah. We don't even know where to start looking.
No. Why?
You placed an anonymous 911 call Sunday night. Said you were outside the McBrides' house and you could see blood in the entryway.
It looks worse if you don't.
You and Jude are making me look like an idiot. He's selling drugs, and you're buying them. Tell me something, Malcolm. Are you high when you treat my daughter?
Hey, Mark! Mark!
Nice game Saturday.
Yep.
Go ahead.
This doesn't look good, Mark. Not a lot of places you can get that much marijuana. There's no way it could be a coincidence. Tell me where the bodies are.
Morning.
My wife made muffins.
You're welcome. We got a lead on the ATM. The account belongs to Jim Locke. He's got a son named Peter, the same age as Mark. We pulled some surveillance footage. It's a little grainy, can't see much.
All right. I'll be in the car waiting when you guys are ready.
We found something in Mark's car that we think might be Peter's. Is that your account number?
Mrs. Locke, when was the last time you took the boat out?
Do you know which friends?
Do you mind if the CSIs take a look at it?
Peter, we know you were in Mark's car. We found your ATM receipt. We also know you guys took the boat out Friday night.
We know that there were three people involved. Who was the third?
Pete, we found your print on a cough syrup bottle, underneath Cassie McBride's bed.
Your buddy Mark's not talking. He's gonna pay for that. You be smarter. You do the right thing.
Mr. Daniels, do you, uh ... do you own a .22 revolver?
We're going to need to speak to Luke.

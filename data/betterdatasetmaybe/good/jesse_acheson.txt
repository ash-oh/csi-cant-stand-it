Well, I certainly didn't kill anyone, and ... I do not know how my fingerprint got there.
You won't believe me.
I did go to see Sue that night.
Sue.
Come on, girl, wake up.
Ma'am, I ... I got a record, and I was on probation. If I'd done all of that, I'd have been ... suspect numero uno. 
I don't need a lawyer, right? I mean, it's off the record?
Well, that's why she left the door unlocked. We'd been doing it that way for years. Whenever Sue came to town, I always took care of her.
I'm really sorry. She was my friend. I wish I could be more help.

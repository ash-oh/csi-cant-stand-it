No, I'm Francis. My wife is the doc.
It's gender-stereotyping, honey.
Well, if I'm being intrusive, please tell me, but, I mean, why are you here?
She's a patient.
My wife is in group.
Mona? These folks need to speak to you.
This is absurd! This is ridiculous! What you have done to my wife is disgraceful! You're not gonna find anything here!
This is discrimination. We are normal people, trying to live a normal life.
Take her home! Would you ... just get her out of here!
Can I take care of my daughter, please?
It's okay, honey. Amber's gonna take you home.
I know.
Mommy's gonna be right back.
She shouldn't be seeing this. She's your kid, too. Take some responsibility.
Good.
I beg your pardon?
Yes, and I performed fellatio on my wife ... after lunch. Is that a crime? I have no idea how anything got into Wendy's mouth. My wife and I did not cheat.  You don't get it, do you? Because we're different. We still love. We still honor.
How dare you?! 
You don't appreciate anything she does for you!
I tried to protect my wife's work. Not just for us. For all the people like us.

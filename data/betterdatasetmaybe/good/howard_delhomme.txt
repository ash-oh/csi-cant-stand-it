She's so beautiful. 
Soft and ... 
... sweet ... like an angel. 
I never meant to hurt her ...
I'll talk ... only for the one in the next room -- The Pretty One.
Why don't you take off your sunglasses and your hat?
Howard.
You walk like a dancer. Do you moonlight? I'll bet you're featured, huh? High dollar. Nice long hair down your back?
I like long hair.
You could grow yours out more, but ...
I'm getting confused. All these people here.
I see pictures of her on tv, in the magazines, the newspapers ...
I'd rather go home.
And smart, too.
That's not how it happened.
I'd like to photograph you.
It was an accident. I wanted to move the car ... and I didn't see her.
Miss Waters had modeled for my client on previous occasions.
I was shooting ... new head shots for her. She was all out. It was a favor. I'm a professional. Ask any of my models.
A couple of rolls.
Mmm ... no.
Okay.
You don't think I'd ever do something like that, do you?
I liked Julie. I took a lot of photographs of her. Even Julie's mother said that no one captured her on film the way I did.
She wanted to loosen up, you know?
She never said stop.
I was afraid of what you'd think of me.
I fired my lawyer.
No.
A woman like you.
She posed naked for me. My brother gave you the pictures. I never forced her to do anything.
God. You bitch. You ... bitch!

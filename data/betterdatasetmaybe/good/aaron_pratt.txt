Don't do that.
These are very rare books.
I wasn't watching her. I always say 'good night' to Veronica because I have to leave at 8:03 to catch the 8:10 bus. It's three blocks away. And sometimes the bus comes at 8:08, so I have to rush to catch it.
'Good night, Veronica.' 'Good night, Aaron.' Sometimes she ... w-walks me to the bus.
'Are you coming?' 'No. You go ahead without me. I have more work to do.'
Then ... a uniball pen ...
rolled across the desk ... fell onto the chair ... 
... hit the floor ...
and stopped rolling at the wastebasket.
Then water ... water falls into her eyes.
From her forehead.
Lots ...
... and then, she grabs her stomach ... with both hands.
... 'Aaron' ... Then she put on her new face. Shelley's Frankenstein. Up and d-down ... flopping around like ...
... a salmon on my uncle's fishing boat.
I ... couldn't help her ... because the cage is locked and I don't have a key.
Othello, act one, scene one. Line 61 and 62, Iago to Roderigo.
It's my ... favorite Shakespeare tragedy.
Mr. Hunter doesn't like me.
He breaks the rules all the time.
No. He... eats his lunch in his office. Carrots, celery tuna on whole wheat ... and Veronica.
She's eating and he takes her sandwich ... 
and he puts his hand on her breast. And then he puts his tongue ... 
That's my mail.
Don't ... don't mix those up.
I have two bills due tomorrow -- gas and electric -- and I have to mail them on my way to work. Don't.
You're messing everything up.
Of course you may.
Mountain spring water, Calistoga, California. Bottled at the source.
You're welcome.
Veronica brought them.
Yes, she was here. We date.
We have dinner -- roast beef, baked potato ... organic broccoli ... acacia pinot noir. Shakespeare in Love. DVD. Miramax. M-c-m-x-c-v-I-I-I.
Why? Don't you think she would date someone like me?
I have a masters in library science and an English Degree from UNLV. And some people like Mr. Hunter, treat me like a freak. But Veronica didn't. She ... loved me. Not him.
Yes, I've heard of ricin. Georgy Markov, 1978. Bulgarian political refugee in London assassinated by injection with a ricin pellet shot out of a black umbrella. Died two days later.
Page 153. I don't touch that book anymore.
Why are you mad at me?
I don't touch this book anymore. It doesn't feel right.
I loved Veronica.
Like a new bus pass. Smooth. Feel the page. It used to feel like my bus pass after a month. Now ... it's rough.
Yes. I told Veronica and I told Mr. Hunter. She said that sometimes the books feel that way after they've been restored.
He said, 'Get out of my office, Aaron, I'm having my lunch!'
Hard-boiled egg, celery, fruit salad, iced tea. Veronica was on a diet. She had to lose three pounds.
Yes.
They fought.
Veronica started crying. Mr. Hunter stopped yelling. He sat down. He started eating. He cut the hard-boiled egg in half.
He reached in the drawer and pulled out the salt shaker.
No s*x, no food, no salt.
Uniball pen rolls across the desk. Falls on the chair, hits the floor and stops rolling at the wastebasket. Then water falls into Veronica's eyes ...
I already told you.
She pulled out a canvas bag. Then she looked around.
She was deciding something.
'All you have in this business is your reputation.'
Oh. Sorry.
Me, too. That's why I was scared.
Of Veronica. Of being in love. I was stupid. I thought she loved me.
'Then must you speak of one that loved not wisely ... 
Othello, act five, scene two, lines 343 and 344.
I didn't kill Veronica.

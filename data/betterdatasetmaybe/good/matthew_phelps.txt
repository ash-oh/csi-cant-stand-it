Get it off. I'm not going to say it again.
Now!
You've watched enough tv for tonight. It's time to go to bed.
Both of you, bed now!
This game saves it automatically.
Oh, no, no, you know how much sugar's in that thing?
Get down!
Son, are you all right?
Aimee?
Aimee! Aimee! Aim ..
They killed my baby.
Cops said they were aiming at some white kid. I thought I was making a difference.
I heard you got the shooter.
You think it's him?
Yeah.
That stuff's expensive, man.
But we managed to get the basketball court tarmacked, thanks to contributions from folk like you.
Well, you was always going places. You just lacked discipline.
You know, it's, it's hard to keep up with it all. I just don't know anymore. What with all the break-ins ...
Rec center's van was stolen a couple days ago. How am I going to tell these kids that they can't play in the semifinals 'cause I got no way of getting them there?
Wednesday.
Just get me five minutes alone with the shooter. Just five minutes. I know it's not going to bring Aimee back ... but I can't sleep at night, knowing that he's still breathing out there. Can you?
Is that him? Why are they letting him go? Why are they letting him go?! What are you guys doing?
What are you doing?! He killed my daughter!
Right here, man.
Trav, go to your room.
Look, you went there too. That's how I knew where to go.
He didn't kill your daughter!
Yeah, yeah. And then what? Lawyers? Trial? You wait ten years for somebody else's definition of Justice. And they always put the criminal's rights before the victim's. The first good night's sleep I had was last night.
My perspective has changed. Aimee's dead.
It's going to be okay, Trav. I love you, son. 
All right.
Tyrel Constantine. Oh, yeah, I knew him. He used to hang out at the rec center.
Until he lost his privileges.
He was smoking weed on the field. Showing up late to practice. Starting fights.
A couple weeks ago.
Why, why, why are you asking me about Tyrel?
Oh, god.
I gave up on him. If I hadn't ...

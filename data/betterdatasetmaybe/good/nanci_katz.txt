Mmm. I have not ever tasted a fig this juicy.
Mmm.
Mmm. It's so much better.
Baby, are you okay?
What happened?
Yeah?
Yes! Yes.
Oh, my gosh. I can't even see it, but it feels big. The ring, I mean.
Yes! Yes!
It was dark; nobody, could see. I wanted to say yes.
Loud and clear? There's a lot of metal under those tables.
Way too much.

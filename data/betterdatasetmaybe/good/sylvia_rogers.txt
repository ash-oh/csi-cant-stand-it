Well, Tripper's not exactly a Chihuahua. Goes where he wants, comes back for dinner. Sometimes he brings dinner back.
Tripper! Come on, buddy, dinner.
Oh, what is it this time, a rabbit or a possum?
Well, he got a little lethargic after chewing on that he took him to the vet, ran some tests. He got better. I just want to keep him that way. Where there's a head there's got to be hands and feet, and sooner or later, he'll dig 'em up.
They do studies on that?
All the time.

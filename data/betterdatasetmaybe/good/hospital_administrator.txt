We have two types of patients here: The criminally insane and sexually violent predators, all with multiple convictions.
We get all the inmates the prisons can't handle.
Keep your kits closed and locked when not in use. Um, Ms. Sidle, best if you remove the vest. New uniforms upset them.
We're mostly concerned with maintaining psychiatric remission. We want to stabilize symptoms and reduce an individual's risk of violence to himself and to others.
Oh, uh, could you actually stop here and put your backs against the wall, please.  It's, uh, standard safety procedure. 
We're moving them all to the day room.
This is Captain Brass. Dr. Grissom and Ms. Sidle are from the Crime Lab.
We have our own internal police team and Lieutenant Owens was the first officer on the scene after the call came in.
No. The doors are left unlocked.
Locked rooms usually lead to patients trying to harm themselves.
We're legally required to tape all our sessions.
This is Robbie in the seclusion room the day he died.
As you can see, the on-call doctor and Nurse McKay checked in on him.
Two hours later, he was escorted out, so I resent the accusation. We've made a lot of changes. Policy, staff, surveillance have all been overhauled. Look, Robbie left the seclusion room alive.
Uh, the nurses, psych techs. Why is this important?
Maybe he was cheeking them.
They think they don't need 'em. They sell 'em, trade 'em or ... store them up, get high later.

I want to know who did this.
He was kind ... and sweet and ... didn't have an enemy in the world.
Not really. He was always so busy putting in overtime down at the ... water treatment plant. He loved to take long runs. Exercise is a natural cure for depression.
No. These are all mine. I had a mastectomy eight years ago. Cancer came back three months ago.
I never thought I'd outlive my son. Is there anything else?
Paul Cyden. He's a family friend; he lives a couple blocks over.
Oh, he was like a father to Brian after my husband died. 
Why are you asking about Paul?
I don't know.  What's going on here?
My son was not a freak.
I volunteered to let you in my house! And now I want you to leave. I want you to leave right now!
He needed a haircut.
I was too busy taking care of me ... to see what was wrong with him. The signs were there.
I should have pushed. If I had gone through his room before he died ... maybe then ... 
I was trying to understand why. I went through his e-mails. Paul was taking him to LA. I trusted him, and all those years that he pretended to be our friend ... He killed my son.
I worked two jobs to keep us in our house because ... because Brian loved it so much. And being there is what killed him.

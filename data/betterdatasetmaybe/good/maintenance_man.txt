I was just clocking a little overtime. 
Management said they wanted a few extra coats of paint on three, seven and eleven. Got to keep everything nice and pretty for the tenants.
Yeah, well, that guy doesn't see much. Service elevator's out. We have to use the stairs. God forbid the tenants ever have to look at one of us.
Yeah. But we only go in if a tenant specifically asks us to fix something.
Nope. Never.
Yeah. It's holding up half the building.

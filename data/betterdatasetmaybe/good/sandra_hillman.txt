No. No, Joey's hearing was fine. Why would he have that?
Wait a minute.  Danny ... swore to me he'd keep Joey out of that racket.
My older son. He's a runner, too. They wear remote earpieces. That's how they talk to the guy they worked for. We've had full-scale wars about him doing that -- carrying around that kind of money-- but does he stop? No. He gets Joey involved.
I haven't seen him in a week. And he hasn't returned my calls. 
Do you think something's happened to him, too?
Uh ...  This is my son Danny. He heard about Joey and came home.
No! No. No names.
And if you talk, they'll come after you.  No. No, I'm not losing another child.

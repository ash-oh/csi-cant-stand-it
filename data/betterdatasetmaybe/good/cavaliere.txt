You got a lot of witnesses claiming to have seen what happened.
Down! Everybody down! Down!
Somebody shot this guy in front of all these cops? They did not want him talking to us.
How'd they know Fausto was here?
I bet you he tried to reach out for help, you know? Maybe money or a ticket out of here.
Glad I'm not Vartann. He's got to tell the undersheriff.
Vartann, this is Cavaliere. We've recovered an expended .223 cartridge case from a building overlooking the motel. It's on its way to the lab now. Scene here is secure. Patrol just called. They found a 411-a behind 5203 Maryland Parkway. Sounds like it might be the Buick Regal. I'm going to head over there now.

Honey, who's out there?
Yes.
Did you find her?
Hmm.  You always hope ...
Fay only lived here for about a month, five years ago. 
I've got nothing to hide.
Yeah, that's right.
It's just a warped floorboard.
Maybe, a while ago. Why?
Not that I recall.
Yeah.
What are you doing?
I'd like you fellows to leave now, please.
I vacuumed up the sand. Big deal. Will you at least tell me what you're doing here?
I know what you're doing. You're looking for blood.
I didn't kill her.
I worked the Summercliff job less than a week. Ask Amy. She worked for the same contractor.
I didn't kill Fay! I loved her. I STILL love her.
Amy, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Call my father. He'll get a lawyer. I didn't do it. It's okay.
I can prove I was in Reno when Fay disappeared. I've got records. You don't want to talk, fine. But I've got a question for you. Why do you care so much about the floors? I mean, Amy paints them every spring. It's no big deal.

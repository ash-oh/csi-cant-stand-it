Around 7:00, there was a 444 call ... 
False alarm. We came right back. Observed no activity in the house until you guys got here.
Why would we off two scumbags when we know you're coming back with a warrant?
And you're not my supervisor.
Wh-what's the big deal? There's no humans involved. 
Kid in that house made us. Thought we were bad news.
I'm sick of this lock-down, man.
Are we done?
We already gave you our footprints, and our fingerprints are on file, so what else do you need?

Forty buys the lips, a hundy gets you south. Goes double for around the world.
You got a car?  You sure about that?
'Cause you don't look like you got a car to me.
I didn't do nothing but sit here, officer.
Can't believe you're gonna ruin my day for this. You don't have enough to charge me with solicitation. 
Hey! Watch it, bitch.
We been sitting here a long-ass time.
What'd you bring me down here for? I was only trying to make a few bucks.
Match to what?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Wasn't even like that. My cousin Candy left me with them bad-ass kids and no money. How am I supposed to feed them?
Know what, skinny bitch, go to hell. I just scrape by.
I promised I wouldn't. Little D got hurt last time. She would've killed me.
I did the best I could.
Uh-uh, you're not gonna blame this on me. I want a lawyer.
Move over Chester, my dogs are barking.
Come on, now. 
Move over a little bit. Let me sit down. 
Chester, damn!
Oh, sweet Lord.
That guy? Uh-uh, no. Okay, but this guy, uh-huh.  Uh-huh, he was definitely at the Rancho Center Motel. He was there ... um ... three nights ago. Had his little camera with him and everything.
Yeah, like video camera and all that stuff.
Um ... don't I get a reward?

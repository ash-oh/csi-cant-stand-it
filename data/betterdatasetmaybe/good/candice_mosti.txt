And now, the moment that we've all been waiting for. The winner of the brand-new Humvee is ...
Kyle Shaw!
So my prints are on the RV. Okay, I work that display sometimes.
What am I supposed to do? I'm broke and my car insurance is due.
Forgot to rub it in, I guess.
Donny asked us to hang out with Mr. Daluca after work.
Me, Lisa, Dana, and Lane.
Look, I'm not a hooker. All I do is these conventions. So when a big baller like Mr. Daluca comes into town and offers us a little cash to hang out, I'm with it.
We had dinner at Fix. Partied at Mix. Gambled a little. Then he took us back to the convention center. Hammered and horny.
I left there as soon as I could. I took a cab home.
Not that I saw. He didn't even want to touch her.
When I left, Daluca was busy with Dana and Lane, and Lisa locked herself in the bathroom. That was the last time I saw her.

Excuse me. I'm Hayden Michaels. I'm the Manager of the Four Aces. I just got the call. Anything we can do to help?
Detective, if this hits the media, this is really going to hurt our business.
Anything you can do to keep it out of the press?
Like I said, I'm more than happy to help you in any way I can. So, when I got your phone call about the scent of our bleach, I figured you should to talk to Lucy. Lucy is our head of housekeeping.
Yeah. Two eldest are at UNLV.
Jake. Jake is, uh, six months old.
Mm-hmm.
Why are we talking about my vasectomy?
Look. If word leaks out that you took my DNA and I'm a murder suspect, I will never work in hospitality again. I'm sorry, the answer's no. Anything else?
What is this? What's going on?
She can't ... you can't do that.
No, I know my rights.
The bitch broke into my car.

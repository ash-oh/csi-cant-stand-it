Yeah, runs the dryers.
He's been off a couple days now.
Sure. They work here, too.
Brothers. Keo's older. I hear they got six more back in Laos. They work swing -- they're on at 4:00.
No! No way. Keo and Noy are Lao Loum. They're lowlanders. Samay's Hmong; he's in the hills. They're born to hate each other. Some tribal crap. What kind of trouble are they in?
And Thai, Vietnamese, Tagalog. I pulled a stint straight out of high school. I got southeast Asia; lucky me.
Did Keo tell you what happened? I mean, his English isn't very good.
If you need any help, you let me know.
He says he thought Samay was there to rob him. That's why he shot him.
I told you what he said. You're not arresting me because I screwed up my translation?
So what? I help my guys try to get a little security for their families. I help them in a lot of ways. Driver's licenses, green cards ...
Without me, they're back in a rice paddy making three cents a day. Look, some of these guys put me on their policy. It's their way of saying
You don't really think I'd have somebody killed for five grand?
That don't mean I did it. There's new casinos that open all the time. They all got laundries. I bring home 15 G's a month on the side. So I am not going to bend over a dollar to pick up a dime.

One of the first homicides I ever worked. Damn, I had good handwriting. Excuse me.
Come on, come on, I know you got company.
Yeah, that's it. Oh, man.
It's not my fault, man. I had the scumbag dead to rights.
This is it. That's the killer's hair.
Yeah, but the position-location was all wrong. I pulled that out of her navel, just that one hair. It was a sexual assault, It had to be from the killer. But I couldn't prove it, so... I didn't write it down.
In '89? Man, we were just reading about DNA. The only lab in the country that was doing that stuff was the FBI, and my supervisor -- he wouldn't have called them in on a case like this. 
I used to bust my ass to keep a crime scene pristine, and then some uniform would wobble over, stuffing his face, drop a hamburger wrapper right at my feet. Who the hell needs that? 
Man, if I had the tools you guys do today ... I finally would have been a real hero.
Damn it.
Permount on a microscope slide with a cover slip. It should still be in Central Property.

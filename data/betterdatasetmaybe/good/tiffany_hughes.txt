I had no idea my mom had given up a kid. But I did know that there was no way she could handle dealing with it.
Yeah. My dad and I have a system. We screen all her mail.

Wasn't worth the risk. The anti-depressants and the horses help, but my mom's barely hanging on. And I only have a year left before I go to college. I just need her to hang on one more year. So, I sent the polite response and hoped it was over.
Who's Jill?

I'm an only child who lives on a horse farm in the middle of nowhere with a horse- whispering mother and a dad who works all the time to avoid her. When Amanda's letter came ...

It started where I would just drive by.
Well ... once, I saw her in the yard, playing with her little boy. So I started parking out front, hoping to see her again.

It was like a TV commercial.

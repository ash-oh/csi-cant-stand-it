We haven't seen Karen or Jesse since, um ...  ... uh ... since ... 
Here. Here's your toy soldier.
He's my grandson. It-it's, it's a toy.
Jesse comes from a, from a long line of military men going all the way back to Bull Run. Were you in the service?
I bet your dad was, too, right?
She blames me.
Don't tell me what I know and don't know, all right?
Where is it?
This is just between you and me. I saw Karen last week.
Oh, hi, Karen, uh, could I see Jesse please?
Karen, he's my only grandson.
I don't want to keep him, Karen. I just want to give him these. Please.
Jesse! It's Grandpa. Jesse!
Where's my wife?
It's early Alzheimer's.
All I wanted was to see my grandson. Find him for me.

Very glad to be back home.
I was a captive, held against my will. From what the sheriff tells me, I've been gone over a week. Feels like just seconds.
Well, yes, but you won't believe me.
They were very tall ... with reptilian features: large, almond-shaped, red eyes.
I appreciate your skepticism. I anticipated it. Insight begins with asking the right questions.
Nine days ago.
What do you mean Chyna is missing? What happened to her?
That was callous of you. Unnecessarily cruel. I had no idea. That sweet girl ... 
Are you suggesting that was romantic?
That's easy. 
There's a woman, and it is romantic, very romantic. I was with her when they took me. Her name is Clarissa Niles.
Do you have any idea how beautiful you are?  I mean really, really, really beautiful. More so every day.
You know, I didn't want to alarm you, but they put an implant in you. They do it while you're sleeping so they can manipulate your thoughts. My injections disabled it. You're not only cancer-free, you're free of their control.
You have a destiny. You were chosen. You are a Protector of Mankind. Have no fear.  Cut off her tail, she lives. Cut off her head, she dies.
Chyna was sucking the life out of me. She deserved none of what she wanted and all of what she got in the end. I'm glad it took a long time for her to die. I can only imagine the pain.

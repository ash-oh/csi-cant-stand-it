People say that Las Vegas has no culture, ... no history-- that we emulate, ... not create.
They forget that this was once a desert from which this city was created. 
Millions come every week and share their money with us. Well, tonight, we give back.
An exhibition of rare and valuable japanese antiquities.
Shown in the us for the first time,
... this 17th century samurai collection ... 
... is owned by one of the Mediterranean's most special guests, Mr. Yuri Yamamoto, who sadly can't be here with us tonight.
To his impeccable taste. On behalf of my hotel and the City of Las Vegas, I thank him.
I'll be damned. You found the guy?
See? I promised you this matter would be resolved, Yuri.
Surely this is open for conversation, Mr ...
Oh, my god. The cash-- it's gone.  How the hell did they get in here?
Ninety percent of the casino's cash is in the basement vault. I only keep an emergency reserve here.
Ten million ... at all times.
And you just wheeled him in here? 
Get my lawyer. Assemble everyone. I need answers.
How did you open the safe door?
Nothing in my vault or in my office, but I'll get you everything from this floor. 
A what?
Vanessa Green. I-I thought you spoke to her yesterday.
Mr. Yamamoto? Mr. Yamamoto? I'd like a word with you. Mr. Yamamoto?
Son of a bitch! He made a fool out of me.
Find out when he checked out.
And Vanessa Green. Where did she go?
Along with my $10 million.
And he left without his antiques.
What's this?
Thank you for reminding me.
Strong little b*st*rd.
What?
I'm sorry. I'm all out.
What's your point?
'Your notions, though many, are not worth a penny.'
Notions are all you have. Otherwise, we'd be downtown instead of here in my office. You know, I've always been a big supporter of the arts. Hence, Mr. Yamamoto ... 
hence, the exhibition. Over the years, I've financed theatrical productions.
Yes, well, until then, Mr. Grissom.

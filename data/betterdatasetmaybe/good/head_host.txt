Would you like a Meet Book or do you have a steady host?
This is a host club, a place where men entertain women. It's the first of its kind in Las Vegas. They started in Japan. Take your pick.
Hosts get paid by the bottle. There's a two-bottle minimum. Bottles range from $50 to $5,000.
We only sell one brand of champagne. It's the host attached to the bottle that determines price.
Miss, we don't sell s*x here.
A relationship. Isn't that what most women want?
Who doesn't? Let me see if he's avail.

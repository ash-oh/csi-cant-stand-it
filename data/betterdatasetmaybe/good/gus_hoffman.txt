Jill had OCD-related depression, which is very deceiving because the sufferers are high functioning. It's not your usual, you know, 'lie on the couch and listen to the Beatles' kind of depression.
You know, when a patient dies, the doctor-patient confidentiality clause is void. But I'm just sort of feeling a little uncomfortable. Do I have to ... call a lawyer?
Okay. All she would say was that she didn't get along with her parents, and that, um, you know, relationships in general were difficult. I mean, her condition made her excel professionally but flop personally. 
Her parents never told her. Huh. Well, that explains her abandonment-attachment issues, and why she always felt like a square peg in a round family.
Off the record, no, I don't. I don't think she was suicidal, I thought, I actually thought she was getting better.
'Cause the choice was there.
At the end of the day, when an obsessive brain is presented with a choice, it just, sometimes, it just can't shut off the clatter of the idea until it sees it through to conclusion.
The idea found its way in.
Her relationship with me was the most intimate she's ever had. I actually felt like we were making progress.
What are you talking about? She committed suicide.
What are -- What are you suggesting, that I murdered my own patient?
Well, we did go to dinner that night, but afterwards I dropped her off. Because she said she had to work to do. I didn't even go inside, so I don't even understand your question.
Yeah, It's true that, in the past, we engaged in some, you know, some, uh, role playing s*x games to help get her comfortable, but ...
She was the 'S.' I was the 'M.'

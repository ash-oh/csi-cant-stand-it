Sounds familiar.
Oh, yeah, right. Her. I installed some DSL lines there a few days ago. She answered the door in her panties.
I wish. Kind of girl that makes you happy to be a man, know what I'm saying?
Whoa. I-I lost an awl at a job recently. It must have been there.
Yeah, sure. Um, I'll pull one from the office. I'll run it right over.
What's the problem?
I'm not a stalker.
I only listened when I thought she was in trouble.
Stay away from Bianca.
You're not taking her to Colorado.
I just wanted her to be happy.
No. Those other guys were jerks. I only wanted to scare him off.
That worked.
I came to see you.
Your mom wants us to be together.
Her mother and I weren't always going to be around to clean up her messes.

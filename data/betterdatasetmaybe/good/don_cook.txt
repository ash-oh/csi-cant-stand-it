Okay, I know this is my third violation, but I was not speeding. I-I blew past that light because I had a fight with my wife.
Okay, look, I, I cannot have my license suspended. I have a vending machine business.
Yeah, yeah, no. Um, yeah, there was, there was a guy who walked past my car.
I thought I was gonna get robbed on top of everything else.
Sure, yeah. He walked under a streetlight. I saw him. I saw him real clear. He, um ... He was Hispanic ... uh ... I don't know, bald, scary looking.
So all I got to do is just point it and shoot it?
Can we please just not talk about this now?
Cody, get in the car.
Listen. I loved the dress till I found out it cost 300 bucks.
You have a closet full of dresses ... get in the car.
I'm not apologizing.

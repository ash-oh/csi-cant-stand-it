Yeah, I got a call. 'You want a wrecked S-Class?'
You betcha. The parts alone are worth four or five times the blue book value of the car. I asked where do I pick it up. That's all I asked.
Someone throws you three hundred thou in used parts the only response is 'thank you very much.'
Look around.
Hey, I called it in. What more do you want?
Maybe it wasn't totaled. I don't remember. I was only interested in the parts.
It was a guy. What else can I tell you?
I was 18. It was a prank. I hoisted the principal's station wagon onto the roof of the gym.
That might ring a bell. So what?
Okay, look, all I did was take his call, take his car. I don't even like the guy. In high school, he's the one who turned me in. He said he wanted to make it up to me.

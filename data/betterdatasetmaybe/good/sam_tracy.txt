Are you sure the bear came from our zoo?
Oh, God. It's Tippy. What happened?
We sold him to a broker a few weeks ago. He said he found him a home at the Columbus Zoo.
Animal broker. Visitors want to see babies. The brokers find other zoos to purchase our surplus adult animals. You know, Tippy was so gentle, he'd eat grapes right out of my hand.
Yeah, I'll pull the file, but ... I remember the broker's name. It's Ken Bovitz. Out of Chicago. He mailed me his broker's license and documentation. The board approved the sale last fall.  They'll want to know what went wrong.
And you think the broker's documentation was forged here on my copier?
Uh, a wild animal is released into a controlled area where a hunter pays a fee to kill it. The promoters guarantee a trophy, so no kill, no pay. They're illegal in Nevada. Is that what happened to my bear?
Yeah. Maintenance.
About six months ago. We let a lot people go. Cutbacks.
Wait, so you're thinking he forged the broker's document and took Tippy under false pretenses?
You can't prove I was there.
What?
I got this gardening.

Now what?
Hmm. And I thought you were gonna tell me you were gonna charge somebody with my daughter's death. Drink?
Not a peep about my daughter, but page one on Macklin's rich bitch. Oh, you boys sure move quicker when there's cash behind it.
Why don't you kiss my ass.
For you, maybe. I got a call for a pickup. I went. Trying to keep my head in the work, 'cause what else do I have left?
You get out of this car.
You wanna pay!? You wanna pay!?
I told her I was gonna put two bullets in her head and dump her on her daddy's front step.
No. I told her what I felt like doing so her father would know the way I feel. And she got out, and she ran, and it's a good thing she ran, because I might've changed my mind.
I'm not that guy anymore.
It really doesn't make any difference what you do to me.
My baby's dead.
Yeah, there were friends here. And enemies.
Stokes, you trying to get me in trouble?
I went outside to have a cigarette-- told her I wouldn't smoke in the house. Filthy habit. Trying to quit.
Uh, yeah, that's right.
All right. She's the target. She told you all she knows.
Oh, we had some good times.
No, she had guts. She staged her exit like a pro. The book, the party ... she only made one mistake -- she hired an amateur.
A wimp and a thief. Lois would give you all the cookies you wanted, but you stuck your hand in the cookie jar ... she'd chop it off.
She didn't want to involve an old friend.
Well, who else do I have to take care of?
She sent it to my sister. You know, you've got a choice between checking out all shriveled up, in a hospital, or at home, looking like a million bucks. Any guy who'd do that for a good friend, he's okay by me. 
Doll ... you're going to see him before I do.

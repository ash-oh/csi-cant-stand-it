Yeah, that's me.
Tessa Press.
We sat next to each other on the bus.
No, mom, it's okay. I-I'm 15. I felt sorry for her. The girls picked on her. Made fun of her frizzy hair, her old clothes. Stuff like that. She'd sit next to me, and they'd leave her alone.
It wasn't like that. I just got my learner's permit. My mom was waiting in the car. We were just going to get slushies. I saw Tessa in the parking lot.
Hey, Tessa. Hey.
You want a ride, just door to door?
Oh, come on. You're not scared to drive with me, are you?
She said she was getting a ride from someone else.
No. But when we pulled away, I saw her getting into a truck. I didn't see the driver.
99 was so hot.
I don't really know anything about these cases.
I don't know. I have a lot of work to do.
How ... ?
That's Thoreau.
Stalker maybe?
I'll marry you. Although, you know, my grandmother's still alive. She lives down in Boca. I don't know if you know this, but I am the shuffleboard champion of the Boca Surf and Sand. Mm. Ladykiller of the senior set.
Wait. Is he okay with us being in here?
Did either of them have any connection to Izzy Delancy?
He laced her booze with liquid nicotine, which induced convulsions.
Red dog barks at midnight.
Yeah.
I can't even do it with my cat watching. Wait. s*x, drugs, rock and roll. Do you think it's a pattern?
Yeah, that's right, he was caught on tape in an animal rights PSA made by Izzy Delancy.
This guy can't stay away from a camera.
We can hear you.
Miniature number four was another home, a unit in a high-rise condo, complete with a working fireplace ... and a dead cat.
But the MO on this one was full of anomalies.
It was sent to the Crime Lab shortly after Ernie Dell's suicide, but before the murder had actually been committed.
And the really weird part was the package was addressed directly to Grissom.
Oy.
Yeah, here, it looks like the killer put some kind of gizmo on the flue. See, the timer went off, activated a motor, which sealed the flap and dropped powdered charcoal onto the fire, producing carbon monoxide. So the fumes had nowhere to go but out into the apartment and into the undercover officer.
Calls made to all four victims?
Well, the victims don't have much in common, so I say we go metaphoric. Hypocrisy.
Okay. Look, clearly the killer is into signatures, right? I mean, the miniatures themselves are signatures, and then within each miniature, they all have this doll thing.
So, we're looking for an obsessive, meticulous, dark-ass misanthrope who seeks recognition for his efforts.
Can I have a chip?
Thank you.
All the miniatures have food.
Eggs ...
Booze ...
Tea and cookies ...
... milk ... 
And a chicken?
You've never lived in Pennsylvania.
Like blowing up a buffet.
Did you guys see â€˜Scream'?
What about music? Izzy has gold records, Penny had a record player, Barbara had high-end stereo equipment.
The squeals of dying chickens?
What about flowers? The flower delivery guy might have access to the space.
Flour canister?
What about mail?
There's mail on the counter, mail on the floors, mail on the desk ... no mail in the henhouse.
Look, if this is really about the killer trying to reveal something, is there anything that's gotten more in-your-face with each successive miniature?
What about newspaper? Starts out on the counter, then all over the floor, then with the doll, as the headline. That's bolder and bolder.
Okay, buzz kill. You come up with a theory.
Well, then, maybe we should start with that one and work our way out.
Okay, look, we gave it a try. There's nothing in this thing but machinery. Let's just put it back.
Wouldn't know anything about that. We're holed up in a lab all day.
Got to go. Good luck.
Hey, Grissom. About your hanging victim. The one with the 'chesticals.'  ... gynecomastia, sorry.
Quant hormone report. Androgen's low. Estradiol's high. It's 250 picograms per milliliter. Arogester one, too.
It's consistent with a pre-op transsexual.
Maybe he's a 'do-it-yourselfer.'
Okay.
What are you guys looking for?
Really? I didn't know that.
Look, just 'cause I have those compounds in my fridge doesn't mean I used them to make nitro-acetate. 
You can't prove that.
It's also used to absorb odors. Nice smell is a priority of my life.
Okay, I confess! I did it!
Hello?
Hello!
Hello?! It's not funny!
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, help!
Help me!
Please help!
A duster? 
You made me a lousy duster? That is totally bogus! Okay, aside from the 10,000 other reasons why I'd be crazy to even try that junk, if I were a closet PCP freak, I wouldn't do it in the lab.
Archie told me about your sick little thought experiment, and I want to play. But I still can't believe, even hypothetically, you'd do something like this to me.
Then how did the PCP get into my system?
Hey.
And that stuff reeks. I have to crank my fume hood up full whenever I work with it, I still go home with a headache.
Wendy.
Hey, I think it's got a nice ring to it.
All right, come on, let's do another one.
You will be missed.
It's endearing.
What exactly is the oily stuff?
Really? He scares me.
Okay, so we don't have nearly enough to hold Bobby, right?
We have to get back to the case file.
Wait a second. That's familiar.
Singed right off her barely 35-year-old wrist.
So, what melts silver and stops your heart at the same time?
From what?
Wired to the ladder and the evidence box?
No. 
It's ridiculous! Anyone could have walked in there. So, what, the victim's just random?
This is so lame.
That was good.

Uh-huh.
I didn't really know the girl who died. I still can't believe what happened. It's just awful.
I was alone in my apartment Saturday night. Hello. What's new, right? I was reading or something.
And then, suddenly, there was someone pounding on my door.
Well, he was a fireman. I mean, he was wearing a mask. It all happened pretty quick.  Why?
He knocked on my door. Are you saying you think he was going to rape me?
You know, I was pretty freaked.
When he was standing there in front of me ... just before he left ... 
... I swear, for a second, it felt like he wasn't going to let me go.

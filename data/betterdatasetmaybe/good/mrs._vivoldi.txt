I'd had just finished lunch with the girls. We say 'girls,' but we're, you know, women. I don't find being called a 'girl' derogatory.
I was walking to the car.  The SUV? A gift from Oscar. Thirty years with the same man.
Thank you. Are you married?
Oh. And you?
Walking to the car, and I think I stepped into gum or something ...
That's when I called 911.  Which was about, um ... two hours ago.
Oh.

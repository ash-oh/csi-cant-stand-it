I can't do this right now.
Erin and Paul Brady's.
Yeah, I wasn't in the mood. She was.
Partying.
Around 11:00, I think.
Crack runs right through the deep end. Had to drain it. Half the neighbors have cracked slabs, leaky roofs. This was perfect when Vanessa and I moved in. Place isn't built to last.
Why are you here?
Why?
Some, I guess. It was that kind of party.
She could have been. After I left. What does this have to do with her accident?
We were with our friends. Our best friends. I wouldn't have left her there if I didn't think she was safe.
What's she talking about?
What?!
I'm gonna to kill that son of a bitch!
Let's go.

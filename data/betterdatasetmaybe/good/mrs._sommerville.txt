Angela was the sweetest child. She actually liked spending time with us. Her friends were always over here, and then ... puberty hit and everything changed. 
It was like she couldn't get comfortable in her own skin.
About, um, six months ago, Angela went Goth. Black clothing ... she only went out at night ... 
We tried to support Angela the best we could. We only wanted her to be happy.

Her court. I can give you their names.
It's like a coven for vampires.

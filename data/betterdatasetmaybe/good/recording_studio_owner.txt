Yeah, I can put you in touch with her Manager, Eddie Willows. Guy owes me a call. Make that five calls. If you talk to him, tell him he's got, like, eight hours of studio fees due. The penalties are running, okay?
Oh, that makes sense why he wasn't here last night. High-strung singer, no manager, that's always trouble.
Get back in the booth.
Eddie was just in it for the quick score. Cut a demo, sell a contract, get a ride on the charts and you just ride that wave.
Yeah, he was banging her.
Whoa. It sounds good from where I'm standing-- what's up?
Lady, if the guy standing next to you is Clive Davis, instead of a cop, it would be.
Um, yeah, a few more hours. We were redoing a drum track.

Sir, I'm on your side. I just want to clear you.
I understand that. But the evidence is telling us something different. So I'm going to ask you again, just one more time -- before you shot the deceased did a struggle ensue?
Okay, go inside. Dust for prints. Make sure you take plenty of photographs ...
All right.
Cath, you want some coffee?
Summerlin ... rich folks.
Yeah, the DA asked me to testify on chain of custody.
I could do that in my sleep.
Yeah.
See you.
Yeah. I got a call earlier today from Child Services asking about you and Lindsey.
They told me they'd notified you -- some investigation -- that Eddie had made a charge or something.
Well, I ...
Thanks.
What's he know about the forensic analysis of a friction ridge?
Mr. Ziegler, one more thing. What about the security alarm?
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Disaster? What do you mean?
Yeah, but you think I'd say that?
Hey, Catherine. Check this out. 
You see that?
I think the thief must have pressed his head against the wall to check if the painting was wired.
Hey, a jury convicted a first-degree murderer based on a print just like this two years ago in Washington.
Well, we can get a warrant.
I'm just going to press this against your ear. See?
Jason?
The earprint talking.
Sir, are you going to want to press charges?
Hey.
What's up?
At least we solved our case.
Give me an evidence tag for this painting.
I know, every time you say that, I'm looking at more overtime.
You know what? I got to be somewhere.
Yeah, right. Can you handle this from here?
Cool. I'll see you later.
What?
Oh, I told them as far as mothers are concerned, you're the bomb.
Yeah. And I also told them your ex is pretty screwed up.  No worries.
This painting's a forgery? Where does it say that?
It's not our job to authenticate art. Case is closed.
So, the kid stole the original painting from his pop and gave us back a forgery.  No wonder he copped to it so easy.
Nice campus you got there, Jason.
We were by your dorm earlier with the police here.
That's not all, sir.
No, sir. The police recovered your originals from Jason's dorm room today.
What, did you have an art major do your fakes for you, Jason?
Your son stole all your originals replacing them with forgeries.
He didn't have time to make the switch.
If the hook hadn't dislodged from your Sorenson you would have spent the rest of your life admiring fakes.
You know what, I got to be somewhere. Can you handle this from here?
Hey. I missed assignments; I know. I'm running late. What did I pull?
I handed it off to Michovitch, from days. Uh, I told Sara.
Yeah. 
What's that?
What? I don't believe this. Now you're pulling up film on me?
We do.
I was at the casino. But I wasn't gambling.
Damn! Taking the whole window.
And you have a problem with that.
Hey! This has nothing to do with you. So are we going to work together ... or not?
You know what that means?
It means the glass on your pants and the glass from your living room window have equal densities.
The glass didn't come from any car window. That's science.
You're free to go.
We're not cops; we can't hold him.
Showed him all your cards. Sucker play.
Oh, you just don't let up, do you?
Yeah, passed up a chance to play semipro ball. Went to college instead.
That's the glass you 'sawzalled.'
Oh, now I'm worthy?
Maybe you did, maybe you didn't, but we think you murdered him.
The evidence.
When a window is broken from the outside which is what a burglar would do ...
... Haeckel marks form right angles to the inside of the window. 
But when a window is broken from the inside which is what a Peckerwood like you would do
... Haeckel marks form right angles to the outside of the window.
Well, we know he did it.
He needed the money.
We're back to how do we prove it?
And his computer is ... ?
Still at the house. Well, we got probable cause.
Why don't you go get a new warrant?
Well, we got a warrant so that should give us the room for the night.
Computers turn on. When they don't, it's for a reason. Did you plug it in?
Really?
Let me check it out.
Well, he's a sneaky S.O.B. I'll give him that.
All right.
Let me see that flashlight. There's scratches all over it.
And the hotshot takes another strike. Check it out. Not enough to cause even a small scratch on your finger, but more than enough to use as a basis of comparison.
One, two, three.
Left one is from the broken window the other one is from the gun both dropping at an identical rate. Glass is from the same source.
My theory ... the brother was the executor of the parents' estate. He controlled the family money.
I called the county clerk. With the brother out of the way, Kenny is the sole beneficiary.
Slam that jail door.  Makes you reconsider, doesn't it?
Hey, Jas, how you doing?
Gets you more attention than you want.
You still working on those moves I showed you?
How about that? How about that right there? Good.
Hey, come here.
Apologize to your mom, all right? Let her know she can trust you.
All right?
See you next week, jaws.
He needed my help. I didn't win anything, Sara. You're a CSI. You saw me enter a casino. Did you see me place a bet?
I don't have to tell you anything.  We're supposed to be working together. Next time, just try talking to me instead of going around behind my back.
I'll take a piece of that.
Can a CSI take over another CSIi's case?
Hey, what happened to that, uh, meeting the other day?
Yeah, the department heads were voting on an extra vacation day or something?
What do you think? The kid might have started it?
We don't rule anything out.
Well, fires take the path of least resistance. I mean, they feed off of oxygen and combustibles.
Firemen wear rubber gloves.
According to Ecklie's report, which was filed in record time, the point of origin for the fire was the closet. Gris, there's nothing left here.
Well, that confirms Ecklie's findings about the use of an accelerant.
Damon doused the closet floor with gasoline, lit it and got the hell out of dodge.
Who cares? The guy torched his wife and kid.
Runners, huh? I know a little something about that world.
It breaks down like this. There's about a half a dozen runners in town -- they're mostly kids -- and they make about two 'g's' a week. And they all work for the same guy.
I used to be a runner in college. It paid the bills. I had route five. Worked Boulder, Sunset, Vacation, and the bay -- all of that.
The Voice.
I knew it. That's Grissom. I got to bail.
You don't. He's not who you're looking for anyway. If you want to know who capped this kid? Then you should talk to another runner. I mean, they'll kill each other for a good route.
What's going on?
Same conditions in Damon's bedroom, night of the fire.
Flashover. So, that confirms the first part of Damon's story.
'Alligatoring'.
But that piece was a doorframe outside of the bedroom -- which was a contained site.
So what happens now?
You got me.
Sifting through this debris.
You mind?
Give me a hand with this mattress.
Or it was. I figure it must have burned up in the bedroom and the firemen threw it out here with the rest of this overhaul.
Or overload a house. 
Breaker box. 
Circuit overload. Master bedroom.
Yeah.
Yeah. Under the right conditions, any hydrocarbon can be an accelerant.
You ever worry about professional suicide?
Where do we start?
Uh, I know -- looky-loos.
Grissom was right: You do know a lot about bombs.
Dominic, I think you should go with your attorney. Thanks for your help, though.
Gris, can I get clear on something here?
Catherine gave me this 'FP' which was part of the Hansen bomb and I'm supposed to figure out what tool the bomber used to engrave it.
Yeah, but he could've used any number of things to initial it. I mean, screwdriver, a drill bit, a box cutter.
What are you guys doing?
Oh, I definitely got the wrong end of this investigation.
Yeah. I finally matched this 'FP.' To this electric etcher. Now, I made an exemplar. Boom! Identical type of striations. The manufacturer says that this etcher is only used for training purposes. And it's only sold in bulk. It was not sold to Norman Stirling.
Las Vegas School District. I called the district, and we traced it down to one high school -- summit high. 
Stirling's son goes there.
All you guys got to go on is a bone?
Maid found dead male body in a hotel room.
Guy's 23. No. Sounds like a live one. 
Let's go.
Looks like somebody had a par-tay.
'Darren Pyne.' Dead at 23.
Looks like he was whacked over the head with this lamp.
Unless each hit was to a different part on his dome. Who's the room registered to?
Hey, O'Riley, you think ... 
Lynn Henry?
I'm Warrick Brown, and this is Sara Sidle.
We're with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
Darren Pyne was found dead in your motel room at the Lucky Seven. Did you know him?
He didn't leave when you did?
All right. We'll probably have more questions after the coroner completes his autopsy. If we need to talk to you can we reach you here?
Multiple blows to the head?
No. Just lap dances-- nothing more.
Looks like fried eggs.
What's the estimated time of death?
What?! These ladies said he was alive when they left him at 3:00 A.M.
We have forensic proof that Darren Pyne had s*x with a woman just before he died.
Hey, tell us or tell the D.A. 
So he raped you.
Was Darren alive when you left?
It's just standard procedure for sexual assault.
What do you mean, 'it doesn't add up?'
For now, yeah.
Yeah, but maybe the materials didn't adhere. Doesn't mean he wasn't hit in the head with the lamp. 
What are you looking for?
Well, if you don't know, I can't help you.
What is this?
Something-something.
Right there.
Oh, you think so, huh? 
No. Diamonds cut glass. This is some cheap-ass cubic zirconia.
Let's go ask her.
They talk faster at the sports book.
In the old days.
Yeah. Not my wedding.
What?
She lied to us.
All right, let's call homicide and tell them to meet us there. Let's put this to bed before the honeymoon.
So you only hit him once?
Does your fianc√© have a zirconia ring?
May we see it?
You were in that motel room that night, weren't you, Luke?
What happened? You got wind of the party?
Bruised up Lynn's wrists.
You did what any guy in your position would do.
But you didn't stop with one hit.
And you didn't know that you had lost a piece of your ring.
Laws don't end when you come to Vegas.
Guess I'm going deep.
Polo.
Yeah, please.
Looks like a cuff link. Initials 'C.M.'
I'm going to be wet all night.
Hi.
This is a big case. I'm in a groove here.
Whatever happened to 'you cross the tape, you go the distance'?
Great.
Detective Conroy.
No. I do my best work solo.  On the clock, that is. What you got?
All around the ten-ring, once between the eyes. Entry wound give you anything? Small caliber?
Professional hit.
Times have changed since the canary days, huh?
Yeah. Brass used to tell me, back in the day when the mob would make a hit they'd leave a canary, 'cause the guy sang.
'Call someone who cares.'
When you leave a gun, you know it's clean. The gun just traces back to itself.
All I can do -- follow protocol.
It's like the circle bar on a friday night ... three million people on top of each other.
Cool. You got an I.D. for me?
Too bad he wasn't driving that elevator. 
Ooh! Chicago bankroll.
No, that's just a term. Old school. 
'Shrimp cocktail appetizer. Surf &amp; turf dinner. Two glasses of wine. All comped.
It ain't free, believe me.
Yeah. Yeah. 
Been a long time since I seen these.
Cool.
Yeah. Will you log these for me?
Mandy, you got any prints off of that quarter I found on the vic?
It's a good idea that, when your house is robbed you report that your registered gun was stolen.
We're going to keep your name on ice for a while. Thanks for your time.
Nobody kills anybody with their registered gun anymore.
I been spinning my wheels. I'm never going to solve this case. It was over before it began.
I got a dead man in a glass elevator with a bazillion prints and a .22 caliber bullet.
And he left the gun at the scene. You know what that means.
But I got two things left, right?
You got to be kidding me.
Want to share?
I was just thinking what old man Binion told Steve Wynn when he hit town: 'Always give a gambler an excuse to gamble and he'll thank you for it.'
A bunch of cash receipts in his pocket. Markers all over town. Once you get to that place there's no getting out.
These belong to Tyson Green. Just came to let you know he won't be paying up.
Yeah.
I won't let you down again.
Where's McCall now? He's being held?
Great.
Hey, are you just going to ignore my question?
All right, here's what we know from the arresting officer: 
Two 25-year-old guys Chuckie Hastings and Roy McCall, lifelong neighbors one step up from a trailer park got into a beef over a motorcycle in the owner's backyard.
All right, now, Hastings' wife said that McCall shot Hastings in the back. 
And the coroner's report substantiates that.
Well, we would need the screwdriver with McCall's blood on it to prove that, now, wouldn't we?
I have been through all these boxes twice. It's not there.
The gun is here, but there's no screwdriver. They even have crime scene photos of it. But no tests were run on it before it was misplaced.
Right.
Yeah, the same people homicide'll blame.
Ma'am, we're not cops. We're crime scene investigators. We've come to ask you a few questions about the day that your husband was killed. Maybe acquaint ourselves with the actual crime scene.
Out back here?
What's up?
Heard the first shot and then came running out here.
McCall had a semiautomatic. I mean, you could pull off a shot in two-tenths of a second.
So she just filled in what she thought happened -- that McCall shot her husband in cold blood.
Typical eyewitness.
Well, if we had the screwdriver that someone lost 
We'd be able to check for blood.
Mr. McCall, according to your statement you went over to your neighbor Hastings' house to return his motorcycle. You got into a dispute over a wrecked fender and he attacked you with a screwdriver.
So you're saying that if he'd inflicted the wound on himself he would have stabbed his left arm.
Mr. McCall, which direction was Hastings facing when you shot him?
Defense attorneys have made a whole career off that human error.
Doc, are you sure McCall shot Hastings in the back?
This guy McCall swears that he shot him straight ahead in self-defense.
Right. 
All right, look, I'm not doubting your findings. But when guys go at it they're not like gingerbread men, you know? They're, like, bobbing and weaving. It's like W.W.F. Smackdown. You know? All of these things could have changed what went down when Hastings and McCall tangled.
No doubt. When Catherine gets here can you tell her I went over to evidence to check out the victim's t-shirt?
Yeah, but look at that gunpowder. Unburned gunpowder.
Right.
In direct contradiction to our evidence.
Yeah, right.
Hey ... when's the last time you took target practice?
Okay, so we're doing this reconstruction and the best way is to measure the distance between the victim and the assailant during the time of the altercation, right?
Right.
Circumference of the gunpowder is the same. 
Looks like two feet for shot number one ...
...and one foot for shot number two.
It can't. It's not possible.
We just disproved their statement.
The truth is somewhere in the middle. How long do we have till the prelim?
What kind of 'thing'?
This dummy cost over $500?
Why?
He's 'self-healing'?
Cool. Um, the wound track is off. Do it two centimeters higher.
Good.
Now, the second shot was fired like so. Now, the coroner says that Hastings was shot just like this, from back to front and Hastings' wife says the same thing -- that her husband was running away.
Just like I said before, guys don't go at it and fight like gingerbread men, you know?
Check it out.
What if, um ... he was lunged ...
...just kind of like this?
Oh, you are wrong!
Yeah. I'm calling the DA.
Hey, Lindsey, I got some games on my computer. You want to see?
Let's play one. 
All right. I'm McCall. I have a gun.
I push him back off.
I shoot.
And the bullet enters through the back even though we are facing each other and exits ... out the front.
Boom.
Chalk it up to adrenaline or revenge, but Hastings was already going down. There was no reason to shoot him a second time.
That's our job.
Hey, how's Linds?
Right.
Catherine, you've got to get that divorce finalized, huh?
Oh, come on, now. Don't tell me you believe in that bs.
Come on, Sara. 
Spontaneous human combustion is science fiction.
There's no such thing as a human torch.
Sara, this is a crime scene. Stay with me here, okay? Don't lose it.
What's that?
Wow. Check that out.
It's as if the fire created a chimney for itself.
Yeah, right.
Good question.
Another good question.
So do you still think it's spontaneous combustion?
Yeah.
Okay, tell me everything you can about this foot.
How do you know about Sara's theory?
No. You're just siding with Sara 'cause you got a crush on her.
So your official 'observation' is spontaneous combustion?
No, no. We're a team. The only place we're going is back down to that crime scene.
What about the husband -- is he still a suspect?
What about, uh ... life insurance policies?
I'm not the one who's reaching here. 
That would be cool, but you've been jumping to conclusions from minute one.
Well, I brought the ion detector. This will pick up even the smallest traces of hydrocarbon fumes.
I don't care what the lab says. This puppy will reveal exactly what accelerant was used to start the fire.
Nothing.
What's that?
Really? It was actually for my girlfriend here - 
Miss Piggy.
Yeah.
Well, I tried for human volunteers, but no takers.
What are we going to do? We're disproving the existence of spontaneous human combustion.
Well, we're recreating the death of Nadine Winston, right? She was wearing a cotton nightgown -- thank you -- and she had a half a pack of smokes on her end table, which means she was probably smoking a cigarette.
Best part: Toxicology sample came back. Nadine had a high concentration of seconal in her blood.
Enough to knock out a horse.
All right.
We wait.
Yeah, we're disproving spontaneous human combustion. We dressed the pig up in a cotton dress and torched it with a cigarette.
The pig's been reduced to ash. The fat acted like candle wax; burned hot, slow and intense. 
Nothing spontaneous about it.
Of course.
The what?
Well, you can show your appreciation by, uh, cleaning up.
Two victims. She's on the sidewalk, a foot from the curb and he's in the middle of the street.
No car.
Well, rain screwed up all our chances of a good DNA profile.
You see him?
Well, that's why you got the badge and I got the syringe. 
I'm casting the stab wounds. From the molds, we can identify the murder weapons.
Did you want me to give Gris a message?
Forget Shepherd's wife. I can't match the slash marks. It's all about these stab wounds. So I concentrated on Kevin Shepherd.
Cool.
Well, I measured all the sharp points of entry on Kevin's body.
They're all identical. They're all made from the same murder weapon.
Identified murder weapon number one. Now we just need that second murder weapon.
Yeah, who stabs someone with a blunt instrument?
Yeah.
So he started with Kevin and then he went after Jessica and then the tip broke off.
Oh, yeah. I got three prints on this gearshift and they are beauties.
The images are printing.
So Jessica Hall was the last person to drive the shepherds' suv.
Lucky for us the rain missed that.
Who else had a flowing wound?
Man, why are you always trying to put me down?
All right, I'm bleeding from my abdomen.
Why would she do that?
By the positioning of her wound, I'd say it looked like her stabbing was an accident.
No. 
He just said check his clothes. Drying room. Six years in the job and it still freaks me out in here.
Yeah.
Here we go. Here we go. Justin Green. The eyewitness.
Here's another thing the rain ruined -- the blood pattern on Justin's jacket.
That looks like a handprint.
Right hand. Justin's?
So, it's not Justin's.
Holding down Kevin's feet.
So, whose handprint is that?
Yeah, but Kevin grabbed Justin's shirt so that means he was still breathing.
Whew. Curveball.
From?
Yes, that's affirmative. I can trump that. Wednesday, 3:00 P.M. Justin called Amy Shepherd.
I'm all over it like a cheap suit.
You see this spiderweb?
I'm sorry. Your ticker okay?
Right here.
Kind of hard to get a baby out of a window climb onto a ladder without messing up this web, don't you think?
What you got?
Ah. The plot thickens.
I smell these dirty diapers over here.
Probably used to clean that diaper pail.
Baby was killed before it even left the house. Guy tried to cover his tracks.
Yeah, this mold I made of that shoe print matches the gardener's boot that I found in the shed over there.
And a gardener's boot in a garden is not out of place. Well, the Andersons did say the guy's been out of town on vacation for the last three days.
Get those dogs back. Get them back!
Hey.
I got the hair samples from the baby's crib ready for comparison.
Well, DNA's jammed. Sanders says he'll get to the blood comparisons ...
... as soon as ...
I thought I'd deliver this in person. DNA came back on the entire family.
Okay, this is the 911 call from the Anderson house at 4:30 A.M.
You wouldn't think so but I went ahead and separated out any underlying voices.
She was standing, like, two meters from the phone.
I know, so I checked to see if she was, like, faking her concern. This program measures the stress level of the speakers.
The stress is real.
A little.
Well, I did backtrack and there were no other calls that night from the Anderson house-- from the land line, or from the cell phone.
Yeah. All right, I'll get into it.
I was just coming to meet you guys. I thought you were at the Andersons.
What?
Guys, the mother didn't do it.
Listen.
People walk every day because of you.
Yeah.
No. I'm having a block party. I marked it where I found it -- over on the sidewalk over there.
So, Brian takes a walk crosses the street, doesn't hear the car, gets creamed.
You know what that means -- smackdown -- the kid was in a fight.
Was he having any difficulties?
Dr. Gilbert, we're just following protocol. We need to speak with Brian's friends; his roommates. 
But we're here now, and evidence is time-sensitive.
Hey.
Yeah, we didn't have a warrant, so she kicked us out.
She was kind of hostile.
The roommate's here.
Do you know what Grissom drinks when he goes out at night?
Exactly. Who knows anything about that guy? Hey, check that out. 
Brain printing. They call it a visual polygraph.
Yeah, back in '97 Grissom and I used one to interview this rapist. The guy was mute but his brain waves spoke loud and clear.
... then the oscillator will give him away.
Those the tire treads from the crime scene?
Any hits?
Yeah.
Checking out the dead guy's clothes.
Whoa. What are these?
They look like lice.
Wasn't our dead guy clean?
Well, he was in a fight, right? Maybe his attacker had lice and they crawled off on his sweater and they got comfy and the stray hair blew away.
You know anything about lice?
Little problem no one talks about, huh?
Yeah. Right behind you.
Why? What did you do? Let me guess. You ran a DNA profile on the blood from the dead guy's knuckles and you got a match.
You made it out of bed and you dressed yourself?
So what does that give us?
So the guy's a glow-stick. How does that help us track him down?
A suspect?
Hmm.
Creepy critters in the driver's seat.
You just don't like other women in his life.
Affirmative on the head lice.
Adam Walkey doesn't have lice?
Same as the blood we found on Brian's knuckle.
It's just like Dr. Gilbert said ... the killer came from out here.
That's the muffler. And this is the back of the car.
There's no way this car was moving forward when it ran over Brian Clemonds' body.
All right, Guy?
Look at those wounds.
Yeah. From what I hear they carved out a piece of this valley when they made the park. 
Some mountain lion probably didn't like getting relocated. Mountain lions are brutal.
So, Doc, how big of a cat are we actually dealing with here?
Yeah, but I bet Grissom did.
This sucks! 
But it's evidence, right?
Yeah, it's somebody's 'doody'.
How do you figure that?
Seminar?
Julie. Oh ... a CSI should not be that fine.
What is that?
Yeah, well, I'm taking it into evidence.
Yeah, well ... we'll see.
Only thirty more jars to go. 
This is rough, man. We should be pulling better cases by now. Millionaire murders, casino heists.
Uh, we're supposed to like scat patrol?
Yeah. 
Just coming to see you. You remember that ice we found at the crime scene?
It didn't melt. It evaporated.
The jogger was missing some organs.
It just so happens the dog's owner is a doctor.
Yeah.
Gris, can I show you something?
Surgery equipment. 'Emory Medical Supplies, Boston, Mass., 1875.' 
Antiques.
Exactly. What I find interesting is that she keeps them near the door, not in the office. In case she needs to break out and go do some work.
She gives me the willies.
Yeah, well, maybe we can link these to the crime. Her dog may have eaten that jogger but he can't harvest the organs.
Yeah. You want to hand me those filter papers right there?
So we got the right dog. Well, let's see if the owner cut the vic up. 
Reactive agents. One part leuko-malachite. 
One part hydrogen peroxide -- used by blondes everywhere. 
Blue.
What's that?
... turns the swab blue.
If the jogger's blood is in any of this stuff, we need to find it now.
I'm ready, Nick. You want to hit the lights?
Why would she do that?
I'd place a bet on it.
Mr. Moore.
I think James called me tonight because he thought I could help him.
James is all right but, uh, there was a big brawl at the detention center. James was at the wrong place at the wrong time.
If he talks, he'll be dead inside a month. Now, if he keeps quiet, the D.A. will put the squeeze on him. He'll probably end up in the big house you could lose your boy forever then.
He probably knew what your advice would be. To do the honorable thing.
Not without a price. Look, a crime occurred. CSI's got full jurisdiction. I got myself assigned to the case. I'll see if I can take James out of the middle.
Why don't you tell me?
That's a lot of education in a short time, huh?
James, why don't you take a deep breath and tell me what happened here.
Whose 'side' I'm on? Who reached out to you, man?
James, I'm trying to help you.
So it's your life versus time.
Nothing surprises me anymore.
Step back for Warrick.
Whew!
Whew!
Impressive.
Yeah. Son of a bitch was crafty -- I'll give him that. Melted the end of the toothbrush to insert the razor blade.
Concealment.
Yeah. Now all I got to do is put this shank in someone's hand.
Where's his attorney?
Where's your lawyer?
How's your plaque?
Your teeth. I mean, how many toothbrushes does a guy need? 
Apparently, for you it's as many as it takes to make the perfect shank.
Yeah.
The evidence will testify for you. Ronnie Connors ... bought a toothbrush and some rubber bands at the commissary. He didn't know it but that's the last shank he'll ever make.
Before he made the shank he shaved with the same razor. His DNA was all over the blade.
It's not me you have to thank.
I thought you said we were grabbing a beer.
Grissom, you know, this is your thing. 
Cleanses me? 
Whatever happened to my evaluation?
Oh, yes!
Peeping toms to murderers?
Nobody move. 
Mr. Clean needs a maid. I'm going to take this back to the lab.
What's up?
And you got a match microscopically but it doesn't mean a damn thing
Whoa, whoa, whoa. A girl defending herself against a guy is going to pull that hair out by the roots. 
I mean, you get scalp skin filled with DNA.
... shed?
Mine.
Shedding. He's trying to throw us off. What he doesn't realize, we got no DNA on the hairs so we can't chase down his other suspect.
Is there's no one you can appeal to?
Come on, this guy's on the loose and there's nothing you can do?
I got Audrey Hayes, but those fibers we found in the Snow lady's throat aren't going to give us anything. White cotton fibers are like oxygen -- they're everywhere ...
'If you can't prove uniqueness, prove abundance.'
Yeah.
Well, I went back Audrey Hayes' apartment and I paid particular attention to the point of entry. I found a small persistence of white cotton fibers.
Well, I remember what you said about signature guys and how they have low self-esteem. They're always going to the gym to work out so I'm thinking gym towels.
So ... I went back to see if any of them had tried out introductory offers.
But you do have to sign in. 
All three women went to Strong's Gym once in the last three months. So, I'm going back there, grab some towels bring them back to the lab see if I can get a match from the crime scene fibers.
Will do.
Aw, that's cool. We don't need props. At the end of the day, we know what time it is. 
Right behind you.
Yeah. Picture that.
I know.
Too many. One thing I can't stand is a punk coward.
You want me to take this case alone?
Oh, I'm fine. I'm ... I'm looking after you. 
It's made me think of who I am to my partners, you know?
You keep on busting on me, you won't see any kind of leaf.
Vehicle's humming down Rochester. The vic was on her scooter, heading eastbound. Car brakes here ...
... impact here. The vic was thrown -- what-- twenty meters?
Yeah.
Looks like a 'four' and a 'J.'
Not like he left us any evidence.
I'll get them to cross-check this partial within a five-mile radius see how many hits they come up with. You'll have those pictures for me?
All right.
We believe it may have been involved in a traffic collision earlier this evening.
You're going to be charged with manslaughter, Mr. Moore. Felony hit-and-run. Do you have a lawyer?
Catherine, I just got off the phone with the traffic guys. They've impounded Moore's car. Should be here any minute.
Old guy was scared.
Our car's here.
How tall you do you think Mr. Moore is?
Old people must love hugging that steering wheel 'cause this seat is pushed all the way forward.
Oh!
Oh ... well, I'm six feet and this mirror isn't helping me at all.
Why?
Whoo!
This?
It's good stuff.
Yeah.
Does anybody else drive your car, Mr. Moore?
So, James you like Mos Def?
James you want to add anything to that?
Will you please escort Mr. Moore back to his cell?
Like I know my middle name. Well, let's go back to the car and find the proof.
What?
And what-- forget about little Renda Harris?
Hey, you don't think I'm feeling this? But we got to follow the evidence even if we don't like where it takes us.  It's the job.
Hey, we start making deals with the devil and you don't get to walk away. You understand what I'm saying?
What you got?
My Aunt Bertha could tell, and she's legally blind.
A forensic investigation, sir.
James ... you have a chipped tooth? Must be an incisor, or we would have noticed.
Hey... why don't you run on home? I'll handle this.
Your daughter gets out of school in a half hour, right?  Why do you want to pick a fight with me now?
Don't think I won't collect.
Hold on. James ... the first couple days are going to be the toughest. Here. 
Here's my cell number. You run into any problems you call me. I'll be right there. All right? Keep your head up.
'My day.'  Reminds me of my grandmother. Yeah, I gave her a lot of rough nights, too. She used to call me her 'work in progress.'
Maybe.
I got a court date ... straight off of graveyard. It sucks.
Well, evidence vault opens in five. 
Hey, Judge. What's going on? I'm due in your court.
Well, nobody told me.
Judge, I thought we were even. How much longer am I under your thumb?
Damn. I knew you were in tight.
Just like that? 
We got a slam dunk on a three-time rapist and he's just going to walk?
I'm already on probation.
Yeah, I feel you back there, believe me.
I need to see the Henderson Rape case 4217.
Thanks, Mike.
Uh, damn case was continued. Clerk never called.
Nature of the beast.
Party?
More money, more problems.
Thanks.
I appreciate it.
Hey, Grissom.  You got a second? Uh, I'm in purgatory. Need some guidance.
Judge ... Warrick. Listen, uh, I got a little problem. No, I can't talk about it over the phone. We got to meet in person. There's something in the evidence I think you should see. Good.
Let me guess. Radiohead or Rage against the machine.
Right.
Oh, he's working that Wendy Barger case -- you know, the floater?
Only clue he's got is a missing boat which sucks, 'cause ... it's missing.
It's a simulation tank. He's re-creating the conditions the night she died. Body was dumped, like, a half mile from Calville Bay. They think the boat must have drifted with the currents.
Well, you know Grissom. Shortest distance between two points is science. And for Catherine, it's pounding the pavement.
Yeah. Something came up. See you.
I need some assurances.
I checked out the evidence, yeah. But I'm not sure about the rest.
Why don't you let me do that?
I told you ... nobody owns me.
Hey. 
Hey, Cath.
Yeah. Fine. Thanks for letting Brass handle it.
Yeah. That's what I'm afraid of.
Yeah, I know.
It's a long way out in the sticks just to drop dead.
He was looking over his shoulder when he was running. Think there was somebody else here?
Can I get this taped off here?
So you want to call it? How do you think he died?
Cool.
Can't make a ruling? Look at the bruise marks on John Doe here. I call that suffocation.
I'm going to take a mouth swab.
What the maggots?
Entomology is our friend.
Sorry, little buddy. 
Scalpel.
Talk about pulp fiction. 
It's all yours, doc. 
Fire up that gas chromatograph mass spectrometer thing, will you?
Cool.
No, I'm off that. 
I haven't made a bet in a month. I can't say I don't have that itch, though.
Hey, boss, I got something for you. 
I did the whole tox-the-maggots thing like you said. Found jimsonweed in their blood.
Jimsonweed in Eric's blood.
Really? Cite your sources.
I thought Brass just said that they weren't doing any drugs.
Yeah.
Fruit juice, half ice.
Or legal, for that matter.
Did you take the drug, too?
Did you get a stamp when you got in?
Well, mostly they use water-resistant pads so you don't sweat it off. Could you hit the lights, Gris?
Where did they stamp you? 
Yeah, that's DJ Masterband's stamp. He is the spinner in Vegas right now. Must have been playing at the rave these two were at.
The free papers, yeah. They have ads for all sorts of raves.
Gris, I got the prelims back on that swab I took off of our desert guy. Products trapped in nasal hairs.
Products found in mouth and nose: Mentholated nose spray, patchouli and aluminum.
Patchouli -- they burn it at music stores.
Yeah. I got trace putting together a list of products made with the stuff. Something tells me that's not lemonade.
Doesn't look like tea, either.
What's that?
Does that apply to our case?
Cheers.
Who?
It's ecstasy. It makes everyone fall in love. 
Don't take it personally, miss. He's kind of married to his job.
Come on. Let's go.
Now we just tie that to the dealer.
That's not what you were saying out at that rave all up in that guy's face.
The chemical compositions break down exactly the same.
Square one.
Thought I'd find you here.
Evidence ... a double-edged sword. 
How do you feel about this?
You don't really believe that, do you?
Dead.
I'll catch you later.
Hey, guys. This came back for the test on aluminum products from our kid in the desert.  Fireworks.
But you guys have never taken j-weed before so you weren't aware of the side effects of photophobia.
Photophobia. It's just a big word for lights freaking you out. You guys were hallucinating and whatever Eric was seeing was scaring him, big-time.
The coroner states that Eric's dose shot his temperature through the roof. He was boiling in his own skin. So he stripped which is why we found him naked.
We found traces of aluminum trapped in Eric's nostrils that are consistent with what we found in your client's hands and arms earlier today from his job at the fireworks plant.
Where you going?
I'll take a piece of that.
Will do. 
Picture that.
Officer Tyner.
Want to tell us what happened here tonight?
Why don't you tell us what happened here.
Officer, we're going to need your weapon, as well.
It's just standard procedure.
Were there any witnesses?
We're going to need to seal off this lot.
The officer told me a fleeing suspect committed suicide. I'm just verifying his account. You know how this works, Brass. Can we clear the jeep so I can do my job?
Can we get back to work?
Why would a guy speed it all the way down the strip just to pull over and cap himself?
Officer's weapon: Smith and Wesson 5906.
One bullet missing. Nothing standard about that.
I don't give a damn what Brass likes.
Yeah, it's war.
Can anyone confirm your story?
Do you? 
We're just having a talk with Officer Tyner here.
Five civilian complaints -- three for excessive force. Two I.A. investigations.
I'm sure you were.
I guess it's a good thing I sealed off that crime scene.
Bullets just don't disappear.
Have you talked to the police?
We're Crime Scene Investigators. We need to know what you saw.
And, just like that, the officer fired?
What thing?
Oh, good. Um ... we just put some stuff through the lab.
I was just about to.
If you want me to suave anyone, I got to know the shot.
She's trying to tell you Eddie likes it rough.
That's how you think I work?
What's he doing here?
Oh, you mean dealing with punk-ass cops who hide behind their union reps?
You're just a psycho! You don't deserve a badge!
It's not in the body. It's not at the crime scene. I like our odds.
Yeah. We've searched every piece of metal. 
Spare tire.
The tire sucked up the bullet and the treads covered its tracks.
There's a match.
We got Tyner. One bad cop going down.
So, check it out ... the laser is the path of the bullet. If you were Officer Tyner and you approached the suspect from the driver's side of the vehicle ... 
The laws of physics trump the eye witness. There's only one way this could've gone down.
Officer Tyner was telling the truth.
We work. We get paid. You don't owe me anything.
Media have it right? Four dead?
You got it.
I checked the sprinkler system. It goes off every night at zero-two hundred .
So somebody came out of the house and got on what looks to be a step down from a motorcycle and drove it across the lawn.
How's that hand?
I saw you beating up the door a little while ago. You all right?
Damn!
You need to tell somebody when you're cutting the lights.
Grissom, you remember those tire treads ... I found on the front lawn?
Well, I ran them through the FBI register and they belong to a '93
I DMV'd it. A kid four blocks away from the scene owns the same make.
I might have just blown open the case and all you give me is a 'that's very good'?
Yeah.
Lady Macbeth?
The tire treads from the scooter place you at the scene of the murders.
Tina's parents? So you know Tina Collins?
You mean sexually?
Where's your scooter now?
We got about four just on the tire prints alone. Homicide's grabbing them up.
Let me take a look.
I see.
Well, if you believe what you hear in the halls - Ecklie.
I'm with you there.
Just taking a little coffee break.
Same guy?
Oh, me and him, working together? Oh, it's on.
Everyone still breathing in that car?
Where's the driver? He get thrown?
You calling it?
How you know it's from the car?
After you ...
More like 80.
Who?
So your drunk driver just got out and ran away?
Where to?
Then how do you explain car number two?
Not if we have these. 
They're kind of out of place. A walking stride up to the edge.
No. This is a crime, not an accident.
How much?
I don't get out of bed for less than a bill.
Tan lines, no watch and no ring.
Must have been one hell of a fall to knock his watch and his ring off ... 
... and take his money. 
So what do you say? Do you want to up the stakes another hundred? 
Say my foul play against your phantom driver?
Supergluing the entire car? It's a little excessive, don't you think?
You know, I checked with six different medical centers, and no phantom driver at any of them.
Las Vegas cell phone. PD's putting a name to it.
What's all this?
To ... ?
Makes sense.
You find his watch and ring?
my pockets are getting fat!
God, you see all that money in there?
Yeah.
What's the mysterious news?
What do you think?
So ... who's your phantom driver?
Man, it's a rental. Those prints are probably older than you are.
You giving up?
You want to take it to three?
Tan lines where his ring and watch used to be. On vacation in Vegas, but no money in his wallet. His face all bruised up before he took that cliffside tumble. Damn right, I think he was robbed.
I don't think the robber expected Banglor to get drunk and go crash his car. He probably freaked and put him in the back seat trying to fool me into thinking someone else was driving. But he only fooled you.
What about it?
Maybe. There's other questions to answer first.
Footprints and tire tracks.
You love me. Who you kidding?
Finally.
Size 11.
I needed to be sure.
You want me to clack that jaw, make you go nigh-nigh?
Pirelli low profile p-zeros. High performance.
Any reported stolen?
Check this. One-to-one says that's the car.
You got his clothes?
What are you doing? His laundry?
Ah.
What's that?
Banglor shooting stick -- I'll give you that. Burping bourbons --
... Bentley thief flags him down ... 
... spooks him into a skid ... boom, crash! 
He's robbed ... forced into the back ... pushed over the edge. 
With Banglor out of the way, the thief gets in his stolen Bentley ... hightails it out of there. No watch ... no rings, no cash ... stolen Bentley tire treads, converse all-star size 11 ... all bases covered. Victim, suspect, crime scene. Like a canary ... it sings.
I was sitting here thinking the same thing about your phantom driver.
Yeah. 
I'm Warrick ... NICK: I'm Nick ...
Actually, sir, I-I don't think it was an accident. I think you were robbed and any information that you remember about your attacker would be very helpful.
You mean you got hustled?
So buckling up ... really did save your life. You know that?
You get well, okay?
And the Bentley thief, size 11-- he could've been at that crime scene anytime last week. So we push on the bet? No winner?
You're talking to the wrong guy.
What do we know about the dead guy?
All this damage by one guy? Had to be on drugs.
Yeah.
Nice snow job.
What guy?
Well, alcohol does different things to different people ... at different altitudes.
And where was your husband?
Right. Where were you?
This is incredible. Ten people and no one's talking. My theory: The killer is in the group and the rest of them are afraid.
It all comes down to shoeprints.
Mr. Cash.
So, what did you see?
Sitting ringside, how do you not see what happened?
That's Lou.
Max.
That's Nate.
We need you to tell us everything you heard from the time the deceased banged on the cockpit door to the time he died.
Mile high club.
The stewardess.
Yeah, whatever. You're henpecked anyway.
Now, Lou, in 4B, said he was the peacemaker.
A CD swipe across the chops.
Yeah, go ahead, honey. Save my life.
Saved Nick's butt, as usual.
And, according to Preston, Max and Lou they got to Candlewell first.
He's messing with my man, so I get my licks in.
But they didn't let him.
Let it go, guys.
It's out of our hands. Our field ruling was overturned by the good old Sheriff and the Feds.
Oh, you think this is about justice?
I'm not discounting it. I mean, think about it -- is there anyplace more vulnerable than being at thirty thousand feet in a tin can?
Because their lives were threatened.
Human nature again. I mean, adrenaline doesn't come with an off switch.
If it was between him or me, I could. Nick?
See? We have four people here, all with different opinions. Think of how the passengers must have felt.
Well, if that's your stance how could it have been prevented?
A heroin addict's confetti. Nothing like going on a binge.
Black tar heroin. This is the difference between a Cadillac and a Pinto.
It's my job.  I count at least six balloons, and that's just in the bedroom. The dealer must have come down the chimney. It's like Christmas in July here.
Not that Braun even needed any more drugs.
I can get a print off the air.
Have you seen Brass?
Oh. 'Print off air.' Orange balloon. Cyanoacrylate. Dead bang, drug dealer.
You're Braun's grocery store.
Xanax?
Okay, three rolls of tape found in the truck owned by Curt Ritten.
No match!
'Cause he was smart. In the past 20 years the value of silver's gone to nothing and a commodity broker's going to charge you a storage fee per troy ounce and there's only one thing worse than losing seven to eight percent on silver a year and that's losing nine to ten percent because of some stupid storage fee.
Depends on who's doing the clipping.
Oh, we got a positive association. Roll to tape. Curt to Tony.
How can this be, Mandy? We found the duct tape in the guy's truck.
This thing must have a virus.
Well, that's easy for you to say. All you do is scan prints all day and hit 'enter.'
See what I mean?
Bet Walt wasn't too happy about that. It's 50-50 going 75-25 the wrong way.
'A' slash? Acting supervisor? What about Nick? He's got seniority. Or Sara -- she'd jump at the chance.
And if I ask why?
Hang on! Have you told NICK and SARA about this?
Hey.
Yeah, I'm sorry, I got detained. I guess you did a 'one-to-one' on these treads already?
Put together an evidence list?
You've got to do it.
Ah, I don't think so. I got to go back with the body. Sara, can you get back to the lab and put a rush on this analysis?
He's not exactly dead.
Anything you want to say?
Side roads. So ... this is our con artist?
Did it tell you anything?
Well. Probably when he was getting into the car.
He knew the driver.
You got any pictures of that?
Whoa.
Can you fish that out for me?
Wait a minute. 
There's something in his stomach.
How many more are there?
He's a mule. Why is a guy trafficking in big-pay drugs wasting his time on some nickel-and-dime chip scam?
It's great if you're a mule transporting drugs into the states.
We found balloons of cocaine in his stomach cavity.
Then he went out and got shot.
What?
No, what's strange is going into the evidence locker after post and not finding anything left.
If it was your job, you couldn't feel bad.
It's my case. Tonight, I'm the primary. I have to process it. If you have a problem with that, you can clock out now. Am I clear?
It couldn't be.
Hey.
You have a daughter?
Her prints came up on airline stubs relating to tonight's homicide.
Ellie Rebecca Brass. DOB 9/24/82. Essex County, New Jersey. Last known address 554 Applegate Way.
Well, I've got to bring her in. You know that.
You're hands off.
Just go right in here.
Excuse me?
Yeah.
It's a dummy chip. No casino logo.
So, you two fly down to Baja, pose as a married couple brought back home a stomach load of blow and then you run chip scams? Who's taking your drug profits?
Yeah, she was passing pellets of cocaine.
With your permission, we need to take some x-rays.
And what is his name?
His name.
You were behind the glass. This evidence against your daughter doesn't look good.
She mules drugs for a guy who ends up dead ten hours later? A BS chip scam, a lousy alibi?
Brass. It's a big city. Boyfriend could disappear. But, hey, it's your kid.
So you gave up your drugs to your boss, huh?
Do you realize every time you ingest one of those pellets that you risk dying from an overdose?
So you can just not eat?
I don't think I can handle this. I got to call Grissom.
But?
I heard it, bro -- a 'but' in there.
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
Sack up.
Treasury department?
Counterfeit?
What money?
On a federal case?
Hold up. I'm dealing with something.
Well, I'm not Grissom!
Sara, brief Special Agent Beckman on the funny money. Nick, the garage.
Proves one thing. This was the getaway car used in the murder.
We printed the vehicle your client was found driving. It puts the car at the scene of Vincent Avery's murder less than twelve hours ago.
Bought tickets for Victor Avery as well.
Vega?
We got bad news from the garage.
The tire evidence puts Ellie's car at the murder scene. We'll be pressing charges, murder of Vincent Avery.
Maybe so, but we don't have Driscoll.
Vega had to turn him loose after your gun episode.
That's what you cops think.
Grissom's office. CSI ... Warrick speaking.
Officer-involved shooting? Who?
Excuse me?
Ecklie, you're day shift. And you're here because ... 
Yeah, picture that.
What the hell happened?
There's one round missing.
Fifteen bullets left in brass's gun. There should be sixteen.
Hey. Look where I just located this blood? Back of the grip.
Slide bite. Man, Brass didn't shoot this guy.
I need you to show me your hands.
Your hands, Captain.
I'm going to need to take your badge.
Detective Vega.
They're nothing alike.
What, is she adopted?
What about the blood on Brass's gun?
Not Ellie's? 
With a pinch on his hand. All right. Where's that manifest?
Vincent Avery ...
Two-zero-three-four ... two-zero-three-four...
Marty Gillmore.
Game's over, Marty.
You know this guy?
You conned the captain. I got to shake your hand.
No, on the real.
You shot Driscoll ... ...with his firearm.
So you off'ed Driscoll to take over his drug op. What about Ellie?
You eat something?
Oh, god, he's going to OD. Can we get a medic?
Can we get a medic?
Brass?!
Brass. Hang on. 
I only took it to get Ellie's DNA off of it. That's it. 
We were checking out the blood from your gun. We compared your DNA to her DNA.
You never said anything about her being adopted.
Hey, Sara.
Hey ... I'm a little short on cash. Can you loan me a hundred?
Hey, Griss. How'd it go?
Well, the job is fine. It's the other stuff -- the personalities. 
Is that Einstein?
Charlie Brown. Figures. Is that why you put me in charge?
Yeah, you said 'A Ghost'. 
From the top?
I don't know where to start. It was wild.
Hey, Cath... are you on this Fairmont case?
You know the Fairmont house was one of my first calls three years ago?
Shots fired. He shot himself while he was cleaning his gun.
Yeah. And after hearing about tonight I'm wondering if that's what really happened. I'm going to pull his file and check it out.
I will.
In this reinactment, Fairmont shot himself while cleaning his gun? In this reenactment the story just doesn't add up. I think I fell for it because I was new and I wasn't too eager to talk to another guy about him almost shooting off his manhood. 
This is the room as it was then based off of my crime scene photos. This is crime scene reconstruction, new school. Works backward, reverse time. 
The bullet hit here.
The only logical place for that bullet to have been shot from is four meters away, one meter high. He didn't actually shoot himself. Someone shot him.
I'm presenting this case to the D.A., even if it is three years old.
I already did. 28 years old, blonde, blue eyes, 125 pounds, five-six ... sound familiar? 
Uniform's talking to a neighbor. Donna is Joan's older sister.
Genetics. House belonged to their mother. Donna's lived here alone since their mother died. Joan lived in Henderson. The real action's around back.
If the highway was the dump site, this is the primary.
No doubt. I'm going to collect the glass. And then I'll start with the doorframe.
You're the puzzle guy.
So the side that kissed up to the tin will fluoresce under UV.
I got some imprints on these blood spots here. 
Looks like the killer may have stepped in Donna's blood.
Hmm. That would place Joan at the house.
Hey.
Still putting it together. I'm just doing a trace on Donna Marks' clothing and I came across this fiber. Look at this cross section.
Yeah, short and coarse. Car upholstery?
Well, it's from black upholstery. What color was the boyfriend's missing thunderbird?
Really? What about the blood from Joan Marks' shoe?
Hey. Point of impact. It's, uh ...  ... sixty-... five inches from the base.
Well, Donna was five-six. If she was thrown through that glass, the point of impact would've been lower closer to the ground.
Are you saying it was an accident?
Thanks.
Hey. Is it true? Millander?
Yeah, what's up with that?
Well, I got some mud prints. Check these out.
He must've taken off his boots before he stepped in. 
Check out the depth of the impression compared to mine.
Shoot it.
Who flagged it?
Yeah, but how would Millander know that the guy who'd pick him up had a birthday August 17, 1957?
I found some G.S.R.
That's why Grissom didn't find a bullet.
It went out the window.
I'm going to call Nick, tell him we found out what that unidentified whir sound was -- the window going down.
We were thinking Millander posed as a hitchhiker overpowered Walker, and then faked a gunshot in the car.
No, he carried him into the warehouse.
Drives the same route all the time?
Maybe he wanted to confess. Take her to the body.
So what do we do now?
So, who's worth one mil?
State troopers just spotted Logan's car on the 582. Drove past him earlier this morning. Five minutes later, drove past him again other direction.
Looks like some kind of glow paint stick. I think Catherine dragged her heels a little bit here.
You mean like helium for balloons? You can also use it to change the pitch in your voice.
Then why hasn't Catherine contacted us yet?
She ate, but she didn't fall asleep till way late. We had her helping Greggo out in the lab.
Yeah.
Watch your step.
All right.
Looks more like a slice. Could've happened when he cut through her finger.
Does this look like blood to you?
Yeah.
With what?
Great.
Hey, Nick?
Have you been eating peanut butter in the layout room?
Well, we found it on the back of that shower curtain.
I need to take my car to this detailer. Not bad.
Two problems. His wife is going to leave him, take half his money and he was going to jail.
He knew he'd get hauled in to the cops.
So, he left these wine glasses for you to find.
A million dollars. Pretty tempting.
He didn't. He probably thought the bank marked it.
I hear Grissom goes there all the time. Like even on his nights off.
Oh, that's so not cool. That's a community fridge.
Way to go, Nick. You really told him.
Yeah.
That's it.
You think? Neighbor called it in. She smelled the smoke. Thought he was barbecuing in his living room.
Over there talking to Brass.
What up, doc? Oh, there you are.
Oh, it's all good. I'm just starting my walk-through.
There's a burn pattern for you. Fire burns upward. This is moving downward.
Check out the upstairs?
How do you know it's a guy? Why are you jumping the gun?
Yeah, that sounds like Sara.
It's the point of origin.
I don't smell any accelerant.
I don't know. It doesn't make any sense. A fire burning downward?
Furniture polish.
Oh, man. Something bad happened here.
Yeah?
A thousand points of light and I only need one to clear up this picture. The blur equals the length of the light. 
If I can compress this light back into a point then the rest of the picture gets clear. That's how they got Hinkley's image when he was shooting the prez.
Yeah, I think so.
Maybe his good hand was otherwise engaged. I'm going to work on that for a while and see if I can get some ridge detail. Maybe even a fat print.
There you are. I got something for you from trace.
Sara?
They isolated the accelerant used in the fire. It's alcohol based. 
Guess that's the six percent no one talks about. Female fire starters.
Greg, this is an abuse case involving a minor.
I'm still trying to enhance it. It's kind of frustrating, that, uh this picture puts us at the very moment of the crime but we can't see what she's seeing.
Yeah, my grandma used to say that all the time.
Well, maybe ... if I enhanced the reflection in her eye with the right combination of algorithms ...
Hey.
Back burner. I've been working on this reflection in her eye. You see what I'm seeing?
Come on, man. I've been working on this enhancement all night. Look closer.
Yeah. These pictures were taken on a boat.
Miss Bradley.
Warrick Brown. Your fianc√©, Mike, did he own a boat?
No? Did he borrow one or rent one?
Your ex-husband owned a boat?
Okay. Thank you.
Catherine.
Found it on the boat. DNA just ran it. She's under 14, right?
Whoo! There's a winner.
Yeah, after somebody wiped them down. Paramedics?
Just pronounced? 
He tied himself off.
All the signs of an O.D ... without any of the paraphernalia.
Coltrane, huh?
See if I can get this back to Gregor at the lab. He could tell us what we're dealing with. Two coasters, one glass?
Forgot this on the way out.
Whoa, whoa ... miss, you can't come in here.
I'm sorry, he's dead.
Miss ... why don't we step outside for a minute?
Potential killer?
Don't tell us you're wearing our evidence.
Mannitol-- that's that baby laxative used to cut heroin with.
91%? No wonder the guy O.D.'D. That's a death sentence.
Unless you're looking to kill someone.
Yeah, that victim was out of L.A. and I don't think the singer, Lillie met him before last night, so she may be in the clear.
: Right ... like you're going to take dumpster duty alone.
Man, I don't even know if I'm going there the odds haven't gone my way in a long time.
Same difference.
We're just doing our jobs here.
We won't know till we print you.
Well, that's fine. That's not the issue. You tampered with the evidence.
Could have lost your job.
So, you cleaned him up, threw away his works ... why Lillie's scarf?
Lillie's scarf was there?
Really? You mind rolling up your sleeves for us?
Thanks.
I don't like playing in front of an audience.
No, I just came by to ask you a few questions and I got a little carried away.
So, um, how well do you know these people you play with?
I thought I was the one asking questions here.
Warrick Brown.
So, that's what you're all about?
Then run.
Sounds like you're pretty dependent on him.
Great.
I don't know about all that.
I already do make a difference.
You do.
So ... knock 'em dead.
You're here.
New lead. The bartender. Purple.
Test for opiates.
Purple. You know what that means.
He sandwiched the drugs between the coasters. That's how he hid it. He was dealing from behind the bar.
When we found those two coasters in Stan Grevey's dressing room, we assumed that there was two people -- either a user or supplier. There weren't. Just our guy -- the victim.
What's wrong? 
What do you mean?
Yeah?
So what? There could be a hundred reasons why she ...
We got the dealer -- the bartender. Let's just take him out.
: What about her? Why don't you ... Why don't you just let me handle my business.
We know he's not the only guy you dealt it to.
Bad batch?
No.
I'm going to meet Lillie. I'll see you back at the lab. Okay? You don't know me.
You hiding from me?
Yeah.  I wanted to talk to you.
Yeah, you're right.
I'm sorry, Lillie. Life's too short. Good-bye.
What are you doing here?
Relax. They said it'd be here.
Well, that's why we have computer tracking. Fourteen ... it was fifteen, right?
Stephanie Watson, right?
Yeah? We all have a past, huh?
What exactly are we looking for?
Well, I'd start with this.
Hey.
Here's the good news. Look at his hands. The cut on his left index finger -- it's just like the evidence log says.
Kelso's glove is not in any of the crime scene photos, any of the sketches, anywhere.
You see who logged it in?
Want me to tag along?
Kelso's glove -- embedded in the fabric-- dog hair. I isolated motor oil on the thumb and the rest of the stains were bloodstains. Kelso's, just like in the report.
You'd think, but you kind of put me on a wild snipe hunt so I tested for all biologicals, and I ran amylase and I found saliva.
Yeah.
Also amylase.
Results on Jimmy Tadero's sample. I just got it back from DNA.
Not going to take a look at it?
You want me to open it?
We're not running the show.
All right.
Cadets?
Let's roll.
There's no doubt that this bus body-checked this k-rail.
You've got that 'Sara' look.
I got a theory. Grissom said the suspension gave on the bus, right? Broken rod arm.
Well, I'm thinking when that rod arm hit the pavement it made this great first impression here.
Crosses the highway slams into the k-rail.
Bus bounces off this k-rail ... 
... heads back towards us.
Yeah. Someone upstairs was looking out big-time.
Check this out.
Well, this one's sheared.
Three-quarter inch bolt. It matches the bolt on the specs for this suspension system. The hex head says it's a grade eight.
No, the bolts snapped midway through the skid after the bus hit the k-rail.
And the Camaro's skid marks place it behind the bus.
Until last night.
We have more questions about the accident but one thing we know: the suspension didn't hold.
We only care about the bolts.
The consequences of saving a buck.
Oh, that's original. What happened to slashing tires?
Right.
You know we need to document this for the journal of forensic science, right?
Yeah, this is the rear trailing tire of the crash bus. It has the same maintenance record as the tire that blew.
Gravity, huh?
Yeah. You used your left hand to prop yourself up. The perp may have done the same.
Warrick. Okay.  I'll be there.
Sara. She's at the print lab.  She needs me.
Checkmate.
So, why are you paging me?
Oh ... so he can drive a vehicle with over ten passengers.
Mm-hmm?
Well, I guess I'll grab a uniform and pay Mr. Maddox another visit.
Well, we're still going to need those maintenance records.
Thank you.
Sean Nolan was fired two months ago. Maddox says he's working in Barstow and since then three of Maddox's buses had blowouts. They all went through Barstow.
Yeah, only last night's bus had been serviced since Maddox changed suppliers.
Yeah, you do. See you.
Who wrote this?
'Nick Stokes, Crime Stopper.'
You went Hollywood on me, man.
Greg.
I do love a blond.
Hey, I wasn't done reading that.
How's that platinum blond coming?
Come on, Greg I'm not getting anything out of trace. I was hoping you could help me out here.
Not hair? Not human? What are you reading?
Bet I know someone who's hotter and I'm not talking about looks.
Yeah.
Watch your back.
Grissom, you got a second? I got a mystery.
Yeah.
Well, it's not a hair. It's a synthetic fiber. Glass-- what do you think, fiberglass?
This could be a lot of things.
What did your prom date say when you called her?
You think she's a suspect?
Stranger things have happened.
No.
No. You're tripping.
Change your password.
Warrick.
Fiberglass insulation -- comes in pink and yellow. But you already knew that. Is that why you're calling?
Yeah.
Hello. Hello? I-I can't hear you. H-hold on.
I can hardly hear you. We're at the, uh, satellite guy's house that installed Jane's cable.
Nick!
Patrol. Request immediate backup. Immediate backup. Officer down. I need emergency medical assistance! Eight-two-six ...
Nick! Nick.
But 's going to be all right?
Damn it. Grissom, this guy was right there. I could have had him.
Doesn't feel like the right thing.
I'm going with you.
Catherine thinks he might have got away with them. But, uh, Grissom did find some wacky video collection.
Yeah, relax, Ironside.
Gotten any clues as to where this guy might be?
He may know him well enough to read his e-mail.
Lunar Cable- a hundred and fifty channels.
They got this multiplex system -- there's eyes all over the place. There's eight floors, and four cameras per floor.
With all the stuff me and my boys got away with, it's probably why they have them now.
Well, hide and seek. Let's go.
How's this strap right here, is this tight enough?
How about this one? 
Well, you know, you can get cadets to do this, Cath. I mean, they're used to obstacle courses.
Yeah, well, it looks like a kill-and-dump to me. I mean, the guy waited for the coast to clear door to door, it's only ten meters ...
Yeah? Well, all right, after we find Paige.
Find anything interesting down there?
How's the smell, good?
What you got?
What floor are you on? 
Well, if the body was dumped it would've been moving pretty fast by then.
Oh, so as long as the students participate voluntarily we can use their DNA as we e fit.
The ole' Smart and Legal.
Hey, mouth boy, she's not going to kiss you. She just wants your DNA, okay?
Yeah, I know, I talked to the coach. Road trip.
I don't know. I just got here myself. Some homeless guy searching for hidden treasure finds a body. P.D.'S here on the scene. We got first looks.
Yeah.
I found some blood.
Driver tossed her in the dumpster to hide his crime.
Where you been?
I just left Sanders. The blood from the dumpster matches Paige.
We have sprayed, U.V.'D -- no hair, no fibers, no blood anywhere.
Oh, we've got tons of motives. Not a stitch of evidence.
Physics meets philosophy. 
Where are we going with this?
Nice try, Nostradamus.
Oh, yeah, I had to prop that open when Catherine rappelled down.
And there's no easy access here.
Whoo, man! It reeks in here. Who lives like this?
You think? So, what do we know?
Well, I can see why somebody would want to rob this place. I'll start in the bedroom.
We might want to reconsider 'burglary gone bad.' I found a busted safe in the bedroom. Empty. I lifted prints.
Phew. Eau de cat.
Hey, guys.
Talked with O'Riley. The neighbor's alibi does check out. She was at her sister's in L.A. During the time of the murder.
Not so fast. I got another one. We have a match on that print that we found on the wall safe.
Yeah. He has a non-gaming work card. He's 45 years old. He was an electrician at the Tangiers from '97 to '99. His name is Tyler Elliot.
Victim's son. Only child.
The one day I'm due in court and you pull a drowning in the desert.
Oh, it went great. The judge recessed right before my testimony. I'm on call. Catherine's on call.
Well, you're making progress. The blood from the poolside matches the female victim.
Yeah.
Are you able to prove that he drowned her in their swimming pool?
What else did you collect from the scene?
Goose feather? This looks like basalt rock. Didn't it say somewhere in here that she found her at 1,500 feet?
Well, you can only find this rock at high altitudes like 4,000 feet.
Yeah.
Yeah. I went on this field trip up at table mountain in my senior year -- 'rocks for jocks.' Don't ask me why I remember any of this.
Yeah.
I'll take the downstairs.
Brown.
Does she know about her father?
Well, I'd like to get started processing. Can you show me who you found?
Well, whoever this guy is, he's a lousy shot.
No, just evidence.
I got a pill. 
Looks like sedative.
Diazapam. Benzos..
Seems like a great place to ice someone.
Brown. 
I don't see this burgundy car. Where are you looking?
How did you find the disturbance? Drive up and down the canals all day?
Hey.
$500 for five dollars worth of honey? I don't think it's worth it.
I got a blood trail here. Leading to the garage.
He dragged the body to here ... 
... put her in that car.
This strike here. That one's all business.
Red. Is that our suspect?
Mm-hmm.
Looks like ginkwork. It's the kind of thing speed freaks do when they've been up for ten days straight and they've already taken apart the radio.
Shorthand?
You're not a control freak or anything?
Sara ... what's a homeless woman doing with a day planner and a $300 handbag?
Yeah.
I bought one for an ex-girlfriend once.
Just a couple of homeless guys.
Hey.
Yeah. Dangerous being a pretty girl in this town.
Hmmm.
What? You don't like cupcakes and candy bars?
Hey, Gris! Grissom!
I don't know.
Somewhere.
Maybe he wrote her a letter and left town. It's trash day.
It's on the street. It's fair game.
Photographic paper.
Is that why you tore up her photograph and tossed it in the trash?
Yeah, McBride clipped Rod Darling's right hand during his little hissy fit. Blood's his. And McBride's knife does not match these wounds.
Yeah. If other people inflicted as much torture as women inflict upon themselves, there would be lawsuits.
Greg-o, find any time between meals to check out Grissom's scrapings?
Yeah.
To Cassie, her sister.
Or your skin, or your hair or that zit on your forehead.
So you're saying she knew she was slipping.
So, really we're not talking about being beautiful at all.
Fourteen gram ... wait a minute. You're telling me that she weighed her bowels?
Well, that makes sense why the blood and skin under Ashleigh James's fingernails is a perfect match to Ashleigh James.
Also why Frank was so angry at Rod.
What happened to these girls?
Hey.
Good. I'm running it through AFIS right now. The good thing is that the jailhouse is a union gig and all the union guys are already in the database. What I did for the print was I lined up a ridge detail from the partial that I found on each handle.
So ... you think that guy fried before he fell?
Bobby Dawson's taking odds. Two to one, Grissom's wrong. Five to one, he gets suspended for shutting down that jailhouse. And ten to one ... 
Hey, Griss. How long you been standing there?
Robert Harris. Does that name mean anything?
Well, we heard the sheriff put the brakes on the investigation.
What? Do you want us to pay to see them?
Yeah, that's rough. And the significance of this evidence?
Trace amounts are odorless, tasteless.
So, where does this get us?
You want his blood?
Hey.
Cool.
Whatever happened with those metal cutters?
Roger Valenti's blood. Grissom wants it packaged in plastic. I don't know. Don't ask.
Later.
Hey, Gris. Valenti's blood. Packaged, ready to go.
You want to fill me in here? I mean, this wasn't covered in any science class I took.
That's far out.
That would explain that smell.
Just like Valenti's body. No evidence of electrocution.
And sodium is conductive, just like iron.
Roger Valenti's body offered up no resistance because of the excess iron in his blood.
Making his body one big wire -- path to ground.
So, you've just proved murder.
Twin moons of Venus.
Striations match.
Seems like a lot of work to kill a guy.
Hey, Griss. I think I can speak for both of us when I say I'm sorry that we let you down.
Bet you were like that in high school.
Oh, you were the girl I ran away from.
Construction on Flamingo. I'm sorry. 
Yeah.
A .38? 
Kind of weird being in a high school. 
What were you? A jock or a brain?
Reconstruction guys can give us a more precise angle measurement, but I'm thinking ... five-four ... maybe three. We got ourselves a shorty.
Cyranose 320. Company sent it to me, gratis for a week. They figure if it helps, CSI will buy one.
Yeah, well ... what if the shooter chews a certain kind of tobacco or has a unique halitosis and the e-nose picks up on it?
I thought it was our job to speak for the victim no matter what it took ... and to hell with the budgets.
Air pump. Cost about ten bucks.
Absorption agent?
It's been downsized.
Well, it's the same difference, really. 
Air is drawn into the last tube the chalk absorbs the chemicals from the air. And mass spec will break it down at the lab.
'Cause it was cool.
All right.
I saw her in action.
Yeah, she was.
I was just telling Nick how you were a big bully in high school.
No.
What Nick's trying to say he was unpopular.
What was wrong with those Members Only jackets? They were kind of cool back in the day.
Hey, Sara. What were you in high school?
Oh, I was short, I had big feet, thick glasses.
Yeah. I got pushed around by all the guys and never got any play from the girls ...
No, they used to tease me about my eyes. Called me names.
I didn't have a best feature in high school. Looking back on it now I can say I could see both sides of it thinking about this guy Barry Schickel, and how he was shot and whichever kid did it. I'm not saying it was right, but I kind understand, you know?
What's the matter, you don't trust me?
I got a boatload of chemical components here. Marijuana, bubble gum, cigars. It's like every guy's bathroom in America.
This... does not belong in a guy's bathroom. Can we prove this? I mean there's got to be a thousand different brands of this stuff out there.
Oh. Now you want my tricked-out toy.
That's all from one perfume?
We can narrow it down to one brand?
Well, aromas have fingerprints. They're like a unique combination of vapor molecules that linger in the air, long after the source has gone.
Paperwork. Later.
All right. Show time.
Check out these 'voids.' That's the real evidence.
Guys ... 
Looks like it could be an electric saw.
You check nosebleed's tools yet?
That's because he probably ditched them after using them on the victim. Now we've just got to figure out which one.
Twenty-four hours, then we've got to get them back. Clean.
Same short 'v' pattern, too.
This is on the real. You actually saw him do this?
Female blood.
We already know this beetle feeds only off of human blood, so why are we extracting its stomach contents?
Well, I hope he got his grub before you grabbed him up.
Let's go knock down some walls.
One wall down ... 15 to go.
Uh ... yeah.
I got a hollow section.
Damn. Are we in the wrong apartment again?
Miss?
We're from the Crime Lab. You found the deceased?
Makes us doubt the circumstances surrounding the victim's death.
'Shelley Danvers' -- appointment 8:00.
Well, you lied to us before.
Well, if she did, the coroner would find water in her lungs but it'd be worse hearing it from him than from you.
Oh, it's on.
Uh, yeah. Tina ... Tina Kolas. Best friends from Terre Haute, Indiana. Flew here in a package. Why?
Cath. Whose shirt is this?
When?
We're going to take this shirt, if you don't mind.
We're going to take this as well.
Well, that's okay. We do magic.
Sometimes a simple flashlight will do the trick.
She died of a heat stroke. The coroner just called in with the results of his final post. Your sauna's kept in the optimal condition for heat stroke -- 182 degrees. 
That could kill a person if you left them longer than two straight hours.
Football-- wide-screen.
She died of heat stroke.
We missed it until Captain Brass brought your room service records to our attention.
As her best friend, you would know that.
You killed her over a guy you two met at a bar?
Her pressure got so low her blood quit running through her organs. They shut down.
Cash business, huh?
He's either stupid or suicidal.
All right, I'll take the lot.
You run this car already?
Right here?
We're dealing with some criminal genius here. 
You forgot the 'leave the evidence on the ground.'
So, our victim breaks out of the store with a bag full of dough ...
Guess somebody was casing the joint, huh?
Ms. Delgado, how long have you been here?
You have insurance?
Thank you.
Well, I might bet my own paycheck on that one.
Check it out. What's the first thing you do when you see one of these on your windshield?
Exactly. But the only guy to chuck his was the victim. I found one on the ground next to his car.
I know, I know, it sucks. You couldn't get anything off of it, huh?
Wow.
So, that confirms what Sara's eyewitness said. What else you got?
Thanks.
Can you tell us anything about the tool that may have been used?
Like the insulation in my attic.
Hey.
Hey. 
Small world, huh?
Hey, that's ironic, Hector. We're investigating your brother-in-law's shooting and look where we end up.
We also have a tire print.
We're looking for a Honda, Hector.
You know it don't look good when you run, man. You want to tell us who that Honda belongs to?
I guess that makes everything okay.
You got that right.
These guys packed enough .45 caliber ammo for a small army.
Less than a year ago security couldn't even carry guns.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Ski masks are played out. Red and blue teamed up together and took out the guards and their rolling cage.
Black shot down that chandelier.
No amount of makeup in the world could cover up that chunk of adam's apple. 
No honor among thieves.
No stubble ... no adam's apple.
Well, the manager's not in?
I got a key.
Yeah.
Anything that links Brower to his co-conspirators.
I'm thinking trace elements in the clothes could tell us where he was before the heist. I'm going to take it all back to the lab.
I found similar dust on Adam Brower's dirty clothes. Check it out.
What's the composition?
Yeah, um... what do you know about silica?
Shouldn't smell at all, if this place is abandoned.
Shot with a .45. Execution style.
I just got off the phone with the Laughlin CSI assigned to last month's cottage casino case. He told me the casino's cameras captured four assailants, not three.
Actually, it didn't. We did.
Tower casino surveillance. The screen on your left the camera's trained over where Tammy, Darin and Adam entered. The screen on your right is trained on the gaming tables. Okay, check it out.
What, you missed him? All right. I'll play it again ... slower, just for you.  Now, keep your eye trained on the pit boss and the chandelier.
Yeah. Pit boss' name is Max Duncan. Started working there about three weeks ago. Before that ... 
You lost?
For what?
Yeah, except when you're losing. Then you don't hear anything.
Hey, Hank.
She's over there.
Will do.
That's a big pot. Casino's not satisfied with a heart attack?
Suspicious circs.
Nah. Poker's not gambling. It's playing against percentages. It's a skill. I like to play for the thrill.
Ace of spades.
What color is it?
Is that what I think it is?
How is it that you know so much about poker?
You're kidding. Wow. I'm impressed. I mean, the fact that you sat at a table with actual living beings.
What I don't get is it's not like we've never talked about gambling before. How come you never mention it?
He doesn't want to be exposed.
She killed him with eyedrops?
I can buy that: You ingest eyedrops it constricts the blood vessels throughout your body maybe even spike your blood pressure perhaps even cause a stroke.
What's that?
Let's back up here. Victim had chronic lead poisoning from a bullet that was left in his leg.
But what you're thinking is the lead from the bullet made his brain swell up with ... uncal herniation?
Except that someone put tetrahydrozoline in his drink which made his blood pressure spike and now we got his brain in a bowl.
Nasty.
Well, you didn't seem too worried about money the other night. We watched the surveillance tape. Doyle Pfeiffer didn't even pass you a nickel yet you were all over him.
Is that why you were giving eyes to the California kid?
He did, but he had help. Someone put something in his drink.
You mind if I take a look in your purse?
Whiskey.
Sour.
Suck. 
His drink in her eyedrops; her eyedrops in his drinks. 
Well, we got a bonded bartender, eye in the sky, other waitresses. How the hell did she get that into his drink without anyone seeing?
Yes.
Got that tox report back.
Yeah, and according to the tox report the bullet in his leg wasn't degraded enough to account for the amount of lead in his body.
Let's not forget the eyedrops are already in the drink; maybe she's giving him a signal.
Yeah, in a casino? Picture that. 
What's up, Griss?
Really?
Whatever's in the atmosphere gets into the soil, gets into the cocoa plants. Capillary action. 
Well, if he had those chocolates with him in '86 he's had them every night since. His lucky charm.
Wow. That would explain all the lead in him.
Yeah? Maybe for you.
Six stories, sixty stories. It's not how you fall, it's how you land.
Yeah, and more brain matter.
Hey. I think the prints are out. Bones burst right through the skin.
What about dental?
You think? Hey, wait a minute. Look. You might have another option. Check out that artwork.
You think you can stretch that out?
Leah! Good to have you back on nights.
I came to see you for your expert opinion.
See what you can make of this.
You recognize this?
I-I?
He's a shrink?
So he gets in your head and under your skin, huh? You're a gem.
Really?
Nice. The rose is still my favorite, though.
Strength, superiority, and ambition, huh? Not exactly the characteristics of an angel.
And when the wax melted, he plunged to his death.
For what?
You got a print off of that pipe?
You know if he's asking we're not going to figure it out.
Strangled, and then thrown off of the roof?
Suffocation means he died with his brain still in his head.
All right. High impact from a high altitude.
Yeah... and the rest is gravity.
Drive a car?
None of this explains how he dropped out of the sky.
All right, none of that works. I talked to air traffic control and they had no aircraft operating in that area at that time.
What?
Sardines? That's funny.
What the hell were you doing in Honduras?
Say that three times fast.
4,500 feet ... Mount Potosi.
That's on the ground. Let's get on the net and figure out how he got into the air.
Of course.
Yeah, sounds like you want to go for a spin.
What's his style?
Looks like it should be about having fun.
Guy's got a surfboard for California and a snowboard for Utah.
If his canopy was ripped to shreds what the hell was he flying with?
'Guess you can fly with anything. Find me when you get back-- T.'
According to the manager Fred Dacks has been working here for three years. Model employee, knows his gear.  Hi.
I'm looking for Fred Dacks.
Thanks.
But guess who just got hired here a month ago?
Yeah. Small world, huh?
Fred Dacks?
I'm Warrick Brown, this is Nick Stokes. We're from the Las Vegas Crime Lab. We need to ask you a few questions about Jimmy Maurer.
Except maybe that tattoo right there.
You mean Icarus, right?
Try again. Your yellow canopy.
It wasn't his junk, it was someone else's.
Yeah, for now.
So Fred does a number on Jimmy's canopy to keep him from flying.
He needs to be the Top Dog, huh?
Yeah, that sounds like you.
You.
So ... Jimmy gets a new canopy. Flies, dies. Comes down unattached. We got no canopy, we got no harness.
Have you taken your medication today?
He took off here and he came down here, right?
Well, we get a little classical dynamics going on we can find this rig.
Search area is northeast Summerlin.
Yeah, we lucked out.
Well ... 
These leg loops, they're unbuckled. I guess there's no surprise there.
Not the kind of rush you're looking for?
Check this out. 'Property of Potosi Glide Center.'
Weston didn't tell us he gave Jimmy his replacement rig.
Well, it seems the lines leading to the a-riser were cut.
Couldn't let Fred get the better of him.
Right before he lawyered it up.
It's frayed. You're saying if he had cut it with a tool, it'd be clean.
But Weston knew that that canopy was in bad shape. And we don't have any evidence to suggest that he sabotaged it.
Oh, the victim of sudden weather that you thought was murdered.
That's the cumulus cloud formed by warm air rising? The thermals?
Yep. He's probably getting the ride of his life.
He's rising fast.
Air is getting thinner. 15,000 feet he passes out and suffocates.
But he had an oxygen tank ... on his harness. Why didn't he use it?
Well, the gauge reads full.
There's only one way to find out.
Flowing fine.
Unless he didn't think he needed it.
Okay. Las Vegas is 2,030 feet above sea level. You got that thing plugged in yet?
Let's see what we've got.
30 feet.
Oh, you fixed it, all right. You decalibrated it. It was off by
Yeah, you had perfect sky massive canopy, bitchen thermals, dude and a challenge he'd never refuse. You played him against himself.
No, it's not why you fly. The truth is on your arm. Alecto ... Magaera, Tisiphone; the three furies. Unceasing anger, vengeance and jealousy. That's what you're about.
Hey, Catherine.
Yeah, I'm a mystery.
He bugged out early.
Thanks. Yeah, I will.
All right. Have a good morning.
Empty? Maybe she was just broke.
Yeah.
Did someone move her?
You sure with all your life-saving efforts you didn't move her?
Well, someone moved her. She bled out her 
Is it recent?
Sara.
I think our suicide just became suspicious circs.
Different sole, different size. Thank you. Sorry for the inconvenience. This is just a standard procedure. 
Do you have any idea where your daughter's boyfriend works?
Uh, which one?
Yeah. Well, maybe the glass came from another windshield in this lot.
Business suit.
Underwear.
That looks like adhesive.
Like what else?
Well, she died yesterday. We think it may have been a suicide.
Yeah.
We used to call a guy like that a bean counter. Degenerates paying 25 cents a pop in the hopes of cracking a pattern.
It's his results. But that joker doesn't realize that the patterns can end up in the hundreds of millions.
This isn't gambling. This is the end of the line.
How long have you been here, sir?
How did you get the blood on your shirt?
You're coming with the shirt. We'll need your shoes, too.
Brody, we have your shoeprint in Linda's blood. We also have a sample of Linda's blood that we found on your t-shirt. Is there anything you'd like to tell us?
But you left her there, dead.
Oh, I get it. You and Linda are kind of on the same page, huh?
Yeah, you're right. It's not.
It's almost like bipolar boy is too high to even realize what went down.
Thank you.
No lithium, just like her parents said. She did have a huge dose of valium, ingested less than an hour before her time of death.
Yeah.
200 milligrams. That's more than five times the normal dosage.
That was quick.
Yeah. Thanks, Sully.
Mrs. Damen, our detective found this prescription in your name for valium.
Can you tell us anything about that?
And you last got a prescription ... this past monday. What does that mean?
May we have your permission to look through the current contents of your prescription?
No.
We're simply trying to determine ...
We can get a warrant to test your DNA sample against our sample.
Or someone else.
Reminds of what my grandmother said a long time ago. I would never believe her.
Crazy people make even sane people act crazy.
I hear David's resurrecting the dead now.
I just came from the hospital. That guy's in ICU with respiratory paralysis. I did get a prelim on his blood work -- looks like some sort of an organic poison.
That guy's a charmer.
I'm Warrick Brown, this is Gil Grissom. We're from the Las Vegas Crime Lab.
Poison could've come from any of these sources here.
In every way. This guy was like the monster closer. You ever buy a brand-new car, Griss?
It's not about logic. It's about that smell. There's nothing like the smell of a brand-new car.
Warrick Brown.
Fred Stearns just passed away. Again.
That unknown substance I collected from Marty Gibson's coat ...
How'd you know?
Fred Stearns dropped a dime at girls, girls, girls and wrote it off.
Neiman Marcus, jewelry department?
Well, here's a freaky one. Since when are two dozen mice a business expense?
You know it's illegal in the state of nevada to have venomous snakes?
What do you mean, 'none'?
So, Marty was telling the truth? It was just a coincidence that he owns poisonous snakes, and his co-worker was envenomated.
Hey.
Yeah, not too far away. My grandmother still lives down the block. Lot of familiar faces.
We're going to do our jobs.
What was he doing here?
Phelps?
What happened, man?
I'm sorry, man. I'm sorry.
I got here as quick as I could. What happened?
You are making a difference. I'm living proof. I'm sorry.
I want this case.
Matt told me his house was broken into about a week ago. They took all of his awards, his medals. Everything in this case. I hope whoever took it, it meant as much to them as it did to him.
No doubt. All this damage.
Yeah?
You saw his girl. She was hot. They're probably macking on her.
And the bullets went from right to left.
Took that corner pretty hard, huh?
Yeah.
There's a silver paint transfer, though, right here.
Jay ... Jacobs?
Gene Jaycobs. I knew that kid. I went to school with him. He got kicked out.
Put your hands out in front of you.
I can process this now. It would tell me if you fired a gun within the last couple of hours. But I'm going to take this back to the lab, make you sweat it out.
We got him.
Oh, come on. That's it? That's his genius story?
He's lying.
Our shooter isn't only a liar, he's a thief. Found tons of electronic equipment in there, still in the boxes.
No guns or ammo. But I do have his car keys.
I may have something here. The shooter's vehicle took out a mailbox. The dent's in the right spot, and the car is the right silver color 
Nothing visible.
Hey.
It's not that simple.
We got all our guys on this, Matt, all right?
You still using them same old uniforms?
Yeah.
Hey, I ain't stupid. I know where I came from. I wouldn't be anywhere, if it weren't for this place.
Still do. I don't recognize this ugly-ass gang symbol.
Break-ins?!
I'll look into it for you, all right? We'll get them there. When's Aimee's service?
Matt, if there's anything I can do ...
Brown.
What?
If Jaycobs is going to slip through our fingers, I need someone else to explain to him what went wrong.
That's supposed to be his alibi?
Clothes he slept in, bloodshot eyes. The guy's a junkie, Grissom. You can see it, I can see it, and the jury will see it.
But what?
Come on.
Sports chalet is ten minutes away. That's no alibi.
So that's it? As easy as that, he walks.
Not here. C'mon.
C'mon. We're going to cool off.
This guy's been in Matt's house.
Matt's team won this three years ago. This trophy was given to the rec center last year. I found all this stuff in Jaycobs' car.
This is the same guy who shot Matt's daughter in the head. He's walking around laughing at us.
What is this? I've been putting guys away like this for years. And now that it matters, it's like you're holding me back here.
I'm so tired of hearing that. I've heard it a million times. I can't be like you. I'm not a robot, okay? 
I actually care about these people.
Keep it.
Assistant District Attorney Kelly's office, please. This is Warrick Brown.  Yeah, I know it's not standard procedure but, uh, I missed him at lockup, and I'm going to be in hot water if I don't get this stuff back to him, so ... good.
It's just me. Nobody here. Got no heater.
I just thought I'd come by and let you know we're going to get you for robbery, if not murder. By the time you get to lockup, every roughneck in the joint is going to know you off'ed a nine-year-old little girl.
Want to step outside, then?
What, you think I did this?
Well, I didn't.  I'd just to shake the hand of the guy that did, though. 
Where were you last night?
I'm going to need to see your hands.
Other side.
But I never touched the guy.
If he's guilty, we're going to put him away.
Eye for an eye and the whole world goes blind? You taught me that.
I've got no choice here. My hands are tied. I got to let them bring you in.
Of course.
Yeah.
Great, thanks.
Hey.
Yeah.
Grissom. 
Matt used to have this really harsh rule about no eating in the van.
Just see if you can get some DNA off of this stick, would you?
Tyrel Constantine. Arrested last June for joyriding. Date of birth '87? This guy's a juvie. He's only 15.
He used to?
So you threw him out?
When did this happen?
The vehicle that was used in that drive-by was the van that was stolen from your rec center.
He gave up on himself.
I blew it.
Have we had any luck on cross-referencing any of the guys in their lives?
We're still working on some shoe prints but the plaster's still wet.
Yeah, you'd know it, Spanky.
Yeah, not outside some poor woman's bedroom window.
Good. Looks like I got a size eight. Check back with me, I should have more in a bit.
Hey, this cast that poured into the shoe print that I found outside that victim's bedroom window ...
Pulled off some trace materials from it. It's like a yellow substance. It may be paint. Take a look and tell me what you think. Check it out.
Yeah, I'm thinking maybe road paint ... crosswalk ... lane markings maybe.
That stuff dries pretty fast. So he must've stepped in it on his way to the scene.
Hello. I'm Warrick Brown. I'm from the Las Vegas Crime Lab. We're investigating a disturbance a couple doors down. I wanted to ask you a few questions if I could.
Foam at the sinner's den ...
I hung out here a few times.
Your knucklehead boyfriend never took you on the party circuit?
That's cool about Vegas. It's Monday: Rain at the Palms; Tuesday: Eden at studio 54; Wednesday: Raw at the Luxor; Thursday's Baby's ...
A little of both. Don't you love this town?
It's the foam. 
Reminds me of the Mirage. Steve Wynn didn't like the smell of the volcano erupting, so he changed the fuel mixture. Now it smells like a pi√±a colada.
Got a long dark hair.
I was wondering where I put my nice silver satin thong.
Glow stick. Ball-point pen. Cell phone antenna. You have the luminol?
Thank you.
Nothing.
Are we sure it was a blunt object?
Stilettos, huh? Brings out the toes, accentuates the legs. Murder on the ankles, though.
Hello.
We work as a team.
Uh-huh.
Hey. We heard about what happened. I'm so sorry.
Yeah.
They're all ladies.
Killers usually don't stray too far from home. 
Yeah, I'm squeezing the Las Vegas search area.
I'll exclude everyone with light hair.
Huh. Rebecca McCormick. 235 Desert Ranch Road. 'First time', my ass.
Okay, the hair on the left is from Trey Buchman's room at The Sphere hotel. The hair on the right is a sample we took from Rebecca McCormick. Cuticles on both are shiny and smooth. Telltale signs the hair has been treated. 
The cortex isn't letting any light through. It lets us know the hair's been colored. The medullas are continuous. I can't be definitive without DNA, they look like Rebecca McCormick's.
Your hair has a similar morphology to the hair that we found in Mr. Buchman's hotel suite.
No, but the DNA we also recovered from under the sheets does mean you.
The same amount that we found in Croix Richards' apartment.
Like coming in the back way, huh?
It's okay.
I'm Warrick Brown. This is Catherine Willows.
Is it a high profile?
Who are we looking for here?
Tavian Tombs, professional basketball player. Very high profile.
We're here to find your son.
Look, I've seen you take out three guys on the glass and still finish. I'm not here to bang boards with you. I'm here to do my job.  It's your son; it's your call.
'I have Isaiah. Bring $5 million to the northwest corner of Telfair and Juniper, 4:00 A.M.'
You said that Captain Brass was here?
At least let us mark it.
8 x 11 plain white copy paper. It's mass-produced. You can get it anywhere. The envelope, unfortunately, is self-adhering.
No.
Nothing I can see.
They weren't lying. They all touched it. Everybody's who's got a piece of Tavian got a hand on that ransom note. Even the bellman and the desk clerk left prints on the envelope.
Just a few smudges, a couple of partials.
No.
Yeah, that was detected on the ransom note-menthol and nicotine. 
We're way past the drop time here.
No, I think it's just some freak with a nicotine habit and access to a laser printer.
Yeah, that money's not doing him any good now, huh?
It's just gone bad.
Hey! Hey!
What are you concerned about here -- the kid or your job?
It's him. I'll take the perimeter.
Thanks. I'm not ready to deal with another murdered kid. I'll process the evidence.
Thanks. Have you taken a look?
Well?
Sisal? Rope? Mostly likely from the restraint.
Take a look.
It's canine. Sweatshirt was riddled with dog hair. Many different breeds.
Kids love dogs. I know when I was a kid, I was all over them. That's a good start. Thanks.
What have you got?
He was drugged?
Well, we lifted dog hair from the sweatshirt we found near the body.
Multiple breeds.
Try the reference of Veterinary Pharmaceuticals and Biologicals.
It wasn't the money drop that went bad. The problem was Isaiah died.
Okay.
Cath?
Partner you think?
Okay. Sample from the kennel is on your right. Your bear on the left. 
Three grand a month? Tavian tombs has been a $12 million-a-year player for eight seasons, not including endorsements.
Motive for us. She was right to assume that Tavian would immediately pay that ransom. What's five million to a guy who makes hundreds of millions?
I don't know. I think that Bridget Willis killed him because he killed Isaiah.
Plenty of tire treads, but nothing looks fresh.
I got called in by Internal Affairs. How do you think it went? Too many questions.  Thanks.
Yeah.  It's a red light camera. Did any of the witnesses see the driver run the red light? 
I'll put in a call.
Now, that looks fresh.
Catherine.  Tire treads. That kills one theory. Car's brakes must've been working.
Do you know how long it takes to get in touch with anybody at the transportation safety bureau? It's way out of hand. Diane Lambert ran the light.
Well, the tread marks tell us that her brakes did work, so it must've been something else that malfunctioned, causing her to accelerate.
Hey. You have, uh ...
Don't worry about it. How's it going? You find anything?
Well, I did some more digging down at the TSB. I found out that the red light camera that photo'd our driver catches four times as many violators as any other camera in Vegas.
The building has mirrored glass on it. Lets in the light, but it keeps out the glare.
So you think the sun was a factor in the crash?
The accident was at 5:15, so the sun was still in the sky.
Yeah.  All right, well, there's 24 hours in a day, 360 degrees in the earth's rotation. 360 divided by 24 is ... 15?
Wow, you're fast. 3.75, huh?  Then the sun was behind the trees at the time of the accident, so it was not a factor.
Are you serious? David lost a body?
When did he come in?
Eleven days ago? I guess we've got no more crime scene to process.
And a nice laceration with ecchymosis on his left temple.
Could have been an accident.
Looks like his gear's all here. I don't see a sleeping bag, though.
You called it. Positive for blood.
Got a trail of bloody footprints.
Grissom. I think I might have just found our murder weapon.
Mrs. Mercer, we found this statue on your mantle. It had your fingerprints on it.
Well, we also found your husband's blood on the base of it. 
Really?
I guess the machine ate it, huh?
Wicked.
So these are Willy Reddington's original gear. This guy was classy. He goes into a store, buys new clothes, and leaves the old ones behind. And they tossed them in the dumpster.
This is Vegas, baby. Anybody can get lucky.
Not a drop.
Yeah, how do you dump a body with no car? What did he do, drag Mercer down the strip?
Everything was still there. Except the coin collection.
Who called it in?
We got an I.D. On the body?
Driver's permit.
Tell them to watch their step. There's casings and blood everywhere.
Divide and conquer. Inside or outside?
I'll take everything below the knees.
Got some shards of glass. Clear in color.  Mixed with small pieces of black plastic.
You almost finished with that? What's your count?
109 bullets?
Geez, what was this kid, tortured?
What do you think could've done this? Baseball bat?
Yeah. 
Shot from a distance. 
And at a downward angle ... it's, uh ... it's about 25 degrees. He was shot from above.
Rooftop angle is 45 degrees. This is 25 degrees? It's impossible.
What else you got?
There's nothing harmless about death.
This where the limbo party is? 
Can I come in?
Well, I've got your one-to-ones. The tire treads, there's nothing specific here.
But the shoe prints that you took, they look interesting. It looks like five suspects walked in, and four ran out.
No doubt. How's it coming with your big bamboo here?
You test for GSR? The place was riddled with bullets-- it wouldn't hurt.
Maybe this has nothing to do with the case. Maybe it was just a piece of debris left at the scene.
Where you going?
The mother. Tell them I'm on my way.
I'm very sorry for your loss, Mrs. McCallum.  Are you Timmy's brother?
We were able to identify Timmy by the driver's permit that we found at the scene. Had he been driving long?
What kind of car does Timmy drive?
Do you ever drive the mini-van, Kevin?
Did you drive Timmy to the warehouse the other night?
We have reason to believe that Kevin was at the warehouse that night. We found his DNA on some beer bottles.
I understand. We are going to need to keep Kevin here to ask him some more questions about that night. Do you object?
Hodges, how's it coming with that glass?
Looks like there's some kind of coating on it. 
You think someone has this murder on tape?
Venus and Serena. Perfect match.
I found a 12-pack container in the McCallum minivan. Sales slip said
Peel it back.
Skateboarding? Why don't you stand up and take off your shirt.
Geez, man, what happened to you? Turn around.
Those are the same markings your brother had. You want to tell us what went down here?
Kevin, who did this to you, man?
I'm sorry I'm late. What bullet are you on?
Yeah, hook it up.
The trajectory is all pointing in one uniform area. Looks like some kind of a pole.
The whole case has been like this. It's like you can't wrap your head around it, you know?
Camera glass, blood droplets everywhere, DNA that says five people were there, one boy's dead, one boy's injured, and he ain't sayin' nothin' ...
You don't recognize that guy, do you? It's Tom Haviland, movie star.
It's blood. I guess you forgot to scrub the back of your hands, huh?
Well, I'm going to get this blood evidence to DNA. I'll catch up with you guys later.
Great. What is this?
Oh, great. Here we go.  This is CSI Brown. I got a T&amp;A, at Ogden and Main. Please send EMS, Emergency Medical Assistance as soon as you can. Hey ... 
You all right?
Okay. Okay, all right...
Okay. Hey, stay with me. Stay with me. Let me look at you...
Hey, no, no, no ...
Okay. All right. All right, keep your head back. All right, I got to get a towel for your head.
Okay, I'll be here with you for the ambulance, okay? Take a deep breath. 
Can someone give me a towel?!
I got held up behind a traffic accident. I put it in with Greg. I'm not sure if he's done with it yet.
We got our guy then.
That blood was not contaminated. I recovered it from the back of Tom Haviland's hand sealed it, delivered it to sanders in DNA.
I was out of my car two, three minutes tops.
They day I do that is the day I turn in my badge.
Good defense attorney always does the last thing you expect.
I just got served. 
Movie star's lawyer wants the shirt that I wore to the crime scene.
I had to throw it out.
It was covered in the blood from the accident victim.
Oh, CSI's on trial now?
I've been through every dumpster on these premises.
It would only prove that I got blood on my shirt from an accident victim. That blood never came in contact with the blood evidence that I was transporting.
I don't see what that has to do with this case.
Damn! Why didn't I see that coming? Gambling?
Legal doesn't matter in there. You know the judge is going to throw out our blood evidence, right?
The blood is fine. It's their methods that are dirty.
I am.
It's a low blow. Low blow.
I'm on it.
I'm Warrick Brown from CSI. You want to tell me what happened here?
Where'd he start?
What'd he steal? 
Where?
This isn't funny anymore.
... right now, it looks like only your Innoko water product is involved. CSI is going to need the name of any recent firings, anyone with a lawsuit against the company, anyone who's made threats against the company -- anyone with an axe to grind.
If we have to, one bottle at a time until we find every tainted bottle.
Oh, so, each time Dougie Max and Casey Flynn took a sip, the liquid came in contact with the threads and washed back into the bottle.
Great.
I got all the stacks arranged by locations, so the convenience store is right here. 140 bottles-- NV6630.
Well, the bottle that killed Casey Flynn came from this store.
Over here.
So, the source of the poison bottles was the comedy club.
Why?
You get lost out here, you're toast.
Poetic.
Toby Wellstone. Mckinley High School. 12/12/87.
Looks like a transdermal patch. Fetanyl. Pores in the hand make for faster absorption. Intentional overdose.
I see some tracks over there, but ... they could be from anything: A surveyor's tool ... a remote-controlled car ... 
Nope. I don't know what's worse, consoling a grieving parent, or finding a kid with no parents at all.
No, this kid has been through seven foster homes in seven years. System lost track of him a year ago.
That's a five-course meal to a teenager.
Yeah, that's a painkiller.
No nausea, no vomit.
Permanent solution to a temporary problem.
It's raining bodies here.
Want to turn her over?
He's wearing a suit. She's wearing a prom dress? That's odd.
No prior scarring on the wrists, but the same transdermal patch. That white substance looks like the same stuff you found near Toby's body.
Who got out of bed and ended up a half-a-mile away.
What are you thinking?
Hello. You get anything off of that dress?
That's kind of freaky.
No, the kit came back negative. The stomach contents came back the same. Identical to Toby's: Burger, fries, and a shake. 
And, also, the drug ratios were the same for fentanyl and cisapride.
You know what else is freaky -- her prints were on his patch, and his prints were on hers.
Well, you know, I read somewhere that only 15% of suicides actually leave a note, but you would think, with all the trouble they went through, they would want to be found.
Yeah, and after she was sedated, she crawls away from the scene?
Ladies ... who is Alyssa?
Did you also give her fentanyl and cisapride?
You know Jill's friends seemed like they were brainwashed ... or brain-dead. And moms was absentee at best, huh?
Yeah.
Yeah?
Oh, yeah? Looks like moms is a personal shopper and chauffeur, huh? Guess moms is busy.
Why didn't you tell us that Jill and Toby had access to these?
Hi, baby. Hi, little baby.
So you encouraged them to take the pills.
You drove them out to death valley after their last meal.
I think we can convince a jury that you did more than just watch.
Miss ...
No.
Hi ... hey.
There's nobody in the evidence vault. I guess we're still between shifts.
You know, O'Riley interviewed the victim's wife.
She said her husband was in the garage drinking and just 'done fell over.'
Right. You thinking poison?
Well, that would be nice -- an easy case.
These double-ups are killing me.
Yeah, how is Lindsey, by the way?
Lindsey? Fighting?
Why don't you tell us exactly what happened. As best as you can remember.
It's okay.
Get some rest.
Want to strip it?
All right.
Well ... there's no crater.
I guess we're looking for a combustible liquid?
What do you think? Developer pan?
Mix that with a heat source, and what have you got?
So, you had to do a solvent extraction? What did you use?
Same way you turned off that hot plate?
Mysterious dude defense.
Start dialing.
Hey.
Oh, you work fast. Which color charts Hodges' developer pan?
The blue. That's 180-degree array. That's not the epicenter of the explosion.
By what?
Then who blew up the lab?
Wonder what he was doing here. He's supposed to be off duty.
Take the cameras.
They made sure we didn't have eyes.
Lockwood was a good cop. It's too bad.  Grissom, I just talked to Hodges. That black substance from the camera lens? The FTIR spit back magnesium aluminum, silicate, talc, methylparaben, and sunscreen. All of these chemicals are consistent with camouflage cream.
My guess is the same stick they used to cover up that camera lens, they used to paint their faces with. I just found an eyelash in it.
If this getaway driver's stupid enough to get whacked by his partners, he's stupid enough to leave something behind.
Whew. Whew.
Sixty grand a year for jockeying cars? I'm in the wrong line of work.
I got two $5,000 stacks from the rampart.
That means he got nothing.
Thanks.
I have your scarf back from Sanders.
You want me to replicate the blood pattern?
These don't look like your ordinary household pair.
What's the purpose of scissors that long?
Hmm, let me see if I can flip it around so we're not looking at an eye chart.
Yeah, somebody man-handled her pretty good before they killed her.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Tastes like sugar.
You've been watching way too much Discovery Channel.  This guy needs a girl. 
I'm going to check out the cabana.
Hey, fellas. Looks like the husband pulled a Clark Kent and left all his clothes behind. Couldn't have gone far. I got his wallet, credit card and keys.
You hear that? What is that?
Sounds like it's clogged.
You still harping on the solo thing? You know every time you work with me you learn something.
Yes.
You must get a lot of ass on a job like this, huh?
Yeah, I get it. The last time you were there did you happen to see anything out of the ordinary?
Maybe.
You mind if I take a look in your cab?
Well, that's a coincidence.
Newman's anti-vortex filter was missing three screws.
Oh, you mean, like, a 'leave-behind'?
The more she'd want you.
Well, the lab wants more of you, too. We're going to need your fingerprints and a DNA sample.
How's it coming?
Sometime this year.
All right, where do I stand?
Big steps? Little steps?
I go any further, I'll be in the closet.
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
How's this?
These slime will do anything to sell a house, huh?
Hey, John McEnroe, where's the game?
Prints came back to the pool boy.
All right, now, don't get your panties in a bunch.  Uh, so we got the blond hair, the tooth filling ... that's it, huh?
White neoprene.
Like in a wet suit neoprene? 
Was the vic a diver?
Let's think about that. Who wears a white wet suit in a pool?
A professional.
Yeah.
Catherine, are you all right?
He must have gotten out the back window.
You the First Officer on the scene? 
When you clear a place you clear it, do you understand?
We lost a CSI two years ago because of the same mistake!
Use your radio and call for backup.
Hey ... 
Are you okay?
You know I could do this for you. CATHERINE: Not going to hurt any less.
That cut is deep.
Huh?
You decent? 
Looks like we're up.
Yeah, I didn't get any prints either but I did get a partial shoe tread from the back gate. And I don't think our dead guy lived here.
These pictures. Got Detective Wolf looking for the homeowner's name from the real estate records.
From what, do you think? A hammer, butt of a gun? DAVID PHILLIPS: I was just going to see if I could figure that out. 
The neighbors heard shouting. Two guys break and enter and get into some kind of an alternation.
Cath? You all right? 
Don't let him get to you like that.
The skin from the dead guy and the denim found in the cabinet were both coated in the same substance. 
Yeah, partially hydrogenated soy bean oil, traces of beef fat, sugar and potato starch.
That would explain the marks on the guy's forearms. Grease burns.
Let's go check it out.
Shoe tread, denim fiber, a lot of cooking grease. Based on that evidence, they all did it.
Hey! 
Big glass box and all I got is a partial thumb print.
Yeah. Want me to bag it for you?
Oh, I get it. There's a chute inside the steps.
I've got ovoid blood drops leading towards the wall.
Someone bolted out of here pretty fast.
Try this one. It's a print from the 'Chamber of Doom.'
Hands inside the trick?
We have reason to believe that that woman, planted or not ... 
... sustained injury during the first insertion of the saber.
Goodyear Wrangler. Ford F-150. Hallelujah.
Who?
Wait a minute. CODIS? What database?
She's in the database already?
Built it so close to the railroad.
It's a little too calm in here.
Wow.
Six pints of 'A' positive.
You keep disappearing.
Hey, guys, check out this old photo. The 'Clein Magical Tour'. I guess the old man with beard must be the father.
Yes.
What is that, a butterfly?
How'd it get in here?
There's none of that in here. 
Yeah.
Hey! Back up.
What kind of car do you drive?
Ford F-150.
It's a match.
Whoa. Well, at least we know the animal. Black panther.
Thorazine.
Someone just got nailed to the cross.
Okay.
Yeah. On earth.
Zephyr Dillinger and Punky the stagehand. They're related?
Magician and his double.
The little boy from the picture.
Zephyr's still out there.
This evidence was processed, what, fifteen years ago?
Keep Mathers in prison. 
Pro, if he did it. The applications sucks, though. There's a lot of brown skin on that row.
What about you?
Really?
The trash bag, yeah. I was looking at that. Processed with superglue, rhodamine, laser. No prints found though.
Franco. Just off of days.
What you got?
Grissom says it's precautionary in case Mathers gets overturned and you get swamped.
This looks familiar.
Yeah.
Yeah? It's got to be the cleanest tape lift I've ever seen. There's no stains of any kind in this car.
Well, this is my alma mater. Econ 101-- that's Sabian Hall. It's a long walk from here but I know the way.
Damn. It's still wet.
What's the first thing you'd do if you got paint on your hands?
I'll see if I can get a match from this.
I've got a backpack. Wallet ... Debbie Reston. Credit cards ... money, keys.
This is the spot. You can see the path and the rail.
And he waited till her back was turned ... and came up behind her.
That would explain why she had defensive wounds and none of the other victims did.
It's not from her car. Her upholstery is red.
The glass on the left is not polarized. There's not color change.
Yeah, the one found in the path. Not the one found in her hand.
I'll buy that, but the glass on the right was the one extracted from the cuts on her hand. And it matches the glass that Catherine found near the water fountain.
What is that, 20/80? That's like half of mine. It's not much of a correction.
Still doesn't rule out Cody Lewis as a suspect.
WFB Welterweight Champion. Nineteen wins.
Fight fixing?
Blinding agents in the vaseline, stimulants in the water...
Yeah.
Well, it's only dirty if you make it dirty. You know, boxing's about discipline.
No, no, you know, it's mind and body.  Mind and body. If you train one and not the other you're half a person. What'd you find?
Oh, the spit bucket.
What's so funny?
This is coming from the same woman who processed fecal fat from a ruptured colon.
Want me to get that for you?
You're sure.
Looks like it was fight night for a lot of people.
Well, for starters, we need to see your hands.
Felix Trinidad is a fighter who was once accused of dipping his wraps in ice water before a fight. It turns the tape and gauze into a hardened cast. It's like punching with concrete.
A fighter's lost his life. We're just making sure that there was no unfair advantage. 
Brass, Brown. I need as much information as you can give me on a referee.
Occasionally found at a boxing match.
Your corner, your swab, your drugs.
Molina trains here?
It's kind of primitive. 
Yeah, we found sufentanil in a bottle of coagulant in the guy's kit.
I was thinking the same thing. I'm not convinced he actually knew it was in his kit. The prints that I got off the bottle came back to ... Gerry Barone, the victim's manager.
We found your prints on a bottle of coagulant. It was laced with a sedative. Found it in the cut man's kit.
By drugging him?
How bad?
Okay ... it's about a month ago at a pre-fight press conference.
Fast forward to the fight.  Watch his shoulder, how he keeps dropping it.
They say eight out of ten boxers suffer some form of brain damage later on in life.
He would never admit it. Fighters need to psych themselves up before a fight. They got to believe they're going to win. Or they'd never fight.
Pile it on.
Gloves look brand-new. Padding's still stiff. It's like they've never been used.
What are all these dots?
Looks like a little piece of red leather.
Well, Molina does take it for his stomach, right?
Hmm.
So you're saying if I find the vapor I find the mercury.
Grissom.
There was this one case where a boxer put lead shot in his gloves to increase his punching power. And also ancient greek limapulists used a glove weighted with metal, called a 'cestus.'
Yeah. I thought you'd like that.
Right.
All right. Normal gloves.  Ready.
Good?
Ready?
Ooh, these things are heavy.
Heavy gloves. That's why you kept your hands to your side. It also kept the mercury on the tip of your glove.
And into your lungs.
We didn't find mercury in your stomach. We found it in your locker, on your gym bags, on your wraps ...
But the real gloves were in your gym bag at that hospital, weren't they?
The best way to punish a guy is to beat him to death in the ring in front of two million people on pay-per-view.
Okay, all right, let's run this back again from the beginning. This time without the sound.
All right.
Stop.
Can you zoom in on his back?
What is that? A mole?
You think? Too bad, the b*st*rd.  This room is like a dime a dozen it could be anywhere in Vegas. Between the drapes can you get any other detail outside of that window?
That looks like a blob outside of the window. It's spherical.
The Stratosphere Tower. South face maybe? Using that Stratosphere Tower as a point of reference could you triangulate and pinpoint the street that this was filmed on?
We're going to need to talk to him.
What's up?
Somebody moved out all the furniture.
If they can't see it, we can't, huh?
Yeah, some people were just born bad. 
Do you anything about who painted Room 918?
You were in that snuff film.
Yeah, we saw you in the movie. You and your nice mole.
So when you came back in the room and you saw the blood on the wall did you think to call the police?
Damn, Security Guard was telling the truth. There is another guy there. He's almost one and three-quarter inches taller than the security guard.
That's because he's not behind it, he's in front of it.
I have enlarged and re-enlarged every frame. There's no tats, there's no birthmarks, nothing.
The film picks up everything there is to see, Catherine. We've seen everything.
What?
So there's more visual information on the negative.
There's the lamp I got from the lobby. The bulb is red ... in the film and here.
I guess he was going for a certain look.
You know, if I had screwed a hot light bulb I'd probably lick my fingers.
This is Sampson's car, right? Some soil up in his wheel well. He washed the tire and forgot the well.
Yeah. Remember that body dump a couple years back?
Down near the Colorado?
Brown.
Where?
Okay, I'll be right there.
Damn.
'Cause a beaker gets glass all over the place.
It's this curtain that the p0rn girl was found wrapped in. I've got no prints, no second donor. I've got nothing to link this p0rn guy to the girl's murder. It's just driving me nuts.
I'm sorry. Are you okay?
Really.
Well, a void proves that, but we still can't prove it's him.
Well, how are we going to get a sample of Sampson's blood?
Oh. I like that.
Hey, Sara.
You working that case where some mob beat up an Indian cab driver for hitting a kid?
You think it was racially motivated?
Yeah. We got to wait for the science, don't we?
That's the job. Good luck.
Uh, that's between me and my trainer.
A buck 95, give or take a doughnut.
I don't get paid enough to play dead.
You're such a drag.
Can I get up?
Hi, Judy.
Hey, I like it gentle, okay?
Thanks.
You want to tell me what's going on here?
You saw her dragging me around. You know, I'm glad I can help. I, uh, I'm late for the chiropractor's. I'll send you the bill.
There's only two reasons why people get murdered in a casino.
Quick escape. Murder Central. Security cameras?
I'll take the money trail.
Hey, girl.
What you got?
869? That's, like, two floors away from where she was found dead.
He's M.I.A., but he left a gambling paper trail.
I have a signature and a thumbprint from where Mr. Dominguez signed a
It was cash advance on a credit card. It's not cheap. It's, like $90 every thousand.
Not if you're desperate. He must have had a bad night.
Let's do it.
Yeah.
Stopped for gas in Barstow. Big tank. $43.
Ford explorer. California plates. Two-Paul-Charlie-Edward-329.
Yeah, this one looks like he was cut from the back.
What?
Who's that?
Don't tell me you opened your mouth to the guy.
Hey, man. You could lose your job over something like this.
Best thing you could do is go to Grissom and 'fess up.
Or what, you going to wait till he comes to you and then lie about it?
Need some help with that?
That weight on your shoulders.
Yeah. What's up?
Mm-hmm. I heard about that. He made his bones in Vegas. I mean, what do you expect? The guy's bulletproof.
Want to talk about it?
On who?
What'd you use as an exemplar?
That's why they kicked it.
Of what?
Do we have to do the inventory on all this?
Whoa.
I also found glitter on Mr. Dominguez.
Forget it. Ice destroyed it.
Definitely blunt force.
I'll swab the blood and see if it's all his.
Grissom?
Okay, one of our hammers had blood on it. It matches the victim's.
Yeah. Blood's a match, too.
Do you ever leave your tools at the job site?
The blood that we found on your hammer ... matches this kid right here.
Yeah. 
What about her?
He's got a non-confirmable alibi. I'm sure she doesn't want to lose the only guardian she's got.
Hey, Sanders, you got anything on that knuckle sludge? Grissom's asking.
Or he didn't do it alone.
Arcsine gives us 30 degrees.
That must be when his neck was exposed.
Well, if he was laying down, this looks too high to be a spatter.
Must be cast-off.
The shoe tread I found at the scene -- it's a world industries Diablo. It's a skate shoe. Size 11.
Screams 'teenager', I know.
Well, he has a teenage sister.
Nice kicks. I like those.
You guys play ball?
Yeah?
Nice backpack.
Brass. 
Check this out.
You think they know how a DNA test works?
Lift your right shoe, please.
We got a problem. The blood on your shoe is a match to Brian Haddick's.
DNA doesn't lie.
Mr. Lizzio, would you mind if I took a look around?
Practice makes perfect.
Did he roll?
Hmm.
It's hard to tell what's relevant and what's trash. This is everything we brought back from Benny's party room.
Benny's DNA doesn't match. Gregory's doesn't match. Ashley's doesn't match. Who did this guy hit?
Benny has a party room, right? You can't have a party without the music. I found some new CD's in his room.
It's like a music club, twelve CDs for the price of one.
The deejay maybe?
Oh, we talked to your mom.
Or what ... Dawg.
Jared ... ain't braces a bitch? I see that cut on your lip. Is that where Brian hit you? They do make for a good impression though.
See all these grooves here? It's perfect for storing DNA. That would be your DNA. Look, Jared, I'm not a cop, but if you tell me what happened, I will put in a good word for you.
Well, the Gilbert brothers both seem ready to go down for it.
Well, Benny, Aaron and Jared each had about $125 worth of cash and assorted prizes.
Well, Gregory Curtwell makes good money. Hundred twenty-five bucks is a spit in the ocean for a construction worker. If he wasn't defending his sister, then he has no motive.
Hey, Sara. Any jurors have blood on their hands?
That was Catherine.
Nuts. Specifically those that begin with a 'P.'
Take me out to the ball game.
There's peanut skins under Mr. Durham's seat.
Mr. Gibbons couldn't eat peanuts. What are they doing under his seat?
One auto-injector... used.
What do you want to bet he only brought one of these with him.
Ah, he was later held defenseless against the attack of the killer peanut.
What about peanut butter? 
In an individually wrapped tube?
Yeah, that's more than just messing with a guy's head.
Not if you can't explain to me how your fingerprints ended up on this peanut butter tube.
Stuffed inside a soda can. We found it in the jury room.
Mr. Gibbons will never get to experience the rest of his life.
So you decided to put it in his chili instead?
You had to know it was going to kill him.
Well, Miss Newsome, you are officially off of jury duty.
Well, that does go along with what the bride-to-be said about the victim. That he had a dermatological response to the allergen and not a respiratory one.
So the cause of death is still anaphylactic shock.
Which one?
Aw, that's too bad. This will be a day she'll never forget.
I got a lot. Check out the backseat.
Chocolate syrup, a six-pack of soda, a box of condoms.
Fresh bag of groceries in an unlocked car?
What do we got here? Pendale's milk. Non-fat. Half a gallon. Unopened.
No receipt? This milk expires on the 23rd.
Milk is delivered daily to the supermarket. That's a ten-day window. People usually reach back for a fresh one. Hmm ... subtract ten from the 23rd?
Well, according to Brass, that was the last time her boyfriend's car was seen out front.
You'd think that she restocked when she went shopping.
Nothing here.
I think I found the victim's internal organs.
This guy meant business.
We have the victim's clothes. Very neatly folded.
Well, if this is our boyfriend, then ... Brass is looking for a ghost.
Long-term parking at McCarran. Ran the plates. R.O.-- Dr. Michael Clark. The head of security is giving us a copy of the surveillance tape.
Well, it seems like that. You know what they say down at P.D. The quickest way to get a car stolen is to leave it at the airport unlocked.
See what I mean?
I know. Let's just superglue it, huh?
Well, he had to drive himself to the airport, right?
Whatever he put, he took it with him.
The black, plastic bag, maybe?
He missed a piece.
How tall was he? Five-nine, according to the DMV report?
Wow. I'm six-two, and this is more than enough room for me.
It's from Pendale's, the closest store in West Charleston.
She takes out her perishables first. She has to go back for second shifts, so she probably leaves the front door open.
She opens up a bottle of wine, two glasses.
Ha, ha. I've been sifting through this trash for about six hours. You coming to rescue me or make fun of me?
They must be from the spare bedroom because all the other carpets are green.
Look, all I know is that they were near the top of the bag, so it must have been one of the last things he vacuumed.
I did happen to find this butterfly pendant, with some white fibers on it.
It looks like a necklace or a bracelet and it has this link that snaps, so I'm thinking ... sign of struggle?
It's Warrick. I have something for you. I found a butterfly link with some white fibers on it.
In the vacuum bag. You check all the rooms?
All right.
Is this house abandoned?
Fangs? Come on.
Then where's all the blood?
I'm going to take a look around.
Catherine, take a look at this. 
Please tell me that's not blood.
Well, we know one thing for sure. This place wasn't vacant. 
Well, let's just say evidence at the crime scene suggests occult, ritualistic activity.
You check out her fangs?
The ankh. Egyptian symbol for eternal life. I went on-line and found out it's also the universal insignia for vampires.
Well, the shoulder area is rich in blood, right? Heals quickly?
I figure, if you're going to drink someone's blood, it's a good place to start.
Who's the guy?
When was the last time you saw Angela?
Blood bar?
And I guess you girls don't do that?
Which is ... ?
Isn't absinthe illegal?
Like a blood bar.
We're into crime scenes.
Did Angela Sommerville call you that?
What about Daegonna?
Did she offer herself to you last night?
Absinthe?
How 'bout murder? Daegonna was killed last night.
'Psi'?
We're going to need that pendant for evidence.
Damn. 
Angela's parents only insisted upon only one thing ...
We're from the crime lab. We're here about a Miss Angela Sommerville. Last month, your clinic tested her blood.
We have a warrant.
Now, what's this blood doing in there?
Catherine, I think we have all we need here.
How did her blood end up in your fridge?
Oh, so you're the real thing?
You mean she offered her blood to you?
How you want us to handle this, Grissom?
Barely cleared the holster.
Not quick enough.
You know, this guy hit a $75 jackpot. Probably shoving quarters in his pockets when this whole thing went down.
You know, after the MGM grand fire, they found people fused to slot machines. Never even made it out of their seats. This guy probably thought it was his lucky day. I'm sure he wasn't going to leave without his money.
Hey.
There's no exit wound?
Skin's thicker on the back. Captured the bullet.
Is there something wrong with tweezers?
Officer Clay's one shot went into the floor. The bullet fragmented. That's probably how that kid got hit. But Officer Fromansky's beretta and that suspect's tec-9, they both had hollow .9 millimeters. Between the two of them, they shot off 18 rounds.
Grissom, we got a problem.
We've identified all the bullets recovered at the scene. There's no evidence of a third gunmen. It gets worse. The bullet that killed the cocktail waitress -- it came from Fromansky's gun.
He fired four. That accounts for those shots.
Well, those four shots were definitely meant for him.
Well, Fromansky was turning when he fired so his shots were spread out.
Which means Fromansky fired four shots at a target at the back of the store.
Yeah.
A little over. Perfect.
Let's say I'm Fromansky. 
There's nothing between Fromansky and the cocktail waitress. I got a clean view and a clear shot.
Four shots on a level spread. He was shooting at a moving target.
We have the surveillance tape. Shows nothing going on here before, during or after the robbery.
You can see me now, right?
All right.
I'm still in?
A getaway.
We found metal paint scrapings and skid marks. Both recent on that loading dock. These guys definitely had a wheelman.
Except Fromansky.
Popular color.
I'll put out a broadcast. Thanks, Hodges.
Ph 13. Sodium hydroxide.
Yeah? Maybe he can tell us who.
I got this off the jacket from your apartment. What the hell is this?
Congratulations. You passed.
Hallickey's got no connection to the grocery store. He was just the wheel man. Even, still, he's looking at four counts of felony murder. But he's not talking. He lawyered up.
It wasn't in his apartment. Maybe somebody else took it.
There's no way to tell who. The store runs off of an old PBX system, and every call that comes in goes back to the same number. Every employee was near a phone, so, it could have been anybody.
You know, Hodges already analyzed trace on the bullets.
He'll take it personally.
No.
Black fibers. Probably synthetic. Mixed in with the wool. If their gunman was wearing a black polyester jacket ... 
You may have just saved Fromansky's ass.
Bling-bling.
You think?
Tell us how you really feel, Catherine.
Well, not this day.
Looks like it was just the two of them.
Brown.
You on the East Coast looking for a sunset?
You're at the wrong gate. Drive back down the road, make three lefts. When you get to the main gate, speak to Officer Ray and tell her you're with the crime lab. When you get to the scene, make sure I'm the first person you speak to.
You just get off a shift?
You look like a man who just rolled out of bed. You all right?
T-shirt, sneakers. You're already a half hour late. Grissom will rip you a new one if he sees you like that.
Yeah, it's not a rebel game. It's a crime scene. See, this is what I'm talking about right here. 
The battery's not changed kit's open. It's not stocked; no swabs. Did you sterilize your equipment after your last case?
See, you know when I'm on call because my clothes are folded next to my bed. Shoes, jacket, ball cap, bottle of water, pen, paper, Thomas Guide, next to the phone. That way, if I get a call at 3:00 in the morning, I'm not scrambled. Everything's there before the phone rings. My game is tight, like my trunk. Check it out. 
Camera case, tripod, film is in the fridge. Markers, check. Extra field kit, fully stocked, sterilized. Shoeprint lift kit, wet weather gear. Files 'mama.' Forms for days. First call form, first officer form, consent to search, bird's eye view inside, bird's eye view outside. It's down to how I like my lunch. Picking up what I'm putting down?
You've been told.
Now, the first order of business is to kill the Trents. Then the suspects go upstairs and rip off laurel's jewelry.
Yeah, but I'm thinking, in a neighborhood like this, if you burn rubber out of here, it's gonna cause a lot of attention. If you roll quietly away on a bike, though ...
This is the resident gate that Greg called me from; he couldn't get in. He needed a code.
Does citrus illuminate?
I've got ANTs. Not the insect.
-- Trisulfonic acid.
Let me check it out. The ants should make it light up under the ALS.
One, three ... five and six. In some configuration. They had the code.
Can't believe that there's this many abandoned bikes in Charleston Hills. These were found in the alley behind the fire department, so check them out.
So we may have our getaway bikes.
You know what? I got an idea.
Get me a pair of tweezers, will you?
Well, I used to read point spreads. Now I read books. 
Did you report it?
By whom?
Something wrong with your neck?
Just like Mike Trent.
How's your hands?
I got to hand it to these casinos. They got it all figured out.
Well, this is a ten thousand dollar brick, right?
I could either lose this in a hand of blackjack, or I could lose cranberry chip. What's worse?
Sara? 
I'm working, lady.
Oh, yeah?
Were you working him?
Really?
This guy get here on foot? I don't see a car.
I suppose nobody saw it drive away.
Nice shoes.
What drug is he on?
Hey, Vanilla Ice ... at this point you're lookin' at a murder rap, which may end you up on death row, and I'm not talking about the record label.
Was that a confession?
Well, the blood spatter's consistent with a front end collision.
Doesn't mean he didn't kill him. What I want to know is how's a strung-out junkie like Jamal get a guy out of the car with just his knife?
Well, let's just say for argument's sake that Jamal is telling the truth and that Burnell was already dead when he took his wallet, his shoes and his car.
Maybe this'll tell us.
Man, there is something so heartbreaking about a woman with raggedy drawers.
Grissom, we've gone through all of Mindy's stuff twice. There's no trace of blood.
Burnell?
That'd make her a bag-bride ... a strawberry. Paid her rent horizontally. As long as a dealer keeps a strawberry high, the strawberry does whatever the dealer wants.
Yeah, old Ed gets enough people in the 'hood clean, you get no love.
It's her choice, right?
What do you want to do, take her to lock up?
Helter-skelter.
We have the murder weapon. He was stabbed in the chest.
Oh, yeah. Stabbed in the chest and the back.
Detective, I got your page.
So do I.
Mr. Samuels, I'm Warrick Brown. I'm from the crime lab.
His brother was murdered.
Did you know him?
So, why did you go out?
When was the last time you talked to your brother?
Mr. Samuels, we found your prints on the knife used to kill Adanto Adams.
But you didn't call 9-1-1. Or the police. You just took off?
Where's his parents now?
Well, you'll get plenty of that now.
Uh ... 'P-A... L...' Oh, the Palms. I know what this is. It's a receipt for a marker.
For ten grand.
Did he have some kind of a system?
Can I get a copy of that footage?
Maybe just on a case. How about that footage?
Archie?
Roll it. Now, according to the pit boss, the kid was playing a double-up system. What I want to know is, how many hands did he back himself up?
Yeah, that's the classic double-up system. 
Go back out wide.
Tenth bet, $51,200. Adanto has 20. He sticks. She has two up. Another two, and thats four. Two, three, two. That's eleven. Ace, ace, ace, ace. Fifteen. Six.
The record's an eleven-card twenty-one. That was back in '78.
Try to chase back the 102.
He lost it all.
He swallowed his loss.
How much?
Who are the signatories?
What? You knew about this?
I'm going to need, uh, a sample of ... of your handwriting. Also need a sample from Zero.
Yes.
Just tell me who's lying.
Well, then who did? Adanto?
How's the knife handle coming?
That would be glossy, right?
What's house paint doing on a knife handle?
Loser.
So, what are you getting at?
How else are you going to stab a guy?
Guy comes into town, convinces his brother to invest in some two-bit double-up system, ends up losing his life savings in a ten-card twenty-one. In a word: Desperate.
Desperation.
I'm afraid so.
Unfortunately, the coroner is going to rule the case a suicide ... and not a homicide, which makes that policy worthless.
I'm sorry.
Maybe he wasn't beaten with a weapon.
I know this guy's yoked. He's what? 6'2'? 6'3'?
Damn.
Gris, what are you hoping to find here?
Well, Greg ran the DNA. The blood on Walter's clothes is a match to Tony. The hair in Tony's hands is a match to Walter's. This case is closed, isn't it?
We can't prosecute a dead man.
Shakespeare?
Whew. This guy never threw anything away. You think he had a major case of OCD? 
Yeah, well, in the real world, Walter's the threat. Guess he didn't like what he saw.
Hey, Grissom.
This doesn't look like a patio.
Only one thing makes that sound.
It's a wedding band.
Next to no tissue. No hairs at all. To get the bones, what do you think, Grissom? Been down here at least three years?
There's something under the pelvic bone.
You think we could still get any DNA off of it?
There's no skin, clothing or tissue to protect it.
Female traits.
What about her race?
Caucasian.
How old are we talking?
So that would put her in her late teens, early 20s.
Cause of death?
What about these right here?
So maybe she was punched in the face and tried to shield herself?
Yeah, but is it our missing waitress?
Okay.
Okay, you can take this.
'And baby makes three.'
Jack's an arson investigator. We were here on this same street ten days ago. 
I don't know, but I'm keeping my eyes peeled. Maybe they came back to take a look.
That would explain why the firemen didn't find her right away.
This door's unlocked.
Well, this could be how Sabrina got in. Comes home late, forgets to lock the door behind her. It's an opportunity waiting to happen.
Uh, couple of weak partials. What you got, partner?
You know the fire down the street was in the garage.
Lighter fluid from the garage.
This is home video from the first fire.
Well, they say arsonists often commit crimes where they feel most familiar. The last fire was set during the day in the garage when the family was out of town.
Or when the door was left unlocked.
Well, a match was found at the first fire. If we could find a match in the debris of the second fire, then we may know for sure.
Let's run her.
According to Catherine, Jessica Abernathy had major credit card debt but minimal insurance-not even enough to cover what she had. Besides, people tend to remove mementos when they know what's coming.
Why, what'd they do?
It makes sense if the fire was unintentional.
Well, we think we might have figured out what caused the fire. Ms. Abernathy, does anyone in your house smoke?
Sabrina maybe?
Ma'am, earlier you provided us with a urine sample. We found traces of nicotine in yours.
Really? Would you mind opening your purse for me?
Nick's girlfriend.
Well, who's there? Grandma? I mean aside from being on lockdown, she's arthritic. I don't see her writing on the floor. What about Jessica?
That brings us back to Sabrina.
What are you saying, she's on a kamikaze mission? Trying to take the whole family down with her?
Oh, yeah.
Let's just hope that whomever wrote it touched something else.
Well, that's good shooting.
I've got some smudges over here, too.
Hey, Sam. 
You okay?
So tell me, what kind of things you like to do on the weekends?
Like to play with matches?
Why is that?
Yeah.
You ever have trouble sleeping at night?
Is that what happened Saturday?
Couldn't go back to bed?
What'd you find?
Purple jelly?
Did you eat it?
That sounds like fun.
Oh ... that must've made you mad.
So, what happened next?
Then what?
You like when the firemen come?
You know, Sam ... that word that you wrote on the floor ... 
you know, that's a really bad word.
No sign of forced entry ... on this door, at least.
Yeah.
If the killer went out the back door, this may be his print.
Good thing Brass had cops watching the house. 
Either way, they were sick and dangerous.
I'll hear it when you give me a dub of the original caller's voice ... and his phone number.
Good.
Yeah.
Mm ... have you run a sample of this through the GCMS?
Polyethylene. I got the results back from Grissom's ant puddle.
Corn syrup, glucose, caramel and water.
On top of the file cabinet.
So, what's up? You and Bobby switched or what?
Hey, Rich, whatever happened with those bullets?
Consistent with officer commons and Officer Nowlin's weapons?
Well, thanks.
Yeah?
Polyethylene and corn syrup is... cola in a bottle.
So, that shooter was sitting on the house and the surveillance team. 
Empties out his bottle of soda... calls in an 'officer down' ... ...drops the phone and takes a walk.
Check it out.
I have never heard a citizen that calm. This 911 caller knew the drill. He's using Officers code. 'J' becomes john. 'O' becomes ocean. J.O.--
I'm only halfway home. I need a voice exemplar. Did you get a name off that badge?
Drinks?
Hold on.
Oh, no, no. Okay, okay. Drinks at my place.
Fromansky didn't make that call, Gris.
This guy's a nut job vigilante. He's making the whole department look bad.
Yeah, lots of times ... what about you?
He check in alone?
Looks like it's all his stuff. I don't see a purse around here. Guy's away from home, unwinds with some opportunity s*x ...  Looks like he came before he went.
Any good cop keeps one racked in the chamber. Two bullets, two bodies.
I'm thinking straight-up murder/suicide.
What happened? Break the bad news to the wife?
Women always know, huh?
I think so. Women always know when the man is straying.
No. I'm a really nice guy.
Well, you need to believe this. There was one bullet in each of the bodies. They both came from the glock. And the prints on the glock are from a female, so it's still looking like a murder/suicide.
Lydia Lopez -- the girl next door.
Yeah. Her clothes are still here. But I guess if you offed two people, you're not going to stick around to pack.
So, Manny and Lydia were boning. How does Patricia Fielding fit in?
So, let's say three of them were going at it. How did two out of three end up dead?
Well, someone was pissed. This is, like, a two- $300 la Perla Nightie, ripped to shreds.
It's not designed to stay on that long.
Yeah.
Manny was wearing a ring. Was Lydia Lopez married?
For what?
Your prints were found in your wife's hotel room, including the doorknob to the adjoining room.
Are you still drunk?
Well, it takes a lot of drinking to forget a murder. I didn't kill anyone.
So, where did you go then?
We're going to need your clothes.
Ditto on his personal effects. But I know Archie was in Manny's room because he has Manny's luggage tag. Guy wants to find out who was sticking it to his wife.
Yeah.
He called this number six times.
The last call was twelve minutes.
I hate these cases.
And someone dumped her face up.
I guess the rain would've washed away any trace evidence: Tire prints, shoe impressions.
Guess it wasn't worth the killer's time.
Ma'am, the coroner believes that Tessa died over twenty-four hours ago. Had you reported her missing?
When was the last time that you saw her?
When's the last time you went twenty-four hours without talking to Lindsey?
I'm just saying, she didn't check on her own kid, you know?
It looks like there's soil inside of her wound.
Right. Should be soil around the wound. And on the wound, but not inside of it.
Hey.
Tessa Press took the bus to and from school, not far from here.
I showed her picture to the mini-mart manager. She remembers seeing her the day that she was killed.
She says she came in every afternoon and bought a little Debbie and a soda.
Officer Ray did speak with Carrie and her parents, and they confirmed that Tessa sleeps at least two nights a week over their place.
I don't think they had any kind of a schedule. She would just show up, and when she didn't, they'd assumed that she was at home.
I've already secured the footage.
I found Tessa.
Yeah.
I've been looking for you.
Hodges analyzed the trace from inside Tessa's wound.  It seems it was zoodoo.
Hoof stock. It's a combination of feces from rhinos, zebras, and bison.
They say that the smell of wild animal crap keeps the deer away.
There is a zoo in Auckland that exports it. And there's only one landscaping company in Clark County that imports it -- ADL. I contacted ADL, and guess what they told me? Couple of months back, they were hired by the victim's mother.
Hey. Could I have a word with you outside for a moment?
Why not?
Did you pick her up that afternoon?
You mind if I take a look in the back of your truck? 
Only if you deny me access.
Thanks.
In 1988, your client was arrested for a drunk and disorderly. Your fingerprints were then entered into our database. They match the fingerprints that we found on this shovel.
They were the only prints on the shovel.
That's possible. But your client's fingerprints provided a sufficient basis for a warrant to search her vehicle. 
The choice of weapon and the manner of disposal suggest that this was not a premeditated murder.
Guy hits the jackpot, has to celebrate. Goes and buys some bling-bling to impress the strippers with.
What have you got?
Air conditioned socks.
Well, he's been worked over pretty good. He's got a nice fat lip.
It's copper-washed lead. Must be a .22.
Nice.
Any idea what might have caused that kind of damage?
Maybe a ball peen hammer.
They used to tell me back in the days, the first time you got caught cheating, they'd give you a couple whacks on the hand with a ball peen hammer.
The second time, you'd lose a limb.
A long walk in the desert with a shovel.
As far as I could tell, it's a wireless receiver. It picks up a signal, solenoids drive the points up against the guy's foot, tells him what number to bet.
I don't know. Archie's working on it right now.
It's freezing in here.
Get a load of this wheel. It's regulation. These things run about 1,500 bucks.
Yeah.
These guys definitely had a system.
Looks like the roommate's home after all.
Two taps to the head. Deja vu.
You find any shoes back there?
Blood smear here.
That's ridiculous. Why bother?
Have a distinctive white mark on his right shoulder.
What do you make of that?
Look, uh, it could be right.
Can you make sure that gets to trace?
Hey, what're you doing, touching that? You got gloves?
Yeah.
Grissom, I have been in Vegas my whole life. I've known guys who counted cards, hedged bets, crushed a poker table with a lowball pair. I've seen guys beat the house with their hands ... but never with their toes.
I was reading about these silicon valley types in the '80s called the ... eudaemonic enterprises. Have you heard of them?
They say they figured out a way to beat the roulette wheel. Not through a betting system, but through physics.
Well, they say that every roulette wheel is a little different. Tilt, wobble, bounce ...
So, the guy with the transmitter does the calibration, clocks the position of the ball, ... 
... hits the switch ... 
... and the computer does the rest.
Plays out the spin in milliseconds, ... 
... predicts the result, ... 
... and then transmits a code to the receiver about where that ball will land.
This setup gives you a 44-percent advantage over the house. For every hundred these guys bet, they're pulling in $2,200 an hour.
Your boys right here -- Teddy and Davis, the candid camera.
Judging from what we found in your apartment, looks like you made their idea work.
The Tangiers, Pike's, Rampart ... these are all Sam Braun's places. You got something against him?
Your gear ...  What was your cut?
Yeah, picture that!
Handle your scandal.
Anything distinctive?
Yeah.
You still liking Braun for these murders?
I'm thinking Seth Landers and his pals had a woody for him. I went back to the Rampart, and I took some electronic noise measurements. The place is a mess of interference. Electronics in old casinos aren't shielded.
Definitely. A kid as smart as Seth wouldn't make a mistake like that.
Sir, could you tell us about Seth Landers?
Sam Braun do that with a hammer?
The test fire matches the bullet found in Teddy Keller's body.
Yeah, we found our murder weapon. I don't know the kid thinks up this elaborate scheme to cheat the casinos. Then he kills his partners. But he dumps his gun at his dorm?
No, it's a small caliber weapon for an up-close-and-personal hit. I don't really see the kid pulling a Gotti.
Well, maybe he ran out of ammo. Went back and bought another brand.
The bullets that were found in Teddy Keller's skull, were copper washed cci .22s.
But that would mean that Davis Mullins was killed in the apartment before Teddy Keller was killed in the graveyard. The timeline's off.
No. Where did you go after Teddy Keller was taken?
Okay, you don't have to talk to me. But you got to know you're looking at two counts of murder.
Then talk to me. Tell me what happened. Where did you go? For real.
We found the murder weapon that was used to kill your two partners. It was wrapped in your bloody t-shirt. Can you tell me about that?
It was found outside of your campus apartment.
Unless you clear it up.
Are you trying to tell me that your own father set you up?
So you went after Sam Braun to prove something to your old man.
Does your father own a .22?
I got nothing.
You think he cleaned up?
Nice and new in here.
Sherwin Williams, latex flat. Navajo white. What do you know.  Same as the paint on the shirt.
What's in the bag, 'dad'?
That blood could match the stains we found on Davis' shirt. I don't understand why he had to kill his kids. They were making a lot of money off of Braun. Dad was getting his revenge.
Why settle for the money, when you can frame up your worst enemy for murder.
Victim was a 32-year-old Caucasian female, Emma Dobbins. Sexually assaulted.  Cause of death, strangulation. They used her pantyhose.
Off of Blue Diamond Road, Southern Highlands. 
Other than the semen, the only evidence at the scene was a shoe print-- man's size nine. I talked to Nick. They also found a print-- size nine.
A Vintage Pontiac. Registered in her name, never recovered.
Emma Dobbins ran a movie memorabilia place downtown.
Emma was married.
She was brunette. The only thing in common: the guy who raped them.
Due for what?
That won't be necessary.
Whew, man. Guys like Brass have it easy. All they got to do is call it in.
You saw this? A pin from the Palms. Linley Parker worked at the Palms.
What a night. You guys hungry? Want to get something to eat?
I feel ya. Get some rest.
Smudges. Nothing but smudges. Doesn't anybody use formica anymore?
Hey, hold up.
Hey, David. Give me a minute and let me clear a path here, okay?
All right.
There's at least four weeks of mail here, Grissom.
Turns a grape into a raisin.
She tried to claw her way out.
Hey, Griss. 
Don't you think this is kind of odd? A woman who spends the time making tea like this leaves a chunk of chocolate cake on the counter.
Yeah. Some crack head brutalizes an old lady, leaves her in a closet, and grabs a snack on the way out.
Autopsy ruled those premortem. At least a day old. It was a close shot, non-contact, downward angle. No primer residue on the hands. T.O.D. was approximately 2:00 A.M. No one found the body until 7:00 A.M. A lot of wind ... 
I got to go see my mummy.
Yeah? You know what rolls downhill?
Come on, you got a lot of new skills to master. Field work's a little messier than your test tubes and your GCMS.
One continuous motion, nice and easy.
That's not bad. Keep practicing. Nine more to go.
Hey.
Nothing spells excitement like a B and E.
We don't.
If you're out to rob somebody's house, why would you do it when they're home?
Can you generate a composite?
The guy with the closet fixation is Steve Jansson.
Them's fightin' words. Did he get his man?
Well, that probably hurt business.
No. It's a non-contact wound at a downward angle. It's a textbook murder.
Doesn't explain how the gun left the scene.
Just to toss it in suburbia a week later?
What's in the scope?
You got a theory?
Yeah.
Hey, hey, hey.
What is that you just threw in there?
You know that piece of half-eaten shark with cake that Gris and I found at the old lady Maddie's house? This is from the same restaurant.
Same night as the home invasion. Signed by LINDA KIRKWOOD. Dinner for one.
Same Restaurant ...
So both women came in alone?
I kind of doubt that a clean-cut guy like Ryan is hanging out with snaggletooth Steve.
We know Jansson's partner knew the customers at the restaurant.
Jose Cortez. Worked at the Wilson Street Grill from '93 to '94.
We were so close, you don't even know.
Yeah.
Probably safer than anything else I had planned. Yeah.
Loses his manhood. Guess he thought he had nothing left to live for.
On a windy night, a balloon can go for miles.
You with me?
Oh, yeah.
Super came in and checked the a/c and he found him like this. Wesley Jones. 33. His massage chair. No signs of forced entry.
Small bruise on the fingertip, but no outward signs of trauma.
Diet shake, fitness magazines, cookie crumbs on a baking sheet. This guy's trying to start a diet or falling off one?
Sounds like a heat stroke to me.
There's no tenting. So he wasn't dehydrated. No, heat stroke.
What about drugs?
Heart attack?
I've run out of questions.
Oh, you sectioned off that fingertip bruise.
The skin cells look stressed out.
He was electrocuted. But how come there's no burn marks?
And a point of contact.
These wires are all insulated. No burn marks. Current didn't pass through this chair.
What you got?
Is there any sign of electrical surging?
I like surprises.
Bingo. Look at that. Current went through the phone.
Heat lightning. Storm rolls through the desert, sometimes it strikes in town.
This look like a myth to you?
Strike map from the national lightning detection network.
This is Vegas in yellow. 
Hasn't had a lightning strike in three days.
All I got is a fried phone.
If the phone wasn't the way in, maybe it was the way out.
Yes.
This about it?
Okay ... now, electricity is fickle, right?
One centimeter can mean the difference between a little zap and dead. 
So, let's assume that the current went out through his right index finger and the phone. For it to cross his heart, it must've come from the left side of his body, right?
His bare foot touched the floor.
Path of least resistance.
Found this mineral residue that led all the way from the massage chair to this burnt-out power strip across the room ... water stain.
I also found them on the cookie sheet and this water-damaged magazine right here. And I found this plastic bag in the kitchen garbage.
Add that with the fan, you got yourself a homemade swamp cooler.
Guy was just trying to stay cool.
Hey.
Yeah. I got an AFIS hit. Robert Pitt. Court-ordered to AA after a DUI.
If I had to walk around dressed like Rocky Raccoon, I'd be drinking, too. I don't get this whole thing.
I hear you. Take a look at this.
Yeah, it's synthetic, not natural.
Did I miss a memo or something?
He's got you pushing his paperwork, huh?
Really?
You got to have money to go to college these days.
Well, that's at least two thousand students. Maybe you'll get lucky with the victim's prints.
Freshman in a sophomore course?
I searched the vehicle at the CSI garage. I discovered the knife under the passenger's seat.
Yes, it is.
Michael Fife, the defendant.
The knife was wrapped in a white towel. Both the towel and the knife were caked with dried blood.
I swabbed the blood and sent a sample to the DNA lab. The lab technician ran the sample through CODIS. The DNA sample was a match to a recent rape and homicide victim, Rachel Lyford.
That's correct. 
Yes, it is.
Yes, that's correct.
I received a call from Officer Watson. He informed me that he had pulled the defendant over to cite him for a broken taillight. After running his plates, it was discovered that the defendant had an outstanding warrant for drugs. He then arrested Mr. Fife and ordered a respond and tow. At which point, he asked me to search the vehicle for drugs. That's when I found the knife.
Officer Watson would have secured the warrant prior to calling me.
No.
We've been completely blind-sided here.
You got to be kidding me.
I found the knife. I processed the knife. I presented the knife. All you had to do was the paperwork.
If you'd've followed protocol, our suspect would be going to trial.
What about what you said about never rushing evidence?
Nice to finally meet you, too, Sheriff.
Yeah.
Impound towed the vehicle to the garage. Michael Fife's outstanding warrant was for marijuana possession, so that's what I was looking for.
I swabbed the knife and I sent the blood sample to Greg.
Yeah, Rita. They were real close. Lived together up until a couple months ago. These stab wounds look like they're limited to the neck and upper torso area, huh?
Noted. What is this foreign substance on her wrist?
Bringing your laundry to work again, David?
Great. I'm here about one Rachel Lyford. You prepped her body?
It's mine now. You notice this foreign substance on her wrists?
Trace. Thanks. You're the man. Have fun.
How'd you know that I was...
Hodges, why'd you leave L.A. Again? Never mind, it's probably none of my business.
Yeah?
I don't blame her.
You came all the way over here for dog tags?
Mm-hmm. Check it out.
Dr. Robbins found consistent abrasions on the back of her neck, so ... that's probably your chain.
All right.
What do you got?
Need a hand?
Done.
You know, the steak knife I found in that car matches that set.
Five's an odd number of steak knives.
Perhaps.
Grissom, what do you make of this? We noted a similar type substance on the girl's wrists.
What?
It's just that new evidence is coming in and the old evidence hasn't even been processed yet. We're running out of time here, you know?
Well, not even you can stop time.
Jacqui Franco.
Tell me you've found something probative.
Oh, wicked. You know, in the pretrial interview, fife denied ever being in the victim's apartment.
Thank you.
Several hours ago, we found blood-stained threads in the back of your client's car. DNA ran the blood. It is consistent with Rachel Lyford's. It is admissible into evidence.
Your client's fingerprints were on a beer bottle collected from the victim's trash.
Yeah. Hi.
I'm doing everything I can.
Actually, it's the first break I've had since court, so, if you'll excuse me, I have a lot of work to do.
What's up with what?
This job is hard enough without having victims' families up in your face.
You want to hold this girl's hand, that's fine by me. That seems to be your M.O., but when you empathize instead of sympathize, I don't judge you.
You know what? Lunch is over. Time to go back to work.
Hey.
I'm fine.
Yeah.
Oh, god, I'm sorry.
Oh, god ... Oh ... 
This case is twisting me up. Interrogation room ... was a bust. Fife can lie better than I can tell the truth.
I don't think it's going to trial.
I'm not giving up. I'm just being realistic.
I like that.
Great.
I suggest you avoid him.
Yeah. Recently separated. His wife moved back to Albuquerque. And no one else had access to his vehicle.
No sign of forced entry.
I didn't notice, but I wasn't looking.
Yeah. Fife's an electrician. I doubt he would come into contact with that at work.
Yeah, then he'll petition Judge Brenner for fife's immediate release.
We've got, what, less than seven hours. Let's not pull any punches. If the evidence is leading us away from Fife, I say we go with it.
Could be.
What car wash?
I just talked to the manager. Of course, he didn't recognize Fife from the six pack of photos. We're still cleared to look around.
I'm sure the attendant would have told him something. They're liable, right?
Yeah, you'd get pulled over for that pretty quickly.
The fragments have to run off through some kind of drain, right?
All right, sassy.
A broken taillight.
Hey, could two cars get too close to each other and have an accident in here?
So, Rachel hired you to wax her car, is that it?
And your story is that Rachel came on to you?
You freaked. So, you killed her.
Your client went from Rachel's apartment to his job at the car wash. He took the knife with him. A few hours later, Michael Fife drove in, and he planted the knife in his car.
It wasn't a coincidence. It was your lucky day. You recognized the parking permit in his car window.
You recognize these?
The name on the dog tags is Aaron Lyford. That's Rachel's father.
She gave them to you.
Why did you try to hide them?
Why did you take off to the bathroom with the dog tags on? And you came back with them missing. 
So, I checked it out.
This is an autopsy photo.
The abrasions are evidence. Those dog tags were ripped from her neck.
The defendant arrived at the station on his own accord. He provided us with a sample of his DNA, and we rushed that sample to our lab for analysis.
Yes, that's correct. It was a match.
I'm terribly sorry for your loss. And your father's tags are in a safe place. I'll make sure they get back to you.
You're more than welcome.
Sheriff, I'm not too good with cameras.
Grissom, thanks.
See you back at the lab.
She a guest? Or a guest of a guest?
Does Myles know?
Got a wine bottle. 
Almost empty.
Alcohol. Hot tub. A little bit too relaxed.
It just dawned on me what's Rueben's biggest hit was.
'Amelia.'
She was only 25. Was there some kind of defect?
It's like a mystery of the heart.
Rueben's manager? Amelia was butt-naked in the hot tub. What was he doing in her room tweaking dials? 
She was poisoned. That would explain her heart attack.
Mr. Hopkins, could you answer the question, please.
But you must admit, the boss' wife, naked in a hot tub, looks kind of funky.
So, you'd do just about anything for him then?
That's what we're trying to find out.
I got your page. You'd be a good maitre d'. Checking glassware for spots?
Including hydrofluoric acid, huh?
So, somebody did spike the wine.
We just want to know what happened the other night. Did you open the bottle for her?
'Mutt'?
Did you ever see them fight?
Thanks.
Which side do you want?
It's a nice place.
You could record a whole album in this studio.
This guy's got it made.
Wouldn't be isolated. You'd have a butler, a maid service, laundry service.
Sheet music. Guy writes his own stuff.
Dishwashing gloves. Dry erase markers.
Slate Industrial Glass Cleaner.  The ingredients -- distilled water and hydrofluoric acid. Fatal if swallowed.
Do you recognize this product?
Don't you have a maid or someone to do that for you?
But you have had fights in the past.
Sure.
Well, there's a man who definitely has his priorities straight.
I've got burns. You first. Sam or Myles?
This should just take a second. Could you give me her right hand, please?
This is not a murder. It's a suicide.
You shouldn't blame yourself for this.
It's your call.
It sucked. I hate lawyers, I hate court. They all need to dry up and die.  Hi.
Yeah.
Thank you. Thank you so much. And you are?
Good luck.
Nice to meet you.
Good luck.
All right.
Well, there's what blew your fuse.
Not always.
You think it's a suicide?
Yeah, he's got some old school suicide scars.
For inspiration or for last rites?
Pack of cigarettes, sweetener, and a hot dog wrapper.
I wouldn't be so sure.
You know how long I've played here and I've never gotten laid?
Good.
Tricks are for kids, man. I don't play games anymore.
I'm working on a case. Did anyone hit a big jackpot here yesterday?
50 g?
Did he look like this?
Do you remember about what time that was?
Really?
Funkier than James Brown, huh?
Good to see you, man.
What time did the super say the electricity went out?
12:30? How does a broke-ass guy like lance lose fifty grand in thirty minutes?
Well, they say gamblers are creatures of habit. I bet you lance did the same thing every day. Win or lose. I'm going to need to take a walk in this guy's shoes.
Hey, captain.
Do you sell Clark cigarettes?
Really?
Is this the other guy?
Hey, pop. Like the buddha said to the monk, make me one with everything.
Were you working last night?
Who does?
Really? Would you happen to know where this punk kid lives?
Clear!
Whoo! Would you look at the size of this flat screen? My lord, that's a whole month of my pay right there. A new playstation? A brand-new stereo?
You must have sold a lot of hot dogs last night, huh?
Did you get that from Lance? You know, your old friend. Did you sell a lot of hot dogs him?
Take this guy out of here.
Hey.
To bust some heads.
You think the cops used excessive force here?
Yeah.
Arresting officer must have done a lousy search.
Overflowing toilet. There's enough ammunition right there.
Well, there must have been some real bad asses in here. Looks like it got pretty heated.
Thirty-five guys, that's a lot of men to fit in one room.
You ever think an overcrowded cell mixed with bad plumbing was the reason they threw the contents?
Don't you search them again when they get to the holding cell?
Don't you search them again when they get here?
A gun in a cell is sloppy police work, man.
Then maybe you need to dial down your attitude. A man is brain dead here! I don't care what he was like when he was alive, and neither should you, don't you think?
If I find out you used excessive force on an unarmed prisoner, you won't have a jail.
I don't think so. Not quite. I'm going to need your armor, your shields, your boots and your batons.  Right now!
Okay.
A gun ... face shields, vests ... batons ... please run the batons first.
Well, the batons were the only weapons inside of the cell. Everything else was fixed ...
... to the floor, to the walls.
No.
Oh, now I'm a 'player'. You make up your mind pretty quick.
Yeah?
He was a rough one last night, so I called to check on him. But since I'm here, I can do it in person. Anything else you want to say to me?
Is that it?
No.
Good day.
Aw, it looks good on you.
So what's up?
Really. I wonder what for.
There was nothing to say. We had words, it got heated, then it was over.
Yeah, I really don't see what the big deal is. I mean, I remember talking to Grissom ...
Okay. Is there anything else?
Written or verbal?
Sure.
Well, I compared all thirty-four pairs -- I came up with one sole pattern ...  ... and one suspect -- Vincent Mendoza ... booked for meth manufacture.
Well, it's not unreasonable to think the same guy that caused the blunt force trauma can also stomp him.
Yeah, well, this victim looks like the perfect patsy to drop a gun on.
Your client killed a man in a holding cell and tried to frame the cops for it.
He dropped the weapon down his pants, planned to get rid of it in Central Holding before the cavity search.
Well, I'm sure Vincent here knew a lot of people inside since he is a repeat offender. But only one man didn't fit, huh? Fear must've been rolling off him in waves so strong you could probably smell it.
Well, it's good to know, since your boot prints were found on the victim's head.
It's not likely, unless you can explain how Vincent here got his pubic hair and feces caught in the gun's hammer.
How's twenty-five to life sound?
I didn't see any skid marks on the road up there. There's no signs he tried to brake.
Did the paramedics open this door?
Hey, Nick, check this out.
Guy was getting high. Think that's the reason he missed the curve up there?
Ah. We got a wallet.
Maybe he wasn't alone. Maybe the passenger survived, then emptied out his wallet, took off.
How'd you get that bruise on your dome, man?
So you drove back together?
Nice. You know the chick's name?
'Jennifer nipple ring'. Lyle, were you guys, uh, getting high yesterday? You smoke some weed? 
No? All right, let me tell you what I think happened. You and Cory got stoned, and you drove away. Cory lost control of the jeep ...
...at which point, you couldn't wake him up,
so you decided to take advantage of the situation, and you rifle through his wallet and leave.
Lyle, we're going to need a DNA sample from you.
Just to prove that, uh, your lips weren't on that joint that we found in the jeep.
Okay, so what's the cause of death, Doc?
What you got?
Well, that is consistent with the roommate's story. Says he wasn't in the passenger seat during the time of the crash.
Tox came back positive for low levels of cannabis.
Well, maybe he did hit the brakes. Did you check 'em?
Yeah, you can't do anything yourself, can you?
You ready?
Brakes work. Brake lights are working, so that means the battery's okay.
That tank is full of fuel, man.
Should we come back?
Uh, the victim's roommate admits they got high together, but denies being in the jeep at the time of the accident. At this point, we can't place him there.
Sounds like he's more concerned with getting it done than getting it right.
What about Ecklie?
Tow truck will be here in about an hour.
Yeah?
I've got some burn marks on the undercarriage. And I found something similar on the roll bar, as well.
Well, if an electrical charge traveled through the jeep, and shorted out the wiring, it would have shocked Cory, as well.
Yeah, but it was clear yesterday. Whatever it was, it zapped the hell out of his jeep.
Let's walk.
Well, the power company originally called that jeep in. They must have been out here fixing the lines. Maybe it was a down line. That would give us the high voltage power source right there.
Right. Without a path to ground, electricity is harmless.
What about that road marker?
It's bent in the direction Cory was driving.
This marker would have grounded the jeep.
I didn't know you did.
Well, hold on now. We found electrical burn marks on the roll bar and the jeep's undercarriage. And we found blown out fuses on the instrument panel and the starter. That would explain why the jeep wasn't running.
So we replaced the fuses, we connected the jeep to a power source, and we hooked up gelatin man here to a meter.
He's naked.
So, the current came into the vehicle from the roll bar, and it went out through the undercarriage.
Oh, since we're a team, you gonna help us clean up?
Like now, in his office.
Is that a handicap van?
Any witnesses?
It's an expensive-looking Italian suit just to be a chauffeur.
It's a wheelchair. Any indication he's handicapped?
Somebody's missing their wheels.
Thanks.
You see that blood spot on the lapel? It's inconsistent with the head wound. To avoid cross-contamination, you think you could cut that out for me?
How'd he shoot him in the face?
So we got a guy who fired a shot from a wheelchair and then escaped on foot.
So he was shot twice.
All right.
Yeah. No identifiable prints, only smudges.
No.
Thanks. Good looking out.
Really? That's strange. We found her wheelchair at a crime scene downtown. Any idea how it got there?
Loved to shop? Looks more like a compulsion.
Hi, folks. Could you all tell me what's the deal with all these boxes?
Ma'am, do you know what happened to Bonnie's wheelchair?
Great. Dax Blanchard?
Thanks.
Congratulations, Jim Brass. You're guaranteed one of these five amazing awards. Trip to London, ... 
A brand-new caddy, tennis bracelet, plasma TV, water purification system. You finally did it, Jim. Just send NZA a check for
NZA. So, where'd you get the sales pitch, man?
From the victim's personal effects. My guess, it's the same boob who was calling Bonnie.
My grandmother used to say if it sounds too good to be true, it is.
We know Vincent Decarlo's not available -- How about Dax Blanchard?
What the hell is that?
Nine-millimeter. Same as the casings found on the scene.
Nothing registered.
'DWM?'
Well, that's World War II-era German.
So, our shooter's an old soldier.
Hmm.
So, what did you do about it, sir?
What'd you do about it?
Why did you have him park on the roof?
Where's your sidearm, sir?
The gun, please, sir.
Sir? The gun.
Well ... the body's been cased in something. It's black. It's flexible ... but it's pretty stubborn. 
I think it's roofing tar. It keeps the smell and the animals away.
I don't' know. She wasn't just covered, she was completely encased. Whoever buried her sure had access to a lot of tar. I'm thinking a construction worker.
Nice job.
Well, that would explain the blood David found on her shirt. Mia's running DNA right now to find out if it matches the victim, or any suspects, for that matter.
Yeah, but if it was post, they probably did it to conceal identity.
What's going on around here?
Yeah. I pulled it out of the vault from the original abuse charge two years ago. Most of the blood is Svetlana's, although there is a small portion that comes from an unknown male.
Don't bother, he already voluntarily gave a sample the night that this happened, and it's not a match.
Eh ...
I did find this ... in her pocket.
Is that the husband?
Well, they're looking pretty friendly here. And you could write some teen poetry from the words that are highlighted in this dictionary.
A lot of blood on that blouse.
Were you able to get anything off these jeans?
That reminds me of the time I as at the Ghost Bar, and I ran into this hottie. I mean, the girl was an absolute dime. And I didn't have my phone on me, so I wrote her number down on paper, and put it in my pants. The jeans ended up in the wash. 
Yeah. But ... 
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, it was.
All of the blood on Svetlana's sweatshirt was hers.
No, but some of the drops look a lot like dried blood, but they came back 'aubergine sheen number 315,' professional grade hair dye.
Yeah. Some of the patterns look a lot like cast-off.
Ken still could have done it.
Yeah, well, admit the punch and you go to jail for a night. Admit the killing and you go to jail for life.
Find anything you like, buddy?
Well, life is short. Dating's complicated. This makes it much simpler, doesn't it?
It is?
Me? No. But you know, for a guy who's over 40, lonely, tired of the bar scene, got a little cash, wants to buy himself a sweet honey, be his companion ...
That's the best part.
The stain on the chair was Aubergine Sheen hair dye. DNA from the bloodstains on the walls was too degraded, and Mia could not get a match.
I think we can, though. You know some guy was selling a grilled cheese sandwich on ebay for something like $28,000 because he claimed the burn pattern contained the face of the Virgin Mary?
How much you think I can get for the face of Svetlana in hair dye?
Yeah, that is pretty tacky.
What, that the guy locks up his food?
You think he's trying to protect his investment? Weight goes up. Value goes down.
Look at this.
She can't even call out for pizza.
Could you imagine a control freak like him having to spend the night in jail on a phony abuse charge? You know he went looking for her when he got out.
He beat her, killed her and took back the only thing he valued.
We need a murder weapon.
Can we prove he buried her?
Which we also found at the salon.
According to your credit card statements, you purchased several buckets of tar two and five years ago ... at a local hardware store. Tell me, what's a receptionist at a hair salon doing with that much tar?
Sounds like fun.  Tell me about Svetlana.
So you're saying you did not kill her?
Then why'd you cover it up?
You didn't call 911?
You cleaned up the scene, buried her, ... 
... and then you left a note for Ken.
Was Andrew Melton a very good tipper five years ago?
Svetlana wasn't buried alone. There was another body in that grave.
She came here in a suitcase, but she was dead on arrival, so you take her out to the desert and bury her in a hole?
Look at those claw marks.
He's got a high-powered rifle. He's obviously a hunter, huh?
Damn.
That's a pretty deep cut. You think the hunter was just trying to defend himself?
We found this guy twenty-five miles from civilization. Where'd he come from?
Check out this guy's watch. It's pretty high-end.
But it just doesn't match with the guy's clothes. They're kind of raggedy. He's got dirt stains. I could smell the B.O. from the guy's shirt from here.
How's that?
You mean you didn't know he was missing?
I think I know why someone snagged that bear's gallbladder. Apparently, in the southeast Asian community, some men believe it enhances their virility. It contains some chemical called ursodeoxycholic acid. These gallbladders are going for $500 a pop.
Hmm. Any luck with the broker?
Hey, Dawson.
Any progress on those bullets? Well, the copper jacket came from your vic's rifle there. A .30-caliber Winchester, model 70.
What about the fatal bullet?
A .357?
You got a name for him?
Why don't you just stand up by the counter, sir? Here's your warrant that we have here for your .357 magnum revolver. We know you once used it in a '98 robbery. Serial number ML5684. We don't want you to get it. Why don't you just point and show us where it is.
You just admitted a felony of killing a bear. Why didn't you report it?
Could you lift your pants leg for me, please, sir?
Someone snagged their pant leg on a tree, probably cut themselves. I wanted to see if it was you.
Mr. Tracy, tell us about canned hunts.
Well, the evidence places Aaron at the crime scene.
No. We spoke to your distributor. Your copy machine was only installed two months ago. We think you created the false document.
So Aaron organizes this canned hunt. A few days ago, you guys meet up with Rod Hollis up at Lake Mead .
Would you lift up your pants legs, please, sir?
I have the judge on speed dial. You want to save me some time here?
We subpoenaed Aaron's bank records. Rod Hollis sent Aaron a check for
That's about twenty years right there.
Initial observations when we got to the scene.  Obvious impact to the face. Severe facial contusions. Broken nose, cracked teeth. No shoe prints. No tracks. No cast off. No sign of a weapon.
Well, the facial impact is consistent with the blood pool ... but not with the current position.
Well, I didn't see any trace on Bruce's hands. I don't think those are his prints.
Well, I don't see any signs of struggle in this hallway.
I wish they would.
Well, you get as good as you give.
Who smokes half a cuban?
Okay, just got back from the crime scene. Dropped the samples off at Trace. 
What's wrong?
No.
What?
Well, it looks like Mrs. Eiger's been a little busy.
Yeah.
Is that a diaper?
Those safety pins, they could match the bruises that we found on Mr. Eiger's hips. That accounts for that blood.
Lucky her.
I've got handprints and feces on carpet. He wasn't just incontinent, he was a ... 
That's disgusting.
Look at these indentations. I think they could have been a desk or something.
Take it straight up.
Well, I was gonna say the same thing, but the rug has eight divots that line up perfectly with that desk.
Get the hell out of here.
Nice.
People lived in fear of this guy?
A very powerful and paranoid man with a secret this big? It'd probably kill him if anyone found out.
I think this was originally used as a panic room. Eiger's got a massive security system here, motion and site sensitive. No video, though.
Well ... there is a hard drive. I'll get it back to the lab.
Oh, is that that blue thing that's in your locker?
I got a question. Where would you buy something like this? I mean, this crib and this rocking horse isn't exactly, uh, regulation size. 
Human?
All of it?
Well, it definitely wasn't the wife's.
So we're looking for one very tired milkmaid.
I downloaded the log from the Eigers' security system hard drive. All of the perimeter doors and windows in the Eiger mansion are protected. If one of them is opened, it's logged into the security system.
Okay. Garage door opens, 7:18. Got it.
8:00, the front door opens. It was probably the milkmaid.
Now four minutes later, the front door opens again.
17 minutes later, at 10:30, the garage door opens. I guess that was Mrs. Eiger.
But then a minute later, at 10:31, the front door opens again.
Hey, Cath.
I think I've got an ID off the victim's ring. 
The AFFA. It only lasted a few years, and only one player wore the number 12 for the Greenbacks. He was a wide receiver.
Gabe Miller. Fits the general description.
Without the vig, these are both $5,000 bets. Duke minus 17 on a Tuesday, and Louisville plus 23 on a Friday.
You know what? I don't follow college roundball anymore. Most of the good players go pro right out of high school.
The Mirage, the Stardust, the Golden Nugget, and Sam's Town. It's down the strip, across Fremont, up Boulder Highway. It's a classic runner's route.
Oh, I don't think you have to worry about him coming back to work.
Well, there's nothing wrong with a little confidence, especially in your line of work.
You taking drugs, Scott?
Looks like a runner to me.
Why, because they're winners?
Yeah, I hear that book's the only place where casinos actually lose money.
Oh, that's when the players shaved points. Any indication that this game was fixed?
A lot of one-way action?
The sharp number keeps you guys from getting hit too hard, huh?
Could I get a printout of the line moves?
Hey.
I'm studying the game that our vic got rich on. These are the craziest line moves I've ever seen.
That's actually true.
Okay, well, let me see if I can break it down. Monday morning, the week of the Duke-Louisville game, VSL sets the line at Duke minus 15.
Right. Now according to the Manager of the Book, the moment that number went up, cash came rolling in on Duke.
The professional bettors were all over the number, dispatching runners in every book in town. Now, remember, money moves the line. So, by the middle of the week, the tourists and local suckers caught wind of what the pros were betting, to Duke minus 25. 
This is where it gets weird. By Friday, all sorts of cash starts rolling in, but this time on the underdog -- Louisville plus 25.
Well, here's why.  Our vic had Lou Barnes lay 17 points with Duke, and take 23 with Louisville. And the game ... landed 22. How do you think he did it?
All that action created this big 'middle,' so he was able to win on both sides. I think Kelvin Russell sold VSL's numbers, and got killed for it.
Across town on a homicide, you guys call me out here for an abandoned vehicle?
You guys popped the trunk?
Feels like metal.
Who do you like?
All right, I'll give you Charlotte plus two.
How about a fabulous dinner?
All right.
But he's involved. I feel it. Those sports betting types -- they'll lie to their own kids about a game that hasn't been played yet.
Yeah, and I lied when I was.
Well ...
That was the manager of The Sports Book. Says a guy filed a lost ticket claim for the tickets that you found at the beaver dam.
Cesar Dabo. No wants or warrants. Address in Lincoln County. That's near Rainbow Canyon. That's where you found the body, isn't it?
It says Dabo was a welterweight contender. A title match against Archie Archman was his biggest fight. Lost by a split decision.
Check this out. The only judge who called the fight for Dabo was Mitch Urbana.
Dabo takes them out to Rainbow Canyon. Murders Russell, but Barnes gets away.
And Urbana reports his car stolen to cover his ass.
What about your buddy Mitch Urbana? He called a fight for you back in '79, right?
So, why were you driving Mitch's car?
Dabo, tell me something. Why didn't you take the kid's ring? That was worth something.
I was testifying today. I ran into the D.A. He filled me in on your case.  Looks like Matt Hawkins' confession is gonna stand up in court.
So you think he's innocent?
Sounds like a suspect.
Need some help?
I'll meet you in the car.
In the meantime, if you could just answer the question.
Yeah.
How did he scare them?
When was the last time that you saw him?
Whose blood is it on your sweater, Walter?
We're gonna give you a nice warm place to sleep tonight, partner.
Or this sweater could have accidentally been left in the park, and Walter, the homeless guy, could have picked it up and worn it when he entered the house through the screen door and killed Ty. But none of the evidence goes to motive.
Mmm ... 5'10'. About Nick's height.
What you getting at?
Go ahead.
Why didn't they pull her out?
Her parents protected that kid to death.
We'll call you, Dave, when we clear a path.
Oh, man.
Whew. Well ... she obviously fell forward ... 
Lots of pictures of the kid. Family revolved around the child, huh?
She might have put her hand out to break her fall.
Man. What a scene.
What are you thinking?
I don't know. This gun looks like it might've been wiped clean.
What about the little girl?
There are three bodies in three locations. A lot of variables. Where do you want to start?
Hey, Super Dave.
Uh ... that'd be a question for the boss lady. She's upstairs to the right.
Yeah.
Bobby matched the bullets to the gun that was found at the scene. He also ran a registration check.
No, it was registered to Morgan Stewart.
Well, you know it's a possibility. Brass pulled his financials. Morgan Stewart was in debt up to his eyeballs. He was in danger of losing his house.
Well, heat melts plastic and butane will explode under pressure.
Well, according to Brass, Neal and Morgan were good friends since they were kids. Neal was good at making money, and Morgan was good at making debts.
How's it going?
What's the trajectory going into the wall?
Well, there's no way those lines are gonna match up with Morgan all the way over on the bed.
Hang on. If he shot himself there ... how did he end up on the bed?
Where is the blood spatter from the initial wound?
There was someone else in that room.
Time to check the house.
Gentlemen.
What's going on here?
A convention girl.
You know, a model, stripper or a showgirl working the convention for extra cash. You got a T.O.D. yet?
These streaks right here. They don't look like blood.
Possible hair fragments and some skin under her nails.
It'd be good for us.
So that's why they call it a 'recreational vehicle.'
She likes to party?
She was found dead this morning.
I was told that the doors close at ten. Any idea why she was here after hours?
Hodges ...
What are you doing?
Call facilities. You got my results?
The results, Hodges, from the swabs I gave you? From Lisa Schumacher's fingertips?
Spermicide. So she did handle a condom.
Well, she did have skin under her fingernails, so she could've scratched her attacker's scalp.
Hmm.
Twenty-nine and already over the hill.
This town has different standards. Let me see something.
Looks like Lisa had a roommate.
What is that on your arm? Is that tanner?
Razor-tight girl like you forgetting to rub tanning lotion in? Doesn't sound right to me. You know, the funny thing is, is your girlfriend Lisa had streaks of tanner on her body, too. Were you girls together last night?
You guys just 'went out'? Come on.
Really? Because we found Lisa's DNA on a condom.
Having a sample of your DNA would help exclude you as a suspect. Voluntary or court order, it's your choice.
Daluca's all over the condoms. Get this, on one of them, his DNA and her epithelials are on both sides.
It does support his story, though.
It's not a match to Daluca.
Oh, I'm not quite done yet.
Have a seat, Donny.
What kind of hair gel do you use?
Real funny.
Please stay still.
How did you get these scratches in your head?
I'll tell you what you were thinking.
You kill her, Daluca takes the fall. You can't lose.
For that exact reason, 'cause she was a 'nothing' to you.
No, but when I match your DNA, I'll make sure you're on the cover. Cuff him.
Daluca's all over the condoms. And get this, on one of them ...
Hey. Whoo! It's a mess. I've talked to every resident in the area. No one knows this guy. No unaccounted-for vehicles. I don't know what to tell you.
We must be under the freeway by now.
Are you kidding me?
This city was not made for rain.
Catherine.
I understand, I understand. Listen, I need to ask you a question. Have you ever seen this guy right here?
You don't know him?
Nobody's making you do anything, okay? Now, you like coffee?
Okay, you go with that officer over there. He'll get you a nice cup of coffee, all right?
There you are.
Is that a sneaker?
Yeah.
Well, maybe the vic was some punk, uh ... with an attitude. Decided to take it out on some homeless guy. You never know.
Well, we're already wet, so ...
Well, there's 300 miles of storm drains in Clark County, so we only have 299 left.
No, that's a dead end.
Sunscreen on a lanyard.
I say we keep going upstream.
Daylight. Finally.
Oh, yeah. 
No way.
It's an inner tube.
Guy gets the day off and decides to go surfing ... Vegas style.
Hits his head on something, drowns.
That would account for all that body trauma.
Well, that's what happens when you don't have a decent beach in Vegas.
Really?
Watch your step.
You all right?
Whoa.
Yeah.
Flaky texture. Probably a couple years old.
You guys get a lot of jokes about this thing?
Vactor's in place. Ready when you are.
Let's go.
Yo.
Anything distinctive?
Well waste water sewage is a closed system. It's completely separate from the storm drains. Someone must have flushed it down a toilet, a sink, a tub, or tossed them directly into a manhole.
Two hundred thousand service connections, serving half a million residences. Sixteen hundred miles of pipe, gravity fed.
Catherine. Recovered more bones.
Pelvis fragment and two humerus.
These plumbers must be working overtime.
I don't think the bones could have come from any one of these houses. Residential sewer lines are only four-inch pipes.
And they make a 90-degree turn before they connect to the main. Look at the size of these bones.
They're too big to make a turn like that.
I'll go check it out.
It's like a waterline stain. Hand me my florazene and my glasses, please.
No. These vaults are built big for access. They're not reservoirs. Water's supposed to stay down in the pipes.
Mm-hmm.
But a whole body would.
Water rises, submerges the body.
I don't think we're looking for a grave robber. 
We're looking for a murderer.
I got a shotgun under the couch.
Oh, yeah.  Loaded.
Sounds like we got some nasty dogs out back.
Yeah, right.
That closet's well stocked, huh?
Sara?
No. Put your stuff down and step away from the closet.
Put down your stuff and step away from the closet.
Yeah.
Dispatch ... this is CSI Brown. We're at the Durbin residence. We have explosives on the scene. Roll out bomb squad immediately. Roll out bomb squad.
What are you doing?
Sara.
Here, try this.
It's stuck.
All right. On three.  One ... two ... three.
Can we get the hell out of Dodge now?
Six pipe bombs.
Not that we know of.
You got it.
Okay, Grissom, I located some burnt clothes in a barrel out in the back. I'm thinking he was killed in the house, dragged out back and then dumped.
Yeah, I'm all over it.
Well, that was a few years back, and we still can't place Travis at the house.
With all the fire damage, the clothes are the right size, but I couldn't get any blood evidence off of it.
Hmm?
Where he at? 
Jim.
I'm here for the HIDTA conference. Buddy of mine from L.A.P.D. told me there was a new captain in town, stirring things up. What are you doing here?
Have anything to do with a feisty little blonde named Ellie?
Good to meet you.
Well, I thought L.A. was all about car culture. This reminds me of home.
Too clean.
But a bullet hole wouldn't make those markings. What is that?
It looks like a tool marking.
Hey, you know, uh, Jim, I'm here all weekend. If you need anything, don't hesitate to call.  Pleasure meeting you.
Remember, what happens in L.A., stays in L.A.
Well, you got beaches, bikinis. Free trip to L.A.? I'm down.  So we got coffee filters, cough medicine, matches, camping fuel
If this is a meth lab, then there would be free iodine coated all over these walls. And if Matt packed this kit right, I would have some spray starch
... that would react with the iodine ... 
... turning it a nice dodger blue. Yes, it's a meth lab.
Jail would be an improvement over this hole.
Did her DNA match the blood that you swabbed from the trunk?
So, what's with the bullet holes?
Clean-up.
One bullet exited. Is the other hole to the left or to the right?
That's the gas tank.
Yeah. Look at that. No wonder those hood rats couldn't get the car started. It won't run on blood.
You think you could run this through IBIS?
Well, he did have a female hooker in his ride.
Why, because he has this nice shag carpet?
This carpet's wet.
Oh, yeah. That's a lot of blood.
I don't know -- two, three pints?
I don't think we'll be able to get any DNA off this. The carpet solvents probably compromised the sample.
You know what? It's this metal surface. It's giving us a false positive.
Does anyone see a remote?
Could you hit the input button until we find a blue screen?
Look at that.
Nice place.
Someone with a lot of dirt.
Wow. Big party. Tequila. Whiskey. Gin. Absinthe.
I wanted to catch you before you left. I got a look at the print results from the bottles that we collected just before I was escorted out and asked to leave the lab.
No, but I think I know why.
It's like Chinatown, Jim.
What about Ellie?
Well, she's the only one who can I.D. Todd Piccone as the driver.
I don't know. He's involved. It's his house. It's his car. It's his party.
You better hope nobody, or she'll be taking a dirt nap.
If Dakota had wax under her fingernails, I think she must have been doing more than just pouring.
From the prints that we got off the bottle, I have a list of six suspects.
Silvio Peters, Joe Cohen ...
Yeah. Daniel Reichmann, Vic Patterson, Todd Piccone, Parker Smythe.
Yeah. I mean, you can be in AFIS for a lot of reasons. After 9-11, anyone who works in a government building.
Or anyone who has a permit to carry a concealed weapon.
You know what?
Hey, Nicky. Where are you? Are you near a computer? Can you do me a favor?
Uh, it's intense. I have a list of suspects, all in AFIS. I want to know if any of them have a permit to carry concealed.
Silvio Peters, Parker Smythe, Daniel Reichmann,
Todd Piccone, and Vic Patterson.
Yeah. What kind of gun?
Can you give me anything else?
Nah, I'm just going to hang back. Let him blow off some steam.
Yeah, it's something.
Was that Nick?
In Hollywood, thinking. You know, even if Vic Patterson did shoot up the car with his gun, that doesn't mean he killed Dakota. Just means he helped clean up.
Yeah. We need a murder weapon to nail his ass. I got these photos at a Hollywood memorabilia shop for ten bucks. 
Who do you see?
Look closer. Look at the pistol grip ... and The Eagle. You know, these autopsy photos I saw all got me thinking. This one. Look at the pattern contusions.
I'd love a drink, but we made plans, though.
Tomorrow.
I hate to break up the party. Catherine, you got a 4-19 in Seven Hills. I'll grab the kits and meet you outside.
You got an ID on the vic?
Any indication of sexual assault?
Got some shell casings.
It was close contact. He couldn't miss.
I wonder where Holly Pearson works.
Yeah. Bullets from both homicides are from the same gun.
Well, let's call PD and bring him in.
This land used to be part of the Bennett estate.
Yeah. Huh. We used to come out here when we were in high school. Used to be, like, a seven-acre lover's lane.
I was a dork in high school. I'm still a dork, but I had dimples. I got a little action.
Crop circle?
I guess it's a crop circle.
The guy has a blindfold on.
Lividity's fixed? So this wasn't a body dump? He died there?
That's odd, because the grass around the victim was undisturbed.
Oh! Now, that's alien. What is that?
Yeah, that cyst grows up to be nice fat tapeworm that attaches itself to the intestinal wall and sucks out all your nutrients.
I'm glad it picked the mouth.
Well, the tapeworm could have made the guy sick, but it didn't kill him.
We're from the crime lab. We have information that put your chopper at a crime scene yesterday, around noon.
... So I took my girl to that Ultimate Fight Championship on Saturday night.
Yeah. Almost ended up getting into a smackdown of my own.
You know, Tina doesn't like me carrying a gun. I play down the fact that I'm a cop when I'm with her anyway.
So, uh, we're standing out in front of the hotel, making out and this guy walks up to me, gets in my face, and asks me how she is.
I tell him to get lost. He says, 'Make me.'  So I took a step forward and out of nowhere his big, fat bodyguard, looking like wimpy from Popeye, walks up and starts to close in on me.
It was at the valet parking, which might as well be in Arizona, it's so far away from the lobby. This fat boy is looking like he's obviously carrying some sort of weapon. And I'm standing there naked as a p0rn star with my girl.
They didn't seem to care. One of the guys sounded Russian, like he was wanna-be Mafia.
Fat boy was obviously his bodyguard.
So, uh, you know, I wasn't physically afraid of the guys, but something was kind of sinister about them. They were provoking me, but they weren't making a move. It was almost like they were waiting for me to make a move. Say if I smacked big-mouth, fat boy would've came over and stabbed me or something. Even fat boy was vibing me not to take the bait.
Well, valet finally brought Tina's car up. So, I maneuver her around these guys and I put her in her car, and I turn my back to them and let 'em talk this smack. I'm calming Tina down. Tell her everything is fine. She drives off and I walk away. I called Tina later on and I tell her, uh, you know, if she got any problem with me being a cop, she needs to get over it, 'cause now I'm packing.
Scoured the hotel looking for these punks.
Yeah, you better flip that coin.
Heads.
Have fun at the trash run.
Hey. 
What do you need me to do?
Yeah, there was some sort of large vehicle here. 
All right, print it out.
I need you to bring up the traffic cameras in a three-block radius between Flamingo and Koval in the last 24 hours.
That's good enough. Our guy was taken around 11:00. 
Scan forward. We're looking for a big truck.
It's on the list.
Whoa, he's really moving.
Wait a minute. That one, the big Ford.
Follow it.
The Expedition truck left the area around 11:15. Definitely in a hurry. Took a right off Koval onto Tropicana, crossed Las Vegas Boulevard onto
Yeah, stuff is volatile. Flammable. Outside of meth cooks, no one uses it anymore.
Yeah, it was just bad luck he did.
We've got to assume that it is.
Looks like a live feed to me. I say we keep the light on.
That's the wrong box, Greg.
That one right there.
All right, let's go over it again. The diagnostic unit gets attached to that black box, which gives us the mileage of his last trip. Like an airplane.
Right.
Twenty-three miles. We know he was heading east on the 215.
How's he doing?
Yeah.
What are you doing, Nicky?
What are you doing, Nicky?
Don't do it, Nicky!
You son of a bitch!
Oh.
You're still alive.
No.
Maybe if we count up all the damn 'maybes,' maybe Nick will be alive!
You know what I'm saying?!
Damn.
I'm not.
I just can't help thinking that could have been me in that box, you know? We flipped a coin for that trash run.
If that was me, I would have ...
No. You're wrong. I wouldn't have lasted this far. Catherine, if something happens to Nick, if we don't bring him back in one piece ...
Oh, got an edge right here. All right.
I don't know, man. It would have to be at least six feet long.
I hit something.
Nick!
Nick! Hold on there, buddy!
All right, based on this battery and what's running off of it, and the fact that we kept the damn light on for as long as we did, I figure Nick's got another ninety minutes left, now.
Okay, I've got two nurseries within the overlap area. Here and here.
I hit something.
Hey!
Hey!
We got you, man! Hey, Nicky!
Nicky! Yeah. Hey, hold on there.
Hey, put that down. Put that down.
Put that down. We got you. We're gonna get you out of here. 
Hang in there.  Oh, my God. We need that fire extinguisher! Give me that fire extinguisher.
These ants are getting at him, man.
Oh.
Hang on, buddy. Hang on. Almost had him.
Hang on. Hang on. We'll kill those ants, okay? You listen to me.
Yeah.
One, two, three.
I'm not leaving without Nick.
I'm not leaving here without him.
I got you. I got you. 
Lay still. Lay still. It's okay. It's okay.
... So I took my girl to that Ultimate Fight Championship on Saturday night.
Yeah. Almost ended up getting into a smackdown of my own.
You know, Tina doesn't like me carrying a gun. I play down the fact that I'm a cop when I'm with her anyway.
So, uh, we're standing out in front of the hotel, making out and this guy walks up to me, gets in my face, and asks me how she is.

One, two, three.
I'm not leaving without Nick.
I'm not leaving here without him.
I got you. I got you. 
Lay still. Lay still. It's okay. It's okay.
How'd you shoot, man?
You and I need to go practice some, huh?
Well, when they take your piece, you'll make time.
Easy. With a map and a smile.
Rolls up -- 'Hey, little girl, I'm lost. You from around here?'
Yeah.  What's missing?
Her sister said the victim changed back into her school uniform in the car. 
Hello.
Welcome.
The mother's bloody t-shirt.
It's on its way.
How so?
Phew! That's a lot of perverts.
That's still a lot of perverts.
What's up?
Epithelials?
That confirms his story that the briefs were never worn. Hair?
Great. That means we have to let the b*st*rd go. It's only a matter of time before he snatches up another kid.
Yeah, but they can't watch him indefinitely.
Or they'll kill him.
They found Alicia Perez.
She's wrapped up pretty tight.
Diazepam? That's a pretty hard-core antidepressant for a kid that small.
You think they didn't care about her?
Well, it must've been hard, trying to keep their son alive, keep the family together. Couldn't have been easy.
Yeah. Blue fibers.
I take it you qualified at the range.
What'd you shoot?
Where are you doing?
I have a confirmation. Those blue fibers are consistent with the blanket that the girl was wrapped in. And the shoe prints that I found at the scene, they're a match to the father's work boots. 
No. After a triple and three back-to-back scenes, I'm tired. I'm going to take a ten in the car before we head back.
Yeah. Okay, you ready to run it?
Well, we have this eviction notice. So, that means no business. No business, no cash, so that could rule out robbery as a motive.
Blood bucket brigade.
What's the rush, Marty?
No hits off of AFIS.
According to Cavaliere, the table saw was a rental. So, there could have been any number of prints on that one.
Yeah, from that spinning blade, there was blood everywhere. Some of it had to transfer to the killer's clothes and shoes.
What's the problem, Marty?
We didn't even bring lunch there, Marty. And this wasn't a decomp scene.
Yeah. Picture that.
Nobody's messing with you, Marty.
Phew ... ooh ... 
How'd we miss that?
Did you steam clean?
The heating process must have brought the smell out.
Lot of possibilities.
I know how to find it.
Okay, rich guy. Shut down your gear, you're taking us to lunch.
How many cases do you get a week?
Rate gets us ten to twenty.
Working for you, no thanks.
Well, it smells like Eternity for Somebody in here.
Oh!
You heard right. Charlie confessed to killing the landlord. And the blood on his watch is a match to Bassngi's DNA.
Swears he has nothing to do with it. You got a C.O.D.?
Do you have any idea what hit her?
Could be anything.
The first victim was killed with a weapon of opportunity, the table saw. The second victim gets a crack on the head.
Yeah.
Well, the killer left the body here.
Yeah. And he didn't have a gun license.
Yes.
A little store security.
It seems that the Missus caught her husband collecting rent from the late Melissa Poolie. She just waited till he left the building.
Luckily, she left her prints behind. We had them on file from an assault case in '98.
Good to see you, Marty.
Griss, this place is crawling with press. They want a statement.
Well, if you don't say anything, they're just going to fill in the blanks ... 
He must've written 'I have her' on the underlying page.
Looks like she's in a small room.
Chair? Sofa?
Guys, those black trilobal fibers that we found on Debby Reston's body were from a Chevy. 
And the size and shape of those windows are consistent with a Chevy van.
Janet and Marcia both lived in Dakin Hall. Charlene and Debby took Econ 101. Marcia and Charlene took English Lit. Janet, Debby and Kaitlin all ate at MacGraw dining hall.
Right.
Great. Got all the towels we need here.
The same costumes as the kidnappers.
Yeah.
Hey, Catherine ...  ... got everything we need for Halloween except the candy.
The abductors exposed their faces to Janelle Macklin. That's one of two things -- either she knew them, or they were going to whack her.
Hey, guys, I got a work card hit off of that maple syrup print.
I just got off the phone with Brass.
No. He says he didn't do it. And based off the DNA report, I believe him. 
Mia found saliva and epithelials on the gag and ligature. We ran them against all known suspects.
Wow. Mascara, tweezers ... under-eye cream ... ... neck-firming lotion.  Girls. Pads ... one, two, three, four jars of depilatory cream?
Nether-stubble?
Well ... Walter Clancy didn't mind stubble.
The registered owner of this vehicle.
Wow. Take away the, uh ... eye makeup ... fix the eyebrows.
No, it's more like Wendy killed Walter.
Are they all women?
Dr. Mercer, Wendy didn't commit suicide. She was killed.
You found me.
So it might be the killer's.
Well, given the nature of this case, it might be misleading, but I'll ask anyway -- male or female?
Well, she was found dead two miles south of there, supposedly on her way to her friend Mimosa's house here.
Yeah.
Classic. Fourteen minutes of Wendy's time unaccounted for.
Yeah, but there's nothing out there. 
'G-105, Section E.' What does that have to do with her medicine cabinet?
What's the number again?
Hey, hey, watch your step. Watch your step. I got footprints.
Yeah.
Nick, hit the lights.
Oh, God.
Well, we found out that this creepy looking thing is an abdominal retractor, used to keep the cavity open during surgery.
Officer, could you escort this man outside.
Really?
I'll check the back.
She told her best friend and Officer Mann that she had some videos to show. I think she must have been trying to expose Lavalle.
Brown. Really? Thanks.  That was Brass. Ten soccer moms confirm they saw Dr. Lavalle and Amber Hamshaw at the soccer game the night Wendy was killed. Another dead end.
Didn't the Garbetts sue to have the dumpster removed?
Garbett's appeal didn't call the forensics into question. Why are we here?
Well, the DA had sufficient evidence and filed charges before I could give the hair to Greg, so I moved on to another case.
Yeah.
Oh, Susan.
Yeah, well, now she's VP of Food Services, so I get free steak and eggs every Sunday morning.
Does everyone know my business around here?
You're listening to music.
No, it's good. Well, maybe not your music taste, but we'll work on that. You have my DNA profile for the hair sample I gave you?
No? Do you need more time?
All right. Thank you.  And Mia, Avril's fine, but if you really want to experience musical heartache, you should check out, uh ... Nina Simone.
What?! A Portuguese water dog.
Are you serious
I am. The hairs got kicked to trace.
I will find out if the victim or suspect owned a dog. I'm on it.
How about you, Mr. Reeba. Do you down a dog?
I'm sorry, I'm not at liberty to discuss ongoing cases.
Well, all I can tell you is that the defendant was granted a new trial.
The crime lab is reviewing the case file now.
I've seen people kill for a lot less, sir. Mr. Reeba, you and your partner were joint owners of this property, right?
With right of survivorship.
And when he died, you got it all, isn't that right?
Nothing. It's just a question.
Ecklie, you know I'm real busy...
It was my job to bring the hairs to DNA.
Yes.
No, yesterday. Look, if there was a problem ...
I had a gambling problem. What's your point?
That's correct. So ...
No ... he helped me, uh ... by being a friend.
It was more like he ambushed all of us. Real sorry, Grissom.
This sucks. This guy has been kissing ass all his life, he's trying to tell me -- he's trying to tell us what makes a good supervisor. What makes a good team?
I always knew there'd come a time when we weren't, uh, working together anymore. I just didn't think it'd be under these circumstances.
All right. My new supervisor.
Yeah.
Well, I got to get some rest. Swing shift starts at four in the afternoon. That's a big change.
Well, thanks to you, this job, I already know my purpose. See ya.
All right.  Greg, you're with us.
He's been busy.
Yeah.
Well, this is g-string row, isn't it?
Because I'm married.
Oh, yeah, it's a girl I've been dating a couple months--Tina.
Since yesterday. Did this, uh, drive-through wedding at Circus Circus Way, you know. Fun, yeah, we, uh ... fun time.
We need a TOD, David.
Thanks. Do you think she was dumped?
I'll go with you.
So, Vartann and I struck out on g-string row.
Yeah, right. You know what I mean. No one recognized the victim's picture. Listen, Cath, about this whole marriage thing ...
Yeah.
Yes, she is ...
Smashed and then smashed, huh?
Any luck on the, uh ... victim's prints?
'E.V.'?
Yeah?
Hmm.
And she didn't have a quarter, so she called 911. I'll print the phones.
Let's get the traffic cameras, too.
Archie? 
Archie? Do you have anything on pay phone dump?
Whoa!
That's our girl.
I'll put Vartann on it.
Vic loses her shoes. Explains the boots. Let see where she came from. Rewind it a little bit, would you?
Oh. Stop. Hold it. That looks like an airport shuttle. There's a logo on this side. 
This is Vegas. It's a strip bar on wheels.
I found something in there besides body fluids. Belongs to the victim, Brooke Harris. You dropped that girl off in a war zone, man.
Right. The owners don't like that bus coming anywhere near the clubs because they don't make any money off them.
Well, there's a secured parking lot not too far from where the garbage man dropped her off.
Hey, Catherine ...
Can we talk?  About this?
You know, what happened to Nick ... it just got me thinking. Life is so short, you know? It's almost ... it's almost shorter than we want to ever believe.
Exactly. So, I, uh ... I've been heading to ask this young lady I've been seeing--Tina--to marry me.
Yeah?
But it also feels like you're not so happy for me.
When she parks her car, she's a hot housewife. A few hours later, she's just another freak.
Right.
Well, I don't see any ATMs around here. This is a bad place to be broke.
Rusty flakes. 
Hey, Michaels, did you put this crime tape up?
Yeah, well, you missed something. There's blood on this rebar.
I don't think I'm ready to subject her to the crew just yet.
Don't.
What about the father?
I called the team. 
They always look so vulnerable.
What do you make of this? 
Possible struggle ... that could've been used as a weapon.  The blood drops could be castoff.
Maybe the poor kid had to pee while his mom was in the car.
Mrs. Matthews, I need you to take a look at something. Do you recognize these?
Any luck with those prints from the swing?
I wouldn't get our hopes up -- it's a vague description.
Nothing.
What do you got for me?
What about the underpants?
I wonder why.
Ditched his wet tighty-whiteys and went back out to play. 
What's a 450?
Mr. Daly, where were you yesterday afternoon?
Where did you go next?
Which park?
Would that be Mesa Valley Park?
Did you go to the men's room at any time?
What did you do there?
What did you do next? We found your blood on the floor.
Yeah. I'm sure we'll find that in your medical records. 
You have anger issues, Mr. Daly?
Would you take a seat for me, please. 
What's that cut on your hand from? Pick the wrong partner?
You recognize this boy?
Did you get a look at the guy?
What the hell's going on?
So this kid has two moms?
Hey. My name's Warrick. You want to go for a walk?
Come on, we'll have some fun.
Thanks.
Wow, everybody's so busy in there, huh? Hey, I hear you like dinosaurs. Which one's your favorite?
You know what mine is? T-rex. 'Cause he's got teeth like this big. 
I bet you wouldn't want him for a pet, would you? 
You want to see something cool? Come over here. Let's sit down.
This is my special science kit. 
Got all kinds of stuff in here. Let me see ... I got rubber gloves.
Here ... put that on.  What else I got in here? I got pens that turn into flashlights. 
You want to see something invisible? Go like this.
See, there's nothing there, right? 
But take my magic wand right here, and I put it in my special magic powder like this.  Watch this. 
What appears is our fingerprints.  Now shine the flashlight on it. 
Wow ... Good job. Will you be my assistant? 
See, no two people's fingerprints are alike. Just like no two people's spit is the same. 
So if I took my spit like this ... 
Now you do it.
See, even if I mix them up, I have a machine to tell me which one is mine and which one is yours. Now, I need you to tell me something. 
Which one of these two pretty ladies is your mom?
He picked Mrs. Esposito.
I don't think he's lying.
Well, I'm sure the Espositos do, too.
It seems kind of set up, doesn't it?
The pixel density's not the same.
So Karen took a picture of herself at the beach and Photoshopped Jesse in.
So if that's really Adam Esposito, where did she get the pictures from?
Where are you going?
Ah. Click on where it says 'Adam's Birthday Party.'
That one.
That's Mesa Valley Park.
Karen Matthews faked those photos that she gave Catherine.
Cut-and-paste. The photos that she got off the Internet.
No. My guess is Karen's been downloading pictures from the family website for a while -- the most recent being from Mesa Valley Park.
Yeah, and she went there hoping to see him again.
There you go, she's lying. She doesn't have a son.
What about his grandparents?
Has anyone seen Jesse since he was two? His teachers or a doctor, baby-sitters ... ?
Well, I guess we can impound her car and find out if there's any evidence that he was even in there.
I suppose she thought it was her son that was gone when she looked back at that empty swing.
Old school. Soil probes. The probe goes deeper where the soil's been disturbed.
Yeah.
She would have buried the body where he would have still been close to her.
Somebody replaced this fence board right here. These other ones look like they've been chewed on.
There's definitely a change in density there.
Jesse liked dinosaurs.
Hey, David, would you grab that?
Thanks.
A missed call from a Michelle.
She called six times since 3:53 p.m.
Well, this victim definitely had a lady in his life.
Probably the same Michelle that tried to reach him six times on his cell phone.
'Hey, jackass-- this is your last chance. Pay your debt or I'll hunt you down.' 
Makes our job easier when the suspect prints out his motive. He has an e-mail printout from casinodangmail.com.
We're from the Crime Lab. We need to ask you a few questions.
No, actually we're inquiring about a Mr. Hayden Bradford. You sent him some threatening e-mails.
Isn't it true in online gambling you have to submit your credit card, prior to gambling, to insure your losses?
Is that when you decided to hunt him down?
No, Mr. Nobler, I'm sorry, we can't do that. Mr. Bradford's dead.
You see that?
No, he wiped his feet on the mat. I'm hoping to get a little trace evidence here. Yeah, you see these pebbles? They look like the same ones that were found at the crime scene.
Catherine, I've covered the kitchen. I've found no evidence of a sister living here. 
I'll do the same.
What do you got?
This is true; he did. But we believe that Mr. Nobler here stepped in the shards of glass. Listen, neither the glass nor the pebbles are probative on their own, but together, they put your client at the crime scene. Not to mention, his threatening e-mail gives us motive.
Okay, I'm listening.
What happened next?
Why?
Something must be wrong with his gear. He could be partying with two hot chicks inside, but he's out here working on his bike at 4:00 in the morning?
Man, I give this guy an 'A' for organization. He's got a spot for everything. Why is that helmet over there?
Yeah, but he looked like he was in pretty good shape. It'd be kind of hard for one of those women to wrestle him down.
David, it's Warrick. Have you washed the body yet?
No, stop. I uh, just found a bullet. I have no idea who fired it. Do me a favor: Test his hands for GSR and run it through the fluoroscope.
Thanks.
Who brings a gun to a knife fight?
But not enough individual characteristics to run it through IBIS.
That's all right.
Hodges.
Okay, what about metallic trace from the garage floor?
So you don't have any results from the metallic trace on the garage floor?
Half of these tools don't match the size and the shape of the wound. And the ones that do don't have blood on them.
I don't see why the killer would have used a tool anyway, when he had a gun.
Take a look at this. This guy was tweaker organized. There's a place for everything. Except for this.
It's got no space in the pegboard and it doesn't match any of the sets.
Nope.
Remember we thought that they might be dealing meth? Brass went ahead and subpoenaed the phone and bank records. Guess who's paying Bianca's mortgage?
A Mr. Harry Desmond.
Well, Harry was nice enough to leave us a voice message that was listened to and saved the night of the murder.
And this is the Desmond cabin in Telluride.
I guess they were having a little threesome.
Grissom, it's Warrick. None of the guns Bobby test-fired were a match to the bullets, but Chelsea Wannamaker purchased a .22 in her name that was not picked up with the warrant for Harry's guns. Okay. I'm on it.
Mrs. Wannamaker. Wow, that's a hell of a rock. I'm surprised I didn't see that the other night.
Is that why you own a gun?
You trying to buy back some time there, Mrs. Wannamaker? 
Oh, I agree with you. But it must be tough for Bianca to have the kind of mother that'd sleep with her boyfriend.
What's that, getting busy with her boyfriend or getting caught?
Dad loves his daughter, but mom only sees the daughter as competition.
Bianca eats nice boys for brunch.
Las Vegas Crime Lab.
Oh. Sara.
Dispatch, this is CSI Brown. We have a woman down. We need a paramedic.
Well, we figured out the sticky stuff on Bianca's neck was creosote. It's a timber preservative found on fences, telephone poles and railroad ties.
Telephone poles. Tom Harper's work order for Bianca's DSL line was dated December 18. December 18 ... fell on a Sunday. How many workers you know work on a Sunday?
Yeah.
Why would the guy lie?
Every time this chick calls Tom, somebody gets shot.
We have multiple calls to him from Bianca's house and it was not her. We also have on the record that you called him from your cell.
But you'd probably call it, what, good mother?
Yeah, apparently, a lot of her boyfriends, too.
So he was good enough for you, but too good for your daughter, was that it? 
Lady, you unleashed an unstable man that you knew was in love with your daughter. You had to know that that was not going to end well.
This guy must've worked some pretty rough shifts. That must be the bullet, right there.
What's that happening all around the nose area?
You ever see one on a waiter?
Hey.
Mandy got an AFIS hit off the vic. His AKA is Tim Duke, but his real name is Vincent Pullone, a one-time golden gloves wannabe.
Yeah, well, so does his rap sheet. The guy was busy: Multiple assaults, theft ... is that the surveillance footage?
Well, that's our vic.
Freeze that. Can you get a plate number?
Nice.
'Nanci... mc... ma...'
McGonigle?
I'll run it through Brass.
She say anything in that book about all that dough we found under her floor?
The famous Pan Am heist?
All right, this is what we got so far: we got a loser boxer, who's a crack head, probably selling drugs -- and someone buys him two tickets to Sardinia. Why?
Are you saying that he was a hit man and not an innocent bystander?
Yeah, but who killed him? And why?
Yeah, yeah. Then you go whack him when he's working around every VIP in town. Sure.
I think I've processed this very room before.
'.380 auto.' That's federal ammo.
Sounds like a professional hit to me.
Looks like the victim was doing a little cleaning of his own. He was a 12 stepper. Trying to make amends. He was on step number nine.
Well, it's pretty obvious he came in through the window. 
Whew. One thing's for sure, this killer's lugging around some pretty big dogs.
Killer used a silencer.
Slightest imperfection in the barrel of a silencer could explain these scratches on the bullet.
Well, you can't legally buy a silencer, and those things are hard to make.
I don't know who would go through this much trouble to kill a nobody like Nash.
Then he drives to the apartment, puts a cap in Clayton Nash, gets into his car and drives away, free and clear.
Okay, that all sounds great. How do we find the guy?
So we have three potential killers and nothing to tie them to either crime scene.
I dusted every inch of that apartment window. He never took off his gloves.
A hand in the desert is worth two in the bush.
Okay, 'Grissom'. Come on. What are we doing here? What are the odds that this hand is not being eaten right now by a coyote?
Torture chamber?
I do.
You think the hand is in that pile?
Whoo!
Whew! The smell's coming from these plants.
'Amorphophallus titanum, corpse flower.' Now who's going to have a plant that smells like decomposing flesh?
You smell a warrant?
I'm in if you're in.
... unless we got the warrant to open it.
That's funny. You don't strike me as the delayed gratification type.
Right. There are some freaky-looking plants in here.
Well, if this is where they genetically modify the plants, there's got to be a house around here somewhere.
'Jacob Wolfowitz.'
Yeah.
We can hear you, sir. Just open the door.
Catherine ...
Do you remember this Caroline Fitzgibbons case? About a year ago? 
Would you mind if we come in?
We were hoping that you'd invite us to help out with your investigation.
You're picking up what we're putting down. 
Well, hello, Caroline. She was, what, like 16? Isn't it a felony to purchase pornographic pictures of a minor?
Oh, yeah. These look real scientific.
Bleach on a wood floor, huh?
I presume you pheno'ed it?
I'm looking for the tiniest crack between the planks. You know, you can scrub blood off a surface, but you can't scrub beneath it.
Yeah ...
We got blood.
Hey. I was able to get in touch with Caroline's father. He's on his way back to his house to pick up his daughter's toiletries, and he'll meet us back here.
Incidentally, I was able to speak with someone at WLVU. Tad Sidley was a student there, with the roommate. Now, Doc Robbins told me the kid had been dead for at least two weeks. I'd be interested in talking to the roommate to find out why no one reported him missing.
Come with?
When was the last time you saw him?
Catherine ...
Don Fitzgibbons and a phone number?
You mind if I take it with me?
Thank you. Case closed.
Oh, come on, you saw the amount of fluorescence on that floor. You don't use a bucket of bleach to clean up a paper cut.
Well, if you'd like to have a word with your old man, I'd say now would be the time.
I'm sure you'll be seeing Robert again tonight, too, huh? 
You know what? It's fine. I got to go. Have a fun time.
No. Great time. What can I do for you?
I'm examining smoke bombs recovered from, uh ... the victim's condo, and comparing them to smoke bombs from an arson case a couple of weeks ago.
Well, so far, I've only opened up one item from each case. CSIs, when we work a case, we take extensive notes at the scene, and photos of each item. And, uh ... they're very similar, I know. But, based on the construction and the components, I'd say these two bombs were made by the same person.
Those out-of-order signs must've been part of his game. You funnel the victim to the right showerhead. Did you process these?
So Marlon followed her out just to hear her squeal?
In high school?
Was he ever a suspect?
You rang? 
Stacy.
So she fabricated evidence, and put her own blood on the shirt.
Or she could have gone back to the field at any time within the last four months and rubbed her shirt in the same kind of dirt.
The victim's car originally impounded ... in front of Scott Baird's house. Traces of blood and soil consistent with the crime were found in the front seat. Now, if Hannah's the killer, she had to drive this car.
Soil and blood on the carpet. That was in the report.
Hmm. But this wasn't.
Okay, what do we got?
Yeah.
Hey, guys.
This is Darcy, my wife Tina's niece.
More or less.
That's what the pause button's for. It's time to work; it's child labor day.
Think you could reach that? 
It's kind of hard to sabotage a showerhead you can't touch.
Come on, you're almost there! It's building character!
Wait a minute. I got something. Let me clean up this image.
I see a cart, Sara.
It's enough for reasonable doubt.
Yeah.
Whew, somebody used some heavy artillery on that psychic.
'Cause your former lab boy begged me for it. He offered to take my next holiday on-call. I thought he was nuts, but I wasn't going to pass him up. To be honest with you, Grissom, my wife's having a hard time with my schedule. She's spending a lot of time alone. I didn't think it would be that big of a deal.
All right.
What do you got?
Okay, I'm on it.
Your prints were found at the crime scene.
You want to explain to me why your prints were found on the cash register?
She was killed and then robbed, and your prints are on her cash register.
You delivered to her last night?
Is there anyone who can confirm that?
She got a name?
Would you stand up, please.
No. You can strip down to your skivvies.
He said they were shaped like stars.
Blue.
Thanks.
Greg, what are you doing here?
The next time you screw me up with Grissom, I'm going to back you up right off a cliff.
Let's go.
You must be Tammy.
Is there a quiet place where we could talk?
He is. Have you seen him?
Was he here last night?
The cops find the gun or the stolen cash in the vehicle?
Well, the victim took him for several grand. He's not ditching the money.
Tight suit, baby.
No, I mean it, looks good on you.
What was it doing in the cash register?
Well, it says here, when Wallace was a cop, he worked the northwest substation, that includes Summerlin.
So, where would his parameters be?
Wallace worked northwest from January 1990 to August '92. He responded to like 20 crime scenes in Summerlin. If we just limit it down to the remote location ...
Summerlin's changed a lot over the last ten years.
Grissom! I've got something!
Clear!
What's this around the neck?
Yeah?
I'm thinking this dog was an amputee.
This contraption. Looks like the, uh, canine equivalent of a wheelchair. My grandmother had a neighbor whose dog was hit by a car. The dog lived, but the doctor had to amputate the hind legs mid-femur.
This is the hind femur, or what's left of it. You see how it was cut?
You know, if Sneakers here was a handicapped dog, ID-ing it just became a whole lot easier.
Yeah, I'm sure he wasn't ready for this photo shoot.
Well, there's plenty of drugs around here. You think he OD'd?
What are you doing?
Yeah. Now he's the next River Phoenix.
Did you find the body?
Did you touch or move the body in any way?
Did you pat him down?
Would you mind standing up for us, sir?
What else are you on, man?
What about Julian?
Did someone turn a shower on or something?
Hey! Are you okay?
And a bag for stomach contents.
Yeah. I've got vodka, champagne, cocaine ...
I've got some smudges over here. 
I've got some footprints.
I think someone was standing right there.
If those are his footprints ... where are hers?
You want to swab this?
Really? I guess he was just acting about the clean-living part. COD?
Asphyxiated how?
Did you find any fibers in his nose or mouth?
That doesn't rule out suffocation. Killer could have used something that didn't shed fibers.
s*x, drugs and movies: the American Dream.
Your stomach contents contain alcohol and traces of Triazolam.
It's a sleeping pill, has you reading the inside of your eyelids for a week.
We also found cocaine in your bloodstream. I guess you didn't take that, either?
It's not an offer, it's our job.
Julian Harper will not be there.
The coroner finished the autopsy early this morning.
Yes. So we're going to need to take a sample of your DNA.
Been a while, Arch?
Who'd you hear that from?
Okay, that's Julian's manager.
I don't know. I think she could be the killer.
Wait a minute. What kind of hired killer takes their payoff and goes to the mall?
You left Julian Harper's room at 2:33. A couple of minutes later, you're taking money from his manager.
Couple hours later, Julian's dead.
Oh, so you stalked him? Is that it? And then you killed him?
Is the club Skin on your school schedule?
But you took the money, and you bought a purse with it.
Hodges, do you have the results on the fibers that we dropped off to ... ?
Hodges?
Dude. He's asleep.
You were out.
Dyed black? The bedding might have been cotton, but it wasn't black.
The comforter and draperies may have been poly, but they weren't black, either.
This could be the source of the fibers. He wasn't suffocated with his crew sock.
Did you notice the burn mark on the knot in these pantyhose at the crime scene?
I don't know.
You making overtime?
Mm-hmm. NICK: Mm-hmm.
Tell me about these pantyhose.
Well, I did find black cotton fibers under his chin.
Yeah, this guy Julian Harper's an actor, so I'm sure he didn't want bruises on his neck to be showing on camera.
I don't see how we could have missed anything. There's no fireplace here. I haven't seen any lighters.
Hey.
There's some burnt residue on this lamp.
You know what I think? I think someone tied him up, and they couldn't get the knot undone, because it melted. So they panicked. And they pulled the hose down.
I'll print the light.
I guess even having an unlimited supply of hot women is not enough, huh? Bondage s*x with your best friend?
Well, we found both your prints and Julian's prints on a light fixture above the bed.
Griss, we closed that actor case.
Accidental death as a result of auto-erotic asphyxiation. 
It's a waste. Guy had everything -- money, fame ...
And who the hell would rob them up there? Andre the Giant?
Hey, Doc, is it just me, or did something crush his legs?
What do you think this is?
Yeah.
Well ... I did find casings in such a wide distribution ... and a lot of them were flattened, so it suggests to me that the killer was moving when he was shooting.
Yeah, with a hit-and-run chaser.
Hodges, you getting anywhere with that steel rod we found?
Oh, this guy was driving a street hopper. Low-riders get little clearance ...
I'm sure he was more busted up about his ride being damaged than the three kids he whacked.
Cool.
Don't make me shoot you.
Sounds like the wrong name might've just popped up.
What's the matter, man? You worried about having some hard times if you give your homey's name up?
How 'bout we do this? How 'bout you let us muscle you off your computer, and we can get the information ourselves? That way, if you're ever asked, you can say there was nothing you could do. You can let us do our jobs, and we'll be out of your hair.
Jeremiah Calvin, 59391 Sandhill.
About fifteen minutes.
Hello. There's our gangster ride right there.
Yep.
Look at that.
I think I'll go get him now, man, before I lose that boy.
He's reaching for something.
Hey, what are you doing?
Son, get back in the car.
Dispatch, we got a code three.
Son, you trying to win the wet tee shirt contest? My partner here's a great shot.
Listen --
You don't listen - 
You have a hard time listening, huh?
He's clean?
Not good.
No, don't talk to him.
Hey, buddy.
How you doing? You all right?
Nick, ... 
Nick ... 
Nick!
Why don't you take a whiff?
'Cause it's your job.
Red wine.
It's not on his pants. What about the shirt?
So he must have changed after the mess.
Clothes are brand new.
Looks like a callus.
I got a shell casing. Nine millimeter.
What are you thinking?
Me and Tina? Happened so fast. Time will tell. Why don't you take a look at this phone here and tell me what you think.
A neighbor called it in. If someone was in the house, they'd have dialed 9-1-1.
Maybe. I just wish it was a print and not a smudge.
All right.
Hey. I found these in his jacket.
Looks like the husband was planning a little vacation. A little recreation on the side.
So someone was walking around here with grass on their shoes?
Maybe it was the missing husband, or a desperate gardener.
No, but I think I found one that Mr. Cutler likes.  Thumb print on the front. Four fingerprints on the back.
Well, I don't really think there's any sleeping involved.
Don't be shy, though. Give her a call.
Yeah, right.
This is the man that we're looking for. Please keep your eyes peeled. He may have been here last night. I want you to cover every square inch of this place. Let's spread out; let's move it.
So, this is Sammy Cutler. This is his mug shot. It's a few years old, and this is what he looks like now.
Keep looking.
What's up?
Where you at?
Who you talking about?
Me or the guy standing next to you? Look up. You see that little dome above your head? Give it a wave. That's me in the surveillance room, watching you lie to me.
Man, and I didn't even have to call that show 'Cheaters.' 
Don't even bother coming home tonight. I'll just text you the storage space your stuff'll be in.
I can see what's up. 
Brown.
Are you with Willie right now?
We're still looking for him in surveillance. It could take some time.
Okay, Brass, we're doing the best we can. I want you to hang in there, take care of yourself. If he's in this casino, we're going to find him.
This guy was rolling on all cylinders. He was bound to throw a rod.
Wallet's empty.
I got a noisemaker.
Point two-eight?! That's barely conscious for most people. That's like falling down drunk. 
Wow. If it was illegal, fun or nasty, this guy was into it.
Was there enough for DNA?
Oh, I don't really know. I ... you know what? Let me call you back, okay?
Ellie?  Hey. You know your father's out of surgery.
It's a little too early to tell, but I know when he wakes up, he'll be happy to see you.
I know so. You look good.
That's not what I meant, but no.
Look, what do you want me to say, hmm? It's not really about you right now, okay? But the fact that you're here is saying a lot.
Are you finished processing those prints from Manny Rupert's apartment?
We're looking for anything the hooker might have touched. We're thinking she might have slipped him something that pushed him over the edge.
Hmm. Maybe she's not a killer.
Miss Rupert, as far as we can tell, your brother died from diabetic shock.
Well, it seems that he went on a bender. He consumed a great deal of alcohol, sugar and narcotics. Did he party like this a lot?
So he was aware of his condition.
Do you think that this was self-induced? 
Hmm.
So he just ... gave up? He quit?
No. You're right, I don't. 
But I've seen what it's like to not have a choice. And he did. He could have fought it, but he just chose not to.
I'm-I'm so very sorry for your loss.
Hey, Sanders.
So I can assume those bloody footprints aren't hers.
I'm ready.
The blue markers denote the footprints. They're all consistent with the husband.
The footprints are associated with gravitational blood drops.
The yellow markers denote the paramedics' boot prints.
It's a single blood drop. 
I'm thinking that's from when the husband reached for the phone.
This ...
... is a bloody paper towel I found in the trash. It's too textured to print, but Sanders talked to the paramedics, who confirmed that it wasn't theirs. I'm thinking it was from the husband when he tried to clean up and saw it wouldn't be too easy.
They don't tell you about this part of the job when you're training to become a CSI.
You ready?
Well, hello, Jackie Lester. On three. 
One ... two ... three.
You done with your alone time, Doc?
So both of Ray's wives end up dead at the bottom of the stairs with lacerations to the head.
Huh. The blood's continuous. 
What about the scalp lacerations?
So she must've hit her head on the stairs on the way down.
Dirty dozen.
Well, I've matched the shoes from all the bodies in the bunker to the impressions that we found at the scene.
It's a size eight athletic shoe. I can't account for it. It doesn't belong to the guy who was dumped there, and I've already ruled out Mr. and Mrs. Copeland.
Ah.
Ahh ...
Can't we just make out?
I don't care, Mrs. Brown.
What time you get off shift?
Who knows?
I didn't say anything. You got to admit, though, working around the ex is a little strange. 
It was a year ago.
I do trust you.
Diamond was running a cash business. He had all those kids write home and ask for money. His return address was a P.O. Box that I found.
We assumed that they were ingesting a liquid ketamine.
Spencer, you said?
Well, ma'am, you see, the letters that we recovered were damaged. Not all of them yielded a name.
Ma'am ... would you be able to identify Abigail?
Nick, you have that employee list from the vet's office?
Abigail Spencer. She was a cult member. She used to work for your vet until last year, and she's missing.
I'll call Brass.
What a mess.
Yeah. Well, I'm gonna start upstairs.
If it's labeled correctly, it's, uh, Cassie's laugh.
Our man Jeremy's a bit of an entrepreneur here.
He's trafficking in term papers.
Whew ... ! Looks like someone shot out the lock upstairs. I found what looked like fragments of two bullets; they may be too m-and-d for a comparison, but I could probably get type and caliber.
Man. If those suspects got everything on those lines, they made out like fat cats.
Well, we're talking about getting rich, not getting high, you know? And these dry ones go a lot faster than those. The price of an ounce these days is anywhere from $200 to $400.
What are you, his lawyer? Whoever stole the pot ... had a gun and shot the lock off the basement door.
Hand that over to Sheriff Brackett. He can run the account number.
This microscope I got from the high school is a joke. How am I ever going to prove that this is the pot from the house? Where's that evidence we collected?
All right, this is the bag from the house. And this is the bag from the car. 
The striations line up. These bags are from the same roll.
Mark knew the pot was there because of Jeremy. Come on, I'm sure Jeremy wasn't voted the most popular boy in school. He's done everyone's term paper. He's a nerd.
I was talking to Tina the other night. She said something to make me think.
Tina's dad is a doctor of anthropology, so, one day, when she was a little girl, she asked her dad where on her body her anthropology was. You know, he's a doctor. Mark's dad's a lawyer.
Maybe Mark was thinking habeas corpus -- 'body of the crime'? 
Yeah, but a kid could easily misinterpret. Maybe he's thinking, 'no body, no crime, no crime, no punishment.'
I'll give it over to Archie and see if he can clean it up. Thanks.
You want to draw straws?
Call me if you need me.
COD?
Dad wrestled with the gun, huh?
Anything else?
..22 ... probably from a revolver.  Six shots. Four in the bodies, two in the lock. Well, that would explain why we didn't find Cassie's blood in the house. They ran out of bullets.
Sara, the bullets pulled from the bodies were from a .22-caliber revolver. Ibis bounced back a hit. They were entered into Ibis from the Department of Wildlife, for shooting a deer with a small caliber handgun. Firearm was returned to the owner -- a Chris Daniels from Pioche, Nevada.
Okay, guys. I swept the perimeter. I think someone jimmied the back kitchen door.
Now, I printed the doorknob. Nothing but smudges. Check out the fresh scrapings there on the doorjamb and the striker plate.
Good eyes.
Well, she kind of has a point. I do like to take the wife out to dinner every now and then.
Wow.
I'm sure you got an 'A.'
Mm-hmm.
No, I processed the bathroom and the countertops for some kind of plastic laminate.
Really? Was she dating one of your co-workers?
Well, we found marble particles in her house and we identified the stone. It came from this facility.
You followed her into the house?
What did you talk about?
I think we all know how to operate in front of a camera.
You'll be all right.
Miss ... 
Calm down, okay? I'm sorry for your loss. I'm with the Crime Lab. Talk to one of the detectives. Miss ...
Can I get some backup here, please?
I just want to do my job here.
Can we lock this place up and move that crime tape down another block?
Yeah. We don't do anything wrong, we got nothing to worry about.
I got over firing AK's a long time ago.
Hey ... mustache boy, come over here and check this out.
Get a load of that.
Like one in a million.
The bullet jammed this cylinder. You know, I couldn't clear this gun at the scene. I should've noticed these bullet fragments. I guess I got distracted.
I think it would have felt like a normal recoil. Besides, it was like the wild west out there.
This suspect had one live round left. It saved Davis's life.
We still have to place it in Rosario's hand.
You run the gauntlet?
Yeah. I'm trying to prove Rosario here held the gun.
I'm hoping this stuff reacts to the traces of iron that may have been left on his skin. It'll further refute any argument that the gun was a plant.
Yeah. That would do it.
He's carrying a nine.
We'll run this gun against the cartridge case from that poor kid on the bike.
I'm guessing you didn't save up for that one, huh?
Where did that come from?
This was not some doped up drive-by. The shooter had skill. Just one shot went through the ten ring. 
I don't know.
I'll check the phone records and see if there was any calls in or out.
That would put him in the right position.
Good job.
Nice.
.223 Remington. Most likely from a semi-auto.
Yeah. Wasn't afraid of getting caught. I'll give it to Bobby. Have him run it through IBIS. See if the gun was used before.
Bobby, police said they entered my cartridge case from the sniper into IBIS.
Okay.
Oh, Tina, baby -- no. Peanut butter without the jelly? She's trying to get me to cut down on sugar. But this is ridiculous.
Thanks.
Every time I get a speeding ticket, yeah.
No, I prefer the scientific side of law enforcement.
Brown. Hey, Catherine.
Really.
And delivering them to the guys up the food chain.
You think these are the same guys who whacked Fausto?
We're talking about the difference between life without parole and the needle, here.
Grissom, I managed to get a hit off of that sniper's cartridge case. Links up to a drug rip-off in L.A. last year -- unsolved.
Fausto made one call about an hour before he died. We ran it down to a disposable mobile phone.
No, I'm not going to court. I'm taking my Lady Tina to that new Cirque show at the Wynn and I forgot my tickets in my locker.
Oh, your wife made a pie.
I'm impressed.
Let's take it easy with the cutting there, doc, it's starting to look like the hit-and-run on your table last week.
Thanks.
Low taste.
I was watching that on cable. Some Japanese guy ate, like, 64 hot dogs in 12 minutes.
You know, if you want to cleanse your taste buds, I suggest you try Doc Robbins' pie. Really.
The gun's still in his hand. How many suicides have you seen like that?
Me, either.
Maybe it was staged.
David, the gun is still in his hand; it's yours to clear.
You all right?
Hey. At least we know one person who shot the dead guy.
Brass looks like he's about to puke.
What about me?
Where's the love?
So we found some gunk in the revolver's forcing cone. Hodges ID'd it as ... melted sesame seeds.
No. The grip was checked. We don't usually get prints off those.
In California, to a Joe Hirschoff.
Yeah.
Really?
Sounds like a great reason to kill.
Everything from Hirschoff's and O'Brien's room that I could get under the warrant.
Not even in the Holy Bible.
No.
'Shut up, Hodges'?
Hand me that can of ferro-trace.
The gun was transported to the hotel room in the oven mitt. The only question is, who brought it to the party?
Hey, Jim.
Where's your hardware?
Don't even try it; you were all over the news. Let's see it.
Wow. That's beautiful. What's with all the modesty? It should be up on your wall, man.
For being brave.
All right.
Hey.
Yeah, smells like used diapers.
Maybe not. I mean, this apartment is neat as a pin. A lady this tidy wouldn't leave a broken dish in a rack like that, you know?
What do you make of this? A busted phone ...
-- with gray hairs in it.
I doubt very highly that those were self-induced.
Look at that: it's dented.
Looks like she may have been slammed into her own oven.
Sofia, you get a tenant's name for this apartment?
This place has a direct view of the old lady's apartment.
So, what, the guy's killing the old lady, -- 
-- he sees he's being watched, and he, what, comes back here and whacks the witness?
That's good.
Hi. I'm Warrick Brown from the Crime Lab.
Well, ma'am, we're going to need your daughter's clothes from yesterday.
And you're a princess.
Okay, Suzy, tell me about Max. What's Max like?
How come you didn't know that Paula Sullivan wasn't home?
A big mess? What color was the mess?
Hmm ... Did Max try to hug you or touch you?
Did Max seem surprised to see all that big mess there?
What did Max do next?
I bet you're right. You know what? Could you help me? I've got a picture right here. And I have some crayons, too. Could you draw where the red and the green is in the room?
So the green was all the way up here in the cabinets, too?
Did you help him clean up the mess?
And then what happened?
Hey, Gris. So, uh, Hodges tells me you're flying the coop. What's the matter, you sick of baby-sitting?
I've still got a lot to learn. Besides, having you around kinda keeps me honest.
Thanks. It means a lot. You know I got you covered. What, are you sending those to the... the Louvre?
So how long is this fellow Keppler supposed to be with us?
Please tell me she got a piece of her attacker.
Warrick Brown.
I know ... You trying to do a geographic profile of your serial?
I tell you one thing that your dumpsites do have in common.
When the bodies were found, the location that they were found in at the time had the highest crime rate in the city.
Well, in Vegas, new is old in five years, old is history in ten, and nothing ever seems to leave a mark.
Hey, Mike.
In a perfect world. We hired this, uh, knucklehead named Mahoney. He had this dyslexic filing system. 
What? 
Oh ... I get it.
Hey, guys.
What'll go faster?
We're here to process those stolen motorcycles, man.
Okay, cut us some slack here, man. You think we really feel like being down here?
How do you want to handle this?
I'd love to bust a cap in his knee.
Brown. Hey, Cath. We'll see you there. Well, in that case ... I'll see you there.
Well, giddyup.
CSI coming through. 
Thank you.
Where's the body?
Got ID?
Hey, Cath, didn't you find Zamesca near here?
Got the 'Jumbo' cup. Shoe and tire impressions. Shot in his car. Think Simon's coming out of hiding?
Want me to take the backseat?
Okay, sarge. Not my first barbecue.
Small-time drug dealer with a big-time rap sheet.
Well, the Holstein scene bullet was fired from the same gun that you found in Rat's car.
I'm not so sure. If this bullet went through the window and a guy's head ... it would have pieces of glass and bits of bone in it.
This hollow point's clean. There's no sand-blasted effect.
There's still blood on it.
You'd better be able to back that one up, man.
Could have come from the same supplier. 
I did see Keppler checking out Zamesca's file yesterday. I didn't think anything strange about it then, but now ...
Catherine put it in a temporary locker.
The Holstein bullet was a little bit too clean, and Keppler didn't seem at all concerned about it. He said that we would see at autopsy.
We got the car.
Catherine sent it to the impound.
I'll run with you.
You?
Brown.
Never.
You know what? Sara's here. And she has the key. Got to go.
I hate being deceived.
Yes.
All right.
Anything I collected, we ignore.
This glass wasn't shot out. Take a look at that.
The only mark a spark plug makes is a nick at the center. Now, who would know about that? 
Means the blood didn't come from his head; it came from his arm.
Well, if Keppler is IA, Catherine can't tell us anything if she wanted to.
Maybe Brass can help us out. 
And your only option was to fabricate evidence and make me process it?
You want to, uh, get a drink or something?
Nick. Nick!
Let it go, man.
Living large.
Place this big in MacDonald Ranch -- what's the occupation?
Huh.
What did he say?
That'll be good motive for the husband.
But then where's the 'someone else'? I mean, why kill her and not the lover?
Maybe the husband was the one having the honeymoon and the ... the wife walks in.
He kills her, tells his lover to beat it.
Look at this. Valet ticket. Nice purse. Nice dress. Maybe safe to say she went out last night. Maybe this will tell where.
I'm gonna follow a little lead I got.
Well, I found a circular blood transfer in the bathroom ... 
... about three inches in diameter.
Looks like we found our murder weapon.
What you got?
Synthetic hair. So much for DNA.
Excuse me, have you seen this man?
Check out the pink wig.
I'm crying for you.
What are you talking about?
Why do you think you're being arrested?
With or without the help of her husband.
Upstairs?
Take her downtown. We're going upstairs.
If it is, I'm scared of the menu.
The bus boy looks likes he's in charge of stocking the champagne. I'm gonna have a word with him.
Really?
Are they doing what I think they're doing?
So you heard Cotton Candy's alibi checked out?
And Brass talked to Mr. Dorton's limo driver. Confirms his story, he got home way past TOD.
It doesn't make any sense. Like this void on the sofa for instance. It suggests the presence of a third person, but we don't have any evidence to back that up.
It was obviously important enough that the killer took it.
Kid had a hard life if he had to take it to the streets to make a buck.
What about the vomit that we found in the toilet at the crime scene?
Well, the hosts drink a lot and throw up a lot. Busboy says he always finds blood in the toilets. If Jesse's a host, chances are he's throwing up blood, too.
I don't bet sports anymore.
Welcome back.
Well, I'm just following a lead off some serialized butt implants.
What are you doing here?
Well ... we got a, uh, dead prostitute's apartment. It's obvious that it's been ransacked and robbed. I'm thinking that she was the target of the double and the cop was collateral.
You can hit the dinette. I haven't taken that yet. Unless you're avoiding her paperwork, too. There's a lot of it.
Telephone. Hooker's lifeline.
I'm telling you, whoever hit this place left a lot of prints.
You ever hear of 'reverse forensics'?
So how is it that your prints ended up all over her apartment?
Did I mention she was dead?
PJ, you know what I think? I think you killed her. You took her purse, went to her apartment and stole all her stuff.
Well, she's dead. And so is the cop she was with. That's the death penalty.
Right there in the dumpster?
Oh, like a Good Samaritan?
So what'd you do?
But you didn't do that, did you?
Where was the dumpster?
Behind the Palermo.
He also said he didn't know the victim. Maybe he's lying about that, too. I'm sorry, Catherine. I like the guy, too, but I'm just following the evidence here.
He also searched the dumpster where the homeless guy found the hooker's purse and cell phone. He told Catherine he didn't find anything.
I don't see anything.
All right.
I'll call you back.
Keppler left his phone so we'd find the hand.
What's with the bloody dolls?
Or a disciple.
Classic cars.
Izzy Delancy ... he was a rock star. You know, famous brings out the nut jobs. Maybe we're just looking at a copycat.
Yeah, so, Ernie Dell takes the rap for three murders, and then eats a .38. Why?
Talk to me.
Probably, but whatever it is, it should match exactly. The killer's hyper-specific.
Hey.
Let's check it out.
She's got a cat.
That's her home.
Open it and stand clear.
Ms. Tallman ...
Dr. Tallman ... I need you to take a look at this.
It's a death threat.
No, Miss, no, but we think someone else has. Doctor, your life is in danger. We need you to get dressed and come with us, please.
Thank you.
Is she on something?
We'll get her to the hospital.
And any open food or drink.
Except for us showing up.
Warrick Brown from the Crime Lab.  Thanks for coming in on a Saturday.
You took these.
Well, that's a nice shot right there.
So I guess he's passionate about photography.
Yeah. Did you notice any drama yesterday in class between Megan and Ryan?
Hmm. Ms. Kentner, what kind of cameras do you use in class?
And what about your own personal collection?
Just following up on some evidence. And Ryan called you after the game last night.
And he called you on your cell?
No, thanks. I've ... I've already got it.
The keys are still in the ignition. There's no blood on the driver's seat.
Body dump?
Yeah, a bunch of minors that won't be in the system. That'll be helpful.
What you got?
I don't know.
I think he might be always thinking pink.
If these all belong to one girl, she's got nothing left to wear.
Ooh. How'd he explain that one?
Yeah, right.
Let's hope your taste in men has improved since then.
'I'm likin' basketball, virgin daiquiris, and sweet, sweet ladies.'
Well, he's not an assassin. His van was like a hot sheets motel, and he wants a password.
It's too obvious.
I'll try it anyway.
'Sheila L.-- couldn't move it. Bunny B. is a honey bee. Diane K. taught me a thing or two.' Diane K. Diane Kentner is his photography teacher.
Now, what's a photography teacher doing touching a student's van?
Ms. Kentner, the car that hit Megan Cooper left a broken turn signal light in the road. It's from a Saab. Isn't that the car that you drive?
Well, we're going to need to take a look at yours.
We also found your fingerprint on the door handle of the back of Ryan's van. Could you explain to me how that got there?
Your name came up on, uh, Ryan Lansco's FriendAgenda page, what was called a 'Hit List.' It's apparently a list of people that he slept with.
So, you are denying that you had any sexual relations with Ryan Lansco?
Well, we're going to need to take a DNA sample, and that I have a warrant for.
So, what you find at Diane's house?
There's our busted headlight.
What the hell is that?
I'm slipping, Grissom. I talked to this woman twice, and this body was here the whole time.
She was on a daily dose of lithium. Bipolar.
What is this, Grissom, Romeo and Juliet?
Charlie lied ... to protect Megan.
Hell of a way to spend your night off.
Three.
Grissom's down the hall, first door on your right. Just follow the blood.
She looks so familiar.
I'm not so sure that's a good thing.
Sounds like Becca was still a kid.
So, Grissom, I found beige carpet fibers on all three victims. It's consistent with the hallway carpet. I've also found rug burns on their knees.
What about Becca? Why wasn't she dragged somewhere else?
Well, a gun is one good way for crowd control. Why didn't he just shoot them?
Six girls, one lock.
'They pooled their money and lived the dream in style.'
Well, it says 'Green Valley,' it's got a photo of the house. If you looked hard enough, you could find it.
'Lewis' is the name on a custom wine label that we found at the crime scene. Do me a favor. Could you zoom in on that photo?
Oh, my God. I knew I recognized her. Emily Wilson.
No, last time I saw her, she was still wearing braces.
I don't remember any trouble.
Oh, and I banged the bumper trying to parallel park. I forgot about that one.
Yeah, the old neighborhood reminds me how much I miss her.
I came to see you.
Let me take that for you. New family painted right over my history.
Oh, God.
Mrs. Wilson ...
Um ...
I'm working this case. Those six showgirls ...
Emily listed you as the next of kin.
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.
Well, DNA confirmed that Mullins had s*x with Emily and Lauren. Assuming he's the killer, why didn't we find any semen in Becca?
Whoever ... shanked Frost killed those girls.
I don't get it. He stabs the guy and walks back in the bar.
Well, that's also how he could've made the connection to Becca.
Little bit outside of her neighborhood, isn't it?
Party clothes shredded. Breaded abrasions. Must've hit the ground moving.
Maybe she was killed first, and this is a body dump at high speed.
I'm gonna go see if I can figure out where this started.
I'm sorry for your loss, Mrs. Gentry, but we could really use your help. Is there anyone in this neighborhood that your daughter might have been going to see last night?
Excuse me. 
Hey, Cath. Yeah. Are you serious? You're kidding, right? I'm actually with the mother right now. I'll handle it.
Ma'am, your daughter's alive.
We made a mistake. The victim that we found was carrying your daughter's ID.
Yes. She just spoke with my supervisor; she's fine.
All right. There's just one thing. We still need to identify the victim. Could you tell me if you recognize this girl?
Hey, hey, hey. Catherine.
It's all over the radio. I heard.
We're gonna get Lindsey back, okay?
Okay.
Slow down, slow down.
Catherine, I know this is really hard, okay, but could you take a break or get a cup of tea or something here?
I got it.
Oh, this is from this couple from San Francisco. Bought a second home in Seven Hills, came back and found it tossed.
The chair.
Look at that. The chair.
Catherine! Don't touch her!
If you want a conviction, you have to let me do this, all right? Let me do it, all right?
Lindsey, you're gonna be fine.
Almost. Almost.
What now?
Well, I hope it's a tight end in a G-string.
Hey, what can I say? Erotic athletes are kind of gratuitous with the hands. And lube on latex leaves excellent ridge detail. What's with the, uh, blast from the past? You got new evidence on the miniatures?
One ring, six women. Ursula Major claims Ursula Minor was responsible for the pile drive. Only you, my dear, will know for sure. Have fun.
Hmm, yeah, Joe Louis, George Foreman, Ali, Marciano, Frazier, Tyson --
Oh, Doc, could you wait till I leave? Thanks.
Looks like letters of some kind. What is that?
You know, there's some food, you just shouldn't see where it comes from.
Ahead of dogs?
I don't see Connors' truck anywhere.
There's the truck.
If this is Chyna De Vere's blood, we're getting warmer.
Looks like he had a hobby -- stuffed animals.
Yeah?
Why's that?
A little tip for you: The new Mrs. Phillips doesn't need to hear about this.
Wendy got results back on the blood from Connors' workbench in the pickup truck. It's Chyna De Vere.
Hey, isn't that, uh ... ?
Came back to Shannon.
Hey, Nick!
I got something over here.
'To Chyna, Love, Preston.' 
Till death do us part.
She doesn't look so happy to see him.
Well, we don't need words to get that.
Well, that means she was killed before she had a chance to change her clothes. That would explain why we found both rings in the ashes. But it doesn't explain what happened to him.
But that means the bullet had to pass through at least one vital organ.
And you're sure these are Chyna De Vere's bones.
Okay. Well, we'll run this against Connors' guns.
Fire in the hole!
Hey, you were supposed to be ready.
I don't know, man. Maybe it would have worked out if Tina was someone who did what we did. At least she'd understand the hours.
You mean, like me and you, baby?
Mm-hmm.
So how'd she get here?
He's probably at the 420 on Flamingo. They left their purse.
Oh! The thing is heavier than my kid. Ever get hit in the head with one of these? 
Keysha Sayrun?
Well, that's not her.
There's a whole bunch of wallets in here. Driver's permit. Kid's only 15 --
-- has got a credit card? She's got to be a pickpocket.
I got her.
Faith Maroney. Twenty-five ... from Southern Highlands.
Yeah? Well, I miss the days when we only had five homicides a week.
What's the matter, Doc; you been hitting it a little too hard?
No, if I stay up all night, it's not going to be because of a puppy. COD?
Any idea what kind of weapon might have been used?
Paint chips? Could she have been hit by a car?
So if she wasn't standing or lying down ...
She got noodles, hairpins, dish towels, a can of tuna.
You know, I was thinking. If she pinched my wallet, and I whacked her for it, I'd probably get back my wallet before I split.
A couple of loose receipts, all from last night, all paid in cash. A pack of gum from the Bargain Bin, a soda from Carlisa's, and a Bloody Mary from Diane's Steakhouse.
Yeah. At 9:52 p.m.
Steakhouse called Faith Maroney a cab. They have a direct line to this place.
Paint color's not going to help us narrow it down any, is it?
Around 10:00?
Well, we're going to need to see that cab and your trip sheet.
Hey, Nick, there's a camera in here. Maybe that'll be able to tell us if Princess Pickpocket was one of his fares.
You see him last night?
Can you clarify the background?
So Mr. Kambhatla was lying. That's nowhere near the Monte Carlo.
Go back to number two.
The wallet in her hand is ... black. And her wallet was white. 
And he ran her down and took it back.
Well, we have him in custody. We have his wallet. Let's, uh, go see if her prints are on it.
How small are we talking?
Paint samples from 75 cabs? Well, we'll be back in the lab by next week.
So the impact turns it on, huh?
7029 -- that's Dru's cab.
Well, he had to be staging, trying to steal Dru's fare.
Whoa.  Well, that's the corner.
Well, the airbags didn't deploy, so he must have been going under fifteen miles an hour.
You were in the wrong. You were the one who was staging. So why road rage Mr. Kambhatla?
-- show no activity for the past twelve days. So far, that's the best I can do for a time of death.
She has to make these in advance, right? But how do you plan a car wreck? There's no way to know how the car's going to land.
Unless you wreck the car first, and then put her under it.
What?
I don't get it. What does Sara have to do with bleach?
Hiking accident?
It's better than the express route she took.
Okay, Mr. Boy Scout.
Well, looks like she bounced around a lot up here at the top before she caught air.
You pay for 'hot,' believe me.
Oh, I see it. You're getting warm.
Hotter by the foot.
There you go.
That's amazing.
Sir, is that the camera that you used?
May I see it?
What did you do after she fell?
I'd say.
Well, I did find some blood on the rocks at the top of the cliff, as well as a piece of his shirt. Looks like it was a bumpy ride all the way down.
She tore up her hands grabbing on to anything she could.
Was that sustained during the fall ... or did someone step on her hand?
Tina, baby, can you give me a call when you get this? Listen, I know we haven't been spending quality time with each other, but I was thinking tonight we could ...
Work comes first. What's up?
That's a dangerous combination.
Well, would you let your wife drink if she was on medication?
So let me get this straight. You took your depressed wife to the top of Red Rock Canyon, shared a bottle of wine, and then you went on a nature hike?
Maybe it wasn't a suicide, but then again, you're the only one left. You can say anything you want.
According to the coroner, the evidence suggests that her hands may have been stepped on.
Well, if he is lying, somebody should give him an Emmy award.
Yeah. Ultimately, I think he is responsible, whether he meant harm or not.
Well, what if I can prove she tried to kill herself before?
Well, I have her phone. I could go through the most recent calls. If I know women, the husband's usually the last person to know anything.
We have a witness. Why did you kill your wife, Mr. McGill?
You got a name?
What about ID?
Cell phone?
Hey.
Well, we got a souvenir cup that screams 'tourist.'
I don't see a bar anywhere around here. She must've been either going to or coming from the strip.
You know these tourists don't know what they're getting when they book a trip to Vegas online. 
They think 'I got a room on the strip for 75 bucks. Whoo, what a deal.'
You know what? Grissom's crime scene is just five blocks from here. Both victims had their wallets and their cell phones stolen. And they were both beaten down in the same way.
I think I just found a piece of Sanders' hair.
You fellas want to keep it moving? We're trying to work here.
Hey, Nick ...
Nick.
Nick ... 
Nick. Come on!
That's a nice phone you got there, man. Real nice phone. Wonder how many drug dealers' numbers you got on this phone here.
Feel like going to jail tonight? Listen, I'm sorry about the little spill you had earlier, but that's why we got the crime tape up, so you could see it. Watch where you're going next time.  Get you home safely.
What are you doing? We beating people up now?
Then you're in the wrong town.
I'll take a ride with you, but I'm going to pass on the Mexican food at 10:00 in the morning.
It's about time. Finally, some good news.
Are you kidding? Who raises these kids?
Oh, you're doing a great job. Lindsey's gonna turn out to be a beautiful young woman. Besides, I grew up in Vegas. I didn't turn out so bad, did I?
Yeah, these kids need to beat people on the street to be entertained. They just need some good discipline.
They need their grandmother whupping their ass like, like I had.
Considering where we are, highly symbolic. All right, what do you got? How we gonna do this?
I wouldn't be surprised to find it around here someplace.
Yeah.
Yeah, ready.  Oh. Whoever tied her up there had to be strong enough to deadlift her weight.
He didn't bring anything with him?
What does this feel like to you?
I mean maybe one of the construction workers wasn't a fan of the victim. I'm going to call Brass.
What?
Bull.
They have red cows?
Or maybe it was secondary transfer.
Well, so far, the only prints I found in the bedroom are Carl Fisher's. No semen stains in the bed. And nothing to indicate children.
What's that?
Grandpa play golf?
Doesn't mean he didn't follow them here. A killer wouldn't take time to bury him that way; it was too nice. It suggests whoever killed him cared about him, knew him, you know?
A ten-year old could fit in there, huh?
Is that the tox report for Lucas Hanson?
Geezus. It's a drunk kid.
Oh, perfect way to loosen up a little boy -- give him pizza and whiskey.
Well, I guess he took the aspirin after he hit his head.
Probably the same responsible adult that gave him the whiskey.
Hey.
How'd it go in there?
Really?
You know, I know it was a hardcore situation that Greg ran up on, but you think it ever would have occurred to him to just put it in reverse and get the hell out of there?
I know Greg must have been scared as hell, man.
We'll put the jury behind the wheel of the car.
All right, the Denali's black box reports only five seconds before impact. Now, Greg was idling with his foot on the brake. And then he accelerated for no more than two seconds.
Want to give it a go?
Take it for a spin?
You ready?
Go.
Stop!
You think a jury will see it that way?
What would she have done if she didn't have a second story?
Well, she obviously doesn't have any kids. Place is like a museum. This chick hung out with some big wigs.
So is this.
You can't even use a whole sheet of paper on your suicide note?
She obviously ate at Joie de Vive. It's the only place that still serves old school swan doggie bags.
If you're planning on killing yourself, why do you bring home a doggie bag?
Identical twins? You got to be kidding me.
Oh, it's just too much.
Really?
Well, speaking of dead bodies, uh ...
I don't know, you don't look like you've been put through the ringer.
I hate lawyers. Want to take the bathroom?
I found her naughty drawer.
I don't believe these girls anymore.
Looks like someone's been elevated to drawer status.
Well, I said dude had a drawer, I didn't say it was love.
I'll be taking a look inside her office, okay? 
Did Jill have a computer?
What's with the locked drawer?
Did you ever try to open this drawer?
The shrink might not have done it?
Because Archie found us another strong suspect. You know that flash drive that I found in the locked drawer in Jill Case's office, ? I thought it was just a bunch of photos, but it turns out there was a little bit more than meets the eye.
No.
This got bought by the AP. It was on the front page of the Las Vegas Globe. It won a Pulitzer. It was everywhere.
And Jill printed it. I assume she didn't realize it until it was too late. And before she died, she was trying to figure out how to handle it.
And Jill Case.
I'm sorry, I just don't see Miss Neat Knickers and this guy making it as a couple, you know.
Still no laptop.
This guy's smart. This is all just circumstantial.
Now we know how he got her to write the suicide note. She wasn't sorry to be living. She was sorry that Jake was such a liar.
Yeah.
Even if he was the one that strangled Jill, there was no blood at the crime scene.
So he killed them both.
Coming through. Crime Lab, coming through.
Thank you.
Ready to waste my morning on another Mickey Dunn sighting? Yeah, right.
I know somewhere in hell, Mickey and his old pal Jimmy Hoffa are laughing their asses off at us poor dumb taxpayers.
What do you know.
That looks like him.
A lead .38 round-nose. I like it. It's kind of '70s.
Yeah, but I was a Vegas kid, so I grew up on all those '70s stories. Like the 'Ghost Rider' story. Remember that one?
You never heard of the 'Ghost Rider' story? That has everything to do with Mickey Dunn. Yeah, August 12, 1976. Officer Eddie Sanchez was the real-life motorcycle cop who radios in the last known sighting of Mickey Dunn's funky, gold Cadillac.
It's stuffed away in some police file somewhere. Know what happened to the cop?
No one does. Officer Sanchez and his motorcycle disappeared that night.
A puff of smoke -- never to be heard from again. Legend has it that you can still hear the Ghost Rider gunning up and down that highway. My grandmother used to try to scare me into good behavior with that one.
Not when I was six. No. But a .38 round-nosed lead bullet was what Nevada Highway Patrol used back in the day. And I don't need to tell you there was a lot of dirty cops back then.
Think about this. You're a motorcycle cop. You pull over a speeding gold Cadillac. Sitting in the driver's seat is Mickey Dunn.
Bang. Put a cap in Mickey Dunn.
I think I'd like to find that police file.
What, you got a better story?
No way. You and Mickey Dunn ...?
You were sixteen, hot and ready, and he stood you up?
Could be he hired the others.
Well, check this out. I've been digging through the police files all morning, and guess who I found--Officer Eddie Sanchez. The 'Ghost Rider.' Now, assuming he's alive, the officer would be 55 today. And he has family down in Mexico.
Fast-forward -- Mickey Dunn's car gets discovered.
Either way, whoever did it knew that this car was down there.
A lot of desert landscape drawings.
You saying she drew this from memory?
Great. Sara's location is probably locked away inside of her head.
Great. I'll take it. Keep it there.
They found Natalie's car on Fremont Street.
Give me a second, I'm getting it right now. 
Thirty-four miles, one way.
Grissom.
A zip-tie ... unlocked. I think Sara got out of this trunk. The speaker's completely ripped out from the inside. She could have reached through and released the backseat. And there's blood on the glass. There could have been a struggle.
If she got out of this car, she might not even be in the desert. We might be completely off base here.
I already told you, yes.
Are you guys writing any of this down? I first met Candy in the parking lot of the strip club. Later on, I talked to her inside.
Three hundred bucks, but that was because it was part of an investigation.
Yes ...
No, I'm off them.
That part was personal.
Have you guys bothered to call the motel? I checked in with a credit card. I checked out around 5:00. I called a cab. Talk to the cab driver. When I woke up, Candy was gone. When I got back to the club to pick up my car, she was dead.
No-o-o!
Listen to me. I did not kill her. But I know damn well who did.
Hey, Grissom.
Yeah. They cleared me. They didn't seem to have much interest in Gedda.
It's everything to do with Gedda. Sending me a message. Murders an innocent young girl because I got too close to them. I want this case, Gris.
You got any print results from off my car?
Yeah, I've been cleared.
I know that guy.
Hey! I just want to talk to you.
His name is Richard Dorsey.
Dorsey's prints were found inside my car under the broken window.
Grissom, he's a homeless guy. He lives in the alley behind the strip club. Don't you get it? He's Gedda's fall guy. This is a frame job.
Come on. Tell the truth.
Tell the truth.
We'll take care of you. We'll get you into rehab. Come on.
Tell the truth!
Grissom, you and I both know that Gedda killed that girl and pinned it on that bum. They gave him drugs, got him high, and planted the evidence. You just got to give me a chance to prove it.
Dispatch, this is C-21 Brown. The pickup that you're looking for is on level 3 of the PD garage. Suspect is in the vehicle, armed and agitated.
I repeat: suspect is armed and agitated.
Hey, buddy. Hey. You must be Troy, huh?
Just be cool, okay?
All right?
You didn't go to summer camp.
Thanks.
What are you doing, a catalog shoot? Where's your matching hat with your pom-pom?
Sounds about right.
Hey, buddy.
Oh, man, you look beat up.
Why don't you ... uh ... take a break. I got this.
Yeah.
You're ... uh ... breaking the lab's budget for rubber gloves here, dawg. Listen, get some rest, man. You'd do the same for me.
Yeah, you do.
Ooh.
Hey, Griss. Restocked your case. You were low on batteries and pheno.
You're welcome.
Apartment 5967. Alvarado's crib. Hey, Grissom, I got tickets to the Rebels tomorrow night. If you're feeling any better and you want to check it out.
Yeah. My ears are still ringing, though. This place reeks of sulfur.
I found about ten of these butane cans so far. Any evidence that's here is gone. 
The other guy was probably watching us the whole time.
Grissom, I think I found the point of origin.
I think they were looking to do more than just destroy evidence.
You running for warrants, Mitch?
Impound their cars.
He's bigger than a cop. Show him your hands, princess.
You think this is a game? Huh? This one's clean. 
What about this one? Clean.
What's this? You been baking cookies?
Now, this is everything Alvarado had and was wearing when they arrested him?
Thank you.
Does he get any yard time?
Just want to rattle his cage a bit. That cool with you?
So, you always clean your boots with bleach, El Matocho?
Something funny?
That's great. The way I see it, you're going to have lots of time to tell all kinds of great stories.
Alvarado gets out in the morning.
Exactly.
What are you saying?
I don't see how; the guy's in complete isolation. They even assigned him a special hand-picked guard. Look.
There's no privileges in isolation.
The only thing I saw from the outside was a book. They say he's a big reader. But I looked it over; there's nothing.
One minute we're married, and the next ...
You think?
Oh, that would explain the lookers out front. They were Kitties.
It's a crowded restaurant. Somebody must have seen something.
I think so.
Okay. Got blood on the chair.
Blood on the tablecloth.
Blood drops on the floor, leading away from Hux's chair.
And they end here.
Well, something dripped over here that is not blood.
Could you turn off the lights for a second?
I can see just fine.
Oh.
Yeah, someone left these behind. 
Unless you don't come here for the food.
Mr. Nivens. Are these yours?
I'll take that as a 'yes.'
Then why would your bring military-grade, night vision goggles to the restaurant?
How about a Band-Aid with petals?
What's it doing at a table with four guys?
Looks like there was some kind of struggle.
What do you think it is?
Hey.
Well, there's no reason for this: Michael's print in ink, on a napkin.
His prints hit back to an old work card. The guy used to be a chef.
He lost his sight a few years back. But before that, guess who was his sous-chef?
You know sanitation's flushing out a sewer line. We don't want to block their trucks.
Whoa, what we got here? Hey, guy! Hey!
We've got a male DB.
Maybe someone was trying to teach them a lesson.
Oh yeah, 109. Hot as hell.
Probably cast-off from the beating.
He had a lot of work to do.
The parents weren't that old. The girl would be a teenager at most. So the killer caps Mom and Dad, rapes the girl, and takes her with him.
Alistair Rhodes. Busted in August '94 for child molestation.
Alistair Rhodes. I remember this guy. He was a lounge singer, called himself 'Three Miles of Bad.' It was all over the news.
Yo, Rambar, I have some documents to ...
Where's Rambar?
FBI Lab?
Yeah, along with your pay grade.
In there somewhere is a Nevada plate number and a name. Can you dig it out?
The plate number is 'something, something, something, D, seven, something, something.'
Ooh.
Well, can yoy cross-reference these records against the characters in the vic's last name. It's 'M, A, blank, blank, blank, I, blank, blank.'
Now that's a good start.
Alvin and Girlie Macalino. Let's do it. This makes what, the third power outage since summer?
Las Vegas PD. Is anybody home?
That looks like balut. It's this Filipino delicacy. My grandmother's best friend is from Manila.
The Macalinos must've been in quite a hurry to leave their dinner out like that.
Oh ... so much for the daughter.
It's not.
You know, if I had to gauge it by his apartment, I'd say that Alistair Rhodes is a regular guy.
Hey, Nick. For a guy with his own flip-down ironing board, these shirts look pretty wrinkled.
Child pornography. 
Start with the latest first.
That's enough. Let it play.
This isn't kiddie p0rn.
Hey. I'm trying to make some sense out of the spatter. Now, we've already determined that the ... the killer rolled up his sleeves when he murdered the motel victims, but when I found the shirt, the cuffs were buttoned, and I'm not much bigger than this guy. And look. This is as far as the sleeves go up.
Sure. Here you go.
So Wolflynn wasn't wearing the shirt, was he?
A lot of traffic between Amy and the 'Wolfman.'
It looks like Amy's luring the Wolfman.
Yeah, Wolf and his .22 caliber.
And Amy calls her mom and dad, who come back because they still love her.
Ma'am, your son had a good deal of cash stashed away in his bedroom. Was he saving up for something?
Ma'am, we're not trying to upset you in any way.
Mr. Ludwig, can we see your palms, please?
Depends on what I see.
I'm Warrick Brown.
Well, now, they look like rope burns.
You're putting a nice polish on that wedding band.
Oh, yeah.
Where did you go?
These girls have names?
You better hope we find these girls.
Yeah, our friend Larry Ludwig -- he's sharp as a marble, but his alibi checked out. We found the motel and the girl.
Tucson.
Well, I'll run it, but I don't think it'll matter. I think Brian killed himself.
Yeah.
Self-inflicted. It took a while, but Mandy was able to recover some prints from the beer bottle, but it came back to Brian.
Yeah. He hated himself.
Thanks.
Well, all three are jacketed hollow points with a center post. Hydra-
Got five lands and grooves, right-hand twist. Could've been fired from a Smith and Wesson, Ruger, or a Taurus.
Damn. The mother had access to that gun and motive.
Which, based on her wounds, you figure that was the murder weapon?
Kid starts asking the wrong questions, talking to the wrong people ... tons of possibilities.
Adoptive parents had no contact with the kidnappers? They were not given any ransom demands?
Hey, Greg, you see any books on the shelf over there on gambling or poker?
'Cause I got poker player stats, and multiple websites on online gambling. Seems kind of out of place to be the victim's. I think we got a mystery houseguest who is a card shark.
Got him!
Yeah, whatever.
We're not done yet.
All done here.
Oh, ooh!
Ooh, where's the fire? 
Yeah, it's to help me sleep. I've been having the hardest time lately.
Well, just coming off of grave after all these years, you know, takes a while to adjust.  You're a tough cookie. I'm not worried about you. Take care of yourself, huh?
Yeah.
Thank you.
He was too good for this world.
Yeah, he booby-trapped the stash so if the cops got the drugs ...
Not so fast, cowboy. Give me those keys.
Looks like this lock's been slipped.
To blend in with the rest of the cocaine bricks. Cute. Explosive liquids are generally pretty volatile. Did you ask Hodges if nitro-acetate has any special storage requirements?
Well, there's only so many refrigerators in the lab. Maybe 'where' can get us to 'who'.
I'm sorry, we can't tell you that, Henry.
That's a high explosive binary, Henry.
I think the baking soda was used to absorb a lot more than odors, Henry.
Hey.
Yeah. Actually, I felt like a little Pai Gow or some Blackjack. Let's hit the strip.
Yeah. I just drank one of those energy drinks. I probably won't sleep for another couple hours.
All right.
Tina! Tina! Don't call ... Tina!
Damn it.
Hey, Gris, I'm sorry I'm late. I had some business to take care of.
No problem.
I'll be damned. Take a look at that.
Yeah. Here's an ad for the Silver Slipper Casino -- buffet.
Hey, Gris, listen. About me being late ...
I don't know. This, uh ... this whole divorce has taken the wind out of my sails. You know, I used to have the team to distract me from all this, but even that's changed with Sara being gone. I feel kind of disconnected.
Van Halen, 1984.
Either this truck was delivering merchandise for a memorabilia store or it's just plain old.
I don't think this truck's been on the streets since.
The hydraulic cylinder blew.
Look, if the garbage man had this gun, why didn't he just shoot the vic?
Traced the VIN on the garbage truck back to the Regency, the company that made it. The only model of that truck sold in Nevada was to a company called the Regal Sanitation Group. They shut down in '83.
Pezzulo? Wasn't he the mob boss who owned the Starfly?
These scumbags lay roaches. Just when you think they're gone, they pop back up again. Somebody put a hit out on Jason. It couldn't have been Pezzulo 'cause he's been dead for 20 years.
She still around?
This place has always been bad news.
Yet there's always a line.
Heads up.
We're not here about your girls. We're here about this guy.
When is the last time you saw Jason Crewes, sir?
You missing a garbage truck?
Regal Sanitation Group. Your buddy Pezzulo's old company. You inherited the trucks.
Here you go.
So you're the talented Mr. Raykirk, agent to the stars.
What's the difference?
Jason Crewes is dead.
So he took you to Pigalle Boulevard in August. Do you remember that?
I'm an investigator. Some things I do know, but there's a lot that I don't. Somebody put a hit out on your friend. You want to help us out here?
And you told Jason about all this?
Listen, I'm really sorry about all this. But ... um ... thanks a lot for your time.
I have a good feeling he works for Gedda.
According to Mr. Hollywood, Jason cost Gedda a lot of money, and he dissed him, which is more than enough for Gedda to order out a hit on someone, even if Jason is Pezzulo's son.
I ran Pigalle's address to find out if there are any more crimes linked to it over the years. I found hundreds: 416s, 413s, 411s ... the list goes on.
Only thing consistent is that the victims refused to file charges and the witnesses refused to give statements. And it's funny enough the cops lost interest in pursuing it.
I'm saying it looks like Gedda is running an old school extortion racket, and you can't do that without having cops on the payroll.
Hey!
I just want to talk!
I'm not a cop.
Calm down. I'm not going to hurt you. You live here?
You ever see anybody get beat up inside?
Don't make me pull those warrants, man.
You ever see the owner beat up anyone?
I didn't ask you that.
What do you mean by 'hauled off'?
Do I need one?
What do you do with this?
Hey.
Trying to get this warrant for Gedda's property. I'm getting close though. Check out these bruise patterns.
What?
Oh, they're supposed to keep me alert.
Yeah.
I don't know, for a couple months.
What's it to you?
Gimme a break, man.
Hey, let it go, bro.
Yeah.
The 415 vic claims he got beat up inside the Pigalle. Couple days later, he dropped all the charges. And then there's the unsolved murder. They find a vic out in the desert, but they find his car outside of Pigalle's.
Same bruise pattern. Now we got this Hollywood agent who mentions that he also has bruises under his arms. He claims that he was strapped to a barber's chair in Gedda's office.
What judge?
When I was running bets for Judge Cohen, she was in on the action.
You know, these club owners -- they pay a lot of taxes; they fund campaigns; they hand out free drinks, all in exchange for protection. I mean, what can I do?
McKeen!
Judge denied me the warrant.
Get me the warrant. Lou Gedda is getting away with murder.
The barber's chair in Gedda's office made the armpit bruises.
I'm sorry, leave what in your hands -- Gedda's money?
Hey!
What's in the bag?
Show me.
Here, let me help you with that.
I'm sorry.
Got any Dom Perignon?
What about Cristal?
I' take one of each.
Hey ...
I'm sorry about earlier. I thought you were carrying a dead body in there or something.
I'm Warrick Brown.
Nice to meet you, Candy. So, you work here?
Everything.
Hey, cheers, girl.
Hey, let's get out of here, you and me.
Come on, I just want to ask you a few questions.
How'd you know I was here?
Come on, Gris, why don't you sit down and have a drink with us?
So am I.
No, I want to let them know I'm here. I figured I'd order a couple bottles and not pay for it and see what happens.
It's worth a try.
Thank you.
I'm good to drive, Gris, my car is right here. You gotta admit, though, the girls are pretty fine in there. Listen ... 
My car's right here.
Hey ... follow that girl.
Not tonight.  Irish whiskey. Neat. What's your real name, Candy?
Joanna. I'll stick with Candy.
So, now that we're out of the Pigalle, you can help me out with a few questions.
Well, anybody ever get heavy-handed with you?
Nice. Not even the owner, Gedda?
Thanks.
So what about the customer? They ever get beat-downs?
You ever see a barber's chair in Gedda's office?
Al Capone.
Scumbags like him don't have culture.
What's a hot young thing like you doing working in a nasty place like that?
How about you giving me that last dance of the evening?
What is it? What is it? You kidding me? 
What's that? 
Put that thing away.
Oh, yeah.
Right. Protection.
I don't need protection from you, girl.
Come here.
You-you're a trouble-troublemaker, do you know that? 
I like trouble.
trouble ... trouble -- 
Come get it. Yeah, like that.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's all over for you ‚Äì Here you go. 
Come here. Come here. Come here.
Get over there.
Yeah, you need to be dealt with. Ah.
Yeah, I feel good.
Thanks. 
Nooo! Nooo! No, this is wrong! She didn't do anything!

Who is it?
Shoot.
Can I help you?
Yeah.
Yeah, we went to high school together.
Yeah, yeah, it was a big blow; we were close.
Yeah, come in.
Yeah, on special occasion. Why?
Yeah, he, James and I were tight. We went to high school together. What's this about?
All right, James was dying. He had a bad heart, everybody knew it, so we flew him out here for one last bash, and Preston got called to the Tangiers and it was Jamie. The poor guy died in the parking lot.
Well, we already bought the booze.
He was my best friend, you know?
Look, I know how it looks, but if you knew Jamie ... it's what he would've wanted. And we did return him.
He would have done it for me.

Yeah, sure. It's Kira Dellinger.
Uh ... last night.
At her place. We had s*x.
We used to date in high school. Then we reconnected online, and, uh ... I came down to the campus to check out her band.
Well, I ... uh ... I kind of helped her out with a boyfriend problem.
Yeah. Yeah, that's the guy. He was ... uh ... he was into her, you know, but she ... she was not into him. And he started giving her static, so ... I knocked the little douche's teeth out. I guess she kind of liked it, because she took me back to her place after that.
She fell asleep ... and then I started feeling sick, so I ... uh ... got my car to drive home. Then I got really dizzy and ... uh ... wham. That's it.
Wh-what do you mean, 'she was alive'?

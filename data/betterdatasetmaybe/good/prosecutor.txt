Now, is this the knife you found?
Hmm. Who was the registered owner of the vehicle?
Please describe the physical condition of the knife when you discovered it.
And how did you process this evidence?
Rachel Lyford who lived in unit seven of the Saturn Arms apartment complex. The same complex as the defendant?
Is this knife consistent in size and shape to the fatal wounds sustained by Rachel Lyford?
Thank you. Your honor, we have no further questions for CSI Brown.
Additional evidence is pending. The knife would've been more than sufficient for the purpose of a prelim.
Not at this time. 
Your honor, the defendant is accused of raping and killing a 19-year-old woman. You can't just let him back on the street. 
Your honor, we received no prior notice of this motion. Um ... we would ask for a continuance and opportunity to reopen.
We're only asking for 24 hours.
You compared Mr. Quinn's DNA to DNA from semen recovered at the crime scene, is that correct?
Judge, we have no further questions.

It was, like, an hour ago, when they took him away on that cart.
Oh, you call me Binky. Everybody call me Binky.
Lorenzo? Everybody call him Happy.
Oh, Happy, Happy. He was a fighter. He was a born boxer. He had speed, he had skills, he had heart, he had ... punch! You know, four years ago, he was a top-ranked middleweight.
Yeah. But he... I don't know ... stumble into hard times.
You know. Boompa, boompa sniff, sniff. Like, party time. And I... I mean, I buy his contract, I take him out here, I give him a double-wide. I build him a gym to train him, and I train him. I can make him a champion.
Well, in hindsight, maybe not so good idea.
Everybody loved Happy.
You ... I want you to catch this person. Find him, please. And, you know ... anytime your boys need a break, we have something here we call a cop special.
Any girl, no charge and one complimentary drink ... 
Okay, two complimentary drinks. And one appetizer of your choice here at the bar. Tonight, we have, uh ... ?
Yes.

Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Are you ... are you okay?
I-I am so sorry. I was on the phone, and I was going too fast, and I just ... 
Oh, God, um ... I'm going to call 911, and I'm going get you an ambulance.
Okay.
At least, can I just ... I'm going to call the police and make a police report.
No, no, no. That's okay. I do. Look, it was my fault; I know that. And that is exactly what I will tell them. My dad just said, if I ever got into an accident that I had to make a police report.
Okay.

All right, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Pharaoh's Fever. Buckle up. Get ready to scream.
Couple of months. I got a promotion. I used to work the merry-go-round.
Yeah. Only little kids go on the merry-go-round.
Yeah, something like that.
Training? I release the brake. I press a button. It's green and marked 'start'.
Um ... front bench was a girl. She was blond.
Cute.
Uh, followed by a punk, old folks and some other dude.
That's all I remember.
We got a digital camera. It's mounted right over there.
Camera's on a trigger. Train passes by, automatically snaps a picture and stores it in the computer's hard drive. The train was airborne. Never even got close to the camera.
Uh, so, Woody said that I might be able to help you with your investigation.
Yeah, Monday to Friday. Uh, class till 3:00. Tutor kids in math till 5:00, and then I head over to the park. We close at 10:00.
Jimmy Nevins. His red t-bird was out there.
Yeah, sure; pretty cool guy. Worked the bumper cars. I still can't believe what happened, you know? I mean, I must have rode that coaster, like, phew, a hundred times, maybe more. Anyway, sometimes Jimmy stayed after closing.
Look, I'm not trying to get anybody in trouble, but occasionally, Jimmy would take his ... dates for rides on The Fever, you know? Everybody knew about it. It was really no big deal.
No, sorry.
The same key that opens up the men's room door opens up all the power boxes at the park.
It's just hanging outside Woody's office.
Nope. Night guy got laid off. Budget cuts last winter. It's not like anybody's going break into an amusement park and steal a coaster, you know?
Oh, hey, guys.
Yeah, yeah.
Is that why you guys are here?
Um, you guys mind if we talk about this somewhere else?
Yeah, it's, uh, just a little bit of a rash. It's really no big deal.
What do ... ? I-I don't understand.
Yes, sir, that's correct.
I don't care about Jim Nevins.
No, she didn't say anything. It was all over the park. Jim was going to take Lisa on one of his coaster dates. I asked her about it. She said it was a rumor.
Lady, I make $20 an hour tutoring. Why do you think I'd take minimum wage at the Sphinx?
We started hanging out at breaks. Having dinner. And then last week, after tutoring, we went for a walk. And she grabbed my hand.
Of course.
No. I wanted to.
Oh, but you see, she was lying.
Guess I just didn't think about it.

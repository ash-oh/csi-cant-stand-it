Yes. There's been an accident. An accident. Please ... 
Please, ma'am, I need you to send an ambulance. Please, just hurry.
Oh, my God! Please, you've got to help me! Please, hurry!
What the hell? No, not me, my wife!
Hurry! She's in here!
What does that mean?
Wh-What does that mean?
I don't think I moved her. Um, I mean, I cradled her head in my lap. Tried to wake her up, but that's it.
I, you know, got comfortable ... then we went outside and did a few shots.
Um, the phone rang and it was my daughter Susan.
Yeah, from my first marriage. She's, she's staying at Becky's dad's.
All right. It's Susan.
Another shot or two and then I guess I fell asleep. And I woke up around midnight.  And I figured that she and Susan had just gotten into one of their talk-a-thons.
I took the tequila and the glasses into the kitchen and that's when I saw her.
Oh, my God. Oh, please!
Oh, please, please! Oh, God. Oh, please, Oh please.
From the kitchen, it's closer to the bedroom.
Are you trying to trip me up or something? I mean, I don't ... maybe she went to, uh, brush her teeth or put on her nightgown. I really don't know.
I'll go upstairs and change.
My wife likes to bite, and I don't mind it, okay?
Look, I loved my wife. But, a year into our marriage, she told me that she wasn't into s*x anymore. And, uh, she went frigid on me. Asked me to move into the other bedroom.
Well, I kept hoping things would get better. And we had fun and we respected each other. And she was a great mom to Susan.
I found a way to make our relationship work.
I met a girl online. She liked biting. I liked being bit. It just seemed like a good match, and it never got sexual.
I know her as buffy227gmail.com.
We'd meet at a motel ... every few weeks. I'd tell Becky that I was going out for a bite. It was consensual and it wasn't sexual. It was not cheating.
I didn't tell Becky everything I did every minute of the day, but that doesn't mean that I was unfaithful.
Four years ago.  Rosy Palm and Thumbelina are the only action that I get.
I'm just answering the questions.
Are we done here?
I was ... being blackmailed. Um, someone found out about Buffy. I ... I got a letter and a photo in the mail. They wanted 200 grand or the ....
Yeah. Our marriage was having enough problems.
She hadn't seen me naked in a long time. I just ... I would've been humiliated if she found out about Buffy. She was a great mom. And she kept ... she kept me sane when my business went under.
Yeah. I couldn't risk letting Becky find it. Soon as I opened that letter, it went right into my briefcase. I've got the only key.
You've reached the home office of Ray Lester. Please leave your details after the beep.
All right. 
It's Susan.
What?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I'm sorry, but that's what happ ...
You can't prove it.

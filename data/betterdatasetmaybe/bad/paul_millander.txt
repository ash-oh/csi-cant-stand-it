A staged suicide?. You're kidding, right? I swear on my kids I've never seen that man before in my life.
Sure.
No, why?
Well, yeah. Yeah, sure. At-at my job.
Yes, sir, everything from scratch. We mold, carve, shape, paint and authenticate.
Thanks.
Sure, we do, uh ... 
This is our best seller right here. Sold 10,000 of those units last Halloween. Even used my own hand for the mold.
Yeah, why? What does that mean?
Hey, it's the forensics guy. I forgot your name. I-I'm sorry.
Hi, Mr. Grissom. It's been a couple of months. How are you, sir?
I-I-I call it ... 'Good versus Evil.' You like it?
So, what brings you down to my humble abode?
Yeah. How's that going?
Say, w-would you like a cup of coffee? I got instant.
It's really all I know. I ... started out doing ice carvings but the artwork never lasted.
Let's sit. 
How can I help you?
How could I forget?
Sure.
Bestseller. Yes, sir.
I really don't have a list. Uh ... Why?
I would really love to help you, Mr. Grissom, but ... I just don't keep track of ... of individual purchasers. I-I-I'm just a wholesaler. I don't ... I don't crunch numbers. I-I just ... spook the children.
I sold ten thousand of those units last Halloween. Even used my own hand for the mold.
Mr. Grissom in?
No. Just tell him a friend stopped by.
A friend. He'll know. 
It's not where I'm headed.
I-I-I call it 'good versus evil.'
Can't be too safe out there, can we, Mr. Grissom?
Hungry?
Was he?
To which I reply, 'old habits die hard.'
Dear. As a Judge, I don't want the outside world privy to my private life because they'll use it against me.
My prints came back sound.
As I told you earlier, dear, Mr. Grissom has confused me with a very bad man. I left him fingerprints so that he could confirm that I am who I say I am.
We sold 10,000 of those units last Halloween. Even used my own hand for the mold.
They told my parents I had an 'endocrinic ambiguity.' My chromosomes said female, but my body wasn't that sure. The doctors told my parents to raise me as they saw fit. Unfortunately, they disagreed.
I managed. Until ... that night.
A boy ... could have saved his father.
Y ... yes.
They went free.
I am ... comfortable sharing this with you. My, uh ... my mother wouldn't hear it. Against her wishes, I cut off my hair. Started wearing big shirts. Big boots. If I got tough enough ... no one would ever hurt me. I went to the clinic ... and became a man. 
Identity is so fluid, you know.
May I?
Aren't you wondering about your birthday? August 17, 1956.
Why I didn't kill you, since you were next?
I've already picked my next victim, if you're curious.
My name is Paul Millander. I reside at 13891 Sand Creek Road. I'm 46 years of age and I'm going to kill myself. I'd like to say 'I love you' to my mother, Isabelle. 
I'm so sorry. I never wanted to put you through this. I just can't do it anymore. I've lost hope.

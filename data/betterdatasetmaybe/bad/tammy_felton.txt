Where did you find him?
No. I want to say good-bye.
No.
No, thank you.
What are you talking about?
I don't understand. 
What are you doing?
Okay, I was there.
Dad! Dad, don't do this. I'll get a job. We don't need the money. Not like this.
And I don't know what happened after that.
I wanted to preserve the good memories not remember my dad as a thief.  I didn't kill him. I loved him. I need a release from your office ... so I can bury my father.
I didn't kill my father.
My father was Joseph, my mother was Mara and they're both dead.
Hey, uh, let's be smart about this. You can take us in or we can cut you in.
Deal?

I never met the guy.
Look, I didn't mean to harm anybody, all right? I didn't know what I was cutting. Probably got a bad batch.
Order's up.
What can I get you?
The days of comping drinks ... sticking the hotel with the bill, those are done. Everything's computerized down to the last drop. Standard protocol. Down to the way the girls order their drinks: Sodas first, mixers second, beers last. No exceptions.
Back of the house.
Coming up.
Eight dollars.
Thank you.
Come on, Nadine. Order your drinks in the right order, okay? I'm swamped.
Hey, Alan, you got a spot open now. What do you say tomorrow you give me some time?
Welcome to open mike night, guys. What can I get you?
Oh, really. I'm sorry it's not up to the standards of your crap-ass home brew, but that'll be five bucks all the same, my friend.
Yours truly. Bartender. Mr. Max had very acquired tastes. Lofty demands, you know. Six pristine Innoko water bottles, labels all facing the Luxor. And a green room? Forget it. Silver tray, spam, choco bees -- all blue. Not-not to mention that, uh, passion fruit stuff -- what is it, two bucks a pop? Try to find that stuff.
Really?
That... Dougie's private stash.
Nobody's allowed behind the bar besides the bar staff and me.
Hey, that's going on your tab, you Leech!
Yeah, I had a temper, until I kicked the crap out of a heckler for interrupting my closing bit.
I'm getting one right now.
I got to get my wig redone like in a half hour, so if we...
Yeah, I gave him the red light. What are you going to do, arrest me for distraction with intent to humiliate? I'm guilty.  What? Are you kidding me? I was joking.
You are ... ?
Oh, right, you must be his cop friend.
1992-1999
Get you another one?
Yeah. She's been in a few times.
Yeah.
Throwing them back pretty good, too.
She was getting a lot of attention. She didn't really seem to mind.
No. She was wasted. Had me call her a cab.
We were really slammed. Maybe 2:00 ... 2:30.
Lucky Cab.
Why? Do I know you?
Sure.
One second, Honey.
You want to talk to Mercedes. She's in the back.
You're welcome.
The guy down there wants to buy you your next drink.
He's the owner, man. But even I haven't seen him in, like, three weeks. Sorry.
Yeah, I seen him around last couple of days. Friendly enough.
It's not that type of place.
Yeah, he's a regular of mine. A-lister with the ladies, you know.
Why don't you check in the back?
There you go.
What can I do you for?
Always. I own the place.
Was a busy night, I'm sorry.
What's this about?
Yeah, that's the only one. Just gets the cash register.
No need to.

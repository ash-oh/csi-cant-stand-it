Burglary? In this neighborhood?
No. My wife, didn't mention anything either. 
Again? Look, I'm sorry. I have to go change Dylan.
Yeah, in my spare time between the grocery store and the park and baby jamboree. No, no, this ... this is my life. Sorry.
Eilene, honey? Everything okay?
They had a warrant. I didn't want to bother you at work.
Eilene ...
No. No, I will not shut up. You know, I didn't ask you to be my attorney. You're just doing this to look out for yourself.
Really? And how exactly is sleeping with Ronald looking after your family?
Cameron ... what? What? You never gave a damn about me. And our child ... our child is just some yuppie pet designed to make you look better at the firm. Which happens to be the only family you probably really care about.
Corporate bitch! You still think you're too good to touch your own husband? How about I make you beg for air? Huh? How about I make you ... beg for it?!
Are you begging for it? Huh? I can't hear you, Eilene.
I had to pay some girl to pretend to be my wife.
Wait, wait, wait. Epithelials -- that's like ... that's like DNA, right? That's DNA?
Okay, I got an idea. Why don't we test little Dylan's epithelials? Huh? See if his daddy isn't really your law partner. 'Cause, god knows, you haven't let me touch you in three years.
I'm out of here.
Away from you. Other than that, I really don't care.

Hey Professor Prud'hommeaux,
We wanted to let you know that we did not realize that the GitHub history would be used to see who uploaded what so at the beginning of the project we were not all granted access to upload to the git-hub and emailed/texted our files to each other (mostly to Ashley) to upload to it. Later on in the project we were all able to get access and thus those contribution labels are genuine. We as a group feel contributions have been made evenly and should you have any questions/concerns about who did what we are all available by email. I apologize for this inconvenience
